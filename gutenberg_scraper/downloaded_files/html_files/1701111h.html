  </b><b>Two Friends</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Like  doth not always draw to like&mdash;in truth<br>
    Old age is ever worshipful of youth,<br>
    Seeing in boyish dreams with daring rife,<br>
    A reflex of the spring time of its life,<br>
    When sword in hand with Hope&rsquo;s brave flag unfurled,<br>
It sallied forth to fight the blust&rsquo;ring world.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was about mid-day, and the train having emerged from the darkness of the St.  Gothard tunnel, was now steaming rapidly on its winding line through the  precipitous ravines of the Alps, under the hot glare of an August sun. On  either side towered the mountains, their rugged sides of grey chaotic stone  showing bare and bleak at intervals amid the dense masses of dark green  foliage.</p>
  <p>Sometimes  a red-roofed ch&acirc;let would appear clinging swallow-like to the steep hill-side&mdash;then  the sudden flash of a waterfall tumbling in sheets of shattered foam from  craggy heights: high above, fantastic peaks swathed in wreaths of pale mist,  and now and then the glimpse of a white Alpine summit, milky against the clear  blue of the sky.</p>
  <p>On  sped the engine with its long train of carriages, as though anxious to leave  the inhospitable mountain land for the fertile plains of Italy&mdash;now crawling  fly-like round the giant flank of a hill&mdash;anon plunging into the cool gloom of a  tunnel&mdash;once more panting into the feverish heat&mdash;sweeping across slender  viaducts hanging perilously over foaming torrents&mdash;gliding like a snake under  towering masses of rock&mdash;and running dangerously along the verge of dizzy  precipices, while white-walled, red-roofed, green-shuttered villages, shapeless  rocks, delicately green forests, snow-clad peaks, and thread-like waterfalls  flashed past the tired eyes of the passengers in the train with the rapidity of  a kaleidoscope.</p>
  <p>And  it was hot&mdash;the insufferable radiance of the southern sun, blazing down from a  cloudless sky, beat pitilessly on the roofs of the railway carriages, until the  occupants were quite worn out with the heat and glare from which they could not  escape.</p>
  <p>In  one of the first-class carriages two men were endeavouring to alleviate the  discomfort in some measure, and had succeeded in obtaining a partial twilight  by drawing down the dark blue curtains, but the attempt was hardly successful,  as through every chink and cranny left uncovered, shot the blinding white  arrows of the sun-god, telling of the intolerable brilliance without.</p>
  <p>One  of the individuals in question was lying full length on the cushions, his head  resting on a dressing-bag, and his eyes half closed, while the other was curled  up in a corner on the opposite side, with his hands in his pockets, his head  thrown back, and a discontented look on his boyish face, as he stared upward.  Both gentlemen had their coats off, their waistcoats unbuttoned and their  collars loose, trying to make themselves as comfortable as possible in the  sweltering heat.</p>
  <p>On  the seats and floor of the carriage a litter of books and papers showed how  they had been striving to beguile the time, but human nature had given in at  last, and they were now reduced to a state of exhaustion, to get through the  next few hours as best they could until their arrival at Chiasso, where they  intended to leave the train and drive over to their destination at Cernobbio,  on Lake Como.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  Jove!&rdquo; groaned the lad in the corner, settling himself into a more comfortable  position, &ldquo;what a devil of a day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first oath,&rdquo; murmured the recumbent man lazily, with his eyes still closed, &ldquo;is  apt, and smacks of classic culture suitable to the land of Italy, but the  latter is English and barbaric.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bother,&rdquo; retorted his friend impatiently, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do the subject justice in  the way of swearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  don&rsquo;t try; the tortures of Hades are bad enough without the language thereof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem comfortable at all events, Gartney,&rdquo; said the boy crossly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;St.  Lawrence,&rdquo; observed Mr. Gartney, opening his eyes, &ldquo;had a bed of roses on his  gridiron compared with this eider-down cushion on which I lie&mdash;the saint  roasted, I simmer&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be quite done by the time we reach Chiasso.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  done now,&rdquo; groaned his companion. &ldquo;Do shut up, Gartney, and I&rsquo;ll try and get  some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gartney  laughed softly at the resigned manner in which the other spoke, and once more  closed his eyes while his friend, following his example, fell into an uneasy  slumber interrupted by frequent sighs and groans.</p>
  <p>He  was a pleasant enough looking boy, but not what would be called handsome, with  his merry grey eyes, his rather wide mouth, his well-cut nose with sensitive  nostrils, and his wavy auburn hair suiting his fair freckled skin; all these  taken individually were by no means faultless, yet altogether they made up a  countenance which most people liked. Then he had a tall, well-knit figure, and  as he dressed well, rode well, was an adept in all kinds of athletic sports,  with exuberant animal spirits and a title, Angus Macjean, Master of Otterburn,  was a general favourite with his own sex, and a particular favourite with the  other.</p>
  <p>What  wit and humour the lad possessed came from his Irish mother, who died, poor  soul, shortly after he was born, and was not sorry to leave the world either,  seeing it was rendered so unpleasant by her stern Presbyterian husband. Why she  married Lord Dunkeld when, as a Dublin belle, she could have done so much  better, was a mystery to everyone, but at all events marry him she did with the  aforesaid results, death for herself after a year of unhappy married life, and  an heir to the Macjean title.</p>
  <p>Lord  Dunkeld was sincerely sorry in his own cold way when she died, never dreaming,  narrow-minded bigot as he was, that life in the gloomy Border castle was  unsuited to the brilliant, impulsive Irishwoman, and after placing her remains  in the family vault, he proceeded to apply to his son&rsquo;s life the same rules  that finished Lady Dunkeld&rsquo;s existence. The boy, however, had Scotch grit in  him as well as Celtic brilliance, and as he grew up under his father&rsquo;s eye,  gave promise both intellectually and physically of future excellence, so that  when he reached the age of nineteen, he was the pride of the old lord, and of  the endless Macjean clan, who were very proud, very poor, and very numerous.</p>
  <p>But  whatever pride Dunkeld felt in the perfections of his heir he took care never  to show it to the lad on the principle that it would make him vain, and vanity,  according to Mr. Mactab, the minister who looked after the spiritual welfare of  the family, &ldquo;was a snare o&rsquo; the auld enemy wha gaes roaring up an&rsquo; doon the  warld.&rdquo; So Angus was never pandered to in that way, but led a studious, joyless  existence, his only pleasures being shooting and fishing, while occasionally  Dunkeld entertained a few of his friends who were of the same way of thinking  as himself, and made merry in a decorous, dreary fashion.</p>
  <p>At  the age of nineteen, however, the lad rebelled against the dismal life to which  his father condemned him, for as the princess in the brazen castle, despite all  precautions, found out about the prince coming to release her, so Angus  Macjean, from various sources, learned facts about a pleasant life in the outside  world, which made him long to leave the cheerless castle and rainy northern  skies for a place more congenial to the Irish side of his character. With such  ideas, it is scarcely to be wondered at that he became more unmanageable every  day, until Lord Dunkeld with many misgivings sent him to Oxford to finish his  education, but as a safeguard placed by his side as servant one Johnnie  Armstrong, a middle-aged Scotchman of severe tendencies, who was supposed to be  &ldquo;strong in the spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  to this seat of learning, Otterburn went, as his progenitors had gone before  him, and falling in by some trick of Fate with a somewhat fast set, indulged  his Irish love for pleasure to the utmost. Not that he did anything wrong, or  behaved worse than the general run of young men, but his &lsquo;Varsity life was  hardly one which would have been approved of by his severe parent or the  upright minister who had nurtured his young intellect on the psalms of David.</p>
  <p>Still  Johnnie Armstrong!</p>
  <p>Alas,  for the frailty of human nature, Johnnie Armstrong, the strong in spirit, the  guardian of morality, the prop of a wavering faith, yielded to the temptations  of the world, and held only too readily that tongue which should have warned  Otterburn against the snares of Belial, for, truth to tell, Johnnie made as  complaisant a guardian as the most dissipated rake could have desired. The  world, the flesh, and the devil was too strong a trinity for Johnnie to stand  against, so he surrendered himself to the temptations of this life in the most  pusillanimous manner, aiding and abetting his young master with misdirected  zeal. Behold then, Angus Macjean and his leal henchman both fallen away from  grace and having a good time of it at Oxford, so much so, indeed, that  Otterburn was quite sorry when his father, after two years&rsquo; absence, summoned  him to Dunkeld Castle to grace the ceremony of his coming of age.</p>
  <p>That  coming of age was a severe trial to Angus, as the guests were mostly Free Kirk  ministers and their spouses, the ministers in lengthy speeches, exhorting him  to follow in the footsteps of his father, <i>i.e</i>., support the Free Kirk,  make large donations to the funds thereof, and entertain ministers of that  following on all possible occasions. Otterburn having learnt considerable craft  at Oxford, made suitable replies, promising all kinds of things which he had  not the slightest idea of fulfilling, and altogether produced a favourable  impression both by such guile and by a display of those educational graces with  which Alma Mater had endowed him. It is needless to say that, aided by the  faithful Johnnie Angus did not tell either his father or Mactab of his gay life  at the University, and the result of this reticence was that the old lord,  bestowing on him a small income out of the somewhat straitened finances of the  Macjeans, bade him enjoy himself in London for a year, and then return to  marry.</p>
  <p>To  marry! Poor Angus was horror-struck at such a prospect, the more so when his  father introduced him to the lady selected to be his bride, a certain Miss  Cranstoun who had a good income, but nothing else to recommend her to his  fastidious taste.</p>
  <p>However,  being a somewhat philosophical youth, he accepted the inevitable, for he knew  it would be easier to move Ben Nevis than his father, and trusting to the  intervention of a kind Providence to avert his matrimonial fate, he went up to  London with Johnnie to enjoy himself, which he did, but hardly in the way  anticipated by Lord Dunkeld.</p>
  <p>Thinking  his marriage with the plain-looking Miss Cranstoun was unavoidable, he made up  his mind to see as much of life as he could during his days of freedom, and  proceeded to do so to his own detriment, morally, physically and pecuniarily,  when he chanced to meet with Eustace Gartney.</p>
  <p>Eustace  Gartney, whimsical in his fancies, took a liking to the lonely lad, left to his  own devices in such a dangerous place as London, and persuaded him to come to  Italy hoping to acquire an influence over the young man and keep him on the  right path until his return to Dunkeld Castle.</p>
  <p>There  was certainly a spice of selfishness in this arrangement, as Eustace was  attracted by the exuberant animal spirits and Irish wit of the lad, which  formed a contrast to the general run of young men of to-day, and to his own  pessimistic views of life, so, much as he disliked putting himself out in any  way, he determined to stand by the inexperienced youth, and save him from his  impulsive good nature and love of pleasure.</p>
  <p>Lord  Dunkeld, deeming it wise that Angus should see something of Continental life,  and having full confidence in the straightforwardness of Johnnie Armstrong,  agreed to the journey, much to his son&rsquo;s surprise, and this was how The Hon.  Angus Macjean, in company with Eustace Gartney, was in a railway train midway  between St. Gothard and Chiasso.</p>
  <p>And  Eustace Gartney, poet, visionary, philosopher, pessimist&mdash;what of him? Well, it  is rather difficult to say. His friends called him mad, but then one&rsquo;s friends  always say that of anyone whose character they find it difficult to understand.  He was eminently a child of the latter half of this curious century, the  outcome of an over-refined civilization, the last expression of an artificial  existence, and a riddle hard and unguessable to himself and everyone around  him.</p>
  <p>For  one thing, he always spoke the truth, and that in itself was sufficient to  stamp him as an eccentric individual, who had no motive for existence in a  society where the friendship of its members depends in a great measure on their  dexterity in evading it. Again Gartney was iconoclastic in his tendencies, and  loved to knock down, break up, and otherwise maltreat the idols which Society  has set up in high places for the purposes of daily worship. The Goddess of  Fashion, the Idol of Sport, the Deity of Conventionalism, all these and their  kind were abominations to this disrespectful young man, who displayed a lack of  reverence for such things which was truly appalling.</p>
  <p>It  was not as though he had emerged from that unseen world of the lower classes,  of which the upper ten know nothing, to denounce the follies and fashions of  the hour; no, indeed, Eustace Gartney had been born in the purple, inherited  plenty of money, been brought up in a conventional manner, and the astonishing  ideas he possessed, so destructive to the well-being of Society, were certainly  not derived from his parents. Both his father and mother had been of the most  orthodox type, and would doubtless have looked upon their son&rsquo;s eccentricities  with dismay had they lived, but as they both finished with the things of this  life shortly after he was born, they were mercifully spared the misery of  reflecting that they had produced such a firebrand. Indeed they might have  checked his radical-iconoclastic-pessimistic follies at their birth had they  lived, but Fate willed it otherwise, and in addition to robbing Eustace of his  parents had given him careless guardians, who rarely troubled their heads about  him, so that he grew up without discipline or guidance, and even at the age of  thirty-eight years was still under the control of an extremely ill-regulated  mind.</p>
  <p>Tall,  heavily-built, loose-limbed, with a massive head, leonine masses of dark hair,  roughly-cut features, and keen grey eyes, he gave the casual observer an idea  that he possessed a fund of latent strength, both intellectual and physical,  but he rarely indulged the former, and never by any chance displayed the  latter. Clean-shaven, with a peculiarly sensitive mouth, his smile&mdash;when he did  smile, which was seldom&mdash;was wonderfully fascinating, and completely changed the  somewhat sombre character of his face. He usually dressed in a careless, shabby  fashion, though particular about the spotlessness of his linen, rolled in his  gait as if he had been all his life at sea, looked generally half asleep, and,  despite the little trouble he took with his outward appearance, was a very  noticeable figure. When he chose, he could talk admirably, played the piano in  the most brilliant fashion, wrote charming verses and fantastic essays, and  altogether was very much liked in London Society, when he chose to put in an appearance  at the few houses whose inmates did not bore him.</p>
  <p>Without  doubt a singularly loveable man; children adored him, animals fawned on him,  and friends, ah&mdash;that was the rub, seeing that he denied the existence of such  things, classing them in the category of rocs, sea-serpents, hippogriffs, and  such-like strange beasts. Therefore dismissing the word friends, which only  applies to uncreated beings, and substituting the word acquaintances, which is  good enough to ticket one&rsquo;s fellow creatures with, the acquaintances of Mr.  Gartney liked him&mdash;or said they liked him&mdash;very much.</p>
  <p>Absence  in this case doubtless made their hearts grow fonder, as Eustace was rarely in  England, preferring to travel in the most outlandish regions, his usual address  being either Timbuctoo, the Mountains of the Moon, or the dominions of Prester  John. He had explored most of this small planet of ours, and had written books  in the Arabian Nights vein about things which people said never existed, and  talked vaguely of yachting in the Polar seas, exploring the buried cities of  Central America, or doing something equally original. At present, however, he  had dismissed these whimsical projects for an indefinite period, as the  marriage of his cousin Guy Errington and the friendship of Angus Macjean now  occupied his attention.</p>
  <p>Then  again his last book of paradoxical essays had been a great success, as  everybody of his acquaintance, both friends and foes, abused it&mdash;and read it.  The critics, who know everything, had denounced the book as blasphemous,  horrible, coarse, drivelling, with the pleasing result that it had an  exceptionally large sale; and although most people, guided by the big dailies,  said they were shocked at the publication of such a book, yet they secretly  liked the brilliant incisive writing, and wanted to lionise the author, but  Eustace getting wind of the idea promptly betook himself to the Continent in  order to escape such an infliction.</p>
  <p>It  was impossible that such a peculiar personage could be happy, and Eustace  certainly was not, as his fame, his money and his prosperity were all so much  Dead Sea fruit to his discontented mind. And why? Simply because he was one of  those exacting men who demand from the world more than the world, which is  selfish in the extreme, is prepared to give, and because he could not obtain  the moon sulked like a naughty child at his failure to attain the impossible.</p>
  <p>If  he made a friend, he then and there demanded more than the most complaisant  friend could give, so his friendship always ended in quarrels, and he would  then inveigh against the heartlessness of human nature simply because he could  not make his friend a slave to his whims and fancies.</p>
  <p>He  had been in love, or thought so, many times, but without any definite result,  as he had a disagreeable habit of analysing womankind too closely; and as they  never by any chance came up to the impossible standard of perfection he  desired, the result was invariably the same, irritation on his side, pique on  the woman&rsquo;s, and ultimate partings in mutual disgust. Then he would retire from  the world for a time, nurse his disappointment in solitude, and emerge at  length with a series of bitter poems or a volume of cynical essays, in which he  summarised his opinions regarding his last failure in love or friendship. A bitter  man, a discontented man, absurdly exacting, intolerant of all things that were  not to his liking, yet withal&mdash;strange contrast&mdash;a loveable character.</p>
  <p>Angus  Macjean therefore was his latest friend, but it was not altogether a selfish  feeling, as he was genuinely anxious to save the friendless lad from the  dangerous tendencies of an impulsive nature; nevertheless, his liking was not  entirely disinterested, seeing that he enjoyed the bright boyish nature of  Otterburn, with his impossible longings, and his enthusiastic hero-worship of  himself. So this spoilt child, pleased with his new toy, saw the world and his  fellow men in a more kindly light than usual, and, provided the mood lasted,  there was a chance that the happy disposition of Macjean might ameliorate to  some extent the gloom of his own temperament.</p>
  <p>On  his part, Angus was flattered by the friendship of such a clever man, and  moreover secretly admired the cynicism of his companion, though, truth to tell,  he did not always understand the vague utterances of his oracle, for Gartney  was somewhat enigmatic at times. Still on the whole Angus liked him, and his  enthusiastic nature led him to endow his idol with many perfections which it  certainly did not possess.</p>
  <p>Thus  these two incongruous natures had come together, but how long such an amicable  state of things would last was questionable. There was always the fatal rock of  boredom ahead, upon which their friendship might be wrecked, and if Gartney  grew weary of Otterburn or Otterburn of Gartney, the result would be&mdash;well the  result was still to come.</p>

    An Incomplete Madonna</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;She  is a maid<br>
    Who hath a look prophetic in her eyes,<br>
    A longing for&mdash;she knows not what herself;<br>
    Yet if by chance when kneeling rapt in prayer,<br>
    She raised her eyes to Mother Mary&rsquo;s face,<br>
    Within her breast a thought&mdash;till then unguessed,<br>
    Amazing all her dreamings virginal,<br>
    Would show her, by that vision motherly,<br>
The something needed to complete her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is an Incomplete Madonna.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were near the end of their journey when Gartney made this reply, and having  reduced the chaos of books and papers into something like order, they were both  sitting up with their garments in a more presentable condition, smoking  cigarettes, and talking about the Erringtons.</p>
  <p>This  family, consisting of two people, male and female, bride and bridegroom, were  staying at the Villa Tagni on Lake Como, and Sir Guy Errington, being a cousin  of Gartney&rsquo;s, had asked his eccentric relative to pay them a visit while in the  vicinity, which he had consented to do. This being the case, Otterburn, who,  unacquainted with the happy pair, except as to their name and relationship to  his friend, was cross-examining Eustace with a view to finding out as much as  he could about them before being introduced.</p>
  <p>Sir  Guy, according to his cynical cousin, was a handsome young fellow, with three  ideas of primitive simplicity in his head, namely, shooting, hunting, and  dining. Quite of the orthodox English type, according to the Gallic &ldquo;it&rsquo;s-a-fine-day-let-us-go-and-kill-something&rdquo;  idea, so Otterburn, having met many such heroes of sporting instincts, asked no  more questions regarding the gentleman, but being moved by the inevitable  curiosity of man concerning woman, put the three orthodox questions which form  a social trinity of perfection in masculine eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she pretty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence  on the part of Mr. Eustace Gartney.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she young?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  silence, but the ghost of a smile on the thin lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she rich?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oracle  again mute, whereupon the exasperated worshipper queries more comprehensively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vague,  enigmatic answer of the oracle:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is an Incomplete Madonna.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn  stared in puzzled surprise at this epigrammatic response to his boyish  cross-examination, and after a bewildered pause burst out laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  too deep for me, Gartney,&rdquo; he said at length, blowing a cloud of thin blue  smoke. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that intellectual extract of beef wherein the  qualities of one&rsquo;s friends are boiled down into a single witty phrase.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  reply pleased Eustace, especially as he was conscious of having said rather a  neat thing, so glancing out into the brilliant world of sunshine to see how far  they were from their destination, he lighted another cigarette and explained  himself gravely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very fond of ticketing my friends in that way, as it saves such a lot of  trouble in answering questions; if you asked me what I should like in my tea, I  should not answer &lsquo;the sweet juice of cane crystallized into white grains.&rsquo; No!  I should simply say &lsquo;sugar,&rsquo; which includes all the foregoing; therefore when  you ask me to describe Lady Errington, I say she is an incomplete Madonna,  which is an admirable description of her in two words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo;  remarked Otterburn, somewhat annoyed, &ldquo;is a lecture on the use and abuse of  epigrams. I don&rsquo;t want to know about epigrams, but I do want to know about Lady  Errington. Your two-word description is no doubt witty, but it doesn&rsquo;t answer  any of my questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, it answers the whole three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen  then, oh groper in Cimmerian gloom. You ask if Lady Errington is young&mdash;of  course, the Madonna is always painted young. Is she pretty? The Madonna, as you  will see in Italian pictures, is absolutely lovely. Is she rich? My dear lad,  we well know Mary was the wife of a carpenter, and therefore poor in worldly  wealth. Ergo, I have answered all your questions by the use of the phrase  incomplete Madonna.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very whimsical explanation at best, besides, you have answered more than I  asked by the use of the word incomplete&mdash;why is Lady Errington incomplete?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  she is not yet a mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  confound your mystic utterances,&rdquo; cried the Master, comically, &ldquo;do descend from  your cloudy heights and tell me what you mean. I gather from your extremely  hazy explanation that Lady Errington is young, pretty, and poor, also that she  is not a mother. So far so good. Proceed, but for heaven&rsquo;s sake no more  epigrams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid the beauty of an epigram is lost on you Macjean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely!  I am neither a poet nor a student, so don&rsquo;t waste your eloquence on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Gartney, smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have pity on your limited  understanding and tell you all about Alizon Errington&rsquo;s marriage in plain  English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do,  it will pass the time delightfully until we leave this infernal train.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Errington, my young friend,&rdquo; said Eustace leisurely, &ldquo;is what you, with your  sinful misuse of the Queen&rsquo;s English, would call &lsquo;a jolly pretty woman,&rsquo; of the  age of twenty-five, but I may as well say that she looks much older than that&mdash;this  is no doubt the peculiar effect of the life she led before her marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the racket,&rdquo; interposed Otterburn, scenting a scandal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort,&rdquo; retorted Gartney, severely. &ldquo;Lady Errington has led the life of a  Saint Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  heard of her. The worthy Mactab didn&rsquo;t approve of saints, as they savoured too  much of the Scarlet Woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  present I will not enlighten your ignorance,&rdquo; said Eustace drily, &ldquo;it would  take too long and I might subvert the training of the excellent Mactab which has  been such a signal success with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn  grinned at this fine piece of irony, but offered no further interruption, so  Eustace went on with his story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew Lady Errington first&mdash;by the way, in saying I know her, I don&rsquo;t mean  personally. I have seen her, heard her speak and met her at the houses of  friends, but I have never been introduced to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know if I can give any particular explanation; she didn&rsquo;t attract me much  as Alizon Mostyn, so I did not seek to know her, nor did she ever show any  desire to make my acquaintance, so beyond knowing each other by sight we  remained strangers, a trick of Fate, I suppose&mdash;that deity is fond of irony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  becoming epigrammatic again,&rdquo; said Otterburn, warningly, &ldquo;proceed with the  narrative.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  laughed, and took up the thread of his discourse without further preamble.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Errington is the daughter of the late Gabriel Mostyn, who was without doubt one  of the biggest scoundrels who ever infested the earth, that is saying a great  deal considering what I know of my friends, but I don&rsquo;t think it is  exaggerated. He was a man of good family, and being a younger son, was, in  conformity with that ridiculous law of English primogeniture, sent out into the  world with a younger son&rsquo;s portion to make his way, which he did, and a very  black way it was. Why a man with a handsome exterior, a clever brain, and a  consummate knowledge of human nature, should have devoted all those advantages  to leading a bad life I don&rsquo;t know, but the wicked fairy who came to Gabriel  Mostyn&rsquo;s cradle, had neutralised all the gifts of her sisters by the bestowal  of an evil soul, for his career, from the time he left the family roof until  the time he died under it, was one long infamy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was a diplomatist first, and was getting on capitally, being attach&eacute; at the  Embassy at Constantinople, when he was caught selling State secrets to the  Russian Government somewhere about the time of the Crimean War, and as the  affair was too glaring to be hushed up, he was kicked out in disgrace. After  this disagreeable episode he led a desultory sort of existence, wandering about  the Continent. He was well known at the gambling hells, and his compatriots  generally gave him a pretty wide berth when they chanced to meet him. In  Germany he married a charming woman, a daughter of a Baron Von Something, and  settled down for a time. However, to keep his hand in, he worried his poor wife  into her grave, and she died three years after the marriage, leaving him two  children&mdash;a son and the present Lady Errington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Mostyn had some property of her own, which she left to her son, and in the  event of the son&rsquo;s death the husband was to inherit. It was a foolish will to  make, knowing as she must have done her husband&rsquo;s disposition, and it was  rather a heartless thing for the mother to leave her daughter out in the cold.  No doubt, however, the astute Gabriel had something to do with it. At all  events he did not trouble much about his children, but leaving them to the care  of their German relatives, went off to Spain, where he was mixed up in the  Carlist war, much to the delight of everyone, for they thought he might be  killed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  devil looks after his own, however, and Mostyn turned up at the conclusion of  the war minus an arm, but as bad as ever. Then he went off to South America,  taking his son with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was nothing very bad in that, at all events,&rdquo; said Otterburn, who was listening  with keen interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shortly  after he arrived at Lima the son disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  devil!&rdquo; interrupted Angus, sitting up quickly; &ldquo;he surely didn&rsquo;t kill the boy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the question,&rdquo; said Eustace grimly, &ldquo;nobody knows what he did with him, but  at all events the boy disappeared and was never heard of again. There was some  of that eternal fighting going on between the South American Republics, and  Mostyn said the lad had been shot, but if he was,&rdquo; pursued Gartney slowly, &ldquo;I  believe his father did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  not&mdash;he had no reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget,&rdquo; observed Eustace sardonically, &ldquo;I told you the boy inherited his  mother&rsquo;s money, that was, no doubt, the reason, for Mostyn came back to Europe  alone, claimed the money, and after obtaining it with some difficulty, soon  squandered it on his own vicious pleasures. Then, as a reward for such conduct,  his elder brother died without issue, and Mr. Gabriel Mostyn, blackguard,  Bohemian and suspected murderer, came in for the family estates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  wicked flourish like a green bay tree,&rdquo; observed Angus, remembering the worthy  Mactab&rsquo;s biblical readings in a hazy kind of way, and misquoting Scripture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  wicked man didn&rsquo;t flourish in this case,&rdquo; retorted Eustace, promptly. &ldquo;Nemesis  was on his track although he little knew it. He took his daughter back with him  to England, duly came into possession of the estate, and tried to white-wash  his character with society. His reputation, however, was too unsavoury for  anyone to have anything to do with him, so in a rage he returned to his old  ways and outdid in infamy all his previous life. No one was cruel enough to  enlighten his daughter, whom he had left in seclusion at the family seat, and  she remained quite ignorant of her father&rsquo;s conduct, which was a good thing for  her peace of mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  some years Mostyn, defying God and man, pursued his evil career, but at length  Nature, generous in lending but cruel in exacting, demanded back all she had  lent, and he was struck down in the full tide of his evil prosperity by a  stroke of paralysis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Served  him jolly well right,&rdquo; observed Otterburn heartily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  everybody thought. Well, he was taken down to his country house, and there for  four terrible years Alizon Mostyn devoted herself to nursing him. What that  poor girl suffered during those four years no one knows nor ever will know, for  despite the blow which had fallen on him, Gabriel Mostyn was as wicked as ever,  and I believe his curses and blasphemy against his punishment were something  awful. No one ever came to see him but the doctors, although I was told a  clergyman did attempt to make some enquiries after his soul, but retreated in  dismay before the foul language used by the old reprobate. His daughter put up  with all this, and in spite of the persuasions of her friends, who tried to  take her away from that terrible bed-side, she attended him to the end with  devoted affection. She saw him die, and from all accounts his death-bed was  enough to have given her the horrors for the rest of her life, for only his  lower extremities being paralysed, they said he tore the bedclothes to ribbons  in his last paroxysm, cursing like a fiend the whole time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did she stay through it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  till the breath was out of his wicked old body. I believe his last breath was a  curse, and just before he died it took two men to hold him down by main force  in the bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  heavens! how awful,&rdquo; ejaculated Otterburn in a shocked tone; &ldquo;what a terrible  scene for that poor girl to witness&mdash;and afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  afterwards she came up to London,&rdquo; replied Gartney, after a pause; &ldquo;the old man  had got rid of all the property, and even the Hall was so heavily mortgaged that  it had to be sold. She stayed with some relatives, and there was some talk of  her becoming a Sister of Mercy. I dare say she would have done so, her vocation  evidently being in the Florence Nightingale line, had she not met with my  cousin Errington, who fell in love with her, and three months ago married her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curious  history,&rdquo; commented Angus idly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder she looks older than she is,  after coming through all that misery, but I hope she doesn&rsquo;t make her past life  a text upon which to prose about religion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t think she does. I have been told she is somewhat serious, but a  charming woman to talk to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the sort of woman likely to be attracted by a sporting blade like Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gartney  held his peace at this remark and looked thoughtfully at his cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she love him?&rdquo; asked the Master, noticing the silence of his companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she love him?&rdquo; replied Gartney, meditatively. &ldquo;I hardly know. Guy isn&rsquo;t a bad  sort of fellow as men go, he&rsquo;s a straightforward, athletic, stupid young  Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Married  to a saint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I assure you he admires and loves the saint immensely, judging from his  enthusiastic letters to me about her perfections. She is fair to look on, she  is a thoroughly pure, good woman, and will, without doubt, make an excellent  mother. What more can a man desire?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid you&rsquo;d desire a good deal more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  but then you see I&rsquo;m not a man, but a combination of circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?  It is rather difficult of comprehension, I admit. What I mean is, that the  circumstances of my having been an orphan of my bringing up, my command of  money, and above all the circumstances of the age I live in, have all made me  the curious creature I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! you admit then that you are curious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  much so that I doubt if any woman in existence would satisfy me as a companion  for more than a few days. A fast woman irritates me, a clever woman enrages me,  and a good one bores me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Lady Errington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  happier with her stupid adoring husband than she would be with a bundle of  contradictions like myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she does not love this stupid adoring husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said that,&rdquo; observed Eustace hastily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in words, certainly, but you hinted&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hinted nothing, because I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;how can I be when I tell you I don&rsquo;t know  Lady Errington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  appear to have studied her pretty closely at all events.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  mere whim on my part, I assure you; besides, Guy has written to me about his  wife, and I&mdash;well I&rsquo;ve gathered a lot of nonsensical ideas from his letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  there is a possibility that she does not love him,&rdquo; persisted Otterburn, a  trifle maliciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  annoying you are, Macjean,&rdquo; said Eustace in a vexed tone. &ldquo;Of course there are  always possibilities. In this case, however, I can only refer you to Heine, &lsquo;There  is always one who loves and one who is loved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn  saw that Eustace was rather annoyed at his persistency, so did not press the  point, but contented himself with observing:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I think I know Lady Errington&rsquo;s character pretty well by this time. She is a  charming woman with a bad history, a serious face, and a wifely regard for an  adoring husband. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  yes&mdash;to a certain extent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,  all this does not explain the whole of your incomplete Madonna phrase. Tell me  exactly what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  thought for a moment, and then began to speak in his slow languid voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Last  time I was in Italy,&rdquo; he said dreamily, &ldquo;I one day strolled into a village  church built on the side of a hill above the blue waters of a still lake.  Outside it was a hot, brilliant day, something like this, but within all was  coolness and dim twilight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  a side altar tall candles glimmered before a shrine of the Virgin, and cast  their pale glow on a large picture of the Madonna which was hanging upon the  wall of the chapel. I don&rsquo;t know the name of the artist who painted the figure,  but it made a great impression upon me. I&rsquo;m afraid I was impressionable in  those days. We all lose our finer feelings as the years go by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the painter had depicted the Mother standing alone, with sombre clouds beneath  her white feet, her hands, long and pale, folded across her breast, and her  face with a yearning expression lifted to a ray of light from the mystic dove  of the Holy Ghost, which pierced the darkness of the sky. There was no infant  Jesus in her arms, such as we generally see in altar-pieces, and I fancy the  idea of the artist was to depict Mary as a pure solitary woman, before the  announcement of the Conception. In her eyes, sad and deep, dwelt an expression  of intense yearning, and on her beautiful face the look of a woman longing for  the pleasures of maternity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never forgot the hopeless craving of that gaze, the hungry longing for the  fondling arms and inarticulate cries of a child. Only once have I seen such a  look on a human countenance, and that was on Lady Errington&rsquo;s before her  marriage; she had the same hungry look in her eyes which can only be appeased  by the birth of a child, and which will give her that special love and  affection needed to complete her life. Therefore I call her an incomplete  Madonna, for when she becomes a mother that yearning gaze will pass away for  ever, and be succeeded by the serene beatitude that painters give the face of  the Virgin when she clasps the child Jesus to her breast, encircled by the  adoring hosts of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a very poetical interpretation of a picture,&rdquo; said Otterburn when Eustace  had ended. &ldquo;I doubt however if I should draw the same conclusions were I to see  the picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not see the picture I refer to but you will meet Lady Errington, then you  can give me your opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid it will not coincide with yours. But if all her love is thus centred on  the coming of a child, when it is born she will love it passionately to the  exclusion of her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo;  replied Eustace calmly. &ldquo;However we shall see. It is a curious study of a woman&rsquo;s  character, and I am anxious to see if my idea is a correct one. Of this,  however, I am certain, that the day a child is born to Alizon Errington will be  a sad day for her husband if he worships her over much, for he will have to be  satisfied with the crumbs of love that fall from the child&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  that is one of those things yet to be proved,&rdquo; said Otterburn rising, as the  train, approaching Chiasso, slowed gradually down. &ldquo;But here we are at the end  of our journey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  which the Lord be thanked,&rdquo; replied Eustace, and jumped out on to the platform.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    The Waning Of The Honeymoon</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Ah,  love how quickly fades the rose,<br>
    When after sunshine come the snows,<br>
    So joys may change to cruel woes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thro&rsquo;  Cupid&rsquo;s treason.<br>
    But roses will their bloom renew,<br>
    And snows fall not from heavens blue,<br>
    So hearts like ours will still be true,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through every season.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  certainly would be difficult to find a more charming residence than the Villa  Tagni. Standing on the extreme verge of a low rocky promontory, which ran out  some distance into the tideless waters of Lake Como, it appeared like some  fairy palace as it nestled amid the cool green of its surrounding trees and reflected  its delicately ornate fa&ccedil;ade in the still mirror of the water.</p>
  <p>Like  most Italian houses it had a somewhat theatrical appearance, with its bright  pink-coloured walls and vividly green shutters, set in broad frames of  snow-white stone. Then again, these walls being decorated with arabesque  designs in various brilliant tints, the general effect at a distance was that  of cunningly wrought mosaic, while above this bizarre combination of colours  sloped the roof of dull-hued red tiles; the picturesque whole standing out in  glowing relief from the emerald background of heavily-foliaged trees of ilex,  tamarisk, chestnut and cypress. High above towered a great mountain, with its  grey scarred peak showing suddenly through its green forests against the clear  blue of an Italian sky. More than half-way down, the highway ran along the  slope like a sinuous white serpent, and below nestled the villa by the water&rsquo;s  edge. Bright, fanciful, jewel-like, it was the very realization of a poet&rsquo;s  dream, the magic outcome of some Oriental phantasy, such as we read of in those  strange Arabian tales where the genii rear visionary palaces under the powerful  spells of Solomon ben Daoud.</p>
  <p>A  broad stone terrace ran along the front of the villa, on to which admission was  given from the house by wide French windows, generally masked by their venetian  shutters, which excluded the glare of the sun from the inner apartments. A  double flight of steps descended from this terrace sheer into the cool water  upon which floated the graceful pleasure boat belonging to the villa, and on  either side grew dense masses of sycamore, fir, oak and laurel sloping down to  the verge of the lake, their uniform tints broken at intervals by the pale grey  foliage of olive trees. Radiant in the sunlight glowed the rosy blossoms of the  oleander, sudden amid the shadow flashed the golden trails of drooping  laburnams&mdash;here, like the fabled fruit of Hesperides, hung golden oranges, there  the pallid yellow ovals of scented lemons, and deep in the faint twilight of  glossy leaves glimmered the warm white blossoms of the magnolia tree, ivory  censers from whence breathed those voluptuous perfumes which confuse the brain  like the fumes of opium smoke.</p>
  <p>And  then the flowers! Surely this was the paradise of flowers, which here grew in a  prodigal profusion unknown in the carefully-cultured gardens of chill northern  lands where the fruitful footsteps of Flora pause but a moment. In this  favoured clime, however, the goddess ever remains, and adorns her resting place  with lavish bounty of her fast-fading treasures.</p>
  <p>Here  deeply-flushed roses scattered their showers of fragrant leaves, yonder bloomed  the pale amethystine heliotrope, fiercely amid the verdure burned the scarlet  blossoms of the geranium, and, in secluded corners, slender virginal lilies  hinted at the pale mysticism of the cloister, while red anemones, grey-green  rosemary, blue violets, still bluer gentian, many-tinted azaleas, snowy  asphodels, and yellow hawkweeds all grew together in a confused mass of  brilliant colours, and every vagrant wind ruffling the still surface of the  lake sent a rich breath of fragrance through the drowsy air. Over all, the deep  azure of the cloudless sky, from whence shone the fierce sun on the lofty  encircling mountains, the arid plains, the clustering villages huddled round  the slender white <i>campanili</i> of their churches, the glittering waters of  the lake, the brightly coloured villas, and on the brilliant profusion of  flowers which almost hid the teeming bosom of the green earth in this garden of  the world.</p>
  <p>It  was late in the afternoon, and the cool breeze of the coming night was already  commencing to make its welcome presence felt, when Guy Errington and his wife,  the present occupants of Villa Tagni, came out on to the terrace to enjoy this  most delightful hour of the Italian day. The servants arranged some Turkish  rugs on the tesselated pavement, placed thereon three or four comfortable  lounging chairs of wicker work, and set forth a small round table, on the white  cloth of which stood a tea service, with a small silver kettle hissing merrily  over a spirit lamp, some plates of cake and fruit, a few tall thin-stemmed  glasses, and a straw-covered flask of red Chianti wine.</p>
  <p>These  arrangements being completed they retired, and Lady Errington making her appearance  sat down in one of the chairs, while Sir Guy, looking cool and comfortable in  his white flannels, perched himself perilously on the balustrade of the terrace  with a cigarette between his lips. And surely nothing could be more charming  than this peaceful scene, with the exquisite view of the lake, the fragrant  coolness of the breeze, the romantic-looking terrace, the pleasant evidence of  hospitality, and this young Adam and Eve to give life to the whole.</p>
  <p>Aged  twenty-eight, with a sunburnt face, a fair moustache, merry blue eyes and a  stalwart figure, Sir Guy was certainly a very handsome young man, the very type  of a well-born, well-bred Englishman, and a greater contrast to his lusty  physique could hardly have been found than that of his wife, with her fragile  frame, her pale serious face, and smooth coils of lustrous golden hair. In her  loose tea-gown of dead white Chinese silk unrelieved by any tint, she looked  almost as wan and colourless as the perfumed knot of snowy lilies at her  breast, and the great fan of white ostrich feathers she wielded in her slender  hand was rivalled by the pallor of her face. The dreaming look in her calm,  blue eyes, the slight droop of the thin red lips which gave a touch of sadness  to her mobile mouth, and the exquisite transparency of her complexion, all  added to the fragile look of this fair pale woman, whose spirituality was  enhanced by the faint shadows which now began to fill the warm air.</p>
  <p>Guy  Errington, sturdy and practical, did not as a rule indulge in any fanciful  musings, but something in the peculiar delicacy of her expression seemed to  strike him suddenly, and throwing away his cigarette he bent over his pale wife  with an air of the utmost solicitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you have not felt the heat too much, dear,&rdquo; he said, anxiously touching  the faint rose tint of her cheek with a gentle finger, &ldquo;you look as white as a  ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington smiled languidly and put her fan up to her lips with a low laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid I must be a very deceptive person,&rdquo; she replied lightly, &ldquo;for I feel  perfectly well. I am always pale, and I obtain a great deal of undeserved  sympathy under false pretences.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mind my smoking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in the least. Why did you throw away your cigarette?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought it annoyed you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  wife looked at him with a slightly mocking smile on her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if you will always be so ready to sacrifice your pleasures to my  unexpressed desires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always!  always!&rdquo; replied Guy fervently, kneeling beside her chair. &ldquo;Your slightest wish  will always be my law, Alizon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till  the honeymoon is over, I suppose,&rdquo; said Alizon a trifle sadly, as she passed  her fingers through his hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid the honeymoon is over&mdash;in the eyes of the world at least,&rdquo; responded  Errington ruefully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been three months married, you know, and to-day is  our last one of solitude, for Eustace and his friend will soon be here&mdash;are you  sorry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, very sorry,&rdquo; she replied, indifferently, suppressing a yawn; &ldquo;these last  three months have been charming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Errington  looked slightly disappointed at her lack of fervour, and to make up for it  commenced to vehemently declare that he did not want to see anyone, that he  could live for the next century with her alone, she was all the world to him,  the one thing he lived for, etc., etc. in fact gave glib utterance to all the  fond rhapsodies which constantly pour from the mouths of adoring lovers and  newly-married men.</p>
  <p>Kneeling  beside her, his face glowing with passionate feeling and his blue eyes fixed  adoringly on the face of his divinity, Guy Errington looked gallant, handsome  and fervid enough to have satisfied the most exacting woman. Yet, strange to  say, for some inexplicable reason, this wife of three months appeared slightly  bored by his erotic enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the pearl of husbands, my dear Guy,&rdquo; she observed idly when he ceased his  protestations, &ldquo;but confess now, on your knees as you are, that you feel a  trifle weary of this perfect bliss&mdash;this society of two&mdash;and long for your dogs,  your horses, and your coverts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this accurate divination of his real feelings, Errington looked somewhat  disconcerted, for despite the ardour of his protestations he did feel slightly  weary of this monotonous tranquillity, and in his secret heart longed for the  things she mentioned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you know I&rsquo;m not a bit romantic,&rdquo; he said apologetically, as if he were  confessing to some crime, &ldquo;and I am a little tired of churches and pictures.  Besides, I am anxious for you to see the Hall, and there&rsquo;s such a lot of things  to be looked after, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this is somewhere about the twelfth of August,&rdquo; said Lady Errington slyly,  cutting short his excuses, whereat he laughed in a somewhat embarrassed manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you&rsquo;ve found me out,&rdquo; he observed with a smile. &ldquo;Well, yes, dear, I confess it  is true, I was thinking about the coverts&mdash;it ought to be a good year for the  birds. Besides there are the stables, you know. I am going to get a new hunter  for next season. Baffles tells me there&rsquo;s a good one to be picked up&mdash;belongs to  some Major Griff or Groff&mdash;don&rsquo;t know the name&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got my eye&mdash;Good  gracious, Alizon,&rdquo; he added, breaking off&mdash;&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  nothing!&rdquo; she replied, trying to smile although she looked singularly  disturbed, &ldquo;only that name you mentioned, Major Griff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  what about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  at all&mdash;only he was&mdash;I believe, a friend of my father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  don&rsquo;t trouble your head about those things, dear, all that sort of thing is  past and done with,&rdquo; said Guy fondly, who knew what she had suffered at the  hands of her father, &ldquo;your life will be all sunshine&mdash;if I can make it so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alizon  bent forward and kissed him tenderly on the forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a good, dear fellow, Guy,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;and if I do sometimes remember the  bitterness of the past, I always thank God for the sweetness of the present,  and for the husband He has given me. We will go back to Errington Hall whenever  you like. I am anxious to see our home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  last phrase sounded delightful to the ears of Guy, and in a sudden access of  tenderness he bent his head and kissed the cool slim hand which lay so  confidingly in his own. Alizon&rsquo;s momentary fit of emotion being past, she  withdrew her hand with a slight laugh at his action.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  foolish you are, Guy,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;you must have graduated at the court of  Versailles, but do something more sensible and tell me all about the Hall, so  that I may not be too ignorant on my arrival.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had done so hundreds of times before, but the recital never lost its charm for  him, and he thereupon entered into a long and minute description of his  ancestral home with the greatest zest. He described the quaint old building  where so many generations of Erringtons had been born, lived and died, the  well-timbered park with its mighty oaks, ferny glades and ancient beech-trees,  the shooting, which was said to be the best in the county, the characteristics  of the different people who lived around, to all of which Alizon listened with  praiseworthy attention, although truth to tell her thoughts were far away and  she was in her own mind contrasting this gallant, tender husband, with her  selfish, vicious father.</p>
  <p>Gabriel  Mostyn had been a thorough Bohemian in every way, regarding the world at large  as his special property, and always at home wherever he chose to pitch his  tent. Some unknown strain of gipsy blood which had been in abeyance for several  generations, had suddenly developed in him with overpowering force, and  impelled him to restless wanderings which he was quite unable to withstand. The  semi-barbaric life of Russia had been as well-known to him as the refined  civilization of London, and it was all the same to him whether he wintered at  Rome, passed the summer in Norway, or explored the wild recesses of the Andes.  Owing to this indulgence of his nomadic instincts he had developed within  himself all the vices inseparable from such a primeval existence, and became a  man accustomed to exist by the law of might against right, taking as his own  whatever came to his hand, preying on the weaknesses of his fellow creatures,  and binding himself by no law of honour or kindness so long as his own selfish  desires were gratified.</p>
  <p>With  such a father it was hardly to be wondered at that Alizon had small respect for  the masculine sex, and, foolishly no doubt, judged everyone else by the only  standard she had known. During those four terrible years when her father had  been dying inch by inch, and disputing every inch with the inexorable Angel of  Death, she had learned a great deal of his previous existence, and the  knowledge of such a foul life had appalled her gentle soul. The idea of  marriage with a man resembling her father even in the most distant manner was  repellent to all her ideas, and she certainly would never have become the wife  of Guy Errington, had not her position with her relatives been made so disagreeable  in every way that with many misgivings she consented to marry a possible  Caliban.</p>
  <p>To  her surprise, however, she was agreeably disappointed in finding in her husband  a straightforward, honourable man, with the truest instincts of a gentleman. He  did not pass his life like a modern Cain in restless wanderings round the  world, at war with society and shunned by all as an outcast, a pariah, a leper,  beyond the pale of human love and companionship. No, he loved his birth-place,  his position, his good name, and knew that he had duties to fulfil in life,  both towards himself, his friends and his tenants. Remembering the vices of her  father, Errington&rsquo;s every-day virtues seemed those of an angel, and although  she did not love him when she became his wife, yet it was possible that love  might be born of genuine admiration and respect, and subsequently develop into  the stronger passion.</p>
  <p>At  present, however, she had not got beyond her first stage of surprise, but  simply admired, respected, and honoured Errington as a man possessed of a just,  kind, straightforward nature, and who was anxious to make her happy by every  means in his power. There have been worse marriages than this consisting of  love on one side and admiration of good qualities on the other, therefore Guy had  every prospect of being happy in such a union as he deserved to be by his  inherent good qualities and his honourable desire to do right in every way.</p>
  <p>While  Alizon was letting her thoughts run on in this fashion, Guy had become so  excited in his narration concerning Errington Hall and their future life of  happiness, that he had risen to his feet, and was now striding up and down the  terrace giving full reins to his imagination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  have an awfully jolly time of it,&rdquo; he said blithely, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll soon forget  all your past worries in looking after things; there&rsquo;s everything to make life  happy at the Hall, only I do wish there was a little more money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money&rsquo;s  the root of all evil,&rdquo; observed Alizon smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the want of it&rsquo;s the whole tree,&rdquo; retorted Guy, laughing at his own mild  witticism. &ldquo;You see, my father hadn&rsquo;t much idea about things, and muddled a  good deal, so the consequence is that there is a mortgage on the estate which I  must pay off, so we&rsquo;ll have to live quietly for some years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I do. I&rsquo;m not going to have you waste your sweetness on the desert air,&rdquo;  replied Errington vehemently, &ldquo;but at present I don&rsquo;t see how it can be helped.  I need a large sum of ready money, but won&rsquo;t get it, unless&mdash;unless Aunt Jelly  dies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think that probable,&rdquo; said Alizon lightly, &ldquo;Miss Corbin looks strong  enough to outlive Methusaleh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I daresay she will, the tough old party, but if she does die I&rsquo;m sure to come  in for her money unless she leaves it to Eustace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  why shouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  in the first place she doesn&rsquo;t like him as much as she does me, and in the  second he&rsquo;s got lots of money already, and no wife to support.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky  man,&rdquo; observed Lady Errington mischievously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky  woman to have escaped him, you mean,&rdquo; retorted Guy sagely; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the most  exacting man you ever met.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  never met him to speak to, but I do know him by sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that&rsquo;s quite enough. He&rsquo;s such a fastidious chap&mdash;an angel out of Heaven wouldn&rsquo;t  satisfy him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  not. I don&rsquo;t think angels are desirable wives as a rule.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes they are, dear,&rdquo; said Errington fondly, pausing near her, &ldquo;you are an  angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very prosaic angel, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  enough for me anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that rather a doubtful compliment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think so? Well, now I come to think of it, perhaps it is a little doubtful.  But I haven&rsquo;t got the gift of tongues like Eustace; you should hear him talk,  Alizon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  his talk is like his books I don&rsquo;t think I shall like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!&mdash;why  not? I haven&rsquo;t read them, but I hear they&rsquo;re deuced clever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  much so, cynical and bitter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just like his own character. Eustace is the most pessimistic man I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  certain I shall not like him,&rdquo; asserted Lady Errington calmly.</p>
  <p>Her  husband chuckled a little before replying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be too sure of that. Eustace is a very fascinating sort of man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  so than you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;m not fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  very modest, at all events.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think so? Wait till you hear me tell shooting stories about my prowess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that your special weakness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means&mdash;you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you for a very pretty compliment, but I&rsquo;m afraid this conversation is becoming  frivolous,&rdquo; said Alizon, with a faint pink colour creeping into the pallor of  her cheeks, &ldquo;however, it&rsquo;s ended now, for here come your friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  late than never,&rdquo; remarked Guy, turning round to salute his cousin, who  advanced along the terrace, followed by Otterburn. &ldquo;How do you do, Eustace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  well, thank you Guy,&rdquo; replied Eustace, gravely shaking hands. &ldquo;This is Mr.  Macjean&mdash;my cousin, Sir Guy Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad  to see you, Mr. Macjean,&rdquo; said Errington bluffly, &ldquo;and now let me introduce  both you gentlemen to my wife, Lady Errington. Alizon, this is my cousin  Eustace and Mr. Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington bowed with a charming smile, and the whole party, sitting down,  proceeded to make themselves comfortable.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    The Art Of Conversation</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  difficult to hold a conversation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With three or five, odd numbers are a bore,<br>
    For some one&rsquo;s sure to be <i>sans</i> occupation,<br>
    So talk should always be &lsquo;twixt two or four.<br>
    One can&rsquo;t gain any secret information,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there should be a single person more:<br>
    But four&rsquo;s a pleasant number without doubt,<br>
Because there&rsquo;s not a chance to be the &lsquo;odd man out.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was certainly a very pleasant little party which was seated on the terrace of  the Villa Tagni, talking social nonsense under the clear glow of the sunset  sky. Behind the solemn hills the sun had disappeared, leaving the sky filled  with soft rosy tints, against which the serrated outline of tall peaks stood  clear and distinct. Slender clouds of liquid gold floated in the roseate  western sky which resembled in its pale flushing the delicate tints of a  rose-heart, softening off by degrees into a cold blue, which in its turn gave  place towards the darkening east to faint shadows and throbbing stars  glimmering in the aerial gloom of coming night.</p>
  <p>But  the four people on the terrace took no notice of the wonderful gradations of  colour, but chatted gaily over the cakes and tea provided by the hospitality of  Villa Tagni. All the gentlemen, tired of the thin wines of Italy, had taken  tea, and Otterburn was especially enthusiastic as he drained his cup with keen  relish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a perfect old woman for tea here,&rdquo; he said, handing back his cup for a second  supply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, as I never bothered much about it at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  because you can&rsquo;t get a decent cup here,&rdquo; observed Eustace drily, &ldquo;man always  longs for the impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  long for a decent dinner,&rdquo; retorted Otterburn with a hollow groan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a  particularly greedy sort of chap&mdash;don&rsquo;t laugh, please, Lady Errington, I assure  you I&rsquo;m not&mdash;but these Italians haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea how to cook.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  you see their ideas of cooking differ from yours, Mr. Macjean,&rdquo; said Alizon,  smilingly handing him back his cup.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s true enough. I daresay they give a fellow the best they can, but look at  their victuals; bread that&rsquo;s all full of holes, some yellow mess they call  polenta, skinny chickens and sour wine, you can&rsquo;t make a square meal of such  stuff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  people could,&rdquo; said Errington, who was listening to the boy&rsquo;s remarks with an  amused smile, &ldquo;but I agree with you about the roast beef of old England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  the wholesome parritch of Scotland,&rdquo; observed Eustace satirically. &ldquo;As a North  Briton you surely forget that, Master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Macjean. &ldquo;I got too much of that when I was young.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Being  so aged now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that shabby?&rdquo; said Otterburn good-humouredly, turning to Lady Errington. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s  always making fun of my age&mdash;as if youth were a crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a very charming crime at all events,&rdquo; replied Alizon pleasantly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you  mind Mr. Gartney, he is a poet, and poets are always praising&mdash;and envying&mdash;youth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true enough,&rdquo; said Eustace with a sigh, &ldquo;all the poets from Mimnurmus downward  have ever lamented the passing of youth. What a pity we can&rsquo;t always remain  young.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why not? I don&rsquo;t count age by years, but by experience,&rdquo; said Lady Errington  quietly. &ldquo;One may be old at twenty and young at fifty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace,  knowing what her experience had been, looked curiously at her fair placid face  as she said this, and she must have guessed his thoughts, for a flush burned in  her cheeks under his searching gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I say,&rdquo; cried Guy, referring to his wife&rsquo;s remark. &ldquo;If a fellow&rsquo;s got  health, wealth and a good temper, the world&rsquo;s a very jolly sort of place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  best of all possible worlds, according to Voltaire,&rdquo; remarked Eustace, leaning  back with a disbelieving smile, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve left out one ingredient which some  people consider very necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  I&rsquo;ve got that,&rdquo; said Guy turning a fond eye on his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky  man, other people are not so fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  observed Otterburn with a huge sigh, having finished a very decent meal, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  so difficult to procure the genuine article.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark  to the cynic of one-and-twenty,&rdquo; cried Gartney.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  your example, Eustace,&rdquo; observed Guy, producing a cigarette case, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t  for Heaven&rsquo;s sake start a philosophical discussion on happiness. Why should the  children of the king go mourning when the soothing weed is within reach? Have a  cigarette, Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you&mdash;if Lady Errington&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I do not mind. Guy has habituated me to smoke. Light your cigarettes by all  means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon  Otterburn accepted the small roll of paper and tobacco with much satisfaction,  and was soon puffing away contentedly, Guy following his example.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  are jolly good cigarettes,&rdquo; he said emphatically. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get decent tobacco  in Italy, so I smuggled these past the Customs at Chiasso. I suppose it&rsquo;s no  use offering you one, Eustace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in the least,&rdquo; responded Gartney smiling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity to spoil this perfect  fragrance with tobacco smoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s so like you poets&mdash;always sacrificing the comforts of life for the sake  of its illusions. Well, we won&rsquo;t spoil your esthetic feelings on the subject,  Come, Macjean, let us leave these two to continue the conversation, and we&rsquo;ll  walk up and down till we finish our smoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Angus  glanced enquiringly at Lady Errington, who smilingly gave the requisite  permission, and was soon strolling up and down the terrace with Errington,  talking sport, upon which subject both gentlemen were quite in accordance.</p>
  <p>Left  alone with Lady Errington, Eustace lay back in his deep chair gazing dreamily at  her as she sat silent and pensive, fanning herself slowly with an absent  expression in her blue eyes.</p>
  <p>The  charm of the scene, the influence of the hour, the presence of this pale,  beautiful woman, and the delicate fragrance of the flowers which permeated the  still air, all touched the poetical part of his nature, and he could not help  wondering in his own mind how such a spiritual nature as that of Alizon  Errington&rsquo;s could tolerate such a matter-of-fact man as her husband, who could  leave her so calmly to talk sport with a shallow-minded boy. In this, however,  Eustace Gartney was entirely wrong, as love is not to be measured by  sentimental talk or silent adoration, and a man who loves a woman in an honest  respectful fashion does not need to be constantly on his knees to prove the  sincerity of his passion. But then Eustace, who believed in this exaggerated  fashion of love-making, was a poet, and poets have whimsical ways of  manifesting their sentiments.</p>
  <p>From  these musings he was aroused by the voice of his hostess, who had suddenly  awakened to the fact that Eustace was silent, and feared she had neglected her  social duties.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are singularly silent, Mr. Gartney!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  started suddenly as her voice struck on his ear, and looked idly at her with a  vague smile on his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  influence of the hour and the scene, I suppose,&rdquo; he said idly; &ldquo;one is always  silent in Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think that depended upon the absence or presence of Eve,&rdquo; replied Alizon  demurely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  of the serpent. Confess now, Lady Errington, the serpent was a charming  conversationalist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a bad companion&mdash;for a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt Adam thought so&mdash;after the Fall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a pity there should have been a Fall,&rdquo; said Lady Errington after a short pause.  &ldquo;It would have been a charming world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  consisting of what the French call a <i>solitude &agrave; deux</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but I was supposing the Garden of Eden became populated. It would have been a  world without sin or temptation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon. The trees of knowledge and life would still have been  flourishing to tempt the primeval population nor do I suppose the wily serpent  would have been wanting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Satirical,  but scarcely true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but you see we&rsquo;re both talking the romance of what-might-have-been,&rdquo; said  Gartney smiling, &ldquo;so my view of the subject is no doubt as probable as your  own. However this Italian Paradise with all its faults, consequent on our  present-day civilization, has exquisite scenery, and if one were to live here  for some years I daresay he would arrive at the nearest approach to primeval  happiness possible in this world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid we shall not have an opportunity of testing the truth of your assertion.  We leave here in a fortnight, for Guy is longing for England and the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  nostalgia of the coverts, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly!  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day, let us go and kill something.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  laughed at this reply, as the neatness of it satisfied his somewhat cynical  sense of humour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you feel nostalgia yourself, Mr. Gartney?&rdquo; asked Lady Errington, arranging the  lilies at her breast.</p>
  <p>He  turned his expressive face towards her with a sad smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  of this earth! I am like Heine, <i>un enfant perdu</i>, and have a  home-sickness for an impossible world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Created  by your own fancy no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Though I dare say if my fancy world became a real one it wouldn&rsquo;t be so  pleasant as this one. After all, Chance is the most admirable architect of the  future. When men like Sir Thomas More, Plato, Bulwer Lytton and the rest of  them, have indulged in paper dreams of ideal worlds, they have always committed  the fatal mistake of making the inhabitants insufferable bores, who have  attained perfection&mdash;and when perfection is attained happiness ceases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the greatest pleasure in life is work, and when perfection renders work  unnecessary, life becomes a lotos-eating existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  surely that is a very pleasant thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the few Yes, to the many No! Some men need constant excitement to make them  enjoy life. I can quite understand Xerxes offering a reward to the man who  could invent a new pleasure, for if Xerxes had not attained the perfection of  debauchery, he would not have found existence a bore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can hardly call such an ignoble height perfection,&rdquo; said Lady Errington  quietly. &ldquo;I should call it satiety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt you are right. But what does it matter what we call it? the thing is the  same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  sounds as if you spoke from experience, and at your age that can hardly be the  case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember,&rdquo; observed Eustace a trifle satirically, &ldquo;that a short time ago you  said you measured youth by experience not by age. It is the same with me, I am  only thirty eight years of age, yet in that short time I have exhausted all  that life has to give.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  Gartney laughed in a dreary, hopeless manner that showed how truly he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid it is,&rdquo; he remarked with a sigh. &ldquo;I have been all over the world and  seen what is to be seen. I have mixed with my fellow creatures and found the  majority of them humbugs. I&rsquo;ve been in love and been deceived. I&rsquo;ve published  books and been abused, in fact I&rsquo;ve done everything possible to enjoy life, and  the consequence is I&rsquo;m sick of the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  own fault entirely,&rdquo; said Lady Errington warmly, &ldquo;as you have denied yourself  nothing you now reap the reward of such indulgence and enjoy nothing. Your  present satiety is the logical sequence of your own acts. Why not therefore try  and lead a nobler and better life? Go among the poor and give them the help  they so much need. Look upon your fortune as money entrusted to you, not to  squander on unsatisfying pleasures, but to use for the benefit of humanity. Do  this, Mr. Gartney, and I assure you the result will be satisfactory, for you  will find in such well-doing the new pleasure which Xerxes desired but never  obtained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a sceptical smile on his massive features Eustace listened to her earnest  speech, and at its conclusion laughed softly in his own cynical manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  most delightful view of one&rsquo;s duties to the world at large,&rdquo; he said  satirically, &ldquo;but hardly satisfactory. That recipe for happiness has been given  to me before, Lady Errington, and is, I think, more charming in theory than in  practice. Suppose I did take this advice you give me in the goodness of your  heart, and went out into the world to play the thankless part of a philanthropist,  what would I gain&mdash;only a more intimate knowledge of human selfishness and human  iniquity. If I assisted A, a most deserving person from his own point of view,  I&rsquo;ve no doubt A would become my bitterest enemy because I had not done enough  for him. I might rescue B from the workhouse, and B would consider me shabby if  I did not support him for the rest of his natural life. As for C, well, I need  not go through the whole alphabet, in order to illustrate my views of the  matter, but I assure you, Lady Errington, if I employed my money in alleviating  the distresses of my fellow creatures, I would get very little praise and a  great deal of blame during my life, and when I died no doubt a short paragraph  in a newspaper as &lsquo;an earnest but misguided philanthropist!&rsquo; No! believe me I  have thought deeply about the whole thing, and the game is not worth the  candle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look at things in a wrong light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the only possible light, I&rsquo;m afraid. Rose-coloured spectacles are not  obtainable now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still  such a pessimistic view&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  forced upon us by circumstances. This is the nineteenth century, you know, and  we have no illusions left&mdash;they went out with religion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I must try and convince you of the falsity of your views some other time,&rdquo; said  Alizon closing her fan with a sigh, &ldquo;but at present I see Guy and Mr. Macjean  are coming to interrupt our conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  rose to her feet as she spoke, a tall, slim, white figure, that seemed to sway  like a graceful lily at the breath of the evening breeze. Eustace, ever prone  to poetical impressions, made this comparison in his own mind as he left his  chair and advanced with her to meet Guy and Angus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say Alizon,&rdquo; cried Errington gaily as his wife came up, &ldquo;just fancy! Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s  ward, Miss Sheldon, is staying at the Villa Medici.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Sheldon,&rdquo; said Lady Errington reflectively, &ldquo;is that the pretty girl I met at  Miss Corbin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  you remember. On the day we went to see Aunt Jelly and ask her blessing,&rdquo;  replied Guy eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is she with?&rdquo; asked Lady Errington; &ldquo;surely Miss Corbin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; interrupted Eustace, mirthfully. &ldquo;You might as well expect to meet the  Monument abroad as Aunt Jelly. I asked Miss Sheldon all about it, and it  appears that ever since her arrival from Australia she has been anxious to come  to the Continent, so as a friend of Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s was making what she calls the &lsquo;grand  tower&rsquo; with her husband, this young lady was placed under their mutual  protection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish she was under mine,&rdquo; said Otterburn audibly, on whom the charms of the  young lady in question had evidently made a deep impression, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s so awfully  pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid it would be a case of the blind leading the blind,&rdquo; remarked Eustace  drily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way,&rdquo; observed Guy, &ldquo;who is Miss Sheldon? I asked Aunt Jelly, but she told  me, sharply, to mind my own business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t  that rather severe?&rdquo; said Alizon mildly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  for Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; retorted her husband. &ldquo;Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s a huffy old party, but she&rsquo;s  got a weakness for Eustace, who doesn&rsquo;t object to be sat upon, so perhaps he  knows about this young lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I&rsquo;ve got a hazy idea,&rdquo; assented Eustace leisurely, &ldquo;she comes from the  City of Melbourne, Australia, and her name is Victoria, called after our  gracious Queen, or the Colony, I forget which. Sheldon <i>p&egrave;re</i> was an admirer  of our mutual aunt in the old days when she was flesh and blood instead of  iron. He went out with a broken heart to the Colonies because Aunt Jelly wouldn&rsquo;t  marry him&mdash;fancy any man breaking his heart for such a brazen image! Well, at  all events, he made a large fortune out there, got married, became the father  of one little girl, and then, his life&rsquo;s work being done, died, leaving his  fortune to his daughter Victoria, and his daughter Victoria to dear Aunt Jelly,  who cherishes her for the sake of the one romance of her youth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  cruelly you tell the story,&rdquo; observed Lady Errington in a rather disapproving  tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only seen Miss Corbin once, but I think she&rsquo;s got a kind heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  people are said to have that, who possess nothing else,&rdquo; retorted Eustace  grimly. &ldquo;However, you now know who Victoria Sheldon is, and I won&rsquo;t deny she&rsquo;s  pretty, very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  pretty,&rdquo; echoed Otterburn, with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ought to marry her, Macjean,&rdquo; said Eustace, &ldquo;she has plenty of money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t marry a girl for her money alone,&rdquo; remonstrated Angus indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  take the American advice,&rdquo; said Sir Guy gaily, &ldquo;never marry a girl for money,  but if you do meet a nice girl with any, try and love her as hard as ever you  can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I&rsquo;ll call and see Miss Sheldon,&rdquo; observed Alizon, after a pause, &ldquo;for, as  she is a ward of your Aunt&rsquo;s, I shall very likely see a good deal of her. Are  the people she is with pleasant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;  observed Eustace calmly, &ldquo;depends greatly on individual taste. The Honourable  Henry Trubbles is the most egotistical specimen of misshapen humanity I have  ever met with, and his wife, whom he married for her money, is a modern edition  of Mrs. Malaprop with a dash of Sary Gamp and a flavouring of the Sleeping  Beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a mixed description,&rdquo; said Errington laughing. &ldquo;How does she resemble the  Sleeping Beauty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  in sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make me quite curious to see her,&rdquo; cried Alizon smiling. &ldquo;And if&mdash;well, I won&rsquo;t  promise anything about what I intended yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you intend?&rdquo; asked her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  have a small dinner party, and give Mr. Macjean a real English dinner, but I&rsquo;ll  first see how I like this extraordinary couple, and then&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would be awfully jolly,&rdquo; said Otterburn, whose stock of adjectives was limited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it&rsquo;s &lsquo;awfully&rsquo; late,&rdquo; remarked Eustace, in a tone of rebuke, &ldquo;and we have  just time to get back to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  what they call a dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  better than nothing at all events&mdash;well, goodbye, Lady Errington; thank you for  a pleasant afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  forget your way to the Villa Tagni,&rdquo; said Alizon as she shook hands, and the  two gentlemen, having vowed warmly that they would not, made their adieux,  leaving Sir Guy and his wife alone on the terrace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Alizon,&rdquo; said Errington, jocularly, &ldquo;and what do you think of my cousin,  Eustace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; replied Lady Errington slowly, &ldquo;that he is the most unhappy man I ever  met with in my life.&rdquo;</p>

    An Australian Girl</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Charming,  no doubt, her face is fair.<br>
    As dark as night, her curling hair,<br>
    Her eyes&mdash;two stars, her lips&mdash;a rose,<br>
    Whoever saw a prettier nose?<br>
    Charming indeed,&mdash;but Fate to vex,<br>
    Has given her faults like all her sex,<br>
    Believe me, she&rsquo;s not worth regret,<br>
She&rsquo;ll break your heart, the vain coquette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  a number of charming old romances begin at an inn. Did not M. Gil Blas commence  his adventurous career by being swindled in one? and Don Quixote, blinded by  fanatic chivalry, mistake the inns for medi&aelig;val castles? Tom Jones became  involved in a network of intrigue at a hostelry; the heroes of Dumas invariably  meet their enemies of King and Cardinal at the same place, while Boccaccio  generally brings about the complications of gallant and donzella at some gay  Florentine &ldquo;osteria.&rdquo; Without doubt all the elements of romance are to be found  at these resting places of man and beast; and the most incongruous characters,  the most dissimilar ranks of society&rsquo;s adventurers, gallants, priests, bona  robas and virtuous ladies all pass and repass, enter and exeunt, under the  hospitable signs of inns.</p>
  <p>Birds  of passage rest momentarily at inns before continuing their flight to the four  quarters of the world, and during such rest meet other birds of passage with  sometimes curious results. Mr. A, a gentleman of swallow-like tendencies, on  his way to the warm south, may linger for a night at an hotel where Miss B, due  in some northern latitude, is also resting, with the result that Mr. A will  delay his flight for an indefinite period; nay more, the juxtaposition of the  two may end in A and B both continuing their journey as man and wife, which is  the termination of all romance. Strange that a chance meeting at a place of  public resort should alter two lives, but then life is made up of strange  events, and a good many people date their happiness or misery from an accidental  meeting at an inn.</p>
  <p>Gartney  was letting his thoughts run on in this somewhat whimsical vein, as he smoked  an after dinner cigarette over his coffee on the terrace at Villa Medici.</p>
  <p>Before  him, huge and indistinct, arose the grand fa&ccedil;ade of the hotel, glimmering  whitely in the moonlight, with its innumerable windows, its broad arcade, and  its myriad lamps shining brilliantly on groups of gaily-dressed people who  strolled to and fro amongst the pink-blossomed oleanders, or sat chatting gaily  round small marble-topped tables, where white-cravated waiters, lithe and  active, attended to their wishes.</p>
  <p>Beyond  lay the lake, dark and solemn, under the shadow of the sombre mountains, at  whose base gleamed orange-coloured points of light, telling of the presence of  distant villages, while high above in the cold, blue sky, glowed the yellow orb  of the moon and the glimmering stars. Through the leaves of sycamore, tamarisk,  and magnolia sighed the soft breath of the night-wind, filling the air with  cool odours, and the sound of music, rendered thin and fairy-like by distance,  floated across the still waters from some slow-moving boat.</p>
  <p>An  historic place this Villa Medici, with its palatial halls, its innumerable  chambers, and its stately flights of white-marble steps; for it was here that  the great Emperor intended to rest for a time in his victorious career, an  intention never carried out, although everything was prepared for his  reception, and the hotel guests now dine in the small saloon hung round with  yellow damask stamped with the imperial &lsquo;N&rsquo; and kingly crown.</p>
  <p>Then  again it was here that unhappy Caroline of Brunswick, who became Queen of  England in name only, kept her state as Princess of Wales, and tried to find in  the calm seclusion of Como that peace denied to her in the land of her  adoption. Ah, yes, the Villa Medici is connected with the lives of some great  personages, but now that they all have vanished from the world&rsquo;s stage, whereon  they played some curious parts, the Villa is turned into an hotel, and strangers  from far America, and still further Australia, reside in the many chambers, and  wander with delight through the enchanting gardens which Nature, aided by art,  has made a paradise of beauty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Caroline,&rdquo; murmured Gartney to himself, as he thought of all this, &ldquo;no one has  a good word to say for her, and yet, I daresay, she was a good deal better than  the first gentleman in Europe. It was just as well she died, for George would  never have given her any rights as queen-consort. No doubt she passed some of  her happiest days here, although she always hankered after the forbidden  glories of Windsor and Buckingham Palace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  meditations were interrupted at this point by a gay laugh, and on looking up he  saw Victoria Sheldon coming towards him escorted by the Master of Otterburn,  who was evidently telling her some funny story, judging from the amusement his  conversation seemed to afford her.</p>
  <p>She  was certainly a very pretty girl, one of those feminine beauties who strike the  beholder at first sight with a sense of indescribable charm. A brilliantly  tinted brunette, overflowing with exuberant vitality, she had all the intense  colouring and freshness of a southern rose at that time when the cold rain  draws its perfume strongly forth in the chill morning air.</p>
  <p>Her  eyes, hair, eyebrows and long lashes were dark as night; red as coral the lips,  which when parted showed two rows of pearly teeth; full and soft the round of  the cheeks, and a peach-like skin with a rosy glow of delicate colour under the  velvety surface. She was the modern realization of that vivacious Julia whom  Herrick describes so charmingly in his dainty poems. And as a matter of fact  the skin of this young girl had all the brilliant colouring of the south, no  doubt assimilated by her system under the sultry glow of Australian skies.  Having an excellent figure, dainty hands and feet, with a perfect taste in  dress, and boundless vivacity, there was no doubt that Victoria Sheldon was a  feminine personality eminently attractive to the stronger sex.</p>
  <p>As  to her nature, it was quite in unison with her outward appearance&mdash;bright,  sparkling, vivacious, albeit somewhat shallow, yet not without a certain veneer  of surface knowledge. Eminently womanly, capricious in the extreme, witty,  amusing, tireless, she had one of those attractive natures which charm everyone  in a singularly magnetic fashion. Some men, eccentric in their likings, admire  those semi-masculine women who have missions, support the rights of their sex  on lecture platforms, emulate masculine peculiarities to the best of their  abilities, and pass noisy lives in shrieking aimlessly against the tyranny of  mankind. Those men who approved of such semi-masculine tendencies, certainly  would not have admired the womanly characteristics of Victoria, but the  connoisseur of feminine beauty, the judge of a brilliant personality, and the  appreciator of a witty nature, would each see in her the realisation of an  extremely difficult ideal.</p>
  <p>The  Master, young and rash, was just at that delightful age when every woman  appears a goddess to the uncultured fancy of youth; judge then the effect  produced upon his impressionable nature by this riant vision of strongly  vitalised beauty. He did not even make an attempt at resistance in any way, but  prone as god Dagon on the threshold of his temple, he fell before the powerful  divinity of this young girl, and she produced on him the same effect as Phryne  did on her judges when she displayed the full splendour of her charms in the  Areopagus under the clear blue of Athenian skies. Mactab, severe, ascetic and  self-mortifying, opposed to every form of admiration of the flesh, would have  blushed for the grovelling idolatory of his quondam pupil; but no doubt the  sunny climate of Italy aided in a great measure this worship of Venus, and  Angus Macjean, Master of Otterburn, prostrated himself in abject worship before  this outward manifestation of carnal beauty.</p>
  <p>Eustace  saw this, and was selfishly annoyed thereat, because he had taken a fancy to  Otterburn, and thought that he (Otterburn) should agree with him (Eustace) in  despising the sex feminine, which was foolish in the extreme on the part of  such an acute observer of human nature; but then he was blinded by egotism, and  that vice distorts every vision. Still he could not deny that physically she  was wonderfully pretty, despite his feeling of animosity against her for coming  between himself and his friend. Therefore he admired her greatly from an  &aelig;sthetic point of view, while Victoria, with the keen instinct of a woman,  scented an enemy and neither admired nor liked Eustace the cynic in the  smallest degree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Mr. Macjean,&rdquo; she said in answer to the remonstrances of Angus who wanted  everyone to like his friend as much as he did himself. &ldquo;Your friend is a  pessimist, and I don&rsquo;t like that class of people; they always take a delight in  analysing one&rsquo;s motives, which is disagreeable&mdash;to the person concerned. A  flower is charming, but those who pull it to pieces in order to find out how it  is made&mdash;are not. I don&rsquo;t like analysts&mdash;they destroy one&rsquo;s illusions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  plain-spoken young lady&rsquo;s chaperone was enjoying an after-dinner nap; the Hon.  Henry was talking Irish politics with an Irish M.P., who did not believe in  Home Rule out of contradiction to the rest of his countrymen who did. So Victoria  Sheldon, feeling in a most delightful humour, was chatting gaily with  Otterburn, when they thus chanced on the melancholy Eustace, moralising on the  mutability of human life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  penny for your thoughts, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; said Victoria, pausing before him with a  gay smile on her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re  not worth it,&rdquo; replied Eustace, looking approvingly at the charming girl before  him, in her dainty white dinner dress, with a bunch of vividly scarlet  geraniums at her breast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sell them as bankrupt stock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haw!  haw! haw!&rdquo; from the Master, who was in that pleasant frame of mind when  everything seems to scintillate with wit&mdash;but then it was after dinner, and a  pretty woman was at his elbow. Wine, wit, and feminine influence, really the  worst-tempered man would feel pleasant with such a delightful trinity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Master,&rdquo; said Eustace reprovingly, &ldquo;your mirth is complimentary, but  rather noisy&mdash;will you not be seated, Miss Sheldon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; replied Victoria, sitting down in a chair under the shadow of a myrtle  tree, the light from a distant lamp striking full on her piquant face. &ldquo;I am  rather tired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  walking, or the Master?&rdquo; asked the cynic gruffly.</p>
  <p>She  flashed a brilliant glance on him out of the dusky shadow, and spread her red  feather fan with a grand wave of irresistible coquetry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Macjean,&rdquo; she said lightly as he sank into a chair opposite to her, and leaned  his arms on the cold marble of the table, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,&rdquo;  observed the Master obtusely. &ldquo;Oh, I think the same as you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  remarked Eustace, re-lighting his cigarette, &ldquo;you cannot object to that  diplomatic reply. Do you mind my smoking?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in the least. I hope Mr. Macjean will follow your example.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Macjean was only too happy to so far indulge himself. So the gentlemen sat and  smoked with great enjoyment, while the feminine element of the party smiled  serenely and impartially on both; smiles quite wasted on the misogamistic  Eustace, but then Victoria, with that unerring instinct of coquetry implanted  in every woman&rsquo;s breast, took a delight in behaving thus, simply because she  saw Otterburn admired her. He on his part naturally began to grow jealous, and  being without the self-control habitual to those who live long in society,  would doubtless have shown his irritation very plainly, only Eustace, taking in  at a glance the whole situation, and being by no means agreeable to gratifying  Victoria&rsquo;s love of conquest, arrested the storm at once by beginning to talk  with judicious diplomacy of the first thing that came into his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me,&rdquo; he said, addressing himself to the volatile Victoria, &ldquo;Do you not find our  narrow English life somewhat irksome after the freedom of Australia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so much as you would think,&rdquo; replied Miss Sheldon promptly, &ldquo;for after all  there is a good deal of similarity between home and the colonies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  still call England &lsquo;home,&rsquo; I observe,&rdquo; said Eustace with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  do, because most of the generation who emigrated are still alive, but even now  the term is dying out, and in another fifty years I don&rsquo;t suppose will be in  use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should awfully like to go out to Australia,&rdquo; observed Otterburn languidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sick of civilisation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  don&rsquo;t imagine you leave civilisation behind when you come out to us,&rdquo; retorted  Victoria sharply, with rising colour, &ldquo;that is a mistake many English people  make. They think Australia is like the backwoods of America, but it&rsquo;s nothing  of the sort. Melbourne is just as cultured and wealthy in its own way as  London, with the additional advantage of having a better climate and being  smaller.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think the latter quality an advantage then?&rdquo; asked Gartney with ironical  gravity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should just think so, rather,&rdquo; said Miss Sheldon nodding her head emphatically.  &ldquo;London is a delightful place, I grant, but it&rsquo;s a terrible nuisance visiting  your friends and going out to amusements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have,&rdquo; observed the Master in an authoritative guidebook tone, &ldquo;trains,  tramways, carriages&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  have we&mdash;but even with them it takes a long time to get about London. We can get  from one end of Melbourne to the other in a reasonable time, but it&rsquo;s like an  African exploring expedition to start round London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;London,&rdquo;  remarked Eustace in a judicious manner, &ldquo;is not one but several cities. There  is the West End, which is devoted to wealth and pleasure, the East End, famous  for work and poverty. The City of London proper, noted for its mercantile  enterprise and its stock-broking fraternity, and finally the huge shipping town  which forms the port of the Metropolis. Every person stays in the special city with  which his business is connected, therefore there is no difficulty in getting  about one&rsquo;s own particular local town, which is much smaller in the aggregate  than Melbourne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand all that perfectly,&rdquo; replied Victoria, who had listened attentively,  &ldquo;but suppose you chose to live on the outskirts of London, so as to get a  breath of country air. In that case if you want to go to a theatre you have to  travel for over an hour to get to one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;People  who live as you say, are worshippers of Nature, and go to bed with the sun&mdash;they  don&rsquo;t want the gas and glare of theatres.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  anyone can argue that way,&rdquo; said Victoria disdainfully, &ldquo;so I have nothing to  say in reply. Let us talk of something else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  all means&mdash;the weather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the crops. No! I am not an agriculturist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt  Jelly,&rdquo; suggested Angus wickedly.</p>
  <p>Miss  Sheldon turned towards him with a mirthful smile in her bright eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you know of Aunt Jelly, Mr. Macjean?&rdquo; she asked, putting her fan up to her  lips to hide a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing; absolutely nothing,&rdquo; he replied, with mock humility, &ldquo;beyond the  fact that Gartney and Errington have both mentioned her as an eccentric  character, so I wish to know more about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  he did, his curiosity was not destined to be gratified at that moment, for,  with the whimsical caprice of a woman, Victoria suddenly began to talk on quite  a different subject, suggested by the casual mention of a name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you like Lady Errington?&rdquo; she demanded, looking from one to the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is a very charming woman,&rdquo; said Eustace evasively. &ldquo;She knows you, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Slightly!  I met her at Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s, when she called one day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what is Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s opinion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl laughed, and then, composing her features into a kind of stern severity,  spoke in a harsh, measured voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  what I approve of; limp! washed out, no backbone, but no doubt she&rsquo;ll make Guy  a good wife. Not a hard thing for any woman to do seeing he&rsquo;s an idiot. So was  his father before him, and he did not take after his mother, thank God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  voice is the voice of Miss Sheldon,&rdquo; murmured Eustace, delicately manipulating  a cigarette, &ldquo;but the sentiments are those of my beloved aunt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  mean you are,&rdquo; said Victoria, rewarding Otterburn with a bright look for having  laughed at her mimicry. &ldquo;I thought I did her voice to perfection.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  but a saw-mill could do that,&rdquo; retorted the irreverent Eustace. &ldquo;So that is  Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s opinion. It isn&rsquo;t flattering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  is Aunt Jelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  dying to know Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; declared Angus mirthfully, &ldquo;she must be as good as a  play.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is! tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! Miss Sheldon, excuse me, comedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say burlesque, judging from your descriptions,&rdquo; said the Master, gaily. &ldquo;How  did you drop across her, Miss Sheldon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t drop across her,&rdquo; said Miss Sheldon, candidly, &ldquo;she dropped across me.  My father left me to her guardianship, and I was duly delivered in due course  like a bale of goods.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  isn&rsquo;t Aunt Jelly fulfilling her guardianship by seeing you through the  temptations of the Continent?&rdquo; asked Eustace, severely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she placed me under the wing of Mrs. Trubbles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad she didn&rsquo;t place you under the eye of Mrs. Trubbles,&rdquo; observed Otterburn,  with the brutal candour of youth, &ldquo;because both her eyes are invariably closed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a shame&mdash;I wonder where she is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asleep!  don&rsquo;t disturb her,&rdquo; said Gartney, as Miss Sheldon arose to her feet. &ldquo;Physicians  all agree that sleep after dinner is most beneficial to people of the Trubbles  calibre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Victoria  laughed at this remark, and as she showed a desire to stroll about, the  gentlemen left their chairs and escorted her through the grounds, one on each  side, the lady being thus happily placed between the sex masculine.</p>
  <p>A  good many of the promenaders had retired for the night, evidently worn out by  the heat of the day; but some indefatigable pianist was still hard at work in  the music saloon, and the steady rhythmic beat of the last new valse, &ldquo;My heart  is dead,&rdquo; sounded tenderly through the still night air, broken at intervals by  the light laughter of young girls, the deeper tones of men&rsquo;s voices, and the  melancholy sound of the waters washing against the stone masonry of the  terrace. Beyond on the lake all was strange and mystical, filled with cold  lights and shadows, vague and dreary under the gloom of the distant mountains;  but here, by the garish lights of the hotel, the pulse of life was beating  strongly, and the indescribable tone of idle frivolity seemed to clash with the  silent solemnity of Nature.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  Eustace felt this incongruity as his eyes strayed towards the steel-coloured  waters, for after a time the shallow conversation of Victoria jarred so  painfully on his ears that with a hurried excuse he left the young couple to  their own companionship, and wandered away alone into the fragrant darkness of  the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  awfully fond of his own company,&rdquo; observed Victoria, indicating the departing  Eustace. &ldquo;Such a queer taste. I hate being left to myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I,&rdquo; asserted Otterburn eagerly. &ldquo;I always like to be with someone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  the opposite sex,&rdquo; finished Miss Sheldon, laughing. &ldquo;Well, yes! women have  always been my best friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  answer at random.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare say; one is incapable of concentrated thought on a perfect night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are also growing poetical, then indeed it is time for a prosaic individual like  myself to retire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  don&rsquo;t go yet, you can&rsquo;t sleep here if you go to bed early.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that is your experience,&rdquo; said Miss Sheldon, as a bell from a distant  campanile, showing white and slender against the sky, sounded the hour of nine  o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll stay for a few minutes longer, though I&rsquo;m afraid Mrs.  Trubbles will be dreadfully shocked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  leaned over the iron balustrade of the terrace, and watched in charmed silence  the dark waters rising and falling in the chill moonlight. The valse still  sounded silvery in the distance, with its sad tone of regret and hopeless  despair, and after a time Victoria began to hum the melancholy refrain in a low  voice:</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;My  heart is dead,<br>
    And pleasure hath fled,<br>
  But the rose you gave me blooms fresh and red.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense,&rdquo; she said contemptuously, breaking off suddenly. &ldquo;I daresay the rose  was quite withered, only his imagination saw it was blooming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  his love for the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  bad shot, Mr. Macjean. How could it be so? His heart was dead, his pleasure  fled, so under these discouraging circumstances the rose must certainly have  been dead also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said Gartney was cynical,&rdquo; said Angus slowly, &ldquo;what about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about myself,&rdquo; she repeated with a sigh, turning round and leaning lightly  against the balustrade. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never thought about the  subject. Very likely it&rsquo;s not worth thinking about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Believe  me,&rdquo; began the young man earnestly, &ldquo;you are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything  that&rsquo;s charming,&rdquo; interrupted Victoria, crossing her hands. &ldquo;Do spare me any  compliments, Mr. Macjean, I&rsquo;m so tired of them. I wonder if you men think we  women believe all the lies you tell us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they&rsquo;re not lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not,  perhaps, for the moment, but afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  trouble about afterwards, the present is good enough for us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was getting on dangerous ground, for his voice was soft, and his young eyes  flashed brightly on her face, so as Victoria had only known him twenty-four  hours, even with her reckless daring of coquetry this was going too far, and  with the utmost dexterity she changed the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way,&rdquo; she said lightly, &ldquo;do you know I&rsquo;m a relation of yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  perhaps it is. Still you can judge for yourself. My mother&rsquo;s maiden name was  Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  dev&mdash;ahem! I mean good gracious. You must certainly belong to the family somehow  or other. I dare say&mdash;yes&mdash;I am sure you must be my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  a strained relationship. In what degree?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  never mind. Scotch clan relationships are so difficult to unravel. Besides, we&rsquo;re  all brothers and sisters by the Adam and Eve theory, according to Gartney. But  fancy you being a Macjean. It gives me a kind of claim on you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  the head of the clan, I suppose. Never! I am a free-born Australian, so hurrah  for the Southern Cross and the eight hours system of labour!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t the least idea of what you&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely. Born amid the effete civilization of a worn-out land, you have no  knowledge of our glorious institutions, which render Australia the Paradise of  Demos.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  like a Parliamentary speech.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a Parliamentary speech,&rdquo; asserted Victoria, demurely, &ldquo;an effort of my  father&rsquo;s when he was elected for the Wooloomooloo constituency.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon, would you mind spelling it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  you would be none the wiser if I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to my obeying you,&rdquo; said Otterburn, reverting to the earlier part of the  conversation, &ldquo;I think the opposite is more likely to happen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dangerous  ground again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Macjean,&rdquo; said Victoria in a solemn tone, &ldquo;the night is getting on to morning,  the tourists are getting off to bed. You are chattering in a most nonsensical  manner and I&rsquo;m going to retire, so good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not make any effort to retain her, although he felt very much inclined to  do so, but then their friendship was still in its infancy and the proprieties  must be observed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night,  and happy dreams,&rdquo; he replied, shaking the hand she held out to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, but I leave that to poets&mdash;and lovers,&rdquo; she responded, and thereupon  vanished like a fairy vision of eternal youth.</p>
  <p>And  lovers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I wonder&mdash;oh, nonsense! What rubbish! I&rsquo;ve only known her one circle of the  clock; Love isn&rsquo;t Jonah&rsquo;s gourd to spring up in a night. Still&mdash;well she&rsquo;s a  most delightful girl and I&mdash;Confound the valse! I do wish they&rsquo;d stop playing at  this hour. It isn&rsquo;t respectable. Awfully pretty!&mdash;and she&rsquo;s a Macjean too&mdash;ah, if  I&mdash;bother, it&rsquo;s gone out. I shan&rsquo;t smoke any more. I wonder where Gartney is.  Mooning about by himself, I suppose. I&rsquo;ll go and look him up. She&rsquo;s got lovely  eyes and such pretty feet. Eh! oh, here&rsquo;s Eustace&mdash;I say Gartney, I&rsquo;m going to  bed. Come and have a hock and seltzer before ta-ta.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
    A Day&rsquo;s Shopping</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;  &lsquo;Tis an Italian town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost a city yet not metropolitan wholly.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses red-roofed, white-walled, lofty in height with  iron balconies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Narrow and twisted the streets, with rough irregular  pavements:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below are the shops with their awnings o&rsquo;er windows,  filled with gaudy wares we see not in England,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid which stand the shop-keepers, shrill-voiced,  thievish, voluble and smiling.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Questo &egrave; troopo? &lsquo;Non e molto&rsquo;&mdash;question and answer and  question once more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the burning sunshine, in nooks, in corners, in  courts, in door-ways,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie the dark shadows, fit for the hiding of lovers, of  bravos, of damsels and men-at-arms ruffianly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Relations  were rather strained between Eustace and his young friend, the reason being as  usual to be found in the unconquerable selfishness of the former. With his  habitual egotism, Gartney insisted that the lad whom he had chosen for a friend  should attend solely to him, watch his every action with dog-like fidelity, and  have nothing to do with the rest of the world.</p>
  <p>This  Otterburn, high-spirited and wilful, naturally enough refused to do, though he  had hitherto been obedient to Gartney&rsquo;s whims and fancies in every way. Not  having heretofore had anything to attract his attention in any great degree,  and being fascinated by the strange nature of his poet-friend, Angus had duly  given him unlimited measure of the admiring adulation he so much desired. He  had listened patiently to Gartney&rsquo;s brilliant though somewhat egotistical  discourses, but now, with the irrepressible nature of youth, having fallen in  love with Victoria Sheldon he began to grow tired of his friend&rsquo;s dour nature  and pessimistic railings against the artfulness of womankind.</p>
  <p>They  had now been nearly a week at the Italian lakes, and from being her boyish  admirer, Otterburn had become the faithful slave of Victoria, and finding that  he could not serve both master and mistress in a strictly impartial manner, he  renounced his fidelity to Eustace. Of course he was still very friendly with  him and liked to listen to his epigrammatic conversation&mdash;on occasions, but  showed plainly that he much preferred Miss Sheldon&rsquo;s society, a discovery which  vexed his quondam friend mightily, the more so as he saw in such preference a  distinct triumph for Victoria.</p>
  <p>That  young lady had early announced her dislike to Eustace, deeming him cold, vain,  proud and an enemy to her sex; so, seeing Otterburn was to a certain extent  indispensable to him, she tried her hardest to bring about a separation between  these two close friends&mdash;and succeeded.</p>
  <p>Not  that she cared over much for Angus. He was certainly a very nice boy, and  wonderfully useful as a carry-and-fetch poodle&mdash;but the possibility of Otterburn  taking jest for earnest never occurred to her, and, ignoring with the calm  egotism of a woman the chance that he might break his heart for her sake, she  gave him sweet looks, undeserved frowns, was hot and cold, kind and cruel,  doleful and capricious, just as the humour took her, and by a dexterous use of  the whole armament of female wiles successfully accomplished the task she had  set herself.</p>
  <p>So  Otterburn having surrendered at discretion, which was hardly to be wondered at  against such a crafty enemy, was now devoted to his conqueror and saw  comparatively little of Eustace, who though distinctly annoyed at his defeat  cloaked his real feelings caused by Otterburn&rsquo;s desertion under the guise of  careless indifference, and either mooned dismally about alone or sought solace  in the society of the Erringtons, who were now making preparations for their  departure to England.</p>
  <p>Before  leaving, however, Lady Errington with characteristic good nature had thrown  aside all formality and called upon Mrs. Trubbles and Miss Sheldon at the Villa  Medici. She took a great fancy to Victoria, both on account of her beauty and  her generous straightforward nature, while Mrs. Trubbles amused her mightily  with the eccentricities of her character, so she asked them to a dinner at the  Villa Tagni, thereby earning the eternal gratitude of Angus, who foresaw a  chance of obtaining Victoria all to himself for one whole evening.</p>
  <p>Of  course she also invited Eustace, whom she pitied for his evident unhappiness,  thinking, with the natural fondness of a woman for romance, that it sprang from  some unrequited love affair and not, as was actually the case, from satiety and  cynicism. Eustace graciously accepted the invitation, and for once in his life  looked forward to such entertainment with some pleasure, as the cold,  irresponsive nature of Lady Errington roused his curiosity and made him anxious  to learn more of her inner life.</p>
  <p>A  few days before the Errington dinner-party, Mrs. Trubbles so far overcame her  disposition to sleep as to propose a day&rsquo;s shopping in Como to which Victoria  eagerly agreed, being anxious to see as much local Lombardian colour as  possible. On the morning of their proposed outing, however, Eustace, not being  able to endure with equanimity the prospect of a whole afternoon in the company  of Mrs. Trubbles, craftily betook himself on a boating excursion to the Villa  Pliniana, so Otterburn nothing loth formed the sole escort of the two ladies,  and this party of three were now standing in the Piazza awaiting the arrival of  the steamer.</p>
  <p>A  large, fat, good-natured woman was Mrs. Trubbles, with a broad red face ever  wearing a sleepy smile and a portly body arrayed in rainbow colours with plenty  of jewellery. Everybody in town knew the birth, parentage, and bringing up of  Mrs. Trubbles as her history had long ago passed the nine days&rsquo; wonder of  scandal, and was already somewhat stale and forgotten by all except her most  intimate friends, who never forgot to remind the good-natured lady that she was  noble only by the accident of marriage.</p>
  <p>The  Honourable Henry Trubbles was a detestable little man with a bass voice and an  overweening vanity concerning his political capabilities, though he had long  ago failed in diplomatic circles. A perusal of Beaconsfield&rsquo;s novels in his  youth had fired his ambition to emulate their hero, and like a very second-rate  Numa Pompilius he went to seek an Egeria who would inspire him with great  ideas. The Hon. Henry, however, was so singularly plain in person and  disagreeable in manner that no lady in his own rank of life would agree to help  him to attain to the Cabinet, so not being able to secure rank he married money  in the person of Miss Matilda Barsip, whose papa had made a fortune in army-contracting  during the Crimean War. The noble house of which Trubbles was a cadet offered  no opposition to the match, being rather glad to get the budding diplomatist  settled and done for, so Miss Barsip was duly married with great pomp to her  withered little stick of a lover, and six months after the army contractor had  the good taste to die, leaving them all his money.</p>
  <p>The  Family, to whom Mrs. Trubbles always alluded in a tone of awe as to some unseen  divinities, took the young couple up, and having floated them both into smooth  social waters left them to carry on their lives in their own way, which they  did. The Hon. Henry, now being in command of plenty of money, spent his life in  hanging on to the outside fringe of politics and pretended to know all the secrets  of the Cabinet, though as a matter of fact he was acquainted with nothing but  what he learned through the medium of the papers. He tried to get into  Parliament several times but was such a palpable idiot that no constituency  would elect him, so Mr. Trubbles not being able to serve his country, which did  not want him, fluttered round St. Stephen&rsquo;s, worried the ministers and bored  the members so much that if they could have given him the Governorship of a  nice yellow-fever island they certainly would have done so in order to get rid  of him. All the Colonial Governors, however, were healthy at present, so the  Honourable Henry stayed in town and exasperated everyone with his tea-cup  statesmanship.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Henry on her side had no ambition whatsoever, but drifted leisurely through  life, spending her money in a comfortable homely kind of fashion. She was  presented at Court on her marriage by the Dowager Duchess of Margate, but did  not appreciate the honour, so never went near St. James&rsquo; again in spite of the  orders of Henry, who thought the appearance of his rich wife might improve his  diplomatic prospects.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding  the efforts of the Misses Wilkers, whose academy she had attended at Hampstead,  English was not Mrs. Trubbles&rsquo; strong point, and being a good-natured old soul,  who never pretended to be anything else but what she was, the worthy Matilda  was a great favourite with her social circle. Her dinners were always  excellent, her dances pleasant and fashionable, and her portly person decked  out in gay colours was to be seen at many places, though for the most part she  preferred to rest in her own house whenever she got a chance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  too stout to be skipping about,&rdquo; she said candidly; &ldquo;that worriting husband of  mine is always hopping round like a cat on hot bricks, but for my part I like  peace and quietness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was certainly a most popular lady, such as the men about Town called a &ldquo;jolly  good sort&rdquo; and the ladies in Society approved of greatly, because she did not  give herself airs above her position; so in spite of her defective English, her  loud taste in dress, and the lowliness of her birth, the Hon. Mrs. Trubbles got  on very well indeed, and had a good number of friends and no enemies, which  says a good deal for her kindly disposition.</p>
  <p>The  trip to Italy had been undertaken at the suggestion of the Honourable Henry,  who wanted to study some political question concerning the Great Powers, of  which he knew absolutely nothing; so Matilda had also come with him to have a  look at foreign parts, and had taken Victoria with her, by permission of Aunt  Jelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  Mr. Trubbles to-day?&rdquo; asked Otterburn, digging his stick into the gravel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Henry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trubbles placidly, looking at the water in a somnolent  manner, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone to Bell-baggio, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bellaggio,&rdquo;  corrected Victoria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  like that,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Trubbles complacently. &ldquo;Dear! dear! how curious these  foreigners do talk!&mdash;they call a steamer a vapour-bottle, which is a curious  name. Dear me, Mr. Macjean, what are you laughing at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn  pulled himself up promptly, and had the grace to blush under the severe eye of  Victoria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>battello di vapore</i>,&rdquo; he said lightly, &ldquo;but indeed, Mrs. Trubbles, I&rsquo;m as  much at sea as you are about Italian. I prefer our gude Scottish tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glesgay,&rdquo;  suggested Victoria, whereat Angus made a gesture of horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no, I mean the language of Jeannie Deans, of Highland Mary, and of those  Jacobite songs that sprang from the leal hearts of the people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  once saw <i>Rob Roy</i>,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Trubbles heavily; &ldquo;they were all  dressed in tartans. I don&rsquo;t think the dress is very respectable myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll never come before you in the garb of old Gaul,&rdquo; said Angus gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think it would suit you splendidly,&rdquo; said Miss Sheldon approvingly,  glancing at his stalwart figure; &ldquo;if you go to a fancy dress ball you must wear  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn  laughed, and promised to obey her commands, but at this moment the steamer drew  in to the pier, and they were soon on board, steaming up to Como.</p>
  <p>It  was a beautiful morning, and as yet not too warm, the heat of the sun being  tempered by the cool breeze, which, blowing from the shore, brought with it the  resinous odours of fir and pine. On either side precipitous mountains towered  up into the intense blue of the summer sky, the innumerable villas made  pleasant spots of colour here and there, while the bosom of the lake, placidly  treacherous, was of changeful hues, like the varying colours of a peacock&rsquo;s  neck.</p>
  <p>Plenty  of tourists, in all sorts of extraordinary garbs, were on the deck of the  steamer, chattering Italian, German, English, and French, according to their  different nationalities, all laden with umbrellas, alpenstocks, Baedekers,  luncheon-bags, marine glasses, and such-like evidences of travel. Mrs.  Trubbles, having established herself in a comfortable corner, was trying to get  a short sleep prior to facing the fatigues of Como, so Victoria and her  attentive cavalier, being left to their own devices, began to talk about  everyone and everything.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  these tourists do hold on to their guide-books,&rdquo; said Victoria disdainfully, &ldquo;one  would think they&rsquo;d be quite lost without them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely they would,&rdquo; replied Otterburn, pulling his straw hat over his eyes with  a yawn, &ldquo;they have a prejudice against looking at any place without knowing all  about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  such a trouble reading up all about cathedrals and pictures&mdash;I like to ask  questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  guides!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no!&mdash;they&rsquo;re worse than Baedeker. They never stop talking, and their  information is so scrappy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Extensive  but not accurate,&rdquo; suggested Macjean with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure even about the extensive part,&rdquo; observed Victoria gaily; &ldquo;when I was  in England I went to a cathedral&mdash;I won&rsquo;t mention names&mdash;and the verger had a  cut-and-dried story about the place. When he finished his little narrative I  began to ask him questions. You&rsquo;ve no idea how exasperated he became, because  he knew absolutely nothing, and at last said, in despair, &lsquo;Why, Miss, you must  be an American.&rsquo; I told him I was an Australian, so he promptly replied, &lsquo;Well,  Miss, that&rsquo;s quite as bad&mdash;for questions.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  in duty bound, Angus laughed at this story, which was simple enough in itself,  but the telling of it seemed to establish a more friendly feeling between them,  of which this artful young man took full advantage, and began to point out the  various objects of interest on the lake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see that villa over there,&rdquo; he said in an official tone, &ldquo;it belongs to the  Visconti lot. They used to be Dukes of Milan, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  me! and why aren&rsquo;t they Dukes of Milan now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t  the least idea,&rdquo; replied Angus, whose historical knowledge was of the vaguest  description. &ldquo;Napoleon, you know, I think he upset the apple-cart&mdash;turned them  out, I mean. You see, Miss Sheldon, I&rsquo;m like your verger&mdash;I know a stereotyped  story, but if you ask me anything beyond I&rsquo;m up a tree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a very honest guide, at all events,&rdquo; said Victoria with a smile. &ldquo;What is that  tower on the hill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the castle of Baradello.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who was he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  ancient Johnnie, I believe,&rdquo; returned the young man carelessly, &ldquo;a duke or a  pirate, or a picture gallery, I forget which.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  information is most accurate,&rdquo; said Miss Sheldon gravely, putting up a large  red sunshade, which cast a rosy reflection on her piquant face, &ldquo;you must study  Baedeker very closely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Macjean  laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  severe you are,&rdquo; he replied lightly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got such a beastly memory. It&rsquo;s  like a sieve&mdash;but, I say, hadn&rsquo;t we better wake up Mrs. Trubbles? Here&rsquo;s Como&mdash;dirty  place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  dingy,&rdquo; assented Victoria, surveying the untidy-looking town with its  picturesque red roofs, above which arose the great Duomo like a great bubble. &ldquo;What  do you think, Mrs. Trubbles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?  what, my dear?&rdquo; said that lady, whom the stoppage of the steamer had aroused  from a very comfortable slumber. &ldquo;Very nice indeed. Like a picture I&rsquo;ve got  over the sideboard in the dining-room&mdash;but, dear me, how dirty the streets are!  I&rsquo;m afraid they haven&rsquo;t got a Board of Works. What does this man say?&mdash;Bill  something&mdash;who is he talking to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Biglietti,&rdquo;  explained Victoria, as they paused at the gangway. &ldquo;Tickets&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got them,  Mr. Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  here they are,&rdquo; said Angus, and, handing them to the officer in charge, they  went ashore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  little men,&rdquo; said Victoria, catching sight of some of the military, &ldquo;they look  like tin soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t seem very well fed,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Trubbles meditatively; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think  the food is good&mdash;very bad quality, I&rsquo;m afraid. Dear me, there&rsquo;s a fountain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more like a squirt,&rdquo; said Otterburn laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plenty  of water about this place,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Trubbles, putting up her eyeglass, &ldquo;but  I don&rsquo;t think these foreigners make enough use of it. Oh, dear! dear! what a  dreadful smell, they really ought to look after the drains better. I&rsquo;m so  afraid of typhoid. Mr. Macjean, would you mind smoking?&mdash;it&rsquo;s safer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Macjean was only too delighted, and having lighted a cigarette, was soon  blowing wreaths of smoke as they all walked up one of the narrow streets, on  their way to the Duomo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must do the church, you know,&rdquo; remarked Angus with great gravity, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the big  lion of Como&mdash;built by some one called Roderer or Rodari&mdash;I&rsquo;m not certain about  the name. Sounds like a champagne brand, doesn&rsquo;t it? It was built somewhere  about the thirteenth or fourteenth century&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure which.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t seem very sure of anything beyond the fact that there is a church,&rdquo; said  Miss Sheldon disparagingly, &ldquo;and as it&rsquo;s straight before you, we can be certain  it exists. They say it&rsquo;s all built of white marble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t look like it then,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Trubbles emphatically, &ldquo;a good coat  of paint wouldn&rsquo;t hurt it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that would spoil it,&rdquo; chorused both the young people, whereupon Mrs. Trubbles  shook her head, and held firmly to her original suggestion.</p>
  <p>Having  admired the ornate front, with its delicate Renaissance carvings they went out  of the burning sunshine into the cool twilight of the cathedral.</p>
  <p>Some  service was going on as they entered, and in the dim distance they saw the high  altar glittering with gold and silver ornaments, beneath gorgeous draperies of  yellow damask depending from the ceiling, and innumerable tapers flared like  beautiful glittering stars against the brilliant background.</p>
  <p>Numbers  of worshippers, with bent heads, were kneeling on the chill marble pavement,  telling their beads, or silently moving their lips in prayer, while a priest in  splendid vestments, attended by a long train of white-robed acolytes,  officiated at the altar, and at intervals the melodious thunder of the organ  broke through the monotonous voices of the choir. Placid-looking images of  saints, dusky pictures of the Virgin throned amid the hierarchy of heaven,  before which burned the lambent flames of slender white candles, many-coloured  tapestries representing biblical scenes, heavy gold brocaded hangings,  elaborately-carved shrines and the sudden flash of precious metals and  strangely-set jewels appeared in every nook and corner of the immense building,  while from the silver censers of the acolytes arose the drowsy incense, in  white clouds of sensuous perfume, towards the gilded splendour of the huge  dome. Here, from the lofty roof, the rapt faces of Evangelists, saints, angels  and virgins, looked gravely downward; there, slender shafts of sunlight,  streaming in through the painted windows, tinted the white monuments of the  dead with rainbow hues, and under all this subdued splendour of colour and  beauty, softened by the dusky twilight, knelt a mixed congregation. Bare-footed <i>contadini</i> from distant hill villages, devoutly told their beads next to  some dark-visaged soldier in all the bravery of military trappings, and  delicately beautiful ladies, arrayed in the latest Milanese fashion, knelt  beside bare-breasted peasants with sinewy figures full of the lithe grace and  suppressed fierceness of Italian manhood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder what Mactab would say to all this?&rdquo; muttered Otterburn involuntarily, as  he thought of the severe humility and bareness of the Kirk o&rsquo; Tabbylugs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Mactab?&rdquo; asked Victoria in a subdued whisper. Angus chuckled quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I never tell you of Mactab?&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;&ldquo;oh! I must. He&rsquo;s a prominent  minister of the Free Kirk, of the severest principles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are his principles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  what? Oh, he hasn&rsquo;t got any principals! He&rsquo;s a Free Kirk, I tell you. All this  heathenish worship would make him take a fit. He believes in nothing, not even  an organ, so the Mactab congregation sing dreadfully out of tune, but they make  up for this by strength of lungs. They could give that wheezy old &lsquo;kist o&rsquo;  whustles&rsquo; fits in psalmody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment Mrs. Trubbles, who had been gazing complacently about her with the  same sort of interest as she would have taken in a theatre, intimated that she  had seen enough, and led the way out into the hot sunshine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  rather tired of churches,&rdquo; said the matron in her deep voice &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve seen such a  lot of them in France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  France isn&rsquo;t in it with Italy in that line,&rdquo; observed Angus, in his slangy way.  &ldquo;There are more churches than public-houses here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s a very good thing,&rdquo; replied Victoria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think so, considering how thin the wines are,&rdquo; retorted Macjean, pausing  before a variegated kind of arcade; &ldquo;but look here&mdash;this is the market.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  how pretty!&rdquo; cried Victoria, noting the picturesque colouring of the different  piles of fruit&mdash;&ldquo;just like a scene out of Romeo and Juliet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  there is Juliet!&rdquo; said the Master wickedly, waving his stick in the direction of  a ponderous female who was leaning from a projecting iron balcony chattering to  a lady below with shrill volubility over some skinny-looking poultry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Juliet  in her old age buying Romeo&rsquo;s dinner,&rdquo; replied Victoria, serenely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  please, take the romance out of everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I leave that to Gartney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horrid  man!&rdquo; said the girl, viciously; &ldquo;he would disillusionise an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are one or two things, my dear Victoria,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Trubbles at this moment&mdash;&ldquo;there  are one or two things I should like to take home with me as a kind of mementum  of Italy. A fan or a shell-box&mdash;you know, dear; a box with &lsquo;A Present from Como&rsquo;  on it. Now, what is the Italian for &lsquo;A Present from Como&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Miss Sheldon, suppressing a smile. &ldquo;However, here&rsquo;s an  old curiosity shop. Let us go in and spy out the land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t talk the language myself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trubbles, doubtfully, as her bulky  figure filled up the door, &ldquo;but Victoria&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  much worse,&rdquo; interrupted that young lady, quickly. &ldquo;I know French, but not  Italian, except parrot-like in singing. Now Mr. Macjean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  worst of all,&rdquo; explained Otterburn, in the most brazen manner. &ldquo; &lsquo;Questo e  troppo&rsquo; is all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Translate,  please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means &lsquo;That is too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very good sentence to know,&rdquo; said the matron, decidedly. &ldquo;I believe these  foreign people are rarely honest. I shall learn it&mdash;&rsquo;Question he troppus.&rsquo; Is  that right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  quite; only three words wrong. &lsquo;Questo e troppo.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Questo  e troppo,&rsquo; &rdquo; repeated Mrs. Trubbles, carefully. &ldquo;What a pity these foreigners  don&rsquo;t learn English. It&rsquo;s so much better than their own gibberish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid we&rsquo;ll have to go in for the primitive language of signs,&rdquo; cried Victoria  gaily, as they stood in front of the diminutive counter behind which a smiling  Italian was gesticulating politely.</p>
  <p>It  would take a long time to describe the difficulties of that shopping. How the  shopkeeper, assisted by his tragic-looking wife, raved wildly in Italian, and  his three customers endeavoured vainly to find out what they both meant.  Sometimes one person would speak, then the other four would join in, the most  powerful voice taking the lead. What with &ldquo;Gran&rsquo; Dio&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;Per Bacco&rsquo;s&rdquo; from  the sellers, and &ldquo;Basta, basta,&rdquo; &ldquo;Questo e troppo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Si, si&rdquo; from the  buyers, the whole transaction was quite operatic in character.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Trubbles&rsquo; system of shopping was very simple.</p>
  <p>When  the shopkeeper said two lire, she replied one; if he requested five, she  offered four, always keeping the price down, being convinced in her own mind  that these foreigners were trying to swindle her, an idea abhorrent to her  sturdy British spirit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got a conversation book somewhere,&rdquo; she said at last, fishing in a capacious  pocket; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s got questions in three languages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the truth in none,&rdquo; observed Angus, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  here it is!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Trubbles, producing a kind of pamphlet. &ldquo;Here,  Mister Signor,&rdquo; holding up an olive-wood paper-cutter, &ldquo;Wie viel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  shrug of the shoulders and a gesture of dismay from the shopkeeper, who did not  understand German.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  he doesn&rsquo;t know his own language!&rdquo; said Mrs. Trubbles, with great contempt. &ldquo;They  need a School Board here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; suggested Victoria, who was suffocating with laughter, &ldquo;I think you are  talking German.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear!  dear! you don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo; said the lady meekly, somewhat after the fashion of M.  Jourdain, who had talked prose for years and did not know it. &ldquo;Yes, quite right.  These books are so muddling. Where&rsquo;s the Italian? Oh, here; &lsquo;Quanto, quanto?&rsquo; &rdquo;  shaking the paper-cutter frantically. &ldquo;Quanto, signor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tre  lire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bother  the man! I&rsquo;m not talking about a tray!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Trubbles, in an exasperated  tone. &ldquo;Here!&mdash;this! Use your eyes. Paper-cutter. &lsquo;Papero cuttero. Quanto?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tre  lire, signora.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  means three francs,&rdquo; explained Victoria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  does he. I&rsquo;ll give him two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Questo  e troppo,&rdquo; said Otterburn, bringing forward his only bit of Italian with great  ostentation. &ldquo;Two&mdash;due&mdash;lire, signor. Ah, che la morte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; from the shopkeeper, &ldquo;non e molto.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  what does that mean?&rdquo; cried the matron, referring to her text-book. &ldquo;Here it  is: &lsquo;not much,&rsquo;&mdash;si, si; far too much, too molto, due&mdash;due lire,&rdquo; producing them  triumphantly from her purse.</p>
  <p>With  many deprecating shrugs and asseverations in fluent Italian that such a sale  would ruin him, the shopkeeper at last accepted the two lire, and Mrs. Trubbles  with great satisfaction secured what she wanted. They then bought a few more  things by pursuing the same system of beating down the prices, and all three  ultimately left the shop with the firm conviction that they had secured  bargains, which they decidedly had not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  pigs of English,&rdquo; observed the astute shopkeeper to his wife, &ldquo;always talk a  lot, but they pay in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  the three innocents abroad wandered aimlessly through the narrow streets, saw  the statue of the great electrician, Volta, the ruined battlements, the church  of St. Abbondio, and other objects of interest. Afterwards they had some  refreshment at a caf&eacute;, the proprietors of which Mrs. Trubbles, who was a  spendthrift in London but a miser abroad, denounced as robbers, and then were  fortunate enough to catch a steamer just starting for Cernobbio.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  dear! dear!&rdquo; moaned Mrs. Trubbles, with a weary sigh, as she sat down in a  comfortable seat&mdash;&ldquo;what with their language, their lies, and their nobby-stone  streets, I&rsquo;m quite worn out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think one visit is quite enough for Como,&rdquo; said Victoria, as the town receded  into the far distance. &ldquo;When do we leave this place, Mrs. Trubbles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a week, dear,&rdquo; murmured the lady in a sleepy tone. &ldquo;My husband will get all his  politics settled by that time, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so, too. I&rsquo;m tired of the lakes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say that,&rdquo; said Otterburn, reproachfully; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sorry to leave the Villa  Medici.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t. We can go; you can stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to stay if you go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clearly  this obtuse young man was irrepressible, and as he was now getting on dangerous  ground again, Victoria deftly turned the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose we&rsquo;ll see you and Mr. Gartney at Rome?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. Will you be glad to see us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps.  I don&rsquo;t like Mr. Gartney; I&rsquo;ve told you so a dozen times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  will you be glad to see me?&rdquo; demanded Otterburn, boldly.</p>
  <p>Victoria  looked at him mischievously, with a dangerous gleam in her dark eyes, then  lowering her sunshade with a laugh, she turned abruptly away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be glad when we arrive at the Villa Medici,&rdquo; she said, lightly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so  hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How  on earth was a young man to make love to such a capricious girl?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    Lady Errington&rsquo;s Little Dinner</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;An  alien race beneath an alien sky,<br>
    Amid strange tongues, and faces strange alone,<br>
    Stout English hearts who for the moment try<br>
To form a little England of their own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  the constant sight of dark Italian faces, and the everlasting clatter of  restless Italian tongues, the guests at the Villa Tagni found it pleasant to  form part of an English circle once more, to eat an English dinner, to discuss  English subjects and compare everything British to the disadvantage of all  things Continental. So great a delight did these six people take in meeting one  another at a hospitable dinner-table that one would have thought they had been  for years exiled in the centre of Africa, and far removed from all civilizing  influences. Heaven only knows there is no lack of English tourists on the  Continent, but then to a great extent they preserve their insular stiffness  towards one another; consequently when people meet in foreign parts, who have a  slight acquaintance at home, they rush into one another&rsquo;s arms with tender  affection, though they would mutually consider one another insufferable bores  during the London season.</p>
  <p>This,  however, was not the case with Lady Errington&rsquo;s guests, who were all genuinely  delighted with one another, and chatted gaily on different kinds of subjects as  if they had been bosom friends all their lives. The Hon. Henry had been invited  on account of his wife, who in her turn had been invited on account of Victoria,  but having gone to Milan to see an Italian Count who had all the complications  of European politics at his fingers&rsquo; ends, he telegraphed the sad news that he  would not be able to be present, at which Lady Errington was secretly very  glad, as an extra man would have quite upset the balance of the party.</p>
  <p>As  it was, Sir Guy took in the portly Mrs. Trubbles to dinner, his wife was  escorted by Eustace, and the Master of Otterburn realised the wish of his heart  by acting as cavalier to Miss Sheldon. So things being thus pleasantly  arranged, they all sat round the well spread table as merry a party as it would  be possible to find.</p>
  <p>In  some mysterious manner Lady Errington had managed to provide a series of  English dishes, to which all present did ample justice, not that anyone was  particularly a gourmand, but Italian cookery is a trifle monotonous and a real  English dinner in Italy is something to be appreciated. At all events, what  with the food, the wine, and the continuous strain of light badinage, all the  guests were in a state of the highest good humour, and even the pessimistic  Gartney deigned to take a moderately charitable view of things.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is jolly and no mistake,&rdquo; said Otterburn, as the servant filled his glass with  champagne, &ldquo;you need to go abroad to appreciate home comforts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you would appreciate them anywhere,&rdquo; remarked Eustace the cynic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  quite right too,&rdquo; chimed in Miss Sheldon, with a gay laugh, &ldquo;everybody does,  only they don&rsquo;t like to confess it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; demanded Sir Guy.</p>
  <p>Victoria  looked rather nonplussed for the moment, having made an idle statement without  thinking she would be called upon to give her reasons.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied, after some hesitation. &ldquo;I suppose people like to be  thought romantic, and thinking about what you eat and drink isn&rsquo;t romantic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very sensible at all events,&rdquo; said Lady Errington; &ldquo;do you not agree with me  Mrs. Trubbles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; replied the matron ponderously, nodding her head, upon which was perched a  cheerful-looking cap of black lace and glittering bugles, &ldquo;people should always  eat and drink well at meal times, but no nibblin&rsquo;s in between. It isn&rsquo;t nature  to despise good food well-cooked. I&rsquo;ve no patience with those gells who starve  themselves and pinch their waists to look pretty. Wasps I call them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  the sting,&rdquo; suggested Sir Guy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends on their tempers, and their tempers,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Trubbles  impressively, &ldquo;depend on their eating. Give them good meals and plenty of  exercise, and there&rsquo;s the makin&rsquo; of good wives about them. Let them starve  themselves and lace tight, and it makes their noses red and their tempers  cross.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  whole duty of woman then,&rdquo; murmured Eustace demurely, &ldquo;is to appreciate her  cook and disobey her dressmaker. They might do the first, but never the second.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Trubbles, not understanding irony, looked doubtfully at Eustace to see if he  was smiling, but so grave was the expression of his face that she did not know  whether he spoke in jest or earnest, so without making any reply, she continued  her meal while the conversation became frivolous and general.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think Italy a very over-rated place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!  In what respect&mdash;morals, scenery, manners?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  as regards music. It&rsquo;s a very barrel-organy country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  more so than the London streets. And after all, `Ah che la Morte,&rsquo; is more  musical than &lsquo;Tommy make room for your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both  out of date.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  say Gounod&rsquo;s &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Boulanger March.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it&rsquo;s much jollier than the Op. 42 <i>andante adagio con fuoco prestissimo</i> sort of things they give you at the Richter Concerts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maclean,&rdquo;  observed Eustace, gravely regarding his glass, &ldquo;you are a Philistine, and  classical music of the advanced school is thrown away on your uncultivated ear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt! I prefer &lsquo;Auld Lang Syne&rsquo; to Beethoven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally,  being a Scotchman. You&rsquo;re like the man who knew two tunes. One was &lsquo;God save  the Queen,&rsquo; the other&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Trubbles, whose ideas of music were primitive in the  extreme, &ldquo;that I went to a concert at St. James&rsquo; Hall, where they played  something called a fuggy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fugue,&rdquo; translated Victoria for the benefit of the company. &ldquo;I know! One tune  starts, a second catches it up. Then a third joins in, and just as it  successfully muddles up the other two, a fourth and a fifth have their say in  the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  dreadfully mixed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it sounds exactly what it is,&rdquo; said Miss Sheldon promptly. &ldquo;But what about this  particular fugue, Mrs. Trubbles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fugue, dear&mdash;yes, of course. There was a young man in front of me wriggled  dreadfully. I thought he was uneasy about a pin, but he was only showing how  pleased he was with the music, and kept calling out &lsquo;Oh this is food!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wanted  the bottle, I expect,&rdquo; said Eustace sweetly, &ldquo;such musical babies shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed  to go to classical concerts. It&rsquo;s too much for their nerves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too much for mine,&rdquo; remarked Otterburn grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After dinner,&rdquo; said Gartney,  looking thoughtfully at him, &ldquo;I shall play the &lsquo;Moonlight Sonata.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, Lady Errington, may I stay out on the terrace? Such a suggestion is  inhuman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington laughed and gave the signal to the ladies, whereupon they all arose  to their feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid you&rsquo;re talking dreadful nonsense,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a poor heart that never rejoiceth,&rdquo; replied Otterburn impudently, as he opened  the door for the ladies to depart.</p>
  <p>Following  the Continental fashion, Sir Guy and his guests did not linger long over their  wine, but, after a few minutes, went into the drawing-room, whence they strolled  on to the terrace for cigarettes and coffee.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Trubbles, feeling sleepy after her dinner, found a comfortable chair in a  distant corner of the room, and went placidly to sleep, while the remaining  guests established themselves on the terrace, the gentlemen with cigarettes and  the ladies with coffee.</p>
  <p>Such  a perfect night as it was. Away in the distance, dense and black against the  cold, clear sky, frowned the sombre masses of mountains, above which hung in a  cloudless firmament the silver shield of the moon. Here and there a liquid star  throbbed in the deep heart of the heavens, and overhead shone the misty  splendour of the Milky Way; not a breath of wind ruffled the still surface of  the lake, which reflected the serene beauty of the sky, but at intervals across  the star-smitten surface would move the dark, slim form of a boat, the oars  breaking the water into thousands of flashing diamonds.</p>
  <p>Far  beyond glimmered the orange-coloured lights of Blevio, and the sudden whiteness  of some tall campanile shooting up in slender beauty from amid its dark mass of  surrounding houses. A sense of perfect fragrance in the still air, a charmed  silence all around, and a wondrous restful feeling under the cool magic of the  night. Then, mellowed by distance, faint and far like aerial music, the silver  tones of a peal of bells sounded at intervals through the clear atmosphere,  until the whole night seemed full of sweet sounds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is the night when Diana kisses Endymion,&rdquo; said Eustace dreamily, &ldquo;the antique  deities which we all deny are still on earth in Italy. They are not visible,  nor will they ever be so save to the eye of faith alone. Even then they are  doubtful of revealing themselves to a generation who would put them under the  microscope and on the dissecting table. But although we try hard to disbelieve  in their existence, the spell of their beauty is sometimes too strong, and I  never go anywhere among these hills without a secret hope of finding Pan asleep  at noontide in the ilex shade, or of seeing the laughing face of a Dryad framed  in tamarisk leaves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your hope is never realised,&rdquo; said Lady Errington sadly; &ldquo;that is so true of  our modern desires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  we always desire the impossible,&rdquo; replied Eustace, clasping his hands over his  knees while the chill moonlight fell on his massive face, &ldquo;and expect to find  it in crowded cities under the glare of gaslight, instead of in these magic  solitudes where the moon shines on haunted ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  is it possible to reconcile man and Nature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;According  to Matthew Arnold, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a romantic way you have of looking at things, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; remarked Victoria  with some impatience. &ldquo;If everyone took your view of life, I&rsquo;m afraid the world  would not get on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all humbug,&rdquo; cried Otterburn, who agreed in every way with Miss Sheldon, &ldquo;that  is, you know, not quite sensible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay it is not&mdash;in a worldly sense,&rdquo; said Eustace bitterly, &ldquo;but then you see  I don&rsquo;t look at everything from a purely utilitarian point of view.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do&rdquo; interposed Guy in his hearty British voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the only way to get one&rsquo;s  comforts in life. And one&rsquo;s comforts suggest smoking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn  assented with avidity, for they had been sitting with cigarettes for some time,  but never lighted up, and even Eustace departed so much from his poetic  dreamings as to accept the soothing weed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t practise what you preach, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; said Lady Errington, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  many of us do?&rdquo; asked Gartney complacently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we talk a lot and do  nothing, now-a-days. It&rsquo;s the disease of the latter end of the nineteenth  century.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  everything&rsquo;s very jolly,&rdquo; said Otterburn, who resembled Mark Tapley in his  disposition. &ldquo;Who was it said that this was the best of all possible worlds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Voltaire!  But by that it was not his intention to infer he didn&rsquo;t yearn after some better  world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think that was in M. Arouet&rsquo;s line.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid it isn&rsquo;t in any of our lines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a rude remark,&rdquo; said Lady Errington severely. &ldquo;This conversation is becoming so  atheistical that I must ask Mr. Gartney to carry out his promise and play the  Moonlight Sonata. It may inspire us with higher thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Como Moonlight Sonata&mdash;it will be a local hit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense you do talk, Macjean,&rdquo; said Eustace rising to his feet and throwing  his cigarette into the water, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re like that man in the Merchant of Venice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  man in the Merchant of Venice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you don&rsquo;t know your Shakespeare, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t teach it to you,&rdquo;  retorted Eustace, and stepping lightly across the terrace, he sat down at the piano,  which was placed near the window of the drawing-room, and ran his fingers  lightly over the ivory keys. Within the party on the terrace could see the  gleam of the marble floor, the dull glitter of heavily embroidered curtains,  the faint reflection of a mirror, and over all the rosy light of a red-shaded  lamp the glare of which streamed out into the pale moonlight.</p>
  <p>Everyone  sat silently in the wonderful mystic world created by the magic of the moon,  and from the piano a stream of melody, sad and melancholy, in a minor key,  broke forth on the still night. The spell of the shadows, the weirdness of the  hour, and the presence of Lady Errington, to whom he felt strangely drawn, all  had their influence on Gartney&rsquo;s wonderfully impressionable nature, and he began  to improvise delicate melodies on a story suggested to him by the calm lake  gleaming without.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the crystal depths of the blue lake,&rdquo; he chanted in a dreamy monotone, while  the subtle harmonies wove themselves under his long lithe fingers, &ldquo;there dwells  a beautiful fairy, in a wondrous palace. She is in love with the nightingale  who sings so sweetly from the laurels that hang their green leaves over the  still waters. The voice of the hidden singer has strange power and tells her of  the cool green depths of the forest; of the rich perfumes shaken from the  flowers by the gentle night-wind, and of the ruined shrines from whence the  gods have fled. As the passionate notes well forth from amid the dusky shadows  the eyes of the beautiful fairy fill with hot tears, for she knows that the  bird sings of a long dead love, of a long dead sorrow. But she has no soul, the  beautiful fairy, and cannot feel the rapture, the passion, the sadness of love.  She rises to the glittering surface of the lake, and waves her slender white  arms to the nightingale that sings so sweetly in the moonlight. But the dawn  breaks rosy in the eastern skies, the rough wind of the morning whitens the  lake, and the nightingale sings no more. Then the beautiful fairy,  broken-hearted, sinks far down into the placid waters, to where there blooms  strange flowers of wondrous hues, and weeps, and weeps, and weeps for the love  which she can never feel without a soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  chord, and the player let his hands fall from the keyboard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a beautiful story, such as Heine might have told,&rdquo; said Lady Errington  softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  inspiration is Heine,&rdquo; replied Eustace dreamily, and relapsed into silence.</p>
  <p>Victoria,  eminently a woman of the world, grew weary of this poetical talk and made a  sign to Otterburn, who, understanding her meaning, arose to his feet as she  left her chair, and they strolled along the terrace laughing gaily. A sound  from within showed that Mrs. Trubbles was once more awake, so Guy in his  capacity of host went inside to attend to her, and Eustace, sitting at the  piano, was left alone with Lady Errington.</p>
  <p>So  frail, so pale, so ethereal she looked in the thin cold beams of the moon,  lying back, still and listless, in her wicker chair, with her hands crossed  idly on her white dress. The man at the piano was in the radiance of the rosy  lamplight, but the woman, dreaming in the silence, looked a fitter inhabitant  for this weird, white world of mystery and chilly splendour. Watching her  closely, even in the distance, Eustace caught a glimpse of her eyes for the  moment, and fancied, with the vivid imagination of a poet, that he saw in their  depths that undefinable look of unfulfilled motherhood which had led him to  call her an &ldquo;incomplete Madonna.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Filled  with this idea, a sudden inspiration of ascertaining the truth seized him, and  without changing his position, he replaced his fingers on the ivory keys and  broke into the steady rhythmical swing of a cradle song.</p>
  <p>His  voice was a small sweet tenor, not very loud, but wonderfully soft and  sympathetic, so that he rendered the song he now sang with rare delicacy and  tenderness.</p>
  <p class="quote"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.</b></p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Sleep,  little baby! peacefully rest,<br>
  Mother is clasping thee close to her breast;<br>
  Angels watch over thee gentle and mild,<br>
  Guard thee with heavenly love undefiled.<br>
  Sleep little baby, safe in thy nest,<br>
  Sleep little baby! mother&rsquo;s own child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="quote"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.</b></p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Sleep,  little baby! fear not the storm,<br>
  Tenderly mother is holding thy form.<br>
  Mother&rsquo;s eyes watching thee ever above<br>
  Shine like twin stars with fathomless love.<br>
  Sleep, little baby! safely and warm,<br>
  Sleep, little baby! mother&rsquo;s own dove.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  he had ended the song with one soft, long-drawn note, he glanced furtively at  Lady Errington, and saw that he had touched the one sympathetic chord of her  nature, for those calm blue eyes were full of unshed tears hanging on the long  lashes. Eustace delicately refrained from noticing her emotion, but rising from  the piano strolled on to the terrace, leaned lightly over the balustrade and  gazed absorbedly at the restless water, dark and sombre under the stone wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  perfect night,&rdquo; he murmured after a pause, during which Lady Errington found  time to recover herself from the momentary fit of emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered Alizon mechanically, then after a pause, &ldquo;thank you very much for the  song.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad you liked it,&rdquo; responded Eustace equably, and again there was silence  between them. The moonlight shone on both their faces, on his, massive and  masterful with a poetic look in his wonderfully eloquent eyes, and on hers,  delicate, distinct and fragile, as if it had been carved from ivory. Light  laughter from the two young people at the end of the terrace, a deep murmur of  conversation from within, where Sir Guy strove gallantly to entertain his  drowsy guest, but this man and woman, oblivious of all else, remained absorbed  in their own thoughts.</p>
  <p>Of  what was she thinking? of her past sorrow, her present happiness, her doubtful  future (for the future is doubtful with all humanity)&mdash;Who could tell? Eustace,  delicately sympathetic as he was, stood outside the closed portals of her soul,  into which no man, not even her husband, had penetrated. But men and women,  however closely allied, however passionately attached, however unreserved in  their confidences, never know one another&rsquo;s souls. There is always a something  behind all which is never revealed, which the soul feels intensely itself, yet  shrinks from disclosing even to nearest and dearest, and it is this vague  secret which all feel, yet none tell, that makes humanity live in loneliest  isolation from each other.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  Lady Errington was thinking of this hidden secret of her soul which none knew,  nor ever would know, but Eustace, softened for the moment by the unexpected  maternal emotion his song had evoked, was envying his cousin the possession of  this cold, silent woman. Had he known her personally before her marriage he  might not have cared much about her, save in a friendly way, but his eccentric  imagination had endowed her with a vague charm, which no other woman possessed,  and the knowledge that she belonged to another man made him bitterly regretful.  It was ever thus with the whimsical character of Eustace Gartney. Place  something within his reach, and he despised it, place it beyond his hope of  attainment, and he would strain every nerve to possess it. He lived in the  pursuit of the unattainable, which of all things had the greatest charm for  him, and this unattainable vision of charming womanhood filled his soul with  passionate anguish and desire.</p>
  <p>Suddenly,  with a sigh, Lady Errington lifted up her eyes and saw Eustace looking at her,  respectfully enough, yet with a certain meaning in his gaze which caused her  vague embarrassment, she knew not why.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  music has made me dream, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; she said, nervously opening her fan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are of a sensitive nature, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  sighed again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  very sensitive. It is a most unhappy thing to be impressionable, one feels  things other people count as nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Other  people are wise,&rdquo; said Eustace in an ironical tone, &ldquo;they take Talleyrand&rsquo;s  advice about a happy life, and&mdash;are happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your experience?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  reverse; but then you see I have not taken Talleyrand&rsquo;s advice. It is excellent  and infallible to many people, but not to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refer you to one Hamlet, who said, &lsquo;The time is out of joint.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hamlet  was a morbid, self-analysing egotist,&rdquo; said Lady Errington, emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;you  are wrong. He was a man crushed down by melancholy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Principally  of his own making, though certainly he had plenty of excuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  don&rsquo;t you think I have any excuse for being unhappy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alizon  looked at him critically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are young, healthy, rich, famous. No, I don&rsquo;t think you have any excuse. Do you  remember my advice to you the other night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  philanthropy, yes. But we did not come to any agreement on the subject, because  we were interrupted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;History  repeats itself,&rdquo; said Lady Errington, rising, &ldquo;for here come Mrs. Trubbles and  Guy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Macjean and Miss Sheldon. Farewell, Minerva&mdash;Momus is King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wisdom  gives place to Folly&mdash;well, is not that a very good thing,&rdquo; said Alizon  laughing, &ldquo;you would grow weary of a world without change.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay. To no moment of my life could I have said with Faust, &lsquo;Stay, thou art  so fair.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alizon,  Mrs. Trubbles is going,&rdquo; said Sir Guy&rsquo;s voice, as the ponderous matron rolled  towards his wife like a war-chariot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  so sorry,&rdquo; observed Lady Errington, taking the lady&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trubbles in a sleepy voice, &ldquo;but I always go to bed  early here, the climate makes me so sleepy. I have enjoyed myself so much&mdash;so  very much. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next  time you visit,&rdquo; whispered Otterburn to Victoria, &ldquo;bring a chaperon who is  wide-awake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will&mdash;you shall choose my chaperon, Mr. Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mightn&rsquo;t like my choice,&rdquo; said Macjean wickedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean a lady, of course,&rdquo; replied Victoria demurely, &ldquo;not an irreverent young  man like&mdash;well, never mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  me, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but you looked it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Victoria  laughed, and departed with Mrs. Trubbles and her hostess to put her wraps on,  while the three gentlemen had a short smoke and conversation, after which they  all separated for the night.</p>
  <p>Eustace  walked silently back in the moonlight with Mrs. Trubbles who did all the  talking; and the young couple behind them talked Chinese metaphysics.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For passions that die,<br>
Sir Poet, &lsquo;tis best to let sleeping dogs lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose,&rdquo; said Eustace to his friend, &ldquo;that as we are here we may as well see  something of the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  we have seen a lot,&rdquo; objected Angus, removing his post-prandial cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think so?&rdquo; observed Gartney serenely; &ldquo;it strikes me that your &lsquo;seeing a  lot&rsquo; has been principally confined to pottering about this place in company  with Miss Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn  looked a trifle sheepish at this very pointed remark, and resumed his cigarette  with a nervous laugh.</p>
  <p>They  were seated under a mulberry tree, looking at the lake flashing in the  brilliant sunshine, listening to a noisy cicada that was singing to itself in  an adjacent flower-bed, and watching the brown lizards chasing one another over  the hot stones of the parapet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  do you want to go to?&rdquo; asked the Master, after a pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was thinking of driving to Cantari. It&rsquo;s a queer old village, dating from the  time of Il Medeghino.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  the deuce was he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  pirate of this ilk, who used to sweep the lake with a fleet of ships.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wouldn&rsquo;t take a very big fleet to do that,&rdquo; said Otterburn, staring at the  narrow limits of the lake. &ldquo;I daresay one of our ironclads could have knocked  the whole show to kingdom-come in no time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  probably,&rdquo; replied Eustace dryly, &ldquo;but luckily for Il Medeghino there were no  ironclads in those days, and a good thing too. Torpedoes, Gatling guns, and  dynamite have taken all the romance out of war. But this is not the question.  What about Cantari. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I hardly know&mdash;I&mdash;do you think Miss Sheldon would care to come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might, only I&rsquo;m not going to ask her. There&rsquo;s not much amusement in watching  her flirting with you in some old church. Besides she&rsquo;d admire the altar-cloth  because it would make such a lovely dress, and the jewels of the shrine because  they would look so charming on her own neck. No. I am not going to have my  enjoyment spoilt by the everlasting chatter of a woman&rsquo;s tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  horribly severe,&rdquo; said Angus wincing. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Miss Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  a pretty woman, yes. As a companion, no. She&rsquo;s a coquette.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you? Well, wait a week. Your disenchantment will soon commence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  a true woman,&rdquo; declared Macjean hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  therefore capricious. My dear lad, the two things are inseparable. But once  more&mdash;for the third time. What about Cantari?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man looked at the blue sky above, the blue lake below, the  brilliantly-coloured flowers, and ultimately brought his eyes back to Eustace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  come if you like,&rdquo; he said awkwardly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t trouble,&rdquo; replied Eustace curtly, springing to his feet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go alone,&rdquo;  and he walked off in a huff, Otterburn making no attempt to stop him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a cross chap he is,&rdquo; muttered the Master to himself, &ldquo;he always wants a fellow  to be dodging about those old ruins. It isn&rsquo;t good enough when there&rsquo;s a pretty  girl about&mdash;not much. Life&rsquo;s too short to waste one&rsquo;s chances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  which slightly egotistical soliloquy, Otterburn pitched his cigarette into a  flower-bed and strolled off to the music-room, where he found Miss Sheldon  strumming waltzes on a fearfully bad piano.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  here you are,&rdquo; she cried, rising with alacrity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad. I want to go out  for a stroll, and Mrs. Trubbles doesn&rsquo;t. That nuisance of a husband of hers is  talking her to sleep with politics.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is rather a trial,&rdquo; murmured Otterburn, as they went outside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trial!&rdquo;  echoed Miss Sheldon, with supreme contempt, unfurling her sunshade, &ldquo;I should just  think so. One might as well have married a Blue-Book. Why did she marry him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the sake of contrast, probably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not impossible. Where is the amiable Mr. Gartney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone  geologizing, or ruin-hunting. Something of that sort!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he&rsquo;s in very good company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I say, you know,&rdquo; said Angus, making a weak stand for the character of his  absent friend, &ldquo;Gartney isn&rsquo;t a bad fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but  you think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more than you do, or you wouldn&rsquo;t stand there talking such nonsense,&rdquo; said  Victoria severely. &ldquo;Come and buy me some peaches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Otterburn held his tongue in the meekest manner, and bought her peaches, which  they devoured comfortably by the lake, talking of everything, except Eustace  Gartney.</p>
  <p>In  the meanwhile that gentleman, considerably upset in his own mind by what he  termed Macjean&rsquo;s selfishness (he was quite oblivious of his own), had gone  round to some stables in the village, selected a carriage, and was now being  driven along the dusty white road in the direction of Cantari.</p>
  <p>The  driver, a swarthy young man with a somewhat dilapidated suit of clothes, a  shining hard hat, and a good-natured smile, called the weak-kneed animal which  drew the vehicle &ldquo;Tista,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tista&rdquo; was the nearest approach to a skeleton  ever seen outside the walls of a museum. Peppino (the driver) encouraged Tista  (the horse) by first shouting and then abusing him in voluble Italian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  pig of a horse why go so slow? Child of Satan, is not the corn of the  illustrious Signor waiting for thee at Cantari?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  might have been, but Tista seemed to have his doubts about the truth of this  statement, for he did not mend his pace, but ambled complacently on, stopping  every now and then to whisk a fly from his hide. At last, in despair, Peppino  got down from his perch and trudged up the hill beside Tista, who shook his  bells bravely and made a great show of speed over the irregular road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t  you better carry him?&rdquo; asked Eustace in Italian, observing this comedy in  sarcastic silence. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll live as far as Cantari.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peppino  touched his hat, grinned at the wit of the English milord, and without any  reply went on abusing the stolid Tista with the brilliant vocabulary of a Texus  mule driver. At last Tista with much difficulty managed to gain the top of the  hill, whereupon Peppino mounted his perch once more, cracked his whip in grand  style, and his attenuated horse proceeded to tumble down the incline.</p>
  <p>Tista  neither galloped, cantered, nor walked, but simply tumbled down the hill, being  considerably assisted in his descent by the weight of the carriage behind. Then  came a stretch of comparatively level road, running along the side of the lake,  where Tista resumed his ambling, and after a deliberate journey the three,  horse, driver and passenger, reached Cantari.</p>
  <p>Here  Eustace left his carriage at the Albergo Garibaldi, and, lighting a cigarette  as a preventative against the evil odours of the village, strolled through the  narrow streets with listless curiosity.</p>
  <p>Cantari  is situated on the side of a steep mountain which slopes sheer into the lake,  and in fact some of the dwellings are built on stone piles over the tideless  waters. All the houses, grey and weather-worn are huddled together as if for  warmth, and from the bright green forests high above there falls a great sheet  of foaming water, which descends through the centre of the village by several  stages until it plunges with a muffled roar into the lake.</p>
  <p>A  perfect labyrinth of streets, narrow and gloomy, with tall grey houses on  either side, cobbled stone pavements sloping from both sides to an open drain  in the centre, and high above a glimpse of blue sky rendered all the more  brilliant by the chill darkness of the place below. Then endless flights of  rugged stairs, worn into hollows by the heavy feet of many generations, long  sombre passages with humid walls, and slender stone bridges throwing a single  arch across the tumbling white torrent raging below in dusky depths of cruel  seeming. Heavily barred doors set in the massive walls, and higher up, rows of  grated windows like those of some oriental seraglio, with open green shutters,  just catching a fleeting glimpse of sunlight; still higher, iron railed  balconies over which white linen hung out to dry, and highest of all, the vivid  red of the tiled roofs, round which swooped and twittered the swift swallows.</p>
  <p>In  these dreary streets and alleys a perpetual twilight ever reigns, adding to the  uncanny feeling of the place. Now and then a gaudily-dressed <i>contadina</i>,  all red skirt, gold earrings and barbaric colouring, clatters down in her  wooden pattens; dark-browed, mobile-faced men lounge idly against the walls,  laughing gaily, and at intervals sleek grey donkeys, laden with baskets piled  with the vivid colours of vegetables and fruit, climb painfully up the steep  ascent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  like the Middle Ages,&rdquo; mused Eustace, as he toiled upward. &ldquo;All kinds of dark  deeds could take place in these winding streets. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see  a band of the Baglioni waiting for some foe of their house in these dark  corners, or to meet Dante climbing these steep stairs dreaming of Hell and  Beatrice. Stradella might sing in the moonlight under that high balcony, where  doubtless at night a peasant Juliet chatters love in villainous patois to some  dark-browed Romeo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  sudden turn of the stairs brought him into the brilliant sunshine and on to a  little piazza hanging midway on the green mountain between the blue lake and  the blue sky. Severally on three sides, an albergo, a caf&eacute;, a church, and on  the fourth a wondrous view of sparkling waters, cloud-swathed hills, and  distant pinnacles of Alpine snow.</p>
  <p>Thoroughly  tired out by his climb, Eustace sat thankfully down in an iron chair, put his  feet on another, and ordered some wine from a dreary little waiter who emerged  from the caf&eacute; to attend to his wants. While waiting, Eustace tilted his straw  hat over his eyes, weary with the vivid colours of the landscape, and fell fast  asleep. The waiter brought the wine, saw that the English gentleman was asleep,  so retired cautiously without waking him.</p>
  <p>In  the pale blue sky the restless swallows flashed in rapid circles or twittered  around the sloping eaves of the houses. On the hot stones of the little piazza  slept the restless brown lizards, and in the centre a fountain of sparkling  water splashed musically in its wide stone basin, all carved in Renaissance  style with vines and masks and nude figures of frenzied Bacchanals. The sun  dipped behind the arid peak of a great mountain, and threw its shadow on to the  mountain village, while the mellow bells began to ring slowly in the slender  campanile. Eustace awoke with a start, to find that he had been asleep for some  considerable time, and after drinking his wine, and feeing the dreary little  waiter, went across to have a look at the church before descending.</p>
  <p>It  was exactly the same as any other Italian church, frescoes of angels, and  saints, and wide-eyed cherubim, side altars, before which burned the low,  steady flame of oil lamps, high altar glittering with jewels and flowers,  painted windows, faint odour of incense and all such things. A woman was  kneeling at the confessional, within which sat a severe-looking priest, and  Eustace, catching a glimpse of this, took a seat in the shadow near the door  lest he should disturb them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I could only believe like that,&rdquo; he thought to himself as he enviously watched  the kneeling woman, &ldquo;how much happier I should be; but it is impossible for me  to shift my burden of sins on to the shoulders of another man. This is the age  of disbelief, and I am of it, but I would give the whole world to be able to  return to the primitive simple faith of these peasants, to believe in miracles,  in the intercession of saints, in the canonization of pious people, and in all  those beautiful fables which make their lives so bright.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  still church, the faint fumes of incense, the sudden flash in the dusky shadows  of cross and pictured face, all influenced his singularly impressionable  nature. He felt lifted up from the things of this earth into a higher region of  spirituality, and in the exaltation of the moment felt inclined to kneel down  on the cold pavement and lift up his voice in prayer. But the mocking spirit of  disbelief, the spirit which denies, damped this sudden impulse of strong faith,  and he sat there in the cold twilight, pitying himself profoundedly with the  self-commiseration of an egotist, for the weariness of his life, which came  from the selfishness of his own actions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  infinitely dreary is this life of ours, with its cant and humbug, its hollow  aspirations and unsatisfying rewards. We try to make ourselves happy and only  succeed in rendering ourselves cynical. If there were only some chance of  compensation in the next world, but that is such a doubtful point. We are like  wanderers on a lonely moor misled by false lights&mdash;false lights of our own  creation. We know nothing, we can prove nothing, we believe nothing&mdash;not very  gratifying after eighteen centuries of Christianity. After all, I daresay that  old Greek philosopher was right, who said &lsquo;Eat, drink, for to-morrow we die.&rsquo;  Still, one grows weary of eating, and drinking, and other things&mdash;especially  other things. Marriage, for instance&mdash;I ought to marry, and yet&mdash;it&rsquo;s such a  hazardous experiment. I would tire of the best woman breathing, unless I  chanced on the other half of myself, according to Plato&rsquo;s theory. That, I&rsquo;m  afraid, is impossible, though it certainly hasn&rsquo;t been for the want of trying.  I&rsquo;ve loved a good many women, but the passion has only lasted the life of a  rose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment of his reflections he chanced to raise his eyes, and saw in front  of him a picture of the Madonna, with the calm look of maternity on her face,  and this sight turned his thoughts in the direction of Lady Errington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is curious that I should be so attracted by that woman. I wonder what can be  the reason. She is not particularly brilliant, nor clever, nor exquisitely  beautiful, and yet she seems to satisfy that hunger of the soul I have felt all  my life. One can think, but not describe a woman&rsquo;s character, even the most  shallow woman&rsquo;s; there is always something that escapes one. Alizon Errington  has that something, and it is that which attracts me so powerfully. That calm,  reposeful, sympathetic nature which appeals so strongly to a worn-out soul. If  I were ill, I would like her to sit beside me and lay her cool hand on my  forehead&mdash;she is like moonlight, dreamy, restful and indescribable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  she is the woman of my dreams, the impossible ideal which all men imagine and  no man ever meets. If this should be the case, Fate has played me a cruel trick  in making her my cousin&rsquo;s wife. She does not love him&mdash;No!&mdash;she loves nothing  except a vague fancy, which will turn to a passionate reality when she becomes  a mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guy  is living in a fool&rsquo;s paradise, for he takes her sympathetic nature for a  loving one. Some day he will be undeceived and find that he loves a statue, a  snow queen, who can never respond to his passion. When she becomes a mother she  will find her soul, which will only awaken at the cry of a child; but at  present she is an Undine&mdash;a faint, white ghost&mdash;the shadow of what a woman should  be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I love her?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. There is something too spiritual about this new  passion of mine. It is as evanescent as the dew, as unreal as moonlight; there  is no flesh and blood reality about such platonisms. I am no Pygmalion to  worship a statue. Still, if the gods endowed this statue with life&mdash;What then?  It is difficult to say. I would love her. I would adore her, and yet&mdash;she is the  wife of my cousin and I&mdash;I am the fool of fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a dreary laugh he rose from his seat, feeling cramped and chill in the grim  shadows. He went outside, but the sunlight had died out of the sky and all the  beautiful, brilliant world was dull and grey; the magic light had passed away  from on land and water, leaving a sombre, weary earth, across which the wind  blew cold and bleak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rose-coloured  spectacles! Rose-coloured spectacles!&rdquo; he muttered, plunging into the gloomy  stairs of the street. &ldquo;If I could only buy a pair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peppino  and Tista were waiting for him at the Albergo Garibaldi, and in a few minutes  he was on his way back to the Villa Medici.</p>
  <p>The  sun had disappeared behind the distant hills, and in a rose-coloured sky hung  the faint shadow of a waning moon, looking thin and haggard amid the  fast-fading splendour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is like the moon,&rdquo; he sighed sadly, &ldquo;like the pale, cold moon. As fair&mdash;as calm&mdash;and  as lifeless as that dead world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There  was no doubt that Angus Macjean was very much in love with Miss Sheldon, which  to wiseacres would appear rather foolish, seeing that he had only known her  three weeks. But as, according to Kit Marlowe, &ldquo;He never loved who loved not at  first sight,&rdquo; Otterburn had fulfilled such practical advice to the letter, and  however rapidly love had sprung up in his heart in that short space of three  weeks, it had become sufficiently powerful to dominate all his other faculties.</p>
  <p>As  to the wisdom of this sudden passion, he was somewhat doubtful, for two  reasons, one being that he did not know whether Victoria would accept him, and  the other that even if she did, his father might refuse to sanction the match,  a very probable contingency, seeing that the old Lord had already settled the  matrimonial future of his heir.</p>
  <p>Under  these circumstances Otterburn, much as he was in love, felt rather embarrassed  as to the manner in which he should proceed. He adored this bright-eyed,  piquant beauty with all his soul, so, according to the neck-or-nothing  traditions of Love, should have thrown all other considerations to the winds,  but having inherited from his father a vein of Scotch caution he deemed it wise  to proceed with due circumspection.</p>
  <p>Gartney  might have advised this half-hearted lover, but Otterburn knew that neither his  lady-love nor his friend liked one another, so thought it useless to ask for an  opinion which would be diametrically opposed to his own desires. Seeing,  therefore, that there was nothing satisfactory to be obtained from Eustace,  Otterburn made up his mind to find out indirectly what Johnnie Armstrong  thought of the matter.</p>
  <p>It  may appear strange that he should condescend to speak of such a subject even  indirectly to his servant, but then Johnnie was much more to him than a  servant, being an old and faithful friend of the family, who had seen him grow  up from childhood, and regarded himself in the light of a humble adviser to the  young heir in the absence of Mactab, to whom Johnnie deferred as spiritual  adviser.</p>
  <p>According  to this view of the matter, which would have been quite incomprehensible to  Eustace, who regarded his valet as a useful machine, Johnnie was no ordinary  servant, and although Angus did not intend to ask him right out how he thought  such a union would be received at Dunkeld Castle, yet he knew that once Johnnie&rsquo;s  tongue was set going he would soon find out all he wanted to know.</p>
  <p>Johnnie,  in himself, represented the home authorities, and feeling very doubtful in his  own mind as to the views that might be taken of the affair, after much  cogitation Angus determined to ascertain the sage Johnnie&rsquo;s opinion on the  subject, and one morning, while he was dressing, broached the idea in a most  artful way.</p>
  <p>He  was standing before the mirror brushing his hair, and Johnnie was hunting for  some special necktie he had been told to find, when the following dialogue took  place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Johnnie,&rdquo;  asked Angus, without turning his head, &ldquo;were you ever in love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Johnnie  paused for a moment and rubbed his bald brow with one lean red hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weel,  Maister,&rdquo; he said, with habitual Scotch caution, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll nae gang sae far as tae  say I michtna hae been. There wis reed-heeded Mysie, ye ken a canty lass wi&rsquo; a  braw tocher. Ye&rsquo;ll mind her, sir, doon the burn near Kirsty Lachlan&rsquo;s but an&rsquo;  ben.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  say I recollect her,&rdquo; replied Angus carelessly. &ldquo;All the girls are red-headed  about Dunkeld. Well, did you love Mysie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  I did,&rdquo; said Johnnie coolly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; maybe she would hae made me a decent gudewife  if it hadna been for that blithering Sawney Macpherson&mdash;the gowk wi&rsquo; the daft  mither&mdash;whae yattered her saul oot wi&rsquo; his skirlin&rsquo; about her braw looks, an&rsquo;  sae she married him. It wasna a happy foregathering,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Armstrong  spitefully, &ldquo;for Sawney&rsquo;s ower fond o&rsquo; whusky, an&rsquo; the meenister had him warned  fower times i&rsquo; the Kirk o&rsquo; Tabbylugs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you like the Italian girls?&rdquo; asked the Master, who had been listening with  some impatience to Johnnie&rsquo;s long-winded story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  puir lot, Maister, a puir lot. Feckless things whae warship the Scarlet Wuman  wi&rsquo; gew-gaws an&rsquo; tinkling ornaments in high places. They&rsquo;re aye yelpin&rsquo; fra  morn till nicht wi&rsquo; idolatrous processions an&rsquo; graven images.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  these religious views of the godly Johnnie did not interest Otterburn, he  proceeded:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of Miss Sheldon, Johnnie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  nae sae bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nonsense. She&rsquo;s an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weel,  I&rsquo;ve seen waur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Johnnie  was evidently determined not to commit himself in any way, so Angus spoke  straight out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  would you say if I married her, Johnnie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Losh  me,&rdquo; ejaculated Armstrong in dismay, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll be clean daft to dae sic a thing.  The auld Lord would never forgie ye, Maister. An&rsquo; Mistress Cranstoun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  hang it. I&rsquo;m not going to marry her,&rdquo; retorted Angus, snatching a necktie from  Johnnie&rsquo;s paralysed grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  misdoubt me what the godly Mactab wull spier&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&mdash;  Mactab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hech!  just listen tae him,&rdquo; cried Johnnie, with uplifted hands. &ldquo;The meenister whae  brocht him up in the psalms o&rsquo; David an&rsquo; led him by mony waters through the  paraphrases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue!&rdquo; said the Master, stamping his foot. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to make any  remarks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  your wull then?&rdquo; demanded Johnnie sourly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think there&rsquo;ll be a row if I married her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&mdash;that I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye  mauna gang like th&rsquo; Israelites after strange wumen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  got plenty of money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  artful remark appealed to Johnnie&rsquo;s strongest passion, and he considered the  question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weel,  I&rsquo;ll nae say but what that micht dae ye some gude,&rdquo; he said cautiously, &ldquo;but,  oh, Maister, it&rsquo;s nae the auld Lord I fear, it&rsquo;s the meenister o&rsquo; Tabbylugs, as  ye weel ken. If ye but get the richt side o&rsquo; his lug, maybe ye can tac&rsquo; this  dochter o&rsquo; Belial tae Kirk&mdash;if no, I fear me, Maister, there&rsquo;ll be the deil tae  pay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Angus  made no reply to this speech, as he knew what Johnnie said was perfectly true,  so having thus ascertained exactly how his marriage to Victoria would be taken,  he rapidly finished his dressing and ran downstairs, leaving his faithful  henchman shaking his grizzled head in dour Scotch fashion over the probable  anger of Mactab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  daft bit laddie,&rdquo; commented Johnnie, folding up his master&rsquo;s clothes, &ldquo;tae fly  i&rsquo; the face o&rsquo; Providence aboot a lass. An&rsquo; that auld Jeezebel whae dodders  after her would like it fine, I&rsquo;m thinking, tae see the lass Leddy Otterburn. I&rsquo;ll  no tac&rsquo; the responsibility on me. The laddie ma gang tae the auld Laird an&rsquo; the  meenister, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll nay say aye, I misdoot me the Maister &lsquo;ull gang his ain  gait for aw their skirling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Angus was standing at the front door of the hotel, thinking over the  conversation he had just had, and having a considerable amount of common sense  saw that Johnnie Armstrong was correct in his remarks about Mactab. Being a man  of great shrewdness and genuine piety he had attained a strong influence over  the somewhat stern nature of Lord Dunkeld, who knew that Mactab&rsquo;s advice if not  always palatable was essentially sound.</p>
  <p>Lord  Dunkeld had set his heart on the marriage of his only son with Miss Cranstoun,  as that ill-favoured damsel was heiress to the estate adjoining that to which  Angus was heir, and such a match would considerably increase the territorial  possessions and influence of the Macjean family in the Border land.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless  Angus, though not a fortune hunter, knew that Victoria Sheldon was very  wealthy, and in this democratic age an excellent match in every way, so  provided his father was satisfied regarding the birth of the young lady (and  the fact that her mother was a Macjean was greatly in her favour), there was a  chance of success, especially if Mactab approved, of which, however, Angus was  doubtful, for the minister greatly admired Miss Cranstoun owing to her  assiduous attendance at the Kirk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deuce  take the whole lot of them,&rdquo; grumbled Otterburn, as he thought over all this. &ldquo;I  wish they&rsquo;d let a fellow fix up his own life. One would think I had no feelings  the way they order me about. That Cranstoun girl is as ugly as sin, and I don&rsquo;t  see why I should marry her just because she&rsquo;s got the next estate to ours. Why  doesn&rsquo;t my father marry her himself if he&rsquo;s so jolly anxious to get the  property? As for Mactab, he ought to mind his own business instead of meddling  with mine. Hang it, I won&rsquo;t stand it. I&rsquo;m not engaged to that Cranstoun thing,  so I can do as I like. Victoria goes away to-morrow, and Lord only knows when I&rsquo;ll  see her again, so I&rsquo;ll take the bull by the horns and ask her to marry me. If  she won&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s no harm done, and if she will, the whole lot at Dunkeld can  howl themselves hoarse for all I care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having,  therefore, made up his mind in this impulsive manner, Otterburn, in order to  give himself no time to change it, walked off in search of Victoria, to offer  her the heart which his father fondly trusted was in the keeping of Miss  Cranstoun of that ilk.</p>
  <p>Miss  Sheldon was seated in the Chinese room writing letters, and so absorbed was she  in her occupation, that she did not hear Otterburn enter.</p>
  <p>It  was a lofty, fantastical apartment, with an oval roof tinted a dull grey, on  which were traced red lines of a symmetrical pattern to resemble bamboo  framing, and the walls were hung with Chinese paper, forming a kind of tapestry  on which the artist, ignorant of perspective, had traced strange trees,  brilliant birds, impossible towers, bizarre bridges, and odd-looking figures.  In the four corners of the room, on slender pedestals, sat almond-eyed, burly  mandarins, cross-legged, with their long hands folded placidly on their protuberant  stomachs, and pagoda-shaped hats, with jingling bells on their pig-tailed  heads. Chinese matting on the floor, lounging chairs of bamboo work, oblong  tables, on which stood barbaric vases of porcelain, all gave this room a  strange Eastern look, suggesting thoughts of crowded Pekin, the odour of  new-gathered tea, and a vision of queer towers rising from the rice plains,  under burning skies.</p>
  <p>Otterburn  was not thinking of the Flowery Land, however, as his mind was too full of  Victoria, and he stood silently watching her graceful head bent over her  writing, until, by that strange instinct which warns everyone that someone is  near, she raised her eyes and saw him standing close to the door. &ldquo;Oh, good  morning,&rdquo; she cried gaily, as he advanced. &ldquo;Sit down for a few moments, and don&rsquo;t  interrupt me. I&rsquo;m engaged in a most unpleasant task. Writing to Aunt Jelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!  is it so disagreeable?&rdquo; said the young man, sitting down in one of the light  chairs, which creaked complainingly under his weight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  replied Miss Sheldon, nodding her head and pursing up her lips. &ldquo;Very, very  disagreeable. Being my guardian, she always seems to think I&rsquo;m in mischief, and  I have to report myself once a week to her like a ticket-of-leave man, or  rather woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you tell her everything?&rdquo; asked Otterburn, rather aghast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  certain reservations. Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope I&rsquo;m included in the reservations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  yes. At least, I&rsquo;ve not yet sent Aunt Jelly a portrait of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  shall I ever gain that enviable distinction?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Sheldon shrugged her shoulders with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think it enviable to be dissected for the benefit of a carping old woman? I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t. Besides, as you are a friend of Mr. Gartney&rsquo;s, you will meet his  dreadful aunt on your return to England, and she can criticise you herself,  instead of gaining an impression second-hand from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I do meet her, I hope the criticism will be favourable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you are her ward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see the connection,&rdquo; replied Victoria, with feminine duplicity, but her  heightened colour showed that she understood his meaning, and Otterburn, being  by no means deficient in understanding regarding the sex, immediately took  advantage of the secret sympathy thus suddenly engendered between them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a very plain sort of fellow, Miss Sheldon,&rdquo; he said, with a certain boyish  dignity, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t talk so glibly about things as most men, but I think you  can guess what I want to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused for a moment, but as Victoria made no observation, he drew a long  breath, and continued:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love you, and I want you to marry me&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll have me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  spite of the brusqueness of this declaration, crude in the extreme, adorned  with no fine flowers of speech or passionate protestations of eternal love,  Victoria felt that he spoke from his heart, and that this manly declaration was  more to be believed than any sickly, sentimental speech of honey and spice.  Still, she made no sign to show how deeply his honest straightforwardness had  touched her, but scribbled idly on the blotting-paper with her pen, whereupon  Otterburn, emboldened by her silence, gently took the hand which was lying on  her lap, and went on with increasing hopefulness of tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust you do not think me presumptuous in speaking so soon, but although I have  only known you a few weeks, yet in that time I have learned to love you very  dearly, and if you&rsquo;ll only become my wife, I&rsquo;ll do everything in my power to  make you happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  withdrew her hand from his grasp, and throwing down the pen on the table,  turned her clear eyes gravely on his face, then, without any maidenly confusion  or any mock modesty, she answered him calmly, although the tremulous quivering  of her nether lip showed how deeply she was moved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are doing me a great honour, Mr. Macjean, and I assure you I appreciate the  manner in which you have spoken, but&mdash;it cannot be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  surely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she replied, lifting her hand to stay his further speech. &ldquo;I am only a girl, I  know, but then I have been brought up in the Colonies, and in these matters I  think Australian girls are more self-reliant than those in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  might have been a schoolmistress delivering a lecture on manners, so coldly did  she speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like you! I respect you, but I do not love you, and I could marry no man  without loving him. We have only known each other three weeks, so are in total  ignorance of each other&rsquo;s character. No, Mr. Macjean, much as I thank you for  the honour you have done me&mdash;the greatest honour a man can offer a woman&mdash;yet I  must say no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you give me no hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think it would be wise to do so. We part to-morrow, and may meet others  we like better, so it would be foolish for either you or myself to bind  ourselves in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn,  seeing from her cool, composed speech that her mind was made up, arose to his feet  with a look of despair on his bright, young face, upon which she also arose  from her chair, and laid her hand gently on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Believe  me, you will think as I do later on,&rdquo; she said in a friendly tone; &ldquo;forget that  this conversation has ever taken place, and let us be on the same footing as  before. We part to-morrow, as I said before, but it is more than probable that  we will meet in London&mdash;if so, let us meet as friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  composure with which she spoke irritated Otterburn fearfully, the more so as it  was so unexpected. This brilliant, piquant creature, who should have been all  fire and passion, talked to him as if he were a schoolboy, and argued about  love as if she was an elderly dry as-dust professor of science. Perhaps  Victoria knew this, and, as she did not wish to marry Otterburn, thought that  such a cold-blooded way of discussing his passion, from a worldly point of  view, would have the effect of making him care less about her refusal to marry  him.</p>
  <p>They  stood looking at one another for a moment, the man angry at what he considered  her unjustifiable treatment, the woman composed, but withal a trifle frightened  at the tempest she had provoked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we part friends?&rdquo; she said, holding out her hand with a quiet smile.</p>
  <p>Angus  looked at her with a glance of anger in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coquette!&rdquo;  he growled out between his clenched teeth, and, taking no notice of her  extended hand, left the room quickly.</p>
  <p>Left  to herself, Victoria sat down and thought over the scene. The declaration of  Angus had touched her by its manly honesty, but, as she had not thought of  marrying him, her mode of refusal had certainly been the best possible in order  to cool his passion. His anger, however, and the fast word he had uttered,  opened her eyes to the situation, and she saw that her determination to spite  Eustace, by taking his friend away, had been more serious than she imagined.</p>
  <p>This  reflection made her angry with herself, and of course she vented her rage on  Angus, simply because she had treated him badly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stupid  boy,&rdquo; she said to herself, angrily, &ldquo;he might have seen I was not in earnest. I  never gave him to understand that I would marry him. These men are so  conceited, they think they have only got to throw the handkerchief like the  Sultan. The lesson will do him good. Yet he is a nice, honest boy, and I&rsquo;m  sorry we did not part friends. Never mind, I expect he&rsquo;ll come back shortly. I&rsquo;m  sure he ought to, and beg my pardon&mdash;if he&rsquo;s got any sense of decency&mdash;foolish  boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  tried to write but felt too angry with herself, Angus and the whole world, to  do so, therefore she ran up to her own room, worried herself ill over the whole  affair and ultimately ended up in having a good cry and a fit of  self-commiseration.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Otterburn in a towering passion, walked outside, and seeking a secluded seat  under a spreading oak, sat down in a most doleful mood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  heartless coquette,&rdquo; said this ill-used young man aloud, staring dismally at  the lake. &ldquo;I wonder what she thinks a man is made of to be preached at? I asked  for love and she gave me a sermon. Good Lord! I thought she would have cried  and made a fuss like other girls, but she didn&rsquo;t, confound her! Fancy talking  about ignorance of character and all that stuff, when a fellow&rsquo;s dying of love,  and as to being friends, that&rsquo;s not my style. I&rsquo;m not going to run after her  like a poodle dog, and be driven away every two minutes. I&rsquo;ll see Gartney, and  we&rsquo;ll go away at once. I&rsquo;ll never see her again, never! never! never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  emphatic, at all events,&rdquo; said a quiet voice at his elbow, and on turning  round, he saw Eustace standing near him complacently smoking a cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; said Otterburn, in an ill-tempered tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  forgive me, but I couldn&rsquo;t help overhearing the last few words you spoke. I&mdash;I  hope you&rsquo;ve been successful in your wooing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; retorted Angus sulkily, stretching his long legs  out, and thrusting his hands into his trouser pockets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon,&rdquo; replied Eustace, ceremoniously. &ldquo;I have no wish to force your  confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Master made no reply, but glared savagely at his boots, while Eustace, taking  in the situation at a glance, stood silently beside him, not without a secret  gratification that Otterburn had been punished for his base desertion of  friendship for love. This was so like Gartney, whose colossal egotism saw in  the successes or failures of others nothing but what tended to his own  self-glorification.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gartney,&rdquo;  said Otterburn, suddenly looking up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m deadly sick of this place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everyone  seems to be of your opinion,&rdquo; answered Eustace, complacently; &ldquo;the Erringtons  go to-day, and Mrs. Trubbles to-morrow&mdash;of course la Belle Victoria accompanies  them&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you inconsolable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was cruel of Eustace, and he knew it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; retorted Angus, doughtily, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not the only girl in the world. I  wish to heaven you&rsquo;d talk sense. Tell me when are we going to start?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  Vienna?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  rather tired of Vienna,&rdquo; said Gartney, listlessly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there four times  and it&rsquo;s always the same. If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d rather we tried a fresh  locality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Otterburn, with a scowl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go anywhere&mdash;to the devil if  you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  looking too far ahead,&rdquo; replied Eustace ironically. &ldquo;What do you say to Cyprus?  I&rsquo;ve been reading Mallock&rsquo;s book about it and it seems one place not in the  grip of Cook&rsquo;s tourists and Baedeker&rsquo;s Guide Books. We can take the train to  Venice, and go down the Adriatic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; said Macjean, rising, with a huge sigh. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll go to  Milan to-day. You can follow to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Eustace quietly, judging it best to let his young friend go away  for a time and get over his disappointment in solitude. &ldquo;I will come with you  to Como, and can see both you and the Erringtons off at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll go and tell Johnnie to get my traps together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  but look here, old fellow, although you have not honoured me with your  confidence I can guess your trouble, but don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s all very well for you,&rdquo; said Otterburn, reddening, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not in love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that,&rdquo; murmured Eustace in a dreary tone, whereupon Angus  laughed scornfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t sound like it&mdash;by-the-way, you can say goodbye to Mrs. Trubbles for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Miss Sheldon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  Miss Sheldon and you too!&rdquo; retorted Otterburn, and thereupon bolted, so as to  give Eustace no opportunity of making further remarks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo;  quoth Eustace the philosopher, &ldquo;does not improve manners. Macjean is like a  young bear with a sore head, and Miss Sheldon&mdash;well, she&rsquo;s got another scalp to  hang in her wigwam.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    Auf Wiedersehn</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Goodbye!  Goodbye!&mdash;our lives divide,<br>
  We drift apart on Life&rsquo;s broad tide,<br>
  Faint-hearted, sad and solemn-eyed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Fate&rsquo;s decree.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Goodbye!  Goodbye!&mdash;but not farewell,<br>
  Tho&rsquo; side by side we may not dwell.<br>
  Some day we&rsquo;ll meet&mdash;But who can tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this will be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  the time of parting had come at last, as it must come to all, and these men and  women who had met by chance at the Italian Lakes were about to separate. But  who could tell what effect the intimacy of the last few weeks would have on  their future lives?</p>
  <p>It  seemed as though the love-romance of Victoria and Otterburn were over, killed  by the woman, and even if they did meet again, it would be under such widely  different circumstances that they would surely never be able to renew their  earlier intimacy.</p>
  <p>True  to his resolve Otterburn departed for Como without seeing Victoria again, and  Eustace saw him safely off in the train with the faithful Johnnie in  attendance. He then went to say goodbye to the Erringtons, who were going up by  the St. Gothard line, intending to stay a few days in Paris prior to returning  to England.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye,  old fellow,&rdquo; said Guy, shaking hands with Eustace in the tumult of the station.  &ldquo;When you come back to Town don&rsquo;t forget to look us up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I won&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; replied Eustace gravely, though he privately determined to  keep out of temptation&rsquo;s way as much as possible. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll  be in England. I go to Cyprus first, and then may look in at Athens and go up  the Dardanelles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should get married and settle down,&rdquo; said Guy gaily. &ldquo;What do you say, Alizon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid to give an opinion,&rdquo; replied Lady Errington discreetly. &ldquo;When Mr.  Gartney returns I may be able to say something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked at Eustace in a friendly manner, and as he saw the cold, pure look in  her eyes, he knew at once that whatever passion for this woman he might feel,  he had not succeeded in awakening any response in her impassive nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  statue! A statue,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Poor Guy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  goodbye to Mr. Macjean for me,&rdquo; said Lady Errington, giving him her hand. &ldquo;And  as to yourself I will not say goodbye, but <i>au revoir</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  whistle blew shrilly, the train moved slowly off, and Eustace, with bare head,  holding his hat in his hand, stood silently amid the crowd with a vision before  his mind&rsquo;s eye of the sweet face with the cold pure light in the blue eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  statue! a statue,&rdquo; he said again, as he went back to Cemobbio. &ldquo;It is a foolish  passion I have for her, but I dare say a few months&rsquo; travelling will make me  forget that such chilly perfection exists.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  his return to the Villa Medici, he told his valet to pack up everything and be  ready to start by the early train next morning, in order to meet Otterburn and  leave Milan by the afternoon train for Venice, as Victoria would be at Milan  the next day, and Otterburn did not wish to meet her again.</p>
  <p>As  for that young lady, although she did not care much about Otterburn, yet her  self-love received rather a severe shock when she learned how promptly he had  taken his dismissal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Mr. Macjean?&rdquo; she asked Eustace that night, after dinner, as he sat smoking  outside in the garden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has gone away,&rdquo; replied Eustace, who was anxious to prolong her curiosity as  much as he could and let her drag the facts of the case piecemeal from his  reluctant mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Victoria  flushed a little under his keen gaze and tapped her foot impatiently on the  ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought he was going with you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  did I. But for some reason he preferred going by himself to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a vexed tone in the ejaculation, and Eustace smiled to himself as he  thought of her anger. She knew the reason of this abrupt departure, so did  Eustace, and each of them perfectly understood one another; therefore, when  Victoria saw the smile curling the corners of Gartney&rsquo;s mouth, she felt  inclined to strike him in her exasperation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did he not say goodbye?&rdquo; she demanded sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He did not honour  me with his confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was lucky for Eustace that Victoria did not at that moment possess regal power,  for she would then and there have ordered him off to execution, but as she  could not do this she did the next best thing to it, and retreated gracefully  from the field of battle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I were you, Mr. Gartney, I would teach that friend of yours manners,&rdquo; she said  superciliously. &ldquo;However, we are not likely to meet again, so it does not  matter. You go to-morrow morning, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  we go in the afternoon, so we won&rsquo;t have the pleasure of being  fellow-travellers&mdash;goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  shook hands coldly, with mutual dislike, and then Victoria went away gaily, so  as to afford Eustace no opportunity of seeing her mortification, but when she  arrived in her own room she raged like a young lioness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare he treat me in such a way!&rdquo; she said wrathfully, referring to the absent  Otterburn. &ldquo;Because I do not choose to marry him, he need not slight me so  openly before his friend. Ah! that wretched Mr. Gartney, how detestable he is.  Always sneering and supercilious. I should like to kill him, and he knows it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no doubt that the triumph was now with Gartney, and all through her own  fault. She had refused offers before, but the makers of them had always taken  their defeat meekly and continued to haunt her steps. Otterburn, however, had  treated her as no man had ever treated her before, and when she grew calmer,  with the whimsical inconsequence of a woman, she actually began to admire his  independence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a man at all events,&rdquo; she said, drying her tears, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s got a mind  of his own. If I do meet him again I&rsquo;ll make him propose again, in spite of his  temper, and then I&rsquo;ll pay him out for going off like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was truly a bad look-out for Otterburn if she remained in the same mind, but  then the chances were that his promptitude of action, having secured her  admiration, would end up by making her love him, and when they met again it was  doubtful who would come off victor.</p>
  <p>Eustace,  on his side was very much gratified by the conversation he had had with  Victoria, and after bidding farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Trubbles, went to bed in  quite a good temper.</p>
  <p>Next  morning he left Cemobbio and started for Milan.</p>
  <p>On  arriving he found Otterburn at the station, looking tired and haggard, but this  was due to want of sleep and not to dissipation, as Eustace charitably  surmised. The young man was in a fearfully bad temper, and although he was  burning to question Eustace about Victoria, yet his own sense of dignity would not  allow him. So during their journey to Venice, he sat in sulky silence, reading  a book and inwardly raging at the fickleness, ingratitude and caprices of  womankind.</p>
  <p>Since  they had last occupied a railway carriage together, a change had certainly come  over both of them, and instead of friendly talk, they sat in dour silence, each  regarding the other as an insufferable nuisance.</p>
  <p>The  cynical French proverb anent women was, without doubt, very applicable to them  both in the present case, and it might have been some gratification to Victoria&rsquo;s  wounded pride to know that she had effectually estranged these two quondam  friends. The bond of sympathy formerly existing between them had entirely  vanished, and though each was burning to make a confidant of the other, yet  neither would make the first advance, so both sat grimly silent, each cursing  his luck in having the other for a companion.</p>
  <p>Otterburn  did not venture to speak to Eustace about his rejection by Victoria, as he was  afraid of being laughed at by the cynic, and Eustace held his tongue concerning  his passion for his cousin&rsquo;s wife, as he thought, and with good reason, that  Otterburn would consider it dishonourable. It was the quick coupled with the  dead, and they both felt it, so when they reached Venice, although they put up  together at Danieli&rsquo;s, by tacit consent they saw as little of one another as  possible.</p>
  <p>To  his great delight Otterburn picked up an old Oxford chum one day, and finding  that he was going on a shooting excursion to the Carpathian Mountains with  another friend, agreed to join him. To this desertion, Eustace by no means  objected, as he was heartily sick of Macjean&rsquo;s love-lorn sulkiness, so, at the  end of the week, the young man, with his two friends, keen sportsmen and  capital company, left Eustace in Venice, and departed in high spirits on his  excursion.</p>
  <p>Eustace  therefore was left entirely alone, and preferred his solitude, for had he so  chosen he could have found plenty of pleasant companions willing to go to  Cyprus if needful, but having a fancy for a solitary journey, and the idea of a  new book of travels in his head, he held aloof from Anglo-Italian society and  wandered about Venice with no other company than his own dreary thoughts.</p>
  <p>Fate,  however, evidently had a spite against Mr. Gartney, for one day, while he was  sitting at Florian&rsquo;s, smoking cigarettes and watching the white pigeons  whirling aloft in the blue sky, someone touched him on the shoulder, and on  turning he found himself facing Billy Dolser, a dapper little man-about-town,  whom he particularly disliked.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Dolser owned a spiteful society paper called &ldquo;The Pepper Box,&rdquo; which was always  getting into trouble for the lies it told, and Eustace himself had been pretty  severely handled in its columns, as the proprietor hated him with all the  malignant venom of a little soul. Everybody in society was afraid of Billy, who  had an unpleasant knack of finding out things people did not want known, and  publishing them in his paper, so everyone was civil to him, except one or two  men who had the bad taste to horsewhip him, but Billy did not mind, as it made  his paper sell, so there was positively no way of society ridding itself of  this little wasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do, Gartney?&rdquo; said Mr. Dolser, offering two fingers to Eustace, which that  gentleman refused to see. &ldquo;Heard you were here&mdash;yes! Cut away from town I  suppose because of your book? No! we thought you did. You&rsquo;re getting it hot&mdash;rather!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  hanged if I care,&rdquo; retorted Eustace indolently, &ldquo;it will only make the book  sell. How&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Pepper Box&rsquo; going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  capitally&mdash;yes!&rdquo; said Billy, taking a seat. &ldquo;Three actions of libel on&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  sounds well&mdash;any horsewhippings?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy  grinned, not being a bit offended at this allusion, as it all came under the  head of business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear boy, no! I&rsquo;m here with the Pellingers you know&mdash;yes! Showing them round.  They&rsquo;re paying my ex&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t pay them yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  but they like travelling with me&mdash;yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t care about a pet monkey myself,&rdquo; said Eustace rudely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  you&rsquo;re a Robinson Crusoe kind of chap, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Billy, quite unmoved by  his epithet. &ldquo;By the way, I saw your cousin and his wife in Paris&mdash;yes! Wife cut  me. Beastly rude I think, when I knew her father so well&mdash;he was a great friend  of mine&mdash;rather!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a very creditable thing to boast of,&rdquo; replied Eustace, enraged at this  reference to Lady Errington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  who cares? If Asmodeus unroofed the houses in town, you bet there&rsquo;d be &lsquo;ructions.  Just so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do your best to play Asmodeus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;want  to purify Society. By the way, Mrs. Veilsturm was asking after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  kind of her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Major Griff. I wonder Society tolerates those two, Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Society tolerates all kinds of noxious beasts now-a-days,&rdquo; said Eustace, with a  significant glance at Billy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  horrid, isn&rsquo;t it? Those two have got hold of Dolly Thambits, you know&mdash;young  fool that came in for a lot of money&mdash;rather. She&rsquo;s plucking him, and the Major  is pocketing the feathers&mdash;yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you share the spoil?&rdquo; asked Eustace drily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  wish I could, but Mrs. Veilsturm doesn&rsquo;t like me&mdash;not much! I say, look here,  where do you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business,&rdquo; retorted Eustace, rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell you my movements  and have them recorded in that scurrilous paper of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Billy calmly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a pity, because they&rsquo;re all curious about you in  town&mdash;yes. Never mind, I&rsquo;ll say I met you at Venice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  say I dropped you into the Grand Canal also, if you don&rsquo;t mind your own  business,&rdquo; growled Gartney wrathfully, moving towards him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  I don&rsquo;t care. Anything for a paragraph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  impudence of the little man so tickled Eustace that he burst out laughing, and  without carrying out his threat, walked away, while Mr. Dolser, pulling out his  note-book, dotted down a few remarks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  get two columns out of him,&rdquo; he said to himself in a gratified tone. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s  staying at Danieli&rsquo;s I know, so I&rsquo;ll look up his valet and find out where he&rsquo;s  off to&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Which  Mr. Dolser did, and the result appeared in an abusive article a fortnight  afterwards in &ldquo;The Pepper Box&rdquo; headed &ldquo;Gartney&rsquo;s Gaddings&rdquo; which several of the  poet&rsquo;s friends enjoyed very much.</p>
  <p>As  for Eustace, after getting rid of Billy Dolser, he went off to his hotel, and  arranged all about his departure for Cyprus, anxious to get away at once so as  to avoid another meeting with the proprietor of &ldquo;The Pepper Box.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Consequently  next day be found himself on board an Austrian-Lloyd steamer, slowly steaming  down the Adriatic into the shadow of the coming night, and as he stood on the  deck with the salt wind blowing in his face, he murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that chapter of my life is closed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was wrong, for that chapter of his life had just opened.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    A Maiden Lady</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Severe,  sedate, and highly bred,<br>
    Sad-tinted gown and cap on head.<br>
    In high-backed chair she grimly sits,<br>
    And frowns, and fumes, and talks, and knits,<br>
    Her nephews, nieces, tremble still,<br>
    Whene&rsquo;er she talks about her will,<br>
    And wonder oft in glad surmise<br>
    What they will get at her demise.<br>
    No King upon his throne in State<br>
    Was ever such a potentate.<br>
    Let others face her eye&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,<br>
    I quail before my maiden aunt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Few  people are acquainted with Delphson Square, no doubt from the fact that it lies  on the extreme edge of the great vortex of London life, isolated in a great  measure by its position and character. Those concerned with business or  pleasure know not this severely respectable neighbourhood, but occasionally men  and women, weary of the restless excitability of the metropolis, glance off  from the huge central whirl, and drift helplessly into this haven of rest in  order to spend the rest of their days in peace.</p>
  <p>Not  a tempting place certainly, with its four sides of forbidding-looking houses  painted a dull brown, with grim iron balconies attached to each window like  prison gratings. No bright flowers in oblong boxes to lighten the austerity of  these conventual retreats, flowers being regarded as frivolous by the  utilitarian inhabitants of the square. Spotless white blinds, heavy dark-red  curtains, occasionally a cage in some glaring window, containing a depressed-looking  canary, irreproachable white steps, exasperatingly bright brass knockers on  massive doors; these were the principal adornment of the four rows of  dwellings.</p>
  <p>In  the centre of the small quadrangle grew a quincunx of heavy-foliaged elms,  encircled by a spiky iron fence of defiant appearance, and under one of the  trees a weather-stained statue of some dead and gone warrior, with a suitable  inscription in choice Latin, which no one could read. Over all this prim  locality an air of Sabbath quiet.</p>
  <p>The  doors of the houses always seemed to be closed. Rarely were any signs of life  seen behind the half screens of the windows, the well-swept streets were empty  both of traffic and pedestrians, and viewed under a dull, leaden-coloured  London sky, with a humid feeling in the air, Delphson Square looked like some  deserted city waiting to be re-peopled.</p>
  <p>As  to the inhabitants, they mostly resembled their dwellings, being elderly, grim,  and forbidding, dressed in the plainest puritanical fashion, yet one and all stamped  with the impress of wealth.</p>
  <p>Sad  tints but rich stuffs, serious faces with port-wine complexions, little  jewellery, but what there was, massive in the extreme&mdash;no ostentation, but a  quietly-prosperous air, telling of snug banking accounts. Respectable-looking  carriages, with fat horses and still fatter coachmen, at the grim doors every  morning to take them drives in the Park. A general air of subdued religion  about the place&mdash;they were all Broad Church, and held strong opinions about the  ritual. No newspaper admitted into the square except the <i>Times</i>, which  was heavy and respectable, hansoms unknown, even the sweeper who swept the  crossings was serious-minded and given to dreary hymns in wet weather.  Everybody went to bed at nine o&rsquo;clock and rose at the same time in the morning;  the tradesmen were always punctual and deferential, and the clocks were never  out of order.</p>
  <p>Miss  Angelica Corbin lived in this delightful locality, and, as her residence there  dated from the early part of the Victorian age, she was regarded as one of the  oldest inhabitants.</p>
  <p>A  maiden lady of uncertain age and certain income, her life was conducted in a  methodical fashion, which enabled her in a great measure to defy Time. As Miss  Corbin was ten years ago she was at present, and would in all human probability  be at the end of another decade. Quite at variance with the new-fangled ways of  the present generation, this old gentlewoman looked like some disdainful  spectre of a sedate past, solitary amid a frivolous present.</p>
  <p>Her  room, old-fashioned and changeless as herself, had about it the aroma of a  former generation, when D&rsquo;Orsay led the fashions, and people were still talking  about Lord Byron, Waterloo, and the Reform Bill.</p>
  <p>Situated  on the ground floor above the basement, it had three windows of small-paned  glass looking out on to the dreary square, and was large and airy, having an  oval roof painted with designs of flowers, fruit, birds, and butterflies.</p>
  <p>Under  this cheerful ceiling a remarkably comfortable room, furnished in an antique style.  Warm-coloured Turkish carpet, rather threadbare in places, woolly mats of  different tints, heavy mahogany chairs and sofa, with slippery horsehair  coverings; a solid-looking table of the same wood, draped with dark-green  cloth; out-of-date piano, rigid against the wall, with faded drawn blue silk  and tassels above its yellow ivory keys. An ancient fireplace with elaborate  brass dogs between which generally blazed a fire of logs (no coal for Miss  Corbin, as she thought it detestable), and a massively-carved mantelpiece with  quaint ornaments of Dresden china, in front of a gold-framed mirror swathed in  green gauze.</p>
  <p>On  the left-hand side of the fireplace a tall book-case, with glass doors, fitting  into a shallow recess and surmounted by a plaster of Paris bust of Shakespeare,  imprisoned first editions of books popular in their owner&rsquo;s youth, editions  priceless to bibliomaniacs. These, though now worth their weight in gold, never  saw the light of day.</p>
  <p>On  the red-papered walls, smoky-looking oil pictures in tarnished frames, one or  two yellow samplers, worked by dead and gone school-girls; on the table wax  flowers, Berlin wool mats, and velvet-bound Books of Beauty, from whose faded  pages simpered large-eyed beauties of the Dudu type; on the floor treacherous  footstools, always in the way, and a long bead-worked cushion, elevated on six  square mahogany legs, in front of the brass fender. Here and there gaudy  porcelain jars filled with withered rose-leaves and dried lavender, which gave  forth a faint, dreamy odour, redolent of bygone days and vanished summers.</p>
  <p>Surrounded  by all this faded splendour, in a straight-backed chair placed by the  fire-side, her feet resting on a foot-stool, and constantly knitting, sat Miss  Angelica Corbin, better known to her friends and relations as Aunt Jelly.</p>
  <p>Tall,  stiff and commanding, with rigid features, cold grey eyes, iron-grey hair,  always dressed in the same kind of silken slate-coloured gown, with a dainty  lace apron, lace cap, China crape shawl on her shoulders, lisle thread mittens,  and old-fashioned rings on her withered hands, she never changed in the  smallest degree.</p>
  <p>Her  father had been a very wealthy man, connected with the H.E.I.C.S., and on his  death left his property equally divided between his three daughters, Jane,  Angelica, and Marian, the first and the last of whom married respectively Sir  Frederick Errington and Mr. Martin Gartney. Both sisters and their husbands had  long since departed this life, leaving Guy Errington and Eustace Gartney, who  thus stood in the relation of nephews to Miss Corbin.</p>
  <p>That  lady had never married, which did not seem strange to those who knew her at  present, but without doubt she must have been a handsome woman in her youth,  and presumably had had her romance, like the rest of her sex. As a matter of  fact, she had been engaged to marry Harry Sheldon, the father of her ward, but  owing to some misunderstanding, an explanation of which was forbidden by the  pride of both, they separated, and Sheldon went out to seek his fortune in  Australia, where in due course he married Miss Macjean, and Miss Corbin,  devoting herself to perpetual maidenhood, had removed to Delphson Square, where  she had remained ever since.</p>
  <p>Having  a handsome income well invested in the Funds, Miss Corbin lived in excellent albeit  old-fashioned style, and, in spite of her apparent hardness and brusque manner,  was not an ungenerous woman. When her old lover, dying in Australia, sent home  his orphan child to her guardianship, she had promptly accepted the charge, and  loved the girl for the sake of that dead and buried romance which was still  fresh in her heart. To Victoria she was strict but kind, and the presence of  this bright young girl made a pleasant variety in her dull, methodical life,  although she never, by word or deed, betrayed such a weakness.</p>
  <p>Hard  she undoubtedly was, and but little given to sentimental feelings, which was a  great grief to her companion, Miss Minnie Pelch, who was tender-hearted in the  extreme, and had oceans of tears on every possible occasion, from a wedding to  a funeral.</p>
  <p>Miss  Pelch was a weak, soulful creature, the daughter of a clergyman who had been  curate at Denfield, a village near Errington Hall. The Rev. Pelch was a  widower, and his sole offspring was the fair Minnie, but having only a small income,  he saved nothing: so when he died she was left destitute, with a doubtful  future before her. She had not enough brains for a governess, no talents except  a pretty taste in poetry, which was not a marketable commodity, and no beauty  to attract marriageable young men, so Minnie wept over the mistake of having  been born, and Heaven only knows what would have become of her had not Miss  Corbin, like a kind-hearted vulture, swooped down on the poor creature and  taken her up to London as her companion.</p>
  <p>So  Minnie was provided for by brusque Aunt Jelly, although no one ever knew what a  trial she was to that sensible old lady, for Miss Pelch was one of those  exasperatingly limp creatures who always pose as martyrs, and shed tears at the  least thing.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly was not unkind by nature, but sometimes the tearful Minnie was too much  for her endurance, and if she could have got rid of her she certainly would  have had small hesitation in doing so. But there was no chance of this coming  to pass, as Minnie was one of those meek creatures who rest where they are  thrown, so Miss Corbin, regarding her as a necessary cross, did the best she  could to put up with her tears, her milk-and-water conversation and her  longings after fame.</p>
  <p>Fame!  yes! this invertebrate creature, whose intellect was of the smallest, had  actually written a book of poems after the style of L.E.L., in which she  compared herself to &ldquo;a withered leaf on the tree of life.&rdquo; She had several  times inflicted these weak rhymes, in which mountain rhymed to fountain, and  dove to love, on Miss Jelly, but that stout old dame snorted disdainfully at  her companion&rsquo;s poetical fancies, whereupon Minnie retired with her manuscript,  sat in the twilight, and wished herself dead.</p>
  <p>When  Eustace visited his aunt, Minnie always attacked him about the publication of  her poems, and Eustace, the cynical, the bitter, the scornful, actually read  her poor little rhymes and promised to see what he could do with them, which  proved that a good deal of his cynicism was only skin deep. Perhaps he was  forced into this promise by Aunt Jelly, who thought if Minnie could only get  her drivel published she would perhaps hold her tongue for the rest of her  life, but this hope seemed too good to be realised.</p>
  <p>Miss  Pelch had a thin drooping figure, a pensive face with pale skin, pale eyebrows,  pale eyes, pale lips, in fact she was all pallid, and wore her thin brown hair  in girlish curls, with two drooping over her ears after the style of those  called &ldquo;kiss-me-quicks.&rdquo; She generally wore an ancient black silk dress, with  lace cuffs and lace collar fastened by a large brooch containing the portrait  (done in oil by a village artist) of her late father.</p>
  <p>Seated  at the window, in the dull light of an October day, Miss Fetch, having been  worsted in an encounter with Aunt Jelly over the question of reading one of her  effusions, was drooping like a withered flower over the manuscript, and could  hardly read her own scratchy writing for tears.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly was is her usual place, sitting bolt upright, with her woolly-haired  poodle, Coriolanus, at her feet, and no sound disturbed the quiet save an  occasional patter of Minnie&rsquo;s tears, or the vicious clicking of Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s  needles. On the table in the centre of the room were decanters of port and  sherry and a plate of cake, for Miss Corbin was expecting her nephew, Guy, and  his wife, to call on her that afternoon, the young couple having just arrived  from the Continent, and always gave her visitors wine in preference to tea,  which she characterised tersely as &ldquo;wash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Corbin opened her mouth once or twice to make a remark, but, casting an angry  glance at the tearful Minnie, shut it again without uttering a sound, and  knitted with redoubled fury. At last her stoicism could hold out no longer, and  she called out in her strong, clear voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Minnie, stop crying. There&rsquo;s plenty of rain outside, without you  bringing it into the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, Miss Jelly,&rdquo; said Minnie meekly, and drying her eyes, she slipped her  poem into her pocket and sat with folded hands, looking as if she carried the  weight of the world on her round shoulders.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly looked at her keenly for a moment, and then issued another command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  here, child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minnie  rose to her feet and drifted across the room, for her mode of getting about  could hardly be called walking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mustn&rsquo;t cry because I don&rsquo;t listen to your poetry,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly grimly. &ldquo;I  hate poetry&mdash;it&rsquo;s all rubbish, and I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t stand it. But I daresay  your poetry&rsquo;s all right&mdash;it sounds sing-songy enough. Wait till Mr. Gartney  comes home, and then you can read it to him. I&rsquo;ve no doubt it&rsquo;s as good as his  own. Now take a glass of port, and stop your whimpering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, Miss Jelly,&rdquo; said Minnie&rsquo; in a frightened tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Miss Minnie,&rdquo;  mimicked the old lady fiercely. &ldquo;Do what I tell you&mdash;it will put some blood into  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tea!&rdquo;  began Miss Pelch nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tea!  wash!&rdquo; snorted Aunt Jelly disdainfully, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no strength in tea, girl. You  might as well drink vinegar. Your blood&rsquo;s like water; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know how  your father reared you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father  was a vegetarian,&rdquo; volunteered Minnie, in mild triumph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a pretty example you are of the system,&rdquo; retorted Miss Corbin. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t  keep my eye on you I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d eat meat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  so strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  more than you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Pargowker&mdash;&rdquo; began Miss Pelch once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prescribes iron, I know all about  that,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly wrathfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hold with drugs, I never did. Meat  and port wine is what you want and what you&rsquo;ve got to take. Hold your tongue  and do what I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  adjured Minnie did not dare to disobey, and although she hated wine, dutifully  swallowed a glass of old port, which was so strong that it made her cough. The  revivifying effect was soon seen in the colour which came into her pale cheeks,  proving that Aunt Jelly was right in her prescription, as a long girlhood of  vegetarianism had weakened the Pelch system.</p>
  <p>Minnie  now feeling better sat down and took up her work, which consisted in crocheting  antimacassars, a mode of employing time of which Aunt Jelly approved. Indeed,  the industrious Miss Pelch had manufactured enough antimacassars to stock a  bazaar, and she was constantly at work on them except when she took a turn at  talking, for Miss Corbin would not allow her to knit, that being her own  special weakness. The two sat working in silence for a few minutes, Miss Jelly  grim and repellent as the Sphinx and Minnie weakly gay, as the wine had  slightly affected her brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Minnie,&rdquo;  said Aunt Jelly suddenly, pointing to the table with one lean finger, &ldquo;wipe  your glass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, Miss Jelly,&rdquo; responded Miss Pelch with her invariable formula, and  thereupon arose from her seat and having wiped the glass with a duster which  she took from a drawer, replaced the glass on the tray, folded up and put away  the duster, then returned to her chair and antimacassar in meek silence.</p>
  <p>Silence,  however, did not suit Aunt Jelly, who liked to be amused, so she gave Minnie  the last letter she had received from Victoria and made her read it, keeping up  a running comment on the contents meanwhile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Liked  Rome did she!&mdash;humph! nothing but pictures and priests no doubt. Cooking wasn&rsquo;t  good. Of course not, all oil and garlic. Mr. Trubbles ill! pity that fool doesn&rsquo;t  die&mdash;not much loss about him I should think. Wait a bit, Minnie, till I count  the heel of this stocking. One, two, three, four&mdash;go on, I can listen&mdash;ten,  eleven, twelve. My nephew gone to Cyprus&mdash;twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two&mdash;he&rsquo;s  always going to some out-of-the-way place&mdash;forty-five, forty-six. He&rsquo;ll end up  by being eaten by cannibals&mdash;fifty-three! Humph! I hope his new book will be  more respectable than the last one. Eh! The Master of Otterburn. Who is he?  Never heard of him. Coming back by Naples!&mdash;how can they come back by Naples.  Oh! the steamer, yes! I hope Victoria won&rsquo;t flirt with all the young men on  board. Perhaps she&rsquo;ll be sea-sick. That&rsquo;ll take all the nonsense out of her. Is  that all?&mdash;dear me, these girls can&rsquo;t write a letter now-a-days. Here, give it  to me back. You read so quietly, I can&rsquo;t hear half you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  terrible old woman seized the letter and put it away, frowning on Minnie  meanwhile, that damsel having meekly resumed her antimacassar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four  o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Miss Corbin, as the clock struck the hour, &ldquo;they should be here  by now, but none of you young people are punctual now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  they&rsquo;ve been detained,&rdquo; expostulated Minnie timidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  snapped Miss Jelly wrathfully. &ldquo;Why should they be detained? They&rsquo;ve been two  days in town already. Gadding about I daresay. I don&rsquo;t think much of his wife,  but whatever she is he&rsquo;s worse. I don&rsquo;t know however I came to have such a  nephew. He hasn&rsquo;t got his mother&rsquo;s brains. That comes of having an idiot for a  father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s courteous conversation was interrupted by a ring at  the door, and Miss Pelch being sent to the window to reconnoitre returned with  the information that it was Sir Guy and Lady Errington.</p>
  <p>Miss  Corbin drew her shawl carefully round her angular shoulder, laid her knitting  on her lap, and having dismissed Minnie to a distant corner of the room, where  she sat in the shadow like an unhappy ghost, was prepared to receive company.</p>
  <p>Bickles,  the fat, pompous butler of the establishment, threw open the door of the room  and announced in a deep voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Guy and Lady Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  the young couple entered into the presence of the old dragon.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s Opinion</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;All  speech is silver, silence gold<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I wish it were on some occasions),<br>
    For though unpleasant to be told,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get the truth from your relations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anyone  hostile towards matrimony, seeing Sir Guy in the character of a newly-returned  bridegroom, would certainly have said that marriage was not a failure in his  case, for he looked wonderfully bright and happy as he presented his wife to  Aunt Jelly.</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington, on the other hand, still preserved her appearance of fragility and  her air of calmness, forming with her reposeful manner a great contrast to her  husband, who was bubbling over with excitement and looked like a happy  schoolboy out on his holiday.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  we are, Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; he said in his loud, hearty voice, kissing his elderly  relation, &ldquo;back from foreign parts and glad to be home once more. Don&rsquo;t you  think Alizon is looking well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; replied Aunt Jelly sharply, with a keen look at the young  couple. &ldquo;Come here, my dear, and give me a kiss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alizon  had a horror of feminine embraces, and always skilfully avoided demonstrative  friends, but from this direct command there was no possibility of escaping, so  she submitted to the ordeal with the best grace she could and then took her  seat near Miss Corbin, while Guy went to the end of the room to shake hands  with Minnie Pelch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Miss Pelch, and how are you? Jolly, eh!&mdash;ah, that&rsquo;s right. Been writing any more  poetry? By Jove, you&rsquo;re quite a literary person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minnie  smiled faintly at this compliment and glanced rather disapprovingly at Guy, who  was far too healthy and English-looking to resemble her favourite heroes of the  Manfred-Lara type, who all had pale faces, raven hair, and no morals. Guy,  however, having done his duty towards his aunt&rsquo;s companion, wandered back to  that redoubtable lady and sat down by his wife.</p>
  <p>Being  thus placed before the judge, Aunt Jelly commenced to cross-examine them both  in her own brusque way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Guy,&rdquo; she said, resuming her knitting, &ldquo;now you&rsquo;ve idled away so many months on  the Continent, I hope you&rsquo;ve come back to look after your property once more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I have, aunt. We would have been back long ago, but Alizon was in love  with the Italian lakes. Weren&rsquo;t you, Alizon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I thought they were very beautiful,&rdquo; replied Alizon, who, being a comparative  stranger to Aunt Jelly, hardly knew how to speak in a way congenial to that  lady, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid it is a very lotos-eating place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  remarked the old gentlewoman, with a sharp glance, &ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t like  lotos-eating.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I think life means something more than idleness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  Heaven&rsquo;s sake, child, understand the value of being idle. Don&rsquo;t become a woman  with a mission. It&rsquo;s a most detestable class&mdash;clatter, clatter, chatter,  chatter! They do more harm than good, in my opinion, but then I&rsquo;m an old woman  and my ideas are much behind those of to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much chance of my becoming a woman with a mission,&rdquo; replied  Lady Errington, smiling, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not my nature, nor do I think Guy admires them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove! no,&rdquo; said Sir Guy, energetically; &ldquo;those women who turn themselves into  feminine men&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say I care for them at all. They worry a fellow&rsquo;s life out  with their preachings. My ideal of a woman is&mdash;my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington&rsquo;s eyes smiled a grateful recognition of this compliment, and even  Aunt Jelly, who hated a display of any demonstrative affection, was not  ill-pleased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; she said grimly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see a husband appreciate his wife, &lsquo;tis  such a novelty now-a-days, they generally appreciate someone else&rsquo;s.  By-the-way, child, you don&rsquo;t look very strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think so, aunt?&rdquo; said Guy in alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  too pale&mdash;far too pale. Have you got any blood, child? Oh, of course, you say  you have. Sick people always do. You must eat more and take port wine. Guy,  pour your wife out a glass of port.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  obediently did as he was told, but Alizon protested against being made to drink  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  really very strong, Miss Corbin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt  Jelly,&rdquo; interrupted the old lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Aunt Jelly, I look delicate, but I&rsquo;m not&mdash;I am&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind what you are. Drink up the port. You&rsquo;re as bad as Minnie. Bless the child,  do you think I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s good for people? Teetotalism fudge? It all  comes of adulterated drinks, though I daresay there&rsquo;s a good deal of truth in  it. But a glass of good port is what you want and what you&rsquo;ve got to take.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alizon,  anxious to please the old lady on her first visit, did as she was told, and then,  after making Guy drink some sherry, Aunt Jelly proceeded to talk about  Victoria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  we met her abroad,&rdquo; said Lady Errington, sipping her wine, &ldquo;a very charming  girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  her father was such a handsome man,&rdquo; answered Aunt Jelly, with a secret thought  of her dead and done with romance. &ldquo;I never saw her mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was a Macjean, I believe,&rdquo; said Guy indolently, &ldquo;at least Otterburn said  something about his family being mixed up with hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly raised her head like an old war-horse at the sound of a trumpet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Otterburn!  Otterburn! Who is he?&rdquo; she demanded sharply. &ldquo;Someone Victoria has been  flirting with, I suppose. I never heard of him, though she does mention him in  her letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  new to town,&rdquo; explained her nephew carelessly, &ldquo;the eldest son of Lord Dunkeld.  Angus Macjean, you know, his title is the Master of Otterburn. A very nice boy  and awfully in love with Victoria.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  is he? And I daresay Victoria encouraged him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; interposed Lady Errington, seeing a rising storm in Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s frown, &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think she went as far as that, but you know, Aunt Jelly, Victoria is very  pretty and the boy could hardly help admiring her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I daresay she wasn&rsquo;t blind to his admiration,&rdquo; said Miss Corbin viciously; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s  pretty, no doubt, but after all beauty is only skin deep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  weak giggle coming out of the dark corner showed that Minnie agreed with her,  whereupon Aunt Jelly, who never permitted any familiarities, vented her anger  on Miss Pelch at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you sniffling for, Minnie?&rdquo; she called out. &ldquo;Come here and show yourself.  This is my niece, Lady Errington, and this is Miss Pelch, my dear. Her father  was curate at Denfield.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do?&rdquo; said Alizon kindly, feeling sorry for the blushing Minnie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard about you from my husband. You write poetry, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  affirmative snort from Aunt Jelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Minnie, &ldquo;I do write poetry sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Mr. Gartney told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Eustace,&rdquo; cried Aunt Jelly significantly, &ldquo;where is he now? Guy, don&rsquo;t go to sleep!  Where is your cousin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; retorted Guy, who had closed his eyes for a moment. &ldquo;Gone to  Cyprus, or some out of-the-way place. Hasn&rsquo;t he written to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  he ever write letters?&rdquo; demanded Aunt Jelly in an exasperated tone. &ldquo;No! he  keeps all his scribblings for the public.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he does write beautifully,&rdquo; said Minnie, clasping her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  that&rsquo;s a matter of opinion,&rdquo; responded Aunt Jelly doubtfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as  blasphemous as Lord Byron, without any of his genius. He&rsquo;s more like that Lalla  Rookh man that wrote such dreadful things under the name of Little. Don&rsquo;t be  afraid, child, I&rsquo;m not going to quote them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gartney is a very charming talker,&rdquo; said Alizon quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  me, child, you&rsquo;ve got a good word to say for everyone,&rdquo; remarked Aunt Jelly,  with a benevolent scowl. &ldquo;He certainly does talk well. It&rsquo;s almost a lost art  now-a-days. Men and women don&rsquo;t talk, they drivel about their own virtues and  their friends&rsquo; faults. But Eustace!&mdash;well, yes, he&rsquo;s more amusing than you, Guy;  you, my dear, have got all your goods in the shop window. Good appearance, but  no brains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy,  being used to Miss Corbin&rsquo;s plain speaking, roared with laughter at this  flattering description, but Alizon felt indignant at her good-looking,  kind-hearted husband being thus decried, and spoke out boldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a very good thing&mdash;for Guy,&rdquo; said the old dame grimly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take up the  cudgels on your husband&rsquo;s account, my dear, he&rsquo;s big enough to look after  himself. After all, he has a better heart than Eustace, and he doesn&rsquo;t write  poetry, which is a blessing. We must always be thankful for small mercies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minnie  felt rather indignant at this indirect shaft, but stood too much in awe of Miss  Corbin to venture a remonstrance, so after a pause, during which Aunt Jelly  eyed the trio like an elderly beldame of romance, Lady Errington continued the  conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we must allow some latitude to genius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Genius!&rdquo;  scoffed Aunt Jelly, picking up a stitch she had dropped. &ldquo;My dear, in my young  days every farthing rush-light did not call itself the sun. Eustace is clever  in a nasty find-faulty way, I admit, but he&rsquo;s not a genius. He ought to give up  writing abusive books, and marry, but there&mdash;if he did he&rsquo;d worry the best woman  that ever breathed into her grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  sings beautifully, at all events,&rdquo; said Lady Errington, feeling rather  nonplussed as to how to satisfy this contradictory woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  bless my soul, child I don&rsquo;t go through a list of my nephew&rsquo;s virtues. I know  them already, and from the best authority&mdash;himself. When he returns from this  tree place&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;Cyprus&mdash;yes, I knew it had something to do with  a tree. Well, when he returns, I hope he&rsquo;ll be improved&mdash;there&rsquo;s room for it,  great room. Guy, when do you go down to Denfield?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,  aunt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  sensible. Errington Hall needs a master&rsquo;s eyes. I don&rsquo;t believe in absenteeism  myself. If I had my way&mdash;which I&rsquo;m not likely to have, because it&rsquo;s too sensible&mdash;I&rsquo;d  pack all landlords back to their estates in the country instead of letting them  waste their money in London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what would London do without them?&rdquo; asked Alizon, much amused at this new view  of the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  better,&rdquo; retorted Aunt Jelly, sharply. &ldquo;In my young days, before steam and  electricity upset everything, people stayed in their own houses. But now  everyone comes up to London. A cake&rsquo;s no good if the currants are all in one  place. Scatter them, and it&rsquo;s an improvement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a good deal of truth in what you say,&rdquo; remarked Alizon, quietly. &ldquo;If literary  men and musicians, for instance, made little centres of art and letters all  over the three kingdoms, it would be more beneficial in every way than  centralising everything in London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Literature!  Bah!&rdquo; said Miss Corbin, with scorn; &ldquo;milk-and-water novels about religion and  society, bilious essays, and fault-finding critics&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you call  literature now-a-days. As for music, I don&rsquo;t know much about it. &lsquo;The Maiden&rsquo;s  Prayer&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Battle of Prague&rsquo; were thought good enough when I was young. But  now it&rsquo;s all systems and theories, and what they call sixths and sevenths. A  very good name, too,&rdquo; concluded the old lady, grimly, &ldquo;for the whole lot of  them do seem at sixes and sevens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you see, everything is improving,&rdquo; said Guy, meekly, not having any idea about  what he was talking, but only making a vain endeavour to stay Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s  rancorous tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more than manners are,&rdquo; replied the old lady, tartly. &ldquo;Minnie, don&rsquo;t twiddle  your fingers so. It annoys me. Humph! so you&rsquo;re going down to Errington to play  the Lord of the Manor and your wife Lady Bountiful. Mind you take care of  yourself, my dear; the mists down there are very bad for the throat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think they are bad, Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; expostulated Guy, indignant that she  should try to prejudice Alizon against her future home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you think about nothing!&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, coolly. &ldquo;I tell you the place is  unhealthy. Bless the man, don&rsquo;t I know what I&rsquo;m talking about? Look at that  girl,&rdquo; pointing to the shrinking Minnie, who was dreadfully upset at having  public attention thus drawn to her&mdash;&ldquo;she&rsquo;s lived all her life at Denfield, and  what has she had? Measles, whooping-cough, neuralgia; she was a pale rickety  mass of disease when she came to me. What built her up? Port wine. I tell you  the place is unhealthy, and mind you take plenty of port wine and beef tea,  Alizon, or you&rsquo;ll go out some day like the snuff of a candle. I&rsquo;ve seen several  of your sort go that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo;  cried Guy, rising to his feet in a rage, &ldquo;how can you speak so! Hang it all!  talk of something more cheerful. I didn&rsquo;t bring my wife here to be frightened  out of her wits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  nonsense! Don&rsquo;t you get angry,&rdquo; said the old lady, quite pleased at upsetting  her good-tempered nephew, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of being an old woman if you can&rsquo;t  say what you like? Well, go down home at once, and perhaps next year I&rsquo;ll pay  you a visit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder you&rsquo;re not afraid of dying in such an unhealthy place,&rdquo; said Guy,  scornfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you be afraid. I shan&rsquo;t afford you that gratification for some time yet,&rdquo;  answered Aunt Jelly malignantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a creaking door. They hang long, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye,  Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; said Alizon, holding out her hand to Miss Corbin, for she felt she  could not stand this terrible old woman any longer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and see you when  I&rsquo;m next in town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  that means if you&rsquo;ve got ten minutes to spare,&rdquo; growled the old lady, kissing  Lady Errington&rsquo;s soft cheek. &ldquo;Well! well! go on. The old are always neglected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  wouldn&rsquo;t be if they were a little more pleasant,&rdquo; said Guy, still indignant, as  he said goodbye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you young folks expect to find life all honey, but there&rsquo;s a good deal of  vinegar in it. I dare say you&rsquo;ll grow tired of one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy,  who was at the door with his wife, turned round at this, and called out in a  rage:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  we won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard better men than you say the same thing, but it always came to pass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  won&rsquo;t in this case, so your kind heart will be disappointed for once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time Minnie Pelch had escorted Lady Errington to the hall door, and Sir  Guy was about to follow after his parting shot, but the redoubtable Aunt Jelly  was not one to give in without a struggle, and would have the last word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  away! go away!&rdquo; she said, furiously&mdash;&ldquo;go away and learn manners.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly won&rsquo;t come to you for the teaching,&rdquo; retorted Guy, in great heat. &ldquo;Goodbye,  Aunt Jelly, and I hope you&rsquo;ll be in a more Christian spirit next time we come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  closed the door after him so as to give her no opportunity of replying, and  Aunt Jelly thus being beaten, felt in an exceedingly bad temper. She fought  with every one who came to the house, and crushed all except Eustace, whose  cool sarcasm was too much for her, but this unexpected resistance of the  dutiful Guy surprised her, and she was not ill-pleased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t think he had so much spirit,&rdquo; she chuckled, as she resumed her knitting.  &ldquo;It comes from his mother, I&rsquo;ll be bound. Jane always had a fine temper of her  own and, was twice the man her milksop of a husband was. Well, well! I&rsquo;m glad  Guy can speak his mind. He hasn&rsquo;t much to speak, poor fool; still it&rsquo;s better  than nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  fact, the old lady was so pleased with Guy&rsquo;s rebellion on behalf of his wife  that she became quite good-tempered, and Minnie, on her return, found her  patroness for once in her life an amiable companion.</p>
  <p>As  for Guy and his wife, when they were both snugly ensconced in their carriage  and driving back to the hotel, both of them laughed heartily over the visit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  she an old cat?&rdquo; said Guy, wiping the tears from his eyes; &ldquo;she fights like the  devil! It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve had a row with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry it was on my account, Guy,&rdquo; observed Alizon, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you bother your head, my dear,&rdquo; he replied coolly, patting her hand; &ldquo;if it  hadn&rsquo;t been you it would have been someone else. If Aunt Jelly hadn&rsquo;t a row  every now and then she&rsquo;d die. I wish to Heaven she would, and then I&rsquo;d get her  money!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Guy, how can you speak so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? We need the money badly enough, I&rsquo;m sure. She only wastes it on churches  and orphans&rsquo; homes. I wish to Heaven I was an orphan; Aunt Jelly might take  some interest in me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you are an orphan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but that&rsquo;s not the genuine article. Aunt Jelly loves a snivelling,  alone-in-the-world brat who needs reforming. A titled orphan like myself is no  fun. I can&rsquo;t harrow her soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did your best to do so just now,&rdquo; said Alizon, laughing. Sir Guy echoed her  laughter, and when they arrived at their hotel both of them came to the  conclusion that they had passed a very pleasant afternoon.</p>

  <p>Sir  Guy was humming this gruesome ballad as the train neared Denfield Station,  where news of their arrival had already preceded them, and the Errington  tenantry, in a state of high excitement, were waiting to welcome the young  couple home.</p>
  <p>Blithe  and happy, with a faint roseate tinge in her pale cheeks, arising from a  natural feeling of anticipation, Alizon sat opposite to her husband, who was  gazing fondly at her, and the glint of her golden hair and the whiteness of her  skin set him thinking of that weird old ballad, sung to him in childish days by  an old Scotch nurse full of the haunting superstitions of the North.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  on earth are you muttering about, Guy?&rdquo; asked Alizon, in a puzzled tone, as she  heard him crooning this melancholy strain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  an old song about a bride&rsquo;s home-coming,&rdquo; he replied gaily, and thereupon  repeated to her all he remembered of the legend, the foreboding strain of which  made his wife, sensitive in a great measure to supernatural hintings, shudder  nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  Guy, don&rsquo;t tell me any more,&rdquo; she said apprehensively, putting her gloved hand  over his mouth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad omen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  are you so superstitious as that?&rdquo; he replied, kissing her hand. &ldquo;Do you think  you are the witch-woman of the ballad, destined to bring woe to Errington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! I hope not! I trust not!&rdquo; cried Lady Errington, shrinking back with a vague  dread in her eyes, &ldquo;but I am a little superstitious. I think everyone is more  or less, and my family has been so terribly unfortunate that I am afraid of  bringing you bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  I don&rsquo;t mind the bad luck a bit, as long as you come along with it,&rdquo; said her  husband, soothingly. &ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t put these ideas into your foolish little  head. You must have nothing but bright thoughts to-day, my dearest, for this is  your home-coming, and I hear we are to have a great reception.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me all about it,&rdquo; asked Lady Errington, recovering herself with an effort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that would take too long, besides I&rsquo;m as ignorant as you are; but there are to  be banners and flowers and music and all that sort of thing, you know, and I  expect old Welstarler the Rector will read us an address. Then, of course,  everyone will have a tuck-out at the Hall, and there is to be a dance in the  evening down the village. All Denfield&rsquo;s going to have a high old time, so, for  once in your life you&rsquo;ll be received like a royal personage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  make me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  there&rsquo;s nothing to be nervous about. Just smile and look sweet, I&rsquo;ll do all the  patter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Patter!  talk you know. I&rsquo;m afraid it is slangy, but very expressive all the same. By  Jove, the train&rsquo;s slowing down, we&rsquo;ll soon be home now. There&rsquo;s the square  tower of Denfield Church, and yonder, Alizon!&mdash;here, quick&mdash;on the right&mdash;that  white wing of a house. That&rsquo;s our place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir  Guy was quite excited, and chattered like a schoolboy home for his holidays,  whilst Alizon, for once aroused from her coldness, stood near him, leaning her  head on his shoulder, and looked out of the window at the various objects of  interest, as the train steamed slowly onward.</p>
  <p>At  last they arrived at Denfield.</p>
  <p>The  little railway station was gaudy with bunting, much to the astonishment of the  prosaic folks in the train, who could not understand the reason of such unusual  decorative splendour, and as the train went on immediately Sir Guy and his wife  alighted, they had no time to find out what the excitement was all about,  therefore departed more in the dark than ever.</p>
  <p>The  station-master, who had known Sir Guy from boyhood, was much flattered at being  shaken hands with, and presented to Lady Errington, to whom some children  offered a charming bouquet of wild flowers.</p>
  <p>Outside  the station their carriage with four horses was waiting, and they got in amid  the cheers of the villagers, who mustered here in strong force. Sturdy farmers,  mounted in good style, labourers, looking forward to unlimited beer, women, in  the brightest of dresses, talking shrilly among themselves of the beauty of the  bride, school-children, jubilant at an unexpected holiday, all these were  present, with banners, flags, and flowers unlimited. A proud man that day was  the old coachman, as he guided the prancing horses through the long lane of  happy faces, with his master and mistress sitting in the carriage behind,  responding to the acclamations resounding on all sides, while from the grey,  old church tower rang a peal of joy-bells.</p>
  <p>After  all, let people pretend to despise it as they may, popularity is a very  pleasant thing, and it made life appear very bright to this young couple,  receiving such an uproarious welcome, instead of stealing homeward amid  indifferent faces. Despite the howlings of Radicals, the spread of socialism,  the groanings about agricultural depression, the bond between landlord and  tenant is too kindly, and too deeply ingrained to yield readily to the  mob-shriekings for equality and equal division of land. Sir Guy was a great  favourite in the county, and the Erringtons had been gentry at the Hall for  many centuries, so the sturdy British yeomen and kindly neighbours of the young  pair determined to make their home-coming as pleasant as possible&mdash;and  succeeded.</p>
  <p>Driving  through the quaint, narrow street of the village, followed by a long train of  horsemen, all the houses on either side were gay with flags and flowers and  handkerchiefs waving from the narrow casements. Flowers strewed the dusty road  under the feet of the horses, the village band, in bright uniforms, playing &ldquo;Home,  Sweet Home,&rdquo; on their brass instruments, with mighty strength of lungs, hearty  cheers from hundreds of willing throats, loud clashings from the bells  overhead, mad with joy, and at the entrance to the Park a triumphal arch of  evergreens, with the word &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; inscribed thereon.</p>
  <p>Under  this arch waited a gallant company of horsemen in pink, for Sir Guy was a  prominent member of the Hunt, and his brother Nimrods gave him a hearty  greeting to his paternal acres. Then, when the crowd had cheered themselves  hoarse, the old Rector, silver-haired and kindly-faced, read an address to the  happy pair wishing them long life and happiness, to which Sir Guy responded in  suitable terms, standing up in the carriage, his hat off, and his bright, young  face flushed with excitement.</p>
  <p>Up  the long avenue, still followed by the huntsmen, the farmers, and the villagers  more flags overhead among the green boughs of the beech-trees, more flowers on  the dusty road below, and at length the wide space before the house and the  long fa&ccedil;ade of Errington Hall, with its tall gables, its innumerable  diamond-paned windows, its slender turrets and weather-stained stacks of  chimneys.</p>
  <p>Cheers  from the servants, waiting in two long lines to welcome their new mistress,  with whose sweet face they fell in love at once. Sir Guy then helped his wife  to alight, and they both stood on the threshold of their new home, whilst a  speech of welcome was made by the oldest inhabitant, prompted by the village  schoolmaster, to which the young baronet responded with a few manly and  straightforward words.</p>
  <p>The  band then played a noisy quick step, which inspired the villagers to further  cheering, and the gentry, having seen the Erringtons safely home, rode off to  their different residences, while the tenantry and villagers all rejoiced and  made merry on the lawn in front of the terrace.</p>
  <p>A  blue sky above, a green earth below, happy faces all around, kindly voices  sounding in her ears, and her husband by her side, it was no wonder that Alizon  Errington, daughter of a social pariah, felt her heart swell with gratitude  towards God, who had guided her safely to such a pleasant haven of joy and  kindliness.</p>
  <p>But  it all came to an end at last, and after the tenantry had eaten and drank as  much as they possibly could at Sir Guy&rsquo;s expense, they all went down to the village  to finish up the evening with dancing and fireworks. The Erringtons, quite  tired out, were left alone standing on the terrace watching the crowd as it  melted away in the coming shadows, and the husband, putting a kindly arm round  his wife, felt that this was the brightest period of his life.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  Alizon, who looked pale and worn out with excitement, burst into a passionate  flood of tears, as she leaned against her husband&rsquo;s breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dearest,&rdquo; cried Guy, in alarm, &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  she sobbed, putting her arms round his neck, &ldquo;only&mdash;only I am so happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  got a curious way of showing it,&rdquo; said Guy, cheerfully, although his own eyes  were now rather wet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  come, Alizon, you must not give way like this. You are tired after your journey  and all this excitement. If Aunt Jelly were here, I&rsquo;m afraid she would  prescribe her favourite port wine,&rdquo; he added jestingly.</p>
  <p>Alizon  laughed at this, dried her eyes, and they both went inside to dress for dinner.</p>
  <p>A  very pleasant little meal they had, in the old-fashioned dining-room, with the  staid faces of the family portraits staring down at their frivolous  descendants. Guy made his wife drink some famous champagne, which was the  special pride of the Errington cellar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe in fizz myself,&rdquo; he said sagely, holding his glass up to the light. &ldquo;Aunt  Jelly pins her faith to port, but this is quite as good and not so heavy. Look  at all those ancestors of mine frowning down on us, Alizon. No doubt if they  could speak they would denounce our conduct as frivolous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  very glad they can&rsquo;t speak then,&rdquo; replied Lady Errington gaily. &ldquo;Perhaps,  however, they appear at midnight. Do they? This place looks like a haunted  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  We haven&rsquo;t got a family ghost. It&rsquo;s a great pity, isn&rsquo;t it? Ghosts generally  run in families who have been bad lots, but the Erringtons have always been a  steady-going set, so we haven&rsquo;t got even a haunted room, or a gruesome Johnnie  with a clanking chain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s to be regretted,&rdquo; answered his wife, as she arose from the  table; &ldquo;besides, no one believes in ghosts now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  good many people do not, but I firmly believe you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington laughed a little nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I certainly believe in presentiments, but not in ghosts&mdash;there&rsquo;s a great  difference between the two. Are you coming with me now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  you surely do not want me to sit in solitary state over my wine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not, and as it is such a pleasant evening, let us go outside on the terrace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must wrap yourself up, Alizon,&rdquo; said Guy, anxiously, &ldquo;the air is very keen  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  sent a servant for her shawl, and in a few minutes they were strolling up and  down the terrace, arm in arm, not talking much, but enjoying each other&rsquo;s  company and the reposeful silence of the hour.</p>
  <p>It  was an exceptional night for November, in England, being still and restful with  a moist, warm feeling in the air, and a gentle wind stirring the distant trees.  No moon, no stars were visible, as the sky was hidden by heavy masses of clouds  which seemed to press down on the weary earth, and a kind of luminous twilight  was spread around, which made everything loom strange and spectral in its  half-light.</p>
  <p>The  warm, yellow light from the drawing-room poured out through the open windows on  to the terrace, and away beyond the lawns, the flower beds, and the great  masses of beech, elm, and oak lay swallowed up in the dusky shadows. The wind  rustled the dry leaves from the trees, and made the great boughs shiver with  complaining sighs, as though they dreaded the coming of winter, while there was  a salt feeling in the air, coming from the distant sea, and, at intervals, the  dull, muffled roar of the surf, beating on the lonely coast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is not like Italy,&rdquo; said Alizon to her husband, as they stood arm in arm,  peering into the shadows, &ldquo;and yet there is a kind of similarity. This is the  terrace of Villa Tagni, beyond the trees are the distant mountains and that  strip of luminous ground is the lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid I haven&rsquo;t your imagination, my dear,&rdquo; he answered comically, &ldquo;or,  perhaps, I know the place too well, but I&rsquo;ve got a strong feeling that I&rsquo;m not  in Italy, but in England, and, moreover, that I am at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a very pleasant feeling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I think even the most inveterate Bohemian, Eustace, for instance, must  experience a home-sickness sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  your cousin any home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes! At least, he owns a kind of tumble-down old ruin about four miles from  here. It overlooks the sea, and is a most dismal place. Eustace visits it about  once in a blue moon, but I don&rsquo;t think he likes it. It&rsquo;s a haunted place, if  you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haunted  by what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s some sort of a ghost, who makes himself objectionable&mdash;by-the-way,  I&rsquo;m not sure that it isn&rsquo;t a lady ghost, with a rustling of silken skirts. But  then ghosts have no sex.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to be well up in the subject,&rdquo; said his wife, a little drily, as they  re-entered the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I only know folk lore in a desultory sort of manner. But when you get  to know all the people round about here, you&rsquo;ll be told the most gruesome  stories.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose for the next few weeks we won&rsquo;t have a moment of peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very probable,&rdquo; replied Guy coolly, &ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll have to return all the  visits. It&rsquo;s a deuce of a nuisance, but one must do it. We owe it to our  position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never heard that last phrase till I married you,&rdquo; said Lady Errington, a little  sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did not your father&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father! you forget, Guy. I am the daughter of a pariah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  took her in his strong, young arms, and kissed her fondly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are my wife, and the mistress of Errington Hall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Errington  Hall, hidden in the green heart of its noble woods, was a building of very  mixed architecture, displaying in its incongruities the various dispositions  and tastes of the different owners who had lived therein. The original  structure was evidently the large hall (from whence the building took its name)  which had been erected by the first Errington after the Battle of Bosworth  Field, when England was once more settling down to domesticity, after the  tumult and strife of the Wars of the Roses. To this noble room, lofty,  majestic, and sombre, the various masters of the Hall had added other and  smaller rooms, long, winding corridors, and innumerable outhouses, as the fancy  took them, or as their needs required them, so that the centre apartment was  quite lost amid the huge wings and gables which surrounded it on all sides. The  result was a bizarre combination which made the old mansion wonderfully  attractive to architects and archeologists, while the lapse of centuries had mellowed  the whole mass into one delicate tone of warm-hued loveliness.</p>
  <p>From  the central hall, with its carven roof, its long narrow windows, and quaint  oaken gallery, ran many crooked corridors, full of unexpected angles, queer  corners, sudden depressions, and shallow flights of steps, leading to long  ranges of bedrooms, to the kitchen and the servants&rsquo; wing. This portion was  Elizabethan and the outside presented the usual Tudoresque aspect of  battlements, venerable walls of grey stone, covered with ivy, diamond-paned  windows, and grotesque gargoyles. After the building of this, the Erringtons  were evidently too busy with the Parliamentary Wars to attend to their home,  for the next portion added to the original fabric was of Queen Anne date, of  dark-hued red brick, wide casements and heavy doors. Again there was an  architectural interval, as the Hanoverian Erringtons were engaged in making  their peace with the new German sovereigns of England for suspected Jacobite  practices, and the last notable addition took place in the reign of the third  George, when the front wing was added to the house, a vast fa&ccedil;ade of dull white  stone with innumerable windows, ranges of heavy balustrades, and confused  decorations in the Renaissance style, of nude figures, fantastic flowers,  birds, scrolls and such-like dainty devices. A balustrade ran along the front  of the roof, hiding the leads, and in the centre an elaborate carving of the  Errington coat-of-arms, supported by two greyhounds, with the motto, &ldquo;Curro,  Capio, Teneo.&rdquo; A broad terrace, with statues and urns thereon, stretched from  end to end, and a double flight of marble steps led downward to the smooth,  green lawn, from whence the great white pile standing on its hill presented a  noble appearance. The Victorian Erringtons added but little to the house, for  the simple reason, that the builder of the Renaissance wing had not only  exhausted the family resources in doing so, but had encumbered the estate with  heavy mortgages, which his descendants had not yet paid off. Sir Frederick  Errington had a turn for amateur gardening, and added long lines of hot-houses  to the side of the house, and also a kind of winter garden, while Sir Guy had  done his share in the adornment of the place, by building a handsome range of  stables. Altogether it was a wonderfully fine place, but far too expensive and  costly for the Errington rent-roll, which was not particularly large. So there  it stood, a monument of vanity and folly, which often made its present  possessor curse his bad luck in owning such a white elephant.</p>
  <p>The  interior was quite in keeping with the palatial exterior, for the state  apartments, situated in the front wing, were of enormous size, splendidly  furnished, but which looked lonely in the extreme unless full of company, a  gaily-dressed crowd being needed to set them off to advantage. The Errington  family were proud of these state-rooms, which were really wonderfully imposing,  but, except on grand occasions, when they were thrown open to the county  gentry, preferred to inhabit a smaller range of rooms on the western side,  which were more comfortable, both as regards size and furniture, than the  chilly splendours of the great apartments.</p>
  <p>One  of these rooms had been especially fitted up for Alizon by her husband, a  charming octagon-shaped apartment with windows looking on to a quaint garden  set forth in the Dutch fashion, with trim symmetrical lines of box and sombre  yew trees clipped into fantastic shapes, known by the name of &ldquo;My Lady&rsquo;s  Pleasaunce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think this is delightful, Guy,&rdquo; said Alizon, as she stood in the garden with  her husband; &ldquo;it is so shut out from the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were amusing themselves by exploring the great house, and Alizon was quite  overwhelmed by the size and magnificence of everything. Range after range of  splendidly furnished rooms shut up and left to the dust and spiders, lofty wide  passages with figures in armour on either side, stained glass windows here and  there in which blushed the Errington escutcheon. It was all angles, and  turrets, and gables, and crooked windings, so that Alizon clung closely to Guy  as they wandered through the lonely rooms, feeling quite afraid of the vastness  of the building.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  puts me in mind of Mrs. Radcliffe&rsquo;s stories,&rdquo; she said with a shudder, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s  something quite awesome about the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awesome?  not a bit of it,&rdquo; replied Guy cheerfully, opening a shutter and letting a flood  of sunlight into a room, &ldquo;it requires living in, that&rsquo;s all. You see, dear, my  parents died ages ago, and I&rsquo;ve been living here very little, so the whole  place has got a little musty. But now we&rsquo;re here we&rsquo;ll have more servants, and  a lot of people to come and see us. That will wake the place up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s so large, Guy. Why was it built so large?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the young man somewhat ruefully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a deuce of a  barn, isn&rsquo;t it? The Erringtons always had a mania for building, and whenever  they&rsquo;d nothing else to do they added wings. More fools they, as it ran away  with all the money and put these confounded mortgages on the property. This is  a dear old place, and I&rsquo;m very fond of it, but it&rsquo;s miles too big for us, and  is a regular white elephant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must take a lot of money to keep it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does! So much that there&rsquo;s none left for anything else. I wish to heaven I wasn&rsquo;t  sentimental, or I&rsquo;d pull down a lot of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Guy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what is the use of all these empty rooms? It takes an army of servants to keep  them clean, and for no purpose. We haven&rsquo;t got enough money to keep open house,  or I could fill all these rooms with people I know, but what with this place,  and the mortgages, and bad tenants, it&rsquo;s a deuce of a nuisance altogether. I  wish someone would take the Hall off my hands as a museum, or an almshouse,  after the style of Hampton Court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wouldn&rsquo;t sell it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I daresay I wouldn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t do with it, and I can&rsquo;t do without it. It&rsquo;s a  dead lock. But, if Aunt Jelly would only give up the ghost and leave us her  tin, we could keep the whole shop going beautifully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid there&rsquo;s no chance of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  there isn&rsquo;t. Aunt Jelly is one of those aggravating old women who&rsquo;ll see the  end of the present century.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s not far off,&rdquo; said Alizon mischievously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  far off for us to get her money, my dear,&rdquo; replied Guy candidly. &ldquo;I believe she&rsquo;s  immortal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  left the room in which they were standing and resumed their walk through the  house, stopping in the picture gallery which contained the Errington portraits,  and also a number of celebrated pictures, all of which Guy contemplated  ruefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  even sell these,&rdquo; he said with a groan. &ldquo;Fancy, what humbug&mdash;they&rsquo;re all  heirlooms, and I&rsquo;d have to apply to Chancery to get permission, which I daresay  they&rsquo;d refuse. It takes me all my time to keep up this place and live decently,  yet all this money is hanging on the wall in the shape of these pictures. It&rsquo;s  awful bosh, just like making a child the present of a shilling on condition he  doesn&rsquo;t spend it. Humbug!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  would you sell your ancestors, like Charles Surface?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as that. But these pictures are wasting their sweetness on  the desert air in being shut up here, and, as I need money more than pictures,  I would sell them if I could. I don&rsquo;t see much chance of doing so, however, for  the Errington cousins&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got about a hundred&mdash;would come down on me as a  lunatic if I did so. Hang them! I wish they&rsquo;d this place to keep up on a small  income, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so anxious to keep these miles of painted canvas. But  never mind, while there&rsquo;s Aunt Jelly there&rsquo;s hope, so come along and look at the  hall from the gallery. It&rsquo;s the best place to see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  they went along a narrow passage into the older portion of the house, and soon  found themselves in the wide gallery running round the hall at a height of  about forty feet. A wonderfully impressive place it was, with its lance-shaped  windows, filled with stained glass, through which the pale sunlight streamed,  casting fantastic patterns on the oaken floor. Between every window, shields,  spears and battle axes, with faded banners drooping above them, telling of  ancient wars and the days of chivalry, when the deserted hall was filled with  men-at-arms and bold knights in steel armour, before the invention of gunpowder  relegated their iron panoply to the obscurity of country houses and museums. At  the upper end of the room a raised dais, above which a royal canopy and the  Errington arms flashing in gilt splendour from the dusky shadows, while high  above arose the pointed roof with its great oaken rafters faintly seen in the  gloom. It was certainly a fine specimen of the medi&aelig;val ages and doubtless many  stirring tales could be told of the generations that had feasted under its  lofty roof, or departed from thence to harry the lands of weaker neighbours, as  was the kindly fashion in those misnamed good old days.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  wonderful old place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Guy, as they stood looking from the height  of the gallery at the immense space below, &ldquo;and genuine too. None of the sham  antiquity of Abbotsford here. All this is the real thing, and just as it was in  the old days when the Erringtons wore those absurd suits of armour, and poked  their neighbours&rsquo; eyes out with those long spears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ought to be very proud of your race, Guy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see much to be proud of in them,&rdquo; he replied candidly, throwing his arm  round his wife&rsquo;s waist, &ldquo;they were a humdrum lot at best the Erringtons. Went  to church, minded their own business, and left other people&rsquo;s wives alone. They  always seemed to have been on the safe side in keeping their property, however,  and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for their building craze, I&rsquo;d be decently off. According  to their ideas there was no place like home, however, and that is why they  spent such a lot of money over it. I am proud of the dear old Hall, but I do  wish it wasn&rsquo;t quite so large.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you use this place at all?&rdquo; asked Alizon as they left the gallery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  for dances, and tenants&rsquo; dinners,&rdquo; he answered carelessly; &ldquo;it looks very  pretty when it&rsquo;s full, but at present one would think it was haunted. Quite a  mistake, as there isn&rsquo;t a single ghost in the whole place. A pity, isn&rsquo;t it,  for this queer old house just looks a fit place for shadowy figures and  gruesome legends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose there are plenty of stories about the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes! but very mild stories, I&rsquo;m afraid, not even equal to the average shilling  shocker. Errington Hall has no history which would delight novelists or  antiquaries. Queen Elizabeth didn&rsquo;t stop here on a royal progress, Oliver  Cromwell&rsquo;s Ironsides didn&rsquo;t besiege the place, and though I think the  Hanoverian Erringtons were mixed up in Jacobite plots they hid neither Prince  James nor Prince Charlie. We are a very prosaic lot, my dear, and although the  whole house is romantic enough in appearance, there isn&rsquo;t a story about it that  would frighten a five-year-old child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time they were on the terrace in the pale November sunlight, and could see  below the smooth green lawn surrounding the house, girdled by the ancient trees  of the park, which were now shedding their leaves for winter time. The carriage  drive swept round the front of the terrace in a graceful curve, and then  disappeared into the green wood, while beyond the tops of the trees appeared  the grey square tower of Denfield Church, sombre against the dull sky. Some  pigeons, white as milk, were whirling aloft in the moist air, and the sun,  invisible behind the grey clouds, diffused a pale chilly radiance, which made  Alizon long for the blue skies and burning heat of Italy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  inside, Alizon,&rdquo; said Sir Guy, seeing his wife shivering, &ldquo;this is cold after  the South, and you&rsquo;d better lie down for a time after luncheon, as I daresay  for the next week or two you&rsquo;ll have quite enough to do in receiving our  neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  Guy said was true enough, and for the next few weeks Alizon had as much as she  could do in receiving the county magnates, all eager to see Lady Errington, of  whom they had heard much, but of whose father they had heard still more.  Despite Sir Guy&rsquo;s lack of ready money the Errington estates were very large,  the Errington position a very high one in the county, and many a daughter of  the Shires would have been pleased to have become the mistress of Errington  Hall, particularly as its master, young, handsome and debonnaire, was favourite  enough with the gentle sex independently of his rank and position.</p>
  <p>When,  however, it came to be known that this eligible bachelor had married Alizon  Mostyn, the county, at least the female part of it, felt vexed that an outsider  should have carried off the matrimonial prize, and the provincial belles felt  none too well disposed towards the young wife, although they masked their real  feelings under many sweet smiles and smooth words.</p>
  <p>The  &ldquo;Pepper Box,&rdquo; with its customary good manners, had set forth in its columns the  story of Gabriel Mostyn, and although there was nothing in it but what  redounded to Alizon&rsquo;s credit, yet the fact that she had such a scamp for a  father was not desirable in itself. Sir Guy managed to put an end to the &ldquo;Pepper  Box&rdquo; chatter by threatening to thrash Billy Dolser, and as that gentleman was  getting rather tired of being horsewhipped he held his tongue, so nothing more  was revealed in that quarter, but Society having got a pretty good idea of the  Mostyn history pursued the whole affair to the end, and found out all Gabriel&rsquo;s  iniquities and Alizon&rsquo;s filial affection. When Lady Errington therefore  received the county families, she knew perfectly well that all these smooth  smiling people were well acquainted with her history, and although she had  nothing personally to fear from their venomous tongues, yet the fact that the  history of her iniquitous father was known to them down to the minutest detail,  made her position anything but a pleasant one.</p>
  <p>The  county, however, made a virtue of necessity, and seeing that Lady Errington was  of good birth, and that there was nothing against her, whatever there might  have been against her scamp of a father, made her welcome among them in the  heartiest manner, although a few wiseacres shook their heads doubtfully over  Sir Guy&rsquo;s wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  bred in the bone will come out in the flesh,&rdquo; they whispered one to the other, &ldquo;and  it&rsquo;s curious if she does not inherit some of her father&rsquo;s bad qualities as well  as her mother&rsquo;s good ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington guessed the somewhat unfriendly feeling they bore towards her because  she had become mistress of Errington Hall, but spoke of it to no one, not even  Guy, who never for a moment dreamt of such a thing, and was delighted to see  how his neighbours seemed to like his wife. This calm, statuesque woman, with  the impassive face, bore herself with stately grace towards the visitors that  called at Errington Hall, and although they all respected her, yet her manner  chilled them with its coldness, and no one professed any strong liking for her.  The men admired her greatly, but thought her cold and haughty, while the  ladies, finding she did not take an interest in their provincial frivolities,  said disagreeable things behind her back, and smiled to her face, which did not  for a moment deceive Alizon, as she knew what their friendship was worth.</p>
  <p>No  one could deny, however, that she was a beautiful woman, and filled her  position admirably in every way, yet curiously enough everyone arrived at the  same conclusion as Eustace, and pitied Sir Guy as a warm-hearted young man  married to a statue. Lady Errington was not therefore an unqualified success,  but her husband never perceived this and took all the lip service of his  friends for gospel truth, while Alizon, although she guessed pretty well the  true state of things, did not undeceive him.</p>
  <p>She  knew she was not disliked, as she had done her best to conciliate everyone, but  on the other hand she knew perfectly well that a gulf lay between herself and  these people which could not be bridged over in any way. They all wanted to  take her to their bosom and gush over her, while she, cold, reserved and  self-reliant, objected to the obvious hint of patronage in this desire; so  although she received and made visits, went to all provincial gaities, and  presided at her own dinner-table in returning hospitality, yet she felt she was  an exile among these people, a stranger in a strange land, who could neither  learn their ways nor make them understand her own.</p>
  <p>In  fact, now that the glamour of the honeymoon had worn off, there were times when  even Sir Guy felt the chill of her manner towards him, and although he tried to  analyse the feeling, never succeeded in doing so. She was perfect in every way,  almost too perfect, and at times he had his doubts as to whether it would not  have been wiser on his part to have married a common-place provincial belle  than this ethereal creature, whose nature he vaguely perceived was utterly at  variance with his own. Such ideas as these, however, he rejected as heretical  against the woman he loved, and he assured himself with unnecessary vehemence that  he had gained a woman who would be perfect in every way both as mother and  wife. Therefore the county and Sir Guy were both pleased with Alizon in this  somewhat doubtful fashion, and she, knowing the real mistrust she had  innocently provoked by her icy reserve, did not trouble herself about it, but  went calmly on her way, fulfilling her position as mistress of Errington Hall,  and one of the great ladies of the place.</p>
  <p>One  event, however, took place which showed Guy that under her impassive demeanour  there was a strong will and a considerable spice of temper, both of which came  to light in the episode of Mrs. Veilsturm.</p>
  <p>Everyone  far and near had called at the Hall. Stalwart county squires with their  comfortable wives and frivolous daughters, loud-voiced, hearty young men whose  ideas rarely extended beyond the hunting-field, occasionally an effete  inhabitant of Belgravia, whose ancestral acres were but rarely visited, meek  curates who wanted Alizon to become the Lady Bountiful of the parish, and gay  country damsels who revelled in lawn-tennis and slyly copied Lady Errington&rsquo;s  dresses with feminine subtlety&mdash;all these had called at the Hall and been  received by Alizon with friendly reserve, after which she returned their visits  in company with Guy, feeling she had done her duty. Nothing out of the way  happened till Mrs. Veilsturm left her card.</p>
  <p>They  had been paying a visit to some county magnate, and on their return Alizon had  gone inside, while Sir Guy remained without for a moment giving some directions  to the grooms about the horses. Having done so he ran up the steps into the  entrance-hall, to find his wife even paler than usual, standing by a small  table looking at a card with a look of horror on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what&rsquo;s the matter, dear?&rdquo; he asked, coming forward anxiously, &ldquo;is anything  wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  handed him the card without a word, and having looked at the name, he glanced  at her in puzzled surprise. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s wrong about Mrs. Veilsturm?&rdquo; he said  inquiringly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a jolly sort of woman, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know her?&rdquo; asked his wife coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t say I do personally. She came down while I was away and bought old  Darton&rsquo;s place, about two miles from here. But what do you look so horrified  at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in here, Guy, and I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; answered Alizon, with an effort, and walked  into the drawing-room, followed by her husband in a state of wonder as to what  could have occurred to upset his wife.</p>
  <p>Alizon  sat down under the window, twisting her gloves in her hands with a look of  anger on her face, while Guy stood near her with his tall hat on the back of  his head, looking at her in a state of bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw you so upset before, Alizon,&rdquo; he said, with an uneasy laugh; &ldquo;is  there anything particularly wrong about Mrs. Veilsturm&mdash;is she a leper, or is her  character no better than it should be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you heard anything against her character?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a word,&rdquo; replied Guy, promptly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a great favourite with everyone. Her  husband was a captain in some regiment that was stationed out at the Bermudas  or Jamaica, and I believe he married her out there. When he died he left her  well off, and she&rsquo;s a lively sort of woman, but I never heard anything against  her morals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Major Griff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Major  Griff!&mdash;oh, he was a friend of her husband&rsquo;s, I believe, and wants to marry her,  only she won&rsquo;t accept him. I hear that he is her trustee, and looks after her  property for her; but what on earth do you know about her, Alizon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know too much to allow her to visit here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce you do,&rdquo; cried Sir Guy, taking a seat, &ldquo;and who told you anything about  her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father,&rdquo; she replied quickly, turning her pale face towards him.</p>
  <p>Sir  Guy whistled, and looked thoughtfully out of the window, knowing well enough  that Gabriel Mostyn&rsquo;s name being mentioned did not bode any good to Mrs.  Veilsturm. He said nothing, however, as he judged it best to let his wife tell  the story her own way, and that this course was the right one was proved by  what followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you know, I attended my father during those four years when he was dying, and  although I don&rsquo;t want to say a word against him, seeing that after all he was  my father, yet, I heard sufficient from his own lips to convince me that his  life had been a vile one. Not even the fact that I was his child prevented him  boasting in my presence of his horrible actions, and although I invariably left  the room when he began to talk like this, I could not help overhearing more  than I cared to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder you did not leave him altogether,&rdquo; said Sir Guy indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was my father after all,&rdquo; she replied simply. &ldquo;No one would stay by him except  me, and I could not let him die alone, like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir  Guy shifted uneasily in his seat, finding a difficulty in making an answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I suppose you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered reluctantly; &ldquo;blood&rsquo;s thicker than water,  but still&mdash;you are a good woman, Alizon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington smiled faintly and shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  put me on a pedestal,&rdquo; she said, a trifle bitterly, &ldquo;or you will find your  goddess has feet of clay after all. Well, about Mrs. Veilsturm. I need not tell  you all I heard about her, but only this. That my father knew her&mdash;intimately&mdash;and  that her life before she set up for a woman of fashion in England, was not all  that could be desired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did he meet her?&rdquo; demanded Sir Guy abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  South America. She is a Creole, you know, and when my father knew her she was  not married to Captain Veilsturm. She may have lived decently since she became  wife and widow, for all I know, but when she was in South America&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington broke off abruptly, and rose quickly to her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare she call on me&mdash;how dare she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay she thinks you know nothing about her,&rdquo; said Sir Guy, rising also.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  knows I am Gabriel Mostyn&rsquo;s daughter, and that ought to be enough to make her  keep away from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  of what do you accuse her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  accuse her of nothing, at present,&rdquo; said Alizon, looking steadily at him. &ldquo;I  only tell you that she is not a fit woman to cross the threshold of Errington  Hall, and she will not do so while I am mistress here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to return the card she had the audacity to leave here, and write her a  note forbidding her to call again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir  Guy thought for a moment, and then spoke out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the best judge as to whom you make your friends, Alizon, but if you do this  Mrs. Veilsturm will demand an explanation, and there will be a row.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington paused with her hand on the door and looked back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Veilsturm will not demand an explanation,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;but if she wishes  for one I can easily satisfy her on that point. But while I am mistress of  Errington Hall if that infamous woman dares to come here I&rsquo;ll have her turned  out by my servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She!&rdquo;  echoed his wife decisively. &ldquo;She will take the hint conveyed by the return of  this card and keep a wide distance between Gabriel Mostyn&rsquo;s daughter and  herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  door closed after her, and Guy, after a pause of amazement at the change in his  usually calm wife, turned towards the window with a half frown on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  got a temper after all,&rdquo; he said to himself, thrusting his hands into his  pockets. &ldquo;I might have guessed it. Sleeping volcanoes are always the worst when  they do start.&rdquo;</p>

    A Woman Scorned</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;What!  will she place her foot upon my neck,<br>
    And hold me helpless, writhing in the dust?<br>
    Nay, such a thing is folly at the best,<br>
  &lsquo;Tis ill to tamper with the meanest worm,<br>
    For, serpent-like, I&rsquo;ll wound her in the heel,<br>

    I&rsquo;ll twist my coils around her dainty throat<br>
    And sting!&mdash;and sting!&mdash;and sting!&mdash;until she dies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Mrs. Veilsturm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  good many people asked this question, when a woman, black-browed, voluptuous,  and imperious as Cleopatra, flashed like an unknown star into the brilliance of  a London season four years ago. No one could answer this question, the  quidnuncs for once were at fault, and although ladies in drawing-rooms and men  in clubs set their wits to work to find out all about her, no one could give an  opinion with certainty as to who she was, where she came from, and what was the  source of her income.</p>
  <p>The  society papers, who usually know everything, could not unravel this riddle, and  it was reserved for the indefatigable Billy Dolser to lift in some measure the  veil which hung over the past of this beautiful enigmatical woman. Under the  heading of &ldquo;A Cleopatra of To-day,&rdquo; an article appeared in the &ldquo;Pepperbox,&rdquo;  setting forth a very delightful story which satisfied everyone except a few  suspicious grumblers, but whether it was fact or fiction, no one was quite  sure.</p>
  <p>According  to this veracious chronicle, Mrs. Veilsturm (or as the &ldquo;Pepperbox,&rdquo; thinly  veiling her identity, called her, Cleopatra) was a West Indian Creole, born in  the island of Cuba, the daughter of a wealthy planter. Her parents died when  she was young, and according to all reports, she lived a life of semi-barbaric  magnificence in the somnolent Spanish island. Later, becoming tired of her  secluded life, she went to Jamaica, and there met Captain Veilsturm, at that  time reputed to be the handsomest man in the island. He married her, and for  some time she reigned as Queen of the Regiment, but her husband dying suddenly  of yellow fever, she left Jamaica, and came to England, intending with her  great wealth to enter into London society.</p>
  <p>In  this laudable ambition she was helped by Major Griff, a well-known man about  town, who had been in Veilsturm&rsquo;s regiment, and who, if report spoke truly,  would have been glad to have married his lovely widow. Mrs. Veilsturm, however,  did not care to tempt matrimony a second time, and refused the Major, who,  nevertheless, remained her closest friend, for her deceased husband had made  him his executor. So the wily Major looked after all the entire property of the  husband (consisting of a small house in the country), and the large property of  the wife (consisting of West Indian estates), to the mutual satisfaction of  both himself and the widow.</p>
  <p>Major  Griff was invaluable to her in more senses than one, as he knew everyone and  everything, and was enabled to float her successfully in London society through  the influence of his friends.</p>
  <p>How  it was done the &ldquo;Pepperbox&rdquo; scribe did not venture to say, although he hinted  that the Major&rsquo;s influence in inducing his friends to take up the lovely widow,  was not due so much to their friendship as to the Major&rsquo;s possession of certain  disagreeable secrets. However, let the means used be what they might, Mrs.  Veilsturm obtained a social success in a select circle, and became quite the  rage of the season. The Major&rsquo;s tactics and her own craftiness, added to her  undeniable beauty, enabled her to take up an excellent position, and although  the next season some people showed a desire to drop her, Mrs. Veilsturm was too  clever to let them do so, and managed to confirm her social prestige in the  most dexterous manner.</p>
  <p>She  had plenty of money, great beauty, a delightful house in Park Lane, and was an  admirable hostess, so with this galaxy of virtue Society was fain to be  content, and spoke well of her to her face, although behind her back they  characterised her as an adventuress. It was dangerous to do this, however, as  Major Griff was ubiquitous and, constituting himself her protector, dared any  man or woman to speak evil of Cleopatra, whose character and life were above  suspicion.</p>
  <p>With  certain reservations this was the story the &ldquo;Pepperbox&rdquo; told, and whether  people chose to believe or doubt, it did not matter to Mrs. Veilsturm, who went  serenely on her way, protected by the faithful Major. Some houses, however,  were closed against her, as the Major was not omnipotent, and in these some  disagreeable stories were told about the beautiful Creole, but Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s  set, although undeniably fast, was also as undeniably &ldquo;in the swim,&rdquo; so she was  supremely indifferent to such scandal.</p>
  <p>As  to the houses closed against her, she did not pose as an exiled Peri at the  gates of a Paradise guarded by Mrs. Grundy, but set herself up in rebel  authority over her own friends, and defied the ultra-exclusive people in every  way. As they did not invite her to visit them in Paradise, she returned the  compliment by not asking the pleasure of their company to&mdash;well, the other  place, and as she gave most delightful entertainments, the dwellers in the Mrs.  Grundy-guarded-Paradise could not help feeling rather annoyed. They looked down  on Mrs. Veilsturm, they called her an adventuress, they wondered how any decent  people could tolerate such a woman, and yet they regretted that the laws of  social respectability forced them to ignore such an attractive woman.</p>
  <p>This  being the position of affairs, rebellious Cleopatra would, without doubt, have  gained her ambition, and obliged even these jealously-guarded doors to be  opened to her, but for an unfortunate rumour which originated no one knew  where, and, creeping through society like a snake, raised its head and hissed  disagreeable things regarding gambling.</p>
  <p>Gambling!</p>
  <p>Yes!  Rumour, in the guise of bewigged old ladies over tea, and would-be juvenile old  men over something stronger, said that Mrs. Veilsturm had very charming Sunday  evenings, very charming indeed, but a trifle expensive to those not greatly  blessed with this world&rsquo;s goods. At these Sunday evening receptions, at a late  hour of the night, certain green-covered tables made their appearance, and such  production led to the playing of nap, of unlimited loo, baccarat, and such like  games, over which a good deal of money changed hands.</p>
  <p>It  was also observed that who ever lost, Major Griff did not, but that a good deal  of the money on the tables managed to find its way into his pockets. This had nothing  to do with Mrs. Veilsturm certainly, still it was curious that this wealthy  woman should permit her house to be turned into a gambling saloon, for the sake  of giving Major Griff a nice little income, so rumour once more set to work to  solve the problem, and made several startling assertions.</p>
  <p>First,  that Society had been imposed upon, as Mrs. Veilsturm was by no means wealthy,  and that the West Indian estates were a myth, emanating from the fertile brain  of Major Griff.</p>
  <p>Second,  that the relationship between the beautiful Creole and the disinterested Major  was by no means as artless as was supposed, and that the money gained by the  Major went to keep up the house in Park Lane.</p>
  <p>Third,  that Mrs. Veilsturm and the Major were in partnership together for the purpose  of making money, and that the woman&rsquo;s beauty and the man&rsquo;s skill were the  stock-in-trade of the said partnership.</p>
  <p>Then  these disagreeable reports were whispered everywhere, and even Major Griff,  astute and cunning as a fox, could not find anyone to whom he could give the  lie; and despite his emphatic contradiction of such report; people began to  fight shy of fascinating Mrs. Veilsturm, and the dainty little house in Park  Lane.</p>
  <p>The  second season of Cleopatra in London, however, was nearly over, so Major Griff,  being an old campaigner, knew that out of sight is out of mind, and determined  to withdraw himself and his partner from town for a time, until the next year,  when he hoped to come back to Mayfair, and proceed with more caution.  Accordingly, Mrs. Veilsturm announced to her dearest friends in confidence (so  that it would sure to be repeated) that she was tired of town, and was going to  her little place at Denfield, which she did shortly before the end of the  season, and the fact was duly chronicled in the Society papers.</p>
  <p>The  Major did not accompany her, as he did not want to give colour to the reports  about his relationship with Mrs. Veilsturm, and moreover, wanted to hear the  result of this dexterous move. The result was exactly as the astute Major  calculated, for people began to say that Mrs. Veilsturm was greatly maligned,  as the Major had not accompanied her into the country, and that had she been  the adventuress she was asserted to be, she would not have left London, where  she was reaping such a rich harvest, for a dull country house. The Major&rsquo;s  diplomacy, therefore, was entirely successful, and Society was quite prepared  to receive Mrs. Veilsturm when she chose to come back to Park Lane. So after  the lapse of some weeks, Major Griff joined Mrs. Veilsturm at Denfield, to talk  over the success of their clever move.</p>
  <p>He  found her in clover, for as no disagreeable rumours had found their way to this  out-of-the-world locality, and she was known to be a leading lady in society  (videlicet the Society papers), all the provincial gentry called upon her, and  she visited at their houses, fascinating everyone with her brilliancy and  beauty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Major  Griff, a great friend of my poor husband,&rdquo; was duly introduced, and being an  admirable sportsman, and a bold rider, soon succeeded in becoming as popular as  Cleopatra, so he was perfectly satisfied with the attitude of things as he  foresaw the return of the firm to London would be after the fashion of a  triumphal entry. Provincial gentry were dull company, certainly, but a  guarantee of respectability, and the fact that Mrs. Veilsturm was at all the  great houses in the country would be duly chronicled in the papers, and being  seen by the London folk, would shew that she was not an adventuress, but a lady  of great wealth, moving in the best society.</p>
  <p>Then  Mrs. Veilsturm made a mistake.</p>
  <p>Against  the advice of the Major, who had known and detested Gabriel Mostyn, she called  on Gabriel Mostyn&rsquo;s daughter and left her card, with the hope that the visit  would be returned. On the evening of the day she had done this, she was waiting  for dinner in the little drawing-room, and Major Griff, in evening dress, was  lounging against the mantelpiece with a glass of sherry at his elbow, listening  to her remarks.</p>
  <p>A  handsome woman was Mrs. Veilsturm, as she leaned back in a deep arm-chair,  fanning herself slowly with all the grace and languor of a Creole. A dusky  skin, masses of coal-black hair, with a suspicion of frizziness, betraying the  African blood, large black eyes, a sensual, full-lipped mouth, and the figure  of a Juno, she was a wonderfully handsome woman in a full-blooded way. Her arms  and neck were beautifully proportioned, and dressed as she was, with the negro&rsquo;s  love for bright tints, in a lemon-coloured dress, with great masses of crimson  flowers at her breast and in her hair, she looked a beautiful imperious  creature, with a touch of the treacherous grace of the tiger in the indolent  repose of her lithe limbs. A painter would have admired her voluptuous form, a  poet would have raved on the dusky beauty of her face, with the sombre light in  the sleepy eyes; but no man who had any instinct of self-preservation would  have trusted this feline loveliness, so suggestive of treachery and craft. Some  highly imaginative man averred that Mrs. Veilsturm put him in mind of a snake,  and certainly there was more than a resemblance to a serpent in the sinuous  grace of her evil beauty.</p>
  <p>As  for Major Griff, he was a tall, dried-up man, like a stick; with a hard,  handsome face, iron-grey hair and moustache, and keen eyes, which looked  everyone straight in the face. A thorough scamp, it was true, yet with  sufficient dexterity to hide his scampishness, and a military cut-and-dried  brevity which disarmed suspicion. Some rogues fawn and supplicate to gain their  ends, but not so the Major, who habitually grave, plain in his speech, and  brusque in his manner, gave everyone the impression of being a blunt,  straightforward soldier. He was stopping at a friend&rsquo;s house in the town of  Starton, which was a short distance away, and had come over on a friendly visit  to Mrs. Veilsturm, who lived mostly alone, as her house was not large enough to  enable her to receive company. This did not matter, as she generally dined out  every night, but on this special evening, the two had to consult about their  plans, so Mrs. Veilsturm had refused an invitation with many thanks, but &ldquo;you  see I have to speak about business connected with my West Indian Estates with  my trustee, Major Griff,&rdquo; and the givers of the invitation were quite impressed  with an idea of her wealth. The West Indian Estates were a capital bait  wherewith to gull people as, being at a distance, no one could deny their  existence, and the very mention of them had a golden sound, suggestive of  toiling slaves and untold riches.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you did do what I told you not to, Maraquita?&rdquo; growled the Major, who called  Mrs. Veilsturm by her Christian name when alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you mean in the way of calling upon Lady Errington, yes,&rdquo; she replied  indolently, sweeping her sandal-wood fan to and fro and diffusing a subtle  eastern perfume through the room.</p>
  <p>She  had a beautiful voice, full, rich and mellow, yet with a certain roughness  which grew more pronounced when she became excited. Anyone would have been  fascinated by this voluptuous beauty lounging in the chair, while the dreamy  fragrance of the sandal-wood seemed to add to her rich, eastern look, but  custom had habituated Major Griff to this barbaric loveliness, and he spoke  curtly, being annoyed and making no effort to conceal his annoyance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were wrong, quite wrong, I tell you,&rdquo; he observed, taking a sip of sherry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think I&rsquo;m a fool?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Veilsturm harshly, with a frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do! What woman isn&rsquo;t&mdash;on occasions?&rdquo; was the polite response.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm laughed in a sneering fashion, in nowise offended, as the private  conversations of this precious pair were apt to be rather disagreeable at  times, but the Major, always cool and imperturbable, knew better than to  provoke the Creole&rsquo;s wrath, which resembled, in its force and terror, the  storms of her native land.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are polite, I must say,&rdquo; said Maraquita, coolly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m used to your manners  by this time, so we need not argue about them. Let us talk business, and tell  me why you object to my leaving a card on Lady Errington, seeing that she is a  great personage down here, and may be useful to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ask me a question of which you know the answer well enough,&rdquo; returned the Major  deliberately. &ldquo;Lady Errington is the daughter of Gabriel Mostyn, and I don&rsquo;t  suppose you want your relationship with him raked up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see there is much chance of that,&rdquo; she replied contemptuously. &ldquo;Mostyn is  dead, and his daughter knows nothing about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you be too sure of that,&rdquo; said Griff significantly. &ldquo;This girl attended to her  father for four years when he was ill, and Mostyn with his monkeyish nature was  just the man to torture a woman by telling her all kinds of things of which she  would rather have remained ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,  she was his daughter, and even Mostyn would hold his tongue about some things  to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  I&rsquo;m not so sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you not?&mdash;I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Major frowned, pulled his moustache, and then finishing his sherry at one gulp,  spoke sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  appear to be sure of a good many things, Maraquita, but perhaps you will be  kind enough to remember that union means strength, and that your well-being in  the eyes of the world is of just as much importance to our schemes as my  knowledge of human nature. If I hadn&rsquo;t made you leave London, things would have  been said which would have closed every door against you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about yourself?&rdquo; asked the Creole her dark eyes flashing dangerously as  she shut her fan with a sharp click.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same thing precisely,&rdquo; retorted Griff; coolly. &ldquo;People were beginning to think  I knew too much about cards, so it was wise in me to have made an end of things  as I did. Don&rsquo;t you make any mistake, Mrs. Veilsturm, I am no more blind to my  own defects than I am to yours, and you have just as much right to pull me up  if you catch me tripping as I have to keep an eye on your conduct. And let me  tell you that your calling on Lady Errington is a mistake, as the good she can  do to us is nothing to the harm she might do to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  I tell you she knows nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you said before, and I hope she doesn&rsquo;t, but if she does there will be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can she do?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Veilsturm with supreme contempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she she knows anything, she can tell all her friends about that South American  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she comes to measuring swords with me in that way,&rdquo; said Maraquita with vicious  slowness, &ldquo;I can tell a few stories about her late father which won&rsquo;t be  pleasant for her to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pish!  what good will that do? You can&rsquo;t tell stories about Mostyn without inculpating  yourself. It won&rsquo;t harm his memory, which is black enough. It will only harm  you, and through you, me. No, no, Mrs. Veilsturm, I&rsquo;ve too much at stake to  risk the world finding out what we want kept quiet, and if Lady Errington does  not return your call, put your cursed pride in your pocket and hold your  tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got my wits about me as well as you,&rdquo; said Cleopatra coolly, &ldquo;so you needn&rsquo;t  lecture me as if I were a school-girl. Besides, my position is too strong in  Society to be hurt by Lady Errington or any other silly fool of a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  position, my dear,&rdquo; remarked Griff with cruel candour, &ldquo;hangs by a thread, and  that thread is Mr. William Dolser, of &lsquo;The Pepper Box.&rsquo; He put in what I  wanted, and made people shut their mouths, but if he turned nasty, he could  find out quite enough to make them open them again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he tried to, you could promise him a thrashing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  wouldn&rsquo;t do much good. He&rsquo;s used to the horsewhip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you could have an action for libel against the paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  very nicely we&rsquo;d come out of it. Whether we won or lost it would be the  death-knell of our campaign in town. No! no, I&rsquo;ll keep The &lsquo;Pepper Box&rsquo; in a  good temper by judicious bribes, and you on the other hand, don&rsquo;t play with  fire or you&rsquo;ll have the whole place in a blaze.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  dexterous arguing of Major Griff evidently impressed Mrs. Veilsturm, for she  made no reply, but looked down frowning at one dainty foot in a high-heeled  slipper that was resting on the green velvet foot-stool. She knew her partner  was right in all he said, but with feminine persistence was about to renew the  argument and have the last word, when a servant entered the room and presenting  a letter to his mistress, left it again, closing the door noiselessly after  him.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm, leaning back languidly in her chair, was about to open the letter,  when Major Griff stopped her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Maraquita,&rdquo; he said deliberately, with a certain anxious look on his  face. &ldquo;You know I often have an instinct as to how things will go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  bowed her head, but said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had an instinct that your calling on Lady Errington was a mistake, and that  letter is from Lady Errington to tell you so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm laughed scornfully as she tore open the envelope, but the Major,  putting his hands behind his back, leaned against the mantelpiece, and looked  steadily at her with a satisfied smile on his lips.</p>
  <p>The  woman had wonderful self-command, for as she read Lady Errington&rsquo;s curt note,  no sign of anger escaped from her lips, but her dark skin flushed an angry red  and a venomous smile curled the corners of her full mouth. Still she gave no  further sign of being moved, but having read the note through in the most  deliberate manner, handed it to the Major with a low, fierce laugh.</p>
  <p>Major  Griff adjusted his eyeglass carefully, smoothed out the sheet of cream-coloured  paper, and read as follows in a subdued voice:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Lady  Errington presents her compliments to Mrs. Veilsturm, and returns the enclosed  card, which was evidently left to-day at the Hall by some mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I was right, you see,&rdquo; observed Griff, leisurely folding up this short epistle  and letting his eyeglass drop down. &ldquo;Mostyn did tell her about you after all&mdash;damn  him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Major swore in a tranquil manner, without any sign of anger, but that he was  greatly annoyed could be seen by the twitching of his thin lips under his  grizzled moustache. As for Mrs. Veilsturm, her temper had got the better of her  discretion, and having left her seat, she was sweeping up and down the little  room like an angry panther in its cage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  Maraquita,&rdquo; said Griff quietly, after a pause, &ldquo;you see Lady Errington has  declared war, as I knew she would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew no more than I did,&rdquo; hissed Maraquita viciously.</p>
  <p>Major  Griff smiled at her in a pitying manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Instinct,  my dear! Instinct! I told you what was in that letter before you opened it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to kill her,&rdquo; said Cleopatra, glaring at him in a kind of cold  fury.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt you would, but, as you can&rsquo;t, why waste time in useless threats?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  she, a school-girl&mdash;a brainless fool&mdash;should dare to put such an insult on me,&rdquo;  raged Mrs. Veilsturm, clenching her fan tightly. &ldquo;How dare she? How dare she?  Does she know what I am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  does,&rdquo; replied the Major drily, &ldquo;her letter shows she does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Maraquita  looked from left to right in wrathful despair, then throwing all prudence to  the wind, snapped her fan in two, threw it on the ground, and stamped on the  fragments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish she was there! I wish she was there! What can I do to punish her? What can  I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can do nothing,&rdquo; replied Griff, examining his nails. &ldquo;To make war on Lady  Errington would be like throwing feathers at a granite image in order to hurt  it. She has an assured position in Society. You have not. She has a past that  will bear looking into&mdash;you have not. She has everything in her favour&mdash;you have  nothing, so be a philosopher, my dear Maraquita. Grin and bear it. Vulgar  certainly, but sound advice, very sound advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm turned on her dear friend in a fury, and stamped her foot on the  broken fan, looking like a demon with her blazing eyes and clenched white  teeth, which showed viciously through her drawn lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue,&rdquo; she shrieked wrathfully, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stand sneering there you fool.  Tell me what I&rsquo;m to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Major poured out another glass of sherry from the decanter on the table and  advanced towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  a glass of sherry, and keep your temper,&rdquo; he said soothingly.</p>
  <p>Cleopatra  glared at him in speechless anger, then struck the glass from his hand with  such violence that it shattered to pieces on the carpet. Griff shrugged his  shoulders, and walked back to the fireplace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  acting like a fool, Mrs. Veilsturm,&rdquo; he observed, tranquilly; &ldquo;first you broke  a fan, now you break a glass&mdash;silly, my dear, very silly! It doesn&rsquo;t hurt Lady  Errington, but only yourself. By-the-way,&rdquo; glancing at his watch, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s seven o&rsquo;clock.  I wonder when dinner will be ready, I&rsquo;m dreadfully hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  partner, however, was not listening to him, but a sudden thought seemed to have  struck her, for the fire died out of her eyes and her complexion resumed its  usual rich hue of health. After a pause, a gratified smile broke over her face,  and bending down she picked up the fan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry I broke this,&rdquo; she said, quietly, advancing towards the Major; &ldquo;it was  such a pretty fan. Dolly Thambits gave it to me. Never mind, I&rsquo;ll make him give  me another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  spoke quite cheerfully, and the Major stared at her in silent surprise at this  sudden change from intense anger to languid tranquillity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  my word, you puzzle me, Maraquita,&rdquo; he said doubtfully. &ldquo;A moment ago you were  like a devil, now you are within reasonable distance of an angel. What is the  meaning of this change?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  beautiful widow put one slender foot on the fender, looked in the glass,  touched some ornaments in her hair, then replied, in a wonderfully calm manner:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  this, that I see my way to punishing Lady Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  she is newly married, and, no doubt, loves her husband&mdash;he&rsquo;s a fool, for I&rsquo;ve  seen him in London, so through her husband I&rsquo;ll punish her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I see,&rdquo; said the Major, grimly; &ldquo;you intend to make love to the husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  acute penetration, my dear Griff! That&rsquo;s exactly what I intend to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  good,&rdquo; answered the man, shaking his head. &ldquo;Errington is newly married, and can  see no beauty in any woman save his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a fool I tell you,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Veilsturm, coolly, &ldquo;and I never met a man yet  I couldn&rsquo;t twist round my finger. He may be difficult to manage in his  character of a newly married man, but I&rsquo;ll gain my ends somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo; queried Major Griff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then,&rdquo; echoed Cleopatra, viciously, &ldquo;when I&rsquo;ve estranged him from her and  possibly led to a divorce, I&rsquo;ll have my revenge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the cost of your own position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you be afraid. I&rsquo;ll look after that! I&rsquo;ll keep my position and ruin her  happiness at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  playing with fire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fire  that will burn them, not myself! Come, dinner is ready, give me your arm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment! When do you intend to begin the business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends on Sir Guy Errington. As a newly married man, I dare say I can do  nothing with him. Newly married men sometimes get tired of honey. When he does,  then I will step in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  he does not get tired?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he will. I tell you he&rsquo;s a fool.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Perhaps  it is due to the way we live now, or possibly to the inherent restlessness of  the present generation, but Time certainly seems to pass more rapidly with us  than it did with our grandfathers.</p>
  <p>They  lived in a delightfully leisurely fashion, not without its charm, and either  stayed complacently at home, or, if they did travel, went in a sober-sides mode  by stage coach and sailing vessel. If they did make a journey through Europe,  it was called a Grand Tour, and seemed to have been somewhat after the style of  a royal progress, Judging from the stately manner in which it was conducted.  Ah, there is, no doubt, our steady-going ancestors knew the value of being  idle, an art which we have quite lost, and took life in a wonderfully sedate  way, sauntering, as it were, in an idle fashion, from the cradle to the grave.</p>
  <p>We,  alas, have changed this somnolent existence, and made the latter end of this  nineteenth century somewhat trying to a man whose health is not of the best, or  to him who desires to shine among his fellow creatures. The struggle for  existence is keener, the survival of the fittest more certain than ever, and  the art of enjoyment has resolved itself into a series of hurried glances at a  multiplicity of things.</p>
  <p>If  we want to travel, steam whirls us from one end of the world to the other,  giving us no time to examine things; if we wish to read, hundreds of books,  fresh from the press, call for attention; if we desire to enjoy ourselves,  theatres, balls, picture galleries, all offer their attractions in such  profusion, that it is difficult to know where to begin. We have gained many  aids to enjoyment, yet it is questionable if those very aids have not lost us  the faculty itself; for a breathless scamper after pleasure, with a hurried  glance here, and a momentary pause there, can hardly be called true enjoyment.  The world, and we who live therein, are so busy getting things in order for the  beginning of the next century, that all hands are pressed into the service, and  no one has a moment to be idle, or to admire the profusion of good things  spread before him.</p>
  <p>Therefore,  amid all this hurry and bustle, Time flies much more quickly than formerly; our  ancestors yawned through twelve hours of leisurely work, we scarcely find  twenty-four long enough for all we want to do. We eat, drink, marry, and give  in marriage, welcome the newly born, and forget the newly dead, with the utmost  despatch and rapidity, and no sooner is one year, with all its troubles and  breathless enjoyment, at an end, than we have mapped out the cares of the next  twelve months before they are fairly started.</p>
  <p>Eighteen  months had, therefore, passed very rapidly since the Erringtons took possession  of the Hall, and a good many important events, both to nations and individuals,  had happened in the meantime. It was now the middle of the London season, and  those who had parted months before at Como, were now about to meet again under  widely different circumstances.</p>
  <p>Victoria  Sheldon had duly returned home with Mrs. Trubbles, and taken up her abode once  more with Aunt Jelly, who was privately very glad to see her, although she took  good care that the girl should not know of such weakness on her part. She asked  Victoria a good many questions concerning the people she had met abroad, and  particularly about Otterburn, of whom Miss Sheldon gave an account quite at  variance with the real state of affairs, carefully suppressing the fact that  the young man had proposed and been refused. In fact, she passed over her  acquaintance with him so very lightly, that she succeeded in deceiving  lynx-eyed Miss Corbin as to her feelings towards him, and never, by word or  deed, hinted that he had any interest for her in any way.</p>
  <p>But  although she might deceive the world, she could not deceive herself, and in  reality she thought a good deal about the man she had rejected, regretting,  with the curious caprice of a woman, that she had done so. The manner in which  he had received her refusal had greatly impressed her, for it differed greatly  from the behaviour of her other suitors, and if Angus had only asked her again  a few months after her arrival in England, he would doubtless have gained her  consent to the marriage.</p>
  <p>Otterburn,  however, had been deeply wounded at what he deemed her unjustifiable coquetry,  and being intensely proud, resolved not to submit himself to a second slight,  therefore kept out of her way. If some kind fairy had only brought these two  foolish young people together, everything would doubtless have been arranged in  a satisfactory manner between them, but as such aid was not forthcoming, seeing  we live in times when Oberon has resigned his sceptre, they remained apart,  each in ignorance of the other&rsquo;s feelings, and mutually blamed one another for  the position of affairs.</p>
  <p>Absence,  in this case, made Victoria&rsquo;s heart grow fonder, and she felt that she was  really and truly in love with Angus, but as she neither saw nor heard of him,  she had to lock up her secret in her own breast, which did not add to the  pleasures of life.</p>
  <p>At  the invitation of Lady Errington, she went down to the Hall at Christmas, and  had a very pleasant time, despite her heart-ache, as her hostess made a great  deal of her, and the young Nimrods of the county quite lost their heads over &ldquo;Such  a jolly girl who rode so straight to hounds, taking the fences like a bird, by  Jove.&rdquo; She could have been married three or four times had she so chosen, but  neither her suitors nor their possession of houses and lands tempted her, so  she returned to town and Aunt Jelly still heart-whole, except as regarding the  little affair of Angus Macjean.</p>
  <p>During  the season she kept a keen look-out for him at all the places she went to under  the wing of Mrs. Trubbles, but Otterburn did not make his appearance, and it  was only by chance that she heard he had gone to America for some big game  shooting in the Rockies. Evidently there was no chance of his proposing a  second time, and Victoria should have put all thought of his doing so out of  her heart, but she felt that she loved him too much to do so, and hugged her  secret with all its pain closer to her breast, until she grew pale and thin, so  that Aunt Jelly became alarmed about her lungs, thinking she was going into  consumption. With this idea the old lady, who hated change, took a villa at San  Remo and stayed there for some months with Victoria and Minnie Pelch. The change  did both girls good, and when the trio returned to Town, Aunt Jelly took  Victoria a round of visits to several country houses, which proved so  successful that Miss Sheldon quite recovered her lost spirits and came back to  London eager for the pleasures of her third season in the great city.</p>
  <p>While  Victoria was thus paying the penalty of her prompt rejection of Otterburn&rsquo;s  suit, that young gentleman was having by no means a pleasant time of it  himself. The shooting expedition to the Carpathians had been a great success,  and the excitement of sport had for the time quite put Victoria out of his  head, notwithstanding the genuine love he had for the brilliant Australian  beauty. Returned to England, however, he found his thoughts constantly running  on her, and with her piquant face constantly in his mind he felt inclined to  seek her and try his luck a second time, but his pride forbade him to do so,  which was certainly a very foolish view to take of the subject.</p>
  <p>Angus,  however, was remarkably obstinate in some things, and, as he was determined not  to run the chance of a second refusal, put himself out of the way of temptation  by going up to Scotland on a visit to his father, thinking that at Dunkeld  Castle, at least, he would have peace of mind. He was mistaken in this  supposition, for his father, being delighted to find him so improved,  immediately urged on him the necessity of a speedy marriage with Miss  Cranstoun.</p>
  <p>The  Master, however, to his father&rsquo;s dismay, proved very obstinate on this point  and flatly refused to marry the lady, which refusal brought down on him the  wrath of both Lord Dunkeld and Mr. Mactab, who tried to bully the young  reprobate into acquiescence. Plain-looking Miss Cranstoun, however, proved too  much for Otterburn, seeing that the charming face of Victoria Sheldon was  constantly haunting his fancy, and notwithstanding all the arts which were  brought to bear on him, he held out against the match in the most stubborn  manner.</p>
  <p>Lord  Dunkeld raved, and Mactab quoted Scripture, all to no purpose, and at length,  becoming weary of dour looks and continual lectures, Otterburn abruptly left  his ancestral home in company with Johnnie, and, together with the chum whom he  had met in Venice, started for America in order to have some sport in the Rocky  Mountains. The wrath of the home authorities at this unexpected revolt of the  hitherto obedient Angus can be better imagined than described, but as there  seemed to be absolutely no way of bringing the young man to reason, they were  forced to let him do as he pleased. For very shame Lord Dunkeld could not cut  off the allowance of his only son, so he had to acquiesce in impotent anger in  Otterburn&rsquo;s disobedience, hoping that a lengthened tour in America would bring  the young prodigal to reason and induce him to return to Dunkeld Castle and  matrimony.</p>
  <p>Submission  such as this, however, was very far from Otterburn&rsquo;s thoughts, as he had made  up his mind not to marry Miss Cranstoun, and moreover considered he was  perfectly entitled to choose his own wife, seeing it was he who would have to  live with her, so he went off to the States with a light heart. His adventures  and that of his friends would take a long time to describe, as they had a  splendid time of it in the Rockies after big game, and becoming quite enamoured  of the uncivilized life drifted down Montana way, where they met with cow-boys  and plenty of young Englishmen who were cattle ranching in the wilds.</p>
  <p>During  this wild existence, which had such an ineffable charm for them, Otterburn told  his chum, a merry young fellow called Laxton, of his admiration for Victoria,  whereupon Laxton, being versed in affairs of the heart, lectured his friend and  advised him to once more try his luck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;ll lay two dollars,&rdquo; said this sagacious young man, who had Americanised his  speech, &ldquo;that she won&rsquo;t say &lsquo;no&rsquo; a second time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this idea in his head, Otterburn became anxious to return home, and Laxton,  being somewhat tired of primeval simplicity, consented to leave the wide  rolling prairies for the delights of Pall Mall. Laxton wanted to return in a  leisurely fashion by making for San Francisco and going home again by New  Zealand and Australia, but then he was heart-whole and had not the vision of a  charming face constantly in his mind&rsquo;s eye. This fact being urged by Otterburn  as an argument in favour of taking the shortest route possible to London,  Laxton, being really a good-natured young fellow, consented, and leaving their  delightfully savage life behind they went to New York. After a few days&rsquo; stay  in that city they went across to Liverpool by one of the big Cunarders, and  duly arrived after a pleasant passage.</p>
  <p>Laxton  went off to see his people in Yorkshire, but Otterburn did not venture to trust  himself within the grim walls of Dunkeld Castle, well knowing the stormy  reception he would meet with, so journeyed straight to the Metropolis, where he  engaged a comfortable set of chambers in the neighbourhood of Piccadilly, and  started on his matrimonial campaign with a dogged determination to succeed in  winning Victoria Sheldon for his wife, or, in case of failure, to depart for an  uninhabited island and live a Robinson Crusoe misogamistic existence till he  died.</p>
  <p>Many  events had happened in the Errington household since the young couple had  arrived at the Hall, the most important being the birth of a little boy, which  had greatly rejoiced Guy&rsquo;s heart, as he now had an heir to succeed to the  estates. Aunt Jelly also signified her approval in her own grim way, and  actually stood godmother to the child, whom she insisted on christening Henry,  after her old love, Sheldon, although no one knew or guessed her reason for  doing so.</p>
  <p>Eustace  Gartney had been right in his estimate of Alizon&rsquo;s character, for the birth of  the child transformed her from a cold statue into a loving, breathing woman,  rendered perfect by her motherhood. No one who saw her, with her delicate face  flushed with joy bending over the cradle of the child, would have thought it  was the same woman who had been so chill and impassive in her appearance and  demeanour. The cold, white snow-drop had changed into the warm, red rose, and  the passionate idolatry she had for the child seemed to fill out and complete  her life, hitherto so void and empty for the want of something to love.</p>
  <p>Guy  adored his little son, to whom, for some inexplicable reason, he gave the name  of &ldquo;Sammy,&rdquo; and laughingly averred that Alizon bestowed so much love on the son  that she had none left for the father, which assertion his wife smilingly  denied, though it was true in the main. Lady Errington gave up going out a  great deal, devoting herself entirely to the child, so Guy was left to a great  extent to himself, which he by no means relished; yet he made no complaint, as  it would have seemed ridiculous to blame a mother for being over fond of her  first born. Still, Guy felt a little sore on this point, and much as he had  desired an heir and loved his son, he almost wished the child had never been  born, so much did it seem to come between them. Had Alizon been a wise woman,  she would have seen the folly of loving her child to the exclusion of her  husband, but blinded by maternal love she neither saw nor felt anything that  did not pertain to the tiny babe she clasped so ardently to her breast.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm made no further attempt to force her friendship on Lady Errington,  but shortly after the rebuff she had received&mdash;the knowledge of which she kept  to herself&mdash;departed for a trip on the Continent, which, for her, meant Monte  Carlo, where she was afterwards joined in the most casual way by Major Griff.  The partners were too clever to travel together, as it might have attracted  attention, but when one was at any special place the other was sure to turn up  a few weeks later on business connected with the West Indian estates. So on her  return to England for the season, Mrs. Veilsturm told her dear friends that she  had sold one estate, although, as a matter of fact, the money she averred she  had received therefor was due to luck at the green tables.</p>
  <p>Cleopatra  and her friend were much more circumspect in their second season in London.  They did not wish to run the risk of any more disagreeable reports, and as  their winnings at Monte Carlo had been very large the firm was enabled to  dispense, to some extent, with baccarat on Sunday evenings. Mrs. Veilsturm  fully re-established her position in London, and the Major was more devoted  than ever, so the charming widow departed for her health to Algiers with the  good wishes of everyone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next  year, Maraquita,&rdquo; said the Major in a satisfied tone, as they discussed their  plans in a pleasant room looking out on to the blue waters of the  Mediterranean, &ldquo;we will go in for making money and then we can go off to  America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like giving up London,&rdquo; objected Mrs. Veilsturm angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must, sooner or later,&rdquo; replied Major Griff shrewdly. &ldquo;However, we will get  together as much cash next season as we can, and if no one says anything so  much the better, if they do&mdash;well, there is always America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  the end of this eighteen months Eustace Gartney returned to Town, having  heralded his appearance by a book of travels entitled &ldquo;Arabian Knights,&rdquo; in  which he described all his wanderings in the native land of Mahomet. Judging  from the brilliant descriptions given in this book with its bizarre title, he  seemed to have made good use of his time, and the fascinating pages of the  volume opened an enchanted land to Western readers. The mysterious deserts with  their romantic inhabitants, the lonely cities far in the interior, whose very  names were suggestive of the fantastic stories of the &ldquo;Thousand and One Nights,&rdquo;  the poetic descriptions of the melancholy wastes of sand, whose sadness seemed  akin to his own sombre spirit, and the wayward fierceness of the Arab  love-songs scattered like gems through the book all made up a charming volume,  and even the critics, much as they disliked Eustace for the contempt and  indifference with which he treated them, were fain to acknowledge that this &ldquo;Arabian  Knights,&rdquo; whose punning title they ridiculed, was a worthy addition to English  literature.</p>
  <p>Eustace  himself, in spite of the wide interval of time which had elapsed, was now  returning to England in very much the same frame of mind as that in which he  had set out. He had gone away to forget Alizon Errington, and he came back more  in love than ever, not with the real woman exactly but with an ideal woman whom  he had created out of her personality. He was in love with a phantom of  delight, conjured up by his vivid imagination, and fancied that she dwelt on  earth in the guise of his cousin&rsquo;s wife, but, having still some feelings of  honour left, he determined to avoid the earthly representation of his ideal, as  he hardly judged himself strong enough to withstand the temptation.</p>
  <p>With  his usual egotistical complacency&mdash;a trait which all his travelling had failed  to eradicate&mdash;he never for a moment thought of looking at the question from Lady  Errington&rsquo;s point of view. He was Sultan, and if he threw the handkerchief she  would follow, so he would be merciful both to this woman and to her husband,  and put a curb on his desire to take her to himself. He came back to England it  is true, but with the resolve only to stay a month, and then go to Egypt, as he  had an idea of exploring the land of the Pharoahs in a new direction.</p>
  <p>He  loved Alizon Errington, or rather the glorified Alizon Errington of his  imagination, and determined neither to see nor speak to her while in England,  because he did not wish to ruin Guy&rsquo;s happiness. He heard she was a mother, and  wondered if the change he had prophesied at Como had come over her. If so he  would like to see it for himself; still the flesh was weak, and he did not know  but that he might be tempted to make love to her, which would be distinctly  wrong.</p>
  <p>So  Eustace Gartney, blinded by self-complacency, prosed on to himself as he  travelled homeward in one of the Orient steamers, and the curious part of it  was that he actually believed that he was talking sense. A few sharp words from  a sensible man or woman might have dispelled his visions of being an  irresistible lover and have shown him that Lady Errington was not likely to  give up everything for the sake of a man she cared nothing about; but Eustace  made a confidant of no one, and, absorbed in his ridiculous dreamings, deemed  himself quite a hero for resisting a dishonourable impulse, which, had he given  way to it, would certainly have resulted in a manner vastly different to that  which he anticipated.</p>
  <p>So  the puppets were all on the stage, and it only remained for Fate in the guise  of a showman to move them hither and thither according to their several  destinies.</p>

  <p class="quote">&ldquo;If  friends are poor and you can&rsquo;t use &lsquo;em,<br>

  <p>Otterburn&rsquo;s  chambers in a pleasant street off Piccadilly were furnished in a very  comfortable fashion, having been the property of an extravagant young man who  came to grief on the turf, and thereupon disposed of his rooms and their  contents to Angus Macjean, who was looking for apartments. As the Master had  not much idea of arranging furniture according to individual taste, beyond  banishing some rather &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; pictures from the walls and replacing them by  hunting trophies from his American trip, he left the rooms in their original  state, which was by no means a bad one.</p>
  <p>Johnnie  Armstrong indeed had been moved to wrath by seeing such a lot of money spent on  costly trifles, for the charming little statuettes in bronze, the delicate  ornaments in Dresden china, and the thousand and one nick-nacks suggestive of  cultured taste were all so many objects of horror in the eyes of Mr. Armstrong,  being evidence of sinful waste on the part of their purchaser. In spite of his  love for the turf, the former proprietor of these rooms must have had a  cultured mind, rare among the gilded youth of to-day, as Angus during the  earlier days of his occupancy often came across some tiny water-colour, or some  rare edition of a book which showed both good taste and critical judgment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a pity for such a clever fellow as Bamfield to go to the dogs through racing,  when he could appreciate all this sort of thing,&rdquo; he said half aloud one day,  on turning over a charming edition of Villon&rsquo;s poems.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  an ill wind that blaws naebody ony guid,&rdquo; observed Johnnie, who overheard this  remark, &ldquo;an&rsquo; ye got the hail thing cheap enow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  view of the situation was quite characteristic of Johnnie. He despised the  costly furnishing of the room as sinful waste, but was quite content that all  this splendour should be paid for by someone else, seeing that his master had  got it cheap. Economy in Johnnie&rsquo;s eyes was the greatest of virtues, and he  delighted to make bargains for things which he did not want for the mere sake  of getting the better of the seller. This was not strictly speaking economy at  all, seeing that the things bought were superfluous, but it pleased Johnnie and  amused Angus, so the dour old man pottered on in his own narrow-minded way  without interruption.</p>
  <p>The  rooms, therefore, were furnished in a fashion calculated to please the most  fastidious critic, and Angus was very comfortably settled in Town for the  season. He had not yet seen Victoria, as he intended to woo his lady love in a  somewhat cautious fashion, but had asked Dolly Thambits to breakfast with a  view to finding out her movements in Society.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Thambits was a good-natured young fool, with the comfortable income of  thirty-thousand a year and not the slightest idea how to spend it. His father  having been an inventor, had made a large fortune by genuine talent and  dexterous advertising, and resolved to make his son a gentleman, in which  laudable ambition he succeeded fairly well, for Adolphus Thambits was not a bad  sort of fellow on the whole, although a monstrous fool in many ways. Not all  the tuition of Harrow and Cambridge could put any sense into his silly head,  and his father having died suddenly, he was left alone in the world with this  large income and not the slightest idea how to guide his life.</p>
  <p>For  the sake of his money he was asked everywhere, and as he always conducted  himself well, and was very good-natured, people liked him after a fashion,  although they despised and profited by his weakness of character. Cleopatra had  taken him up, and, assisted by Major Griff, was teaching him experience of the  world in a manner beneficial to herself and partner, but decidedly detrimental  to the pocket of the unfortunate Dolly.</p>
  <p>As  Angus heard that Thambits was rather smitten with Victoria, he foresaw in him a  possible rival, so had invited him to breakfast to find out Victoria&rsquo;s  movements, which Dolly would be sure to know, and also to ascertain if he had  any intention of offering himself and his large fortune to the Australian  beauty. So Dolly, who liked Otterburn in his own weak way, arrived at that  young man&rsquo;s rooms, accompanied by Mr. Jiddy, a fat, little man, with a timid  manner and a frightened eye in his head, who imposed upon Thambits&rsquo; good nature  by borrowing money from him.</p>
  <p>While  the three were seated at breakfast, somewhere about eleven o&rsquo;clock, Laxton made  his appearance, having returned from Yorkshire, where he had been playing the  part of the prodigal son. Being tired of the domestic veal, he had looked up Angus,  to propose another hunting expedition to the wilds of Africa.</p>
  <p>Laxton,  having had his breakfast, sat in a comfortable arm-chair and smoked, while  Angus and his two guests proceeded with their meal under the vigilant eye of  Johnnie Armstrong, who hovered around with an air of strong disapproval of  breakfast at such a late hour of the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Angus, old fellow,&rdquo; observed Laxton, when he had made himself at home with a  pet meerschaum of his host&rsquo;s, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you tired of civilization yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly?&rdquo;  replied Angus drily, &ldquo;seeing that I&rsquo;ve only had three weeks of it. What do you  want to do now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try  Africa&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get some elephant shooting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that rather dangerous?&rdquo; said Thambits mildly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dangerous!&rdquo;  echoed Laxton with contempt. &ldquo;Pooh! nonsense&mdash;not a bit of it. Jolliest thing  out. It&rsquo;s life, my boy&mdash;life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and on some occasions it&rsquo;s death, my boy&mdash;death,&rdquo; rejoined Angus with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have always heard,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Jiddy, who sat curled up on the edge of a  chair like a white rabbit, &ldquo;that there is no pleasure without an element of  danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  said there was,&rdquo; said Laxton, who hated Jiddy as a parasite and a milksop. &ldquo;What  do you know about danger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  replied Mr. Jiddy, who never took offence, being essentially milk and water in  his nature, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve read a good deal about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sunday-school  books, I suppose?&rdquo; said Laxton with a sneer. &ldquo; &lsquo;Little Henry and his Bearer&rsquo; is  about your style, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  read that book,&rdquo; observed Dolly with a gratified chuckle, &ldquo;but it is rather a  slow story isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  quite so rapid as Zola,&rdquo; said Otterburn, who was beginning to find both  Thambits and his friend a trifle tiresome. &ldquo;By-the-way, Laxton, have you read  the &lsquo;Arabian Knights&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have,&rdquo; said Dolly again, &ldquo;in my schooldays!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bosh!&rdquo; returned Laxton with supreme contempt. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not talking of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; chirruped Mr. Jiddy, delighted at knowing something, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the Arabian  Knights with a &lsquo;K.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  on earth are the Arabian Nights with a K?&rdquo; demanded Thambits blankly, whereupon  both Angus and Laxton burst out laughing at the bewildered look on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  Gartney&rsquo;s book about Arabia,&rdquo; explained Angus, rising from the table and  lighting a cigarette, his example being followed by his guests.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ve heard of it,&rdquo; said Thambits, complacently. &ldquo;Billy Dolser tells me he does  not think much of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Billy Dolser a judge?&rdquo; asked Laxton, with great scorn.</p>
  <p>Thambits  turned on him a look of mild reproach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course! Why he&rsquo;s got a paper of his own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that settles it!&rdquo; returned Laxton, drily. &ldquo;I thought myself it was a jolly good  book, and written by a man who knew what he was talking about, but as that  little blackguard Dolser hasn&rsquo;t been further East than Italy, he must be a  capital judge of the book!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you call him a blackguard?&rdquo; asked Jiddy, removing his cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he is one,&rdquo; growled Laxton, wrathfully&mdash;&ldquo;a mean little sneak who vilifies people&rsquo;s  character in that rag of a paper which ought to be burnt by the public hangman!  Snakes and mosquitoes were created for some purpose, I suppose, but why such a  little reptile as Dolser should be allowed to exist, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Jiddy contributed himself to the &ldquo;Pepper Box&rdquo; in an underhand way, by listening  to things he was not meant to hear, so he took up the cudgels on behalf of Mr.  Dolser in a weakly, ferocious manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I say, you know those words are actionable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  they,&rdquo; said Laxton, who had risen to his feet and was looking down from his  tall height at the scrap of limp humanity in the chair, &ldquo;you can repeat them to  Dolser if you like, and if he doesn&rsquo;t think they are actionable I&rsquo;ll be happy  to add a thrashing, so that he can have me up for assault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Jiddy wriggled, not liking the turn the conversation had taken, and resumed his  cigarette, while Otterburn, who agreed with every word Laxton said, but could  hardly endorse it in his character of host, hastened to make an observation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way, Gartney&rsquo;s in London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  come in time to hear Mr. Dolser&rsquo;s opinion about his book,&rdquo; said Laxton, grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think that would trouble Gartney much,&rdquo; replied Otterburn, smiling, &ldquo;but  after eighteen months&rsquo; travel in the wilds, I&rsquo;ll suppose he&rsquo;ll stay at home for  some time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  lay you a level fiver he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Laxton, removing his pipe, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s  got prairie fever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  prairie fever?&rdquo; demanded Dolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know what a prairie is?&rdquo; said Laxton, answering one question by asking  another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  large field, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mr. Jiddy, complacently. Angus roared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a very large field,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;much larger than any you&rsquo;ll get in England. I  shot that buffalo on the prairie,&rdquo; he added, pointing to a huge shaggy head  adorning the opposite wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a very large head,&rdquo; observed Mr. Jiddy, wisely. &ldquo;A buffalo&mdash;a kind of cow, isn&rsquo;t  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly,&rdquo; returned Laxton, drily; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s more like an enraged bull. But to  return to prairie fever. It&rsquo;s the feeling a man gets when he once sees those  undulating grass plains and which haunts him ever afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  haunts him ever afterwards?&rdquo; asked the intelligent Dolly, lighting another  cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  damn!&rdquo; retorted Laxton, politely, and turned on his heel, quite disgusted with  the ignorance of the young man. Thambits was not in the least put out by Laxton&rsquo;s  rudeness, but began to talk to Angus about Mrs. Veilsturm, while Jiddy tried to  extract a paragraph out of Laxton by a series of mild little questions about  buffaloes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Veilsturm&rsquo;s an awfully jolly woman, Macjean,&rdquo; said Thambits&mdash;&ldquo;real good sort,  you know! I think you&rsquo;d like her immensely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  I?&rdquo; replied Angus absently, wondering how he was to ask Dolly about Miss  Sheldon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  she&rsquo;s got awfully jolly Sunday evenings, you know. Are you fond of baccarat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much. Are you?&rdquo; asked Otterburn, fixing his keen grey eyes on the weak face of  the young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  rather. Only I always lose. I&rsquo;m so unlucky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you lose at Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  We play there on Sunday evenings. It&rsquo;s awfully jolly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be&mdash;for Mrs. Veilsturm!&rdquo; retorted Otterburn, doubtfully, at once forming an  unfavourable opinion of that lady; &ldquo;but if you&rsquo;re so unlucky, you shouldn&rsquo;t  play baccarat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but I&rsquo;ll win when I get to be a better player.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you? I wish you all success. Do many people go to Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  lots. All the jolliest people in town. She&rsquo;s quite in the swim you know. You  meet all sorts of pretty girls there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  Not on Sunday evening, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no; on week-days. I met that pretty Australian girl there last Thursday for the  first time this season.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?  Miss Sheldon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Awfully jolly girl. Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Slightly,&rdquo;  replied Angus, carelessly; &ldquo;I met her once in Italy. She&rsquo;s quite the belle of  London, I hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  rather. And such a nice girl! No humbug about her. Lots of fellows want to  marry her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  among the number, I suppose?&rdquo; said Otterburn, with an uneasy laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?  Oh, no! There&rsquo;s not much chance for me. I&rsquo;ve got no brains, and she doesn&rsquo;t  care for fellows who can&rsquo;t talk, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  very modest, at all events,&rdquo; said Otterburn, feeling rather amused by this candid  admission.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Thambits wisely; &ldquo;people think I&rsquo;m a fool because I&rsquo;ve  got lots of money, you know. But I see further than they think. But about Mrs.  Veilsturm&mdash;you&rsquo;ll call and see her with me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Angus, shortly; &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  going to have a fancy dress ball, soon,&rdquo; rambled on Mr. Thambits in a weakly  fashion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going as a Crusader. How do you think I&rsquo;ll look as a Crusader?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the usual thing, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Otterburn, good-naturedly suppressing a  laugh at the idea of Dolly Thambits in chain armour. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any one at  a fancy dress ball looks like what he pretends to be. I suppose Miss Sheldon  will be there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather.  Everyone in London is going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I may as well follow the example of everyone in London,&rdquo; said Otterburn,  quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call on Mrs. Veilsturm whenever you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s jolly! But, I say, I&rsquo;ve got to meet a fellow at the Carnation Club, you  know. Jiddy, I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I,&rdquo; replied Mr. Jiddy, slipping off a chair where he had been seated like a  whipped schoolboy under the severe eye of Mr. Laxton. &ldquo;Thank you for telling me  about your travels, Mr. Laxton; they&rsquo;re most entertaining.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more than you are!&rdquo; growled Laxton, grimly.</p>
  <p>Dolly  Thambits and his friend Jiddy took their departure, to the great relief of both  Angus and Laxton, who were quite sick of their frivolous small talk and  milk-and-water mannerisms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens, Macjean!&rdquo; said Laxton, when the door closed on the pair, &ldquo;what the  deuce do you have such fools here for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are fools, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; replied Otterburn, selecting a pipe from his rack; &ldquo;but  the fact is, I asked Thambits to find out something, and Mr. Jiddy came  uninvited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  his cheek! Why didn&rsquo;t you drop him out of the window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  we&rsquo;re in London&mdash;not in America,&rdquo; replied Angus, mildly; &ldquo;my dear Laxton, do  remember that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never get a chance of forgetting that,&rdquo; groaned Laxton, sitting down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick  of this narrow humdrum life. Most of the men I meet are idiots, and the women  worse. Let&rsquo;s go off to Africa, old chap. I&rsquo;ve found out all about the country,  and we&rsquo;ll get another man to join us&mdash;Helstone, you know. He&rsquo;s got a jolly  yacht, and we can take our own time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  sounds tempting,&rdquo; said Angus, wistfully; &ldquo;but you see, Laxton, I came here with  a purpose, and until I carry out that purpose I can&rsquo;t leave England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  that girl, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Angus  nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I haven&rsquo;t seen her yet, but intend to shortly. If she refuses me, I&rsquo;ll go out  to Africa with you, but if she accepts me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  demanded Laxton, grumpily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  ask you to be best man at the wedding,&rdquo; replied Angus, laughing.</p>
  <p>His  friend arose to his feet with a resigned expression of countenance, and held  out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  no good arguing with a man in love,&rdquo; he said, in a dismal tone; &ldquo;but fancy  giving up a jolly expedition for the sake of a woman! Let me know soon, as if  you don&rsquo;t go I will, for I&rsquo;m dying to get out of these clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked down with disgust at his well-fitting frock coat, grey trousers, and  neat patent leather boots, all of which he was willing to change for a rough  hunter&rsquo;s dress and a life of danger, such is the instinctive leaning of young  Englishmen towards the barbaric delights of their woad-stained ancestors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you are a queer stick, old fellow!&rdquo; said Angus, laughing; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll give up all  the comforts of life for what?&mdash;jungle fever, Liebig&rsquo;s Extract, and a dangerous  existence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  prose, my boy,&rdquo; retorted Laxton good-humouredly, taking up his hat, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d do  the same if you weren&rsquo;t in love. Well, goodbye at present. I&rsquo;ll look you up  again, and if you want to see me in the meantime, just drop a line to the Globe  Trotters&rsquo; Club.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  he departed Angus stood for a moment in deep thought, filling his pipe, with a  strange smile on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  in love am I?&rdquo; he said, striking a match. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true enough, but  whether it&rsquo;s a wise thing to be in love is quite another affair! Humph!&rdquo;  lighting his pipe, &ldquo;it all depends on Victoria.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  picked up the morning paper, and was about to settle himself down for a good  read, when a knock came to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  it!&rdquo; grumbled Otterburn, folding up the paper, as he heard Johnnie Armstrong  going to the door. &ldquo;I wonder who that is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  question was answered in another moment by himself, for suddenly a massive  figure appeared at the door of the small sitting-room, and Otterburn sprang to  his feet with a cry of pleasure:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eustace  Gartney.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
    From Foreign Parts</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I  have come from lands fantastic,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the desert sands environ,<br>
Where the Koran&rsquo;s laws adrastic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bind the soul in chains of iron.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;All  the land is full of magic,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danger &lsquo;neath delight reposes,<br>
  Love is fierce and dark and tragic.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cypress mingles with the roses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Eustace Gartney in the flesh, returned to quiet old England after his  perilous wanderings in distant lands beyond the verge of civilization, and  Otterburn felt most unaccountably glad to see him once more. Why this should be  the case seems somewhat strange, seeing that they had tired of one another in  their former intimacy, and parted with mutual satisfaction, yet in the heart of  each there lurked a kindly feeling which cast a certain glamour round their old  friendship, and made them mutually glad to meet again.</p>
  <p>Otterburn  shook the hand of his former Mentor with genuine pleasure, thrust him into the  most comfortable chair in the room, and prepared to ask a series of breathless questions  as to all that had taken place since their parting at Venice so many months  ago. Eustace, on his part, felt a little touched by this enthusiastic  reception, and was glad to think that at least one friend remembered him in a  kindly manner.</p>
  <p>They  had both changed in outward appearance since their last meeting, Gartney being  much thinner than formerly, but his face, lean and brown, still retained its  dreamy expression, which was, indeed, deepened by his habit of thoughtful  self-communings in solitary deserts. For the rest, he was as badly dressed as  ever, being now arrayed in a loose suit of grey home-spun, which would have  startled the accurately dressed denizens of St. James&rsquo; Street on the person of  any one else but Eustace Gartney. But, then, he was a privileged person, and,  as his poetic book of travels had rendered him more famous than ever, his  former friends greeted him heartily, all of which greetings, although kindly  meant, Eustace estimated in a cynical fashion at their proper value, until  genuinely touched by the boyish and demonstrative affection of Otterburn.</p>
  <p>That  young man, on his part, had wonderfully improved from the slender boy of  eighteen months before, for, although the space of time seems short, Macjean  was at that age when the change from adolescence to manhood is very sudden and  very marked. The semi-uncivilized life he had led had also a great deal to do  with the shaping of his physical characteristics, and he was more manly, more  self-reliant, and more matured in every way than the unformed youth from whom  Eustace had parted. A heavy moustache adorned his upper lip, he carried himself  in a dashing, self-confident manner, and the tones of his voice were deeper and  more mellow than formerly. Still he retained that boyish, impulsive manner that  had so fascinated the cynical man of the world, and Eustace looked upon him  approvingly, as he leaned forward in his chair, with eager eyes and parted  lips, anxious to hear all about the elder man&rsquo;s adventures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a jolly time you&rsquo;ve had, Gartney!&rdquo; said Otterburn, gaily, &ldquo;but, by Jove, what a  queer fish you are. You started for a month&rsquo;s tour in Cyprus, and you end up by  a year and a half&rsquo;s exploration of Arabia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  seductive influence of travel drew me onward,&rdquo; replied Gartney, crossing his  legs and folding his hands. &ldquo;After all you might as well have come with me that  time at Venice, instead of going off to Central Europe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ve been to America since then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  so I heard. Same man you went that Carpathian trip with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Awfully good sort of fellow, but a mania for wild life. He was here a few  minutes ago, wanting me to start off to Africa on another expedition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you, being very comfortably settled here, declined.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather!  I like breathing time you know. Will you have a cigarette?&rdquo; said Angus, holding  out his open case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you. I&rsquo;ve contracted the vice of pipe-smoking,&rdquo; replied Eustace,  producing a well-worn briar-root, and filling it leisurely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got very  pleasant rooms here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  are they not? I bought the whole box and dice just as they stand from Bamfield.  Got them at a bargain, much to the delight of Johnnie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Johnnie still with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course! he&rsquo;s part and parcel of my life, and circumnavigated the globe with me,  like a Scotch Sir Francis Drake. Do you want a light? Here you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  struck a match, and handed it to Eustace, who lighted his pipe, and then leaned  contentedly back in his chair, listening to the vivacious chatter of the young  man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you know your book has been a great success,&rdquo; said Otterburn, pointing  to a copy on the table, &ldquo;there it is. I got it as soon as it was published.  Some of the critics, however, have been giving it fits, especially the chapter  called &lsquo;The Puritans of Islam.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  And what do the critics know about the Wahhabees?&rdquo; asked Eustace, with calm  surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;According  to their own showing, everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  we all know the omniscience of critics! They are truly wonderful men, before  whose vast experience and knowledge I remain dumb. And the rapidity of their  work, their marvellous grasp of every subject in literature, from a Child&rsquo;s  Primer to a novel of George Meredith&rsquo;s. Nothing appalls them, nothing daunts  them. Oh, what wonderful men they are! truly wonderful, so calm, so learned, so  kind-hearted. Why do you know, Macjean, I met a critic once who thought nothing  of Dickens as an author! Think of that! Think of the wonderful mind of that man  who could afford to speak contemptuously about one of the master spirits of the  age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he write books himself?&rdquo; asked Otterburn, shrewdly, at which Eustace looked at  him in grave reproof.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not,&rdquo; he replied quietly, &ldquo;he was a most self-denying man. He did write  one novel I believe, but it was so far in advance of our present age that the  publisher was afraid to print it&mdash;fancy that, a publisher afraid! Well, it was  so, and now this critic only reviews other people&rsquo;s books&mdash;what self-denial. And  then his decisions. Why he makes up his mind about a book, that has taken  months to write, in five minutes. I&rsquo;ve known him analyse a book without cutting  the leaves to read it. Of course it is marvellous, simply marvellous, but our  age is prolific in such clever men. I&rsquo;ve met many such, and always felt like a  whipped schoolboy before their calm, clear gaze. If you boil down twenty of our  best authors you may make one critic, but then it&rsquo;s quality not quantity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you did not like critics?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  like critics, my dear fellow?&rdquo; said Eustace sweetly, &ldquo;why they are my dearest  friends, my best benefactors. They always read my books, and give half an hour  to each, actually a whole half hour. What friendship! And then, you know, they  are so kind, they point out all my mistakes, and if I copy any ideas of foreign  authors, they always look them up to see if I have done so correctly, and  mention it&mdash;really mention it&mdash;in their articles. If there is anything naughty in  my chapters, they reprove me, oh, so kindly, and tell the public where to look  for the worst bits. And then they are so modest; they never tell me they wrote  these articles, when I meet them in society. I always put my name to my books,  they never do to their articles, and yet my books are full of mistakes which  they try to correct for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  kind of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  is it not? I wish I was a critic, Angus, instead of a poor author. I am always  wrong, you know, and they are constantly right, but then I don&rsquo;t know so much  as they do. When I write a book I&rsquo;ve to see things for myself, but they can sit  down and correct me without going outside the four walls of their study. What a  pity Shakespeare had not critics in his day! They would have pointed out all  the defects in Hamlet, and good-naturedly corrected Lear for him. I daresay  they would have shown him how to improve his blank verse. It does need  improving, you know, because I heard a poet say so the other day. A real poet,  much better than Browning or Tennyson, only he wasn&rsquo;t known so well. Just twenty-two  years of age, and yet could talk like that&mdash;wonderful. But don&rsquo;t speak any more  about critics, because I&rsquo;m so fond of them that I could praise them for hours.  Let us talk of meaner things. Tell me all the news of the day, the scandals of  the hour, the gossip of the drawing-rooms, and stories of clubs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faith,  I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve much to tell you,&rdquo; said Otterburn candidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been  on the war-path as well as yourself, so am just an ignorant of town as you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gartney  smoked on quietly for a few moments, and then suddenly asked the question  nearest his heart:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the Erringtons, Macjean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; replied Angus carelessly, &ldquo;as I have not seen them  since you did at Como. I believe they are still living at their place in the  country, and that Lady Errington has presented her husband with a son and heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I heard that,&rdquo; said Gartney, with a slight smile. &ldquo;I wonder if my prophecy has  come true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!&mdash;what  prophecy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  the Incomplete Madonna.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I remember now,&rdquo; responded Otterburn indolently, &ldquo;you said she was  unfinished, didn&rsquo;t you? Well, I suppose she&rsquo;s happy now, as she has gained her  heart&rsquo;s desire and become a mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt she&rsquo;s happy,&rdquo; said Eustace significantly; &ldquo;but what about her husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know! You seem to take a great interest in the Erringtons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  flushed a little under the bronze colour of his skin, and moved uneasily in his  seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I? A mere whim, I assure you, to see if my prophecy about the incomplete Madonna  turns out correct. But never mind, I&rsquo;m going to call on Aunt Jelly this  afternoon, and she&rsquo;ll give me more accurate information than you can. Have you  met Aunt Jelly yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  You forget I told you I have been away from England also,&rdquo; answered Otterburn  stiffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True!  I forgot that, but you see my dear relations haven&rsquo;t written a word to me since  I&rsquo;ve been away, and I&rsquo;m obliged to ask a stranger for information. Is Aunt  Jelly&rsquo;s ward married yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  she is still Miss Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were rather fond of her, were you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  fond of her that I asked her to be my wife at Como, and she refused me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guessed as much,&rdquo; replied Eustace calmly; &ldquo;however, that was merely a boyish  fancy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon. No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  You don&rsquo;t mean to say you are in love with Victoria Sheldon still?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn  arose to his feet with an angry laugh, and began to walk slowly to and fro with  his hands in his pockets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there anything so extraordinary in that? I loved Miss Sheldon and she refused  to marry me, so I tried to forget her. Well, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten her, and I&rsquo;ve  come back to Town expressly to ask her to be my wife. I daresay I&rsquo;m a fool, but  you&rsquo;re not in love, and cannot understand the feeling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I not!&rdquo; answered Gartney serenely, thinking of Lady Errington, &ldquo;well, I don&rsquo;t  know so much about that. Have you met Miss Sheldon yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doesn&rsquo;t sound like an eager lover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Angus coolly, &ldquo;but you see I&rsquo;ve learnt sense  since my first rebuff, and now gang warily, as the Scotch say. I&rsquo;m not going to  let Miss Sheldon see I care two straws about her till I find out the state of  her feelings towards me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Astute  diplomatist!&mdash;then I suppose you won&rsquo;t call with me on my respected aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  meet Miss Sheldon!&mdash;hardly! I&rsquo;m going to wait till I see her at a fancy-dress  ball Mrs. Veilsturm gives shortly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Eustace, removing his pipe, &ldquo;is that lady still in the flesh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  much so, indeed According to Mr. Adolphus Thambits&mdash;of whom you&rsquo;ve no doubt  heard&mdash;her house is quite a fashionable centre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gartney  made a gesture of disgust, and arose to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Lord! what are we coming to? I thought people would have found out Mrs.  Veilsturm and her scamp of a Major long ago. I met them last time I was in  London. I suppose they still have the little Sunday evenings, and talk about  the West Indian estates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I believe so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  I should not have thought Aunt Jelly would have let her ward visit Mrs.  Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? She is in the odour of sanctity&mdash;no one knows her little peccadilloes, or,  if they do, don&rsquo;t talk about them. I suppose few people except the initiated  know about the real business of those Sunday evenings. Mrs. Veilsturm is all  white&mdash;on the surface&mdash;so not even her dearest friend can throw mud at her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are getting quite eloquent, Otterburn,&rdquo; observed Eustace smiling; &ldquo;I suppose,  when you&rsquo;re married and settled we&rsquo;ll hear of you in Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not married and settled yet!&mdash;perhaps I never will be,&rdquo; replied Otterburn  gloomily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t seem very hopeful,&rdquo; remarked Eustace, with gentle sarcasm, &ldquo;but as you  won&rsquo;t come to Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s, suppose I play the part of Cupid&rsquo;s messenger, and  find out how the land lies with Victoria Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you only would,&rdquo; cried Angus eagerly; &ldquo;but no! I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s not much  chance for me. I daresay she has forgotten I ever existed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if that is the case I&rsquo;ll soon improve her memory! Cheer up&mdash;while there&rsquo;s life  there&rsquo;s hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  always,&rdquo; responded Angus gloomily, &ldquo;particularly in this case. I called her a  coquette last time we parted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt she fully deserved the name, if I remember rightly,&rdquo; said Eustace drily,  putting on his hat, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;ll remember you for that out of spite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  do what you like, Gartney,&rdquo; replied Otterburn, grasping his friend&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  awfully glad to see you safe and sound once more. When will you look me up  again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not quite sure! I&rsquo;ve got to see Aunt Jelly first&mdash;my lawyers second&mdash;about a  dozen tradesmen, to make myself respectable, and then I am going to run down  home for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know you had a home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes!&mdash;the cot where I was born, and all that kind of thing. A tumble-down old  place, looking out on to the German Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  don&rsquo;t let me lose sight of you yet,&rdquo; said Macjean, accompanying his guest to  the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&mdash;by-the-way,  I&rsquo;ll come back and tell you my impressions of Miss Sheldon, and you can shape  your course accordingly&mdash;in love with the same woman for eighteen months! Good  Lord! what constancy! Ah, Johnnie and how are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brawly!  Brawly! thank ye for speiring, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Armstrong, who stood holding  the door open, &ldquo;may I tac&rsquo; the leeberty of obsairving, sir, that ye look a wee  bit brown, it&rsquo;s the weather na doot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it, Johnnie&mdash;the sun, my man, the sun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hech!  Hech! Au thocht it was the dochter,&rdquo; replied Johnnie, laughing at his own wit.</p>
  <p>Eustace  did not take offence, as Johnnie&rsquo;s dour ways rather amused him, so he laughed  also and departed, while Angus went back to his dressing-room to get ready for  paying a round of visits.</p>

    Aunt Jelly Discusses Family Affairs</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;You  know the marriage service where it says&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Whom God hath joined let no man put asunder,&rsquo;<br>
    That answers for an interfering third,<br>
    Who sows dissension in a happy home;<br>
    But wife and husband can do just the same,<br>
    Unless there&rsquo;s give and take betwixt the pair,<br>
    Black looks, neglect, hard words, and other ills,<br>
    Will put asunder A and B new wed,<br>
    As surely as if C had played the rogue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly was a lady whom everyone judged best to leave alone, as she, being of a  tart and aggressive nature, was disposed to be exceedingly disagreeable when  meddled with. Old Father Time appeared to be of the same opinion, for he never  seemed to come near her in any way, and though year after year went by,  changing youth to age, dimming bright eyes, whitening heads brown and golden,  and turning mellow voices to shrill trebles, Miss Corbin still preserved the  same grim appearance, as if she was indeed the granite figure to which so many  of her friends likened her. If Time did add another wrinkle in a stealthy way,  or make her blood course more slowly through her withered frame, he did it in  such a manner that no one, not even the closest observer, could notice it; and  Aunt Jelly, straight and defiant as ever, sat grimly silent in her chair,  knitting, knitting, knitting, as though she were some immortal hag weaving the  destinies of short-lived humanity.</p>
  <p>The  old lady had heard of Eustace&rsquo;s return from abroad, and was in a high state of  indignation that he had not called to see her as soon as he arrived in Town,  but having received a note from him saying he would pay her a visit that  afternoon, she was now waiting with the firm determination to give him an  unpleasant reception.</p>
  <p>Victoria  had already gone out in the carriage to do some shopping for the old dame, and  no one was with Miss Corbin except Minnie Pelch, who, more tearful than ever,  was seated at the window, like Sister Anne, watching for the approach of Mr.  Gartney.</p>
  <p>The  room had the same old-fashioned look about it, save that here and there a bunch  of flowers or some dainty feminine adornment showed that Victoria Sheldon had  striven to make things somewhat more home-like. Aunt Jelly sat in her chair  with woolly-haired Coriolanus at her feet, and knitted on in severe silence, only  opening her mouth every now and then to speak to the tearful Miss Pelch.</p>
  <p>That  young-old lady was in a state of suppressed excitement at the prospect of  seeing Eustace again, as she contemplated making a final assault on him  regarding the publication of her poems, but Aunt Jelly had so harassed and  worried her, that she was reduced to a state of extreme limpness, and wept in a  stealthy manner, making her eyes red, which by no means added to the beauty of  her appearance.</p>
  <p>The  port and sherry decanters were on the table with the usual plate of cake, for  though Miss Corbin intended to give Eustace a disagreeable reception she did  not think of neglecting the duties of hospitality; fulfilled in her eyes by the  production of cake and wine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Miss Corbin sharply, for the seventh time, &ldquo;is he coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet,&rdquo; replied Minnie meekly, after the fashion of Sister Anne.</p>
  <p>Miss  Corbin snorted like an old war-horse, tossed her head in an indignant manner,  and resumed her work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  my young days,&rdquo; she observed at length in her usual harsh fashion, &ldquo;the juniors  were always civil to the seniors. Civility cost nothing then&mdash;now it appears to  be unpurchasable. Eh! what do you say, Minnie? Nothing!&mdash;it&rsquo;s your sniffling  then! how often have I told you to correct that habit. Look again&mdash;is he coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet,&rdquo; answered Miss Pelch once more, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t ask you the time,&rdquo; rejoined Aunt Jelly tartly. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re going  to worry him about that poetry of yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to ask him to get it published,&rdquo; said Minnie with tearful dignity, &ldquo;bound  in blue and gold with my portrait at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  child,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, pausing a moment, &ldquo;how you do build castles in the  air. Well, I hope my nephew will help you to do what you wish. Nobody will read  the book except the critics, and they&rsquo;ll abuse you. If they do,&rdquo; continued Miss  Corbin, shaking her finger, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t come to me for sympathy, for I&rsquo;ve warned  you. Is he coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  cried Minnie, in a state of excitement, seeing a hansom rattle round the corner  and pull up before the door, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in a cab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed, couldn&rsquo;t walk I suppose,&rdquo; grumbled Miss Corbin grimly, &ldquo;better for his  pocket and his liver if he did. Hand me that last volume of his rubbish,  Minnie, I&rsquo;ve got a few words to say about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minnie  obediently did as she was told and Aunt Jelly took the heavy book on her knee,  while the door was flung open by the butler, who announced in his usual pompous  voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Eustace Gartney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do, Aunt Jelly?&rdquo; said Eustace, walking across to the old lady as if he  had only parted with her the day before, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t look a day older.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t return the compliment&rdquo; replied Miss Corbin, presenting her  withered cheek to be saluted. &ldquo;Arabia hasn&rsquo;t done you much good, at all events.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  as candid as ever, I see,&rdquo; said Gartney carelessly, turning to Minnie. &ldquo;I hope  you are well, Miss Pelch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  quite, thank you, dear Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; answered Minnie, in a state of fluttering  excitement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so delighted to see you back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  kind of you,&rdquo; murmured Eustace, taking a seat in the chair Minnie pushed  forward for him. &ldquo;Well, Aunt Jelly, and how has the world been using you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same as I&rsquo;ve been using it,&rdquo; retorted Miss Jelly epigrammatically. &ldquo;I keep the  world at its distance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  oil paintings. They always look best at a distance, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk books to me,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had quite enough of your smart  sayings in this,&rdquo; touching the volume on her lap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I see! I told my publishers to send you a copy. I hope you like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do very, very much,&rdquo; cried Minnie clasping her hands, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s simply too lovely  for anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  critics don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly spitefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I suppose you agree with the critics,&rdquo; replied Eustace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear me say so?&rdquo; demanded his aunt fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  don&rsquo;t cry out till you are hurt. Take a glass of wine&mdash;Minnie, the wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Pelch poured out the wine with trembling hand, so excited she was at the  presence of the great author, and Eustace, knowing his aunt&rsquo;s determination on  the subject of port, drank it meekly although it was a wine he hated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  book,&rdquo; said Miss Corbin, after a pause, &ldquo;is not at all bad. I daresay there are  a good many lies in it, still they&rsquo;re decently told lies. You&rsquo;ve improved this  time, Eustace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, my dear aunt, I&rsquo;m glad to have your good opinion, but the critics&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Critics,&rdquo;  snorted Aunt Jelly scornfully, &ldquo;do you mean those idiots that scribble for the  papers and who would abuse their parents for two pence three farthings? Pooh! I  don&rsquo;t call those critics. In the palmy days of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> there were decent reviewers, but now&mdash;rubbish! they write nothing but drivel,  though to be sure it&rsquo;s drivel they criticise. I&rsquo;m not talking about your book,  Eustace, my dear. It&rsquo;s good!&mdash;very good, and I wouldn&rsquo;t say so if I didn&rsquo;t think  so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Eustace meekly. &ldquo;And how are things, aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  kind of things, child? Be more explicit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  my cousin Errington, is he all right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  right enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  his wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  a fool,&rdquo; remarked Aunt Jelly politely, at which Eustace felt quite indignant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you know about it?&rdquo; retorted the old lady sharply. &ldquo;I tell you she is a  fool. Guy was up to see me the other day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you can hardly expect me to believe that Guy spoke like that to you about his  wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  said he did, you blind bat? Don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions, Eustace, for you&rsquo;re not  clever enough to land at them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  tell me why you speak of Lady Errington like this&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  take my own time and own way of telling things,&rdquo; replied Miss Jelly  deliberately. &ldquo;Minnie, my dear, go upstairs and look for your poetry, I daresay  Mr. Gartney will glance at it before he goes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minnie  had her precious manuscript in her pocket, but knowing from Miss Corbin&rsquo;s hint  that she wanted to discuss private affairs with her nephew, meekly retreated  from the room, closing the door quietly after her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done that you should inflict Minnie&rsquo;s poetry on me,&rdquo; said  Eustace in an injured tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh,  nonsense! don&rsquo;t be selfish. It gives the poor child pleasure to have her  milk-and-water rubbish looked at by you. Do a kind action for once in your  life, Eustace. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s little enough you do for your fellow-creatures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  aren&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay, but no doubt they make the same remark about you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  don&rsquo;t bother about my failings, Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; said Eustace impatiently, &ldquo;tell me  about the Erringtons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  just this,&rdquo; observed Miss Jelly, letting her knitting fall on her lap, &ldquo;you  know how fond Guy is of that wife of his, a piece of ice with no more feeling  in her than that pair of tongs. Well, since this child was born, she has  changed altogether, nothing but love and affection, and the Lord knows what!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the better for Guy, I should say,&rdquo; said Eustace, who knew what was coming.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the worse you mean,&rdquo; retorted his aunt. &ldquo;Bless my soul, I don&rsquo;t mind the woman  melting, no one could go on loving such an icicle, but she&rsquo;s melted the wrong  way, and every particle of affection she has is given to the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  that&rsquo;s only natural.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  nothing of the sort, sir,&rdquo; objected Aunt Jelly energetically. &ldquo;Why should a  woman love nothing but her child, and take no more notice of her husband than  if he was a sign-post? Every woman ought to love her children, certainly, but  they owe something to the father of the children as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt! but perhaps Guy exaggerates his wife&rsquo;s neglect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly shook her head in a doubtful manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; she replied, deliberately, &ldquo;Guy isn&rsquo;t the man to cry out,  unless he&rsquo;s hurt. From what he says, it appears Alizon is always with the  child, and the poor lad is left to wander about by himself. Sometimes, she won&rsquo;t  even come to meals. Now, that can&rsquo;t possibly be right, can it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I suppose not,&rdquo; answered Eustace, after a pause, wondering to himself at  finding his prophecy so literally fulfilled, &ldquo;but, perhaps, the child is ill,  and needs care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child is as well as you are,&rdquo; retorted Aunt Jelly, snappishly, &ldquo;though that is  not saying much, for you look as if you were sickening for some disease, but in  plain words Alizon is neglecting her husband in the most silly manner for the  child. If this is the case, how will it end?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  never know anything! Then I&rsquo;ll tell you, they&rsquo;ll learn to do without one  another, and that&rsquo;s a bad thing. She&rsquo;ll be all right, because she&rsquo;s got the  child, but Guy&rsquo;s got nothing, and he&rsquo;s not the man to put-up with such  treatment. If she neglects him, he&rsquo;ll find consolation with some other woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  aunt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  shocked you, have I?&rdquo; said the old lady grimly. &ldquo;Get your nerves better under  control, then. I call a spade a spade, and am telling you the truth. If Alizon  Errington goes on like this, the first woman that comes along will snap up her  husband, and the consequence will be of her own making.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; demanded Eustace, blankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, with an air of vexation, resuming her  knitting. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see the affair end in the Divorce Court, and that&rsquo;s  the direction it&rsquo;s going in at present. Guy was up the other day, and told me  some long rigmarole about his feelings, so the best thing you can do is to go  down to the Hall, and see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo;  cried Eustace, jumping to his feet in a state of agitation. &ldquo;I can do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  a glass of wine, my dear, take a glass of wine,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, sharply. &ldquo;Your  nerves are all crooked. That comes of gadding about the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  made no reply to this onslaught, but walked to and fro in silence. He was  considerably puzzled how to act in this dilemma, as he had made up his mind not  to see Lady Errington, thinking his feelings towards her were too strong for  him to keep silence. Curiously enough it never seemed to strike him that as  Alizon was neglecting her own husband for the child, it was unlikely she would  respond to his passion in any way, seeing that she had neither eyes nor ears  for anything save her first-born. Gartney&rsquo;s egotism blinded him on this occasion,  as it did on many others, but he felt that he was being forced into a  situation, towards the woman he loved, from whence there was no escape. Looking  at it in his narrow-minded fashion, it seemed a struggle between love and  honour, and he was undecided how to act. All his life, however, he had been  accustomed to deny himself nothing, and in this case he carried out his ruling  principle of selfishly gratifying himself, so there and then made up his mind  to accept Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s mission and go down to Errington Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Eustace,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly sharply, quite unaware of the struggle going on in  her nephew&rsquo;s mind, &ldquo;what do you say&mdash;will you do a kind action for once in your  life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  having made up his mind, came slowly back to his elderly relation and resumed  his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry you&rsquo;ve got such a bad opinion of me, Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; he said coolly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll  have much pleasure in proving you&rsquo;re wrong for once in your life, by going down  to Ellington Hall, and having a talk with Guy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; replied Miss Corbin, much gratified. &ldquo;And I suppose you&rsquo;ll have a look  at your own place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so, you never did a thing in your life without a double motive,&rdquo; said  Aunt Jelly, unjustly. &ldquo;However, I don&rsquo;t care two straws what you go down for,  so long as you try and put things right between those two idiots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kindly  opinion you&rsquo;ve got of human nature, Aunt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt, I have,&rdquo; retorted Miss Jelly, coolly, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s human nature&rsquo;s own  fault, not mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you remember what wise La Rochefoucauld says?&rdquo; observed Eustace, thoughtfully. &ldquo; &lsquo;Many  people judge the world as if they were its judges, and not its denizens.&rsquo; That  is true, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like your cut and dried wisdom, Mr. Quoter-of-old-saws,&rdquo; replied Aunt  Jelly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s sure to be a flaw in it somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  laughed and leaned back in his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  got an answer for everything, Aunt Jelly! Well, I&rsquo;ll go down to Errington, and  do my best, but I&rsquo;m doubtful of success. It&rsquo;s foolish work meddling between man  and wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Corbin sniffed in a doubtful manner, and was about to make some bitter reply,  when the door opened and Victoria, bright and piquant as ever, entered the  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  I am, Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; she cried gaily, &ldquo;with not one of your orders forgotten&mdash;Mr.  Gartney!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do, Miss Sheldon?&rdquo; said that gentleman rising from his seat, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s some  time since we met.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  memory of their ill-concealed enmity at Como, and of the circumstances under  which, she had parted from Otterburn, all rushed suddenly into Victoria&rsquo;s mind,  and she blushed deeply, but with her usual self-command she suppressed all  other signs of emotion, as she held out her hand frankly to Eustace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  eighteen months since we last saw one another,&rdquo; she said, equably, &ldquo;and since  then, judging from your book, you have been leading a delightfully dangerous  life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  fool he!&rdquo; muttered Aunt Jelly disdainfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you, Miss Sheldon,&rdquo; said Eustace, taking no notice of the old lady&rsquo;s  ill-nature, &ldquo;what kind of a life have you been leading?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Victoria  slipped into a chair, and took off her gloves carelessly, though, truth to  tell, her heart was beating somewhat rapidly at this meeting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the usual London life!&rdquo; she replied nonchalantly. &ldquo;Theatre, Park, Ball, Church&mdash;Church,  Ball, Park, Theatre. The only change you can get is to reverse them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  young girls don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy yourselves in a rational way,&rdquo; said Miss  Corbin, politely; &ldquo;you ought to marry and settle down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  your advice to everyone, Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; retorted Victoria, her cheeks growing  hot; &ldquo;but you have not practised what you now preach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Circumstances  alter cases, child,&rdquo; returned Aunt Jelly, composedly. &ldquo;I had my reasons&mdash;you, no  doubt, would call them ridiculous reasons&mdash;but they were good enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Victoria  did not know of the old love romance between her father and this faded beauty,  or she would never have spoken as she did; but as Miss Corbin, with a softened  look in her eyes, bent over her work, she felt vaguely that this sharp-tongued  woman had suffered, and touched the withered hand with a pretty gesture of  penitence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose you have quite forgotten Como, Miss Sheldon?&rdquo; said Eustace, remembering  his promise to Otterburn, and artfully trying to find out if she still  remembered the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no! I liked Como very much! The scenery was delightful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  spoke quietly enough, but Eustace was an acute observer of human nature, and  his keen ear caught an inflection of a tremor in her voice which considerably  guided him in framing his next remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the scenery was charming, was it not?&rdquo; he remarked significantly; &ldquo;and the  friends we met there also. What a pleasant party we were. The Erringtons, Mrs.  Trubbles, yourself and&mdash;Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what has become of Mr. Macjean?&rdquo; she asked in a low voice, taking up Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s  ball of wool.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Otterburn is in London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  London!&rdquo; she echoed, starting violently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  me, Victoria,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, snappishly, &ldquo;how nervous you are, child! You&rsquo;ve  upset my wool all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Victoria,  glad of an excuse to hide her face, bent down to pick up the ball, and Aunt  Jelly, having caught Otterburn&rsquo;s name, went on talking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Otterburn,  eh? I know that name. Wasn&rsquo;t that the young man you flirted with at Como,  Victoria?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t flirt with him,&rdquo; cried Victoria, raising her head defiantly. &ldquo;At least,&rdquo;  she added, catching sight of Gartney&rsquo;s keen eye fixed on her, &ldquo;at least, not  much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so like you, child,&rdquo; observed Aunt Jelly, disentangling her yarn, &ldquo;you will  play with fire&mdash;some day you&rsquo;ll burn your fingers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  that catastrophe has happened already,&rdquo; said Eustace quickly.</p>
  <p>Miss  Sheldon laughed in a somewhat artificial manner at this remark, and promptly  denied it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure it hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, looking straight at Eustace with crimson cheeks. &ldquo;I  take too good care of myself for that. But talking about Mr. Macjean, how is it  I have not seen him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Gartney carelessly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only been a short time  in Town, you know. I wanted him to come here to-day, but he was engaged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Victoria  felt all her old hatred of Eustace revive as he spoke the last words, as she  felt sure he was talking sarcastically, and would have liked to reply sharply,  but she could hardly do so without betraying an unwonted interest in Otterburn,  which might have placed lynx-eyed Aunt Jelly on the <i>qui vive</i>, so wisely  held her tongue.</p>
  <p>Eustace  himself, being satisfied that Victoria still felt an interest in his young  friend, inwardly congratulated himself on the result of his diplomacy, and  arose to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye,  Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; he said, kissing his relative. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down home to-morrow and  tell you what I&rsquo;ve done on my return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Eustace,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, much pleased; &ldquo;have a glass of wine before  you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you,&rdquo; replied Gartney, walking to the door, &ldquo;one glass is enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weak  head,&rdquo; muttered Aunt Jelly, &ldquo;just like your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  than a weak character,&rdquo; retorted Eustace, gaily. &ldquo;<i>Au revoir</i>, Miss  Sheldon. I&rsquo;ll tell Mr. Macjean I&rsquo;ve seen you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Victoria hastily, then, feeling that she had committed an error,  strove to mend it. &ldquo;I mean yes, of course I&rsquo;ll be very pleased to see Mr.  Macjean again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt you will,&rdquo; muttered Eustace to himself, as he got into his cab; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s  still in love with him, so Otterburn has only to ask and to have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gartney would hardly have been so confident had he seen Victoria at that  moment, for she had ran hastily up to her room and was lying on her bed in a  passion of tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wouldn&rsquo;t come and see me, I suppose,&rdquo; she said viciously. &ldquo;Oh, very well, I&rsquo;ll  punish him for this. He&rsquo;s forgotten all about me, but I&rsquo;ll make him propose  again if it&rsquo;s only for the pleasure of refusing him.&rdquo;</p>

    The Old House By The Sea</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Curs&rsquo;d  by Superstition eerie,<br>
    Grim it stands a ruin dreary,<br>
    Round it spread the marshes lonely,<br>
    Haunted by dim shadows only,<br>
    Shadows of an evil seeming,<br>
    Such as rise in ghastly dreaming,<br>
    Overhead the sky of crimson,<br>
    Reddens slowly from the dim sun,<br>
    Silently the sluggish waters<br>
    Undermine the tower which totters,<br>
    And the ocean&rsquo;s sullen boom,<br>
    Prophesies the coming doom,<br>
    When the house shall sudden sink,<br>
    Shattered o&rsquo;er destruction&rsquo;s brink,<br>
    And the dark night&rsquo;s gloomy pall<br>
    Evermore brood over all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace,  with his whimsical fancy for bestowing appropriate names on all things, had christened  his ancestral residence Castle Grim, and he certainly could not have hit upon a  happier title for such a dreary place.</p>
  <p>Standing  on the verge of wide-spreading marshes, it faced towards the sea, which was  only a little distance away, and the salt winds from the ocean roared day and  night round the lonely house. For it was lonely, no habitation being within  miles, owing to the malaria which arose from the marshes making the whole  neighbourhood unhealthy to live in. Gartney had another residence, much more  comfortable, situated in the midland shires, but, with his usual fantastic  nature, preferred when staying in the country to inhabit this semi-ruinous  mansion.</p>
  <p>Whoever  built it must have been fond of solitude, and much given to self-communings of  a dreary nature, for certainly no one with a healthy mind could have found  pleasure in contemplating the melancholy stretches of the marshes and in  hearkening to the sullen roar of the surges breaking on the sandy shore. Few of  the Gartney family had stayed in it since its erection, and it was reserved for  Eustace, in whom the melancholy nature of some far-off ancestor was revived, to  make it a habitable residence.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  the weirdness of the place had a fascination for his poet nature, or the dismal  fenlands pleased his distorted imagination, but at all events, Eustace was  rarely in England without paying a visit to Castle Grim, and staying there a  few days, before his departure to distant lands.</p>
  <p>Other  people not being so fond of this awesome place, Gartney could get no ordinary  servants to stay in it, and consequently it was left to the care of an aged  pair, man and wife, who did not mind where they lived so long as they had a  roof to cover them, food to eat, and a chance of earning a decent income. They  looked after the crazy old place thoroughly, and when their master paid it a  visit contrived to make him pretty comfortable considering all things. But as a  rule, they lived a Robinson Crusoe-like life, seeing no one from week&rsquo;s end to  week&rsquo;s end, save when they went into Denfield for provisions.</p>
  <p>Mr.  and Mrs. Javelrack, the guardians of this unpleasant mansion, had received a  telegram from its owner, telling them that he was coming, and consequently the  male Javelrack had driven to the Denfield Station for his master, while the  female Javelrack set the rooms in order and prepared a meal for Mr. Gartney.</p>
  <p>Eustace  had not brought his valet to Castle Grim, as that worthy would immediately have  given notice had he been asked to stay in such a nerve-shaking place. So he  drove away from the station slowly in the dog-cart with his quaint old retainer  beside him, and his portmanteau behind.</p>
  <p>It  was a very decent dog-cart taking it all round, and the horse in the shafts was  not by any means a bad specimen of his kind, as Gartney allowed the Javelracks  a decent sum yearly to keep up the place, and they made amends for their lonely  life by surrounding themselves with all the luxuries they were able. Report  said they were misers, and perhaps there was some truth in the rumour, but  whenever Eustace came down, he always found things in order, so he never  troubled his head to ascertain what proportion of the income he allowed they  had spent on the place, or what portion they stowed away in odd corners.  Indeed, if he had found that these two old servants were spending as little as  they could without being found out, and putting the rest by for a rainy day, he  would not have been particularly annoyed, for they were only within their  rights in having some pleasure in Castle Grim.</p>
  <p>Eustace  wrapped himself well up in his ulster, for the winds blew very keenly across  the marshes, and as the horse was restive, they soon left the village behind  and were moving rapidly across the straight road which stretched a narrow white  thread until it vanished on the verge of the horizon. The gables of Errington  Hall showed whitely above the sombre woods around it, but after a rapid glance  at the roof which covered the woman he loved, Gartney shook the reins  impatiently to make the horse go faster, and stared resolutely at the red glare  of the sky lowering over the wild waste landscape.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see her to-morrow,&rdquo; he thought, as the hoofs of the horse beat steadily on the  hard white road, &ldquo;and then I can see for myself how things stand between her  and Guy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some  long sombre clouds lowered heavily over the crimson of the horizon as if Night,  like some dark-winged bird, was waiting to settle down on the chill earth, and  a keen cold wind, blowing sharply from the distant ocean, brought the salt  odours of the sea to their nostrils.</p>
  <p>Javelrack,  his huge form bowed by age and rheumatism caught from the marsh mists, sat  grimly silent beside his master with his large, hairy, brown hands clasped on  his lap, and his mahogany-coloured face with its wiry black beard, so screwed  up with facing the cutting wind, that under his weather-stained brown hat he  looked like a fantastic Chinese idol. Eustace, wrapped up in his own thoughts,  paid no attention to his silent companion, but, bowing his head against the  blast, indulged in visions of Alizon Errington.</p>
  <p>A  dreary country, with the wide spreading marshes stretching on either side for  miles, and the long straight road running through the heart of the swamp.  Sluggish, slimy pools of oily stillness, fringes of stately reeds swaying to  and fro in the blast, smooth patches of green grass, pleasing to the eye but  treacherous to the unwary foot. Here and there a broken-down fence, deeply  implanted in weeds of luxuriant growth, bordering deep ditches of black earth  filled with stagnant water, on which floated green slime, rows of  depressed-looking willows, and on occasions the gaunt stump of a tree sticking  up as if to mark the site of a submerged forest.</p>
  <p>Then  suddenly against the dull red of the sky a misshapen pile of gables and chimneys  on the verge of a slight rise, girdled by a gaunt ring of leafless trees.  Beyond, heaps of wind-blown sand covered with sparse vegetation standing as a  barrier between the marshes and the ocean, which tossed in waves of blood under  the evil red sky as it moaned in a querulous voice on the starved-looking strip  of sandy beach. And this was Castle Grim.</p>
  <p>Eustace  stopped the tired horse at the door of the house (or rather the horse stopped  of its own accord), and giving the reins to Javelrack, jumped down. At the door  he was met by Mrs. Javelrack, large and gaunt as her husband, with the same  embrowned face and the same distorted features, suggestive of Chinese deities.  Indeed, as the male Javelrack took the portmanteau into the house and stood by  his wife, they looked like two ogres inhabiting Castle Grim, who were prepared  to make a meal of Eustace as soon as he was safely within the walls.</p>
  <p>The  male ogre, however, took his master&rsquo;s portmanteau into his bedroom, and then  coming out again, took the dog-cart round to the stables, while Mrs. Javelrack,  her face twisted into a hideous grin meant for a smile, brought hot water for  the weary traveller.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be long with the dinner, Mrs. Javelrack,&rdquo; called Eustace as she closed the  door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir,&rdquo; croaked Mrs. Javelrack in a hoarse voice, as if she had been a frog out  of the marsh, &ldquo;it &lsquo;ull be ready as soon as you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gartney washed himself in the warm water, which took away the smarting feeling  in his face caused by the keen salt wind, and having changed his clothes  sauntered into the one habitable room of the place, which did for dining-room,  drawing-room, and music-room, for Eustace had sent down a very good piano,  which stood in one corner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  rather spoilt by the damp,&rdquo; he said to himself; as he ran his lithe fingers  over the keys, &ldquo;or perhaps the amiable Mrs. Javelrack has been trying to  cultivate music.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  ogress brought in the dinner and waited on Eustace in a ponderous manner,  giving him all the news of the neighbourhood, which was remarkably scant, and  talked all through the meal in a subdued roar. When Eustace had finished, she  removed the dishes, brought in some coffee, and, after making up the fire,  retired to the kitchen and the company of Mr. Javelrack. Gartney heard them  chatting even through the thick walls, for the dampness of the marshes had made  them both somewhat deaf, and consequently they shouted so loudly at one  another, that it was difficult at times to tell whether it was the ocean  roaring or the ogres conversing.</p>
  <p>It  was a very comfortable room, having been furnished by Eustace according to his  own ideas, and the walls, instead of being papered, were hung with dull red  cloth after the fashion of tapestry, which waved at intervals as the searching  winds crept in shrilly through crack and cranny. A wide fireplace in which  blazed a large coal fire between the grotesque brass dogs, several comfortable  arm-chairs, and on one side, a small book-case containing a selection of  Gartney&rsquo;s favourite authors. At the distant end of the room a grand piano, with  the music piled neatly beside it, a cumbersome, old-fashioned sofa, and a deep,  square window with diamond panes, and a quaint oaken seat set in its depths.</p>
  <p>Eustace  drew an arm-chair close to the fire and near to the small table upon which Mrs.  Javelrack had placed his coffee, produced his pipe, and was soon puffing away  in a most comfortable manner. He picked up a slim volume of poems entitled &ldquo;Rose  dreamings,&rdquo; and turned over the pages listlessly as he sipped his coffee,  feeling a drowsy sensation steal over him. A verse in the poem called &ldquo;Temptation,&rdquo;  however, roused him from this lethargic state, and throwing down the book, he  paced restlessly up and down the room repeating the four lines quietly to  himself:</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;This  love so hard the winning.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever will endure,<br>
    If all the world be sinning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should we two be pure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid she won&rsquo;t take the same view as that,&rdquo; he muttered to himself  discontentedly, thinking of Lady Errington. &ldquo;And yet, if she doesn&rsquo;t love her  husband, she may have a kindly feeling for me. As to the child, surely no woman&mdash;not  even this Madonna&mdash;can devote herself exclusively to it. Still, the child is the  obstacle between herself and her husband, so perhaps it will be the obstacle  between herself and me. Oh! I could love her! I could love her if she would  only let me! She will let me! I&rsquo;m certain of it! Guy has no brains, and she is  starving for the want of intellectual food. The child is the excuse, but that  is the real reason of the coldness between them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One  of the most extraordinary parts of Gartney&rsquo;s delusion concerning his chance of  success with Lady Errington lay in the fact that his present reasoning was  diametrically opposed to the views he held when first meeting Lady Errington.  He then asserted that she would never care for her husband, but when she became  a mother would lavish all her love on the child. This view of Alizon&rsquo;s  character was a correct one, as Eustace in his innermost heart well knew, but  he wilfully deceived himself in thinking that now she had obtained her heart&rsquo;s  desire she would give it up for the sake of a man whom she had hardly seen.  Eustace, however, had been so uniformly triumphant with the female sex, that  the idea of failing with Alizon never entered his mind, and he thought that if  he laid siege to Lady Errington, in a dexterous fashion, she would give up  everything&mdash;husband, child, name, and home&mdash;in order to gratify his selfish  desire.</p>
  <p>When  he came to England after his many months&rsquo; absence in Arabia, Gartney had  determined not to see Lady Errington, feeling that he loved her, or rather her  idolized memory, so much, that he would not be able to suppress his passion,  and thus behave dishonourably towards his cousin Guy by running away with his  wife. Aunt Jelly, however, by telling him of the estrangement between the pair  had banished this honourable hesitation from his heart, as he felt himself  forced by Fate to see the woman he loved face to face. It was a very convenient  excuse with which to quiet his conscience for this wrong-doing, and having  settled in his own selfish mind that Fate was too strong for him, he determined  to estrange husband and wife still further, so that he would have less trouble  in overcoming Lady Errington&rsquo;s scruples to his dishonourable proposals.</p>
  <p>This  idea which he held had been singularly strengthened by the remark of Aunt  Jelly, when she said that Guy in his present state would be the prey of the  first clever woman that came along. Eustace therefore determined to introduce  Guy to some clever woman who would entangle him in her net, and the woman he  had fixed upon in his own mind for this vile purpose was&mdash;Mrs. Veilsturm.</p>
  <p>It  was curious that he should have fixed on this special woman to do this, seeing  that he was ignorant of Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s grudge against Lady Errington, and did  not know how eagerly she would seize this opportunity of revenging herself on  the woman who had slighted her so scathingly. He merely chose Mrs. Veilsturm  because she was beautiful, clever, and unscrupulous, so a hint to her would be  quite sufficient to induce her to fascinate Guy by all the means in her power.</p>
  <p>Eustace  Gartney was by no means a thoroughly bad man. Indeed, he had very good  qualities, although they were, to a great extent, neutralized by his  indomitable selfishness, and therefore he suffered several qualms of conscience  over the dishonourable scheme he had in hand.</p>
  <p>His  intense egotism and love of gratifying self, however, came to his aid, and he  argued himself into a satisfactory frame of mind by Heaven only knows what sophistry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t care a bit about her husband,&rdquo; he reflected, pacing the room with  measured strides, &ldquo;she never did care about him, and it&rsquo;s a pity to see a  clever woman like that tied to an unsympathetic log. With me, her life will be  much happier than with him, and after he gets a divorce I will marry her, and  we will live abroad, where there will be no narrow-minded bigots to scoff at  what they will call her false step. I&rsquo;ll do it, at whatever cost! My life will  be a blank without her, and she will be unhappy with Guy, so it will be far the  best for both of us to come together, even at the cost of a public scandal. I&rsquo;m  sorry for Guy, but the one must suffer for the many, and I daresay in after  years he will thank me for taking from him a wife from whom, even now, after  less than two years of married life, he is estranged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Eustace, sophist as he was, argued in favour of his dishonourable passion, and  would have even succeeded in persuading himself that he was a much-injured  person by having to undergo such trouble, but for a certain uneasy feeling that  he ruthlessly crushed down.</p>
  <p>Having  settled his plans to his own satisfaction, Eustace had another smoke, then  going to the window, drew aside the curtains and looked forth into the black  night.</p>
  <p>The  wind was rising and whistled shrilly round the house, lashing the dark waves  into lines of seething white foam which glimmered ghost-like through the gloom,  while overhead the thin filmy clouds raced across the sky over the face of the  haggard-looking moon. He could hear the thunder of the surge on the distant  beach, the wind muttering drearily among the trees, and casting his eyes  overhead he saw the pallid moonlight streaming in ghastly radiance through the  ragged clouds.</p>
  <p>Dropping  the curtain with a sigh, he sauntered across to the piano, and began to  improvise a weird fantasy in keeping with the feelings aroused by the wild  scene without. The roll of the sea, the wuthering of the wind, and the rustle  of the reeds were all transmuted into strange harmonies under the touch of his  skilful fingers, and stealing out at intervals from amid the tempest of sound,  stole a strange, sobbing strain, fitful and wayward as the breeze, as if some  malicious demon were piping heart-stealing love-songs to the sky, and the night,  and the lonely marsh.</p>
  <p>He  remained some time at the piano, following his changeful fancies, but when the  clock struck nine he closed the instrument, and had one final pipe before going  to bed. As he sat in front of the fire, looking into the heart of the burning  coals, he went over again in his own mind the details of the scheme by which he  hoped to secure his cousin&rsquo;s wife to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said aloud in the silence of the room, &ldquo;it is all right! There is no flaw!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a flaw, however, and one which, in his blind egotism and complacent  selfishness, he entirely overlooked, and that was the love of the mother for  her child.</p>

    From The Husband&rsquo;s Point Of View</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;A  statue cut in marble white<br>
  To me gives but a cold delight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although &lsquo;tis fair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not care,<br>
  For joy begins and ends with sight.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;A  woman pure as virgin snows,<br>
  Within whose veins the life-blood flows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose smile reveals<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love she feels,<br>
Ah, such a one is Love&rsquo;s true rose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  next morning Eustace made up his mind to go to Errington Hall in the afternoon,  and meanwhile amused himself in leisurely strolling along the beach watching  the waves rolling landward.</p>
  <p>Behind  him the sand hills rose in low mounds with their scanty vegetation, shutting  out the marshes beyond, then came the narrow strip of sandy beach on which his  footsteps left deeply imprinted marks, and before him, sombre under the leaden  coloured sky, stretched the heaving ocean, with thin lines of white-crested  waves breaking to cold foam at his feet. The sky, filled with rain-charged  clouds, lowered heavily on the chill earth, and midway flew a wide-winged  sea-gull, uttering discordant cries.</p>
  <p>It  was a dreary scene, and Eustace, with his hands clasped behind him, stared at  the dismal prospect, which was quite in keeping with his own disturbed  feelings. He was meditating a dishonourable action, and he knew it, so in spite  of his determination to carry it through to the bitter end, he felt oppressed  by a vague feeling of dread that all his villainy would be of no avail. In the  course of his selfish life he had done many foolish things, at which the world  had looked askance, but hitherto his pride had preserved him from dishonour,  but now he stood on the edge of an abyss into which he was about to plunge of  his own free will, and, in spite of his egotistical philosophy, he trembled at  the prospect before him.</p>
  <p>Supposing  he did induce Lady Errington to return his passion and leave England with him,  what benefit would it bring to him or to her? To her a ruined home, the memory  of a deserted child, the prospect of exile from all social circles, and an  endless regret for her fall; to him, delighted companionship for a time, and  then a sense of weary disgust, of futile sorrow for a past that could not be  undone, and constant discord between himself and the partner of his shame.</p>
  <p>Was  it worth the risk he was running, for a chimera, a fanciful creation of his own  brain, a desire for a vision that might never be realised? And all this time  with characteristic selfishness, not a thought for the deserted husband, for  the motherless child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hallo,  Eustace! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gartney  arose to his feet with an ejaculation, the red blood rushing to his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Guy, his cousin, the man whose wife he loved, the man whose home he  intended to destroy, and, even wrapped as he was in his triple armour of pride,  egotism, and self-complacency, he felt the sting of remorse. It was too late,  however, to think of such things, he having fully made up his mind to act; so  he crushed down the feeling which might have made him a better man, and went  forward to meet his cousin, who was walking smartly along the beach.</p>
  <p>Eighteen  months had not made much change in Errington, save that he was a little  stouter, but he looked as handsome as ever, only there was a discontented look  on his face, as if he were thoroughly dissatisfied with his life, as indeed he  was. He had evidently ridden over, as he was in a riding dress, and he advanced  towards Eustace with one hand in his pocket, the other holding his hunting crop  with which he carelessly switched his boots.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  dear old fellow, I am glad to see you again,&rdquo; he said, coming to his cousin and  holding out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very kind, Guy,&rdquo; faltered Eustace, quietly shaking hands, with the feeling  of remorse again dominant in his breast. &ldquo;I was going over to see you this  afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you?&rdquo; said Errington, listlessly. &ldquo;Oh, yes!&mdash;of course, but I heard at the  village you had come to Castle Grim, so, as I was mounted, I thought I&rsquo;d come  on here. I&rsquo;ve left my horse with that old Caliban of yours and came down to  look you up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  very glad to see you,&rdquo; returned Eustace, turning away his head. &ldquo;Shall we go  back to the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not yet,&rdquo; responded Errington, throwing himself down on the dry sand. &ldquo;Let us  talk here. I want to speak to you privately, Eustace, and this is the best  place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gartney  knew in his own mind that Errington wanted to speak about his wife, so sat down  near the recumbent form of his cousin, and waited for him to begin the  conversation.</p>
  <p>Nothing  was said, however, until, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, Guy looked up at Gartney&rsquo;s  face with a frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Lord, man, have you left your tongue behind in Arabia?&rdquo; he said roughly,  leaning his cheek on his hand.</p>
  <p>Eustace  laughed a little bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it would have been as well if I had done so,&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;it might  save my soul the burden of many lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  whimsical as ever!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think so? No doubt! Solitude is rather apt to confirm a man in his  eccentric habits. By-the-way, you have not told me how your wife is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  well,&rdquo; replied Errington shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the son and heir, on whose birth I must congratulate you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  spoke this last sentence in such a bitter tone that Eustace could not help  turning round and looking at him. He was gazing moodily at the sand, but  glanced upward, as he felt rather than saw that Gartney had turned round, and  smiled ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem surprised?&rdquo; he said at length.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am surprised,&rdquo; answered Eustace deliberately. &ldquo;When I saw you in Italy, you  spoke very differently&mdash;very differently indeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but you see that was in my character of a newly-married man,&rdquo; sneered Guy,  picking up a handful of sand and letting it stream through his fingers. &ldquo;All  that sort of thing is over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why is it over?&rdquo; asked Eustace, coldly. &ldquo;Eighteen months can scarcely make so  much difference&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  makes every difference&mdash;in my case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  sat up suddenly, clasped his hands round his knees, and staring at the ocean,  answered in a dreary voice utterly devoid of any feeling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay it will sound ridiculous to a man like yourself, Eustace, and no doubt  you and the world will laugh at me when you know my reason. But I cannot help  it. I&rsquo;ve fought against the feeling, as much as ever I could. I&rsquo;ve made all  sorts of excuses for my wife, but it&rsquo;s all of no use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  quite in the dark as to what you are talking about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  talking about my wife,&rdquo; said Guy deliberately. &ldquo;You know how much in love I was  with her when we married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  are you not in love with her now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what have you to complain of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Complain  of!&rdquo; echoed Errington with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;I have nothing to complain of,  according to the views of the world. Alizon is a perfect wife, a perfect  mother, a perfect woman in every way. In fact, that is what I do complain of!  She&rsquo;s too perfect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Heavens, man!&rdquo; cried Eustace, now thoroughly exasperated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand a  word you are saying. If Alizon is perfect, both as wife and mother, what more  do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want love,&rdquo; returned Guy, in a low, deep voice, the blood rushing to his face. &ldquo;I  want love and affection. I&rsquo;m starving for one kind word and I cannot obtain it.  It sounds ridiculous, does it not, for a man of my years to whimper about love  like a silly schoolboy? But I cannot help it. I married Alizon in order to have  a true and loving wife, and I find I am tied to a statue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I cannot understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Errington vehemently, leaping to his feet, &ldquo;how could  you? a cold-blooded man, who can do without love and affection, who doesn&rsquo;t  care two straws about any human being, and only adores the phantom creations of  his own brain. Great Heaven!&rdquo; said the unfortunate young man, staring wildly up  at the leaden-coloured sky, &ldquo;if I were only a man like that how happy I should  be. But I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m only a fellow who wants to be loved by his wife, but even  that is denied me. I married Alizon for love. I loved her then, I love her now,  and she cares no more for me than she does for yonder ocean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  surely the child is a bond of union between you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child!&rdquo; repeated Errington fiercely, &ldquo;no! the child, which should have drawn us  closer together, has put us farther asunder than ever. I longed for a child to  succeed me in the estates, and, now I have obtained my desire, I wish it had  never been born. I hate the child! It seems horrible, Eustace, but I do. I hate  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk like that, Guy,&rdquo; cried Eustace, springing to his feet, and laying his hand  on his cousin&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s terrible&mdash;your own child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own child! my own child,&rdquo; repeated Guy with senseless reiteration. &ldquo;Yes! my own  child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  thrust his hands into his pockets, and abruptly turning away, walked a short  distance in order to conceal his emotion, while Eustace stood silently in the  same place, wondering at his cousin&rsquo;s grief over what appeared to him to be  such a trivial matter. It might seem so to him, but it certainly was not to  Guy, whose whole nature was smarting under a sense of neglect and injury.</p>
  <p>After  a few moments Errington returned, with a hard look on his face, and a cynical  laugh on his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon, Eustace,&rdquo; he said ceremoniously, &ldquo;for troubling you about  these affairs, but if I hadn&rsquo;t someone to talk to about it, I believe I should  go mad. I went up to Aunt Jelly the other day, and told her what I am now  telling you, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to think much of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make a mistake there,&rdquo; said Gartney, quickly. &ldquo;Aunt Jelly thought a great deal  about it. In fact, it is because she urged me to see what I could do, that I am  down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; replied Errington listlessly, &ldquo;no one can do anything.  Alizon and myself are an ill-wedded pair. The quick coupled with the dead. She  is a perfect wife, a perfect mother, and I, in the eyes of the world possessing  a treasure in the matrimonial way, am the most miserable devil alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  felt a sudden pang of compunction at the idea of the misery he proposed to add  to the unhappy young man&rsquo;s life, and after a short struggle between the  generous and selfish instincts of his nature, the former triumphed, and he  determined to do his best to reconcile husband and wife. With this new resolve  in his mind, he approached Guy, and taking him by the arm, walked slowly across  the beach with him towards Castle Grim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  to the house, old fellow,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;You are working yourself into a  perfect state over nothing. Have luncheon with me, and then we&rsquo;ll drive over  together, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to put things right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo;  said Guy, gloomily, &ldquo;quite impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  easy enough explained! When I married my wife, I thought her coldness would  wear off, but it did not. To all my love and tenderness, she was as cold as  ice. Kind enough in a cold-blooded sort of way, but as far as any answering  tenderness or feeling of sympathy, she might as well have been a statue. That  was hard enough to bear, as you may imagine, but when the child was born it was  much worse. She isn&rsquo;t a statue now, by any means, but her whole soul is wrapped  up in the child. She&rsquo;s never away from him, she never stops talking about him,  she lives in the nursery, and never comes near me. If I offer to caress her,  she frowns and resents any display of affection. All her love, all her heart,  is given to the child, and I&rsquo;ve got to be content with cold looks, and about  five minutes&rsquo; conversation a day. I hardly ever see her, sometimes she doesn&rsquo;t  even come to meals, and when I remonstrated with her, she turned on me in a  cold fury, and asked me if I wanted her to neglect the child. What am I to do,  Eustace? I can&rsquo;t force her to love me against her will. I can&rsquo;t keep her from  the child. There seems nothing for me to do, but to be satisfied with the life  I am leading now, and it&rsquo;s Hell, Eustace, Hell. It&rsquo;s a big word to describe a  little thing, isn&rsquo;t it? The world would laugh at me if they heard me talk, but  no one can understand it, unless they undergo it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke with great emotion, and although Eustace failed in a great measure to  understand his deep feelings on the subject, he could not but see that his  cousin had great cause to speak. A young man of ardent nature, to whom love is  a necessity, finding himself tied to a woman who chilled every demonstration of  affection, and lavished all her adoration on the child of which he was the  father&mdash;it was truly a pitiable situation, and yet one at which the world would  laugh, because the tragic elements therein were so simple.</p>
  <p>Gartney  listened in silence to the long speech, and saying nothing in reply, made his  cousin have some luncheon, while he thought over the whole affair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t speak to Mrs. Veilsturm,&rdquo; he thought to himself, pouring out Guy a glass  of wine, &ldquo;if I can I&rsquo;ll bring them together again and then leave England for  ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>During  the luncheon, he talked gaily enough to Errington, cheering him up by every  means in his power, making up his mind in the meantime as to what was the best  course to pursue.</p>
  <p>When  the meal was finished, he ordered Javelrack to bring round a horse, and, with  Sir Guy, was soon trotting along the road on the way to Errington Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  listen to me, Guy,&rdquo; he said, when they were some distance on their journey. &ldquo;I  think you exaggerate a good deal of this thing. It&rsquo;s not half so bad as you  make out. Alizon is a young mother, and you know they always adore their  first-born to the exclusion of everything else. I don&rsquo;t think she is naturally  of a cold nature, and when her first outburst of joy on the child is exhausted,  she will, doubtless, give you that love which is your due, and which you so  much need. But, in the meantime, it is foolish of you to remain at the Hall, as  you will only work yourself up into a frenzy over nothing. Solitude is the  worst thing in the world for a man in your condition, so the best thing you can  do is to come up to town with me for a week or so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I cannot leave Alizon alone,&rdquo; objected Errington in perplexity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? She won&rsquo;t be lonely, as she has the child, and besides, if she neglects  you as you say, it is because you are always near her. A few weeks&rsquo; absence  would make a wonderful change in her demeanour, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you really think so?&rdquo; asked poor Guy, his face lighting up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  certain of it. In spite of your years, my dear boy, I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t know  much about feminine nature. Learn then, that to make a woman value a thing  truly, it is necessary to put it out of her reach. Immediately it is in that  position, then she&rsquo;ll strain every nerve to get it back again. Therefore, if  you leave your wife, and neglect her for a time, she will begin to grow  jealous, and see how wrongly she has treated you. When you come back again, she  will alter her conduct, and things will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe in that prescription,&rdquo; retorted Guy, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you? It does sound rather difficult of belief, but it&rsquo;s true for all that. And I  can tell you of a case in question, that of Victoria Sheldon and Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  then I&rsquo;ll explain. If you will carry your memory back to the time we were in  Italy, you will remember that Otterburn was very much in love with Victoria  Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  tell you the truth, I&rsquo;ve almost forgotten Otterburn himself. Was he not your  companion then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&mdash;we  parted at Venice, and I saw him again for the first time last week. Well,  Otterburn was so much in love with Victoria that he proposed. She refused him,  so Otterburn, having a spirit of his own, departed, and has never seen her  since. Finding, therefore, that he stood on his dignity, she fell in love with  him, and I feel certain, that if Otterburn chooses to ask her again, she will  say yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  will he choose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will! They love one another devotedly, and each is ignorant of the other&rsquo;s  feelings, but when they meet everything will be arranged satisfactorily. So you  see, my dear Guy, the value of absence, for if Otterburn hadn&rsquo;t gone away, he  certainly would not have won the heart of Victoria Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you advise me to do the same?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, decidedly! Leave your wife for a few weeks, and if she has any love for you&mdash;which  she must have, or else she would not have married you&mdash;she will miss you hourly,  and when you come back&mdash;well the game will be in your own hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  did not reply for a few minutes, but urged his horse into a canter, and the two  rode along for some distance in silence. When nearing Denfield, however,  Errington suddenly drew his horse up, and turned his head towards Eustace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will take your advice,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;it can do no harm, and it may do  good.&rdquo;</p>

    From The Wife&rsquo;s Point Of View</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;What  is the purest love on earth?<br>
  A maiden&rsquo;s love for summer mirth?<br>
  A lover&rsquo;s worship of his idol<br>
    When bells ring out his happy bridal?<br>
    A patriot&rsquo;s when on foreign strand<br>
    He suffers for his native land?<br>
    A poet&rsquo;s or musician&rsquo;s love<br>
    For thoughts inspired from above?<br>
    Ah, no, the love most undefiled<br>
  Is that the mother gives the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington was as usual in the nursery, sitting in a low chair near the window,  watching &ldquo;Sammy&rdquo; playing on the floor. &ldquo;Sammy,&rdquo; otherwise Henry Gerald Guy  Errington, was now a year old, and looked what he was, a remarkably fine child,  of which any mother might be proud. &ldquo;Proud,&rdquo; however, is too weak a word to use  in connection with Alizon&rsquo;s love for her child, seeing that this small scrap of  humanity rolling about at her feet was worshipped by her with an affection  absolutely idolatrous. All her ideas, her thoughts, her affections, were bound  up in Sammy, and had it been a question of death for mother or child, there is  no doubt that Alizon would have cheerfully yielded up her own life to save that  of her baby.</p>
  <p>Nor  was Sammy undeserving of worship, for he was really a beautiful boy, with the  frank expression of his father&rsquo;s handsome face, and a healthy, sturdy little  frame, which seemed to defy disease. During his twelve months of existence he  had been very healthy, and even in the delicate matter of cutting his teeth had  been more successful than the generality of infants. With his rosy little face,  his big, blue eyes and soft yellow curls of hair, he looked as an obsequious  nurse expressed it, &ldquo;a perfect picter.&rdquo; That worthy lady, Mrs. Tasker by name,  and fat, plethoric and red-faced by nature, was at the end of the nursery  attending to some articles of the young gentleman&rsquo;s toilet, and Alizon had her  child all to herself, for which privilege she was profoundly grateful, as Mrs.  Tasker was a terrible autocrat.</p>
  <p>A  wonderful change had come over her since she had become a mother, for the  statue had become a woman, the iceberg had melted, and in all her life she  never looked so womanly as she did at this moment. Her face, flushed a delicate  rose-colour, was sparkling with animation, her lips were parted in a merry  laugh, and her eyes, soft and tender, absolutely seemed to devour the child as  she bent forward to play with him.</p>
  <p>Sammy  was sitting like an infant Marius among the ruins of a Carthage of toys, for  around him on all sides lay the evidences of his destructive capabilities. A  woolly quadruped, something between a dog and a cow, dignified with the name of  &ldquo;Ba-lamb,&rdquo; lay on its back, piteously extending one mangled leg, the other  three having been bitten off, and an indecent india-rubber doll, with no  clothes and a squeak, was being dragged about by a string. There were several  other things, such as a drum (broken), a toy soldier (head missing), a wooden  Noah (paint sucked off), and last, but not least, a hunting crop of his father&rsquo;s,  which was Sammy&rsquo;s special delight, because it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be proper for  him to have it.</p>
  <p>Sammy  at present was hammering &ldquo;Eliza&rdquo; (the doll aforesaid) with the whip, when  suddenly discovering that one shoe had come off in his exertions, he rendered  things equal by pulling off the other shoe, and then chuckled with delight at  his success.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naughty  Sammy,&rdquo; reproved his mother, bending down to pick up the shoes. &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t do  that&mdash;ah, bad child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  bad child, attracted by the fact that both shoes were out of his reach, made a  snatch at them, with the result that he over-balanced himself, and came down  heavily on his head. He was undecided whether to howl or not, when his mother  settled the question by picking him up with a cry of pity, whereat, knowing the  right thing to do, he howled vigorously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s  own precious! mother&rsquo;s own darling!&rdquo; lamented Alizon, rocking him to and fro on  her breast; upon which Sammy, finding the rocking pleasant, roared louder than  ever, whereupon Mrs. Tasker hurried forward to give her opinion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  whatever&rsquo;s the matter, my lady?&rdquo; she asked anxiously. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t swallowed  anything has he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was Mrs. Tasker&rsquo;s constant nightmare, for Sammy had an ostrich-like capacity  for swallowing anything that came handy, and disposed of all sorts of things in  this manner, to the great detriment of his stomach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  hurt his head, Nurse,&rdquo; explained Lady Errington, anxiously, while Sammy,  satisfied at being the centre of attraction, stopped roaring. &ldquo;His poor head.  He fell over on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  allay&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Nurse in despair. &ldquo;I nivir did see sich a topply  child. Feathers is lead to his upsettings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  comparison was not a particularly happy one, but it served Mrs. Tasker, who  thereupon wanted to take Sammy from his mother, a proceeding to which Lady  Errington strongly objected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  don&rsquo;t Nurse please! let me hold him a little time! See he&rsquo;s quite good now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  indeed, Sammy was now behaving like an angel, for being attracted by a small gold  brooch his mother wore, he was standing up on his sturdy legs, plucking at it  with chubby fingers, and gurgling to himself in a most satisfied manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  nivir did see such a dear child,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Tasker admiringly. &ldquo; &lsquo;Is &lsquo;owls  is hoff as soon as on. Why the last as I nussed, my lady, were that givin&rsquo; to  hollerin&rsquo; as you might &lsquo;ave thought I&rsquo;d put &lsquo;im to bed with a pin-cushing. But  as for Master Sammy, well&mdash;&rdquo; and casting up her little eyes to the ceiling, Mrs.  Tasker expressed in pantomime, with a pair of dumpy red hands, that words  failed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  an angel! an angel!&rdquo; murmured Alizon fondly, covering the rosy little face with  kisses. &ldquo;Oh, nurse, isn&rsquo;t he perfect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nurse  expressed her firm conviction that there never was nor never would be such a perfectly  angelic child, and then the two women indulged in a lavish display of  grovelling affection, with many inarticulated words, tender fondlings and  indistinct kisses, all of which Sammy accepted with the greatest calmness as  his just due.</p>
  <p>At  this moment a servant entered the nursery to inform Lady Errington that Sir Guy  and Mr. Eustace Gartney were waiting for her in the Dutch room, at which Alizon  was in despair, for it was now the time when Sammy took his airing, and  therefore one of the most interesting events of the day. However, much as she  disliked leaving the child, she could hardly refuse to see Eustace without  appearing pointedly rude, so sent the servant away with the information that  she would be down immediately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t be longer than I can help, Nurse,&rdquo; she said dolefully, delivering Sammy  into the extended arms of Mrs. Tasker. &ldquo;Be sure you take the greatest care in  dressing him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  my lady,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tasker, with scathing irony, &ldquo;I &lsquo;opes as I&rsquo;ve dressed a  child afore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Yes! of course,&rdquo; replied Lady Errington hastily, for she had a wholesome fear  of the autocrat&rsquo;s temper, &ldquo;but you know how anxious I am! and his bottle,  Nurse! take care it&rsquo;s warm, and Nurse! please don&rsquo;t go out until I send up a  message.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  it be long?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Tasker determinedly, &ldquo;because there ain&rsquo;t much sun,  and this blessed child must git as much as he can. It makes &lsquo;im grow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  only a few minutes,&rdquo; said Alizon quickly. &ldquo;You see, Nurse, I&rsquo;ll want to show  him to Mr. Gartney. Take the greatest care&mdash;the very greatest care&mdash;goodbye,  mother&rsquo;s angel&mdash;kiss mother, dearest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sammy  opened his button of a mouth and bestowed a damp caress on his mother, which  was his idea of kissing, and then Lady Errington, yielding to stern necessity,  withdrew slowly, with her eyes fixed on the child to the last, and even when  she closed the nursery door, she strained her ears to hear him crowing.</p>
  <p>Both  gentlemen were waiting in the Dutch room, which received its name from the fact  that it looked out on to the prim garden, with the rows of box-wood, the beds  of gaudy tulips and the fantastically clipped yew trees. Guy was in a much more  cheerful mood than usual, as he thought that the panacea prescribed by Eustace  would make an end of all his troubles, and Gartney himself experienced a  wonderful feeling of exhilaration at the near prospect of seeing his visionary  lady of Como once more.</p>
  <p>The  soft sweep of a robe, the turning of the handle of the door, and in another  moment she stood before him, a fair, gracious woman, who advanced slowly with  outstretched hand and a kindly smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do, Mr. Gartney, after all this time?&rdquo; she said sweetly, clasping his  extended hand. &ldquo;I thought we were never going to see you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  this the pale, cold Undine he had last seen at Como, more ethereal than the  visioned spirits of romance? Was this the perfect, bloodless statue of whom Guy  complained? This lovely breathing woman, aflush with all the tender grace of  motherhood, with delicately pink cheeks, eyes brilliant with animation, and a  voice rich and mellow as the sound of a silver bell. Yes! his prophecy had come  true; the haunting, hungry look had departed from her eyes, for in the full  satisfaction of the strong maternal instinct the thin, unsubstantial ghost of  maidenhood had disappeared; and in this beautiful woman, aglow with exuberant  vitality, he recognized the reality of the visionary creation of his dreaming  brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you think I was lost in Arabian solitudes?&rdquo; he said, recovering from his  momentary fit of abstraction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not the sort of man to be lost. I  always come back again, like a modern Prodigal Son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alizon  laughed when he spoke thus, but months afterwards she recollected those  careless words. At present, however, she sat down near him, and began to talk,  while Guy, who had uttered no word since she entered the room, stood silently  at the window, staring out at the quaint Dutch garden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I suppose you are going to stay at home, and tell your tales from your own  chimney corner?&rdquo; said Lady Errington, clasping her hands loosely on her knees.</p>
  <p>Eustace  shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so the other day, but now&mdash;I&rsquo;m going on an exploring expedition up the  Nile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have the blood of the Wandering Jew in your veins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  Cain!&mdash;he was rather fond of travelling, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be profane, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; said Alizon, trying to look serious. &ldquo;But really you  ought to settle down and marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; observed Guy caustically, turning round. &ldquo;Go in for the delights  of the family circle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  all depends whether he would appreciate them or not,&rdquo; replied Lady Errington  coldly, flashing an indignant look at her husband, upon which Eustace to avoid  unpleasantness made a hasty observation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way, talking of the family circle, I have to congratulate you, Lady  Errington, on the birth of a son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alizon&rsquo;s  eyes, which had hardened while looking at Guy, grew wondrous soft and tender.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&mdash;he  is the dearest child in the world&mdash;everyone loves him except his father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense Alizon!&rdquo; said Guy, hastily turning towards his wife. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of  him indeed, but one gets tired of babies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay, but not of their own children,&rdquo; answered Lady Errington indignantly. &ldquo;You  must see him, Mr. Gartney, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll say you never saw such a lovely  child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  arose from her seat and left the room quickly, while Eustace looked  reproachfully at Guy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shouldn&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you find things  disagreeable if you sneer at the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t sneer at the child,&rdquo; retorted Guy sullenly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m tired of hearing  nothing but baby chatter all day long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  if you were as attentive to the baby as your wife, it would be advisable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  I can&rsquo;t be on my knees before a cradle all day, and besides Alizon won&rsquo;t let me  come near it. One would think I was going to murder the child the way she looks  at me when I lay a finger on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gartney,&rdquo; said Lady Errington&rsquo;s voice at the door. &ldquo;Come upstairs with me to  the nursery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  I come to Paradise also?&rdquo; observed Guy wistfully as his cousin was leaving the  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  come if you care to,&rdquo; replied Alizon coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you,&rdquo; replied Errington abruptly, his brow growing black with rage at the  coldness of the invitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  stay here till you return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington went upstairs slowly with Eustace, with a look of anger on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; she said bitterly, pausing at the nursery door, &ldquo;he does not care a bit  about his child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think he does,&rdquo; answered Eustace discreetly, &ldquo;but he thought you did not want  him to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am always glad for him to come,&rdquo; remarked Alizon coldly, &ldquo;but when he does he  only makes disagreeable remarks about the boy, so his visits are never very  pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Things  were decidedly wrong between this young couple, and they so thoroughly  misunderstood one another that Eustace was at a loss how to set them right. He  was saved the trouble of further thought, however, by Lady Errington opening  the door and preceding him into the nursery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  he is, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; said the young mother, &ldquo;look at my precious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  precious,&rdquo; in all the glory of white hat, white cape and woolly gloves and  shoes, was seated in his perambulator ready to go out for his airing, and Mrs.  Tasker, with the under-nurse, were both attached to the wheels of his chariot.  At the sight of Gartney&rsquo;s bronzed face, he set up a howl, and was only pacified  by being taken out of his carriage into the protecting arms of his mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  complete Madonna now,&rdquo; thought Eustace, as he looked at the flushed face of the  young mother bending over the rosy one of the child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he cry then! sweetest! What do you think of him, Mr. Gartney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  can be but one opinion,&rdquo; replied that gentleman solemnly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a very  beautiful child, and you may well be proud of him, Lady Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you ever see a finer child?&rdquo; demanded Alizon, insatiable for praise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  never,&rdquo; answered Eustace, which was true enough, as he hated babies and never  looked at them unless forced to. &ldquo;Hi, baby, chuck! chuck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goo!  goo! goo!&rdquo; gurgled Master Errington, and stretched out his chubby arms to  Gartney, intimating thereby a desire to improve his acquaintance with that  gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s quite taken to you,&rdquo; said Lady Errington gaily. &ldquo;Just feel what a weight  he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Eustace was forced to take the child in his arms, and looked as awkward as a  man usually does when burdened with a baby. Ultimately Sammy was returned to  his mother&rsquo;s arms, and she took him down the stairs, while the footman and Mrs.  Tasker between them carried down the light wickerwork perambulator.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wheel  him up and down the terrace for a time, Nurse,&rdquo; said Alizon, when the child was  once more replaced in his little carriage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be out soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were standing at the door, and Lady Errington waited there until Mrs. Tasker  vanished with the baby round the corner on to the wide terrace, when she turned  to Eustace with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  that mean that you are anxious to get to the baby?&rdquo; asked Eustace, raising his  eyebrows, as they walked back to the Dutch room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no, really,&rdquo; replied Lady Errington, with polite mendacity, &ldquo;do you think I am  never happy away from Sammy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you?&rdquo; he asked, eyeing her keenly.</p>
  <p>Alizon  flushed a bright crimson, laughed in an uneasy manner and fidgeted nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a shame to push me into a corner!&rdquo; she said at length, raising her clear eyes  to his face. &ldquo;No!&mdash;I am never happy away from my child. I am so afraid of any  accident happening! Dear me, what has become of Guy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  had entered the Dutch room by this time and found it empty, but on the table  afternoon tea was laid out, so Alizon sat down to pour out Eustace a cup.  Gartney looked at her furtively as she did this, and thought he had never seen  her look so charming.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky  Guy,&rdquo; he said at length, taking the cup she handed to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of Sammy?&rdquo; she asked, looking at him with a bright smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  because of you!&rdquo; replied Eustace boldly, whereat she shook her blonde head  gaily, though her lips wore a somewhat scornful look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid Guy doesn&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  judged this a good opening from which to lead up to his attempt at  reconciliation, so spoke out at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Errington, don&rsquo;t you think you are rather hard upon Guy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned her face towards him sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you ask that?&rdquo; she demanded coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid it is a liberty,&rdquo; answered Eustace slowly, &ldquo;but you see I am Guy&rsquo;s  cousin, so the near relationship must excuse my apparent rudeness. But the fact  is you don&rsquo;t seem perfectly happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am happy, perfectly happy I have everything in the world I desire&mdash;health,  wealth and my darling child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see you don&rsquo;t count your husband among your blessings,&rdquo; said Eustace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes! I&rsquo;m very fond of Guy. He is the father of my child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that the only reason you are fond of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really,  Mr. Gartney, I do not see by what right you speak like this to me,&rdquo; she said  with great hauteur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Eustace, with cold politeness. &ldquo;I was wrong to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington began to twist her marriage ring round and round, as if she wanted to  pull it off, and a frown passed across her mobile face. Eustace, versed in the  ways of her sex, knew that those signs betokened further remarks on her part,  so he wisely said nothing, but waited for the outburst, which came exactly as  he expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very fond of Guy,&rdquo; she asserted defiantly. &ldquo;I would not have married him if  I had not been fond of him. What makes you think I&rsquo;m not? I suppose Aunt Jelly  has been saying something?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Lady Errington,&rdquo; responded Gartney replacing, his cup on the table, &ldquo;I had  no right to speak as I did. I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  answer my question, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; she said angrily, a red spot of colour  burning on either cheek. &ldquo;Has Aunt Jelly been saying anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gartney  was not the man to remain in any difficulty where a lie could help him out of  it, so he replied to her question with the greatest deliberation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt  Jelly has been saying nothing. The only reason that makes me speak is that you  seem to me to be fonder of the baby than of your own husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  murder was out, and he was prepared for a storm, but it did not come, as Alizon  had quite as much self-control as himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  and what is wrong in that?&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;I do love my child more than my  husband, any mother would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that rather hard on the husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I do not see it! Of course, I love Guy very much&mdash;much more than he loves his  child,&rdquo; she finished with a burst of passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think Guy is very fond of the child,&rdquo; said Eustace quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not,&rdquo; she replied angrily, rising to her feet; &ldquo;he grudges every hour I  spend with the boy. He would have me neglect the child in order to be always  with him. But there, what is the use of talking?&mdash;neither you nor Guy can  understand the feelings of a mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  remark closed the discussion so far as Eustace was concerned, for he deemed it  useless to argue with a woman who was so blind to everything except her  maternal feelings, so he hastened to turn the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right there, Lady Errington,&rdquo; he said good-humouredly, &ldquo;I am a bachelor, so  know absolutely nothing about these things. But Guy looks a little knocked up,  so I want to take him to town with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  certainly,&rdquo; replied Alizon indifferently. &ldquo;A run up to town will do him good. I  want Guy to enjoy himself in every way. But now, Mr. Gartney, excuse me for a  time, as I must go and see how the baby is getting on. Will you stay to dinner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you,&rdquo; said Eustace, rising and holding out his hand. &ldquo;I have some letters  to write this evening, but I will come over to-morrow and see you before I go  back to town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; answered Lady Errington, smiling as she pressed his hand. &ldquo;Goodbye at  present. Come to-morrow, and I will show you the baby again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  went to the door, when it suddenly opened, and Guy entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  here you are, Guy,&rdquo; she said sweetly, as he stood holding the door open for her  to pass through, &ldquo;I was just going to send for you. Mr. Gartney is going away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where are you going?&rdquo; asked Guy, with a half-smile on his stern face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you ask?&rdquo; she said archly. &ldquo;To the baby, of course.&rdquo; And with a laugh she  vanished through the doorway, while Guy, with a scowl, pushed the door roughly  to, and strode across the room to Eustace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  he demanded curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  answered Eustace coolly, &ldquo;I did what I could&mdash;but of course, my dear fellow, it&rsquo;s  a very delicate matter, and really I had no right to interfere in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did she say?&rdquo; demanded Guy roughly, turning as white as a sheet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  said you had better go to Town with me,&rdquo; answered Gartney reluctantly.</p>
  <p>Guy  burst out with a harsh laugh, and turned towards the window with a gesture of  despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  God! and I&rsquo;m breaking my heart for that statue.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
    Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s &ldquo;At Home&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I  hate &lsquo;At Homes,&rsquo; they&rsquo;re simply Inquisitions<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To torture human beings into fits;<br>
    A mixture of plebeians and patricians,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whom in judgment Mrs. Grundy sits;<br>
    Sonatas played by second-rate musicians,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And milk-and-water jokes by would-be wits;<br>
    Such squallings, scandals, crush of men and ladies&mdash;<br>
    It&rsquo;s like a family party down in Hades.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  this was the first victory he had ever obtained over his egotistical nature,  Eustace felt most unjustifiably proud, and viewed his actions with great  self-complacency, therefore the good results of such victory merely became  egotism in another form. His attitude towards Lady Errington had certainly  altered, but not for the better, as the fantastic adoration he had formerly  felt towards a vision of his own creation had changed to an earthly love for  the real woman, in which there was mingled more of sensuality than platonism.  Eustace was certainly not a coarse man in any sense of the word, but he had  regarded the visionary Lady Errington so long as his own special property,  withheld from him by the accident of her marriage with Guy, that when he saw  the flesh-and-blood woman <i>riant</i> in all her newly-found vitality, he  viewed her as a Sultan might view a fresh odalisque added to his <i>serail</i>.  The pale lily had changed into the rich red rose, and the spiritual being of  his fevered imagination had taken the form of a beautiful woman, full of temptation  to an ardent lover.</p>
  <p>Any  sensible man would have seen from the short conversation he had had with Lady  Errington that love for the child filled her heart to the exclusion of all  else, but Eustace, with supreme egotism, deemed that she loved the child simply  because her husband was not worthy of her affection and when he deigned to  worship her she would certainly forget the pale passion of maternal love under  the fierce ardour of his devotion.</p>
  <p>With  this idea in his mind it was no wonder he felt that he was exercising great  self-denial in trying to bring husband and wife together, and in renouncing his  desire to gain possession of a woman for whom he felt an unreasoning  admiration. However, being determined to carry out this new mood of asceticism to  the end, he took Guy up to Town with him, and tried to amuse that moody young  man to the best of his power, which was a somewhat unsatisfactory task.</p>
  <p>Seeing  that he had abandoned his scheme to gain Alizon&rsquo;s love, he did not intend to  speak to Mrs. Veilsturm, as he had now no desire to entangle Guy with another  woman, but as he was going to an &ldquo;At Home&rdquo; given by Cleopatra, he did not  hesitate to take his cousin with him in the ordinary course of things.</p>
  <p>Eustace  knew more about Mrs. Veilsturm than she cared he should know, as he had met her  at Lima, in South America, when she was&mdash;well, not Mrs. Veilsturm&mdash;and he judged  a woman of her harpy-like nature would not strive to annex anyone but a rich  man. Guy was not rich, so Eustace thought she would leave him alone&mdash;a most  fatal mistake, as he had unconsciously placed Cleopatra&rsquo;s revenge within her  grasp. Mrs. Veilsturm had neither forgiven nor forgotten the deadly insult  offered to her by Lady Errington, but hitherto, owing to Guy&rsquo;s devotion to his  wife, had been unable to entangle him in any way. Now, however, Fate was  playing into her hands, and when she received a note from Eustace, asking if he  might bring his cousin to the house in Park Lane she felt a savage delight at  such a stroke of unforeseen luck, but, being too clever a woman to compromise  her scheme in any way, wrote a cold reply to Mr. Gartney, telling him he could  bring Sir Guy Errington&mdash;if he liked.</p>
  <p>Of  course Eustace did like, and as Guy, who had quite forgotten all about the  episode between Mrs. Veilsturm and his wife, listlessly acquiesced, they both  arrived at Cleopatra&rsquo;s &ldquo;At Home&rdquo; somewhere about five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  seem to remember the name,&rdquo; said Guy, as they struggled up the crowded stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  certainly ought to,&rdquo; responded Eustace, &ldquo;seeing that she is about the  best-known person in Town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but you see I&rsquo;m a country cousin now,&rdquo; said Guy with a faint smile. &ldquo;Hang it!  what a crush there is here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the art of giving an &lsquo;At Home,&rsquo; &rdquo; answered Eustace drily, &ldquo;you put fifty people  who hate one another in a room built to hold twenty, and when they&rsquo;re  thoroughly uncomfortable you give them bad music, weak tea, and thin  bread-and-butter. After an hour of these delights they go away in a rollicking  humour to another Sardine Party. Oh, it&rsquo;s most amusing, I assure you, and&mdash;well,  here we are, and here is Mrs. Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cleopatra  had certainly not lost any of her charms, and looked as imperious and majestic  as ever, standing in the centre of her guests, arrayed in a startling costume  of black and yellow, which gave her a strange, barbaric appearance. There was  no doubt that she wore too many diamonds, but this was due to her African love  for ornaments, and with every movement of her body the gems flashed out  sparkles of light in the mellow twilight of the room.</p>
  <p>A  foreign musician, with long hair and pale face, was playing some weird Eastern  dance on the piano as Eustace entered and bowed before her, and it suddenly  flashed across his mind that this sensuously beautiful woman was quite out of  place amid these cold English blondes and undecided brunettes. She ought to be  tossing her slender arms in a tropical forest, to the shrill music of pipes and  muffled throbbing of serpent-skin drums, whirling in the mystic gyrations of  some sacred dance before the shrine of a veiled goddess. The sickly odour of  pastilles, which she was fond of burning in her drawing-room, assisted this  fancy, and he was only roused from this strange vision by the mellow voice of  his hostess bidding him welcome, as she touched his hand with her slender  fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to see you, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; she said, with a slow smile; &ldquo;it is indeed  kind of you to call so soon after your return. And your friend, whom you were  to bring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  here,&rdquo; replied Eustace, presenting his cousin, &ldquo;Sir Guy Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  bowed, feeling somewhat bewildered at her rich loveliness, and, with a swift  glance from under her heavy eye-lashes, she shook hands with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gartney&rsquo;s friends are mine also&mdash;but you are welcome on your own account, Sir  Guy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very kind,&rdquo; answered Errington mechanically, &ldquo;I think the obligation is on  my side, however.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a fool,&rdquo; decided Mrs. Veilsturm in her own mind, as she looked at his fresh,  simple face; &ldquo;I can twist him round my finger, and I will, if it&rsquo;s only to spite  his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment Eustace was seized upon by Mr. Dolser, who was on the look-out for  copy, and, much against his will, was dragged to the other end of the room by  the pertinacious little man, leaving his cousin in conversation with Mrs.  Veilsturm.</p>
  <p>The  room was quite full of all sorts and conditions of men and women. Cleopatra  knew everybody in the literary, artistic, and musical world, and they all came  to her receptions, so that it was quite a treat to find somebody there who had  done nothing. This happened on occasions when someone who had not done anything  was brought to worship someone who had. There were plenty of lady novelists in  all shades, from blonde to brunette, picking up ideas for their next  three-volume publication; pale young poets, with long hair and undecided legs,  who wrote rondels, triolets, and ballads, hinting, in wonderful rhyme, at  things fantastical; dramatists, young and old, full of three-act plays and  hatred of managers and critics. A haggard young man of the impressionist school  drooped in a corner, discoursing of Art, in the newest jargon of the studios,  to the last fashionable manageress, who did not understand a word he was  saying, but pretended to do so, as she wanted him to paint her picture.  Everyone present had an eye to business, and each was pursuing his or her aim  with vicious pertinacity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mixed  lot, ain&rsquo;t they?&mdash;yes!&rdquo; said Mr. Dolser superciliously, when he had got the  unhappy Eustace pinned up in a corner; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t they cackle about themselves too&mdash;rather.  See that stout old party in the corner, in the damaged millinery&mdash;new novelist,  you know&mdash;disease school&mdash;Baudelaire without his genius&mdash;wrote &lsquo;The Body Snatcher&rsquo;  &mdash;yes!&mdash;read it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  responded Eustace, shortly, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t intend to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is rather a corker for weak nerves,&rdquo; said &ldquo;The Pepper Box&rdquo; proprietor, affably;  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Gibbles&mdash;perfect genius as critic; always slashes a book without  reading it. He&rsquo;s destroyed more reputations than any one I know. Yes! Ah! fancy  Maniswarkoffi being here&mdash;pianist, you know. English, only they wouldn&rsquo;t have  him under his real name of Grubs, so he went abroad and dug up his present  jawbreaker. Draws money now, and smashes two pianos a week&mdash;beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this way Mr. Dolser artlessly prattled along, destroying a reputation every  time he opened his mouth, much to the disgust of Gartney, who wanted to get  away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me,&rdquo; he said, in despair, &ldquo;but I see a friend over there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  do you really?&rdquo; replied Dolser, putting up his eyeglass. &ldquo;Oh, Macjean, isn&rsquo;t  it? Yes. Just come back from America. Had a row with pa because he wanted him  to marry some Scotch lassie. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to know all about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; oh, yes. Business, you know&mdash;and by Jove! talking about that, I want an  interview with you about your book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you won&rsquo;t get one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all you know,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Dolser. &ldquo;What? You won&rsquo;t tell me anything? Never  mind, I&rsquo;ll make up a few fairy tales. If they ain&rsquo;t true that&rsquo;s your look-out.  Ta, ta! Look in &lsquo;The Pepper Box&rsquo; next week. Jove! there&rsquo;s Quibbles. &lsquo;Cuse me, I  want to ask about Bundy&rsquo;s divorce,&rdquo; and he disappeared into the crowd.</p>
  <p>It  was no use being angry with the little man, as he was so very good-natured with  all his impudence, so Eustace merely smiled, and moving across the room to  Otterburn, touched him on the shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  here?&rdquo; he said, in a tone of glad surprise. &ldquo;I <i>am</i> glad! I was just going  away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  enjoying yourself?&rdquo; observed Eustace, leaning against the wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  any one enjoy himself here?&rdquo; retorted Otterburn in disgust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of  hearing people talk about themselves; and if they talk about anyone else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  abuse them thoroughly. My dear boy, it&rsquo;s the way of the world. By the way, you  got my note about Victoria?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otterburn  coloured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you,&rdquo; he replied, in his boyish fashion. &ldquo;If it is  only true what you think, that she does care for me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course she cares for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems too good to be true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think so?&rdquo; said Gartney, drily. &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon. I forgot you are in  love!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cold-blooded  cynic,&rdquo; laughed Otterburn, &ldquo;go thou and do likewise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  your awful example before me&mdash;hardly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gartney, with a kindly look  in his eyes. &ldquo;Did I tell you Errington is here to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Is he really?&mdash;and Lady Errington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she&rsquo;s in the country. But Errington seemed as if he wanted waking up, so I  brought him to town with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way, how is Lady Errington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  much changed&mdash;and for the better. My prophecy concerning the incomplete Madonna  has come to pass. She is a mother now, and adores her child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  And is she going to adore her child for the rest of her life?&rdquo; asked Otterburn,  flippantly.</p>
  <p>Eustace  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. She certainly can&rsquo;t adore her husband. Guy is a real good fellow,  as I&rsquo;ve always maintained, but no woman in the world would put him on a  pedestal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Errington! Is he as fond of his wife as ever?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fonder,  if possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I pity him!&rdquo; said Macjean, emphatically&mdash;&ldquo;I pity any man who gives his heart to  a woman to play with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  that is really what you propose to do with yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I am going to ask Miss Sheldon to be my wife once more. If she accepts  me, well and good, as I&rsquo;ve no doubt we&rsquo;ll make an exemplary married couple. But  if she refuses&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m not going to wear my heart on my sleeve by any means.  There is always Laxton, Africa, and good shooting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  of which will console you for the loss of the woman you profess to adore. What  a prosaic idea!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very sensible one, at all events,&rdquo; retorted Macjean, with a grim smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no fancy to play shuttlecock to any woman&rsquo;s battledore. Oh! there is Errington  talking to our fair hostess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  rather, our fair hostess is talking to Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely.  You shouldn&rsquo;t have led this unfortunate fly into the spider&rsquo;s parlour, Gartney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; replied Eustace, superciliously. &ldquo;I assure you the fly is all right. It  is not rich enough for Mrs. Spider Veilsturm to seize on. She only cares for  opulent flies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid I can&rsquo;t take your view of the situation, seeing what I now see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gartney,  moved by a sudden curiosity, looked sharply at Cleopatra, who was certainly  putting forth all her fascinations towards Guy, and that gentleman, who had  apparently forgotten his wife for the moment, was talking rapidly to her with a  flushed face and considerable earnestness. Eustace was puzzled at this, and  frowned amiably at the pair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  what the deuce is that for?&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;I certainly did not ask  her to fascinate him, and she has no reason to do so. Humph! Perhaps Fate is  once more interfering. If so&mdash;Well, Otterburn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Otterburn had disappeared, and Eustace found that his place was taken by Dolly  Thambits, attended by Mr. Jiddy, both gentlemen watching Mrs. Veilsturm over  Gartney&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  how do you do, Thambits?&rdquo; said Gartney, taking no notice of the Jiddy parasite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  quite well,&rdquo; replied Dolly, whose mild face wore anything but a pleasant  expression. &ldquo;I say, who is he&mdash;the chap talking to Mrs. Veilsturm? He came with  you, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  that is Sir Guy Errington, my cousin and very good friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  returned Mr. Thambits, after a pause. &ldquo;I thought he was married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course&mdash;married Miss Mostyn,&rdquo; murmured Jiddy, meekly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  marriage isn&rsquo;t a crime,&rdquo; said Eustace, raising his eyebrows. &ldquo;What is the  meaning of the remark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;  answered Dolly, vacantly, with another scowl at Cleopatra. &ldquo;Oh, nothing only&mdash;oh,  bother! they&rsquo;ve gone into the next room. Come, Jiddy!&rdquo; and the young man  vanished into the crowd, accompanied by his umbra, leaving Eustace in a state  of considerable bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the boy mad,&rdquo; said that gentleman to himself, &ldquo;or only jealous? The latter, I  think. He sees it too. Confound it! What does it mean? She&rsquo;s surely not going  to fight an enemy unworthy of her spear? Yet, I don&rsquo;t know. Women are strange  creatures. She must have some reason. I&rsquo;ll go and see what Major Griff says  about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  redoubtable warrior, looking stiffer, airier, and more military than ever, was  talking in his sharp voice to a ponderous gentleman somewhat after the Dr.  Johnson type, who was listening attentively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; the Major was saying, &ldquo;I am growing tired of town. I think I&rsquo;ll take a  run across to New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mrs. Veilsturm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not aware what Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s plans may be,&rdquo; said Griff, in a frigid tone,  &ldquo;as she does not honour me with her confidence so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  ponderous gentleman smiled meaningly, as he, in common with the rest of  society, was beginning to doubt the platonic relationship said to exist between  the Major and Cleopatra. Major Griff saw the smile, and, ever on the alert to  defend Mrs. Veilsturm from the slightest breath of scandal, would have made  some sharp remark, but at that moment Eustace touched him on the shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, Major,&rdquo; he said courteously, &ldquo;but could I speak to you for a few moments?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  certainly,&rdquo; answered Griff, with great readiness. &ldquo;Mr. Waldon, we will resume  our conversation on some other occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was always willing to oblige Eustace from motives of diplomacy, as he was well  aware Mr. Gartney was to a certain extent behind the scenes, and judged himself  and Cleopatra from a very different standpoint to that of the world. Eustace  indeed knew that both Major Griff and his fair friend were neither more nor  less than a couple of clever adventurers, but with indolent good nature he  never imparted this opinion to any one, as he saw no reason to topple down the  house of cards they had so laboriously built up. Besides, he hated the trouble  which the exposing of the pair would entail, and, in his innermost heart  deeming them not much worse than the rest of London society, he permitted them  to continue their predatory career unchecked. The Major knew that Eustace would  leave himself and partner alone, but was always scrupulously polite to him, so  that nothing disagreeable should arise to mar the perfect understanding between  them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad to see you back again, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; said the Major, mendaciously, when  they were established in a comfortable corner out of earshot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very kind of you to say so,&rdquo; responded Gartney, who quite appreciated and  understood the sincerity of the remark, &ldquo;I thought you would have been glad to  have heard of my death in Arabia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why?&rdquo; demanded Griff, warmly&mdash;&ldquo;why, Mr. Gartney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; retorted Eustace, maliciously; &ldquo;but  don&rsquo;t trouble yourself to pay fictitious compliments, Major. I think we  understand one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; assented the Major, with great dignity; &ldquo;between gentlemen there is  always a sympathetic feeling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gartney  would have liked to have argued this point, but having no time to do so, he  merely shrugged his shoulders, and resumed the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  brought my cousin, Sir Guy Errington, here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  devil you did!&rdquo; ejaculated Griff, considerably astonished.</p>
  <p>Struck  by the Major&rsquo;s tone, Eustace fixed his eyes keenly on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you doubt me,&rdquo; he said coolly, &ldquo;you will be convinced by going to the  refreshment room, where, at present, he is in conversation with Mrs. Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Egad!  she&rsquo;s got him at last,&rdquo; muttered Griff, pulling his grey moustache with an air  of vexation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you say?&rdquo; asked Gartney sharply.</p>
  <p>Major  Griff did not answer, being apparently in deep thought, but when Gartney  addressed him the second time he had evidently made up his mind what course to  pursue, and spoke accordingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t suit me,&rdquo; said the Major deliberately, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t suit you,  nor your cousin, nor your cousin&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is as I thought,&rdquo; observed Eustace coolly; &ldquo;there is something at the bottom of  all this, therefore, if you will be less enigmatic, Major, I shall understand  your meaning all the sooner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like to show my hand,&rdquo; remarked Griff, taking an illustration from his  favourite pursuit, &ldquo;but in this case I&rsquo;ll treat you as a partner and do so. I  know why you want to speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you?&rdquo; said Eustace imperturbably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  She&rdquo;&mdash;referring to Mrs. Veilsturm&mdash;&ldquo;is no doubt making the running with Sir Guy  Errington to an extent which surprises you, and you want to know the reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seeing  that my cousin is not rich enough to tempt either Mrs. V. or yourself, I do,&rdquo;  returned Eustace with brutal candour.</p>
  <p>Whereupon,  the Major, like the daring old campaigner he was, told Gartney the whole story  of the card episode, to which he listened attentively, and saw clearly the pit  into which he had innocently led his cousin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; said Griff, when the story was finished and Eustace made no  remark, &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  took out his watch and glanced at the time before replying. Then he replaced it  in his pocket and answered the Major.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  present, I say nothing; later on, I may.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  ho!&rdquo; quoth Griff sharply, &ldquo;then you have some idea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no idea whatever,&rdquo; replied Gartney sharply. &ldquo;Your story was quite new to  me. I brought my cousin here innocently enough, and if Mrs. Veilsturm thinks  him sufficiently handsome to captivate, that&rsquo;s her business, not mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned on his heel and went off, leaving Griff staring after him in the most  astonished manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it mean?&rdquo; pondered the old campaigner. &ldquo;Oh! he doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind  Maraquita playing the devil with his cousin, as she intends to. Now I shouldn&rsquo;t  wonder,&rdquo; said the Major grimly, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder a bit if there was another  lady mixed up in this affair.&rdquo;</p>

    The lesson learned<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will do you good.<br>
    You have returned,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  Otterburn disappeared so suddenly from the sight of his friend, he had gone straight  across the room to where a slender girl dressed in a dark-green walking costume  was standing near the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you remember an old friend, Miss Sheldon?&rdquo; he said in a low voice.</p>
  <p>She  turned round with a cry of surprise, flushing violently as she recognised him,  and held out her hand with the greatest self-possession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course Mr. Macjean! My memory is not quite so short as you think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were both overcome by this unexpected meeting, but as the eyes of the world  were on them they were perforce obliged to hide their emotions under a polite  mask of indifference. No one, looking at this charming girl and this handsome  young man, would have thought there was anything between them but the merest  feelings of acquaintanceship. And yet they were both profoundly moved, and  each, in some instinctive way, guessed the feelings of the other, although  their greeting was so cold and studied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not expect to meet you here,&rdquo; said Victoria in a friendly tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose not,&rdquo; replied Otterburn politely, &ldquo;as I only returned to Town about  three weeks ago.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  over the world. Africa is the only place left for me to explore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I daresay you are thinking of going there next?&rdquo; Otterburn laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps!  It all depends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Truth  to tell, I hardly know,&rdquo; answered Macjean coolly. &ldquo;Whims, fancies and desires  of sport, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t care a bit about me or he would not talk so coldly about going away,&rdquo;  thought Victoria, with a sad feeling at her heart, but, being too proud to show  her real feelings, merely laughed as she answered his remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing like enthusiasm! Well, Mr. Macjean, I&rsquo;m glad to see you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you really mean that?&rdquo; he said anxiously, &ldquo;or is it only the conventional  society phrase?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should you think so?&rdquo; replied Miss Sheldon in a displeased tone. &ldquo;You know I  always spoke my mind regardless of social observances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not forgotten that,&rdquo; observed Otterburn quietly. &ldquo;Candour is such a  wonderful thing to meet with now-a-days, that anyone with such a virtue is sure  to be remembered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  nine days, I suppose?&rdquo; she said jestingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  or eighteen months,&rdquo; he responded meaningly.</p>
  <p>Otterburn  was evidently as audacious as ever in trespassing upon dangerous ground, so  Victoria, although her heart beat rapidly at his last remark, deftly turned the  conversation as she used to do in the old days.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have an excellent memory, Mr. Macjean,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;but you have forgotten  that I have been standing for the last ten minutes, that you have not asked me  to have a cup of tea, and that I&rsquo;m both tired and thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  thousand pardons,&rdquo; said Otterburn, penitently offering his arm. &ldquo;I plead  guilty! As you are strong, be merciful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  your failings, certainly! I&rsquo;ve got too many of my own to refuse absolution. Oh,  there&rsquo;s Miss Lossins going to sing. I can&rsquo;t bear these drawing-room songs, so  let us go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  took his arm, and as they moved downstairs he felt a thrill run through his  body at the light pressure of her hand. He felt inclined to speak boldly then  and there, but a vague fear of the result withheld him, and in the presence of  the woman he loved, Angus Macjean, man of the world as he was, felt like an  awkward schoolboy.</p>
  <p>On  her part, Victoria felt that she still had an influence on his life, and  derived from this instinctive feeling a wonderful amount of pleasure, which  could only have been engendered in her breast by a sentiment of reciprocity.</p>
  <p>Owing  to some ridiculous feeling of pride, neither of them referred to Como during  the whole of their conversation, as their parting at that place had been so  painful, and although they were both thinking about it yet they talked of  everything in the world except what was uppermost in their minds. They had  thought of, dreamt of, loved, and desired one another all through these weary  eighteen months, and now when they were together and a word would have removed  all misunderstandings, neither the man nor the woman had the courage to utter  it.</p>
  <p>At  present, however, they were downstairs indulging in the slight dissipation of  afternoon tea, and Victoria, knowing that Otterburn was still her admirer, was  quite at her ease, talking gaily about everything and everyone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is awfully nice tea,&rdquo; she said, nodding her head to the Master. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you  try some?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will, on your recommendation,&rdquo; he replied, taking a cup the maid was holding  out, &ldquo;but won&rsquo;t you have some cake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  there&rsquo;s some very curranty cake, I will,&rdquo; said Miss Sheldon gluttonously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  have the brown outside piece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should that be more desirable than any other piece?&rdquo; said Macjean as she took  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  currants in it! I&rsquo;m fond of currants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it seems.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  don&rsquo;t be severe. Let&rsquo;s talk about something else. Mr. Gartney, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he really? I thought it would be too frivolous for him. The Arabian desert is  more in his style.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  judging from his book, the Arabian Desert is not entirely devoid of feminine  interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be horrid! It&rsquo;s a very charming book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  said it wasn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;m astonished to hear you defend Gartney like this. You  used to hate him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! I didn&rsquo;t exactly hate him, but I must say I didn&rsquo;t like him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that splitting straws?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; retorted Miss Sheldon gaily, &ldquo;the two things are widely different. But  to return to Mr. Gartney. He&rsquo;s really very nice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  so glad you think so,&rdquo; said Otterburn gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; exclaimed Victoria, with genuine alarm. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have him know it  for the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  hide the Sheldon light under the Gartney bushel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  talking nonsense, but you always did talk nonsense. But, good gracious, look at  the time&mdash;six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that clock&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I&mdash;in listening to you. Mr. Macjean, I must go. My chaperon will be waiting  for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is your chaperon?&rdquo; asked Otterburn, as they ascended the stairs. &ldquo;Mrs.  Trubbles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  she&rsquo;s in the country. Now I am under the care of Mrs. Dills. Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  as the wife of Mr. Dills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  a most amiable woman, but not pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curious  thing, amiable women never are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  cruel&mdash;to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon!  you are the exception&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  prove your extremely severe rule! Thank you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Talking  in this light and airy manner, which was really assumed to hide their real  feelings, Miss Sheldon and her lover arrived at the drawing-room, found Mrs.  Dills, small, spiteful and vivacious, to whom Victoria introduced the Master,  and then went off to say goodbye to Mrs. Veilsturm.</p>
  <p>When  she returned, and Otterburn was escorting her downstairs in the train of Mrs.  Dills he noticed a puzzled look on her face, and promptly asked the reason of  it. She did not answer at first, but as they stood on the step, waiting for the  carriage, suddenly asked him a question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  introduced Sir Guy Errington to Mrs. Veilsturm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gartney  did&mdash;to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo;  she repeated, in astonishment. &ldquo;Why from their manner to one another I thought  they were old friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Veilsturm has such a sympathetic manner you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  very sympathetic,&rdquo; replied Victoria, sarcastically. &ldquo;But here is the carriage  Goodbye, Mr. Macjean. Come and call on Aunt Jelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!  I am anxious to make the acquaintance of Aunt Jelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  anxious that you delayed the pleasure by three months,&rdquo; replied Miss Sheldon  laughing, as the carriage drove away, leaving Otterburn on the steps in a very  jubilant frame of mind.</p>
  <p>When  he had somewhat recovered his presence of mind, he went off to find Eustace,  being so overburdened with his secret happiness that he felt it a necessity to  speak to some one on the subject. Eustace knew all about his passion, Eustace  had been a good friend in finding out Victoria&rsquo;s sentiments towards him, so  Eustace was undoubtedly the proper person to speak to in this emergency.</p>
  <p>After  a hunt of some moments&rsquo; duration, he found Mr. Gartney in company with  Errington, talking to Mrs. Veilsturm, and while the latter seemed flushed and  excited, the face of the former wore an enigmatic smile. Mrs. Veilsturm herself  had been aroused from her habitual languor, and was chatting gaily, while Major  Griff, ostensibly talking to Dolly Thambits, was in reality looking at  Errington with a frown. It was quite a little comedy, and Eustace alone  possessed the requisite understanding to enjoy it, although from the studied  expression of his face it was impossible to tell his real feelings.</p>
  <p>Otterburn  touched Eustace on the shoulder, and drew him away from the group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, I believe it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, in a eager whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is all right?&rdquo; asked Eustace, in a puzzled voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you know,&rdquo; replied  Otterburn, with some disgust at his friend&rsquo;s density. &ldquo;I met Miss Sheldon here,  and&mdash;and I spoke to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; observed Gartney, with a kindly smile. &ldquo;I suppose I must  congratulate you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet. But I think it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Otterburn, repeating his first remark. &ldquo;The  way she talked, you know, and I talked also, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you&rsquo;re counting your chickens before they&rsquo;re hatched,&rdquo; said Gartney  impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Macjean,&rdquo; he added, seeing Angus looked annoyed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  only my fun! I think it will be all right&mdash;that is if she&rsquo;s forgiven you for the  Como business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;  said Otterburn, obtusely. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s she who requires to be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid you won&rsquo;t find her take that view of the question,&rdquo; replied Gartney  cruelly. &ldquo;In love, the woman is always right and the man everlastingly wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a dog-in-the-manger you are, Gartney,&rdquo; said Otterburn angrily, the brightness  dying out of his face, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t love anyone yourself, or let anyone else do  it. I tell you Miss Sheldon and myself understand one another. She asked me to  call and see Aunt Jelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  delightful&mdash;for Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; remarked Eustace sarcastically. &ldquo;I hope the pair of  you won&rsquo;t indulge in sentiment before the old lady&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t believe in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take my chance of that,&rdquo; observed Angus cheerfully. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got such a lot to  tell you about Victoria. Come along with me to the Club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; replied Gartney, in a resigned manner. &ldquo;It seems my fate to hear love  confidences. I&rsquo;ll come as soon as I can persuade Guy to leave Mrs. Veilsturm,  or rather as soon as I can persuade Mrs. Veilsturm to let Guy go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me six of one and half a dozen of the other, as far as that goes,&rdquo;  said Otterburn shrewdly.</p>
  <p>Eustace  did not reply, but walked up to his cousin and the lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid we must go, Mrs. Veilsturm,&rdquo; he said, smiling at Cleopatra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s early yet,&rdquo; remarked Cleopatra languidly. &ldquo;Must you go, Sir Guy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so,&rdquo; answered Errington, looking at his watch. &ldquo;Time, tide and dinner  wait for no man. It&rsquo;s past six.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  like a man,&rdquo; laughed Cleopatra, &ldquo;thinking of his dinner before everything else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  really,&rdquo; responded Errington, colouring at this rude remark, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got an  engagement, and I always like to be punctual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case don&rsquo;t forget my &lsquo;At Home&rsquo; next week,&rdquo; said the lady, with a  bewitching glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I won&rsquo;t forget that,&rdquo; replied Errington coolly, much more coolly than  Cleopatra liked, but she suppressed her anger at his nonchalance, and turned to  Eustace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye,  Mr. Gartney, so good of you to have come to-day. Mr. Maclean, I&rsquo;ve no doubt I&rsquo;ll  see you to-night at Lady Kerstoke&rsquo;s dance. Sir Guy, I hope you will find your  way here again. Goodbye, all of you,&rdquo; and then her attention was claimed by  another batch of departing guests, while the three gentlemen went downstairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Eustace, with a sigh of relief, as they walked down Park Lane, &ldquo;I must  candidly confess I hate &lsquo;At Homes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; replied Otterburn, with his mind full of Victoria, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re very jolly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  for the freshness of youth!&rdquo; sighed Gartney, looking at the bright face of his  companion. &ldquo;Guy, what is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about?&rdquo; asked Errington, rousing himself from a fit of abstraction. &ldquo;Mrs.  Veilsturm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  were talking about &lsquo;At Homes,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Eustace, equably, &ldquo;but as you&rsquo;ve mentioned  Mrs. Veilsturm, what is your opinion on that lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  very pleasant, but rather overpowering,&rdquo; was Errington&rsquo;s verdict.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that&rsquo;s her reward for devoting the whole afternoon to you&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, the ingratitude  of man!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  not a woman I would fall in love with,&rdquo; said Otterburn, with an air of having  settled the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I,&rdquo; echoed Sir Guy, so very resolutely that Eustace knew at once he was  doubtful of his own strength of will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Self  righteous Pharisees, both,&rdquo; he said scoffingly, &ldquo;you talk bravely, but if  Cleopatra put forth her strength she could twist you both round her finger.&rdquo;</p>

    Fascination</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Snake!  snake! your treacherous eyes,<br>
    Grow and deepen to marvellous skies,<br>
    Stars shine out in the rosy space,<br>
    Every star is a woman&rsquo;s face,<br>
    Flushed and wreathed with amorous smiles,<br>
    Drawing my soul with magical wiles,<br>
    Vision! while I am rapt in thee,<br>
    Death is coming unknown to me.<br>
    Snake hath caught me fast in his toils,<br>
    Round me winding his shining coils,<br>
    Ah, from dreams with a start I wake,<br>
    Thou hast stung me, oh cruel snake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Most  men of strongly imaginative natures are superstitious, and Gartney was no  exception to the rule, his instinctive leanings in this direction having been  strengthened to a considerable extent by his contact with the fatalistic  dreamers of the East. He had travelled over a goodly portion of the world  without having been infected by the habits or thoughts of the so-called  civilized races but the many months he had dwelt among the descendants of  Ishmael, had inoculated him imperceptibly with their strong belief in  predestination. In fact, his adaptability to the ways and customs of the East,  seemed, to himself, so marvellous, that he almost inclined to the theory of  transmigration, and believed he had lived before amid these lonely deserts.</p>
  <p>At  all events, his last sojourn among them had developed his instinctive vein of  superstition in the strongest fashion, and he came back to England fully  convinced that all things were preordained by the deity we call Fate. It was a  very convenient doctrine, as it enabled him to blame a supernatural power for  his own shortcomings, and when anything happened out of the ordinary course of  events, he said &ldquo;Kismet,&rdquo; like the veriest follower of Mahomet.</p>
  <p>With  this belief, it was little to be wondered at that he believed he saw the finger  of Fate intervening in the matter of his love for Lady Errington, and argued  the question in this style:</p>
  <p>On  his return to England, he had determined to abstain from seeing Alizon so as to  keep out of the way of temptation, but Fate, in the person of Aunt Jelly, had  forced him to meet her against his will in order to see if he could bring about  an understanding between the young couple. Yielding to his passion, he had made  up his mind to gratify it, but moved by the spectacle of Guy&rsquo;s misery, had  gained a victory over himself, and strove to reconcile husband and wife.</p>
  <p>With  this aim, he had taken Guy up to Town, thinking a short absence might be  beneficial, but Fate for the second time interfered, and in the most innocent  fashion in the world he (Fate&rsquo;s instrument) had delivered the young man into  the power of his bitterest enemy, by introducing him to Mrs. Veilsturm. She  hated Lady Errington, and would certainly do her best to estrange husband and  wife still further, thus the field was left open to Eustace to declare his  dishonourable passion.</p>
  <p>Twice,  therefore, had he striven to conquer his feeling, and twice Fate had  intervened, so that he now felt inclined to fight no longer. Had he given way  to his present desires, he would have left Guy to the tender mercies of  Cleopatra, and gone down to stay at Castle Grim from whence he would have been  able to go over to Errington Hall daily and pay his court to Alizon. All  feelings of honour, however, were not absolutely dead in his breast, so he  determined to await the course of events and see if Mrs. Veilsturm would manage  to subjugate Guy, in which case he determined to interfere. He knew quite  enough about Mrs. Veilsturm, for his opinion to carry considerable weight with  that lady, and although it was not a pleasant thing to step between a panther  and its prey, yet he made up his mind to do so should occasion arise. But if  Fate intervened for the third time, and rendered his trouble useless, Eustace  felt in his own heart that further struggling against Destiny would be beyond  his strength.</p>
  <p>At  present, however, he had rather over-estimated the situation, as Guy was by no  means the abject slave of Mrs. Veilsturm he deemed him to be. Love for Alizon,  although but ill-requited, still had possession of Guy&rsquo;s whole being, and  formed a safeguard against the dangerous assaults of Cleopatra. Errington was  constantly in attendance on her, and she put forth all her arts to enmesh him  in her toils, but although three weeks had now passed, she saw that she had not  made much headway. Guy liked her for her kindly manner towards him, admired her  for her beauty, felt flattered by her preference, but in reality was as  heart-whole as when he first saw her, and had his wife lifted her little  finger, he would have flown to her side without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
  <p>Cleopatra  was much too clever a woman not to see this, and felt rather nettled that any  man should dare to withstand her charms. Moreover, being bent on separating  Errington from his wife, she had a very powerful reason to do her best in  reducing him to a state of bondage; therefore spared neither time nor trouble  in attempting to do so. Errington&rsquo;s love for his wife, however, stood him in  good stead, and despite the temptations to which he was subjected, he did not  succumb in any way.</p>
  <p>Major  Griff was by no means pleased with this new fancy of his friend and partner. As  a rule, by dexterous management, he could make her do what he liked, but on  some occasions she broke away from leading-strings, and did what she pleased.  This present desire to captivate Errington was due, not to a feeling of love,  but to the more powerful one of revenge, and Griff, being an astute reader of  character, saw that in her present frame of mind he could do nothing with her.</p>
  <p>It  was a terrible trouble to the Major that things should be like this, as during  this season Rumour had once more been busy with Cleopatra&rsquo;s name, and to such a  good purpose, that many doors hitherto open were now closed against her.  Society began to talk of the number of men who had lost large sums of money at  Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s, hinted that the West Indian estates were a myth, and that  Cleopatra was no better than an adventuress. Society suddenly discovered that  it had been deceived, that a base woman had passed herself off as the purest of  her sex, that it had nourished a viper in its bosom; so now Society, in  righteous wrath, was prepared to denounce Mrs. Veilsturm and Major Griff with  the bitterest vindictiveness from the house-tops. The storm had not broken yet,  but could be heard muttering in the distance, and now this foolish passion of  Cleopatra so openly displayed would accelerate the period of its bursting.</p>
  <p>The  Major, having his eyes and ears open on every possible occasion, saw all this,  and took measures to secure a safe retreat in case of an unexpected collapse of  the London campaign. America was to be the next field of the firm&rsquo;s operations,  and both the Major and his fair friend had determined to signalize their  departure by a grand fancy dress ball, to which friends and foes alike were to  be invited, after which they could depart with flying colours to New York.</p>
  <p>This  little scheme had been very nicely arranged, but unluckily this Errington  affair threatened to upset the whole business. Knowing she had very little time  at her disposal, and being determined to ruin Guy&rsquo;s life if she possibly could,  Cleopatra went beyond all the bounds of prudence, and blazoned her preference  for Errington so very openly that everyone was scandalized.</p>
  <p>In  vain the Major implored Cleopatra to be cautious and not ruin everything by her  mad folly; but, carried away by a fierce feeling of revenge against Lady  Errington, she merely laughed at his entreaties and prosecuted her scheme of  entangling Guy with redoubled ardour. Major Griff spoke to Eustace, thinking he  could stop the affair by taking his cousin away, but Gartney, being determined  to leave the matter in the hands of Fate, simply shrugged his shoulders and  said he could do nothing. Being therefore unable to do anything, the Major  could only look on in a cold fury at Cleopatra striving to ruin herself,  Errington, and himself in a fit of mad anger.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm&rsquo;s intimate friends were also very indignant about what they pleased  to call her infatuation, little dreaming of the real reason of this sudden  passion. It was only the Major&rsquo;s influence over Mr. Dolser that kept the affair  out of the scurrilous pages of &ldquo;The Pepper Box,&rdquo; but although it had not  appeared in print, the whole affair was an open secret.</p>
  <p>Dolly  Thambits, who was in love with Cleopatra, was furious at the way in which he  was neglected, but this kind of treatment only made him all the more in love  with his disdainful mistress, much to the relief of Griff, who was afraid that  the boy would escape from his toils.</p>
  <p>In  the midst of this whirl of rage, envy, and revenge, Guy, seeing no special  favour in Cleopatra&rsquo;s condescension, was quite cool and composed, being the  most unconcerned person of the whole lot. Of course, no one dared to speak to  him about the real facts of the case, and of the enmity he had provoked, so he  remained in complete ignorance, anxiously awaiting for a letter from his wife  asking him to return.</p>
  <p>That  letter never came, however, for Alizon was perfectly happy with her baby, and  missed Errington no more than if he had been a stock or stone. She knew nothing  of the perils to which her husband was exposed, and, curiously enough, none of  her London friends wrote and told her, else she might have been for once  startled from the serene pleasures of motherhood.</p>
  <p>According  to his promise, Otterburn called upon Aunt Jelly, and was graciously received  by that strong-minded lady, who took a great fancy to him. As yet, he had not  spoken outright to Victoria, but still the young couple understood one another,  and such understanding was approved of by Miss Corbin, who saw in Otterburn the  very husband she would have chosen for her ward. So Otterburn called on the old  lady pretty often, and brought her all the news of the town, while Victoria,  feeling completely at rest concerning her lover, listened quietly.</p>
  <p>All  her ideas of making Otterburn propose, and then refusing him out of revenge,  had quite vanished, as she was now passionately in love with him, and according  to the position now strangely altered since those old days at Como, it was for  her to crave and for him to grant. Otterburn, however, knew nothing of this,  but wooed in all honour and timidity, while Aunt Jelly, like a good but grim  cherub, looked on in silent approval.</p>
  <p>It  was during one of Otterburn&rsquo;s visits, that by chance he let fall something of  what was going on between Mrs. Veilsturm and Guy, whereupon the old lady,  having an eye like a hawk, immediately saw that something was going on of which  she knew nothing. With this idea she waited till Maclean departed, and then put  Victoria through her facings, with the result that she found out all about it  and was terribly wroth against her nephew.</p>
  <p>Eustace  called to see her, and she spoke to him about it, but Eustace point-blank  refused to interfere again, saying he had done his best, but could now do no  more. Aunt Jelly, therefore, being alarmed, not only for the happiness but for  the respectability of the Errington household, wrote a note to Guy, asking him to  call.</p>
  <p>Having  despatched this, she worked herself up into such a fury over the whole affair  that she took a fit, and for some time was in danger of dying, but her  indomitable spirit asserted itself, and with iron determination she arose from  her bed of sickness to see her nephew.</p>
  <p>It  was a fight between Cleopatra and Aunt Jelly for possession of Guy, but all  this time Guy had no more idea of playing his wife false, than he had of  returning Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s openly-displayed passion.</p>

  <p>Aunt  Jelly was looking very pale and ill on the day she elected to see Guy in order  to expostulate with him on the wild way in which he was behaving. She was  suffering from a very serious disease connected with the heart, and Dr.  Pargowker warned her against any undue excitement, as it might prove fatal. He  was seated with her now, a fat, oily man of the Chadband species, and talked  about her ill-health in his usual unctuous manner.</p>
  <p>In  her accustomed chair sat Miss Corbin, looking worn with illness, but as grim  and defiant as ever, while the doctor standing near her felt her pulse with one  hand, and held his watch with the other. Minnie, ever watchful of her patroness&rsquo;s  comfort, hovered round like an unquiet spirit, bringing all sorts of  unnecessary things, which made Aunt Jelly very irritable and led her to say  unpleasant things to Miss Pelch which reduced the poetess to tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  said Miss Corbin sharply, when Dr. Pargowker had finished with her pulse, &ldquo;what  do you say? Is this illness serious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor lifted one fat white hand in gentle protest, and resumed his seat with a  comfortable sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dearest lady, no,&rdquo; he said in his heavy, soft voice, &ldquo;do not I beg of you think  you are so bad as all that. You remind me, if I may be permitted to make the  comparison, of a dear friend of mine who departed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bother  your dear friend!&rdquo; snapped Aunt Jelly in her grimmest manner. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you  here to tell me other people&rsquo;s histories. I want to know about my own state of  health.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Pargowker folded his chubby hands complacently on his rotund stomach and meekly  ventured a protest against this language.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not, oh dearest lady,&rdquo; he said unctuously, &ldquo;do not excite yourself like this.  It is bad for you, dearest lady, very bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  bad, dear Miss Corbin,&rdquo; echoed Minnie tearfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  might lead to complications,&rdquo; pursued the doctor, shaking his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Complications,&rdquo;  echoed Miss Pelch, putting her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Minnie,&rdquo;  said Aunt Jelly politely, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re getting a bigger fool every day. Have the  goodness to hold your tongue and not talk of things you know nothing about. Dr.  Pargowker, if you will kindly leave off nodding your head like a Chinese  mandarin, and tell me straight out what you mean, I should feel obliged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dearest  lady,&rdquo; growled the doctor, &ldquo;it is useless to conceal from you the painful fact  that you are very ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that sir,&rdquo; retorted Aunt Jelly coolly, &ldquo;go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must avoid all undue excitement, such as dances, theatres, and seeing friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t been to a dance for the last twenty years,&rdquo; said Miss Corbin  wrathfully, &ldquo;and as for a theatre, I&rsquo;ve got no time to waste on that rubbish.  What do you mean by talking such nonsense to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easily  upset, I see,&rdquo; murmured Pargowker, apparently to himself, &ldquo;very easily upset.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  you like a little pillow for your head, dear Miss Jelly?&rdquo; said Minnie, holding  one over Miss Corbin as though she were going to play Othello to the old lady&rsquo;s  Desdemona.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like a little common sense,&rdquo; retorted Miss Corbin, pushing away the pillow, &ldquo;but  it seems I&rsquo;m not likely to get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  calm, dear lady, be calm,&rdquo; observed Dr. Pargowker, nodding his head. &ldquo;If you  will permit me, I will write out a prescription.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pen,  ink, and paper, Minnie!&rdquo; ordered Aunt Jelly, glaring at the doctor.</p>
  <p>The  obliging Minnie flew to obtain these necessaries, and having done so, placed  them on a little table near the physician, who wheeled his chair round and  began to write.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly and Dr. Pargowker were old friends, and never parted without a fight,  which, however, was principally conducted by Miss Corbin, as the doctor  resolutely kept his temper, and always left the room as bland, cool, and  unruffled as when he entered it. In spite of his round-about way of putting  things, Pargowker was really very clever at his profession, and Aunt Jelly  reposed the utmost confidence in his power, although she never could resist  using her sharp tongue on him when occasion offered, and as it did so now, Aunt  Jelly began to talk, showing thereby that she was not so ill as she seemed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  knows how you get patients,&rdquo; she said, folding her bony hands, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all chat  with you and nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear,  dear,&rdquo; murmured Pargowker, going on placidly with his writing, &ldquo;this is bad,  very, very bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you talking about your prescription, or yourself?&rdquo; snapped Miss Corbin,  dauntlessly. &ldquo;I daresay they&rsquo;re much of a muchness. If one doesn&rsquo;t kill me, I&rsquo;ve  no doubt the other will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, dearest lady,&rdquo; said the doctor, smiling blandly, &ldquo;you are in error. This  prescription will do you a great deal of good. Oh, we will pull you round, yes&mdash;yes.  I think I may venture to say we will pull you round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pull  me round or square, it&rsquo;s easily seen I&rsquo;m not long for this world,&rdquo; replied Miss  Corbin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do not speak like that, Miss Jelly,&rdquo; whimpered Minnie, &ldquo;you will get quite  well, I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!  aye!&rdquo; remarked Pargowker, folding up his prescription. &ldquo;While there&rsquo;s life,  there&rsquo;s hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  quote your proverbs to me,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, determined not to be pleased by  anything, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re nothing but traditional lies; but seriously speaking,  doctor, if you can speak seriously, which I&rsquo;m very much inclined to doubt, I  want to see my nephew, Sir Guy Errington, to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  dearest lady, no!&rdquo; said Pargowker, rising from his seat, and raising one hand  in protest, &ldquo;pardon me, no!&mdash;the very worst person you could see!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you knew him as well as I do, you might well say that,&rdquo; replied Miss Corbin,  malignantly, &ldquo;but I must see him. It&rsquo;s imperative.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will not excite yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not going to excite myself,&rdquo; retorted Aunt Jelly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to excite him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Pargowker took up his hat and buttoned his coat with the air of a man who  washed his hands of the whole affair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you attend to my orders,&rdquo; he said, speaking more sharply than was usual with  him, &ldquo;you will see no one. But I know you of old, Miss Corbin. You expect to be  cured, but won&rsquo;t do what you&rsquo;re told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Heavens!&rdquo; ejaculated Aunt Jelly, with feeble merriment. &ldquo;Have you taken to  poetry also? The idea is good, doctor, but the poetry is worse than Minnie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Miss Jelly!&rdquo; murmured Minnie, in tearful protest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; said Pargowker, good-humouredly, shaking hands with Miss Corbin, &ldquo;poetry  or not, dear lady, do what I tell you. Keep yourself calm, see no one, take  this prescription, and I think, yes, I think you will be quite safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt about it,&rdquo; cried Aunt Jelly, as he paused at the door, &ldquo;safe for the  nearest cemetery. Go along with you, doctor. I tell you I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to  see my nephew. It&rsquo;s a case of life and death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  with you, dear lady&mdash;certainly with you,&rdquo; said Dr. Pargowker emphatically. &ldquo;Miss  Pelch, will you honour me by seeing me to the door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  want to talk about me behind my back,&rdquo; said Miss Corbin, suspiciously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no  use. I&rsquo;ll make Minnie tell me everything.&rdquo; She darted a threatening look at  that young lady, which made her shake, and then Minnie disappeared through the  door, while the doctor prepared to follow, first giving a parting word to his  refractory patient.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  no use, dear lady,&rdquo; he said, with playful ponderousness, &ldquo;calling in the doctor  if you don&rsquo;t intend to obey him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never obeyed anyone in my life,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, stiffening her back, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m  certainly not going to begin with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dearest  Miss Corbin, I am in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I,&rdquo; retorted the old lady, frowning. &ldquo;There! there! go away, I&rsquo;ll do  everything you tell me, but I must see my nephew to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Pargowker sighed, yielded to stern necessity, and spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you can do so, my dear, old friend, but only for five minutes&mdash;only for five  minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  enough for all I&rsquo;ve got to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor looked waggishly at Miss Corbin, in order to keep up her spirits, but  his face grew very grave as he spoke to Minnie at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must not see anyone,&rdquo; he said emphatically, &ldquo;mind that, Miss Pelch. I was  obliged to say she could speak to Sir Guy Errington for five minutes, as she  grows so excited over being contradicted. If he does come, let her see him for  that time, but don&rsquo;t let her grow excited. I&rsquo;ll call in again to-night, to see  how she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she very ill?&rdquo; asked Minnie in dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  ill,&rdquo; said Pargowker, putting on his hat, &ldquo;that if she&rsquo;s not kept absolutely  quiet, she won&rsquo;t recover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Miss Pelch in an alarmed tone, and would have asked more questions, only  Dr. Pargowker was already in his brougham, on his way to another patient.</p>
  <p>Minnie  returned to the drawing-room, with a cheerful face, so as not to let Miss Corbin  see her feelings, but that indomitable lady was determined to have the truth,  and tackled her at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what did he say?&rdquo; she demanded, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  that you were to keep yourself quiet, dear Miss Jelly,&rdquo; replied Minnie, taking  up her work, a green parrot being embroidered on a red tree, against a yellow  ground and a purple sky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Minnie,  you are deceiving me,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly solemnly. &ldquo;I can see it in your face. Do  you think it&rsquo;s right to deceive a dying person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not dying,&rdquo; whimpered Minnie, beginning to cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not far off it, at all events,&rdquo; retorted Miss Corbin, with a sigh. &ldquo;I know my  own constitution quite as well as that fool of a doctor, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I  won&rsquo;t get well this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but you will&mdash;you will,&rdquo; cried Minnie, weeping.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  nonsense, child,&rdquo; said Miss Corbin, kindly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t waste your tears over an old  woman like me. I&rsquo;ve had a long life, but by no means a happy one. Quantity not  quality, I suppose. If I can only see Victoria engaged to that nice Macjean  boy, and persuade my nephew out of his folly, I&rsquo;ll not be sorry to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Pargowker said you were not to see Sir Guy longer than five minutes, Miss  Jelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  long enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  were not to excite yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  there, Minnie!&rdquo; said Miss Jelly, impatiently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take good care of myself,  you may be sure. What time did Sir Guy say he would be here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four  o&rsquo;clock, dear Miss Corbin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  nearly that now,&rdquo; observed Aunt Jelly, looking at the clock. &ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t  keep me waiting. Young men are so careless now-a-days. Miss Sheldon has gone  out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  to the Academy with Mrs. Trubbles and Mr. Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  of whom know anything about pictures. It means flirting, not art, I&rsquo;ve no  doubt. Well! well, we must not be too hard on the young. Let me leave the world  in peace, that&rsquo;s all I ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minnie  put down her work, and came close to Miss Corbin, whose thin cold hand she took  in her own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  Miss Jelly, don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;indeed you will get well,  I&rsquo;m sure you will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  child, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but, yes,&rdquo; persisted her companion, fondly. &ldquo;Why, whatever would I do, if you  did not live to read my little volume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s coming out, then?&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, grimly, with a flash of her old  spirit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Gartney has arranged it all. I was going to keep it a secret, but when you  talk about dying, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and poor Minnie fairly broke down, which touched  Aunt Jelly more than she liked to acknowledge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!  there!&rdquo; she said, touching Minnie&rsquo;s face, with unaccustomed tenderness, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re  a good child, Minnie. Tell me all about this poetry book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  going to be called &lsquo;Heart Throbs and Sad Sobs, by Minnie Pelch,&rsquo; &rdquo; said the  poetess, radiantly, &ldquo; &lsquo;dedicated to Miss Angelica Corbin, by her sincere friend,  the Authoress.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly was silent for a few minutes, feeling, rather a choking in her throat.  She had laughed at poor Minnie&rsquo;s simple rhymes on many occasions, and now the  poetess had returned good for evil, paying her the high compliment of  inscribing her name on the front of the book. Minnie mistook her silence for  indignation at not having asked permission, and tried to pacify the old lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you&rsquo;re not angry,&rdquo; she said, timidly smoothing Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;but I  wanted to surprise you by the dedication. There&rsquo;s a poem about you too, Miss  Jelly, and I think it&rsquo;s the best in the book&mdash;really the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old lady was so touched by Minnie&rsquo;s poor little attempt to propitiate her, that  she could not trust herself to speak, and when she did there were tears rolling  down her hard old face, as she bent down and kissed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very good of you, child,&rdquo; she said, in a tremulous voice, &ldquo;and I feel very much  honoured, indeed. Perhaps I&rsquo;ve not been so kind to you as I ought to have been.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but you have!&mdash;you have!&rdquo; cried Minnie, throwing herself on her knees, with  tears in her eyes. &ldquo;If it had not been for you, I would have starved, dear Miss  Jelly. Indeed, I would. It is so hard to get paid for poetry. And you have been  such a kind, good friend&mdash;such a kind good friend!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I have spoken harshly to you, dear, on occasions,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, brokenly, &ldquo;it  was from no want of feeling. Age, my dear Minnie, age, and an embittered  nature. But the heart was there, my dear, all the time the heart was there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it was!&mdash;I know it was!&rdquo; wept Minnie, patting the withered hand of her old  friend. &ldquo;I have never doubted that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  yes!&rdquo; muttered the old dame dreamily, &ldquo;the heart was there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  there was silence for a few minutes, only broken by the sobs of Minnie, then  Aunt Jelly recovered her usual manner with an effort, and ordered wine and cake  to be placed on the table. Miss Pelch had barely time to do this, when there  came a ring at the front door, and shortly afterwards Sir Guy Errington entered  the room. Aunt Jelly, now quite her own grim self, received her nephew coldly,  and then sent Minnie out of the room, as she wanted to talk to Sir Guy in  private. Miss Pelch, however, mindful of the doctor&rsquo;s order, did not go far,  but waited in the hall, so as to be ready to enter when the five minutes had  expired.</p>
  <p>Guy  looked rather haggard about the face, as he sat down near his elderly relation,  which Aunt Jelly put down to fast living, although, in reality, it was due to  worrying about his wife. This idea did not make her feel very tenderly towards  Errington, and she prepared herself to do battle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you&rsquo;ve come at last?&rdquo; she said, straightening her back, and folding her hands  on her knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came as soon as you sent for me,&rdquo; answered Guy, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should have come without an invitation,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, with a frown, &ldquo;but  young men of the present day seem to take a delight in neglecting those nearest  and dearest to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was said pointedly, with a view to drawing forth some remark about Alizon, but  Guy did not take it in that sense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to neglect you, aunt,&rdquo; he said moodily, &ldquo;but our conversations are  not so pleasant that I should look forward to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only speak for your good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;People  always do that when they make disagreeable remarks,&rdquo; replied Errington  sarcastically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not looking well to-day, Aunt Jelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t feel well either,&rdquo; responded his aunt shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said Guy, heartily shocked at her remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I will say it,&rdquo; retorted Miss Corbin, nodding her head vigorously, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll  say something else too that you won&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt you will,&rdquo; answered Guy crossly, rising to his feet. &ldquo;Look here, Aunt  Jelly, you&rsquo;re not well to-day, and if you brought me here to quarrel, I&rsquo;m not  fit for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  fit for nothing in my opinion except the Divorce Court,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly  viciously. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you mean by talking about the Divorce Court,&rdquo; answered  Errington calmly, obeying her command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think  and see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the good of my doing that?&rdquo; cried Errington angrily, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you  mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  shriek,&rdquo; said Miss Corbin coolly, &ldquo;it goes through my head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon aunt,&rdquo; replied Guy politely, &ldquo;but if you would tell me what you&rsquo;re  driving at I would feel obliged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly sat in silence for a moment, rapping the fingers of one hand on the  knuckles of the other, then spoke out sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  all this talk about you and Mrs. Veilsturm?&rdquo; Guy sat bolt upright in his chair  and stared at her in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  is that it?&rdquo; he said with a short laugh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry your head about Mrs.  Veilsturm, aunt. All the world can know the relations that exist between us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the world does know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Errington  arose from his seat with a smothered ejaculation, and thrusting his hands into  his pockets, began to walk backwards and forwards.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t use bad language, my dear Guy,&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly, with aggravating  placidity. &ldquo;All I want to know is what you mean by leaving your wife and  running after Mrs. Veilsturm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not running after Mrs. Veilsturm,&rdquo; said her nephew angrily, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve not left  my wife. I&rsquo;m simply up in Town for a spell, and have called once or twice to  see a very pleasant woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very pleasant woman, indeed,&rdquo; sneered Aunt Jelly scornfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you think so badly of her, I wonder you let your ward go near her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know anything against the woman&rsquo;s character,&rdquo; replied Miss Corbin, &ldquo;so  there&rsquo;s no reason I should keep Victoria away. I daresay she&rsquo;s as bad as the  rest of them, and conceals it better. But that&rsquo;s nothing to do with my  question. It has come to my ears that you are paying marked attentions to Mrs.  Veilsturm, and I want to know if it is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it is not true?&rdquo; answered Errington slowly. &ldquo;I have been a great deal with Mrs.  Veilsturm since I came up to Town, but that was simply because she asked me to  visit her, and without being absolutely rude, I could not refuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very nice explanation,&rdquo; said his aunt disbelievingly, &ldquo;but do you think it is  one your wife will accept?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  wife knows nothing about my visits to Mrs. Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  she does,&rdquo; replied Aunt Jelly coolly. &ldquo;I wrote and told her all about them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy&rsquo;s  face grew as pale as that of a corpse, and he stared at Miss Corbin as if he  had been turned into stone. At length, with an effort, he arose to his feet and  repeated her answer in a harsh, strained voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wrote and told her all about them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I did not think your conduct was right, so, as your wife has most influence  with you, I wrote and told her to call you back to Ellington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  the blood in his body seemed to surge up into his head with the violent effort  he made to suppress his anger. Had it been any one else but this feeble old  woman, he would have simply let his passion master him, but in this case, with  such an adversary he could do nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  forgive you, Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve done a cruel thing,&rdquo; and  he turned and walked slowly to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have done what was right,&rdquo; said Miss Corbin bravely. &ldquo;You were deceiving your  wife, and I was determined she should know of your deception.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir  Guy turned towards her as he paused at the door, and when she finished  speaking, answered her slowly and deliberately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are quite wrong. I was not deceiving my wife, as I can prove to you. As you  know, my wife has treated me very cruelly during the last year, and neglected  me in every way, giving all her love to the child. Eustace came down the other  day, and advised me to leave my wife for a few weeks, thinking she would not be  so indifferent on my return. I took his advice and came up to Town. Eustace  took me to Mrs. Veilsturm, and finding her a very pleasant woman, I simply went  there in order to amuse myself. But as for caring about her, I love and respect  my wife and my name too much to degrade myself so far. Unluckily, until the  other day, I did not remember that Alizon disliked Mrs. Veilsturm, because she  was mixed up with her father in some way, and forbade her to visit at the Hall.  Had I remembered this, I would not have gone there, but it&rsquo;s too late now to  think of it. By believing all these malicious stories, which I give you my word  of honour have no foundation, and writing to her, she will believe that I went  to see this woman on purpose, and she will never forgive me. I am going down to  the Hall by to-night&rsquo;s train, and will try and explain everything to her, but I&rsquo;m  afraid she will not believe me. No doubt you acted for the best, Aunt Jelly,  but in doing so you have simply ruined my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guy!  Guy!&rdquo; moaned the old woman, who had listened to all this with a sense of  stunned amazement. &ldquo;Forgive me! I did it for the best, but I will write again  and tell her how wrong I have been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too late,&rdquo; he replied sadly, &ldquo;too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it&rsquo;s not too late, Guy. But forgive me! forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Errington  looked at her coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  my wife forgives me I will forgive you,&rdquo; he answered, and left the room.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly stared at the closed door, and strove to call him back, but her voice  died in her throat, a mist came before her eyes, and overwhelmed by the fatal  discovery she had made, and the excitement she had undergone, she fell back in  a dead faint.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
    The Deity Called Fate</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Believe  me, sir, the deity called Fate,<br>
    Is stronger than the strongest of us all,<br>
    Fate! Fortune! Destiny! what name you will!<br>
    We are the sport of some malignant power,<br>
    Who twists and turns the actions of our lives,<br>
    In such strange fashion that our best intents<br>
  &mdash;Not evil in themselves&mdash;breed evil things,<br>
    And wreck our fairest ventures, tho&rsquo; we strive<br>
    To bring them holily to some quiet port.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  leaving Miss Corbin&rsquo;s house Errington&rsquo;s first impulse was to drive straight to  the railway station, catch the six-thirty train, and go down to the Hall at  once, in order to explain matters to his wife. A moment&rsquo;s reflection, however,  convinced him that this would be a foolish thing to do, as he could not  possibly reach home before eight o&rsquo;clock, and his late arrival at such an hour  without being expected would be sure to cause comment among the servants. They  already guessed more of the strained relations between himself and his wife  than he liked, so in order to avoid the slightest chance of any further remark  being made, he determined to go down to Denfield next day in the ordinary  course of things.</p>
  <p>He  therefore drove back to his hotel, and while dressing for dinner pondered  deeply as to the best course to pursue with Alizon. On this night he was  engaged to dine with Macjean at the Soudan Hotel, and recollected that his  cousin was to be of the party. Eustace was a man in whom he had a profound belief,  and frequently deferred to his cousin&rsquo;s judgment in delicate matters, so on  this present occasion he made up his mind to speak to Gartney, whose clear head  would doubtless be able to solve the problem.</p>
  <p>It  was true that Mrs. Veilsturm expected him to call for her at the Marlowe  Theatre, where she had a box. But the idea of being in her company again after  what had transpired was too much for him, so he hastily scribbled a note  excusing himself on the plea of sudden indisposition, and sent it off to Park  Lane by a special messenger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Macjean  and Laxton can go to the theatre as arranged,&rdquo; he thought, as he went slowly  down the stairs, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll make Eustace take me to his rooms, where we can talk  over things at our ease.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this determination he jumped into a hansom and drove off to the Soudan Hotel in  Piccadilly, where he found Otterburn waiting for him in company with Laxton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  Gartney?&rdquo; asked the Master after greeting his friend, &ldquo;he promised to be early.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eustace&rsquo;s  promises are like pie crust,&rdquo; replied Errington, giving his cloak and hat to  the waiter, &ldquo;made to be broken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look very broken yourself,&rdquo; remarked Macjean meditatively, as the gaslight fell  on Guy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What is the matter? Have you had bad news? Will you have a  glass of sherry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  is the matter,&rdquo; replied the baronet categorically. &ldquo;I have not had bad news,  and I will take a glass of sherry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  really felt very worried over the position in which he now found himself  regarding his wife, but it was better he should dine in company than alone, as  a solitary meal would only make matters appear much worse than they really  were. Besides he was going to consult Eustace, who, he felt certain, would  advise him for the best, so he put the best face he could on the matter, and chatted  gaily over his sherry to the two young men while waiting for his cousin.</p>
  <p>Presently  Eustace, cool, calm and unconcerned, arrived, with a large appetite and an  apology for being late.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got a man who is in the habit of mislaying things,&rdquo; he explained as they all  sat down to dinner, &ldquo;he mislaid his brains when he was born, and hasn&rsquo;t found  them yet, so I suffer in consequence. No sherry for me, thank you! Water,  please!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh,  London water,&rdquo; groaned Laxton, holding up his sherry to the light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Water,&rdquo;  remarked Mr. Gartney sententiously, &ldquo;is the purest of all elements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in town,&rdquo; retorted Macjean with a grimace. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in Adam&rsquo;s wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  Scotchman ever did as far as I know,&rdquo; said Eustace drily. &ldquo;Presbyterian wine is  what you all prefer north of the Tweed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a very good idea too,&rdquo; observed Guy, contributing his quota to the  conversation, &ldquo;especially on wet days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  why such a lot of whisky is consumed in the Land o&rsquo; Cakes,&rdquo; explained Eustace  gravely, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always wet up there. Scotch mist and Scotch whisky invariably go  together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo;  remarked Laxton, alluding to the conversation, &ldquo;is not a teetotol meeting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one could possibly accuse it of being that,&rdquo; retorted Gartney, with a  significant glance at the full glasses, &ldquo;but if you three gentlemen don&rsquo;t mind  talking, I&rsquo;ll eat in the meantime. The Soudan cook is a good one, the Gartney  appetite is a large one, so thank God for all His mercies and leave me to pay  attention to the good things of this life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  three friends laughed at his humorous way of putting things, and devoted  themselves to the fish. The conversation went on in a more or less frivolous  fashion, the last scandal, the blunders of the Cabinet, the new novel of the  realistic school, the prospects of a war in the East&mdash;all these were discussed  in their turn by the quartette, and then Laxton began to argue with Otterburn  about the African expedition, so seizing the opportunity Guy bent forward to  speak to Eustace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to talk to you after dinner,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  replied Gartney carelessly, &ldquo;but will you have time? What about the theatre?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  changed my mind,&rdquo; said Guy quickly, &ldquo;so I sent an excuse to Mrs. Veilsturm.  Have you anything particular to do? If not we can go to your rooms. I won&rsquo;t  detain you long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  flashed a keen look on his cousin, and paused a moment before replying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was going to look in at one or two drawing-rooms to-night,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;but  as my engagements really aren&rsquo;t very particular, I&rsquo;ll not trouble about them,  so I will be at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; answered Guy, drawing a long breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  wrong, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  that is as it turns out. I saw Aunt Jelly to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Eustace in a significant tone, knowing that an interview with Aunt Jelly  always meant trouble of some sort. &ldquo;I think I can understand. However, let us  go on with our meal. Pleasure and appetite first, business and Aunt Jelly  afterwards. What are those two boys fighting about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two boys were still engaged in the African argument, and had arrived at a dead  lock, each being firmly convinced in his own mind that his view of the subject  was the right one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  all wrong, I tell you,&rdquo; said Otterburn hotly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re talking just like you did  at Montana. Africa isn&rsquo;t America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  said it was,&rdquo; returned Laxton ungracefully, &ldquo;but I daresay the sport is very  much the same in both places. Africa is not a new planet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might as well say that potting walrus in the Arctic regions is the same as  jungle shooting in India.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  merely a matter of temperature,&rdquo; declared Laxton decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you pin your faith to the thermometer, I&rsquo;ve nothing more to say,&rdquo; replied  Otterburn, throwing himself back in his chair with the air of a man who has  crushed his opponent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t the least idea what you are talking about,&rdquo; observed Eustace leisurely,  &ldquo;and judging from what I&rsquo;ve overheard you both seem to be in the same  predicament.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  discuss it later on,&rdquo; said Otterburn gaily. &ldquo;What a pity I can&rsquo;t come out with  you to Africa, Laxton, and settle the argument that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  why don&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo; demanded Laxton quickly.</p>
  <p>Otterburn  reddened and laughed in an embarrassed fashion, while Eustace threw a roguish  glance at him, and made answer for the bashful lover.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you bother your head, Laxton There are more important things than shooting  expeditions in this world&mdash;at least, Otterburn thinks so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laxton  was quite in the dark regarding the meaning of these mystic utterances, when it  suddenly dawned on him that the lady whom Otterburn had spoken about in America  might have something to do with the turn the conversation had taken, and lifted  his glass with a smile as he looked towards Macjean.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the health of the something more important than shooting expeditions,&rdquo; he said  gravely, and finished the wine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; responded Otterburn laughing. &ldquo;May I some day drink the same health to  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never&rsquo;s  a long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  talking about time,&rdquo; remarked Guy, glancing at his watch, &ldquo;if you two boys have  any idea of the theatre to-night you&rsquo;ll have to be off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t  you coming too?&rdquo; chorussed Otterburn and his comrade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I received an important piece of news to-night, about which I wish to speak to  my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will Mrs. V. say?&rdquo; asked Laxton gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  can foretell a woman&rsquo;s remarks?&rdquo; said Eustace quizzically, seeing that Guy was  disinclined to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Depends  upon how much you know of the woman,&rdquo; responded Otterburn smartly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo;  retorted the cynic, &ldquo;is an unknown quantity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about quality?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  conversation,&rdquo; said Eustace, looking at his glass of water, &ldquo;is getting  problematic. After dinner is a bad time to solve puzzles, therefore&mdash;coffee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  seemed a good suggestion, so they all adjourned to the smoking-room, and  indulged in further conversation while they enjoyed their coffee and  cigarettes. Shortly afterwards Otterburn and his friend departed for the  Marlowe Theatre, while Eustace in company with Guy went off to his rooms in  Half Moon Street, Piccadilly.</p>
  <p>Used  as he was to hardships in foreign lands, Eustace always took care to make up  for his deprivations by making himself very comfortable at home, consequently  his rooms left nothing to be desired in the way of luxury. His valet was well  accustomed to his master coming in at all kinds of unexpected times, consequently  when they arrived the room was well lighted, the chairs disposed in tempting  corners, and a spirit-stand with glasses and soda-water stood ready for any  thirsty soul.</p>
  <p>Eustace  placed his cousin in a well-cushioned chair, gave him an excellent cigar, then,  lighting one himself, took his seat opposite to Guy and prepared to play the  part of father confessor.</p>
  <p>It  was a hot night and the windows were standing slightly open, letting in the  pleasant, confused noise of the street, with its rattling of cabs, voices of  people, and footfalls of innumerable pedestrians. The faint sound of a barrel  organ playing the last new tune, &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s left me for another,&rdquo; came softly  to their ears, and they sat smoking silently for a few moments until Errington  spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told you I saw Aunt Jelly to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  and what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  good many disagreeable things,&rdquo; replied Guy bitterly; &ldquo;according to her  showing, I must be a singularly wicked man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt  Jelly,&rdquo; observed Eustace philosophically, &ldquo;knows very little about the actual  world, and having lived apart from her fellow creatures for many years, has  formed in her own mind an ideal life to which she expects all her friends and  relations to conform. Unfortunately, the majority of nineteenth century people  are neither Lucreces nor Bayards, consequently Aunt Jelly, in Pharisee fashion,  rails at the world and says, &lsquo;Thank God, I&rsquo;m not as other women are.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is as other women are in the matter of listening to gossip,&rdquo; said Guy  emphatically, &ldquo;for she tells me it is common talk that I have left my wife for  the superior attractions of Mrs. Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  looked up suddenly in dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow, you must be making a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  making no mistake,&rdquo; returned Guy doggedly. &ldquo;Aunt Jelly says it is common talk. Have  you heard anything about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know I never pay attention to gossip,&rdquo; said Gartney evasively, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even  listen to it, but you may be certain that anyone who poses as the <i>cher ami</i> of Mrs. Veilsturm won&rsquo;t escape calumny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t pose as the <i>cher ami</i> of Mrs. Veilsturm,&rdquo; said Errington fiercely. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care two straws about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Actions  speak louder than words. You certainly have acted as if you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Heavens, Eustace, you surely don&rsquo;t believe all these lies?&rdquo; retorted Guy  wrathfully, rising from his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said I did,&rdquo; answered his cousin coolly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m looking at it now from  the world&rsquo;s point of view. Mrs. Veilsturm has certainly made a dead set at you,  and you, thinking it was natural amiability, have played into her hands. You,  no doubt, call it friendship, but the world doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is friendship. Indeed, hardly that as far as I am concerned, as I don&rsquo;t care if  I never saw Mrs. Veilsturm again. She has taken an unaccountable fancy to me,  and I&rsquo;m no Joseph where a pretty woman is concerned, but as for leaving my dear  wife for a meretricious woman like that&mdash;Good God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let the world talk as it likes, so long as it isn&rsquo;t speaking the truth,&rdquo; said  Eustace impatiently. &ldquo;Who cares? If you expect justice from your fellow creatures,  you won&rsquo;t get it. As to Aunt Jelly, old women are privileged gossips. It don&rsquo;t  matter to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it does matter to me, I tell you,&rdquo; cried Guy violently, walking to and fro, &ldquo;she  has written all about these lies to my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  barrel organ outside was still grinding out the popular tune, being now  assisted by the shrill voice of a girl singing the words of the song.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Oh,  she&rsquo;s left me for another,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary  Anne! Mary Anne!<br>
  And  she said he was her brother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary  Anne.<br>
  It  may be true, for all I know,<br>
    But would she kiss her brother so,<br>
  And would she leave me for him? No!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary  Anne, Mary Anne!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  regular beat of the melody seemed to repeat itself everlastingly in Gartney&rsquo;s  ears as he sat there in silence wondering over the statement Errington had made.  If Alizon knew all, she would never forgive her husband and then&mdash;was it Fate  that so persistently smoothed the road for his evil doing? He felt dull and  stupid at the unexpected announcement he had heard, and, after a pause, lifted  his heavy eyes to Guy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he said drearily, &ldquo;and what do you intend to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Errington  sat down heavily in his chair and stretched out his hands with a weary gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; he answered in a dull voice. &ldquo;I suppose the best thing  will be for me to go down and explain matters to Alizon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  will she accept your explanation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why make it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  drowning man will grasp at a straw. I must do something! I can&rsquo;t let my wife  think I have wilfully wronged her. Good heavens! surely she must know I love  her dearly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think it is very probable she does,&rdquo; answered Eustace slowly, &ldquo;besides,  I think Lady Errington is too sensible a woman to give ear to lying reports.  Tell her all you have told me, and I&rsquo;m certain you will have no difficulty in  making your peace with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think so?&rdquo; asked Guy, his sad face brightening, &ldquo;but no, I&rsquo;m afraid not.  You remember the story I told you about Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s card being returned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the difficulty. If it had been any other woman than Mrs. Veilsturm&mdash;but as it  is, she&rsquo;ll think I did it wilfully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow, you&rsquo;ve never loved a statue,&rdquo; said Errington bitterly, rising to  his feet and putting on his cloak, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no use talking any more. Aunt  Jelly has done more harm than she knows of. I&rsquo;ll go down to the Hall to-morrow,  and tell Alizon everything. If she believes my explanation, well and good, if  she does not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  asked Eustace, seeing his cousin hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  repeated the other harshly, &ldquo;I shall come back to London and Mrs. Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was gone before Eustace could offer a word of remonstrance on the folly of such  a determination, and then Gartney returned to his seat with an air of utter  lassitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kismet,&rdquo;  he said to himself, after a long pause. &ldquo;It is Destiny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  it indeed Destiny that had interfered for the third time? Was it fixed by Fate  that he should be Lady Errington&rsquo;s lover, and lose his honourable name for her  sake? It seemed like it, seeing that all barriers he had set up against this  illicit love, were swept away by the actions of other people, and the field  left open to him. Still, Alison had not yet had her interview with Guy, and, as  she must know how much he loved her, surely she would accept his explanation of  the lying reports concerning his infatuation for Mrs. Veilsturm.</p>
  <p>If  she did so, all would be well with them both, but if she refused to believe his  story, and dismissed him coldly, then&mdash;</p>
  <p>Eustace  arose to his feet, and walking over to the window, looked out into the hot  night. Below, the glare and glitter of gas-lamps&mdash;above, the luminous light of  the stars&mdash;and far in the east, rising over the sombre masses of clouds, burned  an evil planet, which was dreaded of old by the Chaldeans.</p>
  <p>The  man looking at it with troubled eyes felt the twin powers of good and evil  strive in his heart.</p>
  <p>And  the star gleamed steadily in the thunderous sky.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
    Husband And Wife</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;You  have broken your oath<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And broken my heart,<br>
    Oh, sorrow for both,<br>
    You have broken your oath;<br>
    Although I am loth<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anger to part,<br>
    You have broken your oath<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And broken my heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alizon  Errington was seated in the Dutch room with Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s letter clenched in her  hand, and Sammy playing on the carpet beside her. The child, rolling among his  toys was babbling inarticulate words of endearment to them, but the mother&rsquo;s  eyes were fixed on the gaudy bed of tulips blazing in the sunshine as she  thought over the words she had just read.</p>
  <p>So  this was her husband! This man who had gone straight from his home, from his  wife, from his child, to the arms of this infamous woman. He knew more than the  world did about the character of Mrs. Veilsturm, for she had told him herself.  He knew that she, his wife, had refused to receive this adventuress and had  returned her card! He knew that Mrs. Veilsturm, Cleopatra, whatever she liked  to call herself, had been connected with disreputable Gabriel Mostyn, and yet,  in spite of all this, he had dared to enter her house, to clasp hands with her  as a friend, to sacrifice his honour and that of his wife to this vile woman.</p>
  <p>Was  there any faith or honesty in man?</p>
  <p>Her  father had been bad and vicious all his life; he had destroyed his daughter&rsquo;s  belief in the male sex by the terrible revelations of his death-bed, but her  husband&mdash;oh!&mdash;she had thought him better than this: she had respected and admired  him, she had been a good wife, holding her head high and keeping her honour  spotless. She was a good mother to his child, and she had done her best in all  ways to fulfil the vows made at the marriage altar.</p>
  <p>This  was her reward! She was deserted for another woman, for a woman who was the  vilest of her sex. Her wifely honour had been dragged in the mud, her wifely  name had been placed with jeers in the mouths of men and women, and the  marriage tie, so sacred in her eyes, had been violated by her husband, by the  very man who should have respected its sanctity.</p>
  <p>Her  first born was playing at her feet in the happy innocence of childhood, a pure  soul fresh from the hand of God, who had given her this treasure to nurse and  cherish. Yet even now, in its artless babyhood, the shadow of a dark shame was  hovering over its golden head, the name it bore was already smirched in the  eyes of the world, and its father, who was responsible to God for its  well-being, had already degraded it by his own shameful passion.</p>
  <p>Ah!  all men were the same. Her father was only the type of many others. They loved  a woman, or said they loved her, and stayed beside her for a time, yet as soon  as they grew weary of her, they flew to the arms of some newer fancy, and not  even the sanctity of the marriage tie could restrain their brutal natures. Guy,  whom she thought so good and kind, had turned out the same as his fellow men.  He had been a good husband for a time, but now, grown weary of his quiet home,  satiated with domestic love, weary of his prattling child, he had deliberately  flung himself into the arms of this light-o&rsquo;-love. Well, he would have his  reward. The wages of sin is death! and he would be dragged down to destruction  by those arms that encircled him so fondly.</p>
  <p>But  what about herself? What could she do in order to free herself from the  companionship of this man who prized her less than he did his dissolute  companions? Divorce! Yes, that was the way to break the chain which bound her  to the husband she despised. But it was impossible that she could take  advantage of the law, for it would reflect on the child in the future, and for  the child&rsquo;s sake she would have to remain in the bondage of marriage.</p>
  <p>Tearless,  cold, and pale as a lily, she sat there with her hands clasping the hateful  letter which told her of her husband&rsquo;s treachery and destroyed the happiness of  her life. The child, weary of its toys, crawled across the carpet to her feet,  and clutching her dress raised itself to its feet with a plaintive cry. She  looked downward in dry-eyed misery, saw the wax-like tiny hands clasping her  dress, and heard the thin little voice utter its inarticulate prayer to lie on  her breast.</p>
  <p>The  full horror of her position broke on her dulled brain like a flash of light,  and with a burst of tears she took up the child and strained him convulsively  to her bosom.</p>
  <p>Ah,  how those tears fell&mdash;hot, scalding tears that blistered her cheeks, that burned  into her very soul, and that fell on the frightened face of the baby like rain,  bitter and salt as the waves of the sea. The child was afraid at this  passionate outburst of sorrow and began to cry, but she held him close to her  breast and, restraining her tears, hushed him to slumber with a low lullaby  rocking to and fro, her heart heavy as lead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alizon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a cry she arose to her feet, the sleeping child in her arms, and saw her  husband, travel-stained, worn, and haggard, standing at the door with a look of  imploring agony on his face. She drew herself up to her full height and shrank  against the wall, with one arm stretched out to keep him off, the other holding  the tiny form of the child, and at her feet the crumpled letter that had been  the cause of all this undoing.</p>
  <p>Guy  made a step forward and stretched out his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alizon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t  come near me!&rdquo; she said in a low, hoarse voice, with a look of horror on her  pale face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  come to explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  can explain that,&rdquo; she answered, pointing to the letter on the floor, &ldquo;nothing  can explain that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can explain it, if you will only listen,&rdquo; he said vehemently. The marks of  tears were still on her cheeks, but no other traces of emotion remained to show  how she had suffered.</p>
  <p>As  her husband spoke, a cold, scornful smile crept over her face, and she signed  to him to go on, still shrinking against the wall with her arms folded round  the child as if she would keep it from being contaminated by its father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw Aunt Jelly,&rdquo; said Sir Guy hurriedly, &ldquo;and she told me what she had done.  Written to you about&mdash;about Mrs. Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  brought out the hated name with a great effort, but his wife, neither shrinking  nor wincing, stared straight at him with that terrible frozen smile on her  face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  writes under a mistake,&rdquo; pursued Errington, clasping the back of a chair in his  strong fingers as though he would crush it to dust. &ldquo;It is not true what she  says. I told her all about it and she believed me. I am going to tell you now,  and you will believe me, will you not, Alizon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  words dropped slowly from her mouth, and he flung out his arms towards her with  a cry of anguish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must believe me&mdash;you must, I tell you,&rdquo; he said breathlessly. &ldquo;It is not true  about that woman. I went up to Town with Eustace, and called at her house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  flush of angry red passed over her face, and she turned on him like a tigress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  called on her! You called on that woman!&rdquo; she said in a clear, vibrating voice,  tremulous with anger. &ldquo;The woman about whom I told you&mdash;whom I would not  receive, and you&mdash;you&mdash;my husband, dared to put this insult upon me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alizon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  speak further! I have heard enough. That letter is true, and you cannot deny  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do deny it,&rdquo; he cried fiercely. &ldquo;I tell you it is all a mistake. I forgot all  about your refusal to receive Mrs. Veilsturm. Had I remembered I would not have  gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  she said with ineffable scorn, &ldquo;if you had remembered. What excuse is that to  make? Do my words weigh so lightly with you that you could forget them so  easily? It was not for anything that Mrs. Veilsturm had done to me that I  declined to receive her. But I heard my father, on his death-bed, speak of her&mdash;speak  of her as men such as he was speak of such a woman as she is. I told you this,  and yet you forget my words and visit her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  God is my judge, I did forget,&rdquo; he said desperately. &ldquo;I did not think about it  until it was too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you did remember at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  only it was too late. I had been to her house and she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she,&rdquo; echoed his wife bitterly. &ldquo;Oh, I well know what you are going to say. She  did her best to captivate you with her vile arts, tried her hardest to win your  heart from me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she did not succeed&mdash;she did not succeed,&rdquo; he said earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think I care if she did or if she did not?&rdquo; replied Lady Errington  scornfully. &ldquo;Do you think I would place myself in rivalry with that woman? No!  you have chosen her in preference to me, your lawful wife. Go to her as soon as  you like, but don&rsquo;t dare to come near me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will come near you,&rdquo; said Guy desperately. &ldquo;You have no right to judge me like  this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have the right of a wronged woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! I swear you have not. On my soul; on my honour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  your honour,&rdquo; she interrupted with a sneer, &ldquo;the honour of a man who could act  as you have done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose  fault is it if I have acted badly?&rdquo; he cried, rendered desperate by her jeers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean to infer it&rsquo;s mine?&rdquo; said his wife quietly.</p>
  <p>He  gnawed his moustache viciously and did not respond, whereupon she was about to  ask the question again, when a knock came to the door and startled them both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the child&rsquo;s nurse,&rdquo; said Lady Errington, going to the door. &ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  turned towards the window so that the servant should not see how upset he was,  and Lady Errington, opening the door, kept her face bent over the sleeping  child as she placed it in Mrs. Tasker&rsquo;s arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  sound asleep, Nurse,&rdquo; she said quietly, as the old woman took him. &ldquo;Take him up  to the nursery, and I&rsquo;ll come to him in a short time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  voice was perfectly under control, and Mrs. Tasker never for a moment suspected  anything was wrong between her master and mistress as she toiled slowly up the  stairs carrying the child tenderly in her stout arms.</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington drew a long breath as Mrs. Tasker disappeared, and then, closing the  door quietly, turned once more to her husband, who still stood looking out at  the bright sunshine, which seemed to mock his misery by its glare and cheerful  brilliancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am waiting for your answer,&rdquo; said his wife&rsquo;s steady voice behind him, whereupon  he turned swiftly round, and crossing to where she stood, stern and silent by  the table, caught one of her hands before she could prevent him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alizon,&rdquo;  he said earnestly, &ldquo;for your own sake, for the sake of our child, listen to me  quietly, and I will try and explain things to your satisfaction. I did go to  Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s, but I swear by all that is sacred, that I did not remember  anything about her. Not even her name. Think for a moment, the whole affair  passed in five minutes&mdash;your explanation was a hurried one, and you never  referred to it again. It is eighteen months ago, and since then her name has  never been mentioned between us, so you can hardly wonder that I quite forgot  about the woman. Had I remembered, I would not have gone&mdash;give me at least that  credit. I went innocently enough with Eustace, and Mrs. Veilsturm, I suppose  out of revenge for the slight she received from you, was very attentive to me.  I did not respond to her advances in any way, and saw as little of her as I  could. I was not responsible for the coupling of our names together. You know  how the world talks and magnifies the most innocent things into evidences of  guilt. The scandal reached the ears of my aunt, and she, innocently enough,  wrote that letter to you&mdash;a letter which she now bitterly regrets having sent to  you. When she told me about it, I explained all, and she asked my pardon for  having written the letter. I came down here at once to tell you everything, and  I have now done so. On my honour, Alizon, that is the whole affair. I acted  wrongly in forgetting about Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s past, and I ask your pardon. Let  this misunderstanding cease between us. I love you dearly. I have always loved  you, never so much as now. Do not let our lives be blighted like this. I have  acted wrongly, and I ask your pardon. You in your turn grant it to me, and let  us forget this terrible mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  the time he was pleading, she listened to him without any sign of emotion, her  face looking impassable as a marble mask, but at the conclusion of his speech,  she withdrew her hand from his with a cold smile of disbelief, which showed how  little his tenderness affected her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  explanation would satisfy the world,&rdquo; she said with chilly dignity, &ldquo;but it  does not satisfy me. I cannot believe that you forgot about my refusal to  receive Mrs. Veilsturm. Even if you did forget, that only makes your conduct  worse, for you still went to visit her after you recollected the affair, as you  acknowledge yourself. I have been a good wife to you, I have been a good mother  to your child, and in return you have not even given me the common fidelity of  a husband, which every woman has a right to expect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see it is no use pleading to a cold piece of perfection like you,&rdquo; said Guy,  drawing himself up with dignity. &ldquo;I have stooped to explain this affair, and  you decline to believe me. I can do no more. You are convinced, without the  shadow of a reason, that I am vile, and it is impossible for me to undeceive  you further than I have done. Under these circumstances it is impossible for us  to live together as man and wife. You doubt me, and I resent your doing so,  therefore it will be best for us to at once make some arrangement about our  future lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke calmly enough, but his heart was hot with indignation, that he should  receive such treatment from the woman he loved best on earth. He was innocent,  and he knew himself to be innocent, therefore all his nature rose in revolt  against the unjust attitude taken up by his wife.</p>
  <p>She,  on her side, was also indignant, deeming that his explanation was false from  beginning to end, so she refused to forgive him, or to believe the skilful  tissue of falsehoods he had put forward as a plea for her mercy.</p>
  <p>It  was a case of misunderstanding on both sides, and as the stubborn pride of each  refused to bend, nothing was now left but separation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the sake of the child,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;I am unwilling there should be any  scandal, so it will be best for me to stay down here to look after the boy, and  you can take up your abode in London, or wherever else it pleases you.  Regarding money matters, I presume you will allow me sufficient to live on in a  style befitting the mistress of this place. My life will be devoted to bringing  up the child, yours&mdash;well, I have nothing to do with that, and you are free to  act as you desire. These are the only terms upon which I will consent to pass  over the matter, and I think there is nothing more to be said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly  and deliberately she uttered these cruel words, which fell like ice on his  heart, and showed him how utterly futile it was to hope for any reconcilement  with this pure woman, so pure that she could neither understand nor forgive the  infidelity of which she accused him. All his manhood arose in rebellion against  such treatment, and, mad with anger, he stepped to her side as she turned to leave  the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is more to be said,&rdquo; he cried furiously. &ldquo;I have told you the truth, which you  decline to believe. But if I had conducted myself as you say&mdash;if I had  voluntarily gone to this woman whom you hate, who is to blame, you or I? Have I  not been a good husband to you since our marriage? Have I not striven by every  means in my power to win your heart? and what have I received in return?&mdash;cold  words and frigid smiles. Do you think that I did not feel all this? Yes, I did  feel it, but you, wrapped up in your icy nature, cannot understand my feelings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have treated you with all respect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Respect!  Respect!&rdquo; he reiterated bitterly. &ldquo;I ask for love, you give me respect. I ask  for bread, you offer me a stone. All the feelings of my heart have been crushed  down by your cold superiority, by your chilly self-respect, which forbade you  giving to me those attentions that other men receive from their wives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  dare to talk to me like this,&rdquo; she said angrily, &ldquo;you, who have had no respect  either for me or for your child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  the child,&rdquo; he retorted with a sneering laugh, &ldquo;it was the child that came  between us. You have lavished upon it all the love and affection which is due  to me. Am I not the child&rsquo;s father? Why should you treat me as if I were a  block of marble? In my own house I have been lonely. In my own house I have  been neglected, while you, leaving me to starve, gave all your love to the  child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it a crime for a mother to love her child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it is no crime. I did not say it was. But it is a crime&mdash;worse than a crime&mdash;to  cherish and love the child to the exclusion of the husband and father. The  husband has the first claim on the wife&rsquo;s heart, the child the second.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I am right,&rdquo; he replied vehemently, &ldquo;and if driven forth by neglect, and hungry  for love, I left my home to go to another woman, you reproach me for what is  your own work! But I have not done so. I have been as true to you as you have  been to me. Alizon, let things be as they were before this miserable misunderstanding,  and let there be love and affection between us. I will forgive you all the  neglect I have suffered these eighteen months, if you will overlook my  forgetfulness about Mrs. Veilsturm, and act towards me as a wife should act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forgive me,&rdquo; she said contemptuously, &ldquo;you forgive me? No. It is I who have the  right to do that. I do not forgive you. I never shall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  those your last words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  last words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Errington  looked at her in silence for a moment, and then, without a word, walked towards  the door of the room, at which he paused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have implored and entreated you to be merciful,&rdquo; he said, with terrible  calmness, &ldquo;you have refused to grant what I ask. Now I go back to London, to  Mrs. Veilsturm, the woman you despise so much. You have driven me to this, and  the result of it rests on your own head. You do not love me, you never have  loved me, so I leave you alone in your immaculate purity, to forget the man  whom you have despised and wronged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was gone before she could utter a word, and she was left alone in the room,  alone in the world, with nothing but her child to comfort her in the hour of  need.</p>

    The Question Of Marriage</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;The  sea is cruel, its white waves hide me,<br>
  Lo I am weary and scant of breath,<br>
  Thou to a haven of safety guide me,<br>
  Stretch out thy hand, lest I swoon to death.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Thou  art my God in this hour of peril,<br>
  Yet in thy sight, I am lost and vile,<br>
  All thy love, as the sea is sterile,<br>
  I sink, I perish, beneath thy smile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  are always two sides to a question, especially to the question of marriage.</p>
  <p>One  side is invariably taken by the husband, the other by the wife.</p>
  <p>Both  claim their side to be right, and, as this is an impossibility, one side must  be wrong.</p>
  <p>Which?</p>
  <p>It  is a difficult question to settle, more difficult than the judgment of Solomon,  more difficult than the judgment of Paris, and though the world, represented by  the Law, generally plays the part of arbitrator in conjugal disputes, in this  case it was referred to neither by the husband nor the wife.</p>
  <p>Under  these circumstances it will be as well to argue both sides fairly, and  pronounce a verdict in favour of the strongest.</p>
  <p>A  case for the opinion of Society, unrepresented by any legal tribunal, the  parties concerned conducting their own cases personally.</p>
  <p>On  the part of the wife&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I married Guy Errington, I had no belief whatsoever in the masculine sex, such  scepticism being due to my knowledge of the character of my father, Gabriel  Mostyn. Before his illness I lived in almost conventual seclusion, and from the  reading of books formed an ideal world, which I have since found to be as  unreal as the fantastic visions of Oriental dreamers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  world was based upon a delusive belief in the chivalry of men and the purity of  women, and resembled in its visionary loveliness the Garden of Eden, before Eve  tempted Adam with the fatal fruit. In this unreal world men were always young,  handsome and true-hearted, while the women were beautiful in their forms and  faces, pure in their lives. I dreamed that some day I, an inhabitant of this  beautiful universe, would meet with a lover who would dedicate his life to  mine, and we would go through life side by side in love and purity, until we  exchanged this heaven upon earth for one even fairer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!  these were but the virginal dreams of a girl, unsullied by contact with the  world, and my ideal life was shattered by the vile cynicism of my father, who  took a delight in destroying all my illusions, and in dragging me down from the  light of fancy to the darkness of reality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  evil had been his life, that no one would stay by him in his hour of need, and  I, a young girl, unsophisticated and innocent, was forced to remain beside his  bed. To him I dedicated my youth, my innocence, my womanly feeling, my filial  tenderness, and received as a reward a brutal unveiling of the most horrible  things on earth. When I went to his bedside at the beginning of those four  bitter years I was an innocent girl, when I turned away, leaving him stiff and  stark in his coffin, I was, in knowledge, an accomplished woman of the world. I  believed in no one. I doubted the motives of all. I looked upon my  fellow-creatures as birds of prey who would turn and rend me were I not  dexterous enough to foil them with their own weapons. Is it then to be wondered  at that I dreaded marriage with a man who would doubtless be as evil in his  thoughts and deeds as was my father?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  I been in receipt of a sufficient income to keep me from starving, had I been  able to earn my own living, I would never have married; but under the grudging  hospitality of my relatives, and the iron grip of poverty, the strongest  resolution must give way. I was no heroine to battle with the merciless world  as represented to me by my father, so, in despair, I married Guy Errington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  my surprise and delight, I found him to resemble the ideal inhabitants of my  fanciful world, and honoured and respected him for those qualities which I had  never seen in my father. He was good, kind, loving and tender, all of which  qualities to me, in a man, were like a revelation from God. Still, the  teachings of my father could not be easily eradicated, and I dreaded lest some  chance should rend the veil which hid his real nature and show me the innate  brutality which my father assured me existed in all mankind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,  I was thankful for his kindness, and strove to show by every means in my power  how I reciprocated his love. If he accuses me of coldness, I can offer no  defence. I am not a demonstrative woman, as all my timid outbursts of affection  were ruthlessly crushed by my father, and self-restraint has become a habit  with me. Besides, dreading lest my married happiness should not last, I wore my  coldness as an armour against a possible disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  loved my husband, but the invincible mistrust which my father had inculcated in  my breast isolated me during the earlier portion of our married life, and I was  afraid to let my husband see how much I loved him, lest he took advantage of  such confidence. Still, I wanted something to love, something that I could worship,  could cling to, something that I could trust in fully and that would not  deceive me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  came at last, a pure, little, white soul from the hand of God; and to my child  I gave the whole of the love, the adoration, the passion, which had been pent  up in my breast for so many years for want of some one on whom I could bestow  them without fear of the consequence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  husband hated to see me so fond of the child, for his jealous nature would be  content with nothing but undivided love, and in spite of my desire to make him  happy, I could not leave my child unloved in order to pander to his selfish  passion. He resented my reproval of his folly and withdrew himself from my  society, so that I had no one to love but my child, and, although we lived in  the same house, the poles were not further asunder than we were.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she came between us&mdash;that vile woman whom my father knew in South America&mdash;and my  husband, weary of his home, of his wife, of his child, left all to go to her.  What wife could put up with such an insult? Had it been any other woman, it  would have been bad enough, but this special woman whom he knew I despised,  whom he knew from my lips to be an infamous creature, this was the woman for  whom he forsook me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I believe his explanations? They are all false, glibly as they are uttered.  No! I am deceived no longer, he is the same as my father, and seeks only the  selfish gratification of his own appetites. The end has come, as I knew it  would&mdash;the mask is torn off, and I see my husband, whom I loved and trusted  during the early days of our marriage, as he really is. My father was right;  there is no faith, honour, honesty, nor truth, in men; and I have only acted  rightly in refusing to live with a man who could behave so to his wife and  child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  now he is with that woman, on the feeble plea that my coldness drove him away.  Does that excuse his vice? No! He should have waited until perfect love,  perfect understanding, was established between us, but now we are parted for  ever. He has gone back to the life most congenial to him, and I&mdash;I, like many  other women, can do nothing but pray that my son may not grow up to follow in  the evil footsteps of his father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  the part of the husband&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saints  do not live among men, except in the canonization of the Church, and before my  marriage I was neither better nor worse than any other young man. But without  being either a Saint Anthony or a Saint Francis, I did my best to lead a decent  life in every way, and if I had a few vices&mdash;or what ascetics term vices&mdash;they were  so small that they were invisible except to the microscope of certain Pharisees  who pass their lives in finding out their neighbours&rsquo; faults, and thanking God  they are not as other men are.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  loved my wife from the first moment I saw her, being in the first place  attracted by the beauty of her person, and in the second by the difference in  her nature to that of other women. I do not put myself forward either as a deep  thinker or as a student of humanity, but must confess I grew weary of the  ordinary Society woman, married or unmarried. They talked in a frivolous  fashion of the most trivial things, but Alizon Mostyn attracted me by the charm  of her conversation, not that she was very learned, or particularly brilliant,  but she talked of ordinary matters in an original way, which was wonderfully  fascinating. I loved her dearly, and saw in this pale, quiet girl, one who  would be a companion to me, who would make me a better man, and aid me to lead  my life on a higher plane to that which I had hitherto done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was for this reason I married her, and though she was cold in her manner  towards me, this very coldness had a certain charm about it which I could not  resist. I knew that she had been badly treated by her father, so strove in  every way by tenderness and love to make amends for the misery of her early  life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  marriage I was perfectly satisfied with my wife, and although at times her  persistent coldness wounded me, yet I thought by unfailing love and attention  to make her open her heart to me. No doubt I would have achieved this object if  it had not been for the birth of the child, which has, in a great measure, been  the cause of all the trouble of our later married life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was glad to welcome the child, as I thought it would form a new link between  us, and by thawing her frigid disposition draw us closer together. But, instead  of doing this, the boy was the cause of our estrangement, as she lavished upon  him all the love of which her nature was capable, and I was persistently  neglected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt the world would think I had little to complain of&mdash;my wife was perfect,  both in her conjugal and maternal capacity&mdash;the only trouble being the  cherishing of the child to the neglect of the father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  look at the matter from my point of view. I had married my wife for  companionship, for the sake of satisfying the craving of human nature to be  loved, and instead of my ideas being realized, I found myself shut out of  Paradise, while my wife, with her child, rested happily within. She was never  away from the boy, and day after day I was forced to live a lonely life,  neglected and uncared for by a woman I adored. All her ideas, conversation, and  desires, were bound up in the child, so that she had neither the time nor  inclination to take an interest in my pursuits, or in my life. We dwelt  together as man and wife, to all appearances we were a happy and attached  couple, yet the child stood between us, like an evil shadow, which isolated us  the one from the other. Often I tried to break down this barrier, by praising  the child, but the mother seemed jealous even of the father; she wanted the  child all to herself, and, secure in such possession, was contented to treat  her husband as an ordinary friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  resented this state of things, I revolted at being condemned to occupy such an  isolated position, but I could do nothing. My wife was perfect in every other  way, and to have complained would have been ridiculous, so I was forced to  suffer in silence. God alone knows how I did suffer in the solitude to which I  was condemned, at seeing the love and caresses bestowed on the child, love and  caresses in which I had no share. All her life was in the child, and she  possessed him. My life was in her&mdash;and I was a stranger to her in every way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under  the circumstances I thought it best to go away for a few weeks, thinking that  she would miss me in some little measure, and would be more affectionate and  tender when I returned. Whether such an idea was right or wrong I do not know,  I never shall know, for between our parting and our meeting occurred the  episode of Mrs. Veilsturm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  my honour, I went innocently enough into the presence of this woman. I had  forgotten all about my wife&rsquo;s refusal to receive her, for had I remembered I  certainly would not have gone. But, as I said before, I had forgotten. I had  never seen the woman; I did not even know her name. How then was I to recollect  the episode of eighteen months before?&mdash;an episode the memory of which had not  lasted longer than a few days.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s &lsquo;At home.&rsquo; I found her a charming woman, and, at her  express invitation, I went often to her house. She was different from the  ordinary run of women, and I took pleasure in her society, but there was no  warmer feeling between us, at least, not on my part. With the scandal of the  world I have nothing to do, sin and purity are treated the same way, and the  mere fact of my being once or twice seen with Mrs. Veilsturm was sufficient to  set afloat the lying story which came to my wife&rsquo;s ears through the medium of  Aunt Jelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  my wife I told the whole story, but she refused to believe me. I confessed that  I had remembered about Mrs. Veilsturm when it was too late, but she accused me  of knowing the truth from the first, and of having wilfully acted as I had  done. Nothing I could say could shake her belief in this matter, and she swore  she would never forgive me for the insult I had placed upon her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  could I do? Nothing! except retire from the scene. In vain I assured her of my  complete innocence. She refused to believe my statement, and drove me from her  presence&mdash;from my home&mdash;with cruel words. This woman, wrapped up in an armour of  purity&mdash;of selfish purity&mdash;could not credit my innocence in any way. She judged  me from the &lsquo;I-would-not-have-acted-thus&rsquo; standpoint, and insisted that I had  betrayed her basely, although she had no further proof than the gossip of the  world.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  left her. I came back to London to see Mrs. Veilsturm again. It is wrong&mdash;I know  it is wrong&mdash;but what am I to do? Live an isolated existence, pass days and  nights of abject misery, only to pander to her self-righteous ideas? For  eighteen months, in spite of all my tenderness and love, she has wilfully  neglected me, she has refused to acknowledge that I have been a good husband,  she has rendered my life miserable, and now she has driven me forth from my own  home on account of a sin&mdash;if it can be called so&mdash;of which I am guiltless.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  am I to do? Live the life of a hermit in order to right myself in her eyes and  be called back and pardoned, as if I were indeed guilty? No! I will not do so.  It is her fault, not mine, that I am placed in such a miserable position.  Unable to win her by tenderness, by love, I will henceforth live my own life  and see what neglect will do. For every pang she has inflicted upon me I will  inflict a pang upon her, for her months of neglect I will repay her in full,  for her coldness I will give coldness in my turn, and to any remonstrances she  may offer I will say then what I say now&mdash;&rsquo;It is your work.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So  far the cases of husband and wife, each arguing from their own point of view.  Now which of them is right, the man or the woman? The husband who strove to win  his wife&rsquo;s love, or the wife who refused to give the husband that love which  was his due.</p>
  <p>Errington  was now acting wrongly, as he himself knew; he was voluntarily flinging himself  into the arms of a woman whom he knew to be worthless, but who can say he had  no provocation? He had done his best to win his wife&rsquo;s love, he had suffered in  silence during the period of his married life, and in return she had shamefully  neglected him, and had finally, with hardly any proof, accused him of  voluntarily making a friend of a worthless woman. Outraged by this treatment,  the husband left her presence, and she had driven him into the very jaws of  destruction.</p>
  <p>Doubtless  he should have stood firm, and by years of patient self-sacrifice showed her  that she was wrong. But how many of us are capable of such asceticism? How many  of us would stand for long years in the outer darkness, knowing himself to be  guiltless of the crime laid to his charge?</p>
  <p>This  woman&mdash;pure wife, affectionate mother, as she was&mdash;had acted as if she were above  the weaknesses of human nature. She had arrogated to herself the functions of  the Deity in judging and condemning a poor human soul, who, weary with  beseeching for what it never received, fell away in despair into the gulf of  sin and misery.</p>
  <p>Who  was wrong&mdash;the man who sought evil in despair, or the woman whose coldness and  purity had denied him the mercy which would have saved him?</p>

  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm&rsquo;s drawing-room was not by any means an artistic apartment, being full  of violent contrasts in the way of decoration and furniture, yet not without a  certain picturesqueness of its own. It was bizarre, gaudy, fantastic, strange,  and a faithful reflection of the curious mind of its mistress. The European  side of her nature inspired her with a certain amount of artistic taste, while  the African blood in her veins made her delight in brilliant colouring and  barbaric ornamentation. The eyes ached as they rested on the confused mass of  tints, variegated as a flower-garden, and yet there was a certain design and  harmony throughout, something like the tangled patterns of those Oriental  carpets, those Indian shawls, which represent the cloudy splendours haunting an  Eastern mind.</p>
  <p>The  paper on the walls of this room, oblong and lofty, was of a dark-red tint,  stamped with golden sunflowers rising from their velvety-green leaves. Delicate  lace curtains of milky white, interwoven with threads of silver, fell before  the three long windows, from under massive gilt cornices. The carpet was of  black and yellow stripes in undulating lines, like the skin of a tiger, and  here and there a rug of silky-white hair contrasted curiously with the  fantastic ground upon which it rested. The furniture was of dark walnut,  upholstered with bright yellow satin, smooth and shining as the inside of a  buttercup.</p>
  <p>In  the corners of the room stood slender palms with heavily-drooping leaves,  vividly-green ferns with feathery fronds, prickly, fleshy cactus and spiky,  fan-shaped plants, suggestive of tropical skies&mdash;some rising from the porous red  jars of Egypt, others springing from misshapen vases of porcelain, on which, in  crimson and green, sprawled the sacred Chinese dragon, and a few growing in  shallow basins of pale-yellow pottery.</p>
  <p>At  the end of the room, behind the veil of Indian bead curtains, was a  cool-looking conservatory, skilfully lighted by electric lamps in globes of pale  green, which diffused a kind of fictitious moonlight. In the drawing-room the  mass of colour, strange and incongruous, was softened, blended, and confused by  the tremulous red light that streamed from the tall brass lamps with their  umbrella-like shades of crimson silk. Add to this fantasy of light and colour,  the sickly odours of the pastilles constantly burning, and it can be imagined  how curiously appropriate this strange room was to the rich Eastern beauty and  oddly barbaric costume of Cleopatra.</p>
  <p>On  this night, having been down at Hurlingham, she was too tired to go out, so  preferred to remain at home and receive a few friends.</p>
  <p>At  present, she was lying negligently back in a low chair, arrayed in her  favourite costume of amber and black, but, despite the attentions of Dolly  Thambits, who was talking to her, she seemed to be out of temper. Mr. Jiddy,  seated on the extreme edge of a chair like a white cat, was listening to the  conversation of Major Griff, who, stiff and grim, was leaning against the mantelpiece.  No other people were present, nor did Mrs. Veilsturm seem very much inclined to  receive company, for she yawned once or twice, and looked at the Major  significantly, as if to hint that he might take away Mr. Thambits and friend as  soon as he liked.</p>
  <p>The  Major, however, wanted to speak to Mrs. Veilsturm himself, so he did not take  the hint, but resolutely waited on, in the hope that the two young men would  shortly depart and leave him alone with the charming widow. Meanwhile he  chatted about pigeon-shooting to Mr. Jiddy, who knew nothing about it, and  Thambits bored Mrs. Veilsturm to death by his dreary small talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, you know,&rdquo; drawled Dolly, after a pause, during which Mrs. Veilsturm had  been wondering how she could get rid of him, &ldquo;what about your fancy-dress ball?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ve put it off,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Veilsturm idly, &ldquo;a week or two does not make  much difference, and my costume was not ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to appear as?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  that is the question,&rdquo; said Cleopatra smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell you. I&rsquo;m  not going to tell anyone. I will appear at my own ball in the most unexpected  fashion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  a surprise packet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  as you elegantly put it&mdash;like a surprise packet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s jolly,&rdquo; observed Mr. Thambits brilliantly, then relapsed into silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, Mrs. Veilsturm!&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Errington&rsquo;s  gone to the country again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm could not suppress an angry start at this information. She had missed  Guy for the last three or four days, and, having heard nothing from him since  she received his note excusing himself from coming to the Marlowe Theatre, was  considerably enraged at this neglect. She was too clever, however, to betray  herself to Dolly Thambits, who was jealously vigilant, so she asked quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  who told you so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gartney!  He went about four days ago. Got tired of Town, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt! Town does get wearisome at times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so while you are here,&rdquo; said Mr. Thambits tenderly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a charming compliment,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Veilsturm with a forced laugh, shutting  her fan savagely, for when Dolly was amorous he was simply detestable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to you,&rdquo; he murmured softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  compliments,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;You must pass your days making them up.  By-the-way, would you mind telling me the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  It is now a few minutes past nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I say, is it?&rdquo; cried Mr. Jiddy, jumping up from his chair. &ldquo;I say, Dolly, we&rsquo;ve  got to go to Lady Kalsmith&rsquo;s you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you were coming also, Mrs. Veilsturm?&rdquo; said Dolly, rising reluctantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I!  No,&rdquo; she answered, lifting her eyebrows. &ldquo;Would I be dressed like this if I  were going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Veilsturm,&rdquo; explained Major Griff, graciously, &ldquo;is too tired to go out  to-night, and thinks a rest will do her good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid we&rsquo;ve tired you,&rdquo; said Thambits, looking at his divinity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  dear, not at all,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Veilsturm, lying with the utmost dexterity. &ldquo;So  glad to see you. <i>Au revoir</i> at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  call and see if you are better to-morrow,&rdquo; said Dolly, making his adieux with  manifest reluctance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delighted!  goodbye, Mr. Jiddy! Major?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grill  took the hint, and ushered Dolly and his friend out of the room before they had  time to change their minds, and having seen them safely bestowed in a hansom,  returned to Mrs. Veilsturm, whom he found sitting in her old place, frowning  savagely at the fireplace. The Major resumed his lounging attitude on the  hearthrug, and lighted a cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  smoke,&rdquo; said Mrs. Veilsturm sharply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my drawing-room to smell  like a bar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  not much chance of that,&rdquo; retorted the Major coolly, throwing the match into  the fireplace, and blowing a cloud of smoke. &ldquo;No one will come to-night, and  those abominable pastilles you are so fond of burning will dissipate the smoke  by to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm offered no further remonstrance, but tapped her fan thoughtfully in  the palm of her hand. Major Griff watched her in silence for a moment, and then  made a polite remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a fool, Maraquita.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you&rsquo;re thinking about that young Errington. He&rsquo;s no good to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Us!  Us!&rdquo; she reiterated savagely, &ldquo;always us! Do you think I&rsquo;ve nothing else to do  but to think of you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  present, No,&rdquo; replied Griff coolly. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get in a rage, my dear. It doesn&rsquo;t  improve your looks, and certainly does not carry any weight with me. I tell you  again you&rsquo;re a fool for thinking about Errington. He&rsquo;s gone back to his wife in  spite of your cleverness. Didn&rsquo;t you hear that idiot say so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  she echoed scornfully, raising her eyes to his face, &ldquo;what of that? Do you  think I&rsquo;m going to let him go so easily?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see you&rsquo;ve much option in the matter,&rdquo; said Griff grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see nothing except what suits your own ends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely. That&rsquo;s the way to succeed in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t seem to have made much headway yet,&rdquo; replied Cleopatra with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  pretty well&mdash;pretty well,&rdquo; said the Major airily. &ldquo;I think this room&mdash;this house&mdash;your  dress&mdash;your diamonds&mdash;your position&mdash;are all evidences of success. And we&rsquo;ll do  better if you only keep your head clear, and not sacrifice everything for this  Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t intend to sacrifice anything for Sir Guy Errington,&rdquo; she replied  viciously, &ldquo;but I intend he shall sacrifice all for me; his wife! his home! his  honour! all he holds dearest in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then he can go his own way. I have done with him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Veilsturm calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t talk in such a melodramatic fashion if I were you,&rdquo; observed Griff  leisurely, &ldquo;revenge is all very well on the stage, but it&rsquo;s silly in real life.  You stand to gain nothing, and lose a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think I can forget the insult his wife put upon me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  then punish the wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  intend to&mdash;through the husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  look here, Maraquita,&rdquo; said her partner earnestly, emphasizing his remarks with  his finger. &ldquo;You take care what you&rsquo;re about. We&rsquo;ve had a good time in London,  but the game is pretty well played out. It&rsquo;s always advisable to leave a place  with flying colours, so that one can come back again. People are talking about  you already, don&rsquo;t let them talk any more, or you&rsquo;ll find all your lady friends  give you the cold shoulder, and if they do, you may rest assured they won&rsquo;t be  satisfied till they induce their husbands, fathers, and brothers to follow  their example. I don&rsquo;t see the fun of such a scandal, especially as there&rsquo;s  nothing to be got out of Errington. He&rsquo;s as poor as a church mouse. So leave  him alone, and after the ball, we can go for America in good odour with  everyone, and after a year or two in the States, we can come back here when a  new generation arises that don&rsquo;t know Joseph. My advice is sound, Maraquita,  and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm sat perfectly still during this speech, with her eyes cast down on  the closed fan lying on her lap, but when the Major ended, she looked up  suddenly with a sombre frown on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  made up my mind what to do, and neither you nor anyone else will turn me from  my purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Major  Griff shrugged his shoulders and walked slowly to the other end of the room. He  was a man who never wasted words, and seeing from the set expression of Mrs.  Veilsturm&rsquo;s face that she was determined to carry out her purpose, he judged it  useless to argue about the matter. Yet, although he kept his temper well under  control, he could not help saying something disagreeable to this woman who was  sacrificing everything for the sake of revenge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  spite of your cleverness, my dear Maraquita, I shrewdly suspect that Sir Guy  sees through your little game, he has placed himself beyond the reach of  temptation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will come back,&rdquo; she said curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt it. The moth does not come back to the flame that has once singed its  wings. The fly doesn&rsquo;t trust itself in the spider&rsquo;s web a second time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Major returned to the fireplace, produced his pocketbook in the most leisurely  manner, and took a gold pencil case hanging at the end of his chain in his  fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  bet you the worth of that diamond star in your hair he does not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be rash, the star cost two hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So.  I&rsquo;ll lay you two hundred pounds to the promise that you&rsquo;ll behave decently,  that Errington does not come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm opened her fan with a grand wave, and looked at him serenely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Book  it,&rdquo; she said curtly.</p>
  <p>Major  Griff did so, and restored the book to his pocket. &ldquo;Well, I must be off,&rdquo; he  said, stretching himself. &ldquo;I want to see Dolser about putting a paragraph in  his paper concerning the ball. Can I do anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  thank you. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went towards the door, and without vouchsafing a glance at her, left the room.</p>
  <p>If  Mrs. Veilsturm was tired, she did not make any attempt to go to bed, but  remained seated in her chair pondering over the position of affairs.</p>
  <p>She  was not by any means as confident over Errington&rsquo;s return as she pretended to  be, for she was far too clever a woman to misjudge the impression she had made.  Guy had gone away from Town without a word of farewell; therefore she was  easily satisfied that he was still heart-whole. As he had acted thus, she could  do absolutely nothing, for he certainly would not come back to a woman about  whom he did not care. And yet she had done everything in her power to entangle  him in her nets. The fool, to leave a woman like her for a pale, sickly wife.  Were her charms fading, that he had treated her so scornfully? Was the prize  not worth the winning? Was there really a man in the world who could turn  coldly away from her beauty when she smiled invitation?</p>
  <p>As  these thoughts passed through her mind, she arose from her chair rapidly, and  leaning her arms on the white marble mantelpiece, examined her face carefully  in the glass. The rich, dusky skin, through which flushed redly the hot blood,  the delicately drawn eyebrows, arched over the liquid eyes, the shining coils  of hair above the low forehead, the full, red lips, the shell-like ears, tinged  with pink, the slender neck; she examined them all in a severely critical  fashion, and saw that there was no flaw anywhere. A slow smile of triumph  curved the corners of her mouth as she looked at her beautiful face in the  mirror, and she turned away exulting in her physical perfection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  he resist me?&rdquo; she whispered to her heart, and her heart answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment a servant entered the room with a magnificent bouquet of white  lilies, which he presented to his mistress, and then retired. She held them in  her hands, inhaling their faint perfume, and admiring the stainless purity of  their deep cups; then, catching sight of a card thrust into the centre of the  flowers, she took it out to read the name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Guy Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a low laugh of triumph she tossed the flowers on the table, and, with the card  still in her hand, swept across the room to a desk of rosewood near the window.  Sitting down she wrote a note to Major Griff:</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Dear  Major,<br>
  &ldquo;Kindly  bring with you to-morrow your cheque for &pound;200. He has come back.<br>
  &ldquo;Maraquita  Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Placing  this in an envelope, she directed it to Major Griff, at the Globetrotters&rsquo;  Club, then ringing the bell, gave it to the servant, with instructions that it  was to be delivered at once.</p>
  <p>When  she was once more alone, she picked up Sir Guy&rsquo;s card, and smiled cruelly as  she looked at the name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  fool,&rdquo; she whispered softly. &ldquo;Oh, you fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
    In The Coils Of The Serpent</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;By  the magic of thine eyes<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast drawn me to the brake,<br>
    As thy victim slowly dies,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiss in triumph, cruel snake.<br>
    Strangled now I gasp for breath,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ensnared within thy toils,<br>
    I can only wait for death,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helpless in thy shining coils.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm was a lady who once having learnt a lesson from experience, never  needed to go to that unpleasant school a second time. She saw plainly that her  first tactics with regard to Errington had been entirely wrong, as it was a  mistake to treat such a non-appreciative person with kindness. Therefore, when  he returned to her for a second time, she behaved towards him with cold  disdain, which had the effect of making him simply furious, as it resembled the  way in which he had been treated by his wife. Instead of taking offence,  however, and leaving his capricious divinity in disgust, he followed her  everywhere, resolved with dogged perseverance to force her to revert to her  earlier demeanour.</p>
  <p>Wherever  Cleopatra went, Errington was to be seen in attendance, and at balls, theatres,  garden-parties, the Park, Hurlingham, his haggard-looking face appeared ever  beside her. All the world of London, seeing Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s change of front,  thought that she was tired of her last fancy, and began to pity her for the  persistent manner in which she was followed by her discarded lover. When  questioned on the subject, she simply laughed, and talked pathetically about  being a lonely widow, so that everyone said that she had been badly treated in  being suspected of favouring Errington in any way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  charming woman, my dear,&rdquo; whispered the world, behind its fan, &ldquo;always behaved  with the greatest delicacy in every way. But that young Errington! Oh! good  gracious! a young libertine&mdash;persecutes her with attentions and she can&rsquo;t  possibly get rid of him. A bad young man, my dear, a very bad young man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  the world, in its usual capricious manner, changed round altogether, and  whitewashed Mrs. Veilsturm as a saint, while it blackened poor Guy&rsquo;s character  as that of an irredeemable scamp. He had a wife, whom he treated very badly,  kept her shut up in a gloomy place in the country. Spent all his income in  leading a fast life. Terribly in debt, and mixed up with the Hebrews. Mrs.  Veilsturm had implored him, with tears in her eyes, to go back to his wife, but  he resolutely declined. She was really behaving very well, but as for young  Errington&mdash;well, what could be expected now-a-days?</p>
  <p>As  for Saint Cleopatra, she was placed on a pedestal from whence she smiled kindly  on her crowd of worshippers, and, possibly, laughed in her sleeve at the way in  which she was gulling them. She had completely recovered her position in the  eyes of society, and the Major chuckled complacently over the clever tactics of  his friend and partner. The ball at which she was to make her last appearance  in Town, was near at hand, and it seemed as though the firm were about to  depart for the States in a blaze of triumph.</p>
  <p>A  great change had come over Guy since his return to the feet of Mrs. Veilsturm.  Formerly so hearty and cheery, he was now gloomy and morose, with a frown on  his good-looking face and a pain in his heart. His wife&rsquo;s cruelty had wounded  him deeply, and though he did not care in the least for Mrs. Veilsturm, yet he  was determined, out of bravado, to persevere in his pursuit. After a time, however,  he became fascinated by her beauty and persistent neglect, which feeling  Cleopatra saw, and determined to profit by it when she judged fit. At present,  however, in the eyes of the world she was simply a virtuous woman exposed to  the addresses of a libertine, and gained a great deal of undeserved pity  thereby.</p>
  <p>Eustace  was still in Town, and was considerably puzzled over the whole affair,  especially by the way in which Mrs. Veilsturm was behaving. He knew that she  wanted to fascinate Guy for her own wicked ends, and wondered that she treated  him in a way that was calculated to lose her the very prize which she strove to  win. From constant observation, however, he gained a clear idea of the means  she was adopting both to attract Errington and silence scandal, and could not  refrain from admiring the dexterous fashion with which she played this very  difficult game.</p>
  <p>With  regard to his cousin, he, of course, guessed that he had quarrelled with  Alizon, but was unable to ascertain clearly what had occurred, as on asking Guy  he was savagely told to mind his own business. Eustace would have taken offence  at such treatment from anyone else, but he pitied his cousin for his obvious  unhappiness, therefore took no notice of his rudeness.</p>
  <p>He  saw plainly, however, that husband and wife had parted in anger, so the way was  made clear for him to carry out his intentions with regard to Lady Errington.  But curiously enough, now that the very thing he desired was made so easy for  him, he could not make up his mind to go down to Castle Grim, near the home of  the woman he loved. Eustace was as selfish and egotistical as ever, still in  spite of his strong inclination for Alizon, in spite of the three  interpositions of Destiny, which had such an effect on his fatalistic nature! he  hesitated about carrying out his project, and lingered in Town in a vacillating  frame of mind eminently unsatisfactory to himself.</p>
  <p>Once  or twice, with an idea that he was doing his duty, he ventured to speak to his  cousin about the way he was haunting the footsteps of Mrs. Veilsturm, but such  well-meant intentions were received by Guy with such bad grace that he judged  it best to remain neutral.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly heard of Guy&rsquo;s behaviour, and also of the position taken up by Mrs.  Veilsturm, by whose conduct she, in common with the rest of the world, was  completely blinded. She sent for Guy in order to remonstrate with him, but he  curtly refused to see her at all, and in despair she asked Eustace to speak to  his cousin. Eustace told her he had done so without any result, and declined to  interfere in the matter again. Miss Corbin would have liked to have written to  Alizon, but her last attempt to mend matters had resulted in such a fiasco that  she was afraid to do anything. So the poor old lady, already very ill, worried  and fretted herself to a shadow over the helpless position in which she found  herself.</p>
  <p>Seriously  angry with Guy, she had altered her will in favour of Eustace, and then took to  her bed, resolving to meddle no more in mundane affairs. Victoria and Minnie  attended her with great devotion, as she was clearly destined never to recover,  but her indomitable spirit held out to the end, and she forbade any of her  relations to be summoned. One thing displeased her seriously, that Otterburn  had not yet spoken to Victoria, and one day she asked him plainly if he  intended to do so, upon which the boy told her the whole state of the case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you see, Miss Corbin,&rdquo; he said, when he finished, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m afraid to try my  luck a second time, in case the answer will be no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no fear of that,&rdquo; replied Aunt Jelly, patting his hand. &ldquo;No one regrets  her refusal more than Victoria. You ask her again, and I&rsquo;ll warrant the answer  will be what you desire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Otterburn, having received this encouragement, made up his mind to speak to  Victoria at Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s ball. Aunt Jelly had not intended to let Miss  Sheldon go to this festivity at first, thinking that Mrs. Veilsturm had  designedly attracted Guy, but when she heard the way in which she was behaving,  she withdrew her prohibition and insisted upon Victoria going. Not only that,  but she herself selected a costume for her ward, and considerably astonished  that young damsel when she told her what she wanted her to appear as.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  Flora Macdonald?&rdquo; asked Victoria, in surprise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit Scotch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you not?&rdquo; said Aunt Jelly drily. &ldquo;I thought your mother was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  make nonsensical objections, child,&rdquo; replied Miss Corbin sharply, with a flash  of her old spirit. &ldquo;I want you to go as Flora Macdonald, and I&rsquo;ve no doubt you&rsquo;ll  find out the reason before the ball is ended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereat  Victoria, being less innocent of the reason than she pretended to be, laughed  gaily, and went off with Minnie Pelch on a shopping excursion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Minnie,&rdquo;  she said to her companion, when they left Miss Corbin, &ldquo;do you know anything  about Flora Macdonald?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; said Minnie, delighted at displaying her historical knowledge. &ldquo;She was  in love with Bonnie Prince Charlie, and saved his life, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bonnie  Prince Charlie,&rdquo; repeated Victoria thoughtfully, &ldquo;perhaps I&rsquo;ll meet him at the  ball.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; replied Miss Pelch significantly, for being a true woman,  and dearly loving a romance, she had seen long ago how matters stood between  Otterburn and Miss Sheldon.</p>
  <p>So  they went shopping all that bright afternoon, hunting up tartans, talking  learnedly about Cairngorm brooches, and white cockades, and Jacobite songs, and  the Lord knows what else.</p>
  <p>Ah  me, how strangely does Fate deal with our lives. Here was Guy drifting away from  his wife day by day, and Angus being drawn nearer and nearer to Victoria. What  Sir Guy Errington and Alizon Mostyn were two years before, they were about to  become now&mdash;would their future be the same?</p>
  <p>Who  could tell? Fortune, blind and capricious, whirls her wheel round and round,  raising and abasing men and women daily, hourly, momentarily, unaware herself,  by reason of her bandage, of the good and evil she allots to one and another.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
    What Made The Ball Sae Fine?</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Sure  this wild fantastic band<br>
  Must have come from Fairy-land.<br>
  Those who live in History&rsquo;s page,<br>
  Step once more upon Life&rsquo;s stage.<br>
  All the poet&rsquo;s dreamings bright,<br>
  In the flesh appear to-night,<br>
  Columbine and Harlequin,<br>
  Knight, Crusader, Saracen,<br>
  Cleopatra and her Roman,<br>
  Herod, Borgia loved of no man,<br>
  Antoinette and Louis Seize,<br>
  Faust with Mephistopheles,<br>
  All beneath the gas-lamps&rsquo; gleam,<br>
  Dance as in some magic dream.<br>
  Surely at the break of day,<br>
  Will the vision fade away,<br>
  And these spirits bright and fair,<br>
Vanish into viewless air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm had certainly no reason to complain of lack of popularity, as she  looked at her salons thronged with all fashionable London. Her diplomatic  behaviour towards Errington for the last few weeks had borne good fruit, having  converted foes into friends, and friends into red-hot partizans, therefore  everyone came to her fancy dress ball, and this entertainment which signalised  her exit from London Society was proving a wonderful success.</p>
  <p>Never  had she looked so perfectly lovely as she did on this night, when, robed as  Cleopatra, she stood near the door receiving her guests. Swathed in diaphanous  tissues, broidered with strange figures in gold and silver, with jewels  flashing star-like from every portion of her dress, the double crown of Egypt  on her lustrous coils of hair, and a trailing mantle of imperial purple silk  drooping from her shoulders, she looked like the embodiment of some splendid  civilization long since perished from the earth. Truly this woman, with her  majestic bearing, her voluptuous form, her rich Eastern beauty, and slow  sensuous movements, looked like that antique coquette of the slow-flowing Nile,  whose face, fair and deathless, still smiles at us across the long centuries  from out the darkness of old Egypt.</p>
  <p>The  huge room resembled a garden of flowers blown by the wind, as the restless  dancers in their brilliant costumes swayed hither and thither to the music of  the band. Dainty Watteau shepherdesses, serene Greek maidens, medi&aelig;val pages,  steel-clad knights, Cavaliers, Louis Quatorze musketeers, and divers other  picturesque figures, mingled together in gay confusion, laughing, talking,  jesting, smiling, flirting and whispering, without pause or rest. And above the  murmur of voices, the sound of feet gliding over the polished floor, and the  indistinct frou-frou of dresses, sounded the rhythmical swing of the valse &ldquo;Caprice  d&rsquo;une femme,&rdquo; played by an unseen orchestra. The gas-lamps in their  many-coloured shades gleamed softly over the noisy crowd, the faint perfume of  myriad flowers, drooping in the heat on the decorated walls, floated dreamily  on the heavy air, and round and round with laughter and jesting swept the  dancers, while the fitful music arose and fell with its recurrent burden of  passionate tenderness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear,  dear!&rdquo; observed a ponderous Britannia, fanning her red face with her shield, &ldquo;how  hot it is to be sure! I wonder if there&rsquo;s such a thing as an ice to be had?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  champagne?&rdquo; said a faded-looking Dawn sitting near her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positively dying  for champagne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young  men are so selfish,&rdquo; sighed Britannia, looking in vain for a friendly face; &ldquo;they  come to my dances, but never think of looking after me when I&rsquo;m not in my own  house. One might starve for all they care, and an ice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would,  no doubt, save you from such a fate,&rdquo; said a languid voice, as a tall,  heavily-built man, in a monkish dress, paused near the representative of the  British Empire. &ldquo;Come then, Mrs. Trubbles, and I&rsquo;ll get you one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  me, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Trubbles, shifting her trident to her left hand  in order to welcome Eustace. &ldquo;Well, I am astonished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  seeing me here, or at my dress? Both things rather extraordinary, I must  confess. I&rsquo;m rather fond of fancy dress balls, all the same. It&rsquo;s so pleasant  to see one&rsquo;s friends making fools of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  unamiable, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; said Dawn, screwing her wrinkled face into what was  meant for a fascinating smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how true, Mrs. Dills,&rdquo; responded Gartney, with a bow, &ldquo;but I see both you  ladies are longing for supper, so perhaps I can make myself useful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  you can,&rdquo; said both eagerly, rising and taking an arm each.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel like the royal arms, between the lion and the unicorn,&rdquo; remarked Eustace,  jestingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dills, who set up for being a wit, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got the lion  between us. But what might you be, Mr. Gartney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rabelais.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  Rabelais?&rdquo; cried Britannia, with a faint idea it might be something to eat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rabelais,&rdquo;  explained Eustace, gravely, &ldquo;was the creator of Pantagruel and Gargantua.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never heard of him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dills crossly, being in want of her supper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  fame! fame!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bother  fame,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Trubbles, as the two ladies sat down at the table. &ldquo;I  would give the fame of Nebuchadnezzar for a good meal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall have it and without such a sacrifice,&rdquo; said Eustace, assisting Dawn and  Britannia plenteously; &ldquo;by-the-way, isn&rsquo;t Miss Sheldon with you, to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  Flora Macdonald, whoever she was,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trubbles, heavily, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s with  that young Macjean. Do you remember him at Como, Mr. Gartney? He&rsquo;s in a Scotch  dress to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bonnie  Prince Charlie, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  a tobacconist&rsquo;s sign,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dills who was an adept at saying nasty things.  &ldquo;By-the-way, Mr. Gartney, isn&rsquo;t the company rather mixed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dills&rsquo; papa had been an opulent linen-draper, and Mr. Dills had made his money  by a speciality in sheets, so she thought herself quite justified in  criticising aristocratic society.</p>
  <p>Eustace  knew all about Mrs. Dills, and was so amused by the little woman&rsquo;s insolence,  that he did not reply half so severely as he had intended to do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you see I&rsquo;ve not had your opportunities for judging,&rdquo; he replied drily, &ldquo;but as  far as I can judge, there&rsquo;s nobody here that isn&rsquo;t somebody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  their characters,&rdquo; hinted Mrs. Dills, with a seraphic look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  bah! I&rsquo;m no Asmodeus to unroof people&rsquo;s houses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a lucky thing&mdash;for the people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what a disappointment&mdash;for their friends,&rdquo; said Eustace, significantly.</p>
  <p>He  hated Mrs. Dills, who was an adept at damning with faint praise, and took away  people&rsquo;s characters with the look of a four-year-old child and the tongue of a  serpent. Mrs. Dills saw Gartney&rsquo;s meaning, and resenting it with all the  viciousness of a small mind, began to be nasty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see Sir Guy Errington is here,&rdquo; she said, smiling blandly, &ldquo;as Edgar of Ravenswood.  He looks like a thundercloud in black velvet. I&rsquo;m so sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  really very kind of you,&rdquo; retorted Eustace, sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; murmured Dawn, sympathetically; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such a pity to see his  infatuation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what?&rdquo; demanded Gartney, obtusely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  really! You know! of course you do! Poor Lady Errington! And then the &lsquo;Other&rsquo;  doesn&rsquo;t care for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little  viper,&rdquo; thought Eustace, looking smilingly at her, but saying nothing, which  encouraged Mrs. Dills to proceed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a dreadful scandal, but not &lsquo;Her&rsquo; fault&mdash;oh, dear no! but he ought to go back to  his wife, especially as the &lsquo;Other&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t care for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  talk like a sphinx,&rdquo; said Eustace, coldly. &ldquo;Whom do you mean by the &lsquo;Other&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dills smiled sweetly, and having finished her supper arose to take his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  one is in Rome, one must not speak evil of the Pope,&rdquo; she replied cleverly. &ldquo;Are  you quite ready, Mrs. Trubbles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite,  my dear,&rdquo; said that matron, who had made an excellent supper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back  now, Mr. Gartney. Dear me, there&rsquo;s Mr. Thambits. How do you do? What is your  character, Mr. Thambits?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion,&rdquo; answered Dolly, who looked very ill at ease in his  armour, &ldquo;and Jiddy is Blondel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he really?&rdquo; said Britannia, poking Jiddy in the back with her trident to make  him turn round. &ldquo;Very nice. I saw Blondin on the tight-rope once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Blondin, but Blondel,&rdquo; explained Jiddy, meekly, &ldquo;he was a harper, you know, and  sang songs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you don&rsquo;t carry your impersonation so far as that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dills,  spitefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  had singing lessons,&rdquo; began Blondel, indignantly, &ldquo;and I sing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do, I&rsquo;ve heard you,&rdquo; said Eustace, significantly, and then hurried his two  ladies quickly back to their seats, being somewhat tired of Mrs. Dills&rsquo; spiteful  tongue and Britannia&rsquo;s ponderous conversation.</p>
  <p>Having  thus performed his duty, he went away to look for Otterburn, being anxious to  know how that young man had sped in his wooing. Near the door, however, a man  brushed roughly past him with a muttered apology, and Eustace, turning to see  whom this ill-bred person could be, found himself face to face with Guy  Errington. He was dressed as the Master of Ravenswood, and, in his sombre dress  of dark velvet, his high riding boots of black Spanish leather, and his broad  sombrero with its drooping white plume of feathers, looked remarkably handsome,  though, as Mrs. Dills had remarked, &ldquo;like a thundercloud in black velvet,&rdquo; such  was the gloom of his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you, Guy?&rdquo; said his cousin, laying a detaining hand upon the young man&rsquo;s  shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  only been here half-an-hour,&rdquo; replied Errington listlessly. &ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no! only you&rsquo;ve avoided me for the last week or so, and I want to know the  reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no reason that I know of, and I haven&rsquo;t avoided you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he spoke, his eyes were looking over the heads of the crowd, and in following  their gaze. Eustace saw they rested on Cleopatra, who was talking to Major  Griff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I see the reason,&rdquo; said Eustace coolly, &ldquo;and a very handsome reason it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Errington  laughed in a sneering manner and made no reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say Guy,&rdquo; remarked Eustace complacently, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it about time you stopped  making a fool of yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?  you wish me to speak plainer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not wish you to speak at all,&rdquo; retorted Errington fiercely, his eyes full of  sombre fire. &ldquo;Our relationship has its privileges, Gartney, but don&rsquo;t take too  much advantage of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  shook off his cousin&rsquo;s hand impatiently, and without another word disappeared  in the crowd, leaving Eustace considerably perturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  done all I can,&rdquo; he muttered disconsolately. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bent on going to the devil  via Mrs. Veilsturm, so I can&rsquo;t stop him. If I only dared to console his wife,  but she&rsquo;s got the boy&mdash;that&rsquo;s consolation enough for a piece of ice like her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Errington, pushing his way through the dancers, made his way to Cleopatra, who,  having finished with Griff, was chatting to a young F.O. man. On seeing  Errington, she turned towards him with a slight bow, and began to talk, upon  which the F.O. went off to find some one else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you not dancing, Sir Guy?&rdquo; she asked, looking at him brightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t care about it, unless you dance with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about my duties as hostess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you&rsquo;ve done enough penance for one evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  that my reward is to dance with you,&rdquo; she said mischievously. &ldquo;Thank you,  Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was more amiable to him this evening than she had been of late. And Guy,  feeling the change, thawed wonderfully under the sunshine of her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  am I to have my dance?&rdquo; he asked, with a smile.</p>
  <p>Cleopatra  took up her programme and ran her eyes over the series of scratches which did  duty for names opposite the dances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know if you deserve one,&rdquo; she whispered coquetishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say that. As you are strong, be merciful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  handed him the card with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can have that valse,&rdquo; she said, indicating one far down, &ldquo;by that time I will  be released from durance vile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Errington  scribbled his name, and giving her back the card, was about to renew the  conversation, when she dismissed him imperiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  you have got what you wanted, go away. I have a number of people to talk to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lot of fools,&rdquo; he muttered peevishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly&mdash;we  can&rsquo;t all be Ravenswoods, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maraquita!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue,&rdquo; she said, in a fierce whisper, &ldquo;do you want to compromise me  before all these people? Go away, and don&rsquo;t come near me till our valse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely  depends upon the humour I am in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  took his dismissal in a sufficiently sulky manner, which made Mrs. Veilsturm  smile blandly, on seeing which he turned away with a stifled curse. It was  extraordinary, the change in this man, who, from being a good-natured-enough  fellow, had suddenly changed, through his wife&rsquo;s cruelty and his temptress&rsquo;s  caprices, into a morose, disagreeable individual, whom nobody cared to speak  with.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that Sir Guy Errington?&rdquo; asked a soft voice behind him. &ldquo;See if it is, Mr.  Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need,&rdquo; responded Errington with forced civility, turning round to  Otterburn and Miss Shelton. &ldquo;You have very sharp eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you see I knew what your costume was going to be,&rdquo; said Victoria, who looked  wonderfully pretty as Flora Macdonald. &ldquo;Aunt Jelly told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way, how is Aunt Jelly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  not at all well,&rdquo; replied Victoria, reproachfully, &ldquo;and you have not been near  her for some weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  pleasantly employed, eh?&rdquo; said Otterburn, laughing, for which he was rewarded  by a fierce glance from Errington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been busy,&rdquo; he said briefly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call shortly. Hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy this  foolery, Miss Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jerking  out these polite sentences he went off, leaving the young couple looking after  him in undisguised astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come over Sir Guy,&rdquo; said Macjean, as they pursued their way  towards the conservatory, &ldquo;he used to be such a good-tempered fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>cherchez la femme</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  have to seek far I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; replied Angus, glancing at the distant form of  Mrs. Veilsturm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  a horrid woman,&rdquo; said Victoria, viciously, as they entered the conservatory,  and found a comfortable nook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  quite agree with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shouldn&rsquo;t talk of your hostess in that way,&rdquo; observed Miss Sheldon reprovingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I say, you know,&rdquo; replied Otterburn, rather bewildered at this sudden change of  front, &ldquo;you say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say lots of things I do not mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could be sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;oh!  you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Miss Sheldon, demurely, then looking up, she caught his  eye, and they both laughed gaily.</p>
  <p>The  conservatory was certainly a very pleasant place, with its wealth of palms, of  cactuses, of ferns and such-like tropical vegetation. A pale, emerald radiance  from green-shaded lamps bathed the whole place, and at one end a slender jet of  water shot up like a silver rod from the stillness of a wide pool, in which  floated great white water-lilies. The band in the distant ball-room were  playing a <i>pot pourri</i> of airs from the latest opera, and Otterburn sat  under the drooping fronds of a palm-tree beside Victoria, with the fatal words  which would bind him for life trembling on his lips. So handsome he looked in  his picturesque Scotch dress, with the waving tartans and gleam of Cairngorm  brooches, and his bright young face bent towards her, full of tender meaning.  Victoria knew quite well that he intended to propose again, and her heart beat  rapidly as her eyes fell before the fiery light which burned in his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose you have quite forgotten Como?&rdquo; said Otterburn, in what he meant to be  a matter-of-fact tone.</p>
  <p>Miss  Sheldon began to draw designs on the floor with the toe of her dainty boot, and  laughed nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no! it was the first time I was in Italy, you know, and first impressions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  always excellent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you don&rsquo;t think the same about first refusals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Refusals  of what?&rdquo; she replied, wilfully misunderstanding his meaning, at which  Otterburn felt somewhat disappointed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  your memory is treacherous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think not! I can remember most things&mdash;when I choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  do you remember how we talked about Scotch costumes, and I said I&rsquo;d put mine on  the first Fancy Dress Ball we went to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I remember that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is the first Fancy Dress Ball.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are in your tartans,&rdquo; she answered, with a sudden glance. &ldquo;How curiously it  all comes about. I thought you had forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never forget anything you say,&rdquo; he replied eagerly. &ldquo;I wish I could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  that&rsquo;s very unkind of you! Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I wish to forget how cruel you were to me at the Villa Medici.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  I cruel?&rdquo; she asked, with sudden compunction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know you were,&rdquo; he answered reproachfully, &ldquo;so I think you ought to make up for  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  took her hand that was lying on her lap, and drew her towards him. She made no  resistance, but still kept her eyes cast down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I make up for it?&rdquo; she asked, in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By saying Yes, instead of  No,&rdquo; he replied ardently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  Yes, instead of No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  cruel you are still,&rdquo; he said impatiently. &ldquo;You understand what I mean quite  well. You sent me away to wander all over the face of the earth because you  were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  coquette,&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said so,&rdquo; he answered, rather taken aback.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did&mdash;then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?  Well I do not now. I&rsquo;ll say you are the dearest, sweetest girl in the world if  you&rsquo;ll only say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you&rsquo;ve said it,&rdquo; he said joyfully, slipping his arm round her waist. &ldquo;You have  said, &lsquo;yes.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  perhaps I did not mean it,&rdquo; she answered coquettishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he retorted recklessly, &ldquo;you have said it, and I hold you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  you do,&rdquo; she murmured with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  your word,&rdquo; he finished gaily. &ldquo;Victoria, say you love me a little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  face whitened, and a pained look came into his eyes, but she laid her head on  his shoulder, and looking up, whispered softly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I love you a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  bent down and kissed her fondly, and then&mdash;then&mdash;ah, who can repeat truly the  conversation of lovers, who can write down coldly all the fond, foolish words,  the tender endearments, that go to make up the happy time that succeeds the  little word &ldquo;yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  music in the distance ceased, there was the noise of approaching feet, and  Victoria sprang to her feet quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must go back to the ball-room, Mr. Macjean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Macjean!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, &lsquo;Angus.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s much better,&rdquo; he said gaily, giving her his arm. &ldquo;You are no doubt  engaged for the next dance, but I cannot give you up so soon. Now I&rsquo;ve got you  I&rsquo;ll keep you for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ever&rsquo;s  a long time,&rdquo; laughed Victoria, whose face was beaming with smiles, as she  looked at her handsome young lover walking so proudly beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  won&rsquo;t be long enough for me,&rdquo; he said fondly, and they passed into the  brilliant ball-room at peace with themselves and the world.</p>
  <p>On  the way they met Eustace, who glanced keenly at both of them, and then held out  his hands with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  congratulate you both,&rdquo; he said, smiling; &ldquo;you will both be happy&mdash;till you get  tired of one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  horrid man,&rdquo; said Victoria with a shiver as he passed onward. &ldquo;We will never  get tired, Mr.&mdash;I mean Angus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo;  he whispered fervently.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s  nothing half so sweet in life as love&rsquo;s young dream, but what a pity there  should be any awakening.</p>

  <p>It  was now nearly the end of the season, and Society was preparing to amuse itself  in another fashion. Brighton, and Trouville, and Dieppe, and Scarborough were  thronged with languid men and women, slowly regaining from the fresh salt  breeze of the sea the strength they had wasted during the feverish existence of  the season. After her brilliant entertainment, Mrs. Veilsturm had taken a villa  at San Remo for a month or so, prior to departing for the States, and managed  to amuse herself very comfortably by the blue Mediterranean, with an occasional  run over to Monte Carlo and Nice.</p>
  <p>The  Major was in Paris, looking after some business connected with the inevitable  West Indian estate, though what Paris had to do with the West Indies nobody  could find out. However, his business being duly finished, he went South, at  the kind invitation of Mrs. Veilsturm, and found Anthony at the feet of  Cleopatra, in other words, Sir Guy Errington in attendance.</p>
  <p>Yes!  Guy, in spite of the calls of honour and respectability, had followed his  charmer to the Continent, and being released from the microscopic vision of  Mrs. Grundy, Cleopatra had been very kind to him, fully recouping him for the  cavalier fashion in which she had treated him in Town. He had never written to  his wife since leaving her, except a curt note telling her he was leaving  England for an indefinite period, and to this he had received no answer.  Angered at her silence, he abandoned any scruples he might have had and went off  to dishonour and Mrs. Veilsturm, who was delighted at the easy victory she had  secured over her hated rival. She flattered and caressed Errington with all the  infinite charm of which she was mistress, was kind and cruel by turns, but  never permitted him to go beyond a certain limit, which cautious conduct  perplexed him exceedingly. He had thrown up everything for her, and expected a  like sacrifice in return, but Mrs. Veilsturm was not by any means prepared to  give up her hardly-won position even for revenge. All she wanted was to destroy  the married life of Lady Errington, and she was quite willing to accomplish  this by keeping Guy near her under the shadow of suspicion, without giving that  suspicion any real grounds. Therefore, she kept him in a fool&rsquo;s paradise of  meaningless caresses, which meant nothing, and had he been a wise man he would  have seen that he had given up the substance for the shadow.</p>
  <p>He  was not a wise man, however, and dangled after Mrs. Veilsturm in a manner that  would have won his own contempt had he thought. But he never thought, or if he  did, it was more of the wife he had left behind than this capricious woman,  whose slave he was supposed to be. He did not love her, but was content to  surrender himself to the spell of her evil beauty, and acted as he did more  from a sense of revolt against his wife&rsquo;s scorn, than any innate desire to do  wrong. It was an unsatisfactory position, and he felt it to be so, but Mrs.  Veilsturm was too clever to let him go until her revenge was quite complete, and  every day wound her chains closer round him.</p>
  <p>Major  Griff was not pleased to find Errington in this position, as he thought it  would compromise Cleopatra&rsquo;s reputation too much, but when he saw the way in  which she was conducting the campaign he was perfectly satisfied, and smiled  grimly at the dexterous manner in which she was revenging herself for the  insult she had received.</p>
  <p>Dolly  Thambits, in company with the faithful Jiddy, was staying at Monte Carlo, and  losing his money with wonderful skill at the tables. This, however, seemed a  waste of God&rsquo;s best gifts to the Major, and, aided by the seductions of  Cleopatra, he inveigled Dolly to San Remo and kept him under his own eye. He  won a lot of money from him, which came in useful, and occasionally went out  with him to Monaco, so as to make such pigeon-plucking look less glaring.</p>
  <p>Dolly  was anxious to marry Mrs. Veilsturm, who simply laughed at his frequent  proposals, as she was by no means tired of being a free lance, but she decided  in her own mind, that when she was she would marry Mr. Thambits and give the  cold shoulder to Major Griff. At present, however, she coquetted with Guy so as  to retain him in her toils, and made poor Dolly deadly jealous of the  good-looking baronet, which was useful in keeping him by her side out of  contrariness. She was a clever woman, Maraquita Veilsturm, and kept everyone  well in hand, so that not even the astute Major suspected her designs.</p>
  <p>While  Guy was thus abandoning himself to the spell of Circe, Eustace had gone down to  Castle Grim, and was seeing a good deal of the deserted wife. He did not make  much progress, however, in his wooing, as Alizon was not a woman to wear her  heart on her sleeve, and never spoke of her husband in any way. She simply said  that her husband was abroad, made no reference to the reason of their  separation, and for the rest, passed her days with her child, and treated  Eustace in a kindly fashion when he came over on a visit.</p>
  <p>Astute  man of the world as he was, Gartney was quite at a loss how to proceed, and  might have retired from the unequal contest in despair, much as he loved her,  had not an event happened which gave him the opening he desired.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Jelly died.</p>
  <p>She  had been ailing for a long time, poor soul, and was glad when the time came to  leave this world, in which she had found such small pleasure. Her imperious  spirit held out to the last, but she was strangely gentle at times, especially  to Minnie Pelch, whom she knew would be left quite alone in the world when she  died. Otterburn&rsquo;s engagement to Victoria gave her the greatest delight, and she  insisted that they should get married at once, so that she could leave the  world satisfied that the child of her old lover was under the safe protection  of a husband.</p>
  <p>Otterburn  was quite willing that the marriage should take place without delay, and wrote  a letter to Lord Dunkeld announcing his determination. By the advice of Johnnie  (who was greatly pleased with his new mistress, pronouncing her a &ldquo;canty lass,&rdquo;  which was complimentary if not intelligible), he wrote a crafty letter to  Mactab, enlisting his good offices to gain the consent of the old lord. Mactab  thought a good deal over the letter, but when he discovered that the proposed  bride was handsome, good, and had a large income, he came to the conclusion  that &ldquo;the laddie micht hae din waur,&rdquo; and went to interview Lord Dunkeld.</p>
  <p>The  fiery old gentleman was in a great rage, averring that neither money nor good  looks could make up for want of birth, but the discovery that Victoria&rsquo;s mother  was a Macjean, and therefore connected with the family, calmed his anger and  after some hesitation he consented to the match. Not only that, but he came up  to London to the marriage and brought the redoubtable Mactab to tie the nuptial  knot, so everything was really very pleasant.</p>
  <p>They  were married in a quiet fashion at Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s house, and Lord Dunkeld was  very much pleased with his new daughter, both as regards fortune and looks. The  young couple went off to Ventnor for their honeymoon, and after a fortnight in  Town, round which they were shewn by Eustace, Lord Dunkeld and his spiritual  adviser returned to the North, satisfied that the future head of the clan had  obtained a &ldquo;guid doonsettin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  the end of the honeymoon, however, Mrs. Macjean was summoned home to the  bedside of Aunt Jelly, but alas, before she arrived, Aunt Jelly had already  passed away attended to the last by Minnie Pelch. Both Otterburn and his young  wife were sorry for the death of the stern old woman, who had been so kind to  them both; and their sorrow was shared by Eustace, who came up from Castle Grim  for the funeral. Guy was telegraphed to, but as his relations with his aunt had  not been of the best during the latter part of his life, and he blamed her for  making trouble between himself and his wife, he refused to come over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt  Jelly hated me,&rdquo; he wrote to Eustace, &ldquo;and although I would liked to have made  it up with her before she died, yet I cannot forget the letter she wrote to my  wife, which has been the cause of all my trouble. She will no doubt leave you  all her money, as I know she had every intention of altering the will she made  in my favour, and I am sorry for my son&rsquo;s sake, if not for my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was much more in the letter which Eustace pondered over, as he understood  perfectly that Guy was not happy, but as he did not see how he could alter  things, he left them alone.</p>
  <p>On  the will being read, it turned out exactly as Guy had anticipated, for Aunt  Jelly left all her real and personal estate to Eustace, with the exception of  two hundred a year to Minnie Pelch, and some legacies to her servants, Victoria  and Doctor Pargowker. To Guy she did not leave a single thing, his name not  even being mentioned in the will.</p>
  <p>Eustace  wrote to his cousin and offered him half the fortune, but Guy refused, so  Gartney found himself an enormously rich man, and more miserable than ever.</p>
  <p>He  sincerely loved Alizon Errington, but did not know how to make his love known  to her, and as he could not see how to remedy the terrible misunderstanding  between husband and wife, he was forced to take up a neutral position.</p>
  <p>Mr.  and Mrs. Macjean, after the funeral, took their departure to Dunkeld Castle, on  a visit to the old lord, and after installing Minnie Pelch as mistress of the  house in Delphson Square, Eustace went down to Castle Grim, in order to tell  Lady Errington about the will.</p>
  <p>It  was a terribly bitter situation altogether. Husband parted from wife by a  miserable misunderstanding, and this man, wealthy and clever, wavering between  honour and dishonour, between respect for Guy and love for Alizon.</p>

    The Assaults Of The Evil One</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I  sit beside the gate of the heart<br>
  That bars the soul of this woman from me;<br>
  The little white soul, that dwelleth apart,<br>
  Safe from temptation and evil dart,<br>
  Nor one chink in the gate can I see.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Would  I could open this gate of the heart,<br>
  Enter within, as a conqueror wild;<br>
  Nay, but I see a sentinel start,<br>
  To guard its treasure from earthly smart,<br>
  Evil shrinks from this little white child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was summer down at Denfield, and the noble woods around Errington Hall were  waving their heavily foliaged branches over the flower-pranked earth. The  wayside hedges were gay with blossoms, the swallows wheeled aloft in the bright  blue sky, the farmer looking over the green fields was calculating the promise  of harvest, and there was sunshine throughout the land.</p>
  <p>Sunshine  from dawn till eve over the teeming earth: sunshine in the hearts of village  maidens, thinking of plighted troths; sunshine in the stolid faces of farming  lads, tramping beside their sleek horses; sunshine among the cronies, seated  outside the alehouse, in the warm summer air, but, in the heart of Alizon  Errington&mdash;ah, there was no sunshine there!</p>
  <p>She  was walking slowly up and down the terrace of the Hall, dividing her attention  between her own sad thoughts, and the gambols of Sammy, who was rolling amid  his toys on an outspread bearskin. Straight and slender as an arrow, in her  clinging white dress, with a red cluster of summer roses at her throat, but in  her face a stern look, which melted into an adoring smile when she looked upon  the child.</p>
  <p>Since  her husband&rsquo;s departure, Lady Errington had not been happy. Perhaps she had  been too hasty in judging him, perhaps she might have won him back from his  evil ways by kindly words, but there, it was no use regretting the past, he was  an exile on the Continent, and she was alone in her beautiful home. Not quite  alone, however, for the child was there; her darling child, who was the joy of  her life, the light of her eyes, and the comfort of her heart!</p>
  <p>Still,  she missed her husband, in spite of her self-congratulations that she had acted  as she had done; she missed his kindly ways, his affectionate smile, his  thousand little acts of tenderness, which had passed unnoticed when done, but now  seemed to start out of the past like a reproach for her severity. Had she been  too severe after all? He had sinned, it was true! She felt sure that his  character, like that of all men, resembled that of her father, and yet&mdash;he had  indignantly denied his fault; he had pleaded for one kind look, one parting  word, and she had refused his prayer. If his heart was evil, would it not have  been better for her to have striven to draw it closer to her by that one strand  of affection than sever the strand altogether, and let it sink back into the  gulf of iniquity from which it strove to emerge.</p>
  <p>Alizon  Errington was a good woman, who tried to do her best according to her lights,  to whom the very thought of vice was utterly abhorrent, yet sometimes, as at  this moment, unpleasant accusations of Pharisaism and self-righteousness were  in her mind.</p>
  <p>All  the tenderness and dog-like fidelity of her husband had failed to touch her  heart, but now that he had (as she verily believed) slighted her wilfully, and  voluntarily left a life of purity for one of guilt, she felt that he was more  to her than anyone else in the world, save his child. If his heart, if his  instincts, were as evil as she believed, all the more credit to him for the way  in which he strove to act honestly, but if on the other hand she had misjudged  him and driven a good man into evil by cruel words and harsh looks, then indeed  she was to blame. Either way she looked at things now it seemed to her that she  was in the wrong, and yet she could not, would not, acknowledge that she had  not acted justly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he had only waited for a time,&rdquo; she told herself restlessly. &ldquo;If he had only  shown by his actions that he desired to do right, I would have believed him in  time. But to go back to that vile woman after what I said&mdash;no!&mdash;he is like all  the rest&mdash;he makes evil his God, and would break my heart, and ruin his child&rsquo;s  future, sooner than deny himself the gratification of his brutal instincts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Strong  words certainly, but then she felt strongly. She was not a broad-minded woman,  for the horror with which her father had inspired her, had narrowed down her  views of life to Puritanical exactness. She demanded from the world purity&mdash;absolute  purity&mdash;which was an impossibility. What man could come to a woman and say, &ldquo;I  am as pure in my life as you are&rdquo;? Not one. Why then did she demand it from her  husband? but this was quite another view of the question. Her thoughts had gone  from one thing to another, until they had become involved and complex.</p>
  <p>With  a weary sigh she shook her head, as though to drive away all those ideas, and  sat down in a low chair, in order to play with the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sammy!  Sammy! You musn&rsquo;t put pitty things in mouse mouse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mum!  mum!&rdquo; from Sammy, who was making a bold attempt to swallow his coral necklace.  Finding this a failure he crawled quickly across the bearskin, drew himself up  to his mother&rsquo;s knees, and stood grinning, in a self-congratulatory manner, on  his unsteady little legs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  then,&rdquo; said Alizon, holding out her arms.</p>
  <p>Frantic  attempts on the part of Sammy to crawl up on her lap, ending with a fall, and  then a quick catching up into the desired place under a shower of kisses.</p>
  <p>They  made a pretty picture, mother and son; the pale, sad-looking woman, with the  fresh, rosy boy, and Eustace paused a moment, at the end of the terrace, to  admire it. The boy had caught the tortoise-shell pin in his mother&rsquo;s hair with  one chubby hand, and, before she could laughingly prevent him, had pulled it  out, so that the fair ringlets came falling over her breast in a golden shower.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  naughty Sammy,&rdquo; she said, gaily tossing him in the air with her two hands. &ldquo;Look  at poor mother&rsquo;s hair&mdash;bad child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sammy,  however, appeared to have a different opinion, and chuckled indistinctly to  himself, until he caught sight of Eustace, of whom he was very fond, and  stretched out his arms with a merry crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gartney,&rdquo; said Lady Errington, flushing a rosy red at the disorder of her hair,  &ldquo;just see what this scamp has done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young  Turk!&rdquo; said Eustace, taking the boy with a smile, while Alizon hastily twisted  up her hair into a loose knot. &ldquo;How are you, to-day, Lady Errington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  well, thank you,&rdquo; she replied quietly, as he sat down near her, with Sammy  still on his knee. &ldquo;I thought you were up in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I was. Came down last night,&rdquo; answered Gartney, while the baby made futile  grabs at his watch chain. &ldquo;Well, my prince, and how are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  never ill,&rdquo; said the young mother, with great pride. &ldquo;I never saw such a  healthy child. Not an illness since his birth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky  Sammy! if his future life is only as pleasant as the first year of it, what a  delightful time he will have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington&rsquo;s face had grown very grave during this speech, as she had caught  sight of the crape on his arm, and suddenly remembered why he had gone up to  town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  went to the funeral?&rdquo; she asked, the colour flushing in her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  he replied, smoothing the child&rsquo;s fair curls with gentle hand. &ldquo;I went to the  funeral. Poor Aunt Jelly! I don&rsquo;t think she was sorry to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alizon  made no reply, but sat perfectly still, looking steadily at him with a  questioning look on her face. He knew what she so much desired to know, and  broke the bad news to her as gently as he was able.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard the will read,&rdquo; he said awkwardly, reddening a little through the bronze  of his complexion, &ldquo;and she has left all her property to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Believe  me, I neither expected nor desired it,&rdquo; he cried hastily. &ldquo;I have got plenty of  money, without wishing more, and I thought she was going to leave it to Guy. I  really thought she intended to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  poor child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  was all she said&mdash;not a thought, not a word of pity for her absent husband. All  her sorrow was for the unconscious child playing on Gartney&rsquo;s knee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  assure you,&rdquo; began Eustace, feeling like a robber, &ldquo;that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you could not help it,&rdquo; she answered quietly. &ldquo;I know that perfectly well. Who  can be accountable for such things? But I am thinking of the future of my son.  This property is deeply mortgaged, and most of the income goes to pay the  interest. If Guy lived with me here we might save during the boy&rsquo;s minority,  but he is far away spending the money that is to be his son&rsquo;s. I thought Aunt  Jelly would have left the boy something, if she did not the father, and now he  will be a pauper when he comes of age. This place will have to be sold, and my  poor lad will never be Errington of the Hall&mdash;Oh, poor soul!&mdash;poor soul!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  voice ended in a tragic wail, and it was with difficulty that she restrained  her tears. Eustace never felt so awkward in his life, as he did not know what  to say in excuse for having unwittingly thwarted her hopes. Sammy had clambered  down off his knee, and was now contentedly covering his toys with his mother&rsquo;s  handkerchief, while she, poor woman, was sitting looking at him silently, with an  expression of mute misery on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Errington,&rdquo; said Eustace earnestly after a pause, &ldquo;believe me, I am as sorry as  you are, but I do not know how to act. I wrote to Guy, offering him half the  property by deed of gift, and he refused to take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  could do no less,&rdquo; she answered dully. &ldquo;What right have we to rob you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not robbery,&rdquo; he replied vehemently. &ldquo;I have more money than I want. Whenever  Guy likes to accept, he shall have half the property.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  answering his question, she looked down at the baby playing at her feet, and  then glanced at him keenly. &ldquo;Where is my husband?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the Continent&mdash;at San Remo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With!&mdash;with  that woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I!&mdash;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Eustace in a low voice, turning his face away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gartney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Lady Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  me in the face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did so unwillingly, and found her eyes fastened on his with a determined  expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  my husband with that woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I don&rsquo;t think so, but I certainly heard she was at San Remo,&rdquo; he answered evasively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  she drew a long breath, and a look of anger swept across her pale face. &ldquo;He is  with her then. I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must not be too hard on Guy,&rdquo; said Eustace, very feebly it must be confessed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hard  on Guy,&rdquo; she repeated scornfully. &ldquo;Hard on a man who leaves his wife and child  for a vile woman like that. You, of course, take his side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo; demanded Eustace hotly, &ldquo;because I am his cousin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  because you are a man. Men always stand up for one another. It&rsquo;s a kind of <i>esprit  du corps</i> with them I suppose. It is no wrong to betray a woman in their  eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know why you expect me to stand up for my sex, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Eustace  cynically. &ldquo;I think very little of them I assure you, and am quite incompetent  to undertake the Herculean task of defending their failings. I&rsquo;ve got too many  of my own to account for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt,&rdquo; replied Lady Errington bitterly. &ldquo;You men are all the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sincerely hope not,&rdquo; retorted Eustace imperturbably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no desire to  resemble certain fools of my acquaintance. My character is no better nor no  worse than my fellow-creatures&rsquo;, and had some good woman like yourself taken  charge of my life I might have improved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ought to get married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think so&mdash;from your own experience?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  flushed crimson, and in order to hide her confusion stooped down to pick up the  child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marriages  are made in heaven,&rdquo; she said, trying to pass the thing off lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand there&rsquo;s a tradition to that effect,&rdquo; responded Eustace, indolently. &ldquo;If  that is the case, it is a pity Heaven gives a woman to one man who doesn&rsquo;t care  about her, instead of bestowing her on another who cannot be happy without her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that your case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a pause, during which she looked at him curiously. He met her gaze calmly,  and not an idea of his meaning crossed her mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you love a married woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, and therefore no doubt am an object of horror in your eyes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  child had fallen asleep on her breast, and rising to her feet she walked slowly  to and fro, rocking him in her arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no right to judge you,&rdquo; she said evasively, &ldquo;but you can hardly expect me&mdash;a  wife and a mother&mdash;to say that I approve of such a dishonourable passion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  winced at the scorn of the last words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I cannot,&rdquo; he answered slowly, &ldquo;but let me put the case before you in another  way. Suppose a woman is married to a man who cares absolutely nothing about  her, neglects her in every way, insults her by his passion for another woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she cried, shrinking as if he had struck her a blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am putting a supposititious case, remember,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;Well, this woman  has a lover who adores her, but who has never ventured to express this passion,  which the world calls dishonourable. The woman returns that passion and has  only to say one word to the lover in order to be released from the curse of a  loveless marriage, a neglectful husband, an unhappy home. What should that  woman do in such a case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remain  true to her marriage vows,&rdquo; she said grandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if the husband is not true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she to sink to the level of the husband? No, Mr. Gartney. Let the wife shame  the husband by her fidelity to the vows which he has broken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the lover?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  not a true lover, or he would not wish to drag the woman he professes to love  through the mud of the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you would condemn two lives to perpetual misery for the sake of one man, who  does not appreciate the sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  for the sake of the one man, but for the sake of virtue, of honour, of  uprightness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  was silent under the cold purity of her look. This woman was no dreamer as he  had thought, but had a soul like that Roman Lucrece, who preferred death to  dishonour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  creed is severe,&rdquo; he said at last, with a frown on his strongly marked  features.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  creed is right,&rdquo; she replied simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  according to the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  according to God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  a rule, Gartney was not to be daunted by any woman, but there was something  about Alizon Errington that made him afraid to talk in his usual cynical vein.  Standing a short distance away, with the child in her arms and the golden glory  of the sunshine behind her, this young mother looked like the realisation of  the Madonna. So pure, so calm, so lovely, with the look of motherhood in her  eyes that he involuntarily turned away his head, as though he was not worthy to  profane such purity even by a glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  talk above my head,&rdquo; he said at length, rising to his feet, &ldquo;it is the language  of an ideal world, not to be realized in this matter-of-fact century. But if  you will forgive me, Lady Errington&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not call me Alizon?&rdquo; she said cordially. &ldquo;We are cousins, you know, and titles  are so formal&mdash;Eustace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very kind of you to grant me such permission,&rdquo; replied Gartney frankly, taking  the hand she held out to him. &ldquo;Goodbye&mdash;Alizon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  goodbye, but <i>au revoir</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I come over again?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. I am always glad to see you, besides Sammy loves his kind friend who  plays with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Their  eyes met, a wave of crimson passed over her face, and with an air of  displeasure, she turned away coldly, without answering his question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye,  Mr. Gartney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Seeing  that his freedom had offended her, he was too wise to make any further remark,  but bowing slightly walked slowly away.</p>
  <p>At  the end of the terrace he looked back, and saw she was bending over the  sleeping child, crooning some cradle-song to soothe his slumbers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  castle is well defended,&rdquo; he said bitterly, as he resumed his walk. &ldquo;I will  never succeed in entering that heart, for the child stands ever as sentinel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  mounted his horse and rode slowly down the avenue into the green arcade of  trees, through the boughs of which came golden shafts of sunlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  saint! a saint!&rdquo; he cried, touching his horse with the spur. &ldquo;And yet the saint  drove her husband to evil.&rdquo;</p>

    For My Child&rsquo;s Sake</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  look my dear boy in the face<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother&rsquo;s care!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was very dull down at Castle Grim, for even the bright sunshine of summer could  not lift the shadow which seemed to lower over the place. Eustace amused  himself as well as he could, strolling on the lonely beach, reading his books,  playing his piano, and occasionally visiting at Errington Hall, which he did  about three times a week.</p>
  <p>Alizon  was genuinely glad to see him, as in spite of her desire not to do so she  missed her husband more than she cared to say, and Gartney&rsquo;s bright, cheerful  talk was a great pleasure to her. Besides, the child was fond of him, and that  counted for a great deal in the eyes of the young mother, who was never tired  of telling her complaisant visitor about the pretty ways and infantile tricks  of her treasure.</p>
  <p>As  a rule, he rode over in the afternoon and stayed to dinner, after which, he  returned to Castle Grim in the shadows of the summer twilight. What long  conversations they used to have on the terrace in the gloaming, talks about  books, and the burning questions of the day, and travels in far distant lands.  Eustace found his companion singularly charming from an intellectual point of  view, as, during her lonely girlhood, she had read a great deal, and moreover,  remembered what she had read.</p>
  <p>They  never touched on the subject of their first conversation, however, as Alizon  entrenched herself within her reserve, and refused to be drawn into further  argument in the matter. Under these circumstances, Eustace was unable to tell  whether he had made any impression upon her, and was forced to play the part of  an ordinary friend, a <i>r&ocirc;le</i> not at all to his liking.</p>
  <p>After  all, it was very questionable whether this platonism would change to a warmer  feeling, as the cold demeanour of Alizon entirely forbade, in a tacit manner,  any over-stepping of the limit of friendship. Eustace, owing to his inherent  cynicism, and peculiar mode of life, had not much belief in woman, but this  time he was obliged to confess to himself that he had not entirely mastered the  feminine sex.</p>
  <p>He  loved her devotedly&mdash;the actual woman this time&mdash;for the pale, virginal vision  which had haunted his brain during his travels in Arabia had entirely vanished,  and in place of this unsatisfying dream, he adored the living, breathing woman  herself. Doubtless he invested the reality with many of the attributes of the  ideal, but, at the same time, he found in Alizon Errington the first companion  of the other sex, who satisfied his artistic eye and his intellectual desires.  Could he have married her, he would have been perfectly happy, and forgotten  the old, empty, aimless existence of the past, but, as it was impossible,  seeing she was the wife of another man, he could only stand outside the gates  of the Paradise he could never hope to enter, and envy the impossible.</p>
  <p>All  idea that his passion was dishonourable had now vanished, and his dearest hope  was that she should divorce her present husband, in order to become his wife.  Although he did not understand the actual circumstances of the case, he was  well aware that Alizon considered herself outraged by her husband&rsquo;s  companionship with Mrs. Veilsturm. He knew that Guy had shown a marked  preference for the society of Cleopatra, and, as he had followed his charmer  over to the Continent, Eustace began to actually believe that Errington was in  love with the beautiful Creole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Small  blame to him,&rdquo; thought Eustace to himself as he drove over to the Hall one  evening. &ldquo;She set her mind upon making a conquest of him, and when a woman does  that, a man may as well give in to the inevitable with a good grace. At all  events it&rsquo;s not my fault. I never spoke to Mrs. Veilsturm in any way. I never  told his wife about the affair, it&rsquo;s Fate and nothing else, and seeing that he  has forgotten all a husband&rsquo;s duties, they will never come together again, so I  don&rsquo;t see why I should not profit by the occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this way did Eustace pacify his conscience to his own satisfaction, although at  times he had an uneasy feeling that a good deal of hard, bitter truth underlay  all this sophistry. A good many weeks had gone by, and Lady Errington had come  to look upon him as a firm friend. Still, not being satisfied with this, and  suffering all the tortures of a restless mind, he determined, as soon as  possible, to find out if she was prepared to divorce her husband for his  infidelity, and, if so, thought he would plead his own cause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  there&rsquo;s a chance for me, I&rsquo;ll stay in England and try my hardest,&rdquo; he said to  himself as he alighted from the dog-cart at the Hall. &ldquo;If not, I&rsquo;ll go out to  Africa with Laxton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Javelrack  drove the dog-cart off in the direction of the stables, and Eustace, after one  look at the opaline evening sky, in which glimmered a pale star over the treetops,  went inside, where Lady Errington was expecting him to dinner.</p>
  <p>She  was in the little Dutch room, which was her favourite, and when Eustace was  announced by the servant, was standing by the table tossing Sammy in the air,  while Tasker, well pleased, waited to bear off the young gentleman to bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  my treasure?&rdquo; she cried, as Gartney approached her, &ldquo;he has come to say  good-night. Excuse me shaking hands, Eustace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  I yield to stronger claims,&rdquo; said Gartney, looking at the laughing child, and  at the happy young mother, in her long, white, dinner-dress. &ldquo;You ought to be  in your nursery, you young scamp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he ought,&rdquo; laughed Lady Errington, devouring the baby face with kisses, &ldquo;but he  cried for me so much that Nurse had to bring him down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  hollered, sir,&rdquo; confirmed Mrs. Tasker, placidly. &ldquo;I never did see sich a child  for his mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sweetest, dearest treasure in the world!&rdquo; said Alizon taking Sammy across to  his nurse, &ldquo;here, Nurse, take him&mdash;oh! he&rsquo;s got my flowers, naughty boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  indeed, Master Errington, crowing with delight, carried off a mangled geranium  in triumph to his nursery, kicking vigorously in Mrs. Tasker&rsquo;s strong arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  you idolize that child, Alizon,&rdquo; said Eustace enviously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is all I have in the world,&rdquo; she replied with a sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I  should do without him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  inspire the angels with envy,&rdquo; murmured Gartney, a little cruelly, &ldquo;it might be  dangerous for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  laid her hand on her heart with a cry, and a pallor over-spread her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is cruel to talk like that,&rdquo; she said hurriedly; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think he looks ill,  do you? He&rsquo;s such a strong child. There&rsquo;s no chance of his dying. Oh, Eustace,  you don&rsquo;t think that, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no! of course I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied, soothingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get these foolish  fancies into your head. Sammy will live to be a great trouble to you I&rsquo;ve no  doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  never be that,&rdquo; answered Lady Errington, recovering herself. &ldquo;Ah! there&rsquo;s the  gong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dinner  is served, my lady,&rdquo; announced a servant at the door, and taking Gartney&rsquo;s arm,  she went with him into the dining-room.</p>
  <p>It  was &ldquo;Alizon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eustace&rdquo; with them now, for after all, they were cousins, if  only by marriage, and it was so disagreeable to constantly use the formality of  titles. Still, there was always that indefinable barrier between them, which  kept Eustace within the limits of kindly friendship, and on her part, Alizon  never forgot her dignity as a married woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very kind of you, Alizon, to take pity on a poor hermit,&rdquo; said Gartney, towards  the end of the meal, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know what the county will say at this <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  county can hardly complain, seeing we are cousins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  by marriage,&rdquo; she assented, changing the conversation from such a distasteful  subject, which reminded her of Guy. &ldquo;By the way, Eustace, I want you to sing to  me this evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I do that pretty nearly every time I come over,&rdquo; replied Eustace,  smiling. &ldquo;Is there anything special you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember your improvisation at Como about the fairy and the nightingale. It was  very charming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you remember that?&rdquo; he cried, his face lighting up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was too delightful to  forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  laughed a trifle disbelievingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that genuine, or a society romance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  always say what I mean,&rdquo; she answered, with cold dignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad everybody else does not,&rdquo; retorted Gartney fervently. &ldquo;What a disagreeable  world it would be, if that was the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very honest world, at all events.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  therefore disagreeable&mdash;the two are inseparable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should they be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  why shouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; said Eustace meaningly. &ldquo;If the truth was pleasant, nobody  would mind hearing it, but then the truth is not always pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the fault of the person spoken of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay, but he doesn&rsquo;t look at it in that philosophical light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are as cynical as ever,&rdquo; she said with a sigh, as she arose to leave the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fault of the world, as I said before,&rdquo; he responded, opening the door. &ldquo;I would  like to believe in my fellow-creatures, only they won&rsquo;t let me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  she had vanished, he returned to his wine, and began to ponder over her words.  He saw plainly enough that she did not care about him at all, but with  ingrained vanity and egotism would not admit the coldness to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  try what a song can do,&rdquo; he thought, as he followed her to the drawing-room. &ldquo;I  can say in a song what I dare not say in plain words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of  course, Lady Errington had run up to the nursery to take a look at the baby,  but shortly afterwards came down with an apology, to find Eustace seated at the  piano.</p>
  <p>Outside  was the luminous twilight of July, with a pale, starlit sky, arched over the  prim Dutch garden. The windows were open, and a warm breath of summer, heavy  with the perfume of flowers, floated into the room. The sombre trees stood  black and dense against the clear sky, the garden was filled with wavering  shadows, and a nightingale was singing deliciously in the heart of the still  leaves as the bats glided like ghosts through the air. Lady Errington  established herself in a comfortable chair near the open window, with a white  wrap as a protection against the falling dews, and Eustace, sitting at the  Erard, in the bright light of the lamp, ran his fingers delicately over the  keys.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can I do against that immortal music?&rdquo; he said absently, alluding to the  nightingale.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Hark  how the bursts come crowding through the trees.<br>
What passion, and what pain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t know Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s poems, I suppose, Lady Errington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you are wrong there,&rdquo; she replied quietly. &ldquo;I am very fond of his melancholy  verse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  melancholy,&rdquo; he answered musingly. &ldquo;I agree with you there. I wonder, if in the  whole range of English literature, there is a more bitterly true line than that  famous one:</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo; &lsquo;We  mortal millions live alone.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not my favourite,&rdquo; said Alizon dreamily, &ldquo;I like that couplet:</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo; &lsquo;And  bade betwixt their shores to be<br>
  The unplumb&rsquo;d salt estranging sea.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means very much the same thing,&rdquo; observed Eustace after a pause, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s in  the same poem, I think. But how true it is! Lovers, friends, married or single,  we all live alone, isolated by the &lsquo;estranging sea.&rsquo; No one really knows the  heart of a fellow-creature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  surely if a perfect harmony exists&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is always a something,&rdquo; said Gartney decisively, &ldquo;like the perfume of a flower,  the sigh of a wind, the throb of joy in the voice of a bird, that escapes us  utterly. It is felt, but cannot be communicated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  sad idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  sad, but alas, very true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a silence between them for a few minutes, only broken by the song of the  hidden bird and the ripple of notes from the piano, and then Eustace, with a  deep sigh, shook off his sombre thoughts and spoke cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must sing you something, Lady Errington,&rdquo; he said lightly, &ldquo;all this conversation  will make you melancholy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like to feel melancholy. It&rsquo;s suitable to the hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I must make my song the same,&rdquo; he observed gaily, and thereupon played a soft  dreamy prelude, at the end of which his sweet, sympathetic voice arose tenderly  on the still air:</p>
  <p class="quote">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I  love a star that shines above<br>
  When  day is blending with the night,<br>
  Alas,  what pain this foolish love,<br>
  Such  worship brings but cold delight.<br>
  I  cannot scale the twilight sky,<br>
  My  love to tell in accents sweet;<br>
  It  comes not down altho&rsquo; I sigh,<br>
  And  so my star I ne&rsquo;er can meet.</p>
  <p class="quote">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Oh  foolish heart! oh cruel star!<br>
  Your  love I dare not hope to gain;<br>
  Yet  still you shine each night afar,<br>
  To  mock my anguish and my pain<br>
  And  yet thou art so sweet, so pure,<br>
  I  may not&mdash;dare not thee forsake;<br>
  For  tho&rsquo; this pain for aye endure<br>
  I&rsquo;ll  love thee&mdash;but my heart will break.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  story of an impossible love,&rdquo; said Lady Errington when he ended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  It is called &lsquo;My Star in Heaven.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if any man loved so hopelessly and purely&mdash;absurd!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are more varieties of the human race than you know of, Alizon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt. But I&rsquo;m not particularly impressed with those I have met with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are talking of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am talking of my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  left the piano and stepped outside into the beautiful still night. The moon was  looking over the fantastic gables of the hall, and filled the garden with  trembling shadows. It was exquisitely beautiful, but human beings bring the  prose of life into all the poetry of Nature. Eustace did so now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I smoke a cigarette, Alizon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  lighted a cigarette and leaned against the wall of the house, watching the  ghostly curls of smoke melting in the moonshine. Both were silent for a few  minutes, occupied with their own thoughts, and then Eustace spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you divorce your husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington started violently, for, strange to say, she was thinking of the same  thing. She felt inclined to resent Gartney&rsquo;s plain speaking, but the light from  the lamp was striking full on his grave face, and, seeing how much in earnest  he was, she changed her mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall never do that,&rdquo; she replied quietly, with a slight shiver. It might have  been the night air or the idea of divorce, but she shivered as she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you ask? Think of the disgrace it would be to the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was all over. Eustace had an intuitive feeling that the last word had been said  on the subject. She would never divorce her husband, she would never listen to  his offers of affection, for the child was at once her safeguard and her idol.</p>
  <p>Had  he been wise he would have said nothing more. Not being wise, however, he did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been very kind to me, Alizon,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;very&mdash;very kind, and I  shall treasure your kindness in my heart when I leave you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you going?&rdquo; she asked in a startled tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to Africa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  best of all possible reasons. I love you too well for my own peace of mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Errington arose, with a slight cry, from her chair, and stood looking at him  with wild eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been,&rdquo; he answered sadly, &ldquo;but I am mad no longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  put out her hand to grasp the back of the chair and steady herself, still  looking at him in amazement. She was not indignant&mdash;she was not angered&mdash;she was  simply bewildered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; she said at length, in a dull tone. &ldquo;What are you saying  to me? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that I love you too well for my own peace of mind,&rdquo; he said steadily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love  me?&mdash;the wife of another man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you sit down, Lady Errington?&rdquo; observed Eustace, in a measured tone; &ldquo;I will  tell you all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot listen. Such words from you are an insult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not say so when you hear what I have to tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alizon  sat down again in her chair, clasped her slender hands together, then, looking  steadily at his face, made a sign for him to go on, but otherwise gave no token  of emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I met you at Como,&rdquo; said Eustace, his usually slow enunciation quickened by a  powerful emotion, &ldquo;I fell in love with you. Ah, you need not make that gesture  of indignation&mdash;the passion was none of my seeking. The most virtuous woman  could take no exception to such unrequited homage. I always was a strange man  in my likes and dislikes, as you have no doubt heard. Never before had I met a  woman I cared about. They tired me with their falseness and follies, but in you  I saw for the first time an ideal which had been in my mind for many years. I  dared not speak, as you were the wife of my cousin, and it would have been  dishonourable, therefore I went away, and for many months strove to forget.  Nature, however, was stronger than I was, and when I came back and saw you  again, I found that I was more in love than ever. Still I said nothing, and  kept out of your presence as much as I was able. Through the difference between  yourself and Guy, I was unavoidably forced to see you often. What could I do? A  man&rsquo;s passions are not always under his control. All women are not as pure and  cold as you. I was afraid of myself, I was afraid of you, and in order to solve  the difficulty I did my best to bring you and Guy together. I spoke to you&mdash;I  spoke to Guy&mdash;but all was useless. He has gone back to Mrs. Veilsturm, and  forgets with her all his duties to you. I do not say he is right, but I say he  is much to be pitied. Still, whatever my feelings may be towards him, the  actual facts remain the same. He is with another woman, and you are left alone  in the world. I foolishly dreamed that it might be my fate to release you from  this unhappy position. I thought you might divorce the husband who has wronged you,  but you refuse to do so, for the sake of the child. Ah, that is the god of your  idolatry&mdash;you care for nothing in the world save your child. It is the selfish  passion of motherhood&mdash;pure, good, elevating &mdash;but still selfish. It is the child  that came between you and your husband&mdash;it is the child who comes now between  you and me. My love remains unaltered&mdash;it will always be the same&mdash;and had you  been free I might have spoken to you without dishonour. You refuse to loosen  the bonds of your loveless marriage, and as I cannot be your lover or your  husband, I dare not be your friend. Your husband is parted from you&mdash;he will  never return. I am going away on a perilous journey&mdash;I will never return.  Therefore you will be alone with what you love best in the world&mdash;your child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  her clear eyes fixed steadily on his face she heard him to the end of this long  speech without a quiver of the eyelids&mdash;without the trembling of her lip&mdash;and  when he finished:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I am the married woman you said you loved?&rdquo; she asked coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  and you say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say now what I said then,&rdquo; she answered sternly, &ldquo;no man can be a true lover if  he would wish to drag the woman he loves through the mud of the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  flushed deeply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  misunderstand me,&rdquo; he said hurriedly; &ldquo;I do not want to drag you down. I would  not have spoken, only I thought a divorce&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  divorce!&rdquo; she echoed, rising to her feet, &ldquo;and what is that but dishonour to me  and to the child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always  the child,&rdquo; he said sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why not? The only pure thing in the world I have to love. My husband has  deceived me. You have changed from a friend to a lover. I cannot listen to you  without dishonour. What you said was perfectly true&mdash;my love for the child is  the selfish passion of motherhood. I pardon the words which you have spoken to  me to-night, but we must never meet again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will not,&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely, &ldquo;I leave England for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we understand each other, and nothing now remains but to say goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you no word of pity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry for your foolish passion,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;but can I say more  without lowering myself in your eyes?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;you  are right. It is best for me to go. The star will never come down from Heaven  for me, but it will always shine there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  caught her hand and touched it with his hot lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye,  Alizon. God&mdash;God bless you, my dearest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  it a fancy that a burning tear had fallen on her chill hand? She looked, and  lo! her hand was wet. The door had closed&mdash;she was alone in the room, deserted  both by husband and lover.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Eustace,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;I am sorry for his madness; but if he is unhappy I  also am miserable. My husband and friend have both left me, but I have always  my child.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_36"></a>Chapter 36<br>
    The Death Of The First-Born</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Dead!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead!<br>
  His soul hath sped,<br>
  The turf lies over his golden head.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Cold!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold!<br>
  In churchyard mould,<br>
  And just one stroke hath the death-bell tolled.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Child!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child!<br>
  The angels smiled,<br>
  Then carried thee heavenward undefiled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  the departure of Eustace, life went on in the same old fashion at the Hall.  Alizon passed her days and nights with Sammy, received the few visitors that  called, and was as happy as she could be under the circumstances. She deeply  regretted the kind friend who had been such a comfort to her in her loneliness,  but looking back on what she had done, could not wish things otherwise. True,  he had spoken most delicately, and in such a way as could offend no woman,  still she was glad that he had gone, as his presence would have been a  perpetual reminder to her of his unhappy passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I had married him,&rdquo; she thought sometimes, &ldquo;perhaps he would have made me a  better husband than Guy. But no! his love was a mere passion of envy, wishing  for what he could not obtain. Had I been single, very probably he would not  have spoken to me as he did. The fact that I am the wife of another man is the  true reason of his desire that I should love him. Ah! these men, they are all  the same. Eustace is a poet, and his pleading was more delicate than another  man&rsquo;s would have been, but his instincts resemble those of the rest of his sex.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  she talked to herself, trying to harden her heart against the misery of the man  who loved her so devotedly and hopelessly. He was going away from England, to  exile, perhaps to death, and all for her sake; even the least vain of woman  could not but feel a thrill of responsive feeling to such unutterable worship.  But whenever she found herself thinking in this dangerous fashion, she tried to  change the current of her thoughts. She was the wife of Guy Errington, and,  little as he deserved it, he had a right to expect entire purity of thought and  deed in his wife, yet, in spite of her Puritanical nature, she dreamed at times  of the unhappy exile whose love she had rejected.</p>
  <p>Guy  never wrote to his wife, nor gave any sign of existence, and she, on her part,  acted in the same way, so it seemed as if their lives were parted for ever. Yet  she frequently thought about him and began to believe that she had been too  harsh in her judgment. If such was the case, let him come back and ask her  forgiveness. If he did so&mdash;well she might pardon him, and then&mdash;but no, there  could never be any trust or affection between them. The phantom of the past  would always come between them; so far as she could see, nothing remained to  make her life happy but the child.</p>
  <p>Sammy  was the idol of her heart. She forgot everything when she had him in her arms,  and she felt that the whole world might go to ruin as long as this blue-eyed  darling was left untouched, safe on the tender bosom of his mother. In her  daily life she adapted all things to suit the living of her child, and never  knew a happy moment when she was away from his side.</p>
  <p>The  first thing in the morning the child was brought down to her bedroom, and  sprawled on the coverlet, while she lay looking at him with happy eyes,  babbling fond nonsense suited to his baby understanding. When he slept in the  morning she sat beside his crib watching the flushed little face, the tangled  golden curls, and the tiny dimpled hands. She went out with him for his daily  drive, accompanied by Mrs. Tasker, and would hardly let that worthy woman touch  him, so jealous she was of his liking for anyone save herself. He played at her  feet for hours, and she sat beside him in a low chair singing tender little  songs, playing baby games, amusing him with his toys, and when he grew fretful  with wakefulness, lulled him to sleep on her breast. Every hour of the day she  found some new perfection in him, she was never tired of talking about his  clever ways, his infantile wisdom, his loving disposition, and when he was laid  to rest at night, she hung over him like an enamoured lover breathing blessings  on his unconscious head.</p>
  <p>The  world will doubtless laugh at such tender devotion, at such intense absorption  in an unformed infant, but no one but a woman, no one but a mother, can  understand the wondrous power of maternal love that dominates every other  feeling in the feminine heart. All the passion of lovers, the ecstacies of  poets, the blind adoration of men for those they love, pale before this strongest  of all feelings implanted in the human breast. Perhaps some will say that  self-preservation is stronger, but this is not so, as a mother in an extreme  case will sacrifice her life for that of her child, thereby proving the  superiority of the maternal feeling.</p>
  <p>In  this worship of the child she forgot earth, she forgot heaven, she forgot God.</p>
  <p>And  God punished her.</p>
  <p>Sammy  was cutting his teeth, and was feverish and fretful for some days, but although  every care was lavished upon him neither Alizon nor Mrs. Tasker deemed the  illness to be anything worse than a slight infantile malady. But one evening,  Alizon bending over his sleeping form, saw his face grow black, his little  limbs begin to twitch, and in a moment the poor child was in strong  convulsions. Pale with terror, she shrieked for Mrs. Tasker and sent off a  groom at once for the village doctor who had attended to Sammy since his birth.  Mrs. Tasker, terribly anxious, yet restraining herself so as not to affright  the agonised mother, did what she could under the circumstances and placed the  child in a hot bath. The doctor arrived as quickly as possible, but he was too  late&mdash;the child was dead.</p>
  <p>Dead!</p>
  <p>When  the doctor told her, she could not believe it, and throwing herself on her  knees beside the tiny corpse, tried in vain to see some sign of life. Alas it  was all in vain, and after an hour of agonising dread she was obliged to accept  the inevitable.</p>
  <p>She  did not lament, she did not weep, but only sat in dumb tearless silence by the  side of her dead child. One thing only she muttered, with ashen lips, and  restless hands plucking at her dress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the judgment of God, because I loved His creature better than Himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  is no grief so terrible as that silent, self-concentrated agony which gives no  sign. All through the lonely hours of the night she sat beside the crib, where  all that she held dearest and best was lying stiff and cold, the tiny hands  crossed on the breast, a smile on the placid little face. They tried in vain to  persuade her to go to bed, to take some refreshment, to leave the room where  the dead child lay, but all in vain, for rejecting all offers of consolation  and kindness, she sat frozen with grief in the darkened room.</p>
  <p>The  morning came, the time that she had been accustomed to hear the merry little  voice and see the happy face, but the voice was silent now for evermore, and  the face&mdash;could that still, white mask be the face she had seen smiling in her  own, the face that she had covered so often with kisses? She could not cry,  although tears would have been a relief, she could not talk, although it would  have eased her pain, she could only sit in a trance of speechless, thoughtless  horror beside her dead.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tasker, wise old woman that she was, knew that unless something was done, and that  speedily, to rouse her mistress from this apathetic state, there would be  danger of the mind becoming unhinged, so finding out Mr. Gartney&rsquo;s address in  London, which she obtained by sending over to Castle Grim, sent a telegram and  afterwards a letter to him urging him to bring the husband, the father, to the  stricken mother.</p>
  <p>Eustace  was leading an aimless life in Town, when he received the news, and was  terribly grieved about it. Without delay, he wired to Errington at San Remo,  and then wrote to Victoria at Dunkeld Castle, asking her to come at once to the  unhappy woman. Mrs. Macjean, much moved by the intelligence, came south without  delay, in company with her husband, and went down to the Hall. The sight of the  young bride&rsquo;s kind face did more good to Lady Errington than anything else, and  after all the apathy and horror of those dark days succeeding the death, the  blessed tears came to relieve her overburdened heart. The two women wept in one  another&rsquo;s arms, and hand in hand stood by the little coffin wherein lay the  tiny body of the child. Otterburn kept out of their way as much as he could,  feeling that his rough masculine nature was but ill-suited to this house of  mourning, but attended to all the details of the funeral pending the arrival of  Errington.</p>
  <p>And  Guy?</p>
  <p>Surely  he would come over now that his child was dead, come over to bury his  first-born and console the afflicted mother! Eustace waited hopefully for a  telegram saying that he was on his way, but at length received a wire asking  him to come over to San Remo and see his cousin there. He crushed the telegram  up in his hand with an oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  God!&rdquo; he said to himself in dismay, &ldquo;surely that woman cannot have besotted him  so far that he cannot come to the funeral of his own child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not hesitate a moment, but wrote a letter to Otterburn at the Hall, telling  him he was going over to San Remo to bring back Errington, and then, hastily  packing a few things, started from Victoria Station for the Continent.</p>
  <p>During  the last few weeks since his departure from Castle Grim, he had arranged all  his affairs prior to his departure for Africa. Laxton was still in Town as,  Otterburn being married, he had not been able to find anyone to go with him as  a companion, so when Eustace offered himself, he was greatly delighted. It had  been Laxton&rsquo;s intention to go down to Cape Town, but Gartney persuaded him to  alter his destination to the Nile, and, go far up into Nubia, in order to  follow in the footsteps of Speke and Bruce. This arrangement was satisfactory, and  Eustace and his friend began to arrange everything for their trip, which now  began to assume more the appearance of an exploring expedition than a mere  shooting excursion.</p>
  <p>When  he had to go to San Remo in order to bring back Guy, all the preparations were  left in Laxton&rsquo;s hands, which did not, by any means, prove irksome to that  young man, as he was going in heart and soul for the business.</p>
  <p>Eustace,  as he stood on the deck of a Channel steamer in the dark night, drinking in the  sea breezes, thought all the time of the woman he loved kneeling beside the  open coffin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has nothing to care for now,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;God has taken away her idol,  so if I bring back Guy with me, she will forgive and love him for coming to her  in her sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  fact was, that for the first time in his life Gartney was sacrificing self for  the benefit of other people. Hitherto he had gratified without scruple all his  egotistical desires, but the hopeless love he cherished for Alizon Ellington  had brought to light the nobler traits of his nature, and probably he was never  a better man than now, when he was striving to bring wife and husband together  for their mutual happiness before leaving his native country for an everlasting  exile, and perchance death in a savage land.</p>

    The Truth About Mrs. Veilsturm</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;We  all have skeletons, everyone,<br>
    We hide away from the cheerful sun,<br>
    Tearful and sad, or merry and gay,<br>
    We all have skeletons hidden away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  duly arrived at San Remo, tired out by his long journey, and, as he had written  to Guy before leaving London, was rather surprised not to find his cousin  waiting for him at the railway station. However, he took the matter  philosophically enough, after his usual fashion, although he was seriously  annoyed at what seemed like wilful negligence, and drove to the Hotel de la  Mer, where Errington was staying. There he found Guy&rsquo;s valet awaiting his  arrival in the hall, and speedily received an explanation, from which it  appeared that Errington was seriously ill, and confined to his bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would have come myself, sir,&rdquo; concluded the man, &ldquo;but Sir Guy wouldn&rsquo;t let me  leave him, and I&rsquo;ve just slipped down stairs for a moment to explain things. I&rsquo;m  very glad you&rsquo;ve come, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I,&rdquo; thought Eustace, as he followed the servant upstairs, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t any idea  he was ill. No wonder he could not come to England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  he entered the bedroom he found his cousin was really seriously ill, being in a  highly excited state. He asked Eustace all kinds of questions about Alizon,  about the death of the child, and talked incoherently about Mrs. Veilsturm,  mixing everything up in a most nonsensical fashion, being evidently quite  light-headed. Gartney answered his questions, and soothed him as well as he was  able, but was very much perturbed over the matter, although he did not show his  real feelings. At last he got Guy to lie down quietly, and then, leaving the  room, sent for the doctor who was attending the young man.</p>
  <p>In  a few minutes Dr. Storge arrived, a tall, spare man, with a keen, clever face,  and a sharp manner, who talked straight and to the point, without any loss of  time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; he replied briskly to Eustace&rsquo;s enquiry. &ldquo;Sir Guy is very ill,  indeed. In a highly excited state brought on by worry and fretting. I saw that  he was in a bad way about a week ago, when he first consulted me, but something  he will not tell me about has occurred since then, and the result&mdash;well you see  it upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  surely&mdash;when&mdash;Errington consulted you, he explained&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  explained nothing, my dear sir, and now he is so ill that I dare not ask him,  as it makes him excited, and that is what I wish to avoid. Perhaps you can give  me some idea of what is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I can. Is it necessary you should know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the good of calling in a medical man if you don&rsquo;t intend to confide in him?&rdquo;  said Storge coolly. &ldquo;You know what Balzac says, that a man reveals nothing to  the priest, what suits him to the lawyer, and everything to the physician. I  want to find out the cause of Sir Guy&rsquo;s excitement, and then I may do some  good. As it is&mdash;well, you see for yourself, I am working in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  reasoning appeared to be very just, so Gartney, making a virtue of necessity,  drew his chair close to that of the doctor, and told him everything.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fact is,&rdquo; said Eustace after a pause, during which he collected his thoughts, &ldquo;my  cousin and his wife have had a quarrel about a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  I thought as much&mdash;Mrs. Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  You know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  absolutely nothing,&rdquo; replied the doctor sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only put two and two  together, and any fool knows that makes four&mdash;more or less.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Sir Guy loves his wife very dearly, but she believes that he has compromised  himself with&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know if I ought to tell you this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Storge made a gesture of despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you were a man of the world, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;but  although I appreciate your delicacy with regard to&mdash;well, say our mutual friend,  though I only know her by sight&mdash;I must insist upon you telling me all. &lsquo;Go on,  my dear sir, go on. Your confession is as safe with me as it would be with one  of those dingy priests in the town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Being  satisfied with this explanation, Gartney smothered his scruples, and went on  talking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see it&rsquo;s no use beating about the bush, doctor. My cousin has quarrelled with  his wife on account of Mrs. Veilsturm, whom he loves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, No,&rdquo; interrupted Storge smartly, &ldquo;you mean she loves him&mdash;a vastly different  thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  She doesn&rsquo;t care two straws about him,&rdquo; said Eustace bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you don&rsquo;t explain, Mr. Gartney,&rdquo; cried the doctor angrily, &ldquo;you will have me as  bad as your friend upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  listen, my dear sir, and pray don&rsquo;t interrupt me,&rdquo; said Eustace tartly. &ldquo;Mrs.  Veilsturm, who is a lady holding a good position in London Society, thought  herself slighted by Lady Errington&mdash;in what way it does not matter. She  determined to revenge herself by taking Lady Errington&rsquo;s husband away from her,  and she has succeeded. My cousin does not really care for Mrs. Veilsturm, but,  owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding with his wife, he has drifted into a  false position. This woman has entangled him in her net and won&rsquo;t let him go  until she can bring about a divorce, which will certainly be the end.  Errington, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, has worried himself into a fever over things,  thinking he is between the devil and the deep sea, and the other day his only  child died, so I expect the news of the death put the finishing stroke to the  whole business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; said Storge, who had been listening attentively, &ldquo;I can quite  appreciate the position, and need hardly tell you Mr. Gartney, that your cousin  is dangerously ill. He is an honourable man, who finds himself in a  dishonourable position, through no fault of his own, and the knowledge has  worked him up into a state of frenzy. I am afraid of brain fever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Heavens I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid so,&rdquo; returned the doctor sagaciously, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s quite off the balance, with  all this business. However, now you are here, things may turn out better, for  he must be kept quiet&mdash;perfect rest is what is needed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  Mrs. Veilsturm away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she surely doesn&rsquo;t visit him,&rdquo; said Eustace in an astonished tone, &ldquo;because, in  the first place, she doesn&rsquo;t care for him, and in the second, she&rsquo;s too  cautious to jeopardise her position in Society.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  does not exactly visit him,&rdquo; replied Storge, rising, &ldquo;but she sends messages,  flowers, fruit, three-cornered notes, and all that rubbish. Of course it keeps  Errington perpetually thinking about her&mdash;then he thinks about his wife, and  between the two I&rsquo;m afraid of the result.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll go and see Mrs. Veilsturm,&rdquo; said Eustace grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt I&rsquo;ll be  able to persuade her to leave my cousin alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t envy you the interview,&rdquo; observed Storge, who was a sharp observer, &ldquo;nor  her either. Still she&rsquo;s a fine woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fine devil,&rdquo; retorted Gartney, with less than his usual caution.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  looks like it,&rdquo; said the doctor coolly, going to the door. &ldquo;A Creole, isn&rsquo;t  she?&mdash;ah! I thought so. Got a considerable touch of the tiger in her I should  say. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to be under her claws&mdash;too risky. Well I&rsquo;ll go up and see  our patient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;ll go and see Mrs. Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better have your lunch first,&rdquo; said Storge &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need all your strength.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good advice, Doctor, I&rsquo;ll adopt it; at the same time don&rsquo;t be afraid of me&mdash;I&rsquo;m  a match for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Storge  laughed and looked keenly at Gartney&rsquo;s powerful face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I think you are,&rdquo; he said carelessly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read your looks&mdash;goodbye at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  the Doctor had vanished, Eustace sat down to consider the situation, which was  certainly rather problematic at present, especially with regard to the  Errington-Veilsturm episode. When a strikingly handsome and decidedly  unscrupulous woman sets her heart upon turning the head of a disconsolate man,  with a somewhat weak character, she generally succeeds in her task. Guy had  been certainly rather weak with regard to the sex feminine in his bachelor  days, but since marriage, his love for his wife had been a safeguard against  the dangerous raids of daring free-lances. Owing to his unfortunate quarrel  with Alizon, however, he had lost his shield, and of this Mrs. Veilsturm had  taken instant advantage, securing thereby an indisputable victory.</p>
  <p>In  England, Gartney had felt some doubts regarding the entanglement of his cousin  with Cleopatra, but now he saw plainly that Guy was still true to his wife, and  that it required the utmost dexterity of his charmer to keep her captive in  chains. If he could only be brought face to face with his wife, Eustace was  convinced that everything could be arranged, and the influence of Mrs.  Veilsturm over this weak soul destroyed. He would like to have written to  Alizon, and asked her to come over in order to nurse him, and be reconciled to  her husband, but he was afraid she would not do so. The only thing to be done,  therefore, was to try and get Errington cured as soon as possible, and take him  away from the dangerous neighbourhood of Cleopatra.</p>
  <p>In  order to do this, according to the doctor, it was necessary to force Mrs.  Veilsturm to leave her victim alone, as she brought herself constantly to his  mind, and exercised a malignant influence upon his whole nature highly  detrimental to recovery. Eustace, therefore, agreed with the doctor, that the  first thing to be done was to deal with Mrs. Veilsturm, and this he made up his  mind to do without delay. As Guy could not be removed from the neighbourhood of  Mrs. Veilsturm, the next best thing was to remove Mrs. Veilsturm from the  neighbourhood of Guy, or, in plain words, to make her leave San Remo at once.  It was a difficult task, and involved a disagreeable interview; still,  desperate diseases require desperate remedies, so Eustace wasted no time in  hesitation, but determined to call upon Mrs. Veilsturm that afternoon.</p>
  <p>As  Mr. Gartney was nothing if not methodical, he proceeded very deliberately with  his preparations, and, truth to tell, felt rather jubilant at the prospect of a  tussle with Cleopatra, who was a foeman, or rather foewoman, worthy of anyone&rsquo;s  steel. After a cold bath, which invigorated him considerably after his tiresome  journey, he changed his travelling suit for one more in conformity with an  afternoon visit, and then made an early luncheon, followed by a soothing cigar.  His physical wants thus having been attended to, he ascertained from the &ldquo;Liste  d&rsquo;&Eacute;trangers,&rdquo; that Mrs. Veilsturm was staying at the Villa Garcia, and departed  on his errand of mercy.</p>
  <p>Cleopatra  had certainly an aptitude for making herself comfortable, for the Villa Garcia  was a charming little house, with white walls, vivid green shutters, and dusky,  red-tiled roof. Embosomed among the grey olive trees and slender palms, it  stood some distance back from the Corso Imperatrice, and from its broad terrace  there could be seen the tideless blue of the Mediterranean Sea, the church of  the Madonna della Guardia on Capo Verde, and sometimes a glimpse of far-off  Corsica floating in a golden mist, or lying amid the rose-red clouds of dawn,  like Br&uuml;nnhilde within the magic circle of Wotan&rsquo;s fire.</p>
  <p>Happily  for Eustace the lady he sought was at home, so on sending in his card, he was  conducted to an artificially darkened drawing-room, where Mrs. Veilsturm was  seated in a comfortable-looking chair, occupied with a French novel and a fan.  No one was with her, as Major Griff had gone off with Thambits and Mr. Jiddy  for a day&rsquo;s pleasure at Monte Carlo and, Errington not being obtainable, Mrs.  Veilsturm was delighted to see Eustace, who was much more amusing than her own  thoughts. She was arrayed in a loose dress of white Chinese silk, with great  masses of scarlet geranium at her throat and waist, which suited her so well  that Eustace, with a view to making everything pleasant, could not help  congratulating her on her appearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know I&rsquo;m looking well,&rdquo; said Cleopatra indolently, as Gartney settled himself  in a low chair near her. &ldquo;The South always agrees with me so much better than  that smoky London. That comes of being a daughter of the Tropics I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look in your proper place under a burning sky,&rdquo; observed Eustace poetically. &ldquo;There  is more of the gorgeous cactus about you than the English rose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I to take that as a compliment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  women would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay, but then you see I&rsquo;m unlike most women,&rdquo; replied Cleopatra, fanning  herself slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a good thing I think myself. What a horrible idea  to be a replica of half a dozen of one&rsquo;s dearest enemies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any enemies?&rdquo; asked Eustace, looking keenly at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plenty!  principally of my own sex I think. It doesn&rsquo;t trouble me, however, as I think  it is rather a distinction than otherwise. A person without enemies must be  without character. By-the-way, Mr. Gartney, I haven&rsquo;t asked you what you are  doing in San Remo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too hot to answer riddles,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Veilsturm languidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t  tell. Restoring your health, writing a book, hiding from your friends. There, I&rsquo;ve  given you a choice of three answers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  of which are right. I&rsquo;ve come over to attend to my cousin Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  devoted of you,&rdquo; said the lady ironically. &ldquo;I was not aware you were so fond of  your cousin as all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you not?&rdquo; answered Eustace nonchalantly. &ldquo;Rather an oversight on your part,  seeing that Errington and myself have been close friends all our lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  angry colour glowed in Cleopatra&rsquo;s swarthy face as she detected a covert  insolence in this reply, but, having a sharp tongue of her own, she lost no  time in answering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  I see, like does not always draw to like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not in this case, but the reverse is true. I am not a bit like Errington in any  way. For example, I can always take care of myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Sir Guy cannot, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  when there&rsquo;s a woman in the case, as there is now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Veilsturm had never liked Eustace, as he knew more about her former life than  she cared he should, but being an eminently diplomatic woman she had always  treated him as a friend. Now, however, she saw that his attitude was distinctly  hostile, and prepared to give battle. They were now matching their wits against  one another, and each knew it would take wonderful skill and cautious dealing  in order to come off victor in such a remarkably equal contest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Veilsturm, after a pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try,&rdquo;  responded Eustace curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you understand well enough, only you won&rsquo;t admit it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know, Mr. Gartney, you are very rude?&rdquo; said the Creole quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;  cried Eustace angrily, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use our fencing with buttons on the foils. I&rsquo;ve  come here for a certain purpose, and you know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Veilsturm doggedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  so blind as those who won&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pithy,&rdquo;  retorted Cleopatra sneeringly, &ldquo;very pithy, but irrelevant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all, as I will soon show you. Look here, Mrs. Veilsturm, I&rsquo;m going to be plain,  brutally plain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  do you justice you generally are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is necessary in some cases, especially in this one,&rdquo; said Gartney quietly, &ldquo;but  I&rsquo;m not here to discuss my personal character, but to save my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  me, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly!  I did not think you would have admitted that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had made a false move in doing so, and saw that Eustace had taken advantage of  her rashness, so, throwing down her book, she sat straight up in her chair, and  spoke with firm deliberation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  talking nonsense, my dear Mr. Gartney, which is a thing I don&rsquo;t care about. You  say you have come here for a certain purpose, perhaps you&rsquo;ll be kind enough to  tell me the meaning of that remark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  replied Gartney promptly. &ldquo;I know all about the way you consider yourself to  have been slighted by Lady Errington. I know that you have tried your best to  inveigle Errington into your net in order to be revenged, and I&rsquo;ve come here to  ask you to leave my cousin alone, and leave San Remo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very cool request, upon my word,&rdquo; cried the Creole viciously, with an evil  smile on her angry face, &ldquo;but one I don&rsquo;t intend to comply with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it will be as well for you to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  sprang to her feet in a fury, and stood looking at him, with clenched hands and  face convulsed with rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  threaten me, do you?&rdquo; she shrieked savagely. &ldquo;How dare you&mdash;how dare you? I  shall tell Major Griff&mdash;I shall tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  tell no one,&rdquo; said Gartney calmly, &ldquo;that is, you won&rsquo;t if you are wise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cleopatra  stood silent for a moment, struggling with her temper, then, stamping her foot,  walked rapidly up and down the room, Eustace watching her meanwhile, with a  sardonic smile on his lips. He, also, had risen to his feet, as, knowing  Maraquita&rsquo;s temper of old, he thought it wise to be prepared for possibilities.  At last the lady collected herself sufficiently to talk quietly, and stopping  opposite her antagonist, spoke in a low, suppressed voice, which was far more  deadly in its meaning than the first outburst of wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you say, we may as well take the buttons off the foils. Consider them removed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far, so good,&rdquo; assented Eustace, not taking his eyes off her. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  still remember your Spanish, I see,&rdquo; he said mockingly, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re not in South  America now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish we were,&rdquo; she hissed savagely, bringing her beautiful, distorted face so  close to his own that he felt her hot breath on his cheek. &ldquo;Oh, I wish we were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied, without blenching. &ldquo;You might treat me as you did Manuel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No!&rdquo; she cried, a terrified expression flitting across her face. &ldquo;Not that  name!&mdash;not that name here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let us keep to the subject in hand,&rdquo; said Eustace politely.</p>
  <p>If  a look could have killed Gartney, he would have there and then fallen dead at  the feet of the Creole, but suddenly changing her tactics, she flung herself on  the sofa in a storm of tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  cruel you are, oh, how cruel,&rdquo; she wailed, hiding her face in the cushions. &ldquo;I  am only a woman, you coward&mdash;only a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a remarkably good actress, my dear Mrs. Veilsturm;&rdquo; replied Eustace coolly, in  no wise moved by her sorrow, &ldquo;but tears are very weak. Try something else more  original.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  this scoffing remark he resumed his seat, and waited till her passion should  have exhausted itself, which happened very soon, for Mrs. Veilsturm was too  sensible a woman to waste her weapons when she found they were useless. Drying  her eyes carefully, she sat up again quite cool and composed, which warned  Eustace that he must be more on his guard than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  cousin&rsquo;s a fool,&rdquo; she said viciously. &ldquo;Do you think it was any pleasure for me  to have him running after me? No! I hate and detest him, the persistent bore  that he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think you&rsquo;d better drop these flowers of speech?&rdquo; replied Eustace  leisurely. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re neither pretty nor necessary. Go on with the main subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  come to that quick enough,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Veilsturm sullenly. &ldquo;You are right  about Lady Errington&mdash;she did slight me, and in a way no woman can forgive nor  forget. I&rsquo;d hate her if it were only for the fact that she is Gabriel Mostyn&rsquo;s  daughter&mdash;the traitor&mdash;but I hate her twice as much on my own account. I vowed I&rsquo;d  punish her for the insult&mdash;and I will too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  causing a divorce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Either  that or separating them altogether. And I think I&rsquo;ve managed that now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can think what you please,&rdquo; said Eustace coolly, &ldquo;but at all events you&rsquo;ve done  your worst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you have. Now you are going to write my cousin a letter, saying you don&rsquo;t  care about him, or&mdash;well, say what you like, but give him to understand you won&rsquo;t  see him again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo; she demanded, with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then you&rsquo;ll leave San Remo as soon as you conveniently can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  burst out into a peal of ironical laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you actually expect me to do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, and I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  looked at one another in silence, she tapping her foot on the ground with a  scornful smile, he eyeing her with calm deliberation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you don&rsquo;t go to that desk and write what I ask you,&rdquo; he said at length, in a  low, clear voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the world all I know about Lola Trujillo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  face grew very pale, but she answered defiantly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  so! No one can connect her with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  so you think, but I have enough proofs to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  what you like. I defy you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think it will be wise of you to do so,&rdquo; said Eustace in a low voice of  concentrated fury. &ldquo;You know me, Lola, and I know you, and all the world of  South America knows you also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  jumped up, and crossing over to the sofa, bent down and whispered in her ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can tell about your connection with Gabriel Mostyn, in regard to that boy, his  son&mdash;who disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had nothing to do with it,&rdquo; she muttered, shrinking from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Manuel Lopez.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  silent!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that little gambling saloon at Lima.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  for God&rsquo;s sake. You will ruin me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  intend to,&rdquo; said Eustace relentlessly, &ldquo;unless&mdash;&rdquo; and he pointed to the desk.</p>
  <p>Without  saying a word, she arose to her feet, and dragging herself slowly across the  room sat down at the desk and began to write. Eustace said nothing, but  remained standing by the sofa with a smile of satisfaction on his massive  features. Nothing was heard in the room but the steady ticking of the clock,  and the scratching of Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s pen as it moved rapidly over the paper.  In a few minutes she came back to him holding out a sheet of paper, which he  read carefully without taking it out of her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will do,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Will you be so kind as to put it into an envelope  and direct it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Darting  a look of hatred at him, which showed how hard it was for her to control her  temper, she returned to the desk and did what he asked. Then, leaving it on the  blotting-paper, she went to her seat by the window, while Eustace, picking up  the letter, glanced at the address and slipped it into his inner pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  about leaving San Remo?&rdquo; he asked, turning towards Mrs. Veilsturm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will leave in three days,&rdquo; she replied harshly. &ldquo;Will that suit you?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I won&rsquo;t see you again. <i>Bon voyage</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned to go, but Mrs. Veilsturm&rsquo;s voice arrested him. &ldquo;Of course you will say  nothing about South America?&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  You have done your part, and I will do mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t go to Lima again if I were you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Veilsturm, with deadly  hatred, &ldquo;it might be dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt of that,&rdquo; replied Eustace carelessly. &ldquo;If you want to turn the tables  you had better send your emissaries to Africa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  left the room without another word, and Cleopatra, sitting at the window, saw  him walking down the garden path. She was holding her handkerchief in her  hands, and with a sudden anger tore it in two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it had only been in South America,&rdquo; she said in a low, fierce voice. &ldquo;Oh, if it  had only been in South America!&rdquo;</p>

    The Last Temptation</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Death  ever rends asunder marriage bonds,<br>
    So should he die, this husband undesired,<br>
    She would be free to woo and wed again<br>
    And I might haply gain her hand, her heart.<br>
    Yet there is folly in this argument,<br>
    For such a course would breed but sterile love,<br>
    Seeing the first link in the chain of circumstance<br>
    Is ominous indeed&mdash;a dead man&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having  thus routed the enemy, Eustace returned to his hotel very well satisfied with  his victory, which he hoped would be productive of good in removing the  obstacle to the reconciliation of husband and wife. For his own part, he felt  considerable astonishment at the self-abnegation of his conduct, seeing that he  was doing his best to place the woman he loved so devotedly beyond any possible  chance of being anything to him. But since his last interview with Lady  Errington, the astute man of the world had been quick to read her true  feelings, and had therefore given up all hope of winning her love. Besides, he  had arranged with Laxton to go to Africa, and had it not been for the accident  of Guy&rsquo;s illness would have started almost immediately for that mysterious  continent, but since things had turned out otherwise, he resolved to do his  duty by his cousin even against his desire of gratifying self. It was true he  had done all in his power to conquer this dominant faculty of egotism, he had  parted with Alizon for ever, he had saved Errington from the machinations of  Mrs. Veilsturm but the great temptation was yet to come, and in a guise least  anticipated by the tempted.</p>
  <p>Of  course, he told Dr. Storge about his success in the delicate matter of Mrs.  Veilsturm, at which success the physician expressed himself highly delighted,  as he undoubtedly thought that the removal of this disturbing influence on  Errington&rsquo;s life would have a beneficial result on his health.</p>
  <p>Doctors  are not infallible, however, and the result of this attempt to quiet the  patient&rsquo;s mind only succeeded in exciting it still more, which state of the  case considerably dismayed both Storge and Gartney.</p>
  <p>Guy,  being under the impression that his wife had cast him off for ever, had been  touched by the interest displayed towards him by Mrs. Veilsturm, and clung to  the idea of her disinterested affection as a drowning man clings to a straw. An  old simile, certainly, but one that holds good in this case. He thought that  his wife did not love him, that she had never loved him, and that Cleopatra was  the only woman who had any tender feelings towards him in her heart. It was  true that the world, a notoriously ungenerous critic, said that she was  capricious, cruel, fickle as the wind&mdash;still, so cleverly had she feigned a love  she did not feel, that Errington really believed he had inspired a genuine  feeling in her hard heart.</p>
  <p>Every  day, when tender messages arrived for him with presents of fruit and flowers,  he mentally thanked Heaven that one woman, at least, truly loved and remembered  him in his hour of trouble. When, however, the messages with their accompanying  gifts of fruit and flowers ceased to arrive, he wondered at the omission and became  querulously suspicious. Why had she forgotten him? What was the reason of this  sudden change? Could she be false to him, seeing that she had made such  protestations of love? No, it could not be, and yet&mdash;there must be some reason.  These were the questions he kept continually asking himself, and thereby  working himself into such mad frenzies, that it seemed as though nothing could  avert the threatened attack of brain fever.</p>
  <p>True  to her promise, which would cost her too much to break, Mrs. Veilsturm had departed  from San Remo and taken up her abode at Nice, together with the Major, Dolly  Thambits and Mr. Jiddy, alleging that she found the Italian watering-place dull  and preferred the lively Gauls to the more sedate Latins. Errington, however,  knew nothing of this sudden exodus, and his excited brain suggested a thousand  reasons for the sudden silence of his quondam charmer. She was ill! She was  afraid of exciting him. She had been called to England on business! What could  be the reason of this sudden change from attention to neglect, from warmth to  coldness? And day and night, and night and day, the weary brain puzzled over  these perplexing questions, suggesting and discarding a thousand answers with  every tick of the clock.</p>
  <p>Eustace  did his best to allay his cousin&rsquo;s excitement without telling him the truth,  but all to no purpose, so, in despair, he spoke seriously to Storge as to what  was best to be done under the circumstances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Things  can&rsquo;t go on like this much longer,&rdquo; he said decisively, &ldquo;if my cousin was ill  when I arrived, he seems to me to be much worse now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a very difficult case,&rdquo; remarked Storge musingly. &ldquo;So difficult, that I hardly  know what step to take. I&rsquo;ve made him keep to his room, see no one, given him  sedatives, and yet he is no better. In fact, I think we&rsquo;re only at the  beginning of the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ve got that woman out of the way,&rdquo; said Eustace bluntly, &ldquo;so that is  something gained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that,&rdquo; replied the doctor, biting his nails, a habit he had when  irritated; &ldquo;of course I advised it, and it was done for the best, still, upon  my soul Mr. Gartney you must think me a fool. Here am I, a duly accredited  M.D., yet I don&rsquo;t know what steps to take in order to cure my patient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is perplexing,&rdquo; sighed Eustace, drumming with his fingers on the table. &ldquo;Errington  has got it into his head that this woman is his good angel&mdash;faugh! to what  lengths will love carry a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you said he was not in love with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  is he! This is one of those rare cases which are veritable enigmas. Most  unaccountable. As far as I can see, the whole thing is simply this. My cousin  thinks his wife hates him, and, as Mrs. Veilsturm has played her game so  cleverly, believes she loves him. He doesn&rsquo;t love her, but he is intensely  grateful for what he thinks is her disinterested kindness. Now she has  withdrawn the light of her countenance, he imagines that he is forsaken for the  second time, and his feeling is one of absolute despair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Thou  cans&rsquo;t not minister to a mind diseased,&rsquo; &rdquo; quoted Storge, musingly. &ldquo;A very true  remark of Shakespeare&rsquo;s. It seems to me, judging from your theory, with which I  must say I agree, that I&rsquo;m in very much the same dilemma. My drugs are no use  while his mind is in such a turmoil. You cure his mind, Gartney, and I&rsquo;ll cure  his body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all very well saying that,&rdquo; replied Eustace pettishly. &ldquo;You give me the hardest  task.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  you send for his wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  surely when she knows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you she won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; repeated Eustace sternly, &ldquo;she thinks he has behaved  shamefully, and I&rsquo;m afraid she is rather unforgiving.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Storge  ran his hands through his hair in a most perplexed fashion, but made no reply,  as he was quite at his wits&rsquo; end what to suggest. It was as he suggested more a  mental than a physical case, and though he felt himself competent to deal with  nerves, brain, or tissues, he was quite helpless in this emergency, which  required the aid of external circumstances. Those external circumstances were  best known to Eustace Gartney, so that gentleman was the only man who could  have any influence in the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you what,&rdquo; said Gartney, after a pause, during which he had been thinking  deeply, &ldquo;Errington imagines Mrs. Veilsturm an angel of light, and is worrying  himself because he thinks a good woman has forgotten him. Suppose I show her to  him in her true colours, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then,&rdquo; finished the doctor caustically, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll fix him up nicely for a very  bad attack of brain fever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is one presumption!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  only one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t agree with you! I&rsquo;ll undeceive him about Mrs. Veilsturm, and then he&rsquo;ll  see the snare he has escaped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  and do you think that will quiet him?&rdquo; asked Dr. Storge sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it will turn his thoughts back to his wife. If so, I&rsquo;ll write to her to  come over&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the forgiveness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell her it&rsquo;s a case of life and death. That will surely soften her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  whirl about like a weather-cock, my friend,&rdquo; said Storge grimly, &ldquo;you tell me  decisively that the wife is unforgiving, and won&rsquo;t come, then you say she might  soften&mdash;which view is the right one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  is impossible with regard to a woman. But what do you say to my plan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; said Eustace determinedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t approve of it,&rdquo; remarked Storge in desperation, &ldquo;still, as it&rsquo;s a case of  brain fever if things go on like this, the chance of accelerating the disease  doesn&rsquo;t make much difference, so you&rsquo;d better begin your disillusionising at  once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; replied Gartney with a sigh of relief, and this closed the conversation.</p>
  <p>It  was a disagreeable task to undertake, but not more so than that connected with  Mrs. Veilsturm, and Eustace made up his mind to speak to Errington at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sooner things are brought to a crisis the better,&rdquo; he thought, as he went up to  his cousin&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;As they stand now, it&rsquo;s quite impossible to move either  way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  was lying with his arms outside the counterpane, when Mr. Gartney entered, and  turned his eyes, unnaturally bright, in the direction of the door when he heard  his cousin&rsquo;s footstep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  from Mrs. Veilsturm?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  responded Eustace, and took a seat beside the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can be the matter with her?&rdquo; said Guy, feverishly. &ldquo;Eustace, why don&rsquo;t you find  out? It&rsquo;s cruel of you to keep me in suspense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t keep you in suspense any longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  sat up in his bed with a cry, but Eustace forced him to lie down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  quiet, or I won&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;By-the-way, if you don&rsquo;t want  Albert, he had better go downstairs. I want to speak to you privately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  yes! you can go, Albert. Mr. Gartney will stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  well-trained valet bowed his head in answer, arranged a few things on the  little table beside the bed, and then noiselessly withdrew, leaving the cousins  together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Eustace, well?&rdquo; said Guy, plucking restlessly at the bedclothes. &ldquo;What is the  matter? Nothing wrong with Mrs. Veilsturm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I&rsquo;m aware of,&rdquo; responded Gartney drily. &ldquo;She is a lady who can take  remarkably good care of herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk like that about her,&rdquo; said Guy, with weak anger, &ldquo;she is my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  friend!&rdquo; repeated Eustace scornfully. &ldquo;Yes, the same kind of friend as she is  to every man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eustace!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  sat up again with a fierce look on his face, but the calm gaze of his cousin  disconcerted him, and he sank back on the pillows with an impatient sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; he said fretfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;my head is aching&mdash;aching  terribly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guy,  old fellow,&rdquo; said Eustace, in his low, soft voice, which had such an  indescribable charm in its tones, &ldquo;I want to speak to you about your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I have a confession to make to you. I love your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  looked at his cousin vacantly, and as if he did not understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  love my wife?&rdquo; he repeated mechanically. &ldquo;You love my wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Eustace, steadily, going through his self-imposed ordeal with stern  determination, although his face was grey with anguish and his heart ached with  pain and self-humiliation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible thing to confess to you&mdash;to her  husband&mdash;but true nevertheless. When I first saw her at Como, I worshipped her  for that calm, spiritual loveliness which made her so beautiful in my eyes. But  I said nothing, and went into exile for her sake, trusting to come back and  find her a happy wife and mother. I went away to forget, and I came back to  remember. Oh, Guy, if you only knew how I have despised myself for thus  thinking about your wife; but believe me, it was not in the sensual fashion of  the world that I loved her. I worshipped her as one might worship a star which  is higher and purer than he who kneels to its splendour. My love was pure,  still I strove to crush it out of my heart, but all in vain. I came back to  England and saw her once more, a happy mother indeed, but not a happy wife. It  was not your fault, my poor boy, for I know you did your best to win her heart,  but her child blinded her better nature, and she could not see that the father  yearned for love, and required it as much as the son. Then came the episode of  Mrs. Veilsturm, which was one of those cruel decrees of Fate which no man can  guard against. It parted you, as I thought, for ever, and you obeyed the  instincts of your lower nature, while she remained sternly unforgiving in her  purity&mdash;a purity which could not understand the temptations of a weaker soul. I  tried my best to make her look more kindly on your mistake&mdash;as I am a living  man, Guy, I did my best to bring you together again, but it was all useless.  Then I lost my head, the devil whispered in my ear, and I spoke to her of love,  and the result was what you might have expected from your wife. She told me  that she loved her child, and would not stoop to dishonour for his sake. But  she said more&mdash;not in words indeed, but in looks, in manner, in irrepressible  tears&mdash;that she loved you, Guy, that she was sorry for her cruel justice, that  she longed for the father of her child, for the husband of her vows, to clasp  her in his arms once more. I was punished for my daring to lift my eyes to her&mdash;I  saw that I could be nothing to such spotless purity of soul, and I left&mdash;I went  away into the outer darkness, intending to exile myself for ever from her  sight. Then the child died&mdash;the child whom she worshipped&mdash;the child who was your  strongest rival in her affections, and now she sits alone and in solitude&mdash;robbed  of her nearest and dearest&mdash;waiting for the sound of her husband&rsquo;s voice, for  the clasp of his arms, for the touch of his lips.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  his fervour, he had slipped from his chair, and was now kneeling beside the  bed, holding his cousin&rsquo;s hot hand in his own. The sick man had listened dully  to the long speech, but at the end he flung up his disengaged hand with a  bitter cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no! It is too late, it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not too late,&rdquo; said Eustace, earnestly. &ldquo;I have told you the truth. I have  humiliated myself in your eyes because I am anxious to repair my fault, to  bring you together again. Let me send for your wife, Guy, and believe me, she  will come, only too gladly, to your sick bed with words of forgiveness and  regret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the sick man rolled his head from side to side on the pillow with dreary  despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  no! it cannot be. My wife can never be mine again&mdash;Maraquita&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maraquita  Veilsturm!&rdquo; interrupted Eustace, sternly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention her name in connection  with that of your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was kind to me when Alizon was so cruel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kind,  yes, for her own ends. Listen to me, Guy. Mrs. Veilsturm has been using you as  a means of revenge against your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  the listless despair disappeared from Errington&rsquo;s face, and he wrenched his  hand angrily away from Eustace. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly  what I say,&rdquo; said Eustace hurriedly, seeing that his cousin was getting  excited, and determined to have the whole thing over and done with it at once. &ldquo;Do  you think Mrs. Veilsturm ever forgave or forgot the slight she received from  your wife? Not she! I know Mrs. Veilsturm, none better. However, I&rsquo;m going to  say nothing about her except this, that she pretended to love you in order to  cause trouble between yourself and your wife. And now that she has succeeded,  she has gone off and left you, ill as you are, to do the best you can without  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  it&rsquo;s not true! It can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; raved Guy, fiercely. &ldquo;You malign her, she is  a true good woman, she loves me&mdash;she loves me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you she does not,&rdquo; said Eustace, rising to his feet, so as to be ready for  any emergency, for Guy looked so wild that he was afraid he would spring upon  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Liar!  You cannot prove it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can, and by her own handwriting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy  snatched the letter Eustace held out to him, tore open the envelope, glanced  over the few cruel words of dismissal, and then, dropping the paper, covered  his face with his hands, moaning pitifully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see now, my dear Guy, what this woman really is,&rdquo; said Gartney tranquilly,  picking up the letter; &ldquo;a vindictive vixen, who simply used you for her own  ends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  baronet uncovered his face, and looked at Eustace in a vacant manner, his eyes  large and bright, his lips twitching with nervous agitation, and a feverish  flush on his hot, dry skin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must go to her,&rdquo; he said in a shrill voice, trying to rise from his bed. &ldquo;I  must see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no! it&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; cried Eustace in alarm, holding him back; &ldquo;be reasonable,  Guy, be reasonable. Stay where you are, Guy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Guy was now past all understanding, and struggled vehemently with Eustace,  uttering short cries of rage and terror like a caged animal. His cousin&rsquo;s heart  bled for the frenzied agony of the unhappy man, but he saw that Guy was rapidly  getting worse, and shouted for assistance. No one answered, however, so having  forced Guy to lie down with a great effort, Eustace ran to the electric bell,  and in a moment its shrill summons rang through the house. In that moment,  however, Guy was out of bed, making for the window, swaying, staggering,  raving, with outstretched hands, and Eustace had just time to throw himself on  the madman&mdash;for he was nothing else at present&mdash;and prevent him breaking the  glass.</p>
  <p>Albert  entered, and, seeing the state of affairs, shouted for aid, and came forward to  help Gartney, whose valet also came up stairs in answer to their cries, and  between them the three men managed to get Guy back to bed, where they held him  down, raving, crying, shrieking, and entirely insane. Leaving the two servants  in charge, Eustace went down stairs and sent for the doctor, who arrived  speedily on the scene and prescribed such remedies as were necessary, although,  truth to tell, he could do but little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what I expected,&rdquo; he said grimly, when things were going smoother, &ldquo;and now,  Mr. Gartney, as you&rsquo;ve carried out your first intention, perhaps you&rsquo;ll carry  out the second, and send for his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose I must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a case of life and death,&rdquo; said Storge, and walked out of the room.</p>
  <p>In  two minutes Eustace was on his way to the telegraph office. As he walked  rapidly down the street, the temptation came, the terrible temptation that  whispered to him not to send for Alizon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you do not,&rdquo; whispered the devil on his left, &ldquo;Guy will die, and you will be  able to gain her for your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the good angel on his right. &ldquo;She can never love you, you could buy  nothing, not even happiness, at the price of your cousin&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Eustace walked along with these two angels, the bad and the good, whispering in  his ears, now inclining to one, now to the other, fighting desperately against  the temptations of the devil, and again yielding to the insidious whisper of  future joy to be won by a simple act of neglect. In that short walk a whole  life-time of agony passed, but no one looking at this stalwart, calm-faced man  striding along the Street, could have guessed the hell that raged within.</p>
  <p>The  powers of good and evil fought desperately for the possession of this weak,  wavering soul, that was in such sore straits, but in the end the good angel  prevailed, and Eustace sat down to write his telegram.</p>
  <p>He  wrote one to Alizon, as strongly worded as he was able, and a second to  Otterburn, telling him he must bring Lady Errington over at once. In both he  wrote the words, &ldquo;It is a case of life and death,&rdquo; those words that had been  ringing in his ears ever since the doctor had said them.</p>
  <p>Then,  as he handed the telegram to the clerk, the temptation again assailed him. It  was not too late, let him withdraw the messages, tear them up, and there would  be a chance of his winning the woman he loved instead of going into voluntarily  exile. But at the price of a man&rsquo;s life? No! that was too big a price to pay,  and yet&mdash;he put down the money demanded by the clerk and walked out of the post  office.</p>
  <p>Outside  in the sunshine he stood with drops of sweat on his forehead, and the soul that  had been saved from the commission of a great crime, put up a prayer of thanks  to God that this last temptation had passed, and that the powers of evil had  not prevailed in the hour of weakness.</p>

  <p>The  Hon. Angus Macjean&rsquo;s experiences of early married life could hardly be called  pleasant, seeing the demands made upon himself and his bride by their mutual  friends. Shortly after their marriage, Aunt Jelly had died, thereby causing  them to return to London before the end of the honeymoon, then, during their  visit to Lord Dunkeld, Mrs. Macjean had been summoned south in order to console  Lady Errington for the loss of her child, and now as Eustace had telegraphed  Alizon to come over to her sick husband at San Remo, it was necessary that  Otterburn should escort her, for it was impossible, in her present state of  grief, that she could travel alone. The young couple, therefore, did not get so  much of each other&rsquo;s company as they desired, and it said a great deal for the  good nature of both, that they were so ready to comfort the mourner, at the  sacrifice of their own desires, and the upsetting of all their plans.</p>
  <p>Life  at Errington Hall was very dreary after the death of the heir, as Victoria was  constantly with the unhappy mother and Otterburn was left to wander about with  nothing but his own thoughts, which were not particularly cheerful in the  present aspect of affairs. Then came the funeral, which Macjean had to look  after entirely by himself, as Eustace and Errington were both absent. The young  man had received a letter from Gartney, stating that Guy was too ill to travel,  and Victoria had shown it to Alizon, but, wrapped up in the selfishness of grief  for her great loss, she had made hardly any remark about this new blow.</p>
  <p>Then  came the peremptory telegrams summoning the wife to the bedside of her sick  husband, and Otterburn, through his wife, delicately offered to accompany Lady  Errington to San Remo as soon as she was ready to start.</p>
  <p>Alizon  was a long time making up her mind about going, as she considered that her  husband had grossly insulted her by his openly-displayed passion for Mrs.  Veilsturm. Still, on calm reflection, she saw that she was to a great extent  blameable for his folly, and as the death of Sammy had considerably softened  her heart towards his wrong-doing, she determined to fulfil her duty as a wife  and go across to the Riviera at once. The child&rsquo;s death had left a blank in her  heart, and she felt that she must have someone to love and console her, or she  would go mad in the loneliness of her grief; so with these thoughts in her  heart she sent a telegram to Eustace, announcing her departure, and prepared  for the journey.</p>
  <p>She  accepted Otterburn&rsquo;s escort as far as San Remo, but promised that as soon as  she was established by Guy&rsquo;s sick bed, Angus should return to his wife, who was  to be left behind at Errington Hall. Angus agreed to this, and in company with  the young man and her maid, she left Victoria Station <i>en route</i> for the  Italian Riviera.</p>
  <p>The  whole journey seemed to her like a dream; the bright English landscape, which  she knew so well; the breezy passage across the Channel, with the tossing waves  and blue sky; Calais, with its bustling crowd of natives and tourists; the long  journey through the pleasant Norman country, and then Paris, gay and  glittering, where they stayed all night. Next morning again in the train  rushing southward, past quaint, medi&aelig;val towns, with their high-peaked houses,  over slow-flowing rivers, through ancient forests already bearing the touch of  Autumn&rsquo;s finger&mdash;still onward, onward, till they reached Marseilles, sitting by  the blue waters of the Mediterranean. Afterwards they continued their journey  through smiling Provence, along the sunny Riviera&mdash;Cannes, Mentone, Nice, all  passed in their turn; a glimpse of Monte Carlo, where the Goddess of Play sits  enthroned on high&mdash;palm-crowned Bordighera&mdash;deserted Ospedaletti, with its lonely  Casino&mdash;and at last San Remo, amid her grey olive-groves, at the foot of the  blue hills.</p>
  <p>Eustace  was waiting for them at the railway-station, looking very grave, and bowed  silently to Lady Errington, as she stepped out of the carriage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he better?&rdquo; she asked, looking haggardly at him, a tall slender figure in her  sweeping black robes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid not&mdash;still we hope for the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  made no reply, so after greeting Otterburn, Eustace conducted them to a  carriage, and they drove to the Hotel de la Mer. Alizon lost no time, but asked  to be taken at once to her husband&rsquo;s room. Eustace tried to prepare her mind,  so that the shock of seeing him should not be too much, but she disregarded all  his entreaties, and went up to the darkened apartment where her husband was  lying. One question only she asked Gartney before she entered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that woman here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think I would have sent for you had she been?&rdquo; he replied, deeply hurt. &ldquo;No! She has left San Remo, and will trouble you no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave him her slender, black-gloved hand for a moment, and then passed to her  husband&rsquo;s bedside, where her place was henceforth to be.</p>
  <p>The  next morning Otterburn, having discharged his duty, returned to his wife, and  Lady Errington was left alone with Eustace to nurse the man whom she never  thought to meet with kindly feeling again.</p>
  <p>Guy  was terribly ill for a long time, but as out of evil good sometimes comes,  there was no doubt that this illness was beneficial, inasmuch as it showed  Alizon the true state of her husband&rsquo;s heart. In those long, dreary hours, as  she sat beside the bed listening to his incoherent ravings, she heard  sufficient to convince her that Guy had always tenderly loved her&mdash;that his  apparent infidelity was the result of despair, and that a word of forgiveness  from her would have saved him from the misery he had suffered. No explanation  on the part of Eustace Gartney&mdash;no explanation from her husband, had he been in  good health&mdash;would have convinced her of the truth, and there would always have  lurked in her heart a terrible suspicion that she had been sinned against,  which would have embittered her whole life. She would have perhaps forgiven her  husband, but she nevertheless would have believed him guilty, and his presence  would have been a constant regret and reproach to the purity of her soul. But  these wild mutterings, these agonised ravings, revealed the true state of  things&mdash;revealed at once his weakness and his strength; so little by little the  scales fell from her eyes, and she saw how noble was this nature, how weak was the  soul, and how needful to its well-being was love and tenderness.</p>
  <p>Again,  since the death of her child a terrible sense of utter loneliness had fallen  upon her, and now that she saw her mistaken judgment of Guy&rsquo;s character all her  being yearned for his love, and this woman, who had only respected and admired  him when he was well and strong, now that he was prostrate and weak,  passionately loved him with all the intensity of her nature. The coldness of  her nature had departed, the frozen heart had melted, and often, overcome with  terror and dread, she flung herself on her knees beside the bed, praying to God  to spare her the husband she had never understood nor loved till now. She never  spoke to Eustace about Mrs. Veilsturm&mdash;all she knew or cared to know was that  this obstacle that had stood between herself and her husband had been removed,  and that the true feelings of that husband had been revealed to her by the hand  of God.</p>
  <p>During  all this time Eustace acted the part of a brother, and never by word or deed  betrayed the true state of his feelings. Heaven alone knew how he suffered in  maintaining a cold, patient demeanour towards the woman he loved, and his life,  from the time of her arrival till the hour he left San Remo, was one long  martyrdom. Often she wondered at his stoical calmness and apparent  forgetfulness of the words he had spoken to her at Errington Hall, but neither  of them made any reference to the past, and she thought that he was now cured  of his passion. Cured! Eustace laughed aloud to himself as he divined her  thoughts and contentment that it should be so, and he counted the hours  feverishly until such time as he could leave her with a convalescent husband  and depart from her presence, where he had to hide his real feelings under a  mask of cynical indifference.</p>
  <p>Owing  to the unintermitting care of Dr. Storge, the careful nursing of his wife, and  the watchful tenderness of Gartney, the man who had been sick unto death slowly  recovered. The long nights of agony and delirium were succeeded by hours of  peaceful slumber, the disordered brain righted itself slowly, and the vacant  stare of the eyes and babble of the tongue were succeeded by the light of  sanity and the words of sense. He was weak, it is true&mdash;very weak&mdash;but the first  moment of joy she had known since the death of her child came to Alizon when  one morning, while kneeling beside his bed, he called her faintly by her name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alizon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear!&mdash;your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  wife!&mdash;was this his cold, stately wife who knelt so fondly beside him? Were  those eyes&mdash;shining with love, wet with tears&mdash;the cold blue eyes that had so  often frozen all demonstrations of affection? Was that face, full of joyful  relief and emotion, the marble countenance that had never smiled lovingly on  him since he had first beheld it? No!&mdash;it could not be Alizon&mdash;it was some  deceptive vision of the brain, painting what might have been and yet&mdash; She saw  his state of bewilderment, and, bending over, kissed him tenderly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is I&mdash;your wife!&mdash;wife not in name only, but in love and trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  smile of joy flitted across his worn face, and he strove to put out one weak  hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive,&rdquo;  he said faintly, &ldquo;forgive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is I who should ask forgiveness,&rdquo; she replied in a broken voice; &ldquo;I was harsh  and cold, my dearest, and I do ask your forgiveness. Hush do not say a word&mdash;you  are very weak, and must not talk. Let me nurse you back to health again, and  then I will strive to be a better wife to you than I have hitherto been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  said nothing, but lay on his pillows, with eyes shining with love, a contented smile  on his lips, and fell asleep, still holding his wife&rsquo;s hand in his own.</p>
  <p>After  this he mended quickly, for with the return of Alizon&rsquo;s affection the desire of  life had come back, and each day he grew stronger because the vexed brain was  now at rest, and the love of his wife was a better medicine than any drugs of  the doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; said Storge to Eustace on leaving the chamber one day when Guy had been  pronounced convalescent, &ldquo;what has cured him is not my medicines, but his wife&rsquo;s  affection. Ah, Shakespeare was a wise man when he said, &lsquo;Thou canst not  minister unto a mind diseased.&rsquo; Love is the only cure there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky  mind to have such a cure,&rdquo; replied Gartney with a sigh; &ldquo;some minds have to  bear their diseases till the end of life with no chance of being mended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Storge  said nothing, but he looked at him curiously, for he half guessed the real  state of the case, and sincerely pitied Eustace for his unhappy passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  fellow,&rdquo; he thought as he departed, &ldquo;he has wealth, health, fame and popularity,  yet he would give all these for what he will never obtain&mdash;the heart of that  woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guy&rsquo;s  complete recovery was now only a question of a few weeks, so Eustace, feeling  that he could not keep up the pretence of indifference much longer, made up his  mind to depart. With this idea he produced a letter from Laxton one evening  when he was seated with Alizon by the bed of the convalescent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  just got a letter from my friend,&rdquo; he said cheerfully, &ldquo;and he wants me to come  back to England at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo; asked Guy quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  our African expedition, you know,&rdquo; replied Eustace, smoothing out the letter. &ldquo;I  put it off because of your illness, but now you are on the way to recovery I  can leave you with safety in the hands of Alizon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw such a fellow,&rdquo; said Guy, fretfully. &ldquo;Why on earth can&rsquo;t you stay at  home, instead of scampering all round the world?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eustace  laughed, yet his mirth was rather forced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid I&rsquo;ve got a strain of gipsy blood in me somewhere,&rdquo; he said, jokingly, &ldquo;and  I can&rsquo;t rest; besides, I really and truly prefer savages to civilized idiots of  the London type. They&rsquo;re every bit as decent, and much more amusing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  this time, Lady Errington had remained silent in deep thought, but at the  conclusion of Gartney&rsquo;s speech, she looked up with a grave face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  do you start?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow  morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  soon?&rdquo; she said, with a start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it, Eustace, you might have given us longer notice,&rdquo; remarked Guy, in a  displeased tone of voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Cui  bono?</i>&rdquo; said Gartney, listlessly. &ldquo;Long leave-takings are a mistake, I think&mdash;the  opposite of &lsquo;linked sweetness long drawn out.&rsquo; I always like to come and go  quickly, so I&rsquo;ll say goodbye to-night, and be off the first thing in the  morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Neither  Guy nor his wife made any further remark, as they both felt dimly that it would  be happier for Eustace to go away as soon as possible. It was not ingratitude,  it was not a desire to lose his company, but what he had said to the wife, and  what he had said to the husband, recurred to both their memories, and they  silently acquiesced in his decision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  I go,&rdquo; said Eustace, after a pause, &ldquo;there is one thing I wish to say. Can I  speak to you both without offence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  replied Guy, wondering what was coming. &ldquo;We both owe you more than we can ever  repay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can repay it easily,&rdquo; said Gartney, quickly, &ldquo;by accepting the proposition I am  about to make.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us hear what it is first,&rdquo; observed Alizon, looking up for a moment with a  faint smile on her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will not take long to explain,&rdquo; answered Gartney, in a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;You  know I am rich enough to indulge all my whims and fancies, so this new access  of wealth from Aunt Jelly, is absolutely useless to me. It ought to have been  left to Guy, and had I spoken to Aunt Jelly before she died, no doubt I would  have made her see this. As it is, however, it has been left to me, and I do not  want it. Guy, however, does so. I wish to make him a free gift of all the  property before leaving for Africa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Guy resolutely, &ldquo;I will not take a penny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  it was left to you. I do not want to rob you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not a question of robbery,&rdquo; said Eustace, coolly, &ldquo;if the money was of any use  to me, I&rsquo;d keep it. But it is not. I do not even know that I would touch it, so  it&rsquo;s far better to be employed by you than lying idle in my bank. What do you  say, Alizon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  flushed painfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you will persuade this obstinate husband of yours to take the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  suppose he won&rsquo;t accept?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  is his firm intention,&rdquo; said Guy, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case,&rdquo; remarked Eustace grimly, &ldquo;I shall simply hand it over to the most  convenient charity, say &lsquo;The Society for the Suppression of Critics,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The  Fund for Converted Publishers&rsquo;&mdash;but keep it, I will not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  talking nonsense,&rdquo; cried Guy, impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sober truth, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was silence for a few moments, and at last the silence was broken by Guy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I thought you were in earnest&mdash;&rdquo; he began slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead  earnest,&rdquo; said Eustace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I suppose it will be best to accept your Quixotic offer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad you look at it in such a sensible light,&rdquo; retorted Gartney, with an air of  great relief. &ldquo;You agree with Guy, Alizon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  raised her eyes slowly to his face, and looked steadily at him before making  her reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I agree with Guy,&rdquo; she answered frankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; said Eustace with a huge sigh. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how glad I am  to escape being buried under this weight of wealth, like Tarpeia under the  shields of the Sabines. An old illustration, is it not, but remarkably apt. You  will be able to clear the mortgages off the Hall, Guy, and live there in a  manner befitting the place. I will see my lawyers as soon as I return to  England, so you will have no further trouble over the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about yourself?&rdquo; asked Alizon, impulsively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Myself?&rdquo;  he echoed, rising slowly from his chair. &ldquo;Oh, I am going away to foreign parts.  The land of Khem&mdash;the blameless Ethiopians&mdash;the secret sources of the Nile, and  all that kind of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  when you come back?&rdquo; said Errington, raising himself on his elbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I come back,&rdquo; said Eustace sadly, a presentiment of coming doom heavy on his  soul, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll see you both happy and honoured. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll find a  domestic seat for me by the domestic hearth, and I&rsquo;ll tell stories of  mysterious lands to future generations of Erringtons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  silence, a painful, oppressive silence, which seemed to last an eternity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye,  dear old fellow,&rdquo; said Eustace at last, with a mighty effort.</p>
  <p>Guy  clasped his hand without a word, his heart being too full to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you also, Alizon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave him her hand also, and there they stood, husband and wife, with their  hands clasped in those of the man whom they both knew had fought a good fight&mdash;and  conquered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye,  Eustace,&rdquo; whispered the woman at last, with a look of infinite gratitude and  pity in her deep eyes. &ldquo;May God keep you&mdash;brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  under the spell of that gentle benediction, he passed away from their sight for  ever.</p>

    A Letter From Home</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I  thought that our old life was over and done with,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever apart we would wander alone,<br>
  That Clotho had broken the distaff she spun with,<br>
  Weaving the weird web that made my life one with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your own.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Yea,  but this letter unbidden appeareth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sorrowful ghost of the sweetness of yore.<br>
  Bringing dear thoughts which the lonely heart cheereth,<br>
  Recalling the words which the heavy soul heareth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Ah,  but love&rsquo;s blossom can ne&rsquo;er bloom again, love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withered and brown it lies dead in my heart,<br>
  There let it faded and broken remain, love,<br>
  We must live ever while years wax and wane, love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  the entrance to a tent a man sat silent, watching the setting sun. A wild  scene, truly, far beyond the bounds of civilization, where the foot of the  white man had never trodden before, where the savage tribes had lived since the  first of Time in primeval simplicity, where Nature, with lavish hand, spread  her uncultured luxuriance in forest, in mountain, and in plain, under a  burning, tropical sky. It was a scene far in the interior of Africa, that  mysterious continent, which has yet to yield up her secrets to the dogged  curiosity of European races.</p>
  <p>The  man was reading a letter, a letter that had come through swamp, through jungle,  over mountains, across plains, by the hands of savage carriers, the last letter  he would receive before plunging still deeper into the unknown lands beyond,  the last link that bound him to civilization&mdash;a letter from home.</p>
  <p>Inside  the tent, another man was also reading letters, from friends and club  companions, which gave him all the latest gossip of that London, now so far  away, but he read them lightly, and tossed them aside with a careless hand. The  man outside, however, had only one letter, and, as he read it, his eyes grew  moist, blinding him so much that he could not see the writing, and looking up,  gazed at the scene before him through a blurred mist of tears.</p>
  <p>Undulating  grass plains, a wide river winding through the country like a silver serpent,  clumps of tropical trees, and a distant vision of fantastic peaks, all flushed  with splendid colours under the fierce light of the sunset. And the sky, like a  delicate shell of pale pink, fading off in the east to cold blue and sombre  shadows, in the west deepening into vivid billowy masses of golden clouds,  which tried unsuccessfully to veil the intolerable splendour of the sinking  sun. A breath of odorous wind under the burning sky, the chattering of monkeys,  the shrieking of brilliant-coloured parrots, and the low, guttural song of a  naked negro cleaning his weapons in the near camp.</p>
  <p>The  man looked at all this with vague, unseeing eyes, for his thoughts were far  away, then, dashing away the tears, he once more began to read the letter he  held in his hand.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;My  dear Eustace,</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I  can hardly believe that it is nine months since you left us. I wonder in what  part of Africa you will read this letter, that is, if it ever reaches you, of  which I have considerable doubt. The papers, of course, informed us of your  many months of delay at Zanzibar before you could go forward, so perhaps this  letter may reach you before you get beyond the confines of civilization. I was  very much astonished to hear you were at Zanzibar, as I thought you left  England with the intention of going up the Nile, and getting into the inland  country that way. However, I suppose you had good reason for changing your  plans, and are now pushing forward into unknown lands.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I  have a great deal to tell you about ourselves and friends, which I am sure you  will be pleased to hear. In the first place, both my wife and myself are  completely happy&mdash;all the clouds of our earlier life have vanished, and I think  that no married pair can have such perfect confidence and love for one another.  I ascribe this happy state of things to you, dear old fellow, for had you not  made Mrs. Veilsturm leave San Remo, and brought my wife to my sick bed, we  could never have come together again. I know, good friend that you are, you  will be pleased to hear we are so perfectly happy, and that every year&mdash;every  day&mdash;every hour, my wife grows dearer to me. As I write these words her dear  face is bending over my shoulder to read what I have set down, and she  cordially endorses what I have said.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Thanks  to your kind gift of Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s money, all things pecuniarily are well with  me. I have paid off the mortgages on the Hall, and invested the rest of the  money, so what with the income arising from such investments, and my rents, now  regularly coming to me instead of to the lawyers, I am quite a rich man, and  the Erringtons can once more hold up their head in the county as a  representative family.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;By-the-way,  I have some news to give you about our mutual friend, Mrs. Veilsturm, with whom  I was so infatuated. She went on to New York, followed by Dolly Thambits, and  has now married him. He is a young idiot to be sure, but then he has an  excellent income, and that is all she cares about. Won&rsquo;t she spend his  thousands for him? Well, I think you and I agree on that subject. Regarding  Major Griff, she evidently found him less useful after than before she became  Mrs. Thambits, so she has pensioned him off with a few thousands, and I hear  the Major has gone to Central America, with a view to entering the service of  one of the republics of those regions. His future fate is not hard to prophesy,  as he will either become President or be shot, but in either event I don&rsquo;t  think he&rsquo;ll trouble our fair friend again who has retired so peacefully into  married life. Next year, I believe, she is coming to town, and is going to cut  a great dash, so no doubt Mrs. Thambits will be even more popular than Mrs.  Veilsturm&mdash;although, I dare say, there will not be any Sunday evenings of the  Monte Carlo style.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;You  will perhaps wonder at my writing so coolly about this lady, but the fact is, I  now see only too clearly the danger I escaped. She would have ruined my life,  and certainly made a good attempt to do so, only you fortunately intervened in  time. What magic you used to force her to leave me alone I do not know, but I  certainly have to thank you for extricating me from a very perilous position.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Another  item of news. Mrs. Macjean has presented the delighted Otterburn with a son and  heir. By-the-way, I should not call him Otterburn, as, by the death of his  father four months ago, he is now Lord Dunkeld. But old habits are hard to get  rid of, and I always talk of them as Mrs. Macjean and Otterburn. They are very  happy, as they deserve to be, for Dunkeld is a real good fellow, and Lady  Dunkeld&mdash;well, she is all that is charming.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Do  you remember Miss Minnie Pelch, poor Aunt Jelly&rsquo;s companion? She is now down at  Errington with us, as she was so lonely in town that Alizon took pity on her,  and she is installed as companion at the Hall. Her volume of verse came out in  due splendour, and was entirely overlooked by the press, at which I am not  sorry, as if the poems had been noticed&mdash;well, you know the poems of old.  Minnie, however, thinks this silence is jealousy, and quite looks upon herself  as a shining light of the Victorian age, so neither Alizon nor I undeceive her,  for she is a good little woman, though somewhat of a bore with her infernal&mdash;I  mean eternal&mdash;poetry.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I  really don&rsquo;t think there is any more news to tell you, except that good old  Mrs. Trubbles is dead&mdash;apoplexy&mdash;and her dear Harry is now on the look-out for  another spouse with political influence&mdash;I wish it was &lsquo;poetical influence,&rsquo; and  we might manage to marry him to Miss Pelch.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Mr.  Dolser and &lsquo;The Pepper Box&rsquo; have both gone under, never to rise again I hope.  Some dreadful libel on a high personage appeared, at which the H.P. took  umbrage, and the editor is now expiating his offence in prison. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m  very sorry, as when he is released Mr. Dolser will no doubt leave other people&rsquo;s  affairs alone. Such men as he are the curse of the present age, and should all  be sunk in the Atlantic for at least half an hour&mdash;after that I think we&rsquo;d have  no more trouble with them.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;And  now, my dear cousin, I must close this long letter, but first, in confidence,  let me hint to you that my wife is expecting an interesting event to take place  shortly, which will once more render the nursery a necessity. Poor Alizon has  borne up bravely since the death of Sammy, but I know she longs for a child of  her own to fill the vacant place in her heart. I am no longer afraid of having  a rival in my child, as my wife loves and trusts me now, and my lot is as  perfectly happy a one as any mortal can hope for.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;So  now goodbye, my dear Eustace. I hope we will soon see you back again at the  Hall, where there is always a place for you. My wife sends her kindest regards  to you, and so do I, thus closing this letter, and remaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your  affectionate Cousin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Guy  Errington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  Eustace finished reading the letter he let it fall on the ground, and laughed  bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kindest  regards,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;and I gave her love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sun was sinking swiftly behind the dark hills, and Gartney, with his hand  supporting his chin, sat watching it, thinking of the days that were no more.</p>
  <p>So  sad, so melancholy he felt, as he thought of the past, of the woman he loved so  fondly, whom he had restored to the arms of her husband at the cost of his own  happiness. Surely, if he had been selfish, vain and egotistical all his life,  he had expiated these sins by his voluntary sacrifice of self&mdash;a sacrifice that  had banished all delight from his heart.</p>
  <p>And  he sat there a lonely exile, with sorrow behind him, and danger before him,  while the sun sank in the burning west, and the sable wings of night spread  over the earth like a sombre pall.</p>
  <p>There  was darkness on the world, there was darkness in his heart, and from the midst  of the shadows still sounded the melancholy chaunt of the slave.</p>

  <p align="center">Extract from &ldquo;The Morning Planet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;By  a telegram from Zanzibar there now seems no doubt that the two young  Englishmen, who went into the interior of Africa some months ago, have been  massacred. Only one survivor of the expedition escaped and managed to get  safely to the coast. According to his story, Mr. Laxton was speared first by  hostile natives from an ambush. Afterwards Mr. Gartney met with the same fate,  although he defended himself for some time with his revolver.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;Much  regret will be felt in England at this sad news, as the two deceased gentlemen  were both very popular, Mr. Gartney especially being widely known as a charming  poet and essayist. He, was very wealthy, and we hear that all his property, by  a will executed before he left England, has been left to Lady Errington, of  Errington Hall, Dreamshire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>So  that was the end of Eustace Gartney.</p>
