<p class="first">There is always a special thrill of excitement
about a mystery story, especially when the main characters cover
their tracks successfully. It is an Australian story through and
through, its main setting being Sydney and Melbourne, and the
swiftness and sureness with which both the launch people and
amateur sleuths act will keep the reader breathless. Wireless
plays an important part in this story. We defy any reader to
guess the perpetrators of the crimes and the secret of the launch
until the author reveals them.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT the devil? Say, Phelps, were you trying to
put one over on me, or have you taken to writing fiction?"</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Sergeant?" The young officer looked up at
the burly officer who had just entered the room.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" Sergeant Miller made a gesture of mock
despair. "Here's one of the most promising members of the Force
puts in a report that reads like a shilling shocker, and asks,
'What's the trouble?' If you're really serious in the pursuit of
knowledge, me lad, I'll tell you. I've got to sub-edit this fairy
story of yours before it goes to Headquarters, and you haven't
given it a title. Any objection to 'A Constable's Dream While On
Duty'?"</p>

<p>"Better call it 'The Phantom Launch,' Sergeant." Constable
Phelps looked up at his superior officer, a broad grin on his
face.</p>

<p>"Then it's a leg-puller! You young devil! If I'd sent it to
Headquarters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go easy, Sergeant." There was a note of seriousness in the
constable's voice. "There's precious little fiction about that
report. It's the first bit of adventure I've had since I started
walking the lonely rounds out of Balmoral, and I made the best of
it. But it's true, every word of it."</p>

<p>Sergeant Miller slumped into a chair and gazed at his
subordinate officer in amazement.</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me you saw this&mdash;this&mdash;Yes, I'll
give it your name&mdash;this Phantom Launch. A boat without masts
or sails, that goes up the harbour at top speed without
crew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who's the novelist, now?" Phelps rose slowly to his feet and
stretched himself. "I said nothing about no crew. In fact, I saw
three men on the launch, and I saw its wake when it went out of
Myella Cove. It's a goer, sure enough."</p>

<p>Miller referred to the report in his hand. He was beginning to
believe that it contained some truth. Constable Phelps was a
promising youngster. A bare twelve months in the Force, he was
already recognised for his coolness and bravery. The report was
absurd; so absurd that it was impossible to send it to
Headquarters. But there might be something in it; something that
it was his duty to inquire into, and test.</p>

<p>"Let's get this straight, boy." Miller placed the report on
the table and leaned forward, his hands on his knees. "Sit down.
I can't talk all the way up there. Now, I detailed you to go over
to Obelisk Bay on the sly-grog report. Nothin' doing, you
state."</p>

<p>"That's right." Phelps sat down again, and leaned his elbows
on the table, "Old Manners was about in that puffin'-billy he
sweeps the harbour with, but he hadn't a bottle in sight. 'Sides,
most of the camps were deserted. Those that were occupied had
mostly women and children in them. All asleep when I got there.
More like a Sunday school picnic than the drinkin' den you spoke
of."</p>

<p>"We'll pass that." The Sergeant again referred to the report.
"The camp being quiet, you went on to Middle Head, taking the
path over the cliffs. Rounding the head, you came to Myella Cove.
There you sat down. Had a doze, I suppose, and dreamed the
rest?"</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;" Phelps got to his feet angrily.</p>

<p>"Aw! Sit down!" Miller thumped the table with a fist like a
knuckle of ham. "We'll leave it that you sat down and thought
about girls, past, present, and future. That do? Now, let's get
on with the facts. You sat down and looked out over the harbour.
S'pose South Head Lighthouse was working?"</p>

<p>"I'd have telephoned through if it hadn't been."</p>

<p>"Humph! Glad to see your brains are not all wool." Miller
laughed, drily. "Now comes the fairy story. Author's title, 'The
Phantom Launch.' Out from under the silvery sheen of the moon,
glistening on the silent waters of the famous harbour beside the
well-known city of Syd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never wrote that tosh!"</p>

<p>"You didn't." Miller spoke, emphatically. "If you had, I'd
have placed you in a cell until the doctor came. Still, it's near
enough, so we'll go on. You noticed a high-powered launch coming
into the cove. You couldn't hear any engine, although the boat
travelling at a good speed. Correct?"</p>

<p>"Yep. She was absolutely silent."</p>

<p>"Engine shut off, of course," commented Miller. "Real truth of
the matter is, you were moon-struck, and didn't see anything of
her until she cut out her engines before charging the sands."</p>

<p>"I saw her before she began to turn towards the Cove,"
interposed Phelps, impatient. "Say, Sergeant, what are you
getting at? I put the thing straight in my report, you're just
hashing it up."</p>

<p>"Well," the Sergeant's broad face broke into a wide grin;
"just tryin' to put in a few fancy strokes. Would you like it to
go to the <i>Star</i> or the <i>Evening Moon?</i> I'd advise the
latter. They like it a bit tall. Sure you can't add a fair
captive, strapped to the mast?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't a ma&mdash;. Funny, I don't think." Phelps
turned away disgustedly.</p>

<p>Sergeant Miller rose from his seat, and walked towards his
private office, carrying the report with him. He was puzzled.
When he first read it, he thought the constable had dreamed the
details, around some simple happenings to a motor-boat returning
up harbour late at night. The indignation, the certainty,
displayed by the constable altered his views. There must be
something worth examining. At his desk, Miller went over the
report again, scanning each word thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Constable Phelps had reported for duty at seven o'clock the
previous evening. He had been detailed to proceed to Obelisk Bay,
and inquire into a report of sly grog-selling at the summer camps
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The constable had remained among the camps until late at
night. He had seen the suspected bootlegger, and had searched his
boat without results. Satisfied that nothing illegal was going on
that night, Phelps left the sleeping camps, and walked over the
paths to Middle Head. Almost immediately around the Head, he came
to Myella Cove, a small bay, containing a patch of fine sands.
The cove was almost inaccessible from the land side, by reason of
the steep cliffs, and on the water side was guarded by partly
submerged reefs, jutting out from the headlands, leaving only a
narrow and dangerous passage to the cove.</p>

<p>Phelps had had a long spell of duty, and a fair walk. He
stated in his report that he was tired, and sat down for a few
minutes rest. Just as he was about to resume his journey, he
noticed a high-powered launch, speeding towards the Heads, turn
sharply and make for the cove. The constable was curious. There
were no houses on the shores thereabouts, and the cliffs were so
steep that they were difficult to climb. The only reason for the
visit of the speed-boat could be that something had happened,
making it necessary to beach her immediately.</p>

<p>The boat did not appear to be in difficulties. Completing the
quarter-turn, the engines were shut off, and she came to rest on
the edge of the sands. Two men got out. One held the boat afloat
while the other waded ashore, disappearing from the constable's
view for some minutes.</p>

<p>Phelps acknowledged to some curiosity. The boat did not appear
to be in distress. Had he seen signs of distress, he would have
climbed down the cliffs, and offered what help he could give. The
actions of the men were mysterious. The constable dropped to his
hands and knees, and crawled to the edge of the cliff. The man
was kneeling on the sands, at the foot of the cliff. The moon
shadows covered him, and Phelps could only see that he was
working earnestly&mdash;at something.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour, and the man got to his feet, and went to
the water's edge. Another man came from the launch to the sands.
The two men walked to the foot of the cliff and knelt down. Five
minutes later they returned to the launch, and the little vessel
backed out into the Cove. Very silently, the boat turned, and
swept out into the harbour, travelling at incredible
speed.</p><br>

<div align="center"> <img src="1701141h-images/ThePhantomLaunch-2.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">

<p class="caption">The boat swept out into the harbour,
travelling at incredible speed.</p> </div>

<p>For some minutes, Constable Phelps lay on the edge of the
cliff, watching the disappearing boat. At length, satisfied that
it was not likely to return, Phelps scrambled down the cliffs to
the sands. He had a pocket torch with him, and by its light he
was able to trace the footsteps of the men from the waters' edge
to the face of the cliff.</p>

<p>The sands had been disturbed and roughly swept into place
again. A few minutes burrowing, and Phelps found his fingers
grating on the rough surface of a wooden box. He bad some trouble
in uncovering it, for the sand filtered into the hole almost as
quickly as he pulled it out, but he persisted. At length, he
uncovered the box. It was about four feet long, by two feet-wide,
made of very thick, common wood. There was a rope handle at each
end.</p>

<p>Phelps lugged the box to the surface. It was fastened by a
heavy lock, covered by a close-fitting slide-plate. He tried to
force the lock, but it was too strong. It was impossible to carry
the box up the face of the cliff. Phelps decided to re-bury the
box, and report his find at the police station.</p>

<p>Sergeant Miller pondered, deeply. There might be something in
this matter. Almost he reproached himself for allowing the box to
remain hidden during the time Constable Phelps had been off duty.
He should have sent at once to Myella Cove, and found the box. He
rose to his feet, and strode to the door.</p>

<p>"Constable Phelps."</p>

<p>"Sergeant."</p>

<p>"You can find that box again? Yes. Take Fellowes, and go over
the cliffs tonight, and get that box."</p>

<p>"Might do better from the sea," suggested Phelps
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Very well. Tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>The insistent ring of the telephone bell cut short the
Sergeant's words. He crossed to the instrument, and lifted the
receiver.</p>

<p>"Headquarters, Criminal investigation Branch, speaking,
Superintendent Hanson's compliments to sergeant Miller. Will he
be so good as to release a man to watch the Harbour from Middle
Head this night, starting at midnight. Very important. Report
immediately any sign of a long, narrow, high powered
speed-launch, low in the water, half-decked, painted silver-grey,
no mast, no funnel, driven electrically, or has a very competent
silencer; said to be absolutely noiseless. Please repeat
message."</p>

<p>Mechanically, Miller repeated the words he had scribbled on
the pad lying on the telephone desk. As he turned from the
instrument, he faced Constable Phelps, his face ablaze with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Sergeant. That boat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"That's the description of the boat I saw in Myella Cove last
night, or, rather, early this morning."</p>

<p>"Certain?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely&mdash;I'd swear to her anywhere."</p>

<p>"Which way was she heading when she left the Cove?"</p>

<p>"Up-river."</p>

<p>"You're certain you'd recognise her again?"</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it." Phelps spoke confidently.</p>

<p>"Then you're for Middle Head." A broad grin came to the
Sergeant's face. "We'll defer the question of a title for your
fairy story, Phelps. Seems like you've elected your own
punishment. A night on Middle Head, looking for the 'Phantom
Launch,' may make a complete cure. You heard what was said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Then get to it&mdash;and if you don't bring in that Phantom
Launch I'll send that damn fool report you wished on me to the
Commissioner."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">CONSTABLE PHELPS climbed the long, rough path
from Balmoral to Middle Head about half-past eleven that night.
The long, silent watch over the waters of the harbour did not
appeal to him, although, from what he had overheard of the
message from Headquarters, there appeared to be a prospect of
again seeing the mysterious speed-boat.</p>

<p>A walk along the rough track around the head, and Phelps
looked about him for a place where he could make his long watch
with some comfort. He found a narrow slab of rock forming a
comfortable seat and which would prove a good couch, if he dared
to trust himself to lie down. Here, he determined to establish
his headquarters for the night. Directly before him rose the
towering heights of the twin North and South Heads, guarding the
entrance to the triple harbours.</p>

<p>Almost due south from where sat, outlined the inner South Head
that, with middle head, forms the entrance to Port Jackson.
Between those heads streamed the commerce of the State, almost
continuously during the 24 hours of the day. Away north was
shining the light of Grotto Point. Beyond that lay the queerly
hand-shaped Middle Harbour, across the bottom of which stretched
the long point of land known as The Spit.</p>

<p>Far to the north-east twinkled the lights of the pleasure town
of Manly. About half-way, and almost hiding the town from Middle
Head, jutted Dobroyd Point forming, with the North Head, the
entrance to North Harbour. Due east, on the long slope of North
Head, the buildings of the Quarantine Station showed indistinctly
beneath the waning light of the three-quarter moon.</p>

<p>Phelps lighted a cigarette and sat down on the ledge of rock.
A late ferry-boat was hurrying across the waters in the direction
of Manly, its brightly-lit decks throwing quaint shadows over the
silent waters. A few minutes later, another ferry slid into view,
close in shore, its decks almost deserted. It was the last boat
from Balmoral to Circular Quay. So close did it skirt the Head
that the constable could have thrown a stone on its decks.</p>

<p>There were no signs of the Phantom Launch in the silent
waters. If the boat came at all it would probably be at a later
hour of the night. Phelps did not feel at all certain that the
boat would return to Myella Cove. The men on the launch had
appeared to be satisfied with their work on the mysterious box.
Had it not been for the message from Detective Headquarters, he
would have raced round to the cove and dug up the box. It might
possibly contain some clue to the Phantom Launch. Perhaps the
next night, after&mdash;</p>

<p>Why had Superintendent Hanson requested Sergeant Miller to
place a watch on Middle Harbour for the Phantom Launch? What did
Headquarters know of the boat? He had made his report of the
queer happenings at Myella Cove the previous night, but that
report had remained in the hands of Sergeant Miller.</p>

<p>Detective Headquarters were interested in the Phantom Launch.
For what reason? Were they interested in the box the men from the
mystery boat had buried in the sands at Myella Cove? Phelps
almost wished the Sergeant had forwarded his report to Phillip
Street, instead of retaining it under the plea that it was
exaggerated or untrue. The constable had some slight satisfaction
that Sergeant Miller must now be feeling uncomfortable. The story
of the entry of the Phantom Launch&mdash;the same boat
Superintendent Hanson was seeking&mdash;into Myella Cove would
certainly attract attention, and Miller would be asked to account
for the delay.</p>

<p>"Duty or pleasure, Constable Phelps?" A quiet, grave voice
spoke from behind the seated constable.</p>

<p>"Jove! Mr. Lister. You gave me quite a start."</p>

<p>"Humph!" The newcomer, a tall, thin man, about 32 to 33 years
of age, walked from the track to the ledge of rock and sat down
beside the constable. "If I didn't know better, I might believe
you were suffering from a common complaint that requires solitude
and moonlight as a palliative."</p>

<p>"You know better, Mr. Lister." Phelps laughed quietly.</p>

<p>"I'm guessing." Sydney Lister drew from his pocket an evening
paper. "I find Constable Phelps perched on a ledge of rock,
gazing earnestly out towards the Heads. A few hours ago I read an
intriguing paragraph in the <i>Evening Moon</i>. I may be
mistaken, but I scent a connection."</p>

<p>"A queer paragraph in the paper?" The constable swung round
eagerly towards his companion. "What was it, Mr. Lister? I didn't
get a paper this evening."</p>

<p>Lister managed, by the little light of the moon, to find two
paragraphs on the front page and pointed them out to Phelps.</p>

<p>The constable produced his electric torch and threw a beam of
light at the printing. He read the paragraphs twice; the second
time slowly and thoughtfully.</p><br>

<p class="headline">MAN TAKEN FROM OVERSEAS BOAT</p>

<p class="newspaper">Captain Anstey, of the British mail-boat,
which arrived at Sydney this morning, reports an uncommon
incident on the voyage between Melbourne and Sydney. Three miles
outside the heads, a fast motor-launch came alongside the mail
boat, and hailed a passenger standing on the lower deck. A few
sentences were exchanged and the passenger threw a suitcase down
on the launch, following himself. The launch immediately darted
away at an incredible speed.</p>

<p class="newspaper">The police are seeking information as to a
long, narrow, high-powered speed-launch, no funnel nor mast,
painted silver-grey, with absolutely silent engine.</p>

<p><br> "Not much of a description," commented Phelps guardedly,
returning the newspaper to Lister. "You'd have thought seamen
could have provided a better one. If the launch was alongside the
mail boat for any length of time, the officer on watch would
surely read the name on the bows or stern."</p>

<p>Lister did not reply. He was gazing out over the Harbour,
towards the Heads. The constable waited, watching his companion
curiously.</p>

<p>"Looking for the Phantom Launch, Mr. Lister?" Phelps asked the
question with a slight laugh.</p>

<p>"So that is the name you have given it at the police station?"
Lister turned towards the constable. "I guessed you were up here
on watch for the strange launch, directly I saw you. Well, you'll
have your search for nothing, I'm afraid, constable. The launch
is not likely to try that game on two succeeding nights, even if
a mail boat was due tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"What do you know, Mr. Lister?" Phelps turned quickly.</p>

<p>"Know?" Lister's lean face broke into a swift smile. "I know
just what the newspaper states&mdash;and that Constable Phelps is
watching at midnight on Middle Head. The two facts lie together,
but I can't make more than two of them. They're independent
units."</p>

<p>"Walt a moment." The constable sat thoughtful for a minute.
"You're a yachtsman Mr. Lister; do you know a boat in the
Harbour, or the river, answering to that description?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I do." Lister stood beside the shelf of rock on
which Phelps was seated. "Personally, I have no time for speed
boats. They make too much commotion on the Harbour, They should
be banished outside the Heads."</p>

<p>"This boat is absolutely noiseless," urged Phelps.</p>

<p>"Then what drives her?" Lister flashed the question back
immediately. "There's no silencer that can make an internal
combustion engine nearly noiseless. Electricity might be the
motive power, but I do not think there are accumulators that
would give an electrically-driven boat any great radius."</p>

<p>"I saw her last night," Phelps answered. "I know you'll say
nothing, Mr. Lister. I saw her last night and I know she's
noiseless. There was not a sound."</p>

<p>Very briefly, Phelps recounted his adventure with the Phantom
Launch at Myella cove the previous evening. Lister sat
thoughtful. When the constable described the wooden box he had
dug from the sands, the man became alert.</p>

<p>"What did you do with the box, Phelps?"</p>

<p>"Buried it again. I was instructed to dig it up, and take it
to the station, when orders for this watch on the Heads came
through. Suppose I'll go for it tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Take my advice and leave it there." Lister spoke carefully.
"With that box under the sands at Myella Cove you have a lure for
the Phantom Launch. Keep the box there, and keep someone watching
it. Before long you will be able to catch the launch, and then
the mystery of the box will be automatically solved. If you dig
up that box, and the men on the launch go to Myella Cove, and do
not find it, they will clear away, and you will have all your
work to do over again."</p>

<p>"There's something in that." Phelps mused for a moment. "I'll
have a talk to the Serg&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let him forget it," Lister interrupted. "Your report will be
in the hands of the C.I.B. tomorrow morning, anyway. You will
have to be approached before they can find the box. Perhaps
you'll have a chance to object to the removal of the box before
further information regarding the Phantom Launch is
obtained."</p>

<p>"You think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which way did the Phantom Launch go after leaving Myella
Cove?" interrupted Lister.</p>

<p>"Up-river."</p>

<p>"You're certain."</p>

<p>"Yep. Absolutely certain. Why?"</p>

<p>"You saw the Phantom Launch after midnight&mdash;say between
one and two o'clock. She ran into Myella Cove and then turned up
river. That means she went through the city and up the Parramatta
or Lane Cove River. Yet, a few hours later, she was outside the
Heads, taking a passenger from the mail boat."</p>

<p>"Looks strange," muttered the constable, scratching his
head.</p>

<p>"There's something more than strange in it. Who was the
passenger removed from the mail boat? Was he removed voluntarily
or involuntarily? Where did the Phantom Launch land him, or is he
still on board the boat? Did the boat come into the Harbour
again, or did it seek shelter in some place along the coast?"
Lister asked the questions half to himself.</p>

<p>"The Harbour's rather unsafe for it, now," commented Phelps,
with a grin, "They've put up a defiance of the Customs, and,
although the newspapers don't say much, I'll bet the Water Police
are searching the waters of the Harbour at full pressure. No, Mr.
Lister. She's outside the Harbour and won't come in again until
the matter's blown over."</p>

<p>"No!" Lister was watching out towards the Heads, intently.
"What do you make of that, Constable Phelps?"</p>

<p>On the moon-silvered waters between the high heads appeared a
slight wave of foam, approaching at a terrific rate. The two men
watched as it came rolling towards them. All they could
distinguish was the cresting wave, breaking back in a shower of
foam, yet ever rolling swiftly towards them. For some minutes it
held directly towards Middle Head, then, suddenly, it swerved to
the north and entered Middle Harbour.</p>

<p>The boat was travelling at a terrific pace, yet not a sound
broke the silence of the night. It was as if it was a
shadow&mdash;the ghostly vehicle of some uneasy spirit doomed to
haunt the Harbour during the silent hours of night. Quickly it
came, and passed.</p>

<p>"Gone up Middle Harbour." There was a note of exultation in
Phelps' voice. "They've made their mistake there. Coming, Mr.
Lister? I'm going back to Balmoral. In an hour the Spit Bridge
will be closed, and the Phantom Launch bottled up."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">CONVINCED that the Phantom Launch had sought
shelter in Middle Harbour, Constable Phelps hurried back to
Balmoral to organise means to close the waters at the Spit. A
little more than a mile up from the Harbour entrance a long
finger of sand stretches from the west shore out into the waters,
almost to the opposite shore. This finger of land is known as
"The Spit," and the continuing bridge passes the tram-lines from
North Sydney to Manly.</p>

<p>The bridge, from the end of the Spit to the north-east shore
forms almost a gate across Middle Harbour. The bridge is low, and
only the smallest boats can pass beneath; the larger vessels
requiring the spans of the bridge to be lifted. The Phantom
Launch, however, could pass under the bridge without difficulty,
for it had neither masts nor structure above the deck.</p>

<p>The Harbour contains numerous inlets, islets, coves, and creek
mouths, providing a multitude of hiding-places for any small boat
wishing to avoid attention. There is little settlement around the
coast-line of the Harbour, and most of the waterways and islets
are in a wild state.</p>

<p>Sydney Lister slowly followed the constable along the cliff
paths, towards Balmoral. At the time he had pointed out the
Phantom Launch to Phelps he had been possessed by the spirit of
the chase. Now that he had seen the mystery boat enter the natural trap of Middle Harbour, and the door closed upon her, he began to look at the matter from a more sentimental angle.</p>

<p>So far as he was aware the crew of the Phantom Launch was only
guilty of moving a passenger from a mail boat before
<i>pratique</i> had been granted by the Customs and Health
authorities. True, they had made a bad precedent; one to be
discouraged by fine, and even imprisonment, but certainly not
criminal. To the average person it was the ordinary game of wits
played by many law-abiding citizens when they return to their
native land after a foreign tour. Customs charges and regulations
are fair game. There is an element of sport in defeating the
well-trained officers&mdash;the "sin" element of the contest
being in discovery.</p>

<p>When the facts of the abduction of the passenger from the
<i>Arathusa</i> became public property there would be a general
laugh at the "slick" manner in which the Customs had been evaded.
Almost certainly there would be imitators; the matter ending,
probably, in Customs officers accompanying overseas ships while
they were in Australian waters. The Customs would press for the
discovery and capture of the Phantom Launch and her crew. The
eyes of the continent would be turned towards Middle Harbour,
while the Water Police searched the many miles of waterways.
Public sympathy would be on the side of the hunted, and when the
search ended in the inevitable discovery of the Phantom Launch,
her crew would be elevated to the heroic.</p>

<p>Lister passed through the little town of Balmoral, and on the
outskirts of the town, came to a small cottage, within a hundred
yards of the northern end of the bay. It was nearly two years
since he had first rented the place for the summer. The house had
suited him, and with a few alterations he found the winter months
comfortable in it. He had purchased the place, and was making it
his home.</p>

<p>A well-known newspaper proprietor had described Sydney Lister
as "a good newspaperman spoilt." Asked to define his statement,
he added:&mdash;"The fellow's got too much money. A journalist in
this country is only good when he's dead broke and up against
it."</p>

<p>Lister passed into the cottage. A lamp was burning on the
table in the front room, and beside it a tray holding glasses and
a soda syphon. The spirit-cabinet had been moved from the
miniature sideboard, and stood beside the tray. Over the back of
a dilapidated lounge-chair hung his working coat. Lister dropped
his hat on the table and slipped into the comfortable old coat.
He mixed a drink, and carried it to the rear of the cottage.</p>

<p>The back door opened on to a sandy yard. From the back step a
bricked path had been laid to a well-built shed, standing along
the rear fence. Lister went to the shed and opened it with a key,
hung on his watch-chain. The interior of the shed was fitted up
somewhat similar to the wireless room of an ocean liner. A door
on the right led to another room, in which stood a small,
powerful oil engine and dynamo, carefully shielded to prevent
interference.</p>

<p>Lister spent much of his time in this wireless room, sometimes
remaining there the better part of the night. A great deal of the
apparatus in the room was unique, built by himself, many of the
instruments his own invention. Against the left wall stood an
eight-valve receiving set, one of the most powerful in Australia.
It had become a habit to spend the early hours of the morning by
this set, idly travelling from length to length, and from power
to power.</p>

<p>During the past three nights he had been puzzled by certain
sounds that come over the air, to be caught on his delicate
instruments. At first they had seemed to come from afar but now
he believed they originated within a few miles from his room.
They were not spoken words: merely a regular "tick tick," like
the workings of a watch, suspended close against a microphone.
Another thing, they never came on the same wave-length. Since he
had first heard them they had covered quite an appreciable number
of lengths, often three or four the same night.</p>

<p>Sitting down at the eight valve receiver, Lister tuned-in to
37 metres, the wave length on which he had detected the
"tick-tick" the previous night. There was no response, and he
slowly tuned to a higher wave. At 56 metres, he caught the first
"tick," and commenced to amplify, until he had the sound filling
the little room. They had no meaning; entirely regular, they went
on for over half an hour, with a monotonous regularity that
bored.</p>

<p>Someone must be playing a joke. The tick of a watch on the air
could only be a signal, unless the sender was altogether
inconsequent. It might be possible to discover what the signals
meant. Going into the machine-room, Lister started the engine.
Hanging his watch before a very delicate microphone, Lister
transmitted the sound a few metres higher than the strange
ticking. He lowered the wave length gradually until the sound of
his watch mingled with the strange "tick" on his receiver. All of
a sudden the strange watch ceased to tick. Lister held the
signal. For a space of twenty the strange "tick" came again.</p>

<p>The "tick" was certainly a signal. Lister waited a few
minutes, and then placed the tick of his watch on the air at 70
meters. Still the "tick-tick" continued. Very slowly he tuned
down to a lower wave-length. At 65 metres, the tick suddenly
stopped. Lister held the length. For a space of twenty seconds
nothing happened. He could hear the gentle "tap-tap" of his
watch, swinging before the microphone. The strange "tick" had
ceased. With a quiet motion, Lister switched off the transmitter.
He rose from his seat, and crossed to the eight-valve set. His
fingers were on the switch, when a low whisper crept through the
room.</p>

<p>"Silver Swan! Silver Swan!" it was difficult to discover
whether the speaker was a man or a woman, the whisper was so
delicate.</p>

<p>There was an interval of silence. Again came the small, faint
voice:&mdash;"Silver Swan! Silver Swan!"</p>

<p>The interval of silence recurred. Lister stood beside the
receiver, undecided. Someone was calling, and he did not know how
to answer.</p>

<p>Silver Swan! What meaning had the words? It might be a
recognition code&mdash;the identification words of some
experimenter. Around Sydney were scattered quite a number of
experimental stations. At one time or another, Lister had been in
communication with most of them. Sometimes one of them would put
on the air a code word for identification, but mainly the owner
of the station used his name.</p>

<p>"Silver Swan!" Lister's mind leaped to the scene on the cliffs
of Middle Harbour. Again he saw the wall of water driving through
the outer Heads towards where Phelps and he stood. Again he saw
the swirling waters swing to the left, and behind them the long,
low shadow of the Phantom Launch. Surely, it might be said to
resemble in some faint way a Silver Swan, homing in the late
hours of the night.</p>

<p>Automatically he stepped to the transmitter, and switched on
power. Again he threw on the air the slow "tick-tick" of his
watch. Allowing an interval of exactly 20 seconds to pass, he
switched off and listened. A long pause, and the words came again
to him.</p>

<p>"Silver Swan! Silver Swan!"</p>

<p>Lister had recovered his watch from the microphone, and had
placed it in his pocket. Again he threw in the power, first
switching the microphone out of circuit. With hasty fingers he
reduced amplification to normal, and switched in again.</p>

<p>"Silver Swan! Silver Swan!"</p>

<p>"Police guarding the Spit bridge. Silver Swan caught."</p>

<p>What impulse caused him to couple "Silver Swan" with the
Phantom Launch? Lister spoke without thought. He had deliberately
conveyed to the unknown listener the fact that the police were
aware of the identity of the Silver Swan with the boat they had
seen rushing to its refuge in Middle Harbour.</p>

<p>For a long space there was silence. Lister thought he had
frightened the speaker away. Again he switched on power and bent
towards the microphone. He was about to call when the loud
speaker came to life. It was the ticking of a watch. Lister sat
back in his chair and counted the ticks. At the 56th tick the
sounds stopped. An interval of silence.</p>

<p>"Thanks, stranger." The voice was still the strange, low,
sweet sound. It was followed by light, girlish laughter.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">FOR about half an hour Lister tried every device
he could think of to attract the attention of the person who had
called "Silver Swan," but without success. At length he gave up
the fruitless task, and went to bed. He was irritated, mainly
with himself. This mysterious speed-boat, that Constable Phelps
had named the Phantom Launch, and which had been called "Silver
Swan" over the air, threatened to involve him in a maze of
indefinite speculation. What business was it of his? It was for
the Customs and health authorities, with their widespread
organisations and the help of the police, to hunt down and
capture the fugitive boat. It might be that, if the authorities
came to him and asked his help&mdash;But that was fruitless
theory. What help could he give them?</p>

<p>So far as he knew, he possessed one item of information the
authorities had not yet obtained. He believed he had a definite
link between the Phantom Launch and the Silver Swan. If that was
so, then it should be possible to trace "Silver Swan." More than
probable the boat was registered with one of the numerous yacht
or motor-boat clubs around Sydney waters. Possibly, during the
hours of light, the Silver Swan posed as an innocent and
moderately-speeded pleasure cruiser. Only after nightfall were
the controls set to their limit, and the Silver Swan became the
Phantom Launch, openly laughing at and defying authority.</p>

<p>As a responsible citizen of the State it might be his duty to
inform the police of the voice on the air and the probable
connection of the hunted Phantom Launch with the lawful Silver
Swan. Lister felt he had that duty to perform. But, if he went to
the police, would he be compelled to confess that some impulse
had urged him to warn the crew of the speed-boat that the
authorities were taking steps to bottle them up in Middle
Harbour? Awkward questions would be asked; the register of
wireless licenses would be combed; many quite innocent
experimenters would be occasioned a deal of trouble; and only
because some person had wanted to leave the mail boat before the
ship's arrival against the wharf.</p>

<p>Lister decided to keep his own counsel. He had only one clue
of the many that undoubtedly littered the harbour. There was the
wooden box in Myella Cove; certainly the boat itself, bottled up
and certain of discovery. Yet the wireless puzzle persisted. He
was casting back along the allotted wave lengths of Australian
experimenters when he [?] own counsel.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It seems that there are words missing in
this paragraph. Unfortunately, the newspaper from which the text
was taken is the only newspaper known to have published this
serial. The story was not published in book form.]</p>

<p><br> HE awoke to find the sun high in the heavens, and the
questions he had striven to put from him the previous night
awaiting his consciousness. After breakfast he went to the
wireless room and examined the instruments. They were as he had
left them the previous night. He switched the power on to the
transmitter, to find the air dead. The eight-valve was set for 56
metres and, without altering the length, Lister amplified to the
limit. There were no sounds coming over the air.</p>

<p>On the wall hung a directory of allotted wave lengths. Lister
ran his eyes down the list. Neither 56 metres nor 68 metres, the
previous night's set of his transmitter, were registered on the
list; his own personal allocation was the nearest. Lister made a
record of the set of his instruments, and then turned his dials
off the lengths. That night he would try again to get in touch
with the mysterious voice over the air, or with the "Silver
Swan." Until he had succeeded or definitely failed, he would keep
his own counsel.</p>

<p>Lister had an appointment in the city that morning. After
lingering in the wireless room for some time, he took his hat and
wandered down to the ferry wharf. At the bookstall he purchased
the morning papers, and searched for some mention of the Phantom
launch. One or two of the papers had made passing references to
the passenger on the mail boat who had been taken off by the
launch, but it was evident the police were concealing Constable
Phelps' watch on Middle Head and the entry of the Phantom Launch
into Middle Harbour.</p>

<p>"Why the <i>Daily Pictorial</i>, my friend?" Lister swung
round to face Tony Weston, the star reporter of the paper
mentioned. "Surely our wireless expert has not deserted the many
technical journals in favour of a general newspaper?"</p>

<p>"Hullo, Tony." Lister shifted up the seat. Then he noticed
that Weston was accompanied by a lady, and rose to his feet. "I
beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"My sister." Weston spoke carelessly. "Ysobel. Let me
introduce Mr. Sydney Lister, a lucky man with nothing to do but
explore the vibrations of the air."</p>

<p>Lister bowed to the tall, dark-eyed girl, and met her glance
surveying him with some interest. He had seen Ysobel Weston about
the small town, but had not connected her with his late
journalistic comrade, Tony Weston.</p>

<p>He bowed with some confusion; there seemed to be more than the
happening of a new acquaintance in her regard. Weston,
unconsciously, covered him.</p>

<p>"What's this about a Phantom Launch? Heard anything, Lister?
There was a good scoop in the <i>Moon</i> last night. The
<i>Pictorial</i> has a par., but not even mentioning the name of
the passenger who got away from the liner."</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Tony?" Lister was interested. Weston
was a recognised newspaper authority on mysteries.</p>

<p>"Some crook with a bit of cash who had no desire to run the
gauntlet of the police on the wharves."</p>

<p>"And the boat?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"High-powered, with incredible speed, yet absolutely noiseless
engines?" Lister spoke as if quoting from some report.</p>

<p>"Humph!" The journalist was about to continue when the
ferry-boat drew alongside the wharf. The three found seats on the
upper deck, some little distance from the bulk of the
passengers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lister knows more than he has told us, Tony." Ysobel
returned to the subject of the Phantom Launch, quietly, but
firmly.</p>

<p>"Possibly Anthony knows as much as I, Miss Weston." Lister was
afraid he had spoken carelessly. He had decided he did not want
his special knowledge of the voice on the air to be made public
for a time. "He referred to the Phantom Launch and that phrase
has a police flavour about it."</p>

<p>"Good guess," Weston grinned. "Reaching through space sharpens
the wits. I did have a talk with Sergeant Miller, and he used the
expression. I thought it good, and remembered it."</p>

<p>"He told you of the adventure at Myella Cove?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the watch on the Head last night. I met him down on
the beach, going in for a dip before work. From what he says,
they seem to have the Phantom Launch bottled up in Middle
Harbour."</p>

<p>"Suppose you've arranged for the story to be kept from the
afternoon papers?" Lister laughed. Weston appeared to have great
influence in the police force.</p>

<p>"No hope. They'll get the inside of the story. The Water
Police are at Middle Head now, with possibly all the disengaged
journalists in Sydney in close attendance, sweeping the waters
for the hidden launch. There won't be much news before night,
anyway, and then only if the boat makes a dash for liberty."</p>

<p>"They can lie hid for a month in Middle Harbour," objected the
wireless expert. "The place is a maze of waterways and
islands."</p>

<p>"Killarney." Ysobel spoke softly. "I love a ramble among the
islands; a real bit of wilderness, and yet but a few miles from
the centre of the big city. Last time we were up there we saw a
number of black swans."</p>

<p>"Silver Swan!" Lister spoke the words involuntarily, and under
his breath.</p>

<p>"What's that?" The newspaper man asked quickly. "Silver
Swan?"</p>

<p>"Miss Weston spoke of black swans. I thought of the
silver-grey launch as a silver swan."</p>

<p>Lister felt his explanation to be terribly weak. Weston said
nothing, but the expert sensed that he was suspicious.</p>

<p>"Black swans, silver swans, and possibly one or more of Tony's
geese," laughed Ysobel, quietly.</p>

<p>Lister looked round at the girl with a startled glance. Had
she uttered the two words, "Thanks, stranger," he would have been
certain Ysobel Weston was the girl whose voice came over the air
in the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>The idea was absurd. What could Anthony Weston's sister have
to do with the fugitive launch now hidden in Middle Harbour? He
had been thinking of the "voice" and that, in conjunction with
the slip he had made in mentioning "Silver Swan," had led his
imagination to run away with his reason.</p>

<p>The ferry-boat drew alongside the wharf at Circular Quay.
Ysobel went across the road to board a Pitt Street tram. The two
men walked up towards the <i>Daily Pictorial</i> offices.</p>

<p>"What are you doing this morning?" asked the newspaper man,
suddenly, as he halted at the door.</p>

<p>"Two or three calls, then to lunch at the club." Lister was
slightly astonished. Once Weston entered the doors of the
newspaper office, meals and ordinary happenings did not exist,
except as news.</p>

<p>"Right. May drop in to lunch at the club. One o'clock do? All
serene." Then, as Lister nodded and moved off: "Say, old man,
don't let that 'Silver Swan' stunt out to anyone. There may be a
lot behind it."</p>

<p>Before the expert could ask questions, the journalist pushed
through the revolving doors and disappeared. Lister had an
impulse to follow him, but after reflection shrugged his
shoulders and walked down quickly to Phillip Street. He had an
appointment with his solicitors within a few minutes, and the
questions on his lips could well wait until lunch time. Yet the
expert puzzled. What did Weston know? He had looked quite
startled when he let slip the word, "Silver Swan." Ysobel had
laughed, and her laughter was vaguely reminiscent of the voice
that had come to him over the air.</p>

<p>The journalist did not turn up at the club to lunch. Lister
waited for some time, and then went into the dining-room alone.
He had half-completed his meal when a pageboy called him to the
telephone.</p>

<p>"That you, Sydney?" It was Weston's voice on the wire. "Good.
I was afraid you might have gone home."</p>

<p>"Where are you? I waited lunch, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lunches have to wait." There was strain in the newspaper
man's voice. "Doing anything this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Nothing important. Thought of a tailor and a few similar
things of that nature."</p>

<p>"They can wait. Look here, old man. There's a bit of a mess
down Como way. Can you spare time to run down with me? I've a car
here and will pick you up."</p>

<p>"Anything special?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. I'm not talking over the wire. It's only an hour's run
and we may be gone three or four, all told. Come, if only for the
drive, old fellow."</p>

<p>Lister hesitated. Some impulse urged him to accept the
journalist's invitation. Weston was plainly agitated, and when
that astute individual was unbalanced over his daily work, events
were in the making. In past days the expert had worked with the
<i>Pictorial</i> star reporter, and always with interest and
appreciation.</p>

<p>"Right." He made up his mind, suddenly. "Anything you want me
to bring?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a good pair of eyes," Weston hesitated. "It's a
queer matter. Murdered man, and not a sign of how the affair
happened."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">TEN minutes later Anthony Weston drove up to the
doors of the Times Club in a small high-powered car. Lister was
standing on the pavement awaiting him. Weston nodded as the
expert got into the car, and started off abruptly, driving at
almost a reckless pace through the city traffic. Lister tried to
ask questions, but the reporter would only reply with nods and
grunts. They had passed through Tempe before Weston eased the
pace and turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"Suppose you're wondering what all the hurry's about, Syd?"
The newspaper man spoke in a seemingly careless tone. "Trouble is
the correspondent at Sutherland has managed to queer one of the
best stories we've had in the office of late. Instead of
forwarding the facts as they came into the police station, and
then going out to make inquiries, he tried to organise a scoop on
his own. Consequently the noon papers got on the streets with it
before we were absolutely certain a murder had been committed.
There's likely to be another when I get there."</p>

<p>"What do you know? Facts, I mean."</p>

<p>"Body of man discovered at Yaney's Inlet, about two miles
eastward from Como. Body on a patch of sand, and there does not
appear to be any visible means of death. Old man, possibly tramp,
certainly not of any standing. Death not from natural causes.
Left hand badly burned."</p>

<p>"That all?"</p>

<p>"That's what I got from the noon papers." Weston frowned.
"When we get to Como we may learn more. Detective-Sergeant
Priestly is in charge. Went from Headquarters about ten this
morning. He'll keep what he can for me. Pal of mine, y'know."</p>

<p>He lapsed into silence and increased the pace of the car in
spite of the awful roads they were bumping over. Six miles on
they came within sight of the George's River, and bumped slowly
down to Tom Ugly's punt. They had a fair wait here, sufficient to
cause Weston to threaten several articles on governmental
disregard of public welfare. At length they crossed and drove
into the little town of Como. There the journalist made direct
for the police station to find the constable in charge was
absent. A man, loafing about, was able to place them on the right
road to where the tragedy had taken place, and offered to
accompany them as guide. Weston seized the opportunity to gather
local gossip, and Lister relinquished his seat to the man. All
Weston gained was some items of local geography.</p>

<p>They were travelling over a sandy bush-road, filled with
sharp-pointed stumps of saplings. Weston had to devote most of
his attention to the car. Continually they were catching glimpses
of the river, now widening out to quite a broad stream, and
coming to its junction with Botany Bay. At other times they
appeared to be far inland, surrounded with a scanty,
poverty-looking bush, the wheels of the machine sinking
deep into the yielding sands.</p>

<p>"Turn here." The man spoke suddenly, pointing down a narrow
track leading to their left. There was barely room between the
trees for the car to pass, but Weston drove determinedly on. He
had no intention of walking over that bush road so long as he
could keep wheels turning.</p>

<p>The scrub became thicker. Once or twice they had to leave the
track and make a detour because of large stumps in the centre of
the road. At length they passed round a patch of thick scrub, and
came out above a small sandy beach. At one end of the sand patch
a small bluff stood, rising about fifteen feet above the
water-level. Against this bluff stood a group of men.</p>

<p>There was a small patch of clearing just above the beach.
Weston ran his car on to this, and shut down the engine. Then,
with Lister by his side, and their guide tailing them, he made
his way to the group of officials.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Lister." A slight, grey man with keen blue eyes came
from the group to meet them. "Wondering when you'd get here."</p>

<p>"Only heard of it just before lunch," grumbled the journalist.
"What do you know?"</p>

<p>"Very little." Inspector Mack pointed to a bundle of clothing
close up against the bluff. "He's lying there. I won't have him
moved until the doctor comes."</p>

<p>"Doctor?" Weston raised his eyebrows. "Thought I heard
Priestly came down here at ten. Where's the doctor? Can I see the
body?"</p>

<p>"Like to know myself where that fool doctor is." The Inspector
spoke irritably. "He was sent for about eleven, and hasn't turned
up yet. See him? Yes, later. Wait until the doctor's made his
examination. So far as I can see, the cause of death is likely to
be a puzzle."</p>

<p>"Name?" Weston pointed to the body, at the same time pulling a
pad of papers from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Don't know." Mack shrugged his shoulders. "I told you there's
nothing to give out at present. I'll say he's a roughly dressed
man, about fifty to fifty-five years of age, tanned, bearded,
grey-haired, about middle height, and sparsely-built, and you're
as wise as I am. Wish that fool doctor would come."</p>

<p>Almost as the Inspector spoke another car appeared at the top
of the bank and a man alighted. He walked down slowly on to the
sands towards where Mack was standing. The Inspector advanced to
meet him, and for some minutes the two men stood talking in
undertones.</p>

<p>"Doctor Macdermott, from Sutherland." The Inspector introduced
the doctor as they came up to Lister and Weston.</p>

<p>The doctor gave a quick look at the two men, and then turned
abruptly towards the dead body, without speaking. Lister looked
after him curiously. He was a youngish-looking old man, very
fair, tall, and with the stooping shoulders of a scholar. The
eyes were blue and of exceeding hardness; his hair was white, and
flowed in waves over the broad forehead. There was a look of
settled pain on the face, a queer, laughing look that set Lister
wondering.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong with the doctor?" Weston asked the question in
a low voice, catching the Inspector by the arm. "He looks
worried."</p>

<p>"Been out at a case all night," Mack whispered rapidly,
watching the man advance to where the body lay. "Clever chap,
too."</p>

<p>He went quickly to where the doctor knelt by the body, Lister
pressed forward with the other men. The Inspector's description
of the dead man was good. He was a typical hobo, and, seeing him
tying there, apparently asleep, one instinctively looked around
for the accompanying swag.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour the men stood round watching the
doctor working methodically over the body. At length he stood up
and motioned to the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Take him to the station, Mack. There's something queer
here."</p>

<p>"Poison?"</p>

<p>"No. Heart failure&mdash;and with one of the strongest hearts
in the district. Know him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I do. He came to me about a week ago. Complained of pains in
the chest. Examined him and found he was structurally sound
enough to live to a hundred. Now he's dead. Humph."</p>

<p>"Pay you, doctor?" Weston asked the question, gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes. New five-pound note. Got it at home now." He turned
quickly towards the inspector. "Suppose you'll want that note,
Mack. Thought so. Well, remember, four nine-six is my
money&mdash;if you won't allow me to charge for telling a man
he's as sound as a bell. I claim the whole fiver. Money earned,
y'know."</p>

<p>"What about the burn on the palm of the hand?" asked Lister,
curiously. He had strolled over to where the dead man lay, and
had looked for the burn mentioned by Weston while driving
down.</p>

<p>Dr. Macdermott turned sharply towards the corpse. His face had
suddenly tensed. A quick glance at the hand, end he moved away,
shrugging his shoulders, indifferently.</p>

<p>"Have that burn when he came to your surgery, Macdermott?"
asked the Inspector sharply.</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge. No." The doctor spoke positively. "I
remember him exposing both palms while he was talking to me.
There was no sign of a burn on them. What does it matter? Tramps,
like him, acquire burns handling their bush-fires."</p>

<p>The Inspector had drawn a constable aside, and was speaking in
a low tone. The others had moved some little distance from the
corpse, and were listening to a friendly argument between
Detective-Sergeant Priestly and Weston regarding unsolved
mysteries in New South Wales.</p>

<p>Another vehicle came into sight at the top of the bank. It was
the motor-ambulance from Sutherland. The Inspector motioned for
the driver to come down on the sands and pull up beside the
corpse. There was a little delay in getting the heavy machine in
a position by the body. At last it was lifted in, and the
ambulance climbed the bank and disappeared along the dirt road.
Slowly the Inspector and Priestly walked up to the clearing where
the motor cars were parked. At the top of the bank the Inspector
looked back and called to the journalist.</p>

<p>"Coming into Sutherland, Weston?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. Maybe." Weston looked undecided. "Say, Mack.
Where did you find the man's swag?"</p>

<p>"Haven't found it. Don't think he had one." The Inspector
beckoned to the constables to follow, and walked to the official
cars, leaving Weston and Lister alone on the small beach.</p>

<p>"There goes the official brain," commented Weston, a wry smile
on his lips. "The man's a swaggie, but hasn't a swag. He's dead,
but there's not a mark on him. What did you make of that burn,
Syd?"</p>

<p>THE question was asked so suddenly that it startled the
expert. Weston shrugged his shoulders, and turned to examine the
beach where the dead man had lain.</p>

<p>"It was a burn&mdash;rather a severe one," said Lister slowly.
"I&mdash;I don't think it had anything to do with the cause of
death."</p>

<p>"No more than it had to do with the man's camp-fire." Weston
was seated on the sands, scraping a deep trench, absently. "He
might burn his fingers, his knuckles, or the back of his hand,
but the palm&mdash;no. That's a queer place to acquire a burn
under ordinary circumstance?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;" commenced Lister.</p>

<p>"For the sake of little devils don't think. There's that
parcel of police going off happily to Sutherland, and half a
hundred questions unanswered."</p>

<p>"For instance?"</p>

<p>"Where's the man's swag? No good telling me he hasn't one. He
had a swag, and it's somewhere about."</p>

<p>For some time Weston hunted round the bluff, searching every
piece of bush jutting down on to the beach, without success.
Lister gave his best endeavours to the search. At the end of the
hour they found themselves against the bluff, tired and
disappointed.</p>

<p>"Looks as if Inspector Mack was right. The man did not have a
swag here," remarked Lister, squatting down on the sands.</p>

<p>Weston had remained standing. He was looking up the line of
open water towards the George River. The bluff cut off most of
the view. Weston walked to the water, and stood with the tiny
wavelets almost lapping the toes of his boots. For some time he
remained there, gazing around him. Then he looked down at his
boots. The waters were now lapping almost to cover the toecaps.
He stepped back on to dry sand, and stood looking at the
impressions of his boots slowly disappearing under the influence
of the tide. A few minutes and they had disappeared completely.
He turned and walked over to where Lister sat.</p>

<p>"Notice anything, Syd?" he asked, almost too carelessly.</p>

<p>"Notice what?"</p>

<p>"High tide in about an hour. The water will be almost up to
the foot of the bluff&mdash;certainly up to where the man
lay."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"There were no footmarks around the man, or those blockheads
of police would have guarded them like a jewel warehouse. I
looked for footprints when I came down here. There were none,
only the imprints of the men tramping about, thinking they were
detecting crime. What do you make of that, Syd?"</p>

<p>"First I'm wondering at your using the word 'crime.' So far as
I can see, the man died from natural causes."</p>

<p>The journalist sat playing with the sand. He was staring
vacantly out over the inlet and did not reply for some
minutes.</p>

<p>"There's a crime, sure enough, Syd," he observed, quietly, but
earnestly. "There are no footmarks here, because the man came
from around the bluff, and the tide's washed out all marks up to
the head of the bluff. We'll find plenty when we get above high
tide mark round the corner.</p>

<p>"What of the 'crime' theory, Tony?" Lister looked up at his
chum, who had regained his feet.</p>

<p>"Of course it's a crime." Weston was still grazing out over
the waters. "Why, the murderer had the cheek to send a letter to
the <i>Pictorial</i> telling us where to find the body." He
turned suddenly on Lister with a rising inflection in his voice:
"Do you think those police could find a corpse out here unless
they were told where to look? No."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">THE tide had risen until it lapped almost on to
the spot where the dead body had rested. Weston continued to
stand, gazing thoughtfully across the waters. Suddenly he roused
himself, shaking his body in somewhat the manner of a dog coming
out of water. He turned on his heels, and led the way round the
bluff.</p>

<p>A few minutes' search of the sands on the north side of the
bluff and the journalist pointed to some faint marks. They were
much wind-blown, but were distinguishable as footprints. The
first showed some little distance from the point of the bluff, as
if the man had walked along the firmer sands at the water's edge.
The track suddenly turned and led to the low bank. Then along it
for a short distance, and up and over it into the bush.</p>

<p>"Now for a search." Weston whistled happily to himself. "This
is going to be some job. Can't be far, however, for the old
fellow came out of the scrub soon after leaving his camp. The
walking along the sands would be much better than through that
low scrub. Spread out a bit, old chap, and walk straight into the
bush. Look for the camp, not the footmarks. They'd be impossible
to trace in all this muck."</p>

<p>Spacing out to about ten yards apart, the two men walked
slowly into the bush. Weston's guess had not been wrong. Less
than fifty yards from the banks of the inlet, Lister noticed the
remains of a camp fire under a clump of low trees beside a small
clearing. He called to his chum. A few yards from the fireplace,
concealed in the bush, they found the swag.</p>

<p>"Now, what's the reason of that?" Weston halted some yards
from the ashes of the fire, and looked around him. "The old man
must have used this camp for quite a few days. He left it, and
went to the bluff, possibly to meet someone. Before he left he
rolled his swag, and hid it away. Looks as if he was intending to
travel."</p>

<p>"There seems no doubt but that he left his camp to meet
someone," answered Lister, thoughtfully. "We can take it that
there was an appointment at the bluff, and that the old man did
not intend to remain in his camp by the Inlet after he had kept
the appointment. Everything's set for a quick get-away. Here's
the swag, billy, and tucker-bag. He kept the appointment, and was
killed."</p>

<p>"So far, good." Weston was walking slowly round the camp.
"You've got the stage set, so far, Syd. Now, will you explain why
he did not bring his visitor to his camp? That would be bush-way.
We'll take it as understood that the man he went to meet did not
know where the old man's camp was, but knew the way from Como to
the bluff. Now, why the argument and the murder at the bluff? A
bushman would certainly suggest that they walk back to his camp
and boil the billy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the murderer struck at sight."</p>

<p>"No." Weston was looking down at the ashes of the fire. "To
suppose that the quarrel took place before the appointment at the
bluff is absurd. Men on bad terms don't meet like that. The
thing's a puzzle, and for the time we must pass it. Now we'll
have a look at the swag."</p>

<p>"Better leave that to the police."</p>

<p>"Not on your life." Weston looked up from unrolling the swag.
"When I've had my look I'll roll it again, and leave it here for
the police to find. You can bet all you're worth, Syd, they won't
give me more information than I can wring out of them; so I'm not
going to be careful of their feelings."</p>

<p>A couple of rags, a change of clothes, a few odd pieces of
underclothing, the whole wrapped in an old waterproof sheet,
formed the contents of the swag. Weston tackled the collection
methodically. The rugs were old and none too clean. He laid them
aside. The odds and ends, and a collection of small utility
objects, gave no results. Lastly came the change of clothing.</p>

<p>Here Weston made his find. In the breast pocket of an old coat
lay a rather dilapidated pocket-book. It was well-filled, and
secured by a buttoned strap. The journalist spread one of the
rugs on the sand, and emptied the contents of the pocket-book out
on it. There were a few old papers of little value, mostly
cuttings from newspapers, and one letter, new and fresh.</p>

<p>"Gideah Brading." Weston read the name on the envelope, a
puzzled frown on his face. "Who the devil is, or was, Gideah
Brading? I've heard that name somewhere."</p>

<p>"Sounds familiar to me." Lister had an indistinct recollection
of having heard the name frequently in past days. "Have a look
inside the envelope, old man. You're getting quite early
Victorian. From what I've heard in that era you were supposed to
examine the stamp and the outside of the envelope; then hold a
guessing competition as to the contents; lastly, and with fearful
awe, open it, and express surprise that you had not been able to
guess the subject-matter and the writer."</p>

<p>"All serene, old man." Weston laughed up at his chum. "Now for
the solution of the mystery."</p>

<p>The envelope contained a single sheet of common paper. Weston
handled it with great care. There was no address on the paper. It
was headed "Sydney." and the date, three days before. There was
no prefix, and only two lines of typewriting:&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="telegram">THE USUAL SUM OF MONEY HAS BEEN PLACED WHERE
YOU KNOW. THIS IS THE FINAL PAYMENT.</p>

<p><br> "No signature," observed the journalist, placing the
letter on the rug, and examining the newspaper cuttings. "I'll
make a copy of the wording. Dare say after the police get their
paws on it I shan't see it again."</p>

<p>"There seems to be some padding at the back of this case,"
observed Lister, fingering the case curiously.</p>

<p>"'Ware finger-prints." warned Weston, quickly. "Mack will
guess I had a look in the swag, but he'll pass that over unless
he finds we have obliterated some important clues. Then he'll
raise Cain."</p>

<p>Lister took out his handkerchief, and held the pocket-book in
it. At one end he found a small flap, and looked into a long
pouch running the whole length of the purse. Inside was a wad of
papers. Taking care not to touch them with his fingers, he drew
them out, and dropped them on the rug.</p>

<p>"Good lor'!" Weston looked up in amazement. "The man was a
millionaire."</p>

<p>The journalist took from his pocket-knife a small pair of
tweezers. With these he picked up each note separately, counting
its denomination as he did so.</p>

<p>"Ninety-seven pounds ten shillings," he observed, when he had
them arranged in a little pile. He tore a piece of paper from his
pad and with it held the notes while Lister held the case open.
They had some difficulty in replacing the notes without touching
them with their bare fingers, but accomplished it at last. Lister
closed the pocket-book, and dropped it on the rug.</p>

<p>"We don't have to decide what we're going to do with the
swag," he said, grimly. "We have to take it to the police
station. There's no sense in leaving a hundred pounds in the bush
for anyone to find."</p>

<p>Weston nodded agreement. For some minutes he worked, repacking
the swag.</p>

<p>When he had secured the last strap, he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of asking you to remain here on watch
while I went for the Como constable," he said, lifting the swag
to his shoulder. "But that means delay, and I want to get back to
the city. Well leave a mark on the beach opposite to where the
camp is in the bush. He'll find it with that for direction."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were back at the bluff. Weston
dropped the swag to the ground.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of things want explaining," he grumbled. "What
the devil was the man doing here? I'm going to have a wander up
the Inlet before we leave&mdash;Coming?"</p>

<p>Lister shook his head. Without arguing the point, Weston
started along the patch of sands, walking a zigzag line from the
water's edge to the bank. Lister sat down on the sands and looked
after him.</p>

<p>There was much that required explanation. Why had the old man
been stricken down at the point of the bluff? Who had been his
enemy? What were the reasons for the crime? Had there been a
crime at all? The body bore no signs of violence. Lister began to
think they were trying to reconstruct a crime out of very
indefinite material. The only reason for suggesting the man had
been murdered came from the letter to the office, suggesting a
murdered man would be found on the sands at Yaney's Inlet. The
letter was supported in some measure by the attitude of Dr.
Macdermott. He had said the man had been in full health a few
days before.</p>

<p>The autopsy might declare the man to have suffered from some
obscure disease&mdash;and, consequently, the death to have
occurred through natural causes. In that case all their theories
would fall to the ground. There would be no second party in the
tragedy. The old man would have been found to have walked from
his camp to the bluff, and have been taken ill there. He might
have been overcome by sickness while in his camp, and come down
to the dirt-road seeking aid.</p>

<p>They were working on theories&mdash;theories for and against
the major theory of murder. Before they could get on the track of
facts they must discover who Gideah Brading was, and the cause of
his death. The name was familiar. Lister struggled hard to
remember what he had heard, or read, but memory eluded him.</p>

<p>Lister's eyes wandered round the bluff. Against the face of
the low cliff stood a long stick. He remembered seeing it there
when he came down on the sands to where the little group of
officials stood. He could not remember anyone handling it.
Perhaps it had stood there before the police came on the scene?
Or, perhaps, one of the officers had brought it with him?</p>

<p>The expert rose from the sands and walked to where the stick
stood. It had been cut from a young sapling. The thinner end had
had the bark peeled off, and was stained with water, little
specks of sand adhering to it. The stick was peculiar. It had not
been used for a walking stick, otherwise the thicker end would
have been peeled for a grip. The stick appeared as if it had been
used for a probe.</p>

<p>"&mdash;has been placed where you know." The words of the
letter came vividly before Lister's memoir. The old man was to
receive money at a place he knew of. The tone of the letter, the
lack of address and signature, showed that the writer did not
want to meet the old man. The money had been hidden and the stick
used to probe for it.</p>

<p>Lister picked up the stick and looked around him. The old man
had fallen about six feet from where the stick stood against the
bluff. He would work from there, out to where the old man had
fallen.</p>

<p>Weston was down at the other end of the sand-patch, examining
something at the edge of the water. Lister drove the stick into
the sands, forcing it down as far as he could. It met no
resistance. Again he tried, some twelve inches further out.
Slowly he worked to where the body of the old man had rested, and
then turned, making for the bluff again.</p>

<p>On the third journey, about two feet from the place where the
body had rested, the stick struck something hard. Lister dropped
to his hands and knees and commenced to scoop out the sands. Soon
he came to something hard and smooth, and commenced to clear it
along its length. He was making quite a large hole, not deep, but
long and narrow, before he came to the end of the hidden thing.
It was a board, and he tried to get his fingers under it. He
could not, for it was very thick.</p>

<p>"What's the game, Syd?"</p>

<p>Lister looked up. Weston was standing over him, grinning
broadly at the large hole the expert had dug.</p>

<p>"There's something here, Tony." The expert did not relax his
efforts. "I believe it to be a box."</p>

<p>A moment and Weston was down on his knees, clawing vigorously
at the loose sand. For some minutes they worked in silence.</p>

<p>"Whoop!" Weston tugged hard at something deep in the hole.
"I've got a handle."</p>

<p>A few more tugs, and the two men brought to the surface a
long, narrow box, about two feet wide and four feet long. In
depth it was approximately eighteen inches. Lister sat back and
looked at it in amazement.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">A LONG, narrow wooden box, about two feet wide
and four feet long, lay on the sands between the two men. So far
as Lister could judge, it was a replica of the wooden box hidden
in the sands at Myella Cove by the crew of the Phantom
Launch.</p>

<p>If this conjecture was right, then there must be some definite
connection between the box they had just unearthed and the
Phantom Launch, now prisoner in Middle Harbour. Reasoning on,
Lister had to conclude there was a connection between the Phantom
Launch and the dead swaggie, Gideah Brading.</p>

<p>Lister sat back on the sands and tried to reconstruct the
events of the past two days, as he knew them. First, the Phantom
Launch had visited Myella Cove, and members of the crew had
worked in some way on the box buried in the sands there.
Constable Phelps had unearthed the box, and reburied it,
intending to return and carry it to the police station. The
Phantom Launch, on leaving Myella Cove, had proceeded up the
harbour; but, almost immediately, had retraced its wake and gone
out to sea. The next morning it had taken a passenger from the
overseas mail boat, and had disappeared for about sixteen hours.
That meant the Phantom Launch had some haven round the coast. Was
that refuge at Yaney's Inlet? Had the speed boat landed its
passenger at that lonely spot?</p>

<p>If the Phantom Launch had visited Yaney's Inlet, had that
visit anything to do with the dead swaggie, Gideah Brading? Had
the swaggie been dead when the Phantom Launch came to the inlet,
or had the crew of the mystery boat some part in the death of the
man?</p>

<p>The Phantom Launch had returned to Sydney waters about sixteen
hours after it left the Harbour, and about fifteen hours previous
to the discovery of the box at Yaney's Inlet. That made a total
of thirty-one hours. Dr. Macdermott had stated the man had been
dead about twenty-four hours. The Phantom Launch had been outside
the Heads at the time the murder took place.</p>

<p>The journalist had been fumbling at the lock of the box while
Lister had been trying to reconstruct the facts of the murder as
he knew them. At length, he found one of his keys that turned the
wards of the lock, and he threw back the lid.</p>

<p>"Jove!" The exclamation drew the expert's attention. He turned
and looked into the box. It was empty, save that, fastened to the
bottom of the box by drawing pins, were some bank-notes.</p>

<p>WESTON reached into the box for the notes. Suddenly Lister
caught him by the shoulder and drew him back. The journalist lost
his balance, and rolled over on the sands. He looked up at his
chum with some surprise.</p>

<p>"What's the game, Syd?"</p>

<p>Lister did not reply. He drew from his pocket a pair of rubber
gloves and donned them, meanwhile carefully scanning the interior
of the box. It looked bare and safe, but he could not forget the
queer burn on the palm of the dead man's hand.</p>

<p>With the protection of the rubber gloves, Lister reached into
the box and loosened the drawing pins with his penknife. Once
they lay loose on the floor of the box, he lifted them
carelessly. There were five notes of a hundred pounds each. He
tossed them out on the sands.</p>

<p>"Keep your hands from that box, old man." he warned the
newspaper man. "There's something in this matter I can't
understand, and until we do I suggest that we take every
precaution. Remember the burn on the dead man's hand. This box
may have had something to do with that, although it looks pretty
innocent."</p>

<p>"The box is empty," protested the journalist. He was peering
into it, taking particular care not to touch it with his hands or
clothes.</p>

<p>"Remember the letter." Lister was examining the banknotes.
"'The money has been placed where you know.' Looks as if this box
was the place where Brading was to find the final payment."</p>

<p>"The notes, and the burn on the hand!" Weston whistled softly.
"Jove, old man, we're going some. But what of the notes we found
in the pocket-book?"</p>

<p>"Part of the last payment," answered Lister. "That would fit
in with the theory that Brading and the Phantom Launch have some
connection."</p>

<p>The newspaper man looked puzzled, and Lister briefly
reconstructed the adventures of the Phantom Launch over the past
thirty-odd hours, as he believed them to have happened.</p>

<p>"Then we're to take this box to Como?" asked Weston.</p>

<p>"Well bury it again," declared the expert. "I want to get at
the meaning of these boxes, and I shan't do that with them in the
hands of the police. These boxes have to do with the Phantom
Launch, I'm certain of that. Now, the police know of the box at
Myella Cove, but only you and I know of this box. The police may
want to dig up the box at the Cove, and we've got to stop that,
if possible. Fact is, old man, there's a lot in this matter we're
only guessing at present. We've got to keep the Phantom Launch
crew thinking their boxes are unknown to the authorities. We can
watch them and get the police to watch the places where they are
hidden, whether we tell of this box or not. Somehow, the Phantom
Launch is mixed up in the murder of Gideah Brading. I didn't
think much of the Phantom Launch affair until to-day. Evading the
Customs is one thing, but murder's quite another."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'm taking an interest in the murder of Gideah Brading and
the adventures of the Phantom Launch. I'm going to find out what
I can about both matters."</p>

<p>"A personal interest?" Weston looked up, surprised.</p>

<p>"If you like to call it that, yes. Don't you see, Tony? The
Phantom Launch is owned and run by men who have called to their
aid the latest appliances of science. If we tell the police what
we have discovered they will first fool round with the clues we
give them. They will take months to realise that their methods
cannot apply here. Then, with the crew fully aware that we're on
their track, we may be allowed to try our hands. It's not good
enough."</p>

<p>"No." Weston hesitated a moment. "I believe you're right, Syd.
There's something out of the way here. It's your work. It's
something electrical, and in that line you've got quite a big
enough reputation and knowledge to handle it." He rose to his
feet, and held out his hand. "I'm with you, old man. What's the
next move?"</p>

<p>"Bury the box."</p>

<p>Weston immediately started to scoop out the sand that had
trickled into the hole. Then they lifted the box back to its
former position. Weston managed to lock it, and they shovelled
the sand back, and made some attempt to destroy all evidences of
their presence and discoveries. The newspaper man picked up the
swag, and led the way to the motor car.</p>

<p>"Give the police a hint to watch the bluff, but to keep hidden
in the bush," advised Lister as Weston stopped the car before the
door of the Como police station.</p>

<p>The journalist nodded. He was absent for about ten minutes,
and then returned to the car. A constable came with him to the
gate, talking quickly. Weston swung the car round, and drove to
the post-office.</p>

<p>"Want a word with our bird at Sutherland," he explained. "He's
got quite a lot to get off his chest."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Weston returned to the car. He
looked very worried.</p>

<p>"Matthews has disappeared," he announced, without preliminary.
"He received our telegram this morning, and went out. Said he was
going to the police station, but would return soon. Had his car
ready to come here. His wife says she thought he was with me; had
met me in the town, and had driven off in my car. His car's still
standing in the street, in front of his home."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Lister.</p>

<p>"Damned if I know." Weston sat silent at the wheel of the car
for some time; then he started the engine, and turned back in the
direction of the police station. "We'd better see Constable
Williams, here. He can get me information from Sutherland they
might refuse to me direct."</p>

<p>At the police station Lister entered the building with the
journalist. Williams, a slight, capable-looking young fellow,
heard Weston's story, and immediately telephoned Sutherland
police station. For a few minutes he talked with the officer at
the other end of the line. When he turned to face Weston he
placed his hand over the mouthpiece of the instrument.</p>

<p>"They say Mr. Matthews came to the police station early this
morning, and handed your telegram to the officer on duty. He
waited until Inspector Mack came in, and they had a long
conversation. Matthews offered to drive the police to the Inlet
in his car, but Mack thought best to take the police car.
Matthews left the station to get his own car, promising to meet
Mack at the Inlet. He never turned up."</p>

<p>"Never turned up?" Weston looked at the officer, amazedly.</p>

<p>"Inspector Mack's at the telephone," said Williams. "Would you
like to speak to him, Mr. Weston?"</p>

<p>The journalist took the receiver, and called the Inspector.
Mack confirmed the statements he had made to the constable.</p>

<p>"Worried about Matthews?" he asked at the conclusion.</p>

<p>"A bit." Weston's voice showed that he was worrying greatly
over the man's disappearance. "Say, Mack. Put out a bit of a
search for him. He should have been at the Inlet to meet me.
Shall I come to Sutherland? No need? I want to get back to my
office as soon as possible, so I'll leave it to you. Give me a
ring there if you hear anything."</p>

<p>The General Post Office clock was chiming the quarter past six
when Weston drew up the car before the <i>Pictorial</i>'s
offices.</p>

<p>"Coming in, Syd?"</p>

<p>"Think not. S'pose you'll be an hour or two getting your story
through? Thought so. No. I'll get some dinner in town, and then
do a show, perhaps."</p>

<p>Lister turned into Hunter Street, and walked down to Pitt
Street. Outside the <i>Evening Moon</i> offices he ran into
Ysobel Weston.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lister!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Miss Weston. Afraid I was not looking where I was
going."</p>

<p>"You were walking fast. I am going to the <i>Pictorial</i>
offices."</p>

<p>"For Tony? I have just left him. We had a busy day down at
George's River."</p>

<p>Lister turned and walked up to the office with the girl.
Although Tony Weston and he had been great chums through his
newspaper days, he had not met Ysobel Weston before the previous
day, and had been greatly attracted to her. At the office Tony
came out to them.</p>

<p>"Dinner, my dear child!" The journalist laughed grimly. "A
formal dinner and I are not on speaking terms to-day. I have some
sandwiches and a billy of tea in my room. You are welcome to a
share if that will serve."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss Weston will let me deputise for you, Tony."
Lister looked, almost pleadingly at the girl. "You can bear me
out that I was on my way to dinner when I met her."</p>

<p>"Good." Weston joined their hands, mockingly. "Just the
ticket. I can recommend Syd as a dinner partner, Ysobel. Not only
is he at home in the haunts of the plutocrats of Australia, but
he has a true knowledge of how to dine. Fact. I recommended him
once for the cookery column of the <i>Pictorial</i>. He knows all
there is to know of 'how to dine.'"</p>

<p>Lister found Ysobel a charming companion. The girl could talk
well, and her experiences in Sydney business had given her a
clear insight of the questions that interest men. At first their
conversation was formal, but presently Lister found himself
describing some of the items of their day's adventure in and
around Como.</p>

<p>"What do you know of the Phantom Launch, Mr. Lister?" Ysobel
asked the question suddenly.</p>

<p>"The Phantom Launch?" Lister looked startled. "Why, Miss
Weston; why should you think I know more of the mystery boat than
has been published in the newspapers?"</p>

<p>"You were on Middle Head the other night with Constable
Phelps. You were with Tony to-day. More, Mr. Lister, you show, in
the reserve with which you discuss the subject, that you have
some hidden knowledge."</p>

<p>"Why not ask Tony?" countered the expert, his face flushing
slightly. "He knows what happened today, and I believe he pumped
Phelps and Miller of all knowledge possessed by the police of
what happened last night."</p>

<p>"Because Tony was not in your wireless room last night, Mr.
Lister." The girl laughed softly at the surprised look on the
man's face.</p>

<p>Lister started. Again Ysobel reminded him of the sweet, low
laugh that had come over the air but a few hours before.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">FOR some minutes Lister sat and looked at the
girl in silence. He was almost certain that Ysobel Weston was the
girl who had called "Silver Swan," and who had uttered the words,
"Thanks, stranger," on the air.</p>

<p>"It was you, then?" Lister leaned forward, staring at the
girl. "You ask me what I know of the Phantom Launch, Miss Weston:
I will ask you what you know of 'Silver Swan?'"</p>

<p>A slight look of amusement came into the girl's clear, dark
eyes. She lowered her lashes quickly, as if to save herself from
some involuntary betrayal of knowledge, but Lister caught the
look, and it increased his perplexity.</p>

<p>"Silver Swan." Ysobel spoke the words softly. "Is that the
true name of the Phantom Launch, Mr. Lister? Now I am certain you
are hiding information from me. Have you told the police that the
Phantom Launch is registered under the name of Silver Swan?"</p>

<p>"Probably the police know that, and more." Lister tried to
laugh the matter off, but Ysobel would not be denied.</p>

<p>"I think a mystery is most fascinating. Tony will tell me the
history of what happened this afternoon, for I am sure there are
many details you have not spoken of." The girl spoke coaxingly.
"Will you not tell me where the Phantom Launch is, and who owns
her?"</p>

<p>"The answer to your first question is easy, Miss Weston. The
Phantom Launch is lying hid in Middle Harbour, and the Water
Police are searching for her. As regards who owns her&mdash;"
Lister hesitated a moment, and then continued. "Perhaps the words
'Silver Swan' may bring back to your memory incidents occurring
during the early hours of this morning."</p>

<p>"I?" The girl simulated surprise. "I do not know who the
owners of the Phantom Launch are."</p>

<p>"Nor the man taken off the mail boat but a few hours before
the Silver Swan was called on the air?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that." Ysobel spoke carefully, drawing on her
gloves. "The name of the man who was taken from the mail boat by
the crew of the Phantom Launch is Francis Delaney Hawson."</p>

<p>"Hawson?"</p>

<p>"That is the name on the shipping list. Mr. Hawson is said to
be one of the big squatters in the west country."</p>

<p>"What has he to do with the Phantom Launch?" Lister asked the
question under his breath. The name was familiar to him, although
he had never met the owner. "Why should he wish to evade the
Customs authorities?"</p>

<p>"I said it was the name registered on the shipping list."
Ysobel rose from her chair and led the way to the door. "I did
not say Mr. Hawson was on board the <i>Arathusa</i>."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Lister took his hat from the waiter and followed
the girl into the street. He tried to question the girl again,
but Ysobel adroitly parried him, forcing the conversation to
general topics.</p>

<p>On the ferry, going to Balmoral, the expert tried to bring the
conversation back to the Phantom Launch, but without success. The
girl appeared to be afraid she had said too much. On the Balmoral
wharf she joined some mutual acquaintances, taking from the
expert the last hope of answers to the many questions hovering on
his lips.</p>

<p>As their small party left the wharf Lister noticed Constable
Phelps standing to one side. The officer made a slight sign and,
after a while, Lister found an opportunity to fall back a few
paces. Phelps immediately caught him up.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for you, Mr. Lister," he said in a low
tone. "There are orders to fetch in that box."</p>

<p>"No chance of delay?" Lister spoke quickly. He was glad he had
asked Weston to conceal knowledge of the box at Yaney's Inlet
from the police.</p>

<p>"Orders from headquarters." The constable smiled wryly. "I
can't argue with them. All I've managed to do is to delay the job
until after dark."</p>

<p>"Any objection to my being of the party?"</p>

<p>"None whatever." There was relief in the officer's tone. "In
fact, I'd like to have you there, Mr. Lister. From what you said
last night I don't feel like handling the thing unless there's
someone about with some knowledge."</p>

<p>"Knowledge?" Lister looked surprised. Had the constable
chanced on any of the clues that centred round his wireless
room?</p>

<p>"Scientific knowledge, I mean." Phelps locked apologetic. "You
know you warned me to be careful of that box."</p>

<p>"What time do you propose to go for the box?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you're ready, Mr. Lister." Phelps lowered his
voice, although they were some distance behind Ysobel's party. "I
spoke to Sergeant Miller about you being there, and he said it
was a good idea. There'll be Fellowes and myself to get the box.
We don't want a big party, in case there's anyone about."</p>

<p>"Good. Half an hour suit you, Phelps? I'll just go home and
change. Where shall I meet you?"</p>

<p>"Go down to the beach before your house, Mr. Lister. Dress
like you were going for some night fishing. Bring your rods and
lines with you. We'll pick you up there."</p>

<p>The constable halted at the corner of an intersection and
turned back towards the wharf. Lister caught up with the party,
hoping they had not noticed his absence. He did not want Ysobel
to connect him with the police inquiries, especially after the
questions she had asked him in the restaurant. He was to be
disappointed; as he came up to the group she turned and flashed
at him a glance of understanding.</p>

<p>Lister had no time to speculate over the events of the crowded
day. He changed into some rough clothes, and sought out his
fishing tackle. In a basket he packed a small collection of
instruments and tools he brought from the wireless room. Phelps
would bring the tools required to dig the box from the sands, but
the expert believed the hidden box to contain some secret danger
that only he could baffle.</p>

<p>A few minutes after he reached the beach he saw the boat
pulling parallel along the shore, with Phelps standing in the
stern. The boat turned and backed to the shore. Listed waded out,
and immediately he stepped into the boat Phelps took one of the
oars, and the two constables pulled vigorously down to Myella
Cove.</p>

<p>"What of the Phantom Launch, Phelps?" asked Lister, as he sat
down in the stern.</p>

<p>"Bottled up in Middle Harbour." Phelps grinned in triumph. "I
had the Water Police launches under the Spit Bridge within an
hour of leaving you, Mr. Lister. They're there until the Phantom
Launch is caught, even if the barnacles grow from their hulls to
the bottom of the harbour."</p>

<p>"Are the Water Police searching Middle Harbour?"</p>

<p>"There are men on the shores, but no boats on the harbour yet.
Expect the W.P. will have a little regatta to-morrow. They're
keen on catching the launch."</p>

<p>They were now almost abreast of the little entrance to Myella
Cove. Reefs ran from the headlands, almost closing the waters of
the cove, and it was necessary for them to proceed cautiously. At
length they reached the channel, and pulled for the shore.</p>

<p>"Now for the box," Phelps almost crowed. "Will you open it
here, or at the station, Mr. Lister?"</p>

<p>"That's for you to say," Lister laughed, slightly. "You're in
command of this expedition. I'm only a passenger."</p>

<p>"Then we'll take it to the station," decided the constable.
"The Sergeant wanted to come, badly, but he recognised that the
fewer we were the better chance of escaping observation. He'll be
on pins and needles until he sees the box."</p>

<p>The keel of the boat grated on the sands. The three men
disembarked and drew her well up and beyond the influence of the
tide. Lister jointed his rods and threw out lines, fixing the
rods to the thwarts of the boat. Phelps watched him for a few
minutes, and then took a rod from beneath one of the thwarts and
fixed it.</p>

<p>"We're on a fishing excursion," he grinned. "Thanks for the
tip, Mr. Lister. With those lines out we have a grand alibi if
we're seen. There's nothing suspicious in a party of fishermen
landing to indulge in a little beach fishing. Just
eccentricity."</p>

<p>Leaving the rods securely fastened, the three men walked to
the foot of the cliffs. Phelps took the lead, and slowly passed
along the face of rock until he came to a certain spot.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said confidently. "The box is about a foot
down, just here. Now, if you'll keep watch Mr. Lister, Fellowes
and I will have her up in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Lister sat down and watched the constables delve into the
sands. For a time they worked fast, and in silence. Then Phelps
stood and gazed into the hole they had made, a puzzled expression
on his good-humoured face.</p>

<p>"The blithering thing's not here," he exclaimed. "It was only
about eighteen inches down when I found it, and a lot of sand
fell in while I was replacing it. Guess it should have been about
a foot under the surface this time&mdash;not more."</p>

<p>He turned and walked to the cliff face, examining some mark
carefully.</p>

<p>"Here it is," he said, at length. "I marked the spot on this
jutting piece of rock. There's no error. The blanky thing's
gone."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">THE wooden box, hidden by the crew of the
Phantom Launch under the sands at Myella Cove, had disappeared.
For more than an hour the two constables dug up the sand in a
large area around the rock Phelps had marked, without result.</p>

<p>The box had been removed, probably the previous night while
the constable had been watching the Phantom Launch from Middle
Head. That could only mean that the crew of the mystery boat had
some confederate on land in the vicinity of Myella Cove, and that
the constable had been observed watching the men from the launch
working at the box.</p>

<p>Reluctantly the three men packed their kit and returned to the
boat. In silence they pulled up the coastline to Balmoral Beach.
As Phelps got out of the boat, he turned to the wireless
expert.</p>

<p>"You'll come up to the station, Mr. Lister? It would be a
favour I'd appreciate. This job is going to take a lot of
explaining to the Sergeant."</p>

<p>Lister nodded. Sergeant Miller would be furious. He would have
to accept the major part of the blame for the night's failure.
More, the Sergeant would undoubtedly remember that the expert had
urged that the box should not be removed from the Cove. In that,
the Sergeant would see an opportunity of venting some of his
anger. Headquarters would not accept that as an explanation, but
it would serve for his personal outburst. Immediately the three
men entered the orderly room Sergeant Miller came out of his
office.</p>

<p>"Got that box. Phelps? Where is it? Gone? What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"The box has been removed from the Cove, Sergeant." Lister
took on himself the bulk of the explanation. "We made a long
hunt, but could not find a sign of it."</p>

<p>"More of the mystery work." Miller's face darkened. "That's
the bottom of your fairy story, me lad."</p>

<p>"Except for the fact that the Phantom Launch is bottled up in
Middle Harbour," interposed Lister, quietly.</p>

<p>"On his say-so." Miller swung sharply round on the expert. "If
I remember right, it was on your advice that the box was allowed
to remain hidden in the sands. I wanted to bring it in at once,
but Phelps talked me out of it. Some idiotic idea of allowing it
to remain as a decoy. A fine decoy, I say."</p>

<p>"Decoys are usually watched," suggested Lister, with a ghost
of a smile.</p>

<p>"Did you expect me to go and sit on the cliffs watching that
blithering box? Seems no one here has any brains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon, Sergeant." Phelps hid a broad smile behind his
hand.</p>

<p>"There's the matter of the <i>Arathusa's</i> passenger,"
observed the expert, gravely. His words punctuated the Sergeant's
spluttering profanity. "You're not going to suggest that Phelps
had a hand in that?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Miller tried to look dignified, but had to laugh. "It's
all right for you, Mr. Lister, but those chaps at headquarters
will want my scalp for this. Orders came this afternoon to get
that box and send it to them."</p>

<p>"Well, they will be disappointed. They should have the Phantom
Launch in their hands any hour, now. The box, so far as I can
see, is of secondary importance. The trouble will be cleared up
by the capture of the boat."</p>

<p>Miller still fumed round the office. At length he came to a
pause at the door of his room and opened it.</p>

<p>"There's nothing more to be done." he grumbled, under his
breath. "Get me through to headquarters, Phelps. I'll make the
best explanation I can, but don't forget, me lad, I promised I'd
hand the Commissioner your scalp if you didn't bring in the
Phantom Launch, and I will. It's yours or mine, and you've got a
better crop of hair than I have."</p>

<p>"Then let Phelps go after the Phantom Launch," interposed
Lister quickly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Give him a night's rest, and then let him hunt along the
shores of Middle Harbour, above the Spit Bridge, for the Phantom
Launch. It may be a long job, but he's more likely to succeed
from the land side, where they won't be looking for an attack,
than from the water."</p>

<p>"Not bad." The Sergeant thought a moment. "If Phelps can track
out the Phantom Launch from the land side, we'll go and bring her
in. It'll score one against the Water Police, and I owe Sergeant
Branston a jolt."</p>

<p>Miller entered his room and closed the door. Lister nodded to
the constables and walked home. He had almost been inclined to
take the Sergeant into his confidence in regard to the dead man
at Yaney's Inlet, and the wooden box hidden under the bluff. Had
he been certain that the Sergeant would keep his own counsel, he
might have done so, but in the man's present temper he might be
inclined to offer the box at the Inlet to headquarters as a
palliative. Lister did not want that box disturbed, but it must
be watched night and day.</p>

<p>The concealment of the five hundred-pound notes in the wooden
box seemed fantastic. It was impossible that a box of that build
and size was only intended for the purpose of passing large sums
of money from one person to another. If such had been the
intention of the crew of the Phantom Launch, then why the hiding
of a similar box at Myella Cove? Was the box at the Cove empty at
the time Constable Phelps visited it? Why were both boxes locked?
Why lock empty boxes?</p>

<p>Questions crowded one another in the expert's brain as he
walked slowly home. There seemed to be but one answer to them
all. That answer lay with the Phantom Launch, now bottled up in
Middle Harbour, and likely at any moment to fall into the hands
of the Water police. Then, a full explanation of the wooden boxes
might be forthcoming, but until the launch was captured it was
better for the boxes to remain concealed.</p>

<p>Ah Sam was busy in the kitchen when Lister entered the house.
With a brief word to the man, telling him he had already dined,
Lister passed into the yard and to the wireless shed. Switching
on the light, he turned to his instruments and tested the air.
Some of the commercial stations were at work, and the
broadcasting programmes were in full swing. Slowly he worked up
and down the wave lengths, at times tuning in on some amateur
experimenter. A glance at the chart above his head revealed the
operator. Setting his eight-valve set at 56 metres, he took down
the list of allotted lengths, and compared it with a list he drew
from his pocket.</p>

<p>One of his objects in the city that day had been to obtain a
revised list of the allotted wave lengths. As he lifted his
directory from the wall, he noticed some pencilled words on the
margin.</p>

<p>In his work the wireless expert had become very methodical.
Scribbling pads hung at various points about the room, and on one
desk stood a file for the notes. He had long since abandoned the
careless method of scribbling notes anywhere, and having to hunt
for them long after he had forgotten where he had made them. He
knew these faint pencilled marks had not been made by him.</p>

<p>"Tune in to 80 metres at midnight, and wait."</p>

<p>The message had been written very faintly, in a broad,
flowing, feminine handwriting. There was no signature&mdash;no
indication as to who the writer could be.</p>

<p>Lister's thoughts flew to the girl he had parted from but a
couple of hours before. He was certain that Ysobel had spoken to
him on the air the previous evening. Now he was certain she had
obtained access to his wireless room and had scribbled the
message to him on the wireless directory.</p>

<p>But, how had she obtained entry to the wireless room? Lister
was always particular that he kept the doors of the building
locked. In fact, it was impossible to leave them,
unintentionally, open. They were swung on spring hinges, and
closed automatically, fastening with Yale locks. To keep them
open they had to be hooked back against the wall.</p>

<p>He had the key to the wireless room on his watch-chain. There
was only the one key; the other keys sold with the locks were
deposited in his strong-box at his bank. He was certain there was
no other key, and that he had closed the door securely that
morning when he left the building. Even if he had not done so, Ah
Sam was certain to have noticed the open door, and closed it.</p>

<p>For some time Lister wandered around the room, examining the
various apparatus. Nothing had been stolen, or touched.
Therefore, the only object in entering the room had been to leave
the message on the directory sheet. But why not have written a
note and left it at the house in an ordinary manner?</p>

<p>Putting the problem from him as unsolvable, for the time
being, Lister looked at his watch. It was just half-past ten
o'clock. There was yet an hour and a half before he would be
called. He turned to the eight-valve set and went over it
carefully, changing one of the valves that did not seem to be
working properly. Then he went to the big transmitter and tested
it. Finally he tested the batteries, and fully charged them.</p>

<p>Back at the house Lister found his Chinese servant had retired
for the night. In the living-room the spirit cabinet and tray
stood ready to his hand. He mixed himself a drink, and sat down
with a book. He found it impossible to devote his attention to
reading. He was nervous with expectancy at what he might hear
over the air within the next couple of hours.</p>

<p>A telephone stood on the desk in the corner of the room.
Lister thought it possible that Tony Weston might still be at the
"Pictorial" offices. He obtained the connection. Yes. Tony was
there; in the building, but not in his room. He would ring Mr.
Lister immediately the office could get in touch with him. Ten
minutes later the telephone bell rang. Lister was on his feet
immediately.</p>

<p>"Tony? Yes, Lister here. There's another development in the
P.L. matter. The box at Myella Cove is missing. Yes. You've
arranged for the box at the Inlet to be watched? Good. I'm
expecting that to disappear next. Right. I'll call on you in the
morning. What's that? Gideah Brading known to police? Good. So
long, old man."</p>

<p>Another step had been taken towards the solution of the
mystery. With the history of the dead man known, there was a
chance of finding the murderer. It might be that the murderer
might lead them to the solving of the mysteries surrounding the
Phantom Launch.</p>

<p>Lister went back to his wireless room. At ten minutes to the
hour he switched on the batteries and set the dials. Then he made
another examination of the machinery and sat down to wait.
Exactly on the hour the loud speaker came to life, giving his
personal call sign.</p>

<p>"Sydney Lister here." The expert opened the switch of the
microphone standing before him.</p>

<p>"Good!" A thin, querulous voice came over the air. "There is
someone in this city who can obey orders without question.
Where's the Phantom Launch, Sydney Lister?"</p>

<p>"Bottled up in Middle Harbour."</p>

<p>"The box has disappeared from Myella Cove?"</p>

<p>"You know that? Oh, I suppose you had a hand in removing
it."</p>

<p>"I guessed that it would be removed. Increase your power,
Sydney Lister. I want to hear all that goes on in your wireless
room."</p>

<p>"I am alone here."</p>

<p>"Congratulations." The thin voice became sarcastic. "I did not
expect you to have the Police Department there. You might have to
explain why you have not informed them that the Phantom Launch is
registered the Silver Swan&mdash;and how you obtained your
information."</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to me." The voice became imperative. "I'm not going to
be on the air all night. It's up to you, Sydney Lister, to track
down the crew of the Phantom Launch and the mystery surrounding
them and their boat. So far you only know that it is implicated
in the removal of a passenger from the mail boat. Do you know the
man's name?"</p>

<p>"I have been told a name. I believe my informant was correct,
but I don't know for certain. Do you?"</p>

<p>"It is not for you to ask questions." There was an appreciable
pause. "Sydney Lister, there is only one man who can track down
the gang of crooks controlling the Phantom Launch. That man is
you."</p>

<p>"I am interested in your reasons." Lister was puzzled at the
speaker's attitude. When he had tuned in to the number given, he
had thought he would be speaking to the girl of the previous
night. For a moment he thought he was in connection with the men
who controlled the Phantom Launch. He had now to put from him
this hypothesis. This man was interested in tracing them
down.</p>

<p>"You have two qualifications. First, you have a good newspaper
training, the knowledge of how to get the information you
require, and how to use it. Secondly, you are one of the chief
wireless experts on the continent. Both knowledges are required
for the adventure. If you take it on, you will be fighting
against one of the world's scientific geniuses. What have you to
say?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Lister spoke impulsively, and almost without thought.
Yet, for some reason he did not repent his decision immediately
he had spoken.</p>

<p>"Then come and see me, Austin Chosen, to-morrow, at eleven.
You hear? Austin Chosen. Sergeant Miller will tell you where to
find me. All you have to do, at present, is to keep a still
tongue, or&mdash;What's that?"</p>

<p>Someone was hammering at the door of the wireless room. The
sounds had carried over the air to the speaker. Lister waited a
few minutes, but Austin Chosen did not speak again. A few quick
touches of the dials and the connections were destroyed. Lister
crossed the room and opened the door.</p>

<p>On the step stood Constable Phelps, panting, as if he had been
running hard. He took a step into the room and looked around.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Phelps?" Lister thought the man's attitude
was curious. "I thought you were in bed and asleep. You've got a
rough day before you tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing." Phelps grinned, in spite of his worried air.
"Half an hour ago the Phantom Launch broke through the blockade
at the Spit Bridge and raced down the harbour and through the
Heads like an express train."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">"THE Phantom Launch loose!" Lister repeated the
constable's statement, wonderingly. "I thought the Water Police
had her bottled up tight?"</p>

<p>"So tight that she came down under the Spit Bridge at full
speed, and ran clean over one of the patrol boats. There was a
bit of a mix-up for a few seconds, but before the other boats
could get near she was away and out of sight. You'd have thought
she'd have been chewed to pieces by such a collision, but, from
what one of the men said, she must be sheathed in armour."</p>

<p>"Anyone injured?" the expert asked, quickly.</p>

<p>"A couple of Water Police got some cuts, and most of the crew
of the boat were shaken and ducked." Phelps was following Lister
into the cottage. "Thanks, I feel I can do with one. Dickson was
on duty when they brought the casualties over to Balmoral, and he
sent to Miller at once. The Sergeant came for me on his way down
to the station. Jove! He's just rampant. Sent me up to tell you
the news and ask you to come down to see him."</p>

<p>Lister picked up his hat and accompanied Phelps to the police
station. A big fire had been built in the orderly room, and
before it hung a number of garments. Half a dozen men were
lounging about the room, two of them wearing bandages, watching
the Sergeant stride up and down the room, exploding every now and
again in little rumbling growls of wrath.</p>

<p>"Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Lister." Miller swung round on the
expert as he entered the room. "How far can you communicate with
that wireless stuff of yours?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere there's a station to pick it up." Lister laughed.
"You don't seem to realise Balmoral houses the biggest amateur
wireless station on the continent."</p>

<p>"Don't know a darned thing about it," grumbled the Sergeant.
"There's too much machinery in this world. Look at this Phantom
Launch. Some new-fangled engines that don't make a noise; and
speed&mdash;Lord! if what them chaps say is anywhere near the
truth, she's faster than the wind."</p>

<p>"You want to get on the air." The expert spoke, impatiently.
"Why didn't you come up to the house, then, instead of sending
for me to come here? If that boat's as speedy as you say, she'll
be out of reach in a little while. Come on."</p>

<p>He turned to the door. Miller picked up his cap from the table
and followed hastily. Lister ran on ahead, and when the Sergeant
groped his way through the yard, the engines in the machine-house
were humming busily.</p>

<p>Lister took a chart of coastal stations from a drawer, and sat
down at the big instrument in the middle of the room. One by one
he called them, and asked that a look-out be kept for the Phantom
Launch. Then he spoke to the big Amalgamated Wireless Station at
Epping, asking for the position of all warships on the New South
Wales coast. Crossing to the big eight-valve, he set the dials to
the station's wave-length, and, clipping the ear-phones on the
Sergeant's head, instructed him to take down any messages that
might come through.</p>

<p>His next move was to communicate with all vessels on the coast
carrying wireless apparatus. He fetched from the sitting-room the
day's "Daily Pictorial" and propped it against the instrument.
Then he worked down the list, asking for information of the
speed-boat, and quoting "police" as his authority, giving his
call number and wave length for reply.</p>

<p>So far he had done all that lay in his power; in fact, he
believed he had far exceeded any authority Sergeant Miller could
delegate to him. To safeguard the Sergeant, he switched in the
loud speaker on the "big eight," and sent him into the house to
telephone Headquarters, informing the Commissioner what had been
done, and asking instructions.</p>

<p>Miller had hardly left the wireless room when Lister was
called by the Amalgamated Wireless Station. Two warships were on
the New South Wales coast, between Melbourne and Sydney. A small
patrol boat was coming down from Queensland, and should be about
the northern border of the State within a few hours. Lister went
to his engine-room and made certain his batteries were fully
charged, and that he could obtain all the power he might want.
Then he went back to his instruments and called the
<i>Spitfire</i>, the nearest warship to Sydney Heads. In a few
minutes he was speaking to the wireless operator, transmitting a
request that any speed-boat answering the description he gave of
the Phantom Launch be detained and brought back to Sydney
Harbour.</p>

<p>There was a little demur from the warship at first. While
Lister was arguing that the request be taken at once to the
officer on duty, Sergeant Miller returned from the telephone,
beaming with smiles at the commendation he had received for his
prompt action in getting the news of the escape on the air, and
with full authority to make his requests in the name of the
Commissioner of Police. Lister repeated his request to the
warship, using Sir George Benson's name. A reply came back that
the officer in charge would communicate with him immediately.</p>

<p>He next got in touch with the <i>Panther</i>, coming down from
Queensland. He repeated the request that he had made to the
<i>Spitfire</i>, and received an immediate reply from the chief
officer that a sharp look-out would be kept. Hardly had he
finished with the <i>Panther</i> than the <i>Spitfire</i> came in
again, bombarding him with a volley of questions. With the
Sergeant at his elbow to prompt him. Lister was able to satisfy
the officer speaking that he had full authority for his requests.
The <i>Spitfire</i> then undertook to communicate with the
<i>Hawkesbury</i>, then on the Victorian coast, and get her to
watch for the elusive launch, if she managed to avoid the nearer
warship.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" The sergeant sat back in his chair and
scratched his chin, thoughtfully. "Seems like that I've got to
take back all I've said about modern machinery. Pity you're not
in the Force, Mr. Lister. It this night's work results in the
capture of the Phantom Launch, there'll be a step in rank for all
concerned&mdash;except you."</p>

<p>"Don't count eggs," laughed the expert. "We've spread a big
net, but that is not to say we'll snare our fowl. There's one man
I want to get, if I can. Let me see. Half-past one. Late, but he
may be about."</p>

<p>"Who are you after now?"</p>

<p>Lister took up the list of amateur wireless stations and ran
his finger down the column.</p>

<p>"Here he is. Arthur Haslington, CXY, 120 metres. Now, we'll
try to raise him."</p>

<p>"Sutherland?" Miller was looking over the expert's shoulder.
"What can he do? Sutherland's not on the coast, and you don't
surely think the Phantom Launch travels overland?"</p>

<p>Lister raised a warning hand. An acknowledgment of the call
had come over the air.</p>

<p>"Mr. Haslington. Yes. Sydney Lister, Balmoral, NKH 90 metres,
speaking for the Commissioner of Police. Will you be so good as
to take an urgent message for Inspector Mack, and telephone to
him at once? It is important that he gets it immediately. Thanks.
Sorry to trouble you, but it is a matter of urgent importance,
and too pressing to trust to ordinary methods of
communication.</p>

<p>"Begins. The compliments of the Commissioner of Police for New
South Wales, Sir George Benson. Fast speed boat likely to visit
Yaney's Inlet this night; probably near bluff where dead man
found yesterday. Arrange to capture and detain crew and boat.
Warrant out in Sydney for all on boat. Possibly mixed up in
Yaney's Inlet murder. Men dangerous. Ends.</p>

<p>"Got that? Thanks. Quite correct. Now, will you please take a
short description of the boat and add to the message. Good."</p>

<p>Lister added a few words, describing the Phantom Launch, and
asked that any reply should be made to his station. He cut out
and set the instrument to pick up any signals that might come
through.</p>

<p>"Say, young man," Sergeant Miller cocked a leg over the arm of
his chair. "You've taken a lot of liberty with the Police Force
and the name of the Commissioner this night, haven't you?" Then,
as Lister commenced to answer, he interposed, "Not that anyone'll
mind. Get that Phantom Launch for us through this box of magic,
and you can call the police what you like for the remainder of
your days. What does this little lot cost?"</p>

<p>"Between five and six thousand pounds' worth of instruments
here." Lister grinned at the amazed expression on the Sergeant's
facet. "Are you a buyer?"</p>

<p>"Not unless the Government offers a few hundred thousand for
the apprehension of the Phantom Launch and pay it to me." Miller
made a wry face. "Good for you chaps, who have nothing to
do."</p>

<p>Lister rose from his chair and, crossing to the "eight-valve,"
closed it down. Then he turned to the door.</p>

<p>"Anything more, in the wireless line tonight?" he asked,
yawning. "If not, I propose a drink, and then to bed."</p>

<p>"What if a message comes to you from one of the
inquiries?"</p>

<p>The sergeant got up from his chair and went over the big
transmitter.</p>

<p>The expert threw over a switch and plugged in a connection.
Then he went into the engine-room and shut down power.</p>

<p>"Just a little invention of mine," he said "Any call for me
rings a bell at the head of my bed. It takes me a little over
thirty seconds to get out here and to the instrument."</p>

<p>"Good." Out in the yard the sergeant looked up at the dark
sky. "Looks like wind and rain to me. If it comes on to blow, I
pity those men in that pesky little launch out at sea. Well, it's
their funeral. Mine's a whisky-soda. It's on you, as you proposed
it."</p>

<p>THE LIGHT of early morning was coming in at Lister's window
when the electric bell at the head of his bed came to life. Half
a minute later the expert was in the wireless house, the engines
running, and the headphones in place.</p>

<p>"Haslington speaking. That Mr. Lister? Good. Inspector Mack to
Commissioner of Police. Compliments. Arrived Yaney's Inlet too
late. Found Constable Smith, placed on guard at the bluff, on
sands, dead. Cause of death: Shot. Ends. Say, Lister, are we an
annexe of the Police Department now?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">MILLINGTON CHAMBERS, Pitt Street, is one of the
oldest houses in Sydney, built in the days when the city was
rising along the stock routes converging on Circular Quay. Once
the town residence of a wealthy squatter family, today it is let
out in rooms to small businesses, described as "agencies."</p>

<p>The house is built of rough Sydney sandstone, polished and
stained by generations of rain and winds. It is a gloomy-looking
house, stolid and heavy, with small windows and large frontal
arches. The main entrance is through a small door leading into a
dark passage, at the end of which is a narrow, winding stairway.
Most of the old oaken doors of the building have been removed,
and their places taken by modern panelled doors, the top panels
of frosted glass bearing the names and occupations of
tenants.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs leading to the fourth floor stands a
massive oaken door&mdash;apparently one of the original doors. On
it is screwed a small brass card-holder, bearing an aged engraved
card, with the two words, "Austin Chosen." There is no door
handle, only the circular plate of the Yale lock. On the lintel
of the door-frame, on a line with the keyhole, is the blackened
button of an electric bell.</p>

<p>Austin Chosen is one of the mysteries of Sydney. Coming from
"nowhere," he established himself on the top floor of Millington
Chambers, taking the rooms on a long lease, and resolutely
refusing to allow the official cleaners of the building to pass
the heavy door he erected at the head of the stairs. He was
rarely seen by the other renters of the building. Sometimes,
after nightfall, a slight, small man, about 45 years of age, and
leaning on a heavy stick, walked slowly down the steep stairs,
muffled in a long ulster, the hat pulled well down over his face.
Very slowly, almost as if in pain, he would walk down Pitt Street
to Circular Quay and along the line of wharves to Fort Macquarie.
Following the small section of roadway beside the vehicular
punt-dock to the end, he would stand looking out over the harbour
for half an hour or more. Then he would turn and retrace his
steps to Millington Chambers.</p>

<p>The police authorities knew Austin Chosen, and respected his
wonderful deductive abilities; so, also, did the men who
controlled "big business" in the capital city under the Southern
Cross. Yet, to them he was little more than a name, for very
rarely clients were admitted to a personal interview.</p>

<p>"The Mystery of the Official Papers" first brought Austin
Chosen to the knowledge of the authorities. Very little of that
case became public. Influence was brought to stifle publicity;
yet, it became generally known that, through the peculiar
knowledge of the Mystery Man, an important Under-Secretary's
resignation was withdrawn, coincident with the reorganisation of
the State's Cabinet and the retirement from public life of a
politician who had been tipped for the highest honours.</p>

<p>Gradually Austin Chosen built up a small, influential
clientèle, always reserving time to assist the Police Department
in any problem that caused them anxiety. The series of frauds on
Australian banks, later to be known as the "Renton case," were
taken to him by one of the leading bankers of the Commonwealth,
much in the nature of a forlorn hope. Austin Chosen solved the
problem in three days, placing in the hands of his clients
convincing proof of the guilty parties. It was during the trial
of the guilty men a newspaper traced the hand of Austin Chosen in
the prosecution, and bestowed on him the name of the "Mystery
Man"%mdash;a title by which he soon became generally known.</p>

<p>Sydney Lister obtained the address of the Mystery Man from
Sergeant Miller, and had some difficulty in parrying the
Sergeant's curiosity. Exactly at eleven o'clock he mounted the
stairs at Millington Chambers and pressed the electric button.
The door opened immediately, revealing in the gloomy aperture the
figure of a Chinese, dressed in the flowing garments of his race.
On seeing Lister the man immediately stood to one side, motioning
him to enter. At the same time he touched an electric switch and
flooded the small hall with light.</p>

<p>The hall was richly furnished in a semi-Asiatic style. The
carpets were rich and deep. A few lounges stood around the room.
There was no table, but scattered about were several Oriental
stools. The walls were hung with long tapestries, concealing the
doors.</p>

<p>Lister had just time to gather an impression of his
surroundings when a deep-tone gong struck a solitary note. The
Chinese walked to the hangings on the far side of the room and
drew them to one side, motioning Lister to pass through. He found
himself in a room fitted up as a business office, the most
prominent feature being the large number of filing cabinets
lining the walls. From behind a large desk a tall, dark-haired
girl came forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lister hardly expected to meet me here?" Ysobel Weston
smiled slightly as she held out her hand to the expert. "I am Mr.
Austin Chosen's secretary."</p>

<p>"That is how you knew the name of the man who left the mail
boat by the Phantom Launch," exclaimed Lister, involuntarily. "I
wondered if Tony informed you."</p>

<p>"Tony does not know the name of the man yet, unless his
newspaper has obtained it from the shipping office. Our works are
separate. In fact, we have an understanding not to discuss
business without Mr. Austin Chosen's permission."</p>

<p>"I am to see Mr. Chosen?"</p>

<p>"I believe so." Ysobel hesitated, and then continued: "Mr.
Chosen would like you to dictate to me the information you have
regarding the Phantom Launch."</p>

<p>Lister hesitated. From what Sergeant Miller had told him of
the Mystery Man he believed he was to be trusted, but to dictate
his information was a different matter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Austin Chosen has the various police reports," suggested
the girl, quietly.</p>

<p>"Then he possesses nearly all the information in my
possession, perhaps more." Lister answered quickly, relieved at
not having to utter the refusal to Ysobel's request almost on his
lips.</p>

<p>"There are matters relating to what took place in your
wireless room during the past two nights." The girl made the
suggestion quietly.</p>

<p>"You know of them?" Lister was wondering if Ysobel had
obtained access to his workshops, and had written the message
from Austin Chosen on the wireless directory.</p>

<p>"You mentioned the Silver Swan in my hearing, Mr. Lister."
Ysobel laughed lightly at the man's obvious embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Thanks, stranger." The words of the voice on the air came
involuntarily to the man's lips.</p>

<p>A wave of colour flooded the girl's face, and she stared at
Lister, amazedly. For some seconds there was silence in the
office, broken by a thin, reedy voice.</p>

<p>"I will see Mr. Lister, Miss Weston."</p>

<p>Lister swung round in his chair. The voice was the same as had
come over the air the previous night, and had purported to be
from Austin Chosen. He and the girl were alone.</p>

<p>"Mr. Austin Chosen is a great invalid." Ysobel rose from her
seat and opened a door. "Will you please be as brief as
possible?"</p>

<p>Lister advanced into a large darkened room. For some minutes
he stood just within the door, striving to accustom his vision
after passing from the bright lights of the girl's office. At
length, he was able to make out a few objects. The centre of the
room was clear of furniture. A wide couch stood a couple of feet
from the wall on the opposite side of the room, close by what
appeared to be a large instrument board.</p>

<p>"Come and sit down beside me, Mr. Lister." Austin Chosen spoke
slowly, and carefully. "As Miss Weston informed you, I am a great
sufferer, and have to live mostly in the dark."</p>

<p>The expert walked across to the chair set by the couch, and
looked down on the Mystery Man. He saw a slight, small man with a
thin, wan face, in which the big blue eyes looked out from under
massive eyebrows, quite at variance with the contour of the face.
He was clean shaven, the lips almost straight and bloodless. The
cheeks were hollow, and in the gloom appeared almost grey. As
Lister seated himself a small glow lamp came to life, lighting up
his features. He started, and the light was immediately
extinguished.</p>

<p>"You will forgive me." Austin Chosen laughed weakly. "I like
to see the faces of my visitors. So you are the man they write of
as the big wireless expert of Australia. I am interested in the
work."</p>

<p>"You have a very fine instrument, Mr. Chosen."</p>

<p>"It is good, but it broadcasts. More, I cannot see to whom I
am talking. For my work, both defects are dangerous. Can you show
me how to make the speech directional, and to see the people I am
talking to?"</p>

<p>"Not at present. The secrets are known, but remain, for the
time, in the hands of their inventors. Possibly, in a few
years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I live so long." Austin Chosen rolled impatiently on his
couch. "Well, I have to use what knowledge is available. So the
Phantom Launch is free again."</p>

<p>"You know that?"</p>

<p>"I listened to you last night. Good work. Mr. Lister, but you
failed in one thing."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"The Phantom Launch did not go out to sea. It went up the
Harbour."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" Lister looked at the man on the couch,
perplexedly.</p>

<p>"What matters how I know? I use many instruments to serve my
ends. Mr. Lister, will you act with me to run down these men who
own the Phantom Launch?"</p>

<p>"What is your interest in the matter?"</p>

<p>"The interest you should have, and which I believe you
possess. The interest of bringing to justice one of the biggest
scoundrels infesting this continent: the imprisonment of men,
who, if allowed to remain at large will one day strike such a
blow at our civilisation that it will take many years to recover
from."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">LISTER stared at the Mystery Man in amazement.
For a moment he thought the man was speaking wildly. Something of
this must have shown in his face, for Austin Chosen began to
laugh; a queer little chuckling laugh that left him pale and
exhausted.</p>

<p>"You think I am mad, Lister? Well, time will tell. These men
who own the Phantom Launch are dangerous. They are clever; they
have big aims and ambitions, and the money to carry out their
ideals."</p>

<p>"You mean, they are Communists?" hazarded Lister.</p>

<p>"If you class all who oppose law and order as Communists I
will not contradict you. I call them criminals, for they seek
only the satisfaction of their grosser desires. They have money,
and want more. They seek safety, and use all means to that end.
They have power&mdash;the power of money and what it will
purchase. What have they to gain by political change?"</p>

<p>"You suggest their aims are not political?"</p>

<p>"Politics! Politics! Politics are the curse of this country.
No man dare move but his aim is said to be political power. No
man dare venture an opinion, but he is branded with the iron of
some party. Men and women must not think for themselves. They
must be of the herd, and allow their self-elected leaders to
think for them. Why, even a road-sweeper has to adopt the right
label before he can get a job at the basic wage. The people
think, eat, drink, and sleep politics. They will know better some
day."</p>

<p>Lister sat silent for some time. Austin Chosen was a maze of
contradictions. Had it not been for the wonderful reputation he
had won in the State the expert might have thought him a
crank.</p>

<p>"Enough of this." Austin Chosen rolled over on his couch. "We
are wasting time. Have you seen Captain Anstey?"</p>

<p>"The captain of the mail boat? No."</p>

<p>"Not much good. Captain Anstey can tell you little. He is what
novelists describe as 'a bluff sea-dog.' That means he has
sufficient brains to solve the few familiar mathematical problems
necessary to steer a ship from Europe to Australia. Listen."</p>

<p>For some minutes the man rolled in pain on the couch, low
groans coming between the bloodless lips. Lister rose to his feet
to seek assistance, but the Mystery Man's thin hand beckoned him
back.</p>

<p>"Captain Anstey will tell you that the name of the man who
left the mail boat for the Phantom Launch is Francis Delaney
Hawson. A reference to the <i>Australian Who's Who</i> will tell
you Hawson is a big and successful squatter owning wide-spread
stations in the Bourke district. There's your first work. Find
out if Hawson has been absent from his head
station&mdash;Myollongowera&mdash;for any length of time during
the past six months, and where he has been."</p>

<p>"You infer Hawson was not the passenger on the
<i>Arathusa</i>?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be proved." The thin voice snapped out the
answer. "If Hawson was not on the mail boat, then someone
impersonated him. Is that plain to you?"</p>

<p>"Have you any reason to believe Mr Hawson was impersonated on
the mail boat?"</p>

<p>"I never believe anything but stark facts, Lister. I want to
see Hawson. He's big, and he's wealthy. So are the men we are
after. He may be one of them. I don't know, and I don't guess.
Now, tell me of the dead man at Yaney's Inlet."</p>

<p>Point by point, Lister went over the adventures of the
previous day with Weston.</p>

<p>"You left the box buried in the sands. Good. You've more
sense, Lister, than most of the people I have to do with."</p>

<p>"From what I heard last night I was indirectly the cause of
the death of the constable on guard at the Inlet," retorted
Lister. "If I had allowed Weston to take the box into Como there
would have been no necessity for a guard at the Inlet.</p>

<p>"The man was a fool. He disobeyed orders, and came out of the
scrub onto the sands. Now, as to the dead swaggie, Gideah
Brading, what do you know of him? Nothing. Find out. Somewhere in
the history of Gideah Brading you will find a clue that will lead
you to the Phantom Launch and the crew. Got that?"</p>

<p>Lister rose from his chair and walked up and down the room. He
was feeling depressed. This slight invalid on the couch was
dominating him. Why should he turn detective? He had his
work&mdash;work that interested him, and he was being forced into
the pursuit of criminals&mdash;work that belonged to the police.</p>

<p>"What's troubling you, Lister?" The Mystery Man's voice had
grown low and soft. "Wondering if it's your job? You'll soon
know. These men know you have been interested in the pursuit of
the Phantom Launch, and they won't stand interference. Go
forward, track them down, and send them to where they shall
expiate their acts&mdash;and you will have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>"What do you know, Austin Chosen?" Lister swung round to the
man. "You imply you have knowledge. Speak out then, and let me
know what I have to face."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Lister resumed his pacing up and
down the room, the man on the couch watching him with a smile of
understanding on his lips.</p>

<p>"You can't get away from it, Lister." The Mystery man broke
the silence in a low voice. "The game enthrals you. Look at me;
tied to this couch for hours each day; exhausted by a walk of a
bare mile or so; racked with the pains of hell; and yet my
thoughts turn incessantly to the little work I can do&mdash;the
making of this evil world just one little bit better and happier
for the whole human race, by tracking down to their just
punishment the few men who live crooked lives. Take up the task,
man. What is asked of you is but a small return for all the world
has given to you. It's small; it may seem petty&mdash;a job
anyone might accomplish&mdash;but I tell you before long you will
see that you have the special knowledge that alone permits
success. It's the small things that count. Criminals do not leave
broad, straight roads of detection. It is only by following
close, picking up the few mistakes they make, that gains success
for justice."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," Lister turned, impulsively, towards the couch.
"From what you say, the clue to the mystery lies in the history
of Gideah Brading?"</p>

<p>"See me tomorrow." Austin Chosen held out his thin white hand.
"Good luck to&mdash;"</p>

<p>A faint stroke of the bell caused the Mystery Man to stop
suddenly. He held up a warning hand and touched a switch. Then he
beckoned Lister to seat himself, motioning him to silence. Taking
the pad that lay beside his hands he scratched a few
lines.</p><br>

<p class="letter">Don't speak or make any noise.<br> This room
and Miss Weston's office are now connected.</p>

<p><br> For a few minutes they sat silent in the gloom of the
room. Then, on the air, came the sound of soft shod feet. Again a
moment's silence, and the voice of Ysobel Weston.</p>

<p>"Mr Francis Hawson? Yes, Lou. I will see him."</p>

<p>The finger of the man on the couch closed the connection. He
half rose.</p>

<p>"That man here? Lister, for your life, listen and be silent.
We are at the heart of the mystery."</p>

<p>The switch fell into place again, and over the wire came the
sound of Ysobel's voice.</p>

<p>"&mdash;afraid Mr Chosen cannot be seen without an
appointment."</p>

<p>"The matter is of importance," a deep voice answered the girl.
"I am willing to wait, if Mr Chosen will see me later."</p>

<p>"If you will state your business, I will ask Mr Chosen for an
appointment. Mr Chosen is a sick man and has to refuse many
persons who desire to see him."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that is impossible." Hawson hesitated over the
words. "I&mdash;I can only assure you that it is a matter of
importance to me."</p>

<p>"I am Mr Chosen's secretary, and I am in his confidence. May I
suggest the matter refers to the steamship <i>Arathusa</i>?"</p>

<p>"What do you know?" The man spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Only what the newspapers state." Ysobel's voice was quite
calm. "A Mr. Francis Delaney Hawson is reported to have been
taken from the mail boat <i>Arathusa</i> some three miles outside
the heads by a strange launch. The police are searching for Mr
Hawson."</p>

<p>"That's so. The police are searching for me. They've been
inquiring at the hotels."</p>

<p>"What do you want Mr Chosen to do?"</p>

<p>"Get me out of the trouble."</p>

<p>"Why not get a fast car and drive out to your station, Mr
Hawson?" Ysobel spoke carelessly, but with a hidden meaning in
her words. "There are people there who would say you had not left
the station for months."</p>

<p>"The police have already made inquiries at the
homestead&mdash;at Myollongowera." The man's voice sounded
fretful. "If I go there now, they will find me."</p>

<p>"Why should Francis Hawson fear the police?" Lister turned in
his chair. The Mystery Man had spoken. "Miss Weston, I will see
Mr Francis Delaney Hawson in two minutes."</p>

<p>Austin Chosen threw out the switch, and turned sharply to the
expert.</p>

<p>"Lister. On the table by the window is a small camera. Get me
a photo of this man. Get a photo somehow, however small and bad.
Pretend you are snapping the building as he comes out of the
door. But get that photo. Lou Sing will show you how to get out
of the house."</p>

<p>Lister jumped towards the window and found the camera. A door
opened at the other side of the room, and the Chinese servant
entered. The Mystery Man made an imperative motion, and Lister
went towards the door. He had hardly reached it when the door
opened. The servant caught him by the arm and dragged him into
the outer darkness. For a full minute they stood waiting, then
from within the room came the sound of Austin Chosen's voice,
vibrant and exultant:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What want you of Austin Chosen?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE door of the room closed behind Lister and
the Chinese, leaving them in darkness. For a moment the expert
stood listening for what might happen in the room he had just
left, but except for the one vibrant cry, on the entrance of
Hawson, the voices were lowered.</p>

<p>A hand grasped Lister's arm, and he was led across a room out
into the hall. There the servant released him and walked to the
office door. Ysobel was standing by her desk, evidently awaiting
him. As he entered she place her finger to her lips, and beckoned
him to come to the desk. A seat had been placed for him there and
the top of the desk cleared of all papers. Let into the centre of
the woodwork was a large square of frosted glass about ten inches
by twelve.</p>

<p>Ysobel went to the window and touched a spring. A long frame
of black substance rose from the sill, excluding all light. For a
moment the room was lit by a shaded bulb pendant from the
ceiling. The girl motioned Lister to watch the frosted glass.
Then the light was extinguished.</p>

<p>On the frosted surface appeared a picture of the room Lister
had just left. It was no longer in gloom, but brightly lit. On
the couch, under the large switchboard, lay Austin Chosen, his
face turned towards the man seated beside him. The man's back was
turned towards the aperture of the instrument. Lister waited for
him to turn, but he sat, almost motionless, intent on the words
the Mystery Man was speaking.</p>

<p>For some time the man and the girl sat looking into the glass.
At length Lister, fearing that he would not get sight of the
visitor's face, placed his finger on the figure of Hawson and
made a motion as if to turn him around. In the glow from the
frame he could see the girl nod. She touched some button at the
edge of the mirror and slowly the picture revolved, until
Hawson's face was clearly revealed. The man looked worried and
pale. The ruddy flush, born of days in the western bush, had
faded to a sickly pink. The coarse skin was almost yellow, and
the eyes dilated. Even the portly figure seemed shrunken, the
broad shoulders sagging dejectedly. Lister fixed the details of
the man's appearance in his mind and waited. He had solved the
immediate problem and would recognise the squatter when he met
him on the street.</p>

<p>Austin Chosen was lying back on his couch, his fingers
restlessly fumbling with the controls of the switchboard.
Suddenly the fingers tensed.</p>

<p>"That's all I have to say to you, Francis Delaney." The voice
of the Mystery Man came clear over the air. "Go now. I must
rest."</p>

<p>It was the only sentence of the conversation audible in
Ysobel's room, and had been sent as a warning. As the words faded
away the girl touched a knob on the wall, and the vision
disappeared from the glass.</p>

<p>"Go quickly." The girl switched on the lights. "I will manage
to keep him for a couple of minutes in here."</p>

<p>Lister picked up his hat and the camera, and went to the door.
As he reached it the Asian appeared. He walked before the expert
to the outer door, and closed it noiselessly behind him. Lister
ran down the stairs, and out into the street. There he set the
camera, and waited about ten or twelve feet from the main door of
Millington Chambers. A loitering taxi-cab came to the pavement
behind him, and the driver got down from his seat and opened the
door.</p>

<p>"All set," murmured the man. "The Chink told me what to do,
and where to go. Jump in directly you've got the photograph, and
we'll be off."</p>

<p>Lister nodded. Austin Chosen had reduced detail to a science.
Hawson would certainly know he had been photographed. There would
be no chance of a dispute on the street; no opportunity to create
a scene demanding reasons for the act. Coupled with the scene in
the Mystery Man's room, the squatter would be troubled and
perplexed.</p>

<p>A couple of men strolling along the street halted a few yards
away from Lister. One of them moved close to the door of the
chambers, the other remained a few feet from the expert. As
Hawson appeared in the doorway, the man by the door spoke to him,
stopping him for a few moments. Lister pressed the trigger of the
camera; at the same moment a magnesium flare came from beside
him. Someone caught him and swung him into the cab. Immediately
the driver started the machine and swung into the traffic, racing
up towards Central Station. Lister looked out of the window. Both
men had disappeared, and the squatter stood on the pavement
before the chambers, waving his stick threateningly after the
car.</p>

<p>The car swung into Bathurst Street and up Elizabeth Street. At
the St. James' corner it turned up to Queen's Square and then
into Macquarie Street. At Hunter Street it turned again and drew
up at the entrance to the offices. The man dropped from his seat
and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Quick, sir. There's nothing to pay, and I've got to get out
of this."</p>

<p>Almost before Lister reached the swing doors of the offices
the taxi was in motion again, speeding towards King Street.
Lister hesitated a moment. Why had he been brought here? He had
said nothing to the Mystery Man of his intention of calling on Tony Weston.</p>

<p>At the inquiry desk, on the editorial floor, Lister was
informed that Tony was waiting for him in his room. Declining the
guidance of the copy-boy, the expert walked down the long
corridor, flanked by small rooms. Tony was seated at his desk,
leaning back and watching the door. As Lister entered, he sprang
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Just had a 'phone from Ysobel. Told me to wait in for you,
and keep your visit secret. It's all arranged. The girl at the
desk will deny that you're on the premises, if anyone follows
you. Sit down, old man. Got your phone message last night. Just
in time for the 'city' edition. Made a grand scoop for me. Miller
deserves a step for getting you on the job. You should have
succeeded in catching the Phantom Launch."</p>

<p>"Austin Chosen thinks the launch went up the river." Lister
thought there would be no harm in mentioning the Mystery Man's
name, now that Tony knew that he had been to see him.</p>

<p>"Possibly." Weston bit the end of his pencil. "The death of
Constable Smith at Yaney's Inlet makes me doubt that. In that
ship they had plenty of time to get round to George's River and,
if the constable saw them and revealed himself, they were nervy
enough to shoot. No; I'm inclined to think the Phantom Launch is
mixed up in both murders."</p>

<p>Lister was about to answer when Weston turned sharply to the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, Syd. I was to report your arrival. What's that
you've got? A camera. Oh, I understand."</p>

<p>The journalist gave a number in a low voice. In a few seconds
he obtained connection.</p>

<p>"Lister here. Also camera. Do you want it developed?
Right."</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments. "All right. I
understand."</p>

<p>He closed the instrument and leaned back in his chair</p>

<p>"The game's getting thick." Weston spoke musingly. "Dare say
you're wondering what you got in at, Syd? Well, there's nothing
to worry you if Austin Chosen sits in on the game. He's straight,
and to be trusted. Now, we've got to get busy. Hand over that
camera. Ysobel tells me to have the negative developed by our
men, and to take the camera and print home with me. Want a copy?
Right."</p>

<p>He scribbled a note on a sheet of copy-paper and tucked it in
the handle of the camera. Then he called one of the boys and
handed the machine to him, with instructions to take it to the
photographic room.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" Lister was perplexed. "I'm getting
mixed over things."</p>

<p>"They are progressing fast." Weston looked up with a grin on
his face. "All I can tell you is that you're sitting in on one of
the biggest games ever played in Australia, and that the centre
of that game is the top floor of Millington Chambers. How much
you know, and how much I know, won't affect the issue. All we
have to do is to follow the man with the brain. That's Austin
Chosen. Now let's go over what happened since we parted, and try
to make a clean-cut tale of it. You understand what you're going
to say is not necessarily for publication. The <i>Pictorial's</i>
directorate has been advised, and I'm allowed to publish as much,
or as little, as the Mystery Man decides."</p>

<p>Lister took up his tale from the moment he went into his
wireless room and found the message to link in with Austin Chosen
over the air. Then followed the arrival of Constable Phelps and
the sweeping of the car for news of the Phantom Launch. Lastly,
he spoke of the call from Haslington, the wireless amateur at
Sutherland, during the early hours of the morning, informing him
of the death of Constable Smith on the beach at Yaney's
Inlet.</p>

<p>"We're just one point forwarder," Weston chuckled, slightly.
"We are now certain that Gideah Brading's death was not natural.
I had a talk with Mack over the 'phone a few minutes ago, and he
says that Smith was young, energetic, clean-living, and healthy.
His death is even more mysterious than Brading's, for he is known
in the district, and the police are aware of all his connections.
We'll leave him to the police for the time. The murder of a
swaggie may be a matter of routine to them, but when one of their
own comes to grief, then they're out for blood."</p>

<p>"It's a point, but a small one," agreed the expert. "Did you
know that Austin Chosen was acquainted with Francis Delaney
Hawson?"</p>

<p>"That's a question that won't puzzle us for long." Weston
turned to a small file of papers on his desk, and opened it.
"I've had a search made in our library for the history of Gideah
Brading. Do you want it?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">"SOMEWHERE in the history of Gideah Brading you
will find the clue to the Phantom Launch." Austin Chosen had
spoken those words but a few hours before. Now, on Tony Weston's
desk lay the records of the dead man's life.</p>

<p>"Remember the Pettington Frauds?" Weston asked the question
carelessly. Without waiting for an answer, he continued: "Wallace
Pettington, Gideah Brading and Simon Eccles. Three of the biggest
scoundrels unhung, yet at one time almost kings of the Melbourne
business world.</p>

<p>"Wallace Pettington!" Lister remembered only too well the
bulky, vivid personality that had loomed so large in the public
eyes. Wallace Pettington was to set the State of Victoria in the
seat of the premier State of Australia for all time.</p>

<p>The Victorian Land Progress Company was the medium of the
movement. It aimed to buy up the large outback stations and
subdivide them into small compact, intensive holdings for
stations and farms. The company would furnish everything, land,
material, machinery; and take everything, holding produce in huge
bonds until the arrival of favourable markets. Further, great
manufacturing centres were to be established throughout the State
where the primary products of the company clients were to be used
in the manufacture of secondary products for export and home
consumption.</p>

<p>The idea was attractive and, under the expert advertisement of
Wallace Pettington, stormed the popular imagination. Money poured
into the coffers of the company. Then came the Central Australian
Bank, acknowledged to be established to finance the Pettington
companies.</p>

<p>With the bank came Gideah Brading, once a minor stock-broker's
clerk, elevated to the post of general manager of Pettington's
bank. Again the genius for advertisement, inherent in Wallace
Pettington, forced the new institution to the front. Clients of
the Land Progress Company were compelled to open accounts at the
bank. Businesses which desired to deal with, and supply, the
Pettington Companies and its clients found it desirable to
establish accounts.</p>

<p>The Pettington Companies grew apace. Farmers, orchardists, and
Graziers required machinery. The Pettington Agricultural
Machinery Company came to life. Brickworks, preserving works,
some of them built before the first fruit tree had been planted
in the district to be served; construction companies! A bill was
promoted in the State Parliament to allow the Pettington Railway
Company&mdash;in process of formation&mdash;to link up the large
holdings the Land Progress Company had acquired.</p>

<p>The newspapers announced that a new era of prosperity had come
to the southern State. From all over the continent people flocked
to Victoria, eager to share in the prophesied boom promised by
the guiding spirit of prosperity. There was a golden future in
sight, shadowed only by one sinister figure.</p>

<p>A small stock operator named Simon Eccles had declared war on
the Pettington companies. Wallace Pettington's loud laughter rang
free and strong when he heard that Eccles had declared he would
bring Pettington and his companies to the ground. "They are
established on the impregnable hearts of the people," he boasted;
a phrase caught, and blazoned abroad by the newspapers.</p>

<p>Simon Eccles sold a bear on the Pettington companies,
principally the Central Australian Bank. Men wondered how he
managed to meet his continued losses. He did, always returning to
the attack. His efforts managed to beat down the bank shares
beyond a figure Wallace Pettington declared reasonable. The big
man roared in wrath. He denounced the operator, declaring he
would drive him out of the market.</p>

<p>Then commenced the historic battle. Pettington flung the
weight of his large fortune into the market to force up the price
of the bank's shares. He succeeded, a large section of the public
following his lead.</p>

<p>Simon Eccles was driven from the market. He met his
obligations, but continued to hover round the fringe of the
traders, constantly watching, always smilingly silently.</p>

<p>Wallace Pettington was not satisfied with his victory. He
aimed to place the shares beyond the reach of any fresh attack.
Slowly he drove the price up until the shares were quoted at
198.</p>

<p>"Two hundred to-morrow." Pettington stood on the pavement
before the great doors of the Stock Exchange. Simon Eccles passed
at the moment, and stopped.</p>

<p>"One hundred," he snapped, in his little, shrill voice. "I'm
selling to-morrow for one hundred, and I may go lower. Good-day
to you, Mr. Pettington."</p>

<p>The challenge and its immediate acceptance were broadcast
throughout Australia. The next day the market opened in tense
expectation. Proceedings were, at first, slow. Suddenly came a
swarm of sellers. Broker after broker came on the market with
huge parcels. Every offer was snapped up. Pettington rallied his
friends to meet the attack, but they had been out-generalled. The
day's trading closed at 101.</p>

<p>That night Wallace Pettington issued, through the newspapers,
an appeal to the public to protect their property from the
jealous attacks of interested persons. The response was
immediate. The shares began to recover in spite of unprecedented
sellings. The market closed in a turmoil, experts declaring that
the bears had sold more than the total capital of company.</p>

<p>The Central Australia Bank did not open its doors the next
morning. The general manager, Gideah Brading, had disappeared.
Wallace Pettington stepped forward with a declaration of future
responsibility, but public confidence had been shaken. A
financial newspaper pointed out that the funds of the bank had
been solely invested in the Pettington companies. A Government
investigation was ordered. Sympathy was openly expressed for
Wallace Pettington, and the general public expected him to pull
through. Simon Eccles was blamed for the downfall of the bank.
Few institutions could have weathered the big money behind the
speculator.</p>

<p>The arrest of Wallace Pettington came as an unexpected blow.
Most of the Pettington companies were in the hands of the
Official Receiver, but Wallace Pettington was declared on all
sides honest. Then a statement was issued that the companies
would not pay more than sixpence in the pound. The Pettington
companies negotiable paper littered the cash boxes of the various
companies, but all other assets had disappeared, or had been
mortgaged to the hilt.</p>

<p>Where had the money gone to? Hundreds of thousands of pounds
had passed through the coffers of the various companies. Accounts
had not been paid, although the companies had been strict in
regard to the profits allowed. The stream of gold had flowed
inwards; but a thin trickle of silver had flowed out. Where had
the money gone to?</p>

<p>"Used to bolster up the Stock Exchange attack," stated the
enemies of Wallace Pettington.</p>

<p>The arrest of Wallace Pettington was followed by the arrest of
Simon Eccles. They stood in the dock, the one-time enemies, on a
charge of conspiracy. The Crown claimed that Pettington and
Eccles had worked secretly for the downfall of the Pettington
companies. In spite of his heavily advertised buying, Wallace
Pettington did not own a single share in the Pettington companies
on the day of his arrest.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice claimed that Pettington had worked
up the price of the shares for to make a killing for Simon
Eccles, both men knowing the companies were thoroughly insolvent,
and the final smash but a matter of a few days. It was claimed
that Eccles had made a vast fortune out of the gamble. Where was
it? The total sum to the credit of the two men when arrested were
less than fifty pounds.</p>

<p>Wallace Pettington claimed he had ruined himself in trying to
save the companies from the attack of the Eccles group of
financiers. He claimed that he had thrown into the market his own
private fortune of nearly a hundred thousand pounds. Against that
Eccles pleaded that he had been but the agent of a group, and had
only profited by his commissions. He refused, at that stage, to
state who his clients were.</p>

<p>All this time Gideah Brading remained in hiding. An
inquisitive young constable, living in the Fitzroy district,
watched the actions of a man who came to lodge near by his home.
Guessing largely, he accosted the man by the name of "Gideah
Brading," and learned his shot in the dark was right.</p>

<p>Pettington, Eccles and Brading stood in the dock to face a
formidable list of charges. Very patiently the barristers for the
Crown traced the various involved threads of finance. They
established a motive, and the means whereby that motive had been
worked out, but they could not trace the huge sums of money taken
from the general public. Out of a capitalisation of well over a
million pounds, less than five thousand pounds had recovered.</p>

<p>After a very feeble defence, Pettington was sentenced to
fifteen years' penal servitude. Eccles and Brading received
sentences of ten years each. The sentences were light. Life, or a
public lynching, would have better met the public taste.</p>

<p>Pettington walked from the dock&mdash;to freedom. He descended
the steps from the dock to the underground passage to the prison.
He never entered that prison. How he escaped is one of the
mysteries of Victorian police history.</p>

<p>Eccles served two years of the sentence imposed on him. Then,
one day, he walked through the prison gates, and disappeared.
Gideah Brading served his sentence, receiving full remission
because of his excellent conduct.</p>

<p>Pettington and Eccles went free and, with them, hundreds of
thousands of the public money. They had eight years' start on
Brading, eight years to enjoy their ill-gotten gains. Had they
thought of the man who remained in prison to serve out his
sentence?</p>

<p>Gideah Brading had been released about eighteen months before
his death. It was probable he had sought out his former
associates, demanding a share in the plunder. The letter in the
note-case concealed in the swag beside the Inlet, showed that he
received large sums of money from some unknown source. The last
payment was the sum of £500, placed in the wooden box concealed
beneath the sands at the bluff.</p>

<p>"Somewhere in the history of Gideah Brading you will find the
clue to the Phantom Launch."</p>

<p>The clue. Was the Phantom Launch owned by Pettington, Eccles,
and Brading? Possibly not the latter, for there was reason to
believe the speed-boat had been used in the murder of the ex-bank
manager. Remained Eccles and Pettington. Were they the owners of
the boat? Had they a reason to get rid of Gideah Brading? If so,
what was that reason? Why had two of the criminals combined
against their late comrade&mdash;the one of the three who had
failed to escape the clutches of the law?</p>

<p>Francis Delaney Hawson had disembarked from the mail boat to
the Phantom Launch. What were his relations with Wallace
Pettington and Simon Eccles? Was he Pettington or Eccles? If so,
then who was Austin Chosen, who had deliberately referred to
Francis Delaney Hawson by his first names only?</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">THE history of Gideah Brading, as shown in the
papers relating to the Pettington frauds, did not throw much
light on the mystery of the Phantom Launch and the murders at
Yaney's Inlet. There was nothing to show how a high-powered
speed-boat could be of use to the three scoundrels who had
escaped with the loot from the Pettington companies.</p>

<p>Between the murders and the Phantom Launch there was a slight
connection. The Phantom Launch had been outside the Heads at the
assured time of the murder of Gideah Brading. It was suggested
that the launch was outside the Heads at the time of the murder
of Constable Smith, although Austin Chosen declared that the boat
had gone up the river. If Austin Chosen's theory was correct, the
one link connecting the Phantom Launch with the murder of Gideah
Brading was missing.</p>

<p>There was much against Chosen's theory. The letter found in
the man's swag at Yaney's Inlet showed that the ex-convict
expected to find a large sum of money hidden somewhere about the
Inlet; hidden in a place he knew. Lister and Weston had found
that place, and the money. It was the wooden box hidden under the
sands near the bluff.</p>

<p>The box formed a definite link in the chain of evidence.
Constable Phelps had seen the men from the Phantom Launch working
at a similar box, hidden in similar circumstances under the cliff
at Myella Cove. It was absurd to imagine that any two bodies of
men were interested in hiding similar boxes in similar positions.
Constable Smith had met his death by the sudden arrival of the
Phantom Launch at the bluff on the Inlet. More than probable he
had been caught unawares by the pirates, and had attempted to
arrest them. They had shot him down, and fled.</p>

<p>Who composed the crew of the Phantom Launch? Presuming that
Gideah Brading had sought out his comrades in crime, after his
release from imprisonment, it was certain he had demanded his
share of the plunder, and possibly, recompense for the long term
of imprisonment he had served while his partners had gone free.
There might have been a dispute over money. Brading might have
used threats&mdash;for he was the only one of the trio who had no
cause to fear the law. In desperation, Wallace Pettington and
Simon Eccles, fearing betrayal, had planned the ex-convict's
death. The wording of the letter gave grounds for such a
supposition.</p>

<p>So far, Lister and Weston found their theory correct, but now
they had to fit into the reconstruction the problem of Francis
Delaney Hawson, and his evasion of the Customs and Health
Authorities, through the Phantom Launch. Unless they could fit
that incident into the puzzle correctly, the whole of their
theory fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Was Francis Delaney Hawson the one-time Melbourne financier,
Wallace Pettington? If that was so, the jig-saw pieces of the
puzzle fitted admirably. The proof of that would lie in the
various Government departments of the States. A wealthy squatter
could be easily traced. To complete their theory, they had to
show that Wallace Pettington and Francis Hawson had not had
separate existences.</p>

<p>Lister was convinced that here their reconstruction failed.
Austin Chosen was interested in the tracking down and conviction
of the men who owned the Phantom Launch. He had declared them
desperate criminals&mdash;grave dangers to the community. Yet the
interview the expert had witnessed between the Mystery Man and
the squatter showed that Austin Chosen knew the man and his
history, and held him to be a separate entity in the problems
they were trying to fathom.</p>

<p>"What did Francis Hawson take from the mail boat?" Lister
asked the question suddenly.</p>

<p>"Take?" Weston roused himself from the reverie into which he
had fallen after the reading of the Gideah Brading records. "What
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What luggage did Hawson take from the mail boat to the
Phantom Launch?" repeated the expert. "I'm wondering if any of
the cases he transferred contained dutiable goods."</p>

<p>A reference to the file of the <i>Pictorial</i> on a side
table showed that Hawson was reported to have thrown a suitcase
on to the deck of the launch before leaving the mail boat. The
newspaper man turned to the telephone.</p>

<p>"What's the game, Tony?"</p>

<p>"Customs. I want to know what stuff Hawson left on board the
<i>Arathusa</i> when he did his flit."</p>

<p>"Dangerous." Lister was silent a moment. "Try the shipping
office. Customs might smell a rat and inform the police. They
would search and possibly make known the results of their search.
Then friend Hawson would know we were on his trail. The shipping
office will probably answer through a clerk, and he will take
your inquiries as newspaper stuff."</p>

<p>Weston nodded. He had his hand on the phone when the door
opened and a boy entered carrying a wet-proof photograph. The two
men bent over the photograph. Lister and his helpers had been
wonderfully successful.</p>

<p>Francis Hawson stood on the doorstep of Millington Chambers,
looking down on the man accosting him. He showed as a medium
height, stockily-built man with a round ruddy face. His body was
over-developed, and on the weary face showed lines of early
dissipation, accentuated by the recent worry. He wore an air of
dejection, possibly due to the manner in which Austin Chosen had
turned down his appeal for help.</p>

<p>"Now for the luggage question," Weston turned to the telephone
again. A few minutes later he replaced the receiver and turned to
his chum.</p>

<p>"Hawson's luggage is in the hands of the Customs authorities.
The clerk says he does not think it has been opened, but is being
held, pending the discovery of the owner. He wants to know if we
have any knowledge of where the man is."</p>

<p>"What did the suitcase contain?" asked the expert,
musingly.</p>

<p>"Dope?&mdash;Snow?" The journalist looked at his chum
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Not good enough. Hawson is one of the 'big bugs' of the
State, probably has more money than he knows what to do with.
Snow-running may be profitable, but it would mean little to a man
like him. He's got all the money he wants, and more."</p>

<p>"Then he doesn't belong to New South Wales," grinned Weston.
"I get around among a good many of the well-gilded ones, and I
never found one to answer to the call of 'enough.'"</p>

<p>"Who is Francis Delaney Hawson?" asked the expert, curiously.
"I know what we believe&mdash;that he is one of the biggest
squatters of the State. But what do the records show about him?
Can we connect him with the Pettington frauds through those
records?"</p>

<p>Weston reached up to the shelf of reference books.</p>

<p>"Here's your man," he answered, after a few minutes' search.
"'Hawson, Francis Delaney, born 1890, unmarried. Clubs, Carlton
and National. Hobbies, golf and work. Town residence, clubs.
Stations, Myollongowera, near Bourke; Wollangerera, near Bourke;
Wyono&mdash;Heavens! The man owns half the western district."</p>

<p>"Might wear a different complexion, if that book recorded the
mortgages. It would improve the interest&mdash;and dim the lustre
of a few shining stars."</p>

<p>"What's the game, Syd? You wouldn't listen to me when I cast a
suspicion of smuggling on the man. Now you seem to be trying to
retract your words."</p>

<p>"Who is Francis Delaney Hawson?" Lister was striding up and
down the little room. "When did he commence to acquire this list
of lands? I'm thinking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wallace Pettington?" Weston sat up suddenly. "That's where
the money went. Lor! What a game. Embezzlement, trial, sentence,
escape, and reappearance as one of the richest squatters in
Australia. If only we can prove it."</p>

<p>"When did he get Myollongowera and the other places? Who were
his parents? Where did he come from?" Lister halted in his
restless pacing of the room. "Again, Tony, where is Simon
Eccles?"</p>

<p>"Simon Eccles! I'd forgotten him." Weston stared thoughtfully
at the wet photograph on his desk. "Eccles was not the man to
allow Pettington to get away with the plunder. The file shows
that. Take the facts. Pettington had all the arrangements made
for a getaway in the case of conviction. He did not trust his
associates with those arrangements. That's certain. Pettington
goes free. Simon Eccles and Gideah Brading go to prison. Simon
Eccles serves two years and then escapes, disappearing as
completely as Pettington did. You're not going to tell me that
Wallace Pettington did not have a hand in Eccles' escape. The
matter was too clean-cut to have been arranged from within the
prison."</p>

<p>"Poor devil!" Lister spoke slowly. He had sat down, and his
chair was tilted back against the partition. "It took two years
for him to realise that he was serving a sentence while the
leader of the gang had gone free. Can you see the situation,
Tony? Eccles in prison suddenly learns that Pettington is free.
Did Pettington let him know that, and warn him that he was
planning for his release? I don't think so. I believe that Eccles
learned the news through one of the underground channels
prisoners have for communicating with the outside world."</p>

<p>"Pettington double-crossed him?" Weston spoke emphatically.
"The interval of time was too great for it to be otherwise."</p>

<p>"Exactly." Lister was speaking quickly. "Eccles gets to know
that Pettington has abandoned him to serve a long sentence, while
he is enjoying the fruits of the frauds. Eccles gets in touch
with Wallace Pettington, and insists that the master scoundrel
gets him free. Now, why does Pettington obey Eccles's
demands?"</p>

<p>"I'm guessing that Pettington never hid for a day. He had all
his plans worked out before the trial. He knew how he was to
escape, and where he was to go. The whole thing was worked out
down to the last trouser-button."</p>

<p>"That's so. Pettington never hid for a day. That's something
like evidence that he assumed a position of such prominence that
he would be above suspicion. Let us take it that he became
Francis Delaney Hawson."</p>

<p>"I believe you're right."</p>

<p>Weston whistled softly. "By Jove! Eccles couldn't have been
very pleased when he learned his late chief was safe and
wealthy."</p>

<p>"I guess he wasn't." Lister could not help laughing. "We'll
take it that a year elapsed after the prison gates closed on
Simon Eccles before he got in touch with Wallace Pettington. Then
Pettington had to say whether he was willing to help his late
associate to escape."</p>

<p>"My tip, he wasn't." Weston brought his hand down heavily on
the desk. "You've hit it, Syd. Perhaps more than one message
passed between Eccles in prison and Pettington outside.
Pettington hesitated. To enter into any scheme for Eccles
breaking prison would certainly endanger his own safety."</p>

<p>"So Eccles put the screw on. Pettington had to arrange the
escape&mdash;or&mdash;join him in prison. That mystery's
solved."</p>

<p>"But we're just as much in the dark regarding the Phantom
Launch and Pettington's connection with that boat as we were when
we started," objected Weston, almost angrily. "There's only one
thing to be done. I'm going to have those boxes opened. There may
be some clue in them that will lead us to the heart of the
mystery."</p>

<p>Weston turned to the telephone. Lister put out his hand as if
to check him, but drew it back. No great damage would be done by
an examination of the contents of the boxes Francis Hawson had
brought from abroad. Weston was a newspaper man, and his position
carried with it certain privileges, indefinite but valuable. The
Customs authorities might demur. They had the matter in their
hands. They could open the boxes, and tell the journalist just as
little, or as much, as they chose regarding the contents.</p>

<p>"They're not opened yet." Weston turned from the instrument.
"The Customs plead the police have the matter in hand, and that
they don't want to act except in strict accordance with police
wishes. Of course, that's all fudge. We know now who Francis
Hawson is. One of the 'big bugs' of the country. Possibly there's
a lot of influence being used to squash any proceedings and hand
over the luggage unexamined. Don't suit me. I'm going down there,
Syd. Coming? They'll open those boxes, or I'll know what they're
up to."</p>

<p>One of the boys entered the office, and threw the early
edition of the <i>Evening Moon</i> on the table. Weston picked it
up carelessly, and opened it. Suddenly he gave a shout, and
turned the paper so that Lister could see the bold
headline&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="headline">FRANCIS HAWSON ARRESTED FOR SMUGGLING</p><br>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">"ARRESTED for smuggling!" The two men looked at
the headline, incredulously. "What the devil do the Customs think
they are after?" exclaimed Weston.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Lister looked up from reading the few lines on the
front page of the <i>Moon</i>. "On the face of it there appears
to be a fair case against the squatter."</p>

<p>"That may be." Weston hesitated. "You know as well as I do
that smuggling in a case such as this is but a matter of a fine,
especially with a 'big' man, like Hawson. Ordinarily, the
authorities would proceed by summons. A warrant is&mdash;well,
it's out of all reason on the facts. There's something behind all
this."</p>

<p>"A lot, if what we suspect is correct." Lister sat back in his
chair and clasped his hands behind his head. "I suppose you
realise that if Hawson is Pettington the authorities have made
something like a haul. Prove that Hawson bought the stations he
now possesses out of the embezzled money, and you have a scoop
that will arouse Australia."</p>

<p>"What if Hawson is Eccles?"</p>

<p>"The same applies. Looks to me as if there were charges of
embezzlement, fraud, smuggling, and murder hanging over the man,
whatever his true name is, if he is Pettington, Eccles, or
Hawson."</p>

<p>"That's all got to be proved." Weston laughed as he turned to
the telephone. "Wonder when the case will be brought on? I want
to be there."</p>

<p>"This photo's good." Lister picked the print off the table,
and scanned the features of the squatter carefully. "Let me have
one of these as soon as possible, old man. I'm off."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Weston looked up from the
instrument.</p>

<p>"To prove that Hawson is not Pettington." Lister turned at the
door, and laughed at the surprised look on his chum's face.</p>

<p>It was early in the afternoon, and Lister had not lunched.
That ceremony could wait. His mind was filled with the one
question. What was the connection between Hawson and Pettington?
If they were one and the same man, then he had acquired his
interests in the stations around Bourke before the collapse of
the Pettington companies. A search at the Titles Office would
solve that problem. Lister made his way to the big offices in
Queen's Square.</p>

<p>An hour later the expert walked down to Pitt street and caught
the tram for the Quay. The affair was still more involved:
Francis Delaney Hawson had inherited Myollongowera and other
property from a Matthew Hawson in the year 1916. In later years
he had added other stations, and now held a considerable area of
land in the Bourke district.</p>

<p>If Hawson was Pettington, then the latter was an assumed name.
There was, however, the inheritance to be accounted for. Men of
the old squatter families did not usually want money&mdash;least
of all money obtained by fraud.</p>

<p>Hawson was not Pettington, nor was he Eccles. The supposition,
in face of what he had discovered, was absurd. For a man,
inheritor of large squatting interests, to enter the Melbourne
business world; to take a prominent place in the State's social
life; to have advertised himself and his companies, as Pettington
had done, would have been to court almost certain detection.
Hawson was not a fool, although he might be a rogue. He was not a
fool, or he could not have developed the Myollongowera property
to the big estate it now was.</p>

<p>Lister took the ferry to Balmoral. He wanted to see Constable
Phelps and find out if anything had been heard of the Phantom
Launch and the box that had been hidden under the sands at Myella
Cove. More than ever he was convinced that only by the capture of
the Phantom Launch would they solve the mystery of the
complicated series of happenings leading up to the shooting of
Constable Smith at Yaney's Inlet.</p>

<p>Phelps was not at the police station, and the young constable,
who alone represented the majesty of the law at the office, did
not appear to have any knowledge of where he was. The duty book
recorded him as being on "special duty." Sergeant Miller had gone
to town. He might be back any minute, or he might not return
until late at night.</p>

<p>For the moment Lister was undecided what to do. Then he turned
down to Bateson's boatsheds, and got out his little power-boat,
the <i>Cue</i>. Almost mechanically, he turned up Middle Harbour,
and passed under Spit Bridge. The Water Police boats had been
withdrawn, and the constable on duty at the bridge leaned
carelessly against one of the posts.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, but the summer sun would not set
for some hours yet. Lister had no special object in his mind. He
was puzzled and perplexed, and had thought a few hours on the
water might help to relax his brain. To come up Middle Harbour
had been natural. There, the Phantom Launch had taken refuge, and
there he might chance on some clue that would help him to solve
the many questions that chased continually through his head.</p>

<p>The <i>Cue</i> ran sweetly, and soon Lister passed into that
maze of islets and waterways known as Killarney. He had to
slacken speed, for outside the main channels the waters were
dangerous. For a long time he dodged in and out among the
islands, his brain resting on the wonderful and beautiful views,
opening as the boat sped along. He had passed out of the
frequented areas of the harbour, and only occasionally he caught
sight of a habitation. Twice he turned up inlets, to have to
retrace his way to the main channels.</p>

<p>At the north end of a long, well-wooded islet he caught sight
of a low boatshed, well overhanging the water. There were no
houses nearby, and he rather wondered at the shed being in that
lonely spot. Reducing speed, he crept slowly in until almost
against the rickety landing stage beside the shed. Against one of
the posts a nearly new manila rope was coiled, the end tied round
the post. The shed was locked, and looked as if rarely used. A
few turns of the screw and Lister came alongside the steps. He
sprang out and fastened the launch.</p>

<p>The door on the land side of the shed was locked and barred.
The wood of the building had shrunken, and through the cracks the
expert was able to view the interior of the shed. A few odds and
ends were scattered about, but there were no petrol tins, and no
masts nor sails. Yet, he was certain a boat had sheltered there
within the past few days.</p>

<p>Leaving the shed, Lister wandered around the small island. It
was a tiny place not more than an acre in extent, but well
wooded. To the west he could see a low point of land jutting out
into the Harbour, the waters sweeping around on either side. Away
north a broad sheet of water stretched out, and up towards the
end of it he could see the glint of sands.</p>

<p>He had come to associate sand with the activities of the
Phantom Launch. Returning to the <i>Cue</i> he turned into the
inlet and cautiously made his way towards the little beach. To
his surprise he found deep water under his keel, and the channel
widened out. Later it narrowed and came to the sand patch.</p>

<p>Shutting off power, Lister allowed the boat to come to gentle
rest on the sands. He took the anchor overboard and carried it to
the beach and made it secure. Then he looked around him.</p>

<p>The beach was deserted; it looked as if it had never known
human foot. Lister explored it from end to end, finally turning
into the bush behind the low bank. The place seemed to be a
wilderness of low trees and undergrowth, difficult to penetrate.
For some distance he fought his way in then, tired of the
struggle to advance, he turned and struck an angle to come out at
the beach at a different point to where he had entered the bush.
A few yards from the bank he crossed a small path.</p>

<p>It could hardly be termed a path. A mere beating down of the
rather thick undergrowth, leading into the bush towards some
remote point. Yet, it had been travelled recently.</p>

<p>Had the crew of the Phantom Launch used this path? It was
possible. They had been in Middle Harbour some hours. They might
have a house on one of the banks; it was still more likely they
had camped in the open, using the place as a temporary refuge.
They might have one of the mysterious wooden boxes hidden up the
Harbour.</p>

<p>Lister halted, almost inclined to return to the sands and
institute a search for the box. He decided he would first learn
where the path led.</p>

<p>The track dodged between the trees for some two hundred yards,
then came out on a small clearing at the foot of a low hill. The
sides of the hill were bare of trees, but the track remained
fairly plain up to the top of the hill. There it finished. For
some time Lister scouted about, but could find no further traces
of it.</p>

<p>From the top of the hill, he could see for some distance
around him. He was higher in the air than he had thought&mdash;it
was apparent the ground had steadily sloped upwards from the
water's edge. Away to the south-east he could see some chimneys
and the tops of buildings, probably at Manly. Far over on the
other side of the Harbour, he traced the long line of hills along
which the railway crawls on the way to Hornsby. Closer in he
could see a few houses, but near at hand the country seemed to be
deserted.</p>

<p>The path had led nowhere. Descending the hill, Lister had some
difficulty in finding the track through the bush. He got on to it
at length, and walked down towards where his boat was anchored.
Half-way, he halted suddenly.</p>

<p>He had been so keen in following the track to the top of the
hill that he had been blind to all else. Now, he discovered that
there was a track leading from the one he had followed, away to
his right. Hesitating a moment, he decided to follow it. The new
track led downhill and finished on the banks of a little creek,
beside a pool of fresh water. Scattered around the end of the
path were unmistakable signs of a recent camp.</p>

<p>For some time, Lister wandered round the spot. The camp had
been very recent. The ashes of the last fire were still fresh,
and beside the pool stood a quart billy with fresh smoke on the
outside. The interior was clean and bright except for the few
spots of rust just forming.</p>

<p>If the Phantom Launch had a shelter in Middle Harbour, then
this was it. Yet would they chance the almost certainty of
discovery by anchoring the speed-launch beside the small
beach?</p>

<p>Was there any connection between the deserted boatshed and the
camp behind the beach? Lister wondered. There might be such a
connection, but it would not be easily discovered&mdash;The crew
of the Phantom Launch were too clever for that.</p>

<p>If such a connection existed, then it would be more easily
discovered from the boatshed. Lister waded out to the <i>Cue</i>,
and backed the boat down the channel, until he could turn. Then
he sped down to the boatshed and tied up again at the rickety
wharf. He was determined to gain an entrance to the shed.</p>

<p>The door of the shed was fastened. Lister walked round the
three land sides, seeking some entrance. At several points,
warped boards allowed a view of the interior, but he could not
force a way in.</p>

<p>Again at the stage Lister examined the water-front of the
building. The tide had fallen since he had first arrived there,
and the doors barely reached to the water surface. There might be
a chance of getting in that way. He jumped into his boat, and
pushed out a little, sounding the depths with a boat hook. It was
deep, much deeper than he imagined. With the small draught of the
Phantom Launch it would be possible for the boat to enter the
shed at all tides. The shed was plenty big enough to hold
her.</p>

<p>For the crew of the Phantom Launch to occupy the boatshed was
to run the risk of discovery, and capture. Yet that risk had not
been hers until after the transference of Francis Hawson from the
mail boat. In a flash the solution came to the expert. The shed
had been the home of the Phantom Launch while the speed-boat was
in Middle Harbour. After they had learned that the police were
blockading Middle Harbour, and before the dash for freedom, they
had camped by the little creek.</p>

<p>Returning to the island, Lister carefully quartered the land.
Almost in the centre of the land, hidden in the thick growth of
trees, he found what he sought. There had been a permanent camp
there, now dismantled. A camp that showed signs of use over long
periods.</p>

<p>This island, then, had been the headquarters of the crew of
the Phantom Launch. They had deserted it when they knew the
harbour was to be searched. They had gone to the spit of sand at
the head of the inlet and, possibly, had toured the harbour for
some place where the speed-boat could lay sheltered throughout
the police search. Not discovering a place where they could be
reasonably certain the Phantom Launch would be safe, they had
decided on the mad dash out of the harbour.</p>

<p>The boatshed was his next objective. Returning to the
<i>Cue</i>, Lister stripped and dived into the water. A few
strokes, and he was at the water-doors of the building. A dive
and he came up inside the gloomy shed.</p>

<p>There were signs that the place had been stripped of
everything that could give any clue to the activities of the
Phantom Launch. At one time there had been a small worktable in
the shed. On a shelf he found wires jutting out of the wall. The
crew of the Phantom Launch had possessed a wireless receiving
plant. The marks of the earth wire showed plainly on the
walls.</p>

<p>Once back on the <i>Cue</i>, Lister dressed and landed. He
walked around the shed, and some little way into the bush. A few
minutes showed where the aerials had hung front the trees.</p>

<p>One of the trees had been barked, and the smooth wood carved
strangely. Twin hearts had been cut, and in one the name "Bill
Stump" engraved. The other heart bore the sign, "F T 14."</p>

<p>For some time Lister studied the marks. They were not the work
of vandal trippers. For one thing, the island was far from the
track of casual visitors. Again, why had one of the trees
supporting the aerials been used for such a purpose? The expert
satisfied himself that, for a big distance around, other trees
had not been interfered with in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The engravings had a cryptic message. Lister's thoughts
travelled to the camp by the creek, and then back to the sandy
beach. He turned and made for his boat. A few minutes later he
stood against the bank behind the sands. Yes. There was a low
blackened stump. He had noticed it when he first came to the
beach, but had not examined it. Some saplings were growing close
around it. He forced them to one side, bending down. A patch on
the stump had been cleared of the charcoal, and on it had been
engraved the twin hearts bearing the signs.</p>

<p>"Bill Stump." That referred to the blackened stump. Next came
"F T 14."</p>

<p>Lister tore one of the saplings from the roots, and peeled and
sharpened the thin end. On the sands he measured 14 feet from the
low bank directly under the stump, and straight out to the water.
He thrust in the stake, and immediately found his arm violently
jarred. Had he found a stone, or one of the mysterious boxes?</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">A QUARTER of an hour later, Lister uncovered
another of the mysterious wooden boxes he had come to associate
with the Phantom Launch. Delving down the side, he came on one of
the handles, and strove to pull the box out of the hole. It would
not move. He scooped the sand from round the box, and again tried
to lift it. The box was firmly fixed.</p>

<p>Lister felt in his pockets. After the discovery of the second
box at Yaney's Inlet he had taken the key Weston had opened the
box with to a locksmith, and had had a skeleton key made to fit
similar locks. He carried this key on his chain. It required some
manipulation, but at length there came a slight click, and the
bolt flew back. Lister lifted the lid. As he expected, the box
was empty.</p>

<p>The expert sat before the empty box for some time, striving to
reason out its use to the Phantom Launch. The boxes seemed so
meaningless, yet so full of significance and danger.</p>

<p>In the case of the two boxes, at Myella Cove and Yaney's
Inlet, it had been possible to lift them out on the sands. This
box was immovable. It had been anchored deeply into the sands.
Why?</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, Lister braced himself and strained on the
handle. He could not move the box. He examined the interior
again, first drawing on the rubber gloves he had used at the
Inlet. The sides of the box were of uncommon thickness, while the
lid was of average-sized wood.</p>

<p>Inch by inch the expert went over the interior of the box. It
Had been carefully put together, the joints exactly squared, and
the surfaces smoothed. Yet this was not the work of an expert
box-builder; an amateur had made it, taking particular regard to
the finish of his work. Absolutely mystified, Lister locked the
box and covered it with the sand. So far as he was able, he
obliterated all signs of his presence on the sand patch.</p>

<p>Lister backed the <i>Cue</i> into deep water and turned. It
was growing dark, and he wanted to get home as soon as possible.
Arriving at the boatshed, he handed over the launch to the man in
charge and walked up towards his house. Half-way he met Constable
Phelps.</p>

<p>"You were looking for me, Mr. Lister?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Come up to the house." The expert led the way to his
sitting-room. Ah Sam slipped noiselessly into the room with a
tray of glasses and the soda siphon. "Do you remember the
Pettington fraud cases, Phelps?"</p>

<p>"There's something at the back of my mind," the constable
said, after some minutes' thought. "Pettington? Let me see."</p>

<p>"Pettington, Simon Eccles, and Gideah Brading."</p>

<p>"Gideah Brading?" Phelps jumped up from his chair. "The
Sergeant's just heard from Headquarters that the man found dead
at Yaney's Inlet was named Brading."</p>

<p>"The same man. Now, keep this under your hat, Phelps. I want
to get hold of photographs of all three men. Can you manage it
without making it too official?"</p>

<p>"That's to say you want to keep what you know from the
authorities for a time." Phelps thought for a few moments. "Going
back into the newspaper game, Mr. Lister?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of." Lister hesitated. "I have a hunch that
the Pettington people are mixed up in this matter of the Phantom
Launch. Keep what I tell you to yourself, Phelps, and get me the
information I want, and you shall have my information, exclusive,
when the time to act arrives."</p>

<p>"Good." The constable swung round and held out his hand. "I've
a pal in the Melbourne Force, and I'll drop him a line tonight.
He'll get the information, but he'll want to share in the
kudos."</p>

<p>"That's for you to arrange," laughed the expert. "There's a
mint of money to be discovered, and the whereabouts of two
convicted criminals."</p>

<p>"That's it!" Phelps turned suddenly. "Pettington! I remember
now. Wallace Pettington. The man who escaped from the court dock.
The thing was in my mind all the time, but it happened before I
joined the force."</p>

<p>The constable went off to write his letters. He had hardly
turned out of the road before Weston walked up to the door. He
had brought with him the photograph of Francis Hawson.</p>

<p>Weston listened gravely while Lister recounted his afternoon's
adventure. He made no comment, but at the end of the expert's
recital stated be had wired to Melbourne for all information
about the three criminals. He had also sent a copy of the
photograph to Austin Chosen.</p>

<p>"What's Chosen's wireless call?" the newspaper man asked,
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Austin Chosen?" Lister tried to think. "Yes, he told me he
had an experimental set, but I don't remember seeing his name on
the list. Funny! Come to the wireless room, old man. I have a
list there."</p>

<p>Austin Chosen was not the registered owner of an experimental
set. Lister sat back in his chair and frowned thoughtfully. The
authorities were very careful that all transmitting sets were
properly registered and recorded.</p>

<p>"Looks as if Austin Chosen was a 'pirate,'" laughed Weston.
"Maybe, though, his name is kept off the list for some reason or
other."</p>

<p>"You should know." Lister swung round on his chum. "Surely
your sister has spoken of it to you."</p>

<p>"That's where you're mistaken." Weston looked grave. "When she
went to work with Austin Chosen there was some promise given.
Ysobel never talks about anything at her office. She refuses to
answer any questions about Austin Chosen whatever. Fact. I asked
her some questions one day, thinking I could get a good general
article on the man, and she told me plainly that I was out of
court&mdash;all subjects taboo."</p>

<p>Lister turned to his big transmitter and swung the dials. He
was certain that Austin Chosen intended to communicate with him
over the air. Possibly, had it not been for the unexpected
intrusion of Francis Hawson, the Mystery Man would have given him
his private call signal.</p>

<p>"One thing puzzles me." Weston spoke suddenly. "Why did the
men of the Phantom Launch remove the box from Myella Cove?"</p>

<p>It was a question that had puzzled Lister many times. There
was a definite purpose in placing the boxes under the sands at
various spots around Sydney. He believed there were other boxes
still to be discovered. What purpose was being served by the
apparently aimless placing of empty boxes in the sands of the
harbours? They bore some definite connection to the work of the
Phantom Launch. Of that he was certain; but what was the
connection? He rose from his seat and walked to the window. The
moon was high in the sky, making the surrounding country almost
as light as day.</p>

<p>"Let us have a look at the box at Myella Cove," he said,
turning to the newspaper man. "Phelps thought he knew where the
box was buried, but I'm not so certain. He may have made a
mistake."</p>

<p>"Good-o!" Weston rose to his feet quickly. "There's nothing
else to do. Might as well have a hunt for the box. Later we may
get a message from Chosen on the air."</p>

<p>They walked down to the boatshed and took out the <i>Cue</i>.
Weston had made many journeys in the little power-boat, and
immediately took over the engines, leaving Lister to feel a way
in through the dangerous reefs. They beached the boat gently and
carried the anchor ashore. This visit Lister made no pretence at
a fishing excursion. If the box had really been removed, the crew
of the Phantom Launch knew the police had discovered the box, and
were probably watching.</p>

<p>Lister had brought with him two pointed sticks. A few minutes,
and they located the constable's mark on the cliff. Remembering
the marks he had found in Middle Harbour, Lister paced off
fourteen feet and drove his stick deeply into the sands, close to
the cliff.</p>

<p>Very carefully they probed the sand in a half-circle of
fifteen feet from the mark, driving in the sticks at about twelve
inch intervals. Weston worked steadily for some time, but when
the untouched space contracted to a few feet, he put down his
stick and walked to the face of the cliff. Just as Lister was
making the final probes, the newspaper man called to him.</p>

<p>"Come and have a look at this, Lister. There's something
damned queer here."</p>

<p>He was standing close against the cliff, about twenty feet
from the mark Phelps had made on the cliff face. When Lister came
up the journalist pointed to a mark, very similar the one Phelps
declared he had made.</p>

<p>"That's queer." Lister took his torch from his pocket and
swept the light along the face of the cliffs. "You go that way,
Tony, and I'll work back to where the mark we worked around is.
There seems to be no doubt but that Phelps was observed from the
Phantom Launch or the shore, the night he saw the men working at
the box."</p>

<p>"You think the beggars came ashore and dug up the box?" Weston
frowned thoughtfully. "No, there's no sense in that. Those marks
have another meaning."</p>

<p>Working towards opposite ends of the cove, the two men
carefully examined the rock-face. They found no fewer than nine
similar signs drawn on the rocks.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Syd?" The two men had come together
where Phelps' mark showed on the cliff.</p>

<p>Lister did not answer. For some moments he stood gazing at the
mark and at the holes they had dug in the sands. After a time he
approached the cliff and slowly paced along for about twenty
yards in each direction. At a point he stopped and called to the
journalist.</p>

<p>"What's this, Tony?"</p>

<p>Weston added the power of his torch to Lister's. On the rock
was a tracing of fine criss-cross lines, apparently the work of
some idle youth. The expert left Weston examining the marks, and
walked down to the water's edge. There he turned and surveyed the
face of the cliffs.</p>

<p>"Come here, Tony." He turned his chum to face the Phelps
mark.</p>

<p>Two parts of the cliff were almost duplicates. They appeared
in the moonlight to be two tall pillars reaching well up the face
of the cliffs, between them a dark patch showing, very similar to
a doorway.</p>

<p>"There's where Phelps went wrong." Lister laughed slightly.
"When he came here with me he mistook one of those pillars for
the other. On one of them is the cross-hatching, concealing the
mark Phelps made. On the other is the false mark drawn by someone
from the Phantom Launch, and designed to put Phelps off the scent
if he came back to get the box."</p>

<p>"Then under here lies the box from the Phantom Launch!"
exclaimed Weston, walking across to where the cross-hatching
showed on the cliff. He drove his stick sharply into the sands,
and dropped his hand at the jar on his elbow. "Jove, Syd! I
believe I've hit it."</p>

<p>A few minutes' work and the wooden box was again revealed.
Lister took out his skeleton key and opened the lock. The lid
swung back. The box, like the others, was empty.</p>

<p>"Can you beat it?" Weston sat back on his haunches. "Three
boxes buried in the sands at various points, and all of them
empty."</p>

<p>Lister did not answer. He had donned his rubber gloves and was
feeling round the interior of the box. Presently he pulled off
the gloves, and started to clear the sands from the sides of the
box.</p>

<p>"Give me a hand, Tony. I want this box on the top. It's not as
innocent as I supposed."</p>

<p>For some minutes the two men tugged and strained, but the box
would not move. It was firmly anchored into the sands.</p>

<p>"Thought so." Lister felt in his pocket tor his penknife.
Opening it, he carefully donned the gloves again, and bent to the
box. "Look out, Tony. Something might happen."</p>

<p>The expert poised the knife in his hand, shielding his face
with his arm. Suddenly he plunged the knife down into the wood at
the bottom of the box. There was a slight report, and an
intensely white flame leaped high in the air. For the moment the
surroundings were brilliantly illuminated. Then darkness fell
again. Lister was on his back on the sands, some distance from
the box, insensible.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE force of the explosion had thrown both men
to the ground. After a few moments Weston, who had missed the
full blast of the explosion, staggered to his feet and turned to
look for his chum. Lister was lying close by, insensible. The
journalist went to the water and brought some in his hat. Slowly
he trickled the water on to the white, drawn face, and in a few
minutes the expert opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"What the devil was in that box?" Weston asked the question,
almost angrily. "Thought you knew better than to go monkeying
with a thing like that."</p>

<p>Lister sat up on the sands and rubbed his eyes. He had escaped
through his precaution of holding his arm across his face, but he
was thoroughly shaken and nervous. Holding on to the journalist's
arm, he staggered to his feet and walked over to where the box
still lay in the hole. It had not been shattered by the
explosion, but lay in its original position, some of the woodwork
smouldering slowly.</p>

<p>"Interesting." Lister dropped to his knees and peered into the
box. "Say, Tony, get some water and put out that fire. I don't
want the box destroyed."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Bury it again." The expert half turned to Weston. "Get busy,
old chap. A bit of charring will not be noticed, but if it
spreads too far those chaps will begin to wonder. The explosion
won't matter. They'll think something went wrong with their
apparatus. But if the box is too much burned they may suspect
that someone knows as much as they do."</p>

<p>"Then it isn't me." Weston went down for the water and
returned with a hat-full. "I haven't a notion of what it's all
about."</p>

<p>"Two or three days in my workshop will make the thing plain."
In spite of his accident, Lister seemed relieved and happy. "The
man who is running this business has brains."</p>

<p>The smouldering was quickly extinguished, Lister taking care
that very little water splashed into the box. When he was
satisfied that the fire was extinguished, he scooped the sand
back into the hole, after re-locking the box. Finally, he cleaned
up all footmarks on the beach.</p>

<p>"That'll do." The two men were standing at the edge of the
water, looking back towards the cliff. "The tide will wash out
these footprints. Get in, Tony. I'll shove her off."</p>

<p>In almost silence the two men returned to Balmoral. Lister led
the way through his house to the wireless shed.</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock." Lister looked at the ship's clock, hanging
on the wall. "We've had something of a day, Tony, and it's not
finished yet."</p>

<p>"Suppose I'm not to know the secret of the boxes." Weston
looked curiously at his chum. "You seem to be keeping a lot to
yourself, Syd."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not talk until I'm sure." Lister seated himself
before the big transmitter. "There are a few nebulous ideas that
must be tested by experiment. Leave me alone for a couple of
days, and I may be able to give you a big story. Now, open up the
'eight-valve,' Tony. See what the broadcasters have for us
to-night."</p>

<p>In a few seconds one of the big Sydney programmes filled the
little room. Lister sat listening for a while. Then he switched
the transmitter on to a loud-speaker and set at neutral. He
crossed to where the wireless directory hung on the wall, and
studied it in silence.</p>

<p>"Thought so," he exclaimed, partly to himself. "Austin Chosen
has managed to keep his set off the directory. Do you know, Tony,
there's half a dozen of the big amateur experimental sets not on
this list. The Government give them exemptions for State
reasons."</p>

<p>"That so?" Weston had picked up the Broadcaster programme, and
was tuning to get the best volume of sound.</p>

<p>"What about a trip to the Inlet tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"What for?" Weston turned suddenly. "Again there's a big idea
I fail to catch."</p>

<p>"To see if the box at the Inlet is as firmly fixed in the
sands as the other two."</p>

<p>"Any more monkeying about with penknives? If so, I beg to be
excused. The <i>Pictorial</i> has the absurd idea that my life is
of some value in the newspaper world."</p>

<p>"Guarantees given." Lister laughed and crossed to the
transmitter. "Shut off that noise. I'm going to try to get Austin
Chosen."</p>

<p>Lister sat down and fitted the earphones. He had switched on
power and drawn the microphone to him, when his call
sounded:&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="typewriter">"NKH! NKH!"</p>

<p><br> For some minutes Lister did not answer. He sat before the
instrument, a puzzled frown on his face. Was it Austin Chosen
speaking, or one of the numerous amateur experimenters who
sometimes called him? If Austin Chosen, all well and good; but he
did not want to be interrupted by others. He could not tell them,
abruptly, to get off the wave, and while he was dealing with them
he might miss the Mystery Man.</p>

<p>"Tune in to my wave length, old man," he said quietly. "That
will leave my instrument free if it is not Austin Chosen."</p>

<p>Lister brought the transmitter into action and gave his name.
Immediately the loud speaker on the receiving set
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not too bad. Tune down to 85 metres. A.C. speaking."</p>

<p>A sign from Lister and Weston cut out the eight valve. The
expert tuned on to the required length and waited. A pause and
the Mystery Man spoke again.</p>

<p>"Sydney Lister. What have you discovered? Mention no names and
be as brief as you can."</p>

<p>Briefly, and in a manner he believed only Austin Chosen would
understand, Lister gave a resume of his and Weston's work during
the day. The Mystery Man listened in silence until the report was
finished.</p>

<p>"So you think F.H. is W. P.? You'll have to prove that."</p>

<p>"You've seen the man. What is your opinion? You know him, Mr.
Chosen."</p>

<p>"I know him." There was a grimness in the tone. "I know no
good of him, if that is what you mean. How about that box? What
do you mean to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I don't think the men will discover that it has been
touched. They will think the destruction was caused by some error
of their apparatus. I mean to go down to Yaney's Inlet as soon as
possible. I have a faint idea of the use these boxes are being
put to, but would not like to give an opinion until I have had
the time to make a few experiments."</p>

<p>"Don't try penknife experiments." A slight chuckle accompanied
the words. "You may not escape the second time."</p>

<p>Lister laughed. He had been lucky in escaping from serious
injury that evening. When he had stabbed his penknife into the
wood he had known he took a serious risk. It had been a sudden
impulse, and he had paid for it with intolerable stinging over
his face and hands.</p>

<p>"What is the next step?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Go on along your own lines for the present. Trace W.P., F.H.,
and the Phantom Launch. I am working along another thread of the
tangled skein. In time our work will meet, and we shall be able
to continue together to the end. Remember, Lister, this is not
some ordinary mystery, but roots deeply into the unknown."</p>

<p>"A mystery, sure enough." interjected Weston aloud.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" The question came over the air, fraught with
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Tony Weston." Lister answered as quietly as he could.</p>

<p>"He's all right. Don't let anyone into your wireless room
except him, that is, unless you first advise me. That's all. Use
your call-sign in doubles to call me, and then tune down to the
present wave-length. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Surely you can give me some better information about the
matter. I feel I am working in the dark," protested the
expert.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Lister tried to get in touch again, using
his call-sign, as instructed, in doubles. After a time one of the
many wireless amateurs answered, and Lister was compelled to
carry on a technical conversation for a few minutes. Making an
excuse, he shut the instrument down and turned to the newspaper
man.</p>

<p>"What do you make of things, Tony?"</p>

<p>"Queer business," the journalist replied after some thought.
"Austin Chosen has always been a queer bird. You say he knew
Hawson when he walked in on him."</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of that."</p>

<p>"Then, if he knows the man, he knows whether he is Wallace
Pettington or not." Weston spoke emphatically. "Though Austin
Chosen is just as like as not to deny knowledge until he is
prepared to speak fully."</p>

<p>"Silver Swan! Silver Swan!" The words came delicately over the
air. Lister held up his hand, enjoining silence.</p>

<p>The words were followed by the regular "tick, tick" of a watch
held against the microphone. Lister drew a pad towards him and
wrote a few words hurriedly. Weston leaned forward to read them,
then nodded. He turned to the eight valve, and tuned to 37
metres. There was no sound from the loud-speaker. Lister raised
his hand into the air and Weston looked puzzled. The expert again
raised his hand, and the journalist caught his meaning. Slowly he
raised the wave-length until at 56 metres the loud-speaker came
in with the "tick, tick-"'</p>

<p>Lister cut out his transmitter, setting the machine at
neutral. For some moments he hesitated, listening to the soft
"tick, tick." He took his watch and hung it against the
microphone. Then he waited with his finger on the switch.
Immediately the "tick, tick" ceased he threw on power and sent
the ticking of his watch on the air. Counting the ticks he closed
down on the sixty-fifth tick. Again came the soft voice.</p>

<p>"Silver Swan! Silver Swan!"</p>

<p>The expert threw out the switch and turned to his chum.</p>

<p>"Who was that speaking, Tony?"</p>

<p>There was no need to ask the question. Weston's face was
expressive of intense amazement.</p>

<p>"Why, that was Yso&mdash;"</p>

<p>AGAIN the low, familiar voice came over the air:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pirates' Bay! Pirates' Bay!" Then followed one of the queer
intervals Lister was slowly beginning to understand. "Pirates'
Bay! Silver Swan!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">THE usual list of drunks and minor offences were
being quickly cleared at No. 1. Central Police Court when Weston
steered Lister up to the reporters' table. They had only a few
minutes to wait before the name of Francis Delaney Hawson way
called. The man Lister had seen in the mirror on Ysobel Weston's
desk rose from a seat behind the solicitors' table. A tall, thin,
long-faced man also rose to his feet, intimating that he
represented the defendant, and applied for permission for Hawson
to remain seated behind the solicitors' table. He asked for a
remand on bail for seven days.</p>

<p>Curtis Hinde, the well-known representative of the Crown Law
Department half-rose and murmured that he would not oppose. There
was a slight rustle of papers, and the magistrate wrote a few
words in his casebook. Hawson was whispering, angrily, to his
solicitor.</p>

<p>"Your Worship." Hawson turned from his solicitor to the
magistrate. "I want to protest. I'm here, and I don't want to
mess about with the matter week after week. Why can't the case be
heard now?"</p>

<p>"Look out for ructions." Weston bent towards Lister and
whispered. "The man's mad."</p>

<p>"You are represented by your solicitor, Mr. Rawlins, I
believe."</p>

<p>The long man rose gravely to his feet, and bowed.</p>

<p>"I have advised my client that a remand is necessary to
completely answer the charges," he said in a melancholy voice.
"He does not appear to have confidence in me."</p>

<p>"It's nonsense." Hawson was working himself into a temper.
"I'm willing to admit I jumped the mail boat on to a launch and
came to land in it. What's all the trouble about?"</p>

<p>"You are charged with smuggling, evading the Customs
examination, and entering the country without undergoing the
necessary medical examination." The Stipendiary magistrate, Mr.
Yessell looked at the defendant over his spectacles. "Are you
prepared to plead guilty?"</p>

<p>"If you worship pleases." The level melancholy voice broke in
on the excited speech of the defendant. "Mr. Hawson has placed
his interests in my hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I can't wait. I may not be able to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you not realise that you are on bail at present." The
magistrate interrupted quickly. "What do you mean by saying that
you may not be here at the adjourned hearing?"</p>

<p>"I may be prevented." Hawson sat down sullenly.</p>

<p>"Very extraordinary!" Mr. Yessell lifted his eyebrows in
interrogation of the defending solicitor. "Mr. Rawlins.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was almost complete silence in court for a couple of
minutes. The Crown Law representative headed towards Rawlins and
whispered a few words. The solicitor nodded.</p>

<p>"If your Worship pleases. I am afraid my client it not in the
best of health."</p>

<p>"All nonsense." Hawson was on his feet again, gesticulating
wildly. "I'm willing to go into the box." He came round the
table, walking irregularly, and looking wildly around him.</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>A policeman caught him by the arm, and looked up at the
magistrate for instructions.</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to go on with the case, Mr. Hinde?" The
magistrate turned abruptly to the Crown Law representative.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But to meet the convenience of my learned friend I
am prepared to consent to an adjournment of seven days."</p>

<p>"You wish for an adjournment, Mr. Rawlins?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your Worship." The solicitor bent almost double over the
table. "I have only had time for one short interview with my
client, and that did not impress me."</p>

<p>"Impress you? What do you mean?" The magistrate asked the
question sharply.</p>

<p>"I do not consider my client is in a state of health to be
allowed to plead. I suggest an adjournment for seven days, and in
that period I will undertake to have my client placed under
medical care. I hope at the adjourned hearing Mr. Hawson will
be&mdash;er&mdash;less excited."</p>

<p>"I want to make a statement." Hawson was struggling against
the detaining hands of the constable. For a moment the magistrate
sat undecided. Then he nodded to the constable.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to agree with Mr. Rawlins." Mr. Yessell spoke
slowly. "The defendant has admitted evading the Customs, pleading
against the advice of his solicitor. The course I am about to
take is unusual, but I shall allow Mr. Hawson to make a
statement. After I have heard what the defendant has to say I may
decide that further proceedings are unnecessary. The defendant is
certainly ill."</p>

<p>"May I ask that the case be proceeded with at once." Curtis
Hinde was on his feet. "I withdraw my consent to an
adjournment."</p>

<p>The magistrate looked at the defending solicitor. Mr. Rawlins
shrugged his narrow shoulders and sat down, abruptly. Mr. Hinde
whispered a few words to him as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>The Crown Law representative confined his evidence to the
evasion of the Customs regulations by leaving the mail boat by
the Phantom Launch. Captain Anstey was the first witness, and
stated that the defendant had been a passenger on the voyage from
England. Ship's officers followed and detailed the transferring
from the mail boat to the launch, some three miles outside Sydney
Heads. They swore that Hawson threw on the launch a large
suit-case before be left the <i>Arathusa</i>.</p>

<p>"Are you going to place your client in the witness box, Mr.
Rawlins?" The magistrate broke the long silence that followed the
closing of the prosecution. Before the solicitor could answer,
Hawson had left his seat and entered the witness box. With a
shrug of resignation the solicitor got to his feet.</p>

<p>The squatter answered the opening questions of the examination
calmly and intelligently. Suddenly, the solicitor hesitated, as
if undecided how to proceed.</p>

<p>"You told the magistrate, a few minutes ago, that you wished
to make a statement, Mr. Hawson?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You understand you are making that statement against my
advice?"</p>

<p>"That is not a question you should put to your witness, Mr.
Rawlins?" The magistrate, with difficulty, concealed a smile. The
long solicitor bowed low again, and sat down. Circumstances were
against him, and he was inclined to allow matters to take their
course. His client had refused his advice; he was wealthy enough
to pay the cost. Mr. Hinde rose to his feet and turned to the
witness, but the magistrate motioned him to be seated.</p>

<p>"A little while ago you stated you might be prevented from
attending the Court in the case of an adjournment." Mr. Yessell
spoke quietly. "Will you explain what you meant by that
remark?"</p>

<p>"I might not be allowed to come here again." Hawson spoke so
low that it was almost difficult to bear him at the reporters'
table.</p>

<p>"Who would prevent you? You understand you have to-day
surrendered to your bail. If the case is adjourned you would, in
the ordinary course, be released on the same bail."</p>

<p>"They would not let me come!" Again the answer was in little
better than a whisper.</p>

<p>"They? Who are they?" The magistrate spoke sharply.</p>

<p>Hawson did not reply. He stood, almost trembling, in the
witness box. staring into vacancy over the heads of the people at
the back of the court. The magistrate repeated his question, but
the man did not answer.</p>

<p>"I shall remand the defendant in custody for seven days," Mr.
Yessell declared, after some thought. "The authorities should
have him examined, and bring the doctors to the adjourned
hearing. I shall require to hear them on the defendant's mental
condition."</p>

<p>"I want to make a statement." The squatter turned sharply to
the magistrate, almost shouting. "I will make a statement."</p>

<p>"Your Worship." Mr. Rawlins rose gravely. "May I suggest, as
the case has proceeded so far, that the defendant be allowed to
make his statement. It will not delay the time of the Court many
minutes, and I believe that in the obvious state of my client's
health, no cause should be given for further excitement."</p>

<p>"Very well." The magistrate turned to the man in the witness
box. "I will hear you, but you must make your statement as short
as possible."</p>

<p>Mr. Rawlins rose to his feet again, showing more decision than
he had formerly exhibited. Almost brusquely, he turned to his
client.</p>

<p>"You say you wish to make a Statement, Mr. Hawson. Will you
commence by stating where you embarked on board the mail boat
<i>Arathusa</i>?"</p>

<p>"In London. April the third." The squatter smiled quietly.</p>

<p>"How long had you been in London before embarking?"</p>

<p>"Five days."</p>

<p>"You had arrived in London from Australia?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where had you been previous to your arrival in England?"</p>

<p>"In the United States of America."</p>

<p>"How long had you been there before going to England?"'</p>

<p>"About eighteen months."</p>

<p>Mr. Rawlins sat down with a look of bewilderment on his face,
and to the Crown Law representative Hinde rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I think we have heard enough, your Worship," he said in a low
voice. "I shall instruct the department that Mr. Hawson is
suffering from some mental trouble and is not in a position to be
accountable for his actions."</p>

<p>"You mean that the prosecution withdraws Mr. Hinde." The
magistrate looked perplexed. "Certainly the defendant appears to
be suffering from mental excitement, but his statements up to the
present appear to be perfectly lucid. In fact, I consider him a
most intelligent witness, answering the questions put to him
clearly and fully and without the unnecessary explanations most
witnesses in this court seem to think necessary."</p>

<p>"I must apologise, your Worship. I should have placed certain
information before you before withdrawing&mdash;information that
makes my attitude perfectly clear. With your permission I will
ask the defendant two questions and hand to him a
document&mdash;" The Crown Law officer turned to Hawson.</p>

<p>"You stated you were in the United States of America during
the past eighteen months, and came to Sydney on the mail boat,
<i>Arathusa</i>, from London?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"During that eighteen months you have not visited
Australia?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Will you be so good as to read this telegram aloud?" The
constable standing by the witness box stepped to the solicitors'
table and took a telegram to the witness. Hawson produced a pair
of spectacles and fitted them on his nose. He bent and read the
telegram; his face flushed, and he violently crushed the paper
into a ball.</p>

<p>"It's a lie&mdash;a lie."</p>

<p>"I thought so." Mr. Hinde smiled sightly. "Your Worship, the
telegram is from the officer in charge of the police station at
Bourke, and reads:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">SQUATTER FRANCIS DELANEY HAWSON AT
MYOLLONGOWERA STATION UP TO THREE WEEKS AGO. LEFT IN OWN CAR FOR
SYDNEY. SPOKE TO HIM AS HE PASSED THROUGH
BOURKE&mdash;CHATTERTON, OFFICER IN CHARGE POLICE, BOURKE.</p>

<br>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">WESTON had left the reporters' table, and was
bending over Rawlins' shoulder. For some minutes he spoke rapidly
and emphatically, the solicitor listening with a frown on his
face. At length the newspaper man's arguments prevailed. Rawlins
nodded slightly and sat up erect, watching the magistrate keenly.
Weston returned to his seat.</p>

<p>"What's up, Tony?" Lister bent towards his chum.</p>

<p>"This mustn't stop, Syd. I've just had a word with Rawlins.
He'll drive it through to the bitter end, now."</p>

<p>"The man doesn't know what he's saying?"</p>

<p>"That so?" Weston turned a grinning face towards his chum.
"Now, I believe every word he said. Shut up and listen."</p>

<p>The magistrate had been studying the telegram. He smoothed it
out carefully, and after a moment's thought handed it to the
clerk.</p>

<p>"You say you have not been in Australia for about eighteen
months?" asked the magistrate, gravely. "Yet the police of Bourke
are certain you were there, and spoke to you three weeks ago.
What is your answer to them?"</p>

<p>"It's a lie." Hawson spoke firmly, yet obviously exhausted by
his recent outbursts of rage.</p>

<p>"Very peculiar." Mr. Yessell removed his glasses and rubbed
the lenses carefully. "I am of the opinion the witness has sworn
untruly, whether wilfully, or by reason of some mental illness, I
am not prepared to state. Had not Mr. Hinde informed me he was
satisfied that the defendant was not responsible for his actions,
and that he was withdrawing the prosecution, I would have
remanded the defendant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it pleases your Worship." Rawlins rose to his feet. "You
will remember I was not satisfied to allow my client to make a
statement. I waived my objection in deference to the apparent
wishes of the Court. I now protest at the proceedings being
stopped until my client's statement is complete. I believe there
is an explanation to the apparent inconsistencies."</p>

<p>"You mean you will not agree to the Crown withdrawing the
prosecution." Mr. Yessell looked surprised. "I am afraid you have
not an&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would like to consider my position at the end of my
client's statement. I must ask you to look at the case as it now
stands. The Crown, after agreeing that my client is not in a
position to plead, now casts doubts on the defendant's
truthfulness in a manner that indicates he is committing
deliberate perjury; and in refutation of the statement produces a
telegram purporting to come from the officer in charge of police
at Bourke. In common fairness, I consider the statement should be
continued to see if further evidence will not explain the
inconsistency."</p>

<p>"Very well." The magistrate nodded to Mr. Hinde.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawson." Curtis Hinde rose with obvious reluctance to
continue his cross-examination. "You have denied that the
statement contained in the telegram from the police officer at
Bourke is correct. Will you state when you were last in
Melbourne?"</p>

<p>"About a week ago. When the <i>Arathusa</i> was in port."</p>

<p>"You were not there a fortnight ago?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you know this man?" Curtis Hinde turned to one of the side
benches and motioned to a police officer to stand up.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You were not talking to him on the morning of the day the
mail boat left Melbourne for Sydney?"</p>

<p>"No. I have never seen him before."</p>

<p>"You are prepared to swear you did not have a conversation
with him at the Central Police Station, Melbourne, a fortnight
ago?"</p>

<p>"No. I have told you I have never seen the man before."</p>

<p>"Do you remember losing a pocket book containing a large sum
of money while in Melbourne, and going to inform the police of
your loss."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And that, while at the Central Police Station, you detailed
your movements to this officer, informing him you had left
Myollongowera five days previous, arriving at Melbourne on the
previous day?"</p>

<p>"No, I was not in Melbourne during the time you mention. I
arrived there on the mail boat, and was only ashore for a few
hours."</p>

<p>There was so great a ring of truth in the man's voice that
Lister looked at Weston, in amazement. Was it possible that this
man was not Francis Delaney Hawson, who owned the string of
stations in the far west of the State? Something of this must
have occurred to Curtis Hinde.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawson. Do you own property in this State?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A station named Myollongowera, in the Bourke district, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and other stations thereabouts."</p>

<p>"You have not been near them for the past eighteen
months?"</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"Who manages them?"</p>

<p>"I have several managers, each in complete control of his
station. Then there is a general manager who resides at
Myollongowera."</p>

<p>"It would not be possible for anyone to impersonate you at
Myollongowera, say, for some weeks? I mean, there is no one you
are aware of who could impersonate you to the Sergeant of Police
at Bourke?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Now we will take the transferring from the mail boat to the
launch. Er&mdash;I believe it is now commonly referred to by the
name of the Phantom Launch. Let me see, Mr. Hawson. What is the
name at the launch?"</p>

<p>"It has no name."</p>

<p>"Who owns it?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You have a launch fit to go to sea and do not know where it
is, or its name?"</p>

<p>"It may be at one of several places. The boat was not built
when I went to America, so I could not possibly know the
name."</p>

<p>"You are aware that the police are in search of it? That a
warrant has been issued for the arrest of the boat and its
crew?"</p>

<p>"I have heard so."</p>

<p>"You will accept service of that warrant on behalf of the boat
and the crew?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what they have done. It's my boat."</p>

<p>"How did you come to have the Phantom Launch waiting to take
you off the mail boat outside the Heads? Did you wire from
Melbourne for the boat to meet you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did you know it would come out of the harbour to meet
you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What reason had you for leaving the mail boat for the launch,
when you had not ordered it to meet you?"</p>

<p>"I was called."</p>

<p>"You were called? What do you mean?" The magistrate had been
restless for some minutes, and broke in on the cross-examination
crossly.</p>

<p>"They called me."</p>

<p>"This is ridiculous." Mr. Yessell was now very angry. "I
believe the defendant is suffering from delusions, or
deliberately playing with the time of the Court. I am going to
remand him for seven days for medical observation."</p>

<p>"May I point out to your Worship that the defendant is very
well known and connected in the State, and owns considerable
property. I suggest that he be remanded on bail so that his own
medical attendants may have control of him." Rawlins spoke
softly, but for the first time he appeared to take some interest
in the case. "I will give any guarantee that the Crown medical
authorities have all reasonable access to him. The matter of bail
can be arranged to any amount."</p>

<p>"Has he friends in Court?" The magistrate looked round the
room curiously. "If he has, I shall be glad to have one of them
before me. Really, the defendant has induced a doubt in my mind
as to whether he is the person he purports to be."</p>

<p>An elderly man seated beside Mr. Rawlins rose to his feet and
bowed to the magistrate.</p>

<p>"I am willing to go bail for Mr. Francis Hawson," he said,
slowly. "My name is Archdale Staines, and I am a solicitor,
practising at Bourke, in this State."</p>

<p>"You know the defendant?"</p>

<p>"I know Mr. Hawson very intimately. I have known him all my
life, and I knew his uncle before him. I have been in charge of
the legal business of the Hawson estates for the past forty
years."</p>

<p>"When did you see Mr. Hawson last&mdash;I mean, before seeing him after the issue of the warrant?"</p>

<p>"I saw Mr. Hawson about three weeks ago. He came into my
office at Bourke. He was on his way to Melbourne. We had quite a
long conversation."</p>

<p>"You are not aware that Mr. Hawson has been in the United
States of America during the past eighteen months?" Mr. Yessell
asked the question with a quizzical glint in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am not." Archdale Staines smiled slightly. "If you will
accept my bail, sir, I will go surety to any amount, and hold my
client at the disposal of the Crown medical examiners. I&mdash;I
am afraid he is very ill."</p>

<p>The case ended. Hawson left the court between the two
solicitors. As they passed out of the building Lister and Weston
managed to get close to them. The journalist turned as if to
speak to the squatter, but Rawlins waved him to one side. Weston
ran down the steps before the small party, and turned to watch
them advance. Lister followed more slowly. He had hardly reached
his chum's side when he felt a slip of paper pressed into his
hand. He turned quickly, but there was no one about whom he could
suspect. He glanced down at the paper.</p>

<p>There was one line written on it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp"><i>Come to me.&mdash;A.C.</i></p><br> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">LISTER passed the note to Weston. The newspaper
man read it and then tore it in fragments. He was keenly watching
Hawson and his solicitors; they were standing on the edge of the
pavement in Liverpool street, waiting for a taxi to draw up.
Weston waited a moment, and then motioned Lister to remain where
he was. He stepped to the side of the Bourke solicitor, and spoke
a few words in a low voice. The man turned sharply and asked a
question. The journalist answered, a wry smile on his face. The
two solicitors conferred for a minute. Then, as a taxi-car drew
up to the pavement, Archdale Staines watched his companions
enter, and then turned and joined Weston.</p>

<p>"I am prepared to hear what you have to say, Mr. Weston," he
said, coldly. "The statement you have just made to me requires
some explanation."</p>

<p>"Shall we go down to your offices, or adjourn to a 'Cabin'
café-lounge. At this time of the day they are fairly free."</p>

<p>"The café, certainly." Staines looked round him. "I do not
possess a Sydney office, although there is no doubt but that Mr.
Rawlins would extend the courtesy of his offices to me."</p>

<p>There was a Cabin Café just round the corner in George Street,
and Weston led the way to it. When they were seated he turned to
the country solicitor.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Rawlins is your Sydney agent?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. My Sydney agents are Messrs. Brown, Atburn, and
Brown, of Hunter Street."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Weston conveyed a lot of meaning in his exclamation.
Staines looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"I quite understand, Mr. Weston." The old man smiled quietly.
"You consider it strange that, after my firm's long association
with the Hawson estates, Mr. Hawson should choose a stranger for
today's proceedings."</p>

<p>"Don't you think so, too, Mr. Staines?" Weston was engaged in
balancing his spoon on the edge of his cup.</p>

<p>"The ways of men are unfathomable." Archdale Staines smiled
again. "When you come to my age, Mr. Weston, there are many
things that will fail to surprise you. You said in the street
that a more serious charge was likely to be laid against Mr.
Hawson, and that you might possibly be able to assist him in
refuting it."</p>

<p>"I may." The journalist hesitated. "May I ask how you happened
to be at the hearing this morning?"</p>

<p>"Another matter passing strange," the old solicitor replied
meditatively. "Five days ago I received a telegram, unsigned, at
Bourke, stating that Mr. Hawson would be arrested for breaches of
the Customs regulations, and that my presence was necessary in
Sydney."</p>

<p>"Five days ago," exclaimed Lister. "I saw Mr. Hawson
yesterday, some hours before he was arrested."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you come down in deference to that telegram?" interrupted
Weston, quickly.</p>

<p>"I did not." Staines spoke drily. "I am not in the habit of
obeying the mandates of unsigned telegrams. The following day
came another telegram, requiring my presence in Sydney. I did not
connect the two telegrams, yet the second was a forgery."</p>

<p>"The supposition being that the sender of the first telegram,
understanding you were not taking action on it, forged a telegram
you would act on." Weston laughed. "Let me see. I suggest the
telegram was signed by Mr. William Brown, your agent."</p>

<p>"Your guess is correct." Staines looked slightly surprised. "I
do not understand the basis on which your deductions are made,
but&mdash;well, things have advanced since my days."</p>

<p>"You came to Sydney; found that no charge had been laid
against your client; discovered that Mr. Brown had not sent the
telegram; yet you remained in the city?"</p>

<p>"I heard of the charge of evading the Customs. I communicated
with the authorities. They informed me that a warrant was out for
the arrest of Mr. Hawson. I was in communication with them to
have the warrant changed to a summons, of which I could take
service, when they informed me that the police had located and
arrested Mr. Hawson. I went to see Mr. Hawson, and bailed him
out. The next day he informed me he had engaged Mr. Rawlins to
defend him. Now, Mr. Weston, I have given you what information I
have. You stated you had information for me."</p>

<p>For some minutes Weston sat, playing with his spoon. Suddenly
he looked up.</p>

<p>"Mr. Staines," he said, slowly. "I am going to ask you to
prepare for a great shock. This Customs prosecution is but the
beginning of the trouble facing your client. I have reason to
believe that within a few hours he will have to face a charge of
murder."</p>

<p>"Murder?" The old solicitor rose from his seat, holding the
edge of the table. "What, in God's name, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You have read of the Yaney's Inlet murder?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He could have nothing to do with that."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure. The murdered man bore the name of Gideah
Brading. Does that name convey nothing to you?"</p>

<p>"Gideah Brading?" The old solicitor blanched at the words. He
recovered himself quickly. "I remember the name and the case,
very well, Mr. Weston. It made a great sensation, some years
ago."</p>

<p>"Gideah Brading came out of gaol some eighteen months
ago."</p>

<p>"What connection could there be between Gideah Brading, of
Victoria, and Francis Hawson, of New South Wales?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure there is none?" Weston spoke quickly, leaning
forward over the marble-topped table. "Can you account for your
client throughout his life?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The old man spoke firmly. "I knew Matthew Hawson when
he was a young man building up a fine estate in the west. I knew
Francis Delaney when he was a boy, visiting his uncle.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Francis Delaney!" Lister uttered an exclamation. "His name is
now Hawson, then?"</p>

<p>"It is now. Matthew Hawson had no children. His wife died some
years before him, and he formally adopted as his heir Francis
Delaney, the son of his elder sister."</p>

<p>"Let me get this straight," interposed Weston. "Matthew Hawson
founded the Hawson estates. He had two sisters. The elder sister
had a son, Francis. Matthew Hawson adopted him, making him heir
to the estates. Had Mrs. Delaney other children? Had her sister
children?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to both questions." Staines mused for some minutes. "I
see the point of your question. In view of the peculiar
statements made by my client this morning you suggest that some
relative assumed his name and personality?"</p>

<p>"What else can we suppose?" The journalist looked perplexed.
"Francis Delaney Hawson was at Bourke three weeks ago. That is
certified to by the Sergeant of Police in the town. He
came&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me." Staines held up his hand. "I went further than
that in my statement to the magistrate. You will remember that I
informed the magistrate that Mr. Hawson called on me at my
offices in Bourke within a few minutes of Sergeant Chatterton
seeing him in the town."</p>

<p>"Yet Mr. Hawson claimed, under oath, that he had been in the
United States of America during the past eighteen months, and had
not visited Australia during that period." Weston spoke,
emphatically. "Are we to assume that Mr. Hawson was deliberately
trying to deceive the magistrate?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid&mdash;" Staines stopped suddenly, and changed his
tone. "Mr. Weston, you are asking for evidence against my
client."</p>

<p>"I am asking you to face facts," Weston declared, "You've got
to look at them, or your client stands facing a charge of murder,
with every chance of being committed for trial. I'm not going to
conceal anything from you, Mr. Staines. If Mr. Lister and I go to
the police with the information in our possession&mdash;and that,
after the admissions made by your client in the witness box this
morning&mdash;the case looks black against him."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawson acknowledged he was the owner of the Phantom
Launch&mdash;the boat that took him from the <i>Arathusa</i>. Mr.
Lister and I, investigating the mystery surrounding the death of
the man Gideah Brading at Yaney's Inlet, have certain information
not yet conveyed to the police. That evidence will definitely
link the Phantom Launch crew with the murder. You will remember,
from what has been published, that the Phantom Launch was seen
from Middle Head a few hours before the murder was committed. It
was outside the Heads until long after the time of the murder. It
then re-entered the harbour, and for some hours was bottled up in
Middle Harbour. Then there is the acknowledged fact that the
Phantom Launch took Mr. Hawson off the Arathusa and disappeared
for some hours. Outside matters show that there is more than a
probability that the Phantom Launch went to Yaney's Inlet during
that time. Certain property of the Phantom Launch is buried at
Yaney's Inlet. A letter in the possession of Gideah Brading links
that property with the Phantom Launch, and gave a motive for the
murder."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Staines sat bewildered, looking from one to
the other of the men facing him. "Still, your evidence is only
presumptive. You have to establish a link between Gideah Brading
and Francis Hawson."</p>

<p>"An investigation of the Pettington frauds might do that, Mr.
Staines."</p>

<p>"The Pettington frauds?"</p>

<p>"You have acknowledged that you are aware of the life of
Gideah Brading. You are then aware that he was a confederate of
Wallace Pettington. The motive of the murder was to do away with
blackmail. We discovered a large sum of money in Brading's swag.
We further found a letter stating where further large sums of
money would be found. That letter indicates blackmail. We found
the money. Couple that with the visit of the Phantom Launch to
Yaney's Inlet at a time when Mr. Hawson was presumably on board,
and your client has to face a fairly constructive case."</p>

<p>"That letter?" Staines leaned forward, eagerly.</p>

<p>"The letter is in the hands of the police," answered Weston.
"I kept a copy of it."</p>

<p>The journalist took out his pocket book and extracted the
scribbled copy of the letter found in the dead man's swag.
Staines read it at a glance, and turned to face the newspaper
man, his face white and set.</p>

<p>"You say you found the money?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What was the amount?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds, in hundred-pound notes."</p>

<p>Archdale Staines sat thoughtfully silent for some minutes.
Then he turned to the journalist.</p>

<p>"The Hawson estates have banking accounts in Sydney,
Melbourne, and Bourke," he said, slowly. "Just after Mr. Hawson
left Bourke I was surprised to hear that he had withdrawn the sum
of five hundred pounds from the local bank&mdash;in hundred-pound
notes."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a long silence following Archdale
Staines' admission that Francis Hawson had, three weeks
previously, drawn a large sum of money from the Bourke bank.
Lister was frowning thoughtfully, and drawing an intricate
diagram on the marble top of the table. Weston fidgeted uneasily
in his chair.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask you gentlemen to keep counsel for a time,"
said Archdale Staines, after a long pause. "You will realise that
there is no possibility of Francis Hawson getting away from
Sydney. The police and the magistrate are convinced that he is
not responsible for his actions. He will be carefully watched. I
understand you will continue your investigations on behalf of
your newspaper. At the present time your evidence is not
conclusive. It might be sufficient to warrant the arrest of a
free man, but Mr. Hawson is not free, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old solicitor hesitated. Weston looked up and nodded.
Staines rose from his chair and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"It looks bad, Mr. Staines," the newspaper man said,
haltingly. "As you say, the evidence we possess is not
conclusive. Before you go, will you tell us what you know of the
Phantom Launch?"</p>

<p>"There is little I can tell you." Staines stood upright
against the table. "Francis Hawson is interested in mechanics:
but he is not an inventor. The one clue I can give you is that
Mostyn Delaney&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand," exclaimed Weston impulsively. "Mostyn Delaney.
I was trying to connect the name. Mostyn Delaney is one of the
finest electrical experts in Australia."</p>

<p>Archdale Staines did not answer. He shook hands with the two
men and walked out of the café, leaning heavily on his stick.
Weston looked after him with sympathy in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor old man. The last of the race of old family solicitors
in Australia. They were a good race of men, Syd, caring muchly
for the welfare of the families they served. It will break the
old man's heart if we uncover tracks leading to the Hawson
family, and there is more than a likelihood of that."</p>

<p>Lister nodded and led the way out of the café. On the pavement
he turned to his chum.</p>

<p>"What's doing?"</p>

<p>"You're for Austin Chosen, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And you?"</p>

<p>"Free for the time. Say, Syd, what about my running down to
Yaney's Inlet and getting hold of that box?"</p>

<p>Lister walked along in silence for some yards. He was
frightened at the boxes hidden in the sands around the city. They
puzzled him, for he recognised in them some sinister activity he
could, at present, only glimpse. He pulled the pair of rubber
gloves out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"Have a go if you care to, old man, but for heaven's sake, be
careful. Put on these gloves before you start to meddle with it,
and when you find it, don't allow any metal near it, and don't
touch it with your naked flesh. You saw what happened last
night?"</p>

<p>"You've some theory about the boxes?"</p>

<p>"Just a theory, and that so wild and impossible that I dare
not mention it, even to you. Use the gloves, and don't touch the
notes, if they are still at the bottom of the box. Put everything
back again before you leave, and don't leave footmarks
about."</p>

<p>"Any more 'dont's?'" laughed the journalist.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Lister swung him round to face him on the
pavement. The expert's face was pale and grave, and he spoke with
great emphasis.</p>

<p>"Don't go there in any light spirit, Tony. There's big danger;
danger I can only guess at. I'm not joking, old man. The moment
you start to grope in that darned box your life's in the balance.
I wouldn't insure you for five pence, if you paid a premium of
four pence."</p>

<p>He stood on the road and watched Weston wave him from the
tram. For some time after it passed from sight in the traffic the
expert continued to stare after it. At last he shook himself
together and walked down to Millington Chambers. At the first
ring of the bell the door opened, and Lou Sing bowed before
him.</p>

<p>Austin Chosen was asleep, so Ysobel Weston informed, when he
entered her office. She sat before a typewriter working through a
long report. Lister sat and watched her for some time, in
silence. He was trying to understand this girl. At length, she
completed her task and went back to her desk beside the window
and sat, looking at him.</p>

<p>"What is the call-signal of your wireless, Miss Weston?" The
expert asked the question abruptly.</p>

<p>"My call-signal, Mr. Lister?" The girl coloured slightly,
"Tony has a five-valve set at home, but we have not a
transmitting set."</p>

<p>"Then you spoke from here last night?" quickly retorted
Lister.</p>

<p>"From here? I don't understand, Mr. Lister."</p>

<p>"Tony was in my workshop last night when I called Mr. Austin
Chosen." Lister spoke in even, slow tones. "When Mr. Chosen cut
out we tried to get in touch with 'Silver Swan,' and were
successful."</p>

<p>"You got 'Silver Swan?'" The girl's face became strangely
white, and she played nervously with the articles on the
desk.</p>

<p>"Where is Pirates' Bay?" asked Lister in the same level
voice.</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;understand."</p>

<p>"Miss Weston, Tony recognised your voice. There is not a
shadow of a doubt. 'Silver Swan' is the Phantom Launch, and some
arrangement was made over the air for Pirates' Bay. The voice was
yours."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lister there?" The voice floated into the room, a hint of
petulance in the tone "Send him in. He has been long in
coming."</p>

<p>Without replying to Lister's deliberate accusation, Ysobel
rose from her chair and opened the door leading into the Mystery
Man's private room. As he passed her he caught a fleeting,
enigmatic smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"So you've come at last." Austin Chosen rolled over on his
couch and looked at the expert. His fingers played restlessly
over the controls on the big switchboard. For the moment the room
was brilliantly illuminated, and then the accustomed gloom
shrouded it and its occupant. "I expected you to come here
directly the Court case finished."</p>

<p>"You wanted me to report the case for you?" asked Lister,
curiously. "I'm sorry. If you had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I had wanted you to report the case I would have said so?"
snapped the Mystery Man, crossly. "When you came in Miss Weston
was typing the report&mdash;a verbatim report I had made for
me."</p>

<p>"Has she a report of the conversation Tony Weston and I had
with Archdale Staines, after the Court case finished," asked
Lister, half angrily.</p>

<p>"Archdale Staines." There was almost a softness in the man's
voice as he uttered the name. "Archdale Staines. One of the best
of men. A gentleman, and yet a servant of those who trust him.
His sins be many, yet let them be forgiven to him. What had he to
say?"</p>

<p>Lister briefly recounted the heads of the interview in the
Cabin Café. Austin Chosen listened, intently. At the end of the
recital he turned his face to the wall and lay silent for some
minutes.</p>

<p>"Poor Archdale," he muttered. "It will break the old man's
heart if Francis Delaney is convicted of the murder of Gideah
Brading. His whole life is bound up in the service and integrity
of the families he serves. Yet&mdash;yet. I cannot
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You knew Francis Delaney Hawson before he came here?"</p>

<p>"I have known Francis Delaney all his life." Austin Chosen
spoke thoughtfully. "A weak man, Sydney Lister, and a man with
little but evil in him. I had thought to have sent you to Bourke
to see Archdale Staines, but he came down&mdash;he came
down."</p>

<p>"In answer to your telegrams?" Lister could not resist the
thrust.</p>

<p>Austin Chosen moved his head towards Lister, and switched on
the light again. This time he did not turn it off, but lay
looking thoughtfully at the expert.</p>

<p>"I was right," he murmured. "Yes, Sydney Lister, I did
telegraph to Archdale Staines to come to Sydney. That you have
penetrated that much gives me hope my faith in you will be
justified."</p>

<p>"Why not have telegraphed in your own name?"</p>

<p>"Because I did not wish Archdale Staines to come and see me."
The answer came quickly. "Had he come here all our work would
have collapsed. He serves faithfully."</p>

<p>"Mr. Chosen." Lister rose from his chair and paced
thoughtfully up and down the room. "Are you acting squarely in
this matter? I am not going to profess that you do not understand
me. I have not the slightest doubt but that you are aware of what
I said to Miss Weston a few minutes ago. I can only come to one
of two conclusions. Either you know more than you are willing to
admit of the mystery surrounding the death of Gideah Brading, and
the speed boat we call the Phantom Launch, or you are in the
confidence of&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lister hesitated. He had meant to ask the Mystery Man for his
full confidence, and had drifted into a direct accusation of
complicity in the criminal acts of the crew of the Phantom
Launch. The man on the couch laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"You are accusing me of being hand in hand with the gang who
work the Phantom Launch," he said. "Well, I'm not. I shall not
deny I suspect much that you have little knowledge of. I shall
not deny that I could place my hands on the man who killed Gideah
Brading. But, today, I have no evidence. That is for you to
obtain, Sydney Lister, and it is my brain that shall guide you to
it."</p>

<p>"What of Ysobel Weston and the Silver Swan?" Lister asked the
question boldly.</p>

<p>"Leave the girl out of it." Austin Chosen spoke quickly. "I
know what you mean, but you have only a suspicion to go on. If it
was Ysobel Weston's voice, then my brain directed that voice. She
has her work, and does it well. Leave her alone, I say. Your task
is the greater, and you have yet to accomplish it."</p>

<p>For the moment the expert was inclined to turn and leave the
room. Austin Chosen had adopted a tone of insufferable
superiority. Something of this must have shown in his face, for
the Mystery Man turned to the switchboard and threw in a couple
of switches. Immediately a dark slide slipped over the window,
shutting out the remaining light. At the same time a brilliant
beam of light came from high up on the wall, over the couch, and
glowed on a silver sheet, revealed on the opposite wall.</p>

<p>For some seconds the light held steady; a vivid circle of
brilliant whiteness. Then, within the circle, came a picture of
the room in which Lister sat. The room was shrouded in darkness,
through which, dimly, could be seen the form of the Mystery Man
lying on his couch beneath the big switchboard. For twenty
seconds the picture was still; then it began to flicker, and came
to life.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Lister saw his pictured self enter the
room. He saw the sudden burst of light with which Austin Chosen
had flooded him on his first visit. He saw himself walk towards
the couch&mdash;and disappear.</p>

<p>Again the door of the room opened, and into the picture
stepped Francis Hawson. Again the scene he had witnessed in the
mirror on Ysobel's desk was re-acted. The picture faded, to be
replaced by an outdoor scene.</p>

<p>It was a street of some country town. The long line of low,
single-storied buildings, the sky-line broken on occasions by two
and three story buildings. Men were moving about, some
listlessly, others with energy and speed. Occasional carts and
motor-cars came and went.</p>

<p>The camera was fronting a well-built brick building, with the
name of a bank in gilt letters on each of the two large windows.
A pair of swing doors moved as the customers passed in and out.
Two men came out of the door. One man was Archdale Staines, the
solicitor, and the other Francis Hawson. For a few moments they
stood talking. Then Francis Hawson crossed to where a large car
waited in the sun. The solicitor turned and walked up the
street.</p>

<p>The camera followed Francis Hawson as he stopped to speak to
some acquaintance. A changed man from the shrinking, fearful
coward who had stood in the witness box at the Central Police
Court that day. In his home town he stood bold and arrogant,
asserting his will with a consciousness of the power placed in
his hands by the wealth he had inherited.</p>

<p>"Two Francis Delaneys," murmured the Mystery Man. "You have
seen both. Can you read the riddle, Sydney Lister?"</p>

<p>A new picture quivered on the silver screen. Lister recognised
one of the long reaches of the Parramatta River. A power-boat was
coming down towards the camera, travelling at a high rate of
speed. Suddenly, a small speck of white appeared in the far
distance. It resolved itself into a curling mass of foam, growing
larger and larger as it approached the camera with almost
incredible speed. Rapidly it overhauled the power-boat and
resolved into a large hydroplane. The camera swung with the
passing boats, revealing the queer lines of the speed-launch
travelling in a maze of swirling waters. The 'plane glistened
brightly in the strong sunlight, tinted a brilliant, iridescent
red.</p>

<p>"The <i>Water Witch!</i>" The exclamation burst from Lister's
lips in uncontrollable amazement. Once before he had seen that
marvellous engine of speed on Sydney waterways.</p>

<p>"The <i>Water Witch</i>." The Mystery Man echoed the words of
the expert. "Mostyn Delaney's <i>Water Witch</i>, the fastest
thing afloat in the Seven Seas. Can you read the riddle of the
screen, Sydney Lister?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">"THE Water Witch!" Lister remembered the
wonderful boat Mostyn Delaney had built and exhibited some years
previous, on Sydney Harbour. A boat of incredible speed, but
useless, except for small distance racing. A boat that could
outpace any known craft in the world, but at the end of a bare
mile floated uselessly on the waters, its energy exhausted.</p>

<p>The hydroplane had been acclaimed a marvel of engineering, but
a freak, for it could not sustain its enormous initial burst of
speed. The fault lay with the accumulators. They could not carry
the amount of energy necessary for distances. Delaney had worked
on her incessantly, confident that one day he would find the
ideal, inexhaustible accumulator that would give his treasured
invention the radius of the seas. He had worked&mdash;and,
apparently, failed. Gradually popular enthusiasm had faded in the
work, with the failure of the Inventor to fulfil the promises of
success he had insisted on making. He and his Water Witch had
dropped out of sight.</p>

<p>Yet Mostyn Delaney, or some successor at the work, had
succeeded and created the Phantom Launch, a boat that contained
all the speed of the <i>Water Witch</i> with the power of holding
the seas for long lengths of time. More than probable the
<i>Water Witch</i> lay in some boatshed near Sydney, dismantled
and rotting. The Phantom Launch rode the seas around Sydney, a
fugitive from justice.</p>

<p>Austin Chosen had placed in Sydney Lister's hands the clue he
required to trace down the Phantom Launch. Mostyn Delaney had
conceived the Water Witch. Only the genius of Mostyn Delaney
could evolve the Phantom Launch. Many pieces of the puzzle were
missing; many slender clues had to be gathered together before
the Phantom Launch could be linked with the <i>Water Witch</i>
and the wooden boxes hidden in the sands around Sydney waterways.
One thing had been gained. The road lay open to be explored.
There might be many twists and turns; often the trail might have
to be uncovered from under the debris of years; but somewhere at
the end of that road lay the solution of all the mysteries with
which they were surrounded.</p>

<p>"Where is Mostyn Delaney?" Lister swung round on the man lying
on the couch under the big switchboard.</p>

<p>"The <i>Water Witch</i> broke Mostyn Delaney's heart." Austin
Chosen rolled restlessly on his couch. "He lives, I believe; he
lives and works. Do you remember, Sydney Lister, that Mostyn
Delaney never succeeded in any of his inventions. Always he
showed the way, but another harvested. The Water Witch showed a
new thought; did another reap?"</p>

<p>Lister turned abruptly on his heel and left the room. He must
find Mostyn Delaney. Somewhere the man lived and worked. Once
face to face with the electrical genius he would learn the
secret endowing the Phantom Launch with her wonderful vitality.
With that secret he would be able to hunt the boat down and
capture it. The Phantom Launch in his hands, the solutions of the
many problems would be near.</p>

<p>Francis Delaney, the brother of Mostyn Delaney; Francis
Delaney, cringing and fearful, swearing away his own liberty in
frenzied terror: Francis Delaney, arrogant and domineering, the
small king of a country town. Was Francis Delaney the one-time
Wallace Pettington? If so, then, indeed, the end was in
sight.</p>

<p>Lister tried to picture the life of the squatter. Had it
happened he had tired of the quiet life of the bush and gone to
Melbourne determined to hew out success for himself? Had he
entered the business world visioning a new countryside,
progressive and wealthy? The ideals that had possessed Wallace
Pettington seemed to be the dreams that would occur to a man
brought up in intimate association with the land. Had Francis
Delaney dreamed a dream, and under the assumed name of Wallace
Pettington, thought to clothe it with living flesh?</p>

<p>What demon, in the heyday of his success, his companies
booming, the public his obedient servants, had possessed the man
to cast down that which he had built.</p>

<p>Francis Delaney, alias Wallace Pettington, had found himself
the guiding spirit of a new country, progressing fast towards a
golden era. Then had come the news that he had inherited, in
another State, large acres of lands. They were his to do what he
would with. The lands he ruled through his companies belonged to
the shareholders. Had he been tempted to destroy in the
certainty he could rebuild for himself that which he had built
for others?</p>

<p>If the master criminal had reasoned thus, then he had found
one flaw in his plans. Simon Eccles had discovered his
intentions. Perhaps it had been necessary for Wallace Pettington
to confide in the speculator. Simon Eccles had forced Pettington
to release him from gaol. Pettington had thought it mattered
little. He could hide Simon Eccles with himself, and go on with
his plans of land-empire.</p>

<p>Then had come Gideah Brading, perhaps the least of the rogues.
Brading had served his sentence and had been released. Some
chance had led Brading to the hiding-place of his former
associates. He had demanded his reward. It had been given,
grudgingly. The man had grown arrogant with power. Of the three,
he alone did not fear the law. He had repaid, through the long
years of prison discipline. His demands had increased, coupled
with menaces that he could walk free while they feared the shadow
of a prison. In the last desperation it had been decided that
Gideah Brading must die.</p>

<p>Thus far the puzzle was simple. The Phantom Launch complicated
the mystery. It was impossible to believe the only use the rogues
had made of the Phantom Launch was to lure Gideah Brading to his
death. Somewhere there existed a definite reason for the speed
launch.</p>

<p>Wallace Pettington had shown himself greedy and unscrupulous.
Heir to a large and wealthy estate, he had coveted the wealth he
had created through the Pettington companies. He could have
withdrawn from the companies with reasonable security and reward,
but he wanted all. To satisfy his desires he had allied himself
with rogues, and deliberately wrecked that which he had
created.</p>

<p>Lister was not satisfied with the theory he had erected. It
held large, vacant spaces. For strength it depended on the
association of Gideah Brading with Wallace Pettington, and the
kinship of Francis and Mostyn Delaney. It pivoted on the
assumption that Francis Delaney was Wallace Pettington. Even with
those points conceded it did not explain the activities of the
Phantom Launch.</p>

<p>One clue connected Francis Delaney with the Phantom Launch.
Archdale Staines had declared that Francis Hawson had been
interested in mechanics. Was it possible the squatter had
financed Mostyn Delaney to success. Francis Hawson had gone
abroad. Had Mostyn Delaney during that absence discovered the
secret of the Phantom Launch, and built the boat? Had Mostyn
Delaney written to his brother of his success, and had Mostyn
Delaney, by some freak of his worn brain, staged the transhipment
from the mail boat as proof of his success?</p>

<p>The theory was possible, but against it stood two impregnable
witnesses. The officer in charge of police at Bourke and Archdale
Staines were positive that Francis Hawson had been in Bourke
within three weeks prior to the arrival of the <i>Arathusa</i> at
Melbourne. They insisted that Francis Hawson had left Bourke to
journey to Melbourne. A Melbourne police officer was prepared to
testify that Francis Hawson was in the Victorian capital a
fortnight before the mail boat reached that city. Had Curtis
Hinde, the Crown Law official, been correct when he suggested
that Francis Hawson had journeyed to Melbourne to join the mail
boat? Against that could be placed the sworn evidence of the
captain of the ship and his officers, that Francis Hawson had
travelled on the boat from England to Australia.</p>

<p>Lister awoke from the reverie he had fallen into and found he
had wandered up to Hyde Park. He crossed the green and walked
down to Phillip Street, to call for Tony Weston. He found the
journalist had not yet returned from Como. He had had barely time
to accomplish the journey, make a proper examination of the
wooden box, and return. The expert left the newspaper offices and
walked to his club. There he dined and loitered about the rooms
for some time.</p>

<p>A fit of restlessness possessed him. Leaving the club, he
crossed to Balmoral. Ah Sam was busy in the kitchen. Lister
nodded briefly as he crossed to the wireless room.</p>

<p>The evening programmes were on the air. Lister tried from one
to the other, and then switched on to the big commercial
stations. They were engaged in the usual heavy evening traffic.
Idly the expert ran through the wave-lengths, searching for
something among the wireless amateurs that would interest and
distract his attention.</p>

<p>"Pirates' Bay." The words came to his mind suddenly. Where had
he heard them. They had come over the air the previous evening.
The girl had spoken them. Was she Ysobel Weston? Lister
remembered that she had evaded an answer to his questions that
day in Austin Chosen's offices. The Mystery Man had declared that
the girl was accomplishing her tasks well and faithfully. He had
warned him not to worry, or even consider, her.</p>

<p>Where was Tony Weston? He should have returned from Como by
this time. There was an implied promise to ring up and report his
discoveries anent the wooden box. Lister left the wireless room
and went into the house. A call to the <i>Pictorial</i> offices
resulted in the answer that nothing had been seen of Weston since
early in the day. Lister asked to be informed immediately the
journalist returned.</p>

<p>Weston might be at home. A search of the directory gave
Weston's telephone number, at Balmoral. Lister put through an
inquiry. Ysobel answered the call. Tony had not arrived home.</p>

<p>Quieting the girl's rising anxiety with the promise that he
had to get into touch with Tony immediately, Lister rang off and
stood beside the instrument, undecided how to act. He was blaming
himself for allowing the journalist to go to Como alone. The
boxes were dangerous, and Weston had but the most elementary
knowledge of electrical science.</p>

<p>The trill of the telephone bell aroused him from his
thoughts. Theodore Parker, the chief of staff at the
<i>Pictorial</i> newspaper, was on the line. Lister's inquiry for
Weston had been taken to him. Parker was worried. Weston should
have reported back at the newspaper offices long since. Did
Lister know where he had gone after leaving the court?</p>

<p>Weston's absence was getting serious. In a few words Lister
advised Parker of the position, and promised to run down to
Yaney's Inlet to discover if any mishap had occurred to the
journalist. Then he put through a call to a city garage to have a
fast car waiting for him at Circular Quay.</p>

<p>Almost at the street door Lister turned back. There was
another avenue of inquiry he had not touched. He turned back to
his wireless room and put through a call to Haslington, the
wireless amateur at Sutherland. There occurred a long wait while
the man telephoned to the police station.</p>

<p>"Lister?" The voice rang out of the air. "Yes. Weston was at
the Sutherland Police Station this afternoon. He said he was
going to the Inlet, and promised to telephone Inspector Mack from
the Como Police Station. He did not do so. Any trouble?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="first">ANTHONY WESTON had disappeared. Was he to be
added to the list of those who had perished at Yaney's Inlet? He
had left town early in the afternoon, and should have returned
between six and seven in the evening. That he had failed to do so
was disquieting.</p>

<p>"Communicate Inspector Mack, if you please, Mr. Haslington.
Tell him I am coming to Como right away. Will he please meet me
at Yaney's Inlet? Have vicinity of Inlet guarded by men hidden in
the bush. Warn everyone not to touch anything unusual near bluff.
I have reason to believe there is something extremely dangerous
hidden there. Thanks, very much. I would not have troubled you,
but the matter is urgent."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Lister boarded the ferry and went to
Circular Quay. A fast motor-car was waiting for him. There was
little traffic in the city at that lime of night, and soon they
were tearing down Prince's Highway at top speed.</p>

<p>At Tom Ugly's punt they were met by Inspector Mack, who had
driven up from Sutherland to meet them. The Inspector took them
by a cross-country journey to the Inlet. At the clearing above
the beach a constable came out of the bush and reported the
vicinity quiet. At the bluff they found Constable Williams, of
Como, seated in the dark shadows, his hands clasped round his
knees. He rose to his feet as they approached.</p>

<p>"Not a sign of Mr. Weston," he reported, briefly. "I had a
look round, and went as far as the old man's camp, but there
wasn't a sign of him."</p>

<p>Lister looked to where the box lay hidden under the sands. The
place had not been disturbed. Had Tony Weston been to the bluff,
or had he been abducted on his way there from the Sutherland
Police Station? The expert could hardly believe that, although
Mitchell, the <i>Pictorial's</i> correspondent, had disappeared
just as mysteriously. The men they were fighting were not fools;
they would only take the aggressive when their liberty and lives
were threatened.</p>

<p>For some minutes Lister examined the sands in the vicinity of
the bluff. He would recognise Weston's footprints; the journalist
had on a pair of shoes with rubber heels. Lister had noticed them
in court that morning. He traced the footmarks of the constable
and followed where he had walked round the bluff, and returned to
the place where they found him sitting; but of Weston's shoes
there was not a mark. Weston had not been down on the sands of
the inlet, or, if he had been there, his footprints had been
carefully obliterated.</p>

<p>Should he uncover the box? If he did so, he would have to take
the Inspector and the constable into his confidence. Would they
allow him to order things to his wishes? He did not want the box
tampered with. So long as it lay under the sands, apparently
unknown to everyone but the men who buried it, the box was a firm
clue leading to the Phantom Launch. Sooner or later the crew of
the vessel would come to the Inlet to work on the box. Then would
occur the opportunity to surprise them and capture the
launch.</p>

<p>Inspector Mack might consider the box vital evidence in the
mystery surrounding the death of Gideah Brading. He might want to
take it to Sutherland and have it examined by experts. News of
the strange box would get into the newspapers and warn the men of
the Phantom Launch. Yet, without knowing if the box had been
tampered with, without knowing if the box held any part in the
disappearance of Anthony Weston, he did not know how to act. Had
Weston been down to the bluff that day? If so, in what direction
had he gone?</p>

<p>Weston had come from Sydney in his car, but there was no sign
of the car about the Inlet. There were no tracks on the long dirt
road that led to the edge of the clearing above the beach. None
of the constables had seen the car, or they would have reported
its presence.</p>

<p>"I SUPPOSE you're here officially."</p>

<p>Lister turned to the Inspector, abruptly. "I'm not
complaining. Inspector, but I would like to know if my actions
are to be matter for an official report?"</p>

<p>"Rather a queer question, Mr. Lister." The keen, grey eyes of
the police officer twinkled slightly as he turned to face the
expert. "Just how far do you want to be outside official notice.
You must remember you have called in the police to search for Mr.
Weston."</p>

<p>"I want to be outside official observation regarding matters
that do not affect the welfare of Mr. Weston. Look here,
Inspector." Lister spoke impulsively. "Mr. Weston, Mr. Austin
Chosen, and I, are together in the search for the Phantom Launch.
We have discovered certain things we think at the present time
should be kept entirely within our own knowledge. I have not the
slightest objection to Robert Mack knowing of them, but I don't
want them the matter of an official report to headquarters for
the time."</p>

<p>"I have a certain discretion." The Inspector spoke
thoughtfully. "How far do you want me to shut my eyes?"</p>

<p>"Would you have shut them to Gideah Brading's swag if by so
doing you thought you could bring the murderer to justice?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The officer hesitated. "You are implying there is
something hidden around here I do not know of? I'm beginning to
understand Mr. Weston's tip to have the bluff watched, night and
day."</p>

<p>Lister jumped up the low bank and brought a sapling from the
bush. Peeling and sharpening the thin end, he walked to where he
guessed the box to be hidden, and thrust it into the sands.</p>

<p>"You've heard of the box hidden at the foot of the cliff at
Myella Cove&mdash;the box hidden by the men from the Phantom
Launch?" The officer nodded assent. "Well, Weston and I found
another of the boxes hidden here the other day."</p>

<p>"Perhaps this one vanished like that one did?"</p>

<p>"The Myella Cove box has not vanished." Lister laughed
slightly. "All that happened was that Constable Phelps was
watched, and his marks on the cliff face altered. When he went to
get the box he was digging in a new place."</p>

<p>"Jove!" The Inspector broke into a broad grin. "And you found
it later. Well, well!"</p>

<p>He watched the expert go over the ground, driving the pointed
stick into the sand at regular intervals around a certain spot.
At last the stick shivered in Lister's hands. Immediately the
three men went on their knees and dragged out the sands with
their hands. A few minutes and they had the lid of the box
uncovered. Lister delved down one side of the box, and found the
rope handle. He tried to draw the box to the surface, but it was
firmly fixed.</p>

<p>"What's holding it?" The Inspector spoke angrily. "Wonder if
we can burrow under it and find out what's got it anchored."</p>

<p>He commenced to work feverishly down the side of the box.
Lister caught him by the arm, restrainingly.</p>

<p>"Have a care, Inspector. I sent you a message to be careful
around the bluff. This is what I meant. First, we'll have a look
at the inside."</p>

<p>The lock gave way under the urge of the master key. Lister
raised the lid, and the three men peered inside. The interior was
empty, save for the banknotes pinned to the wood at the
bottom.</p>

<p>"What the devil!" The Inspector reached for the banknotes.
Again Lister held him back.</p>

<p>"Leave them there, Mack. They make good bait. If you have a
man watching the bluff from under cover, those notes may prove
the lure that will induce Gideah Brading's murderer to walk into
your hands."</p>

<p>"So, that's the game!" The Inspector sat back on his haunches.
"This box was like it is now when you and Mr. Weston discovered
it?"</p>

<p>"Except that it was free, and we were able to haul it to the
surface&mdash;yes," replied Lister. "I'm speculating a bit on
these boxes and the notes. It's possible that more than one of
the crew of the Phantom Launch has knowledge of them. Cupidity
may bring one of them to recover the notes. Then your men will
capture him, and pave the way for a full revelation of the
mystery of the Phantom Launch. That is what Tony Weston and I
were waiting for, before we told you of the box."</p>

<p>"If anyone gets within five yards of that box without a talk
with the police, I'll eat the box and all it contains." The
Inspector spoke emphatically. "It's a good idea, Mr. Lister,
although I'm sore you and Mr. Weston did not explain matters to
me. That box is going to be guarded like the strong-room of the
Commonwealth Bank."</p>

<p>"Good!" Lister lowered the lid of the box and locked it.
"Don't let anyone monkey with that box, Mack. I nearly lost my
sight tampering with the one in Myella Cove. Perhaps in a few
days I shall solve its mysteries, and then we can handle it
safely."</p>

<p>"But it's empty?" objected the officer.</p>

<p>"So far as we can see. I'm not willing to talk, at present;
but I will say that, if any person ignorant of the secret of that
box handled it carelessly, he is in great danger of his life.
He'd better play with a charge of dynamite."</p>

<p>"I'll send for you to take it out of the sands." Inspector
Mack smiled grimly. He turned to the constable. "You've heard Mr.
Lister talk, Williams. Keep it under your hat. Anyone who tampers
with the sands round here is asking for a personal interview with
me at Sutherland. Get me?"</p>

<p>The constable looked up from scooping the sand over the box,
and nodded. His face wore a very serious expression.</p>

<p>"Think Gideah Brading went that way, Mr. Lister?" Williams
asked the question in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I can't believe so." Lister looked perplexed.
"If Brading went that way, who scooped the sand back over the
box?"</p>

<p>"Scooped the sand back over the box?" The inspector repeated
the words.</p>

<p>"Remember the wording of the letter found in Gideah Brading's
swag." Lister spoke impressively. "He was to find the final
payment in a place he knew of. There's five hundred pounds in
this box. Is the box the hiding-place mentioned? Are the notes
pinned to the bottom of the box the 'final payment'? Accept 'yes'
as the answer to both questions, and attempt to reconstruct the
crime. Brading gets the letter. He comes in search of the money.
He opens the locked box, and sees the notes, pinned to the
bottom. He goes to draw out the pins, and falls dead. Who closed
and locked the box? Who covered the sand over the box?"</p>

<p>"Struth!" Williams passed his hand over his eyes. "That's a
puzzle."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Mr. Lister?" Inspector Mack asked the
question, as Lister started to round the bluff.</p>

<p>"To the old man's camp. If Weston came here he found the box
as we found it. Yet there are no signs that he came the track we
followed. I looked on the dirt road for his tyre marks, and could
not see them. I looked on the sands for the prints of his
rubber-heeled shoes, and could not find them. He may have found
another track that led him to the old man's camp without passing
the bluff."</p>

<p>"There is another track." Williams spoke suddenly. "It leads
past the Old House, and within a hundred yards of the camp. More
than probable Mr. Weston found it and parked his car on it."</p>

<p>Lister turned suddenly to the man.</p>

<p>"Can you pick it up in the night, Williams? Lead over to the
camp, and then, if there's nothing there we'll go on this road
you speak of. What's the name of the place&mdash;the Old
House?"</p>

<p>Williams had some little difficulty in locating the camp under
the wan moonlight. Luckily the three men had pocket torches and
immediately on arriving at the camp started a search for clues.
At first sight the place looked as if no one had visited it since
Lister and Weston had been there. At one place the expert thought
he detected a faint footprint, but could not be certain.
Presently he called to the officers.</p>

<p>"Nothing here," grumbled Mack. "Shall we go over to the Old
House?"</p>

<p>Lister assented, and they started to move cautiously through
the thick bush, Williams in the lead. For about a hundred yards
they stumbled between the trees. They came out, then, on an old
bush-road. On the soft sand, at the edge of the road, Lister's
torch picked out the firm outline of a rubber-heeled shoe.</p>

<p>"Look, Mack," Lister focused his light on the mark. "Weston
came past here. He was wearing rubber heels. That print was
certainly made by his shoe. Now I understand-"</p>

<p>"What?" Inspector Mack looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Weston's a good bushman." Lister laughed, in partial relief.
"I noticed there were a lot of leaves around Brading's old camp,
Weston was there, right enough. Before he left, he brushed out
his footprints and scattered leaves over the places where he
walked."</p>

<p>"What's that up the road?" Williams was peering towards the
Inlet. On the side of the road, well up against the bush, showed
a dark object. Lister was the first to reach it. It was Weston's
motor-car&mdash;abandoned.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="first">WESTON had parked his car beside the track that
led from Como to the Old House. He had visited Gideah Brading's
camp, and had then returned to the road&mdash;the toe of the shoe
mark pointed away from the camp. Where had he gone to?</p>

<p>The journalist must have visited Brading's old camp early in
the afternoon. From there he had gone to the bluff, and had found
the wooden box safe in its hole in the sands. He had returned to
the camp, and then to the track. Where then?</p>

<p>Estimating that Weston had spent an hour in the old camp and
the bluff, he should have returned to Sydney not later than eight
o'clock. But, for some reason, he had abandoned his car but a
bare hundred yards from the camp. He had not left the vicinity of
the Inlet. Possibly, something had attracted his attention, and
he had gone on foot to make an examination. He had not returned
to his car.</p>

<p>Where had he gone? The faint light of the moon had long since
vanished from the sky; where the expert and the police officers
stood they were shrouded in thick darkness. The only light they
had came from their pocket torches, and they had been using them
freely. It was possible they had only light for a very short
time.</p>

<p>Lister walked ahead to where the car stood beside the dirt
road. Some little distance further on there was a small clearing
in the bush. There it would be possible to turn the car. He did
not wish to disturb any tracks by backing the car down to where
the track led into the camp. As he entered the car he saw the
police officers had followed him, making, as he had, a wide
detour to avoid any marks on or near the road.</p>

<p>A few words outlined his intentions. The constable went ahead
to find out a road for the car. A zigzag course through the bush
after some effort, brought them on to the dirt road again, well
behind where Weston had come out on the road from the camp. Here
Lister relinquished the wheel to the constable, directing him to
follow the Inspector and himself, keeping the big lamps of the
car focused on the road a few feet ahead of them.</p>

<p>Weston had not walked directly along the track. He had
wandered from one side to the other of the rough road. At places
he had turned into the bush, only to return to the road. It was
easy to track him on the journey. The expert began to wonder
where it was to end. A slight "hiss" from Williams caused them to
halt.</p>

<p>"Road bends to the left, just ahead," he said when they went
back to the car. "Goes away on a sharp angle. The Old House is
some little distance around the corner. I don't know if there is
anyone there, but I thought I should warn you. Once round the
corner and the lights of the car will be visible from the
house."</p>

<p>"Good." Lister thought a few moments. "Is anyone living
there?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. I haven't been down here for donkey's years, but
there was a rumour at Como a little while back that someone had
bought the place. I didn't come out to see if it was true. Only
too glad to have the place let. It was becoming a rest-house for
hoboes."</p>

<p>"Park the car at the side of the track," Lister ordered, after
a moment's thought. "We'll not risk disturbing anyone at the Old
House. We'll manage somehow."</p>

<p>"That will be difficult." The Inspector had been peering round
on the surface of the road by the light of his torch. "Got any
idea where Mr. Weston is?"</p>

<p>"At the Old House." Lister spoke confidently. "I don't know
why I say that, but I feel certain we shall find him there."</p>

<p>"At the Old House?" The Inspector looked surprised. "Do you
suggest that Mr. Weston went to the Old House and walked into a
trap? We're not living a detective romance, Mr. Lister?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not." Lister spoke shortly. "Yet we are faced with
two murders; two disappearances of persons investigating those
murders; wooden boxes scattered around Sydney, hidden in the
sands beside the waters; and a power-boat that sets at defiance
all at present known laws of electrical energy. If you will find
me a book written around similar subjects. Inspector, I shall be
glad to read it."</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer the expert withdrew his torch
from his pocket, and marched on towards the corner of the road.
Less than fifty yards before where they had halted the road bent
at almost right angles to the direction in which they had been
walking. Lister waited at the corner until the police officers
came up to him. He had found the prints of Weston's shoes at the
corner pointing down the new road.</p>

<p>"What's that?" The Inspector caught Lister's arm suddenly.
"Did you see that light?"</p>

<p>"The Old House&mdash;" The answer came from Williams. "Looks
like there's someone there."</p>

<p>"Then it was a light in one of the windows, for it came well
off to the right, and high up."</p>

<p>"Over there is the Inlet." Lister stood gazing into the dark
bush. "Wonder how far it is in a straight line to the water.
Can't be many yards?"</p>

<p>"Know the Inlet well, Williams?" The Inspector asked the
question.</p>

<p>"Sail into it sometimes. There's a heap of prawns always
there, and plenty of fish. Appears to be a regular feeding ground
for them-"</p>

<p>"Then you have some knowledge of the banks of the Inlet, along
this part." The expert spoke carefully. "Above the bluff there is
a patch of sand. That comes to a point under a low bank. What
lies along the shore working towards the river? Any more
sand?"</p>

<p>"No. The water comes right up to the foot of the bank. Most of
the way there's quite a good depth of water along the bank. The
land's irregular. At one or two places there are little cuts
where the water laps on the land level. Anyone could land along
the bank at any tide, but it would be a stiff climb at some
places at low water. At other places, the low ones, the boat
could run on to the land, and anyone step overboard on to the
bank."</p>

<p>"Don't understand that light." The Inspector was staring down
the road towards where the Old House stood. He turned his back on
the place in the bush from where the light came, and pulled out
his watch. A snap of his torch, and he replaced it in his pocket
again. "Nearly half-past three. How about camping for an hour,
Mr. Lister. Daylight then, and we'll have a better chance of
getting at the truth of things."</p>

<p>"So will the people at the Old House." Lister took a step
along the road. "I think we'll go on, Mack. I'd like to have a
look at the place before daylight. Can you find the way in the
dark, Williams?"</p>

<p>"Him?" The Inspector laughed. "Williams is a bushman, and like
a cat in the dark. Came from the backblocks to the Force, and
hasn't yet forgotten his early misdeeds."</p>

<p>The constable took the lead, and went down the road at a fair
pace. At the end of about two hundred yards he halted, abruptly.
When Lister got up to him he was standing with his hand resting
on a corner post of a wire fence.</p>

<p>"Gate about fifty yards along here," he whispered. "Do you
want to go up to the house?"</p>

<p>"Not through the gate," interposed Mack. "Where does this
fence run?"</p>

<p>"Down to the water. About three hundred feet or a bit
more."</p>

<p>"We'll go down the fence," decided the expert. "When we get to
the water we'll cut across along the bank to the other fence and
back along the road to the gate. If we find nothing to
investigate we'll go inside the wire and have a look around."</p>

<p>Williams turned along the fence in the direction of the Inlet.
In the deeper darkness that precedes the dawn the bush caught at
them with a hundred hidden hands. Stumps sprang up under their
feet, and continually they were swerving on to the long strands
of barbed wire of the fence that tore the skin off their hands as
they caught at it to prevent themselves from falling. They could
only proceed very slowly, but at length they stood on the bank of
the Inlet, and looked out over the darkened waters.</p>

<p>There was nothing moving on the Inlet. Lister passed through
the fence, followed by his comrades. Williams stepped again in
the lead, and led along the edge of the bank. The ground dipped
slightly, and about thirty yards from the fence commenced to rise
again.</p>

<p>A little light had appeared in the eastern sky, as yet not
enough to help them. The slope was a long one, and over the crest
the land descended again. At the bottom of the little hollow
Lister halted. He thought the bush towards the house had assumed
a denser character.</p>

<p>The two officers had gone on. Lister made to follow them, and
stopped. There was something in the bush to the right. He tried
to peer into the darkness and resolve what was there. The
darkness was not caused by the Old House, for it stood back some
way from the Inlet, near the road. They were close to the bank,
and between them and the house was a long stretch of bush. Lister
whistled softly. The officers stopped, and came back to where he
was standing.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Lister pointed to the thick patch of bush</p>

<p>"Bush." Mack decided after a few moment's straining into the
darkness.</p>

<p>"I don't think so." Lister turned up the hollow. The ground
rose very slowly as they progressed. The expert fixed his eyes,
on the thick blackness, and walked directly towards it. At the
edge of the thickness he halted and looked around him.</p>

<p>The ground sloped back to the edge of the water, and, unlike
the other gully they had passed, was entirely clear of trees and
stumps, although the sides of the gully were fairly well
timbered. This alone was suspicious. It was not a water-way, for
no stream trickled down to the inlet. Naturally this gully should
have been thickly encumbered with bush.</p>

<p>Lister turned towards the bush again and advanced another ten
feet. He gave a low cry of astonishment. Behind a fringe of bush
stood a low shed. Drawing his torch, the expert threw the light
on the front of the shed. Now he understood. Before the doors of
the shed, and attached to them in some manner he could not yet
understand, was arranged a thickness of low bush. From the
distant water anyone passing would believe he was looking at the
virgin bush. Only from a position immediately before the doors
could the imposture be detected. He stepped forward and threw the
light of the torch along the sandy soil. Suddenly, he clutched
the Inspector's arm.</p>

<p>Directly before the doors, and almost in the centre of the
gully, was the mark of a rubber-heeled shoe.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="first">WESTON had come from the bluff to the doors of
the hidden shed. Why? Lister was certain that when the newspaper
man had left Sydney he had been in ignorance of the Old House. He
had come to Yaney's Inlet with the sole intention of examining
the box hidden at the foot of the bluff.</p>

<p>What had lured the newspaper-man to the Old House? He had left
no footmarks at the bluff, or at Gideah Brading's camp. At the
camp they had found indications that he had been careful to
obliterate all signs of his presence. Only along the road between
the camp and the Old House had his footsteps showed plainly.
Lister had watched to see if any other person had traversed the
road since Weston had passed. He had seen nothing
significant.</p>

<p>The trail from the motor-car to the bend in the road had
wandered in a strange manner, from side to side of the road. It
had looked as if Weston had been following some trail, yet
nothing but his footmarks were to be seen: Except for the
footmarks directly before the door of the shed there had been no
footmarks in the bush along the banks of the Inlet.</p>

<p>Weston had come to the shed lying behind the Old House and
close to the banks of the Inlet. The shed belonged to the Old
House, for it stood within the enclosed grounds. The journalist's
foot-mark lay almost on the threshold of the shed.</p>

<p>Lister turned to the shed again. Mack was working along the
front of the doors; Williams had disappeared, but sounds from out
the bush showed that he was circling the structure, possibly
looking for some unguarded entrance.</p>

<p>"Where's that skeleton key you had at the bluff?" asked the
Inspector, abruptly. "It might move this lock."</p>

<p>Lister handed over his keys, and stood watching the police
officer work on the lock. The key was over-small for the wards,
but the Inspector persevered. At length, there was a slight
click, and he stood back, satisfied. He was about to reach
forward and pull open the loosened doors when Lister stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Be careful. Mack. We are dealing with some very dangerous
criminals. If there is anything in this shed connected with them
they are not likely to leave it unguarded. It might be as well to
leave the examination of the shed until daylight."</p>

<p>"And let those brutes up at the house have a chance to get
away? No, thank you. I'm going into this place."</p>

<p>"Careful, then. Get behind that door and pull it open when I
give the word. There was a lot of truth in what the Inspector
said."</p>

<p>"Now!"</p>

<p>The door moved easily. Lister watched the shed keenly as the
door swung on its well-oiled hinges. He did not know what he was
expecting, but he reasoned that they were facing some unknown
danger, if, indeed, this place belonged to the crew of the
Phantom Launch.</p>

<p>The early beams of the dawning day showed only a long shed,
and to one side of it a huge bulk, covered with a tarpaulin.
Pressing the trigger of his torch he threw the light on the bulk
as he advanced cautiously. The Inspector came from behind the
door and joined him, switching on his torch. Cautiously, they let
their lights play over the hidden thing.</p>

<p>They might have been looking into a motor shed containing a
large lorry&mdash;There was nothing dangerous or mysterious in
it, save the big covered thing. Against the wall stood a large
work table, and attached to it a strong vice. A little way along
was a big lathe, and almost under it a small, yet powerful,
electric motor. At the rear of the building had been erected a
pile of tins.</p>

<p>There was an air of innocence over the place. Save for the
covered thing there was nothing but what was contained in
hundreds of garages in the district. The Inspector moved forward
and untied one of the lugs, drawing back the covers as far as he
could. On two small caterpillar tractors stood the Phantom
Launch. Lister recognised it immediately. It was fully forty feet
long, and built of some silver-grey substance. The expert placed
his hand on the smooth, shining surface. It was metal. He tapped
it with his penknife. It rang like steel. He scraped the surface.
The knife-blade did not make a scratch.</p>

<p>Mack was moving around the tractors, releasing the ties of the
oiled cover. Now he and Williams drew back the covers, revealing
the graceful outlines of the mysterious pirate boat. Fore and aft
it was decked, the centre of the vessel forming a small well.
Lister found a foothold on the trolley, and lifted himself to the
level of the deck. From where he stood he could not see into the
well; only the long smooth line of the deck, broken by large
hatches.</p>

<p>"The Phantom Launch." He uttered the words under his breath.
Mack looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"You recognise it, Mr. Lister?"</p>

<p>"So far as anyone can. Remember, Phelps and I only saw it in
the moonlight, far out on the waters of the harbour. Yet, I am
prepared to swear it is the same boat."</p>

<p>"End of Part 1. Capture of the Phantom Launch." The Inspector
chuckled gleefully. "Now we have the boat we'll have a look for
the owners. They're up at the house, I suppose. Mr. Weston, too.
Looks as if he got on the track of the launch, and they get
him."</p>

<p>It was a reasonable explanation of Weston's disappearance.
Lister tried to reconstruct the journalist's actions. Somewhere
on the line of route he had learned there was another road to
Yaney's Inlet that would bring him close to Gideah Brading's
camp. He had found it and driven his car down to just past where
the track led to the camp. From the camp he had wandered down to
the bluff. It was possible he had been searching for the hidden
box when he got on the track of the Phantom Launch.</p>

<p>Had the men from the Phantom Launch come on Weston while he
was engaged in digging up the wooden box at the bluff? No. The
footprints from the camp along the dirt road to the Old House
forbade such a theory. Weston was not under restraint when he
walked along that road.</p>

<p>Then, the Phantom Launch had come to the hidden shed while
Weston was at the bluff. He had seen and recognised her in the
distance, and had hurriedly restored the sands over the box and
obliterated his footprints. He had hidden and watched the launch
come to the little gully. He had seen it lifted from the waters
on to the tractors and carried into the bush.</p>

<p>Certain he was on the track of the solution of the mysteries
surrounding the Phantom Launch, Weston had not stopped to think
of possible danger. He had determined to track the launch to its
lair.</p>

<p>But, such an hypothesis contained a flaw. If Weston had seen
the Phantom Launch on the waters, from the bluff he would have
walked along the edge of the inlet until he came to the place
where the boat had been carried up out of the waters. It seemed
unreasonable that he could have so marked the spot that he could
return to his motor car and the track down to the Old House. The
only explanation was that he had knowledge of the Old House and
its situation, and, on seeing the launch leaving the water, had
guessed that it was being taken to some shelter near the Old
House.</p>

<p>Inspector Mack and Williams were restoring the tarpaulins over
the Phantom Launch, and re-tying the lugs. When they had finished
they came and stood beside the expert, looking over the waters of
the Inlet towards the dawning sun. Lister continued to stare
straight before him. He was seeking answers to the many questions
that thronged his brain. Why had Weston come direct to the Old
House? Where was Pirates' Bay?</p>

<p>Lister turned sharply and walked to the opened shed. The light
was now quite bright, and the interior of the shed, facing the
east, brilliantly lit through the wide-opened doors. Carefully,
he circled the building, scanning the various objects in the
shed, and the walls. Over the work-table he found some memoranda
scribbled on the walls. They seemed to apply to some branch of
electrical science. Taking a pad and pencil from his pocket, he
made a careful note of them.</p>

<p>Almost in the midst of them was a small map of Sydney, and the
surrounding country, and on it had been traced two black lines in
the form of an irregular cross. At the termination of each line
had been placed an arrow-head. Another look round the shed, and
the expert prepared to rejoin the police officers. Mack was
showing signs of impatience.</p>

<p>"Ready, Mr. Lister." One wing of the doors had been closed,
and Williams stood with his hand on the other wing, prepared to
shut it when Lister came out. "If we don't look sharp those chaps
at the house will awake, and then there'll be trouble."</p>

<p>"One minute, Mack. What about our footprints? Would it not be
as well to wipe them out before we leave?"</p>

<p>"Why the trouble?" grumbled the Inspector. "If we're lucky
we'll have the birds as well as their nest."</p>

<p>Almost immediately after he turned to the constable and spoke
a few words. Williams went into the bush and broke off a bough of
a tree. With it he obliterated all marks on the ground.</p>

<p>"Good enough," exclaimed the Inspector at length. "Take those
marks out where we came up the gully, Williams. Mr. Lister and I
will finish securing the shed. Then, when we leave, you can blot
our steps out."</p>

<p>The second door was almost in place when Lister placed his
hand on the Inspector's arm.</p>

<p>"What's that, Mack?"</p>

<p>From inside the shed came a low rustling&mdash;as if some
animal was passing over shavings. The Inspector heard the sound,
for he allowed the door to slip from his hands, and fall open.
There was an interval of silence, and then the strange rustling
came again.</p>

<p>"Damned queer." The Inspector lifted his hat from his head,
and rubbed his forehead with the peak. "I had as idea I heard the
same sound while you were examining the shed, but I passed it at
the time."</p>

<p>Lister unbolted the shut wing of the door, and allowed it to
awing open, flooding the shed with the morning light. So far as
he could see there was nothing about. He entered the shed and
searched it thoroughly, even looking under the trolleys.</p>

<p>"Look under there, Mack," he said quietly. "Can you see
anything strange?"</p>

<p>"Can't see anything out of the ordinary." The Inspector was
almost under the carriages.</p>

<p>"Notice those trolleys are electrically driven?"</p>

<p>"They've got motors," Mack answered as if he was making a
concession.</p>

<p>"There's an electric dynamo attached to the lathe," suggested
the expert.</p>

<p>"Suppose they use it to drive the lathe. But that doesn't
explain that queer sound."</p>

<p>"I should like to know if you've ever known electric motors
driven without being connected with some source of power,
Mack?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Lister?"</p>

<p>"There are three trolleys in this shed, but no dynamo, and no
sign of wiring to any electrical supply. What's the
explanation?"</p>

<p>The inspector looked round the big shed, perplexedly. His eyes
fell on the Phantom Launch, and he laughed slightly.</p>

<p>"Thought you had something on me that time, Mr. Lister. Of
course, there's a dynamo. The launch engines work it, and they
wire out to the motors when they want to use them."</p>

<p>"You may be right." In spite of his words, Lister continued to
look puzzled.</p>

<p>"Now tell me the reason of that rustling&mdash;Lor'! There it
is again." The Inspector sprang to the side of the Phantom
Launch. "I believe it comes from inside here."</p>

<p>The Inspector had guessed correctly. The sounds came from
under the covers concealing the Phantom Launch. With hasty
fingers they united the lugs and drew off the covering sheets.
Mack caught the edge of the and drew himself up. There was a long
bundle in the well. The place was in deep shadow, and the
Inspector could not decide what it was. It might be some covered
part of the machinery, or&mdash;</p>

<p>Lister caught the police officer's legs, and hoisted him until
he could get a knee on the side of the boat. Mack dropped to the
bottom of the well, beside the big bundle. He gave a low shout
that caused an exclamation of impatience to break from the
expert's lips. Lister stepped back, and jumped for the edge of
the boat. His fingers caught and he drew himself up, and peered
over.</p>

<p>Mack was bending over a man, tied and gagged, and lying on the
bottom of the boat. The Inspector had switched on the light of
his torch, and the little circle of light played on the impassive
features of Austin Chosen's Chinese servant, Lou Sing.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="first">A FEW slashes of the Inspector's knife and the
man was freed. Without help, he climbed to the floor of the shed
and stood before the three men, his hands concealed in the long
sleeves of his robe.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Lou Sing?" asked Lister,
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Lou Sing? Is that the name of this josser?" The Inspector
looked curiously at the Asian. "Now I'd like to know who Lou Sing
is?"</p>

<p>"Austin Chosen's body servant." Lister gave the explanation
and turned to the Chinese "Now then, Lou Sing, we want to know
how you came here?"</p>

<p>"Me no say." The Chinese bowed low as he spoke.</p>

<p>"No say!" Mack stepped forward, his hand raised,
threateningly. "I'll make you say, my friend. There's enough
funny business going on about here. I'm for getting to the bottom
of it."</p>

<p>"Velly solly. Me no say."</p>

<p>Lister caught at the Inspector's raised arm and drew him to
one side. In a few words he explained Lou Sing's standing with
the Mystery Man. Mack was sufficiently advised of Austin Chosen's
standing with the authorities to consider before deciding to deal
drastically with his servant. For a moment he stood undecided:
then, his eyes fell on the leg of the work-table.</p>

<p>"That'll do," he said, grimly. "We haven't time for prisoners,
at present, and whether that fellow is Chosen's servant, or not,
he's not going free. Got your handcuffs, Williams? Good. Chain
his arms round the leg of that table. We'll know, where to find
him when we want him."</p>

<p>Lister was inclined to protest, but the Inspector was
peremptory. Lou Sing was forced to sit beneath the work-table,
and his arms locked round the leg. Mack made the position as
comfortable as possible, but there was no possible chance of the
man getting away.</p>

<p>"Now for the house." The Inspector turned briskly to the door.
"We'll leave these doors open, so he will not be in the dark. Not
likely anyone will come along to release him."</p>

<p>The sun was now well up in the sky, but the house continued
silent. Lister began to wonder if anyone was within it. The place
looked deserted. Yet they had seen a light in one of the rooms,
as they turned the corner of the road.</p>

<p>Williams went ahead, while Lister and the Inspector hung back,
sheltering along the fringe of bush. The constable moved swiftly,
yet without making hardly any noise. Lying in the bush, the two
men watched him approach the house. He came to one corner and
passed out of sight. A long wait, and he appeared at the opposite
corner, beckoning to them.</p>

<p>"No signs of anyone around the house." Yet the man spoke in
almost a whisper. "There's a side door around here. It seems
fastened, but not very strong. It should give with a strong
push."</p>

<p>"We haven't a warrant." The Inspector looked undecided, yet he
immediately followed Lister and the constable.</p>

<p>The door did not look strong. Lister put his shoulder to it
and strained. It was evidently only held by a latch. The expert
looked interrogatively at the Inspector, who slightly shook his
head. At the same time he smiled and looked away. Lister strained
against the latch, again. He believed a smart shove and the door
would give way.</p>

<p>"Hum!" Mack turned and glanced at the door again. "Now, if
that door was open, it would be my duty to go in and see that all
was safe. Williams assures me there are strange characters about
this neighbourhood."</p>

<p>For a full minute he stood and gazed at the painted wood. Then
he turned his back on the house and called the constable's
attention to something in the bush. Lister charged forward. There
was a crash, and the door swung inwards.</p>

<p>"By Jove! The door is open." The Inspector took a step
forward. "Williams, I believe it is our duty to see whether this
house is occupied. Looks strange. You will note, constable, the
door appears to have been forced. I fancy someone must have made
a forcible entry."</p>

<p>While talking to convince himself that he had not broken the
law, Mack led the way into a long passage, dark and narrow. On
either side, close to the door of entrance, were doors. Down the
passage showed other doors. Mack stood some way in the passage
and called loudly. There was no reply. He turned and entered the
room on the right. It was furnished as a bedroom, and showed
signs of recent occupation. A quick glance around and the
Inspector returned to the passage. He opened the door on the
left, and found himself in a big kitchen. This room also showed
signs of recent occupation. A fair quantity of food was in the
cupboards and safes.</p>

<p>A door, further up the passage, and close to the main
entrance, led into what was a sitting-room. On the opposite side
of the hall was a large dining-room. Opening from the dining-room
was a door that led to the kitchen, and in an annexe to the
kitchen were the sculleries and a large shed.</p>

<p>Again the Inspector returned to the passage. Over the kitchen
door a stairway led to the upper part of the house. Under the
stairs a space had been boarded, and was filled with
recently-chopped wood.</p>

<p>"Nothing to interest us down here," remarked Mack, leading the
way to the stairs. "We'll have a look round up here, and if we
don't find someone at home, we'll take the house in detail.
There's no doubt someone's lived here recently&mdash;and more
than one person."</p>

<p>The side of the house over the kitchens and dining-room was
occupied by bedrooms. Three doors led into small rooms. On the
opposite side of the upstairs passage stood two doors. Lister
opened one of them, and started back, in surprise, as he entered
the room.</p>

<p>The partition walls had been removed and the space made one
big room. It had been fitted up as an electrical workshop, and,
here again, they found ample signs of recent occupation. It had
been left as if the users were to return within a very short
space of time.</p>

<p>Lister wandered round the room. Most of the apparatus was
familiar to him, but there was much that was strange to him. The
owner of these workshops must be a man of high technical
knowledge.</p>

<p>Beneath the window stood a fine lathe, and close by a small
electrical motor. At hand was a table, large and solid, occupied
by a small motor, coupled by wires to a strange piece of
apparatus. Around were scattered a litter of tools. There was no
dust on any of the tools or machines. Everything was bright,
clean, and ready for the resumption of work.</p>

<p>Lister wandered around the room, looking at the numerous
diagrams fastened to the wall. At one place he stopped, suddenly.
On a bench stood a very fine wireless transmitting set, and, on
the wall over it, a small map of Sydney and districts, across
which had been drawn heavy black arrow-tipped lines. On the
edge of the map were written four numbers preceded by letters.
While the expert was trying to fathom the meaning of the map the
Inspector came and stood by him.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, Mr. Lister?" The Inspector spoke the words
under his breath. "Say, what were they working on?"</p>

<p>"The Phantom Launch," Lister answered briefly. He had passed
to examine one of the blue prints hanging on the wall. His hand
touched something on the table and he picked it up, and after a
brief examination handed it to the Inspector. "Here's a piece of
the metal of which the boat's hull is built. Its untarnishable,
evidently an alloy of aluminium and other metals. Hard as steel
and light as a feather. Find the secret of this alloy, Mack, and
there's a fortune in your hand."</p>

<p>"What's this machine?" queried the Inspector. They had passed
round the room to the strange motor on its large table. "Looks
like the interior of a wireless set coupled up with a
turbine."</p>

<p>"I'm guessing, Mack, this is Mostyn Delaney's workshop."</p>

<p>"Who's Mostyn Delaney?"</p>

<p>"The finest electrical brain on the continent, but as mad as a
hatter. You've heard of the 'Water Witch?' Mostyn Delaney built
that boat, and I'm guessing he had a lot to do with the building
of the Phantom Launch. He&mdash;" Lister stopped abruptly. "Found any signs of Tony Weston?"</p>

<p>Mack shook his head. They had expected, when they gained entry
into this house, to solve many of the questions that perplexed
them. They expected to find Anthony Weston in one of the rooms,
possibly bound and gagged; they had expected to be met with
resistance. They had found rooms recently occupied; they had
found a complete workshop, kitchens, well-stocked, every sign of
habitation, but not a soul about. They had found the Phantom
Launch, and an empty house.</p>

<p>There was no doubt but that the crew of the Phantom Launch had
recently occupied the house. The kitchens showed that a meal for
several persons had recently been cooked. The dining-room still
held the table covered with a soiled cloth, and littered with
dirty utensils. A newspaper containing a full account of the
prosecution of Francis Hawson lay on the table among the
dishes, and, on a plate beside it the stump of a good cigar.</p>

<p>Where had they gone to? They had come to the house in the
Phantom Launch. The boat had been wheeled into its shed. The crew
had stayed in the house for some time and had then departed.
Where?</p>

<p>Weston had come to the Inlet the previous afternoon. The
newspaper was evidence that someone connected with the Phantom
Launch had been in the city soon after the case
ended&mdash;possibly had been in court during the proceedings. He
had brought the newspaper to the Old House. That meant that he
had been in the house the previous afternoon, possibly during the
early hours of the evening. Had they fled the Old House fearing
the police were on their track?</p>

<p>They would not abandon the Phantom Launch. The chase had not
come close enough to them for that. They had left the house for
some purpose. It was evident the place was not their
headquarters, but only one of the numerous hiding-places they had
established around the metropolis. He would find them at their
headquarters&mdash;at Pirates' Bay.</p>

<p>Weston had come to Yaney's Inlet. So had the Phantom Launch.
If he had reasoned correctly, Weston had observed the Phantom
Launch making for her shelter at the Old House. The journalist
had followed and found the boatshed. From there all trace of him
ended.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt. The crew of the Phantom Launch had
discovered the newspaper-man prowling about the boatshed, and had
captured him. Had they brought him into this house? If so, what
had they done with him! There were no traces of the journalist in
the house.</p>

<p>The finding of Lou Sing complicated the problem. Had he been
searching out the Phantom Launch and been captured? Had he been
captured before or after the journalist? If before, why had he
not been hidden with Weston? If after, then the signs indicated
that the newspaper man had been removed from the Old House.
Reason pointed that Weston was not about the house.</p>

<p>It was impossible that Weston, if alive and sensible, would
not seek to leave traces of his being prisoner at the Old House.
Lister left the workshops and wandered through the rooms,
scanning possible and impossible places for some signs of his
chum. In one of the bedrooms he found some dirty linen stuffed in
a box, with a chintz curtain covering the front. He pulled it
out. From the linen fell a piece of crunched-up paper. The
expert's eyes glistened when he saw it. It was copy
paper&mdash;similar to that used in the <i>Pictorial</i> offices.
Weston always carried some sheets of it in his pocket. Carefully,
he smoothed it out. On one side were a few words, in
shorthand.</p>

<p>Lister puzzled over them for some minutes before he could make
out the characters. Like many journalists, Weston's shorthand had
degenerated in the press of work, becoming to a great extent a
series of private outlines, utterly at variance with the laws of
Isaac Pitman. At last the characters fitted into
place:&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="typewriter">Taking me to Pirates Bay. Tell
Chosen.&mdash;Tony.</p><br> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="first">"TAKEN to Pirates' Bay!" Where was Pirates' Bay?
From the moment the girl had spoken the name over the air, the
place had come into prominence in the mystery surrounding the
Phantom Launch. Now Tony Weston had disappeared, and had left
behind him a message stating he was being taken to Pirates'
Bay.</p>

<p>Turning abruptly. Lister ran along the passage to the door of
the workshop. He believed he had found a clue to Pirates' Bay. If
so, then the hours were not long before the men who controlled
the Phantom Launch were tracked down and captured. Already the
police had the speed boat in their hands.</p>

<p>In the workshop, Lister went straight to the map of Sydney and
districts hanging over the wireless transmitter, and took it from
the wall. Luckily it had not been pasted on, except for the four
corners, and they did not affect the heavy black lines crossing
the map.</p>

<p>Lister was convinced that the wooden boxes played a big part
in the activities of the Phantom Launch. He was realising that,
except for Myella Cove, the boxes had been buried within a little
distance of some hiding-place of the Phantom Launch. Middle
Harbour and Yaney's Inlet were the two places where both boxes
and hiding places were established. Pirates' Bay would be a
hiding place, and probably near by he would find a wooden
box.</p>

<p>Austin Chosen had declared that the Phantom Launch had some
secret home up the Parramatta River. The mystery boat had gone
from Myella Cove up towards the Parramatta River. It had returned
down the harbour, later. Possibly that might be explained by some
message being conveyed to the crew, after their return from
working on the wooden box, to go to sea and take Francis Hawson
from the mail boat. Again, when the Phantom Launch had broken out
of the trap at Middle Harbour, Austin Chosen had declared it had
gone up to the Parramatta River, in spite of the police assertion
that it had escaped through the Heads, out to sea.</p>

<p>Mostyn Delaney had built the <i>Water Witch</i>; possibly he
had built the Phantom Launch, the wonderful successor to the
famous hydroplane that had roused the wonder of the electrical
engineers of the world. At the time of the building of the
<i>Water Witch</i> Mostyn Delaney had lived somewhere to the west
of Sydney. Had he retained the workshops where he built the
<i>Water Witch</i>? And, was he using those workshops for a
harbourage for the Phantom Launch?</p>

<p>For some minutes Lister stood in the workshop of the Old
House, striving to remember if he had ever heard the address of
Mostyn Delaney's workshops. He could not remember, yet he had an
impression that at one time he had known their whereabouts.</p>

<p>Yaney's Inlet, Middle Harbour, Parramatta River, and Pirates'
Bay. Four points of refuge. Three of them lay within a twelve
miles' radius of Sydney. It was more than probable the fourth,
Pirates' Bay, lay within the same radius. Austin Chosen had
believed the Phantom Launch had a refuge on the sea coast. Was
that refuge Pirates' Bay?</p>

<p>A low whistle from Inspector Mack aroused Lister from his
reverie. He whistled an answer, and the Inspector climbed the
stairs to the workshop. Lister was trying to explain to Mack some
of the theories he had built up concerning the Phantom Launch and
her haunts when a shout from Constable Williams startled them.
Mack sprang to the door and raced to one of the rooms at the back
of the house. Williams was standing at the window. Lister looked
over the man's shoulder. The Phantom Launch had been drawn out of
the shed, and was being carried swiftly towards the water. Two
men stood in the well of the vessel, while three others were
scrambling aboard. The expert recognised one of the men in the
vessel. It was Lou Sing, Austin Chosen's Chinese servant.</p>

<p>Inspector Mack uttered a cry of anger, and made for the door,
followed by Williams and Lister. Mack was pulling out his
revolver as he raced down the stairs. Out in the open and past
the boatshed they again caught sight of the mystery launch. It
was entering the water. The Inspector raced down the gully,
calling on the men to surrender. He was answered with derisive
shouts. When they arrived at the edge of the water the Phantom
Launch was well out on the Inlet, and gathering speed. Mack
emptied his revolver after the boat in a frenzy of anger.</p>

<p>The Phantom Launch had escaped. Lister stood on the banks of
the Inlet watching the graceful vessel race up towards George's
River. When the boat sped out of sight he turned and walked back
to the house, followed by the two downcast police officers.</p>

<p>"What's the good of going in there again?" asked the
Inspector, halting at the door. "We've seen all there is to see.
I want to get in touch with Sutherland, and have half a dozen men
raced here to take charge of the place. Those fellows don't use
it again, I'll bet on that."</p>

<p>"There's the wireless here, Mack." Lister pushed past the
police officer, and ran up the stairs. "I may be able to get in
touch with Haslington."</p>

<p>The batteries of the wireless transmitter were fully charged,
and in a few minutes Lister was talking to his friend. After he
had transmitted Mack's message to the officer on duty at the
police station, he tried to get in touch with Austin Chosen.
Again and again, he called the Mystery Man, without result.
Austin Chosen must have heard him, for he rarely left his couch
during the day.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done at Yaney's Inlet. Williams
went down the lane and brought Weston's car to the Old House and
ran it in the boatshed. The constable offered to remain on guard
at the house, although there was small likelihood of the Phantom
Launch returning. Lister and Mack walked back to the bluff, and
found the car-driver fast asleep, camped on the cushions of the
car. They awoke him, and drove to Tom Ugly's punt, where the
Inspector's car awaited him. There they parted, and Lister went
to Sydney.</p>

<p>Where was Tony Weston? Continually, the question recurred to
Lister's tired brain.</p>

<p>Arriving at Circular Quay Lister dismissed the car and caught
the ferry for Balmoral. At home, he telephoned the
<i>Pictorial</i> offices news of the disappearance of the
journalist, being careful not to mention Pirates' Bay. Only three
people knew of that last harbourage of the pirate, and they were
to be trusted. Time enough to mention Pirates' Bay when the place
was surrounded, or in the hands of the police. From the telephone
Lister went to his bedroom and immediately fell asleep.</p>

<p>Ah Sam aroused him from a dream in which he was fighting a
band of pirates, single-handed at Pirates' Bay. The Chinese had a
light meal on a tray and placed it on the bed. Beside the meal
lay a slip of paper. Theodore Parker, of the <i>Pictorial</i>,
wished him to telephone the office immediately he awoke.</p>

<p>Lister was hungry. Sitting up in bed he made an excellent
meal. From the light that filtered into the room through the
drawn blind he guessed it was not far from sunset. He reached for
his watch, to have it immediately placed in his hand by the
silent, attentive Chinese. It was half-past six. He turned to his
meal again. It was absurd to rise at that time of the day,
but&mdash;Where was Pirates' Bay?</p>

<p>Ysobel would be coming over on the ferry, if she was not
already at home. She would have missed Tony, and possibly have
telephoned the "Pictorial" offices. Parker would have told her
that Tony was missing, and that the hunt at Yaney's Inlet had
been unsuccessful. Ysobel would certainly come to him for
news.</p>

<p>"Tall missy. He call Boss aslee'." Ah Sam made the report
phlegmatically.</p>

<p>So Ysobel had called. No doubt the silent Asian had told her
his master was asleep. Ah Sam knew he had been out all night, and
would not let him be awakened.</p>

<p>Lister rolled out of bed, and went into the bathroom. The
shower refreshed him. He dressed leisurely, and strolled into the
wireless room. The instruments were silent. He threw in the
switches and tried the varying wave-lengths. It Was possible that
while he had been asleep someone had tried to get him. If so,
they had received no answer.</p>

<p>For some minutes he tried to get Austin Chosen on the air, but
without success. Then he tuned in to Haslington. The Sutherland
amateur had a small compact set, and spent more of his spare time
with it. It was probable that he was immensely impressed with the
use being made of his instruments for police communication.
Lister got him at the first try. Mack had been to see him, but
had not asked him to get in touch with Balmoral.</p>

<p>Lister had an impulse to go out. He felt uneasy and
unsettled. Not that the disappearance of Tony Weston caused him
any great concern. The newspaper man had had many adventures
during his life, and would count the present one as the chief. He
might be held prisoner for some days; then, the locality of
Pirates' Bay would be discovered and the house raided. It was
possible that Weston, full of nerve and resource, might manage to
break from his prison, and reach the authorities, conveying
information of great moment.</p>

<p>Lister locked up the wireless room, and found his hat. At the
front door he met Constable Phelps, carrying a large bundle of
papers.</p>

<p>"I've got it Mr. Lister!" he exclaimed, almost before he was
seated. "Seems that Herries had a batch of the papers containing
the report of the Pettington case. Here's photos of the three
men. That's Pettington, that's Eccles, and that's Brading."</p>

<p>Lister looked at the photographs with interest. The first,
Pettington, showed a bluff, burly man with an open, good-humoured
face. The expert turned to his desk and found the photograph of
Francis Hawson. The men were alike in build and colouring, yet
there were differences. In expression there were marked
dissimilarities; the Victorian not wearing the furtive, secretive
air of the squatter.</p>

<p>Gideah Brading was recognisable immediately. The eight years
he had spent in prison had hardly altered him. Refined and
softened by the hand of death, as he lay at Yaney's Inlet, he
looked hardly a day older than when he disappeared behind prison
bars. Eccles was a complete stranger. He bore no likeness to
either of the other two, nor to Francis Hawson. A long, thin man
with a melancholy face and stooping shoulders, he was, so far as
Lister could judge, an unimportant factor in the mystery.</p>

<p>"What's the news, Phelps?" Lister looked up from the
photographs.</p>

<p>The constable searched the packet Of papers and drew out a
long letter.</p>

<p>"Herries says a lot that you told me, Mr. Lister," he replied.
"There's all you've got about the Pettington Case and the escapes
of Pettington and Eccles. Then he goes on to say what he thinks
about the methods used for the escapes."</p>

<p>"Any idea of where the men went to?"</p>

<p>"Not a line on them." Phelps frowned at the letter. "The Heads
down there seem to think they left the country."</p>

<p>"That's all they know?"</p>

<p>"They may be right." The constable took a long drink and
turned to the mass of papers. "There's one point Herries gets,
that seems to be news. The chap thought a lot about the matter.
'Course he would. There's a whopping reward for the apprehension
of the two men."</p>

<p>"What's the new point, Phelps?"</p>

<p>"It's this. You remember the formation of the Central
Australian Bank? Well, about that time Wallace Pettington joined
up with another man. Funny, they don't seem to have made any
inquires about him in Melbourne. Herries dug him up, on his own.
It's like this.</p>

<p>"Pettington had a chap he was pals with in Melbourne. The two
men made a great time of it, from what Herries says. Pettington
kept his head, for business reasons. The other man didn't."</p>

<p>"Who was the other man?"</p>

<p>"A chap of the name of Gerald Preston. A few years younger
than Pettington, and a bit of a fool, from what Herries says. Had
plenty of money at first, and then went suddenly broke. One thing
in favour of Pettington. He didn't desert his pal. Gave Preston a
job in one of his companies. The chap was a rotter all through.
Why, he even took down the man who had stuck by him in his
trouble. Herries can't get any proper evidence of the matter at
present, but it seems that Preston forged someone's name and let
Pettington in for a lot of cash. It was all hushed up, and
Preston went free. He disappeared a short while before the
companies went smash. Herries believes six months before. He
found a man who knew Preston. The man said that a day or two
before the smash he asked Pettington where Preston was, and the
old fox said he didn't know. The man didn't believe him. He
thinks that Pettington had some trouble with Master Preston and
shipped him out of the country."</p>

<p>"That the lot?"</p>

<p>"Practically the lot, Mr. Lister. There's a heap about
Pettington and his record, and the funny thing is he mentions
Francis Hawson and his family affairs. But I'll leave the letter
and the papers for you to have a look through."</p>

<p>Phelps stood up and reached for his hat. The telephone rang.
Lister motioned the man to resume his seat and went over to the
desk where the instrument stood. For a minute he listened
intently, his face growing pale.</p>

<p>"What's this about piracy on the Harbour, Phelps?" The expert
turned to the constable. "The <i>Pictorial</i> office tells me
that one of the ferry boats was stopped this evening by the
Phantom Launch and a young lady abducted."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="first">"PIRACY on the Harbour!" The constable rose to
his feet with an exclamation. "Good heavens! That's the blinkin'
limit."</p>

<p>Lister had turned to the telephone again. Theodore Parker was
on the other end of the line. He had hardly renewed the
conversation when the wireless connection in his bedroom
commenced to ring. Making an excuse to the <i>Pictorial</i> chief
of staff that he would get all possible information on the north
side of the Harbour, he cut off and went to the wireless room,
Phelps following close on his heels.</p>

<p>"That you, Lister?" The thin, querulous voice was
unmistakable. "Who's there with you?"</p>

<p>"Constable Phelps."</p>

<p>"So, all right. Don't mention my name. What's this about
piracy on the Harbour?"</p>

<p>"You should be able to get more news from the Police
Department," answered the expert, quickly. A sudden foreboding
was tugging at his heart-strings, and he wanted to get out in the
open&mdash;in action.</p>

<p>"I'll attend to the police. Tell me what you know?"</p>

<p>"Simply the bare fact. The statement came from the
<i>Pictorial</i> office over the 'phone just as you called
me."</p>

<p>"What of Tony Weston?"</p>

<p>"A prisoner of the gang who owns the Phantom Launch. I found a
message from him that he was being taken to Pirates' Bay."</p>

<p>"Then the girl abducted from the ferry was Ysobel. The times
fit."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Ysobel a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"What else is to be expected? You heard Francis Hawson admit
he owned the Phantom Launch. Do you think he would allow Tony and
Ysobel to be free to trace him and his misdeeds when he is on the
run for his life. Scoundrel! Thief! Forger!"</p>

<p>"What is Ysobel to him?"</p>

<p>"His cousin. Evelyn's child. Enough of this. You must act,
Sydney Lister. Have you found out where Pirates' Bay is?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"There lie the solutions of the mysteries; and there you will
find the girl and her brother. Again I say, it is up to you,
Sydney Lister. Get busy for your own life, and the life of the
girl you love. If I had but my health and strength! But I have to
lie here and suffer&mdash;a useless log, not a man. Haste, man. I
tell you, haste, or you will be too late, too."</p>

<p>There came a sudden silence. Lister swung on all the power he
could command, and tried to call the Mystery Man, but he would
not answer. Chosen had cut out, leaving the expert to act with
but a name to guide him. Pirates' Bay! From Parramatta River
around the coast to George's River there lay a hundred bays.
Which of them was known to the crew of the Phantom Launch by the
name of Pirates' Bay?</p>

<p>On one of the walls of the wireless house hung a large map of
Sydney and the surrounding country. Lister took the map down and
laid it on the desk. Somewhere on that map was Pirates' Bay. But
where? Every bay and cove around the coast was known and named.
How could he identify some well-known spot with the name used by
the pirates?</p>

<p>On the map Lister had marked the various private and public
wireless plants. Had he time he could have organised a series of
detectors, and so traced down the secret wireless plant that no
doubt was established at Pirates' Bay. He had found a similar one
at the Old House at Yaney's Inlet. He blamed himself that, when
first he heard the calls on the air to and from the Silver Swan,
he had not commenced a scientific search of the air to discover
where the headquarters of the Phantom Launch crew had been
established.</p>

<p>For almost an hour the two men bent over the map, considering
the various bays and coves around the coast and up the rivers.
They could decide on no one that answered to all the requirements
for the headquarters for the Phantom Launch. Every one of them
was exposed to observation, either from the land or sea. Almost
in despair, Sydney remembered the defaced map he had taken from
over the wireless apparatus at the Old House. Did that map
contain the clue to Pirates' Bay?</p>

<p>The map was in his pocket. Lister pulled it out and spread it
on the larger map. It was of small size, and had evidently been
torn from some guide or directory. Across the centre of the map
had been drawn two thick lines.</p>

<p>One line ran almost north and south, the other lay across it,
the "v's" making small angles. The lines were irregular in
length, the N.-S. line being considerably the longer. How could
those two black lines guide him to Pirates' Bay?</p>

<p>SUDDENLY he realised that the longer line ran from Middle
Harbour to the George's River. Had that any significance? Bending
closer over the map, he felt certain that the line terminated at
two significant points. The top end rested almost on the point of
sand where he had found the wooden box; the lower point lay
across Yaney's Inlet.</p>

<p>The top end of the second line lay against a point on the
west side of Lane Cove River. Austin Chosen had affirmed that
after the escape from Middle Harbour the Phantom Launch had
sought shelter up the Parramatta River. Mostyn Delaney had had
workshops somewhere up the river. Lane Cove River flowed into the
Parramatta River. Had Mostyn Delaney's workshops been situated on
the banks of the Lane Cove River?</p>

<p>If his guess was correct, and Mostyn Delaney had built the
Phantom Launch at his old workshops on the Lane Cove River, then
the mystery surrounding the Phantom Launch's third harbour of
refuge was solved. The Mystery Man had guessed correctly. The
Phantom Launch, after its escape from Middle Harbour, had gone up
river to Lane Cove River, and had hidden in the old workshops.
More than probable there was some apparatus at the old workshops
to take the launch out of the water and hide it.</p>

<p>Another step in the solution of the mystery had been taken.
Middle Harbour and Yaney's Inlet were now being watched by the
police. A word from the expert to Police Headquarters and the
Lane Cove River workshops would be placed under close
observation. The Phantom Launch would only have the one remaining
harbour of refuge.</p>

<p>The only remaining harbour of refuge! The words remained
insistently in Lister's head. He was assuming the crew of the
Phantom Launch had four secret lairs around Sydney. He knew of
three of those places. Where was the fourth&mdash;Pirates' Bay.
The cross on the map had four points. Three of them coincided
with the known hiding places of the mystery boat. Did the fourth
point to the remaining harbour of refuge&mdash;Pirates' Bay?</p>

<p>Again he bent over the map. The line from Lane Cove River went
well to the west of the city, and passed down on to the coast not
far from Long Bay. It rested on the end of a squared point of
land. Did that neck of land contain at its end some cove named by
the crew of the Phantom Launch Pirates' Bay?</p>

<p>"Phelps." Lister turned suddenly to the constable. His eyes
were blazing, but his voice was quiet and restrained. "Here is
Pirates' Bay. I am certain I am right."</p>

<p>"Pirates' Bay." The constable whistled softly as he bent over
the map, following the expert's finger, and listening to his
theory. At the end of the explanation Phelps stood upright and
held out his hand. "Congratulations, Mr. Lister. I'm certain
you've solved the problem. Now, what's the game? You've got to
take the police in on this. You can't go charging down there on
your own to free Mr. Weston and his sister. You'd only be
captured&mdash;and you must remember these men will be getting
desperate."</p>

<p>There was reason in the constable's words. Austin Chosen had
counselled haste, but he had deliberately warned the expert that
the men they were fighting were dangerous.</p>

<p>Haste there had to be, to save the lives of Ysobel and Tony,
but it must be the haste of overwhelming strength, acting on
certainty of organisation.</p>

<p>"Coming, Phelps." Lister had already formed his plans.
"Where's Sergeant Miller?"</p>

<p>"Off duty. So am I. Miller's with you to the limit, but you're
not asking that the three of us attack this Pirates' Bay?"</p>

<p>"No, Lister. I'm going to communicate with Superintendent
Hanson, and ask that a force of police go down to this bay and
meet us somewhere on the road. You get hold of the sergeant, and
take him down to the boatshed. Get out the <i>Cue</i>, and have
her opposite here as soon as you can. As you go through the house
ask Ah Sam to put up some tucker in the fishing basket, also to
fill the thermos flasks with hot coffee. We may be at sea for
some hours; we may be out all night on this hunt. Get busy."</p>

<p>Phelps went off at a run. Immediately he had left the wireless
room Lister turned to the big transmitter and called Haslington.
When the wireless amateur answered, he asked him to request
Inspector Mack to communicate with Superintendent Hanson at
Police Headquarters at once. When the Sutherland amateur had
acknowledged receipt of the message, Lister tried to get in touch
with the Mystery Man.</p>

<p>He had little hope of receiving an answer. On the many
occasions he had called Austin Chosen, the mystery man had
refused to answer. To his surprise, on this occasion, he received
an immediate reply. Lister gave the facts on which he based his
theory of the location of Pirates' Bay in a few words, and
followed with his arrangements for the raid. Chosen gave a brief
acknowledgment, without commenting in any way on the expert's
reasoning, and cut out.</p>

<p>Lister had hardly reached the house when a knock came to the
front door. While Ah Sam was packing the tucker in the basket,
Lister went to the door, to admit Sergeant Miller, red-faced and
panting.</p>

<p>"Phelps is bringing the boat to the beach," the officer
stuttered as he regained his breath. "He tells me you've traced
out those Phantom Launch crooks. Good. Now, what do you want me
for?"</p>

<p>"To clean out this nest of rats," answered the expert,
briefly.</p>

<p>"I'm with you all the time." The burly sergeant's face flushed
with pleasure and he held out his big hand. "Of course, you know,
I've got to come as Mister Abel Miller. Sergeant Miller would
meet trouble if he went hunting crooks outside his district
without authority from headquarters."</p>

<p>"Come as Abel Miller." Lister took the sergeant's hand. "I've
got in touch with Police Headquarters, and Superintendent Hanson
will see that sufficient official police are there."</p>

<p>"Heard from Hanson?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. Police Headquarters are communicating with him."</p>

<p>"Then we'll wait a few minutes." The sergeant slumped into a
chair. "On what Phelps told me I got in touch with headquarters
and asked them to bring in the Superintendent to any message you
might send. You'll have him buzzing like a blue-bottle on your
'phone in a few minutes. There he is, now."</p>

<p>They raced to the study where the telephone was keeping up a
continuous jangle. Superintendent Hanson was on the line. Lister
spoke guardedly, but with sufficient detail to arouse the police
chief's enthusiasm. A few minutes and it was arranged that a
Balmoral constable was to be landed at Fort Macquarie to meet the
Superintendent, and to bring with him detailed particulars of
Lister's plans.</p>

<p>Lister fretted at the delay. While Miller got in touch with
his subordinate on duty, the expert typed out fully his
conclusions and proposed line of action, and arranged a meeting
spot with the police. He was about to sign it, when he suddenly
turned to the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Make it official, Miller," he asked, almost pleadingly.
"They'll take more notice of it at headquarters."</p>

<p>"Sure. You sign it, and I'll countersign." The sergeant
accepted the pen and scrawled a few words at the foot of the
paper. "Stone'll be here in a minute."</p>

<p>As he spoke the constable knocked at the door. Lister picked
up the basket of provisions, and led the way to the beach, where
Phelps had the launch waiting. On the way over to Fort Macquarie
the sergeant fully instructed the constable in the duty before
him, specially urging that a strong body of police be sent to the
meeting-place.</p>

<p>Lister gave a sigh of relief as Phelps pushed the little craft
from the wharf, and they headed for the tall cliffs of the Heads:
At last they were on the last trail of the hunt for the Phantom
Launch.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="first">THE <i>Cue</i> seemed to share in the enthusiasm
for the venture that animated her crew. She nuzzled down into the
long rollers that came up the harbour. Lister opened her out, and
she raced through the darkness, swiftly overhauling and passing
the various boats on the harbour. Lister gave a sigh of relief as
they passed through the Heads and met the long heavings of the
Pacific Ocean. A few more hours and he would meet, face to face,
the gang of crooks who controlled the Phantom Launch, and exact
revenge for the abduction of Ysobel Weston and her brother.</p>

<p>More, at Pirates' Bay their long trail would end. There the
many theories he and Austin Chosen had constructed around the
mystery boat and her crew would be tested. Not only the mystery
of the boat and her purpose would be made clear, but the identity
of the men who controlled her activities&mdash;men whom Austin
Chosen had declared were supermen in the world of crime.</p>

<p>Lister looked at his watch. It was just eleven o'clock. Above
them a clear sky gave them the liberty of the seas; they would
not have to feel their way down a darkened coastline. Far in
advance of them the land and sea lay in distinct shadows under
the southern night. There was little moon, and for that the
expert was glad. The men at Pirates' Bay might keep some sort of
a lookout towards the ocean. They might see the <i>Cue</i>
passing the head of their bay, but they would have only the
impression of a boat returning from some long cruise to its home
port.</p>

<p>A few lights on the shore marked the town of Coogee, and the
long stretch of pleasure beach before the town. Then came the
sand hills sheltering Maroubra. Lister kept far out to sea,
watching the shore curve towards the long, blunt-headed headland,
on the end of which he believed Pirates' Bay to stand.</p>

<p>The long line of sand ended abruptly, just before the point
was reached. A jagged hill of rock rose from the water's edge,
sloping steeply. A horn of rock came down to the waters, forcing
Lister to swing still further out, for fear of some hidden reef.
Then he came round slightly, and Pirates' Bay opened before
them.</p>

<p>From bluff to bluff Pirates' Bay measured a scanty three
hundred yards. The bay was composed of broken sandstone cliffs,
coming down straightly to the boiling waters at the foot. Lister
scanned the top of the cliffs. He could see nothing. If there was
a house, it lay well back. He swung the <i>Cue</i> for the
entrance to the bay, and shut down power. With diminishing speed
they swept into the little bay. There was no beach, and against
the foot of the cliffs could be seen the broken rocks over which
creamy masses of foam churned.</p>

<p>Moving at the slowest speed for steering way, Lister circled
the bay, keeping as close to the rocky cliffs as he dared. The
Phantom Launch was not in the bay; it would be impossible for her
to lie safely at anchor in such a turmoil of broken waters.
Impatiently, Lister turned the head of the boat seawards and came
out of the bay. He swept round the southern headland, and saw
before him the long, sandy beach of Long Bay. Edging in, he
found, some half-mile past Pirates' Bay, a place where the
<i>Cue</i> could lie safely at anchor.</p>

<p>Anchoring the boat, fore and aft, as close to the beach as he
dared, Lister and his companions waded ashore, and made for the
road that ran along the base of the long finger of land jutting
out to sea. It was now after twelve o'clock, and the force of
police from Sydney should be soon at the rendezvous.</p>

<p>A mile walk, and they found a track that led from the main
road out on the long linger of land towards Pirates' Bay. Here
they halted, and Miller took command. He sent Phelps along the
road, to see if any other road led out towards the pirates' lair.
It was imperative that they joined forces with the police from
Sydney at the earliest moment.</p>

<p>A few minutes, and Phelps returned to report that, a few
hundred yards further along, the road bent abruptly inland. There
was no sign of another road out towards the bay. Miller proposed
that they sit down where they were, and wait for the motorcars
bearing the raiding party. The wait irked Lister. After a few
minutes he rose to his feet, suddenly.</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" Miller looked up at the expert. "Thought
you'd be glad to sit down for a while. Up all last night, and
with a night's work in front of you. Me, I'm glad to be on dry
land and to sit down. I'm not saying your little boat didn't get
us here smartly; but, Mr Lister, does it ever stay in the one
position? I was either looking up to heaven or searching for a
mermaid at the bottom of the sea."</p>

<p>"Seasick?" Lister laughed slightly. "I can't sit still and
wait, Miller. I think I'll walk away towards the bay. There
should be a house somewhere about."</p>

<p>"Rank foolishness!" growled the sergeant. "You'll go and let
that crowd see you, and then there'll be the devil to pay."</p>

<p>Lister did not reply, but turned and walked slowly up the
track towards the bay. It was rough, and in the darkness he had
to proceed with some caution. The track bent and twisted in a
most bewildering manner.</p>

<p>There were few trees about; the land having the forlorn
appearance of being swept by strong sea-breezes and storms.</p>

<p>For some ten minutes he walked on, without seeing anything
worthy of note. The ground dipped slightly; when he passed the
bottom of the hollow and started to ascend again, he saw on the
sky-line what looked like a group of houses. For a moment he was
puzzled. He had seen no signs of houses from the sea. They must
be concealed behind a high cliff-edge.</p>

<p>So far as he could judge, there were three or four houses on
the slope. Lister wondered. He had decided that the land
bordering the bay was deserted, or at least held only one house,
the headquarters of the gang of criminals. Three or four houses
would destroy his theory that this bay was Pirates' Bay, and the
headquarters of the men controlling the Phantom Launch. They
would not welcome neighbours. Still he went forward.</p>

<p>There was little hope of approaching the houses under cover.
The land was bare and open, yet, Lister knew that, for the time,
he was invisible. Behind him was the long dark slope he had
descended. The pirates could not see him against that
background.</p>

<p>There was only one house; surrounding it, and some few yards
away, were a collection of outbuildings. Bending low, Lister
crept cautiously forward. He came to a wire fence, and, after a
pause, crawled through. He continued on his hands and knees,
crawling slowly forward.</p>

<p>The silence of the night was broken by the furious barking of
a dog. Lister lay still, and waited. The dog continued to bark,
and he feared the sound would rouse the inmates of the house.
Reluctantly he went back to the wire fence and crawled through.
He noticed that along the fence ran a faint path. Rising to his
feet, he went along the path, one hand resting on the top wire of
the fence. The path led almost to the edge of the cliff and
stopped. Lister peered about him. Just inside the wire the path
resumed again. It was the same path. The fence had been erected
over the path.</p>

<p>Again the path ended. Lister bent down and peered around. His
hand went to his pocket where rested his electric torch. He dared
not use it, for he was within sight of the house, and almost on
the sky-line. He went down on his hands and knees and crawled
around. The path had gone over the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>There must be a path down the cliffs to the waters below. In
the darkness of the night it would be a hazardous job to venture
it. For a minute Lister hesitated. Should he go back to Miller
and the police and return with them to the raid on the house?
Yet, this path, over the edge of the cliff might prove some way
by which the pirates could, escape while the police thundered at
the door of the house. He would go on. Perhaps he could solve the
mystery of the path and return in time to take part in the
raid.</p>

<p>CAUTIOUSLY Lister lowered himself over the edge of the cliff
and found a foothold on a narrow ledge of rock. A few yards and
the ledge widened to a narrow path. It was risky work, but he
proceeded slowly forward, and always downwards. He could feel
that the path had been used frequently. It was well worn. At
places he fancied that the hand of man had cut away some of the
obstacles.</p>

<p>At length he came to a long ledge of rock leading towards the
centre of the bay. He was now only a few feet above water level,
and the breaking spray continually covered him. Yet he went on.
The signs that the path had been in frequent use became more
apparent. Then the path abruptly ended.</p>

<p>He was standing on the edge of a ledge of rock, looking down
on the tumbling waters. Towards the face of the cliff there was a
deep blackness. Lister knelt down on the wet rock to try to
discover what the blackness meant. His hand caught on an iron bar
cemented into the rock. A rope was attached to the bar. Lister
pulled up a few feet of the rope. It was knotted every couple of
feet. Testing the knot about the bar, he lowered himself over the
edge and slid down the rope. Knots passed until he thought he
would fall into the boiling waters. Suddenly his feet caught on a
narrow ledge. It was a narrow path leading in towards the
darkness of the cliff.</p>

<p>The darkness opened, as he approached, to a large cave, into
which the waters of the bay surged in long rollers. The ledge of
rock continued into the cave. Moving with the utmost caution,
Lister felt his way in. He was only a couple of feet above water
level. At last he entered the cave, and stopped, his hand feeling
for his torch. He must have a light, even if the flash of the
torch brought a shot from the darkness.</p>

<p>The rays of the torch illuminated a large cave that ran like a
tunnel into the cliffs. The floor of the cave was covered with
deep waters, and beside them ran the narrow ledge, broadening and
gradually rising. For some yards he proceeded at a slow pace, and
then stopped suddenly. But a short distance ahead glistened the
silvery hull of the Phantom Launch.</p>

<p>He had discovered the headquarters of the gang of pirates.
Behind him lay Pirates' Bay, and above his head stood the house
sheltering the gang. Moving with caution, he crept forward until
he stood beside the mystery boat, swaying gently on the waters
and rubbing against the fenders that protected it from the rough
rock. Lister threw the light of his torch into the boat. It was
empty. He had almost expected to find Ysobel and Tony lying bound
in the well.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="first">LISTER threw the light of his torch around the
cavern. The ledge of rock ended abruptly a few yards past where
the Phantom Launch was moored. There the waters came up to the
sides of the cave; beyond jutted an outcrop of rock narrowing the
cavern up to its end, about ten yards further on. The cavern made
an ideal shelter, but Lister was unable to convince himself that
this was its sole purpose.</p>

<p>The Phantom Launch was the instrument of a gang of smugglers.
And the evidence he had accumulated, all the information Austin
Chosen had conveyed to him, showed that, whatever other uses were
made of the boat, smuggling was the main and most profitable
interest.</p>

<p>Pirates' Bay, with the House on the cliffs, and the huge cave
extending into the heart of the rocks, made an ideal situation
for smuggling. On the land side ran the main road connecting the
coastal towns with the metropolis. Lorries laden and unladen were
continually passing in both directions. It would be easy to
convey the smuggled goods from Pirates' Bay on to the highway,
and there they would be lost in the press of traffic.</p>

<p>The connection between the house and the boat puzzled Lister.
It was impossible to believe that the smugglers used the path
down the cliff. Only very small packages could he taken along
there, and then, with the continued danger of being spied upon
from some boat passing the entrance to the bay. No. There must be
some other connection between the house and the cave.</p>

<p>The Phantom Launch lay against the ledge of rock that joined
the path up the face of the cliffs. The expert had come to the
end of that ledge and found no outlet. He flashed his light
around the cave, but could see nothing. The slowly heaving waters
stretched far ahead up the cavern to the water-worn surface of
the cliff. Up there, if at all, lay the secret of the connection
between the house and the cave. In what manner did the people
from the house communicate with the launch?</p>

<p>Back at the Phantom Launch Lister found a boat-hook, and took
it to the end of the shelf of rock. He tested the water of the
cave and found it a bare three feet deep. Slipping off his shoes
and socks. Lister lowered himself into the water. It was hard
work going forward, for the tide was receding, and the pull of
the undertow almost dragged him from his foothold. He struggled
forward towards the outcrop, balancing himself by means of the
boat-hook.</p>

<p>It was not rock. Lister passed his hand over the face of the
outcrop in wonderment. It was rough-hewn boards, painted to
resemble rock. Pushing forward, Lister grasped at the rock and
found his fingers slipping to the other side. The boards were but
a few inches thick, and the hidden side was smooth and polished.
The expert looked up. The boards did not extend quite to the top
of the cave, and when lowered would rest on the shelf of rock
along which he had come into the cavern.</p>

<p>Behind the upstanding boards the shelf of rock continued,
gradually growing wider. Lister pushed on until he could grasp
the new shelf, and found the water of the cave much deeper here.
The Phantom Launch could be hauled back in the cave and loaded at
high-water times. In its present position it floated freely even
at the lowest water.</p>

<p>Lister scrambled on to the ledge of rock and walked back to
the drawbridge. Attached to the wall he found a rope sliding
through pulleys attached to the roof. He untied the rope and the
drawbridge lowered silently on the well-greased pulleys.</p>

<p>Leaving the drawbridge down, Lister advanced along the shelf
of rock. About five feet from the end of the cave he found a
fissure in the rocky wall. The roof was now sloping sharply down,
and above the fissure in the rock was barely six feet from the
floor of the shelf of rock.</p>

<p>The crack in the rocks was about four feet wide, and showed
signs of stonemason's work. In many places it had been
artificially widened, and up it had been set a flight of steps.
Lister ascended the stairway and counted fourteen steps before he
came to a thick wooden door. It was unfastened, and swung open to
his hand. He pressed the trigger of his torch, and swung the
light round a large cellar. It was of some considerable size and
faced with brick. On the opposite side to the entrance from the
cavern were two doors. A great amount of cargo was scattered
about the place.</p>

<p>Why had the cellar been bricked? For some time Lister walked
around, tapping the bricks and puzzling for an explanation. He
chanced to look up, and found the roof of the cellar boarded.
Then he remembered the rapidly sloping roof of the cavern. The
face of cliffs on Pirates' Bay was but a high standing reef of
rock, shelving rapidly on the land side. The countless ages had
piled up against the reef the inland soil. The men from the
Phantom Launch had found the reef and the house on the cliff.
They had discovered the fissure in the rock wall of the cavern,
and had turned it to account in forming a line of communication
with the house.</p>

<p>Above him stood the house on the cliffs. He was in the big
cellars the pirates had dug below the foundations to store their
smuggled goods.</p>

<p>He had to find the way to the house above. He tried the door
on the left. It was locked, and the box-lock was on the other
side of the door. He tried to force it, but the door opened
towards him, and was of sufficient strength to resist all his
efforts. Foiled, he turned to the second door. In this case the
box-lock was on the cellar-side of the door.</p>

<p>The door to the left opened on the stairs to the house above.
There could be no doubt of that. The door on the right opened
into some storage cellar. Such a reasoning would explain the
position of the locks. It would also explain the use of the
passage up the cliffs. The door from the house to the cellar was
kept locked, and was only opened from the house side. When the
crew of the Phantom Launch came to the cave, one of them had to
climb the cliffs to the house and unlock the door.</p>

<p>Lister returned to the left-hand door and listened intently
for some time. He could not hear a sound from the house. He
snapped the trigger of his flash-light and looked at his watch.
He had been absent from Miller and Phelps for over an hour.
Possibly the police had come from Sydney and were awaiting his
return to proceed with the raid. He turned towards the steps to
the cavern and then stopped. He would first see what lay behind
the second door.</p>

<p>With the box-lock on the cellar-side of the door, it was easy
to unscrew the lock from the door with the aid of a stout
penknife.</p>

<p>Ten minutes' work and the lock come from the door. It swung
open and Lister peered in.</p>

<p>The place was in darkness. Lister shifted his torch to his
left hand and took out his automatic. Then he thrust the door
open with his foot, and flashed the light around the room. It was
small, and empty except for four Indistinct bundles lying against
the further wall. At the sight of them Lister felt his heart
rising in his throat. He stepped across the room, and looked down
into the white face of Tony Weston.</p>

<p>"Sydney." A girl's voice sounded almost at his feet. Lister
swung round and the light fell on Ysobel, bound, but not gagged,
lying, close beside her brother.</p>

<p>A few cuts of the knife and the girl was free. She sat up, and
with a low cry turned to Tony. Lister bent over his chum. While
Ysobel had been lightly tied, hands and feet, Tony was trussed up
firmly, and gagged. It was some minutes' work to release him;
then Lister turned to the other men. As he half expected, he
found Austin Chosen's Chinese servant, Lou Sing, and a strange
man he guessed to be Alfred Mitchell, the Sutherland
correspondent of the <i>Pictorial</i>.</p>

<p>"Good." Tony staggered to his feet and stretched himself. "How
long have I been lying in this hole, trussed up like
long-pig?"</p>

<p>"A little over twenty-four hours." Lister smiled slightly at
Tony's calm acceptance of the situation. He was kneeling before
Ysobel, chafing her numbed hands and feet.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Pirates' Bay. Don't speak too loud." Lister was talking in
little more than a whisper. "I managed to get here through the
cavern where they dock the Phantom Launch. Outside there's a
force of police. I expect they will attack the house any minute
now."</p>

<p>"Any chance of getting Ysobel out of this before the fight
starts?" asked Weston quickly.</p>

<p>Lister thought of the dangerous climb down the cliffs. It was
impossible to think of taking the girl up that way. There
remained the Phantom Launch. They could go to the boat, but would
it be possible for him to learn the controls of the boat in the
few minutes they might possibly have before the pirates
discovered them. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Better wait a while," he counselled. "Hanson will attack any
minute. I believe he has only been waiting for me to return. When
I don't turn up he will consider I have been taken prisoner and
act promptly. There's four of us here, and we can protect Ysobel
if the gang come this way."</p>

<p>"I'll be glad of a chance at the beasts with my bare fists!"
exclaimed Tony, vindictively. "Still, if there's an iron
bar&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sound of a shot from the house above cut short the
newspaper man's speech. Lister sprang back into the big cellar
and to the bolted door. The men in the house had awakened to the
assault, and were running about, shouting and firing their guns.
The first shot had been from the house. Now came shots, less
distinct, showing that the police were not loath to use their
weapons.</p>

<p>"Lou." Lister took in the possibilities of defence quickly.
"Get over there and hold this torch. Immediately that door opens
snap the light on it. Ysobel, get to that corner behind the door.
You'll be safe from the shooting there. You chaps, see if there's
any weapons about the place&mdash;bars, or something heavy. Lou
will give you light until I call him to repel an attack."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="first">A VOLLEY of shots echoed from the rooms
upstairs. They were answered by fainter, isolated shots,
evidently coming from without the house. Then came some shouts
and the sound of men running about. Two heavy crashes shook
the foundations of the house, and above sounded the scuffling of
struggles on the floor of the rooms. The police had forced an
entrance to the last stronghold of the pirates.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice sounded loudly in the cellar. Someone was on
the steps from the house. Someone ran down the stairs and stood
at the other side of the door. Lister called softly to the
Chinese and waited. He had raised the automatic to fire at the
person coming through the door, when his hand dropped with
astonishment. The electric bulbs in the cellar roof sprang to
life.</p>

<p>Lister beckoned to Lou Sing to cross to where Ysobel and
Mitchell refuged behind the door. It was madness for the Chinese
to retain the position before the door while the lights were on
in the cellar. He would be shot down by the first man entering
the cellars. A slight sound caused the expert to look round.
Weston was standing just within the door leading to the cavern.
He had the boat-hook in his hand, and directly he saw that Lister
noticed him drew back into the shadows. Even if the pirates
managed to get past him they would have to face Weston and his
boat-hook.</p>

<p>Another footstep descended the stairs. The sound of the
struggle continued in the house above, intermingled with shouts
and cries. Lister rather wondered. He had expected the gang to
defend the house to the last gasp, and then charge down the steps
in a body, intent on flight in the Phantom Launch. If they had
followed that plan he would have held the advantage of surprise.
The police would be close on their heels, and he could have held
them for the invaluable few minutes.</p>

<p>Two men were standing at the other side of the door. Lister
was puzzled. Very slowly he gave ground, retreating towards the
door leading to the cavern. He wanted to get within touch of
Weston and consult with him.</p>

<p>He had only just reached the door to the cavern when the house
door opened and a man stepped into the cellars. Lister drew back
into the shadows and raised his automatic. The man was Mostyn
Delaney. Lister remembered the man from the many photographs
published a few years back.</p>

<p>The man closed the door behind him and stood listening. This
puzzled Lister. What had happened to the second man who had
descended the stairs? At length Mostyn looked round. He stared
straight towards the door to the cavern. Lister wondered if he
had made any sound that had caught the man's attention. The
attitude of the man gave reason to believe he was suspicious.</p>

<p>Ysobel was crouching in a far corner of the room, the Chinese
servant standing before her. Lou Sing had his eyes fastened on
the inventor. He was slowly crouching down, his limbs gathering
under him. At length Mostyn Delaney moved a step forward and the
Chinese sprang. The inventor hardly struggled. He fell to the
ground, the Chinese on top on him. Before Lister could reach the
two men Lou Sing had his captive bound and gagged, and was
dragging him to the corner of the cellars where the girl
crouched.</p>

<p>"Good man!" Lister whispered. He seized an arm of the captive,
and helped Lou Sing to draw him to the corner. "Now, if those
beggars come down one at a time we can bag the lot."</p>

<p>What had happened to the man behind the door? He must be still
there. Possibly he had heard the slight sounds of the struggle,
and was waiting to gather information as to who was in the
cellar. Lister caught the eyes of the Chinese, and motioned
towards the door. The man nodded and crept silently forward. As
he put his hand on the door and pushed it shut, Lister motioned
to Ysobel to go into the inner cellar. She would be safe
there.</p>

<p>A scurry of feet, and the sounds of a door being beaten down,
came from the house above. A rush of feet on the stairs, and the
door was violently flung open. As the first man entered the
cavern, Lister fired at the electric bulb, plunging the place in
darkness.</p>

<p>An exclamation, of surprise, followed by a deep silence.
Lister retreated to the cavern door and joined Weston. There was
a long wait. Lister was satisfied. So long as he could keep these
men undecided; and puzzling over the danger in front of them, the
police would have the opportunity to overtake them.</p>

<p>A ray of light came from a far corner of the cellar, and
rested on the men huddled in the doorway. Almost immediately it
disappeared. Lou Sing was not idle. He had crawled noiselessly
from behind the door to where he could focus the flashlight on
the men. One of the gang fired a shot. Lister immediately shot at
the flash of the gun and a howl of pain answered his shot. Again
Lou Sing flashed the light on the crowd, and was answered by
indiscriminate firing from the door. Lister had no more
compunction. He was shooting as rapidly as possible into the
darkness, helped by the intermittent light from Lou Sing's
torch.</p>

<p>The shooting suddenly ceased, and for a moment deep silence
lay over the cellar. From above continued the sounds of the
struggle. The police were breaking down some door, or barricade,
shielding the head of the stairs. In a few minutes they would
come charging down into the cellars behind the pirates. Lister
was determined to hold them in their present position of
indecision as long as he could. He wondered what had happened to
the Chinese. His work with the torch had been invaluable. Now, at
the critical time he had failed. Had some chance shot reached
him?</p>

<p>The pirates had come to realise that only one man faced them.
An indistinct shuffling and murmuring showed that they were
gathering courage for an attack. Lister waited, and recharged his
automatic. He would want every shot in his gun when the men
charged.</p>

<p>Suddenly the darkness was split by a volley from the pirates
crowding the doorway. Something stung Lister above the elbow. He
put his automatic under his arm, and touched the spot with the
fingers of his left hand. They came away warm and sticky. He
tested bending his elbow. It was only a graze, but his hand felt
unsteady, and sharp twinges shot through the nerves.</p>

<p>The sudden charge of the pirates caught Lister off his guard.
They were on him before he could get at his automatic. He was
swept against the wall, coarse hands clutching at his throat and
limbs. Then came a momentary relief. Weston and Mitchell and
charged into the fight, shouting loudly. Lister was able to shake
himself free of his assailants, and back towards the door leading
to the cavern. A voice at his elbow told him that Weston was by
his side.</p>

<p>Suddenly the electric globe glowed again. For a moment the
fight was stopped. Lister looked round amazed. He had broken the
glass with a bullet. Then he understood. Lou Sing's absence was
explained. He had gone into the smaller cellar and had replaced
the globe on the holder.</p>

<p>The sudden glare of light had caused the pirates to draw back.
Lister looked at the pirates curiously. He saw five men on their
feet confronting him, threateningly. On the floor, by the door
lay three men, two of them nursing wounds, and the third lying
silent and still.</p>

<p>One of the pirates barked out an order to charge. Lister
retorted by shooting the man through the shoulder from the
shadows of the cavern door. This caused a momentary halt; before
the men could act, the door from the house was flung violently
open, and Inspector Mack entered the cellars, followed by a
number of police.</p>

<p>"Hands up, the lot of you!" The Inspector strode forward. Then
his eyes fell on Lister. "Good heavens! It's you that held this
crowd back until I managed to break down that confounded
door?"</p>

<p>The revolvers of the police officers cowed the pirates. They
were herded back into one of the corners and disarmed. Mack came
towards the cavern door against which Lister was leaning, sick
and tired.</p>

<p>"Wounded, eh? Jove, you chaps put up a great scrap&mdash;and
with only one gun, too. Well, well!"</p>

<p>"Guard that door, Mack." Weston turned from tying up Lister's
wounded arm. "Syd says the Phantom Launch is down there."</p>

<p>"What's there?" The Inspector stared in astonishment. "We
wondered what had happened to you, but it seems you've made good
use of some happy chance."</p>

<p>"There's a big cavern down there with a natural shelf of rock
along one side," said Lister faintly. "The Phantom Launch is tied
up to the shelf."</p>

<p>"Anyone there?"</p>

<p>"Not when I came through. There's a path over the cliff from
near the end of the wire fence. You'd better have that
guarded."</p>

<p>"Not a hope," laughed the Inspector. "Thanks to you chaps
we've got the whole bunch. If you hadn't defended these cellars
they'd have got away in that infernal boat of theirs."</p>

<p>"Where's Francis Hawson?" asked Lister quickly. He had been
looking over the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Hawson's cashing in," the Inspector answered gruffly. "He was
shot at the beginning of the fight. Hanson and the doctor are
upstairs with him.</p>

<p>"What doctor?" Lister spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"One from Long Bay." Mack looked curious. "Why, what doctor
did you think was here?"</p>

<p>Lister did not answer. He and Ysobel were ascending the stairs
to the house behind the Inspector. Before them lay the final
chapters of the mystery. Already he was guessing much. The
capture of the gang would test many of his theories, and bring
forward the evidence that would make for a plain tale.</p>

<p>"Go in here, Lister." Mack opened the door of a bedroom.
"There's a bathroom opening out of here. I'll send the doctor to
attend to your arm. Miss Weston, will you come with me. Mr.
Austin Chosen is waiting in the big room for you."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE constable outside the door of the room stood
on one side for Lister to enter. He found himself in a large room
occupying most of the rear part of the house, on the cliffs
looking out over the seas. The long French windows were open, and
on a lounge before one of the windows lay Francis Hawson, slowly
panting out the life he had so wilfully misused.</p>

<p>A small table had been drawn close to the side of the couch.
At the head of the table sat Sir George Benson, the New South
Wales Commissioner for Police, and beside him Superintendent
Hanson and Inspector Mack. By the couch, half-reclining in a deep
chair was Austin Chosen, dividing his attention between the dying
man and the Commissioner. In a further corner, of the room were
seated Ysobel, Tony, and Mitchell. The expert crossed the room
and sat down by the girl. He was wondering what was to happen.
The doctor had come to him in the bedroom into which Mack had
shown him, had bandaged his arm, and insisted he lay down and
rested until he was required by the police.</p>

<p>"Police inquiry." Tony leaned across his sister to whisper to
Lister. "Irregular, of course, but Austin Chosen wanted
it&mdash;and he usually gets what he wants. He says we can best
clear up the mysteries here. Besides, Francis Hawson is dying,
and the doctor refuses to allow him to be moved."</p>

<p>Lister nodded, but did not answer. He was looking at the group
of prisoners, clustered in another corner of the room under a
strong guard of police. Did Austin Chosen expect to get any
valuable evidence from them? It did not seem probable. They
looked to be only tools of the master-brain.</p>

<p>A short interval, and the door opened again, and Mostyn
Delaney, under charge of a police constable, entered the room. He
stood blinking in the doorway for a moment. Then, at a sign from
the Mystery Man, he crossed the room and sat down by Tony
Weston.</p>

<p>"I am about to hold a short inquiry into the causes that led
up to this raid." Sir George spoke, abruptly. "First, I have
information from Mr. Austin Chosen that only by such action can
we get to the bottom of many happenings that have mystified us.
Dr. Lloyd, also, informs me that it will
be&mdash;er&mdash;exceedingly dangerous to move
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Hawson, and that it is advisable to, at once,
take any statement he may wish to make. Ahem! Mr. Chosen suggests
that I shall go further and examine certain other persons. He
believes that it may be necessary to confront them with Mr.
Hawson, and&mdash;er&mdash;he believes that it will
be&mdash;impolitic&mdash;er&mdash;to wait. I may add that, as
regards the latter statement, I have Dr. Lloyd's assurance that
delay will be&mdash;ahem&mdash;ahem&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Commissioner paused and looked at the doctor, seated
beside the dying man's couch. Austin Chosen turned slowly in his
chair and took Francis Hawson's hand.</p>

<p>"Francis&mdash;Francis Delaney." Lister wondered to hear the
thin voice so calm and gentle. "The end of the trail is near. Is
there nothing you have to say to smooth the road for
yourself&mdash;and those you leave behind?"</p>

<p>Hawson lay for some moments, without stirring. At last, he
opened his eyes and looked round the room. Very slowly they
passed from face to face, until they rested on Austin Chosen. A
faint spark of interest shone in the eyes, and a slight smile
parted the bloodless lips.</p>

<p>"Going, am I?" The words were accompanied by a little trickle
of foamy blood, bubbling from the lips. As the Mystery Man did
not make any sign, Francis turned to the doctor. The man nodded,
slowly.</p>

<p>"You've got to help Mostyn, you know." Chosen beckoned the
inventor to come to the side of the couch. "The police claim he
is the owner of the Phantom Launch, and accessory to the murder
of Gideah Brading at Yaney's Inlet."</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" The dying man spoke with some return of his
old arrogance. "Mostyn built the launch. He invented it, and
built it with my money. I gave it to him, and he let me have the
use of it when I wanted it. He didn't know the use we made of
it."</p>

<p>"What use?" Sir George asked the question, quietly.</p>

<p>"The use any wise man will make of a super-speed boat, to beat
the Customs of a protective country." For a moment a gleam of
amusement flashed in the tired eyes. "Jove, the Phantom Launch
could travel!"</p>

<p>A glance of understanding flashed between the Mystery Man and
the Commissioner. The latter sat back with a shrug of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Frank." Again Austin Chosen took the thin, weak hand. "Time
is short. Tell the Commissioner of your life. What happened to
Matthew Hawson's will? And where is Wallace Pettington?"</p>

<p>"Wallace?" Hawson strove to raise himself on his elbow. "You
know that? I always said you were a wonder, Austin. Wallace
boasted you could not get behind the blind he had erected, but I
didn't believe him. So you know of Wallace. He's been a good pal
to me, in spite of all they say against him."</p>

<p>"Start at the beginning, Frank. Go slow, for your words have
to be written down&mdash;for the sake of those who come after
you."</p>

<p>The dying man made a motion, and the doctor placed a glass of
liquid to the working lips. He drank, thirstily, and then lay
back with closed eyes.</p>

<p>"Suppose you want me to go back to when I first met Wallace
Pettington. That's where all the bother dates from, although I'm
not going to allow that Wallace was to blame. Did you guess,
Austin, why I always favoured Melbourne against Sydney?"</p>

<p>The man lay back silent for some minutes. "Funny there should
be such a big barrier between the two places," Hawson continued,
speaking to himself. "A man can have the time of his life in
Melbourne, and not a word of it filter through to Sydney, if he's
careful. I found it useful."</p>

<p>"To deceive Matthew Hawson?"</p>

<p>"The old boy was too strait-laced. Of course, it was good of
him to adopt me. He could have chosen Wilfred, but he had
wandered off on his own and might have taken some finding. Then,
there was Mostyn, but he had his head in the air with his
inventions. Uncle Matt called it waste of time and wouldn't have
anything to do with him."</p>

<p>"What of Evelyn Hawson's children?" interjected the Mystery
Man.</p>

<p>"Aunt Evelyn. She was a good sort, but of course old Matt considered that his elder sister's children had first
choice&mdash;or, rather, he should choose from the elder sister's
children. That made it a sure thing for me, with Wilfred out in
the world on his own. Anyhow, the old man thought so. I was in
clover, and I considered I was due for a good time. Never thought
he'd expect me to stick around Myollongowera all the time, like
he did."</p>

<p>"So that's why you favoured Melbourne against Sydney?" asked
Sir George, abruptly.</p>

<p>"That's so. I found I could have a roaring time down there,
and not at word of it known in Sydney. Uncle Matt never went to
Melbourne. His home town was Bourke, and at times he went to
Sydney for the Royal Show, and those old duds. Small chance of
his hearing of my doings in Melbourne. Besides, I took
precautions."</p>

<p>"How?" Austin Chosen asked the question.</p>

<p>"I was known as Gerald Preston, in Melbourne." Francis
answered the question, quietly. "At first I kept my own name,
Francis Delaney, although Uncle Matt, had made me assume his
name, 'Hawson.' Then I came in touch with Wallace Pettington. I
took a great fancy to him, and he liked me. It was he who
suggested that I use the name 'Gerald Preston' when I hit the
high lights."</p>

<p>"Tell the story fully, Frank." Chosen's voice was low, but
insistent. "There's not much time, old man."</p>

<p>"No." The man motioned towards the glass. "You know all the
preliminary, now. Matthew Hawson had two sisters, Mary and
Evelyn. Both of them married, and both had children. Mother
married Charles Delaney and her children were Wilfred, who went
off on his own when he was about sixteen, Mostyn, who became a
crank on engineering, and myself. Old Matt never had any
children, although he married. When his wife died, he looked
around his sisters' children to pick an heir. He picked me; said
I was Hobson's choice, for he couldn't give Evelyn's children a
chance until he had exhausted Mary's brood. Uncle Matt made me
his heir and took me to Myollongowera. I got away and made things
hum in Melbourne. Then, I came across Wallace Pettington. He was
out for a good time, and we coupled up. That was a long time
before the Central Australian Bank."</p>

<p>"What made the break between you and Matthew Hawson?"</p>

<p>"Someone put me away. I don't know who, but Uncle Matt wrote
me about some girl who said she had a claim on me. From his
letter I could see that he had been making inquiries. He wrote he
was docking my allowance to make it up to the girl. That was
hell. I was head over ears in debt and didn't know where to turn
for money. I just had to have it&mdash;so I took it."</p>

<p>"You forged old Matt's name?" suggested the Mystery Man.</p>

<p>"Not necessary." Francis grinned slowly. "Old Matt enclosed a
cheque for the balance of my allowance. It was just half. The
other half he had paid over to the girl. All I had to do was to
alter the amount. It was easy, and I thought it would lie until I
could manage to straighten it out. But the old man seemed to be
right on my heels. Within a week he had found out about the
cheque, and old Archdale Staines wrote me a formal, stiff letter
stating old Matt was making a new will and that I was not
mentioned."</p>

<p>"What then?" The Commissioner asked the question
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Wallace Pettington, then," Francis Hawson answered almost
impudently. "I told Wallace what had happened and he proved a
real spur. Somehow or other he managed my creditors, and there
were quite a few of them. Then he put me into the Central
Australian Bank. But I wasn't fitted for that game. I just
couldn't sit at a desk and juggle figures. I had to be out with
the bright lights&mdash;and that was expensive.</p>

<p>"Suppose you played about with the bank's money?" The
Commissioner spoke grimly.</p>

<p>"Cash was necessary." Francis Hawson made a pitiful attempt at
jauntiness. "Yes. I took money belonging to the bank, and I
wasn't the only one by a long chalk. Still, Wallace stuck to me.
I believe he would have kept me at the bank, but for the fact
that Uncle Matt died."</p>

<p>"You had been disinherited?" stated Sir George.</p>

<p>"Wallace looked after that." A slight flush rose to the man's
cheeks. "I heard of old Matt's death and didn't think it
concerned me until Wallace told me to go to Myollongowera and
take possession. He said he had arranged matters and that there
was no new will. I was old Matt's heir."</p>

<p>"That all? You knew there was a later will?"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask questions. It was good enough that I had
inherited. I wasn't worrying how. Still I thought the conditions
Wallace set were peculiar."</p>

<p>"What were they?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't to go into Bourke more than I could help, and I was
on no account to go to Sydney. When I wanted a holiday. I was to
come straight to Melbourne&mdash;and be Gerald Preston
again."</p>

<p>"So you went to Myollongowera. What part did you have in the
Pettington Frauds?" Austin Chosen asked the question.</p>

<p>"First I heard of it was from the newspapers. I wired Wallace
at once offering help, and saying I was coming to Melbourne. I
got a queer reply. I was to come to Melbourne, but I was not to
go near him. I was to assume my identity as Gerald Preston, and
await orders."</p>

<p>"You obeyed those instructions?"</p>

<p>"People don't disobey Wallace. I thought they were queer, but
I knew Wallace had brains, and I'd do anything for the old
fellow. I was in Court throughout the trial and nearly cried when
he was sentenced. Jove, it was clever the way he escaped."</p>

<p>"You had a hand in it?" Superintendent Hanson leaned forward,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Wallace sent me a message to have a fast motor-car at the
doors of the Court every day of the trial, and directly the Court
rose, to go and sit in it until he arrived. I was to drive it
myself, and be prepared to go to Myollongowera at once. I watched
him come out of Court day after day, and never make a sign
towards me. I sat and listened to him being sentenced to fifteen
years in goal, and watched him go out of Court in the hands of
the warders. Then I went out to the motor-car and wondered what
was going to happen. Presently a queer-looking lawyer chap came
along and got in the car. I had the shock of my life when
Wallace's voice ordered me to get to it quick. I nearly gave the
show away in my surprise. Later, he told me he had one of the
gaolers bribed. When he was taken from the Court he was placed in
a cell where the disguise was hid. A quarter of an hour later he
was let out of the cell by his friend, and led out into the
streets. It was easy."</p>

<p>"Wallace Pettington went with you to Myollongowera," suggested
the Superintendent. "How long did he stay there?"</p>

<p>"Why, we was there until-" Hawson broke off suddenly, and
glanced round the room. "He was there until a few days ago."</p>

<p>"Dangerous," observed the Commissioner. He could hardly help
smiling. The man's obvious admiration for one of the biggest
criminals in Australian history was almost laughable. "His
connection with you must have been known to the Melbourne police,
and they would certainly have your station watched?"</p>

<p>"Wallace provided for all that." Francis Hawson turned
restlessly on the couch. He was failing fast, and his speech was
thickening. "He, and I, put up a joke that made matters
absolutely waterproof."</p>

<p>The door of the room opened sharply, and Archdale Staines
entered.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p class="first">FOR some moments Archdale Staines stood just
within the door, looking around the room. Then, with a bow to the
Commissioner, he came forward and seated himself at the table.
For a fraction of time the eyes the lawyer and the Mystery Man
met. Austin Chosen smiled slightly and turned to bend over the
dying man.</p>

<p>"What was the joke you put up on the police, Frank?" asked the
Mystery Man.</p>

<p>"Oh, that," Francis Hawson moved tiredly. "Wallace and I are
something of the same build and colouring. He suggested that we
should dress and shave alike. Then he got me to copy some of his
mannerisms, and he copied some of mine. It got so that we grew
quite alike. Of course, anyone seeing us together would notice
differences, but strangers, or casual acquaintances would have
mistaken one for the other."</p>

<p>"All this time you avoided going into Bourke, or down to
Sydney?" asked Austin Chosen, with a quick glance at the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"Wallace held me to the compact. When he came up to the
station he insisted that I should never go into Bourke. When I
wanted to go down to Melbourne I had to motor across country to
some railway town where I was not known, and travel as Charlie
M'Gee, the manager of Myollongowera."</p>

<p>"Who attended to the business in Bourke? You had your legal
and your banking business there?" asked the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Why, Wallace, of course." Hawson looked up in some surprise.
"He was in and out of Bourke all the time."</p>

<p>Archdale Staines jumped to his feet and looked across at the
dying man, in some surprise. He was about to speak when Austin
Chosen silenced him with an imperative gesture.</p>

<p>"Mr Wallace Pettington visited Bourke as Charlie M'Gee, the
manager, while you, when you went for a holiday, avoided going
through Bourke and travelled to some strange town, appearing
there under the name of Charlie M'Gee." The Mystery Man made the
statement with a quiet smile of satisfaction on his lips.</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand," broke in the Commissioner. "How
could they do that? They were certain of detection. Surely the
bank, or the station's legal adviser&mdash;le me see&mdash;for
Mr. Archdale Staines, was it not&mdash;would want to see the
owner sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Staines will explain that?" Austin Chosen looked
direct at the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawson visited my offices frequently on business of the
properties." The lawyer spoke dully. "I can also assure you that
Churchland, the manager of the local bank, had frequent
interviews with Mr Hawson. We both know him well. I have lately
been informed that Mr. Hawson is&mdash;er&mdash;seriously unwell.
I suggest his memory is failing him."</p>

<p>"Let it pass. The truth will be made clear. There is still
much for Francis Hawson to explain. Frank, what of the Phantom
Launch?"</p>

<p>"It belongs to Mostyn." Hawson was speaking with some
difficulty. "Wallace and I were always interested in Mostyn's
experiments, and believed something good would come out of them.
While old Matt was alive I managed to find the money to carry old
Mostyn on. Sometimes it was it tight squeeze, and then I'd go to
Wallace and get him to advance something. But we always managed
to keep him going, and he won out at last."</p>

<p>"How did Wallace Pettington get hold of the boat?" asked
Inspector Mack, curiously.</p>

<p>"He used to go to Sydney to see Mostyn and his workshops. One
day, instead of going straight back to Melbourne, he came up to
Myollongowera. He was excited."</p>

<p>"Mostyn had invented the Phantom Launch?" asked Austin
Chosen.</p>

<p>"He'd got on the track of it. I was the owner of Myollongowera
then, and was willing to spend a bit to give the old boy his
chance. Wallace wanted to join in. He could see further than I
could. He had seen Mostyn drive a boat with an engine that could
be packed in a suitcase, and without accumulators or connections
whatever. Absolutely silent, too. Wallace swore by it."</p>

<p>"Of course. Wallace Pettington had some unique idea for using
such an invention?" Sir George spoke, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"It was a great scheme." Hawson turned towards the
Commissioner. "He'd thought out a smuggling scheme on a big
scale. His idea was to build two of Mostyn's launches. One to
operate in Australia and the other in the United States. Then, by
arrangements with some of the tramp steamer captains, who were
not particular where the money came from, we could pass dutiable
goods from one country to the other, free of all Customs. I
didn't see the possibilities at first, but when we got it working
it paid&mdash;by Jove, there was money in it!"</p>

<p>"That's why you went to America?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Wallace sent me over with the plans of the Phantom
Launch, to get one built over there, and to put it in the right
hands. I had just about got matters settled when Mostyn wrote to
me. He wanted to see me at once. It was a queer letter, and I was
anxious about the old chap. I cabled Wallace I was coming home,
and he replied to meet him in Melbourne."</p>

<p>"He didn't meet you?"</p>

<p>"No. There was some hitch. He told me, later, he had lost his
pocketbook with some important papers in it, and had to go to the
police. When he didn't turn up at the shift I went on to Sydney.
I knew Wallace would be angry, but I had to see Mostyn as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>"Wallace Pettington, missing you at Melbourne, came to Sydney
by train, and then went out in the Phantom Launch to take you off
the mail boat?"</p>

<p>"You guessed that?" Hawson smiled quietly. "Yes. He took me to
some place up Middle Harbour. I was to get into Sydney the next
day and pick up the motor-car, and drive by some roundabout way
to Myollongowera. I messed the plan. When I found the hue and cry
after me, I funked the job and hid."</p>

<p>"What drives the Phantom Launch?" Inspector Mack leaned across
the table. "You say the motive power could be contained in a
small suitcase?"</p>

<p>"The dynamos at the Lane Cove River workshops. The Phantom
Launch takes her electricity through the air." There was almost
triumph in the dying man's voice. "Mostyn won out. His boat is
all he claims; but he knows nothing of the use we put it to. You
believe that, don't you?"</p>

<p>"What are the wooden boxes hidden in the sands for?" Lister
leaned forward and asked his first question.</p>

<p>"Something new old Mostyn got at. He had an idea that the
broadcasting and commercial wireless stations threw a lot of
energy onto the air. His idea was to gather it in those
boxes&mdash;and between the wooden walls they're full of wires
and valves&mdash;and relay it on to the Phantom Launch. It didn't
quite work, but he would have found the secret in time."</p>

<p>The man lay back on the couch, with his eyes closed, his face
drawn and white. From the half-opened lips welled a growing
stream of blood. The doctor pushed Austin Chosen to one side and
bent over the dying man. As he straightened himself, after a
brief examination, he caught the Commissioner's eyes.</p>

<p>"Can't do any harm, Sir George." The medical man answered the
unspoken question. "Only a wonderful vitality has held him to
life so long."</p>

<p>Austin Chosen reached to the table and brought the glass of
tonic to the man's lips. A few minutes, and he opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>"It isn't too bad," he gasped. "I thought&mdash;Say, Austin,
you won't&mdash;let them&mdash;Mostyn, y'know."</p>

<p>"I'll look after him." The Mystery Man was bending low over
the man. "Francis, one more question. "Who murdered Gideah
Brading?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't&mdash;know."</p>

<p>"Did Wallace Pettington murder Gideah Brading?"</p>

<p>"No. He&mdash;he was&mdash;with me at&mdash;at Middle
Harbour&mdash;all&mdash;all&mdash;that&mdash;night."</p>

<p>The man's head sank low in the pillow. A convulsive shudder
shook the sturdy frame, and from the mouth and nostrils spurted
streams of blood. The muscles related slowly, and the mouth
dropped open.</p>

<p>Francis Hawson was dead.</p>

<p>For some minutes the men sat round the table in solemn
silence. They were waiting for some move from Austin Chosen. He
sat beside the couch, his face bowed in his hands. At length, he
roused himself and turned to the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"I think there are still a few blanks to fill in, Sir George,"
he commenced in a low tone. "Mr. Archdale Staines can explain the
happenings at Bourke."</p>

<p>"I?" The old solicitor bent forward, curiously. "It is true, Sir George, I am the solicitor for the Hawson estates and for the
late Francis Delaney Hawson, but I think you will agree with me
that much of the tale we have listened to is past belief. For one
thing, Mr. Hawson stated that he never visited Bourke. I can
assure you he was frequently in the town, and visited my offices
on each occasion."</p>

<p>"Do you recognise Francis Hawson?" Austin Chosen's quite voice
broke on the heated speech of the solicitor. "Archdale Staines.
Is it not a fact that when you visited the Sydney Central Police
Court a few days ago, you saw Francis Delaney Hawson for the
first time since his manager, Charlie M'Gee, that was Wallace
Pettington, came to Myollongowera?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"At the Central Police Court you swore that Francis Hawson
came to you in Bourke three weeks previous?"</p>

<p>"He did!"</p>

<p>"You heard him say that at that time he was on the high seas
coming into the port of Melbourne. You know that it was proved
that Francis Hawson travelled from London to Australia on the
S.S. <i>Arathusa</i>, and, therefore, could not have been in
Bourke at the time stated?"</p>

<p>"There is some mistake. Francis Hawson saw me as I have
stated."</p>

<p>"Francis Hawson swore in your presence that he never went to
Bourke or Sydney?"</p>

<p>"He lied. He was frequently in Bourke, passing through on his
way to Sydney."</p>

<p>"You say that each time he made the journey he stopped in
Bourke to see you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When you saw your client at the Central Police Court did he
look any different to when you saw him at Bourke, three weeks
previous?"</p>

<p>"He looked strange&mdash;pale and ill&mdash;and very drawn in
features."</p>

<p>"You would not have recognised him but for the situation? I
suggest that if you had met the man out in the streets of Sydney
you would have not recognised him."</p>

<p>"I might not. He looked terribly altered. I put the alteration
down to illness and worry."</p>

<p>"The Francis Delaney Hawson you saw in Bourke was a robust,
arrogant man?"</p>

<p>"What are you driving at?" Archdale Staines half-rose from his
chair.</p>

<p>"Let it pass for a moment." Austin Chosen smiled quietly. "How
many times did Charlie M'Gee, the manager, come into Bourke to
see you?"</p>

<p>"I do not remember that he ever came to see me."</p>

<p>"Do you know anyone in Bourke who could identify Charlie M'Gee
from personal acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"I do not think so," the solicitor answered after a very long
pause. "Are you suggesting-"</p>

<p>"Are you aware that the police have verified the late Francis
Hawson's statements that he was in the United States of America
and England during the past eighteen months? Are you aware that
they have irrefutable proof of these statements. Come round the
table, Archdale Staines. Is this the body of your late client,
Francis Delaney Hawson?"</p>

<p>For some minutes the old solicitor bent over the calm, still
body. At length, he straightened and faced the Commissioner. His
face was white&mdash;almost as white as that of the corpse by
which he stood.</p>

<p>"Sir George," he said slowly, "I never thought&mdash;I assure
you, I had no idea-"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Staines?" The Commissioner spoke
nervously.</p>

<p>"Let me explain," interposed the Mystery Man. "You will
remember, sir, Francis Hawson swore he never visited Bourke nor
Sydney. He swore he was pledged to Wallace Pettington to that
course. He swore his manager, Charlie M'Gee, alias Wallace
Pettington, frequently visited Bourke and Sydney. You have seen
how anxious Wallace Pettington was that Francis Hawson should not
visit Sydney; so anxious that he broke the Customs and health
regulations to prevent Francis Hawson landing in Sydney Harbour.
Against that place Mr. Staines' statements, backed by those of
the sergeant of Police at Bourke, that Francis Hawson was
frequently in Bourke. There is a direct contradiction only
explainable by-"</p>

<p>"You mean, Mr. Chosen-"</p>

<p>"I mean that the Francis Hawson so frequently in Bourke and
Sydney was known on Myollongowera as Charlie M'Gee, alias Wallace
Pettington, escaped convict."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p class="first">"WALLACE PETTINGTON posed in Bourke and Sydney
as Francis Hawson? Impossible!" The Commissioner laughed
uneasily. "I will grant you that he might have done so on one or
two occasions, but a systematic campaign of impersonation would
be certain to fail."</p>

<p>"Yet the systematic assumption of the character of Francis
Hawson was Pettington's greatest safeguard," answered the Mystery
Man, shortly. "We cannot get away from the proved fact that
Francis Hawson was outside of Australia during the past eighteen
months. You will remember Francis Hawson's statement that Wallace
Pettington persuaded him to agree to such personal changes as
would make for a dual identity. I have photographs of Francis
Hawson taken in Bourke that show he was almost Francis Hawson to
the life. You will remember that from the time Francis Hawson
inherited the properties he was never allowed to go into Bourke.
Thus, when Wallace Pettington escaped from custody in Melbourne,
he had a clear field to pose as Francis Hawson in Bourke and
Sydney. No, Sir George; once having assumed the character his
safety lay in carrying it through for all time. Had not this
happened, and had Francis Hawson died naturally, at
Myollongowera, it is certain Wallace Pettington would have
assumed the character for the rest of his life; sure of himself
and of the reputation as Francis Hawson he had built up carefully
in New South Wales."</p>

<p>There was strength in Austin Chosen's reasoning. Slowly the
truth forced itself against the prejudices of the three men
around the table. Twice Sir George cleared his throat to speak,
and stopped. At length he turned to Austin Chosen.</p>

<p>"Who owns Myollongowera Station now, Mr. Chosen?"</p>

<p>"That is a question I would like Mr. Staines to answer." The
Mystery Man looked across the table at the lawyer. "Did Francis
Delaney Hawson leave a will?"</p>

<p>"No." A startled look came in the old solicitor's face. He
looked around him as if seeking some means of escape. "Mr. Hawson
was a comparatively young man, and unmarried. He had not thought
of making a will, although I spoke to him more than once on the
subject."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mostyn Delaney would, in that case, inherit, I presume,"
suggested the Commissioner, carelessly. "Although the question is
not within the corners of this inquiry. Now we have Mr. Hawson's
statement, I presume there is no further object to be served by
staying here. Superintendent Hanson?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Sir George." Austin Chosen interrupted
swiftly. "I beg of you to carry this inquiry a still further
distance. I believe we can clear up fully the remaining mysteries
at this sitting, and possibly identify the ex-convict, Wallace
Pettington."</p>

<p>"If you can do that, and clear up the mystery surrounding the
murder of the man Brading at Yaney's Inlet, of-"</p>

<p>"Those points and the connection of Wallace Pettington with
the Hawson family," added the Superintendent quickly. "I am not
satisfied with the information in that connection."</p>

<p>"First, we will ask Mr. Archdale Staines to produce the last
will and testament of Matthew Hawson. The will he suppressed to
allow Francis Delaney to inherit the properties," suggested
Austin Chosen in a low voice.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" The Commissioner asked the question,
glancing at the lawyer, who had sprung to his feet.</p>

<p>"Mr Staines understands me well."</p>

<p>"There is no will. Matthew Hawson made a will disinheriting
his nephew, but destroyed it."</p>

<p>"That is untrue." Austin Chosen spoke unemotionally. "With
almost his last breath, just before you entered this room,
Archdale Staines, Francis Hawson swore he inherited his uncle's
property through your success in suppressing the second
will."</p>

<p>"There is no will in existence." Staines had fallen back in
his chair, a sullen expression on his face.</p>

<p>"The will is in your possession at this moment, Archdale
Staines." The Mystery Man's voice was low and insistent. "What
part has Wallace Pettington in the Hawson estates?"</p>

<p>"Wallace Pettington?" The old lawyer looked up with denial in
his eyes. Something in the expression of the man facing him
altered his intention. With a groan he dropped his head to his
hands. "Wallace Pettington saved me from my madness."</p>

<p>"You embezzled money of your clients to gamble on the
Melbourne Stock Exchange?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! You know that?" The old man sprang to his feet. "It
is written a man's sins shall stand ever before him. Yes, I took
the money entrusted to me in a mad attempt at sudden fortune. I
lost it."</p>

<p>"Then?"</p>

<p>"Then I came to my senses. I realised for the first time what
I had done. I saw what I had to face and I was afraid. Never
shall I forget that night in my room in the Melbourne hotel. I
sat and faced a future that held only death. I had made up my
mind to it. The pistol was in my hand when that man saved
me."</p>

<p>"Saved you. At a price. What price, Archdale Staines?" The
tones of the Mystery Man cut clear and emotionless through the
tense silence.</p>

<p>"The suppression of Matthew Hawson's will disinheriting
Francis Delaney."</p>

<p>"And the terms?"</p>

<p>"The man was cunning. He lent me the money. Tempted me with
secrecy, and with the possibility of winning through without sin.
I thought I could succeed&mdash;and failed."</p>

<p>"The terms?" Again the words were spoken in a tone full of
insistence.</p>

<p>"Wallace Pettington lent me the money at the current bank rate
of interest. It was repayable by yearly instalments, or&mdash;"
The old man bowed his head on his arms and groaned.</p>

<p>"Or?"</p>

<p>"In full, on the day anyone but Francis Delaney inherited the
Hawson estates. Matthew Hawson was a hale and hearty man at that
time. I thought he would live for many more years. I intended to
work hard and pay up the money and regain my freedom
before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Matthew Hawson died some months after the loan was made to
you. Wallace Pettington called on you for the return of the full
sum, or to place Francis Delaney in possession of the Hawson
estates. You could not have repaid the money you borrowed on the
day Matthew Hawson died?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Therefore, to save yourself, you suppressed the last will of
your client, Matthew Hawson, and allowed Francis Delaney to
succeed to the estates from which he had been disinherited. What
would you have done, Archdale Staines, had Francis Delaney died,
appointing by will an heir other than the one mentioned in
Matthew Hawson's will, now in your breast pocket?"</p>

<p>"I would have produced the last will of Matthew Hawson, at
whatever cost to myself."</p>

<p>"Would you?" The Mystery Man sat back in his chair and stared
hard at the old solicitor. "I believe you would, Archdale
Staines."</p>

<p>There was silence for some seconds. Then Sir George cleared
his throat loudly.</p>

<p>"Where is Wallace Pettington?" The Commissioner leaned forward
in his chair. "Wallace Pettington was convicted of frauds in
Melbourne eight years ago. We now know how he escaped, and went
to Mr. Hawson's station, Myollongowera, near Bourke, and there
posed at the manager, Charlie M'Gee, and at the same time assumed
the identity of his protector in Bourke and Sydney. We have
learned that Wallace Pettington was the instigator of intrigues
surrounding the Hawson estates and family. We again hear of him
as the head of the smuggling enterprise connected with the
Phantom Launch, but we do not seem to be able to place our hands
on him. Where is Wallace Pettington?"</p>

<p>"Here." The one word came from the corner of the room where
sat the prisoners taken in the raid on the house, under guard of
the police. A stocky, carelessly-dressed man sauntered to the
table, and stood facing the Commissioner.</p>

<p>For a moment the men at the table were too surprised to act.
Inspector Mack was the first man to recover his poise. He jumped
from his seat and strode over to the side of the man naming
himself Wallace Pettington. The Commissioner impatiently waved
him back.</p>

<p>"You are Wallace Pettington?"</p>

<p>"The name will serve." The master criminal shrugged his
shoulders indifferently. "I have answered to it."</p>

<p>"You are Wallace Pettington." There was a strangeness in the
Mystery Man's voice. "What is your interest in the Hawson
estates, Wallace Pettington?"</p>

<p>"The interest Austin Perry, alias Austin Chosen, assumed to
have." The answer was defiantly flung back.</p>

<p>The Mystery Man laughed lightly, and turned to the
Commissioner. "I will substantiate this man's statement, Sir
George. This is Wallace Pettington, the runaway brother of
Francis Delaney. Let me introduce him by his real name, Wilfred
Delaney."</p>

<p>"Wilfred Delaney?" The Commissioner puckered his brows. "Let
me see. The matter is becoming so involved that-"</p>

<p>"Wilfred Delaney is the elder brother of the late Francis
Delaney and Mostyn Delaney. He disappeared from home in his
youth. He betrayed himself by the very great interest he took in
his brother Francis's affairs."</p>

<p>"And yourself, Mr. Chosen. I believe this man called you
'Perry'?"</p>

<p>"I am Austin Perry, half-brother of Frederick Weston, who
married Evelyn Hawson, the younger sister of the squatter,
Matthew Hawson. My interest in the Hawson estate is that I was
the legal guardian, up to their coming of age, of Anthony Weston
and Ysobel Weston, the joint heirs of Matthew Hawson under the
will suppressed by Archdale Staines at the instance of Wallace
Pettington."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p class="first">THE sounds of a fast-driven motor-car broke on
the silence that fell on the room with the Mystery Man's final
announcement. Wallace Pettington stood at the foot of the table,
defiantly facing the Commissioner. Austin Chosen had risen from
his chair, and was watching the master criminal anxiously.</p>

<p>"Mostyn." The voice of the master criminal came soft and clear
through the silence. "Mostyn, they are trying to steal your
boat."</p>

<p>"Eh?" For the first time Mostyn Delaney spoke, rising from the
foot of the couch, where he had crouched since his brother's
death. "My boat! Where is it?"</p>

<p>"In the cave. Take care! They want to steal your boat,
Mostyn."</p>

<p>Mostyn Delaney was on his feet, staring wildly around the room
Austin Chosen caught him by the arm and pulled him down to his
seat. For a moment the inventor gazed vacantly around; then he
appeared to lapse into his former lethargy.</p>

<p>"They will steal your boat." Very softly the master criminal
breathed the words. Before Inspector Mack could utter the protest
on his lips, the man turned sharply to Austin Chosen. "You asked
for Wallace Pettington. I am he. What do you want with me?"</p>

<p>"Wallace Pettington!" The Mystery Man leaned forward across
the table. "Who killed Constable Smith?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" The man stood erect, arrogantly defiant.
"Why not ask me who killed Gideah Brading?"</p>

<p>"The murderer of Gideah Brading anticipated you in the act by
a few hours. You wrote the note that sent the man to Yaney's
Inlet. You placed the notes in the wooden box hidden under the
bluff. When you came to the Inlet you found Gideah Brading dead;
not killed by the box of chained lightning Mostyn Delaney had
invented, but by some unknown and mysterious hand. You found a
police officer watching the scene. You came in the Phantom
Launch, and he traced you to the Old House. You shot him down,
and, to conceal your crime and preserve the secret of your
shelter on the inlet, you carried his body to the bluff and there
left him. Every step of your actions has been traced, Wallace
Pettington."</p>

<p>"You've got to prove that, Austin Perry. I admit nothing. For
the time the luck of the frame is with you. Who knows? There is
always a tomorrow. Tomorrow may be my-"</p>

<p>"There will be no tomorrow, Wilfred Delaney." There was deadly
earnestness in the Mystery Man's tones. "Long have you avoided
payment for the crimes you have committed. Even if the charge of
murder cannot be fastened on you in this State, the police of
Victoria wait in Sydney to carry you back to the punishment you
have avoided for over eight years. What further charges-"</p>

<p>"The morrow dawns!" The master criminal's voice rang clear and
sharp through the room. "For the moment you hold me, but the
Phantom Launch and the man who made it have escaped you.
Look!"</p>

<p>The man was pointing to the French windows. For the moment
Austin Chosen was puzzled. Then he noticed that Mostyn Delaney
was not in the room. The warning of the master criminal to the
half-witted inventor came to his mind. "They are stealing your
boat, Mostyn." With a startled exclamation he sprang to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Mack! Quick! The Phantom Launch! Mostyn's gone to the Phantom
Launch!"</p>

<p>The Inspector sprang to the door, almost overthrowing Wallace
Pettington from his path. For a few minutes there was confusion.
Lister made for the open windows. He had almost reached the
veranda when he was brushed roughly to one side and the figure of
the master criminal sprang out into the open. For a brief moment
he stood free. His carefully-laid plot, culminating in a bold
dash for freedom, had almost succeeded. With a mocking laugh he
turned and looked back at the bewildered men in the room; then he
ran swiftly towards the corner of the house nearest the path down
the cliffs.</p>

<p>It was a daring dash for freedom, and for the moment Wallace
Pettington appeared to have an even break. If Mostyn Delaney had
gone to the Phantom Launch, and the master criminal could gain
the path down the cliffs, then it was possible that he might get
away in the wonderful speed-launch Lister gained his feet and
started in pursuit, closely followed by the police streaming
through the windows.</p>

<p>Pettington had a fair start. He arrived at the corner of the
house just as Lister came to his feet. As he reached it a man
appeared, coming: on to the veranda. Lister uttered a cry of
warning. The man appeared to take in the situation at a glance.
With a cry of rage he sprang at the master criminal's throat, and
the two men fell to the ground. For a moment they were a tangle
of twisting arms and legs. Then Pettington sprang to his feet
with a cry of triumph, and sped towards the cliff edge. The other
man lay on the veranda boards, stunned and bleeding.</p>

<p>At the edge of the cliff the master criminal paused and looked
around him. The slight delay at the corner of the house had been
sufficient to bar his way to freedom. Already the police were
coming from the front of the house. Wallace Pettington was
surrounded. For the moment he was free, standing looking out over
the mighty ocean. A few more minutes and the hand of the law
would clutch him and take him to the punishment he had so long
evaded.</p>

<p>The man stood motionless, watching the police approach. In his
hand be held a long bladed knife. Almost automatically he raised
it at the approach of the constables, daring them to come closer.
He had retreated to a small pinnacle of rock, almost overhanging
the edge of the cliff. One false step and he would fall over, to
be dashed to pieces on the rocks guarding the entrance to the
cavern.</p>

<p>"There goes the Phantom Launch." Wallace Pettington waved a
triumphant hand out to sea. "Mostyn and his boat have
escaped."</p>

<p>From the cave under the cliffs the Phantom Launch darted
straight out to sea. Silently and swiftly it sped out, straight
towards the heart of the Pacific Ocean, and at the helm stood the
mad inventor, his face turned towards the watchers on the
cliff.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Austin Perry." Again the master criminal spoke.
"Again you are right; there is no tomorrow for me. We shall never
meet again."</p>

<p>For the moment he stood, watching with calm arrogance the knot
of police officers a few feet away, hesitating to grapple with
the man who would drag them to a certain death over the
cliff.</p>

<p>With a contemptuous shrug of his shoulders, he tossed the
bloodstained knife high in the air, and watched it circle down to
the rock below. Then, with a final wave of his hand, he stepped
forward, into eternity.</p>

<p>There was no need to hurry to the foot of the cliffs. Wallace
Pettington had walked to a certain death.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, the little group turned back to the house. On
the veranda lay the stricken man who had foiled the master
criminal's daring attempt at escape. The doctor had completed his
examination, and stood back with a significant shake of his head.
The man looked round him uncertainly, and then up at the grave
face of the doctor.</p>

<p>"Finis, isn't it?" He laughed slightly, a laugh that ended in
a groan. "You needn't tell me. I know."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Austin Chosen was kneeling by the wounded man's
side.</p>

<p>"Who are you? No. I know. You're the man I had to
watch&mdash;the man, Austin Chosen&mdash;the guesser of secrets.
Tell me, Austin Chosen, have you guessed my secret?"</p>

<p>For a moment the Mystery Man knelt, silent. Then, in a low,
Impressive voice. He spoke:</p>

<p>"Ten years ago there lived a struggling medical practitioner
in one of the suburbs of Melbourne. Chance ordered that a
relative should die and leave this man a fortune of a few
thousand pounds. On the strength of that fortune the man set up
as a specialist in the heart of the city. He married, and thought
there opened before him the road to success. Time passed.
Ill-health dogged him. His growing practice dwindled; his
investments failed. The fortune that had seemed so great grew
smaller and smaller, while his expenses increased alarmingly.</p>

<p>"Himself, wife, and child, ill and in need of expensive
attention, the man resolved to risk the remains of his fortune in
one great throw for the money he needed. He came in touch with a
man who claimed he could foretell the Stock Market. The doctor
ventured cautiously, and at first won small amounts. Anxious for
the wealth that meant health and comfort for those he loved, he
risked all on one throw of the dice of Fortune.</p>

<p>"The next day he learned of the disappearance of the man on
whose word he had trusted the remnants of his fortune. The bank
in which the man was a trusted servant closed its doors. The
doctor was ruined&mdash;more, his brain gave way under the shock,
and for weeks he lay unconscious of the ultimate blow fate had
dealt to him. When consciousness came he learned that wife and
child had passed from him into the Great Unknown.</p>

<p>"Alone, poor, and friendless, the doctor wandered from the
scene of his ruin, bearing in his heart a bitter hatred of the
man who had betrayed him. Years passed, and the flame of that
hate was never allowed to die. Almost he prayed God, or devil, to
deliver his enemy into his hands."</p>

<p>"He did." A smile lighted the eyes of the wounded man. "Austin
Chosen, you have read my heart. Gideah Brading was the man. I am
the doctor, Angus MacDermott."</p>

<p>"I know." There was infinite sadness In the Mystery Man's
voice. "Will you continue the story, or shall I?"</p>

<p>"What is there to tell?" A spark of vigour came into the
dimming eyes. "Vengeance was mine&mdash;and I fulfilled."</p>

<p>"Your enemy came to you&mdash;and you recognised him, though
he failed to recognise you. You sent him from you while you
prepared the drug that should bring him to his death. Speak,
Angus MacDermott, that, when you have passed into the Great
Beyond, others may not be accused of your sin."</p>

<p>"I gave him poison, in the form of a lotion, to cure the
broken blister on his hand. He thanked me for
it&mdash;and&mdash;and I watched him&mdash;go&mdash;with laughter
in&mdash;my heart. My enemy&mdash;had
been&mdash;delivered&mdash;into&mdash;my&mdash;"</p>

<p>Austin Chosen closed the staring eyes with gentle fingers, and
stood up. For a moment he stood with bowed head beside the body
of the man who had claimed life for life.</p>

<p>The mysteries that had gathered around the Phantom Launch were
solved. One by one he had traced them to their conclusion. Over
eight long years the trail had wound, years in which he had
sometimes faltered, almost hopeless of bringing to the light of
day the secret evil of the great master criminal Wallace
Pettington&mdash;once the innocent boy, Wilfred Delaney.</p>

<p>Almost blinded by the sudden rush of thought he put out a
groping hand, to have it clasped in a warm, firm grip.</p>

<p>"Steady, Uncle Austin. Tony's here." The newspaper man slipped
his arm around the waist of the Mystery Man. "Best thing is to
get you home as soon as possible. This excitement is bad for
you."</p>

<p>"Where is Ysobel?" The girl he named and loved as his niece
meant much to him.</p>

<p>"Afraid in future you'll have to take me as a substitute."
Tony grinned, affectionately at the drawn face resting against
his shoulder. "Ysobel appears to have other things to mind."</p>

<p>He pointed out towards the edge of the cliff. There walked
Ysobel Weston, heiress of Myollongowera and half a dozen of the
richest stations in the State, and by her side Sydney Lister,
who, with Austin Chosen, had regained for her the wealth of which
she had been defrauded.</p>

<p>They were not thinking of wealth and stations. Their minds had
passed from the bleak tragedies of the past days in which they
had played their allotted parts. Days of trials and tribulations
had melted into the glorious dawn of a tomorrow in which the one
great mystery was life and love.<hr>
