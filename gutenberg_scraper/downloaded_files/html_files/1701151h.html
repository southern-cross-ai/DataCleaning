<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">DETECTIVE-INSPECTOR Saul Murmer approved of
Australia. He had come to the island-continent under an agreement
between Scotland Yard, London, and the New South Wales Police
Department for the exchange of officers, for mutual experience. He
had had a certain reluctance in leaving London for a city that was
merely a name&mdash;for a country of which he had read little and
had only vague impressions.</p>

<p>During the war he had mixed with a number of Australians on
"Blighty" leave to record the impression that Australians were
unmitigated liars, when discussing their native land. He had
listened to yarns that he knew were "tall"; stories well told but
causing broad grins on the faces of the countrymen of the narrator.
From his reading he had to believe that Australia was a convict
settlement&mdash;even in the Year of Grace 1932.</p>

<p>He knew that the Australians had no literature for, after his
appointment to the detective branch of the New South Wales police
he had searched London bookshops for Australian books. He had found
books that purported to be Australian, but they had been published
in England, and the tone of the writing showed him that the authors
had lived long enough in his country to assimilate an atmosphere
decidedly English.</p>

<p>Against that he had learned from the records of New Scotland
Yard that Australia had long ceased to be a convict
settlement&mdash;that if any convicts remained on that country's
soil they must be very old men. Someone had advised him to go to
Fleet street and gather in Australian newspapers. He had done so;
his reading of them had caused him to wonder still more. Either the
newspapers from the capital cities of the Commonwealth were drier
reading than the <i>Times</i> of 30 years before, or they rivalled
the famous "Yellow Press" of the United States of America.</p>

<p>A friend had introduced him to certain books professing to
describe the bushranging era of the pre-Commonwealth days. They had
been interesting, but he desired to know the Australia of today,
not the Australia of fifty years ago.</p>

<p>On the voyage out to Sydney he had placed his perplexities
before a fellow-voyager&mdash;an Australian returning home after a
world tour.</p>

<p>Frank Mardyke, a Sydney journalist-author, had laughed heartily.
In the resultant conversation he had explained, with a note of
bitterness in his voice, that London publishers were, for some
reason, unwilling to even consider an Australian novel of the
present day. To Murmer's amazement, Mardyke had seriously stated
that in his country were quite a number of first-class authors who
could not obtain a public hearing. Though their books were equal to
the English average, the importations of fiction books kept them
off the Australian market.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer landed in Sydney to be impressed with the size and
importance of the city. On the voyage round the coast from Perth he
had had opportunities to visit other cities, of smaller size but
well equipped and entirely modern. He had reported to the detective
branch at police head-quarters, in Central Lane, to find that the
men he would associate and work with for the next twelve months
were as alert, intelligent, and as well grounded in modern
criminology as his former associates at New Scotland Yard. He was
attracted to Inspector John Pater, with whom he would work.</p>

<p>After a couple of small investigations he came to the conclusion
that crooks in Australia were as clever as any in those parts of
the world he had visited. Superintendent Dixon, head of the
detective branch, had welcomed him warmly, yet with a certain
surprise he barely concealed. Murmer had grinned secretly. He knew
his physical appearance was against him. He was short, barely
passing the height standard of New Scotland Yard; his tendency to
embonpoint accentuated his lack of stature. His face was round and
almost hairless and his light-blue, wide eyes gave him an innocent
baby-stare that had often caused him embarrassment. What little
hair still adorned the top of his head was light and curly. Even a
conscientious use of the remedies recommended by various
hairdressers and newspaper advertisements had failed to compel it
to grow thick, and to lie smooth and slick.</p>

<p>He did not look like a detective. His Chief Constable had once
referred to him as "the baby in long pants." Murmer had realised
the phrase had been used good-humouredly, but it stung. His great
secret ambition was to be able to wear hard-crowned bowler hats and
the ability to roll rank-perfumed black cigars from side to side of
his mouth with a flick of his lips, scowling meanwhile on
evil-doers from hard, compelling eyes. In effect, he could only
smoke the mildest of cigarettes, and his lips were a Cupid-bow of
scarlet that he knew many girls secretly envied him.</p>

<p>Gradually Sydney absorbed him. He acquired the habit of
strolling the streets of the city and suburbs, while off duty,
scanning the people with whom he came in contact; watching the
faces of the houses and the traffic in the streets&mdash;streets
that seemed never to pursue a straight course. They twisted and
turned at almost impossible hills, winding over hills and valleys
that forced him to the conclusion that, in regard to fat men,
Sydney was only fitted to those who possessed cars. It contained
far too many hills.</p>

<p>Yet, as the days passed, he became more and more fascinated with
the city that claimed to be the Queen City of the Southern
Hemisphere. He liked it; he was beginning to love it. Almost he was
coming to view with regret the end of his term of exchange&mdash;to
the day when he would mount the ship's gangway for the journey back
to England.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory Eascham, Chief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police,
had told him he was going to Australia to gain experience. In the
Chief Commissioner's office he had met Detective-Inspector Arnold,
the New South Welshman who was taking his place at New Scotland
Yard. A fine, tall, soldierly man, looking much more like a
detective than himself. He had sighed. Why had not Nature given him
a presence like that? Arnold would have no trouble in subduing the
crooks he arrested for himself, all he could do was to use some
trick to throw them, and then sit on their chests until help
arrived. One gentleman of fortune had bitterly complained, after
arrest by Inspector Murmer, that the torture-press of the Middle
Ages must have been but a child's plaything.</p>

<p>Inspector John Pater, a bachelor, had taken him from Central
Lane to his flat at King's Cross. The apartment was comfortable and
not too expensive. In answer to his questions, Murmer had found
that a similar flat in the building was to let. He had immediately
booked it, moving at once from the hotel where he had located on
arriving in the city. The hotel-manager had found him a woman who
did his cleaning after a fashion; he had developed unexpected gifts
as a cook, when he did not choose to go to one of the nearby
restaurants for his meals.</p>

<p>All in all, he was comfortable and happy. Walking eastwards from
his new home he found pleasant and unexpectedly beautiful, if
somewhat hilly, strolls along the harbour banks and amid houses and
people that intrigued. He felt that all he now required to make
matters Australian perfect was a big, intricate case that would
prove to his new associates that he was worthy of his salt. So far
they had, comradely, taken him on trust.</p>

<p>Inspector Saul Murmer was thinking lightly on inconsequent
matters as he strolled through Edgecliff one summer's evening. He
had been two months in Sydney and had acquired a good, working
knowledge of New South Wales police procedure. He thought of his
former mates at New Scotland Yard, then glanced down at his light
calico suit and unbuttoned waistcoat and grinned. Sure it was hot;
damned hot&mdash;and those fellows at the Yard would be gathering
around any little bit of heat that offered, cursing their luck when
they had to venture into the streets, huddling in great-coats and
stamping their feet on the pavements as a they went along. It was
hot!</p>

<p>He turned the corner of Wonthaggi Avenue&mdash;what queer names
they gave their streets! Rather a decent road. Good class houses.
People living here must have a bit of money. Not much in the matter
of front-gardens, considering all the waste lands there were in
Australia. Suppose they had a good bit of land behind the houses.
Of course, so much nicer to have a big garden than&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;good evening!" He nodded to the constable who had just
saluted. Didn't know the man; but quite a number of them knew him.
He had met them about police headquarters and the courts. Of
course, those he had a met had pointed him out to their mates. The
Pommy detective! 'That's the fat Inspector from England!' Sure,
that's how they'd describe him. Still, it was useful&mdash;one
never knew when one might chance on anything&mdash;to know the
pointsman. Queer, that door being open! Murmer glanced down at the
illuminated face of his wrist-watch. Just on midnight! People, even
in Australia, didn't leave their front doors open at midnight.
Perhaps someone had gone down to the pillar box.</p>

<p>No, there it was on the other side of the road, and there wasn't
a person on the road now. He searched the shadows for the
patrolman, but he had a evidently turned some corner on his
beat.</p>

<p>Detective-Inspector Murmer glanced up at the face of the house.
Not a light showed. The street-door was half open and there was no
light in the hall. He dragged a cigarette from the packet in his
jacket pocket and thoughtfully lit it. Again he glanced up at the
face of the house.</p>

<p>He had the impression that someone was watching him. Waiting for
him to move on. Something was wrong in that house. Again he looked
back down the street, in the direction in which the constable had
passed. There was no one in sight. Yet again he glanced up at the
face of the house. He believed that within that house was something
requiring investigation.</p>

<p>The path between the gate and the hall-door was a bare ten
yards. Three steps led up into a porch over-shadowing the door. The
house was of two storeys, with a high-peak roof that might contain
a third storey&mdash;an attic. Murmer pushed back the door and
glanced into the hall. It was dark and still. People didn't go to
bed and leave their hall doors open, even in Sydney. They didn't go
to bed without a preliminary survey of doors and windows, to see
that they were properly secured.</p>

<p>Then he descended the steps and walked down to the gate. Still
there was not a soul in sight. He returned to the hall door and
pushed it fully open.</p>

<p>Within the house was only dense darkness. Taking his torch from
his pocket he flashed the light on the door-frame. A moment, and he
had located the bell-push and thrust his thumb on it firmly. He
could hear the bell ringing within the house. No one answered.</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, undecided what to do, then laughed
shortly. Someone had gone out and left the door open. Possibly they
had thought they had pulled it shut, but the latch had caught and
the door blown open. Perhaps he was imagining things. Should he
shut the door and go on home? It was getting late.</p>

<p>Almost with the door-latch connecting the socket he hesitated,
thrusting the door open again. That would not do. Again that queer
sense, that things were not right in that house, possessed him.
Well, after all, he was a police officer and carried full
credentials. He would look through the house before he left it.</p>

<p>Still he hesitated. He had met the patrolman about twenty yards
before the gate of this house. Why had not the man noticed the open
door? It was his duty to see that everything was secure on his
beat. If the door had been open then. But, if anyone had come out
of that house, on to the road after the constable had passed it, he
could not have failed to see them.</p>

<p>Murmer strode into the hall, his torch blazing a path before
him. A moment and he had located the light-switch. The light
flashed on, almost blinding him. The hall was well-furnished. Four
doors around him opened into rooms. Beyond the staircase was
another door, possibly opening into the offices of the house.</p>

<p>Methodically he opened door after door, switching on the lights
and surveying the rooms. They were handsomely furnished, and
unoccupied. In the dining room he found a table set for two
persons. On it were the remains of a supper. One of the
wine-glasses had been upset and a dark stain straggled across the
white linen. A thin trickle of liquid had run over the edge of the
table and dripped to the ground. He returned to the hall and called
aloud; then listened. There was no answer. Again he called, with no
result.</p>

<p>He went to the stairs and mounted them. As he came to the
landing a light flashed on in one of the rooms. He strode to the
door of that room and thrust it back&mdash;to exclaim in
astonishment.</p>

<p>On a couch, pulled well forward into the room, sat a young girl,
about twenty years of age. For a moment Murmer stood and stared at
her. Beside her, on the couch, lay her outdoor garments, and in her
hand she held a close-fitting hat. Murmer thought there was alarm
in the eyes raised to his.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, miss. Are you the owner of this house?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened." The Inspector came a step into the room.
"I'm a police-officer, and I found your front door open. I called
out in the hall but I couldn't make anyone hear."</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;call?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing. Called more than once. Didn't you hear me? Say, are
you the occupier of this house?"</p>

<p>"N-o!"</p>

<p>"Who is?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanley Griffiths, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Inspector Saul Murmer, miss." The police officer stared about
the room inquisitively. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I came here to see Mr. Griffiths."</p>

<p>"At this hour of the night?"</p>

<p>The girl flushed. "We'd been to the theatre&mdash;Mr. Griffiths
and I. I&mdash;I am his personal secretary, and he asked me to come
here to get some papers wanted at the office tomorr&mdash;this
morning. Mr. Griffiths said he wouldn't be at the office until very
late." The girl spoke glibly.</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Griffiths?" asked Murmer.</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;know!"</p>

<p>"Did he leave you here?" The Inspector paused. "How long
ago?"</p>

<p>"About ten minutes ago&mdash;it may be a quarter of an
hour."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"He went to get the&mdash;the papers."</p>

<p>"Then he's gone out of the house?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so!"</p>

<p>Murmer looked at the girl in perplexity. She was
nervous&mdash;very nervous. He disliked the little trick she had of
halting before the last word of her sentence. Somehow it gave him
the impression that she was not telling the truth.</p>

<p>"Well, where do you think the papers are? I've searched the
ground floor, and there's no one there."</p>

<p>"Have you looked in his bedroom?"</p>

<p>"Where's that?" Instinctively the detective turned to the
corridor.</p>

<p>"The room opposite."</p>

<p>"That's in darkness."</p>

<p>"He went in there." The girl paused for a long minute. "I heard
him."</p>

<p>In the doorway, Murmer looked back at the girl. Why had she sat
there, her hat in her hand, throughout his inquisition? Her voice
had been flat, expressionless, throughout his questioning. He
believed she had lied. For what reason? Had she a right to be in
the house? Had she found the street door open, and had come in to
thieve? He shrugged. The place was not normal. As he went to the
door opposite the room where the girl sat he glanced back over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"You'd better come with me."</p>

<p>"All right." Slowly the girl rose to her feet and turned to pick
up her wraps. Murmer noticed that she wore a long, white, floating
evening gown that came to her ankles. Impatient at her slow
movements he went to the opposite door and flung it open. He felt
for the light-switch and pressed it. A globe over the bed came to
light. He glanced round the room, then back at the girl now
standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Mr. Griffiths is not here?"</p>

<p>"He must be." A hint of alarm came in the girl's voice. "He came
in here; I'll swear to that. I heard the door close.
Perhaps&mdash;perhaps he's fainted&mdash;on the opposite side of
the bed. He has a safe somewhere there.
Please&mdash;please&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>With a shrug of disbelief Murmer strode round the bed. There was
no one on the floor there. He looked back to the girl&mdash;to see
the door closing; to hear the sound of the key turned in the lock.
With speed remarkable for a man of his build, he ran to the door,
to find it locked. Through the wood he could hear light feet
speeding down the stairs.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR Saul Murmer's first impulse was to throw
his weight against the door and burst it open. A moment and he
recognised the futility of such action. He was on the wrong side of
the door to exert any leverage on the lock. He bent down and peered
into the keyhole. The key was still in the lock. He felt in his
pockets; there was nothing in them that could help him. He
shrugged. After all he was only a detective in real life; not one
of those super men from a novel, who carried habitually a
collection of burglar tools, without a thousand to one chance
against using them in a life-time.</p>

<p>"Slick!" He straightened, and scratched his head. Then he
remembered and went to the mirror, trying to flatten his hair from
the rebellious curls.</p>

<p>"Well, what's to be done now? Sure that girl's got the wind up.
Wonder why? Perhaps she thought I'd ask her name and address, and
broadcast it to New South Wales scandal-mongers that I'd found her
in a man's house at midnight. Umph. Maybe that!"</p>

<p>He glanced about the handsomely furnished room, then went to the
window and threw up the sash. The window overlooked the gardens at
the back of the house. They lay, dark and drear, under the faint
night light. The next house was some distance away and not a light
gleamed in any one of its many windows. From the window the wall
dropped sheer to the ground more than thirty feet below&mdash;too
far for a man to jump.</p>

<p>He turned back into the room and switched on all the lights. On
the table by the bed stood a telephone. Here was a chance! But, was
the telephone connected direct with the exchange or working on a
house switch? If the latter, then the girl had no doubt
disconnected the instrument. He had to chance that. Yet&mdash;what
a let down. Detective-Inspector Murmer, of New Scotland Yard, to
have to call the police to free him from a room in which a slip of
a girl had locked him!</p>

<p>With his hand on the telephone Murmer thought quickly then
lifted the receiver and dialled a number. A long wait, and then a
voice sounded on the wire. "Get me Mr. Pater&mdash;Flat 5, please.
Important!"</p>

<p>An indistinct murmur and then silence. Nearly five minutes
passed before the Inspector recognised a voice speaking through the
instrument.</p>

<p>"That you, John? Saul speaking. I'm in a house up Edgecliff way.
Something queer here. Where? Wonthaggi avenue&mdash;but I'm damned
if I know the number. You'll find the front door open&mdash;about
fifty yards from the harbour corner of the road. A two-storey
place. Yes, I'll wait for you."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and turned again to examine the room.
Damn that girl! He'd never hear the last of it! The joke would be
too good for Pater to keep to himself. The London 'tec locked in a
bedroom by a girl! They'd swear he was burglarising the house and
want to charge him&mdash;more than likely there'd be some
foolery&mdash;holding a mock trial on a house-breaking charge and
sentence him to death or some such rot!</p>

<p>Again he returned to the door, examining the lock. A short
search of the room followed and he found a pair of scissors and a
newspaper. He opened the newspaper widely and slipped it under the
door, out into the passage. Then with the scissors, he juggled the
key in the lock until the wards were vertical. Still more careful
work and the key fell on to the newspaper in the passage. Drawing
the newspaper into the room he was able to get the key.</p>

<p>So far good. Now he could tell Peter just what he wished of what
had happened. There would be no ragging, or nonsense. Taking the
key from the lock, after he had released the bolt, he placed it in
a drawer. It was nothing for locks in a house to be without
keys.</p>

<p>Instinctively his feet led him to the room where he had found
the girl on first entering the house. He switched on the light and,
as he moved into the room, stopped, suddenlyimmobile. His eyes had
gone to the couch on which the girl had been seated. It was still
far from the wall into the room&mdash;a strange place for a couch
to be. The article was chintz-covered with a deep valance hanging
down the front, almost touching the floor. Something projected from
under the chintz.</p>

<p>He looked again, his eyes staring with a dawning of fixed
horror. The tips of the fingers of a man's hand. Only the top
joints, unnaturally white and still, and he recognised that it was
the left hand of a man.</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, then advanced cautiously, his quick
eyes searching suspiciously about the room. He came to the couch
and stopped, staring down at the fingers. A moment, and he lifted
the valance, exposing a man's hand and forearm. On the little
finger of the hand shone light from a big diamond ring.</p>

<p>Murmer stepped back a pace and scanned the couch. The girl had
been seated here when he had entered the room. Her long wide skirts
had spread out and hidden the jutting hand. She had talked to him,
Inspector Murmer, while she had sat quietly over the body of a dead
man.</p>

<p>Dead? Yes, he had reason to believe that. The hand was
unnaturally still and bloodless. Advancing a step, the detective
dropped to his knees and touched the flesh: it was still warm, but
there was something in the feel of the skin that indicated
death.</p>

<p>Murmer gained his feet and with his eyes measured the space
between the back of the couch and the wall. He went round the couch
and looked down. One of the man's legs stuck out into the room,
exposed almost to the knee. Then, the man had been standing before
the couch when he had been killed&mdash;and the couch had then
stood against the wall. He had fallen directly before the
couch&mdash;and the girl hearing his shouts in the hall, and his
footsteps on the stairs, had pulled the couch forward to cover him.
And the girl had sat on the couch, calmly talking to him, while the
man lay beneath, dying or dead!</p>

<p>Careful not to disturb the body, Murmer moved the couch back to
its proper position against the wall, placing the castors in the
old marks on the carpet. He went to the bedroom and found the
newspaper. With some scraps of the paper and pins, he marked where
the couch legs had been, when the article had stood over the dead
man. Now he turned to the dead man.</p>

<p>From his position Murmer deduced that he had been standing
before the couch when he had been killed. He had fallen against the
edge of the couch and rolled to his present position. Murmer bent
over the man, puzzled. Against the white of the neck was a glint of
metal. He moved the head and found a small ornamental dagger,
presumably of silver, driven right up to the hilt in the thick
neck.</p>

<p>For a moment the detective was puzzled. What sort of dagger was
this? Then realisation came. It was one of those trinkets girls had
adopted to decorate their coats and hats. Surely a small, frail
thing to ensure death.</p>

<p>On his knees Murmer examined the wound and the dagger carefully,
trying to reconstruct the death-scene. The girl and the man had
been alone in the house, in that room together. He remembered that
the girl had said that she and the man&mdash;Arthur Griffiths, she
had called him&mdash;had been to the theatre together. He had told
her to come to his house to get some papers required at his office
early the next morning. At the house the man had given the girl
supper. Then in some manner he had induced her to come to this
upstairs room. What then?</p>

<p>Murmer directed the light of his torch on the dead man's face
There could be no doubt as to what had then occurred. Death had not
obliterated the signs of the man's character from his face. When he
had got the girl up to this room he had tried to entice her into
his bedroom&mdash;tried to take advantage of her position in the
vacant, silent house at that hour of the night. She had resisted
and&mdash;Now Murmer remembered the nervous, fidgety manner in
which she had played with her hat while she had talked with him.
The dagger was one of those ornaments girls decorated their hats
with&mdash;or stuck on the lapels of their coats. Hat or coat!
Either; what did that matter? There was the use to which it had
been finally put.</p>

<p>A frail, slight thing for a weapon to cause a man's death. So
frail and slight that but for its position, and the corpse, he
could hardly have believed it could have caused death. Chance had
held the girl's hand to drive it straight and true. The man's
flesh, puffed and bloated with evil living, had offered little
resistance. Chance had decided that in its progress to death it
should avoid bone and muscle! Death by misadventure!</p>

<p>The detective shrugged. He slipped his hand beneath the man's
dress shirt, feeling the flesh. The skin was still warm. So far as
he could judge the man had been killed a few minutes before he,
Murmer, had entered the house. Certainly not after, for he would
have heard the man exclaim when the silver had pierced his neck,
and he had heard no sound in the house before he had found the
girl.</p>

<p>But&mdash;why had the street door been open? Who had gone out of
the house? Leaving the dead man and the room undisturbed, Murmer
went down to the street door. There was no one in sight. He went on
to the street gate. As he reached the pavement a furiously-driven
taxi swung into the road. At his sharply upraised hand it slid to a
stop with a shrieking of brakes and John Pater sprang out.</p>

<p>"What the matter, Saul&mdash;pulling a man out of his bed at
this hour of the night?"</p>

<p>"Murder!" Murmer turned, to the taxi-driver. "Take a sprint
round this block and try and find the patrolman on this beat. Bring
him back with you and wait here. Not a word to anyone, or we'll
have you down at police headquarters and grill you.
Understand?"</p>

<p>With a beckoning gesture he led the way to the house. In the
hall, with the door shut, he turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"A hell of a mess, John," he said with a slight laugh. "I saw
the door of this house standing open as I was strolling up the
road. As it was after midnight I thought it worth investigating.
Came in and found the house apparently empty. Found signs of a
supper-party for two, in the dining room. Then went upstairs. Found
a room with a light, and in it a girl sitting on a
couch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A girl? Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Just what I'd like to know." Murmer became embarrassed. "She
fooled me absolutely. Told me she was waiting for a Mr. Stanley
Griffiths." Pater nodded, understandingly, as his comrade paused.
"She seemed nervous; but I put that down to my walking in on her
unexpectedly. She told me that Griffiths had gone to his
bedroom&mdash;the room opposite where I had found her&mdash;to
fetch some papers. I went in search of him and&mdash;and&mdash;damn
it, you've got to know, John, sooner or later&mdash;she locked me
in the room!"</p>

<p>"Gee!" For a moment Pater looked at his friend, startled, then
burst into a loud guffaw. "Caught you, old man! Well?"</p>

<p>"I got out and went to the room where I had found the girl. The
couch on which she had been sitting had been pulled well forward
into the room. Something was sticking from under the flounce
arrangement in front. It was a man's hand. The couch had been
pulled out to conceal him and&mdash;" the detective's voice changed
strangely. "Man, she was sitting over a dead man, her long skirts
concealing him, while she talked to me."</p>

<p>"What's the matter here?"</p>

<p>A form came out of the dusk of the passage into the room. The
two inspectors turned to face the patrolman. "Why, it's Mr. Pater
and Mr. Murmer. The taxi-driver told me that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Find the telephone, Preston." Pater spoke abruptly. "Ring up
headquarters and tell them there's murder here. I want the doctor,
the finger prints expert, and others of the gang. They'll
understand."</p>

<p>He turned to Murmer. "We'll have a look at that dining room
first. If that girl had supper there she's left her finger prints
all over the place. Said she was Griffiths secretary, did she?
Well, she won't be difficult to pick up."</p>

<p>"You'd better come upstairs and see him first." Murmer
interposed. "I'd like to get his identity straight. We'll have that
constable, too&mdash;Preston, you called him. Being on this beat he
should know Griffiths. That girl told me so many lies that I'd like
to get one point of truth as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Pater nodded. He went to the dining-room door and turned the key
in the lock, drawing it out and dropping it into the side pocket of
his jacket. They waited at the foot of the stairs until the
constable joined them. "Headquarters is sending out the squad, Mr.
Pater," he reported.</p>

<p>"Know this house?" Murmer spoke.</p>

<p>"Mr. Griffiths house, sir&mdash;Mr. Stanley Griffiths." The man
answered promptly. "Rather a rackety customer. Keeps late hours and
entertains quite a lot of friends&mdash;" he hesitated and
concluded. "Ladies mostly."</p>

<p>"Umph! Got a family?"</p>

<p>"No, a bachelor, sir. Servants sleep out."</p>

<p>In spite of discipline, Preston's eye decidedly winked. "They
might be shocked at the goings on here sometimes."</p>

<p>"Then you know him? You've spoken to him?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir. Good for a tip or so, at the right times of the
year. Pleasant spoken man, but&mdash;" The constable shrugged.</p>

<p>"Place ever reported?"</p>

<p>"One or two of the neighbours complained of the noise when he's
had parties. I got orders once to tip him off. Took it
good-naturedly, and said there wouldn't be any more
complaints."</p>

<p>"Well off?"</p>

<p>"Should say he was. Seemed to always have plenty of money.
Usually there's a taxi hanging about until long after this time.
Didn't seem to mind keeping 'em waiting with the meter ticking
over."</p>

<p>Murmer nodded abruptly and led the way upstairs. He came to the
door of the room where the body lay and flung it open. For moments
the three men in the doorway surveyed the still body before the
couch. Suddenly Murmer turned to the constable.</p>

<p>"Know him?"</p>

<p>"That's Mr. Griffiths, sir." The man answered emphatically.
"Lord, he's been stabbed."</p>

<p>"Seen a girl about here to-night?"</p>

<p>Preston shook his head. "You saw me turn into this road
to-night?" Murmer waited for the man's nod of assent. "You didn't
see a girl come out of this house ten minutes later?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't have, sir. I recognised you, Mr. Murmer, and after I
passed you I turned the corner and went up the road behind here. At
the top I came into the main road and went to point to meet the
sergeant. It was there that the taxi-driver found me waiting for
him&mdash;my sergeant, I mean."</p>

<p>"You remember passing me in this street, then." Murmer turned to
the man quickly. "I passed you about thirty yards from the gate of
this house. Why didn't you notice that this house-door was open,
and investigate?"</p>

<p>"The house-door open?" The man stuttered his surprise. "Why, it
wasn't open when I passed; I'll swear to that. I noticed that there
wasn't a light showing and flashed my light on the door, same as I
do with all houses. I wait for the houses to settle down for the
night and then put the light on them to see they're all safe."</p>

<p>"You'll swear the hall-door was closed when you passed?" Murmer
tried to conceal his amazement. "S'pose you'll be surprised when I
tell you that it was half open when I came to it&mdash;quite enough
open for anyone to notice it. Now, how long would it take me to
walk from where I met you to the gate of this house?"</p>

<p>"Half a minute, sir," Preston replied promptly.</p>

<p>"Then, if we're both right that door opened during the minute
after you passed it and I came to the gate. But I'll swear no one
came out of the house to the pavement during that minute. I saw you
coming down the road and I watched you. I watched up the street
after I passed you. No one came out of this house. Now, what do you
make of that?"</p>

<p>The constable did not answer. He shrugged, almost imperceptibly.
For a moment Murmer stared at the man. He believed he was telling
the truth. Yet, how could someone come out of the house and get
away, with the gate under his observation all the time?</p>

<p>Abruptly, he spoke again: "Ever seen Mr. Griffiths
secretary&mdash;the girl from his office?"</p>

<p>"Not to know her as such, Mr. Murmer." Now the Englishman's eyes
turned on Pater. The Inspector nodded and Murmer spoke again.</p>

<p>"Get to the gate, Preston, and watch out for the headquarters'
car. Mr. Pater and I are going to have a look at the remains of the
supper-party, in the dining room."</p>

<p>Downstairs in the hall again, Pater pulled the key from his
pocket and unlocked the door. As they entered the dining room the
Englishman halted with an exclamation of amazement. The disorder of
the supper table had disappeared. The crockery, glass and silver
had been piled neatly in the centre of the table and the cloth
thrown up all round to cover it. On the floor, close to one of the
legs of the table, lay a soiled and crumpled napkin.</p>

<p>"That's broke it!" Murmer spoke with chagrin in his voice. "That
damned girl's been here. Remembered finger prints. She's wiped
every article on the table, and I guess the rest of the room as
well. Gosh! She's got brains, that girl; even if she is a
crook&mdash;a murderess!"</p>

<p>"What about upstairs?" Pater turned to the door. "I'm betting
she didn't forget that."</p>

<p>Murmer made a gesture of despair. "She was wearing gloves when I
saw her. I may be mistaken, of course, but I'll bet you a week's
pay she's wiped every fingerprint from where she's been in this
house."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">"WELL, I'm&mdash;" Inspector John Pater chuckled
thickly. "Seems that girl, whoever she is, is more than a match for
one of Scotland Yard's star men! Glory; Locks him in a bedroom and
then waits to clean up her finger-prints before making her
get-away. Some nerve that!"</p>

<p>Murmer nodded, absently. He was staring about the room; a long,
narrow room, with French a windows opening out on to the gardens at
the rear of the house. Moving lightly, as so many men of weight
seem to be able to do, he quartered the room. He came to the
windows and, using his elbows, pressed heavily on the frames. One
of the windows swung open.</p>

<p>"Suppose she went out that way," observed Pater.</p>

<p>"Don't think so&mdash;No!" Murmer was staring out into the
darkness. "There's gardens of houses on either side and the gardens
of another house backs on to these. No, she'd be a fool to go out
this way; she'd leave footprints. Besides, she'd have to go round
the house to get to the street. What's the matter with her walking
out of the front door and down the street? Preston was well out of
the way, and at that time of night Edgecliff's not crowded."</p>

<p>Pater nodded. His tall, lean, rather lanky frame propped one of
the door posts. With his hands thrust deep into his pocket, his
keen, dark-brown eyes watched his companion carefully.</p>

<p>Murmer turned from contemplating the gardens to the room again.
For a moment his innocent blue eyes scanned the room, then he went
forward quickly to a dark corner beside a massive sideboard. For
nearly a minute he stooped, examining something on the ground, then
turned and beckoned to the Australian detective.</p>

<p>"Lord!" Pater took a torch from his pocket and flashed the light
into the corner.</p>

<p>"A revolver!" The stout man had dropped to his knees beside the
weapon, bending closer and sniffing audibly. When he looked up at
Pater, standing watching him, there was a humorous twinkle
lightening the perplexity that had previously been on his face.</p>

<p>"Interesting!" The Englishman sat back on his haunches, absently
ruffling his carefully flattened curls. "Tell me, John. If the lady
stabbed the gent upstairs in the neck, why is there a recently
fired revolver in this dining room?"</p>

<p>"What's the answer?" Pater drawled. "A lemon? You're sure it's
been recently fired?"</p>

<p>"Sure, yes. There's a distinct odour about a recently fired gun;
you should know that. I'm willing to bet this revolver was fired
within the last hour."</p>

<p>He dropped his handkerchief over the revolver, then lifted it
carefully and deposited it on the table. "Time those fellows were
here," he said. "No, don't touch it, John! I'll swear there's
fingerprints on it."</p>

<p>Again his fingers ruffled his light curls. "Tell me, why didn't
the girl clean that gun off-like she did the plate?
Suppose&mdash;wonder if she knew it was there?"</p>

<p>Pater shook his head. He was about to speak when sounds in the
hall drew his attention. A moment, and three men strode into the
room.</p>

<p>"'Lo, sir!" The leading man of the newcomers saluted the
Inspectors. "What's the trouble, Mr. Pater?"</p>

<p>"Murder, Ben&mdash;Upstairs&mdash;the room almost facing the
head of the stairs. Goodnight, Dr. Angus! Will you go up with
Sergeant Russell?" The third man, Scotty, who had turned to follow
the doctor and the sergeant, hesitated. "Got your box of tricks
here? Good! Well, tell us what's on that gun?"</p>

<p>"Brought it down here?" The fingerprints man raised his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"No; found it down there. Get a move on! I'm guessing this is
going to be a strange case!"</p>

<p>Ted Scott lifted his attaché case to the table and opened it.
For some minutes he bent over the gun, first treating it with
powder from a sufflator then examining it through a powerful
magnifying glass. Presently he looked up, beckoning the Inspectors
to him.</p>

<p>"Fingerprints?" asked Murmer softly.</p>

<p>"'Lots of 'em. Funny thing, they're all the wrong way
round."</p>

<p>"What do you, mean by that?" asked Inspector Pater. "Well, he
held the gun so&mdash;" Scott picked up the magnifying glass,
pointing the handle to his breast, yet with the hand holding it,
pointing away from him.</p>

<p>"What the devil did he do that for? He'd have had to trigger it
with his thumb, and even that 'ud be awkward."</p>

<p>"Whose finger prints?" asked Murmer. "You said 'he.' Aren't they
a girl's prints?"</p>

<p>"No; a man's. Have a look." Scott handed his glass to the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"A man's?" Pater showed astonishment. "You're certain,
Scotty?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't mistake 'em. No girl could make a fingerprint like
that."</p>

<p>Presently Murmer stood back, fingering his lower lip
thoughtfully. He watched Pater take the glass and examine the
prints, which now stood out in lines of powder. A little twinkle of
amusement came in his eyes at the puzzled expression of his
comrade's face.</p>

<p>"Got you puzzled, John? Thought so. Oh, you're not the only one.
So, there's been a man here, too. Fired a gun, but did it as
awkwardly as an old maid committing suicide trying to frighten the
family ghost. Now, if he shot at the girl he missed, for there
wasn't a mark on her&mdash;I should have seen it if there had been.
Who'd he fire at? Give me that and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned suddenly to Scott. "Got a photographer here?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Scott answered. Sitting with his kit in the hall,
awaiting orders. "Want this photographed now?"</p>

<p>"I might as well." Murmer turned to the door. "Leave it to you,
Scott. When you've got your pictures of the exterior, here or at
headquarters, have a look at the interior. I'd like to recognise
that bullet when I see it&mdash;and I'm guessing it's not far away.
Coming upstairs, John?"</p>

<p>The two detectives left the room. Very thoughtfully they climbed
the stairs to the murder room. Just within the door they glanced
interrogatively at the doctor, who had just risen from his
examination.</p>

<p>"Dead," Dr. Angus said, turning to his bag and replacing
instruments, "about an hour to an hour and a half."</p>

<p>"Stabbed in the neck, doctor?" Murmer strolled to the table and
bent to examine the little dagger ornament. "Strange how a little
bit of metal like this can let out a man's life."</p>

<p>"Bit of metal?" Dr. Angus looked surprised. "Yes, it's strange
how that came to be driven into his flesh without buckling. In
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it would have touched some
muscle or bone and twisted up. Just a fluke it missed&mdash;" He
checked, staring into Murmer's astonished face. "What are you
thinking of, Inspector?" He turned and went to the body, examining
the neck wound. "But that didn't kill him&mdash;exactly."</p>

<p>"What exactly do you mean by 'exactly?'" asked Pater
quickly.</p>

<p>"You don't know?" For a moment Dr. Angus stared. "Oh, I suppose
you didn't disturb him&mdash;left him for medical examination, eh?
Well, if you'd turned him over&mdash;"</p>

<p>He beckoned to Sergeant Russell, standing by. Together they
lifted the dead man. The two Inspectors followed the line of the
doctor's pointing finger. "Shot in the back." Dr. Angus' voice was
abruptly professional. "Bullet went right through the
heart&mdash;killing him instantly."</p>

<p>Pater turned to the floor where the man had lain. He noted that
there was little blood there. Only a couple of patches in a rough
outline of a human figure which Sergeant Russell had traced on the
carpet before he and Dr. Angus had lifted the corpse on to the
couch. One patch of blood was where the man's neck would have been,
the other under where the bullet had pierced the back.</p>

<p>"Not a great amount of blood, doctor!" observed Pater
curiously.</p>

<p>"Dead men don't bleed." A quaint smile came on the doctor's
lips. "If you men at Central Lane gave up reading those tripe
detective novels and studied a few medical works I'd recommend,
you'd learn something of your profession. It's only in mystery
novels you find dead men streaming gore."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," Murmer said reflectively. "So our
friend was shot in the back?"</p>

<p>"As I've told you." Dr. Angus turned at the door. "Bathroom
somewhere along this corridor, I suppose." He went out of the room,
leaving the door open. Saul Murmer caught Pater's eyes, and
shrugged. For a moment he stood looking at the dead man then turned
to the wall behind the couch.</p>

<p>"Bullet?" Pater moved forward, switching on the light from his
torch and focussing it on the wall. "Should be about here."</p>

<p>The Englishman searched in silence for some minutes. Then:</p>

<p>"Give me a hand to move this couch, John."</p>

<p>For a long time the two men, assisted by Sergeant Russell,
examined the wall closely. At length Inspector Murmer made a
gesture of despair and moved into the room. The two men watched
him. For a time the Englishman was thoughtful, then went to the
corpse, lifting it until the bullet wound was exposed. Sergeant
Russell went to his aid and held the body while Murmer examined the
man's breast.</p>

<p>"Bullet went right through him." Inspector Murmer looked up at
his companions. "More than probably his coat spread open at the
time he was killed and then fell into place when he struck the
ground. Anyway, the bullet didn't touch it and it was concealing
the wound-exit when I first saw him. Then, that dagger-thing caught
my eyes&mdash;and the bullet wound is right to the side,
too&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stared round the room, perplexedly; then suddenly
laughed.</p>

<p>"Help me shift this furniture, John." He waited until the couch
was again against the wall.</p>

<p>"Now we'll do a bit of reconstruction. The girl was sitting here
when I saw her. More than likely she took the same side of the
couch as when he&mdash;Yes, that's it. Russell, you're the girl.
Sit here. Now John, you're about Griffiths height. Stand in front
of Russell. Like that. Good." Murmer went to the door and turned.
"Stoop a little more, John&mdash;the girl was shorter than
Russell&mdash;That's it. Now think&mdash;Russell's a girl&mdash;one
with a gaudy moustache&mdash;and you're trying to kiss
him&mdash;her&mdash;against hi&mdash;Oh, damn, her&mdash;will.
That's good. Bend a little more. Just so&mdash;" The Inspector
walked another step into the room. "Now&mdash;Hold it,
John&mdash;"</p>

<p>Slowly the Englishman's forefinger came up, pointing at John's
back, as a muzzle of a pistol. He moved slightly to one side; then
moved a step forward. For a moment he waited squinting along the
line of his finger, then moved again. He nodded, and let his hand
drop to his side. As if walking a chalk line, he went forward until
he stood just beyond Pater.</p>

<p>"That's got it, John. Get out of the road."</p>

<p>When Pater moved to one side the Englishman advanced to the
couch. A short search and a little whistle of satisfaction escaped
him. He pointed to an almost invisible hole in the covering.</p>

<p>"There's the bullet!"</p>

<p>"Good!" A moment and Pater in had his penknife to work, digging
at the couch.</p>

<p>"So the girl didn't kill him!" Murmer stood back from the couch,
watching his comrade. "Poor devil of a kid. Enticed here by that
damned rake and&mdash;Got her up here and tried to put the acid on
her&mdash;She resisted&mdash;A damned flirting fool, of
course&mdash;but not a fool of that kind. Put up a fight against
him&mdash;of course! Perhaps her hat came off and that dagger thing
got between her fingers&mdash;Things happen like that&mdash;they
do. Struck at him with it&mdash;and it went home. Someone comes up
here after them&mdash;Opens the door and sees that Griffiths is
overpowering her and shoots&mdash;" For a moment Murmer's voice,
drifted into indistinctness; then strengthened again. "Damned nervy
thing&mdash;shooting at a man with a girl in his arms. Bullet must
have a passed within inches of her&mdash;Yes&mdash;That's so,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He swung round on his heels as Dr. Angus entered the room.</p>

<p>"Say, doctor! You state he was killed by the bullet?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" The medical man looked surprised. "Why the doubt,
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the dagger wound?"</p>

<p>Dr. Angus looked at the detective, inquisitively.</p>

<p>"I heard you found a girl up here, Inspector." The doctor spoke
slowly. "Sergeant Russell has told me something of this
man's&mdash;er&mdash;reputation. I tell you he was killed by a
bullet piercing his heart. Death was practically instantaneous. I
know my work&mdash;Are you doubting me?"</p>

<p>A little smile curved the cupid's bow of the detective's mouth.
He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not doubting you, doctor; just a matter of curiosity. I'll
agree, if you like, that Griffiths got just what he deserved and
that it's a pity that someone hadn't done it before. I'm willing to
admit that the girl I saw wasn't the first to meet trouble here
through that man. But John and I ain't allowed sentiment&mdash;we
have to leave that to the medical profession&mdash;You tell me that
man was killed by a bullet through his heart. That's so, then. But,
will you tell me this. If he hadn't had a bullet through his heart,
would that stab with that dagger ornament have killed him?"</p>

<p>For a moment a puzzled frown darkened the medical man's face.
Almost reluctantly he crossed the room and stood again by the dead
man, looking down On the grey face. For a moment he did not speak.
"You've asked me a question I'm not going to reply to, Inspector."
The words came reluctantly from Dr. Angus' lips. "I'm not going to
state theories. There'll be a post-mortem. I'll see that there is
one, if you want questions of that sort answered. At present I'll
say that dagger might have buckled."</p>

<p>"It's straight, doctor." Murmer's voice was low, yet with a note
of insistence. Dr. Angus did not answer. Inspector Pater and
Sergeant Russell were watching the two men curiously. To the
Australian detective his comrade's face appeared longer and
strained.</p>

<p>"I'm asking you now, doctor." Saul Murmer's voice had dropped to
little more than a whisper. "Could that dagger thrust in the neck,
just where that wound is, have caused death?"</p>

<p>"It might." The words came reluctantly from the medical man's
lips. "It might. I can't&mdash;I won't say any more now." He turned
to face the Scotland Yard man. "All I will say now is that from the
exterior appearance of the wounds&mdash;both dagger wound and
bullet wound&mdash;either of them appear fatal. Wait&mdash;" he
raised his hand as Murmer opened his lips. "I may alter that
opinion after the autopsy."</p>

<p>"But, you will not alter that opinion, doctor&mdash;" the
Englishman's voice was very grave&mdash;"that Stanley Griffiths
would have died from that stab in the neck if he had not been shot
a second or so later."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">"FAUGH! What a hell of mess!" Inspector John Pater
swung round in his chair from the desk in Stanley Griffiths
study&mdash;a small room on the ground floor. The desk at which he
had been working was covered with papers. Drawers of the desk stood
wide open; and a tall steel filing cabinet in the corner showed
signs of a thorough search. Outside the open windows overlooking
the long, wide, well-tended gardens, the dawn was breaking, dimming
the light from the electric globes in the room. The two Inspectors
had waited until the dead man had been taken from the house in the
ambulance and the house was quiet again, before commencing their
search for evidence.</p>

<p>Now a constable sat in the kitchen; another sat in the hall
outside the study door, and a plain-clothes man walked the pavement
before the house. So far as Pater and Murmer know, the neighbours
were in ignorance of the tragedy that had taken place in their
midst.</p>

<p>Now they were engaged in a close examination of the dead man's
papers and correspondence. As their quest proceeded one or the
other gave some exclamation of disgust at the depths of sensual
depravity revealed. Stanley Griffiths had made a business of
seduction. Letters they had read showed that the man had sought to
contaminate not only the bodies but the very souls of the girls he
had drawn into his web.</p>

<p>John Pater was almost inclined to rejoice at the man's sudden
death. It had led to the uncovering of a brutal and lascivious
sensuality among a class of men the police had long had under
suspicion, but against whom they had so far failed to gather any
material evidence. Now they had evidence in plenty. The letters
they had found in that room would make it possible to trace many of
these girls. In the privacy of police headquarters they could be
examined and statements taken from them. Those statements would
result in many men of high standing in the social and business
world standing in the dock.</p>

<p>But, as the detectives proceeded with their work they began to
have serious doubts of any open action resulting from the
disclosures they were making. Many of the men and women uncovered
during the search were of high standing in the community. Big
influences would be brought to bear to stifle court action. That
might be true. The public might never know of the depraved cliques
in the city and suburbs, but even without open action, the police
could disperse these men and women. Under the threat of exposure
these moral satyrs would scatter in frantic fear.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer, seated in the most comfortable lounge chair he
could discover, drawn beside the big desk, looked up at his
comrade's remark, and nodded. He dropped the letter he had been
reading on the pile on the floor beside the chair.</p>

<p>"What of this man, Skields, John?" he asked, levering himself to
a more comfortable position in the chair. "Looks as if he'd be
interesting to question."</p>

<p>"Sure!" John Pater consulted a list of names and addresses
scribbled on a pad. "Arthur Skields, Altona Flats, Pattybourne
road! That's not far from here. What's the time, Saul?"</p>

<p>"Rising six. Wonder what time the servants come to work?"</p>

<p>"Not too early, you bet," Pater grinned wryly. "Men of Griffiths
kidney don't want servants round their places too early in the
morning. Lord! I'd just hate to hunt down that girl!"</p>

<p>"There isn't much doubt." The desk chair creaked as the
Inspector swung it round, from before the desk. "Griffiths gets his
girl here. Gives her supper, and possibly plenty of drink. You'll
have noticed there are three empty bottles of wine one the
dining-room table. That's a generous allowance for two people. Then
he entices her upstairs. Tries to force her into his bedroom, and
she resists; in desperation, she seizes the only weapon in her
hand, the silver dagger ornament and strikes him blindly with it.
By accident, I firmly believe, she hits him in the throat and
inflicts a mortal wound."</p>

<p>"Dr. Angus states he died from a bullet wound," Murmer
interposed.</p>

<p>"Dr. Angus is a sentimental old fool!" Inspector Pater shifted
uneasily in his chair. "We&mdash;you and I&mdash;have got to put
sentiment aside&mdash;that sort of thing's for the jury, and the
more sentiment her counsel piles on them the better I'll be
pleased. I don't mind saying that to you&mdash;and here."</p>

<p>Murmer nodded. "Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"Miss&mdash;what's-her-name&mdash;stabs Griffiths while he has
her in his arms. The shock causes him to release her and she falls
on the couch. Almost at the same moment the man in the doorway
fires. Then he runs downstairs.</p>

<p>"Why did he go into the dining room?" asked Murmer. "If he
rushed away in such a panic after firing the shot, why come into
this dining room and fling his gun into that corner&mdash;why not
have run straight out of the front door?" Inspector Pater shrugged.
He turned to the desk and picked up a small box in which lay a
bullet.</p>

<p>"You've seen this, Saul. We dug it out of the couch padding.
There's a trace of blood on it&mdash;Griffiths blood&mdash;and on
it two threads of cloth."</p>

<p>"Well?" For the moment the Australian detective looked at his
companion half angrily. Then he smiled.</p>

<p>"I hate to admit it as much as you do, Saul." His voice had
taken a softer note. "But what I've said are facts, and you and I
have only to deal in facts. A man shot Griffiths; that I'll admit.
And I'll admit his bullet killed the brute. But the girl had
stabbed him before the bullet was fired. We can't get over that.
Think, man&mdash;" His voice rose a tone note, "&mdash;think man;
if the girl had been in Griffiths arms at the moment the bullet was
fired we'd have found two corpses up there. That's a fact we can't
deny. The girl stabbed Griffiths, causing him to release his hold
on her. She fell back on the couch a fraction of a second before
the bullet was fired&mdash;" He paused, and when he spoke again
distress showed in his voice.</p>

<p>"You obtained from Dr. Angus an admission that the throat-stab
might have been mortal. That means that even if there was
sufficient life in his body to retain him upright for a second or
two after the dagger-thrust, and, while the bullet was piercing
him, he still was legally dead. You understand what that means.</p>

<p>"If two persons kill a man almost simultaneously&mdash;that is
both a wounds are mortal&mdash;then the person who inflicted the
first wound is accounted guilty of a murder."</p>

<p>"And the second person&mdash;the second murderer?" Murmer smiled
grimly.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater shrugged.</p>

<p>"The Lord knows how the law will look upon that. I've never had
such a case. But I do know that the Public Prosecutor will look to
us for that girl&mdash;and we've got to find her."</p>

<p>"Dr. Angus states that the bullet killed Griffiths&mdash;killed
him instantly. That can only mean that he considers that there was
life in him when the bullet struck home."</p>

<p>"I'll admit that." The Australian spoke quickly. He paused, then
continued, impatiently: "Damn it, man! Don't make it too difficult
for us. The prosecution will show that the wound in the throat was
mortal. We know that was caused by the girl. If the bullet had been
fired before the dagger-thrust, then the girl must have been
wounded, and in all probability unable to inflict the dagger
wound."</p>

<p>Again he paused, to continue in a quieter tone. "Look at it how
you will, Saul, the onus of murder is on the girl&mdash;and it's
our job to find her."</p>

<p>"Dr. Angus states the man was alive when the bullet was fired."
Inspector Murmer had risen to his feet and was pacing the room. "We
have to acknowledge that the girl probably stabbed Griffiths and
inflicted a mortal wound&mdash;but, all the same, the stab did not
kill him. He was alive when the bullet pierced his heart&mdash;we
can't get over that&mdash;and the bullet killed him instantly.
That's shown by the absence of blood&mdash;what was on the door was
probably drained from his veins by the stab during the few seconds
before the bullet killed him. If the stab alone had killed him
there'd have been oceans of blood on him and around him. I'll swear
there was no blood on the girl."</p>

<p>The detective swung round angrily. "Damn it, John. Do you want
to hang that girl&mdash;a girl, possibly a born fool&mdash;a
flirting fool? But we can't forget that she was defending her
honour against a carnal, sexual beast!"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater did not reply for some seconds, he was engaged
with a letter he had taken from an open drawer.</p>

<p>"You're a good pleader, Saul," he said at length. "I feel like
you feel. I'd go down to hell to keep that girl from what, after
all, must be punishment for entirely natural acts. But, you know,
we were sworn to defend and uphold the law&mdash;and the law will
say that it was she who struck the first&mdash;the mortal
blow&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he paused, drawing the pad towards him and scribbling a
few lines. He remained intent for some seconds on what he had
written. Suddenly he pressed the desk-bell savagely, keeping his
finger on the little knob until the a constable from the kitchen
came on the run.</p>

<p>"Any of the servants turned up yet, Morton?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, sir. Shouldn't say they'd be here much before
eight."</p>

<p>Inspector Pater stared at the man interrogatively, but the
constable's face did not change.</p>

<p>"So you believe the servants will not be here much before eight
o'clock?" he asked. "Is that a guess, or knowledge?"</p>

<p>"A guess, sir!"</p>

<p>Again Inspector Pater was silent. Suddenly he asked: "Any signs
of life in the surrounding houses?"</p>

<p>"There's smoke from the chimney of next door, sir."</p>

<p>"Then there's someone about there. One of the servants, I
suppose. Just slip across and ask the lady&mdash;it's a lady I
presume&mdash;to favour me with her presence here for a few
minutes. No need to tell her why. Perhaps you'd better infer
there's been a bit of trouble here, though&mdash;but not murder.
Understand?"</p>

<p>The man saluted and left the room. A quarter of an hour later he
re-entered, ushering before him a startled, distressed girl.</p>

<p>"Come in Miss&mdash;er&mdash;" Murmer, stout and
innocent-looking, faced the door, his portly form concealing the
more severe, official-looking Inspector Pater.</p>

<p>"There's no need to be afraid of us, my girl. I don't look too
frightful, do I?" A fat chuckle brought a smile to the girl's white
lips "There's been a bit of trouble here and Mr. Griffiths&mdash;is
absent. We're police inspectors and we want to get in touch with
someone in the neighbourhood. Seeing you were up and about, by the
smoke from your chimney, we got Mr. Morton to bring you here. See?
Now, can you tell us where the maids here live? So far, there's no
one but the police in this house."</p>

<p>The girl did not reply. Her eyes went past Inspector Murmer,
taking in the long, official form of Inspector Pater seated at the
desk.</p>

<p>"You're detectives!" she breathed.</p>

<p>"Clever guess that, miss. You should be a detective yourself."
Again the fat chuckle, the broad, round face creasing with
guileless mirth. "I knew you were a girl of sense directly you came
in at that door. Of course you know the young ladies who
work&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't call Mrs. Gordon a young lady," the girl smiled.
"Why, she's over fifty!"</p>

<p>"And I'm guessing you're not twenty, yet." Murmer patted the
girl's shoulder in fatherly fashion while he urged her gently to
the chair before the desk. "Sit there, my dear, and take your time.
Of course you got a shock to find a brace of detectives here. But
he ain't dangerous&mdash;" He indicated Pater with a nod,
"&mdash;why, he's a bachelor with quite a fancy for the fair sex
and the girl who hooks him&mdash;What did you say? Mrs. Gordon? Oh,
she's housekeeper and she lives&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gordon lives at 1496A New South Head Road," the girl
answered with some return of confidence.</p>

<p>"Number one, four, nine, six, A? That's good. Suppose there's
three or four maids to a house of this size?"</p>

<p>"There's only Mrs. Gordon and Nellie Blythe." The girl
hesitated, then continued with a rush. "Y'see Mr. Griffiths isn't
often home in the daytime, and there's only him lives here&mdash;So
the two of them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Nellie Blythe?" Murmer interrupted gently.</p>

<p>"You haven't told us your name, miss?" interrupted Pater.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm Alice Warren." The girl stared at the tall
detective, her cheeks paling: "I&mdash;I don't know anything about
this house."</p>

<p>"You haven't told me Nellie Blythe's address," suggested
Murmer.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know it." The girl jumped to her feet abruptly.
"I don't know it. Mr. Browne says I'm not to have anything to do
with Griffiths or&mdash;or anyone in this house. He'd be cross if
he knew I was here now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Mr. Browne is?"</p>

<p>"He's the gentleman I'm engaged to." Alice Warren flung back her
head defiantly. "He saw Mr. Griffiths speak to me one evening, when
I went to the gate waiting for him, and he said he would break his
head in if he saw me speaking to him again and that I wasn't to
have anything to do with anyone in this house although Mrs.
Gordon's a dear, and I've known her all my life since I was a
little toddler, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully." Murmer's gentle voice broke on the girl's
hysterical speech. "Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I don't know nothing and I'm not going to be drawn into
anything so there and if you want to know anything you'll have to
ask Mrs Gordon when she comes and I'm going home at once and you
can't detain me, or I'll tell Mr. Browne and he'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Incontinently the girl turned and rushed to the door, speeding
through the hall and the front garden down to the street gate.
Murmer looked after her, a grin on his well-turned lips. He turned
to Inspector Pater.</p>

<p>"Afraid that's broken it, John. The young lady don't like the
inhabitants of this house any more than you and I do&mdash;and
we've yet to meet the living ones. Think we'd better send Morton to
find this Mrs. Gordon. Don't suppose she'll be able to tell us
anything, though."</p>

<p>Inspector Pater nodded. He pressed the bell again and when
Constable Morton came to the room ordered him to find Mrs. Gordon
and take her to police headquarters.</p>

<p>He looked up at the Englishman, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"What about Skields?"</p>

<p>"Police headquarters," Murmer suggested after a moment's
thought. "Who's left in the house, now? Saunders, eh? Well, he can
stand guard here. Dawson's on the road? He can go and fetch Skields
to headquarters. We'll question him there. That's right? Good! Just
collect what we'll want and we'll get along home. I can do with a
bath, if I can't have a sleep. Suppose we'll have to see
Superintendent Dixon at once&mdash;" He stretched and yawned. "No
good these all night affairs&mdash;and I guess we've got a stiff
day before us."</p>

<p>Inspector Pater nodded and commenced to collect the papers
scattered over the desk. Murmer went upstairs and after a little
search found a couple of big portmanteaux. He lugged them in to the
study and helped his companion pack the various exhibits they had
decided to remove from the house.</p>

<p>"All set, John?"</p>

<p>The desk telephone rang. At a nod from Pater Murmer went to the
instrument and lifted the receiver.</p>

<p>"Hello."</p>

<p>"Who's that?" A surprised voice came over the wire.</p>

<p>"Dr. Bastion." Inspector Murmer spoke without a moment's
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Griffiths there?"</p>

<p>"No." The detective's voice was smooth and cultured. "Mr.
Griffiths has met with a slight accident: I am attending him. Can I
give him any message?"</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Gordon there?"</p>

<p>"Who is speaking?"</p>

<p>"I want to speak to Mrs. Gordon."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gordon has not arrived yet. There is no one in the house
but myself."</p>

<p>"What's happened to Griffiths?" There was anxiety in the
voice.</p>

<p>"You did not let me finish my sentence," Murmer reproved. "I was
stating that only myself and Mr. Griffiths were in the house. Can I
give him any message?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" A tense hardness came into the voice at the other end of
the wire. "Tell him I've got to have those letters before
midday&mdash;or there will be hell to pay."</p>

<p>"Letters? What letters? Mr. Griffiths will hardly understand a
message so ambiguous. He will want to know who requires the
letters?"</p>

<p>"Stanley Griffiths will understand. I don't suppose there's
anyone else who wants letters from him at present. Later,
perhaps&mdash;" A short hard laugh cut on the words. "Just tell him
I want those letters immediately, if he wants to keep life in his
rotten carcase!" A click announced to Inspector Murmer that the
line had been disconnected.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">SUPERINTENDANT DIXON, in charge of the detective
branch of the New South Wales Police Department, leaned back in his
chair and stared at Inspectors Pater and Murmer, seated on the
opposite side of the desk. A bigly-made man, with a round, red face
and fierce blue eyes, lips very thin and set in a straight,
compressed line. In spite of a bulk that almost rivalled Inspector
Murmer's, the Supt. carried not an ounce of superfluous flesh on
his big body and, despite that he was close on the retiring age,
could give an excellent account of himself in a rough and tumble
fight. He was one of the old school of detectives, trained in the
days when fingerprints were an interesting theory, and scientific
deduction was laughed at. Still openly deriding what he termed
new-fangled theories he had secretly kept himself well abreast of
the times.</p>

<p>For minutes after Inspector Murmer had finished his account of
the finding of the girl and the dead man in the house in
Wonthaggi-avenue he sat silent. He waited while Inspector Pater
took up the thread of the story and carried it to a conclusion.</p>

<p>A small, thin smile broke the line of his lips, growing to the
subdued chuckle that passed with him for a laugh.</p>

<p>"Called a bluff on you, Murmer," he said, in a curiously small
voice for so big a man.</p>

<p>"I was not looking for a case, sir," Murmer protested. "I
thought the hall-door had been left open by accident&mdash;" he
paused, "&mdash;the girl was quite natural, except for a slight
hesitation in her speech at the end of sentences."</p>

<p>"A hesitation on the last word of her&mdash;sentences?" queried
Dixon. "Like&mdash;that?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir." Murmer looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"I don't think anyone would expect to find a young girl sitting
quietly on a couch over a dead man," protested Pater warmly. "One
doesn't expect to find girls with that sort of nerve, sir."</p>

<p>"The modern miss would sit over the dead body of the devil
himself!" Dixon stated emphatically. "I don't put anything past
'em." He waited a moment, then added: "Looks like you two have made
yourselves pretty conversant with the affair. Want to keep on with
it?"</p>

<p>Murmer nodded.</p>

<p>"Think it'll take long? What have you two got on hand? That
cheque case? How does it stand?"</p>

<p>"Nearly complete, sir." Pater spoke eagerly. "We were going to
frame a report for you this morning. There's evidence for a warrant
against Montague Frazer."</p>

<p>"Think he suspects?"</p>

<p>"Confident he's bluffing us, sir." Murmer said, smiling at
thoughts of the man mentioned. "I fell for all his stuff and
confided quite a lot in him. He tried to fasten suspicion on one of
his fellow clerks. Made out a surprisingly good case&mdash;but the
facts fitted on him, himself when you put in what we know."</p>

<p>"All right. Let me have that report today, then get on to the
Griffith affair. Shouldn't give you much trouble. A girl like that
should be picked up quite easily."</p>

<p>"You think a case rests against her, sir?" asked Murmer.</p>

<p>"You tell me Dr. Angus said the stab was a fatal wound?" Dixon
lifted his heavy eyebrows questioningly.</p>

<p>"There's the bullet wound, sir&mdash;also fatal," the Englishman
retorted. "And there wasn't much blood about. The bullet stopped
the heart action immediately&mdash;and the stab would have caused
him to bleed to death!"</p>

<p>Dixon turned to Inspector Pater. "You say you got fingerprints
on the gun? Any good?"</p>

<p>"With the telephone message, yes, sir," answered Pater. "If the
fingerprints are Skields' there's a clear motive."</p>

<p>"And if they ain't you'll have to fit them to somebody," the
Superintendent spoke emphatically.</p>

<p>"Then you'll charge the girl and the man with the murder, sir?"
asked Murmer. "There'll be quite a battle between the defence
counsel in court&mdash;trying to shift the blame from one to the
other. Might make it difficult to get a conviction."</p>

<p>"That's your business&mdash;yours and Pater's. Well, finish the
Frazer case and then get on with the Griffiths matter. You're
seeing that housekeeper and Skields here?"</p>

<p>Murmer nodded. "Mrs. Gordon should be waiting for us now. We
told Dawson to have Skields here by 10 o'clock."</p>

<p>"All right. It's up to you fellows now. Let me know how you
progress." The abrupt nod was a dismissal.</p>

<p>Outside the door, Murmer halted to mop his brow. "An interview
with the chief makes me think my next stopping place will be the
dock," he murmured.</p>

<p>"So long as you don't stay there&mdash;"</p>

<p>Murmer ambled down the corridor with the peculiar rolling gait
of the stout man, Pater following. In the room they shared he went
to the window and stared down at the court below. Presently he
turned to face Pater, seated at the desk.</p>

<p>"I don't like it, John," he said. "Leave the girl out of it and
we've got an open and shut case against the man who telephoned, if
his fingerprints fit that gun. Then&mdash;we've got a good case
against the girl, if we cut out the bullet wound, the gun and the
fingerprints. If Dr. Angus would say the man was living after the
stab and had a chance for recovery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Dr. Angus will oblige you," Pater smiled wryly.</p>

<p>"Not a chance." Murmer's head rolled on his fat neck. "He's too
damned honest for a police surgeon&mdash;or he likes setting us
problems. He can't&mdash;or won't&mdash;keep the girl out of it.
The Crown Prosecutor will look at it as he does: The girl stabbed
Griffiths and inflicted a fatal wound. Therefore she killed him.
There's no doubt of it. That's the case that'll go into court. Even
if we tip the defence that the man lived until he was
shot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Depends on the girl," Pater laughed. "If she's a good-looker
and her counsel pleads that she was defending her
honour&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened and a constable entered. "Mrs. Gordon is
outside, sir."</p>

<p>"Push her in." Pater turned to his companion as the door closed.
"Who'll tackle her, Saul?"</p>

<p>"Your fish." The Englishman seated himself in a deep lounge
chair close to the window. "I want Skields."</p>

<p>As Pater nodded the door opened again and Constable Morton
ushered in a short, stout, comfortable-looking woman, with the
character "capable cook" written all over her.</p>

<p>There was little new that Mrs. Gordon could tell them, although
she found many words in which to tell that little. She had been
housekeeper-cook to Mr. Stanley Griffiths for two years, at the
house in Wonthaggi avenue. Griffiths had been a good master, so far
as pay and consideration had gone. She had one assistant, a young
girl, named Nellie Blythe. Nellie was outside, in the common room,
with Constable Morton, and she trusted that no harm would come to
her amid the crowd of men there. Nellie Blythe was young&mdash;and
young girls will be flighty and take no notice of the advice of
their elders.</p>

<p>At this point Inspector Murmer suggested softly that Mrs. Gordon
would be in perfect agreement with Superintendent Dixon. The lady
turned abruptly and stared at the stout detective in the lounge
chair, as if observing him for the first time. Then, turning her
shoulder on him, she addressed Inspector Pater in an overwhelming
flow of words.</p>

<p>She had had occasion to speak to Nellie regarding her conduct
with her employer. Mr. Griffiths was usually up and in the sitting
room upstairs, in a dressing gown, when she and Nellie came to
work. He waited in his sitting room until Nellie brought him his
early morning cup of tea and his shaving water. Very frequently he
would be lying down on the big couch there&mdash;though Mrs. Gordon
expressed her amazement that a man who had just got out of bed
should want to lie down on a couch&mdash;that was something she
didn't understand, and never would. She had observed
something&mdash;no, she wasn't one to take any girl's character
away. But after what she had seen she had always taken Mr.
Griffiths morning tea and shaving water to him,
herself&mdash;although the stairs were dreadful for a woman who
suffered as she did with her rheumatics. Still, there was no one
who could say as she didn't know her duty and do it. Yes, she took
Mr. Griffiths tea to him every morning and kept Nellie working
downstairs until he left the house, after Nellie Blythe had been in
the house a week&mdash;and she'd still take it if the poor man
wasn't dead with all his sins on his head and no time for
repentance. Yes, she knew Alice Warren. So far as she knew, and she
had known Alice since she had almost worried her mother into an
early grave by&mdash;</p>

<p>Inspector Pater interrupted hastily, reminding the lady that
Inspector Murmer was a single man and an Englishman. Again the lady
turned to the detective seated in the window. There was an
expression, of entire compassion on her broad, good-humoured face
and she exclaimed: "English! Good Lord&mdash;the poor, poor
man!"</p>

<p>Yes, she knew Charlie Browne and she'd heard that he was engaged
to Alice, and she was sure that she couldn't do better, for Charlie
Browne was a respectable, steady workman making good
money&mdash;she wished to goodness Nellie Blythe could find another
like Charlie Browne. Perhaps, then she'd stop her flighty
tricks&mdash;but it wasn't any good saying anything to her, for
girls will be girls even though the heavens rocked and&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir?"</p>

<p>Charlie Browne&mdash;oh, yes, he was a motor mechanic and made
good money. Any failings, well, he had one, but she didn't like to
take any man's character away, not that any of them had much. No,
he didn't drink nor gamble nor anything like that&mdash;thank
goodness, and if Edward Gordon had left the gee-gees and the drink
alone he might have a been alive today to be a comfort to a lone
body&mdash;if he hadn't had the chance to go to Heaven, but she'd
heard they wouldn't have racehorses or hotels there&mdash;and no
wonder with all the trouble they caused to the men's poor wives
and&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, yes! Charlie Browne mixed up with quite a rough class of
men. She'd spoken to Alice about it but the girl wouldn't do
anything more than laugh. Oh, just roughness, sir, but she didn't
hold with knocking each other about even if they did it in a ring
that wasn't a ring but a square, and there couldn't be much magic
about it if you saw Charlie's poor face sometimes. Why, Mr.
Griffiths, sir? Why, she&mdash;knew he was a stock and
share-broker&mdash;whatever that might be. No, he hadn't told her
but she'd seen his name on a visiting card lying on his study
desk&mdash;though she hadn't looked for she wasn't one to pry into
anyone's business, but the words on the card caught her eyes as she
was helping Nellie clean up one day. Chalmers and Griffiths was the
name on the card&mdash;but she hadn't noticed the address for she
wasn't one to read anything that didn't concern her, and she'd been
a widow for nigh twenty years, but by the Lord's favour she hadn't
any young children to worry a body and&mdash;</p>

<p>Inspector Pater looked exhausted when he returned from escorting
Mrs. Gordon through the dangers of police headquarters, to the
street. He brought back with him Nellie Blythe, a pert-faced blonde
of about twenty years of age. Her rather elaborate make-up showed
signs of recent, rather copious, tears.</p>

<p>Nellie had little to tell the detectives. She appeared to answer
questions readily, and a little breathlessly, smiling alluringly
all the time.</p>

<p>Murmer frowned when he caught Pater's eyes, believing the girl
was talking to conceal something. Pater nodded assent, yet he
forbore pressing the girl on any point.</p>

<p>She giggled when Pater spoke of Mrs. Gordon's statement that she
had been "carrying on" with her employer. Quite openly she
acknowledged that Stanley Griffiths had kissed her once or
twice&mdash;but what did that matter? Men were given that way, and
if a girl was to have a chance in this world at all she wouldn't
take much notice of incidents like that and&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon, oh, she was a dear, but terribly old-fashioned.
Nellie supposed, with a fresh attack of giggling, that Mrs. Gordon
had been kissed at some time, especially as she had been married,
but how she had managed to get a&mdash;Oh, men were easy to handle
if a girl knew her beans!</p>

<p>Inspector Pater rang for Constable Morton to escort Nellie from
police precincts; he considered that he had done his duty in
escorting Mrs. Gordon to safety from the many constables,
sergeants, inspectors and others who infested Central Lane.</p>

<p>When the door closed he dropped into a chair, his arms hanging
limply over the wings. Murmer ambled over to a corner and unlocked
a cupboard. From it he brought two glasses and a bottle. He poured
out generous portions and, without a word, handed one glass to
Pater. There was silence until the glass hit the desk with a little
thud.</p>

<p>"Lord! I wanted that. Do you think, Saul, we could put that down
to expenses?"</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer laughed and drew to the desk the chair on which
Nellie Blythe had sat. For half-an-hour the two Inspectors devoted
themselves to the report on the cheque case.</p>

<p>They had barely finished it when a constable knocked at the door
and entered. He announced that Mr. Arthur Skields was in the
building, impatiently awaiting their pleasure. The two inspectors
looked up curiously as the man entered. They saw a tall, fair man,
remarkably well dressed. His face was long, with high cheekbones.
The skin was very closely shaven, except for the upper lip
decorated with a very thin, hair-line moustache. Heavy lines showed
about the mouth and eyes and he stooped forward in his walk, as if
his loins were too weak to carry the weight of his long body. His
fair hair lay sleek and smooth, brushed straight back from his
forehead, and Murmer noted that along the line of his hair stood
little beads of perspiration.</p>

<p>As he came forward to the desk where the two detectives awaited
him, he drew a handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his face,
muttering that it was a very warm day. As Arthur Skields' eyes met
his, Murmer felt a little thrill run through his body. The man's
eyes were big, in spite of the narrowed lids, and remarkably
brilliant. One of them was grey and the other hazel. The
combination gave the man an appearance of continued hostility.</p>

<p>Recovering quickly, Inspector Murmer muttered a greeting, then
went to the window and apparently, turned his attention to the
court below.</p>

<p>"Mr. Arthur Skields?" asked Inspector Pater, conventionally.</p>

<p>"Yes." The man spoke in quick, determined tones. "May I ask if
it was necessary to send a uniformed constable to my flat to escort
me to this place?"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater took no notice of the complaint. He was looking
very straightly at the man.</p>

<p>"I should like an answer to my question," demanded Skields.</p>

<p>"I have asked you to come here to answer my questions," retorted
the Inspector. "If you wish, I will regret that time did not permit
that a higher placed official was sent to request your presence
here."</p>

<p>For a brief moment, Murmer turned towards the room, and smiled.
Skields was in for a bad time if he tried to ride the high horse
over Inspector Pater.</p>

<p>"Am I under arrest?" demanded Skields, more civilly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Arthur Skields." Inspector Pater leaned forward, speaking
impressively. "Mr. Stanley Griffiths was shot last night. The
evidence I found in his house made it imperative that I should
interview you immediately."</p>

<p>"Shot? Why, I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes!" The Inspector spoke quickly, the keen determination of
the experienced sleuth-hound in his voice. "What did you think, Mr.
Skields?"</p>

<p>The man did not answer. For long seconds there was silence;
broken by Murmer levering himself from his chair and waddling from
the room.</p>

<p>"You knew Mr. Stanley Griffiths, Mr. Skields?" continued Pater,
when the man showed no signs of speaking.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Intimately?"</p>

<p>"We were acquainted."</p>

<p>Inspector Pater hesitated. After a moment he continued. "I don't
think we shall get very far if you are going to adopt an air of
hostility to the police, Mr. Skields. Were you very intimate with
Mr. Stanley Griffiths?"</p>

<p>Before the man could reply the telephone on the desk shrilled.
Pater shifted impatiently and lifted the receiver. For a moment he
listened, then shoved the instrument across the desk.</p>

<p>"Someone wants to speak to you, Mr. Skields."</p>

<p>"Speak to me?" The man stared. "Who knows I'm here?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you will condescend to answer the call you will find
out."</p>

<p>The Inspector was fast losing his patience. Skields reluctantly
drew the instrument towards him and spoke his name. He listened,
with astonishment growing on his face. At length he spoke:</p>

<p>"I don't know a Dr. Bastion. I've never spoke to you in my life,
and I don't know what you're talking about. I suppose it's one of
your damned police tricks. I've finished with you. If I'm not under
arrest, I'm getting along." He snatched his hat from the desk,
where he had placed it on taking the chair before Inspector Pater,
and, turned to the door. As he opened it and swung out he collided
with Inspector Murmer.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">ARTHUR SKIELDS staggered back from the impact with
Inspector Murmer's solid form. The stout detective did not appear
the slightest bit incommoded by the collision. He moved lumberingly
into the room, driving the slighter built man before him.</p>

<p>"Leaving us so soon, Mr. Skields?" The full, round face was
creased with smiles. "Now, that's too bad&mdash;and I wanted to
have a little talk with you."</p>

<p>"I've got nothing to do with either of you men." Skields looked
as if he would like to force an exit. A glance at the bulky form
between him and the door showed him that Murmer held something more
than fat on his big body. He backed slowly into the room until he
came to the chair on which he had been seated, then sat down
suddenly.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater had remained in his seat behind the desk,
watching the little scene interestedly. During the past months he
had learned that his English confrère had many little
peculiarities&mdash;quaint methods of obtaining the information he
required, without much unpleasantness. At the same time, he knew
that Murmer would not hesitate to go straight to the point, when
necessary.</p>

<p>"Now, that's good of you, Mr. Skields." The stout detective
ambled across the room to his favourite seat before the window.
"Don't mind me sitting here, do you? I carry a bit of weight, you
know, and this sort of chair's more comfortable for me than the one
John's sitting on. He's the build of man who can sit at a desk.
Now, me&mdash;" He finished his sentence with a shrug of personal
disparagement.</p>

<p>For a moment he lay back in his chair, his eyes closed. Skields
surveyed him with lowering brows. He had not come to a conclusion
regarding Inspector Murmer.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he growled at length.</p>

<p>"Smoke?" Murmer opened his eyes, drowsily. He drew from his
pocket an oilskin case and caught back the cover, showing a silver
cigarette case. He placed it on the desk before Skields. "Excuse
me." A fresh wriggling of the stout form and the detective released
one of the side pockets of his jacket. A moment fumbling and he
produced a crumpled packet of cheap cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Those," he indicated the case on the desk, "I keep for my
friends. Can't smoke 'em myself. Can't smoke decent
tobacco&mdash;Pater says mine smell like a damp-straw fire. But he
says those are good&mdash;and I'll take his word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are." Inspector Pater had noticed the man's reluctance to
touch the silver case. He leaned across the desk and took it in his
hands, touching only the oilskin cover. He slipped the cover nearly
off and held the case out to Skields. A moment and the Inspector
pressed the spring and let the case fly open. As Skields went to
take a cigarette the case slipped from Pater's hands on to his
hand. Without a sign the man closed the case and placed it on the
table.</p>

<p>"Now we're comfortable." Murmer rested his head back in the
chair and blew a perfect smoke ring towards the ceiling. He watched
it until it broke, then sent another in the same direction,
following it with a third. "Surprising how friendly tobacco seems
to make men towards one another." The Englishman spoke apparently
to himself. "No&mdash;I can't smoke anything but the cheapest of
cigarettes&mdash;and then only on occasions. Good tobacco upsets
me. Know Mr. Griffiths well, Mr. Skields?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"No? Didn't like him?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Now, that's funny. Quite a lot of people didn't like Stanley
Griffiths&mdash;at first. Especially women. See much of him, Mr.
Skields? Didn't belong to the same clubs? Didn't run together? What
kind of a bridge game did he play, Mr. Skields?"</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>"Have the same bookmaker and the same bootlegger? Oh, I forgot,
we're in Australia, not America."</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;" Skields turned irritatedly on the stout detective,
"What are you getting at?"</p>

<p>"Know a Dr. Bastion, Mr. Skields?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Neither do I." Murmer stated the fact as if it constituted a
bond between himself and the man he was questioning. "All the same,
you know more of him than I do. You've spoken with him twice on the
same day."</p>

<p>Skields did not answer. Not a muscle of his face showed
interest.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer continued: "No, I don't know Dr. Bastion; and
Dr. Bastion doesn't know you, so he's not interested. What letters
of yours did Mr. Griffiths have, Mr. Skields?"</p>

<p>The man started to his feet. "Now, look here, what game are you
playing, inspector&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Murmer." The Englishman gave his name with closed eyes, an
expression of weariness on his face. "Saul Murmer. Sit down, Mr.
Skields&mdash;or before you do, let me introduce Inspector
Pater&mdash;John Pater."</p>

<p>"You haven't answered my question."</p>

<p>"How great minds think alike." Murmer's right eye unclosed
slightly, betraying a little twinkle. "If I'm not mistaken, you
were asked many questions the answers to which are still
unrecorded."</p>

<p>"I'm not bound to answer your questions."</p>

<p>"Yet I've answered yours. I even took the liberty of answering
questions you asked of Dr. Bastion, when you were anxious to have
news of your friend, Stanley Griffiths&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's no friend of mine," growled Skields. "And I'm not going to
sit here wasting my time with you. I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ever possessed a revolver, Mr. Skields?"</p>

<p>"I'm not answering questions. If you've got&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very comfortable cells downstairs, Mr. Skields. Mayn't have all
the comfort of a modern flat. But there are no
distractions&mdash;like neighbours' gramophones and cocktail
parties. Plenty of time for meditation."</p>

<p>"Then you are arresting me?" Skields' eyes opened wider. "You
forget; in that case you should warn me."</p>

<p>"Dear me&mdash;and I forgot." There was a hint of sarcasm in the
bland voice. "Do you think you've been indiscreet in your answers
to the questions you've already answered? Would you like to amend
those answers? Remember&mdash;I've not arrested you&mdash;yet!"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're dealing with murder." Murmer's tones were mild. "Last
night a man was killed. This morning a man telephoned inquiries
concerning the murdered man&mdash;and John and I thought we'd like
a little friendly chat with the&mdash;inquirer."</p>

<p>"I'm not interested in Stanley Griffiths."</p>

<p>"Yet interested in the well-being of Arthur Skields?" Awkwardly
Murmer wriggled out of the tight-fitting chair. "What are the
nature of the letters you required Mr. Griffiths to return to
you&mdash;immediately?"</p>

<p>Skields shrugged.</p>

<p>"You're not interested in Stanley Griffiths&mdash;yet you write
him a letter that contained threats. You telephoned a demand for
letters to be returned to you to&mdash;and you stated
you'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>Skields shrugged again. He reached for his hat and turned to the
door.</p>

<p>"Good-day, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"There's a nice, big, hefty sergeant of police at the foot of
the stairs, Mr. Skields." Murmer seated himself again in his chair.
"Behind him, in the common room, are a number of strong lads, all
eager for a bit of&mdash;er&mdash;trouble. They just love it.
Sergeant Nicholls is peculiar. He doesn't like people roaming about
police headquarters unattended."</p>

<p>"Then I am under arrest?"</p>

<p>"Did you know Mr. Stanley Griffiths well, Mr. Skields?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to answer."</p>

<p>"Were you in Wonthaggi-Avenue last night, Mr. Skields?" Murmer
continued.</p>

<p>"No." A spark of satisfaction lit the ill-matched eyes. "At no
time last night&mdash;or early this morning?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"An alibi!" Murmer shrugged. "Everybody has them!"</p>

<p>"You can't shift mine." There was triumph in the man's voice. "I
dined with two men&mdash;my brother, Ernest Skields, and a friend,
George Martin. After dinner we went to Ernest's house and played
poker until three o'clock this morning. Then George Martin took a
taxi to his hotel&mdash;the Splendide&mdash;and dropped me at my
home on his way into the city."</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" Murmer closed his eyes with a sigh. "John, it would
be interesting to meet two gentlemen who can amuse themselves for
six consecutive hours at a poker game. Believe you consider
yourself a bit of an expert at poker; perhaps Mr. Skields will put
you in the way of meeting these&mdash;enthusiasts!"</p>

<p>Arthur Skields turned, glaring at the stout man lounging in the
chair before the window, his head back, his eyes closed, the small
well-kept fingers clasped over a well-rounded corpulence. For half
a minute he hesitated, then shrugged and turned to Inspector Pater,
supplying the addresses required.</p>

<p>He took a step towards the door, then looked again at the
Englishman: "Well!"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the letters, Mr. Skields?" Although his eyes were
closed Murmer seemed to know the man was looking at him.</p>

<p>"I refuse to discuss any letters."</p>

<p>"So sorry." Apparently Murmer subsided into profound slumber.
Skields looked at Inspector Pater, who nodded. With another
half-questioning, half-scornful glance at the stout man in the
chair, Skields left the room.</p>

<p>Immediately the door closed Murmer opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Difficult," he muttered. His eyes travelled to the cigarette
case lying where Skields had left it on the corner of the desk.</p>

<p>"Scotty in his office, John?"</p>

<p>"Rather obvious, wasn't it, Saul?" Pater smiled slightly. "He
must have known that case was produced for his fingerprints."</p>

<p>"I meant it to be obvious." A fat, lazy smile crept on to the
well-formed lips. The baby-blue eyes twinkled. "Y'see John, he
couldn't very well refuse to take hold of that case, although you
had to force it on him a bit. But if he'd refused to take
it&mdash;" Murmer relapsed into seeming unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater turned to the telephone and rang up the
fingerprints department. In a few minutes Ted Scott entered the
room. Murmer indicated the cigarette case.</p>

<p>"Inspector Pater's fingerprints, and mine. Also, I trust, the
fingerprints of the man who shot Stanley Griffiths. You'll take
care of the case for me, Scotty. The cigarettes I don't hope to see
again. Petty larceny is not unknown within these walls, I
believe."</p>

<p>Immediately the finger-prints man had left the room Murmer came
to his feet, all signs of lethargy gone.</p>

<p>"Coming for a ride, John?"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater nodded, and followed his comrade out of the
room.</p>

<p>In George-street they mounted a quay-bound tram. Alighting at
King-street they walked up to Pitt-street, and entered Mallington
House. At the third floor they left the elevator.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Murmer after an inspection of the corridor.
He led the way to a glass door on which was painted the words:
"Griffiths and Chalmers, Stock and Share Brokers."</p>

<p>A girl seated at a switchboard behind a counter looked up as the
two detectives entered the office.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanley Griffiths, if you please," Murmer said gently.</p>

<p>"Mr. Griffiths has not come to the office yet," the girl
replied, barely glancing up. "Mr. Chalmers is in."</p>

<p>"Sorry, I wished to see Mr. Griffiths."</p>

<p>The stout inspector appeared worried. "Rather important,
too!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Chalmers&mdash;" suggested the girl, helpfully.</p>

<p>"Don't think so." The worried frown deepened on the full face.
Then a light of understanding appeared to dawn. "Sure, I never
thought of that. Mr. Griffiths has a personal secretary&mdash;a
young lady&mdash;hasn't he? Perhaps she could attend to me?"</p>

<p>"Miss Anstey!" The inquiry clerk looked doubtful. She hesitated,
glancing up at the detectives, then plugged a connection. She spoke
into the instrument in an undertone, then looked up:</p>

<p>"Miss Anstey will be out in a moment. Will you please take a
seat?" A buzz at the instrument and the girl turned to it, making a
connection. Murmer stood watching her, a little puzzled pucker
between his eyes. He glanced round as a young girl came out of one
of the doors and approached the counter.</p>

<p>"I understand you are asking for Mr. Griffiths."</p>

<p>The girl spoke to Murmer. "I am sorry, he is not in at the
moment."</p>

<p>"This young lady says he's not come to the office yet?"</p>

<p>Miss Anstey nodded, speculation in her eyes.</p>

<p>"And you, young lady; you're his personal secretary?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded again.</p>

<p>"Been with him long, miss?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I'm called on to answer questions like that." The
girl spoke shortly, a flush on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I think you might&mdash;this once, miss." Murmer slid a card on
the counter under the girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"A detective!" Miss Anstey looked up, startled. "Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Been with Mr. Griffiths long, miss?"</p>

<p>"Two years&mdash;" she paused. "Has&mdash;has anything happened
to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Mr. Griffiths will not be at the office this
morning, Miss Anstey." Murmer hesitated. "You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's&mdash;" The girl looked up, startled; her face growing
deathly white. "Then that letter&mdash;You're&mdash;you're telling
me he's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer reached hastily across the counter, catching
the girl under her arms and holding her erect, while Inspector
Pater went around the counter and took her from him, carrying her
to a chair.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">SAUBER'S restaurant occupies the whole of the
ground floor of Wenn's House, situated at the apex of Wenn's Court,
a narrow alley opening out of Pitt-street. Wenn's House had once
been a warehouse in the days before the great stores of the city
were pushed back from the three big main arteries into the long,
narrow space between George-street and Darling Harbour. A tall,
stone built erection, it had been remodelled for offices, and
quickly found tenants.</p>

<p>Max Sauber, a short, stout German, with a red, beaming face and
a genius for cooking, had rented the ground floor, catering for a
rather elaborate businessmen's lunch. His venture had proved
successful from the outset and very quickly Sauber's restaurant
became the mid-day centre of commercial life in that quarter of the
city. Again the hand of time ordered the City of Sydney.</p>

<p>The younger, more frivolous generation of superior clerks and
business secretaries discovered Sauber's and approved. With the
passionate intensity of their generation they undertook the
proprietor's education in the matter of modern meals. Sauber
abandoned the silver grill, with its inevitable chop and steak, in
favour of strange and bizarre-named dishes. His trade extended from
the two-hour lunch interval to morning and afternoon teas.</p>

<p>An expensive radio-set with discreet loud-speakers added to the
din of many voices. Then came the dinner hour menu. Many of his
patrons were hopeful that with a little more persuasion Sauber
might a venture towards a jazz-band and a supper-dance.</p>

<p>Rather unexpectedly, his old-fashioned luncheon patrons accepted
the alterations with little demur. They gazed, with mild
astonishment through round spectacles, on the weird decorations
that appear inseparable from three-decker sandwiches and sundaes.
They rubbed shoulders with their chief clerks and personal
secretaries without a blush. A few of the more advanced and bolder
ones acquired the habit of accompanying their personal secretaries
to the mid-day meal.</p>

<p>Then, ever advancing in the absorption of the city for public
services, a paternal Government moved one of its larger departments
to the vicinity of Wenn's Court. Thereafter, a discreet assortment
of civil servants blended into the commercial life of the
restaurant and definitely advanced Sauber's ever-growing trade.</p>

<p>On leaving the offices of Griffiths and Chalmers, after Miss
Anstey had recovered from her fainting fit and they had undergone a
purposeless interview with Mr. Rupert Chalmers, Inspectors Murmer
and Pater sought sustenance at Sauber's restaurant.</p>

<p>Murmer, comparatively fresh from London, where the line of
social caste is drawn more closely than in any other city of the
world except Berlin, found the mixed gathering of great interest.
He ate slowly gazing about him openly with the baby-like eyes that
concealed the keen, swift working brain. He noted the slim dressed
girls and their escorts, the casual mingling and salutations of
those who pay salaries and those who honour by acceptance, during
the mid-day respite.</p>

<p>Pater leaned back in his seat and beckoned to the daintily
uniformed girl carrying the overgrown coffee-pot, hovering near.
His cup replenished he pulled out pipe and pouch and prepared the
after-meal smoke.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said at length, catching his companion's eyes. "Are
you satisfied?"</p>

<p>Murmer's head turned slowly in a quarter-circle. He noted that
the two adjacent compartments were empty. His fingers fumbled in
the side-pocket of his jacket and brought out a crushed paper
packet containing a few cigarettes. Placing one of the rolls
between his lips, he flicked a lighter into action.</p>

<p>"She wasn't the girl," he said.</p>

<p>"Your face showed that." Pater laughed gently. "I haven't seen
you so set back before, Saul."</p>

<p>"When a young lady misses on all cylinders on hearing that her
beloved employer has gone the way of all flesh&mdash;" The stout
detective's eyes twinkled. "And such an employer!"</p>

<p>"Then you think Griffiths&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you a doubt?" The lightly-lined eyebrows in the broad,
round face raised, wrinkling the smooth forehead
"&mdash;considering what we know of Griffiths."</p>

<p>"Then Miss Anstey is&mdash;was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just another one," the big man sighed. "And the modern
newspapers assure us that the girl of this era&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is just as sickly sentimental, just as much governed by her
emotion as her grandmother. You're forgetting Gretna Green, Saul;
and you tell me you were born within a few miles of it."</p>

<p>"Gretna Green doesn't exist to day," Murmer carefully
explained.</p>

<p>&gt;"Does that matter particularly&mdash;to the modern girl?
She's dispensed with the chaperone, quite a lot of
clothing&mdash;and a few morals&mdash;then why not the blacksmith
as well?"</p>

<p>"That doesn't explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doesn't it?" The Australian detective spoke in an undertone.
"Reckon up what we've discovered, Saul. Just this! You investigate
a house whose street-door you find open at midnight. You find a
young lady sitting in an upstairs room and she, apparently
resenting your inquisitiveness lures you into a bedroom and turns
the key on you. When you release yourself you find that the girl
has been sitting on a couch drawn forward to cover the corpse of a
man. You discover that the man, in life, hadn't much of a
reputation&mdash;or too much of one&mdash;which ever way you choose
to look at things. The young lady, has disappeared."</p>

<p>"And Arthur Skields comes on the scene," Murmer added. "Wonder
if this place has a telephone?"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater pointed to the instrument on the wall, close by.
Struggling awkwardly out of the confined space into which he had
wedged himself for his lunch, Murmer ambled over to the instrument.
A few sentences exchanged with some person at the other end of the
wire, and he rejoined Inspector Pater.</p>

<p>"Thought Scotty might have some news," he explained.</p>

<p>"And has he?"</p>

<p>"If you can call it news. The fingerprints on the revolver are
not those of Arthur Skields?" Murmer shrugged.</p>

<p>"Our crooks and murderers have graduated beyond the elementary
classes. Or I shouldn't be enjoying the company of an eminent
detective from a department many thousands of miles away!"</p>

<p>"Yet a bullet from that revolver killed Griffiths," stated
Murmer, taking no notice of his companion's remark.</p>

<p>"That's so!" Inspector Pater looked up sharply. "Did Scotty tell
you that?"</p>

<p>The Englishman nodded.</p>

<p>"Then we're still at the beginning," Pater mused. "Wonder why
Skields was so antagonistic?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has something to conceal."</p>

<p>Inspector Pater gazed at his companion in mock admiration.</p>

<p>"I'm learning something, Saul. Now, tell me how detectives from
London know that the crooks of Sydney, when faced with a police
inquisition, behave as if they had something to conceal?"</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer passed the slight sarcasm with a shrug. He was
staring, open-eyed, towards the entrance. Inspector Pater turned
hastily. A man and girl were entering the restaurant. He turned to
watch Murmer again. The detective was watching the progress of the
couple with eager eyes. When they came to a vacant compartment and
seated themselves, he turned to Pater.</p>

<p>"Gosh!"</p>

<p>"You mean the girl in the room?" Inspector Pater spoke with a
trace of excitement in his voice. His companion's expression had
been easy to interpret. He turned again to watch the couple. "Sure
you're not mistaken, Saul? She doesn't look disturbed."</p>

<p>"She may later." A grimness underlay the Englishman's tones.</p>

<p>Pater was not attending to him. He was watching the girl and the
man. They were looking up the room, and he had caught a glimpse of
their faces. Inspector Pater showed his surprise on his face.</p>

<p>"What's got you, John?" The stout man had deliberately turned
his shoulder to the couple. "Know her?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;him."</p>

<p>"So?" Murmer leaned forward across the table. "Well?"</p>

<p>"That's young Dizzy Laine, of the <i>Post-Advertiser</i>."</p>

<p>"Don't think I've met him. I've always left the gentlemen of the
Press to you&mdash;they bore me with their everlasting
questionings." Murmer had shifted round on his seat until his broad
back was to the pair. He was staring into the palm of his hand, on
which rested a small circular mirror. "Dizzy?"</p>

<p>"Poor devil!" John Pater laughed. "His parents had the nerve to
name him 'Paul Disraeli.' He signed himself 'Paul D.' but the
newsboys fathomed the 'D.' and the inevitable Dizzy resulted."</p>

<p>"What's he to the girl?" asked Murmer.</p>

<p>"Don't know, but I should think quite a lot&mdash;or she to him.
I've never seen them together before. Dizzy only comes to
headquarters when there's anything really big on. He's the
newspaper's star man. Gets the front page, and all that."</p>

<p>"He's got one with him now if he only knew it." The Englishman's
cupid-bow lips were set in a straight line. "Know him well,
John?"</p>

<p>"Well enough for him to worry the life out of me when I'm on
anything in which he's interested."</p>

<p>"Then come on." Murmer struggled out of the box-like space. "You
can introduce me."</p>

<p>The stout detective stopped one of the waitresses and engaged
her in conversation. John Pater strolled down the restaurant. When
Murmer went to follow him he was standing before the compartment in
which the girl and Dizzy Laine sat.</p>

<p>The newspaper-man rose and held out his hand when Murmer halted
beside Inspector Pater and the latter performed the usual
introductions. The Englishman examined the young man carefully. He
saw a tall, wholesome-looking youngster of about 25 years of age,
with an ugly freckled face lightened by a good-humoured expression
and ready smile that attracted. The rather small grey eyes were
keen, yet held no uncharitableness.</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you, Mr. Murmer. I've heard a lot about you, but
haven't managed to run up against you since you've been in Sydney.
What do you think of our harbour and city?"</p>

<p>"Do you ask everyone from overseas that?" said Murmer
gravely.</p>

<p>"Everyone," said Dizzy firmly. "It's our stock question. Your
standing in the community hereafter depends on your answer to that
question. If you reply suitably, and with sufficient enthusiasm,
there will be a column spread, with photographs and a detailed
record of your career from the age of seven days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I don't reply suitably, or with sufficient enthusiasm?"
inquired Murmer.</p>

<p>"Then the news-editor will bury your biography deep in the
morgue and we shall be inquisitive why they keep you under cover in
Central Lane."</p>

<p>"They'd have some work to do that!" grinned Murmer, looking down
at his ample form. "No, they couldn't do that without giving the
Australian crooks too free a hand."</p>

<p>Dizzy Laine laughed, a pleasant, ringing laugh that brought
smiles to the faces of his companions.</p>

<p>"And, as a cover I'm afraid Inspector Pater would be of little
use to you. I hear you're working with him."</p>

<p>Dizzy turned to the girl. "Addie, may I introduce our two most
famous detectives&mdash;Inspectors Murmer and Pater. Inspector
Murmer is a very famous English detective, at present visiting
Australia to learn the ways of our crooks and to instruct our
no-account detective branch." He looked up at the two men standing
beside the table. "Miss Poulton. Say, won't you join us?"</p>

<p>"You two might sit on one side of this table," remarked Murmer
consideringly, "but John would have to stand&mdash;and he wouldn't
like that. Sydney's not considerate to&mdash;to gentlemen of
girth."</p>

<p>For the first time since he had come to that compartment, Murmer
allowed his eyes to meet the girl's. He saw no signs of recognition
in them&mdash;yet she could not mistake him. She held out her hand,
and her fingers closed on his with a comradely grip. Murmer sighed;
sure this girl had nerve!</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you, Miss Poulton." Murmer managed to retain
her hand for a moment longer than formal. "Say, haven't we met
before? I seem to remember you well?"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes widened. She looked up innocently into the
baby-blue eyes staring intently down on her, and a smile came on
her well-formed lips. "I don't think so, Mr. Murmer. If we have met
before, I've been rude enough to forget it."</p>

<p>"Ever been in Edgecliff, Miss Poulton?"</p>

<p>"Occasionally. I do not live there."</p>

<p>"Ever met the late Mr. Stanley Griffiths, Miss Poulton?" The
Englishman spoke with seeming carelessness.</p>

<p>"The late&mdash;" She drew her fingers from the detective's grip
abruptly. "I&mdash;I don't think I have ever met Mr.
Griffiths&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Pater?" Dizzy Laine interrupted, with a
hint of anger in his tones. "Miss Poulton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I met a Mr. Stanley Griffiths last night," Murmer took on
himself the reply. "With him was a young lady."</p>

<p>"Miss Poulton was with me last night," Dizzy interrupted
shortly. "We were at His Majesty's Theatre for the show and then
went to Dalmano's for supper. I took her home about two o'clock
this morning."</p>

<p>"Sorry." Murmer did not look discomposed. "I must have made
a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the game, Pater?" Dizzy ignored the English detective.
"Stanley Griffiths was murdered last night&mdash;shot in his home.
I've been at the office this morning; and I saw the report turned
in by the night roundsman." He turned to Murmer. "You're not trying
to link Miss Poulton up with that man?"</p>

<p>"Keep your hair on, Dizzy." Pater spoke soothingly. "Saul's not
suggesting anything. He's had a few adventures during the past
twenty-four hours and they've disturbed his outlook on life. These
Londoners are not used to Australian speed."</p>

<p>With a nod to the man and the girl, he caught Murmer's arm and
led him from the restaurant. In Pitt-street, Murmer released
himself with a jerk; he turned and stared back at the
restaurant.</p>

<p>"What of that fellow&mdash;Dizzy Laine, you call him?" he asked
abruptly. "Crook?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life! As straight as they make 'em," Inspector
Pater replied immediately. "Lord, Saul, you put a raw one over
there. We'll never hear the last of it."</p>

<p>"We won't&mdash;I don't intend we shall." There was an
inflexible tone in the Englishman's voice. "Neither will they, that
I'll promise them. John, I'll swear that girl was the one I saw in
Griffiths room. I'll swear it now, and by God I'll swear in another
place."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">"&mdash;AND that you should make a break like
that, Saul! Well, I wouldn't have thought it of you."</p>

<p>The two detectives were in the room they shared at police
headquarters. Inspector Murmer, as usual, was ensconced in the big
lounge chair by the window, puffing steadily at the inevitable
cheap cigarette. John Pater was striding up and down the room,
obviously perturbed. Saul Murmer was not entirely at ease. He
recognised that his surprise on meeting the girl in Sauber's
restaurant had caused him to make a serious break. True he still
believed that his suspicions were well-founded&mdash;that Addie
Poulton was the girl he had talked to in Stanley Griffiths
room&mdash;yet he admitted, even to himself, that his recognition
was entirely unsupported; that, opposed to the alibi Dizzy Laine
had given, he had no grounds on which he could act.</p>

<p>Two fine vertical lines between his eyebrows alone denoted that
he was worried. To the Australian detective he appeared as
unruffled as usual.</p>

<p>"And to Dizzy Laine, of all people." Pater ran his fingers
through his hair, in perplexity. "Lord, man! We're going to have an
earful of this. You got him right up on his hind legs in that
restaurant, and with the alibi he gave the girl&mdash;why, you
haven't a leg to stand on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alibis have been broken before now, John," Murmer threw the
stub of his cigarette through the window and wriggled himself into
a position where he could fish for another in his jacket
side-pocket.</p>

<p>"Alibi, be damned!" Inspector Patel groaned. "As if an alibi was
all. Don't you recognise, man, he's got us cold-served up on a
platter and carefully garnished with the best fish-sauce! Gosh!
John the Baptist has nothing on us."</p>

<p>"Dizzy Laine, journalist!" Murmer spoke in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Yes, a journalist!" Inspector Pater turned suddenly. "A
journalist who does things. We don't say much about it, but there's
been times when Dizzy Laine helped us quite a lot. He's got a flair
for getting information&mdash;information that the police find
difficult to get&mdash;Lord! I'm betting he's with the Commissioner
now, demanding our heads on chargers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;if he don't get 'em?" A slow smile curved the full,
red lips.</p>

<p>"Then he'll take it out of us in that damned rag of
his&mdash;and let me tell you the <i>Post-Advertiser</i> is nothing
to smile at. Dizzy Laine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentleman to see you and Inspector Murmer, sir." A constable
spoke from the doorway.</p>

<p>"Damn the gentleman!" Inspector Pater strode round his desk and
threw himself into his chair. "Tell him to go to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Murmer caught the constable's eyes and nodded. The man left the
room quickly.</p>

<p>"Suppose we'd better see him," grumbled Pater, aroused by the
closing of the door. "Some damned fool who's lost his back teeth
and has a friend who has a friend who has nodded to me in the
streets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're going to see him," said Saul Murmer, tranquilly. "It'll
stave off Dizzy, anyway."</p>

<p>Pater squared himself to his desk and smoothed his hair. "Lord,
Saul, you've let us in for something."</p>

<p>"A drift of smoke sometimes located a fire." The Englishman was
staring at the door. "Now, I have an idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened, and for a moment the tall form of the constable
showed. He stepped aside, and Arthur Skields walked into the
room.</p>

<p>"&mdash;that Mr. Arthur Skields has re-considered his position
and has come to the decision that it is impolitic to quarrel with
two noted members of the Detective Branch of the New South Wales
Police Department." Murmer completed his sentence, ignoring the
fact that the man he mentioned was in the room.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you came to guess that, Inspector Murmer." A
broad smile parted Skields' lips. "You're right. I did a bit of
considering and came to the conclusion that I was a bit of
a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So, the Psalmist has stated," interrupted Murmer.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That all men are liars; you'll find that statement in one of
his prose poems."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Then you weren't at a poker party last night?' asked Inspector
Pater.</p>

<p>"I was." Skields came further into the room and seated himself
before the desk. "I was playing poker with my brother and Martin;
and Martin drove me home. Really, I came to apologise for my show
of bad temper."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't shoot Stanley Griffiths?" Almost disappointment
showed on Murmer's face.</p>

<p>"Sorry not to be able to oblige you," Skields grinned. "I'm not
going to say I regret he's dead. I'll admit, if you like, that I'm
damned sorry I didn't pump a magazine of bullets into his rotten
carcass. I'll say that, if I had thought of it, I might
pro&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you didn't." Inspector Murmer wriggled himself into a more
comfortable attitude in the lounge chair. "Now, as you say, if he
deserved it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"That's your opinion." The Englishman at last attained the
position he aimed at. "Unpleasant sort of fellow, Mr. Skields?
Smoke?"</p>

<p>The man took the cigarette case with a loud laugh. "Want any
more fingerprints, Inspector Murmer?"</p>

<p>"I always told Sir Gregory I was too obvious for a detective."
There was chagrin in Murmer's voice. "So you saw through the
trick?"</p>

<p>"Not until I'd thought things over. Then my fingerprints were
not on that gun?"</p>

<p>"Did you expect them to be?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't sure. With Stanley Griffiths one isn't sure of
anything."</p>

<p>"Then you expected his murder?" snapped Pater.</p>

<p>Skields glanced at the stout detective before the window. Murmer
had, apparently, lost all interest in the visitor; he was staring
out of the window, his lips pursed in a low whistle.</p>

<p>"You expected that Stanley Griffiths would be murdered?" asked
Pater again.</p>

<p>"I did!" Skields turned his attention to the Australian. "With a
man of Griffiths habits a natural death could not be
anticipated."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Skields means that Mr. Griffiths had the faculty of
stirring to anger sex elements in men and women&mdash;in women to
suit his purposes, in man the primitive instinct for revenge for
injuries done to women they possess or covet." For a brief moment
the Englishman faced the room.</p>

<p>Skields nodded. "Mr. Murmer has stated the position fairly," he
said.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" concluded Inspector Pater "&mdash;to take
Inspector Murmer's definition, you were a male seeking
revenge?"</p>

<p>"If you like." A shrug accompanied the admission.</p>

<p>"Yet you had not thought of shooting him?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I had advanced so far at the time somebody
anticipated my sub-conscious desire." A strange, primitive light
shone behind the man's eyes. "I believe that up to&mdash;well, say
yesterday&mdash;I had only wished and anticipated something
supremely uncomfortable for him in the future&mdash;"</p>

<p>Skields was interrupted by a little chuckling laugh from the man
seated at the window.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater took no notice of Murmer's merriment. He was
devoting all his attention to the man on the other side of the
desk.</p>

<p>"You think there were others who held thoughts regarding Stanley
Griffiths, on similar lines to those you have described for
yourself?"</p>

<p>"People don't talk of such things&mdash;except in general
exclamatory terms," said Skields angrily. "If you're asking for an
opinion, not evidence, I'll say I believe there were many who would
have been relieved to see Stanley Griffiths as&mdash;" He turned to
the man in the window, "&mdash;as you saw him last."</p>

<p>"Are you willing to give me their names?" asked Pater.</p>

<p>"No." The negative was very final. "All I have is
conjecture&mdash;If you like, the talk of the clubs&mdash;There
were plenty Stan Griffiths had put the dirty on, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How well did you know Griffiths?"</p>

<p>"At one time, very well."</p>

<p>"You were intimate friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And, you quarrelled?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"For what reason, or reasons?" Pater waited on the question, but
Skields did not reply. His eyes had become blanks.</p>

<p>"For what reasons?" repeated the detective.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can suggest one." With an effort Murmer turned in the
close-fitting chair to face the desk. "Messrs. Skields and
Griffiths were firm friends. They were both fond of good times
and&mdash;and the ladies&mdash;" He broke off to glance at Skields
and ask: "I am right, Mr. Skields; am I not?"</p>

<p>The man nodded. "Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Murmer showed his satisfaction. "Well, about six months ago Mr.
Skields met a lady named&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should prefer to keep her name out of it," said Skields
quickly.</p>

<p>"Why?" The light eyebrows of the man in the window seat moved up
in interrogation. "The lady's name has already been mentioned in
connection with Griffiths death; Miss Poulton."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot follow you, Inspector Murmer." Skields'
tones were cold.</p>

<p>"You know Miss Poulton?" asked Pater.</p>

<p>"I have that honour."</p>

<p>"Mr. Griffiths knew Miss Poulton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, damn him!" The man's control gave way suddenly.</p>

<p>"I told him to keep away from her.</p>

<p>"You threatened him?"</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. Skields had risen to his feet
and was staring across the desk into the coldly questioning eyes of
the detective.</p>

<p>"You threatened him?" Pater asked again.</p>

<p>"Yes, blast you!" The man's nerve had now given under the keen
questioning. "Blast you! Blast him&mdash;he thought he could drive
her along the road he had driven others&mdash;other women. He
thought that because she liked a good time&mdash;because some fool
had called her the 'Flirting Fool'&mdash;blast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'The Flirting Fool?' What do you mean by that, Mr.
Skields?"</p>

<p>"Find out, damn you! Am I responsible for all the blasted talk
that goes on in this town. If you think that, you're wrong.
I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's get this straight." Inspector Murmer's cool tones broke
on the man's heated words. "I take it, Mr. Skields, that you and
Mr. Griffiths became acquainted with Miss Poulton about the same
time. She attracted both of you. You&mdash;you found a serious
interest in life&mdash;in her. Mr. Griffiths believed he had
discovered yet another&mdash;er&mdash;butterfly&mdash;that would
give the spice you and he looked for to your
little&mdash;parties."</p>

<p>"I told him to keep away from her&mdash;that if he spoke to her
again I'd&mdash;" Skields shouted, in the heat of blind
passion.</p>

<p>"You'd shoot him." The cool tones from the window seat supplied
the rest of the sentence. "And, did you?"</p>

<p>"I told him I'd thrash him within an inch of his life," Skields
shouted. "And I'd have done it. And, I'll thrash you, too, if you
dare to bring her into&mdash;" For second he hesitated, trying to
control the passion that had mastered him. He turned to face
Inspector Murmer, before his heat of anger turned to a cold
concentrated fury.</p>

<p>"I've been a rotter, I know. There's no one more sorry for it
now than I am. I'd give ten years of what remains of my life to be
able to retrace my steps. But I can't do that. I didn't shoot
Griffiths. I swear to that. I can prove where I was when&mdash;when
someone with more spunk than I've got did shoot him. I honour and
admire that man&mdash;and if I can do anything to help him keep
from the so-called justice that demands his life for the life of
that rotter&mdash;keep him out of the clutches of you damned
man-hunters&mdash;I'll do it, even if I have to go to gaol for the
rest of my life. I'd do anything for him. Hear that? Anything! He
can have all I've got&mdash;every penny. I'll serve
him&mdash;protect him&mdash;grovel to him for his pluck. That's me,
Arthur Skields. Get that into your thick heads, damn you! I'm for
him, every second, in this world and through what those snivelling
parsons call eternity. I envy him. He's a&mdash;a man&mdash;a
<i>man</i>&mdash;damn you!"</p>

<p>Snatching up his hat he plunged blindly through the door,
slamming it after him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">IMMEDIATELY the door closed, with a shattering
bang shaking police headquarters, the two Inspectors became aware
of a commotion in the corridor without. Inspector Pater, with a
deep frown gathering on his brow, strode to the door and pulled it
open.</p>

<p>"What the hell's the row out here?" he demanded. Then in quieter
tones: "Oh, it's you, Dizzy?"</p>

<p>"What's left of what used to be me," stated the newspaper-man,
limping into the room. "Say, John Pater, has headquarters set up an
official menagerie at last? I've often advised them to wonderful
specimens here, and all that. Who the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I gather that Mr. Arthur Skields was just a little brusque,"
suggested Inspector Murmer quietly.</p>

<p>"A little brusque!" Dizzy stared. "If you call rushing out of a
room without looking where he's going; slamming doors and walking
over a noted, well-advertised journalist coming innocently up the
stairs; and then cursing him violently for getting in the way 'a
little brusque'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The idiosyncrasies of an undisciplined disposition," mused the
Englishman. "Phychologically, should we blame the individuals? The
complexities&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm blaming the individual, or rather the individuals," said
Dizzy firmly. "In spite of any undisciplined idiosyncrasies that
police headquarters choose to let loose upon what are, after all,
public thoroughfares&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You refer to the private staircases and corridors of police
headquarters?" asked Murmer, opening wide his baby-blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I do." Dizzy sank into a chair and rubbed the calf of his left
leg. "In spite of the mad men you choose to keep here, I've come to
know what the hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A particularly favourite word in the office today," Inspector
Murmer interjected. "Mr. Skields gave it a fair airing. John has
frequently mentioned it during the past hour or so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then John Pater has been attempting to correct the crazy
idiosyncrasies of Saul Murmer?" Dizzy stared at the stout detective
comfortably ensconced in the big chair. "Good for him! Now you're
going to listen to a few words from me, and if I offend your
delicate Pommy ears with the word you so eloquently complain
about&mdash;or have a particular affection for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John thought you'd gone to the Commissioner," said Murmer,
inconsequently.</p>

<p>"I might have, if I'd thought of it," acknowledged the newspaper
man with a broad grin. "Or&mdash;".</p>

<p>"You might have written a column or so on the pernicious third
degree methods of the New South Wales Detective Branch, adducing
many awful examples. Why didn't you?" The wide baby blue eyes
opened in an innocent stare. "No doubt, if you had, your noted
periodical would have signified its approval in
the&mdash;er&mdash;usual manner."</p>

<p>For a moment Dizzy stared, then laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"I understand. You're trying to side-track the issue. Well, you
don't. I've come to find out why you're trying to mix Miss Poulton
up in this Griffiths murder&mdash;and I'm going to find out."</p>

<p>"Then Miss Poulton did know Stanley Griffiths?" asked
Murmer.</p>

<p>"She remembers being introduced to him&mdash;or speaking to him
once."</p>

<p>"Who by?"</p>

<p>Dizzy started to speak, then hesitated. He stared at the
Englishman with quiet amusement on his ugly, honest face.</p>

<p>"Going to put me through it, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Have you objections?"</p>

<p>Again the journalist was silent for some moments. He turned to
Inspector Pater.</p>

<p>"What's he up to, John? I thought he came out here for
experience."</p>

<p>"He sure needs it," interposed Murmer, softly.</p>

<p>"Whereas he's taking the lead teaching you New South Welshmen
how to do it."</p>

<p>"Do what?" asked Murmer in the same small voice.</p>

<p>Dizzy leaned back in his chair, lighting a cigarette and
surveying the stout man with, amusement.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be vulgar," he said at length, "and quote an old
song? 'Are there any more at home like you?' No!" he continued as
Murmer went to reply, "don't answer. I know there are. It's a
peculiar London trait and, unfortunately, in this country we
mistake Londoners for typical Englishmen."</p>

<p>"Even my neglected education informs me that London is the
capital of England," murmured the stout detective.</p>

<p>"It isn't." The newspaper-man was emphatic. "Modern London is an
entrenched invader in the heart of a conquered country. No one but
a&mdash;a foreigner or a very uneducated person would accept
Londoners as typically English. They're as unlike the real article
as&mdash;as chalk and cheese."</p>

<p>"Libellous&mdash;but almost true." From behind the mask of his
innocent stare Murmer was studying the journalist interestedly.
Dizzy Laine, he told himself, was an antagonist worthy of any
man.</p>

<p>"Hardly libellous&mdash;and very true."</p>

<p>Dizzy stretched his long legs before him, smiling. But behind
the wide smile lurked an iron purpose. In some ways he liked this
London detective. He thought that when he knew him better he would
like him greatly. For the moment he knew him for an antagonist it
would take all his wit and nerve to combat. He was determined that
Addie Poulton should not be drawn into the sordid business that
made the days of police headquarters.</p>

<p>"I'm guessing that you have questioned Miss Poulton?" said
Murmer.</p>

<p>"I have, and I'm satisfied," Dizzy answered shortly. "Is that
sufficient for you?" His eyes went from the stout detective seated
at the window to John Pater, tall and soldierly, behind the
desk.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater nodded. "Divided opinions!" Dizzy laughed again.
"Miss Poulton is still under Inspector Murmer's suspicions."</p>

<p>"Look here, Dizzy." Inspector Pater spoke suddenly. "You've read
the story. 'Sleepy' Andrews came round last night&mdash;or I should
say this morning&mdash;and got it from the desk sergeant. I've seen
your rag. What's published is substantially true&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Substantially true!" The journalist's quick eyes went from one
to the other of the men before him. He noticed that Inspector
Murmer was moving restlessly in his chair.</p>

<p>"Hold up, Saul." Pater spoke to his comrade. "Sorry, but you've
got to go through with it. Dizzy is safe, and I'm going to show him
you've good reasons for your suspicions. It's this way, Dizzy." he
turned to the newspaper-man. "Saul found Griffiths house open, and
as it was after midnight became curious. He entered and in an
upstairs room found a young lady seated on a couch. By a trick she
lured him to one of the bedrooms, and locked him in it. There she
made her mistake. When Saul got out he found, under the couch on
which the girl had been seated, the body of Stanley Griffiths,
stabbed and shot."</p>

<p>While Inspector Pater had been speaking the smile had left
Dizzy's face. Now his lips were tensed and his eyes worried. "And,
you identify Add&mdash;Miss Poulton as the girl you saw in Stanley
Griffiths house?" he swung to Murmer with the question.</p>

<p>Murmer nodded. "There's no doubt in my mind," he said.</p>

<p>"You'll swear to the resemblance?"</p>

<p>The Englishman smiled. He recognised the trick question.</p>

<p>"There is no resemblance," he asserted. "Miss Poulton is the
girl I saw in the Wonthaggi-Avenue house." There was no
indifference in Murmer's eyes now. His voice was crisp and
assertive. Yet, underlying look and voice was a thread of regrets
for the man before him.</p>

<p>Dizzy glanced at Inspector Pater.</p>

<p>The Australian detective nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll guarantee Saul Murmer's honesty," he said.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" The journalist paused suddenly. He was staring
thoughtfully at the floor. The room was silent, save for the loud
ticking of the nickel clock on the cabinet in the corner. The two
Inspectors watched him curiously.</p>

<p>"You can't get over my alibi." Dizzy spoke slowly, after a
lengthy pause. He turned to Murmer. "Inspector Pater assures me of
your honesty. He will tell you that my word is my bond. Again and
again, over several years, he has trusted me with information that
if I had used indiscreetly would have brought much trouble on him.
I've never betrayed him. At all times information I've come across
has been at the disposal of the authorities."</p>

<p>He paused to crush out his cigarettes on the ashtray on the desk
using rather unnecessary violence for the simple act. He groped in
his pocket and brought out pouch and papers, and deftly rolled a
new cigarette.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you the truth," he continued. "I took Miss Poulton
to the theatre last night. After the theatre we went to Dalmano's
for supper and stayed dancing until after half-past one in the
morning. From the doors of the restaurant we took a taxi to her
home. I left her at her door and drove in the same taxi back to
town, to my rooms. Not for five consecutive minutes was she out of
my sight between half-past seven that evening and two o'clock the
next morning.</p>

<p>"I was tired when I got back to town and didn't call in at the
office, as I usually do. Therefore I did not see the account of
Stanley Griffiths murder until it was published in the newspaper
just before lunch today&mdash;" He hesitated. "Peculiarly, I know
the taxi-driver well and can get hold of him within an hour. He'll
tell you&mdash;just what I've said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The murder was committed just before midnight," commented
Murmer.</p>

<p>"From eleven o'clock until after midnight Miss Poulton and I
were together. I'll say, from ten o'clock or a little after, when
the curtain went up for the final act until we finished supper
about midnight and took to dancing with friends who happened to be
in the restaurant, Miss Poulton was never out of my sight long
enough to get to the street and find a taxi. How then are you going
to account for her taking a twenty minutes' fast drive, kill a man,
interview you, and drive back to the restaurant?</p>

<p>"You're mad," the newspaper-man's voice strengthened.
"Absolutely mad. Before you can charge Miss Poulton you'll have to
send me on the road Stanley Griffiths has trod. I'm between her and
you. You can't get over my alibi&mdash;and only death will close my
mouth&mdash;" He stepped to the desk and caught at a scribbling
pad. "Here's a list of some of the people we were with at the
restaurant. Here's the name of the manager of the theatre who knows
Miss Poulton well and spoke to both of us when we were leaving the
theatre. Here's the name of the taxi-driver, and the name of his
company&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed shortly. "Try and break that alibi. You can't." A
silence fell on the room. In spite of the confident tones in which
he had spoken Dizzy Laine looked worried. Inspector Pater caught
the look, and wondered. The newspaper-man had put up a wonderful
alibi&mdash;if he had spoken the truth&mdash;but what would it
serve him to lie?</p>

<p>He turned and looked at the Englishman. A strange little smile
curved the man's full red lips. "You haven't told us the name of
the theatre you patronised, the numbers of your seats, and the
title of the play you saw," Murmer suggested.</p>

<p>With a half-laugh of mingled amusement and impatience the
journalist drew the pad to him again and scribbled the required
information. He tossed the pad to the stout detective.</p>

<p>"Will that satisfy you?" His tones showed that Dizzy was holding
himself in check. "You'll find the management can give you quite a
lot of information, Miss Poulton and I were there on newspaper
passes. The seat-attendant knows us both well."</p>

<p>"Yet I saw Miss Poulton in Stanley Griffiths house a few minutes
after midnight?" Inspector Murmer made the statement softly. "I
recognised her immediately she entered the restaurant today."</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, Saul," exclaimed Pater, now thoroughly
convinced that his comrade was mistaken. "No doubt you saw someone
very like Miss Poulton&mdash;possibly sufficiently alike to cause
you to make the mistake. You can't get over Dizzy's alibi. It's an
easy one to test, if you want to. I'm prepared to take his word.
You've made a mistake."</p>

<p>"Miss Poulton&mdash;or her twin sister," murmured the stout
man.</p>

<p>"Miss Poulton has not a&mdash;a twin," stated Dizzy. In a moment
the atmosphere in the room had changed. Dizzy was sitting well
forward on his chair, staring at the big man by the window with
wide eyes, a frown on his keen, ugly face. Very slowly he voiced
the suspicion that had grown in his mind.</p>

<p>"What do you know of Stanley Griffiths, Saul Murmer?"</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"What the hell are you driving at, Dizzy?" interposed Inspector
Pater.</p>

<p>"I've cleared Miss Poulton from suspicion." For a brief moment
the newspaper-man glanced at the Australian detective. "You'll
clear her, too, when you've investigated the notes I've given you.
I've answered quite a lot of questions from this man&mdash;now I'm
asking him a few." He turned again to face the Englishman. "You
still stick to your statement that you found Miss Poulton in
Stanley Griffiths house&mdash;and that in spite of the evidence
I've tendered. Well, I'm asking you again. What do you know of
Stanley Griffiths?"</p>

<p>For a few seconds, startled, Saul Murmer gazed into the keen,
light-lit eyes before him. He did not reply. Half-a-minute and
Dizzy Laine continued. "You, alone, found the house door open;
although the patrolman swears it was closed when he passed the
house thirty seconds before. You alone, entered, yet you state the
constable was within hearing of a shout. You, alone, found her
seated on the couch&mdash;if there, was a girl in that house. You,
unaided, released yourself from a locked room&mdash;"</p>

<p>The newspaper-man paused, apparently marshalling his facts in
his keen mind.</p>

<p>"&mdash;You, alone, formulated a theory, based on the presence
of a girl&mdash;a girl you failed to produce. To back your story,
you pick on a girl you meet in a city restaurant twelve hours, or
more, later. When that girl produces an unassailable alibi you
still stick, pig-headedly, to your statements. You haven't the wit
to get from under when your house of cards collapses about your
ears. Again I ask you, Saul Murmer: What do you know of Stanley
Griffiths? Think it over carefully, Inspector Murmer&mdash;and
remember you're not in London you're with Australians&mdash;people
who are entirely free, and unaccustomed to police bullying."</p>

<p>The newspaper-man turned and picked up his hat. "And, while
you're studying the changed conditions under which you're working,
remember, I'm taking cards in this game&mdash;and I'm not entirely
a fool, or helpless."</p>

<p>Dizzy Laine turned to face Inspector Pater. "No, John," he
continued. "I'm not going to the Commissioner. I'm not going to
anyone at police headquarters. The <i>Post-Advertiser</i> is taking
up the trail of Stanley Griffiths murderer, and I believe I have
enough influence to see that I'm assigned to the job.
Understand?"</p>

<p>In the doorway, he turned to face the men again. "The sort of
thing you're putting up now may go down in London, for all I know
or care, Inspector Murmer."</p>

<p>Dizzy's words were cold and steady. "In this country the police
take the trouble to catch the right person, man, woman or child. We
don't frame people&mdash;and we don't sit in easy chairs and
formulate theories that we know we can't put over with perjury or
trickery. Get me here, put out one word against Miss Poulton and
I'll drive you back to your mud-heap on the banks of the Thames
with your dirty, dingy tail well tucked between your legs."</p>

<p>With slow, deliberate movements he turned and opened the door.
In the passage, he closed the door carefully and silently.</p>

<p>Within the room, Inspector Murmer sat staring out of the window,
a slight flush on his full cheeks. Inspector Pater had slumped down
in his chair, his arms folded across his chest. For long minutes
not a word was uttered in the room, then the Australian turned to
his companion: "Saul, you ass. You've broken things, now!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">DIZZY LAINE left police headquarters with the
nearest approach to bad temper that had ever troubled his very
equable disposition. He was not worrying over Addie's alibi. That
was sound&mdash;absolutely unbreakable. His own record was clean
and he knew that his newspaper would back him to the limit. At the
restaurant the previous evening Addie and he had met quite a number
of reputable people who knew them well&mdash;people who would come
forward and swear that it was impossible for the girl to have been
at Edgecliff at the time Stanley Griffiths passed from life. The
English detective had worried him. The man was a mountain of
egotism and conceit, he told himself. He had possibly seen some
girl who bore some resemblance to Addie Poulton, and had taken the
opportunity to identify her in the first person he had chanced to
come across. That the person was Addie Poulton badly riled
Dizzy.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer had made a big mistake, and he had not been
quick-witted enough to retrieve his error. Again the newspaper-man
grinned. There would be wigs on the green if Murmer proceeded
further with his impossible theory.</p>

<p>He thought of the time, a couple of years previous, when the
<i>Post Advertiser</i> had taken the police department to task, in
no measured terms. The dispute had assumed large proportions. For a
period there had been open war between the editorial staff of the
newspaper and the police. In the end it had been the police who had
made the first advances towards a reconciliation. They could not
withstand the newspaper's continued attacks.</p>

<p>Dizzy Laine did not conceal from himself that in this case he
had a powerful opponent. Inspector Murmer had a big reputation in
England&mdash;a reputation for deductive reasoning that had
followed him to Australia. He recognised that the detective was a
man with a large and peculiar ability for concealing his
thoughts&mdash;a man who never lost his temper, proceeding calmly
and secretly on the course he had set for himself.</p>

<p>He doubted if Inspector Pater, working closely with the man,
knew his reasonings and deductions. The Englishman would only speak
when he had finalised his investigations and had completed his
case. Then&mdash;what case had he against Addie Poulton? He had
declared that he had seen the girl in Stanley Griffiths
house&mdash;and had continued to affirm that in the face of an
unbreakable alibi. Would he go further&mdash;attempt to break that
alibi; try to obtain further evidence of identification?</p>

<p>Dizzy Laine had been pacing Central Lane while he cogitated his
problems. Suddenly he threw up his head and squared his shoulders.
He had to make good his words to the English detective&mdash;that
he would get the "<i>Post-Advertiser</i>" to send him on the trail
of Stanley Griffiths murderer. Only with the full facts of the
crime in his possession&mdash;facts that he had to discover and
examine for himself could he meet and counter any moves to destroy
Addie's alibi that the man might make&mdash;if he still determined
to fasten the crime on the girl's shoulders.</p>

<p>He turned westwards and, in George-street, caught a northbound
tram, alighting at King-street. He walked up to Castlereagh-street
and turned into the <i>Post-Advertiser</i> buildings. On the
editorial floor he paused and asked the girl at the switch desk to
inquire if Lloyd Sampson, the managing-editor, would see him
immediately. Then he passed on to his desk. On it lay one of the
familiar buff-coloured envelopes used for containing office
messages. Tearing it open, he found within a message asking him to
go to the managing-editor directly he reported for duty.</p>

<p>A few steps brought him to the door of the managing-editor's
room. He knocked and opened the door. As he entered, a stout,
comfortable-looking man with an entirely bald head and ruddy,
cheerful countenance, looked up. He nodded and pointed with the
handle of his pen to a chair. "Thought you'd have been here
earlier, Dizzy." Lloyd Sampson spoke in deep, rumbling tones, a
note of impatience showing for the moment.</p>

<p>"Had a bit of business down town."</p>

<p>Dizzy seated himself and drew out pouch and papers. He rolled a
cigarette and leaned back, staring at Lloyd Sampson. "As it
concerned the Griffiths murder I thought I'd look into it at
once."</p>

<p>He found a match and struck a light.</p>

<p>"The Griffiths murder?" Lloyd Sampson lifted heavy brows.
"There's nothing in that. Cut and dried."</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it?"</p>

<p>"The English detective thinks to fasten the crime on a lady who
was enjoying an after-theatre supper with friends in the city."</p>

<p>"So? Who's the friends?"</p>

<p>"Paul Disraeli Laine&mdash;for one."</p>

<p>"Plural?"</p>

<p>"Dalmano's is rather a difficult restaurant to get a table in
after the theatre."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the lady?"</p>

<p>"Miss Adelaide Poulton."</p>

<p>"Umph!" Lloyd Sampson put down his pen and leaned back in his
chair. "What's the story, Dizzy?"</p>

<p>The newspaper-man related concisely the episodes relating to
Inspector Murmer finding Griffiths dead body and the girl in the
room; concluding with a vivid description of the late scene in the
Inspectors' room, at police headquarters.</p>

<p>"Good for the Englishman." A deep, rumbling noise showed that
the managing editor was amused. "Sticks to it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And Miss Poulton is a&mdash;a particular friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"Very particular."</p>

<p>Dizzy stared straight at his editor. "Anything of a story?"</p>

<p>"A big one, I think. The Skields brothers are mixed in it."</p>

<p>"Ernest Skields?"</p>

<p>"Arthur, principally. Ernest provides the alibi."</p>

<p>For long minutes the editor sat back, staring at the journalist.
A thoughtful look had come into the jet-black eyes, so strangely
out of place in the big, florid face. "If the Skields are in
it&mdash;" Lloyd Sampson spoke at length.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;I take the story?" For the first time Dizzy betrayed
eagerness.</p>

<p>"You know more about the Skields than anyone in this office,"
the managing-director acknowledged. "Ernest Skields, company
promoter, financier, man-about-town&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Arthur Skields, agent, apparently at desperate war with his
brother, yet relying on him and his friend for an alibi." Dizzy
laughed. "Rather farcical, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Two-handed poker?" The stern lips pursed.</p>

<p>"Three-perhaps four-handed. A man named George Martin was
there."</p>

<p>"George Martin. I don't know of him."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. Yet I'm guessing he's mixed up in the affair. I'm
going out after Martin."</p>

<p>For a long moment there was silence. Dizzy was leaning forward,
resting his arms on the desk-top. Suddenly he spoke:</p>

<p>"You know the Skields, sir? There isn't much they wouldn't put
their hands to&mdash;and I'm not excepting murder. Ernest Skields
is the head of the gang, and we've never probed the bottom yet. Oh,
I know you think I'm prejudiced, but I've got a lot of information,
though some of it's not yet provable. I've been watching the
Skields&mdash;and I've been beaten so far. There's a story with
them somewhere&mdash;a story that will set the city of Sydney by
the ears when it's told. The Skields are at the bottom of most of
the crook work in this city.</p>

<p>"I'm not talking of the crook work of Woolloomooloo,
Darlinghurst and Surry Hills, but of the crook work that takes
place in the swell offices in the heart of Sydney. For instance,
there was the Adlington Development Syndicate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A commercial matter," Lloyd Sampson interrupted. "It was proved
in the bankruptcy court that the syndicate would have made a
handsome profit if the Islington-Wagga railway had gone
through&mdash;"</p>

<p>'"And the powers that be decreed that the railway should pass
through Ashton and Wabberi."</p>

<p>"You think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Dizzy shrugged.</p>

<p>"I haven't evidence," he said, "but I've got something more than
a suspicion that Arthur Skields was mixed up in the Ashton
Improvements Company, which made quite a killing out of the
unexpected direction the railway took."</p>

<p>"And Ernest Skields was the moving spirit of the Adlington
crowd?" Lloyd Sampson nodded. "That would work."</p>

<p>"One angle of the cross," said Dizzy sombrely.</p>

<p>"Ernest Skields hinted that during the bankruptcy proceedings,"
the managing editor laughed. "He put up quite a squeal!"</p>

<p>"Yet, for a concern he founded and managed he had a surprisingly
small holding," Dizzy mused. "I think that is what put me on the
trail&mdash;if you can call it a trail."</p>

<p>"Then you've not dropped the matter?"</p>

<p>"I keep my eyes open."</p>

<p>"How do you link up Stanley Griffiths with the Skields?"</p>

<p>"Griffiths and Chalmers, stock-brokers."</p>

<p>Lloyd-Sampson sat back again. "If I remember rightly they had
only a small interest," he smiled wryly. "I may add, I had money in
the company. Skields sold me a block of shares."</p>

<p>"Whew!" Dizzy stared, open-eyed. "So you bit&mdash;and in spite
of what you knew?"</p>

<p>"Of what you had told me," corrected the managing-editor. "Lucky
for you, young man, you've no money. If you had I believe Ernest
Skields could sell stock to the devil!"</p>

<p>"He sold stock to a newspaper editor," commented Dizzy
dryly.</p>

<p>"Then he's progressing," Lloyd-Sampson grinned. "But a small
block of shares wouldn't bankrupt Chalmers and Griffiths!"</p>

<p>"By the shout Griffiths put up, you'd have thought it had."</p>

<p>Lloyd Sampson whistled gently.</p>

<p>"Griffiths and Ernest Skields had a hell of a row at the
Community Club," continued the journalist. "The matter was brought
up before the managing committee&mdash;and hushed up."</p>

<p>"You won't make that a motive for murder?" The managing-editor
was silent for some moments. "Well, I'll leave it to you, Dizzy.
Don't forget. You're a journalist, not a detective. I want a story:
front page, big streamers and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I, the return of Detective-Inspector Saul Murmer to the
backblocks of the Thames Embankment," completed Dizzy, with a broad
smile.</p>

<p>He went to the door, and, holding it partly open, turned to face
the man at the desk. Lloyd-Sampson looked up, speculatively.</p>

<p>"I may not get a story, sir." Dizzy spoke reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Then you get the sack." Lloyd-Sampson's tones were
uncompromising. "I can promise you that."</p>

<p>"A sop to the vanity of a fat English detective," commented
Dizzy, meditatively.</p>

<p>"A sacrifice on the altar of the god of failure&mdash;to get the
Skields Brothers just where you want them."</p>

<p>Dizzy nodded, and closed the door.</p>

<p>For a moment he stool against it, a wide smile on his lips, then
strolled across the big room to his desk. For some time he occupied
himself with the various drawers, destroying papers and
re-arranging others. He typed a short note and threw in the post
basket, then took his hat and strolled to the elevators.</p>

<p>On the pavement before the <i>Post-Advertiser</i> doors, he
paused again, then turned southwards. A sudden shout from a man
crossing the road startled him. He stopped and turned quickly. Then
the swung round again, still moving quickly. A brick from far up
the building before which he stood had smashed on the pavement at
his feet. He looked up. The building was old and undergoing
repairs. So far as he could see, there was no one on the staging
before the fifth storey. If that man across the street had not
called out! Another step forward&mdash;and that brick would have
struck him on the head. He turned sharply at the sounds of a voice
behind him.</p>

<p>"You had a lucky escape, young man!" A stout, lethargic-looking
man, with wide, blue eyes and full red lips, stood at the edge of
the pavement, grinning at him.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Inspector Murmer, I believe!" Dizzy tried to speak
nonchalantly. "Seems I've got to thank you for saving my life. But
for your sudden shout that brick would have scattered my
brains."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" For a moment the full, red lips parted, and the
small smile on the round face faded. "Mr. Dizzy Lane, a&mdash;a
journalist, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The emphasis on the word was unmistakable. Dizzy flushed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">BEFORE Dizzy Laine, for once at a loss for a
retort, could speak, the stout English detective had turned and was
ambling down the street. The newspaper-man looked after him, a
mixture of anger and perplexity showing on his face.</p>

<p>The man was an enigma. He had saved his life&mdash;there could
be no doubt of that. At the same time he had deliberately irritated
him&mdash;tried to insult him. A big question-mark formed against
the mental image of the Londoner in the newspaper-man's mind.</p>

<p>With a shrug Dizzy moved slowly along the street, automatically
turning in the opposite direction to that which the detective had
taken. He did not want to appear to be following the man, yet he
had a great curiosity regarding the Englishman. He
wondered&mdash;why was the man alone? He knew that Inspector John
Pater, as well as Inspector Saul Murmer, had been assigned to the
Griffiths case. Then where was Pater? The newspaper-man would have
liked to run into the Australian at that moment. A few discreet
questions might uncover quite a lot; and he badly wanted to know
what trail Inspector Murmer was following. Not that he was afraid
for Addie Poulton. She was safe, however far the Englishman's
obstinate adherence to his theory might take him.</p>

<p>Full of thought, he wandered along the crowded pavement, walking
southwards. He crossed King-street and made a way through the crowd
of men who appear to consider the space outside the big stores the
best spot in the city to stand for a gossip with friends. As he
stepped from the pavement to cross Market-street a firm hand caught
his arm, dragging him back to the pavement.</p>

<p>"News scarce, Dizzy?"</p>

<p>With a start the journalist looked up. "Hullo, John Pater!
What's the game?"</p>

<p>"Doing my good deed for the day, boy&mdash;saving the life of a
prominent journalist&mdash;or, perhaps news is scarce and he is
sacrificing himself on the altar of the newspaper-god."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;on second thought, one might just as well live,"
Dizzy grinned. "I was thinking of you."</p>

<p>"Is that cause for suicide? Or did you expect to find me under
the four wheels of a wool-wagon?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;The wool&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speaking disrespectfully of a member of the police force is a
criminal offence&mdash;or should be." Pater's grey eyes twinkled.
"Why the sudden agitation of grey matter?"</p>

<p>"Why is Inspector Pater allowing his little English lamb to
wander through the wilds of Sydney unattended? Have you never heard
of the wolves of Pitt-street?"</p>

<p>Dizzy was surprised at the sudden frown that darkened the
Inspector's face. For a moment he showed surprise; then
enlightenment came.</p>

<p>"So Inspector Murmer has decided not to remain in
leading-strings?" he continued, with a broad grin. "Kicked over the
traces?"</p>

<p>"Your metaphors are mixed, Dizzy." The smile returned to the
detective's eyes. "Lambs don't kick over traces. Inspector Murmer
had some important business to attend to personally."</p>

<p>"Personally?" The newspaper-man glanced around him. On the
opposite side of the road was a coffee-shop. He seized the
Inspector by the arm and steered him across the road, into the
shop.</p>

<p>"Who said I was thirsty?" laughed Pater.</p>

<p>"Loitering on the pavement is punishable by a fine of ten
pounds, under the new police regulations," announced Dizzy. "A new
regulation, issued solely for the benefit of the tea-shops monopoly
of the city of Sydney. Therefore, when a consultation is desirable,
even with a prominent member of the police force, a coffee shop, at
least, is indicated. You know, you can't break your immediate
superior's regulations, Pater."</p>

<p>"A consultation?"</p>

<p>"Business in which Inspector Murmer is alone interested
indicates consultation by his&mdash;friends."</p>

<p>"So!" Inspector Pater's eyebrows arched. "You did not seem very
friendly towards Inspector Murmer when you left police headquarters
a little over an hour ago."</p>

<p>"I may be clever at disguising my real feelings," mused Dizzy, a
far-away look in his eyes. "You forget, we are told to forgive our
enemies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Dizzy." Pater became suddenly serious. "I know
you're wild with Murmer, because he dared to cast suspicion on your
lady-friend&mdash; But, don't forget, he has a big reputation in
London."</p>

<p>"In breaking genuine alibis?"</p>

<p>"The better the alibi, the more suspicion should be cast on it."
Inspector Pater voiced the platitude gravely. "You know that,
Dizzy. You've fractured enough alibis in your time."</p>

<p>"You won't break Miss Poulton's alibi." Dizzy laughed. "Now what
I want to know is: What did you and Inspector Murmer quarrel
about?"</p>

<p>"Quarrel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quarrel."</p>

<p>Dizzy was not quite certain of his ground, yet he spoke firmly.
He noted the sudden light that came in the Inspector's eyes. "Look
here, Pater, honest, you don't believe Saul Murmer's theory?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer is working on definite facts."</p>

<p>"Theories that he can't prove and will eventually have to
abandon. I stand in his way; I and half a score other reputable
people. That's a fence even Inspector Murmer can't jump. I'm good
enough for him in the witness box and at the <i>Post-Advertiser</i>
office, and if he tries to prove that I'm not, he'll wade through a
sea of trouble."</p>

<p>"So, the <i>Post-Advertiser</i> is in this?"</p>

<p>"I'm not committing myself. Possibly so. I'm tipping you to keep
your lamb off the grass. There's quite a number of people in Sydney
alone who'd have been glad to take a shot at Griffiths&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For instance?"</p>

<p>Dizzy hesitated. He knew that Inspector Pater had certain
suspicions in his mind&mdash;suspicions that he would not yet
voice. He believed that the Inspector's suspicions coincided with
his own. But he knew that Inspector Pater was too alert to be led
into any verbal trap he might set for him. In the Inspectors' room
at police headquarters he had formed the opinion that the
Australian detective had a big doubt concerning the theory his
English confrère had erected. Since he had met John Pater that
doubt was evolving into a certainty.</p>

<p>"You've had Skields under examination," he said, quietly.
"Skields had a big reason to dislike Stanley Griffiths. They were
at daggers-drawn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Over what?"</p>

<p>"For one thing, the Islington-Wagga railway deal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Old stuff!"</p>

<p>"Maybe, old stuff. But the loss of a fat wad hurts&mdash;and
hurts that Pitt-street crowd far more than a blow. Don't forget
that. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>For a moment the journalist hesitated; then came to a quick
decision. "Look here, Pater," he said. "I don't know what you
think, but I do know that you and Murmer had words about his absurd
theory regarding Miss Poulton. He's off on his own&mdash;trying to
break the alibi I put up for her. I'm willing to bet you told him
he was mad&mdash;that I wouldn't be so confident unless I had the
facts to stand in support of my alibi. I'm guessing that then
Murmer went off on his own to get the evidence to prove he's right.
Well, I'm sorry for him, he's due for a rough awakening."</p>

<p>"Unless Inspector Murmer proves his theory is right."</p>

<p>"You don't believe that," Dizzy laughed. "Now, what line are you
following? I know you're not trailing after Murmer and his theory.
Are you on the trail of Arthur Skields?"</p>

<p>"The rule of the detective office is only to give newspaper men
proved facts," announced Inspector Pater sententiously.</p>

<p>"When they're too damned stale to be of any use!" Dizzy grinned.
"Can it! Now, if you'll talk sense I may be able to give you a
lead."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"You know something of the Islington-Wagga railway affair. Well,
Ernest Skields formed the Adlington Development Company, to rake
off a field of gold from the lands the railway would pass through.
He got quite a lot of moneyed men into it&mdash;and the damned
thing crashed. Arthur Skields formed the Ashton Improvements
Company&mdash;and made the pile his brother estimated to make.
There's people who say that Ernest, as well as Arthur, held a wad
in the Wabberi. If so, then the Skields Brothers made a killing,
while the fool public were watching the dud company. I'll tell you
more. Griffiths was well bitten in the affray. Ernest Skields let
him in on the ground floor of the Adlington Company&mdash;and
locked the door on him. In some manner Stanley Griffiths fund out
that he was one of the lambs, when he thought to be one of the
tigers. In consequence, one day there were high words at the
Community Club. If you want it in strict Australian there was a
hell of a row. Oh, you needn't look; I've got the straight goods. A
man tried to interfere between them, and got knocked silly. He told
me the tale. No; I didn't use it for the rag&mdash;wasn't worth a
cent for publicity unless I could link it with other things, so I
held it in reserve. Now, tell me. What interest had Arthur Skields
in Stanley Griffiths life?"</p>

<p>"Enough to shoot him?"</p>

<p>"Who can say?" Dizzy shrugged. "Just at present I'm
theorising&mdash;and I've got as much right to theorise as your
friend Murmer&mdash;that Stanley Griffiths found out how the joke
had been worked. I'd have given a week's pay envelope to have been
in the club and hear exactly what was said. Somehow, no one seems
to have heard the beginning of the dispute&mdash;before they got to
hard names. Sure they heard enough of those when the row got
definitely under weigh. Griffiths told Skields he was a thief and a
swindler&mdash;and that he'd have him in jail&mdash;Don't know how
you look at things, John, but I opinion that jail would just about
settle the Skields Brothers little games&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You've given something of a reason. But do you think it's a
reason strong enough for murder?"</p>

<p>"Depends on what Stan Griffiths had on the Skields Brothers, and
he can't talk now."</p>

<p>"Mr. Laine?" One of the waitresses stood by the table. "You're
wanted on the telephone, please."</p>

<p>"Me?" Dizzy looked up in surprise. "You're sure?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman phoned that he wanted to speak to Mr. Disraeli
Laine. The manageress took the message and said she didn't know
you. The gentleman described you and she told me to come and to see
if you were him," The girl finished confusedly.</p>

<p>"I'd have given something to have overheard that description,
Dizzy," Inspector Pater grinned. He looked at the waitress. "Did he
say the best looking fellow in the shop? If so, you're on the wrong
side of the table."</p>

<p>The girl laughed as she went up the shop to attend to a
customer.</p>

<p>Dizzy rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Damned strange," he muttered. "No one knows I'm here. I haven't
been in this place before, to my remembrance. I
wondered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The 'phone will tell you," to Inspector Pater reminded him.</p>

<p>He watched the newspaper-man stroll up the shop. As he came to
the counter two men brushed past him, to take seats at the table
behind John Pater. The Inspector hardly noticed them; he was
watching Dizzy. A moment at the telephone and the newspaper-man
came back to the his table, his brows creased in thought. He sat
down without speaking.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Some damned idiot!" Dizzy spoke angrily. "Got me to the 'phone
and there wasn't anyone there. What the&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lifted his coffee-cup to his lips and sipped, making a wry
face. "Damned stuff's cold!" He beckoned to one of the waitresses.
"Get me some more coffee, please, Miss White."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" Inspector Pater reached for the cup and saucer. For a
moment he examined it inquisitively, then turned to the girl, "Get
a fresh cup, please; I want this one."</p>

<p>The girl looked surprised and departed on her errand.</p>

<p>Dizzy stared at the Inspector.</p>

<p>"What's the joke?"</p>

<p>"You don't take sugar in coffee, Dizzy?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;what's this?"</p>

<p>The detective pointed to some white grains that sparkled on the
saucer.</p>

<p>"Sugar?" The newspaper-man stared inquisitively; yet his face
paled slightly.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater placed the cup and saucer on the table.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Don't touch it, man!"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;?" A look of suspicion came on the journalist's ugly
face. He glanced from the cup to the to Inspector.</p>

<p>"Now, don't accuse me." Inspector Pater grinned, as he
interpreted the glance. He stared about the shop, doubt in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course, I may be wrong, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"There's a crowd here. I was watching you go to the 'phone."
Inspector Pater spoke as if meditating aloud. "I don't like it,
Dizzy. I&mdash;" He stopped speaking abruptly as the girl returned
with the fresh cup of coffee. When she made to take the half-empty
cup, he placed an authoritative hand on it. "Leave that there,
miss. I want it."</p>

<p>When the girl retired, amazement showing on her face at the
actions of her two customers, the detective turned to his
companion. "Drink that coffee, Dizzy, I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>Hardly allowing the newspaper-man time to swallow the hot drink,
Inspector Pater led to the door, carrying the cup and saucer
carefully. A few words to the manageress, supported by the
production of his official card, and he left the shop, followed by
a much perplexed journalist.</p>

<p>A few doors from the coffee shop was a large chemist's shop.
Pater entered, followed by Dizzy, and placed the cup and saucer on
the counter. "What's in there, Mr. Sassoon?" he asked, nodding
recognition of the man who came to attend to him.</p>

<p>"Those white crystals in the saucer, first."</p>

<p>"The chemist dipped, his finger in the crystals and touched the
tip of his tongue. Then he lifted cup and sauce and carried them
behind a screen. Almost immediately he returned.</p>

<p>"Not much doubt, Inspector," he stated. "Of course, I shall have
to make a proper analysis before I can take oath on it, but if
you're in a hurry, I'll guess&mdash;arsenic."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;?" Dizzy Laine stared from the detective to the
chemist. "How&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You left your coffee and went to the telephone. I was watching
you, turning from the table to do so. Recognise anyone in the shop,
Dizzy?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul!" The newspaper-man spoke sincerely.</p>

<p>"Those two men who entered the shop as you went to the
telephone." Inspector Pater spoke meditatively. "Where did they
sit? Did you notice, Dizzy?"</p>

<p>"Behind you, I think&mdash;Yes, behind you." The journalist
appeared bewildered "But why should&mdash;I don't know them
from&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated and looked blankly at the Inspector. He did not
know the men who had entered the shop as he went to the 'phone. But
he had not known the man who had tossed the brick from the
scaffolding but half an hour before. Twice within an hour. A sudden
excitement lit his face as he turned to the detective again.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, man! We're on the right track! The Skields&mdash;or
someone wants to get rid of me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">A PENCILLED note on Dizzy Laine's desk when he
returned to the <i>Post-Advertiser</i> reporters' room that
afternoon informed him that the coroner's inquest on Stanley
Griffiths death would take place at the Wonthaggi-Avenue house the
next afternoon. This came from the chief sub-editor, who had
received the information from the day roundsman. Knowing that Dizzy
Laine had been assigned to the story, he had passed the information
on.</p>

<p>The information puzzled Dizzy. After leaving Inspector Pater,
who had taken the poisoned coffee-cup to headquarters, he had spent
some time wandering about the streets, pondering over his two
recent escapes from death. He had no reason to believe that the
brick had fallen from the Castlereagh-street building by accident.
Coupled with the incident of the coffee-cup, it was more than
probable that it had been deliberately a thrown down on him.</p>

<p>The two attempts to obliterate him from things mundane showed
that someone had learned that he had been assigned by his newspaper
to investigate the death of the stockbroker, Stanley Griffiths. But
who, of the people probably mixed up in the affair, could have
known that? His thoughts went to the English detective. At their
only meeting an antagonism had come between them. Dizzy put the
thought from him with a shrug. Inspector Murmer was a fine man with
a wonderful record at New Scotland Yard. He could have no interest
in Stanley Griffiths death, other than professional. The
antagonism, and Dizzy had to acknowledge there was one, was due
solely to differences of opinion regarding the identity of the
murderer. Inspector Murmer was unwilling to admit the alibi the
newspaper-man had given for the girl. Dizzy believed that when the
detective had made proper inquiries he would acknowledge that the
girl was innocent.</p>

<p>But, in that case came the question: who had twice within an
hour attempted to murder him? He tried to recall the faces of the
men who had pushed past him when he was on his way to the
telephone. He was certain he did not know them. So far as he could
remember, with the exception of Inspector Pater, there was no one
in the shop he recognised. Yet, the place was well-filled, nearly
all the tables having one or two occupants. Who had called him to
the telephone? It was that telephone call that had given the
would-be murderer his opportunity.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater had, naturally, been intrigued at the strange
call. The detective had acknowledged that he had turned from the
table to watch him go to the telephone. Then, someone, during those
few minutes had reached across the table and dropped the arsenic in
the coffee. But, who?</p>

<p>Dizzy shrugged the thoughts from him. Inspector Pater had taken
up the matter. He had the poisoned cup and saucer, and would have a
proper examination of the circumstances made. Possibly, in time, he
would get the names of all the people in the shop. That was quite
possible.</p>

<p>For himself, well, he had escaped unharmed. He believed in his
luck. Yet the affair was strange. Why was he to be got rid of? Was
it on account of the alibi he had established for the girl? No, not
that! There were a dozen people who could give similar evidence to
his. He turned his thoughts to the coming inquest. Here was further
cause for speculation. Why had the usual procedure been abandoned
in this case? It was not usual to hold inquests in private houses.
In the natural course of events the inquest would be held in the
Coroner's Court. Then, why the change? The only conclusion he could
arrive at was that for some unknown or unpublished reason, the
police officers in charge of the case required the inquest to be
held on the spot. What reason could they have for that?</p>

<p>Dizzy felt disinclined for work. Quickly writing up the latest
news regarding the Griffiths murder&mdash;information he had
managed to extract from the reluctant Inspector Pater&mdash;he
threw the copy in the news-editor's basket, and left the
building.</p>

<p>He had no engagements for that evening, and would have
cheerfully broken them if he had. He wanted to think and the best
place for concentrated thought was his silent rooms.</p>

<p>Like most journalists, Dizzy had formed the habit of having his
correspondence addressed to his newspaper office so his rooms were
bare. This evening, when he opened the outer door of his apartment
he saw a bulky envelope lying on the mat. He tore it open
carelessly&mdash;to stare at the contents in surprise. In his hand
he held a number of bank notes, of small denominations, topped with
a piece of writing paper cut to the size of a bank note. The whole
was secured by a rubber band. On the writing paper was typed a
single line:</p>

<p class="smcap">"To provide for the expenses of Mr. Dizzy Laine's
illness during the ensuing months."</p>

<p>There was no signature. Bewildered, the journalist examined the
notes. They were a mixed lot&mdash;one-pound notes and five-pound
notes well mixed together&mdash;and most of them well-handled. The
total value was one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>"Looks as if I'm going to have a serious illness," Dizzy laughed
as he muttered the words. "Now, who's my generous friend?"</p>

<p>He picked up the envelope he had allowed to drop to the floor.
There was no writing on it. The envelope was of cheap quality,
foolscap in size. The package had been delivered by hand. The
delivery would not be difficult. The building in which Dizzy had
his abode was open to the public during the daylight hours. Anyone
could walk into the building and climb the stairs, unnoticed. If
anyone had observed a stranger in the building they would not have
been inquisitive, believing him or her, to be a visitor to one of
the many apartments.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity for the newspaper-man to return the
notes to the sender, with his thanks and assurances that he would
continue in perfect health. Idly Dizzy searched for, and found, the
sufflator-set he had, in a moment of youthful enthusiasm engendered
by his first murder case, purchased.</p>

<p>He dusted the powder on the envelope. A few fingerprints showed
up. He shrugged. Most of them he believed to be his own. He made
imprints on the polished table-top, and examined them. With only
his naked eye it was impossible to discriminate between the
imprints. He put the envelope carefully aside. On the morrow he
would take it to the detective offices. Perhaps Ted Scott, the
fingerprints expert, could give him some information regarding the
envelope and the marks on it.</p>

<p>The next morning he took the envelope, carefully packed in a
cardboard box, to police headquarters. After half-an-hour's study,
the fingerprint expert picked out two marks that he declared
differed from Dizzy's fingerprints. Ted Scott stated that the
envelope had been carried by a woman who had worn gloves. The tip
of the third-finger of the left hand glove had been darned. He told
Dizzy that he was in luck. Had not the previous day been very warm
the prints would not have shown at all.</p>

<p>"People have the opinion that gloves are safe," lectured the
expert. "They're not. A good warm day, or plenty of emotion, in the
nerves of the wearer, and a glove leaks perspiration. It mayn't
show to the human eye, but there's moisture on the face of the
gloves. Now, if you want to go further in this inquiry, I'd advise
you to search for a strange woman in your building yesterday
between two and three. The weather records show that the heat wave
was at its height then."</p>

<p>Dizzy nodded his thanks. The clue was very slight. A woman in
the building between two and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Probably earlier or later, for the afternoon had been very hot. He
determined to make a few cautious inquiries yet might there not
have been half-a-dozen strange women in the building on perfectly
legitimate business?</p>

<p>A brief lunch at his favourite restaurant, and the newspaper-man
made his way to Edgecliff, for the inquest. The inquiry was to take
place in the dead man's study. When he arrived he found the
coroner, Mr. Alexander March, seated behind the big desk. A few
journalists occupied a side table. Two or three people Dizzy could
not place occupied seats against the far wall. The rest of the room
was devoted to police officers and the court officials.</p>

<p>Dizzy found a seat in a distant corner, from where he could see
the faces of the witnesses while they were under examination. He
nodded to Inspectors Pater and Murmer, and to several of the police
and court officers with whom he was acquainted, then leaned back in
his chair, content to watch proceedings.</p>

<p>A sudden rapping on the desk brought the room to attention.
Inspector Murmer, after a few words with John Pater, went to the
desk and sat down heavily in the witness chair.</p>

<p>Very carefully and exactly, the English detective described how
his attention had been drawn to the house. He told how he had
entered and had found the girl in the upstairs room. His face or
tones never varied in expression when he told how the girl had
lured him to the empty room and locked him in, although a titter of
laughter ran round the room.</p>

<p>"You would recognise the girl again, Inspector?" asked Coroner
March.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you any clue to her identity?"</p>

<p>"I have certain information, sir." Inspector Murmer spoke
slowly. "I do not think it is in the interests of justice to
mention what are only at present suspicions."</p>

<p>"Suspicions?" The coroner looked up sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Suspicions only." Inspector Murmer stared bleakly
across the desk. Dizzy flushed. Inspector Murmer had not yet
succeeded in destroying the alibi he had set up.</p>

<p>Without change of inflection, the Englishman went on to recount
how he had freed himself from the locked bedroom and found the
corpse under the couch. At the conclusion of his evidence Coroner
March dismissed him without examination. Dr. Angus was the next
witness. He described the dead man's wounds and estimated that he
had been dead about an hour when he saw him. Of the doctor the
coroner asked only one question. "In your belief, either of the
wounds&mdash;the dagger wound, or the bullet wound&mdash;would have
caused death?"</p>

<p>"The man was killed by a bullet piercing his heart." Dr. Angus
spoke emphatically. Dizzy waited impatiently for the next question,
but the coroner merely nodded dismissal of the witness The third
witness was a cousin of the deceased, Austin Griffiths, by name.
His evidence was only of identification. A short, thin,
nervous-looking man, with greying hair and sunken eyes. He stated
that Stanley Griffiths was without financial troubles. He had
really very little knowledge of his cousin. They had not met during
the past two years, due to a family dispute. He was the deceased
man's nearest relative. He did not know the contents of the dead
man's will, if there was one.</p>

<p>Much to Dizzy's surprise, Alice Warren, the maid from the next
door house was the next witness to take the chair. In the main her
evidence, extracted by questions from the police sergeant assisting
the coroner, was unimportant. She told a little of the life of the
Griffiths household, from the viewpoint of a next-door neighbour.
She was nervous and flurried. When the police sergeant sat down she
gave an audible sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Miss Warren." Coroner March looked up from the notes he had
been writing. "You have stated that Mrs. Gordon, the housekeeper to
the late Mr. Stanley Griffiths, and Miss Nellie Blythe, employed by
the deceased as general maid, are well known to you. Am I to take
it that you were in the habit of visiting them here?"</p>

<p>"No!" The girl spoke almost under her breath.</p>

<p>"You did not visit them here?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"How often have you been in this house?"</p>

<p>"Only once before today&mdash;when a constable asked me to come
here when the detectives wanted to speak to me&mdash;the day
that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The day that Mr. Stanley Griffiths was found dead,"
supplemented the Coroner.</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"You knew Mr. Stanley Griffiths?"</p>

<p>"I had spoken to him."</p>

<p>"Often?"</p>

<p>"Once or twice." The girl's reply was almost inaudible.</p>

<p>"You were on friendly terms with him?"</p>

<p>"No-no&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"What time did Mrs. Gordon and Miss Blythe come to work in the
mornings?"</p>

<p>"About six." The Coroner had to repeat the question before the
answer could be heard. "How many maids are there in the house where
you are employed?"</p>

<p>"Two!"</p>

<p>"Yourself, and&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Miss Amy James."</p>

<p>"What time does she get up in the mornings?"</p>

<p>"The same time as I do&mdash;or perhaps a little
later&mdash;She's a heavy sleeper."</p>

<p>"A bit later? I am going to suggest to you that she never rises
before seven o'clock."</p>

<p>Alice Warren did not answer.</p>

<p>"I am informed that you invariably get up early in the
morning&mdash;sometimes as early as five o'clock."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;can't sleep well&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;wake
early and&mdash;I won't be questioned like this&mdash;I
won't&mdash;I won't&mdash;" The girl's voice rose in rapid
crescendo to almost a shriek. She jumped to her feet and faced the
door&mdash;to look into the sleepy eyes of Inspector Murmer,
barring her path.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Miss Warren." The Coroner spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"I won't&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down." Coroner March's voice was low and firm.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" With a convulsive sob the girl collapsed into the
chair.</p>

<p>"Miss Warren?" The Coroner's voice became lower and graver. "I
am sorry to suggest that you have not told the truth. I am going to
give you the opportunity to correct your evidence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the hell!" A burly young man sprang to his feet from a
chair against the wall. "I don't know what you've got against
Alice, but I'm not going to sit here and see her bullied like that!
If you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" The Coroner looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"My name's Charlie Browne. I'm going to marry Alice and I'm not
going to have her told she's a liar, and that sort of thing. I
don't know much about law, but I do know you've got no business to
speak to her like that."</p>

<p>Inspector Pater went across the room and spoke a few words to
the young man, in an undertone. With an angry rumbling in his
throat, Charlie Browne subsided into his chair.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Warren." Coroner March's voice was cold and grave. "I
am going to ask you again: Were you often at this house? Shall I
suggest that you frequently visited here before Mrs. Gordon and her
helper arrived&mdash;between the hours of five and seven in the
morning?"</p>

<p>The girl stared blankly before her. She grasped the edge of the
desk, and strove to lift herself to her feet. Then her muscles
suddenly relaxed and she fell, a crumpled heap, to the floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">DIZZY LAINE watched the scene in the Coroner's
court with quickening pulse. Here was sensation&mdash;but sensation
cleverly covered and subdued by the authorities. He was beginning
to understand much that up to that time had been a mystery. He
believed that with this girl, Alice Warren, lay the clue to the
mystery. But the police were on the same trail.</p>

<p>Once, while the girl was in the witness chair, he had glanced at
Inspector Murmer. The Englishman was staring before him&mdash;at
the back of the girl's head. The bland, baby-like stare of the
innocent-looking blue eyes had disappeared. Now those eyes were
hard and keen&mdash;the typical eyes of the man-hunter.</p>

<p>For a moment, Dizzy forgot everything but those relentless eyes.
He gasped in astonishment. The man was clever. He had reversed the
usual practice. Men can assume a mask for a time, for a definite
purpose. Murmer carried his mask into his everyday life. Only at
odd moments, when the hunt was up and keen, did he allow it to slip
from him.</p>

<p>Alice Warren used to rise early in the morning, long before her
fellow-servant was astir, and secretly visit Stanley Griffiths in
his home! For what purpose? He shrugged away the natural idea that
sprang to his mind through his knowledge of the man's
character.</p>

<p>Alice Warren was not the secret mistress of the man. Of that he
was certain. Then, for what reason did she visit the house
secretly, at those early hours? Again his eyes sought the eyes of
the bulky detective. Murmer was staring thoughtfully at the little
group about the unconscious girl. The old, innocent mask had
slipped down again before those blue eyes. He appeared bored with
his surroundings.</p>

<p>From the detective, Dizzy glanced at the man seated against the
wall of the room, staring at the group about the girl with angry
eyes and flushed face. Charlie Browne was putting the common
reason&mdash;the reason that would be almost universal&mdash;on the
girl's actions. That was to be expected. The girl would suffer the
loss of her lover, as well as of her reputation, by the admission
wrung from her that afternoon. A look of pity came in the
journalist's eyes. He believed&mdash;no, he knew&mdash;that the
girl was innocent of sex wrong. But then, for what reason had she
made those secret visits?</p>

<p>Someone lifted the girl to her feet, and the little group about
the couch split to allow the girl to pass to the door with her
escort. Now Dizzy saw that the girl was supported by Mrs. Gordon,
Stanley Griffiths former housekeeper. As the two women passed to
the door they came close to where Charlie Browne sat by the wall.
He swung suddenly sideways, so that even their dresses should not
sweep his knees. He kept his eyes downcast. Alice Warren held back,
as if to speak to the man, but Mrs. Gordon urged her forward. At
the door, the girl paused again, glancing back. The man would not
meet her eyes, and she burst into loud sobs.</p>

<p>Still Dizzy waited. He was watching Charlie Browne. The man was
now staring straight before him&mdash;at the Coroner and the little
group of officials about the desk. The newspaper-man wondered what
he was waiting for: he believed that a conversation with the young
man would prove interesting.</p>

<p>Suddenly Inspector Pater turned from the group about the desk
and beckoned Charlie Browne to him. The young man rose sullenly,
thrust his hands deep in his trousers pockets, and lounged over to
the desk. Dizzy followed, unobtrusively. Coroner March, Inspector
Pater and Charlie Browne were talking in low tones. Lounging
carelessly, Dizzy drew nearer the group. He was almost within
hearing when a bulky form interposed between him and the men.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Dizzy Laine does work&mdash;occasionally?" The old note
of scarcely suppressed hostility that the newspaper-man had noticed
in Castlereagh-street the previous afternoon, still remained in the
smooth voice.</p>

<p>"Have to do something for a crust, Inspector." Dizzy's face
broadened to a wide grin. "All the cushy jobs have been snapped
up."</p>

<p>The Englishman spoke thoughtfully. "Oh, another of your strange
Australian expressions."</p>

<p>"Slang, I believe you term them in London&mdash;the home town."
The newspaper-man accepted the subtle challenge. "You know, we, of
Australia, have really no native slang. What we use is mainly
imported."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"Sure." Dizzy's grin broadened. "I read in an American magazine
the other day a glossary of Australian slang. Nearly every word in
the list came from the Barbary Coast or England. And what we
haven't borrowed from overseas was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was invented by a Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Dennis?"</p>

<p>"Adapted, inspector." The newspaper-man corrected. "We haven't a
Whitechapel&mdash;or even the beginnings of an east end&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've noticed that." A quick smile came on the full, red lips.
"Australians lack quite a lot of things."</p>

<p>"Except a sense of humour, Inspector. Regarding other things,
dear old home-town London does its best to import more than we can
possibly need. They're awfully good to us. Charitably they take our
wool and our wheat&mdash;at the prices they consider suitable for
us. They manufacture from our primary products and sell back to us,
at prices they think we should pay. Why, they even export to us
titled advisers who, in the 'best interests of a country so young'
as Australia, tell us that so long as we are content to be primary
producers they, the benevolent Englishmen will do the rest&mdash;at
a price. They even export to us their crooks, and their detectives
to catch them."</p>

<p>"You don't like the English, young man?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do!" Dizzy's voice suddenly became serious. "The English
are a great folk, but&mdash;you surely don't call the hotchpotch of
Eastern-European nationals settled on the banks of the Thames
English&mdash;That crowd of emigrants who flow in through the port
of London, to sweat and starve in the slums of Limehouse
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They become good Englishmen," Murmer challenged.</p>

<p>"Not on your life! They're the curse of England and the English.
They flood the labour markets and lower the price of labour; they
keep good Englishmen out of employment. They're not English,
although they learn to accumulate money through starving bodies.
English! Say, we had a Prime Minister once who tried to persuade us
that a Chinaman born in Australia was a good Australian. As a
nation we weren't old enough to absorb so subtle a fact. Why, even
a poor devil of a journalist beat him to it."</p>

<p>The newspaper-man paused.</p>

<p>"Ever heard the tale, Inspector?" The stout man shook his head.
"Here it is, then." Dizzy lounged sideways, trying to catch the
purports of the conference about the desk. "In his newspaper the
journalist told a little story, thus: one day a very fine Persian
cat walked into his rooms. It was a valuable and affectionate cat
and apparently without an owner, so he let it remain. In the course
of time, Nature called, and our journalist friend provided a
well-padded box for the maternity case. One morning he woke up to
the fact that his family had been increased by six&mdash;" Dizzy
paused, looking down innocently into the Englishman's face. "Say,
Inspector, what the devil was he to call them? Of course,
ordinarily, the offspring of a Persian cat would be called
'kittens'&mdash;but by the negligence of our journalist friend they
had been born in a kippered herring box so of course, they had
become&mdash;kippered herrings! Eh?"</p>

<p>"Then you consider the child of a German couple born on English
soil must still be German?" chuckled Murmer, his voice more
friendly.</p>

<p>"Sure. If that child isn't German&mdash;then our friend's
kittens are kippered herrings. Can't get over that, can you?"</p>

<p>With a short nod the journalist turned and lounged to the door.
Signs had tokened to his quick eyes that the conference about the
desk was breaking up. On the side-walk he turned to survey the face
of the house. A moment, and he knew that he had guessed right.</p>

<p>Charlie Browne came out of the front door and stood on the
porch-step, and Dizzy swore under his breath. Inspector Pater
followed him, showing signs that he intended to accompany the motor
mechanic from the house. Dizzy was wondering how he could dispose
of the Inspector and secure a few words with the young man; when
someone called the Inspector, from the interior of the house.
Inspector Pater turned back, and Charlie Browne came down to the
gate.</p>

<p>He passed Dizzy without a glance and went down the road. At the
next-door gate he paused, and turned. As his hand found the latch,
Dizzy clapped his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, Digger!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;Who the hell are you?" Charlie Browne swung round
quickly.</p>

<p>&gt;"Just Dizzy Laine, journalist. If you take a mate's advice,
you'll keep away from that house for a day or two."</p>

<p>"Go to hell!"</p>

<p>"If you go through that gate you'll be there, awaiting me."
Dizzy managed to get between the young man and the gate. "Now, look
here! Keep your hair on. You're not playing the police game, are
you?"</p>

<p>Charlie Browne hesitated. He stared intently at the newspaper
man.</p>

<p>"Say, what do you know?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll tell you, when you're open to reason." Dizzy's
grin was disarming.</p>

<p>"Look here; all that went on at that inquiry wasn't okay; get
me? You can't trust all you hear and see, in those kind of places.
There's quite a number of concealed strings being pulled&mdash;and
you re not the sort of fellow to dance to any police-tune. I'm used
to them and can pick out the meat from the nut; you can't. Ever
heard of 'things ain't what they seem?' Well, the fellow who wrote
that knew something. One never knows, y'know."</p>

<p>"You're Dizzy Laine." The motor mechanic pondered. "Seems I've
heard of you."</p>

<p>"Well known to the police!" Dizzy murmured pathetically.</p>

<p>Charlie Browne laughed. "What's the game?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just walking," answered Dizzy simply. He was keeping a wary eye
on the door of the house next door. He wanted a talk with this man,
Charlie Browne, but there was another man, still in Stanley
Griffiths house more important, at that moment. His present
difficulty lay in that he did not want to arouse Inspector Murmer's
suspicions, and have him warn either of the men not to talk to
him.</p>

<p>"Why walking?" asked Charlie Browne.</p>

<p>"Just a little stroll&mdash;on your own, Digger." The newspaper
man was persuasive. "Stroll on, mate, and don't worry about the
little girl in there. I'm guessing at present. I don't mind telling
you that. Look here, if you happen to be at the end of this road
this evening I may have something interesting tell you. I can't
promise, but it looks like it. That a bet?"</p>

<p>Dizzy won. A big, somewhat grimy hand shot out and met his in a
hard grip.</p>

<p>"It's a bet, son." Charlie Browne's face broke into smiles.
"But&mdash;her&mdash;knowing friend Griffiths was a bit of a shock,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Dizzy smiled sympathetically. "Well, take what I told you about
'things ain't what they seem' for a bit of a walk&mdash;and chew it
over. Now, shoot! Here's my man. S'long!"</p>

<p>With a final grip of hands the men parted. Browne strolled down
the road, his shoulders more square, his bearing more erect.</p>

<p>"Boy Scout Dizzy's good deed for the day!" The newspaper-man
muttered, almost ruefully. "Well, here's hoping I can keep it
up&mdash;" He sauntered back to the Griffiths gate, to almost
collide with a solidly-built man coming out.</p>

<p>"Constable Jack Preston, I presume?" Dizzy tilted his hat in his
best Stanley manner. "Thought I saw you at the inquiry."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;Mr. Dizzy Laine, of the <i>Post-Advertiser</i>."
Constable Preston held out a large-sized hand. He was ambitious,
and knew the power of the Press on a police-officer's advancement.
He had only met Dizzy once, and at that time only to answer a
couple of questions, amplifying evidence he had just given in a
minor court.</p>

<p>"Confession for the second time within an hour&mdash;well-known
to the police!" Dizzy grinned. "Interested in the Griffiths murder,
constable?"</p>

<p>"I found him." Preston swelled out his broad chest importantly.
"Well&mdash;not to say exactly, I found him&mdash;but I was with
Inspector Murmer, almost, when he found him."</p>

<p>"Bit of luck&mdash;that!" Dizzy stared at the imposing form of
the patrolman, allowing admiration to shine in his eyes. "They
didn't call you in evidence?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer thought&mdash;" commenced the constable,
slightly defeated.</p>

<p>"Giving too much away to the public, eh? Besides, might lessen
the importance of his own evidence. I get you!"</p>

<p>The admiration had extended from Dizzy's eyes to his tones.
"Suppose you'll have quite an earful for the judge, when you catch
him?"</p>

<p>"Her," corrected Preston.</p>

<p>"Her?" Dizzy's heart beat angrily. With an effort he kept all
signs of resentment from his voice. "Oh, the girl next door. Nice
looking bit, too. Didn't look to me like a murderess, though."</p>

<p>"No, that ain't her." Preston frowned majestically. "Another
girl. We'll catch her. What with me and Inspector Murmer and what
we knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Dizzy's ejaculation was fervent. "Lucky you were
about."</p>

<p>"I was on the beat."</p>

<p>They were now almost out of be sight of the house. Dizzy
breathed more freely. If he could steer this gump round the next
corner he would have him safe from interruptions.</p>

<p>"This beat?" Dizzy expressed remarked surprise. "Rather a slow
beat for a man like you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Just temp'rary, Mr. Laine; just temp'rary." Preston was
beginning to believe in himself. "We, of the police, have to take
in all h'aspects of the service."</p>

<p>"Sure!" Dizzy played up. "Suppose things do happen, even on a
lonely beat like this, at nights?"</p>

<p>"Never nothing much." The constable spoke gloomily. "Now, that
murder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose nothing else happened that night," suggested the
newspaper-man. "Can't expect more than one thing at a time."</p>

<p>"Only a couple of drunks," replied Preston. "As it 'appens, I
found 'em also in Wonthaggi-Avenue, an' 'ad to give 'em a word to
shut up. Told 'em to move on and make less noise, or I'd run 'em
in&mdash;Just a word of warning like&mdash;Can't 'ave folk
disturbed when they've gone to bed."</p>

<p>"Of course. Drunks, like the poor, we have with us always.
They're a nuisance on the beat, aren't they? Can't hold their
liquor. By Jove, is that an hotel? Wonderful! Now, a man like you,
constable&mdash;"</p>

<p>Very cleverly Dizzy urged his prey into the empty bar-parlour
and set an enticing, foaming pewter-pot before him. Constable
Preston loosened his belt and took a deep draught.</p>

<p>"Here's luck, sir."</p>

<p>"You've got it." The admiration in Dizzy's voice tickled the
constable gently. "This case'll make you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hope so, sir. Well&mdash;I could do with another. Thank you,
sir."</p>

<p>"Here's luck!"</p>

<p>"Same to you, sir&mdash;many of 'em!"</p>

<p>"Let me see," Dizzy mused. "What time was it you said you met
those drunks?"</p>

<p>Constable Preston thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"Funny that," he observed thoughtfully. "You've just reminded
me, Mr. Laine. Just as it 'appens I met 'em as I was turning into
Wonthaggi-Avenue. I stood a moment watching 'em as they went up th'
road an' turned outer sight."</p>

<p>"Then you went down Wonthaggi-Avenue, and met Inspector Murmer,"
suggested Dizzy.</p>

<p>"As you says, sir." Constable Preston buried his nose in a new
brimming pot. Dizzy noticed that his eyes were glazing and his
speech thickened. "As you says, sir. Yes, it's a thirsty day. Thank
you, sir, I will 'ave another. Yes, I watched those drunks outer
th' street and then went down an' met Inspector Murmer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" breathed Dizzy Laine, crime investigator for the
<i>Post-Advertiser</i>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">"AH!" Dizzy Laine repeated.</p>

<p>Constable Preston sat at the table in the bar-parlour, staring
vacantly at the newspaper-man pacing the small room deep in
thought. His eyes wandered to the table&mdash;to the fine pot of
nut-brown ale slowly losing its beautiful head of foam. It was
Dizzy's drink, and the thought crossed the constable's mind that
the newspaper-man had not too fine an appreciation of the good
things of this life. In a few seconds the fire and sparkle of the
beer would be lost. The patrolman sighed. His eyes wandered to the
empty pot before him. Through the fine film at the bottom the
pewter sparkled. Again he sighed and looked towards the journalist.
Almost, without thought his hands changed the relative positions of
the two pewters. With another sigh&mdash;of relief and
enjoyment&mdash;the constable buried his nose in a new drink.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Dizzy, for the third time. He glanced at his
companion and turned to the bar.</p>

<p>"Have another, Preston?"</p>

<p>The constable sighed. "'Oped you'd shay that, shur." The brisk
speech had become slurred. "A&mdash;a 'ot
day&mdash;shurtingerly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So two men were in Wonthaggi Avenue a few minutes before you
met Inspector Murmer?" suggested the journalist.</p>

<p>"S'chorse! I&mdash;I shaw 'em&mdash;tol' 'em t' get&mdash;get
me? Or I'd runnem in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two men?" Dizzy stared thoughtfully at the constable. "And they
were coming from the direction of Mr. Griffiths house?"</p>

<p>"Shurtingerly&mdash;I's tol' em&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't recognise them?"</p>

<p>"Shurtingerly no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What a pity! If you had stopped them&mdash;if you knew them,
you might be wearing Sergeant's stripes tomorrow," suggested
Dizzy.</p>

<p>"For run-n-ning in two drunks?" Constable Preston cocked a much
weathered eye.</p>

<p>"For beating Inspector Murmer to the murderer of Stanley
Griffiths," corrected the newspaper-man, slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p>"Shen I&mdash;ic&mdash;runnem in," The constable announced
gravely.</p>

<p>He swallowed the remaining contents of Dizzy's third pot of beer
and rose, majestically, to his feet. He turned to face the door.
"I&mdash;runnem in."</p>

<p>"You don't know them." jeered Dizzy.</p>

<p>"Sheen 'em befur&mdash;Livsh round 'ere shumwher'."</p>

<p>Dizzy pondered. He had urged the constable to drink, believing
that the liquor would unloosen his tongue. Now he was afraid he had
overdone matters the man was too drunk to think and speak
intelligently.</p>

<p>"So they live round this way," he said, after a long pause.
"Shouldn't be difficult to find them, then?"</p>

<p>"Shurtingenly nosh." Constable Preston stood in the doorway,
staring into the street, wavering with drunken gravity.
"Sh'lon&mdash;Diz-zy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" The newspaper-man caught hold of the
constable's arm.</p>

<p>"Shurrest 'em 'scourse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Beein' shrunk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They'll be sober now;" warned Dizzy. "You'll fall in, if you
don't look out."</p>

<p>"Don' share&mdash;" The constable lurched forward. "Shurres 'em
asshultin' Shinpector Murmers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, go to hell!" Dizzy was exasperated. His plans had badly
miscarried.</p>

<p>He had thought the man to be more drink proof, and had too
quickly made him drunk to talk intelligently. He cursed himself for
a fool. What was he to do now? He could not let the man go out on
the streets in that condition. He was in uniform, and aggressive.
He would get himself locked up, and dismissed from the force in
disgrace.</p>

<p>"You've got to have evidence, constable, before you can act."
The newspaper-man tried persuasion. "You've&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Splenshy shevidensh&mdash;Splenshy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where's your report?" Dizzy jumped at the bright idea that had
flashed through his mind. "What's the use of making an arrest
before you have put in your report? Why, your sergeant will kick up
hell if you go against the regulations that way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sgotter resporsh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's just what you haven't got. You've got to write out that
report first." Dizzy laboured the question. "Get matters straight,
man. You know it's an intricate case and you have to have it all
clear and written down on paper. Of course you understand it, but
they won't at the station-house. You've got to write out all your
evidence clearly before you arrest those men, and charge them."</p>

<p>"In schorse! Writter reporsh&mdash;Cummon!"</p>

<p>Drunkenly, he seized Dizzy's arm and dragged him towards a door
on the opposite side of the room. With a shrug, the newspaper-man
relaxed. The door opened to show a small parlour, furnished with a
few chairs, an old-fashioned sofa and a centre table. On the walls
were lithographs and glass advertisements extolling the virtues of
various drinks. Dragging a chair to the table the constable slumped
into it and looked at the gaudy covering; puzzled.</p>

<p>"Wanna paper&mdash;Wanna pensh&mdash;Wanna shink&mdash;"</p>

<p>In answer to Dizzy's call, the barmaid came to the room, a frown
on her face. The newspaper-man interposed quickly.</p>

<p>"Leave him alone, miss. Can I have a writing-pad, and pen and
ink?" He lowered his voice and nodded his head towards the
constable. "He thinks he has to write a report. That'll quiet him,
and then we can get him home. We don't want to get his coat taken
from him, do we?"</p>

<p>The girl smiled. Dizzy's cheerful good-humour always reacted
pleasantly on the female of the species. She nodded, and left the
room; to return in a few minutes with the writing materials.</p>

<p>"You'll look after him, won't you," she said to Dizzy; then
frowned at the constable. "I'm ashamed of you, Preston. Getting
drunk and behaving like this!"</p>

<p>The man was too much engrossed with the writing pad to take any
notice of the girl's remark. He was mumbling to himself, squaring
his elbows to the task of writing, and frowning thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Dizzy stared, wonder dawning in his mind. A few minutes before
the constable had been too drunk to write. Now, while still drunk,
he was going about the job in workmanlike fashion. What had
happened to the man? Dizzy tip-toed across the room and peered over
the man's shoulder. Across the top of the page, in big,
school-boyish letters was the word: "Report."</p>

<p>But the man's head was nodding, bending slowly towards the
table. The momentarily flickering hope that had dawned in the
newspaper-man's mind faded. Had the man been about to write some
report? On what subject?</p>

<p>The man's head dipped lower. Now his nose was almost on the
paper, yet his fingers held the pen firmly. He made a motion
forward with his right hand, as if dipping pen in ink-well.</p>

<p>Perplexedly, Dizzy paced the room, occasionally glancing at the
somnolent man. But, he was not sleeping. No drunken man, in that
position, could sleep without snoring&mdash;and Constable Preston
was entirely quiet.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" In sudden frenzy of anger Dizzy turned on the man.
"Write, damn you, write."</p>

<p>For the moment the nodding head came up with a jerk; then fell
again to the paper.</p>

<p>Write. Write! The word buzzed through Dizzy's brain. Could the
man write&mdash;and write sense? If he could write, what would he
record on the paper?</p>

<p>He had wanted to write a report; a report on the two men he had
seen turning out of Wonthaggi-Avenue a few minutes before he had
walked down the road, to pass Stanley Griffiths' house and meet
Inspector Murmer. What of those two men?</p>

<p>Constable Preston had said that he knew the men; that they lived
in the neighbourhood. What did he know of them? In his drunken
speech he had boasted that he could arrest them. What would they
know? What had they seen when they had come up Wonthaggi-Avenue, at
the very moment some person had fired a bullet into Stanley
Griffiths back? Again he turned, in an agony of impatience, to the
man at the table.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, write. Write! Write! Damn you, write!"</p>

<p>Constable Preston raised his head, staring at Dizzy vacantly. He
lifted his hand and dabbed forward towards the ink-well.</p>

<p>"Gotta wrish reporsh! Arresh sho mensh. Drunsh an' dish'orly.
Asshalt-t-erin' Inshpector Murmush&mdash;Murdersh
Griff&mdash;f-f&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God, if that could be true! Impatiently the newspaper-man bent
over the constable.</p>

<p>"Preston! Jack Preston! Write! Write! You have to put in your
report and have those two men arrested. Write, man; write!"</p>

<p>The constable's head raised with a jerk. Slowly and with
difficulty the big shoulders balanced. The neck stiffened and,
waveringly, the man's hand moved forward, dipping the pen heavily
in the ink-well.</p>

<p>"Gotta wrish&mdash;reporsh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God! If he would only write&mdash;sense!"</p>

<p>The constable's hand wavered, then came to the paper. The pen
lowered and a word formed on the whiteness. Dizzy stepped back from
the table, staring at the man. He was writing&mdash;but would those
words form sense? He hardly dared look.</p>

<p>Almost on tip-toe he crossed the room and dropped into one of
the broken-springed easy chairs, staring all the while at the
constable. What had happened to the man? He was writing; slowly at
first and then more fluently. Even at the distance the
newspaper-man could see that letters were forming slowly and
regularly. Yet Constable Preston was not looking down at the pad
over which his hand was passing. He was staring straight before him
at some point on the floor, on the opposite side of the table. His
face never moved; his eyes were fixed, unseeing. The man was
unconscious. No, not quite that. For the moment his sub-conscious
mind dominated his conscious mind, dulled by the fumes of the beer.
He was writing&mdash;writing&mdash;</p>

<p>Something was growing in Dizzy's mind. He remembered reading of
a man who rose from his bed in sleep and set down on paper the
secret thoughts of his mind-matters that he had no knowledge of
during his waking hours. He had read of men who had accomplished
incredible things while asleep. But could a drunken man perform
anything of value? There he had to doubt! Now Constable Preston was
writing quickly. Dizzy leaned back in his chair and watched. Would
those words be of value to help to elucidate the mystery
surrounding Stanley Griffiths death? Constable Preston had been in
the avenue at the time the shot was fired. He had seen two men
coming from the direction of the house. Had either, or both, of
these men anything to do with the murder?</p>

<p>The rip of a sheet torn from a pad brought him alert for the
moment. He sat back in the chair again when he saw that the
constable had started to write a second sheet. There was time to
read when the man finished. Then he would know if some mysterious
power, guiding humans but beyond their knowledge, had intervened to
place him on the trail of the man who had shot Stanley
Griffiths.</p>

<p>Body inflexible, head set square on the shoulders, eyes staring
across the table into vacancy, Constable Preston continued to
write. Dizzy held himself in check. He must wait, wait, he told
himself. One unguarded movement and he might break the spell on the
man at the table and the secret he longed for&mdash;the secret he
could not even guess at&mdash;would be lost.</p>

<p>Sheet after sheet, scrawled over in the loose boyish handwriting
was torn from the pad and placed aside. At length, the man's body
stiffened. The hand widened its curves in a large-sized flourish.
For a moment the stiffly poised body remained upright, then
slumped. Again the loosely held head lolled forward on the table
until the forehead and nose blurred on the still wet ink.</p>

<p>Moving cautiously, Dizzy went to the table and picked up the
sheets of paper. He sorted them into order; then lifted the man
bodily back and drew from under him the writing-pad. Tearing off
the last page of writing he placed it with the other sheets of
paper and returned to his arm-chair. His breath caught in a sharp
gasp as he read the first words under the official heading:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Report of Constable John Preston, No. 4973P,
attached to Edgecliff Division, New South Wales Police."</p>

<p>The words were terse and made sense. The style of expression was
untutored, but the descriptions were vivid and minute. The report
started with the beginning of Constable Preston's patrol that
night. Rapidly Dizzy skimmed the first sheets, gathering in the
sense of the report without too careful reading of the words. He
was not interested in the minutiae of the routine. He wanted to get
to the point where the constable was approaching Wonthaggi Avenue,
from Pantheon-street. Ah!&mdash;</p>

<p>There had been a noisy party at a house in Pantheon-street.
Constable Preston had halted against the railings, listening. He
had thought to go to the door and warn the occupier that his guests
were making too much noise. He had looked at his watch and
reconsidered. It was barely midnight. He had decided that if they
were still noisy when he came that way again, he would have a word
to say to them. Then a taxi had come up Wonthaggi-avenue, from
Edgecliff road, to a house almost at the corner of Pantheon-street.
A man and a girl had alighted. The taxi had waited, the engine
running, while the couple took a long farewell in the shadows of
the doorway. Preston had seen the man return to the taxi and drive
away.</p>

<p>It was after the taxi had driven off that Constable Preston had
heard singing in Wonthaggi-avenue. The constable had been puzzled
for the men were close to the head of the avenue. He should have
heard them first far in the distance. Constable Preston had
quickened his pace. The men were on the opposite side of the
avenue. There were two of them, and they appeared to be very drunk.
They were in evening clothes, with white mufflers and black
overcoats. Preston had crossed the road and warned them to make
less noise. One of them had drawn himself up in military mock
salute. Both of them were of good class and had evidently been
enjoying a night out. A half-note had passed from fumbling fingers
to a broad, firm palm. Then Constable Preston had passed on, down
Wonthaggi-avenue.</p>

<p>Dizzy let the report fall to his knees and lay back considering
it. Two points stood out in the lengthy report. First, Preston had
not heard a sound, except the throbbing of the taxi in Pantheon
street, until the burst of song just round the corner in
Wonthaggi-avenue. The second point&mdash;one most interesting to
the newspaper-man&mdash;was that this was the first mention of any
persons, other than Constable Preston and Inspector Murmer in
Wonthaggi-avenue. Had not Inspector Murmer heard the singing men?
If so why had he not mentioned it to Inspector Pater, or in
evidence at the coroner's inquest?</p>

<p>The next paragraphs of the report related to the meeting of
Inspector Murmer and Constable Preston. The record was almost
exactly word for word the account Inspector Pater had given him of
Saul Murmer's movements. Then Inspector Murmer had not been in
Wonthaggi-avenue until he walked up it from Edgecliff-road and
found the Griffiths house door open.</p>

<p>Constable Preston's report definitely stated that the avenue had
been empty when he left the drunks and walked down it. He had seen
Inspector Murmer turn into the avenue and walk up to meet him.
Again Dizzy let the report drop to his knees, and lay back lost in
thought. If only Preston had taken a description of the two men.
Who were they? So far, he had only Constable Preston's statement
that one of them appeared familiar. They had been in
Wonthaggi-avenue at the time Griffiths was shot by a revolver not
carrying a silencer. They must have heard the shot,
unless&mdash;</p>

<p>The constable's report was of extreme value. It showed that two
men had been in Wonthaggi-avenue at the time of the murder.
Constable Preston had been around the corner, in Pantheon-street.
The men the constable had met had come up the avenue in silence
until almost at the junction of the two streets. Then they had
burst into loud song. Why? Had they heard the engine of the waiting
taxi-car and then assumed an appearance of drunkenness? In that
case, those men had something to conceal. Again, in his report
Preston stated that he had been examining the doors and windows of
the darkened houses by the light of his torch. Had the torch-light
reflected from some window around the junction of the streets,
warning the men that a police-officer was close at hand?</p>

<p>Take the suppositions which way he would, Dizzy came a to the
conclusion that the men were not drunk; that they had assumed the
appearance of drunks to deceive anyone who saw them in the
avenue.</p>

<p>Dizzy lifted the sheets of the report, and read on. He might as
well go to the end. There might be something of value yet to be
discovered. Meticulously the writings recorded Preston turning and
looking back immediately he had passed, recognising Inspector
Murmer. Then followed detailed records of movements on the patrol.
He had arrived at his point and was standing in the shadows
awaiting his sergeant when the taxi-driver came up and took him
back to Wonthaggi-avenue.</p>

<p>Much of the later parts of the report had been recorded in the
newspapers, and spoken at the inquest that day. The proceedings in
the Griffiths house had been recorded, as Constable Preston had
witnessed them.</p>

<p>Dizzy came to the end of a page, and found only one sheet
remaining. It was filled with writings. A slight curiosity came
over the journalist as he lifted it. Logically, the report ended on
the previous page. What further had the constable to record? His
heart thumped with excitement as he read the first words on the
last sheet. Constable Preston's sub-conscious mind had turned back
to the two men he had met at the head of Wonthaggi-avenue. The
men's individualities had impressed on the constable's
sub-conscious mind. Perhaps it had stirred to the surface at
Dizzy's keen questioning; perhaps the reflex of the desire, while
drunk, to find and arrest him.</p>

<p>On that last page Constable Preston had set down, with
meticulous care, detailed descriptions of both men. Peculiarly
distinctive was the description of the man who had made the mock
military salute. Thrice Dizzy read the descriptions. He knew the
man who had saluted. He knew his companion. The details were too
numerous for him to be mistaken. Every detail of the man, his dress
and appearance, even the inflections of his voice stood out from
the page.</p>

<p>"Sub-conscious memory! God!" Dizzy stared at the man lolling
across the table, in amazement.</p>

<p>"God!" he whispered again. "If you're right, man&mdash;if you're
right&mdash;drunk or sober, you'll wear those sergeant's
stripes!"</p>

<p>Almost dazed with the wave of emotion that swept him, Dizzy went
to the door and called the barmaid. When she entered, she glanced
at the man at the table, and her lips curved disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Drunken brute! So he's gone to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Know him?" asked Dizzy, suppressing his voice to
casualness.</p>

<p>"Constable Preston, of course," the girl laughed. "'Tisn't often
he gets on the drink trail."</p>

<p>"Got a barman here, miss?"</p>

<p>"There's George."</p>

<p>"George will be just great," Dizzy stated. "May I have the loan
of him?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I think Constable Preston will be more comfortable on the
couch."</p>

<p>"You don't want George for that." The girl went to the
constable's side. "Come on! You and I can manage him." Dizzy was
too wise to raise objections. Between them they half-dragged the
sleeping man to the couch and made him comfortable. The man
grumbled an unintelligible remonstrance at being disturbed, then
relapsed into snoring slumber.</p>

<p>"In about a couple of hours, sister, he'll wake up," said Dizzy,
looking down on the constable. He took some silver from his pocket.
"When he wakes, I'll be glad if you'll get George to help him into
a taxi and send him home. He'll have time for a good sleep before
he's due for duty again."</p>

<p>"Sure thing!" The girl looked curiously at Dizzy. "Say, who are
you&mdash;and what's he to you?"</p>

<p>"I'm a newspaper-man," the <i>Post-Advertiser</i> crime expert
smiled shortly. "As for him; well, I asked him to have a drink, not
knowing that he couldn't carry his liquor. So&mdash;" he smiled
disarmingly down at the girl, "&mdash;so you see, it's up to me to
save him his jacket."</p>

<p>The girl nodded understandingly. "You're a good sort!" She
picked up the money from the table. "I'll look after him. As you
say, we've got to save his jacket."</p>

<p>Collecting the sheets of paper inscribed with the sub-conscious
report of Constable Preston, Dizzy thrust them in his pocket. In
the street he walked some distance, deep in thought. Then he
stopped and thrust his hand in his pocket, pulling out the report.
Again he read the last sheet in which was written the descriptions
of the two drunken men. Drunken men! He came to the last line above
the sprawled signature, and whistled softly.</p>

<p>He knew one of those "drunks." He believed he would recognise
the other. That man had two small moles and a scar on his
face&mdash;marks that made him distinctive. The man he knew was
Ernest Skields. There could be no doubt. Ernest Skields had been in
Wonthaggi-avenue at the time Stanley Griffiths was shot. And Arthur
Skields, one of the suspects of the crime, had given Ernest
Skields, his brother, as witness to his alibi. He had said that he,
Ernest Skields, and a friend, had played poker until three o'clock
in the morning. Who had been the man with Ernest Skields, in
Wonthaggi-avenue?</p>

<p>Dizzy was certain that this second man was the third man of the
supposed poker-party. What was his name? The journalist thought for
a moment. Ah, Martin&mdash;George Martin! Arthur Skields had given
an alibi that depended on his brother and Martin for its
support.</p>

<p>But Ernest Skields and Martin had be been in Wonthaggi-avenue at
the time Stanley Griffiths was murdered. Had Arthur Skields been
there also? That was possible. But Arthur Skields, had not fired
the bullet into Stanley Griffiths back. Inspector Murmer had taken
his finger-prints, and on that evidence had ruled him out of the
case. Had he?</p>

<p>Was not Arthur Skields still subject to suspicion? Was it not
possible that the two Skields and Martin had been in
Wonthaggi-avenue at the time Stanley Griffiths was murdered? Was it
not natural to assume that the loud burst of song that had saluted
Constable Preston's turning the corner from Pantheon-street had
been a warning signal? That would coincide with the differences
between Inspector Murmer and Constable Preston. The constable had
sworn that Griffiths door was closed when he passed. Inspector
Murmer swore that it was open thirty seconds later, when he came to
the house. In that thirty seconds had not Arthur Skields escaped
from the house, to hide beside one of the side walls until the path
to the street was clear for his escape?</p>

<p>A broad smile lit Dizzy's good-humoured, ugly face. Now he had
in his hands threads of the mystery he had sought. With them he
could pursue a straight course to the solution. He had to discover
who had shot Stanley Griffiths. He had reduced the suspects to
three men. Which of the three?&mdash;Arthur Skields, Ernest Skields
or George Martin?</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Inspector Pater had left Charlie Browne on
the porch steps of Stanley Griffiths house he had done so at the
imperative call of Coroner March. The Inspector had sworn under his
breath at the summons. He did not want to leave the motor-mechanic
at the moment. He had the impression that between that man and
Alice Warren he could get information of value to the inquiry. Yet
he could not disregard the Coroner. He turned back into the house
with a smile on his lips.</p>

<p>"Went off very well, Inspector?" Coroner March held out a short,
fat, white hand. "I hope you understand that on this occasion I
have stretched a big official point to accommodate the police. You
must not take today's happenings as a precedent."</p>

<p>"I quite understand, sir." Inspector Pater answered
mechanically; he was quite at a loss to understand the man's
meaning.</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer put the case very fairly to me," continued the
Coroner. "I immediately understood the peculiar circumstances and,
of course, agreed to do all I could to further the interests of
justice." He paused, then continued: "Justice, as from the
viewpoint of the police department concerned only with the arrest
and conviction of the criminal."</p>

<p>"You have been very good." The Inspector spoke blankly. He had
not the faintest idea of what Coroner March was referring to,
except that he could trace in the matter Inspector Murmer's subtle
influence. He promised himself a full and complete understanding
with his fellow-detective. Saul Murmer was not going to use his
name in this fashion, unchecked.</p>

<p>"I am glad you understand, Inspector," Coroner March nodded. "I
am glad I was able to arrange matters to meet your wishes, and that
without any hampering of justice&mdash;in reference to my
department, I mean. Inspector Murmer tells me you expect to make an
arrest at any moment?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, sir."</p>

<p>"Very sad!" The Coroner shook his head. "A young girl, of good
family, handsome, I understand, and on the threshold of a long and
perhaps happy life&mdash;to be caught in this maelstrom of death
and sin&mdash;By the way, Inspector Murmer did not give me her
name?"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater cursed Saul Murmer beneath his breath. What was
the man trying to let him into? Coroner March was inquisitive, and
would not be put aside with any ordinary evasion.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir?"</p>

<p>"I was saying that Inspector Murmer did not give me the name of
the suspect." A cloud of suspicion momentarily darkened Coroner
March's eyes. "He told me that you would probably ask me for a
warrant immediately the inquest closed."</p>

<p>So that was it. Inspector Murmer had played on the man's
inquisitiveness to secure the inquest arrangements he needed. Again
Inspector Pater cursed the Englishman. Did the fat fool think he
would ask this man for a warrant for Miss Poulton's arrest, when he
had not one iota of evidence against her&mdash;only Saul Murmer's
absurd belief that she was the girl he had seen in the room with
the dead man?</p>

<p>"What is your opinion, sir?" Inspector Pater turned to the
Coroner. "You have all the evidence, sworn to at the inquest and
told you privately by Inspector Murmer. Griffiths was stabbed and
shot. Dr. Angus states that either wound would have caused
death&mdash;although he also declares that the man was killed by
the bullet wound. What is your opinion?"</p>

<p>Coroner Marsh pursed his lips, judicially. "The man was shot and
stabbed. Either wound would have caused death. A moot point,
Inspector; a very moot point. Inspector Murmer inclines to the
belief that the girl stabbed Griffiths and that the wound was
fatal. He was shot a few seconds later."</p>

<p>"Very interesting! Very interesting!" Coroner March assumed a
judicial expression. "An interesting point of law, Inspector.
And&mdash;about that warrant, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"You will be at your office this afternoon, sir?"</p>

<p>"Up to five o'clock, Inspector. I have a large quantity of work
on hand. Then&mdash;I shall see you this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Very probably, sir. There are a few minor points on which we
should like to be satisfied before we ask for a warrant&mdash;but I
do not anticipate they will take us long to solve. Either Inspector
Murmer or I will be seeing you shortly."</p>

<p>He glanced about the hall, and into the study, noting that
Inspector Murmer had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir. I have to see Inspector Murmer immediately." He
left the house quickly, breathing a sigh of relief at having
escaped from the awkward predicament into which the Englishman had
landed him. He vowed that when he again faced Inspector Murmer
there would be a full and complete understanding.</p>

<p>He had seen little of Inspector Murmer since the scene in their
room at headquarters with Dizzy Laine. After the newspaper-man had
left them, with the declared challenge to Saul Murmer that he would
break him and send him back to England if he took steps to have the
girl arrested, the Scotland Yard man had evaded him, meeting him
only when others were present and explanations impossible, without
open rupture.</p>

<p>He knew that Saul Murmer was still in the belief that Miss
Poulton was the girl he had seen in Griffiths house: that he was
working to break the alibi that Dizzy had set up. Inspector Pater
was puzzled. Why was the man so set on this one aspect of the
case?</p>

<p>Personally, he was well satisfied with the alibi Dizzy Laine had
set up. He had interviewed several of the persons who the
journalist had claimed he and the girl had met that night.
Unhesitatingly they had told a similar story to that of the
newspaper-man. There could be no doubt that Miss Poulton had been
to the theatre and the restaurant. It was impossible that she could
have gone to Edgecliff.</p>

<p>Casually, Inspector Pater had placed the question of the alibi
before Superintendent Dixon, to have his opinion of the newspaper
man's truth and honesty confirmed by his superior-officer. Both he
and the superintendent had known Dizzy Laine before attaining their
present ranks in the department. They knew him to be very keen in
his peculiar line of the journalistic profession. They had, again
and again, tested a his reliability. They had trusted him with
information at times which might have considerably hampered their
work, if published. They had found that Dizzy kept faith,
scrupulously.</p>

<p>Yet, in this case there was one factor they had not had to count
on in their previous dealings with the journalist. Dizzy was in
love with this girl. Love did incomprehensible things to
people.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater, a bachelor from choice, did not understand
love. He didn't want to understand it. So far, his work had always
been sufficient for him. He was ambitious. Already a
superintendency loomed on his work-day horizon. He knew that he was
young for his Inspectorship, but he had made good in that post. He
knew that if he attained the superintendency that would shortly be
vacant he could make good in it&mdash;and he would be the youngest
superintendent on record.</p>

<p>One of the headquarters men was strolling with apparent
carelessness in the road before the Griffiths house. Inspector
Pater questioned him&mdash;to learn that immediately the inquest
had closed, Inspector Murmer had left the premises, hurrying down
the road to the tram-stop. The incident had impressed itself on the
man's mind, for it was very unusual to see Inspector Murmer
hurrying.</p>

<p>So, thought Inspector Pater, Saul Murmer had left the house
immediately the inquest ended to avoid any explanations with him.
The inference could not be avoided.</p>

<p>John Pater's lips set in a straight line. He set off down the
road, bound for the city. Possibly he would find Murmer in their
room at headquarters. He liked Saul Murmer&mdash;he had a warm
admiration for the man's outstanding abilities&mdash;but he would
not drag along blindly at any man's heels.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer was not at police headquarters. For some time
John Pater lingered in their office, hoping the man would return.
Then he went on a tour of the building. So far as he could gather,
Inspector Murmer had not been seen there that afternoon. He was
recalled to his room by a message that he was wanted on the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Inspector Pater speaking."</p>

<p>"That you, John?" It was Dizzy Laine's voice.</p>

<p>"Yes." Then, instinctively, he asked the question in his
mind.</p>

<p>"Seen anything of Inspector Murmer?"</p>

<p>"No; is he missing?"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen him since the inquest adjourned. Have you?"</p>

<p>"He was talking to Coroner March when I left the house. What's
he doing? Getting his ticket for London-town?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He'd better." A low laugh came on the wire. "Look here, John;
between ourselves, do you think Murmer's on the right track?"</p>

<p>"Regarding the alibi you brought forward?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"I can't shift your alibi."</p>

<p>"I'll give you my word it's exact. Then you're at a loose end?
Take a tip from a pal?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing."</p>

<p>"Then corral that police constable&mdash;Preston's his name. No,
it'll be no good questioning him. He doesn't know that he knows
anything&mdash;but he does. Just collar him and put him in
safety."</p>

<p>"What the devil are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Inhibitions of the sub-conscious mind." Again over the wire
came the newspaper-man's breezy laugh. "Oh, I know you think I'm
mad, so don't take the trouble to say it. You've thought so
before&mdash;and have apologised handsomely. Get this. I've had a
talk with Preston and got something from him he had forgotten. He
won't remember, even now, for I didn't let him know the effect of
what he stated on the case. Leave him alone and keep him safe, if
you have to use one of your cells. Take this seriously. He's damned
precious, if you want the murderer of Stanley Griffiths."</p>

<p>"What's the game, Dizzy?"</p>

<p>"Will you do as I ask?"</p>

<p>"I'll want a reason."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Constable Preston saw the murderer of Stanley
Griffiths&mdash;No, don't ask questions over the telephone. You've
got your reason. Just get hold of Preston and keep him
safe&mdash;and keep what I've said under your hat, I've got one or
two more inquiries to make&mdash;and then I'll have a quiet talk
with you. But&mdash;remember what happened to me yesterday. Preston
may not be as lucky as I was. Get me? And for the sake of little
Mike keep what I've told you right, away from that conceited ass,
Saul Murmer!"</p>

<p>The click of the receiver on the hook at the other end of the
line told Inspector Pater that the newspaper-man had disconnected.
He replaced the receiver at his end, thoughtfully. What had Dizzy
on his mind? Constable Preston! He was the patrolman who had passed
the house a minute before Inspector Murmer had found the door open.
The man had sworn he had flashed his light on the house when he
passed and that then the door and windows were properly secured.
Now Dizzy stated that the constable had seen the murderer: that he
did not understand what he had seen. But Pater remembered that he
had had the man down to headquarters and had questioned him
closely. He was certain that he had all the information the man
possessed. Yet, the newspaper-man was not in the habit of making
wild guesses. Usually, when he spoke, he had exact details to
support his assertions.</p>

<p>Inhibitions of the sub-conscious mind! Rat-tails!</p>

<p>Inspector Pater started to laugh, then suddenly sobered. In this
game he could not afford to miss a single point. Dizzy had called
to his remembrance the two attempts that had been made on his life;
he had asserted that an attempt would probably be made on Preston's
life, if the fact that he was in possession of information
regarding the murder became known. That was possible, if those
connected with Stanley Griffiths death thought the man dangerous.
Constable Preston was patrolling a lonely part of Edgecliff; it
would be easy for a bold man to place him beyond questioning.</p>

<p>He caught at the telephone, giving instructions that Constable
Preston was to report to headquarters and stay there, until after
the inquiries concerning the murder were finalised. When he
replaced the telephone on the desk he glanced at the clock in the
corner. It was a quarter to six. There was nothing to retain him at
his office. He smiled quietly. Coroner March had probably left his
office for the night, his curiosity unsatisfied. In some manner he
would have to make his peace with the man. March was too useful to
deliberately offend. Ah, he had it.</p>

<p>He would telephone the man the next morning and tell him that
Inspector Murmer had not returned to headquarters that night, or up
to that time, and that he could not act until he had examined the
information the detective was gathering. Again he cursed Saul
Murmer&mdash;this time not under his breath.</p>

<p>Rapidly clearing up the few matters that still needed his
attention, Inspector Pater closed his desk and went down to the
street. He strolled leisurely eastwards, across Hyde Park to the
corner of William-street. There he mounted a tram and rose up the
hill to King's Cross. For the moment the thought of his lonely
rooms did not appeal.</p>

<p>He glanced about the six-way square, then went to a restaurant
he had patronised on several former occasions. Ordering a big meal,
he enjoyed it leisurely, then lit his pipe. He sauntered slowly
homewards.</p>

<p>A letter was in the hall-rack, awaiting him. It had been
delivered by hand. He noted that point as he tore the envelope open
but did not pay attention to the writing of the address. Inside,
the envelope was a single sheet of paper: On it were only a couple
of lines, scrawled in pencil:</p>

<p class="letter">"Get into your glad-rags, John.<br>
I'm taking you out to dinner. Saul."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">FOR almost a minute Inspector Pater stood, staring
at the note in his hand. He thought, regretfully, of the big meal
he had just eaten. Two dinners in one evening, and the first a
satisfying repast! And that on a hot day! Yet, never for one moment
did he think of declining the invitation. He knew that behind the
few scrawled words lay a large meaning. What that meaning was, he
could not guess. The note was not, in any way an apology for the
differences and incidents of the past hours&mdash;it was not an
attempt at reconciliation. That was not in Saul Murmer's
character.</p>

<p>Back of John Pater's mind lay the thought that the Englishman
was about to make one of his characteristic surprise moves; some
move, or moves, that would prove his theories concerning the death
of Stanley Griffiths correct. But, what move would he make? Saul
Murmer would have to produce very strong and exact evidence to
over-ride the alibi Dizzy had set up for the girl. And then there
was the information the newspaper-man had conveyed to him that
evening. Whatever that evidence might be, Dizzy would not be
chuckling over it&mdash;hinting that it would send Saul Murmer back
to London, defeated&mdash;if it in any way affected Miss
Poulton.</p>

<p>What information had Saul Murmer? Had he come across evidence
that broke the alibi and would convict the girl of the crime? In
that case the mystery surrounding Stanley Griffiths death had come
down to a fight for credibility between the English detective and
the Australian newspaper-man. Dizzy would go into the box, to swear
to the alibi he had erected. He would produce the further
information he had gathered.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater shook his head, sadly. He liked Saul Murmer; he
liked Dizzy Laine. In the forthcoming battle of wits and evidence
one or the other must suffer. If Murmer proved his case, then Dizzy
would certainly stand in the dock on a charge of perjury. A
conviction could not be avoided. The detective frowned. He would
have given much to have a heart to heart talk with the
newspaper-man at that moment.</p>

<p>Half-unconsciously, he moved in the direction of the telephone,
then shrugged, and put the thought from him. Dizzy would hold to
his set line of action, in spite of anything he might say; in
disregard of any reasons he might adduce that the pressing of a
fake alibi might hurt the girl's chances of acquittal. Dizzy was
mad&mdash;love-mad. Even if Saul Murmer proved his case against
her, destroyed the alibi Dizzy was intent on establishing, the girl
was in little danger. She would not be convicted of the murder of
Stanley Griffiths. No jury would convict her of that. A clever
lawyer would make much of the positions the various parties in the
drama occupied at the moment of the man's death. He would
plead&mdash;and prove&mdash;that Stanley Griffiths was a sex-fiend;
that the girl had struck him while defending her honour. She might
be convicted of manslaughter. A term of imprisonment might be
imposed&mdash;a few months, at least. She might even go free from
the charge: for her lawyer would make much of the fact that the man
who had fired the shot into Stanley Griffiths back had not been
caught by the police. In dealing with that aspect of the affair the
defence would have Dr. Angus on their side.</p>

<p>The medical examiner had been insistent that the man had been
alive after the dagger-thrust and before the bullet pierced his
heart. And while the girl had walked free from the charge, Dizzy
would be in the cells to answer an undefendable charge of perjury.
What a mess the love-factor had made of a quite ordinary case!</p>

<p>Inspector Pater shrugged, finishing his dressing. Two of the
main characters in the business were enveloping it in a fog of
mystery. Why had Inspector Murmer held so insistently to the trail
of the girl? Reason as he might, John Pater could not understand
it. If the Englishman had only been reasonable, consulted with him
and held to the trail of the man who had fired the shot. They could
have kept quiet observation on the girl, holding the case against
her in reserve. In that manner they would go into court with a
complete case. Now Murmer was acting on his own theories&mdash;and
those theories would certainly bring trouble.</p>

<p>Almost he felt inclined to betray Dizzy's confidences of that
afternoon. Saul Murmer was a reasonable man! He would take the
newspaper-man's statements regarding Constable Preston into serious
consideration. The constable would be at police headquarters. It
would not be difficult to get hold of the newspaper-man. He would
talk straight to Saul Murmer, show him that in the past Dizzy Laine
had helped the police, often obtaining valuable information for
them. He would insist that a peace be patched up between the two
men. Then they could hold a conference at their office, with
Constable Preston and Dizzy in attendance. Dizzy could bring
forward his new evidence&mdash;bring back to the constable's mind
the subconscious impressions he claimed him to have. Murmer could
go ahead on that evidence, if he considered, it worthwhile and
scoop up all the credit he desired. That would be logical and make
for pleasanter surroundings.</p>

<p>He glanced in the glass again, settling his tie. As he turned to
reach his jacket the door-bell rang. Still struggling with the
close-fitting coat, he went to the door and loosened the latch.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer, at his call, pushed open the door and ambled into
the small hall.</p>

<p>"Ready, John?"</p>

<p>"Just one moment." There was no difference in the Englishman's
tones and manner. For all his voice showed they might have parted
but a couple of hours before in terms of amity, with the
understanding that during the evening they were to seek the bright
lights of the city for recreation and amusement.</p>

<p>John Pater went into his bedroom with overcoat and hat. On the
pavement, outside the building, Saul Murmer held up his stick to a
touring taxi. When the man came to the curb the stout detective
motioned for his companion to enter the vehicle.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Inspector Pater, as the car shot forward.</p>

<p>"Curious?" A little chuckle came out of the semi-darkness where
the Englishman sat.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>The dim light of an illuminated watch showed in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock. John. 'Fraid you'll have to wait a bit."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"To where the golden youth of Sydney hold high revels."</p>

<p>"To find Miss Poulton," interposed John Pater aloud. "What for?
You haven't got a warrant. I didn't get one, although Coroner March
tried to draw one on your instigation, I believe."</p>

<p>"So he took the bait?" Again the sly chuckle out of the darkness
of the car. "Poor John!"</p>

<p>"I don't work in the dark, Saul."</p>

<p>"You'll have plenty of light presently, John." The Australian
could feel laughter shaking the big bulk beside him. "Plenty of
light!"</p>

<p>"You're damned mysterious." Inspector Pater could not keep the
growl from his tones. Inspector Murmer took no notice of the
remark.</p>

<p>"You've not said where we are going?" John Pater asked at
length. The taxi was in the city now, bowling smoothly over the
well-made roads. Even now he could not place their destination.</p>

<p>"Patolini's."</p>

<p>"The 'Sixty-Forty' Club!" exclaimed Pater. "Oh, well, they do
put on a good meal there."</p>

<p>"And the dinner's up to me." Again came the sly chuckle. "You'll
enjoy it all the more, eh?"</p>

<p>"Suppose you'll put it down to expenses?" Inspector Pater turned
exasperatedly on his companion. "Look here, Saul, in this country
we hunt in couples&mdash;"</p>

<p>"London-town sometimes plays a lone-hand," interjected the stout
detective. "The inference is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn the inference!" John Pater exploded. "That the Australian
crooks are a lot more dangerous than their English confrères. That
so, John?"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater did not answer. The taxi swung into a side
street and slowed to stop at a brilliantly illuminated doorway.
They had arrived at Patolini's night-club. Inspector Pater stepped
to the pavement and waited while his companion paid off the
taxi-driver. Side by side they entered the establishment and,
without speaking, went to the cloakroom. When they left it a waiter
escorted them to a well-placed table beside the dancing-floor, yet
screened from too free observation.</p>

<p>When the man, at a nod from Inspector Murmer, moved away. John
Pater decided that the affair had been planned by his companion in
advance. The dancing room was half-empty, yet at intervals people
entered, in couples and in groups. They were early, and John Pater
guessed that his companion, who levelled in the luxuries of life,
had chosen to arrive early and enjoy his dinner before the time for
action arrived. John Pater, who enjoyed a high-class meal as well
as any man, devoted himself to the dishes placed before him: yet
with an inward groan at thoughts of the dinner he had already
eaten.</p>

<p>Patolini's! And the girl, Poulton, was known through the city as
"The Flirting Fool." Probably she would be there, in that room,
that night. But, how would that serve Saul Murmer? He had no
warrant, and in the circumstances a warrant was necessary. Of
course, in cases of necessity, they could act without a warrant,
detaining on suspicion. There was no evidence that the girl knew of
Inspector Murmer's suspicions, unless Dizzy Laine had told her, and
in that case the journalist would have assured her that she had
nothing to fear; that her alibi was unassailable.</p>

<p>John Pater looked up the room with a fervent hope in his heart
that she would not visit the night-club while he and Saul Murmer
were there. If Inspector Murmer took any deliberate action, then
there would be trouble with Superintendent Dixon on the morrow.
Dixon liked to be consulted on the evidence in a case before a
warrant was applied for and the arrest made.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater shrugged again. Saul Murmer had taken his own
line and would have to bear the brunt of any explanations regarding
actions he took that evening. One thing he resolved. Unless he had
indisputable evidence given him that his comrade was not
mistaken&mdash;that he had a hole-proof case against the
girl&mdash;he would take no active part in the matter. His
presence, though he remained silent, would have to suffice. Yes, he
would remain silent, adapting himself to what might happen.</p>

<p>Slowly the dinner dragged to an end. Signs were unmistakable
that Saul Murmer was enjoying himself. So far as Inspector Pater
was concerned, he appreciated the excellent meal&mdash;although he
did not want it.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer leaned back in his chair, fingering his
wine-glass.</p>

<p>"All set, John?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"The arrest of Miss Poulton."</p>

<p>"So that's what you dragged me here to-night for." Inspector
Pater flushed quickly. "You're hitting rocks, big boy. What about
Dizzy Laine's alibi?"</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer snapped his fingers in the air; his eyes
twinkling. "Busted wide open."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," Inspector Pater spoke flatly. "Dizzy's a
good boy. I don't believe he'd lie, even for a girl he was fond
of."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;he's fond of this Poulton girl?"</p>

<p>"Even a man as blind as you can see that." Again Saul Murmer
chuckled.</p>

<p>"'Fraid my eyes are open, John&mdash;" he broke off, abruptly.
"Here she comes!"</p>

<p>A party of four persons, two men and two girls, had entered the
hall. A few steps in the lead walked a tall slim girl, exquisitely
dressed, her well-groomed mop of dark hair finely setting her small
oval face, lit by quick-moving, sparkling eyes. John Pater
recognised her on the instant. It was the girl he had seen in
Sauber's Restaurant with Dizzy Laine&mdash;yet there was a subtle
difference. Not in the girl's physical appearance; there the
likeness was exact, except for the extraneous differences between
day and evening dresses. Yes; it was the same girl.</p>

<p>He searched the group of three people following her. Dizzy Laine
was not in attendance. For some reason the police officer felt
glad. The party came to a table close by where the two Inspectors
sat, the girl still walking a couple of paces before her
companions, talking to them over her swinging shoulders. Now the
Australian recognised that Saul Murmer had not come there by
chance. He had set the stage for the play he proposed to make. The
two tables were in strategic positions. If he contemplated an
arrest it could be made without any too great publicity.
But&mdash;an arrest! On what grounds&mdash;when they were without a
warrant?</p>

<p>John Pater leaned forward, speaking in low tones. "You're going
to arrest her to-night, Saul?"</p>

<p>"No!" The baby-blue eyes were entirely guileless. "You are,
John."</p>

<p>"I'll see you in hell first." John Pater flushed angrily. "You
know we haven't evidence to ask for a warrant on."</p>

<p>A paper slid forward on the table, to rest beside John Pater's
hand. "The warrant, John."</p>

<p>Interestedly, the tall man opened the document. The warrant was
in proper form; the information contained therein being sworn to by
Inspector Saul Murmer. "I'm damned if I will. You swore out that
warrant; why don't you execute it?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer looked insignificantly down at his pronounced
roundity. "You know I'm not built for rough and tumble work,
John."</p>

<p>"With a slip of a girl, eh?" In spite of his anger John Pater
could not help grinning. "So I'm to be the goat? What on? Think
again, Saul!"</p>

<p>A bulky foolscap envelope slid on to the table almost magically.
Curiously the senior Inspector opened it. A dozen or more letters,
secured by a metal fastener, slid out on his hand. He turned to the
end of the first letter. It was signed "Aggie" in large, sprawling,
girlish characters. John Pater glanced through the correspondence.
The letters were from a foolish girl madly in love with a practised
woman-hunter; letters that breathed passion, yet with a curious
restraint. Letters that revealed the innate purity of a woman's
soul, the lure of marriage, the reluctant repugnance to the illicit
relations the letters they answered must have hinted at.</p>

<p>The letters were addressed to "Dearest Stan." Behind each letter
he found its envelope. So, Stanley Griffiths preserved even the
envelopes of his love correspondence. They had been carefully cut
open, not ripped in the manner of an earnest lover. John Pater
remembered now. When he had searched the man's desk at the house in
Wonthaggi-avenue he had found many letters from women. In every
instance the letter had been slipped into its original envelope;
and the envelopes held together with elastic bands.</p>

<p>He wondered at the mentality of the man. Many of the letters he
had found were from women with whom the dead man had long ceased
relations. Why had he kept them?</p>

<p>Almost reluctant at having to thus peer into the revelations of
a woman's soul, John Pater skimmed through the letters, and came to
the last. He looked up quickly at Saul Murmer. The Englishman was
staring idly about the night club, the inevitable cheap cigarette
dangling from his lower lip.</p>

<p>John Pater read the letter again. It was dated six days before
the day before the man's death. The letter referred to an
appointment for that evening. Stanley Griffiths and the girl were
going to have supper and dance at this very
night-club&mdash;Patolini's.</p>

<p>Yet, Dizzy Laine had sworn that the girl spent the evening with
him at the theatre, and they had afterwards gone to Dalmano's
Restaurant. He had stated that they stayed at the restaurant
dancing with friends until after one o'clock. Had Dizzy persuaded
the girl to break her appointment with Stanley Griffiths, and
accompany him to the theatre? That was possible. Yet, if the girl
who had stabbed Griffiths had been in the house at Edgecliff at
midnight, Dizzy Laine had lied to save the girl! If the girl had
told him of the happenings in the house in Wonthaggi-avenue. Only
in one manner could those questions be answered. Almost reluctantly
Inspector Pater rose to his feet, picking up the warrant. He
glanced down the room. The girl was returning to her table, after
dancing with one of her companions. She glanced, inquisitively at
the tall man slowly approaching the table where she and her
companions sat&mdash;a glance blank in itself, yet filled with the
native woman's appreciation to the well-conditioned male.</p>

<p>"Miss Poulton&mdash;Miss Agatha Poulton?" queried Inspector
Pater, halting beside the table and looking down on the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes?" Agatha Poulton looked up startled. Inspector Pater
thought he detected a trace of fear behind the inquisitiveness in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am Inspector John Pater, of the New South Wales Police
Department, investigating the death of Stanley Griffiths." The
detective spoke quietly in low tones. "It is necessary for me to
ask you a few questions."</p>

<p>Now the detective recognised fear in the girl's eyes. With a big
effort she retained her customary indifferent manner. She nodded to
a chair which one of her companions had vacated at the Inspector's
approach.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Inspector Pater? This is rather an original
time for a police inquisition, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid in these cases we cannot pick times to suit
occasions." The Inspector's tones hardened. "I believe you were
acquainted with the late Stanley Griffiths?"</p>

<p>For a moment the girl hesitated, then nodded. "It is my duty to
warn you that I hold a warrant for your arrest and that any
statement you may make may be used against you. Do you understand?
There is no need for you to answer questions or make any statement,
and I believe your friends would advise you not to say anything.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you driving at?" One of the men with the girl turned
on Inspector Pater angrily. "We've only your word you're a police
officer. I object to you intruding at this table and speaking to
this lady. If&mdash;" Inspector Pater silenced him with a look. He
turned again to the girl, and hesitated. A short, rotund form had
appeared beside him, staring down on the girl. "Good evening, Miss
Poulton. Do you remember the last time we met&mdash;in the house at
Wonthaggi-avenue, when you locked me in a bedroom?"</p>

<p>The sleek, quiet tones of the English detective made the girl
start and turn quickly. For a long moment she stared up into the
seemingly innocent baby-blue eyes looking down on her. Her breath
caught sharply, and she bent forward until her dark head suddenly
touched the table-cloth, brushing aside a glass filled with wine.
The glass overturned, close to her face and a stream of crimson
spread across the cloth, as if blood from the girl's head. "God!
She's fainted."</p>

<p>A tall, fair girl, seated opposite Agatha Poulton sprang to her
feet and moved quickly round the table. But Inspector Pater was
before her. Carefully he gathered the insensible girl in his arms
and strode to the door, beckoning with his head for the fair girl
to follow him. One of the men at the table made to rise, but
Inspector Murmer stayed him with an imperative gesture.</p>

<p>"Keep your seats, gentlemen." The light, lazy voice held a note
of command. "If you wish to do Miss Poulton a service you will
continue your evening's amusement&mdash;and keep silent
tongues."</p>

<p>"Look here." A slender, rather effeminate-looking man faced the
English detective, anger glowering in his eyes. "I want to know
what this is all about?"</p>

<p>"If you must know&mdash;" Inspector Murmer's words came
reluctantly. "Miss Poulton is under arrest for the murder of
Stanley Griffiths. For her sake and your own, I advise you not to
interfere or draw undue attention to this table."</p>

<p>Leisurely, and without another glance at the two dumbfounded
men, Inspector Murmer turned on his heels and ambled from the
room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Inspector Pater awoke next morning, from a
troubled night's slumber, he was not at all happy and contented.
Through the long night hours the scene in the night-club recurred
intermittently to his memory. Somewhere in his brain lurked the
thought that Saul Murmer had, in some way, taken a deliberate
advantage of him; rushing him into a position that was neither
entirely logical or defensible&mdash;a position he would not have
assumed had he taken time to think.</p>

<p>He had arrested Agatha Poulton for the murder of Stanley
Griffiths&mdash;and on evidence that the English detective had
thrust upon him suddenly; evidence that completely destroyed the
alibi that Dizzy Laine had set up, and which he had been prepared
to believe. But, did it? All that the letters Saul Murmer had
produced made out that the girl had been intimate with the dead man
when he had heard her declare that she did not know him.</p>

<p>That she had apparently been with him on the night of his
death&mdash;when Dizzy Laine had sworn that she was with him at the
theatre. What had the girl really done? Had she kept the written
appointment with Stanley Griffiths? In that lay the crux of the
case. If she had kept it, then there was little doubt that she was
the girl Saul Murmer had seen in the dead man's house. But, if she
could prove that she had broken that appointment, made in the last
letter she had written to him; if she could prove that she had
spent the evening in the company of the journalist
then&mdash;Inspector Pater grinned wryly. Then there would be wigs
on the green, with a vengeance. Dizzy's alibi would stand, and he
and Saul Murmer would pass many uncomfortable half-hours with
Superintendent Dixon and, possibly, the Commissioner.</p>

<p>Yet he doubted. He had seen the knowledge and terror growing in
the girl's eyes when she had looked up into his face. He had read
in her eyes the realisation of the secret fears that lay deep in
her mind. That glance, if he had read it aright, betokened guilt
and the fear of punishment. Slowly, almost with reluctance, he
dressed and prepared for the work of the day. His breakfast tasted
insipid; the coffee lacked sting; the bacon and eggs, to his eyes
done to a turn, felt like grit in his mouth. He left most of it
untouched and went out into the streets.</p>

<p>He mounted a city-bound tram, to find that it fled down the
steep incline of William-street with incredible speed. The walk
across Hyde Park had never seemed so short. From Elizabeth street
to Central-lane appeared to occupy but a few seconds of time. With
weighted feet he mounted the stairs to the office he shared with
Inspector Murmer. He almost prayed that the Englishman had not yet
arrived; he wanted some moments alone to collect his thoughts, to
drive from him the memories that crowded his brain.</p>

<p>Yet, as he set foot on the top stair he knew that time for
mental collection would not be granted him. He could hear Inspector
Murmer's voice, the smooth silky voice rising and falling in level
cadences. Another voice sounded within his room: a deep, powerful
voice charged with the owner's realisation of self-importance. The
opening door showed Saul Murmer comfortably ensconced in the big
chair before the window.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room stood Constable Preston, big, and
important-looking, but with a bewildered expression on his large
round face. A second glance at the English detective showed that
he, for one, was entirely happy.</p>

<p>"Oversleep yourself, John?" The quick, lazy-looking baby-blue
eyes met John Pater's with a look in which the Australian, believed
he could read derision. "Remember what you told me last night of
that theory your journalistic
friend&mdash;what's-his-name&mdash;held? Well, Constable Preston's
been amusing me with an account of his adventures on the night that
Stanley Griffiths was bumped off. He doesn't seem to have seen
much."</p>

<p>"No?" John Pater, turned and hung his hat on the stand in the
corner. Almost reluctantly he went to the big desk and slipped into
his chair. "Just how much?"</p>

<p>"Just&mdash;nothing." Saul Murmer's hand went down between his
large person and the seat arm, fishing for his inevitable packet of
cigarettes. "'Fraid our friend the journalist, is&mdash;er
romancing. Constable Preston is&mdash;he'll forgive me saying it, I
know&mdash;a frost."</p>

<p>"Yet Dizzy appears to think that he knows quite a lot." John
Pater busied himself with some reports on his desk, under cover of
which movement he covertly watched his brother inspector.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dizzy Laine." Saul Murmer blew a ring of smoke towards the
ceiling. "I've told you before, John, the principal asset of a
newspaper-man is the ability to make a good story out of
nothing."</p>

<p>The Australian detective ignored the sneer underlying the words.
He turned sharply on the constable. "Well, Preston; just what do
you know?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir." Preston looked bewildered.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater studied the man silently. He appeared flurried
and distressed. John Pater had a suspicion that before he had
arrived on the scene Murmer had hazed the man unmercifully. He was
about to speak when Saul Murmer interposed.</p>

<p>"Just one thing, John. There were a couple of drunks in
Wonthaggi-Avenue that night."</p>

<p>"And you saw nothing of them?" Pater turned in his chair to face
Inspector Murmer.</p>

<p>"From what Constable Preston tells me, they turned out of the
Avenue before I entered it. Preston says he met them at the
Pantheon Road corner. I came into the Avenue from Edgecliff Road.
You will remember, I was only a few yards along Wonthaggi Avenue
when I met Constable Preston."</p>

<p>"Recognise them, Preston?"</p>

<p>"No, sir?"</p>

<p>"Then you really know nothing?" Saul Murmer stared blankly at
the big man. "Really, John, I don't think he is any use here, and
should be back on duty."</p>

<p>Inspector Pater did not reply. He was puzzling nebulous thoughts
in his mind. Murmer was not usually early at the office; yet he had
arrived before him that day&mdash;and he was well in advance of his
usual time! Again, Dizzy Laine had told him that Constable Preston
held the solution of the Griffiths murder case&mdash;yet did not
know it. The man freely stated that he knew nothing. Was that
because of the sub-conscious memory the newspaper-man had spoken of
lying dormant&mdash;because&mdash;Well, he might just as well admit
it to himself, although he would not utter the words because of his
late interview with Inspector Murmer.</p>

<p>The Australian detective shrugged impatiently. On the telephone
Dizzy had referred to two attempts on his life&mdash;of those
attempts he had witnessed one himself, the other had been witnessed
by Inspector Murmer. Dizzy had declared that Miss Poulton had only
spoken to Stanley Griffiths once in her life; yet in his desk lay a
number of letters showing that the girl was either madly in love
with the dead man or in some manner had been under his subjection.
Was the journalist mistaken on all counts of theory? He
wondered.</p>

<p>"You had better report back to your division, Preston," Murmur's
soft voice broke the silence that had descended on the little room.
He glanced at the Australian seated behind the big desk. "You think
that, John?"</p>

<p>Reluctantly, John Pater nodded. Constable Preston saluted and
walked from the room.</p>

<p>When the door closed again there was again a long silence. Saul
Murmer lay back in his comfortable chair, blowing ring after ring
of smoke towards the dirty ceiling. John Pater had his arms folded
on his writing-pad, staring before him blankly, his brows creased
in troubled thought.</p>

<p>"What's worrying you, John?" The stout detective spoke at
length.</p>

<p>"The whole damned business!" Pater answered shortly. "I've never
known Dizzy Laine to be so far wrong before."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Dizzy Laine!"</p>

<p>"No good sneering, Saul. That boy knows his oats. If he
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He said that the girl had an alibi&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and you arrested her."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Australian checked the words that rose to his lips. He
gained his feet and strode up and down the small room. Not for
first time in their association he felt resentment of the methods
used by the English detective. Saul Murmer had subtle methods of
shifting the onus of deeds from his own shoulders onto other men's.
That was not fair.</p>

<p>John Pater blamed himself greatly. The previous evening he had
been lazy, well-fed and contented, completely off his guard. He had
been intrigued by the story Saul Murmer had presented to him by the
subtle interlocking of story and evidence. While he had listened he
had had the girl before his eyes. He had watched her; her attitude
towards her companions; the sex mastery she had exhibited. Even as
he had watched the phrase had come into his mind: "The Flirting
Fool!" Yes, she was that&mdash;and more!</p>

<p>And while his sub-conscious brain had been resenting her
attitude towards her small world, Saul Murmer had placed under his
eyes convincing proof of her duplicity and irresponsibleness.
Sudden resentment at the girl, of her dragging a decent fellow like
Dizzy Laine at her chariot wheels, had seized him. At the very
moment he had felt that he must act, Saul Murmer had placed in his
grasp the warrant of arrest. He had acted&mdash;arresting her and
now&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why didn't you make the arrest yourself, Saul?" He swung
suddenly on the man.</p>

<p>"You did it ever so much more kindly, John."</p>

<p>Pater shrugged at the blandness of the voice; of the innocence
of the eyes watching him. "Besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides what?"</p>

<p>"You were the senior officer present. That was the arrangement
under which I came to Australia."</p>

<p>John Pater shrugged impatiently. It was impossible to corner
this man; to obtain from him a plain answer to a pertinent
question. He had to confess there was truth in what Saul Murmer
said&mdash;and that very truth angered him. "Suppose so! And I've
got to defend that arrest to the Superintendent."</p>

<p>"He's a reasonable man, John."</p>

<p>"Some&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps more reasonable and logical than his two star
detectives."</p>

<p>The two Inspectors, intent on the battle of words between them,
had not noticed the door open. They looked up, to see Dizzy Laine
leaning against the door-post. For a moment John Pater looked at
the newspaper-man, his anger suddenly rising.</p>

<p>A shadow moved in the gloom of the passage beyond the door. A
streak of light from the window fell on it, and he recognised that
it was the Edgecliff constable.</p>

<p>"Constable Preston!" Inspector Pater spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer instructed you to report to Edgecliff, for
duty."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;Inspector Murmer gave that order." Dizzy lounged into
the room, allowing the constable to come to the door. "Inspector
Murmer was willing to risk a man's life to prove his inflexible
theory?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;we decided that Constable Preston saw nothing," said
Inspector Pater angrily. He turned again to the constable. "Why
have you disobeyed orders?"</p>

<p>"I met him in the street and told him to come back with me."
Dizzy spoke calmly.</p>

<p>For a moment the Australian detective stared; then laughed
shortly.</p>

<p>"Getting a bit above yourself, Dizzy? When did you start giving
orders in the police department?"</p>

<p>Dizzy stared down at his wristwatch.</p>

<p>"Nine and a half-minutes ago." His right hand, stuffed into his
trousers-pocket, came out slowly. Something rattled from his closed
hand on to the desk-top.</p>

<p>"Just after someone tried to pot either Constable Preston or me
in Central Lane. I haven't quite made up my mind which. Still, you
might know. There's the bullet."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" Mechanically John Pater picked up the flattened
bullet: "Where did this come from?"</p>

<p>"Took a half and half course between Preston's and my heads, as
we stood talking at the top of the lane. Of course, it might have
been intended as a present for me&mdash;they've tried to give me
two before&mdash;but&mdash;Well, I've got a suspicion that just
recently someone has learned that Constable Preston might be a
menace to a life&mdash;or a comforting theory."</p>

<p>"You're telling me that you were shot at in Central Lane? Who
by?"</p>

<p>"The gent's visiting card does not bear a name." Dizzy indicated
the bullet in Pater's hand. "Fired from a silenced gun. As there
were plenty of people about, probably fired from the hip&mdash;and
damned good shooting! I'll say that for the marksman!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is this all the evidence?" Murmer asked lazily.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Dizzy turned coolly to the man in the
window-seat.</p>

<p>"We have only your word for the&mdash;er&mdash;alleged
shooting."</p>

<p>"Constable Preston, was there," reminded the newspaper-man.</p>

<p>"Oh! Constable Preston! An&mdash;er&mdash;important
witness."</p>

<p>"You forget, my life has been twice attempted." Dizzy spoke with
forced calmness.</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>A second smoke-ring caught up to its predecessor and passed
through it, flawlessly. Inspector Murmer stared towards the
ceiling, as if greatly intrigued.</p>

<p>"I believe you were a witness of the first attempt to put me out
of this inquiry." Dizzy's clenched hands showed that he was holding
himself in check, strongly.</p>

<p>"Witness of a brick accidentally dropping from a builder's
scaffolding," Inspector Murmer corrected. "I believe similar
accidents have happened before&mdash;even in this city of
Sydney."</p>

<p>"Inspector Pater&mdash;" Dizzy spoke impulsively, then checked
himself. "So that is the attitude you are taking, Inspector
Murmer?"</p>

<p>"Constable Preston, I think you had better report back to your
local sergeant." Inspector Murmer took no notice of the
newspaper-man's question.</p>

<p>"And I say that he will remain at police headquarters, in
safety." Dizzy spoke firmly.</p>

<p>"The new Commissioner&mdash;Dizzy Laine!" Saul Murmer jeered. "I
will put the question to the Commissioner, with pleasure."</p>

<p>The newspaper-man laughed slightly; he had his nerves well under
control now.</p>

<p>"Look here, Dizzy&mdash;" commenced John Pater.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You asked me to bring Preston to headquarters, said that he had
important information for us. I've questioned him this morning. He
knows nothing new, I'm satisfied of that. Damn it!" Inspector Pater
jumped to his feet and strode across the room to face the
journalist. "If you know anything, why don't you speak?"</p>

<p>"I assure you, I know quite a lot. I'll talk when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, when?" Pater asked curiously when the newspaper-man
paused.</p>

<p>"When Miss Poulton is released from custody, and satisfactory
apologies are tendered by the police department."</p>

<p>John Pater stared at the journalist in blank astonishment. He
turned on his heels and went back to his desk.</p>

<p>"Is that all you require?"</p>

<p>He tugged open one of the drawers of his desk and took out some
papers. "Look at these, young man&mdash;letters from that girl to
Griffiths. Love letters; letters speaking of an assignation that
night&mdash;the night he was murdered; the night Inspector Murmer
saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Said</i> he saw&mdash;" corrected Dizzy.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it," Inspector Pater snorted angrily. He turned to
where the English detective sat. "Saul, I've taken your statement
that you saw the girl in Griffiths house, so far&mdash;No, you
swore yesterday at the inquest that there was a girl there. Will
you swear now that the girl we arrested last night was the girl you
saw the night Griffiths was murdered?"</p>

<p>"Within the past week Mr. Dizzy Laine&mdash;journalist&mdash;has
asked that question of me&mdash;No," Inspector Murmer corrected
himself. "Mr. Laine asked me if there was any resemblance between
the girl in his company and the girl I saw in Wonthaggi Avenue. I
stated then that they were the same girl&mdash;and I still affirm
that!" Inspector Murmer spoke with more energy than he usually
employed.</p>

<p>For a moment Inspector Pater stared at him, then swung to face
the journalist.</p>

<p>"So, Inspector Murmer swears that the girl he saw with me in the
restaurant is the girl he saw sitting on the couch above the dead
man." A small smile flecked Dizzy's lips. "I'll remind him of that
oath one day." He turned to Inspector Pater. "And&mdash;he got
<i>you</i> to arrest her last night! Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>The newspaper-man's hand went to his breast-pocket. It came away
with a long, legal-looking document between the fingers. He held it
out, as if reluctant to part with it. The two Inspectors and the
constable watched him curiously.</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer has sworn that the girl he saw with me stabbed
Stanley Griffiths in the neck. Note my words, Inspector
Pater&mdash;stabbed him in the neck. She did not murder him in
spite of Inspector Murmer's sworn warrant, for Dr. Angus is
prepared to take expert oath that the man was killed by a bullet. I
put forward an alibi&mdash;a true alibi&mdash;against that
statement by Inspector Murmer. To you, John Pater, I gave a list of
people who would support that alibi&mdash;people who had seen the
girl with me that night in places where she could not possibly have
been within a couple of the dead man. I gave you my word of honour
that my statement was entirely true. I know you investigated the
evidence I gave you, satisfying yourself by independent questioning
of many people that they were in Miss Poulton's company at the
moment Stanley Griffiths was murdered. Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dizzy Laine paused, and held the folded paper towards Inspector
Pater.</p>

<p>"You've accepted Inspector Murmer's single statement against the
evidence of myself and my friends. I'm challenging you to prove his
words. To that end, I have today made a sworn statement of the
facts as I know them. Here it is, drawn and attested by one of the
leading attorneys of this city. If I have sworn falsely&mdash;if
Inspector Murmer can prove that I have sworn falsely&mdash;then I
shall go to prison. But, mark me, if I am free and alive, I appear
at Miss Poulton's trial and shall verbally confirm what is here
recorded. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be careful, Dizzy!" Inspector Pater spoke impulsively.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to fear." The newspaper-man drew himself up
proudly. "What Inspector Murmer has to fear I neither know nor
care. If he is correct, then proceed against me on that sworn
statement and indict me for perjury. If that statement
stands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" The word, almost an exclamation, came from the
stout man in the window seat.</p>

<p>"Then Inspector Saul Murmer takes the journey I prophesied for
him a few days ago&mdash;a journey back to his mudheap on the banks
of the Thames, his sticky tail well tricked between his legs in
whipped, cowed curl!"</p>

<p>For a moment Inspector Murmer flushed angrily. John Pater noted
that the fingers lying on the padded arms of the chair clutched
convulsively at the fabric.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, John." With a shrug Dizzy turned to the door. "I was
coming here this morning to place before you certain
evidence&mdash;evidence that would lead to the arrest of Stanley
Griffiths murderer. In spite of your action last night&mdash;your
strange arrest of Miss Poulton&mdash;I came in friendly feeling
and&mdash;" he paused. "And I find my principal witness roaming the
streets unguarded, when I had warned you there was an armed killer
in the track of anyone who tried to destroy Inspector Murmer's
famous theory. Now I'll see that he is protected. I'm going to
Superintendent Dixon, and if he is too hide-bound to take proper
precautions then&mdash;then the <i>Post Advertiser</i> will ask the
public this afternoon why Inspector Murmer, star detective of New
Scotland Yard, London, England, is interested in the death of the
one man who can identify the slayer of Stanley
Griffiths&mdash;Constable John Preston."</p>

<p>With a short nod, and beckoning to the constable to accompany
him, Dizzy Laine left the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">FROM the moment Dizzy Laine closed the door of the
Inspectors' room after Constable Preston and himself, he
disappeared from the detectives' vision.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Inspectors Murmer and Pater were summoned to
Superintendent Dixon's office. Dixon had little to say, though he
smiled quietly and secretly while they answered his questions. He
heard their explanations regarding the arrest of Miss Poulton
without comment, instructing them to prepare the case for the
Public Prosecutor's Office.</p>

<p>Just before the detectives left him, he gave implicit
instructions that Constable Preston was to be retained at police
headquarters, making the two Inspectors surety for his well-being.
Finally, he instructed that Constable Preston was to attend the
trial, suitably guarded.</p>

<p>"Understand me?" Dixon spoke in his queer little voice, carrying
small inflection. "I hold you two officers responsible for
Constable Preston's welfare. I have excellent reasons to believe
that his life has been attempted and that it will be attempted
again. Understand, Constable Preston is to be produced at the
court-house for Miss Poulton's trial, and I will accept no
excuses."</p>

<p>Dizzy Laine's name was not mentioned throughout the interview;
yet his personality was certainly in all three men's minds. Again
in their room upstairs, John Pater took up the whole question of
the Stanley Griffiths murder with Saul Murmer, freely admitting,
that in the conduct of the case he had made mistakes. In the very
plainest language he could command he informed the Englishman that
he had allowed prejudice to sway his thoughts and actions. He
insisted that personal animosity should be immediately set aside
and that some sort of peace should be established with Dizzy Laine,
with a view to discovering what evidence he held towards a solution
of what appeared to be an impenetrable mystery.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer met John Pater's direct attack with bland
imperturbability. He said little, sitting with his head against the
padded back of his window chair, blowing innumerable smoke rings
into the air. The Australian became almost excited with his rising
passions, striding angrily up and down the room. Finally he
declared that unless Saul Murmer fell in with his wishes he would
see Superintendent Dixon and insist on being relieved of his share
of the case.</p>

<p>For the first time Saul Murmer showed signs of
discomfort&mdash;it could not be called more. He admitted, somewhat
reluctantly, that the newspaper-man might know something of
importance, qualifying the admission by the statement that the
amateur criminologist could not possibly succeed against the
trained detective, backed by the culminative power and information
of a well-organised police department.</p>

<p>John Pater was prepared to accept this admission without the
qualification, and without comment. He realised that he had scored
an important point by obtaining Murmer's expressed willingness to
meet the newspaper-man in conference, and without provoking him to
a slanging match. He believed he had sufficient influence with
Dizzy to get him to agree to the meeting, and to discuss the case
in an amiable spirit.</p>

<p>He went to the telephone and rang up the <i>Post-Advertiser</i>
offices&mdash;to be told that Dizzy Laine was away on leave and
would not be at the newspaper offices for at least another
month.</p>

<p>"Thought so." Saul Murmer spoke in soft, contemplative tones.
"So Dizzy got the wind up when he found he couldn't bluff us.
'Fraid to stay in Sydney and witness his sweetheart in the dock,
facing certain conviction!"</p>

<p>John Pater checked the angry reply that rose to his lips. Now he
realised that a reconciliation between the two men was impossible,
until they had fought their native animosity to a standstill. If
Dizzy had gone away then it was better to allow events to order
themselves Yet some thought at the back of his mind told him that
when the girl came to trial Dizzy Laine would be there with a
defence that would scatter the prosecution like chaff before a high
wind.</p>

<p>During the next few days Inspector John Pater took occasion to
come in touch with several members of the <i>Post-Advertiser</i>
literary staff. Not one of them could amplify the information he
had previously received from the switch-girl. He learned that
Dizzy, immediately he left Superintendent Dixon's office had
returned to the <i>Post-Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour he had been in conference with Lloyd Sampson,
the managing editor. When he had come out to the reporters' room he
had locked his desk. To several of his friends he had stated that
he required a rest&mdash;and was taking his annual leave
immediately; that he'd be absent for a month, possible longer.</p>

<p>While Inspector John Pater was endeavouring to get some news of
Dizzy Laine and his probable activities, Inspector Murmer was busy
with the Crown Prosecutor's officials perfecting the case that he
had built up against the accused girl.</p>

<p>In due course, she was brought before the magistrate and,
reserving her defence on the advice of her counsel, Mark Runnell,
K.C., was committed for trial. This was set for an early date, at
the insistence of her legal advisers, although Inspector Murmer
fought hard for delay.</p>

<p>The defence counsel obtained from the magistrate severe censure
on Inspector Murmer for visiting the girl while in custody and
attempting to question her. Inspector Pater was in the magistrate's
court when Miss Poulton was charged. He listened to the
magistrate's comments on Inspector Murmer's actions with some
bewilderment. What had been in the Englishman's mind? Inspector
Murmer knew well that a prisoner, charged with a serious offence,
should not be questioned in private by the prosecution.</p>

<p>In England, however, where Saul Murmer had received his police
training, this regulation is far more strictly enforced than in
Australia. After an arrest no question on the case likely to
incriminate the accused could be asked.</p>

<p>Yet Murmer, in defiance of training and regulation had gone to
see the girl. What had he meant by this action? Confining his work
at police headquarters to the bare necessities of his position,
Inspector Pater devoted himself to an attempt it to trace Dizzy
Laine. He believed it that if he could get in touch with the
newspaper-man he could persuade him to a better understanding of
his own and Inspector Murmer's position. Possibly he might obtain
from him some clue that would make for new evidence in the girl's
favour. In that event, he determined to go to the Commissioner and
ask that the case against her be dropped.</p>

<p>Something of this he spoke of to Inspector Murmer in the privacy
of their room at police headquarters a few days before the case
against the girl was listed for hearing.</p>

<p>"Quite so! Quite so!" Inspector Murmer delayed his eternal
blowing of smoke rings to stare at the soldierly detective behind
the big desk. "John, I'm coming to have great hopes of you!"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;you don't think the Poulton girl will be
convicted?"</p>

<p>Pater stuttered his astonishment.</p>

<p>"I hope not."</p>

<p>"Then why go on with the case?" asked John Pater.</p>

<p>"I want the murderer of Stanley Griffiths."</p>

<p>"And you don't think Miss Poulton murdered him?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Angus said that he was shot to death. The evidence shows
that Miss Poulton was standing before him&mdash;in his arms, in
fact&mdash;when he was killed."</p>

<p>"Dr. Angus stated that if he had not been shot he might have
bled to death from the dagger wound in his neck."</p>

<p>"So he did." Inspector Murmer's eyes wandered upwards, following
an enticing looking smoke-ring. "So he did."</p>

<p>Exasperated, Inspector Pater left the room and did not return to
police headquarters again that day. The next day he was careful to
remain out of his office as much as possible.</p>

<p>The night before the trial he lay awake hour after hour,
pondering and wondering. He believed that during the next few days
he would learn much that was at present a mystery&mdash;much that
would be new and startling, possibly explaining many sides of Saul
Murmer's and Dizzy Laine's strange antagonism. He wondered how much
that was at present incomprehensible to him was plain to Inspector
Murmer.</p>

<p>Trials at the Central Criminal Court of any city of the world
are drear, drab-affairs, unrelieved of any wit and ingenuity,
invested with a pomposity that is shabbily tawdry and
unimpressive&mdash;except it when recorded in the daily Press
through the eyes of the reporters assigned to court-duty. Possibly
they invest the pageantry of justice with a fictitious
impressiveness to relieve their own utter boredom with the
proceedings. Mankind has to invest the actualities of workaday life
with illusive values, to withstand the boredom of civilisation.</p>

<p>In some such spirit Inspector Pater approached the Criminal
Court at Darlinghurst on the day Aggie Poulton was to answer for
the death of Stanley Griffiths. He knew the evidence by heart and I
had to admit that he did not entirely believe it.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater received his first shock of that day when he
approached the door of the court and saw Dizzy and the famous K.C.,
Mark Runnell, in deep conference. He recovered quickly from his
surprise and tried to slip into the court unobserved by the
journalist; but Dizzy turned quickly and nodded with apparent
friendliness.</p>

<p>The newspaper-man had taken a seat immediately behind counsel
for the defence. John Pater noted that next to the journalist sat a
tall girl with a mass of flaxen hair. The newspaper-man appeared to
be on the friendliest terms with her.</p>

<p>With the usual attempt at impressiveness, which is more often
than not farcical, His Honour Judge Bonnithorne entered the court
and took his seat on the Bench. Immediately, the prisoner was
brought into the dock, accompanied by a motherly-looking wardress,
who appeared to take great interest in her charge. Then followed
the long, and largely witless, selection of a jury. To the
Inspector's astonishment, the defence made no attempt to challenge
any of the men called. Apparently Mark Runnell was content with any
jury pleasing to the Crown. Following came the reading of the
indictment, and her reply "Not Guilty," uttered in a quiet, firm
voice.</p>

<p>Terence McCrae, K.C., one of the finest prosecuting counsel at
the New South Wales bar, led for the Crown, assisted by James
Tynon, a very successful junior counsel, appearing often in Crown
cases. With a final hitch to his gown and a searching hand
uplifted, feeling that his wig was still perched on his head,
McCrae, a short, round, chubby-faced, clean-shaven man of about
sixty years of age, opened his case. In brief, pointed sentences he
set out the main facts on which he relied for a conviction.</p>

<p>Speaking unemotionally, and without stress on any point, he
spoke for a little less than half an hour. When he sat down
Inspector Pater felt that he had been listening to a man dealing
with facts in which he had little faith. A minute's silence
followed, and then Inspector Murmer entered the witness box.</p>

<p>Very little that the English detective had to recount was new.
He told the of the finding of the deceased and the girl in the
house in Wonthaggi-avenue. He definitely identified the girl in the
dock as the girl who had locked him in the upstairs bedroom. Then
he went on to describe the various facts that pointed to the girl's
guilt that he had discovered during his investigations. He
identified the letters from Aggie Poulton to Stanley Griffiths,
stating that he had found them among the man's private
correspondence at his office, in Pitt-street.</p>

<p>In answer to Terence McCrae's questions, he described the points
of the alibi set up by the girl's friends, and the means he had
taken to investigate and disprove them. Immediately Terence McCrae
sat down, with a little nod to the defending counsel, Mark Runnell,
tall and gaunt, with hooked nose and fierce eyes, reminiscent of a
hawk, rose quickly. Disregarding most of the evidence the Inspector
had given, he said:</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer&mdash;during your inquiries you came in touch
with a girl named Alice Warren. I believe you caused her to be
examined at the Coroner's inquiry. May I ask for what reason?"</p>

<p>"I received information that Miss Warren was in the habit of
visiting Stanley Griffiths at early hours of the mornings."</p>

<p>"Just so. Her evidence in the Coroner's court did not shed any
light on the identity of the murderer of Stanley Griffiths?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Have you definitely established the relations between the dead
man and Miss Warren?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"I am to understand that after Miss Warren's evidence in the
Coroner's court you did not pursue inquiries in her direction any
further?"</p>

<p>"I came to the conclusion that Miss Warren was unwilling to give
any information she held. I found that my inquiries were leading me
in a different direction."</p>

<p>Mark Runnell nodded understandingly. For a moment he bent over
some papers on the desk before him, then looked up sharply.</p>

<p>"I believe, at one time your attention was directed to another
person&mdash;a Mr. Arthur Skields. Is that not so?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I questioned Mr. Arthur Skields and he established a
perfect alibi."</p>

<p>"A perfect alibi?" The thin lips compressed slightly and the
keen eyes narrowed, accentuating the hawk-like appearance of the
barrister's face. "I have always understood that the police look
with suspicion on the perfect alibi?"</p>

<p>"Not always, sir." Inspector Murmer's bland, innocent-looking
eyes met the K.C.'s with apparent frankness.</p>

<p>"Yet certain happenings tended to direct suspicion very strongly
in Mr. Skields' direction?"</p>

<p>"I presume your refer to the telephone message to the house in
Wonthaggi-avenue, during the morning after I discovered the
murdered man?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. I am given to understand that you posed as a certain
Dr. Bastion, in answering the call. You have, I believe,
information that Mr. Skields was&mdash;was at the other end of that
telephone connection?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Skields admitted that."</p>

<p>"You found correspondence from Mr. Skields to Mr. Griffiths, in
the latter's desk?"</p>

<p>"One letter, sir."</p>

<p>"And that of a threatening letter?"</p>

<p>"The letter contained a threat. On the face of the alibi that
Mr. Skields established, Inspector Pater and I had to come to the
conclusion that the letter was only a threat."</p>

<p>"Only a threat? What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Skields threatened the deceased. The evidence we obtained
showed that Mr. Skields was not in a position to carry out his
threat. When he threatened the man again, over the telephone line
to the supposed Dr. Bastion, he was not aware that Mr. Griffiths
was dead."</p>

<p>Mark Runnell nodded. "You found letters from other people
threatening Mr. Griffiths?"</p>

<p>"Many of them."</p>

<p>"I believe a&mdash;" Mark Runnell referred briefly to a paper on
the table&mdash;"a Miss Anstey drew your attention to a threatening
letter when you searched Mr. Griffiths offices in the city?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Inspector Murmer looked slightly astonished.</p>

<p>"From whom was that letter?"</p>

<p>"A Mr. George Martin."</p>

<p>"Did you investigate Mr. Martin's alibi?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Martin was with Mr. Arthur Skields at the time of the
murder." Inspector Murmer spoke carefully. "Messrs. Arthur and
Ernest Skields, and George Martin were playing cards in Mr. Ernest
Skields' flat at the time the murder was committed."</p>

<p>"All three of those gentlemen with 'perfect alibis,' Inspector?
I am correct in stating that Mr. Griffiths had a serious
disagreement with Mr. Ernest Skields in a city club."</p>

<p>"I have heard so, sir." Inspector Murmer was blandly
innocent.</p>

<p>"Then we have 'perfect alibis' for three men, all of whom held
grievances against the murdered man. Three 'perfect alibis' which
you have not troubled to investigate?"</p>

<p>"I investigated the alibi put forward by Mr. Arthur
Skields."</p>

<p>"Did you investigate the possibility of collusion between these
three men for the purpose of establishing these 'perfect alibis'
and killing Stanley Griffiths?"</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer did not answer.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">DIZZY LAINE, seated behind counsel for the
defence, watched rather than listened to the evidence given by the
English detective. Now and again he glanced towards the woman in
the dock, leaning forward on the bare wooden bench and following
the rapid exchange of question and answer with eyes that were
painful in their intensity. At times he leaned towards the
fair-headed girl beside him, to exchange a few words in a hurried
undertone. He had no fears for the result of the trial. It might
drag on for days&mdash;probably it would&mdash;a torture to the
pale-faced girl in the dock; but the result was inevitable.</p>

<p>A verdict of "not guilty" would be returned by a jury already
restless at the deliberate exposures revealed by the
cross-examination of Inspector Murmer.</p>

<p>Dizzy wondered. Why had the man forced this weak case against
the girl to trial? Even admitting that she had been in Stanley
Griffiths house and with him, at the time of his death; admitting
that she had stabbed him with the dagger ornament she had worn
either on coat or hat; admitting that such a wound had caused his
death, what had she to fear? She had struck, defending herself from
a licentious brute. No jury would convict in that case.</p>

<p>Again the question hammered in his brain: Why had Saul Murmer
forced to an issue in court the slight case against the girl? Why
had the noted man-hunter, of the famous New Scotland Yard Criminal
Investigation Department, not followed the trail of the man who had
fired the bullet into Stanley Griffiths back? There he had an
excellent opportunity for a murder charge. He had neglected it.
Why? Surely there he had the opportunity for making in Australia a
reputation equal to the one he had won in a London.</p>

<p>Dizzy wondered. Could he place personal animosity against
himself by the English detective as the cause for the persecution
of the girl? Again he had to admit the fact. Perhaps he had acted
unwisely in deliberately antagonising the man. Dizzy, however,
could not convince himself that such reasoning was correct. He
believed that Saul Murmer was playing some deeper, more subtle,
game.</p>

<p>He was mentally jerked back to his immediate surroundings by the
last question and answer of the cross-examination. He smiled as the
stout detective left the witness box. Yet Inspector Murmer did not
appear to mind the verbal chastisement the noted K.C. had given
him. A smile was creasing the round, full, bland face as he ambled
across the well of the court and took a seat on the bench beside
Inspector Pater. Yet Dizzy exulted.</p>

<p>The first point in the game for a life had been won; and it had
been won on the evidence of Inspector Murmer, the most dangerous
witness against the girl. Mark Runnell had diverted suspicion from
the girl, directing it against three men who were not charged. If
the K.C. could work in like manner on the other witnesses for the
prosecution the jury would return a verdict without leaving their
box: probably adding some rider that would effectually take the
conceit out of the Englishman.</p>

<p>Inspector John Pater followed his brother-Inspector in the
witness box. Dizzy leaned forward, whispering to Mark Runnell. The
K.C. noddled and smiled. Dizzy turned his attention to the witness.
John Pater appeared uncomfortable. He answered Terence McCrae's
questions in low, hesitating tones, entirely unlike his usual brisk
manner when under examination.</p>

<p>Mark Runnell refused to cross examine, asking leave to recall
the witness, if advisable, later in the proceedings.</p>

<p>The judge looked up in mild surprise and nodded. The surprise
deepened on the judicial countenance when Mark Runnell repeated his
request, after the examination in chief of Dr. Theodore Angus. The
medical man had done the defence no harm while under examination by
the Crown. He insisted that Stanley Griffiths had been killed by a
bullet wound. He admitted, under pressure, that the wound in the
neck might have caused death, if the blood stream had not been
checked within a short time, but insisted that the man was alive
when the bullet pierced his heart. The Crown leader, much annoyed
at the witness' insistence rather laboured the point, until
reminded by the judge that he was treating his own witness as
hostile.</p>

<p>Constable John Preston followed the medical man in the witness
box; Again Mark Runnell asked that cross-examination be deferred
until later in the trial. The Crown counsel objected, insisting
that the Crown witnesses be cross-examined at the conclusion of the
evidence in chief. After lengthy argument Judge Bonnithorne decided
in favour of the defence.</p>

<p>It was evident that he was viewing the Crown case with some
suspicion. Dizzy sighed with relief. Another point had been
scored&mdash;how great a point the prosecution did not yet
realise.</p>

<p>Slowly, and with apparent effort, the case for the Crown was
built up by a number of witnesses each adding some minute quota of
evidence, most of it only indirectly against the girl in the dock.
Yet, to his dismay, Dizzy had to acknowledge that there was a case
to answer.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer had been busy. Much of the evidence produced
was well-known to the newspaper-man, but it was evidence that he
had discounted&mdash;although he had taken occasion to fully advise
Mark Runnell of it, when the defence was being framed. A few
moments' reflection, and the cloud cleared from his brows. Already
he saw his prophecy being fulfilled&mdash;and Inspector Saul
Murmer, picking up his return ticket to London, ridiculed and
disgraced.</p>

<p>When the evidence of Austin Griffiths, cousin of the deceased,
concluded, the real fight commenced. Mark Runnell proffered his
usual request for the witness to stand aside for later cross
examination. Judge Bonnithorne demurred. He saw no reason why this
witness should not be finally disposed of. He was of little
consequence to the defence. Did Mr. Runnell wish to hear the whole
of the Crown evidence before he decided which witnesses he wished
to cross-examine?</p>

<p>"I am glad your Honour has raised this point." Mark Runnell
shrugged his falling gown well on to his shoulders, and almost with
the same gesture tilted his wig to a rakish angle on his head. "I
confidently assert that the Crown is only calling a number of these
witnesses with the object of placing obstacles in the way of the
defence. Your Honour will readily understand that if the defence
had called many of these witnesses and then submitted them to my
learned friend's cross-examination their evidence would assume an
entirely different aspect to the jury."</p>

<p>Again the K.C. shrugged, this time setting his wig almost
mathematically straight on his head while allowing his gown to
slide more than half way down his back. "I submit, with all
deference that the only real witnesses for the Crown are Inspectors
Murmer and Pater, and Dr. Angus. If you agree with me on that point
you will realise that the jury is being asked to convict this girl
for manslaughter on the sole evidence of Inspector Murmer,
supported by a bundle of letters, some of them undated, but
entirely uncorroborated by other evidence." Mark Runnell paused and
looked down at the counsel for the Crown. "I am going to ask you,
sir, to direct that the Crown calls evidence to show that the wound
in the neck caused the man's death. That, I submit, has not yet
been established."</p>

<p>The grave face of Judge Bonnithorne broke into a light
smile.</p>

<p>"Is that all, Mr. Runnell? I am afraid I cannot interfere with
the Crown case to that extent."</p>

<p>"I admit that," Mark Runnell commenced, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is my learned friend inferring that I am conducting the case
for the Crown incorrectly," asked Terence McCrae, rising to his
feet with an injured expression on his round, cheerful face.</p>

<p>"Perfectly incorrectly," asserted Mark Runnell smiling
sweetly.</p>

<p>"I submit that my learned friend should cross-examine the Crown
witnesses, if he wishes to do so, immediately after they I have
been examined-in-chief," continued Terence McCrae. "Of course, if
he has no questions to ask them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have quite a number of questions I desire to ask them," said
Mark Runnell, tartly. "As my learned friend has raised the point
that I do not know how to conduct the defence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. McCrae did not say that, Mr. Runnell," corrected Judge
Bonnithorne.</p>

<p>"I bow to your ruling, sir." Mark Runnell did so, sweepingly. "I
will cross-examine my learned friend's witnesses immediately."</p>

<p>A puzzled expression shadowed the judge's face for a moment.
Terence McCrae turned and looked at his junior counsel
bewilderedly. Before judge or counsel could interfere, Mark Runnell
spoke again, this time addressing the court usher.</p>

<p>"Recall Mrs. Mary Gordon for cross-examination, please."</p>

<p>Terence McCrae lumbered to his feet, bending to finish some
remark he was making to his junior. Immediately Mark Runnell
interposed.</p>

<p>"I really wish I knew what my learned friend wanted. He objected
to me asking that Crown witnesses be set back for cross examination
later. When I fall in with his wishes and commence their immediate
examination he starts to interfere again. Would he like my brief as
well as his own? Really, I should have some say in my own
case."</p>

<p>Counsel for the Crown sat down suddenly. Before he could recover
from this last onslaught Mark Runnel had turned to the witness.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Gordon. In your examination by my learned friend you
told of the daily life in Mr. Stanley Griffiths' household, where
you held the post of housekeeper. My learned friend questioned you
regarding certain visits paid to your late employer by Miss Alice
Warren, at very early hours of the morning. Did you know of these
visits?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did. I understood you to say that Miss Warren did not
visit the house during your hours of work."</p>

<p>"Alice told me of them."</p>

<p>"Then your knowledge is only what you were told by Miss Warren.
I suppose Mr. Griffiths did not inform you on the subject?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now, tell me, what did Miss Warren tell you
regarding these visits?"</p>

<p>"I object." Terence McCrae came to his feet. "My learned friend
should have obtained that information when Miss Warren was in the
witness box."</p>

<p>"What! Again?" Mark Runnell raised heavy brows. "Oh, well, as
you've evidently taken over the defence, as well as the
prosecution, I suppose I shall have to bow to your superior
knowledge." He turned to the witness. "Now, Mrs. Gordon, perhaps
you will tell my learned friend what relation you are to Miss Alice
Warren?"</p>

<p>"Her aunt, sir. Her mother was my sister."</p>

<p>"Her aunt! And&mdash;please be discreet, in answering this
question. Did my learned friend, or the detectives in charge of the
case, ever question you regarding your relationship to Miss
Warren?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Mark Runnell turned and looked down on Terence McCrae. "So
that is how the Crown authorities prepare a serious case; they
don't ask for real information, only for what suits their purposes.
Ah, well! Now, Mrs. Gordon, do you know a Mr. Disraeli Laine, of
the <i>Post-Advertiser</i> staff?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Laine, is it, sir? Yes, sir, as nice a gentleman as I've
ever met."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Gordon. You haven't said that regarding the
police officers who called on you for information, eh? Well, you
know Mr. Laine. Has he ever called on you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very recently?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And at one of his calls he asked you to bring to the court
today certain letters and documents that you showed him and which
you informed him belonged to the late Mrs. Warren?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you brought them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Mrs. Gordon indicated a fat parcel under her arm,
she had been hugging throughout the morning.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Please hand them to the court orderly."</p>

<p>"You are putting these documents in as evidence?" asked Terence
McCrae, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I may, presently." Mark Runnell raised his heavy brows. "At
present, I want them in the court's charge&mdash;safe from police
inquisition."</p>

<p>He turned to the witness.</p>

<p>"Of course, you have read those documents. Will you tell me who
they are from?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanley Griffiths, sir."</p>

<p>"Letters from Mr. Stanley Griffiths to the lady who lived under
the name of Mrs. Warren. I believe you informed Mr. Laine that your
sister handed those documents to you just before she died, to keep
in charge for her daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Mark Runnell turned and bowed profoundly to the
Crown counsel. "Your witness, Mr. McCrae."</p>

<p>"I should like to know what your intended to establish by your
cross-examination, Mr. Runnell?" asked Judge Bonnithorne,
mildly.</p>

<p>"A mere matter of completing evidence for my learned friend,
sir," Mark Runnell replied airily. "Your Honour will doubtless
remember that Mrs. Gordon's evidence was not directed towards
proving either the prisoner's guilt or innocence. She was merely
asked questions relating to Mr. Griffiths' household and regarding
Miss Alice Warren's visits to the dead man between the hours of
five and seven in the mornings."</p>

<p>Mark Runnell paused and folded his arms impressively.</p>

<p>"My learned friend has shown that he has no regard for the
characters of his witnesses. Had I cross-examined Miss Warren
immediately my learned friend concluded his examination in chief I
should have been perfectly correct in regarding her as a loose
woman&mdash;one of the many mistresses the dead man indulged in.
But, sir&mdash;" Mark Runnell's voice raised a tone. "My client
will be no party to the tactics displayed by the Crown. She will
have no scavenging of the gutters on her behalf. Miss Warren has
been deliberately defamed, her reputation besmirched, by the very
people who called her to their aid in their attack on my
client."</p>

<p>Again the K.C. paused, to turn and gaze with high indignation on
the Crown counsel seated close by. "I am instructed, sir, that Miss
Warren's character is to be cleared from the slurs cast upon it by
the Crown counsel. It was to that end I questioned Mrs. Gordon.
With your permission I now propose to call Miss Warren for
cross-examination."</p>

<p>The barrister turned towards the witness box: "Call Miss Alice
Warren."</p>

<p>For the short interval while the girl was escorted to the
witness box the crowded court sat expectant. Mark Runnell
lengthened the interval, knowing that he was raising expectations
of some sensation to come.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Warren," the barrister assumed a brisk, businesslike
air. "Mrs. Gordon has admitted that you are her niece. She admitted
that she possessed a number of letters and documents from Stanley
Griffiths to your mother. I ask you to tell the court what
relationship existed between you and the deceased man, Stanley
Griffiths?"</p>

<p>The girl did not answer.</p>

<p>"Shall I put the question in another form?" The K.C. spoke
gently. "I have been informed that you are Stanley Griffiths
daughter. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"He made me swear not to tell anyone," the girl answered, almost
sullenly.</p>

<p>"And you have obeyed him&mdash;in spite of the damage to your
good name your silence has occasioned?"</p>

<p>"I haven't told anyone." The girl looked distressed.</p>

<p>"Why did you visit him frequently between the hours of five and
seven in the mornings?"</p>

<p>"He made me." For a moment the girl hesitated; then burst out,
"I didn't want to&mdash;I hated him&mdash;He was a beast&mdash;a
beast&mdash;Oh, I hated him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you didn't kill him." There was a note of sadness in the
barrister's voice. "You visited him at those peculiar hours because
he commanded you to and you thought you had to obey your father."
Mark Runnell paused. "I am afraid my next question is going to
cause you some distress, but I have to ask it. Are you the
legitimate, or illegitimate daughter of the late Stanley
Griffiths?"</p>

<p>"If you mean, was he married to my mother, yes." The girl's
voice rose shrilly. "He was, and he deserted her, and ill-used
her&mdash;and me&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you your mother's marriage certificate?" interrupted Mark
Runnell, gently.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is this it?" The barrister handed, a document to the usher to
take to the witness box.</p>

<p>"Yes." Alice Warren looked bewildered. "Where&mdash;where did
you get it? I&mdash;we thought Mr. Griffiths had it. We searched
everywhere and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mark Runnell bent, whispering to Dizzy Laine. After a moment's
hesitation Dizzy nodded. The barrister straightened and turned to
the judge.</p>

<p>"I am instructed, sir, that this marriage certificate was in Mr.
Griffiths possession. He had hidden it in a secret compartment of
his desk which was overlooked in the police search. It was
discovered&mdash;and the discovery, I understand, places Miss
Warren in very comfortable financial circumstances&mdash;by a
member of the <i>Post Advertiser</i> staff who has taken a great
interest in this case."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">"GENTLEMEN of the jury!" Mark Runnell turned with
great impressiveness to the jury box. "That is the kind of evidence
the Crown&mdash;assisted by the so-called famous detectives engaged
on this case&mdash;present to you as evidence against the accused.
Have you noted that not one word of Mrs. Gordon's
evidence&mdash;not one word of Miss Warren's&mdash;I should say,
Miss Griffiths&mdash;evidence bears in any possible way toward
throwing light on the death of the murdered man or the identity of
his slayer? In no manner can it be regarded as evidence against the
accused, my client. Is it necessary for me to indicate what sort of
evidence this is? If so, then I have no hesitation in naming it
mere mud-slinging, in the hope that by examining witnesses under
oath&mdash;by the raking of legal gutters, something might
eventuate that can be fastened on the accused to her detriment.</p>

<p>"Yet, gentlemen, what has the Crown established? Apparently,
much against the prosecution's will, it has given me the privilege
of righting a great wrong. Stanley Griffiths married a
girl&mdash;and deserted her, in his inordinate sex lusts. He
deserted his daughter, left her to take a position as maid in a
neighbour's household, although he has been proved to be a wealthy
man. He forced her to visit him, in circumstances that besmirched
her public honour."</p>

<p>"Are you making the speech for the defence?" asked Terence
McCrae, sarcastically, half-rising from his seat. "If
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No sir," thundered Mark Runnell. "I am trying to defend the
honour of a young girl foully slurred by the Crown and this
wonderful English detective from New Scotland Yard&mdash;who
presumes to come here and teach good Australians a business in
which he is proved to be a mere amateur. And you, sir; you complain
because I did not cross-examine your witnesses immediately and to
suit your under-handed purposes. You put a young and innocent girl
in the witness box, attempting to prove her&mdash;heaven knows for
what purposes of the prosecution&mdash;the mistress of the dead
man. Possibly you thought I should follow the example you set and
tear from her any remnants of respectability you had left
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you not rather over-stating the-position Mr. Runnell?"
asked Judge Bonnithorne, mildly.</p>

<p>"If I have I humbly ask pardon." Mark Runnell bowed eloquently.
"I fear my indignation at the indignity to which Miss Warren was
submitted by my learned friend. But there! From evil has come good!
Allow me to again return to my learned friend's&mdash;No, no, I
cannot call it a case! Shall I say, a procession of witnesses with
nothing pertinent to the case to recount. The next? Constable John
Preston. Please call Constable John Preston!"</p>

<p>Dizzy smiled as the constable, much bewildered and with a
distinct uneasiness that his beloved police department was to be
unjustly attacked, entered the witness box.</p>

<p>Mark Runnell treated him benevolently. With the constable's
report written in the Edgecliff hotel in his hand, he led the man
through the incidents of his patrol on the night of the murder.
Again and again Terence McCrae tried to interfere, pleading that
the witness was being led in the questioning; but, by this time,
judge and jury were thoroughly intrigued and determined that the
defence should have every possible liberty.</p>

<p>Dizzy followed the questioning closely for some time, then
allowed his eyes to wander about the court. He noted that the
persons required for the final exposure of Inspector Saul Murmer
were in the court room, then glanced at the man, and almost gasped
his astonishment. Instead of scowls and uneasy shiftings on his
hard seat, Saul Murmer was lounging at ease&mdash;smiling. Dizzy
stared. Yes, the Englishman was thoroughly at ease. It was
Inspector John Pater, seated beside his confrère, who wore the
worried look, who looked in his expression that out of the mouths
of the Crown witnesses the case which the police had laboriously
built up was being ruthlessly shattered!</p>

<p>Why? For once in his life the newspaper-man was hopelessly
puzzled. He knew that he had worked out a fool-proof case for the
defence, that in a few hours Aggie Poulton would be free, and that
without even the indignity of a verdict of any sort being returned
by the jury. He knew that, long before Mark Runnell had finished
with the Crown witnesses, without calling one witness for the
defence&mdash;either judge or jury would stop the proceedings.
Aggie would be released with many apologies; to go out, into her
world a declared victim of misplaced police zeal. Then, there would
be only one question to answer. Who had killed Stanley
Griffiths&mdash;and he was prepared to answer that question
fully.</p>

<p>"Think again, Constable Preston." Mark Runnell's voice was soft
and persuasive. "Let me give you a guide. You have stated that when
you came to the corner of Pantheon-street and Wonthaggi-avenue you
heard loud singing. You turned the corner and saw two drunken men.
They were in evening dress. I suppose they wore hats? Yes. Not too
straight on their heads? No, I thought not. Oh, their hats were
worn at opposite sides of their heads. So, you noticed that. It was
funny, yes! The crowns of the hats inclined one to the other. Good,
constable, you have a marvellous memory! Now, tell me of the man
who saluted you mockingly. Oh, the mole was farther down, towards
the jaw-bone. Good, constable, we're getting along famously. You're
one of the best witnesses I've ever had under cross-examination.
Looked like an old cut. Good. Very good. Did you notice his hair?
Look about the court, constable. Hair is awkward to describe, but
here we have quite a representative collection. Glance at the
judge&mdash;no, that won't do, his wig covers all his hair. What
about mine? Perhaps my learned friend will remove his wig for your
examination of his hair&mdash;but to my memory he hasn't much left;
he scratched it all away trying to make cases out of impossible
police evidence. Well, we'll take the jury now. Any head of hair
among them like that of the man in Wonthaggi-avenue. No? Well, try
the general public. Ah!"</p>

<p>Constable Preston's eyes had rested on a man in the public
potions of the court. Dizzy swung round, quickly, trying to
identify the person the constable was gazing at. Almost
involuntarily, he noticed that Inspector Murmer was not in his
seat. He was ambling quickly into the space reserved for the
public. John Pater was seated alone, lost in his troubled
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Why!" The constable's powerful voice rang through the
courtroom. "That's one of the men hisself&mdash;and there's his pal
alongside him. Eh, stop him!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden commotion at the back of the court. Inspector
Pater was now on his feet, running to the back of the court pushing
his way through the excited spectators. Suddenly a space cleared
and Dizzy, standing on his seat, could see Inspector Murmer
kneeling on the back of a man and with his arms locked about
another. A moment later John Pater arrived to his assistance.
Constables gathered round them.</p>

<p>The brief, quiet orders of the judge, directing the actions of
the court orderlies, quickly restored order, and the two men seized
by Inspectors Murmer and Pater were brought into the well of the
court. With surprise Dizzy noted that they were both
handcuffed.</p>

<p>"These proceedings are most disgraceful," commenced, Judge
Bonnithorne in his gentle, low voice. "I am afraid I shall have to
deal with these men most severely."</p>

<p>"If you will allow me to explain&mdash;or rather permit the
witness to go on with his evidence," suggested Mark Runnell,
looking very pleased. He turned to Constable Preston. "You know
these men?"</p>

<p>"Sure! They're two drunks, I saw in Wonthaggi-Avenue that
night," said the constable explosively. "I'd know them
anywhere."</p>

<p>"I should like you to be a little more explicit," suggested the
Judge.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if I mention the names of the
two&mdash;er&mdash;disturbers," said Mark Runnell urbanely.
"Messrs. Ernest Skields and George Martin. You will remember Mr.
Arthur Skields, a witness for the Crown and the owner of the
'perfect alibi.' These are the gentlemen he referred Inspector
Murmer to for his 'perfect alibi.'"</p>

<p>Judge Bonnithorne looked round the court for Arthur Skields. He
was standing behind the two men, and by him stood Inspector
Pater.</p>

<p>"I ask that these three men be held in court," said Mark
Runnell, after a short pause.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Judge Bonnithorne nodded. "I instruct that they be
detained within the precincts of the court. I shall certainly deal
with them when I have time to give the matter thought."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Arthur Skields would like to go into the witness
box for his cross-examination," suggested the K.C. For a moment the
man hesitated, then caught Dizzy's eyes. The newspaper-man nodded
emphatically.</p>

<p>"I've nothing to fear," he announced. "My story is straight. You
can't get over it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there are a few details you have forgotten to mention,"
said counsel for the defence blandly.</p>

<p>Under Mark Runnell's gentle handling, Arthur Skields re-told the
story of his alibi. He, his brother and George Martin had dined
together that evening. Then they had gone to Ernest' Skields' flat,
to play cards. He had not been out of the flat that night until he
left it with George Martin to go home.</p>

<p>"You had a few drinks during the evening?" suggested the
barrister.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Three or four?"</p>

<p>"I daresay more than that. In fact&mdash;" Skields spoke in a
sudden burst of frankness. "Fact, I got a bit blotto. Had to lie
down for a time."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the house porter coming to the room with a
message?"</p>

<p>"Why? How do you know that?" Arthur Skields started, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have seen the house porter," said Mark Runnell,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Well he did, anyway. I was almost out then; just on the edge of
sleep."</p>

<p>"And you did go to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Ern told me I slept for half an hour."</p>

<p>"Your brother and your friend remained in the room while you
slept?"</p>

<p>Sudden suspicion came in the man's eyes. He hesitated, then
answered confidently. "They were playing cards when I awoke. I
looked at the clock, when they chaffed me about falling asleep, and
knew that I had slept for half an hour."</p>

<p>"Then you took a hand at cards?"</p>

<p>"We played for some time. I wasn't feeling any too fit, but I
didn't like to break up the party."</p>

<p>"You went to sleep about a quarter to eleven?"</p>

<p>"About that time."</p>

<p>"And it was about a quarter past eleven when you looked at the
clock?"</p>

<p>"It was twenty minutes past eleven."</p>

<p>"Then the three of you played on until nearly two o'clock? Mr.
George Martin drove you home. Did you notice the time when you got
to your rooms?"</p>

<p>"It was just after three o'clock."</p>

<p>"And you thought that your clock was fast?"</p>

<p>"Say, you know a lot." Again suspicion flashed in the man's
eyes. "But you can't get over my alibi. I was awake and playing
cards with my brother and Martin at midnight&mdash;and it was at
midnight that Stanley Griffiths was killed."</p>

<p>"I am not attacking your alibi." Mark Runnell spoke, shortly.
"You will acknowledge that your brother and George Martin could
have left the room while you slept?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. But I was awake at twenty minutes past eleven;
and they were there then. They might have gone out while I was
asleep, but they had nothing to do with the killing of Stanley
Griffiths. We three were together, and I was awake, from twenty
minutes past eleven until Martin and I left Ern's place. That's a
fact!"</p>

<p>Mark Runnell paused a moment, then looked up. "What happened
when you got back to your rooms?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you find that it was much later than you
expected&mdash;say an hour later?"</p>

<p>Arthur Skields frowned. "I did think it was much later than I
expected, and I pulled out my watch to check the clock time."</p>

<p>"And you found that your watch had stopped?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You then set your watch by the clock, presuming it to be
correct?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the next day found that your watch and clock were
right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you visit your brother's flat that day?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They hauled me off to the police station for a lot of fool
questioning. After they let me go I went to my brother's flat."</p>

<p>"And there you found that your brother's clock was
right&mdash;then?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;yes." Skields continued more firmly. "I
happened to tell my brother that my watch had stopped the previous
night, and pulled it out to see if it was still going. He compared
his watch with mine, and we both looked at the clock in the room.
All three agreed as to the time."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"Glad you are satisfied&mdash;now." Skields' oddly-matched eyes
gleamed coldly on the barrister. "But I'm hanged if I know what
you're trying to get at."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you presently," Mark Runnell smiled. "I will now
cross examine Dr. Theodore Angus."</p>

<p>Terence McCrae and his junior were deep in conference. For a
moment the defence counsel watched them, then turned to the medical
man in the witness box.</p>

<p>"Dr. Angus, you have stated that you accompanied the police to
Mr. Griffiths house in Wonthaggi-avenue, and viewed the body. Will
you state at what time, in your opinion, the deceased was
killed?"</p>

<p>"Between half-past eleven and half-past twelve at night."</p>

<p>"You cannot define it closer?"</p>

<p>"I can, if you will accept a statement of what Inspector Murmer
told me. He said that he entered the house at midnight, and found
the man dead. I am confident Mr. Griffiths was not killed before
half-past eleven; therefore in that manner I can state that the man
was killed between half past eleven and midnight."</p>

<p>"If you please," Terence McCrae rose slowly to his feet. "I ask
that this case be adjourned to permit me to obtain further
instructions from the Public Prosecutor's office."</p>

<p>"I object." Mark Runnell faced the judge, angrily. "I can
provide my learned friend with all the information and instruction
he requires in this case. I am prepared to continue and to prove
that my client is entirely innocent. More, I am prepared to
indicate in no uncertain terms who killed Stanley Griffiths."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">WITHOUT waiting for the judge's assent, Mark
Runnell spoke again. "Please call Sergeant Benjamin Russell."</p>

<p>As the burly Sergeant entered the witness box the barrister
faced the judge. "I am asking your indulgence, sir." Mark Runnell
tried to suppress all trace of excitement from his voice. "I am
aware that this witness has not been examined by the Crown. If you
wish, I will give place and allow my learned friend to question
him."</p>

<p>Terence McCrae made a quick gesture of negation.</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea of what evidence Sergeant Russell
can offer," he admitted.</p>

<p>"I think you had better continue, Mr. Runnell," remarked Judge
Bonnithorne. "You appear to have an excellent knowledge of the
details of this case."</p>

<p>"I thank you." Mark Runnell bowed. "Now, Sergeant, you went to
the house in Wonthaggi-avenue with Dr. Angus on the night that
Stanley Griffiths was killed?"</p>

<p>"I was in charge of the detail from police headquarters, sir.
Dr. Angus accompanied me."</p>

<p>"You were attending Dr. Angus when he examined the dead
man?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"You were with him until he completed his examination, and left
the house?"</p>

<p>"I was, sir; all the time."</p>

<p>"You saw Dr. Angus extract this&mdash;" Mark Runnell picked up
the dagger ornament from the table and held it out to the witness,
"&mdash;from the dead man's neck?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you examined it since then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir!"</p>

<p>"Have a look at it now."</p>

<p>The K.C. took the article to the witness and gave it to the
Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Do you notice anything strange about that article?"</p>

<p>"Not particular, sir. It's stained with blood."</p>

<p>"Look at the blood stains. Do you see a fingerprint there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The Sergeant spoke doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Look closely. Turn the article over. There is a fingerprint on
the other side, is there not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Are they not the marks of your first finger and thumb,
Sergeant?" The man stared at the barrister, startled.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Then, look at these." Mark Runnell handed the witness a card.
"You recognise that card and the conditions under which you made
those prints?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I gave that to Mr. Dizzy Laine some little while
ago."</p>

<p>"Very good. Now take that card and compare the prints with those
on the dagger ornament."</p>

<p>"They look alike, sir." The Sergeant spoke after a prolonged
examination.</p>

<p>"They are yours." The barrister spoke emphatically. "Now, tell
me, how did those fingerprints get on that article?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know."</p>

<p>"Think, man." The barrister spoke quietly. "That dagger was in
Stanley Griffiths neck. Dr. Angus took it out, covered with blood.
There could be no fingermarks on it then. How did those marks come
there?"</p>

<p>Sudden enlightenment dawned on the Sergeant's face. He coloured
redly.</p>

<p>"'Fraid they're mine, sir. Now I remember. When Dr. Angus gave
it to me it was bent. I think&mdash;I think I straightened it
before I placed it on the table beside his instruments."</p>

<p>"You think so!" Mark Runnell laughed. "I am sure you did; the
ornament tells me that. Thank you, Sergeant. I have finished with
you. Perhaps my learned friend has some questions he would like to
ask."</p>

<p>Terence McCrae shook his head, emphatically.</p>

<p>"Then I will ask Dr. Angus to again enter the witness box." The
K.C. waited until the medical man had taken his place.</p>

<p>"Dr. Angus, do you remember removing this ornament from Stanley
Griffiths neck?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Did you then note whether it was bent or not?"</p>

<p>"I really couldn't say."</p>

<p>"You notice now that it has been bent and straightened. Did you
bend it while withdrawing it from the wound?"</p>

<p>"No, I am certain I did not. It came out quite easily."</p>

<p>"Then, it is possible to presume that when it was thrust into
the man's neck it struck some bone or muscle that bent it?"</p>

<p>"That is quite possible. I took little notice of the wound in
the man's neck. No autopsy was performed on the dead man, so I
cannot say in what position the dagger rested in the wound. I gave
a certificate that the man died from a gun-shot wound."</p>

<p>"You did not take the dagger wound into any account?" Mark
Runnell paused. "You know that the police did so? Do you understand
why?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not. I insisted that the man was shot, and that the
shot alone killed him. I have stated that in this court, I stated
it at the inquest, and to the police and others who have questioned
me on the matter. The stab in the neck was not, in my opinion
dangerous. Still, if neglected and an artery had been severed, the
man might have bled to death. But there was little blood in the
room. That indicated to me that he was killed instantly when the
bullet pierced his heart."</p>

<p>"Then you are prepared to swear that Stanley Griffiths was
<i>not</i> killed by a stroke from this dagger ornament?"</p>

<p>"Emphatically so. I have certified that the man was killed by a
bullet wound. I swear to that!"</p>

<p>Judge Bonnithorne dropped his pen on his desk. "I really cannot
see how this case can go on," he said, tiredly. "We have listened
to a lot of evidence that is entirely irrelevant and which has no
possible bearing on Miss Poulton's position in the court. I think,
gentleman of the jury&mdash;"</p>

<p>The foreman of the jury rose quickly to his feet. "We don't see
the use of going on, sir," he said. "I don't know whether you want
us to bring in a verdict."</p>

<p>"I don't." For the first time there was a sharpness in the
judge's tones. "I am going to discharge the prisoner. I am going to
tell her to walk out of that dock and that she should never have
been placed there; and for my part in this farce&mdash;yes,
farce&mdash;I tender her my fullest apologies."</p>

<p>He paused, then continued. "I am not going to comment here on
the police actions in this case, though I shall certainly have
something to say on the matter at another time and another place.
Regarding the two men&mdash;" He bent and referred to his notes
"&mdash;the two men, Ernest Skields and George Martin, I order that
they be detained in custody while proper inquiries are made into
their actions on the night that Stanley Griffiths was killed. I
have certain suspicions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help the police in that direction." Mark Runnell,
triumphant and extremely hawk-like in appearance, spoke quickly.
"If the police will take their fingerprints and compare them with
the fingerprints on the revolver Inspectors Murmer and Pater found
in the Wonthaggi-avenue house, they will likely get evidence of
value."</p>

<p>The barrister paused, cleared his throat, and continued.</p>

<p>"May I briefly recount the crime, as the defence has pieced it
together. Ernest Skields and George Martin determined to call
Stanley Griffiths to account over some shady business transactions
in which all three were concerned and in which the dead man had
deliberately defrauded his associates. They decided to take certain
actions which were&mdash;shall we say&mdash;outside the law. I do
not for one moment believe they went out that night with the intent
to commit murder.</p>

<p>"It happened that on that night Stanley Griffiths spent the
evening with Miss Poulton. After supper he persuaded her to return
with him to the Wonthaggi-avenue house&mdash;she tells me that he
promised to return to her there certain letters of hers which she
had written him and which she desired to have back.</p>

<p>"While Miss Poulton was there Stanley Griffiths tried to take
advantage of her. It was at the moment when she was struggling in
his arms, half-mad with terror and fighting blindly with any weapon
that came to her, that Skields and Martin entered the house through
the dining-room window, which they had found open. They heard the
struggling upstairs and went to investigate. They arrived at the
moment when Miss Poulton had struck blindly at Griffiths with the
only article in the shape of a weapon to her hand."</p>

<p>Again Mark Runnell paused, to continue.</p>

<p>"It may appear strange, in view of George Martin's reputed shady
business dealings, to know that he is considered a strictly moral
man. He became enraged at the sight of the girl fighting for her
honour against this man of evil repute. He had brought with him a
revolver, with some idea in his mind of forcing Griffiths to part
with his ill-gotten gains. He was wearing gloves, so his
fingerprints did not show on the weapon. In his disgust and rage,
he fired wildly at the ravisher, to see him drop dead at the girl's
feet. Panic-stricken at his deed, he turned and fled down the
stairs followed by his companion, Ernest Skields. Automatically,
they turned to leave the house, by the means they had entered
it&mdash;through the dining-room windows. In the dining-room
Skields realised that his companion was still carrying the
revolver. He wrenched it from him and threw it away. They then
escaped to the road. For some reason they turned up towards
Pantheon-street, instead of turning down to Edgecliff-road. Almost
at the corner they realised they were approaching the patrolman on
his beat, and assumed to be drunk. Constable Preston, with no
knowledge of the tragedy, allowed them to proceed, first warning
them to make less noise."</p>

<p>The barrister sat down abruptly. Dizzy Laine leaned forward and
whispered a few words.</p>

<p>"There is one other point, sir." Mark Runnell rose, staying the
judge who was making his way to his private door leading from the
court. "It may help police investigations if I mention briefly Miss
Poulton's part in the tragedy. She had struck at Stanley Griffiths
blindly. She wounded him and he suddenly released her. She fell,
half-fainting, on the couch. Dimly she heard the shot and saw the
man lurch towards her. She thrust him from her and he fell to the
floor. Then she saw the blood on the floor by him. Frantic with
terror, she rushed out of the room, speeding down the stairs to the
front door. As she opened it she heard steps on the pavement. For a
moment she hid behind the half-opened door, and saw Inspector
Murmer push open the gate and enter the garden. Afraid to close the
door, she turned and fled upstairs. She heard the detective enter
the house and, fearful of discovery and being accused of the crime,
pulled the couch forward to conceal the dead man. There Inspector
Murmer discovered her. In desperation she lured him to one of the
bedrooms and turned the key on him. We know the rest."</p>

<p>With a slight bow, completely exhausted, Mark Runnell sank into
his chair.</p>

<p>In excited confusion, the court slowly cleared, voices rising in
loud comment over the dramatic events of the trial. Dizzy and the
tall, fair girl stood together behind the counsel's table, talking
in low tones. Suddenly Inspector Murmer left the little group of
police and ambled to where the newspaper-man was standing.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Dizzy Laine, journalist!" A little twinkle was
shining in his baby-blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, Inspector Saul Murmer, of New Scotland Yard, London!"
retorted the newspaper-man.</p>

<p>"Please!" A soft voice spoke from beside the two men. "Please
won't you two men be friendly. You've had your fight and&mdash;"
Saul Murmer glanced at the girl, to stare in open-mouthed
wonderment.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" He turned to stared towards the dock. "What's
this!"</p>

<p>The dark-haired girl beside Dizzy Laine swung aloft a mass of
fair curls.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dizzy made me put this on today&mdash;and it was fearfully
hot. But we didn't want you to&mdash;to get confused." She laughed
gaily. "Oh, yes, I understand! My cousin, Agatha and I are
considered very much alike. I told you the truth when I said I
didn't know Mr. Stanley Griffiths, in Sauber's Restaurant. I
didn't, but my cousin Agatha did."</p>

<p>"Why, you girls are exactly alike!" Saul Murmer stuttered in his
astonishment. "I never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no we're not!" Adelaide Poulton spoke quickly. "There are
really quite a number of differences&mdash;but men don't, or can't,
see them. A girl would, of course. Dizzy says he can't see them,
even when I point them out to him&mdash;and he says that he hopes
we&mdash;that is Aggie and I&mdash;won't get mixed up on our
wedding day&mdash;But, you see&mdash;" She looked towards a couple,
one of them a girl strangely like herself, standing nearer the
dock. Inspector Saul Murmer glanced in the direction in which
Adelaide Poulton was looking. He recognised the couple&mdash;Agatha
Poulton and Arthur Skields.</p>

<p>"So?" Inspector Murmer's broad face widened into a grin. "So,
that's it!"'</p>

<p>"Yes." Adelaide Poulton nodded. "They're going to get married
tomorrow and&mdash;and they're going to England and&mdash;and I
don't think they'll ever come back here to Australia."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Saul Murmer turned to the newspaper-man. "Suppose
I'll have to see about that return ticket to London, as you
prophesied some days ago. You did put it all over me, as you said
you would, Mr. Dizzy Laine; but I ain't bearing malice."</p>

<p>"Of course not!" Dizzy's ugly face broke into a grin. "You see,
you're not a Londoner. Pater told me that. He said you were born
near Gretna Green&mdash;Unfortunately, there isn't one in
Australia&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut! Tut!" The stout detective shook with suppressed mirth.
"Sure you find your marriage laws here accommodating
enough&mdash;you should, from what I've heard in the divorce
courts. Besides, you fought hard for your little lady. Oh, damn.
Excuse me, miss. If I stay here I'll get all mixed up over you two
girls again."</p>

<p>With a hard hand-grip he left Dizzy and Adelaide and ambled to
the door, where Inspector Pater was awaiting him. As they left the
court-room the Australian detective spoke: "You're a damned ass,
Saul! I've never seen such a mess! How we'll get out of
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, John," Saul Murmer's hand was groping in his
jacket pocket for the inevitable cigarette. "Dizzy Laine, and his
<i>Post-Advertiser</i> will see us through. Anyway, you can't get
over one fact, we've got our men!"</p>

<p>"Or, rather Dizzy got them for us," added Inspector Pater,
determined for once to have the last word with his English
companion.</p>
