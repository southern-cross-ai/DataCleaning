  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  on the rocks this time, Leah, smashin&rsquo; for all we&rsquo;re worth. How we can win  clear beats me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  hands which had never earned a shilling thrust into pockets empty even of that  coin, Jim Kaimes stretched out his long legs and surveyed his neat boots as he  made this cryptic speech. His habit of expressing himself in a parabolic  fashion was confusing to his friends. But five years of marital squabbling had  schooled his wife into ready comprehension, and she usually responded without  comment. On this occasion, however, the subject under discussion irritated even  her healthy nerves, and she replied irrelevantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really,  Jim, I wish you would talk English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!  Never knew I was talking Choctaw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might be, for all the sense an ordinary person can make of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah-a-a!&rdquo;  said Jim, with the clumsy affection of a bear; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re not an ordinary  person, Leah. I&rsquo;m the common or garden ass, that can&rsquo;t straighten things. Now  you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  want of a husband I suppose I must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now, Leah. Am I not your husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes!&rdquo; she answered, with a flick of her handkerchief across a pair of scornful  lips: &ldquo;<i>my</i> husband, not <i>a</i> husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the difference?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if I could waste time in explaining. We have more serious matters to talk about  than your want of brains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Serious  enough,&rdquo; assented the man, sulkily; &ldquo;but you know how to deal with trouble,  Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ought to,&rdquo; retorted his wife, with a shrug, &ldquo;considering the experience I have  had since marrying you. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I,&rdquo; confessed Jim; then mended his speech with a dim sense of having  overstepped the mark: &ldquo;No, by Jupiter, I don&rsquo;t mean that. You an&rsquo; I get on very  well, considerin&rsquo; each swings on a private hook. You are not a bad sort, Leah,  and I&rsquo;m a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;well, you know what I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a diplomatist, certainly. Isn&rsquo;t this praise a trifle obvious? You don&rsquo;t mean  it, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked at him wistfully, but her candid husband soon stopped any sentimental  illusions she may have momentarily entertained. &ldquo;Oh yes, I mean it in a sort of  way. An&rsquo; good temper on both sides will help us to push through the business  quicker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean the Bankruptcy Court,&rdquo; snapped his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I mean the Divorce Court,&rdquo; was his tart reply, but she was quite ready with an  answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  your own part, then; you can&rsquo;t say a word against me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  said I could? You&rsquo;ve got the one virtue that gives its name to the rest, and  think yourself an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had your assurance that I was an angel&mdash;once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt. It&rsquo;s the sort of thing a man has to say to the woman he is engaged to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  never says to the woman he is married to!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marriage  isn&rsquo;t all honey, Leah, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo;  Lady Jim addressed the ceiling; &ldquo;as if I required telling. But compared with  other women, Jim, I am not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said you were,&rdquo; interrupted Kaimes, crossly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d screw your neck if you  went on like other women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  my word, Jim, I would admire you more if you did attempt something of that  sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry  I can&rsquo;t oblige you; but I&rsquo;m a gentleman and bear an honoured name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  honoured name!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sneerin&rsquo;  won&rsquo;t alter facts, Leah. The name of Kaimes has always been honoured&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till  you dragged it through the mud,&rdquo; interrupted Leah, in her turn. &ldquo;The old Duke  is all right, and Frith&rsquo;s a kind man, if somewhat dull. But you&mdash;oh heavens! to  think that such a Saul should be amongst the prophets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim,  not understanding the scriptural allusion, thought he was being chaffed, a  liberty which his bovine pride resented by two minutes of sulky silence.  Moreover, he dreaded his wife&rsquo;s formidable tongue, the lash of which could cut  through even his tough hide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are we goin&rsquo; to get through the business at this rate?&rdquo; was his next  contribution to the conversation. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember that I&rsquo;ve to meet a  fellow at the club to see about a bet. An&rsquo; I haven&rsquo;t got one shillin&rsquo; to rattle  against another,&rdquo; declared Jim, pathetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  was the sharp reply, &ldquo;I have to shop this afternoon with but one miserable  sovereign in my purse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  Jim opened his sleepy blue eyes. &ldquo;I say, you couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said his wife, decisively. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t and I wouldn&rsquo;t, and I can&rsquo;t and I shan&rsquo;t.  Perhaps you&rsquo;ll read the paper and let me think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Kaimes, reaching for the <i>Sporting Times</i>. &ldquo;I want to see the  bettin&rsquo; on Podaskas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betting  will be your ruin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  been,&rdquo; corrected Jim, chuckling; then reverted to his early metaphor: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on  the rocks this time, Leah, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  wife cast a look of scorn on the pink-and-white face she had once thought  handsome. And, indeed, Kaimes was good-looking in a heavy Saxon way. Tall and  muscular, with the strength of a bull and the manners of a bear, he was  precisely the sort of brutal athlete to attract women. They flocked round him  like bees, and gave him more honey than was good for him. He accepted their  endearments with the complacent vanity of an egotist, and took little trouble  to please even the prettiest, whereupon he was adored the more.</p>
  <p>Leah,  with her elbows on the breakfast-table, stared at Jim&rsquo;s well-brushed head  bending over the pink sheets, and asked herself, for the hundredth time, why  she had married him. Physically he resembled a splendid Hercules, but in  another sense the likeness was not a speaking one. He satisfied her eyes, and  in no other way gave her pleasure. When he talked, he babbled vainly about  himself and his doings, to the exclusion of any topic likely to interest other  people. Possessed of that easy good-nature which refuses nothing, which costs  nothing, Jim Kaimes was looked upon as &ldquo;a good fellow,&rdquo; a title which covers a  multitude of the minor sins. Jim would have been meritorious as a cave-man, and  pre-historically perfect. As a civilised being he left very much to be desired.</p>
  <p>The  subject was neither agreeable nor inexhaustible, and Leah rose with a shrug of  her shapely shoulders. Jim looked up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  he asked encouragingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;  said his wife, curtly, and moved to the window.</p>
  <p>Here  she leaned against the sash and looked at the narrow grey street which was such  a good address to impress tradesmen, and so expensive to live in. Not that the  question of rent troubled the pair. They paid none, and would have been as much  insulted, if visited on quarter-day, as an Irish tenant. The Duke of Pentland  at the time of their marriage had presented them with the furnished &ldquo;10, Curzon  Street,&rdquo; but hampered with certain restrictions. They could not sell it, or  even mortgage it, nor could money be raised on the furniture. The Duke paid all  rates and taxes, and saw to all repairs. Beyond dwelling in this very desirable  residence, and calling it publicly their home, Lord and Lady Jim had no  interest in it whatsoever. Both thought it was ridiculous that they could not  turn the Curzon Street house into money, when they needed ready cash so badly.</p>
  <p>And  life was so hard to people of their standing and tastes. Leah came of a  bankrupt family, and had brought nothing to Jim but her own clever, beautiful  self. She considered the two thousand a year which the Duke allowed his second  son opulence, until she learned what delightful things money could buy. Then  Jim used a large amount of the quarterly payments on his own account, and  tradesmen would not give her the delightful things without money. She certainly  had bills in nearly every shop in Bond Street and out of it, but even bills had  to be paid in the long run. The post brought a good many, and brought also  lawyers&rsquo; letters, not pleasant to read. Between them, this happy pair had  mortgaged their income, and the money they had obtained was all gone. Now they  had no income and many bills. What was to be done? This problem Jim had set  Leah to solve, but clever as she knew herself to be, the solution was beyond  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you borrow, Jim?&rdquo; she asked, turning gloomily from the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  a fiver,&rdquo; was the prompt response; &ldquo;every one&rsquo;s as mean as mean. I&rsquo;ve tried &lsquo;em  all. And you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty  pounds, for all my asking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  your godmother, old Lady Canvey,&rdquo; suggested Jim. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s as rich as Dives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  like Dives, won&rsquo;t give a penny to this Lazarus. She smiles, and talks epigrams,  and preaches, but as to helping&mdash;&rdquo; Leah shrugged her shoulders again.</p>
  <p>The  action drew her husband&rsquo;s attention to a very magnificent figure which was  loudly admired. Jim had admired it himself before he had got used to seeing it  in the breakfast-room. Now it struck him that this attraction might be turned  into money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a ripping woman in the way of looks,&rdquo; he said, throwing down the newspaper; &ldquo;if  you went on the stage&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  the fairy queen?&rdquo; inquired his wife, scornfully: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s about all I&rsquo;m suited  for. I know the things I can&rsquo;t do, Jim, and acting is one. Besides, think of  what the Duke would say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  yawned, and lighted a cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can&rsquo;t say more than he has said,&rdquo; he remarked, lazily. &ldquo;&lsquo;Sides, I never go to  hear him preach, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  you send me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? The Duke loves a pretty woman. You can twist him round your little finger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t twist any money out of him,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;s  the pity. We&rsquo;re on the rocks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  said that twice already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  I&rsquo;ll say it again and again and again,&rdquo; snapped Jim. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to realise  the hole we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  I?&rdquo; she queried, with an emotion she would never have shown in society. &ldquo;I  realise that I have one sovereign; and you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  a fiver I intend to borrow from a sure man,&rdquo; said Jim; &ldquo;but I say, what&rsquo;s to be  done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must go through the court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the use of that? It&rsquo;ll only settle our debts. We want ready money. I don&rsquo;t care  a straw about the tradesmen. Can&rsquo;t we let this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  the Duke says we can live in it as long as we like, but if we leave he&rsquo;ll take  it back again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  like giving a boy half a crown and telling him not to spend it,&rdquo; said Kaimes,  looking round. &ldquo;If we only could! It&rsquo;s a jolly sort of room this, and we&rsquo;d get  a good rent for the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  room was indeed pretty, being decorated in a Pompadour manner. Its walls were  adorned with white paper, sprinkled with bunches of roses tied with fluttering  blue ribbons, and the carpet bore the same dainty design. The furniture was of  white wood, upholstered in brocade, also diversified with roses and azure  streamers. There were many delicate water-colour pictures, a grate and  fire-irons of polished brass, and electric lights in rose-tinted globes. Even  the grey December light streaming in through the two windows could not make the  apartment look anything but clean, and delicate, and dainty, and delightful. It  was an ideal nest for a young couple. But this one had outlived the honeymoon,  and cared very little for the ideal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very pretty room,&rdquo; said Jim, again; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re the prettiest thing in it,  Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked at him scornfully, and then glanced around. &ldquo;I hate all this frippery&rdquo;  she said contemptuously. &ldquo;Something more massive would suit me better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you are a kind of Cleopatra, y&rsquo; know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  Jim&rsquo;s historical knowledge had been more accurate, he would have made a better  comparison. Cleopatra, according to the latest discoveries, was small,  foxy-haired, and dainty. She would have suited this Watteau-like room to  perfection. But Lady Jim was as tall as any daughter of the gods, and bore herself  after the imperial style of Juno, Queen of Olympus. Her hair was of a deep red,  and she had a great quantity, as those who saw her pose in charity tableaux  knew very well. Leah possessed the creamy complexion which usually goes with  such hair, and a pair of large blue eyes, out of which her soul had never  peered. They were hard eyes, shallow as those of a bird, and surveyed the world  and its denizens with the inquiring expression of a cat on the look-out for  titbits. Her lips were thin, and covered admirably white and regular teeth. It  was a clever face, and beautiful in its serene immobility. Those who did not  like Lady Jim called her a cat; but she was more like a sleek, dangerous  pantheress, and woe to the victim who came under her claws. Yet she could purr  very prettily on occasions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Jim,&rdquo; she said more graciously, for she was sufficiently a woman to be pleased  with her husband&rsquo;s grudging compliments. &ldquo;Now that you have finished saying  sweet things, what next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  business. We&rsquo;re on the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim,  if you say that again I&rsquo;ll leave you to get out of the trouble yourself. You&rsquo;re  my husband. Think of something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t&mdash;unless it&rsquo;s the insurance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  insurance,&rdquo; said Leah, thoughtfully; &ldquo;twenty thousand pounds, isn&rsquo;t it, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  husband nodded. &ldquo;Old Jarvey Peel, my godfather, had my life insured when I was  a child, and arranged that his heirs should pay up the money every year to keep  it in force. Then there&rsquo;s accumulations of sorts. I don&rsquo;t understand these  stale things myself, Leah, but I know that there&rsquo;s over twenty thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you raise money on it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  the old man arranged that I should lose it if I tried that game. Lord,&rdquo; said  Jim, with disgust, &ldquo;if I could have raised money I should have got rid of it,  ages ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how does it benefit you?&rdquo; asked his wife, curiously; &ldquo;if the money is paid when  you are dead, you won&rsquo;t have any fun. But I&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes gleamed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snapped Jim, not at all pleased at this hint; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d like to  turn me into cash in that way, I know. But it so happens that the twenty  thousand, and whatever additions may have come, will be paid to me when I&rsquo;m  sixty. Much fun in that, when I shan&rsquo;t have teeth to crack nuts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  over thirty now, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirty-five,  and you&rsquo;re only five years younger; so when we get the cash at sixty there won&rsquo;t  be any enjoyment left for either of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirty-five  from sixty,&rdquo; murmured Lady Jim. &ldquo;Leaves how much, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five,&rdquo;  replied Kaimes, after wrinkling his brow and communing with his none too quick  brain. &ldquo;Beastly long time to wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  nodded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no chance of your getting it sooner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the slightest. I can&rsquo;t get a cent on it, and I can&rsquo;t sell it, and I can&rsquo;t use  it in any way. Jarvey Peel was a silly old ass. Died worth no end of coin, and  didn&rsquo;t leave me a penny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if you died, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drop  it,&rdquo; retorted Kaimes, who did not at all relish the suggestion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  but supposing you did?&rdquo; insisted Leah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I &lsquo;spose the money would be paid to you,&rdquo; said Jim, kicking the hearth-rug with  a gloomy face; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t you make any mistake, Leah. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to live right  on to sixty and handle the money. I can&rsquo;t do much at that age, but I&rsquo;ll try  hard to get through the lot before I slip off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you must look after yourself,&rdquo; said Jim, heartlessly; &ldquo;but if you can think of  some scheme to get the cash now, I&rsquo;ll give you half&mdash;there now. There&rsquo;s nothing  mean about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the use of talking rubbish?&rdquo; said Lady Jim, crossly; &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to oblige you, my dear, so don&rsquo;t think it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  don&rsquo;t let us talk any more of the impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it impossible?&rdquo; asked Kaimes, cunningly.</p>
  <p>Leah  looked at him with wide, bright eyes. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might <i>pretend</i> to die, you know,&rdquo; said Jim, looking at her very directly;  &ldquo;then the cash &lsquo;ud be paid to you, and we could share.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rdquo; cried Leah, raising her eyebrows; &ldquo;you would have to give up  your position and disappear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  cares? You know I never stop longer in England than I can help. As to my  position, it&rsquo;s all debts and duns, and squabbling with you. Oh, I&rsquo;d give up the  whole thing for the money!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  never think of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  enough to do to think of myself,&rdquo; grumbled Kaimes; &ldquo;&lsquo;sides, you don&rsquo;t care for  me. As a widow you could have lots of fun on&mdash;on, say&mdash;five thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Jim, take the lion&rsquo;s share to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  shouldn&rsquo;t I be paying the largest price for getting the cash?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  shrugged her shoulders again. &ldquo;There would be very little sacrifice in it so  far as you are concerned,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been three times to South America  since we were married, and I presume with this money you would go there again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  go out of your life for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well,&rdquo; she said coolly; &ldquo;I could show my respect to your memory by wearing a  widow&rsquo;s dress. I expect I should look rather nice in a cap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  Jim was rather disgusted. Little as he loved his wife, he expected her to be  devotedly attached to him, and her ready acquiescence in his disappearance  annoyed him greatly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  got no heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  clever of you to guess that! I gave it to you five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  took it back before the honeymoon was over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you see, Jim, you are so careless a man that I could not think of leaving the  only heart I possess in your hands. Besides, so many women have given you their  hearts that I thought you might confuse the lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  Jim did not like this banter, and said so in a few forcible words. Then he  moved to the door, casting a disgusted look at a pile of bills on Leah&rsquo;s side  of the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about this truck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we&rsquo;ll pay them out of your insurance,&rdquo; laughed Lady Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much. I&rsquo;m not going to disappear and give up everything for the benefit of a  lot of measly tradesmen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you wouldn&rsquo;t dangle grapes out of my reach,&rdquo; said his wife, pettishly; &ldquo;you  know it&rsquo;s not to be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  plunged forward, and, gathering up the mass of papers, threw them into the  fire. &ldquo;Pay them in this way, then,&rdquo; said he, enraged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could,&rdquo; sighed Leah, wearily, and looked at herself in the mirror. &ldquo;Do  stop worrying me, Jim. I&rsquo;m getting to look quite old. Are you going out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  We&rsquo;ve wasted an hour in talking about nothing. We&rsquo;re on the rocks, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, calmly, &ldquo;you end where you began.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  looked up to heaven. &ldquo;And this is a wife!&rdquo; said he, plaintively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this,&rdquo; she mocked, laying her hand on his shoulder, &ldquo;is a probable bankrupt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  me. I&rsquo;ll clear out first to South America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  the insurance money to me, Jim,&rdquo; called Leah, as he banged the door. &ldquo;Twenty  thousand pounds,&rdquo; she soliloquised&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s worth trying for. But I might as well  cry for the moon&rdquo;; and she sighed, the sigh of selfishness, unexpectedly  thwarted.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2</b> </h2>
  <p>Lord  And Lady Jim Kaimes were regarded as a most agreeable couple, and utilised this  reputation to live on their friends. The husband was an admirable shot, a  daring and judicious polo-player, and his skill at cards was as notable as his  dexterity in golfing. Consequently, he was much in request, and benefited  largely in free board and lodging. He was good-looking, which pleased the  women, and good-natured, which satisfied the men. In wrestling and boxing Jim  could more than hold his own, and always paid his gambling debts, even at the  cost of allowing tradesmen to threaten legal proceedings. Thus, according to  modern ideas, he was an honourable man and a good all-round sportsman, a credit  to the British aristocracy and a pleasure to his numerous friends. &ldquo;These be  thy gods, O Israel!&rdquo; A clergyman once preached on this text in Jim&rsquo;s accidental  hearing, but Jim did not know what he meant.</p>
  <p>The  wife was a general favourite with the men, but women fought rather shy of her.  She thought too much of herself, they said, and dressed altogether too well;  and, moreover, never gave even the most bitter-tongued female a chance of  talking scandal in connection with the honoured name to which Jim had called  her attention. However, feminine artfulness led one and all to conceal this  dislike, and Lady Jim received as much kissing and as many sweet words and  invitations as her vain, hungry soul desired. She saw through the wiles of her  own sex clearly, and knew that in nine cases out of ten the woman who kissed  would have preferred to bite. But they knew that Lady Jim knew, and Lady Jim  knew that they knew she knew, so everything went well. As to what was said  behind her back Lady Jim cared not a snap of her fingers, and if any rival  dared to attack her openly she was quite able to use a particularly venomous  tongue, the safeguard against calumny which Nature had given her. And it must  be said that she never went out of her way to harm any one: her position was  that of a passive resister. As she pathetically observed, she was a contented  woman, if only permitted to have her own way.</p>
  <p>Certainly  the women had cause to complain of Lady Jim&rsquo;s gowns, which were far beyond the  ordinary female intellect in cut and fashion, in new material and up-to-date  trimmings. She added her own ingenuity and taste to the creations of the  dressmaker, and the result was always such a triumph as to lead the rest of her  sex to doubt if Providence existed. It would have been even more aggravating  than it was, had it been known that Lady Jim paid next to nothing for her  gowns, and advertised the dressmaker instead of settling the bill. But Leah did  not make this fact public. She was content to use her magnificent figure and  good looks, and her popularity in society, to save a lean purse, and therefore  was daily and nightly clad in the purple and fine linen which wrung envious  tears from other women&rsquo;s eyes. Sometimes Lady Jim, fascinating a society-paper  editor, would utilise his columns and circulation to advertise deserving  tradesmen: while from these, in return, she exacted tangible gratitude in the  welcome shape of gloves, handkerchiefs, scents, and similar needful if  expensive commodities. Lady Jim never signed her name to these literary  efforts, but they drew custom to the shop and filled her wardrobe with what she  wanted at the moment, so she was not ambitious to be known as an authoress.  Even Jim never knew how his wife, as he put it, &ldquo;contrived the tip-top&rdquo;; and  privately thought that the age of miracles was not yet past, when Leah could  make something out of nothing.</p>
  <p>For  five years, more or less, Lady Jim had been clothed as the lilies of the field,  and had been supplied with nutriment by the lineal descendants of Elijah&rsquo;s  ravens; but now things were coming to a crisis. The long lane down which she  had marched as Solomon-in-all-his-glory was about to take a turning, and Lady  Jim did not relish the new route. It led to second-rate lodgings at home or  abroad, to the lack of frocks and a diminution of other women&rsquo;s envy, to the  loss of a thousand and one luxuries which had become necessaries, and to a  self-denying ordinance of which she did not approve. Something must be done to  prevent the necessity of turning down this penurious alley, but when Lady Jim  set out on her shopping excursion she did not very well see how she could avoid  the almost inevitable.</p>
  <p>Needless  to say, Leah had a trifle more in her purse than the one sovereign she had  admitted the existence of to Jim. To be precise, she possessed ten pounds, and  that had to last a week as pocket-money. She felt very hard up as she stepped  into her motor-car and whirled down the street. Had she possessed the lamp of  Aladdin she would have made its slave bankrupt; and to think that seven days of  desiring pretty things should be supported on ten pounds! The beggar at the  gate of Dives could not have been poorer.</p>
  <p>But  there was no sign of penury on the surface. The unpaid sables Lady Jim wore  were the best that the animal could give; the fur rug over her feet had cost  enough to keep a poor family for six months in food and fire, though she, or  rather Jim, was being dunned for the payment of that; the motor-car was one of  the best and newest, and Lady Jim drove it with the reckless speed of a woman  who thinks the world was created so that she should play Juggernaut. Having  plenty of courage, and a love for playing with death, Leah was a daring and  skilful driver. Before now she had swept round a corner with two wheels beating  the air. But she had not as yet crushed any one under the said wheels, and she  ascribed this luck to her peacock&rsquo;s feather. Like all who have small belief in  the Deity, Lady Jim was superstitious in a small way. Her fetish was a peacock&rsquo;s  feather, and so long as she had one about her, nothing, so she averred, could  possibly go wrong. There was one now thrust into the left-hand lamp of the car,  and the panels were painted with the same feathers, until they resembled the  tail of Juno&rsquo;s favourite bird. Lady Jim might forget to go to church, or to say  her prayers, or to thank God, but she never forgot the necessary peacock&rsquo;s  feather which was to ensure prosperity and safety. She was reported to make  genuflections before a shrine of this sort, but the report was probably  exaggerated. No one knew what kind of a Baal she worshipped, but it is  ridiculous to say that she did not adore at least one, for she was, in her way,  a very religious woman.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim raced her car out of Curzon Street, down Park Lane, and into Piccadilly,  where she amused herself with dodging nervous people and shaving the wheels of  vehicles drawn by humble quadrupeds. The chauffeur sat grimly silent, expecting  an almost certain spill, with the calm of a fatalist. He knew it would come  some day, in spite of his mistress&rsquo;s skilful driving, but he neither worried  nor remonstrated. He was paid for a silent tongue and healthy nerves, and if  his life <i>was</i> insured rather heavily, considering his profession, that  was no one&rsquo;s business but his wife&rsquo;s, and she had already decided how to spend  the insurance money. But the woman need not have been so sure of such good  fortune. Lady Jim did not mind hurting other people, but she had an uncommonly  good notion of how to preserve the only neck she possessed.</p>
  <p>When  the car reached Bond Street, Lady Jim, who was as calm as though she had  finished a donkey-ride, stepped down and entered a jeweller&rsquo;s shop. Lately she  had paid a trifle off his bill, and thought herself entitled to double the  gross amount. The jeweller, knowing the Duke of Pentland had fifty thousand a  year, and that Lady Jim was too pretty a daughter-in-law not to get her own way  with so gay an old nobleman, did not object to his customer&rsquo;s purchases. If  Lady Jim could not pay the Duke would, so she was permitted to take away  several objects for which she had no use. Then she went to select some new  hats, and look at the latest thing in frocks. A call at certain other  establishments resulted in the car being heaped with expensive trifles for  Christmas presents. Afterwards the car whirled into Oxford Street, returned to  Piccadilly, and stopped every now and then like a bird of prey. At some shops  she was received with sickly smiles; at others, which she favoured for the  first time with her custom, with rejoicing grins: but out of every place Lady  Jim walked calmly, with a shopman in the rear bringing parcels to increase the  baggage on the car. She achieved the whole afternoon&rsquo;s work without once  opening her purse. Could Rothschild have financed things better?</p>
  <p>At  five o&rsquo;clock, with lighted lamps and unabated speed, Lady Jim drove her machine  to Berkeley Square, and, leaving the chauffeur to choke and shiver in the damp  fog, walked into a dull-looking house to see her godmother, Lady Canvey. She  wished to ask the advice of that kindly, shrewd old pagan, and was not at all  pleased when she found the Rev. Lionel Kaimes, trying to lead Lady Canvey in  the right way. He had been trying to guide her heavenward for the last year,  but the bright-eyed old dame still danced along the primrose path with nimble  feet and an appreciation of the agreeable people who were dancing along with  her to perdition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, submitting her withered cheek to a conventional  kiss. &ldquo;Lionel, here, has been speaking of the devil, and you appear. There&rsquo;s  some truth in proverbs, it seems.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lady Canvey,&rdquo; sighed a soft voice at the old pagan&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  forgot, Leah, this is my &lsquo;Philip you-are-but-mortal&rsquo; companion. You have not  met her before, and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll seek her company again. She&rsquo;s not  quite your sort, my dear, not quite your sort. Joan, come and show yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  response to this order a slim, tall girl, with a serious face, came forward  shyly, and put out a timid hand. She was plainly dressed in a black stuff gown,  without colour or ornament. Her hands and feet were slim and small; she had  wavy brown hair twisted into a loose knot at the nape of her neck, and the  features of her somewhat pale face were delicately shaped. On the whole an  uncommonly pretty girl, Lady Jim decided, after taking in all this at a glance,  but less seriousness and brighter smiles would improve her looks. She was like  Pygmalion&rsquo;s statue before the goddess had flushed its cold whiteness with rosy  blood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you?&rdquo; asked Leah, nodding in a friendly way, but without shaking hands. &ldquo;You  are one of Lady Canvey&rsquo;s discoveries, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  discovery,&rdquo; put in Lionel, cheerfully, and with a proud glance at the white-rose  beauty of the girl. &ldquo;Lady Canvey wanted a companion, and I brought her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of Fra Angelico&rsquo;s saints,&rdquo; finished Lady Jim, who was honest enough to confess  inwardly that this ethereal loveliness was most attractive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so,&rdquo; chuckled Lady Canvey, arranging many costly rings on a pair of knuckly  hands. &ldquo;Lionel knows how I enjoy the company of a saint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must put up with a sinner for the time being,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, good-humouredly. &ldquo;I  have come to talk business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means you intend to worry me,&rdquo; grumbled Lady Canvey, with a sharp glance from  under her bushy eyebrows. &ldquo;I hate being worried and bored.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I shan&rsquo;t bore you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you will. Other people&rsquo;s affairs always bore me. I am not like his reverence  here,&rdquo; and she waved her ebony cane towards the young curate, who laughed  cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  admit there is some lack of resemblance,&rdquo; assented Lady Jim, dryly.</p>
  <p>Then  she looked from the young man to the old woman. Lionel was her husband&rsquo;s  cousin, and should death make a clean sweep of the Duke, and Frith and Jim, he  would inherit the title and the fifty thousand a year which Lady Jim coveted.  This possibility, which it must be admitted was sufficiently remote, did not  make Leah love the young man any the more. Besides, he was what she called &ldquo;goody-goody,&rdquo;  which meant that he had entered the service of his Master for use and not for  show. As the curate of an exacting vicar in a Lambeth parish, he grubbed  amongst the dirty poor, and dispensed soup, soap, shelter, and salvation.  Rarely did Lionel come to the West End, as his task lay amongst the poor and  lowly; but when he did venture into high places he always called on Lady  Canvey, who had an odd kind of affection for him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s misguided, but genuine,  my love,&rdquo; said the pagan, &ldquo;and moreover, he amuses me!&rdquo; which last statement  amply accounted for the favour with which the old lady regarded him. Lionel was  rather like Jim, tall and muscular and handsome. But his face had an  intelligent look which Leah had never beheld in the dull visage of her husband,  and his blue eyes had the bright, calm gaze of one whose faith is certain. He  affected the usual clerical garb, but being only twenty-five, and boyish at  that, his face wore a genial, cheerful, unworried expression, which made most  people open their hearts. Like a doctor, a clergyman must have a good bedside  manner, and this Lionel possessed. Moreover, his heart was kindly, and he was  quick to observe the snubbed and neglected. This feeling drew him towards Joan,  who had retreated, colouring painfully, when Lady Jim substituted a nod for a  handshake. The girl was busy with a silver teapot, egg-shell china, and hot  cakes, and presently handed a cup to the visitor. Lady Jim took it somewhat  absently, and having satisfied herself with Lionel&rsquo;s looks and personality,  turned her eyes on Lady Canvey.</p>
  <p>Outwardly  the old dame resembled the godmother of a fairy story, and would have been  admirably suited to the pointed cap and scarlet cloak of a professed witch. Yet  the remains of beauty lingered about her wrinkled face, recalling exciting  Crimean days when she had been a belle. She was small and shrunken and bent,  and sometimes her grey head shook with palsy. But her spirit was still vigorous  and her brain clear, as could be seen by the steadiness of her piercing black  eyes, diamond-bright and clear. She wore a lace cap, a dress of silvery grey  satin, and many jewels costly but old-fashioned. Add to these a white  China-crape shawl and an ebony cane, and behold the portrait of the lady known  as the &ldquo;cleverest old harridan in town.&rdquo; But that description was given by an  enemy. Lady Canvey had a quick brain and a sharp tongue, yet her heart was as  kindly as that of Lionel. Perhaps it was this which drew the young and old  together.</p>
  <p>The  room was comfortable, and luxuriously furnished, but with the ugly taste of the  Early Victorian epoch. Lady Canvey, now over eighty, clung to the decorations  and colours which had been fashionable when she was young, and on stepping into  the room Lady Jim felt as though she had slipped back to the time of the Great  Exhibition. The motor-car outside, and the old lady in the red velvet armchair,  represented widely-severed eras. And even Joan the saint and Lionel the curate  seemed alien to the world Lady Jim inhabited. For that world closely resembled  the one Noah had fled from into the ark, when the denizens &ldquo;were eating and  drinking and marrying and giving in marriage&rdquo;&mdash;though, to be sure, marriage  nowadays, save as a visible sign of respectability, was not much considered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  godmother,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, thinking to curry favour with this she-Cr&oelig;sus by  using an approved, if somewhat obsolete, address, &ldquo;you are looking well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;m a living lie,&rdquo; retorted Lady Canvey, grimly. &ldquo;How can you expect me to look  well, when Lionel here has been quoting texts for want of originality?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wanted you to hear the scripture,&rdquo; protested Lionel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>your</i> business,&rdquo; replied Lady Canvey, stirring her tea; &ldquo;but I can hear  the scriptures read when I please by Joan, who has a much sweeter voice than you,  young man, as I suppose you think&rdquo;; and she gave one of her dry chuckles.</p>
  <p>The  curate reddened, and Joan looked confused. Lady Jim, glancing from one serious  face to the other, drew her own conclusions, and murmured something about a &ldquo;sealed  fountain.&rdquo; Lady Canvey, not being versed in biblical imagery, did not  understand, but Lionel comprehended on the instant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to hear that you read your Bible, Lady James,&rdquo; he said quickly.</p>
  <p>Leah  hated to be addressed in this stiff manner; yet it seemed appropriate to the  out-of-date room. But she had no desire to quarrel with her godmother&rsquo;s pet in  the presence of that opulent lady, so she turned the tables on Lionel by  looking shocked. &ldquo;Of course I do. I am not a pagan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I must be one,&rdquo; snapped Lady Canvey; &ldquo;for I wouldn&rsquo;t be you, Leah Kaimes, for  the heaven I don&rsquo;t expect to go to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  hush!&rdquo; said Lionel, pained by this flippancy coming from those withered lips.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim glanced at her opulent beauty in a dim mirror, framed in tarnished gold,  and laughed softly. Her godmother saw the look and was swift to interpret its  meaning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was like that once,&rdquo; she said, in rather a quavering voice, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll come to  be such as I am, only you&rsquo;ll never wear so well. Oh, what an arm I had!&rdquo; and  she began to weep silently over her lost beauty.</p>
  <p>While  Lionel and Joan comforted the poor soul, Leah looked sympathetic but gave no  assistance. She decided that Lady Canvey was in her dotage, and would be the  more easily dealt with on that account. Her one desire, therefore, was to get  rid of the two unnecessary people and begin operations at once. She hoped by  skilful management to come away with a considerable cheque in Lady Canvey&rsquo;s  shaky handwriting. Those drivelling tears meant a weak will, and that, to one  of Leah&rsquo;s determination, meant money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  this business,&rdquo; she began, when the old woman was again her cheerful, cynical  self: &ldquo;could you spare me ten minutes, godmother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  my dear. It&rsquo;s all I <i>can</i> spare you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was not a promising beginning, but Lady Jim knew she would not walk off with  the spoils without a sharp brush for their gaining. She looked at Lionel, and  then at the girl, whom she was sure in her own heart the curate loved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever heard Mr. Kaimes talk Chinese metaphysics, Miss Tallentire?&rdquo; she asked  Joan, having possessed herself of the companion&rsquo;s surname.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Joan, opening her violet eyes widely. &ldquo;I am not clever enough to  understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  Mr. Kaimes if he doesn&rsquo;t think you are clever enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really,  Lady James&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lionel,&rdquo;  interrupted Lady Canvey, sharply, &ldquo;go into the conservatory with Joan. She will  show you a new dwarf oak which I lately bought. Leah will entertain me. And I&rsquo;m  pretty sure,&rdquo; chuckled she, &ldquo;that I shall entertain Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  going to be nasty,&rdquo; thought Lady Jim, with a charming smile, and continued to  smile until the curate and his unsuspecting companion went to see the dwarf oak  and to talk Chinese metaphysics, which Leah was certain they would do. Lionel,  with a defiant glance at his cousin, and with a colour which made him look  unexpectedly handsome, followed Joan out of the stuffy room. When the door was  closed, and the fire was unnecessarily poked up, and Lady Canvey was  comfortably settled in her chair, after a word or two about the draughts which  no one but herself could feel in that close atmosphere, Lady Jim waited  patiently for her godmother to begin the battle.</p>
  <p>She  had not long to wait. Lady Canvey&rsquo;s eyes were bright, and Lady Canvey&rsquo;s spirit  reared like a warhorse to plunge down on Leah. She sniffed once or twice, and  looked sharply at the beautiful, smiling face. Then she delivered herself of a  speech which put Lady Jim&rsquo;s late behaviour in a nutshell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah,&rdquo;  said Lady Canvey, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a born cat.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3</b> </h2>
  <p>Lady  Jim was not at all offended. She made every allowance for the querulous temper  of old age, and still smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  rather like cats myself,&rdquo; she observed casually. &ldquo;They know what they want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they don&rsquo;t always get it, my dear,&rdquo; snapped Lady Canvey; adding inconsequently,  &ldquo;when the cat&rsquo;s in the dairy, she&rsquo;s after the cream.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an original remark,&rdquo; said Leah, languidly, and loosening her  furs, for the room really was heated like the conservatory, in which the lovers  talked Chinese metaphysics. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t George Eliot say something of the sort?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew him,&rdquo; retorted Lady Canvey, wilfully dense. &ldquo;You and your Chinese  metaphysics indeed! I won&rsquo;t have it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  them,&rdquo; corrected Leah, gently, and unable to resist the opportunity.</p>
  <p>Lady  Canvey scowled like the fairy Caraboss, and continued, without heeding the  impertinence, &ldquo;Joan is the daughter of Lionel&rsquo;s vicar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see, and he intends to be the vicar&rsquo;s son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;News!&rdquo;  expressed Lady Jim, serenely. &ldquo;I never knew such a prig as Lionel could fall in  love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  love is the love of an honest man,&rdquo; declared the old dame, striking her crutch  on the carpet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so, for the sake of his cloth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chinese  metaphysics indeed!&rdquo; grumbled Lady Canvey. &ldquo;The poor child did not know what  you meant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  certainly seems to be somewhat dull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dull  yourself, Leah. She&rsquo;s a sweet-tempered, good, thoughtful girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I didn&rsquo;t mean to say she was so dull as all those qualities imply,&rdquo; said Lady  Jim, sweetly.</p>
  <p>Lady  Canvey looked wrathfully round for something to throw at her visitor&rsquo;s head.  But the tea-table was too far away, and the old woman prized her cups and  saucers. Finally she took refuge in a spiteful speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s</i> an honest girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sincerely hope so, seeing she is your companion,&rdquo; replied Leah, not caring to  take up so ridiculous a challenge. &ldquo;When did you start her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah!&rdquo;  Lady Canvey thumped the ground again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk slang. If you wish to know,  although I don&rsquo;t think it is any of your business, Joan Tallentire came to me  two months ago, during which time you have not come to see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was abroad,&rdquo; apologised Lady Jim, stifling a yawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gambling  at Monte Carlo, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did meet Jim there. He lost heavily on the red. I won, and came home with  enough to see me through the last month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  were you living on abroad?&rdquo; asked the old woman, contemptuously.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim leaned back and placed her muff-chain between two very red lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me think,&rdquo; she murmured, not put out in the least. &ldquo;Oh, that little dowdy  Australian woman, who is trying to get into society on her husband&rsquo;s money,  asked me to stop at their villa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  four weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  borrowed money, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim nodded blandly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect me to live with pigs for nothing,&rdquo; she  said, with the greatest coolness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  live with the devil and borrow from him, I believe,&rdquo; cried the exasperated Lady  Canvey, glaring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>do</i> live with one,&rdquo; assented her god-daughter; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s a stony-broke devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  modern flowers of speech!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t create the language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can help using it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  People wouldn&rsquo;t understand if I talked like Lady Jane Grey or Elizabeth Fry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were good women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  so dull,&rdquo; objected Lady Jim. &ldquo;Why is it good women are always dull and dowdy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are getting ready for the next world,&rdquo; mumbled Lady Canvey, solemnly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their  outfit can&rsquo;t cost much, then,&rdquo; declared Leah, flippantly; &ldquo;but aren&rsquo;t we going  to talk business? Think of that poor French, sitting in the motor-car all this  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  sorry for him, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said the old woman, ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horribly,&rdquo;  replied Lady Jim, calmly; &ldquo;but at least the poor creature is cooler than I am.  This room is stifling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  call your fellow-sinner a creature, Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Even had I not seen Lionel I could guess he had been with you, godmother. He  loves the dirty and disreputable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you love the rich and disreputable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  obvious speech is hardly worthy of your reputation,&rdquo; was Lady Jim&rsquo;s reply. Then  she crossed her legs, rested her muff on her knee, and protested, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait  here much longer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  account of French?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but I&rsquo;m going to dine at the Cecil to-night, with a boy in the Lancers. He&rsquo;s a  nice boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a rich boy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course! I don&rsquo;t like boys without money. But this business,&rdquo; she went on  hurriedly. &ldquo;Jim and I are in a hole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ought to be in gaol,&rdquo; was the angry reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That <i>would</i> be a hole,&rdquo; said Leah, good-humouredly; &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t want to see  Jim and me in the bankruptcy court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I bother? It&rsquo;s nothing to do with me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  your god-daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a heartless cat,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, angrily, and with her eyes scintillating  like jewels. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Leah. I&rsquo;ve helped you and that rascal Jim over and  over again. Apply to the Duke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we&rsquo;ve done that. He won&rsquo;t give us a penny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  ask some of those nice boys you talk of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim sat very upright in her chair, and a becoming colour heightened her beauty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t ask any men for money,&rdquo; she declared; &ldquo;you know perfectly well, Lady  Canvey, that I am an honest woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how dull that sounds,&rdquo; chuckled Lady Canvey, turning the tables; &ldquo;you should be  more original, Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mind going out to dinner with a man,&rdquo; cried Lady Jim, feeling herself  much aggrieved, &ldquo;nor do I mind a box at the theatre, or some gloves or things  of that sort, so long as Jim doesn&rsquo;t object.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  Much you care for Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. Jim&rsquo;s got a temper. He told me this very morning he&rsquo;d screw my neck if I  broke loose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I respect him for saying it,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, energetically; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d respect  him still more if he did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I said to him,&rdquo; retorted Leah, grimly. &ldquo;All the same, I am straight  enough. No one can say a word against me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad to hear it. You have your good points, Leah,&rdquo; observed Lady Canvey, in a  more kindly tone; &ldquo;but you show your worst side to the world. Why not turn over  a new leaf?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  just about to do so, and there&rsquo;s bankruptcy on the other side, unless you help  us, dear godmother,&rdquo; she ended coaxingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the firm response. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like pouring water into a sieve. I&rsquo;ve  given you and Jim at least five thousand pounds. Where is it, I ask&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must pay our bills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ought to, but you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money  will go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  ways it shouldn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; snapped the old woman, feeling herself mistress of the  situation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense to me, Leah. You and that rascal are a couple  of spendthrifts. The Duke, bless him, started you both with a good home and a  good income, and now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  we&rsquo;re on the rocks, as Jim cleverly puts it,&rdquo; said Leah, who could not help  seeing the humour of the dilemma. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think Jim was so original, did  you, godmother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah,  you&rsquo;re impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know why you should say that,&rdquo; remonstrated Lady Jim. &ldquo;I must keep  up my position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not as if you had been expensively brought up,&rdquo; went on Lady Canvey, unheeding.  &ldquo;Your father was a wasteful pauper, for he got precious little off that estate  of his in Buckinghamshire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what he did get went into his own pocket,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, supplementing the  family history; &ldquo;but as my mother was dead, and I was his only daughter, he  might have treated me better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Geoffrey  Wain was like yourself, Leah&mdash;a hard-hearted, selfish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  spare me these adjectives,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Jim, rising. &ldquo;My father is dead,  so there&rsquo;s nothing more to say. If you can&rsquo;t help me, at least you needn&rsquo;t call  me names.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, very politely. &ldquo;As I don&rsquo;t intend to give  you a shilling, I have no right to tell you what I think of your doings. Will  you ring the bell, please? I want Joan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  Lady Canvey took this tone Leah knew well that the case was hopeless. In spite  of senile weeping, it appeared that the old woman was not so easily beguiled as  might have been expected. There seemed nothing for it but to leave in silence;  but remembering how desperate was the position, Lady Jim refrained from ringing  the bell and made a last appeal&mdash;this time on business grounds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will give me a thousand pounds for six months,&rdquo; she proposed, &ldquo;my husband  and I will pay it back with interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the security, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  joint names,&rdquo; said Leah, with dignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ring  the bell,&rdquo; was all the answer that Lady Canvey vouchsafed to this proposal; &ldquo;and  goodnight, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim recognised that she was beaten, and nothing remained, but to retire with  dignity. Pressing the button of the bell, she crossed to Lady Canvey and kissed  her withered cheek with a caressing smile. &ldquo;I am so pleased to see you looking  so well,&rdquo; she said gently; &ldquo;but I see signs of failing in your conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t see any signs of lending,&rdquo; was the grim response. &ldquo;Oh, here you are,  Joan,&rdquo; as that young lady entered the room with Lionel at her heels. &ldquo;Send  these people away, and read me a chapter out of that new novel which came  yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo;  said Lionel, bending over the old lady, and kissing her hand with the  tenderness of a son.</p>
  <p>She  twitched it away. &ldquo;There&mdash;there&mdash;goodnight. Take Leah to that miserable creature  who is perishing in her motor-car, and don&rsquo;t make love to her. She is one of  those women who are a crown to their husbands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim did not wait to hear the old woman&rsquo;s chuckle as she fired this last shot,  but swept out of the room, smiling kindly on Miss Tallentire. The curate  followed her, and Leah began to consider what use she could make of him to  farther her plans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me drive you to Lambeth,&rdquo; she said, while arranging her sables at the door.</p>
  <p>Lionel  laughed. &ldquo;Lambeth would be shocked to see me arrive at my lodgings in such an  up-to-date style,&rdquo; said he, pulling up the collar of his coat. &ldquo;No, thank you,  Lady James. I&rsquo;ll walk for a time, and then take a Westminster Bridge &lsquo;bus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she contradicted, in an imperious tone. &ldquo;I wish to talk to you.  Come, get in. French, you can go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the car, my lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  look to that. Do as you&rsquo;re told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Looking  rather apprehensively at the machine, which was humming and shaking in the  bitter cold, French touched his cap and moved away. Leah stepped lightly in,  and beckoned to Lionel with one hand, while she gripped the steering-wheel with  the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  curate did not display much eagerness to come. &ldquo;Is it safe?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve  sent the man away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I want to talk privately with you. Safe!&rdquo; she echoed in a tone of impatient  scorn; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d drive a car against Edge himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well,&rdquo; said Kaimes, carelessly, and placed himself beside her. He was  utterly devoid of fear, and if there was to be a smash, he was not unprepared  to enter the next world. Lady Jim gave the wheel a twirl, and the car glided  through the square under the grey muffling of the fog. Reckless as she was,  Lady Jim had to steer carefully and move slowly, lest she should run into  something, for the fog was a trifle thicker than it had been during the  afternoon. All the same, her keen eyes could see clearly enough, and she was  not at all afraid. Cool under all circumstances, Lady Jim would have hummed a  ditty on the streaming bridge of a plunging, bucking tramp-steamer, going down  in the bitter North Atlantic weather. Lionel marvelled at her composure, and  wondered if even her dear intellect could grasp the meaning of death and its  hereafter. But Lady Jim was thinking of this world rather than of the next, and  talked of her troubles while steering the car down Piccadilly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim  and I are in a hole about money,&rdquo; she announced abruptly, for there was no need  to be diplomatic with this simpleton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not unusual,&rdquo; murmured Lionel.</p>
  <p>She  laughed and nodded. &ldquo;No. We have both a wonderful capacity for getting through  cash. Now we&rsquo;ve got down to what an American girl called the bed-rock, and we  want help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew you when you did not want help,&rdquo; said the curate, wondering what was  best to say; &ldquo;and in some ways, your want is very dire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  preach, Lionel. Money is better than sermons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  such as you and Jim, no doubt. But setting aside the spiritual need, a sermon  on your extravagance would do you good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid not,&rdquo; rejoined Lady Jim, putting on the brake for the St. James&rsquo;s Street  incline; &ldquo;it would only go in at one ear and out of the other. When I want  sermons I&rsquo;ll come and hear you preach in that dirty little church of yours.  Meantime, you must help to get Jim and me out of this scrape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  was annoyed by her reference to his church, but from experience he knew it was  worse than useless to argue with Lady Jim. &ldquo;I cannot help you,&rdquo; he said  stiffly; &ldquo;you know my small means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  the man, I don&rsquo;t mean you to put your hand in your pocket. I am quite aware  that the clergy are better at asking than at giving.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no right to say that,&rdquo; remonstrated Kaimes, warmly. &ldquo;We help the poor and  needy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case you have now a chance of practising what you preach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim negotiated Cockspur Street and felt her way along Trafalgar Square in the  hope of hitting Whitehall. Only when the car was buzzing down that thoroughfare  did Lionel speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sitting in a most expensive machine,&rdquo; he said, indignantly, &ldquo;swathed in a  costly rug, and beside a woman with a fortune on her back in the way of  clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you ought to be very happy,&rdquo; said Leah, calmly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll drop you at Lambeth  soon, and then you can get back to the mud and rags, which you seem to prefer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  meaning is, that if you were poor you could not afford these luxuries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  It is only poor people who <i>can</i> afford them. The rich make their money by  self-denial, and wearing clothes which don&rsquo;t fit, in houses furnished with the  riff-raff of auction-rooms. Jim and I have been brought up to better things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  better worldly things,&rdquo; corrected Lionel, bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  very pleasant they are, my dear man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is people such as you and your husband who make the poor discontented,&rdquo;  insisted the curate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t see why the poor should be,&rdquo; murmured Lady Jim, vaguely; &ldquo;there  are lots of shelters and soup-kitchens and workhouses. And I always put ten  shillings into the plate on Hospital Sunday, not to speak of the way in which I&rsquo;ve  danced and sung at performances&mdash;got up to help people who don&rsquo;t need the money  so much as I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nero  fiddling, while Rome burned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  and what else could the poor man have done?&rdquo; retorted Leah. &ldquo;There were no  fire-brigades in those days, were there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  felt helpless. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, I do. You mean to be nasty. If I were a vindictive woman I would drop you  into the river, car and all&rdquo;&mdash;they were crossing Westminster Bridge by this time&mdash;&ldquo;but  I always like to be nice. Being nasty brings wrinkles, and makes one so old.  But about our trouble,&rdquo; she went on, determined to have her own way. &ldquo;Lady  Canvey won&rsquo;t help us, and no one else either. There&rsquo;s the Duke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has done enough for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; Lady Jim assured him coolly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s kept us on bread and water&mdash;that&rsquo;s  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Lionel was shocked at this ungrateful speech. &ldquo;And you prefer <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie  gras</i> and champagne?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally!  Not that I like <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras</i>. They torture the geese to get it, I  believe, and it seems cruel to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a tender heart,&rdquo; said Kaimes, sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been my ruin. But this trouble&mdash;&rdquo; She harked back again to the one subject  which occupied her thoughts. &ldquo;Will you see the Duke, and ask him to give us&mdash;say&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;well,  two thousand pounds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I won&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll only waste it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so like you parsons,&rdquo; said Lady Jim snappishly: &ldquo;we ask for bread, and you give  us a stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of bread is a trifle too much to ask for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all, I always ask for twice what I hope to get. But here we are on the other  side of the water. I can&rsquo;t take the machine into your dirty little slums. Get  down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  did so, and stepped on to the pavement. &ldquo;Thank you for the drive,&rdquo; said he,  lifting his soft hat.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim nodded vaguely. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you speak to the Duke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kaimes  hesitated. He did not wish to appear churlish; yet it seemed useless to  interfere. &ldquo;The Duke is very independent,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll  listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, he will. You&rsquo;re a parson, and he is old enough to be afraid of the next  world. Tell him we&rsquo;re cleaned out, and get Jim and me a thousand. And I tell  you what,&rdquo; added Leah, generously. &ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll give you a ten-pound note  for your charities, though I don&rsquo;t believe in helping paupers myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you ask help on that ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I mean the unwashed paupers you&rsquo;re so fond of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  ruminated. &ldquo;Do you and Jim go down to Firmingham for Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  It will be horribly dull. The Duke is so fond of that old-fashioned Dickens  Christmas, with its holly and mistletoe rubbish; but we must keep in with him.  What of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not explain your position, and&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we&rsquo;ve explained it a dozen times. But the Duke doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand. Now,  you can put the thing to him nicely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said the curate, slowly. &ldquo;I go to Firmingham at Christmas to preach, so I&rsquo;ll  speak to the Duke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a brick,&rdquo; cried Lady Jim, holding out her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and hear you preach  when we&rsquo;re in Firmingham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope it will do you good,&rdquo; said Lionel, shaking hands. &ldquo;You think me a prig,  Lady James, but I assure you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you do,&rdquo; said Leah, dreading further sermons; &ldquo;but I must get home to  dress. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo;  echoed Lionel, hopelessly, and saw the car glide away into the fog between the  lines of blurred lights. &ldquo;Poor woman!&rdquo; he thought, turning towards his  lodgings. &ldquo;How terribly sad her spiritual position is! I trust she will get  home safely, seeing she is so worldly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  need not have troubled. Lady Jim reached Curzon Street in safety, and in very  good spirits. Did not a peacock&rsquo;s feather adorn one of the motor-car lamps?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4</b> </h2>
  <p>Firmingham  was the smallest of the Duke of Pentland&rsquo;s country seats, and so cosy, that he  invariably held his Christmas revels there, in preference to dispensing  Yule-tide hospitality in more splendid mansions. Situated in a woody and  elevated part of Essex&mdash;that county presumed to be a fog-tormented puddle&mdash;the quaint  Georgian house was ideal in itself, and in the repose and charm of its  surroundings.</p>
  <p>Ugly  it probably was when erected, but time had mellowed its glaring walls of red  brick, and nature had draped them with hangings of dark green ivy. The square,  lofty house, with its freestone ornamentation, its many windows and gigantic  porch, stood on a slight rise, a position which enhanced its noble proportions.  On three sides, level with the ground floor, extended broad greystone terraces,  with shallow steps leading downward to smooth lawns. These, stretching for a  considerable distance, terminated in flower-beds, now devoid of blossom and  colour. And lawns, house, and flower-gardens were girdled by pines and oaks,  sycamore-trees and elms, with noble examples of the birch, the beech, and  cedars, proud and tall. A wide, straight avenue ran for a quarter of a mile  through grim firs to ornate iron gates swinging between massive stone pillars,  surmounted by the ducal arms. And these same gates gave entrance to a spacious  and wild park, as delightful as that &ldquo;wood near Athens&rdquo; where Oberon tricked  Titania.</p>
  <p>The  charming country outside this sacred enclosure appealed to artists in search of  the picturesque. Certainly, the landscape was domestic and tame, for here  nature yielded to the controlling hand of man. But the pleasant walks, the deep  lanes, the ancient villages, and the comfortable farmhouses, sprinkled thickly  for miles, made, in conjunction, a pretty picture of rural peace and  contentment. And the contentment was genuine, for no better or more considerate  landlord than the Duke existed. He was popular in the neighbourhood, and his  sway almost imperial&mdash;a true king of the castle.</p>
  <p>Jim  and his wife drove from the station in quite a Darby and Joan style, and,  through fear of the Duke, rather than in compliment to the season, were  prepared to enact the parts of man and wife to perfection. It was rather hard  for Leah to say pretty things to Jim in public, and for Jim to hover anxiously  round Leah as a lover-like husband; but the Duke expected such behaviour, and  they were astute enough not to disappoint him. In his rough tweeds, with jovial  looks and hearty words, Jim was quite the English squire of the story-book, and  shook hands with some of his father&rsquo;s tenants who haunted the local station in  quite the &ldquo;all-men-are-brothers&rdquo; style. Leah also dispensed smiles and nods to  marvelling villagers, who stared open-mouthed at her beauty. But in the  comfortable brougham, Jim folded his arms and lapsed into sulky silence, and  Leah yawned and looked out of the window for want of something better to do.  They were off the stage now, and could take their ease.</p>
  <p>Very  wintry looked the landscape through which they passed. The meadow-lands were  deep in snow, and gaunt, leafless trees started like black spectres from the  milky ground. Ponds and ditches wore masks of darkly-green ice, and the frozen  road rang like iron under the hoofs of the horses. A yellowish sky, with the  promise of almost immediate snow, lowered over the starving world, and, for  lack of foliage, the landscape widened to the observing eye. A dull crimson in  the west showed that the sun was sinking in foggy splendour. The shrill voices  of children, singing music-hall songs instead of carols, saluted their ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  like a Christmas card, isn&rsquo;t it, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it wasn&rsquo;t for the music-hall songs,&rdquo; assented her husband, looking out of his  window. &ldquo;Wonder if there&rsquo;ll be skatin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay. I hope so. I love skating.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause  you can show off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have each our little vanities, Jim,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, whom hope made  good-humoured. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the church&mdash;what a pretty old building, and how well the  snow contrasts with the red roof and the ivy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have to go there on Christmas Day,&rdquo; gloomed Kaimes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must show an example to the lower orders,&rdquo; explained Leah, in her  British-matron tone. &ldquo;Besides, Lionel preaches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  awful! Why has the Duke put him in the bill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Dane, the vicar, is ill, and asked Lionel to fill the pulpit. The Duke has  nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wish  I had,&rdquo; grumbled Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have the sermon cut out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  have the church turned into a music-hall, I daresay,&rdquo; retorted his wife,  contemptuously. &ldquo;But you must be as nice as you know how to Lionel. Remember,  he promised to speak to the Duke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  keep awake during his sermon, but I shan&rsquo;t promise to do more, Leah. You&rsquo;re  runnin&rsquo; this show.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, but I don&rsquo;t want you to spoil it. Lionel has great influence with the Duke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frightens  the old man to death with texts and Tophet, I expect,&rdquo; said Jim, crossly. &ldquo;I  know these parsons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was not aware that your circle of friends included such respectable  acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can hold a candle to a certain person as well as you, Leah. Who do we meet at  Firmingham?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  usual dull lot,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, with a yawn. &ldquo;Frith and his stupid little wife,  who seems to model herself on David Copperfield&rsquo;s Dora. Then Lady Canvey, with  her new companion, is sure to be present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fancy  havin&rsquo; that death&rsquo;s-head at a Christmas feast. Who else, Leah?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  little Russian doctor, Demetrius. We met him at the Embassy, if you remember.  Not the Russian Embassy, but the French. He&rsquo;s out of favour with the Czar, and  dare not leave England in case he should be sent to Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can practise for it here,&rdquo; said Jim, shivering, &ldquo;Beastly cold, isn&rsquo;t it, Leah?  What&rsquo;s Demetrius doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looking  after the Duke&rsquo;s health. He says he can cure his gout.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope he will,&rdquo; muttered Kaimes, devoutly. &ldquo;For if Frith comes along we shan&rsquo;t  get a shillin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  half afraid we shan&rsquo;t get one now,&rdquo; sighed Lady Jim. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the avenue. What a  charming place!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  let it out on buildin&rsquo; leases, if I had it,&rdquo; remarked the prosaic Jim, &ldquo;an&rsquo; cut  the timber. Lot of money in those trees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  look into jewellers&rsquo; windows, Jim. You&rsquo;re not rich enough to buy the stock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rich!  It was as much as I could do to scrape enough together for our tickets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  well,&rdquo; said Leah, reassuringly, as the wheels scrunched the frozen snow before  the great porch, &ldquo;we needn&rsquo;t spend anything here, except half a crown for the  plate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Catch  me wastin&rsquo; money in that way,&rdquo; snapped Kaimes, swinging himself out to help his  wife to alight. &ldquo;Halloa, here&rsquo;s old Colley, lookin&rsquo; like a dean as usual&rdquo;; and  Jim, again assuming his hearty manner and jovial leer, shook hands with the butler,  whom he had known since Etonian days.</p>
  <p>The  house-party was composed of hostile elements; consequently, every one was  compelled to adopt a forced air of Christmas peace and good-will, which rather  tried jumpy nerves. The Duke dug up fossilised cousins to participate in the  festive season, and these did not suit with some fashionable folk, who for  various reasons, as they put it, &ldquo;had to be nice to the dear old Duke.&rdquo; Mr.  Jaffray and his poetic sister of fifty, who quarrelled incessantly, hardly  suited the tastes of Mrs. Penworthy, as a daughter of the horse-leech and  intensely up-to-date. Nor did Graham, the Little England politician, enjoy the  company of Lord Sargon, a Tory, and a believer in the divine right of the last  legal descendant of the Stuarts. Also, the various young women and men, who  were really nobodies, and fancied themselves somebodies, found the parts they  were expected to take in an old-fashioned Christmas rather a bore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  season of peace and good-will,&rdquo; explained the Duke, after dinner, when this  collection of smartness and do wellness embellished the great drawing-room. &ldquo;We  must all love one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  company assented conventionally, and every one smiled violently on every one,  to the amusement of Lady Canvey. &ldquo;If this was the Palace of Truth,&rdquo; she  announced, &ldquo;there would be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the mellowing influence of the time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  so, Duke. But some people are like certain pears, they won&rsquo;t mellow&mdash;they only  become sleepy. And that reminds me,&rdquo; she added, looking round for Joan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go to bed soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  on Christmas Eve,&rdquo; urged the Duke, bending over her chair. &ldquo;We intend to keep  Yule-tide as our ancestors did&mdash;snap-dragon, the mummers, the Christmas-tree,  the carol-singers, and the ghost-stories.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one of them clever enough to tell a real ghost story,&rdquo; snapped Lady Canvey,  cynically examining faces old and young, made up and natural.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know a lovely, lovely tale,&rdquo; said Miss Jaffray, who was gowned girlishly in  white, trimmed oddly with ivy, and who looked like a ruin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will last till to-morrow morning,&rdquo; chimed in her brother, seeing an opportunity  of being nasty; &ldquo;snap-dragon is more fun. Eh, Lady Frith&mdash;you used to enjoy that  once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do so now&mdash;dear snap-dragon,&rdquo; said the Marchioness, who was sentimental and adored  her tall lean husband; &ldquo;but the Christmas-tree&mdash;oh, that is too sweet. Bunny and  I met for the first time under a Christmas-tree, and he fell in love with me.  Didn&rsquo;t you, Bunny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was rather hard on Lord Frith that he should be addressed by this most inappropriate  name. He was as stiff as a Spaniard, sad in his looks, and spoke little.  Although eminently well-bred, and clever in a political way, he was not a  genial personage. In this he differed from his father, for the Duke was stout  and kindly looking, beaming with good-humour, and quite the style of host who  would have figured in Sir Roger de Coverley&rsquo;s time. Report said that he had  been much too gay in his youth, and that the late Duchess had put up with a  great deal. Lady Canvey could have related stories about the Duke likely to be  much more entertaining than the proposed ghost-tales. But she was fond of her  host, who, like herself, was a link with the remote past, and never told  stories out of school. When she and the Duke got together, they wagged their  old heads over dead and done-with scandals, and lamented these days of vulgar  and blatant sin. But whatever their pasts may have been, they were an ideal  couple in the way of venerable looks and sweet old age. Quite a Philemon and  Baucis of modern times.</p>
  <p>Meantime,  &ldquo;Bunny&rdquo; scowled on his frivolous little wife, and then gave her a sentimental  smile. He was always torn between love and propriety, for Lady Frith, imitating  Dora, as Lady Jim averred, said the most exasperating things in a sweet treble.  He used to lecture her in private and explain what she should say; but these  corrections always ended in tears on the part of the child-wife, and in  complete surrender on the part of her doting husband. Lady Frith certainly  could play her part in society excellently well on occasions, and was more  shrewd than would have been guessed from her baby face and infantile manners.  But she wanted to be original, and therefore plagiarised from Dickens&rsquo; novel.  This assumption of an imaginary character she called &ldquo;possessing a personality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Penworthy was old wine in a new bottle: that is, she looked twenty-five, and  acted like an experienced coquette of double the age. Married to a modern Job,  called Freddy, whose meekness was proverbial, she led him about like a pet lamb  and taught him a few parlor tricks, so that people might say, &ldquo;What an attached  couple&rdquo;; which they did, tongue in cheek. A sweet look from Mrs. Penworthy  warmed Freddy&rsquo;s heart for four and twenty hours, even though the cost of the  merest glance sometimes ran into double figures. In his hours of leisure, which  were few, he frequently told her that she was an angel; but the expression did  not sound so agreeable on Freddy&rsquo;s lips, as on those of the half dozen nice  boys who constituted her court.</p>
  <p>She  went everywhere and knew everyone, and did the things she ought not to have  done, with discretion. Freddy thought her a playful kitten, quite blind to the  fact that she had grown rapidly into a cat. But with smiling looks and sheathed  claws, and Freddy&rsquo;s diamonds on her neck, she was a very pretty cat, and  blinked sleepily at those who admired her, so long as Freddy gave her a silken  cushion to rest on and plenty of cream to drink. Moreover, she only scratched  those who could not scratch back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really think it&rsquo;s awful fun,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penworthy to her court&mdash;&ldquo;all this sort  of thing, you know&mdash;holly and snow and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  mistletoe,&rdquo; suggested one of the nice boys.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  if you talk like that, Algy, you shan&rsquo;t be spoken to for a week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  look is enough for me,&rdquo; whispered the adoring Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naughty!  What would Freddy say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Canvey&rsquo;s sharp ears overheard the banter. &ldquo;Were I Freddy I know what I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo;  she murmured grimly; then aloud, to spoil sport, &ldquo;Is your husband here, Mrs.  Penworthy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Freddy?  Oh, dear me, no. He&rsquo;s gone to Paris, or Peru, or&mdash;I forget exactly where&mdash;but it&rsquo;s  something beginning with a &lsquo;P.&rsquo; Dear Freddy,&rdquo; she laid an entirely useless fan  on her lips, pensively, &ldquo;he works so very, very hard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  quite right too,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, bluntly, &ldquo;seeing what a devoted wife he  has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you don&rsquo;t know how Freddy tries me, dear Lady Canvey. I <i>am</i> devoted&mdash;that  I am. But, you see, I took Freddy for better or worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; corrected the old woman, tartly; &ldquo;you took the better, and Freddy took the  worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Penworthy, not being ready with an answer, murmured something about &ldquo;jealous  old thing,&rdquo; and moved away with her court to where Lord Sargon was holding  forth on his pet craze. &ldquo;If only our ancient kings were back,&rdquo; he said, but not  too loud, as the Duke might have disapproved of the disloyalty, &ldquo;Christmas  would be Christmas. In the good old times of the blessed martyr Charles&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bad old times,&rdquo; contradicted Mr. Graham; &ldquo;it was then that our beloved country  began to annex places which are useless. Let us give up everything beyond the  Channel, and attend to our own country. Then, indeed, Christmas will be  Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the parish pump will pour forth beer,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaffray, referring to the badge  of the Little Englander.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  the conduits ran wine in those sweet old days,&rdquo; sighed his sister, in her  poetic vein.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  people never washed,&rdquo; said a truculent old gentleman given to sanitation. &ldquo;What  I say is, let every house have a bath-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, Jim, is this going to last for ever?&rdquo; asked Leah, considerably bored by  these intellectual fireworks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  week, anyhow,&rdquo; replied Jim, who was feeling happy after a large dinner; &ldquo;but if  you will come to the Zoo, Leah, you mustn&rsquo;t find fault with th&rsquo; animals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are scarcely so interesting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  Animals don&rsquo;t talk, I &lsquo;spose you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do,&rdquo; retorted Lady Jim, calmly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Demetrius!&rdquo; and she left her husband  in the clutches of Mrs. Penworthy, with a whispered caution. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her go  too far, Jim. This week we&rsquo;re the respectable middle-class pair, who live in  slate-roofed houses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  did not quite understand, but he vaguely guessed that he was to keep Mrs.  Penworthy at a distance. For some minutes he did this, but she soon overcame  his scruples, and begged him to take her to the picture gallery. The discreet  court did not follow.</p>
  <p>Constantine  Demetrius was a small, dark, neat man with an ivory complexion, black hair, a  waxed moustache, and a stereotyped smile. He was dressed perfectly in a foreign  fashion, and placed his small feet together when he made his bow to Lady Jim.  His English was much better than his morals, and perhaps this was why Lady Jim  beckoned him to her side. Demetrius was one of her most ardent admirers, and  she had a vague idea of making use of him. At present she did not see how to  utilise his services, but if ever she required a thoroughly unscrupulous man,  she knew that she would need him. Besides, he was really a clever doctor, and  when Lady Jim was ill, she felt it would hasten the cure to think she was being  attended to for nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of all this?&rdquo; she asked him, when they were snugly bestowed in a  cosy corner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very English,&rdquo; said the Russian, with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means very dull!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  clicked his heels together and made a bow from the middle of his body. &ldquo;At  present I cannot say so,&rdquo; said he, gallantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you wouldn&rsquo;t, if you thought so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,  the truth to a ravishing woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  like sunshine to a coal-miner: we get it so rarely. By the way, how is  Mademoiselle Aksakoff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  as pretty as ever?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see nothing of beauty but what is before me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same, you will leave me and marry Mademoiselle Aksakoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  looked at Lady Jim with such fire in his dark eyes that she felt slightly  uncomfortable in spite of her courageous nature. It was easy to play with the  hearts of phlegmatic Englishmen, but to amuse herself with this fiery Slav was  like trifling with a tiger. Nevertheless, Lady Jim, with a view to future  contingencies, allured him with sweet looks, and tantalised him with  half-granted favours. Katinka Aksakoff, the daughter of a Russian official  attached to the Embassy, loved Demetrius even to the extent of helping him to  escape the lures of the secret police, which would have drawn him to the  Continent, <i>en route</i> for Siberia. Therefore she hated Lady Jim, because  that astute diplomatist kept Demetrius dangling at her skirts in the bonds of a  never-to-be-requited love, on the chance that some day she might require him.  And the Russian knew that Leah Kaimes was a woman who wanted all for nothing,  but, if possible, he intended to make his own bargain with her. Lady Jim was  clever, but Demetrius thought he could entangle her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur  Demetrius,&rdquo; she said after a pause, during which the fire died out of the  Russian&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;if you wanted money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would get it,&rdquo; said he, determinedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if you saw no way of getting it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would make the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t make bricks without straw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clever  people can,&rdquo; replied Demetrius, dryly.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim looked down at her rings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you clever?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  benefit some people I might be,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.</p>
  <p>She  stared straight before her, and noted that Lionel was chatting with Miss  Tallentire. As yet the curate had not spoken with the Duke, so that was a  quarter yet to be tried. Nevertheless, Lady Jim had a shrewd idea, in spite of  the comedy being played by herself and Jim, and of Lionel&rsquo;s pleading, that the  Duke would be adamant. It behoved her to have another string to her bow, and  this she could find in Demetrius. But she did not know yet to what use she  could put him. It was impossible to ask him to sway the Duke, strong as his  influence was with that gouty nobleman. Lady Jim had a good deal of what she  called pride, and did not intend to let Demetrius know her true position, if  she could help it.</p>
  <p>Before  she could say anything, and really she did not know what to say, the Duke gave  the signal for the commencement of the Christmas festivities. These were strong  in intention, but weak in execution. The company burnt their fingers over  snap-dragon, capered in Sir Roger de Coverley, tempted the Fates with roasting  chestnuts, and finally adjourned to a large hall, where glittered a splendid  Christmas-tree.</p>
  <p>Then  danced in the mummers, villagers all, tricked out as Robin Hood and Maid  Marian, as the Terrible Turk, Santa Claus, St. George and the Dragon&mdash;a most  meek beast&mdash;and with hordes of merry, laughing children. The Christmas-tree  dropped its costly, many-coloured fruits into expectant laps, and a chorus of  praise hymned the munificence of the gratified Duke. Even Lady Jim thanked him  for the dainty gold-net purse which she received, and if she did peep in slyly  to see whether it was lined with a cheque or a bank-note, that was only out of  compliment to her father-in-law&rsquo;s known generosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santa  Claus has not got a banking account,&rdquo; she murmured to her husband.</p>
  <p>Jim,  who was scowling at his gift,&mdash;a set of sleeve-links enamelled with the four  vices&mdash;women, cards, drink, and racing,&mdash;growled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  got a dashed lot of impertinence. As if I&rsquo;d wear these things!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Leah, tickled by the implied rebuke, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t do to wear your heart on  your sleeve&mdash;links&rdquo;: a witticism which was entirely lost on Jim. He was one of  the many obtuse swine who trampled on Leah&rsquo;s pearls.</p>
  <p>What  with eating and drinking, and professing seasonable sentiments which certainly  did not come from the heart, everyone became bored and bilious and fractious.  Leah surveyed the yawning revellers with a feeling that Christmas, old style,  was a failure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t arrange an orgy,&rdquo; was her comment to Lady Canvey, &ldquo;it must come by  chance, to be successful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think Pentland intended anything so disreputable,&rdquo; retorted the old dame,  &ldquo;consequently you are disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bored,&rdquo;  Lady Jim assured her. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s eating plum pudding which always makes me  dull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not good-natured.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  digestion has its limits. Good night, godmother; I suppose it&rsquo;s time for you to  be taken to pieces,&rdquo; and having stricken Lady Canvey dumb with rage, she  slipped away to bed, wondering what would happen before next Christmas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  must be done,&rdquo; she thought, wearily climbing the stairs. &ldquo;If Lionel fails with  the Duke, Demetrius might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Might  what? She did not know. But she really did feel that something might be done  with Demetrius.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5</b> </h2>
  <p>A  congregation drawn to the Church of All Angels, by various inducements, filled  it to overflowing the next morning. Some came because it was Christmas Day,  others to hear Lionel Kaimes preach; many desired to see the ducal party, and  one or two presented themselves in God&rsquo;s house to thank Him for the gift of His  Son, sent to save a dying world. Knowing the Duke&rsquo;s old age impeccability,  nearly all his guests were present and filled three large pews, to the  wondering awe of the villagers and their wives. These last, especially, were  distracted by the splendour of the ladies&rsquo; dresses, and the variety of the new  fashions. Many laudable imitations of those marvellous frocks were visible in  country lane and village street before Easter.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim and her husband discreetly sat in the body of the church, some distance  from the pulpit, as Leah did not wish to come under the curate&rsquo;s eye. She  thought he was quite capable of preaching at her, in which case a natural  resentment would have led to a quarrel, prejudicial to the exercise of Lionel&rsquo;s  good offices with the Duke. Moreover, Leah, occupied with her own thoughts, did  not want to be distracted by a sermon of religious platitudes. She stood up and  sat down mechanically, looking too flamboyant to be in harmony with the  simplicity of the building. Tucked into the opening of her &ldquo;Incroyable&rdquo; coat,  claret-coloured and with strikingly large buttons, she wore a cup-shaped  nosegay of white and pink orchids. Her hat was large, with many feathers of the  new Titian red, and resembled nothing in nature. She did not wear jewellery,  but the vivid colours of her dress made up for the absence of gems. There was  something tropical about Leah, and in that chill grey church she glowed like a  gorgeous flower, all splendour and perfume and radiant vitality. Her exuberant  beauty and colour attracted even the attention of Jim. He bent forward, when  the prayer for the King&rsquo;s Majesty was being said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you&rsquo;re enjoyin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; muttered Jim, resentfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H-sh-s-s-s!&rdquo;  breathed Leah, devoutly, and knelt in a saintly attitude which was far from  expressing her real feelings. For the moment she did not pray herself, or think  of the prayer that was being offered. Her thoughts were busy with bills and  duns and Jim&rsquo;s defects, and the chances that Demetrius might prove useful. And  when she did murmur a prayer, it was one of those which are rarely answered,  or, if answered, turn to the confusion of the suppliant. Plenty of money, no  trouble, much enjoyment, and the destruction of her enemies, were the elements  which composed this remarkable petition. Lady Jim was not very clear as to whom  she was asking, but she had a vague feeling, which she mistook for religion,  that there might be Some One who could give her what she required. Moreover, it  was just as well to be on the safe side. Yet, even as she tried the experiment,  the earthly superstition asserted itself, and she carefully fingered a peacock&rsquo;s  feather inside her muff. This serving of God and a fetish may seem ridiculous  in a woman of Leah&rsquo;s capacity. Nevertheless, she devoutly believed that if the  unseen Deity did not help her, the seen Baal would. And after all, was there  not a cat of Heine&rsquo;s acquaintance, who made genuflections before a  pink-ribboned flageolet? But cats, as the poet remarks, are so superstitious.  And Leah the pantheress was of the feline tribe.</p>
  <p>Having  made herself safe with the Unknown, Lady Jim joined in the ensuing hymn  bravely. She thought the words dreary and the tune barbarous, but the fervour  of her deep contralto voice reached the Duke&rsquo;s ears, and he gave her an  approving glance; so that was something gained. Leah would have gone through  the whole collection of Ancient and Modern to learn the precise meaning of that  look, but she was satisfied with guessing, and sat down cheerfully to be bored  with the sermon. It occurred to her that the prayer had been heard, and would  probably be granted. But whether by the peacock&rsquo;s feather, or the Deity of whom  Lionel now began to speak, she could not determine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  His name shall be called Wonderful&rdquo;&mdash;this was the curate&rsquo;s text, and he  discoursed on it in a simple and impressive way. Speaking of the birth of  Christ, of His teaching and plan of salvation, of His self-denying life and  unwearying kindness, the young man&rsquo;s grave and tender periods shamed the most  inattentive into thoughtfulness. Lionel was not a born orator, but he was very  much in earnest, and preached with an emphasis which carried undeniable  conviction. Mrs. Penworthy felt suddenly virtuous, and resolved to repeat as  much of the sermon as she could remember to Freddy, so that he might not  grumble so much over what the silly thing called &ldquo;her extravagance.&rdquo; Even Lady  Canvey wagged her aged head, and thought that she might help a few deserving  paupers, if their needs could be supplied in moderation. Leah herself was  impressed, to the extent of hoping that the Duke would see that it behoved him  to fill the empty pockets of a deserving and pretty daughter-in-law. Jim would  have approved of this sentiment, but all the time he was fast asleep, and woke  up cross when she pinched him to rise for the Doxology.</p>
  <p>Beyond  a stray sentence here and there, Leah had not paid much attention: she had  heard it all before, though some of the sentiments were new, and, as she  thought, ridiculous. When the preacher was fairly started she relapsed into her  own thoughts. These being unpleasant, she permitted her hard eyes to wander  round the church. After a wondering gaze at the extraordinary fashions of the  women, and a patronising examination of the decorations, she caught sight of a  face belonging to a young man on the other side of the aisle. He was so like  Jim that she involuntarily turned to see if her husband still slumbered  placidly by her side. The double was dressed in grey tweeds and looked almost  like a gentleman. He stooped a trifle, in spite of his square shoulders and  stalwart figure, and every now and then coughed painfully. Apparently he was  ill with some pulmonary complaint, which the freezing atmosphere of the church  accentuated. Leah wondered at the resemblance, and thought of certain  traditionary stories concerning the youthful days of the Duke. But after a  second glance she decided that perhaps there was nothing in it. Jim was of a  pink-and-white, bovine, commonplace type, and there were hundreds like him in  manners and morals and looks. Moreover, she was so weary of seeing Jim&rsquo;s inane  face over the breakfast-cups that she did not care to gaze at the imitation.  Nevertheless, being a woman with the orthodox share of Eve&rsquo;s curiosity, she  resolved to ask questions about this consumptive double. Mrs. Arthur, the  Firmingham housekeeper, could doubtless tell some story, as she knew much more  about the Duke than had ever appeared, even in the most scurrilous society paper.  And Lady Jim knew how to make her talk.</p>
  <p>When  the plate circled, Leah quadrupled Jim&rsquo;s half-crown, and he did not approve  when the piece of gold jingled amongst the silver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  been borrowin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Jim accused her in an angry whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Praise  God, from Whom all blessings flow,&rdquo; sang Leah, without replying; and put her  whole heart and voice into the hymn in the hope that some of the blessings  might trickle her way. And why not, seeing that she had baited her hook with a  sprat to catch the much-needed mackerel? But it was useless to explain this to  Jim. He would not have understood such lavish fishing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was really too lovely,&rdquo; Mrs. Penworthy assured the Duke at luncheon. &ldquo;Mr.  Kaimes spoke just the things I feel. And the decorations&mdash;oh, really&mdash;so very tasteful.  But the mistletoe, Duke. I don&rsquo;t think there should have been mistletoe round  the pulpit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  an immoral plant,&rdquo; chimed in Lady Canvey, with sharp, twinkling eyes; &ldquo;and so  useless to some people, who can dispense with it as an excuse. I daresay the  Druids were no better than they should have been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were before my time,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penworthy, very prettily; &ldquo;and you must have  been quite a child then, dear Lady Canvey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sermon affected Lady Frith in another fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear Bunny,&rdquo; she said to her saturnine husband, &ldquo;what a lovely way Lionel puts  things! Do let us help people. There&rsquo;s Leah, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  assented Frith, dryly. &ldquo;I do know, and for that reason I don&rsquo;t intend to waste  money in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Lionel talked of aiding the poor and needy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doesn&rsquo;t include the extravagant and ungrateful,&rdquo; retorted her lord. &ldquo;You are an  unsophisticated child, Hilda.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Bunny, how could you call poor Leah and her husband names? We must love every  one at this season.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll love them as much as you please; but not to the extent of supporting them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Plainly  there was nothing to be got out of Frith, as Lady Jim decided when the  Marchioness reported a part of this conversation later in the day. But she  attempted to soften the Marquis by saying things which she knew the child-wife  would babble again to her hard-hearted husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim  and I don&rsquo;t want money, dear,&rdquo; she said, kissing Lady Frith; &ldquo;so long as Frith  is nice to us, we don&rsquo;t care. You have your position to keep up, and we are  nothing. But it was sweet of you to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; prattled Hilda, in her childish way. &ldquo;I want every one to love me, ever so  much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure they do. Isn&rsquo;t Frith jealous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  nearly jealous as a perfect man can be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought perfect men had no imperfection,&rdquo; retorted Lady Jim, ironically; &ldquo;but  it&rsquo;s all right, dear,&rdquo; another kiss&mdash;&ldquo;we must bear our cross, as Lionel said  this morning. Now I must go to see old Mrs. Arthur. One must be good to one&rsquo;s  inferiors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  result of this conversation was, that Lady Frith told her husband of Leah&rsquo;s  pointedly correct humbleness; whereat the marquis laughed shortly. He quite  understood Lady Jim&rsquo;s tactics, and was resolved that they should not succeed.  Frith was one of the few men Lady Jim had never fascinated, and she hated to be  under his clear-sighted gaze. If Hilda could have heard Leah&rsquo;s inward remarks  as she proceeded to the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, she would scarcely have given so  favourable a report.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  day, Mrs. Arthur,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, to the old-fashioned dame in the black silk  and lace cap, who rose to drop a prim curtsey. &ldquo;I have come to wish you the  compliments of the season.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, my lady. Won&rsquo;t you be seated?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim selected the most comfortable chair in the quaint small room, and graciously  requested the housekeeper to resume her seat. Then she asked about Mrs. Arthur&rsquo;s  cough, and her sailor son, and her married daughter, and after various other  things in which she did not feel the least interest. The old woman, much  impressed with Leah&rsquo;s condescension, and not sufficiently clever to see through  her arts, expanded like a winter rose in this aristocratic sunshine. In a few  minutes she was chatting quite at her ease, and with the discursive  garrulousness of old age. This was the unguarded mood Leah desired for the  satisfaction of her curiosity, and having created it by an appearance of the  deepest interest in Mrs. Arthur&rsquo;s domestic small-beer chronicles, she proceeded  to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  service was delightful this morning,&rdquo; she observed; &ldquo;the decorations were  charming and the congregation so attentive. I suppose you know every one in the  village, Mrs. Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ought to, my lady. I am Firmingham bred and born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a very good representative of the place,&rdquo; said Leah, kindly. &ldquo;The villagers are  really quite nice-looking&mdash;especially the men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you saw my son&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  he in church this morning?&rdquo; asked Lady Jim, who knew very well that the young  man was with his ship in Chinese waters. &ldquo;I saw rather a handsome young fellow  in one of the pews, but he looked ill. Of course, I thought him handsome,&rdquo; she  went on carelessly, and with a soft laugh: &ldquo;he was the image of my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Arthur looked rather nervous. &ldquo;There is only one young man hereabouts who  resembles Lord James,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;and I do not wonder you saw the likeness,  my lady. Harold Garth is like Lord James now, and is such as his Grace was in  his youth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Leah&rsquo;s eyes opened. &ldquo;Do you mean to say&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  my lady&mdash;nothing&rdquo;; and Mrs. Arthur&rsquo;s hands fiddled nervously with the gold chain  she wore round her neck. Then, woman-like, she went on to contradict herself. &ldquo;Harold  Garth has lately returned from Canada, where he went to farm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garth?  I seem to know the name!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know who can have mentioned it to you, my lady. He is the only Garth in  the district, and I daresay you never saw him before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  no; I must admit that I never have. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Canada,&rdquo;  explained Mrs. Arthur, vaguely. &ldquo;He has been there for the last twenty years.  He went out to make money, at the age of fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  has apparently returned with consumption.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  poor lad; but the Duke is very kind to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim laughed meaningly. &ldquo;Oh, the Duke is very kind to him, is he? That&rsquo;s so like  the Duke. Always thoughtful. Fifteen and twenty&mdash;he is about thirty-five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  or less, my lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  husband&rsquo;s age,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, pointedly. &ldquo;Yes, my lady,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Arthur,  closing her lips firmly.</p>
  <p>Leah  tried another question. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t this young man&rsquo;s family keep him instead  of letting the Duke support him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harold  Garth has no family, my lady. His mother is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  his father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Arthur looked down. &ldquo;I know nothing about his father,&rdquo; she said in low tones. &ldquo;Harold  is a lonely man, poor soul. He lives at the Pentland Arms, and Mrs. Kibby, the  landlady, is as kind to him as though he were her own son. And his Grace&mdash;bless  him&mdash;does all he can to smooth Harold&rsquo;s way to the grave. He sent that foreign  doctor to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius,&rdquo;  said Lady Jim, quickly. &ldquo;Oh, so Demetrius knows him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  my lady. He thinks he can cure him of this consumption. I do not think so  myself&rdquo; proceeded Mrs. Arthur, garrulously, &ldquo;for Harold is booked for death.  You can see it in his face. I believe his Grace wants him to go to a warmer  climate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a deep interest the Duke takes in this man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Arthur looked up suddenly, and a flush dyed her withered cheek. The eyes of the  two women met, and the situation was adjusted without words. After that  interchange of glances Leah knew, as well as if Mrs. Arthur had explained at  length, that Harold had ducal blood in his veins. &ldquo;And that is why he is so  like Jim,&rdquo; she thought, rising to go. &ldquo;I hope the poor fellow will get well,&rdquo;  she said aloud; &ldquo;but really, he was foolish to venture into that cold church.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think he minds if he is dead or alive, my lady. He has no friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, the Duke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  his Grace, who is a friend to all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arthur loyally.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim laughed, and went away. She had learned all she wished to learn, but,  beyond satisfying a passing curiosity, had no desire to pursue the subject.  Still, she thought it would amuse her to ask Demetrius a few questions  concerning this patient, and went in search of him. Somehow the subject of  Harold Garth and his resemblance to Jim took hold of her imagination, and she  could not put it out of her head. While she was thinking of other matters, the  thought of the strange likeness&mdash;now fully accounted for&mdash;would slip in, and she  would find herself pondering. Afterwards she declared that this insistence of a  passing thought was the work of Providence, for so she called the  peacock-feather Baal she served.</p>
  <p>Demetrius  was not in the house, having been called out to see some one who was ill in the  village. So Lionel assured her, and moreover supplied her with the name of the  patient. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a young fellow called Harold Garth,&rdquo; he said gravely; &ldquo;he  foolishly came to church this morning, and, being already ill, is worse from  having ventured out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never heard a parson call going to church foolishness before,&rdquo; said Lady Jim,  surprised that the subject should crop up again in so unexpected a manner. &ldquo;Who  is Harold Garth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  prot&eacute;ge of the Duke&rsquo;s. He has just returned from Canada,&rdquo; said the curate,  simply; &ldquo;and, curiously enough, he is rather like the Kaimes family. Perhaps  that is why the Duke is so kind to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it is,&rdquo; said Leah, wondering how much Lionel guessed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw  him,&rdquo; she added, mendaciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you did you would mistake him for your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  awful!&rdquo; shuddered Leah. &ldquo;As though one Jim wasn&rsquo;t enough to be bothered with.  But can&rsquo;t we talk of something more interesting&mdash;your sermon, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust you found that interesting,&rdquo; said Lionel, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t too long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see&rdquo;&mdash;dryly&mdash;&ldquo;you judge the interest of a sermon by its length.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no&mdash;really, I quite enjoyed your preaching.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t preach that people may enjoy, but that they may think seriously of what  they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I think seriously enough, Lionel. Have you spoken to the Duke? No? I wish  you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow.  This is Christmas Day, remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if I could forget, with all the nonsense that&rsquo;s going on here,&rdquo; retorted Lady  Jim, glancing superciliously round at the decorations. &ldquo;Every one is overdoing  the brotherly business. I quite expected my maid to tell me that she loved me.  And I don&rsquo;t see why you shouldn&rsquo;t ask the Duke to-day. You&rsquo;ll squeeze the money  out of him the more easily while he&rsquo;s got this Christmassy emotion on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t squeeze money out of people,&rdquo; said Kaimes, stiffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a large income you must have, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  live within it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  nothing to boast of. I&rsquo;d live within mine, if I had ten thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt it,&rdquo; replied Lionel, who could not help laughing at her coolness; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d  spend fifty thousand if you had it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather&mdash;if  I were the Duchess of Pentland. But there&rsquo;s no chance of such luck. Frith&rsquo;s too  healthy. Do smile again, Lionel&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got such nice teeth, and look quite a  good sort when you let yourself go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  am I to smile at?&rdquo; asked the curate, with deliberate austerity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  me, and on me. I put ten shillings into the plate this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  was a thoroughly good young man, and had a great sense of the dignity of his  cloth and the responsibility of his position. But he also possessed humour, and  could not help retorting after the style of a certain witty bishop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the smallest fire insurance I ever heard of,&rdquo; said he, genially, and moved  away, leaving Lady Jim amused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t think he had so much fun in him,&rdquo; she thought, making for the library; &ldquo;but  the speech is too clever to be original&rdquo;&mdash;which showed that Leah suspected the  existence of the witty bishop.</p>
  <p>But  the word insurance put her mind on Jim&rsquo;s mad idea to pretend death and cheat  the company out of twenty thousand pounds, with accumulations. Leah devoutly  wished that the trick could be managed. Its success meant a clearance of debt  and of Jim, when the millennium would come, and, as Mrs. Nickleby&rsquo;s admirer put  it, &ldquo;all would be gas and gaiters.&rdquo; She resolved to have another chat with Jim  on the subject, and meantime went to seek for a novel. After boring herself  with Mrs. Arthur and Lionel, she wished to read away a well-earned hour of  peace.</p>
  <p>But  this for the moment she was not destined to enjoy. The library was empty, save  for the presence of the last person whom Lady Jim wished to encounter. When  Miss Jaffray looked up from a gigantic volume with an almost toothless smile,  Leah turned to fly. But the old maid arrested her flight with a joyful shout.  She usually did shout, as her brother was slightly deaf, which deceived her  into thinking the entire human race was likewise afflicted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  sweet of you to come here,&rdquo; shouted Miss Jaffray. &ldquo;I am just dying for some one  to talk to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  the decision had been left to Lady Jim, she would have gladly avoided the talk,  to bring about this result. But it occurred to her scheming mind that this dull  spinster was wealthy, and might be cajoled or frightened into lending money.  Leah did not specify the sum, even in her own mind, as she did not know how  much more this virgin soil would yield, if properly worked. Sitting down  promptly, she began to chat on the first subject that came into her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you reading so earnestly?&rdquo; she asked sweetly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>,&rdquo; said the spinster, fondling the ponderous tome which  her weak knees could hardly support.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo;  thought Lady Jim, with a charming smile, meaning nothing, &ldquo;am I to be bored  with another Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  black-letter edition,&rdquo; went on Miss Jaffray, in a loud and oratorical voice. &ldquo;Most  interesting. So sweet to think of those dear dead days, when knights went about  as troubadours with guitars in steel armour, dying for queens of beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delightful,&rdquo;  assented Lady Jim, yawning at the dullness of the picture; &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;with a  disparaging glance at the lettering&mdash;&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it rather like reading a German  newspaper? I prefer novels myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I, when not in a poetic humour,&rdquo; shouted her companion. &ldquo;All the old, old  masters of fiction. Dickens, Bulwer-Lytton, Wilkie Collins. I love them all&mdash;every  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  seem to know those names,&rdquo; ventured Leah, carefully. &ldquo;What did they write, Miss  Jaffray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  spinster gasped. Brought up in a library, she could not understand this  fashionable ignorance, which, truth to say, was partially assumed. Leah was by  no means the ignoramus she made herself out to be. But, for the sake of  business, she thought it judicious to foster Miss Jaffray&rsquo;s vanity by assuming  an inferior position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you ever read?&rdquo; asked Miss Jaffray, in the voice of Goliath challenging the army  of Saul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes; society newspapers, and French novels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they are so improper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  amusing is improper to my mind,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, calmly; &ldquo;and I really did skim  through a page or two of Dickens. Horribly dull, I thought him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Miss Jaffray gasped again. &ldquo;He did so much good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  that is why his books are dull. Thoroughly good people are invariably&mdash;&rdquo; Here  she discreetly pulled the reins, as Miss Jaffray, considering herself good,  might not relish the malicious witticism, presuming she could understand it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take you as my instructor, dear Miss Jaffray,&rdquo; added Leah, stifling another  yawn. &ldquo;Do tell me what to read.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  Wilkie Collins&rsquo;s <i>Armadale</i>,&rdquo; said the old maid, delighted at being put  into the pulpit; &ldquo;but you may think me rude for recommending that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a character in it so like you, in appearance,&rdquo; apologised Miss Jaffray; &ldquo;in  appearance only, you will understand. I should be sorry indeed to think that in  morals you resembled Miss Gwilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss&mdash;how  much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gwilt.  G-w-i-l-t,&rdquo; spelt the spinster&mdash;&ldquo;the strange name of a strange woman. She&rsquo;s the  character I spoke of. No, really you mightn&rsquo;t like her. She was&mdash;well&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;disreputable.  Better begin with <i>The Woman in White</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I have heard of that. What is it about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  striking resemblance between two women. One is passed off by her wicked husband  as the other, and buried&mdash;to get money, you understand&mdash;a kind of fraud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  turned cold and hot. It sounded as though this simple woman was explaining the  contemplated deceit of herself and Jim. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should like that book  at all,&rdquo; she said, diplomatically cunning; &ldquo;it sounds dull. I would rather read  about the naughty woman&mdash;Miss&mdash;what&rsquo;s-her-name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  in yonder bookshelf,&rdquo; said Miss Jaffray, pointing a lean finger to the end of  the room, &ldquo;along with the rest of the master&rsquo;s novels. But please don&rsquo;t think  that I fancy you resemble Miss Gwilt&rsquo;s moral character. You certainly have her  auburn hair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Red  hair,&rdquo; corrected Lady Jim, rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather proud of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ought to be,&rdquo; said the old maid, with simple admiration, and rising to put away  her tome. &ldquo;I can imagine you a queen of beauty in the dear old tournaments,  with knights at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  many are there now, without tournaments,&rdquo; said Leah, with superb  self-confidence; &ldquo;but I prefer men of higher rank than knights. Though I will  say,&rdquo; she added generously, &ldquo;that men who have won knighthood are cleverer than  those donkeys who inherit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  this was Greek to Miss Jaffray, and after putting away her volume she departed,  with a final recommendation about Miss Gwilt. Lady Jim walked to where Wilkie  Collins&rsquo;s novels lined the shelf, and&mdash;needless to say&mdash;selected <i>The Woman in  White</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if I can make fact out of fiction?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6"></a>Chapter 6</b> </h2>
  <p>It  was Jim&rsquo;s custom to saunter into his wife&rsquo;s bedroom, before descending to make  a hearty meal, and complain that he had rested badly. This was a pleasing  fiction, as he slept like a dormouse, and snored steadily through the hours he  allotted to sleep without even a dream. But on entering for his morning  grumble, he was so surprised to find Leah in her dressing-gown before a brisk  fire, with a breakfast at her elbow and a book open on her lap, that he forgot  his egotism. Jim could scarcely believe his lazy eyes, for he knew well that  Leah was no student.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  up?&rdquo; he asked, after pausing at the door to say &ldquo;By Jupiter!&rdquo; with every  appearance of surprise. &ldquo;Got a headache?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I had, should I cure it with a novel?&rdquo; asked his wife, disdainfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Jim, with the matutinal good-humour of a healthy  animal. &ldquo;Doctors recommend such rum things nowadays. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;m  off to feed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  for ten minutes, Jim. I have something to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not goin&rsquo; to read, are you? I can&rsquo;t stand readin&rsquo; on a empty stom&mdash;well, on  nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever heard of <i>The Woman in White?</i>&rdquo; asked Leah, irrelevantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  who is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a novel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  read &lsquo;em. Real life&rsquo;s much more fun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim looked at him steadily. &ldquo;We might turn this&rdquo;&mdash;she touched the book lightly&mdash;&ldquo;into  real life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo;  to make a play of it?&rdquo; questioned Jim, obtusely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you might call it a comedy,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I certainly do not want it to be a  tragedy&mdash;though it might come to that,&rdquo; she ended in a lower tone.</p>
  <p>Jim  opened his puzzled blue eyes. &ldquo;Want of breakfast, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; he ruminated, &ldquo;but  I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  passed a white night,&rdquo; announced his wife, abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  French expression for a wakeful night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you say it in English, and how can&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  useless wasting French on a man who understands only the argot of the <i>trottoir</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  wastin&rsquo; it now. A wakeful night&mdash;eh? Why didn&rsquo;t you try that new sedative  Demetrius gave you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t want to sleep. This book was too interesting. I wish you to read it&rdquo;;  and she extended the novel to her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!!!&rdquo;  If she had offered poison Jim could not have betrayed more abhorrence. &ldquo;Read?  You&mdash;want&mdash;me&mdash;to&mdash;read?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you know words of two syllables, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she retorted impatiently. &ldquo;Take  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  handled the book as though it were a scorpion, turning over a hundred leaves  rapidly. &ldquo;Love an&rsquo; diaries, and&mdash;oh, bosh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all, unless bosh is your word for common sense. I see a chance of getting  that money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  made an impatient movement. &ldquo;How dense you are! The insurance money, of course&mdash;the  twenty thousand pounds. Suppose you died&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop  it. I told you I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you told me that you might pretend to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I was only talkin&rsquo;. You don&rsquo;t want me to be buried alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wouldn&rsquo;t be much good,&rdquo; said his wife, with a shrug. &ldquo;We must have a genuine  corpse&mdash;like you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  inkling of her meaning stole into Jim&rsquo;s dull brain, and he sat down suddenly. &ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; said he, hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harold  Garth is like you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  the&mdash;what the&mdash;you saw him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  church yesterday. He&rsquo;s ill with consumption, dying they say. Demetrius attends  him. Supposing&mdash;supposing&rdquo;&mdash;her imagination made her cheeks flush&mdash;&ldquo;supposing&mdash;oh,  you understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sluggish comprehension of the man grasped her hinted scheme suddenly, and his  eyes lighted up. &ldquo;Supposing he died and was buried in place of me, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t suppose I mean murder, do you?&rdquo; she cried, rising to the height of her  tall figure and speaking irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would if there was money in it,&rdquo; said Jim, grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would be a natural death,&rdquo; went on Leah, rapidly, and pacing the room to  relieve the strain on her nerves. &ldquo;The poor fellow can&rsquo;t live long. If he died,  and was buried as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  go,&rdquo; contradicted Jim, rising in his turn. &ldquo;Every one about here knows of the  likeness; for which,&rdquo; he added slowly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I learned yesterday from Mrs. Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  was indignant. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean to tell you that I gathered the truth from what she left unsaid. You don&rsquo;t  suppose that I require words to explain things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s to be managed,&rdquo; said Kaimes, reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it could be, would you surrender everything and&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I would, for a quarter of the money. Then I&rsquo;d go out of your life an&rsquo; to Lima&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lima,&rdquo;  said Lady Jim, stopping suddenly. &ldquo;Why to Lima? You&rsquo;ve been there three times  since we married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  end of a place, Lima,&rdquo; muttered Jim, feebly.</p>
  <p>His  wife looked at his colouring face attentively, and laughed in a short, rasping  manner. An idea had occurred to her which she did not think it necessary to  impart to Jim. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re legally dead,&rdquo; she said sharply, &ldquo;I shall have no  control over your life or movements. All I want to know is, if this business  can be managed, will you do your share by disappearing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but I don&rsquo;t see how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  that book, Jim, and you&rsquo;ll understand better. It gave me the idea, though our  plot will be different in many ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Jim, tucking the novel under his arm, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dip into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  let any one see you reading, and replace it in the library without any one  knowing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  fool,&rdquo; snarled Leah, viciously; &ldquo;if this thing is to be carried through safely,  no suspicion must rest on either of us. Do you suppose that I have spoken to  this double of yours, or have let any one know that I have read the book? I don&rsquo;t  think it really matters much, as people are too stupid to see things; but it is  just as well to be on the safe side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t see how&mdash;&rdquo; began Kaimes again, and again she cut him short.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do&mdash;I do. Demetrius attends this young fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  and he&mdash;Demetrius, I mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  me to deal with him,&rdquo; she said confidently.</p>
  <p>Jim  flung the book on the floor, and looked at her with clenched hands. &ldquo;What is this  Demetrius to you?&rdquo; he asked violently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  puppet I can pull the strings of,&rdquo; she retorted; &ldquo;and be good enough to  remember that you are not in a training-stable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that beastly little Tartar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Jim,&rdquo; said his wife coolly, &ldquo;if you ask me about Demetrius, I shall  certainly ask you about Lima.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kaimes  was taken aback. &ldquo;Lima,&rdquo; he stammered, flushing to the roots of his fair hair. &ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that you can trust me to ask no questions, if you will mind your own  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you are my wife, Demetrius is my business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think  of me as your widow then,&rdquo; she mocked, &ldquo;and that I can&rsquo;t be without the aid of  Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  can&rsquo;t you speak plainly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might ask you the same question, but&rdquo;&mdash;she picked up the novel and thrust it  into Jim&rsquo;s unwilling hands&mdash;&ldquo;I fancy you and I understand one another pretty  well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t have any man making love to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good,&rdquo; said Leah, calmly; &ldquo;then you must remain a pauper, and my husband. I&rsquo;m  not going to all this trouble to share you with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  with whom?&mdash;out with it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you can answer that question best, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  my honour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pah!&rdquo;  she said with disgust. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better leave honour out of this shady  business we are about to embark in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  really mean to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really mean to get that twenty thousand pounds!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  lose me,&rdquo; Jim reminded her uneasily.</p>
  <p>Leah  made a grimace. &ldquo;My loss is another&rsquo;s gain,&rdquo; she said significantly. &ldquo;Now go  away, Jim. I have to dress in my best frock in order to fascinate Demetrius&rdquo;;  and she vanished into her dressing-room with a provoking laugh.</p>
  <p>Lord  Jim said something about Demetrius that involved the use of unprintable  language. Then he slipped the book into the pocket of his shooting-jacket and  lumbered downstairs. In spite of his squabbling with Leah, and the existence of  some one in Lima, he was furiously jealous of Demetrius, and scowled at the  Russian when they met. Demetrius rather liked that scowl, as he guessed the  reason, and took it as a tribute to his fascinations. If he had known Lady Jim&rsquo;s  real intentions, and that she intended to convert English rather than French  fiction into everyday facts, he might not have smiled so victoriously over his  coffee. But Demetrius made the fatal mistake of so many clever men: he knew he  was clever, and thereby was not what he fancied himself to be. The true secret  of success lies, not in knowing how clever oneself is, but how stupid other  people are.</p>
  <p>While  Jim was growling over his provender, Miss Tallentire, who had finished her  breakfast, slipped out of the room. She felt strange in the company of the  frumps and fashionables which formed the house-party. Certainly the frumps were  eating in private, and would not appear till the world was well-aired, and they  had been &ldquo;made-up&rdquo; sufficiently well to prevent the younger generation being  shocked. But the fashionable people came to breakfast in public, and Joan found  the talk far above her comprehension. These languid creatures, who ate so  little and talked so much, were like inhabitants of a strange planet, and it was  with great relief that the girl found herself passed over. Of course, nobody  thought of noticing Cinderella in her rags.</p>
  <p>As  Lady Canvey was being rehabilitated by a skilful maid, and would not be seen as  the world knew her for at least two hours, Joan had this time to herself. The  brightness of the day tempted her to assume hat and jacket for a morning walk,  and she was shortly tripping over the crisp snow of the avenue. The glorious  sunshine, the keen air, the dazzling whiteness of the snow, and the generally  invigorating influence of this ideal winter morning stirred the current of her  blood to nimbleness. Joan began to sing softly, and could hardly keep from  dancing, so rapidly did her spirits mount skyward. At length, the place being  solitary and she being recklessly young, a sudden impulse sent her flying like  an arrow between the grim firs. Near the gates she shot directly into the arms  of a man, and uttered an ejaculation. This was hardly to be wondered at, seeing  that the arms closed tightly round her, and a pair of warm lips deepened the  colour which exercise had brought to her cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lionel!&rdquo;  cried Joan; and &ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; replied Lionel, which sufficiently explains the  feeling which existed between Lady Canvey&rsquo;s companion and Lady Canvey&rsquo;s pet.</p>
  <p>These  two babies, as the old lady called them, had been engaged for six months, but  the fact was not generally known. The clerical parent of Joan had given his  consent, on the understanding that Lionel was to possess a better income and  the best vicarage obtainable before he made Joan Mrs. Kaimes. The young man had  agreed readily enough, as he did not want to inflict his comparative penury,  and poor lodgings, on the girl he so dearly loved. Joan and he had decided to  wait for two years, and during that time Lionel was to reform Lambeth. He was  attempting to do this with all the vigour of his energetic nature, and between  times made love to Joan. Lady Canvey knew of the engagement, and would have had  the couple married at once, since she could easily have given Lionel a living,  and wished to do so. But the curate was anxious to become the vicar of  Firmingham. The present incumbent was seriously ill, and in the event of death  the Duke had promised that Lionel should fill the pulpit.</p>
  <p>Therefore  the lovers waited very happily, and if Firmingham did not come to them within  the decreed two years, they were quite prepared to marry on the bread and  cheese of a hard London life. Meantime, Joan was seeing a trifle of West End  life under Lady Canvey&rsquo;s wing, and her earnings, as Lady Canvey&rsquo;s companion,  were most acceptable to the hard-worked Mr. Tallentire and his wife. Thus it  was that Joan returned Lionel&rsquo;s kiss, and only released herself from his loving  arms when she remembered they were within sight of the lodge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lionel,  how can you?&rdquo; she said, setting her hat straight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can&rsquo;t I, you mean,&rdquo; he replied, smiling; &ldquo;do you think I am as cold as the  snow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re as nice,&rdquo; pouted Joan, &ldquo;or you would have asked me to walk  with you this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear,&rdquo; he said, gravely: &ldquo;I could not have taken you to see Harold Garth. The  poor fellow is too ill. But we can walk now. I have nothing to do, and&mdash;Joan,  where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Back  to the house. I won&rsquo;t be taken for a walk on nothing-to-do terms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  silly child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  cruel boy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  they kissed and made it up in full view of a red-breast, who cocked his head on  one side and wondered why these human beings looked so pleased. Joan said &ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo;  and he flew away to tell his wife, while the couple walked sedately through the  gates, and into a world which their love created for themselves alone.</p>
  <p>All  the same, their conversation was a trifle prosaic. They read a letter which  Joan had received from her mother about trouble over the Christmas gifts to the  poor of the parish, and discussed this old woman who lived in a chilly garret,  and that old man who dwelt like a troglodyte in a damp cellar, till the  conversation became as sober as the looks of the village sexton whom they met.  And he was a teetotaller.</p>
  <p>But  however enthusiastic human nature may be in the talking and doing of good  works, love after all takes precedence of philanthropy, and shortly they began  discussing themselves and their happiness. What they said does not matter much.  Although foolish, it was sweet to them, and Joan&rsquo;s eyes sparkled like the  icicles on the bleak hedge-rows at the looks her lover gave her. They walked in  the pleasant Land of Tenderness, and down the by-lane of First Love. Joan had  never seen the old French chart of that country, with its quaint names and odd  geography, but neither Lionel nor herself needed its guidance. They had skimmed  through the country before, and knew the lie of it extremely well.</p>
  <p>The  pair soared pretty nearly to the gates of their transcendental heaven, until the  strain became too great for mere human effort, and they folded their wings of  thought to drop earthward. That unfailing timepiece, the human interior,  announced the hour of luncheon, and with some haste they turned homeward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> hungry,&rdquo; said Lionel, ogreishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  eat me,&rdquo; laughed Miss Tallentire; &ldquo;you look as though you could!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  be Red Ridinghood and I the wolf,&rdquo; suggested Lionel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Do be serious, Lionel! I want you to tell me about this poor man you saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garth?  Ah, he&rsquo;ll never see another Christmas. Consumption is wasting him to a shadow.  In another three or four months&mdash;&rdquo; Lionel broke off with a sigh, &ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  anything be done?&rdquo; asked Joan, sympathetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything  possible is being done, Joan. The Duke is looking after Garth in every way&mdash;you  know how kind he is. He even sent Demetrius to cure him, and if Demetrius can&rsquo;t,  no one else can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if he was taken to a warmer climate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  end would only be retarded for a few months,&rdquo; interrupted the curate. &ldquo;Demetrius  says there is no hope. And I don&rsquo;t think the poor fellow is sorry to go, Joan.  He has no relatives, and few friends. I fancy he has had a lonely life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  tears filled Joan&rsquo;s brown eyes. &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; she echoed, stealing one hand  into that of her lover&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Fancy, if we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t fancy it with you by my side. And what is more, I don&rsquo;t intend to fancy  it,&rdquo; said Lionel, hastily. &ldquo;Please God, you and I have many happy and useful  years before us. How do you like the Firmingham vicarage, Joan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s lovely, and such a sweet church. But I fear it&rsquo;s too good to be true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it&rsquo;s not what you want,&rdquo; joked the curate. &ldquo;If I were the Duke, now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; she laughed, amused at the idea of being a duchess; &ldquo;the  very idea frightens me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lionel assured her: &ldquo;you will never be called upon to wear strawberry  leaves, unless the Duke and Frith and Jim all go the way poor Garth is taking.  And then Frith&rsquo;s wife may have a little Lord Firmingham. I sincerely hope so,  as it would never do for Jim to be the Duke of Pentland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  passionately,&rdquo; said the curate, dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  wife would make a splendid duchess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  looks, I have no doubt. But with fifty thousand a year and a great position,  she and Jim would do good to neither God nor man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  James Kaimes seems very kind,&rdquo; observed Joan, timidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all seeming. Of real, true, self-sacrificing kindness she knows absolutely  nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she is so beautiful, Lionel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  was Jezebel, I expect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lionel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Joan!&rdquo; he mimicked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry your head over Lady Jim. She will always get  on well in this world, though I am very doubtful about her position in the  next. Come,&rdquo; he pointed down the incline of the lane, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll race you to the  bottom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  might meet some one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I&rsquo;m out for a holiday&rdquo;; and away flew Lionel down the snowy lane,  with his clerical coattails fluttering in the wind.</p>
  <p>Joan,  girlish and simple and extremely young, sped after him, and with rosy cheeks  arrived at the goal before her lover.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;  said the curate, wiping his heated brow, &ldquo;considering I won three flat races at  the &lsquo;varsity, that&rsquo;s not bad, Joan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  humbug, as if I didn&rsquo;t see that you let me win.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be a tyrant after marriage,&rdquo; said Lionel, merrily. &ldquo;Enjoy your little day, my  love!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am enjoying this day,&rdquo; said Joan, as they walked rapidly towards the park  gates; &ldquo;but what will Lady Canvey say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  What does it matter? She was young herself a century ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  a dear old woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  contradicted Lionel, critically; &ldquo;she is old and clever, but I should not call  her a dear. That word suits some one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo;  cried Joan, triumphantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  clever of you to guess that! Hulloa, who is this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  gates were opened and a sledge issued, drawn by two black ponies. In it sat  Lady Jim, who was driving, and Dr. Constantine Demetrius.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is she up to now?&rdquo; Lionel asked himself. He was intensely distrustful of Lady  Jim, but he did not explain this to Joan.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7</b> </h2>
  <p>The  sledge occupied by this well-matched couple might have been used by Pompadour,  in the days when the finances of France were melting in the furnace of  Versailles. The basketwork body of a swan, gilded and painted and elegantly  fragile, rested delicately on slim steel runners, and glided over the frozen  snow in the rear of two spirited black ponies. These, harnessed in the Russian  fashion, with a paucity of trappings and many tiny silver bells, sprang  forward, under Lady Jim&rsquo;s skilful guidance, as though they were rioting in a  spring meadow. She and her companion were snugly wrapped in an opossum rug,  which Leah, rather vulgarly, despised as a cheap article. Her mink cloak, with  the snowy ermine scarf drawn through the shoulder cape in the latest fashion,  had cost nearly ten times the amount, and Leah wore it with the proud  consciousness that she owed no money for it. It was an early-winter present  from Lady Frith, and she had accepted it on the generous ground that its cut  and rich brown colour became her better than they would have suited the dowdy,  insignificant Marchioness. But the little woman never knew that Lady Jim&rsquo;s  good-nature had prevailed to this extent. She had thought to give Leah  pleasure.</p>
  <p>Demetrius,  muffled in Muscovite sables, sat contentedly by this Tauric Diana, wondering  why he had been graciously invited to drive with the goddess, after a hurried  luncheon. The two were t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, for the groom had been dispensed with as  out of keeping with the novel vehicle. The excuse was artistic. Nevertheless,  Demetrius suspected other reasons for the absence of an eavesdropping servant.  What these might be he hoped to hear from Lady Jim.</p>
  <p>But  as yet she showed no disposition to speak frankly, for the Russian, in Jim&rsquo;s  picturesque speech, was a gentleman to be handled &ldquo;with the gloves on.&rdquo; Jim  himself had impressed this on Leah, before he sat down to spell out <i>The  Woman in White</i>. Needless to say, this unusual effort to improve what Jim  was pleased to term his mind bored him extremely. &ldquo;Not a word about racin&rsquo;,&rdquo;  grumbled Jim, skipping page after page. Still, as Leah pointed out the  necessity of poaching on the domain of fiction, Jim sat at his lesson like a  good little boy, and his wife drove out with her proposed victim. That the  irony of fate might change the victim into a possible tyrant did not occur to  Leah at the moment.</p>
  <p>All  the same, she was careful not to commit herself too hastily, and for two miles  talked society-journal paragraphs with an assiduity at once boring and  perplexing to Demetrius. Even when the sledge slipped, silent and ghost-like,  over an Arctic waste, and they were alone to babble secrets to a frosty sky,  Leah showed no disposition to come to the point. She wished Demetrius to  question her, and then, by seeing into his mind, she could be guided as to the  most selfishly-successful way of making up her own. But the doctor guessed her  reason for this diplomatic silence, and knowing what a shameless capacity she  had for word-twisting and for slipping out of untenable positions, he gave her  no opportunity to overlook his hand. It was certainly, as he reflected, a game  of skill, but what the precise style of game might be Demetrius could not  guess. However, one thing was certain; this game, like all others, was being  played for money. On Lady Jim&rsquo;s part, that is. Demetrius shuffled his cards for  the stake of love, and so, having Leah Kaimes for an antagonist, lost at the  outset. A game between a man and a woman, on amatory grounds, is always  unequal. The one in earnest invariably loses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  this remind you of the steppes?&rdquo; asked Leah, waving her whip towards a desert  of snow and ice. The polite conversation was still much in evidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somewhat,  madame; but I cannot remember sledging across any steppe in such charming  company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  You have never driven Mademoiselle Aksakoff, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a pleasure yet to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Russia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? She may induce her father to make my peace with the Czar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would be pleased?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  shrugged his spare shoulders, and replied in the evasive manner which  characterised this conversation on the part of both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am well content with England,&rdquo; he remarked calmly. &ldquo;Many people are pleasant,  and all agreeable. Also, the Duke pays me well&mdash;too well, considering he is my  solitary patient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew a physician to quarrel with his fees before,&rdquo; laughed Lady Jim,  flicking the ponies lightly; &ldquo;and you have another patient, I understand&mdash;Mr.  Kaimes said something about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  young priest&mdash;ah, yes. He was at the gates with that most adorable young lady,  whom I presume he will marry. Your Anglican priests, like our Greek popes, have  that freedom, have they not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not answer my question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  pardon, madame,&rdquo; said the doctor, with an apologetic smile and his hands palm  to palm. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it is so. I have another patient, a peasant&mdash;one Harold Garth,&rdquo; he  pronounced the name uncommonly clearly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  well you speak English, Monsieur Demetrius! So many foreigners over-emphasise  their &lsquo;h&rsquo;s&rsquo;, and slur their &lsquo;r&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  Russians have a capacity for tongues. I know five languages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you tell the truth in any one of them?&rdquo; asked Lady Jim, rather rudely; but then  she wished to make him lose his temper, in the hope of breaking down his  reserve. But love had not yet blinded Demetrius, and he became offensively  gentle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  you, madame, I always speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  take you at your word,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, smartly. &ldquo;Why did you leave Russia,  Monsieur Demetrius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,  I come of a princely family, but for the sake of humanity I practised my  profession in Moscow. A dear friend of mine foolishly joined the Anarchists,  and an order was issued for his arrest. Fortunately, the official who signed  the warrant was my patient, and I chanced to be with him when the paper was  brought for his signature. He laid it aside for the moment, and I saw my friend&rsquo;s  name. I therefore gave my patient a drug, which made him sleep for twenty-four  hours, so that he could not sign. Meanwhile, my friend escaped&mdash;it matters not  how&mdash;but he escaped, with my help. Through a rival doctor, my use of the drug to  aid my friend became known, and I was accused of conspiring also. The governor  of Moscow was enraged, and ordered my arrest in my friend&rsquo;s place. The prospect  of Siberia was not pleasant, so I crossed the frontier after many delightful  adventures, with the recital of which I shall not trouble you. Behold me,  therefore, in your free country, madame, no longer a subject of the Czar, but  your devoted slave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  told the story, without preamble or excuse, in an unemotional and level voice,  though all the time he wondered why Lady Jim desired to hear it. She gave him  no explanation. &ldquo;And if you go back to Russia?&rdquo; she asked carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear I shall never go back, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  knows? Mademoiselle Aksakoff might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely,  madame. She might, and, with small encouragement, she would. But her gaining of  my pardon would assuredly lead to a marriage of gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would be no sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  many&mdash;no. To myself&mdash;madame, it is impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you not make your peace without her influence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas,  no, madame. The Grand Duke was furious at my share in my friend&rsquo;s escape. He  would give much to capture me, and should I set foot on the Continent&rdquo;&mdash;he  shrugged his shoulders significantly; &ldquo;but the Third Section has no power in  your land of liberty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Third Section?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it pleases madame better, the secret police. No; unless I marry Mademoiselle  Aksakoff, of whom I admit my unworthiness, I must remain in exile&mdash;but it has  many compensations,&rdquo; he added, bowing his head courteously to Lady Jim&rsquo;s  profile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so,&rdquo; she assented, scarcely heeding the compliment; then added thoughtfully, &ldquo;You  are a daring man, Monsieur Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Daring,  when necessary, madame. But I confess to a love of ease.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  swung her ponies round a curve with careless dexterity. &ldquo;It is not probable  that any one will invite you to leave your lotus-eating, monsieur. Thank you  for the story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is at your service, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim hesitated. &ldquo;You do not ask me why I requested you to relate it,&rdquo; she said  at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  wish is a command. A command is never questioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might wish you to do something that you might question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  no&mdash;believe me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  jump in the dark,&rdquo; said Leah, with a hard little laugh; &ldquo;by the way, this  woman, for whom you ventured so much&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a man, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;David  and Jonathan in Crim Tartary, I suppose. They say,&rdquo; she gave a conscious laugh,  &ldquo;that a man would venture farther for a woman than for one of his own sex. You,  I resume, are an exception.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,  one does some things for friendship, but all things for love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  glanced at the pale face beside her with a smile, and saw that the dark eyes  were full of fire, &ldquo;You are romantic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  is every man, when he loves, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand&mdash;Mademoiselle Aksakoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  penetrate my thoughts admirably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim relieved her feelings by using the whip on the obedient ponies. Demetrius  was clever and suspicious; also, as his story assured her, he was daring,  clear-headed, and might be dangerous. If she gave this man a hold over her, he  might be, and probably would be, unscrupulous enough to use his power. Moreover,  Lionel had not yet asked the Duke, and there was always the chance that the  money could be obtained without the necessity of plotting. Leah had taken the  doctor for this delightful drive with the intention of speaking plainly; but  his skilful use of words made her cautious. She was too clever a woman to build  her tower without reckoning the expense.</p>
  <p>Demetrius  watched her with keen, questioning eyes and a perfectly impassive face, but he  learned nothing. Lady Jim was quite as Oriental as himself in masking her  emotions. Nevertheless, he guessed that the interest displayed in his past  involved more than the satisfying of an idle curiosity. She wanted money&mdash;he was  certain of that. But unless she intended to sell him to the Third Section, he  could not conceive why she had forced his confidence. The enigma irritated him,  though he paid a silent tribute to the diplomatic powers of this charming  Englishwoman. But, cool and cautious as he was, her next speech nearly reduced  him to the necessity of speaking plainly, although he regarded candour as a  greater sin than making love to another man&rsquo;s wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  we&rsquo;ll drive home,&rdquo; said Leah, briskly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but no, madame. This is charming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  chilly. I am not a Russian, to revel in snow and ice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,  the fire in our veins prevents our feeling the disagreeables of nature. I am no  phlegmatic Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  interesting,&rdquo; said Leah, indifferently. &ldquo;I wonder if the cattle will face this  snowstorm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were driving straight into a chaos of eddying flakes, and meeting the sting of  bitter sleet dashed in their blinking eyes by the wind. Demetrius bit his lips,  and suppressed his fiery nature with an effort due to years of training. He  could have killed this woman with her contemptuous indifference and impregnable  self-possession. As the ponies plunged, with tossing heads and jingling bells,  into that Arctic hurricane, he wished that the sledge would overturn, so that  he might extort a word of gratitude by saving her life. But Leah&rsquo;s courage was  as high as his own, and her strength greater, so it was quite probable that she  would be able to look after herself. All he could do was to unflinchingly face  the volleying snow, while Lady Jim dashed through the hostile elements like  Semiramis in her war-chariot. With a turn of her wrist she prevented the  frightened ponies dashing into a thorny hedge, with another turn swung the  light vehicle away from a dangerous ditch, and then lashed the animals into a  headlong gallop, which ended only when they trembled, with smoking flanks and drooping  heads, before the Firmingham porch. And throughout that furious, rocking,  blinding drive Demetrius sat grimly silent. Lady Jim was disappointed. It would  have been more courageous and amusing had he made love to her in the jaws of  death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  a Russian adventure,&rdquo; she said, tossing the reins to a groom, and jumped out,  all colour and animation. &ldquo;I hope you were not afraid, Monsieur Demetrius,&rdquo; she  added unjustly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  you,&rdquo; he replied significantly.</p>
  <p>With  a rosy face and a display of white teeth, Leah faced him on the steps. &ldquo;There  was no need, I assure you. I can look after myself in every way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can believe that, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why talk nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  amuse you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  good man, I don&rsquo;t want amusement, but help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  started forward, impulsively. &ldquo;Command me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim flung her wraps, her whip, her mink cape, and her gloves into his arms. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;  she said carelessly, and turned towards the library, leaving her illegal  admirer pale with rage.</p>
  <p>She  stopped laughing at the remembrance of his wrath when she saw Lionel studying a  book near the window. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked, coming lightly towards him: &ldquo;any news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I have seen the Duke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he&mdash;and he&mdash;&rdquo; her voice died away under stress of emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will help you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah&rsquo;s  first feeling was one of relief, and she was almost on the point of expressing  gratitude, but a sudden remembrance that aid from the Duke meant the retention  of Jim as a most undesirable husband, cooled the warm impulse. She recovered  her self-command, and was about to go into figures, when Mrs. Penworthy with a  noisy party bustled into the room, looking rather tousled and flushed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have been playing &lsquo;Hunt the Slipper,&rsquo;&ldquo; she announced, in her high, thin voice, &ldquo;and  Algy found mine three times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim, annoyed at the irruption, glanced at Mrs. Penworthy&rsquo;s feet, which could  scarcely have worn the slippers of Cinderella. &ldquo;I can quite believe that,&rdquo; she  said sweetly, and left the room smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does she mean?&rdquo; asked Algy, obtusely.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Penworthy knew perfectly well what was meant, but was too feminine to explain,  save in a way calculated to mislead her courtier. This could be done by  arousing his egotism.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  means that you are clever to play the game so well,&rdquo; was her explanation. &ldquo;I  rather think Lady Jim admires you, Algy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  youth fondled what he called a moustache. &ldquo;Rippin&rsquo; woman, Lady Jim,&rdquo; said he,  taking the speech literally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  and tell her so,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Penworthy, colouring angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  would give me greater pleasure,&rdquo; remarked the lady, fervently hating him for  his stupidity, &ldquo;than to see her dancing on you, as she does on all men who are  foolish enough to make themselves carpets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not a carpet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  You&rsquo;re a tame cat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  come and play Puss in the Corner,&rdquo; urged Algy, gaily, and Mrs. Penworthy  consented, as this game had nothing to do with abnormal slippers.</p>
  <p>Leah,  pleased at having snubbed Mrs. Penworthy, whom she considered quite an improper  person, went to look for Jim in his room. He was there, sure enough, lying on  the sofa with the novel tossed carelessly on the floor, and a black pipe  between his lips. Evidently he had not heard the good news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo;  cried Leah, breathlessly, &ldquo;the Duke will part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has parted,&rdquo; growled Jim, swinging his long legs on to the floor and producing  a cheque. &ldquo;Look at that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim did. It was for two hundred pounds. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She crushed it in her two hands,  as though she were throttling his Grace. &ldquo;What an insult!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_8"></a>Chapter 8</b> </h2>
  <p>Two  hundred pounds. Lady Jim rapidly ran over in her mind such of the most pressing  liabilities as she could recollect, and shuddered at a total of two thousand.  They owed that, and many other debts which, for the moment, escaped her memory.  So far as she could see, nothing remained but a compulsory journey through the  court. Not that she really minded bankruptcy. Plenty of people, accepted as  immaculate by society, made use of that desirable institution to get a receipt  for past extravagances, on the plea of having lived beyond their incomes. She  and Jim could make the same excuse with perfect truth, and would doubtless be  enabled to make a fresh start. And if a few tradesmen were ruined, what did it  matter? They always overcharged, and it might be a lesson to them not to worry  customers.</p>
  <p>No;  the bankruptcy court matters very little, but the want of ready cash mattered a  great deal. Leah cared nothing about paying the bills, but ardently desired to  have a re-filled purse and no bother about such vulgar things as pounds,  shillings, and pence. It was perfectly idiotic of the Duke to be so stingy. If  he had come down with a thousand, she and Jim could have enjoyed themselves  abroad for a couple of months, and meanwhile, he could have paid these  troublesome tradesmen. But two hundred pounds! Did the old fool take them for  the respectable middle-class couple, living in slate-roofed houses, to which  she had alluded? Without Jim&rsquo;s assistance she could get rid of that trifle in a  fortnight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe your father&rsquo;s brain is softening,&rdquo; she complained crossly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not responsible for his crazy arithmetic,&rdquo; retorted Jim, with the helpful  addition of a few adjectives.</p>
  <p>But,  beyond swearing as much as he dared in her presence, Jim could offer no  assistance, and Leah concluded that, after all, it might be necessary to trust  Demetrius. Her husband, having gained some faint idea of the novel, had ended  in declining to turn fiction into fact. His remarks were not without  shrewdness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  chap who writes the story knows what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to happen,&rdquo; said Jim, when pressed  for his opinion, &ldquo;an&rsquo; can invent circumstances to dodge results. But if we  start a yarn of this kind on our own, we don&rsquo;t know what the end &lsquo;ull be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes!&rdquo; protested Leah, very patiently, considering she disagreed entirely; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll  disappear, and I shall become a widow with my share of the twenty thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  how long will your share last?&rdquo; asked Jim, derisively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends upon my mood. Some time, I expect, seeing that your death will force me  into retirement, and crape is not so very expensive. And when you get through  your lot, Jim, what will you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; you,&rdquo; said Jim, evasively; and continued hurriedly, lest she  should insist upon a disagreeable explanation, &ldquo;&lsquo;Sides, there&rsquo;s my father to be  considered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  when have you taken him to your heart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s all very well talkin&rsquo;. But your father&rsquo;s your father, when all&rsquo;s said an&rsquo;  done. The Duke doesn&rsquo;t think me a saint, but he&rsquo;d be sorry to see me die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one wants you to die,&rdquo; she said impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  bunkum, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;what&rsquo;s the word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might  I suggest &lsquo;sophistry&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Lady Jim, quite aware that her reasoning was  fallacious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you&rsquo;ll suggest anythin&rsquo; to get your own way. But what I mean is that, though I  do die, I don&rsquo;t really die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  clearly you put things, Jim. Please yourself. We must go back to town with this  money, to be whitewashed&rdquo;; and eyeing the cheque contemptuously, she saw that  it was unfortunately made payable to Jim. Her husband stretched for the cheque  and slipped it into his waistcoat pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  goin&rsquo; to see the Duke m&rsquo;self,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;an&rsquo; tell him everythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  about the money we&rsquo;ve raised on the income?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  blessed thing,&rdquo; said Kaimes, doggedly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s my father, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s his duty to  square things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  mightn&rsquo;t follow your reasoning,&rdquo; murmured Leah, with one hand on the  mantelpiece and the other holding up her skirts to warm one foot. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t  make a much worse mess of it than Lionel has made. Two hundred pounds&mdash;he must  have thought he was asking money for some old woman. Shall I come with you,  Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  He halted at the door to deliver himself of the remark, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like a red rag  to a bull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well. I only thought you&rsquo;d like me to translate your talk into something  resembling English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you fret yourself, I&rsquo;ll make him understand. An&rsquo; if I do get things squared,&rdquo;  cried Jim, warming at the thought of his heroism in facing an angry parent, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll  have to drop spending money, an&rsquo; live as other women do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear James, and you&rsquo;ll live as other men do, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do what I jolly well please. An&rsquo; why James?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  never was a St. Jim, that I ever heard of,&rdquo; mused Leah, turning pensive eyes on  her exasperated husband, &ldquo;and as you wish to canonise yourself, of course you  must change your name. Yes, James&rdquo;&mdash;she moved swiftly towards him, and detained  him gently by the lapels of his coat&mdash;&ldquo;from this time forth we&rsquo;ll live in holy  matrimony, and pig it on what&rsquo;s left of the income. Curzon Street given up,  Bayswater remains, and there, James darling, we&rsquo;ll live a life of extremely  plain living and high thinking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk bosh,&rdquo; growled Jim, trying to escape; but she held on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  James, I won&rsquo;t, if you will only raise my intellect to the level of your own.  And think what a delightful existence it will be, James. A cheap Bayswater  dungeon, with three servants and the shopping done at Whiteley&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll turn my  dresses and trim my hats and you&rsquo;ll give up your clubs, to curse in a stuffy  drawing-room while you play bezique with your dear wife, till we go to bed at  ten. No more betting on Podaskas, James; no more whist-drives, or bridge, or  any such expensive naughtinesses. And how nice it will be for you, James, to  flirt with those earnestly-fashionable suburban girls, who are just half an  hour behind the times, and who&mdash;&rdquo; Here Jim rent his garments from Leah&rsquo;s grasp,  and departed in haste with an impolite word. His wife&rsquo;s humour did not appeal  to him in the least, and he banged the door unnecessarily hard.</p>
  <p>Leah  returned to warm her toes and laugh till she cried. There was something excessively  amusing in the idea of Jim setting up for a plaster saint. For once in his dull  life he displayed a sense of humour, and she picked up the discarded novel with  a fresh burst of laughter at the picture of the Bayswater m&eacute;nage, as drawn by  her fertile fancy. Jim as a middle-class Philistine tickled her even more than  Jim in a stained-glass attitude, with an artificial halo misfitting his empty  head.</p>
  <p>But  a remembrance of the cheque&mdash;payable to Jim&mdash;and of her husband&rsquo;s possible  position at the moment, telling clumsy truths to an aggrieved father, made her  serious. Certainly the Duke, pleased to hear his son speak honestly for once in  a life of consistent fibbing, might shed tears over a hastily-produced  cheque-book. Jim&rsquo;s falsehoods, in times of pressing need, were almost inspired,  and it was not impossible that he might return with the loot. Then, the  tradespeople being paid, Leah decided that she could run up fresh bills to any  amount: they would be all the more eager to give her unlimited credit when they  knew that the Duke was in the background. Decidedly the prospect was not so  bad, and, after all, it might be dangerous to make real-life experiments in  sensational fiction.</p>
  <p>These  common-sense reflections led Lady Jim to thank the watchful fetish for governing  her tongue during the afternoon. Demetrius could be nasty when he liked. She  was certain of that, and it was just as well to give him no chance. Some people  carried tyranny to a ridiculous excess, and liked to hear their victims squeal  unmeaningly. Leah did not belong to the squealing species, and vowed a vow that  Demetrius should never have an opportunity of provoking such futile outcries.  As a gleam of good sense warned her of possible danger, she decided to avoid  the Russian, or only to flirt sufficiently to make him miserable and Jim cross.</p>
  <p>Having  settled the question in this sensible way, Leah sought her room to dress for  the five o&rsquo;clock muffin-scramble. She assumed the prettiest tea-gown she  possessed, for the truly feminine purpose of irritating Demetrius into  over-estimating what he had lost. Descending like a Homeric deity in a cloud&mdash;of  lace&mdash;she went at once to the library, and restored to its place the text-book  of her proposed fraud. Fortunately, the room was empty, so no one would ever know  that the novel had been read with a view to plagiarism. Not that it mattered  much now, since Jim was proceeding on the lines of &ldquo;Honesty is the best policy.&rdquo;  Leah hoped fervently that he would succeed, but felt more than a trifle  doubtful. Jim was so new to this straightforward method of gaining his ends.</p>
  <p>The  house-party was picnicking in the winter-garden, a delightful Eden, where  tropical plants flourished in defiance of the season. On its glass roof the  hail rattled like small shot, and through its glass walls could be seen the  bleak, wintry landscape, faintly white in the deepening gloom. These glimpses  of the unpleasant increased the sense of comfort, and over-civilised humanity  luxuriated in the warm atmosphere, as independent of nature&rsquo;s laws as the  palm-trees under which it ate and drank and talked scandal. The frumps nibbled  dry toast and sipped milk; the fashionables devoured dainty sandwiches and  enjoyed the strongest of tea, and both aided digestion with chatter and  laughter. It was the complacent contentment of animals, mumbling a plentiful  meal, and for the moment all spiritual instincts were governed by material  needs.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Penworthy&rsquo;s courtiers were feeding their queen, who had a large appetite for so  small a woman. After a full meal she was disposed to be amiable, even to  Freddy, had he been there; but she became decidedly cross when some of the  court deserted her for &ldquo;that woman,&rdquo; as she termed Lady Jim. Leah was feminine  enough to enjoy the fallen expression on Mrs. Penworthy&rsquo;s face, and accepted  with marked pleasure the attentions of those who crowded round her. The sight  gave Mrs. Penworthy a fit of indigestion, which prevented her enjoying a late  dinner. It was hard that her vanity had to content itself with the banal  compliments of the faithful Algy, who tried to be a host in himself, and was  snubbed for his ambition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I present my nephew to you?&rdquo; asked Lord Sargon, in his thin, precise voice.</p>
  <p>Leah  intimated that she would be charmed, and found herself nodding to a slim, dark  young man, clean-shaven and alert. He looked more alive than the languid youths  around her, and she was not surprised when Sargon explained that Mr. Askew was  a naval officer, who had lately returned from a five years&rsquo; cruise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you hadn&rsquo;t been wrapped up in cotton wool all your life,&rdquo; said Lady  Jim, when Sargon had removed the attendant youths and the lieutenant was making  himself agreeable in a bluff, briny way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I look so uncivilised?&rdquo; he asked, with laughing eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Highly.  You are the nearest approach to pre-historic man I have yet seen,&rdquo; said she,  and thus was unjust to Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there&rsquo;s no need to apologise. I daresay Circe found Ulysses very agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Homer  says so,&rdquo; answered Askew, who appeared to be well read; &ldquo;but if I am Ulysses,  you must be Circe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  accept the compliment!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it a compliment?&rdquo; asked the pre-historic man, daringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  meant for one it should not have been said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beg  pardon. I&rsquo;m several kinds of ass. But I did mean it civilly, you know. Circe  was a clever woman, whose magic turned men into outward semblances of their  real characters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim smiled scornfully. &ldquo;And if my magic could transform these,&rdquo; she glanced  disparagingly round the place, &ldquo;what a menagerie it would be! Pigs, and snakes,  and parrots, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dogs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  the mongrel kind, Mr. Askew. Do you speak of yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  nodded laughingly. &ldquo;Dogs are so devoted!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means you wish to attach yourself to me,&rdquo; said Leah, gravely. &ldquo;I might take you  at your word&mdash;I need a friend; but Ulysses deserted Circe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  laughed, and gazed admiringly at her beautiful, pensive face. &ldquo;We talk  parables, I think,&rdquo; he said, with assumed lightness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prehistoric  man always did, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary, his speech was direct and blunt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine  will be now,&rdquo; smiled Lady Jim. &ldquo;This cup has been empty for five minutes, and  you never offered to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man took the tiny cup hastily. &ldquo;But for the publicity of the place, I  would ask you to tread upon my prostrate body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  eyed his lithe, active figure as he went to the bamboo table presided over by  Lady Frith. He was really a delightful sailorman, she reflected, and quicker  than most of his sex to understand the unspoken. It might be more amusing to  drop Demetrius and flirt with him. But then, his face was too honest, and he  might object to being made use of.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men  of that kind are so dreadfully in earnest,&rdquo; sighed Leah, with a sense of  irritation; &ldquo;they think a woman always means what she says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  walked lightly over the mosaic floor with a fresh cup of tea and a plate of hot  cakes. Some man bustled in his way, and he stopped to avoid an upset of his  burden. At the moment, he glanced towards the Moorish door which admitted  triflers into the winter paradise. To Lady Jim&rsquo;s wonderment, he started, and a  look of surprise overspread his expressive face. Her eyes turned at once in the  direction of the entrance, and she beheld Jim blinking his eyes at the dazzle  of light. He looked heavy and sullen, which hinted that the interview with the  Duke had not been successful. But Leah forgot that momentous question for the  moment, as her quick brain was trying to understand Askew&rsquo;s look of surprise.  Before she could ask herself what he could possibly know about Jim, he  approached with the tea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is nice and hot,&rdquo; he said, placing the plate on the table at her elbow and  offering the cup. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me for neglecting you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  one condition,&rdquo; replied Leah, stirring her tea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Consider  it fulfilled,&rdquo; was the impetuous answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you look surprised when you saw that gentleman at the door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  pointedly suppressed the fact that Kaimes was her husband, as, if there was  anything, she would learn it the more easily by pretending that Jim was a  stranger. In fact, should Askew learn that the man who had startled him was her  lawful lord, he might decline to open his lips. The lieutenant&rsquo;s next words  proved the wisdom of her concealment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Berring,&rdquo; he said, carelessly. &ldquo;Well, I was surprised to see Berring so  unexpectedly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  his name Berring?&rdquo; asked Lady Jim, guessing that she was about to learn  something connected with Jim&rsquo;s very shady past.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I met him in Lima.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lima?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Peru, and that&rsquo;s in South America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  nodded. &ldquo;I did learn geography at school,&rdquo; she said, setting down her empty  cup; and when Askew coloured at the implied snub, softened it by asking a  friendly question: &ldquo;You are surprised at meeting Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Berring, here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I said so before. A nice sort of chap, but selfish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a reader of character you are, Mr. Askew!&rdquo; He looked up eagerly. &ldquo;You know him,  then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  little. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man stared at the ground, and replied in muffled tones: &ldquo;I thought you  might have met his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Berring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  began to laugh. The idea that Jim might be a bigamist had never struck her  before. She had guessed that there was a woman connected with those frequent  journeys to Lima, but that Jim had adopted the Mormon religion was news. Some  women would have been angry, but Leah had no amatory feelings likely to arouse jealousy,  so she was frankly amused at her husband&rsquo;s duplicity. Also, she was sorry for  Mrs. Berring, who perhaps was silly enough to love Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she a nice woman?&rdquo; was her next question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means, you love her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you are a brick wall I can see through, Mr. Askew. No; I have never met Mrs.  Berring. Why did she throw you over and marry Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Berring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  looked quite alarmed. &ldquo;I say you <i>are</i> clever,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? You called me Circe, and I must live up to the name. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  echoed Askew, blankly, and their eyes met. He coloured. &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo;  he said quickly, for he guessed her desire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you can, and you will,&rdquo; rejoined Leah, composedly.</p>
  <p>Jim  was bearing the artillery of Mrs. Penworthy&rsquo;s eyes in his usual indifferent  way, and showed no disposition to seek out his wife. Probably he would remain  for the next hour in the clutches of the little woman, who was the limpet to  Jim&rsquo;s rock. This being so, Leah began to ask questions which Askew hesitated to  answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  hardly know one another,&rdquo; he murmured, embarrassed. &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t tell you, Lady  James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Then there&rsquo;s something improper in the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  flushed through his bronzed skin. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said in a brusque tone. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;orita  Fajardo is all that is good and holy and pure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  bread and butter!&rdquo; thought Leah, wondering if Jim had stumbled upon a convent.  But she was too wise to quote Byron to this young man, who apparently was  simple enough to regard love as something sacred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fajardo,&rdquo;  she repeated. &ldquo;A Spanish name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a Spanish lady,&rdquo; he said, gloomily. &ldquo;Lola Fajardo, of the Estancia, San Jago,  near Rosario.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you said of Lima?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I met her there. She is in the habit of stopping at Lima with her aunt. But her  true home is at Rosario, in the Santa Fe province of the Argentine republic. I  wonder if Berring brought her to England. She was madly in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must have been, to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Berring&rsquo;s a good-looking chap, and not bad,&rdquo; said Askew, with the innate  chivalry of a man towards a successful rival. &ldquo;I suppose they <i>did</i> marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  Then you are not certain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I never even knew if they were engaged. But when I joined my ship again at  Callao, every one said &lsquo;marriage&rsquo;&mdash;they were so uncommonly thick. I must ask  Berring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure he&rsquo;ll be delighted to afford you the information you seek,&rdquo; was Lady Jim&rsquo;s  ironical reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen Mrs. Berring?&rdquo; asked the young man, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I don&rsquo;t think any Mrs. Berring is stopping here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  perhaps he did not marry Lola, after all,&rdquo; cried Askew, rising hastily, and  with flashing eyes, &ldquo;unless&rdquo;&mdash;his voice fell&mdash;&ldquo;she is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  yawned. &ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;you had better ask Mr. Berring. I  see he is passing out of the garden with Mrs. Penworthy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I can&rsquo;t spoil sport,&rdquo; laughed the lieutenant, with an obvious effort;  &ldquo;but later on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later  on, of course,&rdquo; she said, rising. &ldquo;Here comes your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  Sargon advanced, and, with an apologetic look towards Leah, took Askew&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I  wish to present you to Lady Canvey,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>The  young man looked towards his charmer. &ldquo;Will you permit me to leave you for a  time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  You will find Lady Canvey delightful, and as pre-historic as you can wish. We  may meet after dinner,&rdquo; and, with a nod, she left the winter garden for the  purpose of seeking solitude. She wanted to think over Jim&rsquo;s iniquities, and to  consider what use might be made of them for her own benefit.</p>
  <p>Lady  Canvey was delighted to receive Askew, as she liked handsome young men,  especially when they were deferential and attentive, as this new acquaintance  appeared to be. &ldquo;Though I&rsquo;m a bad substitute for Lady Jim,&rdquo; she remarked  pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  charming creature with whom you have been talking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course, Lady Canvey. She is indeed charming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  private property. Her husband is the Duke&rsquo;s second son, at present in the  clutches of that little harpy, Mrs. Penworthy. Don&rsquo;t you make love to Lady Jim,  or you&rsquo;ll burn your fingers. I mistrust red-haired women, myself. But she and  Jim match each other capitally. Their marriage was made in heaven&rdquo;; and Lady  Canvey chuckled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  her husband here?&rdquo; asked Askew, looking round, anxious to see who owned  Circe-of-the-many-wiles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he went out with Mrs. Penworthy a quarter of an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  remembered how Lady Jim had drawn his attention to an outgoing couple. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  the lady go out with a Mr. Berring?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  with Lord Jim Kaimes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she&mdash;his wife&mdash;the lady I&mdash;&rdquo; Askew stopped with a groan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try  an unmarried woman,&rdquo; advised Lady Canvey, misunderstanding his emotion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more proper, and less expensive.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9</b> </h2>
  <p>Keeping  up the necessary Darby-and-Joan comedy, Kaimes strolled into his wife&rsquo;s  dressing-room half an hour before dinner to inquire if she was ready. Leah had  a second-hand view of him in a full-length mirror before which she posed, while  her maid added a few final touches to an eminently successful frock. From the  composed expression of his face she guessed that he had not yet renewed his  acquaintance with Mr. Askew, and therefore must be ignorant that the  free-spoken sailor had let the cat out of the bag. Lady Jim possessed the  animal now, but she did not intend to reveal her capture until Jim explained  how he had sped with the Duke. A slight nod towards the glass showed her  husband that she was aware of his presence, and the maid continued to use  experienced fingers. But Leah looked so charming, that further trouble in this  way was like adding sugar to honey. Jim stared approvingly, and, when the maid  was dismissed, saw his way to a compliment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have the good points of several women rolled into one, Leah,&rdquo; he said, with the  look of a sultan appraising an odalisque.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  polite speech means much, coming from a man of your experience, my dear Jim.  What good point of Mrs. Penworthy&rsquo;s have I annexed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  jealous!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horribly!  You are so deeply attached to that bundle of faded chiffon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care two straws for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Appearances  are misleading, then. But,&rdquo; added Leah, remembering Askew&rsquo;s eulogy, &ldquo;it may be  that you prefer something that&rsquo;s good and holy and pure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know why you should say that,&rdquo; grumbled Jim, annoyed at being credited  with such primitive tastes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may know before long,&rdquo; and she laughed at the thought of the marine bomb-shell  which would shortly shatter Jim&rsquo;s complacency.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; said Kaimes, with unaffected surprise, &ldquo;an&rsquo;  I&rsquo;m confoundedly hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Did the Duke&rsquo;s lecture give you an appetite?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah!&rdquo;  Jim became so serious as to look almost intelligent. &ldquo;My father is the best man  who ever wore shoe-leather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is usually condemned to cloth boots for gouty feet,&rdquo; murmured Leah, patting the  back of her head. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve pulled the wool over his eyes again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you wouldn&rsquo;t use slang,&rdquo; protested Jim, virtuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t pretend to vie with Mrs. Penworthy&rsquo;s purity of speech, my dear man. How  much have you got out of the Duke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he hasn&rsquo;t given me money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he&rsquo;s promised&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you&rsquo;d let me speak,&rdquo; cried Kaimes, testily, &ldquo;My father has promised to pay  all the debts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens! Is he aware of the amount?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,  I&rsquo;ve not finished. He&rsquo;ll pay the debts, and reduce our income to a thousand a  year till he recoups himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!  I thought you had seen your father, and not a money-lender. Have you accepted  this most generous offer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have,&rdquo; said Jim, sulkily, and kicking a mat out of the way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. It&rsquo;s to be Bayswater after all, James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you talk like that, I&rsquo;ll go down to dinner without you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  all means. You&rsquo;ve taken away my appetite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  laughed in a way calculated to still further infuriate Jim, who paced the room  in a towering passion. Nevertheless, she was seriously angry. Had the Duke  refused all help, it would have been more decent; but this bargain, which was  all on one side, annoyed her beyond measure. What did the Duke mean by taking <i>their</i> money?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me we&rsquo;ve got to pay our own debts, then,&rdquo; she said, while Jim seethed  like a whirlpool.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  why shouldn&rsquo;t we? It&rsquo;s only fair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  stared, and began to think that Jim was too good for this world.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you are not going to die,&rdquo; she said, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in your way,&rdquo; cried Kaimes, misunderstanding her, &ldquo;we aren&rsquo;t going to have any  buryin&rsquo; alive or substituted corpses, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to hang on as a respectable  member of society.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  come and hear you preach, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  preachin&rsquo; now,&rdquo; raged her husband, &ldquo;an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you make any mistake, Leah. I&rsquo;ve  told the Duke everythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  injudicious! He might have had a fit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t even blame me,&rdquo; said Jim, breaking down, &ldquo;an&rsquo; there were tears in his  eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  laughed amazingly long and loud, considering the tightness of her corset.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I had been present. Did you cry too, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  jolly well nearly did,&rdquo; said Kaimes, truthfully, if ungrammatically, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s  no good explainin&rsquo; to an icicle like you. But the pater&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to pay the  debts, free our income, an&rsquo; let the Curzon Street house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  and better. Then we <i>do</i> go to Bayswater?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  allow us one thousand a year till the debts are wiped off,&rdquo; went on Kaimes  hurriedly, and wishing to get the explanation over, &ldquo;an&rsquo; we can go abroad for a  couple of years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can. I shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  my wife, you must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  an individual, I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Lady Jim, calmly. She was getting over her  rage now, as she foresaw a very different interview between herself and Jim  before they retired for the night. &ldquo;It is very good of you to have settled all  this without consulting me. And now that you have done so, let us go to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  the gong,&rdquo; observed Leah, opening the door, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t like cold soup.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have to like lots of things now you didn&rsquo;t like before,&rdquo; said Jim, as they went  down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  selection doesn&rsquo;t include you, my good man, so don&rsquo;t be disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  could have shaken her, and began to understand why the lower orders indulged in  wife-beating. But as they were entering the drawing-room at this moment, he had  to play the part of a devoted husband. Leah floated radiantly into the brilliantly  lighted apartment, and Jim sought out the oldest and ugliest woman he could  find. When he thought of his wife, beauty sickened him for the time being. Thus  it came about that Miss Jaffray had the pleasure of shouting into his ear  throughout a long and wearisome dinner.</p>
  <p>Whether  it was the work of the fetish or of Lady Frith, Leah did not know, but she  found herself seated at the table with Askew on her right hand.</p>
  <p>The  young man looked flustered, and ill at ease. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; he began  apologetically, and, as she thought, tactlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you&rsquo;re my neighbour?&rdquo; she interrupted sweetly. &ldquo;How unkind!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  But I never knew he was your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?  Mr. Berring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  make it harder for me,&rdquo; he entreated softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been calling myself names ever  since we parted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should have left that to me, Mr. Askew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing in it, you know,&rdquo; he stuttered, heedlessly. &ldquo;Of course, she never  married him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope not, for the sake of morality,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, lightly, and thinking that  the soup was worse than usual. &ldquo;However, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. My husband is a  modest man, and sometimes drops his title when travelling. I daresay, as Mr.  Berring, he thought he was free to make love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; protested Askew, with a glance towards the unconscious Jim, who  apparently had not recognised him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should tell him so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  intend to&mdash;in the smoking room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim looked at him imperiously, and softened her voice to a very direct whisper.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make trouble,&rdquo; she said, in a somewhat domineering tone; &ldquo;that will do  no good and much harm. And after all, married or unmarried, every man has a  right to admire a pretty woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not to make love to her,&rdquo; muttered the young man, with another vengeful glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am no casuist,&rdquo; replied Leah, calmly; &ldquo;and you should be pleased that things  are as they are. You can now return to Lima, or Rosario, and marry the lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  wouldn&rsquo;t have me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she so much in love with Mr. Berring, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  don&rsquo;t, Lady James. I can&rsquo;t talk like this to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave a light laugh. &ldquo;It seems to me that you are talking; therefore I repeat my  question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might only have been gratitude,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Berring&mdash;I  mean your husband&mdash;saved her from being trampled upon by a mustang.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  picturesque, and how suited to Jim&rsquo;s qualifications! And she&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted Askew, hurriedly. &ldquo;I see I have been mistaken. It was  gratitude, not love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, jeeringly; &ldquo;a woman always prefers to exercise the  former rather than the latter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I&rsquo;d stopped and tried my luck,&rdquo; muttered the sailor, not clever enough to  interpret this speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not too late. Mr. Berring is safely secured, by love and the law, to my  apron-strings, so you can go back and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I&rsquo;ve just come in for a property of sorts, and the service has seen the last of  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Se&ntilde;orita Fajardo in the same predicament as the service?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a cousin, Lady James&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  female cousin, who goes with the property, as a fixture. I quite understand.  You have to marry her, out of gratitude for the money, and without the  discomforting passion of love. The Spanish lady&rsquo;s history repeats itself, I  see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  was rather discomfited. &ldquo;How quick you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t have had much to do with women,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;but I hope you will make  no trouble in the smoking-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  as things are, it&rsquo;s none of my funeral,&rdquo; he observed, grumpily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. I am the chief mourner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I say, Lady James,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, anxiously, &ldquo;I hope what I&rsquo;ve  inadvertently told you won&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not,&rdquo; she assured him, mendaciously; &ldquo;my husband is most trustworthy, as  you can see by his choice of that ugly old maid as a dinner companion. You were  mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I must have been,&rdquo; said Askew, with great relief. &ldquo;Of course, people talk  at Lima, as elsewhere,&rdquo; he ended apologetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  South America is inhabited by the deaf and dumb, I suppose they do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  laughing at me, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  always laugh. It&rsquo;s good for the digestion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  everything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  at love?&rdquo; he asked timidly.</p>
  <p>She  shot an amused glance at his colouring face. &ldquo;Remember you are engaged to the  fixture, Mr. Askew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I say, can&rsquo;t I come and see you in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be delighted, if you can find your way to Curzon Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  live there?&rdquo; he asked obtusely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a most respectable manner with my husband, Mr. Berring. I&rsquo;m known as Lady Jim  of Curzon Street. Most improper, isn&rsquo;t it, when Berring&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; expostulated the young man, quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself  for being such a fool. Can I call you Lady Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was getting on very fast, and Leah, in the interests of virtue, deemed it  necessary to snub him. &ldquo;Certainly not. Only people who have known me fifty  years address me so familiarly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must believe in re-incarnation then,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>This  was clever and pleased her. &ldquo;I was Circe in the days of Homer, Mr. Askew. But  as to my name now, there is another Lady Jim&mdash;a horrid woman who carries tracts  and meddles with morals, and dresses in a piously shabby fashion. So that we may  not be mixed up, I am known by the name of the street I live in. To you I am  Lady James Kaimes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Circe, the sorceress,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>Leah  laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what sort of animal my magic will turn you into,&rdquo; she  observed, with an encouraging smile.</p>
  <p>This  was a distinct promise, or at least he construed it as such, for his eyes  brightened, and he glanced at her in a way which assured her that she was  looking her best. He was certainly a delightful boy, she reflected, if somewhat  fickle. But a man who was catholic enough to marry the fixture, and adore the  Spanish lady, and make sudden love to herself, must be worth feminine  appreciation and study. Besides, he was good-looking, and had money, conjoined  with a frank and unsuspicious nature. Assuredly, he might be useful, if not  inclined to explore the Land of Tenderness too assiduously. But in that case,  he might compromise her in an earnest, pig-headed way, which would be at once  boring, ridiculous, and dangerous. Leah approved of playing with fire, but she  was too careful to risk a personal conflagration. Though allured by the  prospect of tormenting an honest heart, she had not made up her mind to enjoy  the opportunity by the time she left the dining-room. But a distinctly tigerish  glance, sent to her address by Demetrius, almost inclined her to give young  Askew the chance of making a fool of himself. The Russian had apparently  noticed the embryo flirtation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the better,&rdquo; thought Leah, sailing into the Adamless Eden of the winter garden;  &ldquo;it will be an additional card to play&rdquo;&mdash;which showed that Lady Jim was by no  means satisfied with the arrangement come to between her husband and his  father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  cigarette, dear Lady Jim?&rdquo; simpered Mrs. Penworthy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thanks; I leave smoking to women who bait their hooks with agreeable vices&rdquo;;  and she moved towards Lady Canvey.</p>
  <p>It  was horribly rude, and Mrs. Penworthy choked back an hysterical scream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delightful  woman, Lady James,&rdquo; said Miss Jaffray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delightful,&rdquo;  assented the other, who at the moment would gladly have mounted the scaffold on  a charge of murdering her insolent rival. &ldquo;I call her perfectly lovely. Such a  perfect complexion, and exquisite figure, and heavenly eyes, and large hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this piece of spite was wasted, as by this time Lady Jim was seated by her  godmother, assuring that sceptical lady how absolutely delighted she was to  learn that dear Jim had arranged matters with the dear Duke. &ldquo;And so sweet of  the Duke to tell you,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I know how anxious you have been about me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you wonder at it, my dear, when you are so sweet and gentle and womanly?&rdquo; said  Lady Canvey, who was quite equal to a war of words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must be thinking of Hilda Frith,&rdquo; replied Lady Jim, calmly. &ldquo;I cannot call  myself such an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  you left that to the sailor-boy you were flirting with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  boy, he doesn&rsquo;t know how to flirt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  teach him, my dear,&rdquo; chuckled the old lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  without fees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph.  His education will cost him a pretty penny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly.  But I might teach him for love, after the fashion of Miss Tallentire and  Lionel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!  Joan doesn&rsquo;t know how to flirt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  to dress either. I must ask her how the Whiteley sales are getting on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah!&rdquo;  said Lady Canvey, with a pained look. &ldquo;Why have you such a bitter tongue?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must defend myself somehow. You wouldn&rsquo;t have me scratch and bite, would you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would have you be more womanly and lovable, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  a thousand a year, and such a husband as I have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  man is what his wife makes him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  generally go to other men&rsquo;s wives to be manufactured. Besides, so far as Jim is  concerned, you can&rsquo;t make a silk purse out of a certain animal&rsquo;s ear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, I am an old woman, and perhaps rather sharp-tongued at times, but I have  a motherly feeling for you. Can&rsquo;t you give up this wild life, and go abroad to  devote yourself to Jim? He has his good points, my dear, and if you would try  and live more amicably with him, I am sure you would be a happy woman. Then, in  a year or so, you could come back to Curzon Street, with all the debts paid, and  your full income to live on. Believe me&rdquo;&mdash;she laid a withered hand on Leah&rsquo;s  beautiful arm&mdash;&ldquo;I speak for the best, my dear girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  smiled disdainfully. &ldquo;Now that the sermon&rsquo;s over, can I pass round the plate?&rdquo;  she said cruelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  for me to put money in,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, with a flush. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t give you a  penny. It is useless talking to you, Leah; your one idea is money and enjoyment  and love of admiration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me that those are three ideas,&rdquo; replied Lady Jim, rising; &ldquo;but as our  conversation is neither enjoyable nor instructive, I shall go away.&rdquo; All the  same she lingered, and talked in a low tone, with unexpected emotion. &ldquo;You  blame me, Lady Canvey, for being what I am. Pray, what chance have I had of  being otherwise? I lost my mother when I was a child; I was brought up by a  neglectful and selfish father; I am married to a husband who has nothing of the  man about him, save those handsome looks, which lured me into a much-regretted  marriage. All my life I have lived with worldly and material people, and your  counsel has been as worldly as that of any one of them. I have never been shown  the difference between right and wrong, and there isn&rsquo;t a single soul in the  world who has a spark of love for me. If my up-bringing and surroundings had been  better, I might be a good woman&mdash;so far as I can be, I <i>am</i> a good woman. I  have my moments of regret&mdash;I have my moments when I wish I could be a religious,  dowdy saint. But who will help me out of the mire&mdash;who will&mdash;?&rdquo; Here she broke  off, for her emotion was becoming too strong for the publicity of the place.  With a violent effort, which showed the strength and courage of her nature, she  calmed down, and the colour faded from her face, as did the frown, which gave  place to a cynical smile. Annoyed with herself for having given Lady Canvey a  glimpse of her better nature, she walked away, leaving the old woman surprised  and startled, and, in her own selfish way, truly sorry. There was much truth in  what Leah had said.</p>
  <p>But  her mask was on again the moment she crossed to the door, and Demetrius, who  was obviously looking for her, saw only the beautiful, calm woman he knew so  well. His face was as agitated as Leah&rsquo;s had been a few minutes previously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,  I must see you privately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an extraordinary request, monsieur!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but you will understand&mdash;&rdquo; He threw out his hands expressively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I am ignorant of the deaf and dumb language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cruel&mdash;cruel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silly&mdash;silly,&rdquo;  she mocked, then glanced round with up-raised eyebrows; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make a scene,  monsieur, or I shall begin to believe that you appreciate our English custom of  lingering over the wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you let me explain?&rdquo; entreated the Russian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;to-morrow,  at four. I&rsquo;ll be in the picture gallery. Good night&rdquo;; and with a friendly nod  she moved away.</p>
  <p>Demetrius  swore softly in Russian, which is a most picturesque language in many ways.  Without a glance, Lady Jim ascended the stairs, well pleased. Demetrius was  losing command of himself, and therefore would be all the easier to manage,  should she require his services. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that twenty thousand before spring,&rdquo;  she decided.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10</b> </h2>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is love?&rdquo; asked Leah, the next day, at twenty minutes past four of a clear  wintry afternoon.</p>
  <p>With  all his knowledge of five languages, Demetrius could find no answer, and rose  from his knees with the feelings of a man who is trying to melt an iceberg with  a lucifer match. Ever since Lady Jim arrived to keep her appointment in the  picture gallery, he had been explaining his feelings at length, and in the  orthodox attitude of a mortal worshipping a goddess. He had crossed his &ldquo;t&rsquo;s&rdquo;  and dotted his &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; with the utmost precision. From English he had glided into  French, to plead the attractions of illicit passion: two minutes of German  resulted in sentimental assertions of that passion&rsquo;s righteousness, and in  illustrations of Wertherism; and, immediately before she asked that impossible  question, he had harked back to her native tongue, to impress upon her the  solid British common-sense of his wooing. Leah listened to this polyglot  love-making with the feeling that she was camping under the tower of Babel.  Demetrius might have been a gramophone, pouring out recitations from the poets,  for all the impression his impassionate rhetoric made on her well-trained  feelings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose all these speeches can be classified under the heading of love,&rdquo; she  said unkindly, when his exhaustion gave her an opportunity of intervening. &ldquo;But&mdash;what  is love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been trying to explain,&rdquo; stammered the Russian, getting on his legs  dispiritedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  your intentions are of the best. I gather that much; but I am still waiting for  a definition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love  is worship,&rdquo; ventured Demetrius, rashly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why aren&rsquo;t you on your knees?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been on my knees for fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!  When did you look at your watch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  heart told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  your heart is a time-keeper, or perhaps a time-server.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will permit me to serve you, my service will be for all time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  It seems we are immortal, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are,&rdquo; he declared passionately; &ldquo;every goddess is immortal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim laughed. This war of words was amusing and pretty, but she wished to arrive  at some conclusion which would repay her for spending an hour in a cold  gallery, packed with shockingly bad pictures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am waiting for your definition of love,&rdquo; she said at length.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot explain the impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me that you have been trying to do so. Would you like to hear how I  define love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  eyes burned like two menacing stars. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he muttered in a husky voice, and  holding his passions in leash.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love  is sacrifice,&rdquo; said Leah, slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&mdash;love you,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;There is no sacrifice I would not make for your  dear sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I believe that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try  me,&rdquo; and he again dropped on his knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  up,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, brusquely. He did so. &ldquo;Take a seat!&rdquo; He did so. &ldquo;Look at  the floor, and not at me.&rdquo; He did so. &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; she continued, feeling  relieved that those fierce eyes were not making her flesh creep, &ldquo;do you know  what you are, Monsieur Demetrius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fool,&rdquo; he murmured bitterly, his gaze on the parquetry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  quite agree with you,&rdquo; she rejoined promptly. &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. Because you don&rsquo;t love Katinka Aksakoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has that to do with this?&rdquo; he said gloomily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything.  She is free and I am not; she loves you, and I don&rsquo;t; she will do you good, I  shall do you harm; she can gain your pardon and make your fortune&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you can make me happy,&rdquo; cried Demetrius, looking up with the air of one who has  found a clinching argument.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  the crumbs from my husband&rsquo;s table?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t love him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  British-matron portion of Leah revolted against this plain speaking. She liked  sugar-coated speeches. &ldquo;You have no right to say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no right to make love to you,&rdquo; cried the doctor, rising, &ldquo;but I do.  Pschutt&rdquo;&mdash;he snapped his fingers&mdash;&ldquo;what care I for that English pig, your  husband? As to that young fool who sat beside you last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim clapped her hands, and jumped up, laughing. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, with great  enjoyment, &ldquo;so it was Mr. Askew&rsquo;s attentions that made you lose your head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not my heart. I lost that months ago, when I first met you. Ah, you cruel  woman, have I not worshipped and adored you these many days? Do I not ache  here?&rdquo; he struck his breast passionately. &ldquo;Have you not made my life miserable  with your looks and smiles and coldness and beauty?&rdquo; He seized her hands  roughly. &ldquo;I love you so much that I&mdash;even I, Constantine Demetrius&mdash;could kill  you&mdash;kill you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  released herself with a cold laugh. &ldquo;That sounds as though you were in earnest.  But if I could return your love&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  he made a step towards her, trembling and breathing hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment.&rdquo; She waved him back, and retreated herself to the window. &ldquo;Supposing I  could love you&mdash;what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would&mdash;I would&mdash;&rdquo; He flung out his hands with a sob. &ldquo;What is your price?&rdquo; he  cried savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  crudely you put things!&rdquo; said Lady Jim, coolly. &ldquo;My price is your services, to  be given blindly, and without question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  my reward?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marriage  with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  stared, and gazed at her with unaffected amazement. &ldquo;You mock me,&rdquo; he said  faintly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I am in earnest. It is true that I am not free now. But,&rdquo; she looked at him  steadily, &ldquo;you can make me so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder,&rdquo;  whispered Demetrius, looking up and down the long, empty, chill gallery, and  not at the Eve who was tempting him.</p>
  <p>Leah  blazed out into genuine rage. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she cried, stamping her foot.  &ldquo;Not a hair of Jim&rsquo;s head shall be harmed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how&mdash;how&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down and listen,&rdquo; she said, pointing to a chair. &ldquo;I have a deeper feeling for  you than you think. No; leave my hand alone. We are now talking business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Business,&rdquo;  echoed Demetrius, blankly.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim nodded composedly. &ldquo;The pleasure can come later. You have no money, no  title, no position&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can make money,&rdquo; he explained rapidly; &ldquo;and I can take up again my title of  Prince, which I dropped when I became a doctor. As the wife of a Russian noble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have to make your peace with the Czar to get these things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Through  Mademoiselle Askakoff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  there are other ways. I am not worthy of Katinka&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  therefore, think yourself worthy of me,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, calmly. &ldquo;Thank you!  There&rsquo;s nothing like being honest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you do not understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, I do. I understand that you can make me a cheap sort of princess, and in  some way can give me money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  that you require&mdash;as my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have the lamp of Aladdin, then,&rdquo; said Leah, with a shrug. &ldquo;My capacity for  spending will try even your finances. But at the present moment I have not a  penny, neither has my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  asked the doctor, anxiously.</p>
  <p>Now  that the plunge was made she found less difficulty in speaking plainly. Leaning  towards him, till the perfume of her hair and the close neighbourhood of her  whole gracious person nearly maddened him into seizing her in his arms, she  proceeded rapidly. &ldquo;My husband&rsquo;s life is insured for twenty thousand pounds. If  you as a doctor can arrange to satisfy the insurance company of his death, so  that we can get the money, he will disappear, and I, in the eyes of the world,  shall be free to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean that I should give him a drug, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I mean&mdash;Harold Garth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  peasant patient. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  stupid you are,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, with unfeigned irritation. &ldquo;This man Garth is  very like Jim, and is apparently dying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can&rsquo;t live another two months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the matter is easily managed. Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Demetrius, whose quick brain seized the feasibility of the scheme at  once. &ldquo;But will your husband give you up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  nodded, not wishing to be too explicit. &ldquo;We have arranged that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  does he know that his disappearance means our marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  He thinks you are poor, and will do anything for money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Demetrius, sarcastically. &ldquo;Then the high-born nobleman does not credit me  with being a gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it matter what he thinks?&rdquo; said Lady Jim, impatiently. &ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t trouble  about him after he disappears. Can it be managed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  if you will promise to marry me when you are free and in possession of this money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave him both hands. &ldquo;I do promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  bent down and kissed them, passionately. &ldquo;Consider it done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  any scandal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly.  Listen! The Duke wishes to save the life of this Garth, because&mdash;he is fond of  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; I understand. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say to the Duke that a warm climate will work wonders,&rdquo; continued Demetrius,  dramatically. &ldquo;He will gladly consent, and with this Garth I go to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Nice, or Cannes, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the doctor, sharply. &ldquo;If I set foot on the Continent I may be captured by  the secret police. I have no wish to take Garth with me to Siberia,&rdquo; he added  sarcastically. &ldquo;It is not a warm climate. The Azores&mdash;Madeira&mdash;Jamaica&mdash;Barbados&mdash;any  such place, will make him better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want him to be made better,&rdquo; said the other conspirator, na&iuml;vely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  that to me, madame. Garth will die as Garth, and be buried as Milor, your  husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; said Leah, with a shudder. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are scrupulous,&rdquo; rejoined Demetrius, with a shrug. &ldquo;But make your mind easy.  Garth cannot live&mdash;he may die on the voyage&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  he may live for months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  shrugged his shoulders again. &ldquo;In that case, I may have to assist nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Leah, again, and very determinedly. &ldquo;I could never spend the money with  any pleasure if I thought that you&mdash;you assisted nature,&rdquo; she ended faintly, not  liking to use a strong word.</p>
  <p>The  Russian looked at her with silent surprise. He could not understand why she  should be scrupulous in one thing and not in another. She contemplated a fraud  on the insurance company, and bigamistic marriage with him, so it was  impossible to guess why she should object to the inclusion of a third crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it would scarcely be murder,&rdquo; said Demetrius, continuing his train of thought  aloud. &ldquo;He is so ill, this poor Garth, that the relief of death&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  interrupted Leah, who both looked and felt pale. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it. Let the poor  man die in peace. If he dies otherwise, I shall refuse to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may do that in any case,&rdquo; said the doctor grimly. &ldquo;What hold have I over you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need for you to have any hold,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, wincing, and feeling that  she had indeed delivered herself into the power of the enemy. &ldquo;But if you think  I will not keep my promise you are mistaken. I swear to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  well,&rdquo; said Demetrius, with a penetrating look. &ldquo;If you do not marry me, you  cannot marry another, since your husband will always be alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke with slow significance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you make him out to be immortal also,&rdquo; said she, with an uneasy laugh; then  felt the necessity of bringing this interview to a conclusion. &ldquo;We must part  now. It will not do for us to be seen talking together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree,&rdquo; said Demetrius, gravely; &ldquo;your proposal alters our relations entirely.  In society, I will speak to you little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim nodded, and put her handkerchief to her lips with a feeling of nausea. Now  that her scheme was taking shape, its outlines appeared rather repulsive. To  read of such a plot conceived and detailed by a dexterous author was amusing  and stimulating; to engage in its execution meant worry, and a fearful  ignorance as to what might happen, should things go awry. The same difference  might be supposed to exist between Aldershot man&oelig;uvres and a real battle.  Theorising in criminality was easy; practice would be both difficult and  dangerous.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  she might have to pay a very large price for the privilege of engaging in this  questionable transaction. Demetrius would certainly exact his bond in genuine  Shylock fashion. Needless to say, she had no intention of marrying him, and  trusted to the providence of the peacock fetish to avoid the necessity though  at the moment she saw no means whereby she could escape fulfilling her promise.  This reflection almost made her draw back. As yet, she was not under the doctor&rsquo;s  thumb, and could extricate herself even at this eleventh hour by denying  everything, should he dare to speak out. But a second thought of her desperate  need of money, a sordid vision of cheap hotels and ready-made frocks, a  shuddering remembrance that the future, as it now stood, meant limited  pocket-money and the everlasting boredom of Jim&rsquo;s society, turned the scale in  favour of the venture. &ldquo;Be bold! Be bold!&rdquo; said the warning of the door in the  old fairy tale, and Leah thought the advice worth taking. But she forgot the  concluding words, &ldquo;Be not too bold!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  leave details to you,&rdquo; she said to her companion, when they had concluded their  nefarious bargain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,  I relieve you of all responsibility,&rdquo; said Demetrius, now quite his grave,  restrained self. &ldquo;But, should I tell the Duke that your husband is suffering  from consumption, you will endorse my statement, I trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Consumption?  Jim? Oh, Lord, he&rsquo;s as healthy as a pig.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will not be if he takes a certain medicine,&rdquo; said the man, dryly.</p>
  <p>Leah  had a conscience, though for years it had been persistently snubbed into  holding its peace. After all, Jim <i>was</i> her husband, and she had no right  to sanction tricks being played on his robust health. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo; Her  voice died away nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean business,&rdquo; Demetrius flashed out. &ldquo;I love you, and I mean to win you. The  price that you ask shall be paid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  harm to Jim or this man Garth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  swear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case&rdquo;&mdash;Leah extended her hand, to withdraw it suddenly before the Russian  could rain kisses on its soft whiteness. A choking sensation, new to one of her  superb health, made her gasp frantically after the breath which seemed to be  leaving her. With unexpected force came a new sensation. This abominable  playing with the lives and hearts of men stirred up to vehement protest a  hitherto unknown better self which overwhelmed her with wave upon wave of  reproachful shame. Conscience, uppermost for once in her greedy, selfish,  animal life, stripped the contemplated sin of its allurements, and she recoiled  before an inward vision of the horror her baser nature was creating. It might  prove to her what the monster proved to Frankenstein, and haunt her with  nightmare insistence for the remainder of an unbearable life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  weak, madame?&rdquo; asked Demetrius, reading the secret handwriting on the wall like  a very Daniel.</p>
  <p>The  sneer nerved her, and she strove desperately to escape from the light of heaven  into the material darkness, that would not reveal her sin, unclothed and  shameless. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried in a loud, ringing voice. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  the celestial light mercilessly and mercifully disclosed the inward foulness of  that fair-seeming sin, and the sight beat down her pride and courage into  nothingness. &ldquo;I take it all back,&rdquo; she stuttered, broken-up and panic-struck. &ldquo;Forget&mdash;don&rsquo;t  move in&mdash;in&mdash;&rdquo; Something clicked in her throat, and only by a violent effort did  she repress the climbing hysteria. Incapable of speech, and only anxious to  escape from this extraordinary influence, which compelled her to face the  powers of darkness in their naked horror, she passed swiftly down the long,  echoing gallery. Not till she was safe in her own room did she halt, to  consider why she had fled. Her brain was now clear, and the actual world  resumed its wonted aspect. Her face was still white, her lips still quivered,  her soul was still shaken by the visitation. But, with a courage worthy of a  better cause, she sat down and fought with her fears, till the colour returned  and the nerves came under control. Yet her material nature could not grasp that  the terrible gift of the interior sight had been hers for one short moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a fool!&rdquo; she assured herself harshly.</p>
  <p>And  she was. For, as the walls of the flesh closed round her soul, to darken it  anew, her good angel, who had wrought the miracle, weeping for the blind that  would not see and the deaf that would not hear, left her despairingly. Then the  powers of darkness soothed her into such contentment, that she laughed  scornfully at her late folly, and adopted their explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  run down with all this worry,&rdquo; said Lady Jim. &ldquo;I really need a tonic.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11</b> </h2>
  <p>A  triple knock at the door both interrupted Leah&rsquo;s meditations and annoyed her,  as she was far from wishing for company. It could not be Jim, as he usually banged  the panels impatiently, and walked in before the invitation to enter could be  heard through the noise of his tattoo. Besides, Jim, for obvious reasons,  connected with Askew, had made himself scarce for the last four-and-twenty  hours. Should it be a visitor, Leah resolved to decline conversation,  especially with one of her own sex. But the women of the house-party so rarely  ventured into Lady Jim&rsquo;s sitting-room, that she concluded the disturber to be  some servant with a message. Perhaps Jim had broken his head while skating, or  had made a hole in the ice. If so, his death would greatly simplify matters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in,&rdquo; she cried impatiently, and to her surprise, Lionel presented himself, with  a somewhat diffident look. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, padre!&rdquo; Lady Jim had picked up the  word from a Sandhurst cadet. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,&mdash;anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  should be wrong?&rdquo; inquired Kaimes, closing the door and remaining on the  inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know. I always expect bad news when I see a lawyer&rsquo;s letter or a parson&rsquo;s  face. Well? Has Lady Canvey been converted, or has Jim gone to that place where  the climate forbids skating?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort has happened,&rdquo; said Lionel, dryly. &ldquo;I have merely come to chat with  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down, then, though I warn you I don&rsquo;t feel companionable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are worried.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear man, when am I anything else but worried, with Jim for a husband, and the  Duke behaving like Shylock at his worst? You and Jim have made a mess of  things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know about Jim,&rdquo; said Lionel, resenting this ungrateful speech, &ldquo;but I  did my best to put matters in the right light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord, who wanted a right light? The less light on Jim&rsquo;s and my affairs the  better. A few white lies would have resulted in a larger sum than that  miserable two hundred with which the Duke insulted us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not in the habit of telling lies, white or black, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay. You parsons are so ridiculously punctilious. As if diplomatic lies  were not as oil on the troubled waters of this world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not come to discuss this,&rdquo; said Lionel, seeing how utterly impossible she  was, &ldquo;but to help you in your trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I was reading in the library, when a feeling came to me that I must  see you at once&mdash;that you needed assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  looked rather queer. What could he possibly know of her late experience? &ldquo;Telepathy,  I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that may be the scientific name for the Divine Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Divine Spirit,&rdquo; he repeated, firmly and seriously. &ldquo;I believe that the impulse  to seek you came from above. You are in danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I&mdash;of being bored to death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t deny that you are in trouble of some sort. I can see it in your  expression.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  trouble is my own. I share it with no one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you are in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray  don&rsquo;t question me,&rdquo; snapped Leah, with a nervous glance around. This  interference of the Unseen with her material affairs was both weird and  uncomfortable. She could not deny the panic that had driven her headlong from  the security of the flesh, and it was remarkable that Lionel, unsummoned and unsought,  should seek her at so critical a moment. The feeling that he was meddling with  what did not concern him, annoyed her the more. &ldquo;I wish you would not frighten  me,&rdquo; she cried, with an angry determination to stop this uncanny business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it is your conscience that is frightening you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  there is something serious the matter, or I should not have been called to your  assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never called you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  your good angel did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe in such things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you believe in anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said defiantly&mdash;&ldquo;in myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a poor help in time of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have managed very well hitherto.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you substantiate that statement, seeing how embarrassed your worldly affairs  are at this moment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim could find no direct answer. &ldquo;Parsons have nothing to do with worldly  matters,&rdquo; she muttered, averting her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  true. But if I can offer spiritual consolation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  it to Lady Canvey. She needs it more than I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt that, or the call would not have come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a false alarm, padre,&rdquo; she said jeeringly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be preached at, and  you&rsquo;re suffering from indigestion, or softening of the brain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Lady James,&rdquo; said Lionel, rising with a sigh, &ldquo;your limitations may lead you to  look at the matter in that light. But if I can do nothing for you, I can only  retire, after asking your pardon&mdash;as I do&mdash;for my intrusion&rdquo;; and he made for the  door.</p>
  <p>Her  mood changed with feminine rapidity, and she beckoned imperatively that he  should remain. Disguise it as she would to Kaimes, his sudden coming on the top  of her late puzzling experience drove her to acknowledge that something outside  the material was at work. Leah was too clever a woman to deny the existence of  more things in heaven and earth than came within the scope of her knowledge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the duty of you parsons to pry into the secrets of souls, I suppose,&rdquo; she  said, leaning her elbow on the chair arm, and her chin on her hand. &ldquo;But what  interest can you have in my soul&mdash;if I have one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  as other servants of the Master, interest myself in all souls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you may save them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  Christ can do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may deny His power to do so&mdash;I may deny Him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so fall as Peter fell,&rdquo; said Lionel, sadly. &ldquo;Yet he repented with bitter  weeping.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not a tearful woman,&rdquo; she retorted, and turned to look into the fire. She  did not wish to meet his eyes when she spoke the ensuing acknowledgment. &ldquo;You  are a good man, Lionel, and&mdash;and&mdash;you may be able to help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kaimes  resumed his seat. &ldquo;I hope so; but I can only point the way to a better Helper,  and One more powerful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  continued to gaze at the burning coals. &ldquo;I was frightened a few minutes before  you entered,&rdquo; she said abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the question you must answer. By something which made me see what a horrid  nature I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  was silent for a few moments, not quite sure of his speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Unseen presses closely around us,&rdquo; he remarked at length, &ldquo;and at times reveals  itself. For instance, a contemplated sin may be prevented by a spiritual  influence informing the intelligence how terrible the consequences of such a  sin may be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the sin itself rather than its consequence which frightened me,&rdquo; murmured  Leah, so softly that Lionel caught but one word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that you say about sin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim&rsquo;s cunning made her shirk confession. &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;oh, nothing,&rdquo; she said  hurriedly; &ldquo;only it seems to me that everything pleasant is a sin in your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead  Sea Fruit,&rdquo; replied Kaimes, earnestly; &ldquo;fair to the eye, foul to the taste. If  you turn devoutly to the spiritual, the material pleasures of this world lose  their attractiveness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  she said sceptically; &ldquo;but many things goody-goody people of your sort shudder  at are attractive. You can&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no wish to. Satan always supplies us with rose-coloured spectacles,  through which to contemplate his works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim rose and walked up and down the narrow limits of the room, twisting her  hands in a nervous, hesitating way, quite unlike her usually calm, decisive  self. &ldquo;I wish you would not talk nonsense,&rdquo; she snapped; &ldquo;it is absurd to  believe in a personal devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  in a possible hell also, I suppose you would say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  she said carelessly, &ldquo;scientists have explained that away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Inquisition of the middle ages denied that the earth went round the sun,&rdquo;  said Kaimes, grimly; &ldquo;but I understand that it does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clever,  but not convincing. What is the use of talking nursery theology and cheap  science to me? What can you say that is likely to do me good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  patient must be frank with his physician,&rdquo; hinted Lionel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we always tell the exact truth to doctor and lawyer,&rdquo; said Lady Jim,  scornfully, &ldquo;because we fear for our bodies and our property. But who tells the  truth to a parson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  who are convinced of sin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I may as well hold my tongue. I am not convinced of anything, not  even if I ought to make you my father confessor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot compel your confidence. On the other hand, I cannot help you unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless!  Quite so. Let me think,&rdquo; and turning her back on him, she went to the window.  The early winter gloom was blotting out the distant landscape, but near at hand  the spectral glare of the snow revealed blackly the figures of homeward-bound  skaters. The cold deadness of so sinister a world did not tend to soothe Leah&rsquo;s  overstrung nerves, and shrouded Nature could give her no counsel. Had it been a  summer&rsquo;s twilight of nightingales and roses, of sleeping blossoms and murmuring  leaves, she would have recovered sufficient spirit to scoff. But this arctic  waste, livid and still in the half light, reminded her of the frozen hell, in  the deadly chills of which shuddered Dante, the seer. And the virile Saxon word  hinted at the possible, if not at the probable. Of course, it was all very  ridiculous, and her system was out of order. Nevertheless, she felt that some  kindly human comfort and advice might restore her tormented mind to its usual  peace. And whatever she said to Lionel, he would not dare to repeat. As a  cousin, as a gentleman, as a priest, his lips would be triply sealed. And he  might be able to point out a less dangerous path than that towards which the  need of money was driving her. He was a good fellow, too, and honest enough, in  spite of his superstition. She decided to speak, and came back to her chair.  Had she been less material, she could have heard in the stillness the rustling  wings of a returning angel. Lionel looked at her inquiringly. She was about to  speak hurriedly, lest the good impulse should pass away, when Jim&rsquo;s tattoo was  heard. With a snap Leah closed her lips, as he lumbered, red-faced, hearty, and  essentially fleshy, into the room. The mere sight of his tangible commonplace  made the woman thank her stars that she had not blundered into hysterical  frankness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holloa,  Lionel! Holloa, Leah! Sittin&rsquo; in the twilight an&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; secrets&mdash;eh? Mind some  light?&rdquo; He clicked the ivory knob near the door, and the room sprang into vivid  being. &ldquo;Had a jolly day&rsquo;s skatin. Y&rsquo; should ha&rsquo; come, Leah. No end of a lark.  Feel sick?&rdquo; This polite question was asked because she shaded her eyes from the  glare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but I can&rsquo;t stand wild bulls charging into a room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might  call it a china-shop,&rdquo; chuckled Jim, glancing disparagingly at the nicknackery.  &ldquo;Nerves slack, I&rsquo;ll bet. Fresh air an&rsquo; exercise an&rsquo; cheerful company is what  you want, Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  likely to get the last, with you,&rdquo; she rejoined witheringly, for the  overpowering vitality of the man made her wince.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Lionel here&rsquo;s&mdash;been no catch in th&rsquo; way of fun, I expect. Seems to have given  you the hump. Goin&rsquo;, old man? All right! I&rsquo;ll cheer her up. See you at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  curate nodded and went out. Since Jim&rsquo;s plunge into the middle of their  conversation he had not uttered a word, for the interruption had jarred on him,  as on Lady Jim. Moreover, he departed with an intuitive feeling that the golden  moment had passed. And this was truly the case. When she next saw him, Leah  wondered why she had so nearly made a fool of herself. And indeed, she was  already wondering while Jim, obviously embarrassed, discoursed in a breezy,  blundering way, with an attempt at connubial fondness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  old girl,&rdquo; he said, sitting opposite to her, looking fresh and handsome, and  essentially manly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Awfully sorry you&rsquo;re chippy. If I&rsquo;d known I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; come  back to keep you company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  the heavens falling?&rdquo; asked Leah, listlessly.</p>
  <p>Jim,  as usual, could not follow this recondite speech. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re  talkin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; he remarked good-humouredly, and bustling to the bell. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a peg too low, Leah. Tell you what: we&rsquo;ll have tea here, an&rsquo; a talk, if you don&rsquo;t  mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  wife nodded, wondering if he was about to confess his possible Mormonism. She  did not think so, as Jim never confessed anything, unless it was dragged  piecemeal out of him. Her feelings at this moment did not lean towards  cross-examination, so she let him ring the bell and order tea, without using  her too-ready tongue. In fact, she unbent so far as to make use of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  me a dose of sal volatile, Jim,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bottle on my  dressing-table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  old girl,&rdquo; said the sympathetic Jim, again, and stumbling into the next room  with eager haste.</p>
  <p>Leah  smiled to herself. This ready obedience argued a guilty conscience.</p>
  <p>After  Jim dosed her, he was tactful enough to hold his tongue and improve the fire,  without clattering the poker and tongs. Then he pulled down the blinds and drew  the curtains, and altered the shades of the electrics, so that Leah might not  be overpowered by the glare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  quite like a new honeymoon,&rdquo; she said, sarcastically. The drug was doing its  renovating work, and her original devil was returning to a swept and garnished  house, with seven other spirits more wicked than himself.</p>
  <p>Jim  took the remark seriously, and coloured with pleasure. &ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;d get on  rippin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he, enthusiastically. &ldquo;If we only had the money I believe we&rsquo;d  be as happy as birds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  can&rsquo;t be very happy in this cold weather,&rdquo; replied Leah, seeing plainly that  Jim&rsquo;s amiability was owing to a selfish fear of reproval for his iniquities. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  the tea. I don&rsquo;t want any just now, as the sal volatile is doing me good. You  can eat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  can&rsquo;t I, just,&rdquo; said Jim, when the footman left and he was filling himself a  cup. &ldquo;Th&rsquo; skatin&rsquo;s given me an appetite. &lsquo;Sides, I want to get into form; as I&rsquo;ve  somethin&rsquo; serious to say about this insurance business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  looked up suddenly. &ldquo;I thought you had given that the go-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;o&mdash;o,&rdquo;  drawled her husband, not meeting her eyes. &ldquo;Course, th&rsquo; pater&rsquo;s a good sort an&rsquo;  all that. But his arrangement will give us a howlin&rsquo; bad time for the next few  years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; Jim fiddled nervously with a piece of toast, &ldquo;why not get the twenty  thousand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  could be managed, of course, with some little difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Through  that Russian Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius?  Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  see him, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-day.  He&rsquo;ll see the thing through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  his price?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  smiled blandly, as she thought of what Jim would say did she reply honestly to  this question. But she did not intend to. It seemed to her that Jim was driving  her towards the very path which Lionel, unknowingly, wished her to avoid. It  was useless to fight against fate, so she decided, and like many another  person, she laid the blame on those scapegoats, the stars. She was now  completely dominated by the selfish influence of the great god Mammon, and the  lesser sin of lying was swallowed up in the greater one of idolatry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  want a few thousands, of course,&rdquo; she said mendaciously; &ldquo;but, as yet, we have  not fixed any sum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo;  muttered Jim, suspiciously. &ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d want something more than money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  rose indignantly, and proclaimed a virtue that her conscience assured her she  might yet lose. &ldquo;I am an honest woman, Jim,&rdquo; she said haughtily, &ldquo;and, married  or unmarried, I should never allow any man to make love to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seems  to me you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  to pass away the time. I stop short when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  their hearts are broken,&rdquo; growled her husband. &ldquo;Upon my soul, Leah, I&rsquo;m  straighter than you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt that, since you swear by what you haven&rsquo;t got.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  rashly became aggressively virtuous. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been a bad sort of husband to  you, Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen so little of you that it is rather difficult for me to give an  opinion,&rdquo; she said, resting her elbow on the mantelpiece. &ldquo;Mrs. Berring may be  in a better position to judge of your virtues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kaimes  turned white with emotion, and he rose from his low chair as though worked by  springs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; he growled hoarsely. &ldquo;I never married her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Married  who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  lady you talk about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  lady Mr. Askew talked about, you mean. I merely mention her name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not her name. She is Lola Fajardo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  the Estancia, San Jago. So Mr. Askew explained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to make a row&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I ever make rows?&rdquo; asked Lady Jim, impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t care enough about me to raise Cain,&rdquo; said Jim, rather sorry for himself. &ldquo;I  swear I&rsquo;d be a different man, if you were a different woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  husband in the divorce court witness-box makes the same excuse. Sit down, Jim,  and let us talk over the matter quietly. Your infidelities have long since  converted us from man and wife into a business firm to earn money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Leah, I swear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  that soul you know nothing about?&rdquo; she flashed out contemptuously. &ldquo;Talk sense,  if you are capable of doing so. You have been trying to dodge this explanation  ever since you met Mr. Askew last night, in the smoking-room. But now that we&rsquo;ve  stumbled on an opening, perhaps you will explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  that Mr. Askew did <i>not</i> tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s been makin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; out of nothin&rsquo;, the silly ass,&rdquo; protested Jim,  sitting down and handling the poker with a fervent wish that he could use it on  the sailor&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I met Se&ntilde;orita Fajardo at Lima, and later at Buenos Ayres.  Her brother asked me out to their estancia in the camp of Argentina, near  Rosario, and I stopped there for a month. Bit of luck came my way, an&rsquo; I pulled  her from under a beastly mustang, that would have kicked the life out of her.  She took a fancy to me, &lsquo;cause I saved her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I went again to San Jago, last year&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  third visit to South America since our marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Jim, sullenly; &ldquo;an&rsquo; I met Lola&mdash;I mean Se&ntilde;orita Fajardo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t apologise. Lola is a pretty name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  she&rsquo;s a pretty woman, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m flesh an&rsquo; blood,&rdquo; cried Jim, getting up to work  himself into a rage. &ldquo;I met her durin&rsquo; my second visit, an&rsquo; went again to the  estancia on my third. It was no use luggin&rsquo; a title round, for these mouldy  hotel-keepers always make a chap pay for havin&rsquo; a handle to his name, so I  called myself Berring&mdash;James Berring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James  Berring, bachelor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bachelor,  certainly. I haven&rsquo;t married her, and if Askew says I have, he&rsquo;s a liar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  assuredly a marplot,&rdquo; said Leah, dryly, &ldquo;since he has exploded your romance. I  understood from him that this lady loves you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  she does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you love her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  wriggled. &ldquo;Oh, go on&mdash;go on! Kick a chap when he&rsquo;s down!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I had intended to kick, you would have been black and blue by now, Mr. James  Berring. But you needn&rsquo;t flatter yourself that my feelings are hurt in any way.  You&rsquo;re not worth it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Other  women think differently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lola  Fajardo, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I can&rsquo;t help that, can I? If you&rsquo;d been a different sort of woman, I&rsquo;d have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said that before. Had we not better get to business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  insurance business. I don&rsquo;t care for you, and you show very plainly that you  don&rsquo;t care for me. It is useless for us to struggle together like a couple of  ill-matched dogs in leash. Give me fifteen thousand of this money, and then you  can marry your Lola woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  turned white again. &ldquo;You seem jolly anxious to get rid of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you wonder if I do? How many women would take this scandalous matter as quietly  as I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not scandalous,&rdquo; said Kaimes, fiercely. &ldquo;She thinks that I am a bachelor, and I&rsquo;m  not even engaged to her. I have tried to be true to you, Leah,&rdquo; declared Jim,  pathetically.</p>
  <p>His  wife shrugged her shoulders. It was rather late in the day for Jim to talk  sentiment, besides being a waste of time. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked, facing him squarely.</p>
  <p>Jim  read her purpose in a very flinty face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what you want,&rdquo; he said  weakly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  there&rsquo;s no more to be said,&rdquo; remarked Leah, coldly, moving towards the door of  her bedroom. &ldquo;Demetrius will explain, if you will afford him half an hour&rsquo;s private  conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah,  do you really mean it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have meant it from the first moment you put the idea into my head,&rdquo; she said in  a harsh voice. &ldquo;This underhand love-making of yours only makes me the more  determined.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there was no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  lie, Jim. A man can no more love two women than he can serve two masters. Is it  to be Lola Fajardo, or myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  leave it to you, Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I choose the fifteen thousand pounds,&rdquo; she said, and vanished into the bedroom.  Jim took an impulsive step towards the door, but the sharp click of a turning  key showed him that he was locked out for ever.</p>
  <p>That  evening Leah talked so gaily, and looked so beautiful, that her father-in-law  was absolutely fascinated. &ldquo;Is it all right between you and James?&rdquo; he asked  graciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Leah assured him; &ldquo;we understand one another thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12</b> </h2>
  <p>Leah  welcomed the New Year at Firmingham, with the fervent hope that its bounty  would bestow the insurance money, and rid her of an official husband. It really  seemed as though Providence, or the fetish, was in a benign mood, for Jim  caught the worst of colds while skating. Being confined to an undesired bed,  and fed with food tasteless to a cultivated palate, he lost both flesh and  temper. Demetrius talked gravely of weak lungs, and hinted at inherited  consumption. The Duke was anxious, but scarcely surprised, and recalled similar  cases of a grandmother, two ancestors, and a rackety uncle. Lady Jim encouraged  these pulmonary recollections for obvious reasons. She and Demetrius winked  privately at one another like the celebrated augurs, when they heard the old  man&rsquo;s lamentations. Nature was acting strictly on the lines of the Russian&rsquo;s  proposed medicine, and there was no need to dose Jim into a sickly likeness of  Garth. Day by day he grew as white-faced, as haggard, and as lean, until he  became alarmed at the anxiety of Providence to forward the schemes of himself  and Leah.</p>
  <p>But  there was no end to the kindness of an overruling fate. Jim&rsquo;s illness afforded  his wife the opportunity of posing as a sister of mercy, and she fussed round  the patient so ostentatiously, that the Duke was quite touched. He began to  think that Leah was a true ministering angel, and not the money-wasting doll he  had considered her to be. Jim grinned as Leah measured medicine, and fed him  with gruel, and read him interesting bits from the sporting journals.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to get well,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  so, dear?&rdquo; asked his wife, who was profuse of adjectives in private, so that  they might slip out the more easily in public.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look so uncommon dismal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is necessary to keep up appearances,&rdquo; Leah assured him. &ldquo;Besides, this will be  the last chance of my doing anything for you. In future, Lola will soothe your  weary pillow&rdquo;; after which and similar passages of arms, Jim would curse  himself to sleep, and wake up to accuse his wife of wishing to poison him.</p>
  <p>This  fortunate illness kept Lady Jim at Firmingham when the house-party  disintegrated. But as the Duke was a twaddling old ass, and Jim the most trying  of patients, Leah looked upon her ten days&rsquo; boredom as a kind of Lenten  penance. Besides, she had frequent confabulations with Demetrius, to settle  details of the plot. Already the doctor had explained to the Duke that Garth  would die easier in the tropics, and Funchal had been selected as the most  agreeable place for his demise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo; asked Lady Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  husband must go to Jamaica, to wait events.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  events?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  which I propose to bring about,&rdquo; retorted Demetrius, who had his reasons for  not explaining himself too fully.</p>
  <p>Leah  did not question him closely. With a selfish regard for her own safety, in case  anything might leak out, she preferred that the doctor should arrange matters  in his own way. But she obeyed instructions to the extent of hinting to the  Duke that Kingston was the very best place for dear Jim&rsquo;s weak lungs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you go with him?&rdquo; asked Pentland, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, sweetly; &ldquo;we mustn&rsquo;t make too much fuss over him, else he&rsquo;ll  think he&rsquo;s going to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  might,&rdquo; sighed the Duke. &ldquo;I had an uncle&mdash;&rdquo; and he described the sufferings of  old Lord George for the tenth time.</p>
  <p>Leah  comforted him after the manner of one Bildad, a Shuhite. &ldquo;Oh, Kingston will do  Jim no end of good, my dear Duke. It won&rsquo;t cure one lung, but it may patch up  the other. And then, you know, if he gets worse, I can always reach him in  fourteen days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Demetrius think he will die?&rdquo; asked the Duke, piteously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t think poor Jim will ever be so strong as he was,&rdquo; said Leah, gravely; &ldquo;but  he&rsquo;ll hang on, with care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  like my grandmother,&rdquo; muttered the Duke, and then detailed the sufferings of a  dowager duchess, who couldn&rsquo;t be kept alive beyond the age of sixty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Jim lives till that age, I shall be content,&rdquo; said Leah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you thinking of the insurance money?&rdquo; demanded Pentland, with sudden anger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  insurance money? Oh yes, I think Jim did mention something about an insurance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  gets it if he lives till sixty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!  I don&rsquo;t quite understand, Duke, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so, my dear. Has he made his will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Why should he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,  in the event of his dying, the insurance money should be left to you. No will  means trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  had never thought of a will, as it seemed natural that the money should come to  her without the necessity of paying lawyers&rsquo; bills. But her quick brain seized  the chance of smoothing the way to acquiring the fortune with as little trouble  as possible, and she promptly cornered the Duke. &ldquo;<i>You</i> speak to him,&rdquo; she  suggested.</p>
  <p>And  this the Duke did, with the result that a will leaving the money to Leah was  drawn up and signed, after some opposition, by Jim. He did not at all relish  the carrying out of this necessary step. It was too like preparing a death  certificate to please Jim.</p>
  <p>However,  as a reward for his obedience, Demetrius set him on his legs, and Jim went to  Torquay with the devoted Leah. But when he was settled in a comfortable hotel  as an interesting invalid, and with a superfluity of pretty girls to soothe him  with sympathy, Lady Jim left him for a round of visits to various  country-houses. Now that the Duke was out of sight, Jim&rsquo;s connubial comforts  were out of mind; but Leah left strict injunctions that he was not to put on  flesh. Within the month, she was to see him start for Jamaica, and impressed  upon him the necessity of looking quite ready to depart for a place where Jim  had no desire to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see why you want to make a holy show of me,&rdquo; grumbled Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must make your death appear as plausible as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t want to look like a livin&rsquo; skeleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t think Lola will mind,&rdquo; said Leah, cruelly, and started out to enjoy  herself in the best of spirits.</p>
  <p>While  at Lord Sargon&rsquo;s seat in Shropshire, she met Askew in the company of the  fixture. The young man&rsquo;s betrothed was extremely like a dairy-maid, and her  frocks set Lady Jim&rsquo;s teeth on edge. If she could combine colours that did not  match, she always did so, and her character was as colourless as her wardrobe  was gaudy. Marjory was the creature&rsquo;s name, and her conversation was the &ldquo;Pa-pa!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Mam-ma!&rdquo; of a squeaking doll.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  much are you paying for her?&rdquo; asked Leah, after satisfying herself that the  young lady was really a woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  thousand a year,&rdquo; replied the lieutenant, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a bargain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  laugh at me,&rdquo; he implored; &ldquo;you know there is but one woman in the world for  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you told me. Lola&mdash;what&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  one nearer and dearer than her!&rdquo; he murmured, with what the Americans call &ldquo;goo-goo&rdquo;  eyes, whereat Lady Jim laughed, and allowed him to fetch and carry, and sit on  his hind legs and bark prettily, like a well-trained lap-dog. It amused her,  and kept him on tenterhooks. The only annoying thing was, that Marjory seemed  to care little for this annexation of her lover. She much preferred a  fox-hunting squire, who talked &ldquo;stables,&rdquo; and glowered on Askew for not  appreciating the dairy-maid.</p>
  <p>In  this capture of another woman&rsquo;s man, Leah combined pleasure with business. She  did not wish to spoil Jim&rsquo;s little game with the Spanish lady, and it would  never do for Askew to detail Mr. Berring&rsquo;s past in a quarter where such  betrayal would lead to trouble. By this time the amorous sailor was the slave  of beauty, so Lady Jim was sufficiently mistress of his will to limit his  correspondence. This she did one evening after dinner, while admiring Marjory&rsquo;s  new frock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yellow  and green,&rdquo; murmured Leah, when she and Askew filled up a corner, and watched  frantic people playing bridge; &ldquo;poached egg on spinach. If you design her  gowns, Mr. Askew, I should advise a less lavish use of primary colours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  means well,&rdquo; he muttered, apologetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;People  who need excuses for existing always do,&rdquo; retorted Lady Jim; &ldquo;but she is really  a sweetly simple girl, with two ideas, neither of which includes you, my dear  boy. I am sure you will be very happy together, doing cake-walks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doing  cake-walks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  sort of dress always makes me think of South Carolina and the &lsquo;old Kentucky  home,&rsquo; you know. They invented cake-walks there, I believe. But I forgot&mdash;you  prefer places below the equator.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never think of South America,&rdquo; he protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. The jewel is more attractive than the casket. When did you last  hear from Se&ntilde;orita Fajardo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never had a letter from her in my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is cautious, it seems. Are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t write to her, if that is what you mean. I did love her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a polite thing to say to me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t any longer. You see, I thought that Berring&mdash;your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing in that,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, quickly. &ldquo;There never really was, and if you  really love this estancia lady, why not marry her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am engaged already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  me, or to that pretty, vivacious girl over there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Marjory was looking particularly like a wooden Dutch doll at the moment, Askew  reddened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you wouldn&rsquo;t say these things, Lady Jim&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  James!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  James, then. Marjory can&rsquo;t help herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me she has&mdash;to that intelligent young man with the face like a sheep  and the manners of a costermonger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were boy and girl together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  are still, from the infantile look of them. I quite expect to see their nurse  arrive. You know, it won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Leah, gravely; &ldquo;here I am making fun of  Marjory, and you aren&rsquo;t man enough to stand up for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man coloured still deeper, and mumbled something about a woman&rsquo;s  privilege. Shortly he made a lame excuse, and left Leah to devote himself to  Marjory, who was not grateful for the attention. Leah did not mind. She had  learned that Askew did not correspond with Lola Fajardo, and had no intention  of doing so; therefore there was little likelihood that Jim&rsquo;s fettered past  would ever become known at the Estancia, San Jago. Being really a good-natured  woman with her affections thoroughly under control, Leah half decided to loosen  her apron-strings and let Askew lead his bargain to the altar. But this she did  not do, for two obtrusive reasons, firstly, the fox-hunting squire and Marjory  were made for one another; and secondly, it would be just as well to keep the  sailor under her eye for the next year. She did not wish him to hark back to  Lima, for melodramatic purposes.</p>
  <p>After  a very pleasant visit, thanks to Askew&rsquo;s infatuation, Lady Jim returned to  Curzon Street. There she found a letter from Demetrius announcing that he and  Garth had sailed for Madeira early in the previous week, and that it would be  as well if Lord James Kaimes journeyed forthwith to Jamaica. Leah promptly sent  an answer to her accomplice at Funchal, a telegram to Jim, a paragraph to a  society paper, and a lengthy letter of sorrowful forebodings to the Duke. Then  she sat down to wait events, and, meanwhile, considered the situation.</p>
  <p>Pentland  was all right, thanks to her cajoling. Before she left Firmingham he had  arranged to free the income, to pay the debts, and to allow her to occupy the  Curzon Street house until such time as Jamaica should kill or cure Jim. That  interesting invalid had gone halves over the cheque, and Leah&rsquo;s purse still  contained over fifty pounds, which would do for the present. But she intended  to get a few hundreds from the Duke, by playing off Jim&rsquo;s sickly looks and her  own lonely condition of grass-widowhood. It was really very satisfactory, and  she found it hard to look miserable, as in duty bound, when Pentland arrived to  see the last of Jim. Leah arranged that the parting between father and son  should be in town. She did not want to have a bereaved father bothering at  Southampton. The journey back to town after Jim&rsquo;s dispatch would be boring at  the best, and her consolatory powers were not great.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look disgustingly fit,&rdquo; said Leah, when Jim was established on the drawing-room  sofa, with a rug and a few unnecessary medicine bottles, and other sick-room  paraphernalia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry  I can&rsquo;t be more of a corpse,&rdquo; growled the invalid; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not easy to  pretend you&rsquo;re a goner, when y&rsquo; feel fit to jump over the moon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try  and cough louder,&rdquo; suggested his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t!  It hurts m&rsquo; throat. Hang it, I&rsquo;ve lost three stone. I believe you want me dead  in real earnest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim thought for a moment. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, truly enough. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t  treated me over well, and I should have been a different woman, had you been a  different man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Divorce  court lingo,&rdquo; said Jim, remembering what she had said at Firmingham, and with a  derisive laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same, I hope you&rsquo;ll have a good time in South America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not in Jamaica?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you&rsquo;ve got to be thoroughly sick there. Demetrius will come along later with  Garth&rsquo;s corpse, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!  Drop it! What about the money&mdash;my share?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  get the cash, as soon as you are sent home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me?  What for? Ain&rsquo;t I goin&rsquo; to disappear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; said Leah, impatiently; &ldquo;but Demetrius has to embalm your body and  bring you home to the family vault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Jim uneasily; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the other Johnny you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; about.  Leah,&rdquo; he looked round cautiously, &ldquo;I hope Demetrius won&rsquo;t polish off that poor  fellow. He&rsquo;s a sort of relative of mine, y&rsquo; know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  worry your head,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, calmly. &ldquo;Garth&rsquo;s dying as fast as he can; he  may be dead by this time, for all we know. And don&rsquo;t think that I would allow  Demetrius to be so wicked,&rdquo; she cried, with virtuous indignation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a  criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord!&rdquo; was all Jim could find to say, as he thought of what they were doing,  and conversation ended for the time being. Leah went to the theatre and supper  at the Savoy that evening, leaving Jim to practise coughing amongst the useless  medicine bottles.</p>
  <p>Next  day, both Pentland and his eldest son arrived at eleven, and were informed by a  sad-faced wife that her dear husband would travel to Southampton by the  afternoon train. At the sight of Leah&rsquo;s dismal looks and attentive care, Frith  expressed his opinion that women were protean.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  thought you cared so much for Jim,&rdquo; he said bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t for a moment say that I think Jim is a good man,&rdquo; was Leah&rsquo;s artistic  reply; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve had our tiffs, like other married people. But Jim&rsquo;s my  husband, after all. And he has his good points.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim was not prepared with a catalogue of her husband&rsquo;s perfections. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t  know,&rdquo; she murmured vaguely; &ldquo;he drinks in moderation, you know. That&rsquo;s  something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no virtue in resisting a non-existent temptation,&rdquo; said the Marquis, grimly. &ldquo;Jim  doesn&rsquo;t come of a drinking family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  a consumptive one, I believe,&rdquo; retorted Leah, softly.</p>
  <p>Frith  was nettled at the implied slight. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said, with unusual  gruffness. &ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that poor Garth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;and if you&mdash;&rdquo; Frith coloured as he met her derisive eyes,  and devoted himself to his brother.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim left the affectionate trio together, lengthening out their farewells, and  retired, laughing, to her room. It was really amusing to think that Jim, who  was as healthy as a trout in a pond, should be wept over, and coddled, and  pitied, and generally elevated to a sainthood. The business was serious enough,  no doubt; but Leah could not help seeing the humorous side. She felt unequal to  keeping a grave face while the comedy in the drawing-room was being played, and  therefore did not rejoin her husband till the principal comedians had departed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are a couple of rotters,&rdquo; said Jim, gloomily, when she appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  for yourself, my dear,&rdquo; she retorted coolly. &ldquo;Well, and what did they say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  you mind. You&rsquo;d only snigger over a father takin&rsquo; leave of his dyin&rsquo; son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  I did not know that the Duke had seen Harold Garth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah,&rdquo;  cried her husband, fiercely, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a&mdash;never mind. Whatever you are, I&rsquo;m  another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  the Duke leave a cheque for me?&rdquo; asked Leah, more business-like than  sympathetic.</p>
  <p>Jim  banged about among the medicine bottles. &ldquo;Five hundred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  man,&rdquo; cried his wife, snatching the cheque from his very reluctant hand. &ldquo;I  must go and dress for the journey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  you kiss me, Leah?&rdquo; quavered Jim, really moved, and quite forgetting the  rascally plot in which he was taking so prominent a part.</p>
  <p>At  the door she turned with an expression of withering scorn. &ldquo;Keep your kisses  for your wife, Mr. Berring!&rdquo; cried this too-previous widow, and left him to  digest the insult at his leisure.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13"></a>Chapter 13</b> </h2>
  <p>The  paragraph sent by Leah to her pet editor intimated concisely to the  tuft-hunting world of Tom, Dick, and Harriet, that the suddenly developed  pulmonary complaint of Lord James Kaimes necessitated his wintering in Jamaica.  This intelligence surprised the clubs, as Jim&rsquo;s hectoring voice and devotion to  damp field sport had always suggested aggressively sound lungs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  knew him to be chippy in his life,&rdquo; growled one man, who admired Leah as much  as he hated Jim for possessing her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his game this time, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he wants to get away from his wife,&rdquo; hinted a pigeon of Jim&rsquo;s plucking. &ldquo;Bit of  a tongue, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tongue  be hanged! She has both wit and beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pigeon sniggered, knowing the speaker&rsquo;s devotion to Delilah. &ldquo;Oh, Kaimes  appreciates those qualities&mdash;in another man&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scandal!  Scandal!&rdquo; murmured a meek member, blessed with a spouse whose looks prevented  temptation. &ldquo;Kaimes has dined with us many times, but I never saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; <i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; struck in a sporting baronet, whom Leah snubbed on every  possible occasion. &ldquo;Jim likes red-haired women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why doesn&rsquo;t he stick to the one he&rsquo;s legally entitled to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  she sticks to him. If she&rsquo;d only syndicate her admirers in the D. C., Jim &lsquo;ud  be after her like an Indian mosquito in search of a new arrival. I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s  some petticoat in this Jamaica business&rdquo;; and the sportsman looked round for  some one to pander to his besetting sin&mdash;but no one gave him a chance of  committing it.</p>
  <p>Contradiction  and argument arrived with the oldest inhabitant of Clubland, whose memory was  as exasperating as his verbosity. &ldquo;Wrong! All wrong,&rdquo; he purred, like the tame  cat he had been for half a century. &ldquo;Kaimes is really consumptive. I remember  his grandmother dying of tuberculosis. It&rsquo;s in the family, along with gout and  water on the brain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bosh! If Jim was sick, he&rsquo;d sin more judiciously.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew that damnation depended upon health,&rdquo; was the retort. &ldquo;Take a case  in point. During the Great Exhibition&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah&rsquo;s  admirer cut short a much-dreaded anecdote. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll make a lovely widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe in second-hand brides myself,&rdquo; said the horsey man, venturing an  epigram. &ldquo;&lsquo;Sides, her tongue&mdash;cuts like a knife. Even the mares shy when she  kicks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wit!  wit!&rdquo; explained the admirer, who misread French memoirs. &ldquo;She is Madame de  Rambouillet&mdash;without a history.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!  She hasn&rsquo;t published one yet, but I dare say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tut!  tut!&rdquo; interrupted the ancient. &ldquo;Madame de Rambouillet was, and Lady James is,  entirely respectable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the horse is the noblest of all animals,&rdquo; snapped the baronet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe,  though the beast doesn&rsquo;t improve your morals,&rdquo; and the laugh was with the  oldest inhabitant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonder  if Kaimes will die,&rdquo; pondered the man who saw Leah as a probable widow and a  possible wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lay  you ten to five he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will lose; you will most assuredly lose,&rdquo; said the octogenarian. &ldquo;Very  consumptive family, the Kaimes. And our friend is just the sort of healthy man  to depart suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  to?&rdquo; asked the pigeon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hu-s-s-sh!&rdquo;  droned the meek member; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a serious question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Jim!&rdquo; finished the racing man, smartly; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care. Jim, dead or alive,  is equally useless to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  He isn&rsquo;t in your debt, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Catch  me trusting him&mdash;not much. But what&rsquo;s the use of talking obituary notices? Let&rsquo;s  bridge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  your play is as bad as your grammar, I prefer to stand out,&rdquo; said Methuselah,  and the symposium broke up, in time to prevent bickering between crabbed age  and irreverent youth.</p>
  <p>There  were many such talks during the nine minutes&rsquo; wonder of Jim&rsquo;s unexpected  sickness, and it was generally considered that he would return in spirits of  wine to the family vault. Leah did not hear these encouraging prognostications,  so conducive to the entire success of the plot. She was tolerating life at San  Remo, under the hired roof of a truly great dame, who wished to disentangle her  from the golden nets of ultra-fast society. A grass-widow has to be more  careful to keep up appearances than the genuine crape article, even at the risk  of being bored by highly placed humanity, as dull as stainless. Lady Hengist  and her friends belonged to that seventh heaven where newly rich Peris and the  Mammons who cocker them seek admittance in vain. Social laws differ from those  of nature, inasmuch as the gilded scum does not invariably rise to the top.  Hence the creation of the over-discussed smart set, which is taken by the  suburban reader of back stairs journalism as representative of the British  aristocracy.</p>
  <p>Lord  Hengist came of an autochthonous family which had been at home when William the  Conqueror raided the ancestral cabin. His wife was descended from a knight who  emigrated from Normandy in 1066, with apparently several million others,  judging by the claims put forward by those who enter the peerage. This alliance&mdash;they  were too great to talk of mere marriage&mdash;resulted in two children, not made of  ordinary clay, but compounded of the superlative porcelain sort. Their parents  possessed a genuine medi&aelig;val castle, as uncomfortable as the builders knew how  to make it, and which had the rare distinction of possessing a state-bedroom in  which Elizabeth had never slept. The family archives read like the Book of  Numbers, and their ancestors had made history at opulent wages for the benefit  of the Hengist coffers. The men had sided with the Stewarts and ratted to the  Guelphs; the women bloomed in Lely and Kneller portraits in loosely slipping  clothes, with pastoral accessories; and finally, the present head of the house,  with four seats, two children, a charming wife and a large income, lived  comfortably on the loot of ages. Of all these things Lord and Lady Hengist were  so proud that they had no need to exhibit pride.</p>
  <p>Well-born  as Leah Kaimes was, the pleasant, if somewhat stately and stiff, life of these  genuine rulers wearied her intensely. Bread and milk is insipid after a repast  of ortolans in aspic, and a motor-flight is more exhilarating than a  donkey-ride. Moreover, it annoyed her to see how sensibly the Hengists spent  their many pounds a day. They could have had much more fun for the money, had  they known the right shops; but they patronised out-of-date establishments,  where the goods were of an excellent quality, but just five minutes behind the  newest things. Of course, this was Leah&rsquo;s figurative way of saying that the  Hengists came out of the Ark. They always bought the wrong things at the wrong  shops, and had a middle-class eye to the lasting quality of the goods they  purchased. They were clothed rather than dressed, and being colour-blind,  invariably chose garments which matched abominably with their complexions. In a  word, the Hengists were so commonplace as to be original. Lady Jim could not  understand why they should have been thrust into positions which they could not  fill. It was like bringing cows into the drawing-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  so hard for me to taste the pleasures of self-denial,&rdquo; complained Hengist, one  day, as they sauntered on the promenade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think it is wise to attempt the extraction of sunbeams from cucumbers,&rdquo;  said Leah, dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dean  Swift said that, but he was an egotist,&rdquo; replied Hengist, in his serious way,  that reminded Lady Jim of Lionel at his worst. &ldquo;It is more blessed to give than  to receive, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it, indeed? Who said so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  wisest and most loving of mankind. And it is a true saying. I assure you, that  if I deny myself something I greatly desire, and send the money which would  have purchased the gratification to a charity, I feel absolutely happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think I ever tried that experiment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not know true happiness till you do, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I must make a bid for Paradise,&rdquo; she answered, privately thinking that the man  talked sad nonsense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a dreadful thing to be able to have the moon for the asking,&rdquo; went on Hengist,  reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  your epigrammatic way of putting it, I suppose; but the moon won&rsquo;t drop from  her sphere for me, howl as I may. You are very lucky to command the planet,  Lord Hengist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  the world thinks, but it forgets that there is the curse of satiety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there? I never knew it existed. I only wish I could cram the twelve hours of  the day with twenty-four of pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever had everything you wished for, Lady James?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Leah, promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have the sun as well as the moon, and the stars  thrown in, if I had my way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  to be bored by the acquisition of the lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  bored&mdash;oh dear no! I am too stupid. It is only clever people like yourself who  suffer from ennui. I only wish I were a Roman empress, with provinces for a  dowry. Those dear women knew how to live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  in the majestic pages of Gibbon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?  Oh, that man who came to think he was the Roman Empire. Now his work would bore  me&mdash;I&rsquo;m not stupid enough to appreciate him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julia&rdquo;&mdash;this  was Lady Hengist&mdash;&ldquo;Julia and I read Gibbon during the honeymoon, and received  much instruction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord!&rdquo; said Lady Jim; &ldquo;as though honeymoons were not disagreeable enough  without that!&rdquo; The idea made her laugh consumedly. In her mind&rsquo;s eye she saw  this new Paolo and Francesca reading heavy prose in ten volumes. But Hengist  did not even smile&mdash;he had absolutely no sense of humour. Besides, he considered  his companion&rsquo;s chatter painfully frivolous, and sighed to think that she had  such a light nature. Leah, still laughing, glanced sideways. &ldquo;I shall begin to  think you are discontented, Lord Hengist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am, that I cannot do the good I should like to do. Both Julia and I wish to  benefit mankind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  twelve labours of Hercules, with no thanks for their accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t want thanks, but results,&rdquo; said Hengist, austerely; &ldquo;and we can commence  in a small way. Next summer we intend to invite five hundred Whitechapel  children to the Castle. Will you come and help us to entertain them, Lady  James?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo;  yawned Leah, for the man spoke like a copy-book; &ldquo;but I hope you&rsquo;ll wash them  first. It will prevent disease, and give some new soap a philanthropic  advertisement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hengist  eyed her suspiciously. He was a very, very dull young lord, large-hearted and  unintelligent, who took life so seriously that he had almost forgotten how to  laugh. England clean, England contented, England happy. He constantly started  crusades to bring on a premature millennium, and earned his reward, after the  manner of reformers, by being abused in halfpenny newspapers as one who  attempted to avert certain revolution, by stuffing the starving with sweets.  Lady Jim thought him a bore and a prig, and too virtuous to be amusing. But  that he and his wife were of use to her, she would not have endured this  presentation of his year-before-last&rsquo;s Tree-of-Knowledge apples. He never  plucked fresh fruit, and his Eve was quite as blind as he in discerning  up-to-date harvests. Still, Hengist was a sort of bell-wether, leading a flock  of prize sheep towards a closely guarded fold. Leah liked the fun and money and  adulation of the smart set, but she had no notion of being a shut-out Peri from  that dull paradise that the newly rich longed for. Besides, its very dullness  gave a fillip to her enjoyment of the larky amusements of those who could not  enter the sacred ark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am really very fond of children,&rdquo; she said, to do away with the effect of her  last remark. &ldquo;I wish I had some myself,&rdquo; and she sighed very prettily. &ldquo;Hilda  Frith is more fortunate than I, with her two dear babies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both  girls. I fancy Frith would like a son and heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure he would, and both Jim and I would be the very first to congratulate him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  husband is next in succession?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  poor dear! But Frith is strong and healthy, while darling Jim&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t bear  to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was perfectly true. To invent sentimental domestic histories and bewail a  husband she detested was difficult, even to a woman of Leah&rsquo;s imagination and  tact. But Hengist thought it was very good of her to talk so generously, and  paid her serious compliments till she began to think that some unpardonable sin  had thrown her into the society of this prosing creature. It was like reading  the dictionary, or drinking Homburg waters, or paying bills. The sight of a  friend made her gasp with relief, after the manner of a pearl-diver rising to  take the air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  Lady Richardson and Sir Billy,&rdquo; she said with a frown, for her companion&rsquo;s  benefit. &ldquo;So horrid, to interrupt our nice conversation!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can pass them,&rdquo; replied Hengist, decidedly pleased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; was Leah&rsquo;s quick reply. &ldquo;It would look rude; and then, Fanny  Richardson never passes any one who will listen to her prattle of chiffons.  Besides, Billy is a nice boy&mdash;quite a little man. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  much a man for his years,&rdquo; said her companion, austerely. &ldquo;I do not like  Chesterfields in their teens. The lad&rsquo;s manners are too good&mdash;much too good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  any child be much too good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the wrong way of over-artificiality, yes. Sir William&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  likes to be called Sir Billy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  flippant. His mother should insist&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She!  She never insists on anything, except having the newest dye and the best-cut  frock, and a few dozen male ears to pour her babble into. Billy can do no wrong  in her eyes, nor in mine. He is such an admirer of women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  at the age of thirteen,&rdquo; groaned Hengist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now, even you must have made love to some pretty pastry-cook&rsquo;s daughter when  you were at Eton. There must be some of the old Adam in you, Lord Hengist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was never an entirely modern child,&rdquo; replied the serious man, evasively, and  with a sad eye on the trim figure of the rapidly approaching Billy. &ldquo;To think  that he should take dinner pills, and know the difference between sweet and dry  champagne! What will the next generation be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Boys  and girls,&rdquo; said Leah, flippantly. &ldquo;Good day, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  vivacious little fairy who warmly greeted Lady Jim and her solemn escort was as  pretty and fragile and dainty as a Dresden china shepherdess, and quite a  credit to the maid who re-created her every morning. There was nothing natural  about her, save her genuine adoration of Billy, and that arose from a knowledge  that royalty had made it fashionable to exploit the nursery. Blonde and plump,  jimp and graceful, dressed in perfect taste, and coloured in the latest  fashion, she was popular even with her own discriminating sex. Hengist thought  her a respectable doll, with no particular vices, and did not object to having  her at the Castle. But he disapproved of Billy the precocious, which was  decidedly unfair, as Billy could scarcely help shaping himself to the mould  into which he had been slipped by a mother who required his assistance to play  the pretty comedy of the widow&rsquo;s only son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you, Leah darling? So sweet you look, and Lord Hengist too. A most unexpected  meeting, and so delightful,&rdquo; babbled Lady Richardson, who talked more and said  less than any society gramophone. &ldquo;Billy and I are just going to Monte Carlo,  to plunge on the red. Reggy Lake is to meet us at the station; such a nice boy&mdash;Lancers,  you know&mdash;a great chum of Billy&rsquo;s. Won&rsquo;t you come too, Leah, to brighten Billy  up? He&rsquo;s got the hump, poor boy, as his new nerve-tonic doesn&rsquo;t suit him, and  such a lovely, lovely day as it is too. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Lord Hengist?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  respectable Hengist&rsquo;s hair bristled at this incoherent speech, and did not lie  down again at the look in Billy&rsquo;s eyes. Dressed in a particularly smart Eton  suit, gloved and silk-hatted and patent-leather-booted with fashionable  accuracy, the boy appraised Lady Jim&rsquo;s beauty in a calm way, which would have  made a captain of dragoons blush. Behind his graceful, nonchalant, handsome  mask of youth was hidden an old, old man, and in many ways Hengist was his  junior. He certainly blushed when Leah gave him an amused glance, but this was  Billy&rsquo;s way of mashing the sex. He knew the value of youthful diffidence,  backed by mature knowledge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Should  not your little boy be at school?&rdquo; asked Hengist, scandalised into an implied  snub.</p>
  <p>Sir  William looked at the troubled face of his elder with the serenity of a cherub.  &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; back nex&rsquo; week,&rdquo; said he, carefully dropping his &ldquo;g&rsquo;s.&rdquo; &ldquo;Th&rsquo; little  mother wanted me to look after her for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Billy  can&rsquo;t trust me out of his sight,&rdquo; giggled Lady Richardson. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so afraid I&rsquo;ll  give him a second father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Reggy Lake, anyhow. He&rsquo;s a rotter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  a rotter, Sir Billy?&rdquo; asked Lady Jim, enjoying the disgusted looks of Hengist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fellow who rots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an admirable definition?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy  rapidly dropped his left eyelid, and showed a set of white teeth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  carry coals to <i>your</i> Newcastle,&rdquo; he said parabolically. &ldquo;Say, Lady Jim,  chuck this chappy, and come to Charlie&rsquo;s Mount.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  wink and the speech were lost on Hengist, for he was being worried by Lady  Richardson. She danced before him, a pretty figure gowned in burnt-almond red,  and would have distracted his heart with daintiness but that Julia kept that  article in the nursery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  join us, Lord Hengist,&rdquo; she pleaded seductively. &ldquo;Such fun, when you know the  ropes. Billy can show them to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out  of the mouth of babes and sucklings,&rdquo; quoted Hengist, ironically. &ldquo;Quite a new  reading, Lady Richardson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  you are horrid,&rdquo; said the widow, who did not know in the least what he meant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell your wife. By the way, how is she, and the darling, darling twins? Twins  are too sweet. I wish Billy was a twin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of Sir William is quite sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about, and it&rsquo;s very horrid of you to  say so. Billy is adored.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he ever whipped?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Richardson gave a scream. &ldquo;How barbarous! The man who tried to whip Billy would  have to order his coffin beforehand. Billy can handle his bunches of fives, I  can tell you, Lord Hengist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  Billy&rsquo;s way of putting boxing. You should see him give the postman&rsquo;s knock! Oh,  he <i>is</i> clever! He can drive a motor, too, and pick out the winner five  times out of ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  he know the kings of England?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he hasn&rsquo;t been to Court yet, and of course, there&rsquo;s only one. How funny you  are! Well,&rdquo; Lady Richardson put her head on one side like a coaxing cock-robin,  &ldquo;are you coming with Billy and me? Do, oh do! We have afternoon tea with  Monsieur Aksakoff and his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo; asked Leah, overhearing the names; &ldquo;the Russian man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stiff  sort of fella&rsquo;!&rdquo; said young Eton. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; birdish about him. Daughter&rsquo;s a  clipper, though. Say, little mother, we&rsquo;d best get. Th&rsquo; train won&rsquo;t wait, y&rsquo;  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  he had finished speaking Lady Jim had made up her mind. She had not heard from  Demetrius, and it was not impossible that he had written to Katinka. In spite  of his discouraging love-making he kept in with her, on the chance that she  might be able to procure his pardon, and in any case she was useful in keeping  him posted in the doings of the Third Section. The girl was so infatuated that  she never saw he was making use of her in this way, and constantly wrote to him  about any official gossip she heard. There was something pathetic in her  devotion and heart-whole love for the man who deceived her. But Leah did not  look at the matter in this way. She knew that Katinka, if any one, would have  news of the doctor, and being anxious to learn how Garth was progressing  towards the grave, she turned to Hengist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I&rsquo;ll go over,&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;Jim asked me to see M. Aksakoff  on some business. Would Julia mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; said Hengist, heartily, and quite deceived. &ldquo;I would escort you, only  I have some letters to write about the distress in London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Billy will look after us,&rdquo; said that young gentleman&rsquo;s mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>have</i> driven a team before now,&rdquo; observed Billy, with dignity.</p>
  <p>  Hengist gave him a reproving look (which Billy bore very stoically), and  whispered to Leah as they parted, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage that lad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think he needs much encouragement,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, laughing, and the two  women walked away with Billy between them. Hengist stood where he was and  frowned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Charming  woman, Lady James,&rdquo; he murmured, gazing after Leah&rsquo;s amethystine gown; &ldquo;but  that lad&mdash;ugh!&rdquo; He shook his head over young England up-to-date; then returned  to the villa to hear the twins say the alphabet. Life had its compensations,  even for a millionaire peer.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14</b> </h2>
  <p>After  the happy-go-lucky fashion of Italian officialism, the train was detained for  some time at Ventimiglia. Lady Richardson, unsettled as a fly, changed her seat  five times, and complained garrulously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain  Lake is so very particular,&rdquo; she explained, producing a pocket-mirror and a  powder-puff to repair possible damages. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t bear to be kept waiting five  minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I should make him wait five hours,&rdquo; replied Leah, calmly. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t do to  spoil men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  spoil me,&rdquo; said Sir Billy, audaciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  You are merely a rascal in the making. I wouldn&rsquo;t hint how we govern your sex,  if you were anything but a grub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  boy laughed complacently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a very nice grub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  precocious, at all events. You know much more than is good for you. Fanny, you  should whip him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t the heart or the muscle, my dear. The only safe thing will be to marry  a strong man with a bad temper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should jolly well like to see the stepfather who would pitch into me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will, if you don&rsquo;t behave. Isn&rsquo;t that eyebrow a little crooked, Billy?&rdquo; and she  fingered it delicately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  think so; but you have a smudge of powder on your chin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I have. How horrid! There!&rdquo; dusting it off. &ldquo;What a comfort you are to your  darling mammy, my own! Kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy  brushed her rouge with careful lips, and after a glance to see that he had not  blurred the picture, Lady Richardson put away the mirror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  goodness, we&rsquo;re moving again,&rdquo; she prattled. &ldquo;I do hope Reggy won&rsquo;t be in a bad  temper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  square that, little mother. Been to the theatres lately, Lady Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  answered Leah, amused by his man-about-town air. &ldquo;Is there anything good on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awful  stuff,&rdquo; announced Billy, with the conviction, of mature judgment. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sit  out more than two plays. <i>The Woman with Three Husbands</i> isn&rsquo;t bad,  though. Very French, of course. Saw it four times before I told the little  mother she couldn&rsquo;t face it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  alluring! Will you take me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy  was obviously shocked. &ldquo;No woman should see that piece. I can stand heaps, but&mdash;&rdquo;  an after-me-the-deluge shrug hinted at the degradation of the drama.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  poor darling,&rdquo; chimed in his mother; &ldquo;he was blushing three inches deep all  over when he came home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to hear that Billy can blush at all,&rdquo; murmured Lady Jim. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the  betting, William?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tolerable!  I pulled off a fiver on Fly-by-Night; but a man in my form lost a tenner, silly  juggins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  How old is that man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sixteen,  and thinks he&rsquo;s twenty. Awfully saucy chap though. Went nap on a girl, and  another fella&rsquo; scooped th&rsquo; pool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  they teach English at Eton, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  youth was quite undisturbed. &ldquo;Try to,&rdquo; he assured her; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no snap  about the classical rot they give us. Oh, here we are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  there is Reggy,&rdquo; cried Lady Richardson, craning her dyed head out of the window  like another Jezebel. &ldquo;How d&rsquo;y do, Captain Lake? Lovely day! So sorry we&rsquo;re  late. You know Lady James Kaimes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have that pleasure,&rdquo; said the tall young soldier, saluting. &ldquo;Very sorry to hear  your husband is ill, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks!  But I daresay Jamaica will pull him round, Captain Lake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hope  it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; breathed Billy, at her elbow, as the lift soared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  you horrid little boy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll  be a chance for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! You&rsquo;re too much of a general lover, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Girls  do run a man so hard, nowadays,&rdquo; observed Billy, pathetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was different in your youth, no doubt. But I am not a girl, and quite old  enough to box the ears of conceited urchins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do!&mdash;if  you&rsquo;ll let me give you a kiss for a blow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  precocious Christianity! You had better apply to that pretty American girl near  the Casino door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Mamie Mulrady? Oh, I can get her kisses without fightin&rsquo;. Not bad-lookin&rsquo;, is  she? Lots of tin, an&rsquo; as spry as they make &lsquo;em. There&rsquo;s th&rsquo; little mother an&rsquo;  that rotter chippin&rsquo; into th&rsquo; Casino. Shall we follow, Lady Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were stopped on the steps by Miss Mulrady, who knew both, and claimed  acquaintance through a wholly unnecessary lorgnette. She was a vivacious Wild  West product, who exaggerated the vernacular, because Europeans expected to  find the Californian girl of fiction in real life. Her exaggerated slang was  assumed out of sheer amusement, and she greatly enjoyed the amazed looks of  those who heard her talk good Anglo-Saxon, which she did, when she escaped from  fools to forgather with wise men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you, Miss Mulrady?&rdquo; asked Billy solemnly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keepin&rsquo;  afloat, I guess, but that&rsquo;s about all. The dollars I&rsquo;ve lost buckin&rsquo; the tiger  would have bought me a dozen husbands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foreign  ones are cheap, I believe,&rdquo; said Leah, admiring the prairie-flower&rsquo;s Paris  frock more than her republican manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make me smile. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to run tandem with Sir Billy here&mdash;me first and he the  wheeler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  go,&rdquo; said the boy, quite able to hold his own. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to marry a Bret  Harte girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do,&rdquo; replied Miss Mulrady, in the purest of English, and placing two small  gloved hands together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a wife and a mother in one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  economy!&rdquo; smiled Lady Jim. &ldquo;Are you coming into the &lsquo;devil&rsquo;s parlour&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later.  I&rsquo;m waiting for Mr. Askew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  started. She thought that Askew was safe in Shropshire, making attempts to  civilise the fixture. &ldquo;Harry Askew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so,&rdquo; assented Miss Mulrady, relapsing into her Wild West vocabulary, and with a  keen look. &ldquo;He called on Mommo an&rsquo; me, when he was cruisin&rsquo; out &lsquo;Frisco way. We&rsquo;re  negotiatin&rsquo; a system to break this old bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  evidently wish to be popularised in a song,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, languidly. &ldquo;How  long has Mr. Askew been devoting his energies to such things?&rdquo; This with an  angry reflection that he had not called on her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might reckon it twenty-four hours,&rdquo; said the American, admiring her pointed  brown shoe. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s here for his health.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard that excuse before, with regard to Monte Carlo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t  wonder. We ticket our sins best sugar. Sir Billy, come along an&rsquo; buy me candy  at the stores.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your man, Miss Mulrady&mdash;the Askew chap?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Jim an&rsquo; I &lsquo;ull swap humans. What say?&rdquo; and she looked at Leah, mischievously  overdoing the slang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never swap what isn&rsquo;t my own property,&rdquo; answered Lady Jim, considering this  offer too Western, and resenting the familiarity to the extent of walking into  the Casino with her head very much in the air. America could hold her own with  the mother-country, and Leah did not approve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  wants to be the whole show an&rsquo; the box-office,&rdquo; murmured Mamie, mischievously. &ldquo;Stay  here, Bub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry to refuse a lady,&rdquo; replied Billy, resenting the word; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve put my  money on Lady Jim, this trip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the red&mdash;hair, you mean. Go bye-bye with your nurse, then. Here&rsquo;s Mr. Askew, he&rsquo;s  older than you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  easier to please,&rdquo; snapped the youth, much offended. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, Miss  Mulrady, but a man can&rsquo;t keep a woman waitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  retired into what Lady Jim called the &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s parlour&rdquo; with a Floreat Etona  air, and Miss Mulrady, after a glance at the ears which she longed to box  soundly, turned to receive a breathless apology from the belated Askew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a friend of yours gone in to sin for an hour,&rdquo; said she, when a treaty was  concluded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have so many friends&mdash;so-called.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  the high-toned gilt-edged sort, with red scalps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  comprehended in a second. &ldquo;Lady Jim,&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;yes, I heard that she was  at San Remo. What&rsquo;s she doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Visitin&rsquo;  the sick an&rsquo; the poor,&rdquo; said Mamie, shrewdly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what folks come to Monte  for. Guess, she best drop in on you&mdash;a sicker man I never saw, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be  poor enough by th&rsquo; time we&rsquo;re through with this old system of yours. I know a  bank where th&rsquo; wild time goes. You may look all through Bacon without findin&rsquo;  that remark&mdash;it&rsquo;s my own. Let&rsquo;s get.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus,  with barbaric japes, did the child of nature lead her companion into the gilded  halls of iniquity, and the two jostled the well-dressed crowd which circulated  round the tables. The silence was that of an arctic night, save for the droning  voices of the croupiers, and at times a hurried whisper of joy or dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo;  in for rouge et noir with Lady Jim?&rdquo; asked Miss Mulrady, alluding to the hair  of Askew and his friend; &ldquo;or perhaps she&rsquo;s sportin&rsquo; on trente et quarante, to  suit her years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  under thirty,&rdquo; growled Askew, crossly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  you&rsquo;re under the weather, considerable,&rdquo; retorted the American, sharply. &ldquo;Get  up steam an&rsquo; fizzle a bit, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I war-whoop, or dance a horn-pipe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  I prefer originality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try  the system, then&rdquo;; and Askew pushed his way through the Mammon-worshippers to  where the roulette ball wheeled its fatal round.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim did not play. She had stupidly forgotten her peacock&rsquo;s feather and could  not risk loss with her small capital. But Billy, having the audacity and luck  of innocence, was at hand, so she gave him five hundred francs to experiment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  halve the winnings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  take money from a woman,&rdquo; said Billy, gravely; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mind a fly. Got any  sportin&rsquo; number?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirteen,  because that&rsquo;s your age. There is Mademoiselle Aksakoff, I wish to speak to her&rdquo;;  and she moved gracefully towards the tall, pale girl, while Young Iniquity,  with the air of a Vanderbilt, planked her money on the odd number.</p>
  <p>Katinka  Aksakoff grew crimson when Lady Jim saluted her, and would have evaded the  meeting if possible. She might have been a nun from the looks of her, and was  garbed in unrelieved black, which Leah concluded was mourning for unrequited  affection. After that fleeting wave of colour, her thin, oval face grew marble  white, and a pair of dark questioning eyes appeared twice as large and three  times as brilliant as they had been before resting on Lady Jim&rsquo;s gracious  smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  glad to meet you,&rdquo; murmured Leah, as they shook hands in the air. &ldquo;Lady  Richardson and I have come to tea. Where is your father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is talking with the German ambassador,&rdquo; replied Katinka, without a smile, and  with Siberian coldness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  fortunate. We can chat without interruption.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  scarcely think we have much to chat about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes,&rdquo; rejoined Lady Jim, with perfect good-humour. &ldquo;When you learn how you  misjudge me, we shall get on capitally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon.  I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  not, since I have yet to make my explanation. Let us walk on the terrace, and  you can throw me over, to where they shoot the pigeons, if my conversation  displeases you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but it is so strange!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so necessary&mdash;to your peace of mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Mademoiselle Aksakoff&rsquo;s face grew scarlet once more, and she pressed her hand  to her heart, as though she felt there a cruel pain. Perhaps she did, poor  soul! But the stoicism of the Slav enabled her to summon up a wry smile, and to  bow her head, as she followed her brilliant rival. With the excess of an  ill-governed, passionate heart did she hate this woman; but as a Niobe, frozen  and cold, did she appear when they were pacing the terrace. And not one single  word of her companion&rsquo;s sugared speech was she prepared to believe.</p>
  <p>Leah&rsquo;s  eyes rested appreciatively on the varied beauty of God&rsquo;s work and man&rsquo;s  improvements. The huddled white houses of Monaco crowned its giant rock, which  bulked hugely against the blended azure of sea and sky. The placid waters  ringed its base with foam, and stretched with sparks and dashes of fire towards  an immeasurable horizon. Landward bunched the red roofs of the town, below arid  and precipitous heights, soaring massively into the radiant and ever-deepening  blue. A balmy wind, like some invisible alchemist, changed the sombre green of  the olive-groves to patches of glittering silver. Near at hand spread the  lustrous foliage of lemon and orange trees, nor was wanting the almond blossom  of the far east. They walked under palms suggestive of Bedouin life, and, to  the well-read, of Heine&rsquo;s sad little song, immortal and heart-rendingly true.  Roses and violets, and flowers of many shapes and hues, bordered the terrace;  the wide sea laughed at their feet, and behind them rose the palatial structure  of the Casino, gorgeous as the Golden House of Nero. It was Fairyland, and Lady  Jim said so to her sad companion, who was too blinded by love to see beauty  anywhere when the beloved was absent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can talk in French, if you like,&rdquo; said Leah, after she had paid her tribute to  nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  English, I think,&rdquo; replied the Russian girl; &ldquo;my father wishes me to speak only  your tongue, while we remain in London, so that I may improve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Leah, genuinely complimentary. &ldquo;Your accent is much better  than a born English person; also your grammar, and your choice of words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  take the trouble to learn your language, whereas you English do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  too busy annexing the world to bother about philological lessons,&rdquo; said Lady  Jim, remembering Heine&rsquo;s remark anent the Romans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo;  assented Katinka, with a chilling smile; &ldquo;but, interesting as this conversation  is, I do not see its necessity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur  Demetrius,&rdquo; began Leah, abruptly, when Mademoiselle raised a protesting hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  need not speak of him, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? He is a mutual friend. I know you fancy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fancy nothing,&rdquo; interrupted the other, haughtily. &ldquo;Words are not needed where  he is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  explanations are. You think that I love Demetrius!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Katinka  flushed painfully, and she put her hand suddenly to her throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  forbid you to speak,&rdquo; she said, in a stifled voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  We are not in Russia, where people kneel down and say please. Besides, it is  necessary for your peace of mind that you should hear what I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  made that remark before, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  and I make it again, to emphasise my meaning, though I hate repetition.  Demetrius loves you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! It is you who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pish!  His heart is yours; his science mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  science!&rdquo; Mademoiselle Aksakoff looked surprised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  else do you think attracted me? I am an English cat, and I have no lovers. Do  you remember La Fontaine&rsquo;s fable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  James, be plain with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am trying to be. You think that I love Demetrius, and that he is devoted to me.  It is not so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Katinka  winced. She did not like such plain speaking, and, moreover, doubted its truth.  &ldquo;If I could think so, I would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you can think so,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, amiably. &ldquo;Demetrius is particularly  clever in curing consumptive diseases. For that reason I conversed with him a  great deal. My husband is very ill, and I wanted the doctor to cure him. If  Demetrius thought that my liking for his society meant anything else, he is an  egotist. My advice is, that you should procure his pardon and marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are obstacles in the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not one, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you speaking honestly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am!&rdquo; and the eyes of the two women met. Katinka searched the hard blue orbs of  the great lady with painful intensity, and Leah bore the scrutiny with the  knowledge that her conduct had been, and always would be, perfectly correct.  Had she been the least in love with the doctor, she would not have dared to  submit to that probing, painful gaze. Women may deceive mere men; they cannot  deceive one another, especially in affairs of the heart. When Katinka withdrew  her eyes she was satisfied that Lady Jim cared nothing for Demetrius. Without  explanation, she burst into rapid and wrathful speech, and Leah&rsquo;s feminine  perspicacity enabled her to guess the unuttered preamble, which a man would  have required to be put into words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  then do you lure him to your feet?&rdquo; cried the Russian girl, in a sharp, pained  voice. &ldquo;If you love him not, why torture him, and me? I know he loves you&mdash;I  know&mdash;I know&mdash;oh yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not. His love for me&mdash;if it can be called so&mdash;is the mere passing fancy of a  man for a woman who has been kind to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  kind,&rdquo; muttered Katinka, vengefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. But men are so conceited that they think a woman&rsquo;s smile means a woman&rsquo;s  love. You have a golden heart, yet you throw it into the greedy hands of this  selfish egotist&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not that,&rdquo; gasped the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he is, and much worse. Demetrius possesses the selfishness of a woman and the  vanity of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  reverse the proper order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t. Men are far vainer than women, and women more selfish than men. I&rsquo;m  selfish myself, therefore I am happy. You are one of those self-tormenting,  self-denying angels, who make men what they are&mdash;vain, greedy, conceited,  lord-of-creation beasts. And I insult the beasts by such a comparison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you liked men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  use them, and I detest them,&rdquo; retorted Lady Jim, speaking more plainly than was  her custom. &ldquo;There are good men&mdash;I don&rsquo;t deny that, for I know one at least&rdquo;&mdash;she  was thinking of Lionel; &ldquo;but the majority&mdash;ugh! God help the women like  yourself, who give their hearts into the keeping of such animals!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  love your husband, surely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  all love our husbands&mdash;it&rsquo;s part of the Church Service to love them. Pah!&mdash;I am  not here to talk of my marriage, but of yours. You know now that I don&rsquo;t care  for Demetrius, and that I desired his help merely for my husband&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I have wronged you&rdquo;; and Katinka put out her hand.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim took it, rather softened. &ldquo;You poor child, how foolish you are! Why not  forget Demetrius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not worthy of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he not?&mdash;ah, you don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  smiled grimly. &ldquo;I know him much better than you do. However, if you insist upon  putting him on an imaginary pedestal, there is no more to be said. Have you  heard from him lately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mademoiselle  Aksakoff was now quite deceived, and looked upon Lady Jim as her dearest and  best friend. &ldquo;Last week I received a letter from Funchal,&rdquo; she said eagerly. &ldquo;Yes;  I wrote to him about the chances of his pardon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  there any chances?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; I assure you&mdash;yes. I have a cousin, high in favour with the Czar, who can  procure an immediate pardon. But my father does not wish me to marry Demetrius&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wise  man,&rdquo; murmured Leah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so there is some difficulty. Oh&rdquo;&mdash;she clasped her hands&mdash;&ldquo;if Constantine would  only be guided by me! He comes of a rich family, and has the title of Prince&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but did he say how he had parted from his family because of his advanced ideas?  He gave up money and rank, and all that makes life pleasant, to labour among  the poor peasants. Is that not noble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  noble that I have difficulty in thinking M. Demetrius acted so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he did&mdash;he did. And my father is angered because of this self-sacrifice. If  Constantine would only return to the rank of life in which he was born, my  father would permit me to marry him, and then the pardon would speedily be  procured. But I plead in vain,&rdquo; she murmured, with hanging head &ldquo;he will not  listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may, when he returns,&rdquo; volunteered Lady Jim, kindly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  when will that be? If he goes to Jamaica&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  turned suddenly white. &ldquo;Why to Jamaica?&rdquo; she asked sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wrote that the Duke of Pentland had asked him to go there, to see after your  husband. And you say that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; but this patient Garth, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Katinka  looked surprised. &ldquo;But have you not heard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heard?  I have heard nothing. I do not correspond with M. Demetrius, my dear. It is now  April, and he has been at Funchal since January, trying to heal that poor man.  Has he&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Mademoiselle Aksakoff, quickly. &ldquo;The man is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garth  dead?&rdquo; Lady Jim sat down, with a gasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  so Demetrius wrote last week, and said he would go on to Jamaica at the Duke&rsquo;s  request to see your husband. But you look quite ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hate to hear of deaths,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, viciously. She certainly spoke truly  with regard to this particular death. In her mind lurked a dread lest Demetrius  had assisted nature, after all.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_15"></a>Chapter 15</b> </h2>
  <p>Monsieur  Aksakoff owned a toy villa, pleasantly placed amongst orange-groves and  lemon-gardens, on the outskirts of Fools&rsquo; Paradise. Hither, somewhere about the  hour of five, trooped a gay party, of which Katinka was not the least merry. So  unaccountable were her spirits, that the majority judged her to be what the  Scotch aptly call &ldquo;fey.&rdquo; Lady Jim, in the minority, knew better. A recollection  of the recent interview explained the girl&rsquo;s dancing on a possible grave.</p>
  <p>Leah  had subjugated one of her own suspicious sex. This is a rare miracle; rarer  still, it had been achieved by truth-telling. Certainly, with inevitable female  reservation, Lady Jim had not told the whole truth and nothing but the truth;  but then, her knowledge did not include the shibboleth of oath-taking. She did  not love Demetrius&mdash;no avowal could have been more honest. Still, his medical  acquirements had scarcely induced the flirtation which Katinka resented, and in  saying so she swerved from the path of rectitude. Nevertheless, that ingenuous  explanation of the illegal apron-string deceived Mademoiselle Aksakoff into  believing that Truth had really been dragged, unclothed and impeccable, from  her well.</p>
  <p>The  result may be guessed. From cold hostility, Katinka, ignorant of the golden  mean, melted into warm friendship: the sadness of unrequited love was replaced  by the allurements of hope, and the hitherto dreary unpeopled world became an  Arcadia of magical beauty, through which there ever moved a possible  bridegroom. The colour returned to her wan cheeks, the light to her dark eyes,  and in place of a listless nun the astonished father beheld a dancing, laughing  nymph. Clever as Aksakoff was, he failed to understand the why and the  wherefore of this transformation. Being a diplomatist, he searched for the  magician who had accomplished its wonders; being mere man, he naturally espied  the obvious. The unexpected presence of Demetrius, as he concluded, was  responsible for the breathing of life into this statue.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim guessed his explanation, and was amused by his inquiring looks. She  promised herself the pleasure of making things clear, in such a way as would  compel confidences on his part. These might be useful in averting the wrath of  Demetrius, when he came to know that his reward was withheld. And Leah was not  unreasonable in anticipating trouble of the worst, seeing that the doctor had  already loaded her with a portion of a debt which she did not intend to pay.  Garth was dead. That part of the task had been accomplished. Now, Katinka  informed her that Demetrius was bound for Jamaica. There he would arrange for  the obliteration of Jim, and return with a substituted corpse to console the  afflicted widow. The widow herself shivered at the prospect of being honest and  tangibly grateful; and, since the possible was rapidly becoming the probable,  began to consider means of evasion. But it was no easy matter to nullify the  bond of a semi-oriental Shylock.</p>
  <p>With  a diplomatist, superadded to a father, for an ally, and with tricky Muscovite  politics to play with, Lady Jim fancied that her end might be obtained. But,  although she knew the goal, she could not see the most direct and least  dangerous way to gain it. Her path was perplexing and perilous, so it was  necessary to find a finger-post. She thought that Aksakoff might stand for  such, since he would do much to neutralise the chance of his daughter&rsquo;s  marriage with Demetrius. But to enlist him on her side, and in her schemes,  required a private conference, and plainer speaking than Lady Jim approved of.  However, as there was no opportunity of private speech for at least one hour,  she had time to construct feasible plans.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  her silence over the teacups was remarkable in so lively a lady. Certainly,  Garth might have died in the orthodox manner, as ample time had been given for  his exit. On the other hand, Demetrius, eager for his reward, might have&mdash;but  no; she could not bear to think of such a horror, and employed her will to deny  the possibility. Nevertheless, strive as she would to banish the thought, it  returned again and again, insistent and terrifying. No wonder Askew was moved  to ask if she felt unwell, and no wonder she protested, with unnecessary  emphasis, that she never felt better in her life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am gathering instruction from the conversation of others,&rdquo; she assured him,  when he urged smelling-salts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you are so extraordinarily pale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have parted with my colour to Mademoiselle Aksakoff. See, she blooms like an  artificial rose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  artificial? Her bloom is natural.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  her spirits are forced. A hothouse is Nature&rsquo;s corset.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said Askew, bluntly; &ldquo;you are a puzzle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  is as much as to say that I am a woman. I wish you would cease personalities  and refill my glass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  sounded more bacchanalian than it was, for the glass contained nothing more  destructive to the nerves than straw-coloured tea, prepared, milkless, in the  Russian manner, with plenty of sugar and a squeeze of lemon. Katinka presided  over a samovar, and dispensed caviare sandwiches, so that the meal was entirely  Muscovite. Aksakoff, stiff and pale and lean, precisely dressed and watchful as  a cat, paid diplomatic compliments to Lady Richardson, while Captain Lake  laughed with Katinka. Miss Mulrady had annexed a flattering vicomte who wanted  money in exchange for a name which dated from the Crusades, and Askew hovered,  like the silly moth he was, round Lady Jim&rsquo;s superfine wax candle. This  possible tragedy of singed wings doubly and trebly assured Katinka of Leah&rsquo;s  honesty, for who could love the demi-god Demetrius and trifle with a nautical  butterfly? Thus did she argue, crediting her once rival and now ally with the  infatuation which, in Fairyland, made Titania clip Bottom in her arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  air of this place suits you,&rdquo; said Lake, wondering at this bubbling gaiety; &ldquo;you  were pale and sad when we last met, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may be the same when we meet again,&rdquo; she replied, refilling Lady Jim&rsquo;s glass. &ldquo;What  would you? Moods are agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!  I don&rsquo;t choose April as the most enjoyable month of the year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Katinka  laughed meaningly, and glanced slyly at Lady Richardson. &ldquo;I see; you prefer an  autumn month&mdash;highly coloured and mature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was too symbolic for Lake, but some intuition of its meaning caused him to  flush to the roots of his fair hair, and verbally deny comprehension. &ldquo;I do not  understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  gallant man would,&rdquo; she retorted, and, further enlightened, the captain&rsquo;s pink  became a violent crimson, to the concern of its cause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  red you are, Reggy!&rdquo; cried Lady Richardson. &ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t scarlet fever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess you suffer from that,&rdquo; murmured Mamie, posing her lorgnette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pla&icirc;t-il?&rdquo;  inquired the bewildered vicomte; but received no reply. Miss Mulrady&rsquo;s  knowledge of French was too limited to permit of pathological discussions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Russian  tea,&rdquo; explained Lake, cooling to his ordinary sun-burn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not one word&mdash;indigestion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indigestion,&rdquo;  repeated the soldier, with dry obedience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should really try Billy&rsquo;s new medicine; it has made him very fit. By the way,  where is my darling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lake  dodged the quizzical glance of Miss Mulrady, and explained that Sir Billy had  been last seen wrinkling his young brows over the intricacies of trente et  quarante. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t haul him off; but I daresay hunger will fetch him to the  tea-table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  devotion argues good luck,&rdquo; said Leah, wondering if Billy would arrive with  full pockets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  Lady James. Most boys are lucky at play.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  therefore unlucky in love?&rdquo; inquired Katinka, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Children  should know nothing of such things,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, stiffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess not,&rdquo; cried Mamie; &ldquo;but Sir Billy is a freak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really,  Miss Mulrady,&rdquo; frowned the indignant little mother, &ldquo;my son is not so eligible  for Barnum&rsquo;s Show as you seem to imagine. He hasn&rsquo;t got two heads, or an  elastic skin, or any of those things which seem to be so popular in the United  States.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  make him more interestin&rsquo; if he had. He&rsquo;s a moral freak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Et  moi aussi?&rdquo; asked the vicomte, whose scant knowledge of Americanese prevented  entire understanding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you haven&rsquo;t got morals of any sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M.  de Marville is the more interesting on that account,&rdquo; said Leah, rousing  herself from a two minutes&rsquo; silence; &ldquo;a really good young man should be sealed,  as a bore, in a glass case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why is Mr. Askew at large?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sailor laughed. &ldquo;I fear my past can best answer that question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  your tongue? Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  leave that well alone,&rdquo; laughed Katinka, gaily. &ldquo;Besides, only women have  pasts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  presents, when the men are generous,&rdquo; said Lady Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess men are always generous, when there&rsquo;s anythin&rsquo; to be got.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  meals, there is nothing to be got, save smoking,&rdquo; said the hostess; &ldquo;you  gentlemen have leave. Captain Lake, will you give me a cigarette?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like  many Russian ladies, Mademoiselle Aksakoff adored those fatal rolls of tobacco  wrapped in coffee-coloured paper, and consumed a great quantity. Lady  Richardson, unlike the average Englishwoman, smoked likewise&mdash;that is, she  fiddled qualmishly with half a cigarette, because it looked smart to do what  you shouldn&rsquo;t. The gentlemen also offered incense to the very modern goddess  Nicotine, and shortly Lady Jim was the only person present not committed to  this agreeable vice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am behind the times,&rdquo; she confessed; &ldquo;but please don&rsquo;t look upon me as a prude  on the prowl. I willingly permit other women to spoil their teeth and ruin  their digestions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a nasty speech!&rdquo; cried Lady Richardson, offended, especially as Leah knew it  was an effort for her to sin in this way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, it is; but then, I feel nasty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  look charming,&rdquo; whispered Askew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder how many times a day you repeat yourself,&rdquo; she replied impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  often as I recall your face. I can think then of only one adjective, charming,  and one noun, angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  limitations! And the necessary verb?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First  person singular, as usual, after the manner of the male egotist. Isn&rsquo;t this  rather Lindley-Murray whispering?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  it was, they had no opportunity of continuing it, for Lady Richardson drew Leah&rsquo;s  attention to the fact that she had lost a fortune in the Casino. &ldquo;I depend upon  you, dear, for my return fare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Billy  will pay,&rdquo; conjectured Lady Jim, calmly: &ldquo;I quite expect he has broken the  bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  on Mr. Askew&rsquo;s system,&rdquo; cried Mamie; &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t run an apple-stall on his  lines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would suggest improvements,&rdquo; complained Askew, reproachfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you admit that they were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  fitted properly into the puzzle, and at the proper time. But it&rsquo;s a mistake to  swap horses when crossing a stream.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;  said Miss Mulrady, in her best Californian style. &ldquo;I guess the animals belonged  to you. I lost no dollars&rdquo;; and with a comfortable sense of her own &lsquo;cuteness,  she accepted a cigarette from the attentive vicomte.</p>
  <p>This  frothy chatter irritated a lady who was inwardly grappling with problems of the  near future. Askew ventured on more spindrift, only to be snubbed into seeking  the complaisant society of Mamie. This necessitated a game of general post, for  Katinka slipped in rapid French and boulevard gossip with de Marville, while  Lady Richardson drew Lake once more to her elderly feet. Remained the  diplomatist, in splendid isolation, and his gaze wandered to Lady Jim, who  stared straight before her. She was looking into the next world, where a  reproachful ghost, something resembling Jim, was asking why he had been  butchered to make a woman&rsquo;s holiday. And the living, half believing the  terrible truth implied, gave shuffling answer to the dead: &ldquo;Demetrius is to  blame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  vivid was the vision, so powerful the thought, so guilty the conscience, that  her tongue actually framed this much aloud, before she became aware that her  secret was slipping out. A hasty glance around assured her that none of the  prattlers had overheard; but an echo of the name at her elbow testified to  Monsieur Aksakoff&rsquo;s excellent hearing. Lady Jim grew chill. What had she said?  How much had he gathered? Instinctively facing a possible danger, she did not  even turn her head or raise her voice, but, almost in the same breath,  concluded the sentence differently: &ldquo;&mdash;if he does not cure Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  husband?&rdquo; asked the diplomatist, politely.</p>
  <p>With  admirable skill Leah started, as though her reflections had been unexpectedly  interrupted. &ldquo;You there, M. Aksakoff? I was thinking of my husband&mdash;yes. He is  trying to get well in Jamaica, and M. Demetrius has gone to pull him round. I  shall certainly blame him if he does not cure Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is severe, madame. After all, no human being holds the keys of life and death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Self-controlled  as she was, Lady Jim shuddered. Demetrius certainly held the key of death, and  had used it&mdash;for so she began to believe&mdash;in opening for Garth a door into the  unknown. However, she utilised the shudder very dexterously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like  that. It makes me fear lest Jim should never get well. But after all, M. Demetrius  is extraordinarily clever. I told your daughter, only this afternoon, how I had  been attracted to him for Jim&rsquo;s sake, and by his knowledge of consumption.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Aksakoff looked at her with his pale eyes, and very inquiringly. It had not  occurred to him that the lady was a model wife. &ldquo;The medical attainments of M.  Demetrius attracted you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally!  My husband is ill. I wish him to be cured. M. Demetrius has a European  reputation for cure of consumption. We have held many conversations on the  subject, and I feel certain that there is a chance for poor dear Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  M. Demetrius becomes his medical attendant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is,&rdquo; Leah assured him. &ldquo;The poor creature he was looking after in Madeira, on  behalf of the Duke, is dead, and Katinka informed me that M. Demetrius had  sailed for Jamaica.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  frowned. &ldquo;How does my daughter know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim rose to shrug her shoulders, and to seize the opportunity thus offered to  solve her problem by means of a private conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  charming place you have here,&rdquo; she said, glancing round, and giving him to  understand that the shrug was his answer; &ldquo;the air is so balmy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will find it more so without tobacco smoke,&rdquo; said the Russian, throwing away  his cigarette, and, without knowing it, was thus skilfully entrapped into a  duologue by an ostensibly reluctant woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so comfortable here,&rdquo; urged Leah, with feigned hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  pleased, madame; but your sense of the picturesque will make you sacrifice ease  for a particularly charming view of the Estrelles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  proper study of womankind is man,&rdquo; misquoted Lady Jim, accepting the  invitation; &ldquo;but nature comes as a relief at times. We see so little of her in  society,&rdquo; and she glanced at Lady Richardson&rsquo;s dyed hair and tinted cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are severe, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall begin to believe so, if you repeat that a third time,&rdquo; she replied,  smiling, and glancing sideways at his face. This she did to discover, if  possible, his intentions. It suddenly occurred to her, that the diplomatist&rsquo;s  insistence meant intrigue on his part. He, like herself, was playing a game,  and Lady Jim, for the sake of the result, wished to overlook his hand. Had she  seen it, which she did not, the knowledge that people knew more about her  domestic affairs than she would have approved of might have shocked her.</p>
  <p>Ivan  Aksakoff was not a tricky Russian, nor a diplomatist of repute, for nothing.  Instructions had reached him several times from headquarters that Demetrius was  to be watched while in England, and, if possible, decoyed into the territory of  a less scrupulous nation, for the purpose of arrest. A drugged official&rsquo;s  feelings had been outraged, a much-wanted Anarchist had escaped through the  connivance of the exile, and a paternal government thought that an enforced  trip to Siberia might cool misplaced friendships for suspected persons. Several  times Aksakoff had tried to induce the Demetrius opossum to climb down from his  tree of refuge, but the suspicious beast refused to oblige him. Therefore, all  that the diplomatist could do was to keep himself advised of the doctor&rsquo;s  doings, in the hope of luring him to destruction when he was off his guard. He  had biblical precedent for this hope. Shimei, the son of Gera, lulled by long  security, had crossed the forbidden brook Kidron, so why should not Demetrius,  likewise forgetful, cross the Channel?</p>
  <p>Stealthy  inquiry into the doctor&rsquo;s affairs had led Aksakoff to ask himself, why the man  dangled at Lady Jim&rsquo;s apron-strings. Reports poured in, fast and thick, that  the Curzon Street household was insolvent, but these did not help the  diplomatist overmuch. If Lady Jim wanted money, she would scarcely ask a  penniless exile for the cash he did not possess. The man was not sufficiently  handsome, nor so superlatively fascinating, that he should gain the love of the  most beautiful woman in London. And, incidentally, Aksakoff learned that Lady  Jim was a modern Lucrece, although she did not profess an ardent love for her  lord and master. Therefore, as neither Mammon nor Cupid could explain a  friendship which was pretty freely discussed in clubs and drawing-rooms,  Aksakoff could not comprehend this particular wile of woman.</p>
  <p>In  his endeavour to fathom the meaning, he even went so far as to question his  daughter, knowing that she was as infatuated with Demetrius as Demetrius was  with Lady Kaimes. But Katinka either could not or would not explain, and for  months the diplomatist had been exasperated by the sight of a genuinely  platonic friendship, for which there seemed to be no reason. Now he learned  from one of the parties to the bond that a husband&rsquo;s sickness, and a friend&rsquo;s  skill, were the elements which composed the intimacy. Such a case, in such a  light, had never before been presented to him, and while sauntering by Lady Jim&rsquo;s  side to view the Estrelles against the sunset, he was trying to think if the  explanation was genuine. To his acute hearing, it did not sound even plausible.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless&mdash;and  this was Aksakoff&rsquo;s reason for seeking the interview&mdash;some use might be made of  the woman to entrap the man. Lady Jim was badly in need of ready money, and the  Russian Government had, at the time, full coffers. Since there was no love in  the question, this singular lady might, for a round sum, dispense with the  doctor&rsquo;s attendance on her husband. More&mdash;if delicately handled, she might  induce Demetrius to show her the sights of Paris. It was difficult to hint this  without shocking the feelings of a great lady and a spotless woman. Still, if  skilfully done, and without too much emphasis, Lady Jim might gather that her  finances could be put in order without much trouble on her part.</p>
  <p>But  Aksakoff had another argument which induced him to risk a scene with outraged  virtue. He loved his daughter, and wished her to marry a highly placed cousin,  who would be of political use to his father-in-law. Unfortunately, Katinka was  infatuated&mdash;Aksakoff could find no more appropriate word&mdash;with Demetrius.  Marriage with a person wanted by the powerful of St. Petersburg meant a check  to the diplomatist and a handle to his many enemies. The match was not to be  thought of. Yet, if Demetrius would only prove kind, Mademoiselle Aksakoff  would assuredly become his wife, even if she had to achieve the marriage by  elopement. Also, Katinka might be able to procure the man&rsquo;s pardon, and of this  Aksakoff entirely disapproved. Even if the doctor was whitewashed, he had such  socialistic or anarchistic feelings&mdash;it mattered not which&mdash;that he would never  consent to resume his title or the large income attached to such resumption. On  the whole, both from a fatherly and a domestic point of view, Aksakoff felt  that this marplot would be safer in a Siberian mine. How to get him there was  the problem.</p>
  <p>The  solution might come through Lady Jim. If he could only ascertain her feelings  towards Demetrius, and hint that such a lovely woman should not be worried by  sordid money affairs, it was not improbable that such a satisfactory result  would be arrived at. It was a forlorn hope, but Aksakoff dared it; it was a  straw, but he grasped at it&mdash;and now, fully committed to the speculation, he was  casting about in his mind as to a promising beginning. No easy task, for  Aksakoff&rsquo;s spies and Aksakoff&rsquo;s experience assured him that Lady James Kaimes  was a prickly plant, needing care in the handling.</p>
  <p>So  it will be seen that Leah&rsquo;s intuition had not deceived her, scanty as was the  ground for suspicion. The closer she examined his face by swift side-glances,  the more certain she became that he was playing a game, and&mdash;from her experience  of diplomatists&mdash;by no means for love. To vary the metaphor, she and the Russian  were about to engage in a duel, either with foils or swords. Lady Jim did not  care which. She was perfectly assured that, however dexterous her antagonist  might be, she could fence quite as well, if not better. And thus she marched to  the duelling ground, already a victor.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter 16</b> </h2>
  <p>Silhouetted  against a pale purple sky, the dark masses of the Estrelles floated on a  shimmering sea. Nearer and clearer, yet less sharply defined, etherealised by  amethystine hues, and indistinct through the haze of gloaming, frowned the  Grimaldi stronghold, its mouldering walls, clasping closely packed houses,  dominated by a lean and soaring campanile. Over the cactus hedge, and between  bending palms, could be caught a glimpse of the trim, unromantic modern town,  of the sleepy waters of the bay, and fishing-boats rocking beside  spick-and-span toy yachts, with here and there the picturesque felucca of  Mediterranean commerce, old-fashioned, with oars and lateen sails. Only Shelley  in radiant verse could have described with any approach to truth this magical  dreamland, real yet unreal, under the changing colours of sunset.</p>
  <p>As  at the outset of an earlier and less difficult interview, Lady Jim admired the  loveliness of paradise, with ostentatious disregard of her embarrassed  companion. And embarrassed he was, to such a degree that she marvelled at his  choice of a profession in which emotions count as crimes. This judgment was  unfair, for Aksakoff ordinarily commanded his feelings with the severity of a  martinet. But so great were the stakes for which he proposed to play&mdash;his  daughter&rsquo;s future and his political advancement&mdash;that he shifted uneasily from  one foot to the other, clasped and unclasped his hands, and betrayed more of  the natural man and anxious father than was consistent with diplomatic  reticence.</p>
  <p>Having  some idea of this mental confusion, Leah waited for him to make an almost  certain mistake, of which she intended to take full advantage. She was like a  cat watching a mouse-hole, ready to pounce at an opportune moment. Meanwhile,  she held her tongue, which sufficiently assured Aksakoff of her dangerous  capability. He had never before beheld the ominous miracle of a silent woman,  and his nerves were none the better for this surprising spectacle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius,  madame,&rdquo; he finally blundered, and recognised the blunder as the words left his  mouth&mdash;&ldquo;Demetrius is your friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  attack was so weak that Lady Jim contemptuously gave him vantage-ground. &ldquo;Katinka&rsquo;s  lover also, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Czar&rsquo;s enemy,&rdquo; retorted Aksakoff angrily. &ldquo;Let us have all his  qualifications at once, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  all means. Enemy, friend, lover. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very far from well, as you know, madame. I desire no Siberian felon for my  son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew that M. Demetrius had been to Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will go there yet&mdash;to his grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an odd choice of a cemetery!&rdquo; said Leah, shrugging; &ldquo;but I assure you, M.  Aksakoff, that I take no interest in these funeral arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  Yet report says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was about to blurt out something still more undiplomatic, but that Lady Jim&rsquo;s  pity for his ineptitude made her intervene. &ldquo;I know what it says, and of course  I deeply sympathise with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; I comprehend your feelings. It is hard that your own daughter should defy  you, especially as M. Demetrius is merely a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a prince in our country,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, furious that she should take the  lead, and at a loss how to regain it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  felon also, I understood you to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  him venture on French soil, and I shall certainly make him one,&rdquo; snarled  Aksakoff, with unpleasantly glittering eyes. Lady Jim had scratched him rather  dexterously, and the Tartar stood revealed.</p>
  <p>She  scratched again. &ldquo;Even if Katinka makes him your son-in-law?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  shall never be!&rdquo; He hesitated, then attempted a bear-hug. &ldquo;I will speak  plainly, madame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  Katinka and her infatuation? Oh, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  bit his lip. Used as he was to verbal fencing, Leah&rsquo;s handling of her tongue  baffled him. He took refuge in truth-telling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius  does not love my daughter,&rdquo; he said bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  fortunate for you, and disagreeable for her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  loves an&mdash;an&mdash;an actress,&rdquo; explained Aksakoff, wondering if her interest in the  man deepened to jealousy.</p>
  <p>Apparently  it did not. &ldquo;That would interest Katinka more than it does me,&rdquo; she assured  him; then, affecting the innocence of ignorance, &ldquo;May I ask why you chronicle  small beer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius  is your intimate friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  husband&rsquo;s medical attendant,&rdquo; she corrected quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you remove him to that distance, I confess to an indiscretion. Shall we return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  admiring the Estrelles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,  the excuse was obvious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;For the clearing up of misunderstandings. You are  anxious&mdash;so you say&mdash;that Demetrius should cure your husband. My reason for this  conversation is, to apologise for my intention to rob you of his very valuable  services. If I can trap Demetrius&mdash;say in Paris&mdash;Lord James must content himself  with an inferior doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  looked pensive and puzzled. &ldquo;I comprehend; but why should you make use of the  wrong word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Misunderstanding?&rdquo;  Then, when she nodded, &ldquo;My ignorance of your language&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  of my feelings? By this talk of Parisian traps and Siberian punishment, you  assume that I am acquainted with the private affairs of M. Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is possible that I have made that mistake,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  a diplomatist you should never confess as much. It might be that I may take  advantage of your&mdash;mistake, to inform M. Demetrius of his danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  foresaw that possibility, madame. As a dutiful wife, you naturally wish to keep  so clever a doctor in attendance on your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course; but a trip to Siberia would not improve Jim&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need for the mountain to go to Mahomet, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me if in this case I think otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  shrugged again. &ldquo;I admit the reason, seeing that this particular mountain is  married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  parables are a trifle wearisome, M. Aksakoff. The air is chilly, and I wish to  return to Lady Richardson. Would you mind telling me plainly, before we part,  why you sought this interview?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,  madame. My daughter loves this man, who does not love her, and who, by reason  of his crime and opinions, is not an eligible husband. You were with Katinka  this afternoon, as you informed me, and she is now so cheerful that I suspect  you must have delivered some message from Demetrius to so raise her spirits. Or  it might be&rdquo;&mdash;he looked squarely at her, as he added, &ldquo;that Demetrius is in  Monte Carlo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  your daughter had a letter from him, in which he stated that he was leaving  Madeira for Jamaica. Go on, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Katinka  had a letter?&rdquo; said Aksakoff, with an unpleasant look. &ldquo;That, no doubt,  accounts for her spirits. Were you Cupid&rsquo;s messenger, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim smothered a laugh. &ldquo;No; though I admit that I should like to see her happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  will never be happy with a man who does not love her. Demetrius will not come  near me, and I cannot explain. Will you oblige me by taking a message?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the sake of retaining him as Lord James&rsquo;s medical attendant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  nodded. &ldquo;As a wife, I will take your message. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  Demetrius that if he will give Katinka to understand that he will never marry  her my gratitude will be stronger than my duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  other words, you will not arrest him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  long as he remains in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  he can&rsquo;t be arrested,&rdquo; laughed Lady Jim. &ldquo;Well, your message shall be duly  delivered. And I may as well confess, since we are committed to plain speaking,  that M. Demetrius informed me why he had to leave Russia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  confidence will render it easier for you to make a treaty between us, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly.  But you will understand that I assume the r&ocirc;le of peacemaker solely on my  husband&rsquo;s account.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo;  Aksakoff bent and raised her hand to kiss it; &ldquo;as a wife you are far above  rubies. Shall we return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  consented without moving. She had not yet solved her problem. &ldquo;One moment. You  will give me your word that M. Demetrius will not be lured to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  give you my word, if the treaty is made, and Katinka is disabused of her  infatuation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  forms part of the treaty,&rdquo; said Leah, lightly. &ldquo;In the interests of Jim, I&rsquo;ll  do my best; but should he go to Paris&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will assuredly leave it for Siberia, which is much colder and not so amusing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I must advise him to be naturalised in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be the act of a friend, madame. And also, you might advise him to beware  of this actress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can&rsquo;t intrude my advice into his strictly private affairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you wish your husband to be cured, it will be as well to do so,&rdquo; Aksakoff  recommended. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Ninette is not to be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ninette?  I have seen her&mdash;a very charming artiste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  unscrupulous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so much so, I hope, as to betray the man she loves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman, madam, will do much for money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  well you know the sex, monsieur!&rdquo; said Lady Jim, ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have had some experience, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  have benefited so little that you cannot manage your daughter without my  intervention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  confess it. Let me amend my statement by saying that I have had many  experiences and little experience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a more correct way of putting it,&rdquo; said Leah, gravely; &ldquo;for I assure you, M.  Aksakoff, that if a woman loves a man, she certainly will not betray him for money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  join issue, madame. The Uranian Aphrodite is not the divinity in this case, and  Aphrodite Pandemos can be bought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  classical and confusing! And the price?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  thousand pounds,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should reckon it in francs, seeing that Mademoiselle Ninette is French.  Otherwise she will not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  jingle of gold is a universal language, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  agreeable one, at all events. I wish we had more opportunity of studying it.  Well, M. Aksakoff, for Jim&rsquo;s sake, I shall see that M. Demetrius affords this  harpy no opportunity of earning the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you will pardon my mentioning the harpy&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are a man and woman of the world, M. Aksakoff: there is no need to call spades  shovels. I thank you for considering my husband. To lose the skill of M.  Demetrius might result in his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am happy to have been of service to you, madame, and of course, you can  understand my paternal feelings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly;  I shall do my best to make your daughter see reason. A woman can talk to a  woman of such things, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  she is such a woman as you, madame,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, again bending over her  hand; &ldquo;and now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  one hour to catch the train,&rdquo; remarked Leah, with a glance at the tiny watch  set in her bracelet.</p>
  <p>In  this way Leah solved her problem, and Aksakoff gained his point; yet, on the  face of it, their conversation dealt entirely with the saving of Demetrius from  a Siberian prison, and Katinka and Katinka&rsquo;s matrimonial salvation. But Lady  Jim knew that, if she could lure the doctor to Paris, she would not longer need  to fear a Sabine alliance; while the diplomatist was satisfied that, for two  thousand pounds, Demetrius would be safely transported to Siberia. Leah,  guessing this, let him think that the money tempted her, though she wondered  how he came to know that she needed cash, and was secretly angered that he  should dare to offer a bribe. But she could not confess her true reason for  wishing the exile of Demetrius without letting Aksakoff know about the plot;  therefore, of the two evils she chose the less. But she resolved to take no  Russian gold. This cynical foreigner should learn that a strictly virtuous  Englishwoman cannot be bought. It was commendable in these augurs that they did  not wink at one another.</p>
  <p>Their  reappearance at the tea-table was greeted with shrieks of joy from Lady  Richardson, whose emotions were invariably noisy. &ldquo;Leah! Leah!&rdquo; she cried,  overcome by maternal love and pride, &ldquo;Billy has won you twelve thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twelve  thousand five hundred,&rdquo; corrected Sir Billy, who was disposing of tea and cake  and sandwiches in a way which argued long abstinence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  hundred pounds,&rdquo; translated Captain Lake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you dear, clever boy!&rdquo; said Lady Jim, coming rapidly to the table to kiss her  catspaw. &ldquo;Halves, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir  Billy shook his head and tried to keep cool, for the kiss rather upset his  dignity. &ldquo;I am more than repaid,&rdquo; said he gallantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I should think,&rdquo; murmured Askew, who would have doubled the amount for a  similar attention.</p>
  <p>Mamie  overheard, and recalled a phrase she had never used before, but which suited  her impersonation of the American girl as&mdash;she is not. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put the  banana-peel under your own foot, sonny!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo; asked the mystified islander.</p>
  <p>Miss  Mulrady glanced at Lady Jim&rsquo;s back, then winked at Askew to intimate that she  had remarkably good eyesight; also, that kissing married women led to D.C.  cross-examinations; also,&mdash;but there was no end to the many meanings of that  wink. Lord Burleigh&rsquo;s head-shake, in <i>The Critic</i>, Act II., scene 1, could  not have been more eloquent.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  applausive adjectives buzzed round Billy&rsquo;s head. He fought his trente et  quarante battle o&rsquo;er again, between hasty mouthfuls, while his mother, thanking  Providence for having bestowed on her such a son, murmured ecstatic asides to  Katinka Aksakoff. It was the apotheosis of the modern child.</p>
  <p>Leah  counted her gains, placed them safely in one of those wonderful feminine  pockets unknown to man, then gave a passing thought to the virtuous Hengists.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must get back, dear,&rdquo; she warned Lady Richardson. &ldquo;Katinka, darling&rdquo;&mdash;this was  for Aksakoff&rsquo;s benefit&mdash;&ldquo;do come over and see me. We have so much to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be delighted,&rdquo; replied the girl, flushing with joy, and really was so.  The prospect of unlimited conversations on the subject of demi-gods, and their  ways with a sympathetic friend, allured her towards an hour of happiness. What  was left of Lady Jim&rsquo;s conscience smote her; she felt almost sorry for her  dupe. But, with the premeditated self-deception of people who rearrange  biblical texts for the palliation of pet sins, she reflected that a fool&rsquo;s  paradise for Katinka was better than no paradise whatsoever.</p>
  <p>Monsieur  Aksakoff said no more. He and Lady Jim understood one another perfectly, and it  was useless to add touches to a finished picture. With cordial stiffness he  sped his guests on their way through the town and the glare of the electrics  down to the station-lift Mamie and her supple vicomte shook hands midway; but  Askew and Captain Lake insisted upon seeing the ladies safely into a  comfortable compartment.</p>
  <p>Billy  was disgusted. &ldquo;One man&rsquo;s enough to run this show,&rdquo; protested Billy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk American slang,&rdquo; rebuked his mother, and pelted the men with breathless  adieux. &ldquo;Goodnight, Reggy, so very charming, our day! Mr. Askew, goodnight&mdash;so  very amusing! We&rsquo;ve had a ripping time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the mother-kettle calls my pot black,&rdquo; Billy breathed to Leah.</p>
  <p>She  paid no attention. Askew was trying to extort an invitation to San Remo, with  eloquent eyes and persuasive lips. But a recollection of his four-and-twenty  hours in the vicinity without calling, added to a resentment that he should  have experimented with his system in the unauthorised company of a much too  attractive girl, made her ignore his hints. Moreover, being an ex-sailor and  undiplomatic, he would probably prove so affectionately honest, that the  Hengists might&mdash;and if the Hengists did, then &ldquo;adieu grapes, the vintage is  over.&rdquo; Julia and her serious spouse would never understand the need of a  grass-widow for amusements of this sort. While her Ulysses wandered they  expected her to be a replica of Penelope, that dull woman who was so fond of  speeches and sewing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  to Curzon Street in a fortnight,&rdquo; she advised, and the train departed, leaving  him to muse on the &ldquo;ars amatoria,&rdquo; as understood in the navy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you have enjoyed yourself, dear,&rdquo; said Lady Richardson, arranging Billy&rsquo;s  tie and kissing Billy&rsquo;s nose, but addressing Leah; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you ought to have.  This darling has won you pots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim nodded, rather wearily. The cackle of the hen over her chick worried her,  and she retreated to the most distant corner, bored by maternal fussiness. This  visit had taken her a step farther, but it was most annoying that success  should make her feel uncomfortable. Aksakoff, misapprehending her reasons as he  did, would certainly assist her materially. But Katinka,&mdash;bur-r-r-r! Why couldn&rsquo;t  conscience quit worrying?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17"></a>Chapter 17</b> </h2>
  <p>Even  the skilful find it no easy matter to drive a kicking, squealing team. The  off-horse must be flicked into decorum, the near leader soothed, the wheelers,  bearing the heat and burden of the day, encouraged into pulling with a will.  Then, a deft hand on tugging reins, a quick eye for the deviations of the road,  some knowledge of mouths, tender and hard, and manifestations of that will  which makes of vehicle and quadrupeds a coherent whole&mdash;these things must be  attributes of the god in the car. Likewise of the &ldquo;Dea ex machina,&rdquo; although  Lady Jim was in and not out of the vehicle. Enthroned with whip and ribbons,  she drove a team of five. And in the odd number lay the difficulty of bringing  the car of Destiny to the selected stables.</p>
  <p>For  by this time, rejecting an overruling Providence other than the fetish, who was  a domestic god and biased, Leah looked upon herself as her own omnipotent and  triumphing Destiny. She would, so she decided, expunge Jim, utilise Askew and  Katinka, obliterate Demetrius, and assist Muscovite politics through Aksakoff.  This team, in harness, and rendered obedient by blinkers, she controlled with  considerable judgment, and made, single-hearted, for her goal. That the actual  Destiny, whose r&ocirc;le she affected to play, might upset her smoothly-running  chariot by a judiciously placed and unlooked-for stone, she never paused to  consider. So far as she could see, the course was clear to the prize&mdash;a  money-bag, which she would seize as a victorious widow of the wrong sort.</p>
  <p>Askew  was the odd animal of the team, the fifth wheel on her chariot, though he was  less like a horse than a troublesome and over-faithful dog. Notwithstanding her  prohibition, he invaded San Remo, played a most exasperating Patience on a  monument along the promenade, and dodged her angry eyes round convenient  street-corners. She could not go abroad but what he turned up in unexpected  quarters, nor could she remain at home without his appearing, to excuse, on  frivolous pretexts, a wholly unnecessary visit. Luckily, the Hengists approved  of his frank looks and modest manners, else she might have been compromised.  Even in easy-going Italy such cicisbeism was annoying.</p>
  <p>Later,  Lady Jim returned to London, for that season invented by man, and left him to  kick his heels in cross isolation. But, even before the Curzon Street house  could be warmed, he rang the bell, and presented himself in the character of a  martyr. For the sake of the future Leah kept him in the team, but she gave him  more of the whip than he liked, and also&mdash;ironically&mdash;a marked almanack, limiting  his visits. But that she had some liking for him, and much use, she would have  bundled him into the arms of the fixture, with strict orders to give those same  arms a legal right to embrace him for ever. But Askew himself put an end to  that chance of being safely bestowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will Marjory say if you make my house your hotel?&rdquo; she asked, when he appeared  on the fifth day of the week for the eighth time, and at afternoon tea, too,  when she, with a hard day&rsquo;s pleasure behind her, was recruiting for the night&rsquo;s  fatigue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  he asserted, sulkily and guiltily; &ldquo;she has no right to control my actions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends upon your feelings towards your future wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is not my&mdash;I mean, we have broken it off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  Lady Jim was frankly exasperated. She as a married woman, and he as an engaged  man, could platonise to any extent; but he free, and she shortly to be a widow&mdash;what  then? She would no more make him her husband than she would allow Demetrius to  lead her to the altar. And here he was, selfishly placing himself in an  eligible position for the very matrimony she declined to contemplate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marjory  and I decided we were not suited,&rdquo; he explained, but timidly, because her eyes  flashed. &ldquo;She takes half the income, and marries that fox-hunting ass. I am  free with the rest of the money&rdquo;; he waited for congratulations which never  came. &ldquo;I thought you would be pleased,&rdquo; he blundered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  pray why should I be pleased?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believed&mdash;I fancied&mdash;you&mdash;you liked me,&rdquo; he stuttered, growing red.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tolerably&mdash;as  an engaged man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you&rsquo;ve been playing with me?&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I ever tell you so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  vanity thought! Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Leah&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kaimes&mdash;which  is my married name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  gasped. Her amazing impudence reduced him to staring silence. She had lured him  to her feet with sweet looks and significant smiles and cooing words, till he  had been deceived into thinking that her passion was as strong and as true as  his own. Now she reminded him that she was&mdash;married. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he gasped again, and  Lady Jim laughed shortly. Her cat-nature was enjoying this mouse-play.</p>
  <p>Visitors  had come and gone, and they were alone in the dainty drawing-room, with an  untidy tea-table. Askew, having escorted her home from Ranelagh, had waited for  an hour with stubborn patience for this solitude of two. His end had been  gained, and now&mdash;he looked helplessly round, as though seeking for some third  person to explain if his charmer were a demon or a woman. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, once  more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nearly  six,&rdquo; said Leah, consulting her bracelet. &ldquo;How long do you intend to stand  there saying &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;?&rdquo; and she mimicked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  James Kaimes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  even Lady Jim,&rdquo; he said, clenching his brown hands. &ldquo;Oh, you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; His voice  became inarticulate with sheer anger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray  consider that you are in my house,&rdquo; she reminded him coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  never come here again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is as you choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I can&rsquo;t live without you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  flattering!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I won&rsquo;t&rdquo;; he came a step nearer the low chair in which she sat, but her  derisive laugh made him pause. &ldquo;Leah&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;love you!&rdquo; His voice broke, and he  stretched out his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw that ages ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why did you&mdash;did you?&rdquo; He stopped, and looked at her with imploring eyes. &ldquo;I  thought you loved me,&rdquo; he murmured, choking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you thought!&rdquo; said she, ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it not true? Have I been deceived? No!&rdquo; he flung out a beseeching hand; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t  speak&mdash;I cannot bear to hear the truth. Let me go&mdash;let me go,&rdquo; he stumbled  towards the door, blindly. &ldquo;You have broken my heart; but I&rsquo;ll go away&mdash;far away&mdash;to  South America, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, my God!&rdquo; he leaned against the wall and covered his  face with his hands.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim might have been in the stalls of a theatre for all the personal feeling she  had hitherto shown. But his last words brought self uppermost. If he went to  South America, he would certainly see Lola Fajardo, and, possibly, might come  face to face with Jim. Recognition of an admitted corpse would spoil Jim&rsquo;s game  and her own. Askew, for she put herself in his place, would certainly make  things unpleasant, and she did not wish to provide a scandal in high life for  circulating extra editions of newspapers during the silly season. Besides, he  was really a nice boy, and she would miss his good looks and canine attentions.  Both circumstances and inclinations demanded that she should keep him under her  eye. An explanation came to her while he sobbed at the door&mdash;looking very  ridiculous, she thought&mdash;and she made use of it, to soothe his sorrow and save  herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  silly boy,&rdquo; she began, and the beginning produced an effect she was far from  foreseeing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silly!  Yes, I am silly,&rdquo; he admitted between his teeth, and flinging back his head to  regard her with fierce, wet eyes. &ldquo;I am silly to have believed in you and in  your false affection&rdquo;; before she could protest against this language&mdash;she had  risen to do so&mdash;he hurled himself across the room, and gripped her wrists so  tightly that she could have screamed with pain. &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t treat me in this  way&mdash;do you hear, you shan&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not going to be whistled to your feet like a  dog and then kicked aside. Married! Yes, you are married, as you were when you  whistled. But hang your husband and damn your husband&mdash;he has no claim on you,  other than a legal one. Mine you are, and mine you shall be. I tell you, Leah&rdquo;&mdash;he  shook her in his anger&mdash;&ldquo;that you must leave this man, and come with me. You  must&mdash;you must!&rdquo;&mdash;he dragged her hands to his breast&mdash;&ldquo;you shall!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;  She gasped his name in sheer surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Harry&mdash;the fool, if you will; the man, as you shall find.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how  dare you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I do dare, and I shall dare more, if you play football with my heart. Why  couldn&rsquo;t you leave me alone? Why couldn&rsquo;t you stick to the man whose name you  bear? Don&rsquo;t struggle, for you shan&rsquo;t be free till I have had my say out. You  made me love you&mdash;now I shall make you love me. You and your society rubbish,  and gimcrack rules, and polite lies, and make-believe of truth! You with&mdash;ah-r-r-r!&rdquo;  he shook her again&mdash;&ldquo;you over-civilised coquette, you Circe-of-many-wiles, you  ruin of honest men! Do you think that I, who am flesh and blood, care for your  lady and gentleman humbug? No, no! I am a man, you a woman, and we are one; you  hear&mdash;one. If not, I&rsquo;ll put a bullet in your head and another through my own.  You have fooled many, you shan&rsquo;t fool me. There!&rdquo; he flung her roughly from  him; &ldquo;now you can ring for your servants, to put me to the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  bruised wrists and wide-open eyes Leah stood dumfoundered. Jim, at his worst,  had never been like this. If he had been she would have truly loved him. At the  moment she very nearly loved Askew, recognising in his outburst that masterful  nature which every woman adores and succumbs to. In spite of her dexterity in  playing with amorous fire, it really seemed as though she was burning her  fingers on this occasion. Naturally, she enjoyed the experience. This reversion  to cave-life thrilled her pulses. Had Leah been capable of loving anything with  a beard she would have then and there fallen at Askew&rsquo;s feet and implored him  to trample on her. But her absolute ignorance of the strongest of passions,  save self-love, snatched the victory in&mdash;what would have been to an ordinary  woman&mdash;the hour of defeat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  she said, admiration struggling with anger, &ldquo;you are a brute!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man, still panting from conflicting passions, acted strangely and foolishly, as  men do at crucial moments. He smoothed his hair, arranged his tie, and pulled  down his waistcoat, not looking at her but into a near mirror. Yet he saw her  astonished face at second hand, and smiled grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can be a brute,&rdquo; said he, ominously quiet; &ldquo;but you haven&rsquo;t seen me at my worst  yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens!&rdquo; This was undoubtedly a man&mdash;<i>the</i> man&mdash;the dominating male, the  genuine lord of creation, whose animal honesty can rend the cobweb  entanglements of the female sex, and does rend them, when the bandage of love  inopportunely slips. Defiance would not lure him again to his proper position  at her feet; and she was half afraid of the might her trickiness had evoked.  But in woman&rsquo;s weakness lies woman&rsquo;s strength, and Delilah pulled down the  corners of her mouth to subjugate Samson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  poor wrists!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>Askew  wheeled from the mirror, shied, and winced; but his mouth and eyebrows were  still three straight lines.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  poor wrists!&rdquo; reiterated the temptress, moving towards her pre-historic man; &ldquo;see&mdash;you  have bruised them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  could see that he had; they were under his eyes, under his very nose, but he  threw aside his head, with the modern equivalent of a word which a cave-man  might have used in some such plight. Adam was weakened into aggressive  firmness.</p>
  <p>Eve  offered a more tempting apple. &ldquo;If you really loved me&rdquo;&mdash;tears emphasised the  murmur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah&mdash;darling!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was again in the toils, and kissing the bruised skin madly, with feverish lips.  &ldquo;How could I be so cruel?&rdquo; he mumbled, and slipped to her victorious feet. &ldquo;Oh!  oh! oh!&rdquo; in three distinct keys. &ldquo;Forgive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will promise not to leave me,&rdquo; she whispered tenderly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!  never! never! never!&rdquo; a kiss on alternate hands for each word.</p>
  <p>Circe&rsquo;s  magic having evoked the brute, she knew thoroughly the sort of animal she had to  deal with. Considering that she had no feeling of love, or even pity, to create  fervour, Leah acted admirably. Cooing like a mother over her babe, and with a  seraphic look, she bent above the tame animal, less to caress him than to make  sure that the halter was round his neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  foolish, hot-headed boy! Do get up and talk sensibly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  subjugated obeyed meekly, all the fire out of his veins, and sat like a whipped  schoolboy in a distant chair, which she indicated with regal indignation. &ldquo;For,&rdquo;  said Leah, as if she were announcing an entirely new fact, &ldquo;I am a married  woman&rdquo;; and she slipped behind the tea-table to prevent further demonstrations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; sighed Askew, disconsolately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why did you behave so badly, you wicked boy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  jewellers&rsquo; windows are tempting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jewellers&rsquo;  windows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look into them, and see pretty things you can&rsquo;t buy. Naturally, a fellow wants  to smash the glass and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand the parable. But a thief has to reckon with the law, and so has a  married woman. You would not like to see me divorced, Harry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would like to see you my wife,&rdquo; he retorted, evasively and stubbornly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!  I am already a wife. If I eloped with you, what respect could you have for me?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should have whatever you liked, including you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  I don&rsquo;t like, and won&rsquo;t give,&rdquo; said Leah, indignantly. &ldquo;In you I looked to find  a friend, and I find nothing but ungoverned passion, that would drag the object  of his adoration in the mud. Oh! oh!&rdquo;&mdash;out came the inevitable handkerchief&mdash;&ldquo;how  I have been deceived!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time, the brute, with a penitent tail between its legs, was beginning to  believe itself entirely in the wrong. Lady Jim, seeing this, became more than  ever a tender woman. &ldquo;I forgive you,&rdquo; she declared, plaintively, from behind a  handkerchief mopping dry eyes; &ldquo;this scene will be as though it had never been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  my feelings,&rdquo; rebelled the cave-man, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  always be those of sacred friendship for a much-tried woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can they be, when&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you have made such a fool of yourself? Ah, my poor Harry, forget your folly.  Remember only that I forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t exactly mean that,&rdquo; grumbled poor Harry, scenting sophistry, but unable  to prevent the war being carried into his camp. &ldquo;You&mdash;well&mdash;you see&mdash;Oh, hang it,  Leah, you know that I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  with that true love which is at once tender and respectful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These  sentiments were really noble, but somehow the bewildered man was not in the  mood for copy-book philosophy. &ldquo;You offer me a stone and call it a beautiful  loaf,&rdquo; said he, bitterly, and with heat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  parable! How biblical you are becoming!&rdquo; said Lady Jim, desperately weary and  with her eye on the clock. &ldquo;I do not understand, nor do you, my poor boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand that you have made a fool of me,&rdquo; he snapped brusquely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no! Nature has been beforehand there,&rdquo; she retorted, beginning to lose her  temper with a man who would explain. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Harry! Go home, and think  of our future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Our</i> future!&rdquo; He leaped to his feet with a shining face.</p>
  <p>Leah  regretted the misused pronoun, and began to anticipate renewed melodrama. But  her little tin god, pitying a votary whose nerves were jangled by stupid  honesty, sent a seasonable visitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  Grace the Duke of Pentland,&rdquo; announced a grandiloquent footman, flinging wide  the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  look so disgusted!&rdquo; Leah flung an angry whisper in Askew&rsquo;s lowering face as she  sailed forward to meet her father-in-law. &ldquo;How are you, Duke? This is a  surprise&mdash;a delightful one, of course. I never expected so pleasant a visitor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  room was tolerably dim, and the Duke had not the keen sight of his youth. &ldquo;Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;!&rdquo;  hesitated His Grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Askew,&rdquo; chimed in Lady Jim, glad that the mask of twilight was on the younger  man&rsquo;s very cross face. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just going. You know Mr. Askew, of course, Duke. I  met him at Firmingham. Must you really go, Mr. Askew? So sorry! We may meet at  Lady Quain&rsquo;s to-night&mdash;I look in there for half an hour. Good-bye for the  present. So kind of you to see me home from Ranelagh! Very dull, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  and, rattling on to drown any too tender word he might let slip, she hustled  him to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  future!&rdquo; breathed the inconvenient third, opening the gate of paradise most  reluctantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  the brutes have instincts, if not sense,&rdquo; snapped Lady Jim, scathingly, and  Adam, without Eve, took his solitary way down the stairs, to be dismissed into  a cheerless world by an indifferent footman.</p>
  <p>To  prevent interruption, Leah closed the door herself, and switched on the  electrics, before she returned to her untimely visitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you be long, Duke?&rdquo; she asked, again consulting the clock. &ldquo;I have to dress for  dinner. Mrs. Martin&rsquo;s, you know: a stupid woman with a bad cook. Such a bore!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder you care to see people when Jim&rsquo;s away,&rdquo; said Pentland, fretfully, and  she noted suddenly his aged looks.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim felt inclined to retort with the proverb of the absent cat and the jubilant  mice, but she really felt sorry for the old man&rsquo;s drooping mouth and additional  wrinkles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t see any one, if you like, Duke&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s no pleasure to make  conversation without ideas. Do let me ring for hot tea&mdash;you look so tired. Sit  down in this chair&mdash;and the cushion&mdash;there!&rdquo; She made him comfortable with  genuine womanly sympathy, wondering, meanwhile, what was ageing him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  tea, my dear. I can only wait for a few minutes; my carriage is below. Tired?  Yes, I am very tired; worried, also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  wrong, I hope,&rdquo; murmured Leah, sympathetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim,  my dear&mdash;poor Jim! Have you heard about his health lately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes! Last week I received a few lines, and he said that he felt ever so much  better. His cough is almost gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Pentland, sadly; &ldquo;like all consumptives, he is too hopeful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  became nervous and anxious. Had Jim been obliterated at last? &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she  demanded irritably. &ldquo;Is he&mdash;is he?&rdquo; her tongue could not form the lying word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Worse&mdash;yes,  much worse,&rdquo; said the Duke, rubbing his forehead and producing a letter. &ldquo;This  is from Demetrius. We may expect&mdash;oh, my poor son!&rdquo; and he almost broke down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t trust these doctors,&rdquo; remarked Lady Jim, skimming the letter with a  feeling that Demetrius was really too imaginative. &ldquo;They always shout wolf,  when the animal is miles away. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you see, Demetrius says that poor Jim may go off at any moment&mdash;and Demetrius is  a clever man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may be mistaken. I have heard of surprising recoveries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pentland  shook his head, and groaned. &ldquo;Not Jim. I had a conviction that I should never  see him again when we parted in this very room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  absurd!&rdquo; argued Leah, artfully. &ldquo;Jim was quite well till he caught that stupid  cold at Firmingham. Why should he go off suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  they call galloping consumption is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t believe it. Nothing would surprise me more than to hear of Jim&rsquo;s death&rdquo;;  and she soothed her conscience with the reflection that this speech was  perfectly true, considering Jim had the strength of a bull and the appetite of  a shark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I lose him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t lose him. I&rsquo;ll send a cable to Demetrius, and if Jim is really so sick, I&rsquo;ll  go out and nurse him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pentland&rsquo;s  face lighted up, and he pressed her hand. &ldquo;How good of you, my dear! It will  ease my mind; but&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;I never thought you cared enough about Jim to  inconvenience yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim  has given me very little reason to care for him,&rdquo; said Leah, with some  bitterness. &ldquo;If he had been a better husband, I should have been a different  woman&rdquo;; she used the stale argument tactfully and regretfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;m  afraid that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the Duke, recalling his son&rsquo;s peccability; &ldquo;but he is  so ill. Forgive and forget, Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  your sake, if not for Jim&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said gracefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send the cable this  very night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  she did. When Pentland, overflowing with outspoken approbation of her correct  conduct, took his leave, she went to her desk and hunted out a cypher with  which Demetrius had supplied her. It would not do to let the postal authorities  know of their schemes, and the cypher was a particularly intricate one. Leah  spent an hour in concocting her cablegram, and was late for dinner in  consequence. But she had a good appetite, all the same, in spite of the bad  food and the dull conversation. For, on their way to Kingston, Jamaica, were a  few lines in cypher, a translation of which would have been of great interest  to the father-in-law, who thought her so womanly and good.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Duke  wants me to nurse Jim,&rdquo; ran the cypher, when Demetrius used the key. &ldquo;Wire that  there is no need.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  Jim had really been dying, she would not have altered a single word.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18"></a>Chapter 18</b> </h2>
  <p>An  urchin throws a stone into the horse-pond. Circles; form, not only in the still  water, but in the fluent air, to enring invisibly our sphere. And who can say  to what limit they recede, if limit there be? So with a carelessly selected,  hastily flung word. Had Lady Jim said <i>your</i> future, Askew, assuming no  coupling, would have grumbled himself back into tame-catism and canine  contentment with casual head-pats. But, <i>our</i> future! The pronoun bulked  portentous. Its three letters encompassed, to the lover&rsquo;s prolific imagination&mdash;divorce,  remarriage, a life-long duet and amorous communings in the highest paradise  attainable by those yet moving in time.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim, less philological, gave him to understand, that a single word could by no  means embrace such various interpretations. She again emphasised her  matronhood, called Askew&rsquo;s attention to the spotless reputation he wished to  smirch, and intimated that poor Jim&rsquo;s illness precluded her from thinking of  anything save poor Jim&rsquo;s possible decease. &ldquo;In which sad case,&rdquo; mourned Leah, &ldquo;we  could renew our conversation without reproach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  widow has no bridesmaids, I believe?&rdquo; hinted Askew, reflectively. She hinted  back with sweet smiles, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you prefer a quiet wedding?&rdquo; And on this  adjustment of the situation he built castles, believing the foundation to be  sound. Strangely enough, in so honest a gentleman, the heartlessness of  utilising possibilities connected with the Kaimes&rsquo; vault never occurred to him.  Which proved, without need of words, the essential selfishness of the feeling  he miscalled love.</p>
  <p>On  this arrangement Lady Jim frolicked gaily through the remaining weeks of the  season, well content that things were as they were. A Jamaica cablegram, which&mdash;it  designedly not being in cypher&mdash;she could and did show to the Duke, informed  both that a wifely nurse was needless. The last word of the communication  promised a letter, which duly arrived. This last also was a public document,  Demetrius being too cunning to detail criminality in black and white. Pentland  and Leah read the letter cheek by jowl. Lord James was a trifle better, said  the script, and if able to outlast the voyage, would return to England, en  route for Algiers. Lady James could then nurse him into health, say, at Biskra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  heaven,&rdquo; quavered the Duke, not reading between the lines, as did his  better-informed daughter-in-law. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a party and go there for the  autumn. Frith will be delighted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  Jim&rsquo;s account?&rdquo; inquired Leah, dryly. &ldquo;Rather an effort, Duke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  my account,&rdquo; rebuked the old man. &ldquo;Frith knows that if Jim is to leave us&rdquo;&mdash;his  voice faltered and fell&mdash;&ldquo;I should like to see him depart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  does the prodigal son always banquet on the calf?&rdquo; mused Lady Jim, restoring  the letter to her pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, many failings require many excuses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it seems. Selfish people receive more praise for one creditable action, than do  those kind-hearted fools who spend their lives in self-denial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must encourage the good seed to grow, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  laughed unpleasantly. &ldquo;It usually springs up wild oats, with over-attention!&rdquo; and  she departed to consider the inexplicable growth of green bay-trees.</p>
  <p>Lord  Frith had never given his father the slightest trouble; he was a model son, an  admirable husband; his friendships were staunch, and his life clean&mdash;yet  Pentland contented himself with perfunctory praise of these qualities. He  expected his eldest son to be a domestic Bayard, as the unimaginative Marquis  had shown no desire to sow the wind. Jim, on the other hand, left the reaping  of his whirlwind to doting relatives. Devourer of husks with congenial swine,  and caring only for his large, healthy, greedy self, he had never done a kind  act or shown a filial trait. A spendthrift, a rogue in grain, cursed by many  men, blessed by no woman, he&mdash;this profligate egotist&mdash;was dealt with not only  tenderly, but in a way calculated to assure him that he was a pearl without  price. His notorious failings were covered by the phrase that &ldquo;he was his own  worst enemy,&rdquo; and the presumed possession of good qualities, never manifested,  entitled him to paternal pity. Leah, an easy-going sinner herself, was not hard  on those who dwelt in glass houses. But this gilding of Jim&rsquo;s base metal made  her gorge rise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the use of being good?&rdquo; she moralised, as her brougham sped towards Curzon  Street. &ldquo;Kindness is looked upon as weakness, and the more generous one is, the  more those who don&rsquo;t know the meaning of the word sponge and sneer. If you are  really bad, sham philanthropists reclaim you and cocker you up, and praise you  loudly if you say &lsquo;Hang&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Damn!&rsquo; A sinner repents, and Heaven is  a-flutter; a saint makes one slip, and the world yells hypocrite. A pied  person, neither white nor black, is left alone, as the majority are of that  mottled complexion. To be really good is to be hated; to be extremely bad means  excuses, help, and trumpetings. Frith gets the kicks without deserving them,  and Jim the half-pence he has never earned. Clever Jim, who has chosen the  world&rsquo;s better part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  will be seen that Leah, being of the world, judged as the world, and yet with  greater discernment. In one way she was right. It is generally your sinner who  gobbles up the cakes and ale. But Lady Jim&mdash;no very ardent Bible student&mdash;misread  texts, or rather, read her own material meaning into them. Therefore, although  conversant with green bay-trees&mdash;did she not dwell in a grove of such?&mdash;her  memory did not recall the axe that might be laid to the roots thereof. The  Seventy-third Psalm might also have assisted her to a better understanding of  undeserved worldly prosperity, had she done other than gabble it hastily, when  it happened to come into the service. But the fetish which stood to her in  place of the Living God did not encourage spiritual explorations, and Leah saw  life as a comprehensible stretch of time, limited by birth or death. The  hereafter&mdash;if any&mdash;she could not conceive, knowing only the present as the real,  the actual, and the true. Therefore did she grudge Jim his undeserved  coddlings. Had he lain on a bed of his own making, it would have been justice&mdash;strict  justice; but that fools should prepare him a feather mattress and downy pillow  seemed, and really was, intolerable. Thinking of the Duke&rsquo;s wasted and  misplaced affection, Leah plucked the fruit of her Tree of Knowledge. &ldquo;Good  people need missionaries,&rdquo; said Lady Jim.</p>
  <p>However,  as Jim and she had occupied separate rooms for many a long day, his  featherbedism troubled her little. Also, Askew had been brought to heel by the  promise of future bones. The plot was being rounded off in far Jamaica without  her aid, and what with Sir Billy&rsquo;s winnings and a moderate cheque cajoled out  of the Duke, she had enough to keep the wolf from the Curzon Street door. On  the whole, things could not be improved, and it only remained to exercise  patience. But of this virtue Leah possessed little, and did not care to expend  what she had in twiddling her thumbs at home. Jim was away, so she could play&mdash;and  did. A masked ball at Covent Garden amused her immensely; the plays condemned  by Sir Billy found in her a lenient critic; and now that Pentland had paid off  old bills, she ran up new ones with the zest of a woman who required nothing.  Also, she went to Epsom, and pulled off a decent sum on a tip breathed into her  ear by the racing baronet, whom she had snubbed into slangy admiration. To  Hurlingham and Richmond she raced a split-new motor-car of the latest pattern,  and exhibited her nerve and skill in the Park. Charity bazaars, Savoy dinners,  bridge parties, Sunday river excursions, and such-like time-killers beheld her  in varied and tasteful frocks, and she also dined with those friends upon whose  cook she could rely. Altogether, she enjoyed the life of a busy idler, and had  that remarkably agreeable time which magnificent health, comparative wealth,  and a conscience of no importance would give to such a woman. But her head duly  governed her frivolities, and she made no plans for the Cowes week, although  she knew a manageable man with a delightful yacht. The daily expected decease  of Jim had to be considered, and thoughtful Leah had already designed her  mourning. Meanwhile, she babbled of Biskra to Lady Canvey, and rather overdid  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you and Jim going on a second honeymoon?&rdquo; inquired that suspicious old dame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are,&rdquo; replied Leah, calmly. &ldquo;How clever of you to guess it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  The poor wretch must be worse than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see; my affection, to your mind, is too obvious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  non-existent can never manifest itself,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, in scientific  English. &ldquo;Either a miracle has happened to give you a heart, or Jim is dying,  and you are getting ready to dance on his grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  coloured with suppressed anger. This plain speaking annoyed her, and she  disliked people who peeped behind the scenes. &ldquo;Jim and I are not angels,  godmother,&rdquo; she said with dignity; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re pals enough to make me regret his  death. My mourning, though you may doubt it, will be perfectly sincere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Canvey gave a dry laugh. &ldquo;See Carlyle on the &lsquo;Philosophy of Clothes.&rsquo; Well, I  shan&rsquo;t pay your bill at Jay&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks.  I don&rsquo;t ask you to. The total might involve a larger cheque than you would care  to sign.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure of that, my dear, seeing your mourning is to be perfectly sincere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  impracticable old woman and her god-daughter were alone, else this snapping  might not have occurred. Leah had rather neglected Lady Canvey of late, because  that astute octogenarian had locked up her cheque-book. But on her way to an &ldquo;At  Home&rdquo; she had looked in for a few moments, and sat in the stuffy Victorian  room, radiant in a cr&ecirc;pe ninon frock of Parma violet, elaborately flounced, and  with a fichu and short sleeves. The dress was simple enough, and she wore  little jewellery; but her dazzling neck and shoulders and arms, her glorious  hair and calm strong face, would have made her noticeable even in a crowd of  picked beauties. Lady Canvey, whose ill-humour was mostly surface-crabbedness,  for she preferred losing a friend to withholding an epigram, could not refrain  from grudging compliments. But between women these rang hollow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look charming to-night, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  the storm, the sunshine,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, smiling at such novel civility. &ldquo;Well,  I appreciate the change. Whatever my faults may be, godmother, you cannot say  that I am disagreeable. I always call, in spite of your&mdash;your&mdash;what shall we say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Home-truths!  And you call when it suits you. Humph! Perhaps I am a trifle short-tempered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  trifle!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old  age has its privileges,&rdquo; Lady Canvey reminded her; &ldquo;and you can be so cleverly  nasty when you like, that it amuses me to bring the worst out of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a doubtful compliment! Do you extract amusement from the Tallentire girl in the  same way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has no bad in her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, and you never try to bring out the good which does <i>not</i> amuse you.  Sunday schools are beneficial rather than entertaining. I don&rsquo;t see Miss&mdash;what&rsquo;s  her name?&rdquo; and Lady Jim glanced round the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joan  Tallentire,&rdquo; snapped her hostess; &ldquo;you remember the name well enough. It&rsquo;s  fashionable to have a short memory, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  debts,&rdquo; said Leah, sweetly; &ldquo;but Miss Tallentire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is looking after her father&rsquo;s house, as the mother is ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  woman! I hope Lionel is not preaching at her, to make her worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lionel  isn&rsquo;t always in the pulpit. By the way, Leah, he told me that he had a serious  talk with you at Firmingham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he? Yes! I believe he did give me a dull quarter of an hour. Something about  sin, I fancy it was. Parsons have a monomania on that subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Canvey made an angry noise in her wrinkled throat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re impossible,&rdquo; she  pronounced tartly. &ldquo;Lionel wishes to improve you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Jim? Charity should commence with his own family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  my dear, Lionel admires you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  He <i>is</i> a man, then. I don&rsquo;t think I ever made running with a clergyman;  it might be rather fun. I suppose Lionel would recite the Song of Solomon to me&mdash;there&rsquo;s  lots of love-talk in it. Not very proper talk, either, I&rsquo;m told. Perhaps  Solomon wrote it for married women; he had some experience of them, hadn&rsquo;t he?  He collected concubines, didn&rsquo;t he?&mdash;just like a stamp-maniac.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah,  you&rsquo;re insufferable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  impossible!&rdquo; She rose to go, and arranged the fur-lined Medici collar of her  evening wrap in the dim mirror. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m about to be punished for my sins. The  Duke made me promise to go to this At Home. Mrs. Saracen, you know&mdash;she&rsquo;s one of  the submerged Upper Ten, or she married one of them; I forget which, though I  know she has something to do with a pickle, or a sauce. Very amusing old thing,  too. She gives you a nutshell biography of every one before she introduces.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  on earth for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  so that you may be warned against people&rsquo;s skeletons. Mrs. Saracen points out  the cupboard and tells you not to open it, and of course you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Canvey chuckled. &ldquo;Rather clever. And her friends&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Male  and female, I believe. She collects people who have done something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the criminal way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  would, if the law allowed them out of gaol. But at present she contents herself  with freaks. I don&rsquo;t go to middle-class menageries as a rule, but at the Duke&rsquo;s  request I patronise this one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  to-morrow and tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you&rsquo;ll promise to be nice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  godmother was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Leah, my dear,&rdquo; she said at length, taking  the gloved hand, &ldquo;I am sorry we always quarrel when we meet. I really have a  corner in my heart for you, and if you were only less&mdash;less&mdash;&rdquo; Lady Canvey hunted  for the right word&mdash;&ldquo;less exasperating, we should get on excellently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim nodded, squeezed the bony hands, and kissed the wrinkled cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us make a fresh start,&rdquo; she said gently, for she really felt sorry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come every  day while Miss Tallentire is absent and tell you the news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a good girl. Goodnight. Enjoy yourself, my dear&rdquo;; and the two parted better  friends than they had been for months.</p>
  <p>On  her way to Mrs. Saracen, who lived in the wilds of Kensington, Leah saw herself  in the new character of dry-nurse to a spiteful old harridan, and wondered at  her good-nature. Why should she bore herself with a spent octogenarian, whose  sole attraction was the possession of money, with which she declined to part?  Yet Lady Jim had promised daily visits to this ruin, and what is more, for no  reason discoverable to herself, intended to keep her promise, even though there  was nothing to be gained by such self-denial. The idea that she, of all people,  should do something for nothing, tickled her greatly, and the street-lamps  swinging past the brougham flashed on an amused face. She was so pleased with  discovering virtue in such an unexpected quarter that she quite forgot to look  mournful when her hostess inquired after Jim&rsquo;s health.</p>
  <p>The  waist upon which the Honourable Mrs. Saracen had prided herself somewhere about  the middle of the nineteenth century was now a matter of guess-work. Her  stoutness impressed even the unobservant with the conviction that she had eaten  her way through life, and was at present engaged in digging a not-far-off grave  with her teeth. And, for her age, she had an astonishingly good set,  obtrusively genuine. Her general appearance was in keeping, for she wore her  own white hair in smooth bands, under a Waterloo turban, fearfully and  wonderfully made, and presented a natural face of winter-apple rosiness, scored  with good-humoured wrinkles. As Nature had made her, and Time had aged her, so  she was, growing old healthily, if not gracefully. In an alarming dress,  many-coloured as Joseph&rsquo;s coat, she wheezed like a plethoric poodle, and rolled  in a nautical manner by reason of her bulk. Who would have guessed at a brain  hidden in this ponderous mass of adipose?</p>
  <p>Yet  she was a self-made woman, who had acquired a large fortune by the sale of &ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s  Sauce.&rdquo; Therefore did current gossip accuse her of beginning life as a cook. A  perfect invention, this, as she was a gentlewoman who had, intellectually,  married beneath her&mdash;that is, she had bought with the sauce money a scampish  aristocrat of the Jim Kaimes type, only less manly. He had long since drank  himself into the family vault, and had left his wife with one son, who was now  in the army. Every one liked Mrs. Saracen, in spite of her eccentricities, and  love of glaring colours, and many a society pauper had reason to thank her for  timely help. And to cap her good qualities, she professed open pride in the  sauce, which appeared on every middle-class dinner-table throughout the three  kingdoms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  Lady James,&rdquo; she wheezed, wagging two fat hands, like a seal its flappers, &ldquo;how  good of you to come! You will find some interesting people here&rdquo;&mdash;she looked  round with pride at the collection of lions, old and young, tame and wild, fat  and lean, sham and real. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Wallace here&mdash;let me present him. Charming  man&mdash;very outspoken&mdash;great traveller&mdash;Zambesi&mdash;knows cannibals intimately!&rdquo; Then,  behind a plump hand, whispered a nutshell biography, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention his wife&mdash;divorce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  warned, Leah got on excellently with the lean, brown, keen-eyed man, who  confessed to extensive explorations. &ldquo;Cannibals?&mdash;yes, Lady James, I know a few  and love them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  strange affection, Mr. Wallace! Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  ate a man I detested. I fear he disagreed with them in death, as he always  disagreed with me in life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim laughed. &ldquo;Is there any one here you would like to make a side-dish of?&rdquo; she  asked, letting her eyes rove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I am a complete stranger in London. It is the one place I have not explored.  But Mrs. Saracen has told me the past of many here, and I can give you  histories, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, then. Only don&rsquo;t give me dates, else the women here might scratch. I don&rsquo;t  know these creatures myself,&rdquo; she went on, with the calm insolence of a great  lady; &ldquo;to me they are like your Central African natives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree, Lady James&mdash;only less civilised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Niggers  wear no clothes, and, therefore, are more modest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can quite imagine it. That thin lady over there is evidently of your opinion&rdquo;;  and Leah glanced at a mature damsel who wore just sufficient clothing to  prevent interference by the police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Fastine? She&rsquo;s a Naturopath, and is trying to revert to primitive simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  such a figure she might stop short of the Garden of Eden,&rdquo; said Lady Jim,  dryly. &ldquo;I never heard of a Naturopath. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  American sect, which needs solitude to carry out its theories. The members  sleep in the open, cover themselves with earth when they feel sick, and  advocate the altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are joking, Mr. Wallace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  traveller stifled a laugh. &ldquo;Upon my word, Lady James, I am in earnest. The sect  really does exist. That stout man talking to Mrs. Saracen belongs to another  queer lot. Calls himself an Osteopath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  on earth is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  who cures by vitalising the nerves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am  as wise as I was before. Any more freaks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yonder  is a Christian Scientist. And the man on the left advocates Mahomedanism as the  State religion in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;While  the dressmakers charge so ruinously, he&rsquo;ll never induce men to take four wives.  And the woman in the red dress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Tansey&mdash;a believer in spirits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I should imagine,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, surveying the lady&rsquo;s nose, which was long and  thin and the hue of her gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! I talk of heavenly spirits. Lady Tansey has a large circle of departed  friends, who rap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a bore! As if one didn&rsquo;t get enough of friends in this world, without worrying  them to knock out bad grammar from the next. Really, Mr. Wallace, I begin to  think Mrs. Saracen must keep a lunatic asylum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  dear no,&rdquo; he answered, chuckling. &ldquo;It is the sane people that are usually shut  up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not the disagreeable people,&rdquo; retorted Lady Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you go to those lengths, there would be no society,&rdquo; said Wallace, with a  shrug.</p>
  <p>The  traveller&rsquo;s cynicism exactly suited Leah&rsquo;s humour at the moment, and she made  him take her in to supper. Meanwhile, Askew, who had not seen Lady Jim arrive,  was watching the grand entrance with a lowering face. He had called at Curzon  Street, and thence had borne a message for Leah which he was anxious to  deliver. Already he had been bored to distraction with faddists and their  whims, and was seriously thinking of slipping away, when Mrs. Saracen bore down  on him for the fourth time. Before he could object she had him by the arm, and  confronted him with a severe-looking woman, pensive and solitary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  let me introduce you to Miss Galway,&rdquo; she wheezed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get on so well with  Mr. Askew, dear Miss Galway. He&rsquo;s navy, you know, or has been&mdash;left it&mdash;going to  be married. And Mr. Askew, if you can talk of Ph&oelig;nician inscriptions to Miss  Galway, she&rsquo;ll entertain you for hours. Quite an authority on Solomon, I  believe&mdash;very clever, most intellectual!&rdquo; Then aside, hastily: &ldquo;Say nothing  about her brother&mdash;jail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Poor  Askew! Miss Galway proved to be a limpet, and held on to him desperately, not  because he was handsome, but for the sake of the two ears he possessed, into  which she could pour her arch&aelig;ological triumphs.</p>
  <p>She  prosed in a manly voice about Hiram of Tyre and the building of Solomon&rsquo;s  Temple, and the probability that its design was copied from the Shrine of  Moloch, and the remains that Zerubbabel must have found after the Babylonian  captivity, until his poor head buzzed like a saw-mill. In the hope of stopping  this endless trickle of nothings he cajoled her to the supper-room. There, at a  small table well-covered, Lady Jim ate and drank and chatted, light-heartedly,  with a sharp-eyed, sun-dried mummy. She nodded a &ldquo;How d&rsquo;y do?&rdquo; to her sailor,  and smilingly observed his entanglement. Luckily for the preservation of Askew&rsquo;s  temper, a rival arch&aelig;ologist arrived to discuss Hittite grammar, and he managed  to slip away while the male and female dryasdusts wrangled over the probable  origin of the Perizzites.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t been near me all the evening,&rdquo; complained Leah, when Wallace received  his cong&eacute; and Askew sat in the seat of the scornful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  see you arrive, worse luck. If you&rsquo;d been dosed with Hivites and Jebusites and  all that truck, as I&rsquo;ve been, you&rsquo;d have a headache, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  unusual for you to have a headache.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  inevitable for me to have a heartache.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  account of that alphabet woman, I suppose. Why don&rsquo;t you feed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  appetite. But if you&rsquo;ll come along to the Cecil&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. We&rsquo;ve been there much too often of late. People will talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  them! What does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything  matters, when people have tongues and eyes, and envious natures. Don&rsquo;t be  silly. I promised the Duke to stop here for half an hour. And after all, it&rsquo;s  amusing. I never knew such people existed outside <i>Punch</i>. Well&mdash;what now?&rdquo;  This because, with sudden recollection of an oversight, he brought out an  envelope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  was waiting at Curzon Street,&rdquo; he explained, handing it across, &ldquo;and the  butler, thinking it might be important asked me to&mdash; Why, what&rsquo;s the matter,  Leah?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was his turn to inquire, for, reading while he talked, she had suddenly  whitened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Leah,&rdquo; she snapped, with the irritation of a shaken  woman, then re-read the cablegram, again and again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  husband is&mdash;dead!&rdquo; She crushed the paper into a ball, rose to go, and dropped  back, overwhelmingly faint. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she moaned faintly. For once in her life of  shams and sneering and playing with other-world fires she was moved to genuine  emotion.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_19"></a>Chapter 19</b> </h2>
  <p>Leah&rsquo;s  emotion&mdash;as she felt&mdash;was almost cruelly genuine. It bore the trademark of  sincerity; it made her heart hammer furiously against her ribs, and drove the  blood from her cheeks. Yet she knew that Jim still lived; that the lying  cablegram was but a necessary card to play for the winning of large stakes. For  once, the expected had happened&mdash;that was all. Why then should she exhibit  emotions which could not possibly have been caused by the excuse offered to the  public. Her heart replied with brutal directness, that she had crossed the Old  Bailey Rubicon, and was actually participating in a crime. The last word shook  her out of cotton-wool wrappings into a naked world. Up to the receipt of the  cablegram she could have drawn back. Now, fully committed to the adventure, she  was compelled to tread a perilous path. A criminal! Yes: she had been one in  intention, which mattered little; she was now criminal in fact, and that meant  punishment. Her imagination conjured up visions of the possible. The judge  spoke, the prison gaped, the bolts shot home, Curzon Street was exchanged for  Wormwood Scrubbs. Ugh! But after all, such queasy thoughts were unnecessary. If  she had broken the eighth commandment, she fully intended to keep the eleventh  and unwritten one, &ldquo;Thou shalt not be found out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  truth to Mrs. Saracen, excusing a hasty departure, served to circulate the  fiction of Jim&rsquo;s death, which the widow wished to be speedily and widely known.  She could not have selected a bell with a better clapper. Promulgated by the &ldquo;sauce  queen,&rdquo; the sad invention shortly became town-talk, and, disseminated by myriad  tongues, ran like a prairie fire throughout Society, with a capital letter. A  more weighty bag on the postman&rsquo;s back resulted, and commiserating platitudes  showered on Leah, as thick as the over-quoted leaves of Vallombrosa. She  glanced through many, replied to a few, and burned&mdash;very wisely&mdash;the majority.  Between-whiles her attention was given to parcels from Jay&rsquo;s, and  considerations of widows&rsquo; caps, and the recognition that the feminine uniform  of woe clothed with marked distinction a really beautiful mourner. To women,  grief has its consolations in crape millinery.</p>
  <p>Seclusion  was necessary in those days of lamentation, but none the less wearisome. To  play the nun, while people scattered to Cowes and the Continent, chafed the  chameleon woman. Some intimate sympathisers she received, and to these she  matched mournful words with a mournful countenance. With the blinds half down  and sal volatile at hand, in a becoming gown, and using a handkerchief, three  inches black-bordered, to redden the driest of eyes, Lady Jim held funereal  receptions, and spoke in low tones of her late husband&rsquo;s hitherto unknown good  qualities. His palpable evils she cloaked with the &ldquo;his-own-worst-enemy&rdquo;  phrase; and mentioned twice that, if not an angel, he at least had been a man.  The visitor addressed made her exit expressing hopes that Lord James was an  angel now, and the door closed in time to prevent her seeing Leah&rsquo;s enjoyment  of the picture thus cashed on her amused mind. &ldquo;Jim, an angel!&rdquo; murmured the  widow, wiping away real tears. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d bet on his flying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  the Duke she played her comedy of sorrow very prettily. Pentland and Frith  arrived in haste, while the Marchioness hurried on beforehand, to prepare Leah  for the interview. But she was already word-perfect in her part. Aware that  Lord Frith would discredit ostentatious grief, she assumed the position of a  shocked rather than a broken-hearted widow, though she said nothing but what  might have been inscribed on Jim&rsquo;s tombstone. Not a crocodile tear did she shed  under Frith&rsquo;s too-observant eyes, but sat near the Duke, holding his gouty lean  hand, and skilfully impressed the trio with the belief that she and the  deceased had not been so far asunder as was supposed&mdash;the corollary of such  impression being that she honestly regretted Jim&rsquo;s untimely demise. No more  could be expected, even from the most forgiving woman, and no more was demanded  by the ducal family.</p>
  <p>After  these preliminary condolences Pentland suggested that Leah should come to  Firmingham for the funeral. It was necessary to agree to this, and she did with  graceful readiness; only intimating that she would remain in town, until the  remains arrived at Southampton. Even as she made the stipulation, she wondered  how Demetrius had contrived to transfer Garth&rsquo;s body from Madeira to Jamaica  for the deception.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought poor Jim would have been buried where he died,&rdquo; she remarked  tentatively.</p>
  <p>The  Duke was shocked. &ldquo;Certainly not. Jim, poor fellow, must rest with his  ancestors. We must look upon his face for the last time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  plucked nervously at her black gown, and wondered if the Russian was wise in  submitting a substituted corpse to family scrutiny. &ldquo;They say that death  changes people,&rdquo; she ventured uneasily, &ldquo;and of course, embalming&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what I said to Bunny,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Frith, in too vivacious a tone for the  occasion. &ldquo;We shall hardly know Jim with the soul out of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My&mdash;dear&mdash;Hilda!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Bunny, you know souls aren&rsquo;t buried.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  go to a better world, as Jim&rsquo;s has gone,&rdquo; mourned the doting father.</p>
  <p>Frith  looked doubtfully at his sister-in-law. The less said about Jim&rsquo;s destination,  the better: therefore did he crush sentiment with dry business. &ldquo;I expect  Demetrius will arrive with the remains about the end of the month,&rdquo; said he, in  the hardest of voices; &ldquo;after the funeral, we can see about the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  leaves everything to Leah,&rdquo; his father informed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  And what had Jim to leave behind him besides his character?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  insurance money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes.  Jarvey Peel&rsquo;s present. Twenty thousand pounds&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  accumulations,&rdquo; supplemented Lady Jim; &ldquo;but need we talk of such things, now?&rdquo;  and she sighed the conversation back to sentiment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so&mdash;quite so,&rdquo; quavered the Duke, shaking his head; &ldquo;terrible loss to you, my  dear&mdash;and your natural grief, and&mdash;hum-hum&mdash;&rdquo; Further fossilised phrases escaped  his memory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly feel for poor Jim,&rdquo; said Leah, with sedate dignity: &ldquo;he had his  faults, of course; but then, so have I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  kind remembrance of Jim excuses the few you possess,&rdquo; was Pentland&rsquo;s reply;  while Frith, compressing his thin lips, made no remark.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  there was no chance, for Hilda clamoured that Leah should come to her house for  beef-tea and consolation. She had never agreed with her more sceptical husband  about the Curzon Street menage, and credited Lady Jim with the requisite  virtues of a genuine widow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  strength must be kept up, dear,&rdquo; she babbled, as though she expected Leah to  faint then and there. &ldquo;I know exactly how you feel. Just as I should, if Bunny  became an angel. But we must all die, dear Leah, and death is the gate of life,  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you leave these proverbial condolences to Lionel?&rdquo; broke in her exasperated  husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Bunny&rdquo;&mdash;with a wail&mdash;&ldquo;the sacred dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  the child talk,&rdquo; commanded Pentland; &ldquo;she expresses my feelings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  encouraged, the child did talk, and Lady Jim listened with a bent head to  original remarks about Time, the great consoler, and meetings on a golden  shore, to part no more, and keeping the loved memory green, and bowing to the  inevitable, and such-like official utterances, without which no funeral is  complete. When Hilda stopped for want of breath and memory, Leah kissed her  with the affection of one deeply moved, and observed that she was tired. And  indeed she was&mdash;bored to death, in fact. So the Marchioness, pleased with her  plagiarised eloquence, took leave tactfully and tearfully on the Duke&rsquo;s arm.  Frith lingered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you laugh?&rdquo; he said dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  Hilda in the pulpit? Why should I. She means well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!  I allude to your demure listening. I do not wish to speak ill of the dead, and,  after all, Jim was my brother. But are you really and truly sorry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a way, if you <i>will</i> press for an answer. One can&rsquo;t live five years with a  man without missing him at the breakfast-table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!  Though you and I pretend otherwise, to console my father, we know that Jim was  no saint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I?&rdquo; she asked, shrugging.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Politeness  forbids my answering that question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see what politeness has to do with this interview. Have you remained to  make yourself disagreeable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  my honour, no. You&rsquo;re a clever woman, Leah, and as a scamp&rsquo;s wife you have  conducted yourself admirably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I am now the scamp&rsquo;s widow, had that not better have been left unsaid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frith  shrugged in his turn. &ldquo;I suppose so, since we have agreed to call black white.  But I waited to say that I&rsquo;ll help you in any way you wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  was surprised, and touched. She and Frith had never been good friends.  Apparently, he was not such a bad sort after all. But what was behind this  offer? Her ineradicable suspicion of human nature made her doubt, though she  spared him the question. &ldquo;It is very good of you,&rdquo; said she, cordially, &ldquo;but  with the insurance money and this house, which your father says I can retain, I  shall do very well. There is no need for you to open your purse, or your heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Marquis hunched his shoulders and let them drop. &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; he repeated, biting his  forefinger; &ldquo;you will be marrying again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has that to do with you?&rdquo; she flashed out, haughtily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you bear our family name,&rdquo; he reminded her, &ldquo;and Demetrius&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim felt qualmish. &ldquo;Demetrius?&rdquo; she echoed faintly. What could Frith possibly  have to say about the prime mover in the plot?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man is crazy about you,&rdquo; said he, frowning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t help lunatics being at large,&rdquo; said Leah, reassured as to his meaning and  at once on the defensive. &ldquo;Have I encouraged him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  hastened to protest. &ldquo;Oh no. As I said before, your conduct as Jim&rsquo;s wife has  been admirable&mdash;truly admirable. But I should not like to see you marry  Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should you think me willing to do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t, since the man is a foreigner and poor and untitled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can be a prince and wealthy, if he chooses to be reconciled with the Russian  authorities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  then, Leah, do you really like this man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  a clever doctor and an amusing talker&mdash;yes. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frith,  baffled and perplexed, bit his finger again. &ldquo;He is devoted to you; they talk  of it at the clubs. No, no,&rdquo; hurriedly, as she turned crimson with indignation;  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a word said against you. But this absurd infatuation&mdash;and you a  widow; these foreigners go to ridiculous lengths, so you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly do not see,&rdquo; interrupted Leah, with conviction. &ldquo;Did you offer assistance  so that you might meddle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no, no,&rdquo; protested the Marquis, looking shocked; &ldquo;but you have behaved so well  as Jim&rsquo;s wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the third time you have said so, and I am by no means stupid. It seems to  me,&rdquo; she looked straight at him, &ldquo;that you believe M. Demetrius will ask me to  marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  it ease your mind if I say that I have no intention of accepting any  impertinent proposal he may make?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will and it does,&rdquo; said Frith, bluntly. &ldquo;I should not like to see you throw  yourself away on that man. Should you marry again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be entirely my own affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, of course. All the same&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so! Good-day, Lord Frith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  smiled grimly, seeing that she would not permit him to finish a single  sentence. &ldquo;Am I to take your use of my title as an intimation that we are to be  strangers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the extent of supervision, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you can&rsquo;t manage things unaided.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  also is my business. As your interference is concerned with M. Demetrius, and I  have set your mind at rest on that point, there is no more to be said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you please. Still, this Demetrius&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Demetrius,&rdquo; she echoed, enraged by this parrot repetition. &ldquo;I never wish to  hear his name or set eyes on his face again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was true enough. Now that the Russian had served her turn he could go hang; she  had no further use for him, and he could whistle for his well-earned wages.  When Frith, after further interrupted expostulations, took his leave, Lady Jim  sat down, chin on hand, to consider this town-talk. The love-sick babbling of  Demetrius troubled her little. No scandal could attach to a Diana who never  hunted the noble quarry, man; and Leah was such a known lover of herself that  even scandal refrained from giving her a rival. Still, the Russian was pertinacious,  and could be vindictive; he had fulfilled her bidding for a certain price, and  that price he would assuredly demand. Make him her second husband she would  not. He belonged to Katinka, who could keep him and welcome. The remembrance of  the daughter suggested the useful father.</p>
  <p>Aksakoff,  unfettered by honourable prejudices, certainly could help her, for the  attaining of his own ends, if Demetrius became troublesome. Could she lure him  to Paris, his disappearance from her life would only be a question of days,  perhaps hours. But, for the moment, she did not see how to export her  accomplice to Siberia, via the gay city, without becoming a more active agent  than was wise. One Russian had her&mdash;there was no blinking the fact&mdash;under his  thumb; and to remove that pressure, in the only way in which it could be  removed, meant the substitution of a similar thumb. She would merely jump from  the frying-pan into the fire&mdash;both equally uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>On  this account, and lest she should exchange King Log for King Stork, Leah  hesitated to enlist Aksakoff s assistance. Luckily, there was no need to come  to an immediate decision. She had three weeks at least to consider the matter.  The funeral, the procuring of the insurance money, natural grief, for the  tricking of the world, and the regulation period of mourning&mdash;she could oppose  these obstacles, should Demetrius press his suit unduly hard. This being so,  she flung off the burden for the time being, although the necessity of settling  the matter, sooner or later, haunted her thoughts. Such insistence of the  disagreeable broke up her rest, and she would waken at dawn, to plot escape.  Chloral, occasionally, aided her to sleep the difficulty out of her head: but  she detested drugs that demand extortionate repayment for their kindness, and  used narcotic discreetly. A week of these haggard hauntings aged her. Anxiety  became apparent in hollow eyes and colourless cheeks. One day, with outspoken  horror, she discovered an entirely new wrinkle, and noted later that the  unexpected opening of a door caused her nerves to jump. Kind friends ascribed  such things to commendable sorrow for the dead, and Leah tacitly accepted their  comforting and petting on this obvious plea. But not to regret a thousand Jims  would she have risked her beauty; as, after her tongue&mdash;for Leah put brains  before looks&mdash;it was her keenest-edged weapon with which to fight the world, and  was supremely powerful to control fools.</p>
  <p>Daily  the stream of sympathising friends rolled through the dainty drawing-room, and  bore Lady Jim away from comedy grief to more pleasant shores, where gossip of  he and she and the &ldquo;tertium quid,&rdquo; interspersed with millinery discussions and  shrewd female handling of current society events, made things more tolerable.  Lady Richardson babbled herself in, with a box of chocolate from Sir Billy&mdash;a  consolation not unpalatable to Leah, who liked Billy and loved sweets. &ldquo;Both  being acquired tastes,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, but not to the little mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  thoughtful of him, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; chattered Lady Richardson, who was coloured in  subdued tints, with a gown to match, for the visit. &ldquo;The dear boy! He said to  me that we must prevent you from breaking your heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  prescribes eating,&rdquo; said Leah, humorously. &ldquo;I never knew Sir Billy was so  young. Thank him for me, Fanny, and tell him that when I think of taking a  second I&rsquo;ll give him a look in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Billy has thought of that already&mdash;such a boy as he is. You&rsquo;re sure to have a  badly spelt proposal from him, dear. But seriously speaking, will you,&mdash;oh, of  course you will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&mdash;you have not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  heart is buried in the grave of Billy&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; murmured Lady Richardson,  pensively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dig  it up again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  there&rsquo;s Reggy Lake, of course; but he&rsquo;s so poor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the more reason that he should propose. You have a good jointure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Settled  entirely on myself,&rdquo; said the little woman, shrewdly; then added romantically, &ldquo;I  must be loved for myself alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Lady Jim shrugged. &ldquo;If you expect miracles!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really,  Leah!&rdquo; Her visitor became pinker than her rouge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that men are selfish, dear. They always have their eye on the cash-box,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope that won&rsquo;t be your fate, darling,&rdquo; was the spiteful reply, for Lady  Richardson always scratched back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my face is my fortune, Fanny. Jim, poor dear spendthrift, has left me with only  a few thousands, which won&rsquo;t last long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think not, in your hands, dear. But there is Mr. Askew and Dr. Demetrius&mdash;both  admire you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Admiration  does not necessarily mean marriage. And at present I think more of my loss than  of a second husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  sweet of you, and so proper. But you might take a look at the market. Mr.  Trent, now, the South African. He&rsquo;s a millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I should think, from his manners.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Canvey!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  give me a grandmother-in-law of the worst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Jacob Machpelah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man who has taken his name from Abraham&rsquo;s cemetery? I suppose he thought it  sounded Scotch. No, thanks. My name is Hebrew, but my tastes are Gentile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Johnny  Danesbury!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  penny doll with a squeak. I want a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Colonel  Harrington!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a brute, without instinct. I begin to think you keep a matrimonial agency,  Fanny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wouldn&rsquo;t pay, were you my only client,&rdquo; retorted Lady Richardson, still  remembering the miracle dig. &ldquo;No one seems to satisfy you. I believe you mean  to marry Askew, after all. What of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a nice footman, and doesn&rsquo;t ask wages. Aren&rsquo;t these suggestions rather  premature? My heart, like yours, may be in my husband&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know he was buried yet,&rdquo; said the little woman, crossly. &ldquo;How impossible  you are, darling!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always,  when people get on my nerves, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you want some other woman&rsquo;s husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  dear no! I never covet my neighbour&rsquo;s ass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shot  and shell were flying rather thickly, and seeing no chance of planting her flag  on Leah&rsquo;s bulwarks, Lady Richardson beat a discreet retreat, with Judas kisses  and Parthian shots. &ldquo;So glad if I have cheered you up, dear [kiss]! Bear up and  don&rsquo;t break your heart [kiss, kiss]! So sweet your sorrow, and so genuine  [kiss, kiss, kiss]!&rdquo; And having given several Rowlands for one Oliver, Lady  Richardson departed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cat!&rdquo;  said Lady Jim to the closed door, and settled to munch Billy&rsquo;s chocolates over  Marcel Pr&eacute;vost&rsquo;s <i>Lettres d&rsquo;une Femme</i>.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20</b> </h2>
  <p>The  supposed remains of Jim Kaimes duly arrived on British ground in charge of an  extraordinarily anxious medical attendant, and Lord Frith arranged for their  transfer to Firmingham. There, Leah was already established as Niobe,  studiously dismal in the jet-trimmed, crape-flounced equivalent of sackcloth.  With the Marchioness, a few decayed cousins, and many hired mourners, connected  closely or distantly with the family, she assisted the Duke to lament his  Absalom. Therefore, behind lowered blinds, in the twilight atmosphere of the  great house, did officially grief-stricken relations move warily on tiptoe,  speaking in hushed voices, with downcast eyes, of the deceased and his  post-mortem virtues. The apotheosis of the prodigal son, who had thus quietly  come home, made the place about as cheerful as a mausoleum.</p>
  <p>Limiting  the solemnity strictly to the family, Lionel was requested to inter Jim&rsquo;s body,  with the rites in which Jim&rsquo;s soul had never believed. Then, for the first  time, did he behold Leah in her new character, as hitherto a sympathetic letter  had excused a personal interview. Now, face to face, Kaimes considered the  advisability, as clergyman, relative, and friend, to administer presumably  needed consolation. This last straw broke the widow&rsquo;s overladen back. She had  wept with Pentland, mourned with kith and kin, enduring also, for three dreary  weeks, twaddling platitudes, written and spoken, by meddlesome well-wishers.  These exasperating necessities would have been unendurable, even had Jim been  where he deserved to be; but that she should suffer them, when Jim was  rejoicing as Mr. Berring and expecting his share of the money she thus  laboriously earned, nearly drove her beyond the bounds of decorum. She could  have thrown the novel she was reading at Lionel&rsquo;s head, and barely escaped  doing so, when he appeared in her sitting-room, almost aggressively  sympathetic. But, reflecting that with the funeral would come a cessation of  these aggravations, and mindful that the money was almost in her purse, she  asked him to be seated and prepared to stomach aphorisms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  good of you to come!&rdquo; she sighed conventionally; then added, to avert, if  possible, protracted boredom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dull company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally,  Lady James; but I rejoice to see that you are resigned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not tearing my hair and gnashing my teeth, if that is what you mean. I will, if  you think Jim worthy of such excesses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  hush! He is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see evidences of that on all sides of me,&rdquo; replied Leah, tartly. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you  say that he is not lost but gone before? I believe that is one of the stock  phrases of your profession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  moved uneasily. It was difficult to whitewash Jim, and he could not invent  non-existing virtues on the spur of the moment. &ldquo;He was your husband, remember,&rdquo;  was his effort to parry this thrust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord, don&rsquo;t I know it? Would I put up with all this, else? Did you come to tell  me that Queen Anne is dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came to cheer you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, then. Tell me a funny story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  curate looked and felt shocked. &ldquo;Lady James&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lionel,  if you preach I shall scream,&rdquo; cried Leah, developing whirlwind passion, and  rising a veritable Bellona; &ldquo;or else I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;oh!&rdquo; she ripped her handkerchief  viciously, while sweeping tempestuously up and down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll  do, if you play Job&rsquo;s comforter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  cheeks flamed, her eyes sparkled, and her voice leaped an octave as she flung  the last words at him. Lionel started up, surprised at this sudden anger, and  wondered if grief was bringing on hysteria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  you sit down?&rdquo; said the obtuse man, giving the worst possible advice to the overstrung  woman. &ldquo;A little sal volatile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sick of sitting down, and lying down, and sal volatile, and listening to  humbug, and wearing black, and being bothered. I&rsquo;ve had more trouble over Jim  in his death than I ever allowed him to give me in his life. You say the same  silly things every one else says&mdash;you&mdash;you parrot! Can&rsquo;t you be original?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death  is such an old-established institution that it is difficult to be original,&rdquo;  said Lionel, resuming his chair with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I shall talk myself. Yes; I wish to speak plainly, and to you I intend to speak  plainly, since you are the only man I respect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay you are priggish,&rdquo; went on Lady Jim, finding it a marvellous relief to  speak loudly and without reserve; &ldquo;but you are honest in spite of it, and you  don&rsquo;t gossip, though you <i>are</i> a parson. In trouble I shall always come to  you, padre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are in trouble now,&rdquo; hinted Kaimes, smiling at her frankness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  What? Yes, of course, Jim&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo; She choked over the lie, and returned to  laugh at ease in her chair. &ldquo;Where has he gone, Lionel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  Lady James! I admit that he had his faults.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  honest. He had nothing else but faults.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! We all have our good points.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me a list of Jim&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she suggested derisively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the moment, I can&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  nor you wouldn&rsquo;t if you thought for a century. Jim is as bad as they make &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Was</i>&mdash;if  you will abuse him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, I forgot. Well, then, Jim <i>was</i> bad; and I don&rsquo;t know if you call  telling the truth abuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  the most virulent sort, on occasions. Are we not all sinners?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  for yourself, Mr. Humility.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel,  amazed by this self-canonisation, became less Aaron the priest and more Adam  the natural man. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call yourself immaculate, surely,&rdquo; he observed  sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  inference; and if no sinner, you must be saint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  I see. Lamp-black or snow-white; grey does not exist. Parsons see the horizon,  the doorstep, but no middle distance. Woman is Lucrece or Jezebel, with you. I  am neither; but a simple woman, as God made me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  as the devil has marred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foh!  In this very room, when we spoke last, I scouted that bogie&rsquo;s existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you don&rsquo;t believe in evil existing, you can&rsquo;t in good. No devil, no God, Lady  James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew that the Deity depended upon Satan for his being,&rdquo; said Leah, dryly;  &ldquo;and theology doesn&rsquo;t amuse me&mdash;it&rsquo;s cobwebs and spindrift. Talk sense, if you  must talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel,  hoping to lead her by a side-path to further consideration of her spiritual  needs, consented to diverge for the moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk money, if you call that  sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do; uncommon sense, as there is so little of it. Money?&rdquo; She looked at  him questioningly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  insurance on your late husband&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  Well?&rdquo; She wondered what he was about to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Duke asked me to interview the lawyers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  unnecessary. I know all about the twenty thousand pounds. Jim left it to me, by  will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  underestimate by ten thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  Thirty thousand pounds?&rdquo; Then, in answer to a nod, &ldquo;Oh, you&mdash;you must be&mdash;be  mistaken.&rdquo; Leah was truthfully agitated. Had the golden goose laid two eggs  instead of one?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  your husband&rsquo;s life was insured, when he was a child, for twenty thousand  pounds with profits, at an annual premium. Mr. Jarvey Peel and his executors  paid the money to keep the insurance in force&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; and the principal was payable to Jim at sixty, or to any one he might  leave it to at death, I, as the widow, take all&mdash;all&mdash;all&rdquo;; she repeated the word  three times, in the purring voice of a cat over cream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  assented the curate, thinking she betrayed over-plainly horse-leech parentage; &ldquo;and  the extra ten thousand is the accumulation of an annual bonus of fifteen pounds  on every thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  three hundred a year,&rdquo; calculated Lady Jim, feverishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. Jim was thirty-five when he died. So three hundred a year for thirty-four  years comes to ten thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  hundred,&rdquo; supplemented Lady Jim, correcting his arithmetic. &ldquo;Oh, Lord! Thirty  thousand two hundred pounds, and Jim never knew that he was worth his weight in  this gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  never inquired, since the money would not come to him till he attained the age  of sixty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would have been almost double then,&rdquo; commented the lady, pensively. &ldquo;What a  pity Jim did not live till&mdash; But no; we should have both been old then, and  there would have been no fun. I am content with thirty thousand&mdash;really I am,  Lionel. It doesn&rsquo;t do to be greedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not,&rdquo; said the curate, ironically, &ldquo;else you would have again mentioned the  odd hundreds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  made a ball out of the torn handkerchief and tossed it gaily in the air. &ldquo;That  will do for lawyers&rsquo; costs,&rdquo; said she, airily, &ldquo;though I hope the bill won&rsquo;t be  so extortionate. Thirty thousand pounds!&rdquo; She sprang up, with dithyrambic  utterance, scarcely refraining from a war-dance. &ldquo;Thirty thousand golden  sovereigns! Six thousand lovely, lovely Bank of England notes! Oh, Vanderbilt!  Oh&mdash;&rdquo; The sight of her relative&rsquo;s disgusted face curbed her ecstasy: &ldquo;You think  that my exultation over this money is vulgar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heartless,  at least, since it is the price of your husband&rsquo;s death. To you, apparently,  Jim is more valuable dead than alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  entirely agree with you,&rdquo; confessed Leah, candidly; then added with impatient  anger, &ldquo;Do you expect me to tell you lies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might show some grief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens!  What else have I been doing for the past three weeks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuming  a virtue which you have not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  remark is too clever to be original, my dear man. How impossible you are! I  wear mourning and cry at the right time, and say things I don&rsquo;t believe about  Jim to his father and the rest of them; while to you, who blame me for behaving  decently outside, I speak as I feel, only to be condemned. What do you expect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see you exhibit some real grief,&rdquo; said Lionel, who was really angered by her callous  behaviour. &ldquo;You show more genuine emotion over this miserable money than over  poor Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Jim,&rdquo; she mocked scornfully; &ldquo;are you going to cry up his virtues?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was not so bad as you make him out to be,&rdquo; retorted Lionel, doggedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he must have revealed a side of his nature to you which he never showed to me,&rdquo;  snapped Leah, sharply. &ldquo;Foh! what&rsquo;s the use of acting to empty benches? Go  downstairs if you want an audience. We are behind the scenes here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  allegorical and needless. Can&rsquo;t you be more womanly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I were, the sal volatile you recommend would be needed, I can tell you. Being a  parson you will not understand; being a man, you cannot. Womanly! womanly!&mdash;does  that imply cant and shams? Am I to mourn with spurious lamentations that  selfish profligate, who would have broken my heart had he ever possessed it? To  be womanly is to excuse a man&rsquo;s faults, to lie down and be trodden upon, to  condone unfaithfulness, and to be grateful for the shreds and patches of an  egotistic life. Never! never!&rdquo; Her lips twisted scornfully, her nostrils  dilated, and she clenched her hands to restrain an outburst of that wrath which  had consumed her during five years of holy matrimony. Lionel, astonished by her  sudden transition from gay to grave, forbore interruption, and she declaimed  her marital wrongs in a Boadicean vein. &ldquo;I have read in that Bible of yours of  the casting of pearls before swine. Jim was a Gadarene pig, who would have rent  me had I loved him, as I admit a wife should love her husband. My coldness, and  what you consider my selfishness, was my sole safeguard against ruin and sorrow  and outrage. You know that I speak the truth&mdash;I defy you to say otherwise. Jim!  oh, Jim,&rdquo; she laughed unpleasantly; &ldquo;Jim&mdash;that rag doll of his family, who is  placed on a pedestal and worshipped, as though he were the golden idol he never  was and never could be! I respect the Duke much more than I ever respected my  husband, for he is genuinely blind to Jim&rsquo;s faults and mourns honestly. But you&mdash;you,  who knew the man, and rebuked the man&mdash;oh, it would be amusing were it not so  shameful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  bosom heaved as she hurled this speech at him, with gibe and jeer and ironic  laughter. &ldquo;I thank God that the man is out of my life,&rdquo; was her passionate cry.  &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I thank God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you believe in God you would not say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  Theology again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  is not theology and never will be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends upon belief. The science which treats of God, and of man&rsquo;s duty to God,  cannot be understood by you, who have neither hope nor faith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  least I have charity, the greatest of the three, which you lack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me an example.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  credit you with honesty, while you cry me down as a bad woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me. I do not say that you are bad. Misguided, rather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why&mdash;according to your lights? Because I do not put up Jim as a pig-idol, to  worship with crocodile tears?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  silenced Kaimes for the moment, as there was much truth in her overstated  contention. No decent woman could have loved or honoured the dead man; and this  outspoken condemnation, provable in the main, was assuredly more honest than  pretended laudation and sham sorrow would have been. Yet the merciless  indictment jarred on Lionel&rsquo;s sense of propriety, righteous as he knew it to  be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man is dead,&rdquo; said he, testily; &ldquo;leave him to God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  held her peace. It annoyed the ordinarily self-possessed woman, that for one  fierce moment emotion should have overleaped judgment. Reining in her passions,  she relapsed into the sober jog-trot necessary on the rutted road of conventionality.  But Lionel&rsquo;s final speech provoked a laugh. Would his laudation of the dead,  she wondered, change to criticism of the living, did he learn the truth?  Feminine desire for the last word would have blurted out this final argument,  but that an innate masculine discretion recommended silence. Therefore did she  compromise with the laugh, which Lionel, misunderstanding, resented with the  warmth of a generous nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is positively cruel,&rdquo; said he, indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  human, I think,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, yawning away the reaction.</p>
  <p>Following  his own line of thought, the curate did not traverse this statement. &ldquo;A woman  can make of a man what she pleases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly;  but I had a beast to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you think more kindly of him, now that he is gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Leah, decisively. &ldquo;I would not say so to every one, but I do to you, out  of respect for your character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am both flattered and grieved. Be lenient, Lady James. Are you so good  yourself, that you can refuse charity to the dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  shrugged her shoulders and crossed her feet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a trifle personal, isn&rsquo;t  it?&rdquo; she asked good-humouredly; &ldquo;like the rest of this futile conversation.  Well, for the first time and the last, I shall pay you the compliment of  defending myself. To begin with, my friend, your definition of good and bad  depends upon dogma, so we disagree at the outset.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us take the primary instincts of being, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I fear we have not the time to begin with Genesis. What is left of poor Jim  arrives in charge of M. Demetrius within two hours, and I must prepare myself  for the scene there is bound to be. To be brief in my defence, I can safely say  that I am better than most women. I never gave Jim the chances he gave me of  appearing in the divorce court. I keep my temper, even when most provoked. I  don&rsquo;t say nasty things about those who run me down, and always help those I  like. I avoid the use of slang and of excessively strong drink. I neither  smoke, nor indulge in morphine. I invariably go to church, with half a crown for  the plate; and&mdash;and&mdash;I think that includes all my virtues. What more would you  have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unselfishness,&rdquo;  responded Lionel, gravely; &ldquo;egotism is your sin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the world&rsquo;s. I might inquire with the Apostles, and I do inquire, with all  curiosity, &lsquo;Who then can be saved?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  whose merits do not spring from the ego, as do yours. To you, Lady James, Satan  comes in his favourite guise, as an angel of light, and only the Ithuriel spear  of the Holy Spirit can unmask him. Virtuous! I grant you are&mdash;because you pamper  self too much to sacrifice your position and comforts to a love that is willing  to lose the world for love alone. Good-tempered!&mdash;why not, with a healthy body  and an equable nature? That you do not gossip is certainly a point in your  favour, although I suspect that this abstinence is again the ego, which does  not permit you to be sufficiently interested in others to discuss their  affairs. You help those you like&mdash;feed them, as it were, with the over-abundant  crumbs from your table; in the words of our Lord I can say, &lsquo;Do not even the  publicans so?&rsquo; But would you help those you hate, and at a sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. Why should I? They would not be even grateful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. You expect a reward for your good deeds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  this world. You look for yours in the next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  though I admit that the temptation is strong. I try to serve God out of love  and gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ridiculous,  even if true. Such self-abnegation is beyond me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that is what I call being really and truly good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see&mdash;that is, I don&rsquo;t see. You are always so impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  is impossible with God&rsquo;s help, as without it nothing is possible. Listen, Lady  James&rdquo;; and with his soul on fire to raise her from the material to the  spiritual, Lionel attempted reasonable argument. For over half an hour did he  preach, expound, warn, demonstrate, quote, deduce, persuade; but at the end of  thirty-five rapid minutes he found her and himself again at the starting point.</p>
  <p>Leah  listened critically, and even with interest. Hindered by her limitations from seeing  a satisfactory conclusion, she declined the tournament, and retired to watch  her opponent tilt at giants which she mistook for windmills. Said the inversely  deceived Donna Quixota: &ldquo;How well you talk, Lionel! Why don&rsquo;t you leave the  Church and go in for Parliament?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  curate shook the cold water of this douche out of his ears, and rose, markedly  discouraged. &ldquo;I cannot make you understand,&rdquo; he said sadly; &ldquo;only the Holy  Spirit can convince you of your need.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  need of what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  salvation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would be adding sugar to honey, and I feel very contented with my honey. Good  health, plenty of money, a tolerable position, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you have yet to reckon with God. All these things come from Him, and all He can  take away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t agree with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  will you, until your pride is broken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  it never will be,&rdquo; said Leah, superbly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you think in your insolence of beauty and health. But when you come to die?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, I shall die, and that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the glory of the rainbow to the colour-blind?&rdquo; Lionel asked himself, and  walked to the door. There he paused to deliver himself of a final warning: &ldquo;Though  you triumph in your own strength, and be at ease in the palace of sin, yet will  the reckoning come. The Most High God&mdash;IS,&rdquo; and he departed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Word!  words! words!&rdquo; That was Lady Jim&rsquo;s summing up of the interview.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_21"></a>Chapter 21</b> </h2>
  <p>In  that chilly hour preceding dawn, under the searching grey eye of earliest  morning, the coffin was opened in the presence of Pentland and his family. The  likeness between the lawful son and the unlawful, even more apparent in death  than in life, startled the woman best prepared to countenance a gross  deception. Leah could almost have imagined this waxen, awful face to be that of  Jim; and an emotion of genuine fear shook her to the soul she had so  deliberately burdened. Moreover, and not without reason, that haunting thought  of an <i>assisted</i> death became appallingly obtrusive before these medicated  remains. Was Demetrius&mdash;was she&mdash;guilty of&mdash;? Her will fought desperately against  the suggested word, and this mental struggle still further compelled the  revelation of elemental feelings. Streaming tears, trembling hands, furtive  glances, testified to truthful terrors, breaking through calculated pretence.  It needed a scornful look from Frith the sceptic, and an amazed stare on the  part of Demetrius, to assure her that she beheld a corpse of no importance,  save as a substitute for a living double. And even then this ironic inspection  of the false seemed but a gruesome masquerade of Jim&rsquo;s lying in state, when his  turn really came.</p>
  <p>The  actuality of her feelings afforded a welcome escape from further harrowings;  and she left the room, clinging to the arm of Demetrius, careless whither he  led her. The picture gallery was his goal, since its seclusion invited no  eavesdroppers, and here he experimented with personally manufactured salts,  pungent and rousing. These, it soon appeared, were scarcely needed. Lady Jim,  released from the necessity of playing a grim comedy, recovered speedily, and  with recuperation came the disposition to flick away the disagreeable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a fool I am!&rdquo; said Leah, enraged to discover she was but mortal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman, a woman,&rdquo; murmured Demetrius, cynically complacent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  no heroine. Ugh!&rdquo; she shivered, and huddled in her chair. &ldquo;I shall dream of  that thing for the next year. It was so like Jim. Ugh! ugh! Horrible! horrible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should the sight of an empty house so startle you, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am in no mood for metaphors. Go away; you will be needed to shut that thing up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  successor the undertaker will do that. I have done my share.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only hope you have not overdone it,&rdquo; muttered the woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the meaning of that remark, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  wanting to know, yet, fearing to know, evaded an answer and shirked a question.  &ldquo;Leave me for a time,&rdquo; she entreated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;if  you will pardon my rudeness. We have much to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cannot  you wait till after the funeral?&rdquo; she said crossly. &ldquo;It will look so strange,  your remaining here with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but no, madame. To those who might speak I am but your doctor, who has brought  you here to recover yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am perfectly recovered&mdash;perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case we can talk,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
  <p>She  yielded, not being yet her old fighting self after the soul-shaking. It was  dangerous to enter upon a contest with flawed armour, so she temporised. It  would be best, she decided, to hear his story, without committing herself to  comments. Later, when her nerves were steady, she could answer more cautiously  the question he was about to ask at an inopportune moment. Her wary nature  declined a consideration of marriage arrangements, to the extent of fixing a  date for a ceremony in which she did not intend to take part. Still, he could  plead, and she could, and would, procrastinate; therefore would the victory be  with her when this unprepared interview ended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Talk  on,&rdquo; she said languidly; then added, with a spite created by shattered nerves, &ldquo;though  I think it very disagreeable of you, to make me look on that horrid dead thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  was tolerant of feminine irrelevance. &ldquo;Madame, to avert possible suspicion, it  was necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly  it was necessary,&rdquo; admitted self-contradicting woman. &ldquo;But&mdash;what a risk!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  pardon; in the dark, all cats are grey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing about cats, but the faces of the dead certainly vary, M.  Demetrius. And dangers cannot be explained away by proverbs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  this case the danger has explained itself. We are now safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  plural struck disagreeably on Leah&rsquo;s ear, and reminded her somewhat pointedly  of the readjusted relations between herself and the doctor. &ldquo;<i>We</i> are now  safe,&rdquo; she echoed, with reproving emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo;  responded Demetrius, wilfully blind. &ldquo;Monseigneur has been completely deceived;  also M. le Marquis and Madame his wife; while your tears, my dear friend, have  washed away any possible doubts which, for my part, I do not believe existed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  she was faced by positive circumstances, for the Russian&rsquo;s last words hinted a  sarcasm which annoyed her. It might be that, with still quivering nerves, she  looked too anxiously for causes of offence, but the familiar ease of his manner  was unpalatable. A second implied rebuke would avail as little as had the  first, and Leah, mindful of her dignity, abstained from indicating in words the  Rubicon he was not to cross. Demetrius knew overmuch for her to speak  authoritatively, so it was necessary to permit him the odious intimacy of an  accomplice. But he should pay hereafter for his usurpation of such a position:  that she vowed inwardly, even while smiling on his success. Smiling was  possible now, as the prospect of an inevitable verbal duel braced her to  abnormal self-control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down,&rdquo; she commanded abruptly. &ldquo;I have yet to learn details of your scheme.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Our</i> scheme,&rdquo; he reminded her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  flatter me, M. Demetrius, since I cannot take credit for your clever  inventions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are all in the same boat, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  I, and&mdash;?&rdquo; she glanced at him inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you not grasp the fact that I am a widow? When I have a husband,&rdquo; she smiled  meaningly, &ldquo;do you think he will sanction Mr. Berring rowing in the boat you  mention?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suspicious  people are the easiest to gull, and the smile, rather than the words, changed  the gloomy doubter into a confiding child. Her enforced diplomacy was gaining  her ground already. &ldquo;My angel! you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  cleverly shortened a possible rhapsody. &ldquo;Of course I do. Ah!&rdquo; with a  sentimental sigh; &ldquo;what have I done to be so doubted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  by me, I swear. Believe me, soul of my soul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  she raised an admonitory finger to check dithyrambic wooings at an untoward  moment. &ldquo;We are yet in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out  of it, while here&mdash;yes, here, where you so sweetly promised we should become one&rdquo;;  his voice sank tenderly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  certain preliminaries had been observed, M. Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,  Constantine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you will, Constantine. I can deny you few things, after what you have done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  what you deny is what I desire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim displayed impatience at this headlong haste. &ldquo;We are not in Verona, nor  will your age permit you to play Romeo to a Juliet of my temperament. When my  husband&rsquo;s body is buried&rdquo;&mdash;she laughed consciously&mdash;&ldquo;and my months of mourning  are ended, then&mdash;well, then&mdash;ah, be patient, Constantine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I not to touch your finger-tips meanwhile?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it is any satisfaction&rdquo;; and she gave him her hand to mumble, ruminating  meanwhile on this shrinking of giant to dwarf. The unendurable lasted half a  minute; then, &ldquo;Be sensible, M. Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  the child sighed for his lost rattle; &ldquo;you descend from poetry to prose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  nodded. &ldquo;Would you versify explanations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explanations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Necessary  ones. How did you transfer Garth&rsquo;s body to Jamaica?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor looked piteous. &ldquo;To think of wasting this golden hour,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  The ejaculation was careless, but the instinct was to box a dullard&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;Business  before pleasure, M. Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  least, Constantine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M.  Demetrius,&rdquo; she repeated inflexibly. &ldquo;We are to marry, well and good; but  beforehand, I must understand my position as a Russian princess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pessimism of the Slav asserted itself in renewed doubts. &ldquo;I am a simple doctor,  madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  simple, if you imagine&mdash;but that can be discussed later. Come,&rdquo; cajolingly to a  hesitating and sullen being, &ldquo;an account of your adventures must prove amusing.  Cheer me up for the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  extraordinary conclusion staggered a man not easily moved to amazement. &ldquo;Mon  Dieu!&rdquo; Then in English: &ldquo;You were weeping some minutes ago, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I may be weeping some minutes later,&rdquo; she retorted, suppressing rising  irritation. &ldquo;I ask explanations rather than give them. Tell me how you managed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shrugging  away a question relative to female weathercocks, Demetrius reluctantly obeyed.  He desired love-talk, and she hard facts; but naturally her subject forced his  subject out of sight. Man being romantic, and woman practical, the latter  invariably clips the former&rsquo;s wings, lest he should soar beyond the necessities  of her hour. Moreover, his pinions rendered useless, Demetrius could not  dispute common-sense views. Thus, dexterously managed, did he yield to a  puppet, Fate, the strings of which were pulled by obstinacy and selfishness,  blended into what Leah called firmness. She was an adept at ticketing her vices  virtues.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  poor Garth&rdquo;&mdash;the doctor mentioned his late patient thus endearingly throughout  the narrative&mdash;&ldquo;died of consumption.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  consumption?&rdquo; Leah put the question she had been shirking for so long with  nervous emphasis, and with short, indrawn breaths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,  and earlier than I expected. There was no need to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know&mdash;I know! Do not put it into words,&rdquo; she fiddled with her handkerchief,  looking up, down, everywhere except at her companion. &ldquo;Did he suffer much?&rdquo; was  her inquiring whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all; he died in his sleep. Pray do not alarm yourself, madame; the release  was a happy and an easy one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so glad&mdash;so relieved,&rdquo; murmured Lady Jim, seeing the spectre which had long  haunted her pillow dissolve into thin air. &ldquo;You see, I thought&mdash;that is, I  fancied&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated, and passed her tongue over dry lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  need did not arise,&rdquo; explained the doctor, answering somewhat contemptuously  her unspoken fears; &ldquo;although I was prepared to&mdash; No, do not shudder; there is  no blood on my hands, nor on yours. We can marry in peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doubly false prophecy of the last sentence provoked her into ignoring the  entire speech. &ldquo;Go on&mdash;please go on. Garth died a natural death at Funchal.  Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not say that, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absurd!  Why, your explanation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  yet to come, if you will accord me a hearing&rdquo;; whereupon, accepting an  impatient permission, Demetrius slipped into the undramatic&mdash;literally so, for  he avoided oratorical snares, the high colouring of superlatives, and the  temptation to dilate on obviously sensational moments. He might have been  reciting the alphabet, so dry was his deliver of an advisedly barren tale.</p>
  <p>One  Richard Strange, mariner&mdash;so commenced the sober <i>Odyssey</i>&mdash;owned and  captained a sea-gipsy, prowling on ocean highways and in harbour byways for the  picking up of chance cargoes. As an instinctive buccaneer, ostensibly law-abiding,  he lent himself and his tramp-steamer to whatever nefarious proposals promised  the acquisition of money at slight risks. Thus fitted for the Russian&rsquo;s  requirements, secret instructions brought him to anchor in Funchal Bay. With  him sailed, for possible restoration to health, a consumptive nephew, Herne by  name, also a factor in an admirably conceived scheme.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  dead was necessary for the living, and the dead for the dead,&rdquo; said Demetrius,  paradoxically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by that?&rdquo; questioned Lady Jim, very naturally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  body of that poor Garth had to be buried in Madeira, madame; yet, being wanted  here, to pass as the corpse of your husband, it was necessary to arrange for a  substitute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand. Herne was to pass as Garth, and Garth as Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  assented and proceeded. With his two patients the doctor lodged at a  second-rate hotel, not a stone&rsquo;s-throw from the shore. In due time Herne died,  and Demetrius, at once transferring the body to Garth&rsquo;s bedroom, induced the  surviving consumptive to board the <i>Stormy Petrel,</i>&mdash;so the sea-gipsy was  named&mdash;for the purpose of informing its skipper of his relative&rsquo;s death.  Strange, previously advised, detained the young man, and Demetrius proceeded to  bury Herne under the prisoner&rsquo;s name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  easier task than you would think, madame,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;for the Portuguese  landlord confused the names of my patients, owing to his ignorance of their  language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  scarcely of their appearance, I should think,&rdquo; observed Lady Jim, shrewdly.</p>
  <p>Demetrius  shrugged away the objection. &ldquo;I cannot say that the landlord had studied  Lavater. To his uninformed eye, two fair young Englishmen were much alike; and  consumption, madame, begets a family likeness in those it afflicts. I assure  you that this Portuguese was as satisfied that my poor Garth had died, as is  Monseigneur convinced that his son lies in the coffin we inspected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  shuddered for the twentieth time at the mental picture evoked. &ldquo;Ugh! What then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor informed her placidly. As Garth, under a tombstone suitably inscribed,  the skipper&rsquo;s nephew was buried&mdash;the very fact that he had existed thus being  blotted out by a chiselled lie. Then did the sea-tramp loaf&mdash;the word is  appropriate&mdash;over-seas to Jamaica at a slow ten knots an hour; with bad luck it  would seem to one passenger, at least.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  died on board,&rdquo; exclaimed the listener.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  poor Garth&mdash;ah yes; as a child did he fall asleep, to waken&mdash;&rdquo; Demetrius spread  his hands, at a loss to supply further information. His ideas of a future state  were vague.</p>
  <p>With  an admirably embalmed body on board, the disreputable craft of Captain Strange  slipped her anchors in Kingston Harbour; but no half-masted ensign intimated  her lugubrious cargo. Lord James Kaimes, forewarned by a cypher letter, rowed  out to inspect an eidolon of himself, as he would one day appear. His nerves  being shaken by enforced invalidism, he did not appreciate the sight. Also, the  medicines of Demetrius, given to induce counterfeit consumption and lean,  sallow looks, made him fear lest this rascally comedy should deepen into a real  tragedy for himself. Those in Kingston with whom he had made acquaintance were  not surprised when Demetrius took him eastward to the famous Blue Mountains, in  the hope that the healing air would mend his lungs; nor did any one manifest  astonishment when, after a discreet period, news came of his death. Perhaps, if  these sympathisers had seen one James Berring sneak on board the <i>Stormy  Petrel</i>, and had beheld that ship rolling south to Buenos Ayres, they would  have expended less pity on his untimely decease. As it was, while Jim  foregathered with the skipper&mdash;a man after his own buccaneering heart&mdash;former  acquaintances, Government officials, and local doctors were complimenting  Demetrius on the clever way in which he had embalmed the late James Kaimes&rsquo;  body, with such few scientific appliances as could be at hand in the Blue  Mountains.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  had no suspicion&mdash;these people?&rdquo; questioned Leah, abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  assure you, no, madame. My mummy, you saw it, yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  rose, lest her mind&rsquo;s eye should conceive too vivid a picture. &ldquo;I shall always  see it,&rdquo; she murmured, with loathing. &ldquo;Ugh! What a fool I am&mdash;what a fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman, a woman. And so, madame, we recommence our conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has already lasted too long,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;Lord Frith&mdash;&rdquo; Here she stopped, too  discreet to repeat club gossip, which might strengthen still more the already  strong position of Demetrius.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were about to observe, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!  It is of no moment. You are sure all is safe&mdash;sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  sure as I am that we, you and I, shall be happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sentiment  and business mix about as well as snow and fire,&rdquo; snapped Leah, yet ridden by a  nightmare memory of that dead face; &ldquo;but this sailor whose nephew you borrowed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain  Strange? He will say what I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  a price, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  the smallest, madame. One thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!  Extortionate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs,&rdquo; said Demetrius, in dry tones; &ldquo;it  would be well not to vex my friend Strange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wants to vex him? He shall have his money. Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  letter from your late husband&rdquo;; and Demetrius handed over an envelope directed  in Jim&rsquo;s sprawling hand, and sealed with Jim&rsquo;s ancestral coat of arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;  was Leah&rsquo;s comment on this carelessness. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he know he is dead, and is  about to be buried?&rdquo; She thrust the letter hastily into her pocket and was  about to hurry away, when she caught a glimpse of the Russian&rsquo;s darkening face.  She paused wisely, to dismiss him with a compliment. &ldquo;You have managed splendidly,  M. Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I not deserve to be called Constantine, now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;that  is&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t bother&rdquo;; Lady Jim snatched away the hand he had captured. &ldquo;You  foreigners never learn sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you teaching it to me now?&rdquo; he asked in a metallic voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am&mdash;if you are clever enough to learn the lesson. See as little of me as  possible, and don&rsquo;t speak to me at all. When Jim&mdash;that is, when Garth&mdash;is buried,  we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  madame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. Consider your objections answered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will be answered,&rdquo; said Demetrius, very distinctly, &ldquo;before the altar of any  church you may select.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  remembrance of his capacity for being dangerous, and an anxious survey of his  narrowing eyes, made her deceptive. She diplomatically employed feminine  strategy, against which no man living can man&oelig;uvre. &ldquo;You doubt me,  Constantine,&rdquo; whispered the she-Judas, with trembling tenderness; &ldquo;will not  this&mdash;?&rdquo; She bent forward to drop a butterfly kiss on his forehead, and left him  dazed, in the seventh and most exalted Paradise of Fools.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo;  said Lady Jim, when shut up in her own room. There she read the communication  from her legally deceased husband. It narrated a story similar to that detailed  by Demetrius, but scarcely so concisely. Mr. Berring showed a disposition to ramble,  and his excursions ended on every occasion in a command to send half the  insurance money at once&mdash;the last two words being aggressively underlined. He  was in the best of health, on his way to Buenos Ayres; thence would travel to  Rosario&mdash;&ldquo;where that woman lives,&rdquo; commented Leah, tearing off the address and  carefully burning Jim&rsquo;s maunderings. &ldquo;Half the money&mdash;eh? Fifteen thousand  pounds! I think not, Mr. Berring. That captain, too, with his absurd charge,  and after all my trouble! I wonder Demetrius does not claim his share, also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  would have been cheaper had he done so, since she possessed the money and he  intended to possess her. But he would refuse a cheque and claim her hand, as  she reflected with impotent rage. What a pity she could not pay him off, and,  along with Jim and Strange, dismiss him into Limbo! She did not exactly know  what Limbo was, or where it was, save that once there these people could not  bother her. But with all the will in the world she could not get out of the  apparent cul-de-sac she had walked into.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius  wants <i>me</i>, and these other beasts my money,&rdquo; she raged inwardly. &ldquo;What a  mean advantage they all take! Pigs! As though I worked for nothing. What is to  be done? What&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  question was difficult to answer. Jim she could bamboozle with a small sum,  since he could not well betray her without laying himself open to a charge of  conspiracy. But the Russian and the skipper, both adventurers of the most  reckless type, would assuredly demand their wages. &ldquo;I shall have to pay that  captain,&rdquo; she decided regretfully; &ldquo;but Demetrius&mdash;insolent little creature!&mdash;he  shall go to Siberia, even if I have to kiss him again. Faugh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  she descended to tell the Duke how the sight of poor dear Jim&rsquo;s face had broken  her up entirely. Yet people said that Leah Kaimes had no sense of humour.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_22"></a>Chapter 22</b> </h2>
  <p>A  sociable undertaker, lacking the indispensable humour of his brethren, bitterly  complained that he rarely inquired after a friend&rsquo;s health without being  suspected of business motives. Ex-lieutenant Harry Askew found himself in a  similar predicament, since his desire to marry a widow precluded him from  offering sympathy. That he should personally, or by letter, deplore the  necessity of crape caps, would suggest waning affection; while a congratulatory  address laid him open to the charge&mdash;which this especial widow would certainly  make&mdash;of unseemly dancing on a newly-made grave. With laboured wisdom Askew  dropped between the horns of this dilemma. Paying no visit, writing no letter,  he compromised by leaving a card. In this dexterous avoidance of impalement  Lady Jim read the untold story of his perplexity, and smiled at the diplomatic  evasion.</p>
  <p>There  being an exception to every rule, the absence which should have made the Askew  heart grow fonder produced an opposite effect. Debarred from the temple of his  goddess, he began to ask himself why he worshipped, and thereby dug the grave  of illicit passion. That such was now permissible, and even praiseworthy,  considering its consolatory results, only made him a more ardent sexton. The  votaries of Eros can begarland themselves with roses, but Hymen&rsquo;s celebrants  wear chains of approved legal pattern. Was the cultus of the matrimonial god  worth such encumbrances? Thus Askew inquired of his own pampered self, and, not  knowing exactly what his selfishness desired, obtained but a doubtful response.  What else could he expect? Two-faced Janus is the true god of oracles.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim was witty, beautiful, chaste and brilliant&mdash;admirable qualities in a woman,  but in a wife, unless informed with love, rather unattractive. Askew doubted if  a composite mate of this glittering, unwarmed sort would satisfy his somewhat  exacting requirements. Accepting too readily the world&rsquo;s definition, what he  and it called love was actually selfishness, masquerading. He fancied, and with  much reason, that Leah, openly devoted to herself, would not show devotion to  him: that is, she being selfish, and he ditto, genuine happiness would not and  could not spring from this union of like and like. Moreover, he ignorantly  loved&mdash;in the world&rsquo;s sense&mdash;through his eyes, and with his lower nature; so it  was probable that the legal possession of irresponsive beauty would pall. To  limit a butterfly to one rose would bore the butterfly, and if the rose were  sentient, she also might feel weary. In this way, and from surface feelings,  argued Askew; but natural limitations prevented comprehension of the true  reason which disinclined him to prosecute his now legal and therefore  uninteresting wooing.</p>
  <p>He  was a better man than he knew, and this he would have known, had he paid heed  to the intimations of his higher self, when it occasionally overcame the lower.  When the god within overtopped the brute, he had beheld not so clearly the body  as the soul of Lola Fajardo, and had, for one swift moment, recognised that  conjunction with the spirit would best promote his happiness. A genuine  marriage must be spiritual, and it is the souls, whom God hath joined, which  man is forbidden to put asunder. Askew&rsquo;s introspective self knew that his  allotted wife on this physical plane was Lola, and that to her alone should  love be given. But the lust of the eye demanded Leah Kaimes&rsquo; beauty, and  feigned a spurious passion to gain possession. Absence from Lady Jim made him  aware that he did not actually love her, and a feeble struggle of the soul  bound in chains of selfishness revealed that he would do well to seek Lola once  more. Hence came the war between light and darkness, wherein the light so far  triumphed that the young man sought Curzon Street with more self-control than  was desirable in an admitted lover&mdash;one, be it known, of the worldly, material  type only. And may all such, for the well-being of the race, be anathema  maranatha!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  took you to be more original,&rdquo; said Leah, when he entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Original?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the extent of defying conventionality by calling before the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  grief&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Needed  consolation. You declined to console.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  come now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the eleventh and less necessary hour. Besides&mdash;&rdquo; She looked meaningly towards  the window-seat, where a flushed and smiling Katinka adored with timid  conversation and eloquent eyes a rather sour Demetrius. &ldquo;Will you have a cup of  tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; and they moved towards the bamboo table, whence she had risen to whisper  her greeting at the door.</p>
  <p>Advisedly  it would seem, since she cast a rapid and satisfied glance at the doctor&rsquo;s  lowering face. The set mouth, the narrowing eyes, hard as jade, betokened  jealous rebuke of Leah&rsquo;s condescending to meet the newcomer as royalty should  be met. Reading this index of a mind ill at ease, Lady Jim resumed her seat,  tacitly pleased. She had an end to gain, and this over-attention to Askew meant  the beginning of plots.</p>
  <p>It  was over a month since the supposed Jim Kaimes had been packed away in the  family vault, and his widow enjoyed the fruits of her labours. Dr. Demetrius,  looking upon the thirty thousand pounds as purchase money, wished to possess  the woman he had thus bought, and objected to other customers eying his  bargain. Hence his jealousy discerned a rival in Askew, and Lady Jim&mdash;aware of  this clear-sightedness&mdash;was content that he should so discern. She could neither  cajole nor reason Demetrius into trusting himself in Paris: but the desired  result might be brought about by utilising green-eyed jealousy. The unexpected  meeting of the rivals afforded her an eagerly seized chance of putting fire to  powder. The possible explosion, she hoped, would blow Demetrius into Siberian  wilds. Thus, playing with amorous fire, she hastened to heap on lavish fuel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am seeing a few friends now,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, ministering to her visitors&rsquo;  five-o&rsquo;clock wants. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Aksakoff and Dr. Demetrius&mdash;you know both, I  believe. Lady Richardson may look in later; also&mdash;&rdquo; Here she checked her tongue.  Aksakoff was due in half an hour; but it would not do to advise Demetrius of  that. The chances were that Katinka, aware of the intended visit, would carry  off the doctor early. Lady Jim devoutly wished that she would. Her drawing-room  was no stage for melodrama.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Also?&rdquo;  queried the newly arrived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Also  her son, Sir Billy. Have you met him? Of course! Monte Carlo! I remember. Isn&rsquo;t  he charming&mdash;a D&rsquo;Orsay of the cradle, Brummel in embryo? I have a mind to marry  him, as a pocket-husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I to wish you joy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  looked at him suddenly and understood. This man had risen from his knees, and  the chances were&mdash;going by experience&mdash;that he would stroll away. She did not  intend to permit that, since he was necessary to her schemes. Until Demetrius  was safely bestowed in Siberia he would have to be flattered and coerced and  ensnared into remaining. Then he could go and welcome. With freedom and money  she wanted no encumbrances. And it vexes a woman to have a man more earnest  than herself hanging round her skirts. However, this was not the time for plain  speaking, and she answered in this Thalian vein.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you must wish me joy&mdash;in a whisper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  smiles of Leah, the attitude of Askew, the sibilant indistinct voices of both,  goaded Demetrius. He all but interrupted the tea-table conference. But since  Lady Jim wished to be a princess&mdash;she had conveyed that idea clearly&mdash;and as  Katinka&rsquo;s aid was necessary to the recovering of his birthright, he dared not  to offend the girl. Jealous himself, Demetrius knew how easy it would be to  arouse the doubts of another&mdash;especially of a woman. He therefore remained  seated and waited developments, while Katinka chatted earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really wish you would be reconciled with my father,&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M.  Aksakoff is less willing for such a consummation than I, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  disagreed, hurriedly. &ldquo;You are wrong. My father is willing, but your enemies  are not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  my enemies are his enemies?&rdquo; he inquired dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly.  But one enemy&mdash;Paul Petrovitch&mdash;is my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Katinka  nodded and proceeded with explanations. &ldquo;He has, as you know, much influence  with the Czar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  would be used on your behalf, if&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, coloured, and cast down her  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I agreed to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thin  ice indeed, but Demetrius skated extremely well. &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he,  gravely, &ldquo;I cut myself off from my princely family, and surrendered wealth that  I might work in the cause of humanity. To assist a brother worker did I risk  exile, with the result you behold. Why, then, should I demand a sacrifice on  your part, to restore that which I personally do not regret?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Believe  me, my friend, it would mean no sacrifice. You hinted when last we met that you  were prepared to consider the proposition of resuming your rank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did&mdash;contingent on certain events happening,&rdquo; replied Demetrius, thinking that  if Lady Jim insisted upon being a princess of the drawing-rooms, he would be  forced to yield; &ldquo;but we can talk of this in a&mdash;well, in a few months. There is  no hurry!&rdquo; recalling the necessary period of mourning. &ldquo;No, there is no hurry!&rdquo;  He paused, then questioned suddenly, &ldquo;You love Paul Petrovitch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! Ah, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would, then, certainly be a sacrifice for you to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would never do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How,  then, could you persuade him to use his influence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a case of diamond cut diamond,&rdquo; explained Katinka, with the indifference of  a woman to all other honour, save that of the man she loves. &ldquo;Paul Petrovitch  wishes to marry me. If I agree, he will induce the Czar to reinstate you in  your possessions. When you have made your peace at St. Petersburg, I could  refuse to&mdash; Oh!&rdquo; she broke off with a confused laugh, &ldquo;do not look shocked, M.  Demetrius. I but trick him, as he is prepared to trick me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am far from being shocked,&rdquo; denied the liberal-minded doctor; &ldquo;to prevent being  bitten, we must bite. But the possible sacrifice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lies  in lending myself to such a trick. I make it for you&mdash;for you; yes, do you not  understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Only  that stupid animal, a sheep, could have refused comprehension.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not worthy,&rdquo; shuffled Demetrius, hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> think you are,&rdquo; she breathed tenderly. &ldquo;Will you not permit me to prove my  belief?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be honoured, if&mdash;in a few months&mdash;the time is scarcely ripe for me to move;  and you will understand. In short, when things are different&mdash;your noble offer&mdash;we  can discuss it later. Believe me&rdquo;&mdash;he thrilled her with a light touch&mdash;&ldquo;I  comprehend the nobility of your nature. Ah, my friend, do not press me to take  advantage of so glorious a sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  stammered Demetrius, his confusion being worse confounded, and wrapping up  refusal in evasive words, meaningless if sugared. Katinka sighed. Always she  pressed her mediatory offer, and always she declined acceptance. Angry that the  proffered gift should be flung back in her face, she suddenly felt a sense of  outrage at his persistent quibbling. This man must see that she loved him; yet  he trifled with her too obvious passion. There was Lady Jim, of course, in  spite of Lady Jim&rsquo;s readjustment of the situation at Monte Carlo. Yet, could  he, could any man, love this chilly, self-centered Englishwoman? No! As she  knew, Demetrius demanded love for love, and he certainly would not give all to  Lady Jim without receiving back in kind. Therefore he did not love the woman;  therefore he was heart-whole; and being so, why should he not yield to one who  was ready to suffer all for his sake? She could not understand; but this she  knew&mdash;that her self-respect rebelled.</p>
  <p>And  at the moment, that feeling, swallowing up all others, impelled her to walk  away, without even a backward glance. But she remained where she was, since her  adoration for this unresponsive god amounted to monomania. She hated to cringe,  to cast down her womanly dignity; but she was forced to do so. Passion proved  stronger than self-respect, than natural shame, than maiden pride. Enthralled  by Venus, as had been Helen of Troy, she was forced to grovel at the feet of  this&mdash;as she suspected&mdash;ignoble Paris. Would he never smile? Would he never  unbend? She could not say; she did not know. All she felt was pure unhappiness,  and she could have cursed the power which trammelled her in these nets of  undesired love. The gods were sporting, and Olympus shook with laughter at her  mortal sorrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come&mdash;when  you need me,&rdquo; said she, and rose.</p>
  <p>Demetrius  was self-seeking, yet possessed human feelings, and of these shame was  uppermost. The vein of divinity which streaked his clay made him acknowledge  that he was using hardly this flouted worshipper. Outwardly at least, and with  an impetuosity alien to his calculating character, he wished to make amends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me come also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need,&rdquo; she replied coldly, and crossed to the tea-table. &ldquo;You will excuse  my departure, Lady James. I have an engagement, Mr. Askew!&rdquo; She bowed, and then  went silently out of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you follow, doctor?&rdquo; asked Lady Jim, stepping with him to the scarcely closed  door.</p>
  <p>He  did not reply directly, but glanced across her shoulder towards the yawning  lieutenant. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he breathed significantly, and in his turn departed.</p>
  <p>Leah  wondered that the feelings which had evoked the word should not have kept him  watchful of her pretty play, and confessed herself puzzled by his abrupt  following of Katinka&rsquo;s trail. But having, as she knew, aroused his jealousy,  there was no need to consider meanings which would not affect her schemes.  Aksakoff was due, and before he appeared it was necessary to teach Askew the  r&ocirc;le of cat&rsquo;s-paw. He was to decoy Demetrius to Paris, but of course, she did  not mean him to be aware of his ignoble duties. She returned to rebuke him for  yawning and to propose a remedy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  you need is change of scene, if not of society. Now there is Paris, which you  probably know well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know it at all,&rdquo; he confessed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a neglected education! I must teach you Paris. Will you be ready for your first  lesson early next week?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim nodded laughingly. &ldquo;Which proves that &lsquo;our future&rsquo; is now split into &lsquo;your  future&rsquo; and &lsquo;my future.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am more in the dark than ever,&rdquo; said the amazed listener.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim curled her lip contemptuously. &ldquo;You men need so much explanation,&rdquo; said  she; then, meaningly, &ldquo;I can still retain you as a friend, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you&mdash;that is&mdash;on what grounds&mdash;? You do not comprehend!&rdquo; He stuttered, grew  red, and writhed over the fire on which she was grilling him, with much  enjoyment to herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but I do comprehend&mdash;very clearly, too. When did the change come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The&mdash;change?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  heart, if you wish me to enter into details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no change in me,&rdquo; he denied, still red and flurried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  no truth either, when you make such a statement!&rdquo; With a light laugh she  recalled his fierce wooing: &ldquo;you would not attempt to break my wrists now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very, very sorry, that I was rough with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, and cannot you see that such sorrow explains everything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to me,&rdquo; said Askew, desperately fervent.</p>
  <p>Leah  clapped her hands gaily. &ldquo;How very badly you do it! Do not go on the stage, I  beg of you. Well!&rdquo; she kissed her hand to him, &ldquo;adieu! I hope she will be  happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  will be happy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  other woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no&mdash;&rdquo; He caught her derisive eyes, and broke down with an uneasy laugh. &ldquo;I  suppose we have made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> have,&rdquo; she replied, promptly emphasising the pronoun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  His pride was wounded by the implied indifference. &ldquo;Then you knew it would come  to this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, because I did not choose that it should end otherwise. If I had chosen,  you would still have been&mdash;&rdquo; She glanced smilingly at her slim feet, then  handled the teapot with ostentatious liveliness. &ldquo;You can have some cold tea,  if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Askew had intended to drop her, the idea that she was dropping him&mdash;and very  readily, too&mdash;was wounding to his vanity. &ldquo;You never loved me,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I ever say that I did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  no; all the same&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  clasped her hands over her knee, and smiled indulgently at his mortified face. &ldquo;All  the same, you are unwise to explain, so we will change the subject, Mr. Askew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Not even Harry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  even Leah,&rdquo; she mocked. &ldquo;Still, you can call me Lady Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till  you change the name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not for that of Askew. Se&ntilde;orita Fajardo may think differently, when you  propose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know I shall?&rdquo; he asked sulkily, for every word she uttered fretted his  uneasy vanity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you are a shuttle-cock between two battledores. She sent you flying to me; I  shall speed you back to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man was almost too mortified to speak. &ldquo;What a light, vain fool you make  me out to be!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  You are merely a man in the hands of two women&mdash;clay in the hands of  accomplished potters. Now,&rdquo; she laid a caressing hand on his arm, &ldquo;promise me  to go back to Rosario at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  snapped Askew, wincing at the touch, and so gave her the very answer she  required.</p>
  <p>Her  motive in pelting him with hard sentences had been to arouse his vanity to  assert itself in aggressive contradiction; and for three reasons. Firstly, she  did not wish him to make an inconvenient third in Mr. Berring&rsquo;s wooing of the  Spanish lady, lest he should learn much that it was undesirable for him to  know. Secondly, she required him as her Parisian decoy-duck. And thirdly, it  was out of the question that he should dare to end the flirtation without her  leave. A reflection of these things led her to play skilfully on manly conceit,  with the aforesaid result. She was satisfied when he replied in the negative.  Askew also, since thereby, in his own estimation, he had vindicated virility,  and lacked the insight to see himself her puppet. Having gained her end, Lady  Jim apparently yielded to the lord-of-creation fiat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, come to Paris with me and Joan Tallentire. We go on Monday to the Hotel  Henri Trois, Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es. You can come on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite sure you don&rsquo;t. Perhaps Thursday will suit you better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you insist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not, unless on common sense, of which you possess so little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  you bully me!&rdquo; he cried, much vexed by this badgering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course; we always bully those we love&mdash;as friends, that is. Ah, here is M.  Aksakoff. What a surprise!&rdquo; She rose gracefully and sailed forward with  outstretched hand, &ldquo;So kind of you to come! You know Mr. Askew, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  diplomatist bowed, and seated himself near the table, whereat Askew, devoured  by a desire for further confidences, fumed, with depressed eyebrows and twisted  mouth. Lady Jim rang for fresh tea, listening meanwhile to Aksakoff discussing  the safe subject of the weather. Occasionally she glanced with amusement at her  victim, who by this time did not know his own mind, and certainly was incapable  of analysing his very complicated feelings. She bewildered him; he was not  master of himself in her presence, and alternately quailed and rebelled under  her spells. Flight from Circe was his wisest plan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  you?&rdquo; inquired Lady Jim, winningly, at the first movement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  what, please,&rdquo; he asked sulkily, settling down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  you go? I see you must. So sorry. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not want to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  be bored. Naturally; a widow is but dull company. Please do not leave us in the  dark. The button is on the right-hand side of the door. No; that is wrong!&rdquo; She  rose and switched on the light herself. &ldquo;That is better! Don&rsquo;t you think it is?  So good of you to come and cheer me!&rdquo; Then, dropping her voice, &ldquo;Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall cross on Wednesday,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;then we can resume our conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  pleasure you promise me!&rdquo; she retorted; and, closing the door, came back to the  waiting diplomatist, yawning daintily. &ldquo;Excuse me, M. Aksakoff: I have just  ended a bad quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  young man, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same. He wants to marry me. Shocking, isn&rsquo;t it, seeing that I scarcely know how  to pose as a widow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  natural on his part, surely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  nicely you pay compliments! By the way,&rdquo; sliding away from the subject, &ldquo;your  daughter was here. She has gone off somewhere with your friend, M. Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  frowned. &ldquo;It is kind of you to enlarge my circle of acquaintance, madame. I  presume you desire to speak of this gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;No; why should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  conversation at Monte Carlo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  we converse? So we did! Something about a sunset, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  diplomatist became unworthy of the name, through sheer irritation. &ldquo;Can we not  drop our masks, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew that we wore such things,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, lightly. &ldquo;I am sure I do  not. Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you sent for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  placed her elbows on the table, and the tips of her fingers together. &ldquo;I did,  to ask you for some letters to nice people in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  His face lighted up. &ldquo;You go to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  good friend, have I not said so? And the letters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be delighted&rdquo;; Aksakoff was now beginning to understand the necessity of  reading between the remarks. &ldquo;But are letters necessary? I hope to be in Paris  myself next week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  delightful! You will be able to amuse me. Do not look shocked. I assure you I  only wish to drown my grief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; assented Aksakoff, dryly; then added, with a significance she ignored:  &ldquo;Do you go alone to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear me, no. Miss Tallentire goes with me. A charming girl who is engaged to my  cousin, the Rev. Lionel Kaimes. We stay for a week at the Hotel Henri Trois,  Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es. Very quietly, you know, as I am still mourning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you are still in mourning,&rdquo; corrected her visitor, politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  You would not have me flaunting colours with poor dear Jim just dead. I want to  be cheered up, and I ask you and Mr. Askew to cheer me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  ah!&rdquo; Aksakoff wrinkled his brow. &ldquo;Mr. Askew goes to Paris, also?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  said something about it. Such a nuisance, seeing that he thinks&mdash;well, I told  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,  his thoughts are excusable. But M. Demetrius will be angered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Lady Jim, imperiously.</p>
  <p>Aksakoff&rsquo;s  patience was almost exhausted. &ldquo;We spoke at Monte Carlo,&rdquo; he reminded her. &ldquo;Surely  we understand one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly  you may. I am quite in the dark. Why should you couple my name with that of M.  Demetrius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Report  says that he loves you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;report!&rdquo;  She laughed, frankly amused. &ldquo;If you believe reports&mdash;&rdquo; Here a shrug and a  contemptuous laugh. &ldquo;Why, reports leave no one a shred of character. I quite  expect that my enemies&mdash;Mrs. Penworthy, for one&mdash;will say that Mr. Askew followed  me to Paris, for the purpose of marrying me at the British Embassy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  admired her profoundly. Without committing herself in any way or for a single  instance, she was placing in his hands the thread of the intrigue. Tacitly  acknowledging a diplomatic superior, he followed her lead. &ldquo;I trust that Mrs.  Penworthy, whom I have the honour to know, will not spread such a report,&rdquo; he  said gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but she will. A horrid woman, and scarcely respectable. She has called in Dr.  Demetrius as her medical attendant, and if&mdash;as you say&mdash;he admires me, she is  sure to make mischief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Aksakoff, reflectively, &ldquo;I am perfectly sure that if M. Demetrius heard  such gossip, he would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forbid  the banns,&rdquo; finished Leah, hastily and derisively. &ldquo;Pah! Do you think, knowing  his danger, he would trust himself in Paris? You are entirely wrong, M.  Aksakoff. Our mutual friend left me this very afternoon to follow your  daughter. Let him marry her&mdash;now do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Aksakoff, setting down his cup. &ldquo;Until he surrenders Katinka he is safer  in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, please do not let Mrs. Penworthy gossip him into crossing the  Channel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  your sake, I will not,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, dryly, and with every intention of  aiding and abetting Mrs. Penworthy. &ldquo;Will you give me another cup of tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  supplied him, and their conversation embraced a variety of subjects. No further  mention was made of Demetrius, or of Katinka, or of Askew, or even of Paris.  They quite understood one another, did these two clever people. When the  diplomatist departed he kissed Lady Jim&rsquo;s hand with courtly warmth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a charming woman, madame&mdash;a truly admirable woman; but&rdquo;&mdash;he straightened  himself, and looked into her eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I should not like to have you for an enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Lady Jim, artlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  compliment, madame&mdash;believe me, a very high compliment.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_23"></a>Chapter 23</b> </h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s lovely, lovely, lovely!&rdquo; sang Joan Tallentire, clapping her hands, and  whirling dervish-fashion around the room.</p>
  <p>A  radiant day or so in Paris had acted on her as sunshine acts on a flower, when  the petals expand, the colour deepens, and the perfume exhales. What observer,  casual or close, would have recognised in this eager-eyed and sparkling girl  the timid companion of Lady Canvey? For weeks she had associated with the  octogenarian; many months had she superintended the well-being of pauper hags  in Lambeth slums; and in the nursing of an ailing mother many precious years  had been expended. No wonder the fire of being burnt low; no marvel that for  long the eyes had lacked lustre and the cheeks colour. It was truly a case of  the old eating the young&mdash;stealing by contact, as it were, the vitality of youth  to reanimate waning life.</p>
  <p>Now  Lady Jim, playing fairy-godmother, had transformed this Cinderella, and the  grub of Lambeth soared a splendid dragon-fly. The spring, long delayed in its  coming, sang in her veins. With stimulating company, amidst novel surroundings,  and with tempting food for satisfying physical and moral appetites, came the  renascent period. Joan felt the burden of artificial years slip from her  shoulders; her quick blood, responding to its environments, rose to fever heat.  One cloud alone necked the sunshine of pleasure&rsquo;s dawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish Lionel was here,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  Pagan in the temple, a Jew in the church,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, shrugging. &ldquo;My dear,  Paris was invented for clergymen to rail at, not to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lionel  is not narrow-minded, Lady James. He approves of innocent amusements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Magic-lanterns  and penny readings. I fear Paris cannot supply those dissipations. You can  enjoy them under the honeymoon. Meanwhile Mr. Askew is less exacting and more  amusing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no one like Lionel&mdash;no one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  grant that, else would the world be innocent and dull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joan  pursed up her pretty lips and wrinkled a smooth brow. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that,&rdquo;  said she, meditatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  assented Leah, with a slow and somewhat envious look; &ldquo;you never will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could give you fifty reasons, but three will do. You are good and kind and  healthy-minded to excess&mdash;an angel, whose white wings flutter above the mire in  which we bipeds grovel. Quite the wife for our unsophisticated padre. St.  Sebastian and St. Cecilia&mdash;surely a marriage arranged in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Tallentire could not quite follow Leah&rsquo;s flights&mdash;not an infrequent occurrence.  Nevertheless, her intuition espied a compliment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you really mean that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I rarely mean anything. Let me be candid for once, since we converse in the  nursery, and say that I respect Lionel and I respect you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would rather have love,&rdquo; suggested the girl, timidly.</p>
  <p>Leah  touched her breast with eight finger-tips. &ldquo;From&mdash;&rdquo; Then in response to an  answering blush: &ldquo;My dear, I love no one but myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t believe that, or you would not have bothered to bring me to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merely  the desire for a new sensation. I assure you, as Lionel assured me, that all my  virtues spring from the Ego.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the Ego?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah  Kaimes in this instance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you are selfish,&rdquo; persisted Joan; &ldquo;if you really and truly were,  you would not say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but I should; that is my refined form of self-love. When I cry aloud my  imperfections, I receive some such compliment as you have paid. Then little god  Ego, sitting within my breast, sniffs up the incense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I am selfish, too. I like to be told nice things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to be given nice things, such as&mdash; Well, I expect Lionel, in spite of clerical  propriety, can explain better than I, and,&rdquo; added Lady Jim, mischievously, &ldquo;in  dumb show. My dear, your Ego is shaped like a good young padre; you are merged  in Lionel&mdash;swallowed up, as some one&rsquo;s rod swallowed up some one else&rsquo;s. I  suppose now&rdquo;&mdash;Leah nursed her knees with clasped hands&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose when you marry  St. Sebastian, you will be wildly happy in a dull country rectory, wearing  twice-turned gowns and last year&rsquo;s hats, and fussing after old women and grubby  village urchins, with your husband&rsquo;s sermons for relaxation when penny readings  pall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  happy,&rdquo; assented Joan, laughing at the over-coloured picture&mdash;&ldquo;with Lionel, of  course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I say: your Ego is his Ego. Dear!&rdquo; and Lady Jim dropped two impulsive kisses on  her companion&rsquo;s cheeks. Joan wondered at this uninvited display of affection,  and wondered still more when Leah turned away with a somewhat bitter laugh.  Perhaps, had she guessed the truth, her sympathy would have extended to this  woman, whom self-love isolated from humanity.</p>
  <p>It  pleased Leah to pose as this simple maid&rsquo;s providence, and on the whole she  sustained her deity excellently. Many a time did she check her free-spoken and  sharp tongue, lest Joan should feel hurt, or become precociously enlightened  about those sins which are dubbed idiosyncrasies in society. The amusements  provided were primitive and commonplace, as befitted the retirement of a newly  made widow and uncultured <i>d&eacute;butante</i> tastes. Drives in the Bois; visits  to the Louvre, to Versailles, to Notre Dame&mdash;on the tail of Hugo&rsquo;s romance&mdash;to  P&egrave;re Lachaise; many inspections of many delightful shops, one concert at least,  and the exploration of places which had to do with the picturesque history of  France filtered through Baedeker and Murray. Leah, unused to bread and milk,  thought the majority of these outings insipid; but Joan enjoyed them immensely,  and wondered at Continental dissipation. Her ignorance credited Leah with  loving, and invariably leading, this Cook&rsquo;s-tourist life when abroad; and that  lady laughed frequently, in the seclusion of her bedroom, at the idea of being  limited to nursery geography. Nevertheless, she did not undeceive her <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>;  the bloom, if she could prevent it, should not be brushed too early from this  peach. Which reticence and determination showed that Lady Jim had in her some  soul of that goodness which lives in things evil.</p>
  <p>Askew  duly arrived forty-eight hours later, so that his meeting with Leah might  appear unexpected. He called daily at the Hotel Henri Trois, and on a hint from  Lady Jim devoted attention to Joan the maid. Leah herself philandered in a  business-like way with M. Aksakoff, who, strange to say, followed Askew&rsquo;s trail  on important business. Lady Jim enjoyed many interesting conversations with  him, dealing with a quiet obliteration of Demetrius, if he should by any chance  walk into the trap. Joan and her cavalier, good surface readers, did not guess  at the elements working below, and so danced unsuspectingly on a volcano. The  fickle sailor was now lukewarm in his affections, and, as Leah purposed  dropping him gradually as soon as Demetrius was on his way to Siberia, she was  not ill pleased to watch red-hot passion cool to ashen-grey friendship.  Certainly it still remained to withhold him from seeking a foreign wife  over-seas, but she postponed schemes of prevention pending the disposal of  immediate troubles. Sometimes it occurred to her that Askew, a man of tow like  all sailors, might catch fire from contact with Joan; but, player as she was  with the hearts and brains of men, she cherished sufficient friendship for  Lionel to forgo a possible spoiling of his sober romance. There was little  danger that Miss Tallentire would exchange Church for Navy, but that the  juxtaposition of an artless maid and an inflammable bachelor might not breed  fickleness, Lady Jim wrote a letter. &ldquo;Why not come over and escort us back to  town?&rdquo; ran this epistle. &ldquo;Also, in Paris you will assuredly find material for a  sermon on the wickedness of that great city Nineveh,&mdash;I believe you parsons give  Western towns Eastern names, when you wish to abuse them&mdash;to avoid libel  actions, maybe.&rdquo; Then followed the mention of the rope to drag this clerical  lover across Channel. &ldquo;Do come, if only to see how Joan enjoys the society of  Mr. Askew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  expected happened on the fifth day of Lady Jim&rsquo;s sojourn in Paris, when,  shortly after noon, Demetrius, obviously disordered in dress and mind,  presented himself in the character of a bolt from the blue. Luckily, Askew was  translating to Joan the Luxor hieroglyphics in the vicinity of the Place de la  Concorde Obelisk, so that she had an hour to explain away the rumours which had  undoubtedly brought him over. When the sitting-room door clicked behind him&mdash;he  facing her with black looks&mdash;she drew a deep breath to brace for the fight, and  heard, what he did not, the snick of prison bolts shot home. So far, lured by  the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, jealousy, he had followed recklessly the dangerous path;  now it remained for her to conduct him to the precipice, over which she and  Aksakoff intended he should be thrown. A trifle of acting was necessary to  reassure the venturesome and perhaps suspicious traveller.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M.  Demetrius! Are you mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Constantine, then.&rdquo; He panted like a spent runner, and his face twisted in a  wry smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  dropped heavily into the nearest chair, and sent angry, inquiring glances into every  corner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  madame&rdquo;&mdash;he became sarcastic here&mdash;&ldquo;you know very well, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing, save that you are foolish to venture into Paris, where there is a  price on your head. M. Aksakoff is here, too; if he knew&mdash;if he guessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what matter? I have run greater risks for lesser reasons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  they must be strong ones in the present instance, to make you enter the bear&rsquo;s  den.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have one reason for my venture, madame&mdash;you; and another&mdash;Mr. Askew; not to speak  of a third&mdash;this marriage at your Embassy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can understand the first; the second may be explained by wholly unnecessary  jealousy; but the final one&mdash;this marriage you speak of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Between  yourself and Mr. Askew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim stared, then laughed good-humouredly. &ldquo;My dear Constantine, the idea is too  ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have the news on good authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  is the last authority you should believe. Mr. Askew is certainly here; but not,  I believe, in the character of a bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Penworthy&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Leah&rsquo;s scorn was worthy of the great Sarah. &ldquo;Mrs.&mdash;Penworthy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  told me that you came here; that Mr. Askew followed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forty-eight  hours later. Quite correct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that you intended to marry him at the British Embassy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!  I never knew that Mrs. Penworthy was imaginative.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not true!&rdquo; His eye probed her.</p>
  <p>She  did not flinch. &ldquo;You must be mad to think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not true?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  yourself have denied the truth of it twice. Mr. Askew at this moment dances  round Miss Tallentire&rsquo;s skirts. Would I permit that, if&mdash;? Oh, ridiculous! You  men swallow camels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  dupe rose to pace the room, and to pour out the anger of many brooding hours. &ldquo;It  is not true&mdash;ah, if I could only be sure of that. This woman&mdash;this Mrs. Penworthy&mdash;she  swore&mdash;swore&mdash;that you&mdash;that you&mdash;&rdquo; He choked, flung himself headlong to where she  smiled contemptuous, and seized her hands vehemently. &ldquo;Swear that it is false!&rdquo;  He dropped on his knees, almost tearful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do swear,&rdquo; rejoined Leah, disengaging her wrists. &ldquo;You can take Mr. Askew back  to London if you like. He is engaged to marry a lady in South America. There is  nothing between us&mdash;nothing. A flirtation, yes; banter and pretty smiles, idle  nothings and surface conversations.&rdquo; She smoothed back his hair and smiled  playfully. &ldquo;Am I marrying Othello?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are so beautiful,&rdquo; he muttered, wavering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  your eyes, no doubt. Mr. Askew prefers brunettes south of the Equator. But!&rdquo;&mdash;she  rose suddenly, as though she spurned him&mdash;but &ldquo;I prefer trust. I am angry&mdash;yes,  very angry. Oh, that you should doubt me&mdash;doubt me!&rdquo; Her tragic assertion was  admirable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not&mdash;I do not&rdquo;; and he still grovelled, catching at her dress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  presence here proves otherwise. Mr. Askew, indeed&mdash;a general lover, a volatile  sailor with a wife in every port for all I know. Can you not credit me with  more exclusive tastes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is handsome,&rdquo; muttered the still suspicious doctor, and rose, brushing his  knees mechanically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he? So you think I am to be won by looks, like a schoolmiss in her teens&rdquo;; she  looked at his sharp white face, and laughed cruelly. &ldquo;That I am engaged to you  should prove differently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  scarcely heeded her. &ldquo;Swear! Swear!&rdquo; and his eyes flamed.</p>
  <p>Leah,  calculating the effect, lost her temper. &ldquo;I shall in a moment,&rdquo; she cried  angrily. &ldquo;The most patient of women&mdash;of whom I am not one&mdash;have their limits. Why  do you allow jealousy to overrule common sense, when the position is so plain?  You fixed your price and fulfilled your part of the bargain. Am I, I ask you,  free to play you this trick of a hasty marriage, when you can expose me as  privy to a fraud? You see that I do not mince matters; I speak plainly, do I  not? You have all the winning cards, and can compel me to become your wife,  even if I dissented. Why, then, do you come here on a fool&rsquo;s errand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I love you so,&rdquo; he protested piteously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  love, being blind, makes you stumble into danger. I think you had better return  to England by the night train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I to leave you with Mr. Askew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  take him with you; I gave you permission before. And pray don&rsquo;t make scenes&mdash;I  dislike them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I am wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faugh!  If you doubt my word, perhaps you will take Mr. Askew&rsquo;s. He will be here soon  with Miss Tallentire. I decline to defend a position which requires no defence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  shrug ended this speech, and this, in conjunction with the anger brightening  her hard blue eyes, reduced him to profuse apologies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  indeed, my soul, you should not be enraged; that I should risk what I do risk  surely proves my love for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have proved it before by getting me the insurance money,&rdquo; she replied  impatiently; &ldquo;pray return at once. I can see you in Curzon Street when I return  on Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you promise to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  Leah heaved a sigh of exhaustion. &ldquo;How often do you wish me to say so? Even if  you remain Dr. Demetrius I am bound to become your wife, seeing that you hold  my reputation in your hands. Though of course,&rdquo; she added sweetly, &ldquo;I expect to  be Princess Constantine Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am willing&mdash;believe me, I am willing,&rdquo; he stuttered, now quite positive that  Mrs. Penworthy was a liar of the worst. &ldquo;Aksakoff&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you not say that he would aid me to regain my position, if I gave up Katinka?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  said something like that,&rdquo; she rejoined carelessly, and wondering why at this  moment he recalled the proposition. &ldquo;But I rather fancy his offer was merely to  leave you alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  looked silently at the carpet. Leah watched him with a doubtful look, on her  guard against complications. He looked up suddenly, and with rather a shamed  face. &ldquo;Certainly I could secure the services of Mademoiselle Aksakoff,&rdquo; he  murmured; &ldquo;but it seems cruel to use her influence and then to leave her. She  loves me. Ah, yes, she loves me very truly, and I&mdash;I treat her most badly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you think so, why not make amends and marry her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I love you, and at great risk I have bought you.&rdquo; He glared at her savagely. &ldquo;I  refuse to let you go; you are mine&mdash;mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never denied that,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, dryly; &ldquo;but I really cannot accompany you to  Siberia, and if you remain here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  He flung up an imperative hand. &ldquo;I shall see Aksakoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  sounded almost too good to be true, and Leah doubted. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Ah, my adored, I know how you feel for my safety&rdquo;; his voice took on a  caressing tone. &ldquo;But&mdash;it is nothing&rdquo;; he brushed away imaginary danger with a  rapid gesture. &ldquo;I shall see him. I shall plainly surrender Katinka, and then&mdash;then,  when he knows that we&mdash;you and I&mdash;are to marry, he will interest himself with the  Czar, on our&mdash;you mark me, my angel&mdash;on our behalf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a mad idea, impracticable. You dare not trust Aksakoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  bah! He will not arrest me publicly&mdash;he cannot. The scandal&mdash;the diplomatic storm&mdash;the  newspapers. No, no!&mdash;it is too absurd. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;this tender father  will repay me if I give his daughter to understand that we can never marry. He  desires her to be the Countess Paul Petrovitch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo;  said Lady Jim, rejoicing that the prisoner should thus lock himself in and  pitch the key out of the window. &ldquo;M. Aksakoff hinted something of this to me at  Monte Carlo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you can see&mdash;then you must understand,&rdquo; Demetrius gesticulated excitedly. &ldquo;Should  I surrender Mademoiselle&mdash;if I write a letter stating that I do not love, that  there can by no means be marriage&mdash;Aksakoff will help me, help you, help us  both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  Prince and Princess Demetrius. Yes, I see. And yet&mdash;the risk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no risk, publicly. And to snare me in secret&mdash;no. I am wary&mdash;oh, most wary; no  one can trap me. I swear to you, no one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius,&rdquo;  said Leah, as gravely as her delight would let her, &ldquo;you have done me a  service, which I repay with my hand in marriage. I do not love you as I ought  to, but love may come with the honeymoon. Still, even now, I have sufficient  affection for you to wish for your safety. Supposing&rdquo;&mdash;she laid an anxious hand  on his arm&mdash;&ldquo;supposing M. Aksakoff played you false, and you were trapped into  taking this Siberian journey&mdash;what would I do? Ah, no, my friend; believe me, it  is best to treat with this diplomatist in London. There you are safe; here&mdash;&rdquo;  She shook her head warningly.</p>
  <p>She  could not have made a speech, as she very well knew, more likely to provoke  Demetrius into remaining in his enemy's camp. He had accepted her disavowal of  Mrs. Penworthy's gossip, and yet, now that she asked him to go, urged him to  depart, even in Askew's company, his incurable suspicion made him hesitate. &ldquo;I  shall stay here, and see Aksakoff,&rdquo; he announced doggedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good,&rdquo; assented Lady Jim, accepting the fiat. &ldquo;He is coming to luncheon; you  can speak to him then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  to luncheon?&rdquo; asked the doctor, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; demanded Leah, up in arms on the instant. &ldquo;When we are married, your  enemies shall be my enemies; until then, my friends&mdash;of whom M. Aksakoff is  one&mdash;shall be my own.&rdquo; She became less imperative in her speech and looks,  dropping to a conversational tone. &ldquo;If you must know, Katinka asked her father  to call while he was in Paris. I could not do less than ask him to luncheon,  could I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  less clever woman would have made a less frivolous excuse, and, despite his  cleverness, Demetrius was gulled into accepting the false as genuinely true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will permit that I go to brush my clothes&mdash;to remove the dust of travel,&rdquo; he  asked politely. &ldquo;I return soon to meet M. Aksakoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half-past  two is the time,&rdquo; said Leah, with a careless glance at the gimcrack clock on  the mantelpiece; &ldquo;and perhaps it will be safer for you to meet him in my  presence at my table. He can scarcely arrest you there. One moment,&rdquo; as  Demetrius turned to go with a hasty bow. &ldquo;Mention our engagement to him privately.  I do not wish Miss Tallentire to know, as she would probably tell Lionel  Kaimes, and then the family&mdash;very rightly too&mdash;would be shocked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can always depend upon my discretion, madame,&rdquo; murmured the doctor, bowing over  her hand, and brusquely departed with the air of a conqueror.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim rubbed the kiss from her hand with vehemence, and flew to the window, where  she watched as eagerly as Sister Anne on Bluebeard&rsquo;s castle-top. The dapper  little figure emerged from the grand portal, and strutted victoriously down the  street. Leah nodded complacently. He was now in the toils, and, moreover, was  voluntarily binding himself in bonds. All the better; there could be no  compunction on her part in betraying such a heedless fool. If he would insist  upon letting his jealous heart govern his usually wise head, it was impolitic  to prevent him. With sudden thankfulness Lady Jim fished out of her pocket a  ruffled peacock&rsquo;s feather.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  luck holds&mdash;it holds,&rdquo; said she, kissing the fetish; &ldquo;you always bring me  luck&mdash;dear&mdash;dear,&rdquo; and she kissed again.</p>
  <p>This  religious ceremony ended, the fortunate lady looked again at the clock. It was  five minutes past one. Sitting down at a side-table she wrote a note, sealed  it, and delivered it to an obsequious waiter, with directions for its delivery  at the Russian Embassy. &ldquo;And lay two extra places at luncheon,&rdquo; she ordered;  &ldquo;two gentlemen are coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this way M. Aksakoff had the unexpected pleasure of partaking of Lady Jim&rsquo;s  hospitality.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_24"></a>Chapter 24</b> </h2>
  <p>Alone  and punctual, hungry for mid-day victuals, and eager to impart newly acquired  knowledge, Miss Tallentire returned from studying the Luxor Obelisk. Her coming  upon the hour and solitary state were noted, but a second-hand rendering of  hieroglyphic lore could be dispensed with by a lady entertaining a more  modern-minded guest. Aksakoff, with a notable sparkle in his eyes&mdash;begotten by  confidential conversation with his hostess&mdash;rose to welcome the fair  interrupter. International courtesies were exchanged, while Leah, glancing  impatiently at the clock, waited for their conclusion to slip in a question or  so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Mr. Askew? Why did he not bring you back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did, Lady James, as far as the lift. He is now writing a letter in the  smoking-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so will forget that I asked him to luncheon. Please remind him, dear; or,  better, tell the waiter to bring him up. M. Demetrius is coming also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Demetrius!&rdquo; Joan paused in her exit. &ldquo;I did not know that he was in Paris, Lady  James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  did I until an hour ago. Don&rsquo;t lose time, dear. Mr. Askew may go, and I  particularly wish him to stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim ushered the girl out hurriedly, and judiciously saw to the closing of the  door, before turning to meet Aksakoff&rsquo;s inquiring gaze. &ldquo;You approve of a full  table, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is safety in numbers,&rdquo; she assured him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  M. Demetrius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  resumed her seat with raised eyebrows. &ldquo;I fear you will think me dull, M.  Aksakoff, but I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  diplomatist bowed an apology. He had forgotten that even in private her comedy  was to be played by the book. The conversation of the next few minutes he  foresaw very plainly. She would play round the reason for their meeting,  without coming to grips, mysteriously conveying her meaning in speeches which  she did not mean. Only a politician of Aksakoff&rsquo;s subtlety would have  understood the unsaid from what she now proceeded to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Besides&rdquo;&mdash;she  was continuing the speech interrupted by his bow&mdash;&ldquo;you promised that no harm  should come to the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,  I renew that promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so; otherwise, I shall regret having consented to this meeting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  I understood that M. Demetrius desired it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is no reason why I should consent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly  not. Still, as a peacemaker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  put me into the Beatitudes, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not, if you achieve your object in reconciling enemies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  signing of the treaty depends upon you, M. Aksakoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Consider  it signed&mdash;on conditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  means that it is not signed. H&rsquo;m! M. Demetrius is anxious, even willing, to  renounce your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  dull red stained Aksakoff&rsquo;s opaque skin. &ldquo;How flattering to my fatherly pride!  There is, then&rdquo;&mdash;the hint was delicate&mdash;&ldquo;another?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim retorted in kind. &ldquo;So you said at Monte Carlo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle  Ninette? I believe I did. She lured him to Paris, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  should I know? He has never mentioned the creature&rsquo;s name to me, nor would he  dare to. He came, so he declares, to see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  matters connected with your recent loss, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is more than probable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  avoidance of the necessary topic exasperated him. Sharp words were on the tip  of his tongue, but wisdom withheld them. His accomplice was not the woman to  yield to dominance, and the merest hint of its exercise might, probably would,  engender wrath likely to jeopardise the almost achieved plot. Money or no money&mdash;Aksakoff  still ascribed mercenary reasons&mdash;her pride would never bend to the yoke of  advice. To be silent was his second thought, and silent he became. This, it  would seem, was wise, since she began to explain, Aksakoff paying out liberally  the necessary rope that she might hang herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M.  Demetrius is unwise to come here. I told him so; yes, I confess&mdash;remember my  warning&mdash;that I betrayed you. All the same&mdash;very foolishly, I think&mdash;he insisted  upon an immediate meeting, to recover his birthright, he says. Can you arrange  for the rehabilitation, of this exiled Esau?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  faint smile played round the diplomatist&rsquo;s thin lips, &ldquo;I can!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,  if M. Demetrius disabuses Katinka of her infatuation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is his affair and yours. No doubt&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke meaningly&mdash;&ldquo;you will wish to speak  to him privately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need, madame, seeing that you are in his confidence, and in mine. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;very  slowly&mdash;&ldquo;we can converse over our tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim&rsquo;s nerves jumped. &ldquo;Over tea,&rdquo; she echoed equally slowly&mdash;&ldquo;tea, after  luncheon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a Russian custom. M. Demetrius and I are Russians. Still, if the suggestion  appears presumptuous&rdquo;&mdash;he waved his hand with assumed deprecation&mdash;&ldquo;I withdraw it  and apologise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  She passed her tongue over dry, white lips, and answered faintly. &ldquo;You shall  have your&mdash;tea.&rdquo; Then, rising hurriedly, she made for the near window on an  obvious excuse. &ldquo;I do not see him coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  plainly as though Aksakoff had put it into words did Lady Jim know that he  intended to drug their victim. What would occur if this plotter succeeded she  did not know; what might occur she shivered to think of, and the thought made  her rash. &ldquo;The police!&rdquo; she murmured, turning from the window.</p>
  <p>M.  Aksakoff joined her, adjusting his pince-nez leisurely, and proceeded to look  up and down the street, two stories below. &ldquo;I do not see the police, madame.  But what a delightful day! I trust the night will be equally mild, since I  journey to Havre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  go to Havre&mdash;to-night?&rdquo; breathed Leah, not yet herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  a moderately late train. My cousin, Count Petrovitch, is there with his yacht.  We have to talk about his possible marriage with my daughter, before he leaves  to-morrow for Kronstadt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  sighed Lady Jim, very white. &ldquo;How&mdash;how&mdash;amusing!&rdquo; and after misusing the word,  she went back to her chair with geographical thoughts. Paris&mdash;Havre&mdash;Kronstadt&mdash;Siberia;  and Demetrius. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; sighed she again, with a trembling hand shielding her  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are ailing, madame,&rdquo; cried Aksakoff, hastening to her politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Starving!&rdquo;  replied Leah, with a wry smile. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  warning hissed through the chatter of Joan and Askew, who entered, almost  riotously happy. Their exuberant manners and frank speech brought a wholesome  breeze of cleansing honesty into the atmosphere of stale rascality. The bracing  wind blew Lady Jim out of dark chambers into the day-lit spaces of the  commonplace. With the protean capability of women she flashed as a sun from  passing storm-clouds, to shine on the honest and hungry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks  awfully for your invitation to luncheon,&rdquo; said Askew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  you forgot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I ever receive it?&rdquo; he asked doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  not my last remark imply the invitation. Remarkable!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  irrelevant sounded the last word that Aksakoff queried its reason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that a man should forget an invitation,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;but that a single meal  should escape his greedy memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make me out to be a gourmet,&rdquo; hinted the invited guest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not a gourmand? One speaks French in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  invariably, since we now converse in English,&rdquo; said Askew, dryly; and she  approved of the retort. Clearly he was rapidly recovering from the  green-sickness of crude passion.</p>
  <p>Meantime  Joan instructed Aksakoff in ancient history. &ldquo;The hieroglyphics on the Place de  la Concorde Obelisk describe the triumphs of Rameses II., who reigned over  Egypt in the fourteenth century before Christ. Mr. Askew knows him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;  smiled Lady Jim. &ldquo;Is he stopping in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Tallentire means to say that I know &lsquo;of him.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I said so. But my English <i>is</i> faulty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Askew will surely improve it. His knowledge of hieroglyphics&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  guide-book&rsquo;s knowledge, Lady James,&rdquo; corrected Askew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!  Information while you wait&mdash;Murray and Baedeker&rsquo;s extract of history&mdash;archeological  tabloids.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  felicitous phrases!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarcasm!  That surely means&mdash;convalescence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been ill then, monsieur&rdquo;; Aksakoff addressed the colouring young  gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heart-disease,&rdquo;  flashed Lady Jim, gaily&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, M. Demetrius!&rdquo;&mdash;and so did her ex-lover out of a  retort. &ldquo;You know Miss Tallentire&mdash;Mr. Askew; they were at Firmingham, if you  remember. And M. Aksakoff, who will doubtless recall Dr. Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  Prince Constantine Demetrius, madame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  place me too high,&rdquo; said the doctor, bowing stiffly. &ldquo;Out of Russia I am but a  simple physician.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a remarkably clever one, according to this lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  flatters. I failed, where I should have succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  murmured a sharp aside, reproving the professional humility which necessitated  an allusion to her loss. A bowing waiter entered before the doctor&rsquo;s apologetic  shrug could be followed by words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  is served,&rdquo; said the waiter, and the lift lowered five hungry people to the  dining-room.</p>
  <p>Says  a disciple of Brillat-Savarin, with solemn truth and the infallible judgment of  experience, &ldquo;Breakfast in Scotland, lunch in America, and dine in Paris.&rdquo;  Circumstances prevented Lady Jim from dispensing Boston hospitality, but having  supervised the ideas of the Henri-Trois chef, she placed a very dainty and  tempting repast before a quartette almost too hungry to be critical. Nor was  wanting wine, chosen with masculine discretion, to loosen rusty tongues and  release fair thoughts embedded in slow brains. But this latter adjective must  be taken&mdash;very appropriately at table&mdash;with a grain of salt. None of those who  ate and drank were dull; three of them, indeed, were much too clever, and the  remaining two made up in sparkle what they lacked in depth. Many good things  were eaten and said during that merry meal, and the corner near the large  window bubbled with laughter. Leah, watching stealthily the courtesy of  Aksakoff and his fellow-countryman, shivered internally at the irony of  circumstances. Paris&mdash;Havre&mdash;Kronstadt&mdash;Siberia: the four names repeated  themselves dolorously in her brain like a street cry. What wonder, then, that  the spectacle of this tragic comedy made her laugh and babble, and smile and  nod, and play to perfection the r&ocirc;le of an attentive hostess. She was quite  glad that what would prove in all probability to be her victim&rsquo;s last civilised  meal was appetising. Aksakoff professed himself charmed with her esprit. Here,  thought he, were the makings of an ideal conspirator, and he regretted her  nationality. The Anglo-Saxon nature is so alien to working mole-fashion. Yet,  had he only known the truth, Lady Jim had already proved her willingness to  conspire, if not against a throne, at least for the cheating of a limited  company.</p>
  <p>The  luncheon was thus pleasant, and not less so the digestive hour, when the  repleted guests assembled in the sitting-room. Anxious to afford the diplomatist  every assistance, Lady Jim gathered the young people under her wing near the  piano at the far end of the apartment. Joan, who had more of a soul than a  memory for music, played scraps, chatting to right and left while her nimble  fingers ran from Mozart to Chopin and attempted what their owner remembered of  Wagner&rsquo;s creations. Thus the Muscovites, smoking by special permission, were  enabled to exchange views in comparative privacy. To assure complete secrecy,  and with the hole-and-corner instinct of the Slav, they talked Russian with a  bluntness strangely opposed to Lady Jim&rsquo;s elusive suggestiveness. The situation&mdash;to  Demetrius, at least&mdash;did not admit of sugared phrases or ambiguous explanations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  yonder&rdquo;&mdash;he nodded towards Leah&mdash;&ldquo;told you why I desired this interview.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;&mdash;Aksakoff  handled his cigarette daintily&mdash;&ldquo;but an explanation from you is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  nodded brusquely. &ldquo;I must mention the name of your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  doubt, since her welfare is the main object of our meeting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle  Aksakoff,&rdquo; said Demetrius, coldly, &ldquo;has done me the honour to admire me. But  that my affections are already engaged, I should certainly reciprocate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  allude to Mademoiselle Ninette?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  look of surprise flitted across the other&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;The actress? Why should you  think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rumour  credits you with being her lover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  as usual, rumour is wrong. Mademoiselle Ninette was assuredly my patient, but I  received my fees in gold, not in kisses. As poor Dr. Demetrius I cannot live  on love, Ivan Aksakoff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prince  Constantine will be able to do so with the lady he mentions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mentioned no lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  pardon!&rdquo; Aksakoff was foiled. &ldquo;You accept my apology?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  is needed. I intended to tell you the name of the lady, Ivan Aksakoff; it is madame  yonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  uplifted eyebrows the diplomatist glanced in the direction of Leah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard something in London clubs of your admiration for her, Constantine  Demetrius; even before her husband died it was said that you had laid yourself  at her feet. What a pity you cannot marry her! An ideal match, my friend; quite  ideal, and so useful in promoting a social understanding between Holy Russia  and these islanders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  marry in a year,&rdquo; announced the doctor, calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  no; but pardon me, it is impossible!&rdquo; Aksakoff, really and truly startled,  dropped his cigarette. That haughty Lady James Kaimes should&mdash; &ldquo;It is quite  impossible,&rdquo; said he, staring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refer you to the lady herself,&rdquo; insisted Demetrius.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A-a-a-h!&rdquo;  droned the other, picking up his cigarette to place it in the ash-tray, and  lighting another; &ldquo;y-e-s!&rdquo; He stared again at his companion, then stole a  glance at Leah. Apparently her desire to assist Muscovite politics was not  entirely a question of pounds, shillings, and pence. She was less sordid and  more subtle than he had guessed.</p>
  <p>Demetrius,  giving him no time to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, went on with his  explanation. &ldquo;You will, therefore, understand that my marriage with your  daughter is out of the question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; assented Aksakoff, absently, and wondering why Lady Jim engaged  herself to this exile. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added more briskly, &ldquo;I trust you will  permit me to announce this engagement to my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  It will show her that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you are unworthy of her hand,&rdquo; ended Aksakoff, sharply, for here the father  overleaped the diplomatist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, Ivan Aksakoff, and I hope soon to congratulate the Countess Petrovitch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are too good, Constantine Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In return for thus arranging your  domestic affairs,&rdquo; continued the doctor, unmoved by the sarcasm, &ldquo;will you gain  my pardon from the Czar? Can you gain it?&rdquo; he asked with emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can and will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  title, my money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both  shall be restored. And of course,&rdquo; added Aksakoff, with a keen glance, &ldquo;you  will no longer work in what you term the sacred cause of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  waved his hand gloomily. &ldquo;Dreams of youth&mdash;desires for the impossible. I am  aware,&rdquo; he added bitterly, &ldquo;that individuality in a bureaucratic administration  is looked upon as a crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you wonder at it? If one wheel refuses to fit in with another, the machine will  not work. We are all parts of a mighty engine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  crushes the poor and the weak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  matter, since you, Constantine Demetrius, are neither poor nor weak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  sympathy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  most dangerous word, current only in that Utopia you dreamed of. It is not in  the Russian dictionary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Demetrius  turned on the scoffer a glittering eye. &ldquo;It will be, some day,&rdquo; said he,  slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  friend&rdquo;&mdash;Aksakoff shook the ash from his cigarette&mdash;&ldquo;if you propose to edit  dictionaries you must remain Dr. Demetrius&mdash;in exile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gladly would,&rdquo; rejoined the other, heartily; &ldquo;only&mdash;&rdquo; His voice died away, as he  looked towards Lady Jim.</p>
  <p>The  diplomatist laughed. &ldquo;There is always a woman. Ah, these dear ladies, how  practical they are! In their hands we are wax, which they mould after the honey  is squeezed out&rdquo;; he laughed again, then resumed, business-like: &ldquo;You will  write to my daughter and place the truth of this engagement beyond question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,  Ivan Aksakoff, when I am in London. And needless to say, I shall always  profoundly respect Mademoiselle your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean the Countess Petrovitch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you can so far bend her to your ambition,&rdquo; retorted Demetrius. &ldquo;You promise,  then, to right me with the Czar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  nodded and laughed cynically. &ldquo;You are already Prince Constantine Demetrius,  rich, honoured, and&mdash;unsympathetic.&rdquo; The doctor winced at the last word, but  shook hands on the agreement. Lady Jim glanced across the room with Judas and  his kiss in her mind. That the cap fitted her, also, she did not consider for  the moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coffee!  Coffee!&rdquo; cried the pianist, rising. &ldquo;Just what I want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is tea on this occasion,&rdquo; replied Leah, and went over to take charge of the  tray brought in by a smiling waiter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tea?&rdquo;  Joan echoed the word in an amazed voice, and tripped like a fairy towards a  comfortable low chair. &ldquo;Who ever heard of tea in the middle of the day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Australian  colonists in the back blocks,&rdquo; explained Askew, sauntering to assist in arranging  a harlequin set of cups. &ldquo;They drink tea at all hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Russia, also,&rdquo; remarked Lady Jim, jingling the saucers. &ldquo;This is a concession  to the prejudices of our foreign guests&rdquo;; and she laughed amiably at the  Muscovites.</p>
  <p>Demetrius  bowed and smiled, twisting his waxed moustache with admiring glances at Leah&rsquo;s  red hair. He was far from suspecting a snare, and that Aksakoff should have a  finger and thumb in his waistcoat-pocket did not seem remarkable. But Lady Jim&mdash;nervously  on the alert&mdash;guessed that the diplomatist was fiddling with something of a  narcotic nature. Also, his significant glance at her, at the teacups, at  Demetrius, hinted at her duty. She fulfilled it with a spasm of fear, well  masked by frivolity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joan,  I have dropped my handkerchief&mdash;near the piano, I think. Will you please look  for it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Tallentire rose, to be anticipated, as Leah guessed she would be, by two  attentive gentlemen. &ldquo;Allow me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Permit me, mademoiselle!&rdquo; and with Askew,  Demetrius crossed for the search, while Lady Jim ran on lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be on the floor near you, Joan. What a nuisance! How stupid of me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  Joan looked on the carpet&mdash;Leah also, the latter straining her ears to hear the  almost inaudible. The faint tinkle of a pellet dropped into a cup sounded to her  guilty soul like a clap of thunder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  it is,&rdquo; cried Joan, fishing under the table, and picking up what Lady Jim had  purposely dropped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks  awfully, dear. Mr. Askew, M. Demetrius, do not trouble. Give me the teapot,  Joan. Ah!&rdquo; she babbled on, while filling the cups&mdash;&ldquo; What a pity we have not  glasses, so that you could drink the tea in your own fashion, M. Demetrius. M.  Aksakoff, we did so enjoy the novelty at your Monte Carlo villa. Still, here is  a lemon; slice it, Joan, dear. Do sit down, doctor. M. Aksakoff, you can be  waiter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allow  me,&rdquo; cried Askew, half rising.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  where you are,&rdquo; said Leah, sharply; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll upset the table. M. Aksakoff!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  pleasure, madame&rdquo;; and he obliged her with stiff cordiality.</p>
  <p>Leah  wiped her lips, which were dry, and stole a stealthy glance at the cup which he  handed to the doctor. It was of a deep blue colour. &ldquo;Augh!&rdquo; she breathed, as he  set it to his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are wearied with your duties, madame,&rdquo; conjectured Aksakoff, sipping with  gusto; &ldquo;and I, alas, can relieve you only by acting as waiter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a guest now,&rdquo; she rejoined, with a nervous laugh; &ldquo;is the tea to your  liking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  delightful tea,&rdquo; said Demetrius, courteously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  compliment the decoction too highly. Tea on the Continent is like rain in the  Sahara. I except Russia, of course,&rdquo; she ended, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will find us English in many ways, when you visit Moscow, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  looked inquisitively at Aksakoff, who spoke, guessing that he was in possession  of the truth, and wondering what he thought of the engagement. The man&rsquo;s face  betrayed nothing, however, and her gaze travelled to Demetrius. He was sitting  perfectly still, and his eyes looked dull, as though the fire of life was  dwindling within. Meeting her smile, he roused himself with a jerk and an  apology.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel sleepy&mdash;the heat, no doubt,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say that I feel scorching,&rdquo; said Askew, glancing through the window at a  grey sky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are used to the tropics; M. Demetrius is not,&rdquo; observed Aksakoff.</p>
  <p>Joan  laughed. &ldquo;You remind me of a horrid story my brother told me. An old  Anglo-Indian was being cremated at Woking, and said that it was the first time  he had felt warm in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  horrid story indeed,&rdquo; murmured Lady Jim, with her eyes on the expressionless  face of Demetrius. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t tell it, dear.&rdquo; Then she rose hurriedly: &ldquo;Are  you quite well, M. Demetrius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes&mdash;quite&rdquo;; the doctor&rsquo;s voice droned into an inarticulate mumble and his head  fell forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  Mr. Askew&mdash;M. Aksakoff&mdash;what it the matter? His eyes are closed; his breathing&mdash;just  listen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kind  of fit, perhaps,&rdquo; said Askew, rising to shake Demetrius, and so extorted a cry  from the kind-hearted hostess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;the  man is ill! Oh, how dreadful! Loosen his collar&mdash;open the window. I wonder if he  needs a doctor,&rdquo; and she stepped to the electric button of the bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  might be one in the hotel,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, as Joan and Askew obeyed her  directions. And from the tone of his voice she knew that there was one in the  hotel. &ldquo;It really seems to be a kind of fit,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, looking at the now  unconscious man. &ldquo;Yet he appeared to be quite well a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  did not hear. She was already at the door issuing hurried instructions to a  waiter, whose smile had vanished. When she came back the two men had placed  Demetrius on the sofa, where he lay breathing heavily, his face white and his  lips purple; not a pleasant sight by any means, as Askew thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  not you ladies better retire?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; they cried in one breath. &ldquo;We must help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the doctor can do that&mdash;if there is one,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, observing his handiwork  on the sofa with a critical eye.</p>
  <p>Then,  at the tail of a triple rap, entered the fat proprietor of the Henri Trois,  scared in looks and importantly fussy in manner. Behind him glided a  spick-and-span man, not unlike Demetrius, and unmistakably Tartar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Helfmann happened to be luncheoning,&rdquo; explained M. Gravier, &ldquo;fortunately. What  is the matter, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helfmann  soon explained that. He felt the pulse of the patient, laid a gentle hand on a  weakly-beating heart, and turned up the purple eyelids. Askew and Aksakoff  stood aside with the proprietor. Lady Jim and Joan bent forward with pale faces  and clasped hands, anxious for the verdict.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  kind of fit,&rdquo; explained the doctor; &ldquo;he will be insensible for two&mdash;three hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  my hotel? Ach!&mdash;the scandal!&rdquo; cried Gravier, spreading his fat hands in dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it really a fit?&rdquo; asked Lady Jim, paying no attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame&rdquo;&mdash;the  doctor faced her coldly&mdash;&ldquo;to speak technically would not enlighten you. I can  bring this gentleman back to his senses; but I think&mdash;with your permission,&rdquo;  added he, bowing, &ldquo;that if you will permit me to take him in a cab to a chemist&rsquo;s  shop where I can procure the drug I require, it will save time. And in this  case&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced calmly at the unconscious man&mdash;&ldquo;time means life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;  said Askew. &ldquo;Take him away at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you think it is better,&rdquo; murmured Lady Jim, not daring to meet the victorious  eye of the diplomatist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; rejoined Askew, brusquely. &ldquo;You and Miss Tallentire can do nothing,  and the sight is not a pleasant one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joan&rdquo;;  Lady Jim drew the girl away, and passed with her into the bedroom adjoining.  There behind a closed door they listened to the sound of a body being removed.  The scraping of feet, the heavy breathing of ladened men, the bumping and  humping of something soft (horrible suggestion)&mdash;they could hear these  intimations of removal very plainly. Leah sat on the bed with tightly clasped  hands between slack knees. &ldquo;Augh!&rdquo; said Leah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is all right, Lady James,&rdquo; said Joan, petting her. &ldquo;Poor M. Demetrius will soon  be all right. I wonder what made him ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder,&rdquo; echoed Lady Jim, and wondered very truly. She could not understand  what drug Aksakoff had used to reduce Demetrius so rapidly to unconsciousness.  And not another word was spoken for ten minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have driven away in a fiacre,&rdquo; announced Miss Tallentire, from the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  have driven?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doctor and M. Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  M. Aksakoff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  her question could be answered a sharp knock came to the door, and Aksakoff  presented himself when it was opened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  is well, dear ladies,&rdquo; said he, blandly. &ldquo;Dr. Helfmann has gone with our sick  friend. Mr. Askew follows to see that all is well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Askew  follows?&rdquo; said Lady Jim, with a sharp glance; &ldquo;but why&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  diplomatist still smiled. &ldquo;He has a kind heart, that young Mr. Askew, and so&mdash;&rdquo;  he shrugged, then bowed to Joan. &ldquo;I compliment you, mademoiselle, on your  courage. You also, madame. And now, all being well, I must take my leave&rdquo;; he  kissed Lady Jim&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I shall see you again in London, as to-night I journey  to Havre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went out, and Leah again heard four names as though a ghostly porter was  calling them at a ghostly junction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paris,  Havre, Kronstadt, Siberia,&rdquo; said the ghostly porter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;  said Lady Jim.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_25"></a>Chapter 25</b> </h2>
  <p>Joan  was less surprised than a better informed lady when no word of the sick man&rsquo;s  progress came to hand. Aksakoff was presumably at Havre, and Askew, having  missed the fiacre, and called uselessly at a chemist&rsquo;s shop indicated by  Helfmann, clamoured for information. Unacquainted with the address of  Demetrius, no information could be given by Lady Jim; but she proffered a  suggestion to keep the budding philanthropist quiet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  might be in an hospital.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  might! I&rsquo;ll go the round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo;  she assented cordially, and quite easy in her mind about this  needle-in-a-haystack search.</p>
  <p>So  Askew, wisely acting immediately on an impulse that could not last, set forth  on his quest, only to drift across the path of an old shipmate. The meeting led  to cocktails at the American Bar, and the consumption of these involved the  calling-up of a past, which made the ex-navy man long to nose the out-trail  once more. That his friend who did business in great waters should know of a  clean-built schooner-yacht for sale at a ridiculously low price was natural.  And equally natural was Askew&rsquo;s determination to cross the Channel that very  day, lest the desirable vessel should be snapped up. Thus it came about that he  presented himself to Leah, prior to an immediate departure, without recurring  to the quest. Lady Jim, however, could not forbear a taunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your philanthropic search?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
  <p>Askew  coloured, laughed, and shrugged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius  is no kith or kin of mine,&rdquo; was his excuse, &ldquo;and wouldn&rsquo;t do as much for me, I  doubt. &lsquo;Sides, he&rsquo;s probably on his legs by now, and will come skipping along  to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he does I shall advise him of your charity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; urged the youth, coolly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be giving me a testimonial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  laughed good-humouredly. &ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; and she shook hands. &ldquo;Thanks for  your company. Joan has enjoyed it immensely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  with a sigh and a twinkle, &ldquo;think what I have lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  you, man of lightning moods. Philanthropy, love&mdash;ten minutes of each. Shall I  see you in London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;yes.  But if I can annex this schooner at a fair price, I&rsquo;m thinking of a cruise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Pacific waters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  grew red and uneasy, shifting from one foot to the other. &ldquo;I might.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means, you will. H&rsquo;m! The first case I ever knew of a man being off with the  new love and on with the old. But&rdquo;&mdash;she held up a finger&mdash;&ldquo;I claim a visit before  you go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  seized her hand. &ldquo;I promise!&rdquo; Then, coaxingly: &ldquo;We are friends!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Parting  friends, and I have already shaken hands with you twice. <i>Au revoir</i>, till  Curzon Street,&rdquo; and nodding him God-speed, she retired to consider  possibilities of preventing a speedy departure. Poor woman! No sooner had she  cleared away one obstacle than another bulked in the path. And these,  unfortunately, she could not leap over or go round. They had to be removed by  toilsome pick-and-shovel work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a mercy Demetrius is disposed of!&rdquo; said Lady Jim, to her mirror. &ldquo;Two new  wrinkles. I shan&rsquo;t give that silly boy the chance of adding a third.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  the morning of departure from Paris Leah received a letter from Demetrius,  which she showed to Joan, almost as soon as the train steamed out of the Gard  du Nord. A week of talk in Paris, and five years&rsquo; study in England, had  instructed Miss Tallentire insufficiently in the French tongue; therefore did  she wilt away at the sight of the epistle. Lady Jim translated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is still ill in some hotel&rdquo;&mdash;she was careful not to give the address&mdash;&ldquo;but  better, much better. Later he proposes to go to Russia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought he was an exile,&rdquo; said Joan, doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is. I think the folly of risking his liberty in St. Petersburg is apparent. But  he hopes to cajole the Czar into granting his pardon. M&rsquo;m!&rdquo; Leah packed away  the letter in her dressing-bag. &ldquo;I daresay we shall hear of him next in  Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joan  opened a pair of horrified eyes. &ldquo;Lady James!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s a charming place, they say, and not at all so disagreeable as people make  out. The climate is much more delightful than our own, dear, and the society  really intellectual. The Russians send all their clever people there, you know.  I am sure Dr. Demetrius will be very comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exile  to Siberia! It sounds horrible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;sounds,  but isn&rsquo;t. You have been reading Tolstoy and seeing melodramas, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought Dr. Demetrius loved you,&rdquo; said Joan, suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he did; the man was a perfect nuisance. But, you see, I did not love him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! Of course you would not. I never meant that. As poor dear Lord James&rsquo;s wife  you could not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  as poor dear Lord James&rsquo;s widow, I can, only I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Tallentire was still confused. &ldquo;You must think me dreadfully rude&mdash;oh,  dreadfully,&rdquo; she murmured, regretting an unintentional insinuation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you dreadfully innocent, and dreadfully sweet,&rdquo; said Leah, kissing the  flushed face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking like that horrid Mulrady girl. Where do these  Americans pick up their adjectives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even  while chatting, and while the train tore through a bleak landscape almost  blotted out with rain, Leah wondered who had written the letter. Not Demetrius,  certainly, although the calligraphy would have caused an expert to commit  perjury. Aksakoff was more clever with tongue than pen, so Leah fell back on  Helfmann as a possible forger. Assuredly she did not believe that he was a medical  man, and his fortunate presence at the needed hour argued a carefully laid  plot. The fiacre probably drove to St. Lazare, and thence Helfmann had no doubt  personally conducted his patient to Havre to be shipped on board the Petrovitch  yacht. Now the boat was kicking her way through the grey northern seas, and  Demetrius, in possession of his senses, was looking forward to a forced passage  across the Urals. An unpleasant journey at this time of the year, but needful  for men who wanted more than was good for them. And, thank God, this particular  man was out of her life for ever. While offering up the hasty prayer Lady Jim  touched the peacock&rsquo;s feather, tucked away in her pocket, and felt that life  really was worth living, when one knew how to dispose of disagreeable people.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  the prayer addressed to a Deity other than the fetish made the domestic god  sulky, but he, or it, certainly did not expedite Leah&rsquo;s journey to Curzon  Street. For two weary days wind and rain, stormy waves and over-cautious officials,  detained the travellers in Calais. A hurricane that would have done credit to  the South Seas made the Channel impassible, and the waves that Britannia is  supposed to rule rebelled furiously against her white cliffs. Leah,  inconceivably bored, watched the gusty hours through streaming panes, and  wondered if the gale extended to the Mediterranean. If so, the ducal yacht with  Frith and his father on board must be having a pitch-and-toss time of the  worst. The Duke was no hardened mariner, and uncomfortable motions prolonged to  excess might make a man of his age so ill that he would&mdash; Here Leah&rsquo;s vivid  imagination produced a shudder. She did not wish the kindly old Duke to die of  exhaustion; not that she cared overmuch for him, but Frith succeeding to unlimited  money-bags would be less easy to manage in the important matter of occasional  cheques. The insurance money would not last for ever with one of her tastes,  and after all&mdash;since this greedy Captain Strange would insist upon his dues&mdash;she  had only twenty-nine thousand pounds. Then Jim would want ready money, and his  demands&mdash;she knew him of old&mdash;would probably be shameless. Of course, seeing  that, on the face of it, he was involved deeper than she was in a shady  conspiracy, he could be told to mind his own business and marry Se&ntilde;orita  Fajardo, if desirous of being kept like a gentleman. But to avoid unnecessary  trouble it was probable that she would have to send him a trifle. How dreadful  it was to think that a single shilling of that hardly-earned money should slip  through her fingers; but the harpies had to be appeased or driven away. She  could not achieve the last, therefore her purse-strings would have to be  unloosened. Already the pockets of Strange gaped hungrily, and it was her hard  fate to fill them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  absurd!&rdquo; grumbled Lady Jim, as the wind whimpered and the rain lashed the  glass, &ldquo;in the middle ages one could have hired a nice bravo to put him out of  the way, and there would not have been even funeral expenses. I must pay, I  suppose, but I&rsquo;ll see if the beast will not take the money by instalments.  There is always the chance that he might be drowned between payments&mdash;and I hope  he will be,&rdquo; she ended devoutly.</p>
  <p>In  this amiable frame of mind she arrived at Curzon Street, after sending Joan,  brimful of Continental experiences, to the less fashionable district of  Lambeth. The house looked cosy, the servants were attentive, the insurance  money swelled her bank account, and, best of all, Demetrius was posting towards  Siberia. On the whole things were tolerable&mdash;it was not Leah&rsquo;s custom to indulge  in superlatives&mdash;so she decided to remain for a week or two in London, prior to  being bored at Firmingham, where the Marchioness awaited the home-coming of the  yachting party. After her late efforts in the cause of politics Lady Jim felt  that she really could not stand Hilda&rsquo;s artificial childishness without an  intermezzo of amusement.</p>
  <p>But  fun of any sort was hard to find, since her widowhood and the emptiness of town  precluded indulgence. Piccadilly and the Park, St. James&rsquo;s Street and Pall  Mall, were as barren of pleasure and a fashionable population as that Siberia  towards which Demetrius unwillingly journeyed. Even Lady Canvey had moved out  of the Early Victorian room into more modern surroundings at Nice. Askew certainly  paid his promised visit, but he proved to be dull, thinking more of the yacht  than the woman. The technical terms he employed in describing his purchase made  Lady Jim yawn, and she decided that, like all men, he was unutterably selfish.  However, she was sufficiently kind-hearted&mdash;and diplomatic&mdash;to show him the  pseudo letter, and translate it for his benefit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Told  you so,&rdquo; said he, when in possession of misleading facts: &ldquo;the beggar&rsquo;s all  right&mdash;be on his legs in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks  to your care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  rub it into a fellow, Lady Jim!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  James!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  James it is, though it seems to me that we are to be merely acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  of my friends are acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I want this acquaintance to be a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an exacting nature! Well&rdquo;&mdash;with a sigh&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose as you have loved and I have  lost, we can be friends till you marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not after?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  Mr. Askew, a bachelor selects his own friends, a wife chooses those of her  husband. Meantime, you are a nice boy, if somewhat fickle, and I like you sufficiently  to let you go. When does this ship of yours go south?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Schooner,  Lady Jim&mdash;schooner-yacht; two hundred tons Lloyd&rsquo;s measurement and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  explained that before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I? Yes, of course. Well, she is a beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  The same term was applied to me once and by a man who said that he would love  me for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe I was ever so crude,&rdquo; retorted Askew, bluntly; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t tell a  lady that she is a beauty, though you might say it to a shopgirl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!  I don&rsquo;t know any people of that class. You do, apparently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man grew red and wriggled like a speared eel, thinking how very like a  woman she was. She did not want him, and she did want him; she told him to go,  and wished him to stop; she pardoned his fickleness, yet kept it in mind. &ldquo;Ah,  you bundle of contradictions!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not say a woman? One word explains your three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like to be verbose,&rdquo; said Askew, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  always are&mdash;first about me, and then about this ship thing. I suppose the  Fajardo woman will be the next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  speak of her like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? She is my rival. I should be more than mortal if I forgave her, and less  than a woman if I did not say nasty things about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  them about me, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been doing my best, and really, you take a ragging very well. There, poor  boy&rdquo;&mdash;she patted his cheek&mdash;&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t tease you any more. When do you sail?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  Buenos Ayres?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  true and eager lover! Dine with me next Thursday, and we can talk about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  be nasty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  the ship? Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you meant Lola.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I did; both ship and woman are &lsquo;hers,&rsquo; you know. Next Thursday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be delighted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look it. Do try and conceal your emotions better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  laughed, and took up his hat. She was more like a mosquito than a human being,  and he made for the door, weary of being stung. &ldquo;I would rather be your friend  than your husband, Lady Jim,&rdquo; he said coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a compliment, seeing what husbands are! I ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  pardon me&mdash;I forgot,&rdquo; he stuttered, much confused.</p>
  <p>She  shook her head at him gravely. &ldquo;What a child in arms you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  this last piece of impertinence Askew would have replied rather sharply,  thereby proving the truth of her remark, but that the door was blocked by a  tall lean man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M.  Aksakoff!&rdquo; announced the footman, behind the newcomer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day,  Lady James. Good-day, M. Aksakoff, and good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah,  when alone with the diplomatist, felt her heart leap at the solemnity of his  looks. She fancied that he might have come to tell her of the doctor&rsquo;s escape.  In reality, Aksakoff was wondering how he could pay her two thousand pounds  without turning the arranged comedy into a drama. Feeling his way, he allowed  her the first word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will stop to luncheon,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, amiably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trespass too much on your hospitality, dear madame. You must have had enough of  me at our last luncheon in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I have forgotten all about Paris&rdquo;; and she gave him a look which intimated that  he also should feign forgetfulness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  no; but pardon me, I came to inquire about M. Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  from me? I know nothing. Wait&mdash;I do know something. He wrote me a letter saying  he was better and intended to go to Russia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  to see Petrovitch about his pardon. I wish I had seen him before he left Paris&rdquo;;  and the diplomatist smiled when the letter was mentioned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you not see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;But it was impossible, madame,&rdquo; he explained, without  even a wink. &ldquo;Dr. Helfmann took him away in the fiacre and I departed for  Havre. I did not return to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see; your business at Havre detained you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Longer  than I expected,&rdquo; said the diplomatist, taking his cue. &ldquo;You see, madame, I was  forced to repeat my conversation with M. Demetrius to my cousin the Count. I  expect that he wrote to Paris, and told M. Demetrius to come to Havre for a  conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  knowing his address? How clever!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  laughed. &ldquo;You have me there, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really don&rsquo;t know what you mean. How is Katinka?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is at Brussels. In good health, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she know that M. Demetrius has gone to St. Petersburg?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly.  He had to write announcing his engagement to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  he expected Lady Jim to be taken aback by this abrupt speech, he was mistaken  in the woman, whose aplomb he should have known. She merely laughed and dropped  out a ready lie with slow amusement. &ldquo;Ah, my dear M. Aksakoff, clever linguists  as you Russians are, your comprehension of the English language is limited&mdash;very,  very limited. M. Demetrius should have known, that in our tongue, one word may  have several meanings. See&mdash;a diocese. See&mdash;to perceive by the eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  illustration is felicitous, madame. I understand, then, that M. Demetrius  translated &lsquo;No&rsquo; as &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he was by no means so stupid as that. The man bothered me with attentions for  months, and was quite a nuisance. I nearly spoke to poor dear Jim about his  smirking, grinning compliments. He talked of me in clubs and followed  everywhere, sighing like a furnace&mdash;if a furnace ever does sigh. I speak on  Shakespeare&rsquo;s authority. To keep the creature quiet I said something which he  apparently misconstrued&mdash;a sop to Cerberus, a cake to a child. You understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. There was no engagement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  at all. How impertinent of him to suggest such a thing, when my husband is scarcely  cold in his grave! But I pardon him on account of his ignorance of our  language, which undoubtedly led him into error. When I see him again I shall  explain myself in a way which he will probably find disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  smiled imperceptibly. &ldquo;M. Demetrius is much to blame, madame, for not having  given more attention to your English grammar. I go to St. Petersburg myself in  a week. Perhaps you will give me some message to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  The man is a fool, and I never wish to hear about him again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  command shall be obeyed. From this moment his name shall never be mentioned by  me&rdquo;; and he mentally admired the clever way in which she had wriggled out of an  untenable situation. But the object of his visit had still to be approached,  and at this moment an inspiration how to approach it came opportunely. The  mention of poor dear Jim suggested lines upon which he might proceed with  safety. &ldquo;I come on a serious errand, madame,&rdquo; said he, softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  she did not know what he meant, and under the circumstances did not intend to  inquire. To advance under the guns of masked batteries was never Leah&rsquo;s mode of  campaigning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  husband&mdash;pardon, your late husband&mdash;played bridge,&rdquo; said the diplomatist, so  crudely as to render himself unworthy of the name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly;  and with me on occasions. Twelve months ago we were a party of five at Torquay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe Jim did go there sometimes. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is hard to go on, madame,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, with feigned nervousness, &ldquo;as I have  a confession to make.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  grant you absolution beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are too good. Then I can repay you by handing over the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  losses at bridge. Yes; with your husband and others I played a great deal&mdash;unfortunately  for my pockets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  noticed the misused plural and smiled. &ldquo;Most people made that remark  grammatically, when they played with Jim. So you lost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  exact sum he had mentioned at Monte Carlo. At once she saw that he wished to  pay wages on a sufficiently plausible pretext. The money would have been useful  to pay Strange and Jim, so that she could keep her thirty thousand pounds  intact; but, strangely enough in so unscrupulous a woman, she could not make up  her mind to finger such dirty gold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death  pays all debts,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the part of the corpse, assuredly. But those who live have to reckon with the  executors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case you had better see the Marquis of Frith. He is poor Jim&rsquo;s executor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  no, madame; be kind. I should have paid this money before, but my salary did  not permit. What would M. le Marquis say if I confessed that I delayed so long  to pay a debt of honour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it matter, so long as you do pay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  matters much amongst men,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, stiffly. &ldquo;But you, a woman, and a  clever woman,&rdquo; he added with emphasis, &ldquo;will understand. I pray you, madame, to  take my cheque for the full amount, and permit my mind to be at rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim, priding herself on performing a hard penance for her late rascality, shook  her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, seriously; &ldquo;I am quite sure that Jim, who was often  in a hole himself, would not have been hard on you. Had he lived the money  would have been a godsend to him&mdash;I admit that; but I really cannot take payment  of any gambling debts. It would not be right,&rdquo; she finished virtuously.</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  was less surprised than she anticipated. Her refusal of this money assured him  that the story of the engagement was true, and that Leah had rid herself of an  undesirable suitor, who had power to compel completion of a forced contract.  What power Demetrius had over her Aksakoff could not guess, but the whole  circumstances showed that her desire had been for the obliteration of the man,  and not to earn two thousand pounds. But nothing of this appeared on his calm  face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray  take the cheque, madame,&rdquo; he urged, and held it under her nose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; She pushed back her chair from that too alluring bait. &ldquo;I cannot take it,  and I shall say nothing about it. Stay&rdquo;&mdash;she took the fluttering paper from his  hand and rose. &ldquo;You have paid me on Jim&rsquo;s behalf&mdash;is that not so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;;  Aksakoff watched her, wondering at this right-about-face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then&rdquo;&mdash;she  approached the fire and flung in the cheque&mdash;&ldquo;the debt is paid, and you are  free.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, yes.&rdquo; Lady Jim approached him with outstretched hands, and a smile which  had won her many things. &ldquo;You are my friend and not my debtor. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  kissed those extended hands. &ldquo;Madame, a hard-working and poor official thanks  you. My services now and ever are at your command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  the thought that Demetrius might return unexpectedly from Siberia, she thanked  him. &ldquo;I may have to remind you of that some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  and where you will, madame!&rdquo; His pale eyes lighted up with enthusiastic fire. &ldquo;Were  you my wife, I should be an ambassador.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be some day. Madame Aksakoff has talents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  Aksakoff is&mdash;Madame Aksakoff; and you, are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what?&rdquo; she demanded, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  weak!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  language is weak, when used to describe such a woman as you, madame. I take my  leave. Your servant!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  my friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the death, madame!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went out as stiff and solemn as ever, with the conviction that he had parted  from Jezebel&rsquo;s cousin-german. Nevertheless, he admired her prodigiously,  especially as he intended to put into his own pockets the two thousand pounds  she had so tactfully earned, and so foolishly rejected. The bureaucracy would  never hear of her folly, and it would be a pity to return money which a poor  official could bank against evil days. Not that Aksakoff expected these. The  capture of Demetrius, without publicity, and so cleverly achieved, would gain  him infinite credit as an efficient servant of the Czar. &ldquo;A charming and astute  woman,&rdquo; he thought gratefully, when ruminating on certain advancement. &ldquo;But  dangerous,&rdquo; added Prudence.</p>
  <p>Leah  went about for the next seven days with her head in the air, and with a  contempt for those people who found renunciation difficult. She could renounce,  with ease: had she not refused a large sum of money because she felt that it  was wrong to take it? What self-denial! She felt aggressively virtuous, and but  for the circumstances would have liked to trumpet her perfections in the  street. That she did not do so was further self-denial and a flattering  conscience, with which Providence had nothing to do, assured her that she was a  pearl amongst women. Now that Demetrius was out of sight she calmly put him out  of mind, and began to think how she could prevent Askew from spoiling Jim&rsquo;s  nefarious courting of the Spanish lady. There was no way, so far as she could  see, since the sailor&rsquo;s love had grown cold, and she had no bonds in which to  bind him. But she trusted to that luck which the fetish always sent her way,  and sure enough the luck came, but some weeks later. Beforehand the fetish,  still annoyed by her prayer to another god, sent her a reminder that it could  be disagreeable. A bolt from the blue came in the shape of a telegram from  Firmingham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  to me at once,&rdquo; wired the Marchioness. &ldquo;Yacht lost off Brest. Duke and Frith  and most of crew drowned. Come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might have spared the last word,&rdquo; said Leah, staring and stunned.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_26"></a>Chapter 26</b> </h2>
  <p>Lady  Jim boarded a special train to Firmingham in a royal rage, the more riotous for  necessary suppression. After the shock of the unexpected had passed, she gave a  flitting thought of pity to her drowned relatives, and reverted hastily to  selfish considerations. Solitude permitting the play of temper, she punished  the fetish, by flinging its outward and visible sign of a peacock&rsquo;s feather  from the compartment which witnessed the unmasking. That her Baal should have  played her such a trick was intolerable, and still more intolerable the thought  that circumstances muzzled her. For the first time in her victorious life Leah  Kaimes dealt with a fixed decree, against which there was no appeal.</p>
  <p>What  could she do? Nothing! To make chaos of a continent would not have relieved her  feelings, and there was nothing to wreck in the limited space of the carriage.  Unable to sit still, she threw herself from seat to seat, feeling like a caged  tiger, with the added savagery of a trained intellect. Unlike the beast, she  had the use of speech to vent her wrath, but this she did not utilise from a  conviction that no words would do justice to the situation. A Texan mule-driver&rsquo;s  vocabulary would have fallen short of her requirements. Her impotent anger was  like that of a dog leaping and slavering against an offending but unreachable  moon.</p>
  <p>And  the facts&mdash;the hard ironic facts, which she could not do away with, scheme as  she might! Those inflexible actualities buzzed in her brain, until repetition  took the rhythm of the droning wheels underfoot. Pentland was dead, along with  his son and heir; Hilda, a widow with two girl babies, who did not count in the  succession; Jim was wiped out of social existence, and by her own act. Remained  Lionel, the curate, the prig, her one honest man&mdash;the Duke of Pentland. Leah  could have screamed in the face of this crushing truth.</p>
  <p>A  title at the best, fifty thousand a year, three country seats, a town house,  spacious and crammed with beautiful things, and a Scotch moor with an adorable  shooting-box. This was the heritage of the new peer! &ldquo;Of a milk-and-water  parson,&rdquo; raged Lady Jim, unjustly, &ldquo;who will waste everything in charity, and  turn the houses into pigsties for the unclean. Oh, Lord, to think that such a  clerical ass should get the inside runnings!&rdquo; This latter phrase she had picked  up from Miss Mulrady, and at the moment it seemed expressive.</p>
  <p>The  position would not bear thinking about; yet she had to think, appealing  betweenwhiles to the gods-of-things-as-they-are for reasons to justify such  shabby treatment. What had she done, that they should be so disagreeable? It  was enough to make a truly virtuous woman, as she assuredly could call herself,  dance a can-can in Piccadilly. Then she desisted for a few moments from calling  the Unseen bad names to lament over her own short-sightedness. To think that  she should have sold Jim&rsquo;s birthright for thirty thousand pounds! It was not  even one year&rsquo;s income of the Pentland estates. She would have been a Duchess,  too; not that she personally cared for rank, but with a higher position she  could have trampled the more easily on her enemies. A thought of these flashing  into her mind made her clench her fists and grit her teeth. How they would  rejoice, the beasts, to think what she had missed, and by how short a period  she had missed it! If they had only one neck, as Caligula desired for his  enemies, how she would have enjoyed a chop at it!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  cried Leah, banging the cushions and choking in the dust thus raised&mdash;&ldquo;if I  could only bring Jim back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a kindly wish, as she desired him to enjoy the good things that had fallen  into his sham grave. But there did not seem much chance of achieving the  impossible. Jim was dead and buried, and the interment had been legally  sanctified by her tears. If he came to life it would be difficult to explain  how a corpse in his name came to occupy a niche in the Kaimes vault. Also,  inquiry might lead to the production of a Siberian exile. If Demetrius told the  truth&mdash;which he assuredly would do in the face of a betrayal he must guess was  her work&mdash;there would be no place for her in Society, and she would starve, a  social Peri at the gates of a forbidden Paradise. No! Think as she would&mdash;and  think she did till her brain ached&mdash;things had to remain as she had foolishly  arranged them. It was a galling thought to think that none but she who suffered  was responsible. She could not even lay the blame on the stars; but she could  and did on the fetish. It was something of a relief to have thrown its peacock  manifestation out of the window.</p>
  <p>Two  hours in the railway carriage tamed her unruly nerves into some sort of  submission, and partially schooled her into accepting the inevitable. To make  the best of it, to rob the new Duke shamelessly of money and the Curzon Street  house, on the plea of disinheritance, were the results at which she arrived. By  the time Firmingham appeared through the carriage windows she had ceased to  kick against the pricks. The mask was on her face when the train stopped, and  it was a quiet and demure lady who alighted at the station. Even the  sister-in-law who entered the great house to console the Marchioness was as  sympathetic as the most exacting could have required.</p>
  <p>She  suppressed a groan when she passed through the doors of the lordly mansion that  was really and truly her own, but managed by a steady exercise of her strong  will to greet Colley with great calmness. The butler intimated that Lady Frith  wept incessantly in her boudoir, and that the Duke&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  queried Leah, sharply, adding more grammatically, &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  Grace the Duke, my lady. He is in the study.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Lionel Kaimes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  was, my lady. His Grace came down last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Augh!  Why wasn&rsquo;t there an accident on the line?&rdquo; muttered she, who longed to announce  herself as a genuine duchess and could not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg pardon, my lady!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  go to my room, Colley. Tell his Grace I shall see him in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  she had changed her dress for one heavier with crape, as a sign of additional  grief, and had lain for a miserable forty minutes without closing an eye, and  had swallowed a much-needed dose of sal volatile, and had relieved her feelings  by scolding an unoffending maid, she went before the footlights to play her  most difficult and unpalatable part. The former nobody, seated at his  predecessor&rsquo;s desk, rose, looking pale and careworn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  terrible thing,&rdquo; said the new Duke, giving his hand gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awful.  I can scarcely believe it. Is it really true?&rdquo; and she had a passing hope that  it might not be, seeing she could not benefit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  too true, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  those two, I suppose you mean. You&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  square peg in a round hole, I fear,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I would give much that both  had survived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  unnatural!&rdquo; commented Lady Jim, with a grimace. &ldquo;But you always were eccentric.  People won&rsquo;t mind that, now you are a duke. But I am sorry&mdash;really&mdash;for them, I  mean. Such an awful thing to be cut off before you&rsquo;ve made your arrangements  for an agreeable reception in the next world. What a mercy they went together&mdash;for  company, you know; and they say drowning is really quite nice after the first  choking is over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  looked at her sternly, but felt helpless. She played with the solemn issues of  life and death as a child with a bauble. Would nothing touch her heart? Would  nothing make her serious? The flippancy jarred on his overstrung nerves. &ldquo;Please  do not talk like that,&rdquo; said he, harshly and emphatically. &ldquo;Please do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am only trying to cheer you up,&rdquo; she answered, opening her eyes wide, and with  a faint smile softening her hard mouth. &ldquo;I really cried&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t think me  hard-hearted; really, I cried when I heard of the accident. I suppose it was an  accident?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should call it the act of God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Leah could find no very pertinent reply, and glided dexterously into another  subject, to prevent religious instruction. &ldquo;I came down to see poor Hilda, as  she wanted me so badly. But I thought it best to learn details from you first.  We must spare the poor thing&rsquo;s feelings, you know, Lionel,&rdquo; ended Lady Jim,  thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>His  face brightened. &ldquo;I am glad you call me that,&rdquo; said he, earnestly, &ldquo;for I  confess it is difficult for me to respond to my title.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  get used to it,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;I suppose you will drop the parson now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. I am still my Master&rsquo;s servant. He has merely raised me to a higher and  more responsible position in His household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Raised  your wages also,&rdquo; murmured Leah, shrugging. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Lionel, I  should not have said that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should not, indeed,&rdquo; was the pained response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a kind of hysteria,&rdquo; apologised Lady Jim, almost at a loss for an excuse, &ldquo;like  that man who botanised on his mother&rsquo;s grave, you know. Besides, people who  really feel, laugh awfully when sorrow comes. And Jim&rsquo;s death took most of my  tears&mdash;poor dear Jim! I daresay you think that I am unfeeling; but I&rsquo;m not&mdash;really  and truly, I&rsquo;m not. What with these dear things dying so unexpectedly, and my  own feeling of widowhood, and condolences from people who will say the wrong  thing, I feel broken-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  smiled grimly at this incoherent and wholly false explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a strange way of showing grief, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be nasty, now that you are up in the world. I&rsquo;ll be quite different with Hilda,  poor soul, though I must be natural with you. It is a compliment, if you only  look at it in the right way, which of course, with your priggishness, you won&rsquo;t.  And you needn&rsquo;t use that cheap title of mine, just to remind me how nearly I&rsquo;ve  missed being called by a more expensive one. I suppose Joan will be your  duchess. Do you think she will fill the position!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Admirably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  curt! There is still a lot of the parson about you, Lionel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  ever will be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;World  without end, I suppose. Hysteria again, Duke, so don&rsquo;t look shocked. Give me  details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man looked again at this wonderful being. For many months he had known  the impossibility of altering Leah&rsquo;s view of things seen and unseen. The most  sacred subjects seemed to appeal to her sense of humour, and no solemnity could  banish the ever-ready smile from her lips. In reality he was unjust in thinking  thus. Lady Jim, considering her losses and the ironic position she occupied,  only kept herself from shrieking out the truth by giving vent to ill-timed  frivolities. Her greatest relief would have been to tell this prig that he was  a supplanter. Hysteria, said she, was the excuse for unnatural merriment, and  truly hysteria it was, although she could not swear to it. Unaware of all this  turmoil in the mind of the mourner in motley, Lionel positively thought that  troubles had rendered her distraught, and so passed over her incongruities.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  yacht was on her homeward way,&rdquo; he explained, in the eminently laboured fashion  of a landsman when dealing with ships. &ldquo;During that storm a week ago she went  down off Brest&mdash;Cape Brest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Struck  on a reef?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  she sprang a leak, and the boats were stove in, so no one could be saved in  that way. By clinging to a spar the steward reached shore. He alone survived&rdquo;;  and Lionel covered his face to indulge in a silent prayer for those who had  perished.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim was more practical according to her lights. &ldquo;Why did you only hear this  week-old news yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  steward, the survivor, was ill with fever: also he was wounded in the head,&mdash;against  the rock, I suppose. The yacht was seen to founder far off shore, but no one at  Brest knew her name. When the steward came to himself the other day, he  explained, and the news was telegraphed to the Duke&rsquo;s lawyers, who sent for me.  I expect we shall not learn full details till this steward arrives. He is now  on his way to London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Duke&mdash;Frith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their  bodies are in the depths with the ship and those who formed her crew. Peace be  to their souls!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; said Leah, tartly, and paying her tribute to the  dead. &ldquo;I am quite sure that the Duke and Frith have gone to that heaven you&rsquo;re  always talking about. It is awful,&rdquo; she added pensively, and with a shudder; &ldquo;but  talking only makes it worse. I&rsquo;ll go and see Hilda, poor dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  followed her to the door. &ldquo;Lady James, let me beg of you to keep the&mdash;er&mdash;hysteria  in check.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; she assured him, giving her hand frankly; &ldquo;I always adapt my mood to  my company. It would be useless for one woman to waste hysteria on another&mdash;both  know too much about it. I&rsquo;ll be nice&mdash;oh, you can be sure of that. I&rsquo;m not a bad  sort, my good man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes  I think you are a very decent sort, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  on other occasions?&rdquo; she questioned, unmoved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.  You can&rsquo;t explain, and will only fib. Parsons can&rsquo;t keep back an answer,  whether they know anything of the matter in hand or not. But I&rsquo;ll be good to  that poor baby-woman&mdash;indeed I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  indeed she was, swinging round to the opposite extreme, with the protean  adaptability of her nature. Besides, after the interview with the new Duke she  felt able to command her feelings better. It is only possible to act perfectly  when the emotions are under control, as Lady Jim found; and if she said what  she did not mean, and acted as she did not feel, well, that was the fault of  the circumstances into which her treacherous fetish had thrown her. But at  heart she really had some pity for this useless doll of a woman, who sobbed in  her arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  cry, dear,&rdquo; said Leah, ardently, beginning to console; &ldquo;you know how I feel for  you. I also have lost a husband.&rdquo; Owing to circumstances she rather choked over  this lie, but it came out pretty readily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall never&mdash;never lift up my head again,&rdquo; sobbed the latest widow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you will, dear,&rdquo; replied the earlier one, cheerfully: &ldquo;look at me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hilda  shook her head and declined to look. &ldquo;Frith wasn&rsquo;t Jim,&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he wasn&rsquo;t my husband, either. You feel Frith&rsquo;s death and I feel Jim&rsquo;s. We each  have our own sorrow, and time alone will help us to forget the dear departed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah&rdquo;&mdash;Hilda  sobbed more violently than ever&mdash;&ldquo;I shall never&mdash;never forget. Never&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t mean forget exactly,&rdquo; murmured Leah, who had been more candid than she  intended; &ldquo;but time will soothe us, and we shall all meet on a happier shore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so&mdash;I hope so&rdquo;; the Marchioness clasped her hands devoutly and raised her  eyes. &ldquo;I can see our three dear ones meeting now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, truthfully, and she felt that the meeting of the  Kaimes family in heaven would be a sight worth witnessing. Of course Jim was  alive, but even if he were dead, she did not think that Hilda&rsquo;s vision could  possibly become fact. The Duke, who had turned angel in his old age, and Frith,  who was always pious, had a chance certainly; but Jim, when his turn came,  would probably not be of the party.</p>
  <p>However,  the business of consoling a sore heart had to be attended to, and Leah dosed  Hilda with all the platitudes which the Marchioness had used during a similar  and earlier event. And Lady Jim was so admirable an actress that she really  deceived herself into thinking that her stage-play was real life. Her  eloquence, her attentions, her hoverings like a guardian angel over Hilda, her  bringing in the children&mdash;that was a master-stroke&mdash;and her general zeal in  drying a mourner&rsquo;s tears, were truly wonderful. By the time she left the  Marchioness, sitting up with &ldquo;his children&rdquo; on her lap, soothed and comforted,  and grateful for Leah&rsquo;s kindness, poor Lady Jim felt quite exhausted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do hope there will be a decent dinner,&rdquo; she soliloquised, in the seclusion of  her own room. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand much more of this without food.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Through  the troubles of death and the joys of birth, the worry of weak minds and the scheming  of strong ones, ever moves the solid business of life connected with eating and  sleeping. Therefore the Firmingham cook, being a hired servant, was  sufficiently master of his emotions to send up a really tempting repast. The  new Duke and the disinherited Duchess partook of this meal in a small room  without attendance. Wishing to talk family matters, they did not desire  eavesdropping footmen. Besides, Hilda remained in her own apartment, nourishing  her emotions with red lavender, and calling at intervals for &ldquo;Bunny&rdquo; to come  back. Lady Jim paid several visits to the poor little soul during the evening,  and each time was successful in cheering her up; but it was trying work, as  again and again she had to begin from the beginning. No wonder she looked harassed  when seated opposite to her host. Lionel thanked her gratefully, and with  reason, for Hilda had eulogised Leah and her work of mercy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew you would prove yourself a true woman,&rdquo; said he, pouring her out a glass  of champagne.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord!&rdquo; said Lady Jim, sipping the wine, and wondered what he would say could he  see into her mind. &ldquo;Give me some of that vol-au-vent, Lionel. It is really very  good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man felt slightly disappointed. &ldquo;You can eat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you require me to tell you that?&rdquo; she asked lightly. &ldquo;I have enjoyed every  course. Eat&mdash;I should think so. You don&rsquo;t want me to faint, as Hilda has been  doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your feelings&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they are well under control, now. And after all&rdquo;&mdash;Leah paused with a fork  half-way to her mouth&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s best to be sensible even when things smash. If I  had come down to howl about the house, where would you have been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really cannot understand your nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim nodded. &ldquo;Same here. I never know what I shall do under given circumstances,  save keep my poor wits about me. We&rsquo;re strange beasts, Lionel&mdash;strange beasts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  disagreed, mindful of her Good Samaritan kindness. &ldquo;You make yourself out to be  worse than you are, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you make any such mistake. I never seek cheap praise by crying down my virtues.  Were you my father-confessor&mdash;which you are not&mdash;and I religious&mdash;which I have no  inclination to be&mdash;I should shock you into Hilda&rsquo;s state. Poor little thing,  what an undisciplined mind she has, and how she does work for those tyrants the  emotions! I think you had better send for Joan: she is used to women who run  wild.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  put things unpleasantly,&rdquo; said he, uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  truthfully. Answer my question, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joan  arrives to-morrow with her mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad,&rdquo; Leah assured him fervently. &ldquo;Too many female cooks can never spoil  the funeral broth. The more women you have in a mourning house the better. We  like to weep in company and to talk obituary notices. That is, other women do.  I fancy I have a dash of the man in me, and this sort of undertaker rejoicing gives  me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  secretly agreed with her, although he disapproved of the mode of expression.  Ostentatious grief he disliked, as most men do, and discussing funeral emotions  threadbare was not to his healthy liking. Therefore did he talk business with  Lady Jim. It was necessary to distract his attention, she said, and so set  about plundering the heir. By the time coffee arrived Lionel had promised her  the Curzon Street house as a gift, and had agreed to pay all debts as the late  Duke had arranged. Also, untruthfully assured by Leah that her temporal  prosperity had suffered by the untimely demise of Jim, he promised to pay a  quarterly thousand a year for the rest of her life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Lionel, emphatically, &ldquo;even if you marry, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no intention of marrying yet,&rdquo; said Leah, who was busy with K&uuml;mmel. She  really felt that the consoling of a tearful widow required K&uuml;mmel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought that Mr. Askew admired you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  admires a new schooner he has bought, and some woman in South America. Oh, Mr.  Askew has a catholic mind, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Demetrius!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has gone to Russia, I believe, on business connected with his pardon. Didn&rsquo;t  Joan tell you how he was taken ill in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  what a strange thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know. He once told me that he inherited fits&mdash;mother&rsquo;s side. It was very  rude of him to have one in my rooms, but some men are so inconsiderate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  loves you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  loved me&mdash;which?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Present  tense, I fancy. Will you marry him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  I marry the Emperor of China, you mean. No, thanks; I have no wish to live in a  country of bounce and bombs. And I never could read those novels written by men  with unpronounceable names. Besides, I can&rsquo;t bear dapper little men with waxed  moustaches. I only tolerated Dr. Demetrius because he was useful to Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  great friend of your husband&rsquo;s, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you? Does one generally make a friend of one&rsquo;s doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man was certainly credited with being your friend. And more, he talked openly  of his love for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  bad taste! I don&rsquo;t see how you can hold me responsible. He did love me, I  believe&mdash;at least, he pestered me with attentions. It&rsquo;s a mercy he has gone to  Si&mdash;I mean to Russia. I hope he&rsquo;ll stay there, and be eaten up by white bears  like those poor brats Elisha was so spiteful to. As to marrying&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes  twinkled&mdash;&ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be easy to replace poor Jim. He was such a good husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  never said that when he was alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not: he would have taken advantage of the compliment. But Jim wasn&rsquo;t bad  on the whole. He left me alone, at all events. Perhaps his successor will  bother me to show public affection: as if I would&mdash;or could, for the matter of  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  James, do you love any one but yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  and Joan&mdash;dear little innocent glass-case dolls that you are. Yes; you may blush  and smile, but I am really in earnest. You were always so rude to me that I  knew you to be genuine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Lionel exhibited shocked surprise. &ldquo;I hope I was never rude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horribly,  on all occasions. If you had not been, I never should have believed that you  were genuine. When people mean what they say, and don&rsquo;t want anything from one,  they are always rude; it&rsquo;s a kind of trademark. I am sure Socrates was a man  you could always trust and would never have invited to dinner. You&rsquo;re something  like him, only you don&rsquo;t ask questions and are better-looking. I always  consider you the one honest man in a world of rogues, and if you were not  engaged to Joan, I should marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  coloured still deeper and laughed in an embarrassed fashion. &ldquo;I might have something  to say to that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. Didn&rsquo;t you hear me say that I should have married you. What could you  or any man do against me?&rdquo; and she laughed with an insolent pride in her beauty  and powers. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I have to run up to town to-morrow on  business. Do you mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. Joan and her mother will be here. Do exactly what you please, Lady  James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  me Leah, now that you are the head of the family,&rdquo; she murmured, and laid a  gentle hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>He  threw back his head and met her eyes, with a boyish blush. &ldquo;Leah!&rdquo; he breathed.  &ldquo;Very well, then&mdash;Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim tapped his smooth cheek indulgently. &ldquo;You foolish thing,&rdquo; she said, kindly;  &ldquo;if it was worth my while, I could&mdash;&rdquo; Leaving the sentence unfinished and Lionel  furious, she left the room. That she&mdash;this hardened coquette of the world,  should dare to think he would forget the sweetest and best of girls. Let her  sing the song of the sirens as she might, he would never&mdash;no, never, prove false  to Joan. But honest as were these thoughts, Lionel was but a man, when all was  said and done, and the touch on his shoulder, the look in her eyes, the cooing  murmur of her voice, made him wince, and not unpleasantly. Well was it for the  young man that Leah did not choose to try her wiles, else he might have been  lured towards that pit the edges of which are wreathed with roses. Had his  future Duchess been any other than Joan the simple, a perverse spirit might  have led Lady Jim to indulge in some perilous amusement; but she liked the girl,  and honestly respected Lionel. Therefore did the lover scoff at her magic arts,  strong only in escaping temptation. Had Leah put forth her powers&mdash; &ldquo;Silly  little donkey,&rdquo; she thought, climbing the stairs, &ldquo;as if I couldn&rsquo;t do what I  liked. It would be a hard battle, but I could&mdash;I could&mdash;I could,&mdash;only I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  she finished. &ldquo;Joan is a dear girl, and I am the most worried woman in the  world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  made the latter part of this final remark again, when she conned a brusque and  somewhat imperative letter which had arrived by the evening post. It came from  one Richard Strange, and purported to be written from a third-rate Strand  hotel. This uncivilised communication intimated that the aforesaid Strange  would be obliged&mdash;this underlined&mdash;if her ladyship would afford him an immediate  interview.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;m,&rdquo;  commented Leah, glancing suspiciously at the underlined word, &ldquo;he isn&rsquo;t sure of  his money, and means to be nasty if he doesn&rsquo;t get it. Well&rdquo;&mdash;she heaved a sigh&mdash;&ldquo;he  must be paid, I suppose, the blackmailing beast. And the whole sum down, I  expect. Time payments won&rsquo;t be acceptable to a man who writes in this fashion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  wrote an artful letter, stating that Dr. Demetrius had spoken of his travels  with a Captain Strange, and, solely because she wished to hear of poor Mr. Garth,  who had been a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of her late father-in-law, she made an appointment at  10, Curzon Street, for five the next evening. This epistle, which did not  recognise existing facts and could be shown to the whole world without  betraying anything underhand, she sent off at once. If possible, she would have  shirked meeting a man she more than suspected of being a brute. But to vanquish  danger one must meet it, as she very well knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if he wants more than his thousand,&rdquo; thought Lady Jim, again on her way to the  widowed Marchioness, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll find that I am quite equal to deal with him, and  with a dozen like him, if need be. A thousand pounds! Oh, Lord! The greedy  wretch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  she spread her wings as a ministering angel.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_27"></a>Chapter 27</b> </h2>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  rasped the lean man, and his eyes hardened like those of a cat with her claws  out; &ldquo;you figure it out, ma&rsquo;am, in your own way very prettily, I don&rsquo;t deny.  But my Pisgah-sight&rsquo;s got to be took, you bet. Guess we&rsquo;ll do th&rsquo; view in a  bunch, an&rsquo; toss fur lots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  smiled vaguely, because she was not sure of her ground, and required a  translator badly. Jim had been abstruse on occasions, but this seafaring person  spoke the shibboleth of a shifting population to excess. Never having met one  of this breed before, she did not know how to handle him. Captain Strange was  not a Muscovite diplomatist, who would call black white, or even grey, to  please her; and, moreover, he appeared to be extraordinarily unsympathetic in  the presence of lovely woman. The magic of sex had worked weakly hitherto, and  this brusque visitor gave her to understand that he was not to be cajoled into  make-believe conversation. He required, and declared emphatically that he did  require, an unvarnished statement of facts, to be argued exhaustively, so that  he might know&mdash;as he tersely put it&mdash;where he dropped anchor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t chuck orange-peel my way, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the mariner, and intended to  clinch his assertion by spitting. But the sight of the carpet pulled him back  to civilisation.</p>
  <p>The  friend of Demetrius, owner and captain of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>, presented  himself as a tall, small-boned man, with no superfluous flesh on his  frame-work, and with a jaw as hard&mdash;from bullying underlings&mdash;and as blue&mdash;from  close shaving&mdash;as were his eyes. The tint of these, added to the blackness of  curling hair, combined with the racy vernacular which he flung fairly in her  face, inclined Lady Jim to class him as an Irish-American. But from the  discourteous way in which he spoke&mdash;as they never would have spoken in dear  dirty Dublin&mdash;and from his habit of interjecting slang words chosen from the  domestic speech of the Five Nations, she was puzzled to fix his nationality  accurately. As a matter of private history, and this she discovered later, he  was entirely cosmopolitan, and, out of sheer contrariety, owed allegiance to no  particular flag. Not a bad-looking freebooter, Leah decided, with his regular  features, and well-shaped head, and white teeth, and ruddy clean-shaven face;  but dangerous, was her second and wiser thought. She was right. The man of many  lands was also of many minds, but at the back of them all lay the unalterable  determination to ride rough-shod over any one who would submit. As Lady Jim  also held to the same theory of individualism, it was not unlikely that a brisk  encounter might ensue, and for this she was quite prepared. Meantime, she  decided that he was picturesque, and, in his rough blue clothes, with a red  neck-tie and barbaric gold rings in his ears, and a general air of &ldquo;you-be-damnedness,&rdquo;  would have amused her as a new figure from the underworld, but that the large  issues of the conversation induced seriousness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand you, and I am sure you do not understand me,&rdquo; was her  observation, after digesting the orange-peel parable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  it go at that, ma&rsquo;am. But I reckon I kin make m&rsquo;self as clear as any man, livin&rsquo;  or dead, when dollars are in th&rsquo; pool. Now you&rdquo;&mdash;he shook a large brown finger&mdash;&ldquo;you,  ma&rsquo;am, give me taffy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is taffy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  you might call sugar&mdash;best brand, an&rsquo; no sand in it, anyhow. I&rsquo;ve struck heaps  of the female in my time, and it&rsquo;s all taffy with them, till they annex the  outfit, an&rsquo; then y&rsquo; kin go hang, I guess&rdquo;; he fixed her with a true  quarter-deck eye. &ldquo;I surmise as you&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; t&rsquo; play Sally Waters low down.  Not much&mdash;oh, no. I should smile considerable to think as any gilded female got  th&rsquo; bulge on me. Go slow, ma&rsquo;am. Make no haste when the fat&rsquo;s afire, ses  Isaiah. Reckon he knew things, did thet prophet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  smiled again at this Wild West outburst. &ldquo;You are a free child of nature, Captain  Strange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taffy  agin. I&rsquo;m a man, you bet, same along as your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think you and he would get on together extremely well,&rdquo; said Lady Jim,  dryly. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think you could contrive to be a little less rude?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  bless y&rsquo;, this is civil fur me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  your crew must love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  boot &lsquo;em round the ship if they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snapped Strange, very ferociously. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve  got t&rsquo; love me up t&rsquo; the level of workin&rsquo; their insides out, else I&rsquo;d lay out  every man jack in his little wooden overcoat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a sweet nature you have! Are you married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  a wife o&rsquo; sorts,&rdquo; said the mariner, indifferently, &ldquo;an&rsquo; two kids of th&rsquo; best.&rdquo;  His eyes softened. &ldquo;Now, ma&rsquo;am, you could talk t&rsquo; me fur a millennium &lsquo;bout  them little nippers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last word was pure Whitechapel, and Leah wondered if that parish could claim  this buccaneer. But time was too valuable to go into his private history, so  she replied gently, quick to perceive that there was a flaw in his armour, &ldquo;On  another occasion I shall be delighted to talk nursery, Captain Strange; but the  millennium has not yet arrived in Curzon Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;ve  got me there, I don&rsquo;t deny,&rdquo; cried Strange, hardening. &ldquo;Now this here racket,  as I&rsquo;ve sailed long-sides t&rsquo; fix up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be fixed up, as you call it, at once,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, sharply. &ldquo;The matter  is very simple.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it now? Lay on th&rsquo; paint, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  passed over this insolence very wisely. &ldquo;You were kind to that poor Mr. Garth,&rdquo;  she explained, calmly. &ldquo;And, besides, took Dr. Demetrius to my husband in  Jamaica. For these services I am willing to give you one thousand pounds&mdash;in  gold, if you like&rdquo;; she thought the metal might tempt him into closing with the  offer, but it did not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shucks,  ma&rsquo;am, shucks! You&rsquo;ve bin talkin&rsquo; paint an&rsquo; putty fur th&rsquo; las&rsquo; hour an&rsquo; more. T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t  no good nohow&mdash;not a bit, seein&rsquo; as I&rsquo;m being paid fur cold-drawn kidnappin&rsquo; of  your husband, so as y might loot a company of sorts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  winced at this rude blast of speech, which blew to shreds the verbal draperies  with which she was trying to clothe naked and unpleasant facts. &ldquo;I object to  the word kidnap. Lord James went with you of his own accord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  kin lay to that, ma&rsquo;am, an&rsquo; mighty spry wos he in lightin&rsquo; out of these gilded  halls int&rsquo; the free an&rsquo; wild. Kidnappin&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t, if y&rsquo; come t&rsquo; th&rsquo; bone, so I  climb down slick. Oh, there ain&rsquo;t no meanness &lsquo;bout me, ma&rsquo;am. Prove me wrong,  an&rsquo; I go pious right along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you are apparently pious now, Captain Strange, there may be a chance of our  arriving at an understanding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  nodded. &ldquo;If as how you&rsquo;ll talk down t&rsquo; th&rsquo; bed-rock level of what we&rsquo;ve bin  doin&rsquo;, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  winced again, not liking to run with this ruffian in iniquitous harness. &ldquo;You  want a thousand pounds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  drawled the captain, &ldquo;y&rsquo; might say fairer than thet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  means that you intend to ask for what you won&rsquo;t get.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!  Guess thet&rsquo;ll be as right as pie, when I open out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can open out now,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, coolly.</p>
  <p>Her  antagonist admired this bluffing to the extent of slapping his thigh, and  chuckling like a blackbird over a worm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dandy one t&rsquo; deal with, fur  sure, an&rsquo; a woman at that. My word&rdquo;&mdash;this was Australian&mdash;&ldquo;if my missus hed bin  your sort, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; bin walkin&rsquo; a liner as a golden-barred skipper. You  kin freeze on t&rsquo; thet, straight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim laughed, not ill pleased. Aksakoff had paid her some such compliment, and  it was interesting to see the diverse ways in which the same idea can be  expressed. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said she, nodding her thanks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  waste chin-music, neither,&rdquo; mused the captain. &ldquo;Want&rsquo;s t&rsquo; git at my cards afore  she shows her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are in the right so far, Captain Strange&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Talks  book English like print. If she ain&rsquo;t a queen of dimins an&rsquo; hearts I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no doubt you will be some day,&rdquo; interposed Leah, before he could get the  word out; &ldquo;but until you are, suppose you&mdash;er&mdash;open out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Touchin&rsquo;  the passage money, as you might call it in a high-falutin&rsquo; way, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Passage  money for my husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  fur a double of his, as negotiated the Noo Jerusalem on th&rsquo; v&rsquo;yge,&rdquo; nodded the  captain, extending his long legs. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s th&rsquo; man we planted at Funchal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  nephew&mdash;buried in place of Mr. Garth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nephew!  Oh, he wasn&rsquo;t any relative o&rsquo; mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Demetrius informed me that he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!  Guess he wos filled up with thet idear by me. Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I reckoned t&rsquo; make  more dollars by supplyin&rsquo; a nevy as a corp. But he wos a pick-up, bless y&rsquo;,  racketin&rsquo; off chain, withouter friend, wife, or kid, till I help plant him in  Madeira.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  inquiries be made about him?&rdquo; she asked, carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;  make me smile some, ma&rsquo;am. Why, I picked up a stray dog o&rsquo; purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;  said Leah, lying back comfortably; &ldquo;it would have been better for your pocket  had you withheld this information until you cashed my cheque. It will make a  difference.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo;  t&rsquo; cut int&rsquo; th&rsquo; thousand?&rdquo; asked Strange, blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was not your nephew, remember,&rdquo; she retorted. The mariner stared and chuckled. &ldquo;Donner  und Blitz!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know German, if you prefer to talk in that tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  recovered with another stare. &ldquo;I reckon y&rsquo;ve hed a board-school eddication all  along th&rsquo; line. I swear in any lingo handy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I hear,&rdquo; she informed him swiftly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t stock furrein chin-chin nowhow. An&rsquo; now, ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;&mdash;he expanded his chest  and puffed out his cheeks&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble y&rsquo; t&rsquo; han&rsquo; over ten thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that in English?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  thousand pounds.&rdquo; Evidently Strange had gone to considerable trouble in  calculating his blackmail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if you do not get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I guess you&rsquo;ll be sent up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  laughed scornfully. &ldquo;I understand: unless I submit to extortion you will tell  this story about your supposed nephew and Mr. Garth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  rip out everything&rdquo; the captain assured her without flinching; &ldquo;an&rsquo; t&rsquo; th&rsquo;  nearest copper&rdquo;&mdash;the last word, she observed, was popular cockney.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  careful,&rdquo; she warned him; &ldquo;our police make capital out of rascality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sailor choked and his eyes bulged. &ldquo;Ras&mdash;ras&mdash;rascality?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blackmail,  in plain English, Captain Strange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naow  don&rsquo;t git me riz,&rdquo; Strange implored her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a holy terror with m&rsquo; hair off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we can tame wild beasts in this country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if I tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo;  breathed the astonished man; then almost shrieked an explanation: &ldquo;Why, thet  Dr. Demetrius brought Garth as a corp t&rsquo; Kingston, an&rsquo; yanked your husband int&rsquo;  the Blue Mountains t&rsquo; sham death. Aye; he did, y&rsquo; bet. An&rsquo; thet Berrin&rsquo;&mdash;Lord  James, y&rsquo; call him in your cussed fine way&mdash;come aboard my barkey, while the  corp as wos called by his name lighted out fur th&rsquo; old country, so thet y&rsquo;  might run rings round a company of sorts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  interesting! And what has it all to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  stars!&rdquo; Strange rose to stamp the more freely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down, please,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, sweetly. &ldquo;I do not allow people of your class to  show their manners in my drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  should be a prison with you in it,&rdquo; he raged. &ldquo;What a brute you are! Because  you think that I am under your thumb, you not only attempt blackmail, but add  insult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  make things hum, I kin tell y&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll bust up this conspiracy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  conspiracy?&rdquo; asked Leah, stubbornly.</p>
  <p>Strange  made for the door with a nautical roll. &ldquo;You kin arsk th&rsquo; nearest copper. I&rsquo;ll  give him details, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Close  the door after you, please,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, as he wrenched it open fiercely.</p>
  <p>The  captain immediately banged it again with a naughty word, and turned to behold  her opening a book. &ldquo;Cold-drawn cheek of th&rsquo; mos&rsquo; freezing style,&rdquo; murmured the  almost stupefied man. &ldquo;Oh, my country, t&rsquo;aint no wonder he took leg-bail. If I  wos married t&rsquo; her I&rsquo;d larrup her every day an&rsquo; twice on Sundays.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  gone yet?&rdquo; inquired Leah, glancing over the top of her book. &ldquo;Oh, please do! I  dislike hearing an illiterate person muttering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  keep me fro&rsquo; murder,&rdquo; gasped Strange, piously. &ldquo;Say, ma&rsquo;am, ain&rsquo;t you afeared?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awfully!  And as there are several policemen within call&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bring  &lsquo;em up&mdash;bring &lsquo;em all up, right along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will, if you do not go away&rdquo;; and she reached for the bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Snakes!  Y&rsquo; mus&rsquo; hev a card up your sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  y&rsquo; may be bluffin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I am. Don&rsquo;t you think it would be better if you sat down and talked pleasantly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I&rsquo;d a wife like you,&rdquo; commenced the captain, obeying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite sure you would. Bullies like you always enjoy wife-beating.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ain&rsquo;t a bully&rdquo;; he wiped his face with a flaunting red bandana handkerchief,  breathing heavily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you are, and a coward, who thought to frighten me. Now I am about to frighten  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;  Strange laughed scornfully. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t man, woman, or kid kin make me sing  small. Though I don&rsquo;t deny,&rdquo; he added gracefully, &ldquo;as you&rsquo;d make Old Nick  squirm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,  but I am rather tired of costermonger compliments. Come to business. You accuse  me of being mixed up in a conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t it true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  gospel, between ourselves. To the world it is a lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I bet  you can&rsquo;t prove &lsquo;tis so,&rdquo; sneered the sailor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proof  is not required. Denial is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  when I&rsquo;m in th&rsquo; witness-box.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  when you&rsquo;re in the dock, you mean, my good man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  visitor grew purple. &ldquo;Me&mdash;in th&rsquo; dock!&rdquo; he thundered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lower  your voice, please, or I shall order my servants to turn you out. Yes&mdash;in the  dock, your natural place. This conspiracy of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Engineered  for your little game, mind,&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I have nothing to do with it&rdquo;; her hard eyes held him as he blankly  considered her astonishing impudence. &ldquo;You tell me that Dr. Demetrius buried a  man at Funchal in place of Mr. Garth, and then, when Mr. Garth died on board  your ship, sent home his body as that of my husband. As Mr. Garth and my  husband resembled one another closely, I can see how I and the family were  mistaken when we beheld the substituted corpse. But I do not understand why my  husband should have consented to this, no more than I understand how you dare  accuse me of conspiring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I do, you bet, ma&rsquo;am. You played low down on a company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is your proof?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  got the dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  played a bold stroke. &ldquo;Ignorant that the money was paid under false pretences.  It shall be given back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Strange  turned white and jumped up. &ldquo;My share!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing of your share. Apparently, Dr. Demetrius, who happened to&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;admire  me, kidnapped my husband in order that I might think myself free to marry him,&mdash;a  thing,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, with scorn, &ldquo;which could never&mdash;never have occurred. It  seems that my husband was taken away by you and Dr. Demetrius against his will.  I shall communicate with him, now that I know he is alive. Oh, I assure you,  search shall be made, Captain Strange, and the money&mdash;every penny&mdash;shall be paid  back to the defrauded insurance company. As for you&mdash;blackmailing hound and  bully and coward, the law shall punish you&rdquo;; and she, daring greatly, was again  about to touch the bell.</p>
  <p>Several  times during this clever explanation Strange had gasped and sworn softly,  almost helpless with rage. But by the time she ended his anger had cooled, and  he was regarding her with profound admiration. Her astonishing boldness, her  dexterous turning of facts into fiction and fiction into facts, and the  unbroken nerve which she displayed when at bay, commanded his respect.  Unknowingly he fell into line with M. Aksakoff, and rendered homage to superior  wickedness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  shoot, colonel, I&rsquo;ll climb down,&rdquo; said he, collapsing.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim, knowing the old &lsquo;possum story, laughed and withdrew her hand, secretly  relieved that he had not dared her to press the button. &ldquo;Ah, now you talk  reason, Captain Strange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  bet I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to,&rdquo; he retorted bluntly. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;ve played your hand fur all you&rsquo;re  worth, an&rsquo; mighty prettily bluffed it is. But I guess&rdquo;&mdash;he swung back in his  chair largely&mdash;&ldquo;I guess I hold the ace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do?&rdquo; She eyed him uneasily, for he appeared to be much cooler than she approved  of. &ldquo;And the ace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;  Leah started forward, grasping the arms of her chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;  grunted Strange. &ldquo;I thought you gilded bummers were allays lords an&rsquo; ladies t&rsquo;  one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;  she repeated blankly. &ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  bet. Kidnappin&rsquo; wos th&rsquo; word I used, an&rsquo; kidnappin&rsquo; it is. Thet there Berrin&rsquo;,  your husband, sailin&rsquo; under false colours, come along with me to Buenos Ayres&mdash;there&rsquo;s  no denying thet. But&rdquo;&mdash;here the freebooter winked significantly&mdash;&ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t git  set ashore there. Oh no, not much, you bet. I gummed on t&rsquo; him as m&rsquo; ace till I  landed stakes. He don&rsquo;t mind, bless y&rsquo;&mdash;likes the life wonderful. We&rsquo;ve bin  gavortin&rsquo; round Pacific waters fur months, till the dollars ran low. Then I  brought the barkey nor&rsquo;ard with him under hatches, and naow&rdquo;&mdash;he stretched out a  huge paw&mdash;&ldquo;y&rsquo; kin pass along thet ten thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  brain was working so hard that she scarcely heard half the speech. At the back  of it she began to see possibilities. &ldquo;My husband is in England, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Within  reach, anyhow, and with my first mate hangin&rsquo; on t&rsquo; him. Maybe the barkey  anchors in a French port. Might be Spanish fur choice, if y&rsquo; like&mdash;there&rsquo;s no  knowin&rsquo;. But he&rsquo;s within hail, same as them coppers of yours. The ace, ma&rsquo;am,  the ace. Y&rsquo; might put in a day arskin&rsquo; me why I let him go at ten thousand  dollars. Th&rsquo; hull shoot is worth heaps an&rsquo; heaps more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  watched his face closely. &ldquo;Worth five thousand pounds, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he drawled, equally watchful; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind goin&rsquo; nap on that, all things  being on th&rsquo; square. Naow if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!  Wait, I tell you!&rdquo; She clasped her hands across her forehead and paced the room  with slow steps, which did not betray the nervous hurry of her overwrought  brain.</p>
  <p>Strange  watched her, as a naturalist might watch an entirely new animal. Clever and  hard as he was in his bullying way, he felt instinctively that he had little  chance of getting the better of this woman, unless&mdash;as he phrased it&mdash;he kept his  tail up. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the dandiest devil I ever sot eyes on,&rdquo; was his admiring  verdict. &ldquo;Golly, wot a flyer! Huh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim, twisting her hands distressfully, strolled slowly up and down, with bent  head and thoughtful looks. At times she would halt and reflect deeply; then her  face would brighten as she resumed her prowling. Sometimes she glanced at  Strange, sitting like a graven image in his chair, and occasionally she peered  into any near mirror as if to seek inspiration from her own wicked eyes. For  ten minutes amidst a petrifying silence she behaved thus; then, having solved  part of her problem&mdash;the solution of the other part depended upon Strange&rsquo;s  consent&mdash;she returned to face him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mind imprisonment?&rdquo; she asked casually.</p>
  <p>The  sailor jumped. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; begin agin?&rdquo; he demanded irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Answer  my question. Do you mind imprisonment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t, accordin&rsquo; to th&rsquo; dollars. Give it a name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five  thousand, States currency,&rdquo; mused the captain. &ldquo;Y wish me t&rsquo; sample one of your  gaols fur thet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  nodded. &ldquo;On charges of conspiracy and blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Strange  jumped again. &ldquo;My gun! D&rsquo;y&rsquo; intend t&rsquo; advertise th&rsquo; circus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  intend to have my husband set free to enjoy his own. Since you have kidnapped  him, you shall confess and suffer&mdash;for five thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leavin&rsquo;  you out, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I had nothing to do with it, nor had my poor husband. You and Dr. Demetrius are  the rascals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!  An&rsquo; what&rsquo;ll y&rsquo; pay the Doc.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  she said serenely: &ldquo;the Russian Government is paying him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  Strange whistled with a stare; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got him at las&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you mean the Russian authorities, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  chap! He wasn&rsquo;t bad fur a foreiner. I kind o&rsquo; froze on t&rsquo; him somehow. But this  catchy-catchy biznai ain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; mine, so let him slide.&rdquo; He shook his head  vigorously. &ldquo;Slide it is. An&rsquo; this noo game o&rsquo; yours, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bending  forward, until her mouth was almost at his right ear, she explained a very  pretty scheme, which would oust Lionel and restore Jim&rsquo;s birthright, without  inculpating her.</p>
  <p>Strange  listened calmly, and nodded heavy approval at intervals. All the time  admiration deepened in his hard eyes, but this did not prevent him bargaining. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said he, balancing his hat carefully. &ldquo;It kin be done. Six thousand, ain&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Six!&rdquo;  he insisted.</p>
  <p>So  much was at stake that Leah yielded. She could afford to do so, with fifty  thousand a year in prospect. &ldquo;Six, then&mdash;to be paid when you leave prison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!  An&rsquo; when might that be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  should I know?&rdquo; said Lady Jim, crossly, for the strain on her nerves was great.  &ldquo;Ask some lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blackmail  an&rsquo; conspiracy,&rdquo; murmured Strange, reflectively. &ldquo;Sounds like a few years of  oakum-pickin&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t it? Not as I intend to give my opinion on these British  gaols. Sing-sing&rsquo;s good enough fur me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  you mind, ma&rsquo;am. But if the dollars ain&rsquo;t planked down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will be. Can&rsquo;t you trust me, man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess not. You&rsquo;re what I call a holy terror, an&rsquo; no mistake. Firmingham, y&rsquo;  said&mdash;Firmingham.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nailed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  will you go down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arter  I&rsquo;ve seen thet land-shark &lsquo;bout the kind of poppy-cock th&rsquo; bloomin&rsquo; judge ull  talk. Go slow, ma&rsquo;am; y&rsquo; git along with your share, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do mine. So long!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  did not like to grasp the tarry hand extended, but out of diplomacy she was  forced to touch the pitch which was defiling her. &ldquo;I can depend upon you,  Captain Strange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  nodded. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; kin let it go at thet. So long, agin. An&rsquo; if I&rsquo;d married you,&rdquo; he  added, with genuine emotion, &ldquo;cuss me if I wouldn&rsquo;t hev bin runnin&rsquo; the U.S.A.  in th&rsquo; Presidential Chair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  digested this compliment at her leisure.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_28"></a>Chapter 28</b> </h2>
  <p>After  that momentous interview Lady Jim realised the truth of Strange&rsquo;s scriptural  quotation, although he had translated it into his own lax vernacular.  Unfortunately, hearing it after the event, she could not take Isaiah&rsquo;s advice,  and had too hastily condemned the fetish. She would have given much for the  recovery of that precise peacock&rsquo;s feather, for, having freely thrown it away,  it was doubtful to her superstitious mind if the luck would hold. Certainly she  had arranged judiciously for Jim&rsquo;s return to civilisation, and the unscrupulous  captain appeared willing to earn wages as a scapegoat; but there was always the  unforeseen to be reckoned with. A chance word, a chance discovery, a too minute  inquiry&mdash;these might wreck the whole scheme, and she would reap a whirlwind,  stormy enough to sweep her out of a social paradise into the bleak desert of  Sinners-found-out. A most uncomfortable locality.</p>
  <p>She  did what she could, poor woman, to propitiate her Baal. A new peacock&rsquo;s feather  was procured, and she apologised for her want of faith. Also she experimented  with the new symbol. Would a particular costume arrive at a certain hour? Would  some very doubtful stock which she held turn honest? Would Captain Strange,  after consulting a lawyer, still hold to his nefarious bargain? The test proved  satisfactory, for her Baal, apparently amenable to apology, worked excellently  through the new semblance of his deity. The dress duly arrived within the fixed  time; the shares rose rapidly, and enabled her to sell at a profit which she  did not deserve; finally, a grubby note from Strange assured her without detail  that he was on his way to Firmingham. It would seem that the prospect of  picking oakum for a livelihood appealed to him, at the agreed price.</p>
  <p>Pending  the explosion of the mine to which Strange was about to apply a match, Leah  possessed her soul in patience. Three days did she wait, and they were days of  purgatory. For obvious reasons she did not return to Firmingham, but wrote to  Lionel stating that she had received a terrible shock&mdash;nature not mentioned&mdash;and  intended to consult the family solicitors about the same. She thus made herself  safe about the sailor&rsquo;s visit, in case any one might wonder why he had come to  her in the first instance. And in the letter she told the truth for once, since  she paid a visit to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. An explanation of her errand startled  the suave head of a justly celebrated legal firm. On recovering from pardonable  amazement he gave his client the full value of her six-and-eightpence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kidnapping,&rdquo;  explained Mr. Hall, to a tearful listener&mdash;for Lady Jim thought that the  circumstances demanded emotion&mdash;&ldquo;is not in itself a serious offence, and really  applies only to persons under fourteen years of age. In the case of an adult  like Lord James this sailor would be punished with&mdash;er&mdash;maybe two years&rsquo;  imprisonment. He might even be let off with a heavy fine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah&rsquo;s  face fell considerably. She would have to pay that fine, and did not relish  parting with more money. &ldquo;How interesting!&rdquo; she murmured vaguely, and waited  for further information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blackmail,  however,&rdquo; pursued the lawyer, emphatically, &ldquo;is a very grave offence, and can  be punished with five years&rsquo; imprisonment, involving penal servitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would be better,&rdquo; agreed Lady Jim, thinking that Strange at hard labour would  earn one thousand a year and have an extra thousand over when his term was  ended. A profitable imprisonment for him, truly, she reflected, and extremely  costly for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  again, Lady James, if the offence s committed by letter, sentence for life can  be passed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he didn&rsquo;t write,&rdquo; she said hastily, and congratulated herself that Strange had  not done so, since, even for so many thousands, he would not be inclined to  remain a prisoner for ever; &ldquo;but perhaps Mr. Kaimes may receive a letter. The  man hinted that he would try in that quarter, seeing that I would not yield to  his extortion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should have had him arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had not my wits about me. He would have shot me had I summoned the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  me, Lady James, had he a weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  revolver,&rdquo; she replied, unscrupulously; &ldquo;so you can see how I&mdash;a poor weak woman&mdash;was  intimidated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will add to his sentence,&rdquo; said Mr. Hall, upon which she wished she had checked  her imagination. It would be foolish to push Strange into a corner, for as yet  she could not reckon the exact power of his greed. However, she could not unsay  what she had said, and nothing remained but to pray to the fetish and hope for  the best.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Duke must be warned,&rdquo; went on Mr. Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;  asked Leah, just as sharply as she had asked Colley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  new Duke&mdash;I beg your pardon, for, of course, if this story is true, Lord James  is the Duke of Pentland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  doubt the story, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hall  raised his eyebrows and shook his head. &ldquo;I cannot give an opinion until I have  seen this man and sifted his statements.&rdquo; He paused and looked at her  inquiringly. &ldquo;I presume, Lady James, that this man closely resembles your  husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  man? Oh, Garth&mdash;yes. You may guess how closely, when the late Duke, Lord Frith,  and myself were all deceived. Certainly the likeness was well known in  Firmingham. There were reasons,&rdquo; she added with hesitation&mdash;&ldquo;family reasons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;quite  so.&rdquo; Mr. Hall, who knew something of the Adamite side of his late Grace,  coughed away a laugh. &ldquo;I can see how the mistake arose, Lady James. Natural  enough&mdash;oh, dear me&mdash;natural enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you not give me my proper title?&rdquo; she asked haughtily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, but the truth of this man&rsquo;s wild story has yet to be proved. May I ask a  few needful questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  wave of her hand signified that he might, and she submitted to a tolerably  stiff examination. Being prepared with artless answers to every question, she  emerged triumphantly from the ordeal, and when in possession of <i>her</i> facts, Mr. Hall subscribed to the wickedness of Demetrius and Strange. &ldquo;A pair  of villains, my dear lady. The one sinned for love and the other from avarice;  astonishing whither those passions lead us&mdash;astonishing. Well, well, we must  hope. I trust, for your ladyship&rsquo;s sake, that the story is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I,&rdquo; wept Leah, producing her handkerchief. &ldquo;Not for the sake of the title or  the money, dear Mr. Hall, but because my poor husband&mdash;Oh&mdash;&rdquo;here she skilfully  broke down, for want of something to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray  calm yourself, Lady James. Let us hope that in a few days I shall be able to  address you as the Duchess of Pentland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me back my husband&mdash;I ask no more,&rdquo; was her magnanimous reply.</p>
  <p>And  while driving to Curzon Street she reflected how very magnanimous it really  was, seeing that she had no wish for Jim&rsquo;s company. To be tied to that log  again was scarcely worth the income. Besides, Jim, who had no sense of decency,  would assuredly laugh his loudest at the thought of her unnecessary trouble. He  would not even thank her for giving him his rights, although he must know that  it was sorely against the grain for her to put up with his boring society. But  in spite of Jim&rsquo;s probable ingratitude, she would behave as his wife&mdash;as the  lenient woman she felt herself to be. Certainly her common sense recognised  that he was returning from his sham grave with gifts in his hands, but of those  she was the giver. And, seeing that she could betray his share in the  conspiracy without inculpating herself, Leah foresaw the possession of  limitless power to enforce obedience. That power she resolved to utilise for  the purpose of getting her own unfettered way, and all the money she required  for contemplated extravagances. Also, she intended to stop Jim&rsquo;s illicit  flirtations. Now that he was a peer of the realm he would have &ldquo;to purge and  live cleanly,&rdquo; after the fashion of one Sir John Falstaff, Knight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  owe that much to society,&rdquo; thought Leah, virtuously, and considered the  rumoured doings of black sheep who would be cast out of the Mayfair fold were  their housetops removed. That the shifting of the Curzon Street mansion tiles  might also be attended with danger she did not pause to consider.</p>
  <p>On  the ensuing afternoon Askew arrived to say farewell; but, as circumstances were  too embarrassing to permit of her taking any interest in other people&rsquo;s  affairs, she declined to see him. Nevertheless, he urged a personal interview,  on the plea that he would be absent for months. She yielded very unwillingly,  as her nerves clamoured for some outward sign of emotion, which by the rules of  society she would be obliged to suppress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know I shall be horribly rude,&rdquo; murmured Lady Jim, when the footman left the  room to introduce the visitor; &ldquo;but he has brought it on himself&rdquo;&mdash;which excuse  she considered ample for ensuing impoliteness.</p>
  <p>Askew,  with mistaken consideration, entered the drawing-room almost on tiptoe, and  proceeded forthwith to condole with her in stage whispers. She soon put a stop  to this artificial sympathy. Further reference to life beyond the grave she  could not and would not stand, as she told him crisply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk funeral, unless you wish to see me wreck the room. I have had months of  crying and crape and condoling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the sad circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  such that I did not wish to see you,&rdquo; she retorted, finishing his sentences for  him as usual, after her old fashion. &ldquo;I feel so scratchy that I declined your  visit out of sheer pity. But you would insist, so don&rsquo;t blame me if I am  disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can never be disagreeable,&rdquo; said Askew, soothingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  I? You wait ten minutes and see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I had better go, Lady Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  your own sake, I think you had. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  still kept his seat. &ldquo;I only wish to say that I am very&mdash;very sorry for your  terrible loss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Frith&rsquo;s terrible loss, you mean. Go and see her, if you want to play the hired  mourner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  poor Lady Frith&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  don&rsquo;t begin about her,&rdquo; snapped Leah, viciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you must be sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am&mdash;for myself. I have been dosed with the post-mortem virtues of those three  Kaimes men until I feel that only wicked people are truly agreeable. I regret  the Duke, who was a nice old sinner turned saint, and I lament Lord Frith for  his goodness and sweetness of disposition&mdash;there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never heard that Lord Frith had a sweet disposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  hadn&rsquo;t; but I&rsquo;m only saying the kind of things you expect me to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Askew looked shocked. &ldquo;Have the&mdash;er&mdash;bodies been found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so; but you can ask the executors who look after these things. Any  more questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  only I am sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said that before. You are sorry, I am sorry, we are sorry. I think that  conjugation exhausts the subject. Let us talk of your yacht, Mr. Askew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; he murmured, confused. It was difficult to comprehend this woman,  who so lightly dropped a family sorrow to take on a subject which he knew  interested her but little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when do you sail?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow  or next day. I came to say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Leah, carelessly. &ldquo;I fancied you came to sympathise. Well&rdquo;&mdash;she rose and  extended her hand&mdash;&ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Askew  clasped her hand coldly, wondering how he ever came to love so heartless a  woman. As Jim was returning in glory and had not seen Se&ntilde;orita Fajardo since  his reported death, Leah felt that she could safely dismiss this boy, to go  where he would. Besides, she was beginning to find him a bore. He took things  much too seriously, and was by no means so good-looking as she had imagined.  All the same, after the manner of woman, who wants to have her pie and eat it,  she by no means approved of his readiness to depart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t seem to care much,&rdquo; she said reproachfully, and felt quite ill-used.</p>
  <p>Askew  coloured boyishly. &ldquo;I am not broken-hearted, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not believe that you have a heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right&mdash;it is at Rosario.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I advise you to go after it, lest it should get mixed up with other men&rsquo;s  hearts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lola  is no flirt,&rdquo; cried Askew, loyally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she must be altogether too good for this world. Good-bye! Bring Mrs. Askew to  see me when you return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear you would be bored with her,&rdquo; said he, sore and sarcastic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably.  Married women are not interesting, except to people like you and Jim, who  persistently break the tenth commandment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know one married woman who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  has just said good-bye to you, and repeats it,&rdquo; snapped Lady Jim, seeing he was  about to be rude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well, then, good-bye,&rdquo; said Askew, going out in a rage with her and with  himself. And so they parted.</p>
  <p>Leah  returned smiling to her seat, delighted that she made him lose his temper, as  by doing so she had recovered her own. It was so satisfactory to a deserted  woman to think that a man whose love had cooled should go away uncomfortable. &ldquo;And  what a mercy he is gone,&rdquo; said Lady Jim, settling to read fashions. &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll  stop in America with that Lola creature for the rest of his silly life. I  suppose he won&rsquo;t turn over this page of his book of life, but tear it out.&rdquo; And  in this she was perfectly right. He did.</p>
  <p>Towards  five o&rsquo;clock Lionel arrived. Although she had no intimation of his coming, she  quite expected to see him, and was prepared to make any necessary scene. The  young clergyman looked white and excited, entering the room so rapidly that the  footman had hardly time to announce the title that he was losing.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim, recognising a crisis, came forward rapidly with studied emotion. &ldquo;You know  all&mdash;all,&rdquo; she said in a choking voice, and caught his hands.</p>
  <p>He  was taken aback. &ldquo;Yes, if you mean that your husband lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true, then&mdash;it is true&rdquo;; she tottered to the sofa, and cast herself down with  passionate emotion. &ldquo;Say that it is true!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. But how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  sat up with a puzzled look. &ldquo;Did you not get my letter saying that I had had a  shock, and intended to consult Mr. Hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but you did not explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not, seeing the position it places you in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind me. If Jim is alive, he takes the title. So this man came to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did, and tried to extort money. Because I refused he hinted that he would buy  your silence. I never thought that he would dare to go to Firmingham; but when  you entered, a look told me all. But can you believe this story&mdash;it seems  incredible?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police do not think so,&rdquo; said Lionel, grimly.</p>
  <p>Lady  Jim dropped on to the sofa again. &ldquo;The police!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. This scoundrel came to Firmingham, and said that if I gave him three  thousand pounds he would keep Jim away from England so that I could enjoy the  title. I learned the truth about this conspiracy of Dr. Demetrius, and then had  Captain Strange arrested. To-day a policeman brought him to London. He is in  prison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Serve  him right, the brute. Did he not tell you how he threatened me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I never guessed that he had come to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he did, and said that if I gave him two thousand pounds he would bring Jim  back. Failing me, he tried you at a higher price. I should have had him  arrested, Mr. Hall says, but I could not. I was bewildered&mdash;quite bewildered. It  seems incredible. Oh, Lionel,&rdquo;&mdash;she laid her hand imploringly on his sleeve&mdash;&ldquo;surely  Demetrius did not behave so vilely!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear that he did. The man, as every one in London knows, was madly in love with  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never encouraged him&mdash;really I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Lionel, bluntly. &ldquo;I do not think he was rich enough for you to encourage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can you think so badly of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you are all self&mdash;you admitted that long ago. To do you justice, I think you  were a good wife to Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> a good wife. Don&rsquo;t make me out to be the widow I am not. Of course, this story  must be false,&rdquo; she ended, helplessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think not&mdash;it is too circumstantial. And moreover, this man, who appears to be  illiterate, could not invent such a tale. Plainly the Russian, who seemed to be  clever, conspired to get rid of Jim, so that you might be induced to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  though I would ever do such a thing! I told you at Firmingham that I had no  intention of marrying. I daresay Jim and I will come together again, and be  very happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so&mdash;I trust so,&rdquo; said Lionel, with solemn emphasis. &ldquo;Remember, God is  giving you another chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  made very good use of the last one,&rdquo; she retorted sullenly. &ldquo;Jim was always to  blame, and not I. I suppose this insurance money will have to be given back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  You can hardly complain of that, seeing the income you will now receive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim  will, you mean. I expect he&rsquo;ll turn out a screw now that he is rich. Your  spendthrifts are always old misers. And I don&rsquo;t see why you should be nasty. I&rsquo;m  sure I have had a miserable time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have a happy one now,&rdquo; he said, relenting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  Jim?&rdquo; she cried derisively. &ldquo;How optimistic you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  I have a right to be, when God is so good to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo;  she echoed, vaguely, and thinking of the obliging fetish. &ldquo;Oh yes, of course. I&rsquo;m  awfully thankful. The insurance money would not have lasted for ever, and I  might not have found so manageable a husband as Jim. Things will be jolly now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  groaned. &ldquo;Is that as high as you can rise?&rdquo; he asked, rebukingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord, what do you want me to say?&rdquo; cried Leah, with the causeless anger of the  overwrought. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of pious proverbs when I am like this. What with  supposed deaths and real deaths, and nothing but funerals to amuse one, I don&rsquo;t  know if I am on my head or my heels. There, that&rsquo;s vulgar, and you needn&rsquo;t look  disgusted if it is. I feel vulgar. I could run out and howl up and down Curzon  Street like a Whitechapel woman in a tantrum. And if you preach,&mdash;if you&mdash;you&mdash;  Oh, what fools men are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  choked, rolled in her chair, ripped a handkerchief, and kicked away a  foot-stool.</p>
  <p>The  curate&mdash;as he was once more&mdash;saw how she tried to fight down the hysteria, and  wisely refrained from speech. A single word might cause the primitive emotions  to burst with volcanic force through the imposed customs of civilisation.  Considering the joyful news of Jim Kaimes&rsquo; resurrection and the trouble of the  attempted blackmail, it was natural that she should suddenly betray feminine  weakness. She was but a woman when all was said and done. Leah would have  repudiated this conclusion with scorn, as she had small regard for her sex; but  a woman she was at the moment, unstrung, foolish, wild with dread that the  unforeseen might happen. Lionel moved silently to the door. In a moment she was  at his side, reaching him with the bound of a pantheress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be angry,&rdquo; she panted, laying her hand on his arm; &ldquo;but you do worry me so, and  if you knew&mdash;if you really knew&mdash;&rdquo; She gasped and bit her lip, to prevent an  unguarded tongue blurting out the whole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  there!&rdquo; He patted her hand, and she could have slapped him for the caress,  which revealed his knowledge of her weakness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right&mdash;all right. Be  calm! There, there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord, what tact!&rdquo; and so disgusted was she with the stupidity of the man that  her nerves relaxed &ldquo;I say, Lionel,&rdquo; with an artificial laugh, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you sorry  for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in the least,&rdquo; he replied promptly. &ldquo;I am no Jacob to usurp the heritage of  Esau. High or low, we can all serve God in our degrees. Ask Jim to make me  vicar of Firmingham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will, if you promise not to preach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  would you have me earn my salary, then?&rdquo; he asked humorously, and glad that she  appeared more composed. &ldquo;Now I advise you to lie down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she assented submissively; &ldquo;I will lie down. And you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  go at once to see Mr. Hall, about getting Jim set free. Good-bye, Duchess&rdquo;; and  in a moment he was gone, anxious to escape further irresponsible speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Duchess!&rdquo;  echoed Leah, staring at the closed door. &ldquo;Duchess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was all right then, so far as Lionel was concerned, seeing that he gave her the  title which Mr. Hall withheld. He at least believed in the wonderful story of  Strange. With Lionel on her side things would be bound to come out all right.  Still, although the trees were thinning, she was not yet out of the wood. The  green light of safety had not yet been substituted for the red danger signal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am aching all over,&rdquo; said Leah, addressing her reflection in the mirror; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s  a twist of nerves between my eyes, and I could scream the house down. But I  shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She flung away from the glass, gripping her courage with both hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be calm, and easy in my mind, till Jim comes back. When the worst is over, I  shall collapse&mdash;I know I shall. Till then&mdash;till then&mdash;Oh, God&rdquo;&mdash;the weakness she  declined to recognise broke forth in prayer&mdash;&ldquo;give me grit and pluck to fight  through to the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  she prayed, but not to the fetish. In this uplifted moment Leah felt that  Lionel&rsquo;s Deity was not a myth, but a terrible reality.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_29"></a>Chapter 29</b> </h2>
  <p>Then  did &ldquo;Rumour, painted full of tongues,&rdquo; enter into Lady Jim&rsquo;s strictly private  life and depart with half-truths for the bewildering of gossips. In some  marvellous way the news leaked out, as news will, despite careful caulking of  the human vessels containing it. Lord James Kaimes, ran the babble, had been  kidnapped by his medical attendant, who, substituting an illegal corpse for  that of the husband he wished to supplant, had plotted to secure the wife. This  was the tune, correct enough; then came its variations. The hurdy-gurdy of  society ground out wonderful twiddles and twists of false notes, distorting the  original theme into a melody Leah herself would not have recognised. Not that  she heard any of the <i>fiortura</i>. Prudence counselled a retreat to  Firmingham pending the home-coming of Jim, and thither, very wisely, she went.  At this crisis of her fortunes Lady Jim felt that she required the countenance  of all truly respectable people, however dull, and therefore sheltered like a  maltreated chick under Hilda Frith&rsquo;s wing. To console the widowed and orphaned  was her obvious excuse,&mdash;so obvious, indeed, that she declined to make it. Thus  did she escape questions about the one engrossing topic of drawing-room, club,  and public-house bar.</p>
  <p>Every  one, from the lowest to the highest, talked exhaustively, and the newspapers,  cheap and costly, printed scandal with alluring recklessness. Out of London  E.C. issued halfpenny journals with lurid headings over incomplete histories of  the plot, invented on unsound premises. These transparent fictions began with  the Russian&rsquo;s snake-in-the-grass intrusion into the happy home of an attached  couple, and ended with a political cry for the exclusion of such immoral aliens  from the Island of the Blest, which is England. The more expensive small-beer  chronicles refused to believe that so fantastic an occurrence could have  happened in these enlightened days of police-courts and publicity; but,  nevertheless, supplied middle-class breakfast-tables with equally doubtful  data, out of which to weave romances of the minor peerage. &ldquo;The triangle of  Dumas the younger,&rdquo; cried one scribe, with a fine disregard for meaning and  metaphor, &ldquo;must never be sounded in our dear Motherland!&rdquo; A sufficient sample  this of the stuff supplied. But, since the silly season prevailed when  reporters, one and all, were credited with March-hare madness, such  incongruities were pardoned, and the public gaped to swallow full-sized camels.</p>
  <p>The  clubs buzzed like hives at swarming time, for their members wondered at Jim&rsquo;s  adventure; wondered, also, how &ldquo;so knowing a Johnny&rdquo;&mdash;so they put it&mdash;&ldquo;could  allow himself to be diddled by a measly little foreign beast.&rdquo; All were agog  for the hero&rsquo;s appearance, and curious friends thirsted for a first-hand  account of the enforced Odyssey. Many speculated as to the probability of Jim  being sobered by untoward experience into becoming a truly respectable Duke,  and a few made original observations anent a much-quoted leopard and his  unchangeable spots. In this way was the statement that men are not born gossips  contradicted, for the Eveless Edens of St. James&rsquo;s Street, Pall Mall, and  Piccadilly resembled a village sewing-class in mid-career.</p>
  <p>The  drawing-rooms, as was natural, interested themselves chiefly in Leah, and  chafed that she should become an unexpected Duchess. Hitherto Lady Jim&rsquo;s  skilful man&oelig;uvring had saved her reputation, but, as animals fall upon the  wounded of their kind, so did the pack of hounds she had never hunted with  fling itself forward, full-voiced and open-mouthed. Rejoicing women cried her  sins on the housetop with surprising details. She must have encouraged Dr.  Demetrius shamefully, else he never would have gone to such lengths, though why  he should do so for such a woman it was impossible to understand. They had  never admired her, said the pure-minded, and had always suspected her of being  no better than she should be. Poor Mr. Askew, too: had she not put an end to a  family matrimonial arrangement by her arts; had she not inveigled him to Paris  in the hope that he would marry her in haste to repent at leisure? Certainly,  aware of her character before it was too late, he had sailed to the South Pole  or the North Pole, or to somewhere she could not follow, as she was certainly  dying to do. Her vanity was insatiable. She had flirted quite indecently with  Sir Billy Richardson, though he was but an infant lately breeched. Julia  Hengist had only snatched her lord from the claws of this harpy by the merest,  the very merest, chance. And the money she wasted! Oh! Why, the bailiffs had  twice and thrice been in the Curzon Street house. Also, she was so lucky at  bridge that she assuredly must cheat, and it showed what a blackleg she was,  that no one had ever caught her cheating. Then her dresses were ridiculous for  a woman with her poor husband&rsquo;s income. She had ruined him completely&mdash;that was  why he ran away, in a dying condition. And the money had not gone to discharge  lawful debts; she never paid anything, therefore she must have spent the cash  on some secret vice, which she certainly must have, since she always posed as  being so very correct. She ought to be cut; she ought to be in gaol; whipping  was too good for her; put her in a pillory and throw stones at her. And let  such a creature be anathema maranatha for ever and ever and ever, Amen.</p>
  <p>But  for all this throwing of stones by ladies who were without sin, Leah had her  supporters in some, who must have been wicked, since they declined to condemn  her wholesale on hearsay evidence. These pointed out that she had behaved  admirably, when Jim&rsquo;s supposed death had been reported. The late Marquis of  Frith was himself deceived by the likeness of the corpse to his brother, though  of course there were family reasons for such a likeness. Also, the old Duke had  paid the Curzon Street debts, which so good a man would not have done had they  been of a questionable character. And the very respectable Hengists, kind  things, spoke highly of Lady Jim&rsquo;s patience under trying domestic difficulties  caused by an unfaithful husband. Besides, Leah&mdash;poor, dear, persecuted woman&mdash;was  now the Duchess of Pentland, and could do no wrong. She was a misunderstood  angel. Hilda Frith doted on her, and every one knew how very, very particular  Hilda Frith was. To decry a woman who had suffered so much, and who had so  nobly borne suffering, was a crime&mdash;worse, was a blunder, seeing that the latest  Duchess would assuredly sway society, to bless or damn at her good pleasure.  The peerage&mdash;the immaculate peerage of Great Britain and Ireland&mdash;would stand or  fall by Leah Pentland, as a perfect example of what a titled woman should be.</p>
  <p>In  this way raged the war of tongues, while Lionel, in Mr. Hall&rsquo;s company, and  with the assistance of Scotland Yard officials, sought for the missing  prodigal. Strange, playing the game with characteristic stubbornness, refused  to indicate the whereabouts of his victim&rsquo;s floating prison, and, as the <i>Stormy  Petrel</i> under a new coat of paint, with readjusted rigging and bearing a  prettier but unknown name, could not be found in any shipping list, there  appeared little prospect of finding the kidnapped. The telegraph wires sizzled  in the air and under the sea, with messages to home and foreign ports; bills  with Jim&rsquo;s portrait and a most flattering description were scattered broadcast;  a reward large enough to tempt Mammon himself was offered in every journal, and  in many languages; and the journals themselves denounced the police authorities&mdash;who  were merely mortal, poor scapegoats&mdash;for not producing a mislaid nobleman in  five minutes. It was an enjoyable time for armchair critics, who, on  insufficient evidence, knew exactly what should be done, and blamed the police,  confronted with hard facts, for not doing it.</p>
  <p>As  to the culprit, he might have been Nero, Judas Iscariot, and Captain Dreyfus  rolled into one, from the obliquity which was heaped upon him. Since he refused  to produce his prisoner, inquisitive people were frantic with annoyance. One  enthusiast even suggested that torture should be used to make him speak;  another considered that so recalcitrant a brute should be starved into  submission; a third that he should be offered a free pardon on condition that  he sent back a regretted Duke to his lonely wife. But Strange, chuckling over  the storm he had raised, hugged his secret close. Hall, the ducal lawyer, knew  what his terms were, and if Hall did not choose to accede he would have to  remain without an aristocratic client.</p>
  <p>Hall,  however, had no notion of losing the money with which the accession of Lord  James Kaimes to a wealthy title would probably fill his pockets. Still, Strange&rsquo;s  terms were too preposterous to consider for one moment. He had to consider them  for a fortnight, all the same, and finding that they did not vary, he came down  to consult Lady Jim, after a lengthy interview with the Rev. Lionel Kaimes at  Lambeth.</p>
  <p>Even  though Jim had risen from the dead, Leah had not laid aside her mourning.  Indeed, she added fresh crape to show her grief for the recent deaths, and  greeted the lawyer with the air of one to whom life is a burden. And so it was  to her, at the moment. The funereal atmosphere of the great house, the delicacy  of her position until Jim returned to tell her that all was safe, and the  constant boredom of listening to Hilda&rsquo;s wordy lamentations&mdash;these things wore  her out, and Mr. Hall noted that she looked fatigued.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Natural,  very natural,&rdquo; thought Mr. Hall, unfortunately aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is natural?&rdquo; asked Leah, seeing his eyes on her.</p>
  <p>The  man&rsquo;s parchment cheeks reddened. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Duchess. I did not intend  to speak aloud; a trick of mine, when I am interested. Bad habit&mdash;bad habit. I  was thinking that you looked weary&mdash;natural, very natural.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weary!&rdquo;  Leah placed her elbows on the table which stood between them. &ldquo;I tell you what,  Mr. Hall: unless you bring my husband back soon, I shall take to drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My&mdash;dear&mdash;Duchess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  and don&rsquo;t men take to drink when they are worried? What better can a poor woman  do than imitate the lords of creation? You are so inconsistent. What about my  particular lord? Has that beast spoken out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He refuses to speak save on his own terms, which are, I may say, preposterous&mdash;extremely  so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  thought of the price to be paid for the imprisonment Strange was now  undergoing, and smiled dryly. &ldquo;He is the kind of man who would ask for the sun&mdash;and  get it,&rdquo; she added, as an afterthought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether  he gets it is for you to determine, Duchess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  She looked at him sharply. &ldquo;Am I to arbitrate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so&mdash;quite so. A very well-chosen word&mdash;arbitrate.&rdquo; He chuckled heartily, and  adjusted his pince-nez.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the joke, Mr. Hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might almost be one, Duchess, so preposterous is the demand of this man. He  refuses to reveal the whereabouts of his Grace, unless&mdash;prepare yourself for a  surprise&mdash;unless he is set free. Now then, Duchess&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Hall threw himself back  in his chair, and flung open his frock-coat&mdash;&ldquo;is that not pre&mdash;pos&mdash;ter&mdash;ous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t see it myself,&rdquo; replied Leah, coolly. &ldquo;He seems to be a very sensible  man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;he  ought to be punished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear he would not agree with you there. Is this what you have come to see me  about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  All attempts to find the Duke have been made in vain: the resources of  civilisation are exhausted. Only one thing remains&mdash;to accede to the prisoner&rsquo;s  terms. I saw the Reverend Lionel Kaimes, and he agrees not to prosecute. Now I  come to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  ask me not to prosecute?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly&mdash;exactly.  The man attempted to blackmail you and the Reverend Mr. Kaimes. If neither one  of you will prosecute, the magistrate will be obliged to dismiss the case for  want of evidence. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Captain Strange&mdash;that is his name, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;will send Jim back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  question it&mdash;I question it. Once free, he may again attempt to blackmail&mdash;that  is, he may refuse to surrender his prisoner without money being paid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not agree with you,&rdquo; said Leah, mendaciously. &ldquo;The man has had a fright, and  will not trust himself again into the lion&rsquo;s mouth. Besides, even if he did try  to blackmail, we could refuse, and he can&rsquo;t keep my husband for ever on board  his dirty little boat. A prisoner who cannot be ransomed would be expensive to  keep. Jim has an enormous appetite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hall  smiled at the aristocratic jest. &ldquo;True&mdash;true; you put the case concisely&mdash;very  concisely, I may say. The question is, whether it is right to set the man free,  and trust to an honour which I fear he does not possess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  thought for a few minutes, playing her part to perfection. &ldquo;It appears that  Captain Strange, very wisely, will not open his mouth so long as he is shut up.  If set free he promises to be amenable to reason. Of two evils I choose the  least, as Mr. Kaimes has done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means you will not prosecute?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Let the man go, and probably my husband will arrive within the week. How can it  be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  easily. To-morrow, or the next day, Strange can be brought before the  magistrate; but as neither you nor Mr. Kaimes will appear, the charge will be  dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  my dear Duchess, he will vanish into the world, and we shall have to trust to  the honour of an admitted blackmailer. It is really a terrible dilemma,&rdquo; cried  the lawyer, dismally, &ldquo;and forms such an evil precedent&mdash;oh, a most deadly blow  at justice, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; contradicted Leah, coolly; &ldquo;we can say that Captain Strange turned  King&rsquo;s evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  my dear Duchess&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the use of talking?&rdquo; she snapped impolitely. &ldquo;I have told you what to do. Go  and do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me if I am rude, but I am not fit to talk&rdquo;; and she hurried out of the room,  glad that she had settled the matter thus. Hall departed to London, reflecting  that the rudeness of the Duchess was quite explicable under the circumstances,  but resenting it all the same. To punish her he had a great mind to delay the  return of the Duke, until his good sense, or his avarice, told him that this  would be a costly price to pay for a petty revenge.</p>
  <p>In  this way Captain Strange triumphed, as most people can, by simply holding his  tongue. As no evidence was forthcoming, when he presented himself before the  magistrate, he could not be committed for trial, and after a few formalities  walked out of the dingy court a free man. Hall followed him as quickly as was  consistent with the dignity of a Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields solicitor, but stepped  into the open air to find his bird had flown. Nor did inquiries at the  third-rate Strand hotel result in an interview. The buccaneer, warned of  possible danger, never reappeared to claim the carpet-bag which held a few  shirts and oddments. He disappeared, apparently into the air, as did Macbeth&rsquo;s  fortune-tellers. Hall was vexed, as he had intended Strange should be shadowed  by detectives. Of this the astute sailor might have been aware, as he gave no  chance to the bloodhounds of the law. &ldquo;And we have to depend upon his honour  about restoring the Duke,&rdquo; thought Hall, with anguish. It might have eased his  mind had he known that the dependence was really to be placed on six thousand  pounds being paid within a stated period. But of that he was ignorant, and Leah  did not think it necessary to comfort her legal adviser in any way.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  she needed comfort herself sorely, for when a week passed and Jim did not  reappear, she began to think that Strange was contriving some new villainy.  Perhaps he was about to put up his price, and Leah was determined not to ransom  Jim at any greater sum than that she had already agreed to. The newspapers were  filled with astonished paragraphs about the inexplicable conduct of the  authorities in connection with Strange&rsquo;s acquittal, and some kind friend sent  the most spiteful of these to the waiting wife. Leah did not read the opinions  of cranks set forth in inferior English and was much more taken up with a  letter from Katinka Aksakoff. It was not easy to answer such a letter, yet she  would be compelled to reply.</p>
  <p>Mademoiselle  Aksakoff wrote indignantly, saying that she did not believe the statements of  the papers concerning the conspiracy of Constantine Demetrius. She denied that  such a noble man would act in so base a way, and reminded Leah of their  conversation on the terrace at Monte Carlo. &ldquo;You then said that you did not  love him,&rdquo; complained the letter, &ldquo;and insisted that he did not love you. But  if he kidnapped your husband, so that you might be free to marry him, he must  love you and you have lied. But I cannot believe that you would break my heart  in this way, nor can I credit so honourable a man with such conduct.&rdquo; Katinka  then went on to say that Demetrius had not been seen since he crossed to Paris.  Where was he? Did Lady Jim know? If so, let her tell the writer, or else&mdash;then  the epistle ended with a vague threat about hunting out Demetrius and learning  the truth. &ldquo;And when I do,&rdquo; ran the final line, &ldquo;your conscience will tell you  if we are to be friends or foes.&rdquo; This challenge&mdash;as it truly was&mdash;came from  Paris, where Katinka was stopping at the Russian Embassy. It had been  registered, to ensure delivery.</p>
  <p>A  most unpleasant letter. Leah felt inclined to tear it up, but some instinct  told her that Katinka Aksakoff was a persistent girl, with much obstinacy in  her character. If no reply came she would probably hasten to Firmingham for an  interview, and Lady Jim did not care about having the second honeymoon of  herself and her restored husband spoilt by the scene which would surely take  place. After destroying several sheets of note-paper she produced a concise  reply, saying as little as ever she could. Nevertheless, she was forced to say  much she would have preferred left unsaid. Captain Strange, said Lady Jim&rsquo;s  reply, declared that Demetrius had so conspired. But he had been set free and  had disappeared. What he said might be true, or might not. Nothing could be  known for certain unless Lord James returned, and up to the date of the letter  he had not put in an appearance. Demetrius certainly had come to Paris&mdash;not to  see the writer, but to interview M. Aksakoff about a possible pardon. At the  Henri Trois Hotel the doctor had been seized with a fit, and a Dr. Helfmann had  taken charge of him. &ldquo;Since then,&rdquo; wrote Lady Jim, &ldquo;I have not seen him.  However, I enclose a letter which he sent me on the day I left Paris. It would  seem that he has gone to Russia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I hope Katinka will follow him there,&rdquo; said Leah, after adding a few Judas  words of endearment. &ldquo;Aksakoff might keep her on his Volga estate. She&rsquo;ll only  make mischief if she comes to England. I&rsquo;ll warn her father of that&rdquo;; and she  did, for M. Aksakoff received a letter, which hinted that his daughter might  prove to be a possible fire-brand. And so the matter, for the time being,  ended.</p>
  <p>But  Jim had not yet arrived. Seven days passed, and the eighth night since the  buccaneer&rsquo;s release closed in. Leah felt the strain terribly, and hardly ate or  slept. Hilda did what she could to cheer her up, but, not knowing the whole  truth, could do very little. Lady Jim declined to take drugs, as her last  experience of these had shown her how they aged people, though that might have  been her fancy. All she could do, and did do, was to keep a tight rein on her  emotions, and beyond looking pale, and a trifle haggard, no one could have told  that she was in any way disturbed. Joan was a great comfort to her in those  days of strain, and so was Lionel, with his prophecies that all would yet be  well. But Leah had no one to whom she could tell the whole shocking truth, and  it was desperately trying to a woman, whose nervous system was almost wrecked,  to hold her tongue. These still waters were running very deep.</p>
  <p>She  found a certain relief in motion, and while Hilda wept and wailed that the  bodies of her dear husband and his father had never been cast ashore for  Christian burial, Leah&rsquo;s motor-car tore round the country through storm and sunshine.  She would not even take a chauffeur, but engineered the machine herself.  Providence, or the fetish that stood to her in place of it, watched over her  escapades. She met with no accident, not even the most trivial, although in her  reckless driving she did her best to reduce the car to match-wood. Like a witch  on a broomstick she flew round the country, frantic and insistent, as though  she sought the enjoyment of some wizard Sabbath. The motor flung mile after  mile behind, with a buzz and a hum, and the speed of a destroyer buffeting a  rough sea. Leah, with her hand on the levers, swooped down narrow lanes, spun  furiously along the King&rsquo;s highway, crashed through scared villages, and raced  the setting sun to the verge of the astonished lands. It was the extreme danger  of these flights which delighted and strengthened her; and if she had a large  bill to pay for breaking every known law in the county policemen&rsquo;s note-books,  it was easy for the Duchess of Pentland to pay for such frolics. The thrill,  the dash, the knowledge of power, the governance of a flying bomb-shell&mdash;these  things were worth double, treble, quadruple the money. She was inebriated with  danger, exalted by the constant nearness of death, and, like a she-Satan,  defiantly self-sufficient, scorned both God and man. Of woman, needless to say,  she took no account whatsoever.</p>
  <p>Then  came one memorable night, riotously wild with wind and rain. With gleaming  lamps, at top speed, facing the wrath of conflicting elements battling under a  stormy sky, she drove her machine roaring up the avenue. A quick turn of the  hand and she stayed it, fuming and whirring like a live thing, before the  porch. Contrary to custom, the door was open. Against the light she saw Lionel,  and in a moment guessed the inevitable. Leaving the chauffeur to attend to the  monster, this Mrs. Frankenstein sprang up the steps and dragged Lionel under  the glare of the electric lamp. A look into his face redoubled the beat of her  heart. There, sure enough, she saw what she expected to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  me to him,&rdquo; she breathed, still retaining her grip on his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  are you quite prepared? He is in the library, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  flung the curate away so forcibly that he staggered against the wall. She was  out of the hall, she was at the library door, she was in the library itself,  and all in two quick-drawn breaths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hulloa,  Leah,&rdquo; said a well-known voice, in a well-known manner.</p>
  <p>She  did not answer, but stared with a bloodless face, possessed entirely by the  devil of hysteria. Then she dropped, without a cry or a word. Like a  blood-mare, she had held out to the winning-post, and thus paid the price of  victory.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_30"></a>Chapter 30</b> </h2>
  <p>There  are periods in the growth of a tree when the sap, unable to circulate freely,  coagulates into knots and protuberances. Leah had heard some empirical dabbler  in science say as much, and recognised it as a truthful symbol of her existence  for the twelve months following Jim&rsquo;s return. There was certainly a knot in her  life, for somehow, in an unaccountable way, things seemed to be at a  standstill. Before intermeddling with criminal matters she had indulged her  senses in every possible way, and now that she had receded within the legal  limits of action, she was prepared to indulge them again. To her surprise, they  did not respond, and she discovered that the nursery stage of enjoyment had  been passed. That intermezzo of fierce endeavour, of scheming and fighting, of  dancing on the edge of a precipice, and of wandering in perilous ways, had  ruined her for untroubled days and comfortable nights. While battling with  desperate fortunes she had detested the storm and necessary stress of the  encounter; now she longed to set her forces in array once more and dare the  worst. The salt had lost its savour, and her vitiated palate demanded pepper&mdash;red  pepper, hot and biting&mdash;to flavour the good things ready for her eating at life&rsquo;s  banquet.</p>
  <p>But  Leah found, as many had done before her, that desire is better than success,  that there is more zest in striving than in attaining. She had longed for ample  funds, and since she possessed full control of the Pentland income this longing  was almost, but not quite, satisfied. Nevertheless, her soul was hungry still.  She bought everything she fancied, and scarcely cast a look on her most costly  and attractive purchases. She travelled with the luxurious surroundings of a  queen, and only felt bored; she stopped at home, and yawned incessantly twice  round the clock. She would have willingly remunerated the inventor of a new  pleasure, but like Xerxes, she could not find so imaginative a man. It was  truly lamentable to think that she should possess the moon she had cried for,  only to find it was but a used-up world.</p>
  <p>Jim,  on the contrary, flourished healthily under his strawberry leaves, and this  best-of-all-possible-world satisfaction added to his wife&rsquo;s exasperation. Daily  he grew stouter and more plethoric, daily he made the same stupid observations,  and daily he indulged in the gross material pleasures dear to his infinitesimal  soul, which was being smothered in superabundant flesh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are like a pig removed into a new sty,&rdquo; his wife scornfully informed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bad sty,&rdquo; answered the Duke, looking round the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  enough for middle-class people, but not for us, Jim. We are desperately poor as  Duke and Duchess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so, Leah; but you spend most of the income.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a right to. Don&rsquo;t forget what I have done for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  give me no chance,&rdquo; said her husband, bitterly. &ldquo;Every time we have a row you  mention things that needn&rsquo;t be mentioned. And after all, Leah, you got me back  for your own convenience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that. I wish now that I had kept the thirty thousand which we  had to pay back, and had let you remain where you were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  board Strange&rsquo;s odd-job steamer? It wasn&rsquo;t so bad, though I was chained by the  leg. I learnt a lot about engines there; used to watch &lsquo;em when she was bumping  through hurricanes. They were triple expansion, too. It was fun to watch the  old Scotch engineer with his hand on the throttle-valve, and hear him curse  when the screw leaped sky-high to race like a motor. I&rsquo;ve had worse times&mdash;much  worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke with more animation than usual, and Leah sympathised with his enthusiasm.  She also would have enjoyed herself on a rotten hulk with doubtful engines and  an hourly chance of going down into the great green seas; the excitement would  have been intense, and the death a clean one. Perhaps Jim had forgotten the  softer emotions of man when the tramp stormed north with every rivet in her  hull straining for dispersion. She wondered. &ldquo;I suppose you missed Se&ntilde;orita  Fajardo then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  curiously enough, I didn&rsquo;t. There was too much fun in thinkin&rsquo; what would come  next to bother about her. I&rsquo;m a bit of a philosopher, Leah, an&rsquo; when I can&rsquo;t  get cake I chew bread. Now I&rsquo;ve got the cake I&rsquo;m enjoyin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  eating too much of it. Look how stout you are getting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Respectable  men always get stout when they grow old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a bit elderly. Somehow I don&rsquo;t enjoy larks so much as I used to,&rdquo; mused Jim,  thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;sign of age, I suppose. But I daresay I&rsquo;ll get some sort of fun  out of life, an&rsquo; maybe will need old Jarvey Peel&rsquo;s money at sixty. It&rsquo;ll be  more than thirty thousand by then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Less  the six thousand you paid Strange,&rdquo; said his Duchess, cruelly.</p>
  <p>Jim  winced. &ldquo;Bit of a pull, that&mdash;hey! Nice fancy price I&rsquo;ve had to pay for your  fun, Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was to bring you back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  make you a Duchess, you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  would think you were middle class to hear you talk of titles in that respectful  way. Who bothers about such things nowadays? I have been bored to death since  Strange&rsquo;s blackmail turned you into a pauper Duke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  husband made a grimace at this very plain speaking. &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t talk  like that, Leah. Hang it, I thought you really loved me when you fainted on my  return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  acting, my good man,&rdquo; she assured him, annoyed by his recalling that  twelve-month-old weakness. &ldquo;I had to impress the family somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you don&rsquo;t love me?&rdquo; said Jim, slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a question to ask after nearly seven years of married life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I&rsquo;m respectable now,&rdquo; urged Jim, setting forth the contents of the new page he  had turned over. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t race or bet overmuch, an&rsquo; never look at a pretty  woman. I go to church, an&rsquo; sit in the Lords, an&rsquo; take the chair at charity  dinners, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do that last because you love eating. All the charity funds are spent on the  victuals, and the poor get about a penny in the collected pounds. Oh, you are  quite a model, Jim, and so dull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  is but a sample of the few conversations the ducal pair allowed themselves, for  they did not foregather with any enthusiasm. For propriety&rsquo;s sake the Duke and  Duchess of Pentland were seen together at the few functions they could attend  during the months of mourning; their home life was outwardly harmonious, and the  crying down of a grass-widow which had been heard during those weeks of  suspense following Strange&rsquo;s arrest had changed to crying up, when it was seen  how very correctly the new Duchess behaved. Therefore they saw one another only  officially, save on rare occasions. Leah found Jim dull, as she had frankly  told him, and he winced always at his wife&rsquo;s tongue, which had lost none of its  cutting power. Even his stupid brain grasped the fact that she was changed,  though in what way he could not exactly say. She was certainly restless, and  his bovine contentment with things-as-they-are could not understand this phase.  Also she was dissatisfied, although she had secured all she had wanted by  almost a miracle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rum  creatures, women,&rdquo; soliloquised the philosopher, sauntering to his club. &ldquo;If  you gave &lsquo;em the solar system to play with they&rsquo;d howl for the universe,&rdquo; which  was a high flight for Jim to take in the way of metaphor.</p>
  <p>Leah  sometimes thought that the long period of mourning might have darkened her  outlook on life. She and Jim were forced by a ridiculously particular world to  live quietly, and she could not indulge herself to the full. A constant  succession of black dresses palled on one fond of colours, and custom forbade  her filling the various ducal residences with amusing people, who in any case  were almost impossible to find. Then, as Leah stated, they were really poor,  considering the title. What with regiments of servants and the stately mansions  which housed them, the horses and carriages, and motors, and rents and taxes,  and unnecessary personal expenditure, and equally unnecessary charities, it was  truly difficult to make two aristocratic ends meet. The Duchess of Pentland had  to contrive and arrange almost as much as had Lady Jim. From two thousand a  year to twenty-five times that amount seems a large jump, but the title  nullified the value of the estates. Leah ardently prayed that the fetish would  increase the incoming and decrease the outgoing, but her Baal seemed to think  that it had done enough, even for so devout a woman. &ldquo;Am I never going to have  a good time?&rdquo; wailed Leah. Later she found that the wail was unnecessary, for  the fetish pitied his worshipper and granted her prayer. Coal of the best  quality was found on a Welsh property of the Kaimes family, and Hall prophesied  that in a year or two the ducal income would be doubled. Leah took heart at  this sign of grace, as one really could manage pretty well on one hundred  thousand a year. But a pound a minute was Leah&rsquo;s idea of a moderate income, and  then she would have grumbled that each hour only brought her in sixty  sovereigns. However, she decided to spend what she had and what was coming  along from the coal to the last farthing, and arranged when the year of sorrow  was ended&mdash;as it now was&mdash;to take her place in the very gayest of society. She  would be presented again this season according to custom, and then would see  about exhausting the most advanced pleasures of a civilisation that could not  do enough for one of her greedy appetite. This she told to Lady Canvey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a mistake,&rdquo; rejoined the sagacious octogenarian, who was a year older in  body and a year younger in brain. &ldquo;If you exhaust everything in this world,  nothing will be left for you but to try the next. And I don&rsquo;t think you are quite  prepared for that, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  not. I never set up for being a saint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  That is a pleasure you have not yet exhausted. Why not try it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I am no hypocrite. What is the use of pretending to be goody-goody, when you  are not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saints  are holy, not goody-goody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be with you, certainly. But you are not the sort to be canonised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t know. A sinner is the raw material out of which a saint is  manufactured. You can&rsquo;t be really good, unless you have been really very bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is useful information,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, dryly; &ldquo;and very encouraging to  people like yourself. You might make an attempt at being Saint Leah or Saint  Jezebel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Canvey!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  the old dame chuckled, &ldquo;then you do know something of Scripture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but I don&rsquo;t quote it to annoy other people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  tongue is quite clever enough to do without such aid, my dear. And don&rsquo;t lose  your temper&mdash;I am only talking for your good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Disagreeable  conversations are always prefaced by that remark. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was thinking you might begin on your saintly career by endowing a church with  this coal money. They build churches very cheap nowadays. You can have one of  red brick, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are too many churches, and too few worshippers,&rdquo; interrupted the Duchess, with  a shrug; &ldquo;besides, I propose to endow myself with the coal money. I daresay I  shall give fifty pounds or so to Lionel for his paupers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must not ruin yourself, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, with affectionate spite. &ldquo;I  thought that Lionel, as a married man, and the Vicar of Firmingham, had nothing  to do with paupers. There are none in the parish there&mdash;at least, there were  none in Pentland&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; she ended with emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose you mean to hint that Jim is stopping his charities and putting on the  screw. Don&rsquo;t distress yourself, godmother; everything is as it was, save that  our tenants and villagers are more gorged and much more impudent. Lionel doesn&rsquo;t  appreciate the godliness of his heritage, because his parishioners pay their  rents regularly and come to church without the whip. They are so pious that his  occupation is gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would not suit an energetic Christian like Lionel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t. He and Joan take pleasure trips into the Lambeth slums and ask seedy  ruffians to stay with them in the country. What with converted burglars and  wives who assure you they haven&rsquo;t been beaten for weeks, the place is quite a  Whitechapel Paradise. Lionel preaches to the ruffians, and Joan listens to the  wives with whole skins. I believe they join forces to wash the children. Oh,  they have rollicking times at Firmingham Vicarage, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  meritorious times,&rdquo; said Lady Canvey, reprovingly&mdash;&ldquo;quite like the primitive  Christian Church.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Less  clean, I fancy, and more ungrammatical,&rdquo; murmured Leah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  mock, my dear. Lionel is a noble man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  quite agree with you, and without mockery. Jim is also a noble man, in a  different sense, if you will forgive the pun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is unworthy of your wit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot always be pyrotechnical. You need flint and steel to strike fire, and I  find no flints amongst the idiots I have to entertain. Do you know, godmother,&rdquo;&mdash;Leah  stared into the fire&mdash;&ldquo;I often wish that Lionel had remained the Duke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your husband had been really a corpse? How like you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said the Duchess, cheerfully. &ldquo;Jim might have been of some use if his,&mdash;what do  you call those things?&mdash;oh, yes,&mdash;if his vortices had combined with other  elements to grow into plants and sheep and cows, and generally do the sort of  things which vortices are supposed to do. But as a Duke he is a failure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t exactly know what you mean by your heathen talk of vortices,&rdquo; snapped  Lady Canvey. &ldquo;Dust we are, and unto dust shall we return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Jim,&rdquo; protested Leah: &ldquo;he would return to mud. He just looks as though he were  made of sticky, clayey, stodgy mud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not original to abuse your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that; but you are too old-fashioned to admire originality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Canvey thumped with her stick vigorously. &ldquo;Do not be so desperately sharp,  Leah; you make my head ache. By the way, I have news for you about that nice  boy you treated so badly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have treated so many nice boys badly. Billy Richardson, Algy Turner, Harry  Askew&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  last. He is to be married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew that a year ago. He left before Jim came home to make some Spanish  creature his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Mamie Mulrady does not sound like a Spanish name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  girl! You don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo; Leah looked genuinely surprised. &ldquo;I suppose Se&ntilde;orita  Fajardo would not have him. Perhaps she is waiting for Mr. Berring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;a  friend of mine&rdquo;; she put up her muff to hide a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that U.S.A. heiress&mdash;a nice girl if she did not affect the Wild West of  which she knows absolutely nothing. No doubt she thinks it chic to let  Europeans hear the American eagle scream in the vernacular. Fancy!&mdash;and to  Askew! A good match for him. I suppose he will call pounds, shillings and pence  collectively dollars now that he is brother to George Washington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. Mrs. Askew will probably be more English than the English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might easily be that, since the English are mostly aliens nowadays. Well, I  must go. Good-bye. I have enjoyed my hour. I always do with you, godmother.  Such a clever tongue!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not leaving you any money, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  don&rsquo;t. Your grandson is finding that opera-dancer expensive. Give Canvey your  savings, and his lady-love will dance professionally on your grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad cats don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said the old woman, addressing no one in particular. &ldquo;One  is quite enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  they do talk then,&rdquo; laughed Leah, and having got the last word slipped away  before Lady Canvey could rally her forces.</p>
  <p>The  Duchess, well wrapped up in expensive furs, stepped into the crisp air,  thinking of Askew and his triple dip into the matrimonial lucky-bag. Lola  Fajardo, Marjory the fixture, and Mamie Mulrady, not to speak of herself, whom  he would have married had she cared to call herself by his unpretentious name.  Certainly he was a man unfettered by prejudices in love affairs. Dark or fair,  tall or short, and of any nationality, he adored them all in an entirely  respectable fashion which included a ring and a parson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Though  I don&rsquo;t believe the silly boy knows what love is,&rdquo; thought Leah, passing into  Piccadilly&mdash;she was walking for exercise towards the Park; &ldquo;but people of that  ignorant sort always seem to land on their feet, like the cats Lady Canvey  spoke of. I have landed very comfortably myself. I wonder why I can&rsquo;t love any  one. How is it that no man can stir me into experience of the grand passion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lately  Leah had taken to analysing herself with fatal results. It seemed to her that  she was shallow, since nothing in the world made any difference to her, or  could make her feel. If Jim had dropped dead of the apoplectic fit which was  waiting for him, she would merely have shrugged her shoulders; had the old Duke  come back to claim the title, she would have had small regret in surrendering  it. Everything seemed trivial and dull and vulgar. A remark made by Lionel  occurred vividly to her at this moment. &ldquo;You will never be truly happy,&rdquo; he had  said, &ldquo;until you are truly sorrowful.&rdquo; It was an unintentional epigram on the  vicar&rsquo;s part, as he was dense, like all the Kaimes family; but it was clever  enough to be true. Only&mdash;and here was the hopelessness of her life&mdash;she saw no  chance of becoming sorrowful in any degree, since her indifference nullified  deep feelings of any sort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose I shall have to run in this society circus till I die,&rdquo; she thought  drearily. &ldquo;What a clown&rsquo;s destiny!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  mention of one lover naturally recalled the name of another, and by the time  she passed Apsley House thoughts of Demetrius were running in her head. Not a  word had she heard of him since his enforced journey to Siberia, via Paris,  Havre, and Kronstadt. Katinka Aksakoff might have supplied information, only  that Katinka, for reasons which Leah guessed rather than knew, had disappeared  some nine months ago. According to M. Aksakoff, she was ruralising on his Volga  estates, and her health forbade an exciting life. The Duchess did not quite  believe this smooth explanation; and yet, at times, she fancied that the  diplomatist might have taken her advice regarding the shepherding of an  infatuated child.</p>
  <p>It  was, then, by one of those curious coincidences perfectly explicable to the  psychological mind, that the man himself glided to her side. He looked as tall  and lean as ever, but his eyes were less direct in their gaze, and he did not  seem to exercise his former self-control. Leah and he had met but rarely during  the past year, owing to her retirement consequent on mourning observances, and  when they did meet each had avoided mention of that memorable afternoon in  Paris. But when he crossed Leah&rsquo;s path thus unexpectedly, and when her head was  filled with Demetrius and with the woman Demetrius did <i>not</i> love, she  resolved to learn the worst or the best. After greeting, she began to speak  with unconventional abruptness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is your daughter, M. Aksakoff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  my Volga estate,&rdquo; he replied nervously; and from his averted eyes she made sure  he was lying badly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Siberia, you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned with a start. &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am right, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  clasped and unclasped two restless hands over the knob of his cane. &ldquo;I really  cannot say. I do not know why you should make that observation, after I have  informed you of my daughter&rsquo;s whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  make it because I am a woman, and being such, I know that Katinka&rsquo;s love for  that waxed-moustache creature will lead her&mdash;perhaps has led her&mdash;even into  Siberian wilds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  stopped under the Achilles Statue and probed her mind with his eyes. &ldquo;Do you  really think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. Does my thought confirm facts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  resumed his walk with a troubled face. &ldquo;I will be frank with you, madame, since  we both know that Constantine Demetrius left Paris on that afternoon <i>en  route</i> to Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing of the sort,&rdquo; contradicted Leah, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you have just admitted that the man is in Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duchess laughed carelessly. &ldquo;All Russians go as naturally to Siberia as  cockneys to Margate. It&rsquo;s a kind of Bank Holiday with them, I suppose. Why not  be frank with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,  I rather think that I should ask you that question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never answer questions,&rdquo;  said Leah, coolly; &ldquo;it saves a lot of trouble. But I make statements, and one  is that Demetrius and the woman who loves him are in Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you really think so?&rdquo; said the diplomatist, repeating himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>do</i> think so; but surely you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  shook his head. &ldquo;Katinka refused to marry her cousin Petrovitch, after the  disappearance of Demetrius. She questioned me continually about him, and showed  me the letter and enclosure which you had sent. A very diplomatic letter, if I  may say so. I, of course, denied that I knew anything. She appeared to be  satisfied; yet nine months ago she left my house&mdash;left this country&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  rusticate on your Volga estates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was my excuse for her disappearance, and I beg of you, madame, to accept that  excuse in society, for the sake of her good name and mine.&rdquo; She nodded, and he  went on gravely: &ldquo;I confess to you, madame, that I do not know where she is.  You suggest Siberia; it is possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fancy so, seeing she is infatuated with the man. But how could she possibly  learn that he was there?&rdquo; Leah asked this question a trifle nervously, for  there seemed to be something menacing in this strange behaviour of Katinka.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  easily. You sent her the letter supposed to have been written by Constantine  Demetrius in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  letter is that?&rdquo; she asked obstinately.</p>
  <p>The  Russian&rsquo;s eyes flashed. &ldquo;You must know, madame, and you do know, that the  letter was forged for your safety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duchess stopped abruptly, and became as ice in manner and speech. &ldquo;You talk  very strangely M. Aksakoff. My safety was never in danger, so far as I know.  Your anxiety makes you indiscreet, and thinking so, I pardon the indiscretion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff,  knowing that she would continue to feign ignorance, even in the face of  aggressive facts, apologised with a bow, since it mattered very little. &ldquo;In  that forged letter&rdquo;&mdash;he was determined to stick to the word&mdash;&ldquo;was the name of  Helfmann.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Helfmann,&rdquo; she corrected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gave him that degree, madame,&rdquo; said Aksakoff, dryly. &ldquo;Helfmann is one of our  secret police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you had no business to introduce such a creature into my rooms,&rdquo; said Leah, angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon,  the crime is twelve months old. To proceed. Katinka knew the real business of  this man, and may have learned the truth, or enough of it, to make her journey  to Siberia. Tomsk&mdash;yes, Tomsk!&rdquo; He leaned his stick on the ground, his hands on  the stick, and stared vaguely at the leafless trees. &ldquo;Assuredly Tomsk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Dr. Demetrius there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aksakoff  nodded vaguely. &ldquo;I wish you a good day, madame,&rdquo; said he, and turned away  abruptly without raising his hat. The omission of a usual courtesy either  betrayed his absence of mind, or showed what he truly thought of the Duchess of  Pentland.</p>
  <p>Leah,  having a tender conscience, chose to assign the latter reason, and resolved to  cut the man if he should dare to speak to her again. &ldquo;But what can you expect  from the Russian bear?&rdquo; she said, resuming her walk.</p>
  <p>It  ended in Curzon Street. She and Jim rented the ducal residence to a wealthy  American, and retained the smaller mansion, on the plea that their happiest  days had been spent there. This excuse was, of course, a lie, but every one  believed it, and said how touching it was to see that a Duke and a Duchess  could be so human. And, after all, Leah really did like the cot of her humble  days. It was pleasant to think that she had been &ldquo;Lady Jim of Curzon Street,&rdquo;  and had taken her title in that way, just like a peer in his own right.  Sometimes she regretted that she was simply a Duchess, and not Lady Jim as of  old. Then she had enjoyed life; now she found it excruciatingly dull. And it  was all the fault of Demetrius, who had taught her more exciting methods of  passing time than by killing it.</p>
  <p>When  in the drawing-room she recalled the conversation with Aksakoff, and began to  think that there were troublesome days ahead. If Katinka had learned the truth  through Helfmann, she was assuredly hovering round Tomsk in the hope of aiding  Demetrius to escape. Should she be successful, as so determined girl might  easily be, the man would return to this Island of Refuge breathing out  vengeance of the direst. Leah had often contemplated a possible escape,  followed by a certain return, and the contemplation invariably produced a  shudder. Now that there seemed to be some ground that the man who knew all and  would tell all might come to England, she was conscious of rising spirits. The  feeling puzzled her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ought to be shaking in my shoes,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;but I feel rather pleased  than otherwise. I am spoilt for a life of cotton-wool and policemen at every  corner. Danger is the sole thing which amuses me. That must be the explanation  of my feeling jolly. I expect the heroes and heroines of cheap novels feel the  same when they settle to a dull marriage after pages of hair-breadth escapes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was perfectly right. Leah Pentland was a bad woman mainly because she had been  looked after too carefully. It required upheavals to bring the possible best  out of her. She had behaved unscrupulously and basely in dealing with the  insurance fraud, because that was the sole adventure which had come her way.  But had the adventure been heroic and noble, she would have enjoyed it quite as  much and would have struggled quite as bravely. The reckless way in which she  pulled the whiskers of Death, when throned on her motor-car, was characteristic  of the woman. Given danger, and she blossomed into a heroine, good or bad as  circumstances served. At heart she was no vapid society woman, and her fiery  pursuit of aimless pleasures merely showed her restless and masculine  temperament. Danger braced her. At times, during her first taste of it, she had  certainly given way from overstrained nerves; but now she was steeled to the  worst that could happen, blooded to the open trail, baptised in unholy fire. If  Katinka and Demetrius returned to London to give battle she was certain,  absolutely certain, that she could beat them single-handed. Katinka she felt  was the more dangerous of the two. Well, let her come, let him come, and  victory be to the self-confident. Leah was so sure of her triumph that she did  not even cast a thought to her hard-worked fetish. All the same, she kept the  peacock&rsquo;s feather constantly in her pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo;  said the Duchess that night, after a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> dinner, when the pair  reached the coffee stage, &ldquo;let us sell up, drop our rank, and go to Canada.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duke stared, as well he might. &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  Why do you not say damn, as I feel inclined to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  still stared with infantile blue eyes. &ldquo;You say such queer things,&rdquo; he  objected, fishing for a cigar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to do them. Oh, why wasn&rsquo;t I born a real live man. I should have  lived&mdash;lived&mdash;lived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Jim, stolidly clipping his weed, &ldquo;you live now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a satin-lined, rose-wood jewel-box, if you call that living.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see what you mean,&rdquo; confessed the Duke, lighting up. &ldquo;Same here. I was ever so  much jollier aboard that dirty tramp. I slugged one of the crew&mdash;a Finn, he was&mdash;a  hulking Finn, who thought I was a world-crawler, an&rsquo; no man. They carried him  away in bits,&rdquo; finished Jim, with the battle-light in his blue eyes.</p>
  <p>Leah  looked at him curiously. &ldquo;Jim, I really believe that we might understand one  another. You and I are meant to be pals, and not a conventional man and wife.  If you were only a backwoodsman I should adore you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  do the washin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the scrubbing and the cookin&rsquo;? I fancy I see you puttin&rsquo;  your back into that sort of work, Leah. Honey-pots are more in your line.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am as sick of honey-pots as you are. All this dressing and undressing, and  court functions, and paltry pigeon-shooting, and skating at Prince&rsquo;s on sham  ice, and yachting at Cowes in a floating hotel&mdash;oh, Lord, how it bores me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  always bored,&rdquo; grunted her husband, unsympathetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you wonder at it,  when I have to go round and round and round in a decorated ring like a  trick-pony? If I were a woman it would be satisfactory, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Jim, obtusely, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  sprang from her chair and flung out her arms with a deep chest breath. &ldquo;I am a  man,&rdquo; she announced, in resonant contralto tones. &ldquo;I feel like one, anyhow.  Didn&rsquo;t some one say there was no sense in this grown-up business. Well, I am  like that. Up to the time you went after Lola Fajardo I did enjoy things all  round, but somehow I feel as though the bottom had dropped out of creation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drop  Lola Fajardo also, then,&rdquo; growled the Duke, colouring. &ldquo;I never went near her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you couldn&rsquo;t. The serpent in the bamboo&mdash;eh, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care anything for her now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  looked at him steadily. &ldquo;I am glad of that, because you belong to me&mdash;to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  much you think of me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you are extremely selfish, and desperately weak with even ugly women, and  quite a brute when you don&rsquo;t get your own pretty way, and&mdash;in short, you are a  man, a glorious lord of creation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, drop rottin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not rotting, as you delicately put it. Like myself, this sugary civilisation  has spoiled you. If you had to earn your bread I should respect you, Jim. I  might even love you. Yes&rdquo;&mdash;she considered for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;I daresay it might come  to that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  was growing bewildered. &ldquo;What does all this mean?&rdquo; was his very natural interrogation.</p>
  <p>His  wife bewildered him still more by acting in a way which made him gasp. She  walked round the table, and, standing at his back, placed her arms round his  neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Jim. I have just found out by my very own self that you  and I are cave-people pitchforked into the wrong century. We live ten thousand  years too late&mdash;just think of it&mdash;ten thousand years of life and death. Let us go  back to the mud, Jim, and take up the life where we left it when you were  killed, spearing that mammoth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah!&rdquo;  His head was thrown back, and his eyes stared upward in alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what you think, but I am as sane as you are, and ten times cleverer. No&rdquo;;  she loosened her arms from his neck and locked them behind her. &ldquo;Look at me,  Jim. Am I a doll?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  startled Duke wheeled his chair and stared at her brilliant eyes, no longer  hard and cold, at her stately figure, her splendid red hair, her clearly cut  face flushed and animated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rippin&rsquo; fine woman,&rdquo; said he, his sluggish  pulses stirred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you think&mdash;so the world thinks. Yet I have to live in a wadded box like a wax  doll. I want to get out of that box&mdash;it stifles me, chokes me. I am sick of the  tents of Shem, and wish to house under those of Esau. You and I will take the  privilege of rank and be eccentric. As pals we&rsquo;ll get on much better than as a  Mayfair man and wife of the wrong sort, beyond the borders of this horrid  civilisation that is. Buy a yacht, Jim&mdash;a tramp hulk with those triple expansion  engines you told me about, and let us make for the South Seas. There&rsquo;s a clear  path down Channel. Let us explore, let us venture into the Naked Lands and  exploit the fringes of the empire. I want to live&mdash;to live, you understand. Oh,&rdquo;  she cried almost fiercely, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Jim, truthfully, and as stolid as ever; &ldquo;you have your rank to think of,  and my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  fire died out of Leah&rsquo;s eyes, the colour from her face, the ring from her  voice; even her figure seemed to dwindle from that of a tragedy queen into a  conventional Belgravian wife. Then she laughed shortly, and in a way which Jim  did not approve of in his Duchess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon, Pentland,&rdquo; said Leah, using his title to mark the far recoil. &ldquo;I  took you for a man: you are nothing but a society gramophone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  would have resented this contemptuous description, but that she gave him no  time to formulate an idea in his slow-thinking brain. With swift steps she left  the room and ascended to her boudoir; there, after locking the door, with a  strength which disordered the lock, she flung herself face downward on the  sofa, and cried quietly, passionately, with that suppressed anger and grief and  rage which rends the body and brain so terribly. Jim could not, would not  understand. He was what he always had been&mdash;the sole Gadarene pig into which a  devilkin had not entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I never put fire into that clay?&rdquo; sobbed Leah, savagely.</p>
  <p>Only  God could have done that, and she did not believe in God. But the fetish was in  her pocket.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_31"></a>Chapter 31</b> </h2>
  <p>Leah  made no farther attempt to decivilise Jim. He was too engrossed in Egyptian  flesh-pots to set out for the Promised Land of splendid adventure and  Elizabethan enterprise. In his clay there did lurk a spark of that Promethean  fire which, melting meaner aims into one passionate purpose to explore the world  and exploit the world, has made England great. Unfortunately, it could not be  fanned into anything resembling a flame. The cucumbers, the melons, the leeks,  and the garlic of civilisation appealed to him insistently, and even if he did  betake himself to roaming unfenced wastes, he certainly would not number a wife  amongst his luggage. Moreover&mdash;and this she knew by instinct&mdash;his basic qualities  were markedly those of the homing kind. This being so, a few months of tent and  road would be used by him as a relish to increased appreciation of the cedar  chambers and painted halls wherein his cradle had been rocked. It was clearly  impossible to make a silken purse out of this particular sow&rsquo;s ear, so Jim  drowsed very contentedly beside the fire, while his wife, out of sheer ennui,  chased Piccadilly butterflies, or sat in her ducal niche to be bored with  social adoration.</p>
  <p>But  one thing rendered life endurable to Leah Pentland at this juncture, and that  was her coming opportunity to exhaust the enjoyable. Now that the days of  compulsory sorrow were ended she had plenty to do, and ample funds for the  doing. At Firmingham the new king and queen celebrated Christmas, new style,  with celebrants who were but doubtfully informed as to the why and wherefore of  the festival. Certainly, Jim and his Comus-rout invaded church on the holy-day,  and yawned impatiently through liturgy and sermon; but this was a concession to  county prejudices. Leah would tolerate no Santa Claus tree, no Druidical  decorations, and no modernised mumming of the Middle Ages. These out-of-date  enjoyments were replaced by political and poetical tableaux, by amateur  renderings of smart French and dismal Russian plays, and by the kitchen lancers  when riotous cake-walks palled. Imported musicians, in an incorrect foreign  uniform, played Greig&rsquo;s melodies, Tschaikowsky&rsquo;s weird sound-poems, and that  nerve-exhausting music of the present by Herr Wagner which has now arrived at  its future. For the uncouth carol of innocent Victorian days was substituted  Sousa&rsquo;s clanging marches, comic songs, clean but inane, and catchy airs from  the newest vaudeville, miscalled musical-comedy. Out-of-door sports included  skating on artificial ice&mdash;since it was a green Christmas&mdash;motor-car races,  attempts at golf and polo-playing, riding, driving, and sauntering flirtations,  while bridge circulated the guests&rsquo; money at odd moments. It was truly  wonderful to see how completely these nominal Christians had substituted a  heathen festival of some sort for the orthodox pleasures of tradition. The  participants in the orgie were all smart and all <i>blas&eacute;s</i>, perfectly  dressed and triumphantly selfish. With that careful avoidance of spoken  appreciation which marks the modern trifler, they took leave of the Duchess  with the remark that her notion of what Yule-tide should be was not half bad. A  week of dull Sundays, so to speak, had been got through capitally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  frumpish about the thing,&rdquo; pronounced Mrs. Penworthy, who had been asked to  gratify Jim, and who had been found woefully wanting in snap. &ldquo;Every one was  quite up to scratch. Leah Pentland did simply ripping off her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  little woman was not talking an unknown language, for the latest successor to  Algy understood her excellently well. She spoke the gibberish of those in a  hurry, which she had taken some pains to acquire. The very few words in the  dictionary used by the fashionable were dropped into the melting-pot, and came  out in ungrammatical lumps of misused adjectives and verbs with a paucity of  pronouns and prepositions. Mrs. Penworthy, whose sense of humour was strong,  had proposed that Lionel should translate the Bible into this time-saving  vernacular, so that its spiritual meaning could be arrived at by those who  thought the verse of Milton and the prose of Bacon starchy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  hear of it,&rdquo; said she, to Algy&rsquo;s latest successor, while munching American  sweets in the up-going train. &ldquo;Told him it would be spiffing to fetch the  psalms up to mark, but he didn&rsquo;t catch on somehow. Wonder the Duchess can stand  him, with his horrid correctness. She&rsquo;s fond of doing herself well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thought  the Duchess had rather a shoppin&rsquo; face,&rdquo; replied the man, meaning that his  hostess had looked worried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  knew why she should. Got heaps of cake to chew. Might be she missed Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wheresey  hang out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know. Went prancing off on his own. Got a puff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  inheritor of Algy&rsquo;s shoes provided the lady with a cigarette. &ldquo;Fancied she  cottoned to th&rsquo; Askew chap,&rdquo; he remarked, striking a match.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  she did&mdash;oh, rather! Aksakoff let on to me &lsquo;bout the boy jumping Paris to get  fixed&mdash;British Embassy fixings, you know. Leah Pentland didn&rsquo;t bring it off  somehow. Lucky for her, seeing Jim wasn&rsquo;t a goner. We really could not have  received her,&rdquo; ended Mrs. Penworthy; then, aware that she had lapsed into decent  English, corrected her mistake: &ldquo;Mean we couldn&rsquo;t have let her chip into our  game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  th&rsquo; Duchess?&rdquo; inquired her companion, languidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know, quite. Saucy and swagger and all that. Freezes a bit&mdash;what? Talks like a  book, you know. Awfully expensive rattle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man nodded. &ldquo;Thought she wasn&rsquo;t up to dick. Daresay she&rsquo;ll spin along on her  own freely, when the hump&rsquo;s off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hump?  She hasn&rsquo;t got the hump, or the needle either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  saucy hump,&rdquo; insisted the male linguist&mdash;&ldquo;quite birdish. Sorry the old Duke an&rsquo;  Frith hopped, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  very unnatural!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Penworthy, reverting to English in her disgust. &ldquo;Quite  too awf&rsquo;l to think how luck hooks on to her. Really makes one wish to be a bad  woman, to see how she lands the salmon,&rdquo; she finished more creditably.</p>
  <p>Algy&rsquo;s  latest successor was right, for once in his life of mistakes. Leah was not  entirely her own brilliant self, notwithstanding that successful inauguration  of the new era. The early excitement consequent on the conversation with Aksakoff  had died away, and again she felt the old haunting fear of the possible. But  this absurd mood, she hoped, would pass away when the test came. Facing her  enemies, male and female, she would doubtless fight like a cornered rat, and  would conquer from sheer determination not to be beaten. Nevertheless, this  period of suspense was trying to one who had no listener, and who could not  talk herself into heroics by mere monologues. A confidant was necessary only to  the weaker part of her character, since her deepest feelings advised her that  pure strength must needs be solitary. She was an oak, not an ivy, and  unknowingly agreed with Emerson as to the vitiating effects of comfortable  circumstances. &ldquo;Cast the bantling on the rocks,&rdquo; sang the Seer of Concord, and  Leah indubitably squirmed thereon, as Jim had informed her in his simple way in  a conversation now&mdash;apparently&mdash;some centuries old.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  month&rsquo;s a year now,&rdquo; sighed Leah, wearily.</p>
  <p>However,  pending a possible fight for her social throne, the Duchess made the very best  of the passing hour. After the pagan entertainment of the winter solstice, she  endured the gorging Christianity of a few belated country-houses, whose  inhabitants were still eating in honour of a Birth which had taken place some  two thousand years ago, as a Book they seldom read assured them. She went alone  to these Vitellian feasts, as Jim was off the chain until such time as he would  be needed to play Duke during the season. The aristocratic prodigal&rsquo;s  reformation was but skin-deep, and the late whitewash soon wore off to show the  unchanged black fleece, since he began with the zeal of a newly uniformed  subaltern to poach on various matrimonial manors. Mrs. Penworthy he had  naturally grown tired of, as she preferred syndicates to partnerships, so he  placed his tried affections on Lady Sandal, who was horsey and doggy and  tremendously expensive on account of her betting craze. She and Jim talked  kennels and stables, discussing their very unplatonic loves between times, and  found each other kindred guttersnipes of the earthly, sensual kind. Leah,  speedily informed by a feminine sidewind of this new amusement of Jim&rsquo;s  four-and-twenty leisure hours, did not object, or even hint her knowledge of  his backsliding. It kept him out of her way, and Lord Sandal, a Nero with  limitations, who dwelt in a superlative glass house, was not likely to submit  his wife&rsquo;s latest sin to the fierce light which beats upon the divorce court  witness-box. Nothing could be more satisfactory to a woman who wanted complete freedom,  and Leah again thanked the agreeable fetish for making straight her very  crooked paths.</p>
  <p>But  all this time the sword dangled over Leah&rsquo;s head, and its menace became so  insupportable that she wished the single hair would give way, to decide  brusquely for hit or miss. Her desire was gratified on the very night when she  made her curtsey to the Sovereigns. Having created an immense impression, the  Duchess, with eyes as radiant as the family diamonds crowning her imperial  head, returned at midnight to her home in the company of a purring husband. Jim  really felt that Leah had upheld the family name with her insolent beauty, and  moreover, was quite the grandest-looking woman in London, or out of it. When  they arrived in their own drawing-room, and she had emerged a royal court  butterfly from the chrysalis of her cloak, he turned abruptly and took her in  his arms with the hug of a bear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah,&rdquo;  he murmured hoarsely&mdash;&ldquo;oh, Leah!&rdquo; and kissed her fair on the mouth with the kiss  of Pan.</p>
  <p>But  only once did he exercise that connubial privilege, for she released herself  roughly with a sense of intolerable outrage. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather late in the day?&rdquo;  she asked, scornful and angry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pon  my word, Leah, I&rsquo;d be a good husband to you if you would only let me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  as an over-married Turk I am sure you would be admirable. I know you disapprove  of monogamy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the deuce is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  that the Church encourages and society shirks. The Sandal woman can explain the  objection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  winced at her knowledge of his latest love. &ldquo;You said that I belonged to you,&rdquo;  he reminded her sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Officially.  May I ask the reason for this sudden devotion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look so rippin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks  for the belated compliment. I am aware that your love is dependent upon the  eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  what else should it be dependent upon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  heart may have something to do with it, you know&mdash;or rather, you do not know.  Since our conversation when I asked you to buy a yacht I have given up trying  to educate you in the affections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  buy a yacht now&mdash;a dozen yachts, to please you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said the Duchess, with a cold smile; &ldquo;so that Epsom-Newmarket woman has been  nasty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  uttered a bad word under his breath, and flung out of the room in a pet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  play at the club till all&rsquo;s blue,&rdquo; he called out while banging the door, and a  minute later she heard the butler whistle for a hansom.</p>
  <p>The  deserted wife was perfectly aware that Jim&rsquo;s sudden admiration arose from pride  of proprietorship, and objected to be cajoled into righteous matrimonial  principles on such terms. As it was scarcely one o&rsquo;clock she seated herself to  consider if it would be worth while to lift her uxorious pig out of the mire he  loved. A footman with a salver interrupted these creditable meditations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lady called twice to see your Grace this evening,&rdquo; said the man, presenting a  visiting-card, &ldquo;and has now called again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duchess lifted her eyebrows as she lifted the card. &ldquo;At this hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  lady says her business is important, your Grace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  business&mdash;?&rdquo; here her eyes fell on the card, and a swift alteration of  expression changed her into a different and harder woman. &ldquo;Ask Mademoiselle  Aksakoff to join me here,&rdquo; she ordered abruptly.</p>
  <p>The  sword had not yet dropped, but the hair could not suspend it much longer.  Katinka was in England, in London, in her house. And Demetrius? What of him?  Why had he not come also? Leah asked herself these questions with brutal  directness, resolved to shirk nothing of the imminent danger. After the first  dash of dismay her nerves braced themselves for the ordeal, and she advanced to  greet Mademoiselle Aksakoff with a conventional smile, meaning nothing and yet  everything. This gave place to an amazed look when she beheld the haggard  antagonist with whom she had to cross swords.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My&mdash;dear&mdash;girl!  What have you been doing with yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  might well ask. Katinka was no longer the demure nun, but a fierce, goaded  creature of the feline tribe. Dressed quietly in unrelieved black, hatted,  cloaked, and gloved, she presented the appearance of one sorely tried in the  fiery furnace of affliction, and less lucky than Daniel&rsquo;s brethren. That thin  worn face, those hollow eyes, the wry mouth, the dark hair plentifully  bestreaked with grey&mdash;she was demoralised, uncanny, and aggressively cruel. In a  flash the Duchess knew that this untimely visitor knew the truth, and was  prepared to do battle. No quarter would be given by Katinka Aksakoff, and Leah,  with a deep breath, braced herself for an Armageddon duel. The contrast between  the dowdy Russian girl and the magnificently arrayed woman lay entirely in the  garb; otherwise they were cats of the wildest. Their faces took on a marked  resemblance; a stealthy, cunning, sly, guarded expression effaced their  ordinary looks. If Katinka&rsquo;s eyes gleamed dangerously, so did those of Leah; if  Leah held herself like a pantheress about to spring, so did Katinka. In that  splendid room two pre-historic creatures were about to fight over the male.  Here indeed was woman, the female of man. Civilisation was nowhere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know why I have come?&rdquo; asked Katinka, in a voice as hard as her eyes, and those  might have been fashioned of granite.</p>
  <p>Leah,  with flattened ears, so to speak, professed ignorance. She did not intend to  criticise until fully aware of facts. A shake of her head conveyed the denial  and brought forth one bitter word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duchess glanced towards the door, remembering that the servants had not yet  retired and might be within earshot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you mind speaking in a lower tone?&rdquo; she suggested between her teeth, for the  insult struck home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down,&rdquo; ordered Katinka, imperiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  prefer to stand,&rdquo; retorted her antagonist, fighting for the inch.</p>
  <p>Mademoiselle  Aksakoff advanced one step and her eyes probed those of the Duchess. Without  words the situation was adjusted, and in Leah&rsquo;s favour, for the Russian  suddenly sat down with a quick, indrawn breath. By that action the woman who  had done the wrong knew that she was the stronger of the two, and a tyrannical  instinct to bully the weak rose hotly in her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by coming at this late hour and misbehaving?&rdquo; she demanded harshly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know well what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, I never profess to understand the vagaries of a madwoman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this brutal speech Katinka&rsquo;s hand shot into her pocket, but Leah did not move.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  weapon?&rdquo; she asked sneeringly; &ldquo;that would be quite in keeping with your  blatant nationality. Foreigners are so fond of the melodramatic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl withdrew her hand quietly. &ldquo;You are too poor a creature to kill, Lady  James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  smiled at the old title, and passed the remark with a contemptuous shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later  on, perhaps&mdash;who knows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  indeed? It is impossible to foresee what an hysterical lunatic will do. Do you  propose to shoot or stab me, or to blow me up? I understand that bombs are  favoured in your happy country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  crude hostility of the speech was plainly intended to infuriate the Slav-woman,  but it missed the mark aimed at. Katinka looked at the mocker gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  afraid you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  shrugged again; the remark was too futile to be commented upon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you are,&rdquo; went on the other, a trifle roused; &ldquo;else you would have me turned  out by your servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later  on, perhaps&mdash;who knows?&rdquo; repeated the Duchess, using the girl&rsquo;s own words; then  continued soothingly, &ldquo;No; I shall not call the servants and make a scandal,  since your father is my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  accomplice, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an unpleasant word, and how very unsuitable!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what you did in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did nothing in Paris to deserve such a word. Perhaps you mean something else.  You foreigners know the grammar of English, but rarely the meaning of words. I  remarked the same defect in your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I have not yet heard of his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  misunderstanding of my meaning is pretence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ignorance,  I assure you. And as it grows late and I am tired, may I ask you to explain  your business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can do so in one word&mdash;Demetrius.&rdquo; Katinka rose to give full force of expression  to the name, and her voice rose with the utterance.</p>
  <p>Leah  remained perfectly calm, and indulged in badinage. &ldquo;Demetrius? Oh yes, that  horrid little man with the waxed moustache: a doctor or a chemist, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  lover!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no. I have no use for that sort of person; if I had I should certainly not pick  one out of the gutter. Demetrius? Yes,&rdquo; she went on musingly, but watchful of  her enemy, &ldquo;I had almost forgotten him. He went to St. Petersburg, didn&rsquo;t he?  And you loved him, I remember. A queer choice I thought at the time. Well, have  you married him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  grows late and you are tired,&rdquo; mocked Katinka, successfully keeping her temper,  and thereby disappointing the Duchess; &ldquo;we had better not waste time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  yawned. &ldquo;It seems to me that we have been doing nothing else since you came in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius  is in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!  How very interesting! As doctor or Prince?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  an escaped Siberian felon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Leah&rsquo;s face assumed a skilful expression of mingled pity and horror. &ldquo;Poor  little man! He was mad to go to Russia. I thought so when I read his letter,  which I sent you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  forged letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be silly; one would think you were on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Katinka  bit her lip to prevent furious speech, and locked her arms behind her as though  she feared lest temper should engender violence. Leah noted her expression,  however, and retreated towards the bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are talking nonsense,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;and much as I respect your father, I  shall certainly summon the servants to put you out unless you go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not go, and you shall not order your servants to put me out,&rdquo; cried  Katinka, fiercely. &ldquo;I defy you to press the button of the bell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a feeling that the girl had scored on this occasion Leah withdrew her hand,  making the usual excuse: &ldquo;For your father&rsquo;s sake I spare you the indignity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  repeat that I have no father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I repeat that I am tired. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must arrange with me to see Constantine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Constantine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Their  eyes met, and this time Leah won the victory over a woman obviously worn out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Constantine  is Demetrius,&rdquo; explained the Russian, in a fatigued voice and closing her eyes.  &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; She dropped into her seat with a low wail and covered her face.</p>
  <p>Leah  heard the clock strike the half-hour through the sobs of her visitor. She was  absolutely sure that Katinka was at her mercy, and wished to dismiss her,  beaten and crushed. But first it was necessary to learn why Demetrius had not  come also. Leah moved swiftly towards the broken creature, and laid a firm hand  on her heaving shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  got no further. With the elusive spring of a wild animal Katinka flung off the  hand, reared, and struck out. The blow fell fairly on Leah&rsquo;s mouth, and she  found herself mopping up the blood of a deeply-cut lip before she had any clear  idea of what had taken place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you liar, you beast, you devil!&rdquo; cried the Russian, with the savagery of a  Kalmuck tent-woman. &ldquo;I could kill you&mdash;kill you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mad,&rdquo;  mumbled Leah, with the lace handkerchief to her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sane,&rdquo; retorted the other, swiftly. &ldquo;I know all. You lured Constantine to  Paris; you sold him to my father to hide your iniquity. I saw Helfmann the spy;  do you hear&mdash;the spy! I bribed him; it took months to bribe him, but in the end  I bought the truth. My father&mdash;shame to my father&mdash;drugged Constantine at your  table, and Helfmann as a sham doctor took him to Havre, to Kronstadt, to  Moscow. The Grand Duke Sergius&rdquo;&mdash;here she spat when mentioning the hated name&mdash;&ldquo;yes,  he, that beast of beasts, sent him to Siberia for life; ar-r-r&mdash;for life! do you  hear, Judas, Jezebel, animal that you are! I followed there; I followed the man  I loved&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who did not love you,&rdquo; muttered the Duchess, rocking with the pain of her  swollen and bleeding lips. She had seated herself by this time, and did not  seek to stem the torrents of insults.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why?&rdquo; Katinka flung back her head and her nostrils dilated. &ldquo;Because you stole  his heart that he might do your evil bidding. But he loves me now&mdash;with all his  heart and soul he loves me now. I went to Tomsk to aid his escape; I followed  to Sakhalin. I waited and waited, eating my heart out. Oh, my heart!&rdquo; she laid  her hand on her breast; &ldquo;oh, my breaking heart! We escaped&mdash;he did&mdash;I did; we  escaped. Do you hear, you who sold him? There were months of terror and sorrow  and cruel cold. But God was good; He was kinder than man, more merciful than  you, who damned a soul to that frozen hell. God&mdash;the good God, whom I adore and  worship,&rdquo; she fell on her knees, striking her hands together&mdash;&ldquo;He aided us to  reach the waiting ship of Strange, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo;  Leah rose, shaken and sick. &ldquo;Strange!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Katinka  leaped up to face her. &ldquo;The man you bribed with six thousand pounds to take  your sin on his soul. I know all about your wickedness; Strange knows;  Constantine knows. We will tell the world what we know; and you, shamed,  disgraced, beaten, hounded out of your world&mdash;ah, down will you fall&mdash;fall&mdash;unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless?&rdquo;  Leah, gripping a chair and swaying, looked up. &ldquo;Unless?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  come to Southend to see Constantine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I tell everything. I go to your husband.&rdquo; Leah, in spite of her pain, laughed  at the idea. &ldquo;I go to your police. I tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop,  I shall come, since you insist upon it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do&mdash;Constantine likewise. He is ill&mdash;very ill; his eyes are blinded by the glare  of the snows whither you sent him; he is&mdash;oh, my poor angel, my patient saint!&mdash;he  is&mdash;&rdquo; Stopping abruptly, she looked with an evil eye at the woman she had so  shamefully marked. &ldquo;I will leave you to see the wreck you have made of him. You  will come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duchess nodded. &ldquo;But I can explain all,&rdquo; she mumbled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain  it, then, to Constantine,&rdquo; said her enemy, contemptuously. &ldquo;I go now. Meet me  to-morrow at Liverpool Street Station&mdash;at the barrier. We can go to Southend by  the five o&rsquo;clock train. Constantine is on board Strange&rsquo;s ship, which lies off  Southend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Then you mean to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carry  you away? No; you are not worth it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah&rsquo;s  indomitable courage, quelled for the moment, blazed up fiercely. She forgot her  pain, her disfigured mouth, and faced Katinka in a blind rage. &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; she  clenched her hands, and panted like a spent runner. &ldquo;You have said all; I agree  to all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Russian looked at the wounded mouth with a cruel, calm smile, then sauntered  deliberately to the door. There she smiled still more serenely, pointed a  mocking finger at her enemy&rsquo;s wry mouth, and slipped away without a word, and  almost without a sound.</p>
  <p>Leah  sprang to the mirror. Had this woman marred her beauty? The mouth was swollen,  the lips still bleeding; there were wounds within and without, and a rather  loose tooth. Leah could have howled aloud at the shame, the humiliation of her  defeat. That she should be struck, beaten, mastered&mdash;she of all women; she&mdash;she! &ldquo;Ar-r-r!  Augh!&rdquo; she cried, but softly, mindful of danger. Then the thought came to her  that she would have to account for her damaged mouth, and with the thought came  enlightenment. Passing quickly out of the room, she ascended the stairs rapidly  to her room. Half-way up she stumbled and fell. The footman, hearing the fall,  ran up and lifted her. He saw that her mouth was bleeding. Natural enough&mdash;oh,  perfectly natural! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them beastly long trains,&rdquo; explained the footman in  the servants&rsquo; hall.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_32"></a>Chapter 32</b> </h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  knew you to tumble before, Leah,&rdquo; grumbled the Duke, next morning, when  admitted into his wife&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Accidents  will happen,&rdquo; murmured the Duchess, rather lamely, and too much shaken to be  original. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk, Jim&mdash;my mouth is still sore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can you expect if you go a mucker? An&rsquo; th&rsquo; season&rsquo;s startin&rsquo;, too. You&rsquo;ll not  be able to show with that swellin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  week at Firmingham will put me right. Katinka Aksakoff is coming down also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heard  she looked in last night. What made her call at so late an hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  worried about her father,&rdquo; lied Leah, prepared for the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  an almighty row with him over that bounder doctor, I expect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  nodded languidly. &ldquo;M. Aksakoff has gone to Southend. I take his daughter with  me there, to make peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Southend?  There&rsquo;s a hole! What&rsquo;s he doin&rsquo; in that roost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  should I know? I&rsquo;ll reconcile the two if I can, and Katinka can be my companion  at Firmingham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dull  company,&rdquo; confessed Jim, candidly; &ldquo;she never could flirt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will be no drawback,&rdquo; said his wife, dryly. &ldquo;Go away, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  lie am I to tell &lsquo;bout your sickness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  the truth, by way of a novelty; or if you prefer a lie, say that I have  appendicitis. One must be fashionable, even in diseases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Jim, too obtuse to note the irony. &ldquo;Sorry you&rsquo;re so ill. You&rsquo;ve  made an awf&rsquo;l mess of yourself: women will wear such confounded trains. Goo&rsquo;bye  at present. I&rsquo;ll look in at Firmingham durin&rsquo; your week of penance&rdquo;; and,  talking himself out of the room, Jim went about his ordinary nefarious  occupations, feeling that he had behaved as a husband should.</p>
  <p>The  Duchess turned wearily on her pillows and winced. Not with pain, for her mouth,  though still swollen, was much less tender. It was the prospect before her that  hurt. In the evening a difficult interview had to be got through somehow, and  her brain began to forecast the probable result. If Katinka could be believed  it would scarcely prove to be a pleasant one. Demetrius apparently intended to  punish her by blackening an unsoiled character. &ldquo;Such a nasty, revengeful  spirit,&rdquo; thought Leah, feeling ill-used and depressed.</p>
  <p>But,  after all, what could the man say likely to incriminate her, seeing that she  had moved amongst the pitfalls of the plot as delicately as Agag? Demetrius had  conceived and executed the entire scheme, and what he could say would only fit  in neatly with Strange&rsquo;s confession, which the public already knew and  condemned. Her hand could not be traced either in his Parisian journey or in  the drugging of the tea. How was she to know that Helfmann was a police spy, or  that the letter assuring her of the doctor&rsquo;s intended return to Russia had been  deftly forged? Her surface behaviour, at least, was perfectly honest, and would  bear even the scrutiny of an interviewer. She could, taking a broad view of  unpleasant circumstances, defy the creature; but nevertheless felt  instinctively that it would be unwise to dare him to do his worst. Such a  plotting, narrow-minded, sneaking beast would ruin himself to ruin her, and  mud, if thrown persistently, was apt to stick even to the whitest robe. What a  shame that this animal should so persecute her! How hard on a kind-hearted woman,  whose sin, as he called it, was merely an error of judgment. By the time Leah  finished her reflections her frame of mind was one of much-injured innocence.</p>
  <p>Later  in the day, when driving to Liverpool Street Station to keep her hated  appointment, Leah half decided to call on Aksakoff. But second thoughts assured  her that his intervention was quite out of the question. Were Demetrius to be  arrested in British waters the Radical press would howl, and nasty meddling  politicians would ask unnecessary questions in the Commons. It would be wiser,  after all, to fight alone and to the bitter end. If Demetrius thought she would  give in, Demetrius was entirely mistaken. He had yet to learn that she could be  as nasty as hitherto she had been nice. But he was horridly ungrateful, as all  men were. In this way did the arch-plotter salve her conscience and compose her  mind.</p>
  <p>It  was darkish when the brougham arrived at the station, and Leah, glancing about  under the electric lamps, saw Katinka waiting at the ticket-barrier. For the  benefit of an inquisitive maid and an observant groom she addressed her gaily,  though it was not easy to speak with still aching lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> punctual,&rdquo; said the Duchess, pressing an unwilling hand with  ostentatious warmth. &ldquo;Excuse my speaking much. I fell on the stairs last night  after you left and hurt my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  commiserate with you, madame,&rdquo; replied Katinka, sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  good of you. I hope M. Aksakoff will not expect me to chatter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father?&rdquo; echoed the girl, staring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  at Southend, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Leah, impatiently; &ldquo;at least, you told me so last  night. I have instructed my maid to go on to Firmingham, while we travel  straight to Southend. Such a cockney place, isn&rsquo;t it? Then we can get back&mdash;oh,  about what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; returned the Russian, grimly. She now saw through the clever  comedy which was being played.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  understand, Marie,&rdquo; said Leah, turning to her maid, who was all ears and eyes; &ldquo;see  that the brougham is sent in time. Come with me, dear&mdash;there&rsquo;s a reserved  compartment&mdash;at least, I ordered one. Curl, go and look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  prattling to deceive her domestics, Leah adjusted a very thick veil, which hid  from the public a face whose expression was quite at variance with her sweet  nothings. When the two entered the carriage and the train was moving slowly out  of the station, Katinka burst into a harsh laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  congratulate you, Lady James; you should have been a conspirator.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  your dear father told me. Compliments run in your family, apparently. Surely you  do not blame me for putting things right with my servants. They might think it  queer, otherwise, and one cannot be too careful with such creatures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fail to see what good your exceedingly clever explanations will do. Constantine  intends to speak out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about?&rdquo; asked Leah, chafing, and throwing up her veil to manage the girl more  easily with her dominating eyes.</p>
  <p>Katinka,  always fiery, and with slack nerves after her Siberian experiences, almost lost  what temper she had left. &ldquo;Need we keep on your comedy, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I do not know what you mean. One would think that I wished to deceive  people, the way you talk. And after what I have done for you, too&mdash;it&rsquo;s most  ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  pray what have you done, Lady James?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  call me Lady James; your stupid mistakes get on my nerves. Done? Why, I  pretended to fall on the stair to excuse the state of my mouth. Had I been a  nasty, spiteful creature such as you are, I should have given you in charge for  assault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me in charge now,&rdquo; sneered the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might. Don&rsquo;t drive me into a corner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are inconsistent. If you have done nothing wrong, how can I drive you into the  corner you speak of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you are a monomaniac,&rdquo; retorted the Duchess, angrily; &ldquo;you seem to think that I  am the cause of the doctor&rsquo;s exile. I, of all people, who would not hurt a fly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would hurt a dozen flies if anything was to be gained,&rdquo; snapped the other,  irritably. &ldquo;You betrayed my Constantine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did nothing of the sort, as he will understand when he hears what I have to  say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hearing  and believing are two different things, Lady James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  shrugged away the speech. &ldquo;Of course, you are prejudiced, because Demetrius  loves me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mademoiselle  Aksakoff fetched a long, deep breath. &ldquo;Do not try me too far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you intend to assault me again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I even apologise for the blow. I told Constantine this morning of my interview,  and he said that I was wrong. It is for him to deal you justice and punishment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Punishment!  Justice!&rdquo; Leah laughed aloud in sheer rage at her inability to parry these  insults. &ldquo;And for what, pray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Constantine  will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I do not wish a second-hand judgment from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two glared at one another, venomous and defiant. As usual, the younger woman&rsquo;s  eyes fell first, and she retreated to the furthermost corner of the carriage,  while Leah, pulling down her veil, tried to face this most disagreeable  situation. Not another word did they exchange until the ducal servants branched  off at Shenfield Junction, and they had to be publicly amiable. Then, again,  silence reigned until their destination was reached. By that time Leah was more  her old insolent self, and disposed to be unpleasant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you drive or walk?&rdquo; asked Katinka, coldly, when they alighted on the Southend  platform.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walk,  of course. I do not mind at all being recognised, since I have come to see your  father on board this yacht.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain  Strange would be flattered by your description.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duchess laughed contemptuously as they stepped into the street. &ldquo;I am scarcely  responsible for M. Aksakoff&rsquo;s notion of a yacht. Foreigners are so ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are not so clever as Englishmen&mdash;or Englishwomen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except  in trickery and blackmail, where they surpass them,&rdquo; retorted Leah, her petty  rage insisting on having the last word.</p>
  <p>Katinka  permitted her the gratification, and they walked the whole length of the High  Street in grim silence.</p>
  <p>At  a rude quay jutting from the beach of the lower town they boarded a  disreputable boat, rowed by two pirates and steered by a third. The night was  starry but moonless, comparatively calm, and noticeably chilly. Leah shivered  as the boat made for a vivid green riding-light, which shone, an emerald star,  no great distance from the shore. But her shiver might have been an admission  of dread. Katinka took it to be so, and smiled in a gratified way as her enemy  climbed the side of the steamer, which was a veritable gypsy of the sea,  untidy, dirty, and decidedly questionable in honest eyes. Strange did the  honours, loud-tongued and raucous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess  it do my eyes good to see your Grace,&rdquo; was his welcome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue, and don&rsquo;t use my title,&rdquo; she replied furiously.</p>
  <p>Strange&rsquo;s  milk of human kindness turned sour on the instant. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t high-falutin&rsquo;  enough, I s&rsquo;pose. Pity I ain&rsquo;t a dandy skipper of sorts, all hair-oil an&rsquo; giddy  gold tags.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  turned her back without deigning a reply, and looked inquiringly at Katinka.  The girl, with an enigmatic smile on her wan face, led the way down some greasy  stairs, into a stuffy state-room, and opened the narrow door of a side-cabin.  Leah entered and heard the lock click behind her. Evidently Mademoiselle  Aksakoff did not think it judicious to remain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I daresay her ear is at the key-hole,&rdquo; thought the Duchess, contemptuously. She  was trying to preserve her self-respect by heaping obloquy on her rival, but  scarcely succeeded as well as she desired. Then she said &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; twice and with  emphasis.</p>
  <p>The  interjections were not meant for the girl&rsquo;s possible eavesdropping, but to show  Leah&rsquo;s disgust at the close atmosphere of the cabin. It was a nauseous, musky,  sickly odour, which reminded her only too vividly of the monkey-house at the  Zoo. Neither light nor air entered the den, save through the round port-hole  over the bunk, which was unscrewed. But even the briny sea-breeze blowing  softly could not do away with that thick, tainted atmosphere which had provoked  the visitor&rsquo;s exclamations. With her handkerchief to her mouth Leah&rsquo;s eyes  strove to become accustomed to the faint light. She saw dimly a heap of  blankets, but no form was visible beneath, and no face was to be seen. Possible  trickery occurred to her, until a voice came heavily through the fetid gloom.  Then, in spite of its odd, strangled sound, she felt instinctively that  Demetrius was buried somewhere under the clothes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will excuse the absence of a lamp, madame. My eyes are half blinded with the  snow-glare, and very tender.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  strangely you speak!&rdquo; remarked Leah, involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  sore throat,&rdquo; was the hoarse reply. &ldquo;Siberia, as madame must be aware, is not a  summer climate.&rdquo; The wheezy sound ended in a kind of piping whistle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry you have suffered,&rdquo; said the Duchess, at a loss what to say. &ldquo;Ugh, the  smell!&rdquo; she thought, seating herself on a locker, and feeling almost too sick  to control her faculties.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  is too good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  dangerous pause ensued, while Leah wondered what was about to happen. The man  assuredly was Demetrius, and Demetrius was assuredly extremely ill. It was  within the bounds of possibility that he might spring up and kill her. The  thought did not trouble her overmuch. So dangerous a business had to be faced  undauntedly, and she kept down her womanly weakness with masculine strength.  During those slow minutes she could hear the lapping of the waters, on which  the vessel rocked; hear also the laboured breathing of the sick man. This  stopped for a moment, and then did she hear her own easy breaths. Demetrius  evidently heard them also, and had paused to listen. He laughed weakly, softly,  clucking like a fowl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  is very brave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  frightened to death,&rdquo; she assured him, to excite his pity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  breathing tells me otherwise. I am certain, madame, that your pulse beats  regularly, and that your nerves are entirely in order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this a consultation?&rdquo; she asked coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the farewell of two who loved,&rdquo; murmured the hard, thick voice, muffled by  the blankets. &ldquo;That is, madame, of one who loved and of one who did not; and  therein, as M. Heine truly remarks, lies the tragedy of existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demetrius&mdash;Constantine.&rdquo;  Leah felt that she must come to the point and get rapidly through the  interview, if only to escape from the sickening atmosphere. &ldquo;Katinka accuses me  of betraying you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not. I swear I did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed?  Mademoiselle Aksakoff is doubtless mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a way. She wishes to save her father from blame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  a good daughter should. Will you explain further, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  I came, of my own free will, to explain. Katinka told me how ill you were, and  I could not bear to think you should die believing me to be dishonourable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  speaks hopefully of my dying. It would please her, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  What do you take me for? I never loved you as you wished to be loved; but if M.  Aksakoff had not interfered, and we had married, I should have come to love  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  speak of what might have been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. Circumstances are altered. Marriage is out of the question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,  and I am scarcely fit for a bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Leah, anxiously.</p>
  <p>Demetrius  passed over the question. &ldquo;Besides, Captain Strange informed me that your  husband has returned. Madame was doubtless pleased at that marvellous  resurrection, so cleverly managed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Leah, honestly enough. &ldquo;I was not; but circumstances made it imperative  that Jim should return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for me to travel in Siberia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blame  M. Aksakoff, blame M. Aksakoff,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;I am innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  pleased to observe, madame, that as yet I have brought no accusation against  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Katinka  acted as your mouthpiece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not my authority to say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I gather that you do not blame me for your exile?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I with any truth, madame, seeing that you accuse M. Aksakoff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; said Leah, resolutely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I regret that Mademoiselle struck the wrong person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know that she struck me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was informed of it this morning, and express my regret that she acted so  foolishly. Did the blow hurt you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was most painful. I feel it still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  lip is cut, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both  lips&mdash;inside, luckily, so there will be no visible scars. But even now a very  little would make them bleed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Such  was the profound egotism of her nature that she expected further sympathy from  the man she had reduced to such a condition. But the doctor&rsquo;s stock of polite  phrases appeared to be exhausted. In place of a compliment came a hoarse  chuckle, like the cry of an early starling. &ldquo;You appear to approve,&rdquo; said Leah,  ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon;  I mentioned before that Mademoiselle, in my humble opinion, was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was very wrong. I am not accustomed to deal with wild beasts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spare  me, madame; I owe her so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  owe her nothing except revenge for striking me. But I excuse that because she  is ignorant of the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am also ignorant, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall hear it now&mdash;yes, the absolute truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  came the raucous sound, which might have been a laugh or a groan&mdash;Leah could not  tell which.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  truth,&rdquo; murmured the sick man; adding, after a significant pause, &ldquo;I am  waiting, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to Paris with Miss Tallentire,&rdquo; explained the Duchess, beginning anywhere  in her hurry, &ldquo;and Mr. Askew followed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Followed  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. I always detested the boy&mdash;so conceited. He admired Miss Tallentire, and  his liking for me was the passing fancy of a shallow nature. To arouse your  jealousy, M. Aksakoff put it about that Mr. Askew intended to marry me in  Paris. The gossip&mdash;and it was merely gossip&mdash;came to Mrs. Penworthy&rsquo;s ears. That  woman hated me then, and hates me now. To make mischief she told you. You came  over to Paris. There, you remember what took place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at our final meeting. My last memory of your face is seeing it across the  tea-table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had a fit of some kind, and M. Aksakoff called up a Dr. Helfmann, who took you  away in a cab to be cured. Then I received a letter from you, stating that you  were going to Russia. As I fancied you might have settled with M. Aksakoff  about your pardon, of course I quite believed it, and&mdash;and&mdash;I think that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you not know that the letter was forged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  the so-called Dr. Helfmann was a spy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  the coffee&mdash;or rather, that the tea was drugged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  How could I possibly know that M. Aksakoff was using me as his tool? If the tea&mdash;it <i>was</i> tea&mdash;well, if he put anything into the tea, I did not see him do it.  It was M. Aksakoff who gave you into Dr. Helfmann&rsquo;s charge, when you were  insensible. Now, am I to blame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  explanation is eminently satisfactory, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you believe me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would be impolite to doubt a lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  was nonplussed. She was manufacturing conversation, and his comments were  trivial, if not ironical, as she shrewdly suspected. She could not quite arrive  at his real meaning. He avoided answering leading questions, and would neither  accept not decline her asseverations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no more to say,&rdquo; she remarked, with an air of one washing her hands of the  whole affair.</p>
  <p>Again  a deadly silence ensued; again she heard the heavy breathing of the creature  hidden under the heaped blankets; again sounded the drowsy lapping of the water  and the faint sigh of the wind. This time she resolved to make him speak, so  that she might learn precisely what he thought. But the moments passed and no  speech came. Finally it did come, in the unemotional voice of one who speaks in  his sleep. He discoursed on a subject about which she had no desire to hear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paris&mdash;Havre&mdash;Kronstadt!&rdquo;  said the slow, drawling, monotonous tone, &ldquo;and then the weary journey across  the Urals. Oh, the cold and the snows and the bitter storms of Siberia! Chains  and hunger, dirt and rags; and always&mdash;always&mdash;the hopeless future. None loved  me; none lifted me up; none spoke words of kindness. Loneliness and sorrow and  the constant torment of painful memories.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  voice died away in a sob. Leah, desperately anxious to defend herself still  further, would have spoken. But her mouth was dry; her lips ached; tremors  thrilled her body as the nerves twittered, jumped, and quivered. Over the low  bunk she could see the rocking stars as the vessel swung to her anchor. What  glimmer of light there was revealed faintly the piled blankets, and nothing  more. The face was veiled by almost material shadows. And again, drearily and  heavily, rose the thick, muddy voice, without variance in its tones, without  the music of feeling. It might have been, and probably was, a voice from the  tomb, as it surged sluggishly through the fetid gloom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;St.  Petersburg,&rdquo; announced the toneless voice, &ldquo;Moscow, and the farce of a trial.  The waving of a white-gloved hand, and a courtly bow, to dismiss me into pain  and darkness and to a living grave. Nijni-Novgorod, and Mother Volga, who takes  us convicts to her breast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  came the dry chanting of a weird song which made the listener&rsquo;s flesh creep,  and her guilty soul quail. Then again, slowly, wearily, Demetrius began to name  the stations of his cross on the way to the calvary of a final prison. &ldquo;Kazan,  Pianybor, Perm, the bleak Urals, that prison wall of the exile; Ekaterinburg,  Tiumen, the doorstep to the barren cell. Borka, Dobrouna, Oshalka&rdquo;&mdash;the rough  Russian names grated on Leah&rsquo;s ears;&mdash;&ldquo;Yevlevoi and the slow-flowing river, the  prison barge, the black bread, the bitter, biting, burning cold; Tobolsk, with  its deathly mists and clammy darkness of Egypt; the Charity Song&mdash;the weary,  weary Miloserdnaya!&rdquo; He sang another line or two in a cracked voice, and broke  out more humanly: &ldquo;Then the warm sunshine like the smile of the good God, and  days of those gentle winds we shall never breathe more. The flowers and the  winds, the sunshine and the laughing children. Samarof, Sourgout, Narym&rdquo;; he  paused to gather strength for the crying of a name which issued with a sob of  heartfelt agony: &ldquo;Tomsk&mdash;oh, Tomsk! Those long, long days of waiting for what  was to be; the horrible mercies of the unjust. Kyrie eleison! Christe eleison!  Kyrie eleison!&rdquo; She saw the convulsive movements of the blankets, and knew that  he was making the sign of the cross. After the crying to God and His Son came  the protest against the cruelty of man. &ldquo;The weary prison of Tomsk; the road&mdash;the  long, horrible road to the ice-bound coast. Sakhalin, the island of pain, the  hell of the innocent, and a human soul lost. Christe eleison! A loving, sinning  soul for which Thou didst die, lost&mdash;lost&mdash;lost!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah&rsquo;s  nerves ached and shook and shuddered as the account of the vile journey welled  forth smoothly like thick oil. With fixed eyes and fascinated ears she took in  the terrible Odyssey. After another sobbing pause&mdash;the broken creature was  crying bitterly&mdash;the voice recommenced, droning on one note until Leah felt that  she could have screamed if only to vary the sound.</p>
  <p>Demetrius  spoke of the barren wastes of Sakhalin in the Gulf of Ochotsk, where the  freezing straits of Neviski run between mainland and island. He told of  obdurate Cossacks, of cruel gaolers, of the treacherous Gilyak natives, who  prevent the escape of the mortal damned. A note of emotion crept into the  voice, and in its level tones she discerned a faint hope. A smuggled letter,  and the assurance that help was at hand; a corrupted warder, a bribed soldier,  a black starless night, and a desperate escape over deserts of snow. Then came  heart-rending relations of a drifting boat, of suffering and starvation and  cold which burnt to the bone. Leah heard of a brave woman&mdash;&ldquo;my love&mdash;my love,&rdquo;  said the voice tenderly&mdash;toiling with a bought Japanese fisherman to bring the  tiny shallop to a haven beyond the grip of the merciless Muscovite. The weird  tale took her through La Perouse Straits, northward amongst the Kurile Islands,  and into the naked lands of Kamchatka. Here again, as she gathered, the  fugitives were in danger of recapture; but they fled still further north  through the bitter cold, and under a bleak sunless sky, to herd with the  Koriaks. The tormented voice droned ever on about these filthy savages,  fish-eaters, and hunters of the unclean; it shuddered through accounts of  loathsome diseases, and of smoky defiled huts like the hells of Swedenborg. And  the man wailed always, ever and again, of the danger of being retaken, of  terrible suspense, of shattered nerves, and of the eternal strength of a pure  woman&rsquo;s love. The tale ended with painful outbursts of joy at the sight of  Strange&rsquo;s tramp standing towards the inhospitable Siberian coast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peace,  plenty, warmth, food, safety, kindness, hope, love!&rdquo; chanted the voice, broken  up into almost musical gratitude. Then a pause of infinite meaning, ended by a  dry clucking chuckle. &ldquo;And I lived that I might see you,&rdquo; breathed the man she  had cast into the hell he had described. Leah&rsquo;s hair bristled at the roots. The  speech was so terribly significant. But her soul still fought against the  inevitable punishment, whatever that might be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  my fault,&rdquo; she panted eagerly; &ldquo;horrible, horrible&mdash;but not my fault! Oh,  believe&mdash;believe me, Constantine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have asserted your innocence before,&rdquo; murmured the sick man, ironically; &ldquo;and  now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;  her heart almost stood still, so intensely did she listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must part for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  devote what remains of my life to the woman who has saved me&mdash;to the angel who  drew me out of the frozen deeps of hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and  you&mdash;you will say&mdash;nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  boat leaves here to-night for a place which need not be mentioned. I go out of  your life for ever, and silent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  thank you&mdash;thank you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what, madame, since you assure me of your innocence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  felt awkward. She had said too much. &ldquo;Katinka is so prejudiced that I thought&mdash;I  thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  voice died away. The lie would not come forth in the presence of this dying  wretch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  thought she would be jealous. Ah, no, madame.&rdquo; Demetrius paused and clucked  again like a brooding hen. &ldquo;She permits you to kiss me with a last kiss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Leah half rose, and fell again, recoiling with a cry of terror at the prospect  of setting the final seal on her treachery, as did Judas in the Garden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg of you, my first love. One kiss to dismiss me into the silence&mdash;to close my  mouth for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  he did doubt her; he did not believe. All her lies were discounted; all his  conversation was merely ironical and make-believe. He held her in a vice, and  release would come only when she submitted to a revolting caress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not&mdash;I dare not,&rdquo; she stammered, shrinking against the wall in an agony of  physical fear from an object which a guilty imagination revealed as loathsome  to sight and touch; &ldquo;you&mdash;you have no right to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  right of love,&rdquo; said the weary voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  cypher letters&rdquo;; and a lean hand held out a packet, drawn from under the  discoloured blankets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  one kiss, madame&mdash;for one kiss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;  groaned Leah, and snatched eagerly.</p>
  <p>Packet  and hand disappeared swiftly, and the voice whistled in a jeering manner. &ldquo;One  kiss, madame, one kiss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  still fought. &ldquo;My mouth is sore. I am&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  kiss&mdash;one kiss&mdash;the last and the best; or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah,  writhing against the wall, gasped soundlessly. In that last word there was the  sound of a terrible threat. It was the knell of respectability, of ease and  luxury, and of all that makes life worth living. A single caress would buy the  evidence; a touch of her mouth, and she would be free for ever and ever and  ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  kiss, then,&rdquo; she muttered; and with all her soul crying strenuously against the  horror, she tottered forward. &ldquo;One&rdquo;; her lips sought the place where a mouth  might be supposed to be waiting. Two arms flew up and gripped her.</p>
  <p>She  could not scream, for the arms dragged her down, belted her like iron bands.  Her mouth was on his, his lips were on hers. She writhed, silent and agonised,  in the horrible caress, in the abominable embrace, trying to free herself in  vain. Demetrius placed his lean hand on the back of her head and absolutely  ground her mouth against his own. She could feel the wounds break and bleed,  sanctifying the kiss of Judas.</p>
  <p>His  arms relaxed, she flung backward, and the long-withheld scream broke forth  shrill and vehement. As if in answer to that terrible summons, Katinka tore  open the door and entered with a smoky paraffin lamp. With one hand the girl  thrust the shaking, sobbing woman forward, with the other held the lamp towards  the face peering out of the blankets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my God!&rdquo; shrieked Leah, and sprang from the cabin, pursued by the cackling of  broken laughter.</p>
  <p>She  made for the deck&mdash;for the side&mdash;for anywhere, to be out of the sight of that  face; that face which would haunt her till she died. Strange, in silence,  handed her, sobbing and whimpering, down the black side, where the boat  received her. She dropped in a heap, and beside her dropped from Katinka&rsquo;s hand  a packet of letters. Above from an open port-hole came clucking, cackling,  chuckling laughter, insanely gleeful, and the silent stars of God shone over  land and sea.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_33"></a>Chapter 33</b> </h2>
  <p>So  Leah won after all. She went out with a definite purpose, and returned with  that purpose achieved; yet not fully, since what she desired had been flung to  her as a bone to a dog. In the panic-stricken flight from the field she carried  with her the spoils of victory and something less desirable. The price of her  good name, the security of her position, the entire triumph&mdash;these, as she well  knew, had been gained by shameful self-surrender. Indeed, it could scarcely be  called a victory, seeing that she had succumbed to the masterful brutality of  her enemy. Nevertheless&mdash;and she derived comfort from the thought&mdash;it could not  be termed a defeat. Her social glory yet flamed unextinguished; her character  could not be smirched, and she could yet hold up her head to flout the  found-out of her sex. But something bitter spoiled the flavour of these sweets.  She had lost her belief in the fetish; its spell of good luck was broken; her  nerve was gone, and with it self-respect. All she desired was to hide herself  amongst familiar surroundings, that their very familiarity might fence in her  quailing soul from impossible danger. And that the danger could be so described  by her intellect revealed a demoralised will.</p>
  <p>The  cypher letters attesting her share in the conspiracy she destroyed by fire.  They were genuinely those she had written, and the number was correct, so, when  their ashes floated up the chimney, Leah drew the long, deep, relieved breath  of one whose chains have been struck off. Yet, even at the moment of release,  she shuddered to the core of her being. The ghost of a futile crime was laid,  but the ghost might return. Demetrius had truly parted with all tangible  evidence, and his unsubstantiated story would be whiffed away as too romantic for  belief. Moreover, M. Aksakoff, for the sake of his own good name, and that of  his Government, would swear to her innocence of this gross intrigue. She was  safe&mdash;absolutely, entirely, and wholly safe. The world would never know how she  had capered on the verge of an abyss, or how nearly she had missed her footing.  But something&mdash;her conscience probably&mdash;told her that an unseen Judge was summing  up her delinquencies; that she was being weighed in the balance and would be  found wanting, even though her kingdom did not pass from her. This Judge,  impartial, terribly quiet, severely righteous, might have been God; and He was  God, although she refused recognition. Her tormented soul inspired her with the  dread of an all-seeing and condemning eye; but she resolutely declined to admit  the Maker, the Judge, or the Unseen in any way. Shadows should not frighten  her, for these were not of the eating, drinking, merry-making world. All the  same, shadows, elusive and unexpected, did strike terror to her guilty heart,  and she reluctantly knew herself to be a broken woman. In those earlier hours  of safety this knowledge was very insistent.</p>
  <p>The  week of her retirement passed pleasantly enough. She doctored her bruised lips,  mended their torn skin, and argued occasionally with her shameful soul. The  quiet life of silent hours in the midst of civilised balms partially restored  her courage, but not as entirely as she could wish. Piecing her broken nerves  together as best she could, she strove to remount the pinnacle of supreme and self-sufficient  egotism whence she had fallen. But Humpty-Dumpty could not be set up again, try  as she might to replace him. During those brooding hours Leah recovered much,  but not all. The week&rsquo;s end found her cured of the skin-deep blow, and  outwardly the same insolent, radiant beauty of an adoring world. But she knew  herself to be a changed being; the pantheress had become a hare, although less  innocent. The sword of her tongue was still sharp, but the shield of  self-righteousness was broken, and a keen-eyed antagonist sufficiently  assertive could have reduced her to the same moral pulp that the interview with  Demetrius had left her. Woe to the vanquished indeed! What remained but that  she should receive the wooden foil of retirement from Destiny and leave the  arena for ever. Her soul protested against this tame submission, so with  indomitable courage she braced herself to further battle. With the world, that  is, not with Demetrius. His abominable kiss had sapped her forces. She could  face social enemies, she could defy the Eternal, she could encounter the fiends  of hell, but not the man who had flung her into the dust&mdash;who had trailed her,  and was still trailing her, at his chariot wheels. Certainly he had steamed  into the unknown, and she would never behold him more. But his black influence  remained and made itself felt at untoward moments.</p>
  <p>Jim  paid his promised visit almost at the end of her seclusion, and was disposed to  be disagreeable on the plea that his wife had lied unnecessarily. Being  truthful himself, when there was nothing to be gained by swerving from the path  of rectitude, Jim abhorred a wasted fib, and proceeded to condemn Leah for  shooting an aimless arrow from her mental quiver. It was the most pensive hour  of the summer twilight when Jim began his sermon, and he preached in his wife&rsquo;s  sitting-room. Darby sat beside Joan, who lay languidly on a sofa. What a  perfect and touching picture of connubial felicity! If only a reporter of  backstair gossip had been present to describe this middle-class domesticity of  these great leaders of fashion, Brixton might have learned an edifying lesson  from Belgravia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I do call it hard on a fellow,&rdquo; complained the Duke&mdash;&ldquo;jolly hard&mdash;that you can&rsquo;t  talk straight, Leah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I did you would scarcely feel flattered. What is it now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aksakoff!  Says he was never near Southend. Swore till all was blue that he&rsquo;d never set  eyes on that girl for months an&rsquo; months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  sad deprivation for so affectionate a father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, he wants to know where she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  should I know?&rdquo; replied the Duchess, indifferently. &ldquo;She chose to remain at  Southend, and I returned here alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  were you doin&rsquo; at Southend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is my business, Jim!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine  also. You said something that wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really?  The Accuser of the Brethren in the pulpit with a vengeance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duke stared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite sure you don&rsquo;t. Stop talking, please. I am too ill to be worried.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rats,&rdquo;  said Jim, elegantly; &ldquo;you look like a picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  permit me the privilege of one, and do not ask for replies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duke strolled to the window in a huff, and surveyed his property with sulky  looks. Leah sat up on her sofa and pondered as to how much she should say and  how much leave unsaid. Jim had always been under the impression that Demetrius  had done his dirty work for money, and the truth would not probably strike him  as amusing. Leah could easily have conceived and told a pretty fairy tale, as  she was always resourceful in the way of fiction; but the sight of his pink,  fatuous face filled her with rage. Why should he be a beast with women, and she  a vestal with men? Was not sauce for the gander sauce for the goose also? She  determined to tell him the whole brutal affair, with certain reservations  concerning the betrayal of Demetrius. Jim had few moral scruples, but what he  had would be averse to the betrayal of an accomplice, however dangerous. Yes;  she would tell him enough to annoy him, and shake him out of his aggravating  complacency. Also she wanted some one in whom to confide. But how to bring up  the subject again without pandering to her husband&rsquo;s desire to be master?</p>
  <p>He  gave her the chance immediately. Like a bulldog, Jim never let go of anything  he had once gripped. Into his thick head had crept some idea of a mystery,  connected with Southend and with his wife&rsquo;s visit thereto. Therefore he stared  out of the window until he thought she was more amenable to reason, and then  came back to his seat with the old question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you go to Southend?&rdquo; he asked, doggedly.</p>
  <p>Leah,  not yet ready, fenced. &ldquo;I told you why I went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you didn&rsquo;t. Aksakoff says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he does. Did you ever know a diplomatist who told the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!  That comes well from you, considering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew that white lies were political privileges. Besides, Aksakoff is too  ashamed of Katinka to tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  she been doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked the Duke, alertly. He had the soul of a knitter in the  sun for gossip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rescuing  Demetrius,&rdquo; answered Leah, curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!!!&rdquo;  Jim turned white and purple and red and green like a rainbow, and spluttered at  the mouth. His wife, eyeing him coldly, did not think this exhibition of  genuine fear a pretty sight. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll&mdash;why, he&rsquo;ll&mdash;tell,&rdquo; gasped Jim, gulping down  an extremely serviceable word, which better fitted his feelings than  surroundings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a question of money, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  I chose to tell you. I always do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  there ever such a trying woman? Jim gulped down another out-of-place oath, and  strode noisily up and down the room. He halted at intervals to tell his wife  precisely what he thought of her. As the room was isolated, and there was no  danger of eavesdropping servants, he indulged in a raised voice and a flow of  language which revealed his very limited vocabulary. Leah, with her chin on her  knuckles and a round elbow on the sofa cushion, listened unmoved, and looked as  though she were having her photograph taken. Jim might have been executing his  dance before a graven image for all the emotion she showed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  had enough of this,&rdquo; shouted his Grace, maddened by a disdainful silence. &ldquo;Just  you explain, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;why, hang it, I&rsquo;ll forget that I am a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me that you have forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  You would drive a saint mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lionel  is perfectly sane, and he is the sole saint I have met.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t  you afraid of my striking you?&rdquo; demanded Jim&rsquo;s bulldog nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horribly  afraid. Can&rsquo;t you see how I tremble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Poor  Jim. He was quite at the end of his resources. Mrs. Penworthy always quailed,  when he was in his tantrums; Lady Sandal fought fairly and squarely, slang for  slang: but this calm, smiling she-fiend only sat like a dummy, waiting for him  to do what she very well knew he would never dare to do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if you&rsquo;re a woman,&rdquo; groaned the Duke, returning beaten and baffled and  completely exhausted to his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder, too, seeing what you have made me put up with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  now, I&rsquo;ve always treated you well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  other women better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  other women?&rdquo; growled Jim, on his guard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know very well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.  I know nothin&rsquo;, not even why you&rsquo;re bullyraggin&rsquo; me. I swear,&rdquo; cried Jim,  pathetically, to the ceiling, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s uncommonly hard for a cheery chap like  me to be tied to a woman who&mdash;who&mdash;who&mdash;&rdquo; Here words failed him, and he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on. I admire your descriptions of my personality. They are so extraordinarily  vivid and true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  ain&rsquo;t what she ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah&rsquo;s  opportunity to break the ice had come, and locking her hands together, she  gazed pensively at the Duke, who wriggled uneasily on his seat. &ldquo;How did you  guess, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess  what?&rdquo; demanded the tormented man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I am not what I ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duke stared aghast. &ldquo;Then you ain&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Demetrius might say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah!&rdquo;  He sprang up with clenched fists and his face took on a direfully black  expression, which rejoiced her heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim,  I believe&mdash;really, I believe that you have some love for me after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  hang your fine talk. Demetrius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have kissed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  dared to kiss you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dared to kiss him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  devil!&rdquo; He suddenly raised his fist. Leah never winced, although he towered  over her with his mouth working and his eyes animal in their unconsidering  passion. It was impossible to strike, although his heart cried out that she  ought to die. With an oath&mdash;it came out savagely this time&mdash;the fist dropped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  have a divorce,&rdquo; muttered Jim, and plunged for the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I kissed a man. Nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kissin&rsquo;  doesn&rsquo;t stop at kissin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  with you, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah!&rdquo;  he turned and reclosed the door, which his rage had wrenched open. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve  got a beastly tongue, and all that; but I could have sworn that you were as  pure as my mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  and so you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?  After you confessin&rsquo; that you kissed Demetrius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;  Leah shuddered, as a picture after the style of Wiertz rose to her mind&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;I  kissed a thing which was once Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he dead, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  if he were. Ugh! That kiss was the most horrible thing I ever had to do in my  life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you do it, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was forced to,&rdquo; she said faintly, and nausea made her place a handkerchief  suddenly to her lips.</p>
  <p>The  Duke returned for the third time to his seat and looked into her changing face  with round inquiring eyes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in this I don&rsquo;t catch on to,&rdquo; he  muttered; then, with gruff tenderness, and a timid caress from which Leah did  not shrink, &ldquo;What is it, old girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Duchess laughed. It was amusing to find her husband playing the spring  bachelor. &ldquo;I believe you love me,&rdquo; said she, recovering her colour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know I do, only you keep me at arm&rsquo;s length.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  I not cause?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wouldn&rsquo;t have, if you behaved as a fellow&rsquo;s wife should,&rdquo; said the Duke,  bluntly. &ldquo;Drop skirtin&rsquo; round the bush and plunge in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  admired and respected him in this peremptory mood, and for once showed no disposition  to use her sharp tongue. Instinct told her that she had at length reached the  end of Jim&rsquo;s tether, and that her easy-going bulldog was inclined to curl his  lips. Therefore did she relate picturesquely and half-truthfully all her doings  since the beginning of things in the gallery. For the time being her story  broke off with the return of his Grace.</p>
  <p>Jim  listened with praiseworthy self-control. He certainly growled and scowled at  the relation of that early loss, which had bound Demetrius to the service of  the woman who betrayed him; but her artless confession robbed the butterfly  caress of half its iniquity. Sometimes he grunted admiration of her pluck  during the perils of his absence, and grinned when she detailed the  melodramatic interview with Strange. Most of the time his eyes searched her  face to make certain that she was telling the truth. He believed she was,  although she kept back the precise way in which Demetrius had departed for  Siberia. But she laid enough of this particular blame on Aksakoff&rsquo;s back to  make Jim swear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  mean, dirty, foreign hound,&rdquo; cursed Jim, between his teeth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to  be an angel, but if I&rsquo;d dropped to that&mdash;&rdquo; he shook his fist with a scarlet  face. &ldquo;An&rsquo; to think Aksakoff should dare to make use of your room&mdash;the rotten  cur. I&rsquo;ll tell him what I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  not, Jim. Let sleeping dogs lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sleepin&rsquo;  mongrels,&rdquo; muttered the Duke. &ldquo;All right; but don&rsquo;t you ever speak to him  again. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  blared out the order in a regimental manner, and Leah nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear,&rdquo; she said meekly, &ldquo;we must draw the line somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  nodded and gloomed, and rumbled something about Aksakoff that certainly was not  a benediction. Then he harked back to his leading question, which had not yet  been answered. &ldquo;Why did you go to Southend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Katinka,  who had rescued Demetrius from Sakhalin Island, made me go to see him. I had to  obey, else there might have been trouble. The man was ill on board Strange&rsquo;s  steamer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange?  Thought we paid the cad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  did.&rdquo; Leah frowned at the recollection of the sum. &ldquo;But he had some liking for  Demetrius, and helped him to escape, worse luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now, don&rsquo;t say that. Siberia&mdash;&rdquo; Jim shuddered. &ldquo;Beastly place, Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  The climate is quite decent if you make up your mind. I don&rsquo;t believe those  convict creatures suffer so much as they say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  told the lie without sign of emotion, but all the same felt an inward qualm at  the memory of the doctor&rsquo;s terrible narrative.</p>
  <p>The  Duke chewed his moustache meditatively. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you saw Demetrius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;  Leah covered her face and rocked. &ldquo;To live with that in my thoughts, and to  think that I kissed It.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you?&rdquo; demanded Jim, furiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  get the cypher letters connected with the insurance plot,&rdquo; she replied, looking  up; then detailed with necessary suppressions the greater and least repulsive  part of her nauseous visit to the tramp steamer. The story sounded by no means  pretty, and all her courage was necessary to enable her to arrive at finis.</p>
  <p>When  she did the Duke sprang up in a pelting rage. &ldquo;My wife to be treated like that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the treatment was not so bad,&rdquo; lied the Duchess, easily. &ldquo;Of course, my mouth  was sore with the fall on the stairs, but I managed to touch the lips of that&mdash;that&mdash;  Ugh! ugh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go to Southend to-morrow,&rdquo; announced the Duke, frowning. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thrash  Demetrius, poor devil, but I&rsquo;ll hammer the life out of that second-hand  skipper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t find the boat there, Jim. I made inquiries, and learnt that it left, as  Demetrius said it would, shortly after my visit. And we are quite safe. That  kiss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  the kissin&rsquo; alone,&rdquo; cried Jim, turning on her fiercely. &ldquo;Of course, I see you  couldn&rsquo;t quite help it; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  &lsquo;but&rsquo; at all,&rdquo; contradicted Leah, sharply. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t bought back those  cypher letters in that way the whole story might have come out. And then, Jim&mdash;well,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do&mdash;I do.&rdquo; Jim groaned and dropped on the sofa beside her. &ldquo;Oh, what fools we  were to go into that insurance business!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was my fault, dear. Don&rsquo;t worry. Demetrius will die soon, and Strange has his  blackmail. We are entirely safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Katinka?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said the Duchess, with a flippancy she was far from feeling, &ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;ll  sit by the grave of that man for the rest of her days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  sure he&rsquo;s dyin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  She turned pale, and her voice quavered. &ldquo;Such an object could not possibly  live. It would be a&mdash;a&mdash;sin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  his trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say. I don&rsquo;t want to say. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s too beastly for words.  Ugh! He looked&mdash;looked&mdash;oh!&rdquo; Leah&rsquo;s mouth worked like a rebuked child, and she  burst into tears&mdash;into real womanly tears of shame and terror and outraged  modesty. &ldquo;That horrible kiss&mdash;oh, that horrible kiss!&rdquo; she wailed, pinching his  shoulder in her hysterical emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  old girl,&rdquo; said Jim, softly, and put his arm round her.</p>
  <p>For  once she appreciated marital sympathy, and learned that woman was not made to  live alone. Leaning her cheek thankfully against the rough tweed of his coat,  she sobbed vehemently, a frightened and crushed creature. Jim felt that he was  a married man after all, and administered gruff consolation. It worried him to  see this high-spirited woman break down so utterly. &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; said he,  tenderly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right, old girl. You&rsquo;ve got me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God,&rdquo; murmured the beaten atheist.</p>
  <p>Jim  thought she must be going out of her mind. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; That she should thank  a God she did not believe in, and for a husband whom hitherto she had always  scorned, quite frightened him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that, Leah?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God for you,&rdquo; sobbed the Duchess, brokenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my aunt,&rdquo; muttered the startled husband; then proceeded to fresh consolation: &ldquo;Well,  then, I&rsquo;ll break the head of any bounder who dares to say a word against you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re wicked, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Other  people are as bad,&rdquo; said the Duke, stoutly, &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;d get a  Sunday School prize. &lsquo;Course it ain&rsquo;t much good racin&rsquo; in blinkers. We&rsquo;re a bad  lot, the pair of us. I&rsquo;ve behaved like a rotter, and worse, while you&rsquo;re like  something I can&rsquo;t think of. Seems to me, Leah, we&rsquo;ve been runnin&rsquo; awf&rsquo;ly  crooked. Let&rsquo;s make a fresh start from scratch, and go straight for the future.  Tandem, y&rsquo; know,&rdquo; suggested Jim; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be wheeler, as usual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must make the best of things, I suppose,&rdquo; whimpered Leah, drying her eyes, and  still too much unstrung to realise her regeneration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  about it. We&rsquo;ll give sin a rest for a bit. I&rsquo;ll chuck that woman, and be your  husband. I swear, Leah, I&rsquo;ll be a Methodist parson sort of husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Duchess, alarmed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mistake to overdo things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  laughed, and she laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t suppose I could keep on that game for long,&rdquo; said her husband; &ldquo;but I  mean that I&rsquo;ll be awf&rsquo;ly square, an&rsquo; footle after you round the town. It&rsquo;s th&rsquo;  sort of thing good husbands do, y&rsquo; know. Give us a kiss, old girl, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll  begin our married life all over again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  obeyed very contentedly, and nestled in Jim&rsquo;s strong arms like an innocent  schoolgirl. She felt worn-out and tired, and drowsy from excess of emotion;  felt also that here was a much-desired haven for a worried woman. &ldquo;Dear old  Jim!&rdquo; she sighed, and Jim kissed her again.</p>
  <p>The  light was dying out of the sunset sky, and the room filled with pale warm  shadows. The reconciled pair sat silently on the sofa in the gathering  darkness, locked in a close embrace. The remorseful Jim felt that they were  prisoners in the same dock, and anxiously paved a certain place with the very  best intentions. Leah went to sleep, thanks to a less tender conscience.</p>
  <p>To  the world these two were the prosperous and happy Duke and Duchess of Pentland;  to themselves, a misguided couple driven to do wrong by circumstances; but to  God&mdash;what did they appear in God&rsquo;s sight? Remorse is not repentance, and remorse  was the sole feeling of which they were capable. Leah&rsquo;s sleep was the slumber  of the worn-out; Jim&rsquo;s self-promised reformation the result of shame. Shallow  beings, miserable creatures, they could not plumb the depth of their  wrong-doing. To them, sins were faults, and they were governed less by the  Sermon on the Mount than by the laws of society. Indeed, it is questionable if  either one of them was aware that such a sermon had been preached; but both  knew to a hair how far they could go without being ostracised.</p>
  <p>Jim  was the better of the two, for the cold, brutal story told by his wife made him  hot with the public-school shame of having done things which no fellow could  do. The drastic codes of Eton and Harrow and Rugby and Winchester came to his  mind, and he saw how he had sinned against the primitive laws of honour.  Without oaths, he swore to lead a better and cleaner life with Leah to help  him. He would be charitable and a good landlord, and take the chair at public  dinners, and speak in the Lords, and chuck Lady Sandal&mdash;who was too expensive&mdash;and  drop gambling to a certain extent, and not swear more than necessary, and&mdash;and&mdash;do  what a man in his high position ought to do.</p>
  <p>It  will thus be seen that poor Jim&rsquo;s ideas of reformation were crude. He felt this  himself, poor man, in his narrow brain; and like the child he really was,  looked down to ask his clever wife&rsquo;s advice. He had no time to consider the  irony of the thing, even if it had occurred to him, for discovering that Leah  was sound asleep, he wondered hugely. From the placid expression of her face it  was very plain that her crimes had not followed her into Dreamland. Jim  whistled softly, marvelling that she could slumber so immediately after what  she had told him. Laying her gently back on the sofa, he summoned her maid, and  went about his own business. This was to begin reformation without loss of  time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must help Leah to be good,&rdquo; said the new broom.</p>
  <p>But  first he had to reform himself, and set about the first step, or what he  conceived to be the first step, with the enthusiasm of the very bad person made  uncomfortable by remorse. The vicar of Firmingham received a visit from his  patron just as he was about to enjoy a well-earned dinner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lionel,&rdquo;  said the Duke, nervously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; to communion in a month. Could you get me  whitewashed in that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  stared, and looked upward. Strange to say the heavens did not fall.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_34"></a>Chapter 34</b> </h2>
  <p>Were  a purblind generation convinced of the invaluable blessings of sorrow, trouble  would be robbed of its sting. Ignorance and fear make the unenlightened bemoan  their burdens, or shirk bearing them, as they should be borne, with the  strength of hope. Chastening is the gift of the eternal love, and those happy  few who know this submit with joy to the improving rod. But worrying is not  submission, nor is grumbling a recognition of curative effects. To be manful,  to be daring, to be so entirely wise from the learning of the lesson as to  extract the sweet from the bitter, thus do we prove ourselves worthy of that  suffering which God bestows in mercy and in pity. Troubles, if rightly understood,  deepen the most shallow character, purify the most soiled soul. They begin in  woe but they end in joy. When the lesson is learned, then comes the holiday&mdash;or  more precisely, the holy-day&mdash;of peace and gladness.</p>
  <p>Jim,  in his simple way, understood that out of apparent evil great good had come to  himself and Leah. Never before had they understood each other so well; never  before had they forgathered with less friction. The Duke&rsquo;s reformation was as  genuine as his embryonic soul was capable of making it. He felt desperately  ashamed of himself at the communion table, and shame of self, provided the  physical ego be not considered, is the beginning of repentance, which leads to  hope, which brings pardon and solace to the uneasy, sinful heart. Jim did not  become a saint by any manner of means, but he tried by fits and starts to be a  better man, and so, with true though faltering zeal, advanced towards the  light. And it was much gained that so once self-satisfied a man should  acknowledge himself to be at all in need of improvement. The recalled code of  schoolboy honour helped him to amend the less drastic rules of the society man.  Could Jim have only gone still farther back, and remembered helpful nursery  prayers and childish faith, he might have seen even more clearly how to utilise  his mistakes. But he was yet a spirit in embryo, and his receptive powers were  not great.</p>
  <p>Leah  did not keep pace with her husband on the upward path. When the danger was  brought to naught, and her nerves became more normal, she forgot everything  with the alacrity of a hardened heart. The wind of the Spirit had but troubled  the surface of her nature; its depths remained undisturbed. Within a fortnight  her dear devil of egotism returned, and she tore out of her book of life the  disagreeable page, which she declined to read for the second time. Certainly  she retained so much grace and memory as not to laugh at Jim&rsquo;s efforts to be  good, and she was less ready than of yore to see and comment upon his obvious  failings. But she secretly wondered that he should try to be pious, when there  was no worldly advantage to be gained by such dullness. Besides, Jim, with the  zeal of the newly converted, began to preach in a stammering, shamefaced way  about the duties they owed to themselves in particular and to society at large.  He even looked up <i>Noblesse oblige</i> at the tail-end of the dictionary, and  quoted the platitude to Leah. On that occasion she had laughed consumedly; but,  truth to say, Jim&rsquo;s sermons bored her immensely. She preferred those of Lionel,  who, as a professional guide to glory, knew his business, whereas poor dear Jim  was hopelessly muddled.</p>
  <p>Therefore,  while the Duke laboriously tried to be good, and succeeded but doubtfully, Leah  was coquetting deliriously with the world, the flesh, and the many agreeable  devils of her acquaintance. She improved her former extravagances into  something worse, and revenged herself for being agreeable to Jim by letting  both friends and enemies have the full benefit of her witty, cruel tongue. The  few who did not come under its lash were in ecstasies at her sparkling  conversation, and the many who did made themselves pronouncedly pleasant out of  mortal fear. Leah danced and sang through the season with the insolent glee of  a woman who knows her position to be unassailable. Jim wondered at her short  memory, and tried to refresh it; but that she would not endure, and declined  even to hear the name of Demetrius. Moreover, as M. Aksakoff had been  translated to Copenhagen, there was no need to smooth matters over between him  and the Duke. Everything was safe, everything was ripping, and she felt that  her latest <i>pas de seul</i> was being executed on firm ground. She had  skipped in the very nick of time from that dangerous old mount which had  erupted so feebly.</p>
  <p>And  no one could say but what she did her best to be amiable. Late in the season  she met and congratulated Mr. and Mrs. Askew; she told Lady Richardson how she  admired her courage&mdash;underlined&mdash;in marrying that handsome pauper, Captain Lake;  and forgivingly did she condole with Mrs. Penworthy, when the unexpected death  of Freddy, from overwork, left that evergreen hack a widow whom no admirer  wished to marry. Lady Canvey was most tenderly considered, and Wallace, the  globe-trotting cynic, on Leah&rsquo;s introduction, amused the stay-at-home old lady  by special command. The sedate Hengists thought even more of the Duchess than  they had done of Lady Jim, and she was often asked to bore herself in their  protective company. She gave Sir Billy Richardson a smiling time at one of the  ducal seats, and invited Joan Kaimes to Curzon Street for a week of shopping  and frivolity. Also bazaars and charity concerts, and meetings about the  unemployed aristocracy, took up her attention. The fashionable congregation of  an exclusive church beheld her regularly in its midst, and heard the audible  admission that she was a miserable sinner&mdash;a most touching confession for a  truly good Duchess to make. Then she befriended a bishop, who was not too  straight-laced, and induced him to preach a scientific sermon in Lionel&rsquo;s  church, of which Lionel, very nastily, did not approve. Oh, it was a merry  time, when the grapes were ripe and the first-fruits of her ducal harvest were  being gathered in. The Duchess of Pentland won golden opinions even from the  censorious. Things could not have been better managed by the discarded fetish,  and Leah admitted that in this respectable orgy the birthday of her life had  come.</p>
  <p>During  this meteoric career it surprised every one that she should choose to retire  suddenly. Fashion clamoured at her closed doors; society journals wondered and  lamented; individual friends expressed themselves puzzled; and in print and  conversation the freak of a Duchess who chose to disappear was freely  discussed. It was as though the noonday sun should set unexpectedly. Leah&rsquo;s  radiant orb had blazed triumphantly for a few months, paling the lesser stars  of society, and then&mdash;had vanished. The Duke, when applied to for an  explanation, stated that she had gone abroad, because her health was&mdash;hum&mdash;hum&mdash;hum.  She crossed the Channel alone, too, which looked odd. People began to talk and  to invent reasons to explain the inexplicable. But not even the most daring  hinted at a connubial disagreement. Jim would have stopped any such rumour at  once with high words. Not that it could arise, seeing that he thanked God  publicly every Sunday for possessing a wife whose price was far above rubies.  But whatever had happened, whatever might be the reason, it was indisputable  that the beautiful and wealthy and clever and popular Duchess of Pentland had  retired from the world in her heyday of social success.</p>
  <p>Lionel  was the first to hear of her when she returned unexpectedly to Firmingham,  after a month&rsquo;s sojourn on the Continent. One day in the chilly grey autumn  weather he received a note asking him to call at four o&rsquo;clock, and went  unthinkingly to pass through what he afterwards remembered as the most painful  hour of his life. He fancied, when setting out, that Leah merely wished to see  him about the Duke. It might be that Jim, with the Old Adam leaven still  working within, had broken out again, and that Lionel was summoned to call the  sinner a second time to repentance. But the Duke, as he gathered from old  Colley, was vegetating at Hengist Castle. It was impossible that the Old Adam  could emerge from his penitential cell in so respectable and moral a  neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>Leah  received her cousin in the sitting-room of her Lady Jim days, where they had  twice talked seriously. Later on it appeared that she had a special reason for  selecting an apartment sanctified by the vicar&rsquo;s endeavour to improve her into  a moderately presentable angel. It was a charming and tastefully decorated  room, and the Duchess was as tastefully decorated and as charming as her  surroundings. She sat in a deep chair by a brisk fire, dressed with that  perfect choice of colour and material which always distinguished her. The  delicate blue of her frock, and a selection of certain filigree silver  ornaments, matched marvellously with her splendid red hair and sapphire eyes.  Lionel noted an unusual pallor, but thought that he had never seen her look  more lovely. Apparently she had been reading, for she dropped her handkerchief  over an open book on the small table at her elbow when she rose to shake hands.  He mechanically wondered at the trivial action, and learned its significance  later.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  very kind of you to come, Lionel,&rdquo; said the Duchess, pressing his hand  cordially. &ldquo;I know how busy you are with your parishioners.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are one of them,&rdquo; smiled the clergyman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  odd moments, certainly; but we globe-trot for our places of worship nowadays.  Sit down&rdquo;; she indicated a convenient chair opposite her own. &ldquo;Now tell me the  news of your small world. Is Joan quite well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  not be better, considering the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so glad; when do you expect the happy event?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a month, please God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  looked pensively into the fire. &ldquo;I hope it will be a boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be more than content with a girl. Why a boy particularly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not, when an heir is so important? You succeed Jim, and a new Marquis of Frith&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Duchess, you and the Duke are young. There is little chance of my  succeeding. I may be congratulating you some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  cried Leah, almost fiercely; &ldquo;such a thing can never be, thank God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  stared. &ldquo;Why &lsquo;thank God&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I  hardly know; of course, I should hate to be pestered with children. The nursery  is an obsolete institution here, and will remain so, unless&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;unless  Jim marries again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Duchess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not Leah?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it will please you. But why talk of Jim&rsquo;s marrying again, when you are in the  best of health and spirits?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shrugged indifferently. &ldquo;One never knows, I might go first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sincerely trust not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  that imply that you wish me to be a real widow, after posing as a sham one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not; but you talk so strangely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so honestly. Remember, I have always paid you the compliment of being plain  even to rudeness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  tried to read her face, but in vain, and could not arrive at the meaning of her  apparently aimless conversation. The slanting rays of sunset made a radiant  glory round her as she half sat, half reclined in the chair, and her beauty  could bear even that merciless test. Youth, health, money, charm, loveliness&mdash;with  these desirable blessings at her command, what else could she want?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not quite understand,&rdquo; said the perplexed man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Understand  what?&rdquo; she asked absently; then became more alive to his question. &ldquo;Oh, my  chatter. You will, before we part. I am no sphinx to propose riddles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  woman is a sphinx.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  a secret; that is why you men find us so difficult to comprehend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  confess to the difficulty at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a complex mind I must have! Yet I am a very ordinary butterfly of fashion;  something with wings, at all events, though not entirely an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  visitor laughed. &ldquo;Am I to pay you a compliment, or rebuke you for frivolity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can do both or either; the sweet first will counterbalance the bitter last. But  I sicken of compliments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  when genuine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  never are. Men say things they don&rsquo;t mean to women out of traditional reverence  for the exploded idea of the weaker vessel. When you meet a child your first  thought is to give it sweets; when you talk with us the same thought is  translated into polite lies. And we never believe you&mdash;never,&rdquo; Leah assured him.  &ldquo;Plain or beautiful, vain or humble, we price the words directly. In no case  have I found them to be of value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make us out to be fools.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  must be truthful at times. Of course, I always except you, Lionel, as you are  more man than parson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cannot  I be both?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, when miracles occur. Lately I heard of a parson who laboured solitary and  freezing amongst the snows of Labrador for a poor eighty pounds a year. He was  emphatically a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a parson,&rdquo; supplemented the vicar; &ldquo;so, you see, miracles do occur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  warm colour crept into Leah&rsquo;s cheeks, and she looked piercingly at her  companion. &ldquo;Do they? Nowadays, I mean. I am not using a mere phrase, believe  me. Honestly now, could those Gospel miracles occur in this twentieth century?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  mused, and considered a careful reply. &ldquo;Our Master was given the Spirit without  measure as a man because He was the Son of the Most High; by that wisdom did He  work His marvels. But the Apostles, in His power, also prevailed over the  apparently natural, showing signs and wonders to the glory of the Risen Lord  and His Father. &lsquo;With faith ye can do all things,&rsquo; said the blessed Jesus  Himself. Yes, Leah, I reverently believe that with purity, faith, and a humble  trust in the Father by the merits of the Son, and by the power of the Holy  Ghost, miracles could take place to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.</p>
  <p>The  vicar, sighing, dropped into the high-pitched sing-song of the pulpit. &ldquo;A  faithless and perverse generation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  scientific generation, you mean. I don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;I can&rsquo;t believe&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t  believe. Prove the power of your Master. You have faith; you are good; you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! You go too fast. I assuredly try to be good, but I am sadly wanting in many  ways. I have faith, but how weak, how faltering. Who am I, to claim that the  Lord should select me to reveal His strength unto men? I can work no miracle,  Leah. Would to God that I could, if only to convince you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  to God that you could!&rdquo; she echoed with something like a groan, and the faint  flush disappeared, like the dying out of a hope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you, a sceptic, ask about these things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah,  possessed by the spirit of the perverse, laughed maliciously. &ldquo;Jim is trying to  be good; why should not I try also, since a wife is bound to follow her  husband, according to St. Paul, who by the way was a bachelor? But,&rdquo; her mood  shifted, &ldquo;Jim has a tin-pot sort of faith which is better than nothing. I have  not, and so, like your unbelieving Jews, require a sign.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  became professionally interested, descrying intimations of a changed heart. &ldquo;I  believe that you will yet find the Kingdom,&rdquo; he said hopefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you make any such mistake,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I have not yet set out to find it,  and never will, unless I see some of those wonders about which you talk so  glibly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  believe me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, though not to the extent of Bible magic. You hypnotise yourself into  crediting the impossible. I wish you could hypnotise me. Oh, I wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;I  wish!&rdquo; she ended passionately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faith  is not hypnotism,&rdquo; argued Lionel; the word grated on his ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is&mdash;it is&mdash;it is!&rdquo; Leah was vehement in her denial. &ldquo;Science can explain  everything. Why do you come here to prate of miracles, when you know in your  own heart that such things never were and never can be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were and they can be and they will be, while Christ reigneth,&rdquo; asserted the  vicar, firmly; &ldquo;nothing is impossible to God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  call upon Him, and work your marvel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not worthy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not able, rather,&rdquo; and she taunted him as did Elijah the priests of Baal,  their god.</p>
  <p>Kaimes  wondered at her restless moods, and wondered still more when she abruptly left  the serious subject they were discussing&mdash;and on her own initiative&mdash;to talk most  frivolously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard you preach,&rdquo; went on this weathercock, &ldquo;and I am no more to be  persuaded than was Agrippa. You and your shadows&rdquo;&mdash;she whiffed these away. &ldquo;Pouf!  Let us talk of real things&rdquo;; and a toss of her head dismissed the spiritual for  the purely temporal. &ldquo;I had such a ripping time this season,&rdquo; rattled on the  nature set upon pomps and vanities.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah,  Leah! How can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Change  so rapidly? Oh, my good man, I am a twirl-ma-gee woman, ever seeking variety.  Religious conversation is neither amusing nor convincing. It&rsquo;s much more fun to  talk of one&rsquo;s friends and abuse their failings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  decline to join in,&rdquo; said Lionel, dryly, and feeling nonplussed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you have no sense of humour. What a dull time of it Joan must have, poor child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  does not complain,&rdquo; he objected stiffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord, what is the use of complaining! I never whimper about Jim, though his  goodness is even duller than his badness. &lsquo;I have tried George drunk, I have  tried George sober&rsquo;&ldquo;&mdash;she was quoting an epigram of Charles II.&mdash;&ldquo; &lsquo;and there is  nothing in George.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are unnecessarily personal,&rdquo; rebuked Kaimes, annoyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right. Tramp on your little corns and you howl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  intimated that he desired to leave. &ldquo;My time is valuable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know you are a millionaire of seconds and hours. How disagreeable you are,  when I want to be amused!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have just informed me that I am dull,&rdquo; he reminded her pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you are; all honest men are dull. Why, I don&rsquo;t know, unless it is that honesty  and wit match as ill as beauty and brains. Now don&rsquo;t look at your watch again.  I have something to tell you that will make your clerical hair stand on end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  could one do with such a whirlwind woman? The vicar replaced his watch and  shrugged resignedly. She was what she had always been, freakish and uncertain;  but on this occasion more so than usual. An April lady, whimsical and  irresponsible, decidedly rude, and aggravatingly amusing. But Kaimes  instinctively felt that at the back of these volleying drifts of smalltalk  lurked something serious, which she feared to handle. Hoping that in time it  might be manifested to his intelligence, he waited patiently, while Leah  scrambled on verbosely in her gabble of nothings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  need a London month to pull you together. Dull country, dull man; dull man,  awful bore. Get a parish in the West End; you&rsquo;ll have howling larks converting  Dives and Jezebel of the drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not look upon conversion as a lark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, especially with Jim. Oh, Lord, to think that he of all people should turn  goody-goody. You are pleased, of course; the sight of the lost black sheep  trotting home to fodder to the fold is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really cannot listen to this talk,&rdquo; said Lionel, rising quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you can. I&rsquo;ll shock you more before I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kaimes  resumed his seat blankly. &ldquo;But your reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  jumped up as her visitor sat down, and addressed nothing in particular.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  asks for reason, and from a woman,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;So like that lame Lord  Esbrook; he always asks what he should not and what he is never likely to get.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reason  from women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  from men, who have still less to spare. But that&rsquo;s his way. Have you met Lord  Esbrook? Such a funny walk as he has. Dot and carry one&mdash;wooden leg, you know;  dot and carry one&mdash;just like this only much worse&rdquo;; and Leah limped the length  of the room, mimicking an extraordinary gait so cleverly that Lionel laughed  openly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Though  you shouldn&rsquo;t mock at people&rsquo;s infirmities,&rdquo; he coughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? Esbrook&rsquo;s a holy show, and with the spite of the cripple, he spares no one&rsquo;s  feelings. He&rsquo;s the cracked black pot snarling at the kettles he can never hope  to be, with his dot and carry one, dot and carry one&rdquo;; and back she came  swinging and grunting with provoking cleverness.</p>
  <p>In  her gyrations&mdash;it seemed from her imitations that Lord Esbrook gyrated&mdash;she overturned  the table upon which rested the covered book. Leah pounced to pick up the  volume, as did Kaimes, out of courtesy. When he had set the table on its legs  he could scarcely refrain from glancing casually at the book. It&rsquo;s exterior was  familiar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Bible!&rdquo; exclaimed an amazed man.</p>
  <p>Leah  flung herself into the chair, laughing noisily. &ldquo;Oh, what a face!&rdquo; she mocked,  pointing a jeering finger. &ldquo;Look at yourself, do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were&mdash;you&mdash;reading  the Bible?&rdquo; asked the vicar, too astonished to note the poor attempt she made  to force humour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; said she, defiantly, but with flushes and quick breaths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  only mock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  opportunity is so alluring,&rdquo; was her reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s such an awful lot of rot  in that history of the Jews. And hundreds of impossibilities. Here!&rdquo; She seized  the Bible and rapidly swept the pages. &ldquo;What was I reading when you entered?&rdquo;  The thin leaves flew and flickered beneath her fingers. &ldquo;Oh yes! Something  quite too absurd in Matthew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;St.  Matthew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mister  St. Matthew, if you will. There&rdquo;; she presented the book; &ldquo;you read so  beautifully&mdash;really you do, without flattery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not read for you to mock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  face flashed into crude anger. &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; she commanded harshly.</p>
  <p>The  vicar would have declined again, but that his eye fell on the verses she had  indicated. A memory of their earlier conversation, coupled with her unnecessary  vehemence, made him obey without further hesitation. It might be that here was  the key to the problem of her jerky speech. His mellow voice rose like the  music of a solemn bell, and the glorious words rolled majestically through the  room.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;When  He was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. And, behold,  there came a leper and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst  make me clean. And Jesus put forth His hand, and touched him, saying, I will;  be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  immediately his leprosy was cleansed,&rdquo; breathed the Duchess, gripping the arms  of her chair to lean forward. &ldquo;Why not &lsquo;her&rsquo; leprosy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  laid down the sacred volume. &ldquo;It was a man who came to ask mercy of our Lord,&rdquo;  said he, obtusely.</p>
  <p>Leah  threw herself back in the chair with the pettish cry of a misunderstood child. &ldquo;Oh,  you fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something  in her voice startled him; yet he was far from gathering her meaning. &ldquo;What is  it?&rdquo; he demanded, entirely bewildered.</p>
  <p>There  was no light in her eyes now; from luminous sapphires they had become pebbles,  dull orbs of lapis-lazuli. When she spoke her voice creaked and wheezed &ldquo;If  your Master lived to-day, I would go to Palestine!&rdquo; she said, looking very  directly at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  on earth for?&rdquo; he asked blankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you not understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  look was that of Medusa, and flickering lights came and went in her  half-lifeless eyes. Their glare, rather than the toneless notes of her voice,  made him faintly understand. The chosen passage out of St. Matthew, taken in  conjunction with her earlier chatter of miracles, and her late reference to  Palestine, engendered in his brain a horrible, a terrible, an impossible  thought. And yet&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you talking about?&rdquo; he asked harshly.</p>
  <p>The  cry of a soul on fire broke on his ears. &ldquo;You brute, when I suffer so! Does it  need words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  what need words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  dashed her hand on the open page of the Bible. &ldquo;This&mdash;this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Augh!&rdquo;  He rose and sat down, with cold hands and a white face. The meaning of what she  meant crashed like the blow of a bludgeon, and his brain spun to the shock &ldquo;Leah!&rdquo;  he heard himself say, in a far-away voice like a telephone whisper. Then he  stopped to stare at the quiet woman who sat upright, with rigid features and  tightly clasped hands. &ldquo;Leah,&rdquo; he muttered again, and some indefinable feeling  made his hair crisp at the roots.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  That was all she said, and her lips hardly moved in the saying.</p>
  <p>Kaimes  looked aimlessly round the room, and noted the pattern of the window-curtains.  Only the whistling of the coals, spouting smoke and jetting flame, broke the  stillness. His eyes returned to her face, fair and stainless. &ldquo;Impos&mdash;s&mdash;sible!&rdquo;  he jerked, his voice entirely beyond control. &ldquo;Im&mdash;&rdquo; then his nerves vibrated  and his skin crept.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  doctors in London, five doctors abroad, assured me that it is not impossible&mdash;unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were like two pale ghosts sitting in the shadows. Said one ghost to the other: &ldquo;But  have you&mdash;are you a&mdash;?&rdquo; His tongue refused to form either terrible word.</p>
  <p>Leah  unexpectedly flung up her arms with a scream, then brought two shaking hands  across her mouth to stifle that wild note of human pain. Right and left, up and  down, did she look, as though to be certain that no one was within earshot but  the vicar. &ldquo;It will never do to let the servants hear,&rdquo; said the rapid action.  Lionel&rsquo;s benumbed brain could not yet take in wholly the appalling truth&mdash;if  truth it was. The leper dropped her hands and looked at him heavily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lying devil,&rdquo; said Leah, slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?  what? what?&rdquo; babbled Kaimes, incoherently.</p>
  <p>She  groaned and rocked with hands palm to palm between her knee. &ldquo;I will, be thou  clean; I will, be thou clean.&rdquo; Over and over again did she moan the words, till  they bored into the listener&rsquo;s brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  have mercy!&rdquo; murmured the man, trying to be a man. The creeping paralysis of  the horror almost struck him dumb. But he managed by a violent effort to wet  his lips with a stiff tongue, and made it form certain words: &ldquo;Are you sure of  this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  doctors,&rdquo; went on the Duchess, rocking and droning as Demetrius did aforetime&mdash;&ldquo;three  doctors, five doctors, eight doctors in all. They said the same thing&mdash;ugh!&mdash;such  a beastly thing! It was the truth, though. Doctors never lie like parsons. And  that Book with its falsehoods&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo; She lunged forward without rising, and  grabbing the Bible pitched it into the fire. Lionel snatched it from the  flames; Leah struck it from his hands; and then ensued a silent struggle,  uncanny, savage, in which some leaves were torn. All at once she relaxed her  grip and lay back crying quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, a shame!&rdquo; she wept softly; &ldquo;just  when everything was going on so well. And it can&rsquo;t be cured; all the money in  the world can&rsquo;t cure me. I must die&mdash;in bits&rdquo;; her voice soared shrilly, and she  crouched, as though being beaten. &ldquo;Ugh! That kiss, that beastly kiss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah,  how did you get this disease?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman took no notice, but sprang up, as though moved by springs, flinging wide  her arms, and looking upward in wild rebellion. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t die&mdash;I won&rsquo;t. I refuse  to give in&mdash;I refuse&rdquo;; she tore up and down the room, speaking in angry  undertones, as one always mindful of possible listeners. &ldquo;I have always had my  own way!&rdquo; was her whispered argument&mdash;&ldquo;always&mdash;always; why can&rsquo;t I have it now?  There can be nothing up there; no, no&mdash;there can&rsquo;t be. If He does exist He would  not have let me go so long on my own. I am strong&mdash;I have never met any one  stronger. I must win&mdash;I have always won. I will win!&rdquo; her voice rose  tyrannically. &ldquo;I am myself; who can be stronger than myself? And yet this thing&rdquo;&mdash;a  strong shudder shook her into weakness&mdash;&ldquo;this vile&mdash;vile&mdash; Ugh! ugh! I believe  there must be Something. Can you tell me, you&mdash;you who assume to know the  secrets of the stars?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  lurched forward in a frenzy of deadly fear, cannoned against Lionel, and  dragged him down into his chair, clasping his knees, and knocking her forehead  against them. &ldquo;Where is your Master?&rdquo; she whimpered. &ldquo;Tell Him I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;really  I am sorry. He may cure me then, as He cured that man long ago. Gentle Jesus&mdash;the  children call Him so; He can&rsquo;t be cruel to me&mdash;to me. He can&rsquo;t be cruel to any  one, so they say&mdash;ah, they say, they say; but how do I know? It&rsquo;s not true, it  isn&rsquo;t true, and yet if it was&mdash;if it&mdash; Lionel&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off with the squall of  a terrified child, hiding her eyes pitifully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be good&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be good, if  only&mdash;only He will do this! It&rsquo;s a little thing&mdash;oh, a very little thing. And you  said that He could&mdash;that He, your Master, I mean. Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; With sobbing  breath she unwound her arms and fell back beating the carpet with open palms.  Murmurings went rhythmically with the padding sound. &ldquo;I want to be clean; I  want to be clean; I want to be clean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kaimes  tried to lift her. &ldquo;Let me summon help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a bound she was on her feet, pushing him back. &ldquo;Do that and I kill you,&rdquo; she  panted, clenching her hands and facing him furiously. &ldquo;No one knows but these  doctors&mdash;yes, and Katinka, and that fiend Demetrius. Strange also. If I had  Strange here&rdquo;&mdash; she hammered with closed fists on the vicar&rsquo;s shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;I would  cut him into bits; I would blind him somehow; I would&mdash;I would&mdash;oh, what would I  not do? Why couldn&rsquo;t he leave that infected beast to die in Siberia? Oh, the&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;  She poured forth a torrent of words, which made the listener grow hot and cold  with shame. Then again she collapsed as the chill of a deadly fear struck at  her heart. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to die&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to die!&rdquo; and against the wall she  rocked with arms held crosswise over her eyes, swinging, ever swinging.</p>
  <p>The  scene was like a nightmare; but by this time Lionel had the grip of his  emotions. &ldquo;Leah,&rdquo; he said firmly, and advancing close to the writhing creature,  &ldquo;you must tell your husband; you must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Out  came her arms with a circular swing, and struck him fair across the eyes. &ldquo;Jim  doesn&rsquo;t know; Jim must never know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was almost blinded, but persisted. &ldquo;Leah, something must be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  voice sank, and with it her rage. &ldquo;Something must be done,&rdquo; said she, faintly&mdash;&ldquo;something  shall be done, and&mdash;soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, half under his breath, and half catching at her  intention.</p>
  <p>She  took no notice. &ldquo;Sit down, please!&rdquo; said Leah, quietly, and Kaimes obeyed,  since to summon assistance would only be to precipitate a still more dreadful  scene. The Duchess looked into the mirror and arranged her hair; also she  dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief, and smoothed her wrist-cuffs. When she did  speak it was in the smooth voice of a society hostess asking a visitor if he  took sugar in his tea. &ldquo;I have made a fool of myself, Lionel. But you must  admit that I am rather severely tried just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you poor soul!&rdquo; His tone and look were pitiful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reserve  your sympathy till you hear what I have to say. But first tell me honestly, can  Christ cure me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;if  it is His Will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let Him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have Faith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faith  in what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  His power and Will to heal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I believe, when I do not believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  died for you on the Cross.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not. That was purely a political matter because the Jews feared the Romans.  I have read Strauss; I have read Renan; the four Gospels also: you can&rsquo;t puzzle  me. He was a good man, a very good man&mdash;quite a saint, if you will. But&mdash;the Son  of God?&rdquo; She shook her head with a hard frown of disbelief.</p>
  <p>Lionel  was at his wit&rsquo;s end. &ldquo;Then you cannot be cured?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;;  she looked at him steadily, an awful smile curving the corners of her mouth. &ldquo;I  thought you would fail me at the last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how can I&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t, so there&rsquo;s no more to be said.&rdquo; She sat down with a little sigh. &ldquo;Dear  me, how very hot this room is! Would you mind opening the window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kaimes  did not move. &ldquo;Leah, go to bed, and let me send for one of those doctors you  consulted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Useless!  useless!&rdquo; She waved him aside calmly. &ldquo;They have spoken. I know the worst; I am  prepared to face the worst. Are you? Hold your tongue,&rdquo; she added peremptorily,  as he opened his mouth. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From  beginning to end did she relate the whole fraud&mdash;the sham death, the stolen  money, the betrayal, and the punishment of the kiss. Her voice was perfectly  calm, her posture easy, and her self-control admirable. The listener grew white  and red, became nervous and angry, quivered with disgust, recoiled with  loathing, as she unfolded the brutal tale of her sin and treachery. Leah spared  him no detail, however painful; she even made herself out to be worse than she  really was&mdash;if that were possible. From the buying of Demetrius by that  butterfly kiss in the picture-gallery, to the revenge of Demetrius in that  stuffy cabin, when she struggled in the arms of one who had been what she now  was, she related the whole without a blush, without a tremor, in a quiet, level  voice, unmoved, and utterly shameless. The horror of her position seemed to  remove her from the region of human emotions and morals. It was the unveiling  of original evil.</p>
  <p>Lionel  did not interrupt, but closed his eyes with a sick feeling as she drew to the  end.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  first noticed that something was wrong when my hands burned as I washed them. I  thought nothing of it at the time; but the feeling became so painful that I saw  my doctor. He said&mdash;well, you can guess what he said. I consulted another, and  another: the same diagnosis. I went abroad, but the doctors in Germany and  France told me the same thing. I knew it was true. I felt in my heart it was  true. Ugh!&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;There is no cure&mdash;none, none.&rdquo; Then she finished, with  a nervous titter, &ldquo;Pleasant for me, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  gasped the vicar, leaning his head on his hand, and much too qualmish to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you needn&rsquo;t look like that. I have to suffer, not you. I kept wondering how I  got the beastly thing, and although I fancied it might be that kiss, I could  not be quite sure. Katinka enlightened me&mdash;she was always a good-natured girl.  After the death of that little reptile, she returned to England and watched me.  Seeing that I went to doctors&mdash;she must have watched very closely&mdash;and then  abroad, she wrote a letter&mdash;such a nasty, spiteful letter. But I always thought  Katinka was a cat. Would you like to&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; I have heard enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you call yourself a man&mdash;pooh! You must hear. I learned from the letter that  Demetrius contracted the&mdash;the&mdash;well, what he suffered from, amongst the natives  of Kamchatka. He intended first to show me up; but when that horrid girl told  him how she had hurt my mouth, he knew that by a kiss he could&mdash;ahr-r-r! He was  a doctor, you see, and the skin being broken, it was easy for him, knowing what  he did, to do what he wanted&mdash;the brute! That was why he kissed so hard, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop!  stop!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is beastly, isn&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s all, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was examining her finger-nails when next Lionel stole a glance at her. He  scarcely knew what to say. Her treachery and the result of her treachery were  both abominable. That a beautiful woman, gently born and bred, should sin so  vilely seemed incredible. For beautiful she was, sitting there calmly under the  uplifted sword of Azrael, the Angel of Death; and vile she confessed herself to  be. Yet he could hardly accept either the physical degradation or the moral  turpitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be mistaken, after all,&rdquo; he stammered vaguely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I am not an object,&rdquo; she replied, with a shrug. &ldquo;How like a child you are to  require proof! I don&rsquo;t intend to become an object, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if there is no cure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is another way. Of course, it is disagreeable, but what is one to do in such  straits?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  vicar guessed her meaning, and violently threw off the weakness with which her  story had infected his manhood. &ldquo;I forbid you to heap crime upon crime,&rdquo; said  he, firmly and insistently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall do what I like. Do not dictate to me, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  God&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe in God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do; you must. Does not this shameful punishment which has overtaken you in the  hour of triumph declare the anger of a great and terrible God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Her expression was mulish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Woman!  woman! Kneel and ask for mercy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t ask for mercy when I&rsquo;m being treated so badly. Never! never! Just when  things were going so smoothly, too; the money coming in by the bushel, and Demetrius  out of the way. I call it a shame; it&rsquo;s mean, spiteful, cruel. I intended to  have such a jolly time, and now&mdash;now&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice faltered and broke.</p>
  <p>She  swung with a groan to one side of the chair, hiding her face and breathing  heavily. That deadly fear of the inevitable would grip her, do what she would.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leah&rdquo;&mdash;Kaimes&rsquo;  voice shook a trifle&mdash;&ldquo;God is very good to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eyes stared at him bleakly. &ldquo;Very good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are put into this world, not for the pampering of the flesh, but that we may  learn through trouble how to become more spiritual. Our souls are of God, and  to God they must return, rising through much tribulation to His necessary  perfection. Sorrows are sent for the flesh to bear; not as punishments, but as  lessons to be learned. Of our vices, says St. Augustine, we can frame a ladder  to ascend heavenward, if we but tread them beneath our feet. This you have  never known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I do not know it now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  your dreadful trouble will come the knowledge; in this way alone can humility  come. God, out of loving pity for your unbending pride, which prevents the Holy  Spirit from entering your heart, has beaten you to your knees. On your knees,  then, ask for mercy, for light, for purification of your unclean soul. God&rsquo;s  staff, which He gives to all in life&rsquo;s pilgrimage, has changed into a rod. He  gave you all things, and you used His gifts to glorify the flesh. Now in His  infinite love has He sent trouble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  brought that upon myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  your amendment it was permitted that you should do so. Out of your pleasant  vices have you made whips to lash yourself. The wages of sin is death; you have  sinned, and the wages&mdash;oh, Leah, Leah, bitterly cruel as it may seem to you, I  rejoice that the wages should be so paid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a Job&rsquo;s comforter, I must say,&rdquo; said the Duchess, sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I can see how this tribulation of the flesh can save your soul alive. God might  have struck you dead in your wickedness, and with justice, for your wilful sin.  Instead of doing so, He has given you a lingering disease, that you should be  brought to acknowledge His power and also have time to repent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is nothing to repent of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shame!  shame! Even from a worldly point of view you have sinned grossly; how much  blacker, then, are your deeds in God&rsquo;s sight! But they can be made white; the  past can be wiped out by sincere sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  twisted her hands above her head with a cry of impotent rage. &ldquo;How can I  repent, when I do not even feel sorry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not ask Christ to help you. Repentance is a gift, as is Faith. He will  give both, and His undying Love, if you will but confess your sin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have done so&mdash;to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  am powerless. Confess it to Christ; weep as did Mary at His wounded feet. Hard  as is your heart, He will melt it; soiled as is your soul, He will cleanse it.  Now&mdash;now, when human aid is vain, now is the appointed time. Repent and be  saved!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I try to, will He&mdash;will He cure me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  question I cannot, dare not answer. His mercy is infinite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say that to me, knowing what I suffer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say it to you who suffer. In no other way could the Spirit have brought you to  the mercy-seat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has not brought me now,&rdquo; she persisted obstinately.</p>
  <p>Lionel  fell on his knees and caught her restless hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  your poor, sinful soul, for which Christ died!&rdquo; he cried passionately; &ldquo;to whom  can you go but to God? Doctors cannot cure you; He can, if it be His will. He  may even make your flesh clean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  And that question you declined to answer a minute or two back. Besides, you  denied that miracles could take place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not. No one ever came in vain to our Blessed Lord, when He walked the earth  some two thousand years ago. As was His power then, so is it now. He loved in  those days, He loves now. Sitting on God&rsquo;s right hand, He is ready to succour  the vilest. His arm is not shortened, His pity is not exhausted. In mercy He  may even cure you of this dreadful disease, as He cured the afflicted man we  read of. Only acknowledge that God is mightier than you are; only bow to the  rod, only admit your sin, only cry for pardon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  He will cure me&mdash;&rdquo; she began, wavering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you must leave to His love and wisdom. Cure you He may; permit you to suffer,  He may see fit. But save your soul, He can. That much I can swear to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want this horrible thing cured,&rdquo; she cried passionately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  continue in your sins? To soil your soul anew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no! If I repent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Repentance  includes submission. God may not see fit to cure you; it may be your punishment&mdash;and  I think it is&mdash;to bear this woeful cross, which if rightly borne may lead you to  the light of lights. The flesh! The flesh! You but think of the flesh, of the  passing world, of the vanities of life, of the enjoyment of the senses. From  these things God would lead you away to contemplate spiritual realities, and  the appointed path has been made known. Bear your cross&mdash;oh, my dear, bear your  cross, and endure to the end that you may be saved. Terrible as it may seem,  this evil, whence good will arise, has removed you from temptation. If you live  secluded&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dying  piecemeal,&rdquo; she cried, in a frenzy of anger, and wrenched away her hands. &ldquo;No,  no; I will not live. I will die&mdash;die. At least I can do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  did Judas! Leah, if you cannot bear your punishment in the flesh, how will you  endure it in the spirit? Live for Christ, and what matters the world?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything!  everything! I know what I am; I do not know what I may be. Here&mdash;in this  tangible world&mdash;we are safe&mdash;safe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  God? Can you say that, when His hand has struck you down? I tell you, poor  sinner, that thus does He show His mercy. As is your crime, so must be your  punishment. But Christ can pardon your iniquities, and Christ will, if you only  plead for mercy and for grace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  rose, crimson with rage. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll drive me mad. I don&rsquo;t want your spiritual  life, your next world of shadows and moonshine. Give me life&mdash;life&mdash;life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  cry of the flesh was so insistent, so futile, so blind in its desire, that  Lionel shuddered. Still on his knees, he began a fervent prayer. The miserable  woman walked rebelliously up and down the room, fighting against the conviction  now slowly being driven home to her understanding, that He whom she had mocked  and defied was indeed the Most High God. But she still fought against a  submission she knew well would have to be made. Beg for mercy she would not:  her heart could not feel, her intelligence could not grasp. But, somehow, she  knew. A dreadful thing had reduced her to impotence, and the ego could not  battle against the Something it had hitherto flouted, but now furiously  admitted might exist.</p>
  <p>There  remained but one thing to do, but one dark way to take. Do it and take it she  would. But Lionel more than suspected her intention. Lionel would thwart her,  and she would be compelled to live&mdash;live on, an object of disgust and pity. &ldquo;No!  no!&rdquo; was her inward cry, as the imploring voice of the vicar rose and fell, and  died away in a last tremulous Amen. For the last time, therefore, did she set  her wits to plot for the ego.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lionel,&rdquo;  said she, hesitatingly, &ldquo;will you send for Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  vicar&rsquo;s face lighted up. He saw in this request what she meant him to see, a  sign of yielding. &ldquo;You will let me tell him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leah  nodded. &ldquo;There is a doctor in Vienna,&rdquo; she whispered, inventing recklessly with  the cunning of one driven to bay; &ldquo;he has found out a cure, I hear. If Jim will  take me over&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  telegraph to Hengist Castle at once,&rdquo; cried Kaimes, making for the door  impetuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  come back to dinner,&rdquo; said she, following, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pass the evening alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you won&rsquo;t frighten me any more with this religious talk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lionel  pressed her hand sadly. &ldquo;I have done what I could, Leah. Only the Holy Spirit  can bring home conviction to your heart. Try and pray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  assented the Duchess, submissively; &ldquo;it is all that is left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the better part, which cannot be taken away, is left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went away quite deceived, since she had suggested the Viennese physician so  calmly. He thought that she still hoped desperately, and for all he knew the  hope might be fulfilled, seeing the present-day resources of science. Certainly  he never dreamed how she had hoodwinked him, and so sped on his errand of  mercy, leaving behind him a woman too broken to exult in the success of her  final piece of trickery.</p>
  <p>It  was all over. Man could do nothing; God would do nothing. As Demetrius had been  smitten for the crime she had induced him to commit, so was she being punished  for the evil she had called into being. Lionel had talked nonsense, of course;  but he left behind him a feeling in her mind that the God he worshipped did  exist. How the belief had come into her heart, she could not say; but it was  certainly there. Try as she might, with all the strength of her brilliant  intellect, she knew that never again could she be an atheist. God existed to  her comprehension at last. But the newly-conceived Deity was not the Father of  love and light. Rather did He appear an omnipotent tyrant, who had driven her  to bad courses by giving her tastes she was unable to satisfy, and who now  punished her for acting as the nature He had given her dictated. She was like a  mouse in the claws of a cat, and could no more escape than could the tormented  little beast. Only to the height of acknowledging that Something much stronger  than herself existed could she rise; and her submission was as that of Caliban to  Prospero. Wrenched violently from the egotistic wrappings of her soul, she&mdash;the  true self, the immortal spirit&mdash;stood naked and shamed, yet defiant. She  submitted, because only submission was left. But all her flesh shouted  furiously against its victor.</p>
  <p>Then,  again, as the tormented soul strove to overcome the lower material self, did  she recall Lionel&rsquo;s words. God was love, he declared, and in love had God  broken her shield of self, snapped her sword of desire. Certainly, now that  this world could do nothing for her, she would be forced to seek the other.  There she might learn how to rise from darkness into light. That the spiritual  existed she was now reluctantly convinced; that a study of its meaning would  bring her peace she could not be certain. Of course, it was early days yet. She  had gained a great step by the admission that God reigned, even though He had  proved it to her so cruelly. It might be that by endless striving she would  learn something of His love before Death ended her intolerable sufferings. God  ordered her to fly; was it worth while to trust to Him for wings?</p>
  <p>The  struggle of the soul wavering between hell and heaven might have ended in the  victory of the latter, and Leah might have consented with bitter tears to bear  the cross laid upon her shrinking shoulders. But while wearily pacing the room  a chance glance showed her in the mirror that beauty of which she had been, and  was, so proud. Leaning her arms on the mantelpiece, she examined every detail  lovingly and long. Could she bear to see that gradually disappear? Could she  accept life as a Thing and not as a Being? Those blue eyes would grow dull and  animal; that glorious hair would drop off; that complexion of cream and roses  would&mdash;would&mdash; Ugh! ugh!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no! no!&rdquo; The rebellious cry of the flesh ascended to the stars. &ldquo;It must never  be&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  that she knew herself to be revolted against the slow wasting agony that would  most surely come, to reduce that splendour of her beautiful body to the dust,  dishonoured and shamed. To save herself from such infamy it but needed an  overdose of chloral. Then in the pride of her loveliness she would pass away  painlessly, without disfigurement, triumphant in a minor degree, at least. With  all the indomitable strength of a will that had been only thwarted by Him who  had created that will, did she resolve to snatch this one poor laurel-leaf from  the Almighty Victor. Turning from the mirror, she felt that her mind was  steeled, that Self was not entirely defeated. After all, her unconquerable will  would win.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo;  she whispered to her shivering soul, &ldquo;when I go to bed. An overdose of chloral,  and then, when I awaken&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, with the chills of death at her heart. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  was her despairing admission; &ldquo;You are the stronger!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the cry of the flesh making sullen submission. In vain did the soul  piteously beg that its tabernacle might yet hold it a little while, for the  purging of its sin. The flesh would not hear. Beaten, conquered, shamed,  tormented, its petty triumph could yet be obtained in this hour of defeat. And  the terrified soul, sobbing unheeded, waited for the rapidly approaching hour  which would send it forth disembodied&mdash;whither?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_35"></a>Chapter 35</b> </h2>
  <p>&ldquo;We  regret to announce to our readers the unexpected demise of the Duchess of  Pentland at Firmingham, Essex. According to the Rev. Lionel Kaimes, who dined  with her Grace on the evening of her death, she was in the very best of health  and spirits. The unfortunate lady retired at a comparatively early hour, and  was found dead in the morning by her maid. A brief examination proved that  death was due to an overdose of chloral, which her Grace was in the habit of  taking when suffering from sleeplessness. The Duke of Pentland, who was  expected at Firmingham, arrived shortly after the painful discovery, to be  greeted by the disastrous intelligence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  loss of this highly popular lady will be greatly felt in high circles. Her  beauty and wit were exceptional, and only to be surpassed by her truly kind  heart. It may be well said that she lived to make others happy. To the  unfortunate her purse was always open, and to the afflicted her soothing  presence was a welcome relief. Again and again did she sacrifice herself in the  cause of charity; and in many ways unknown to the public did she do good by  stealth. Her graceful presence will be much missed at various great functions  during the coming winter season; but it is the poor and needy who will most  keenly feel the loss of one whose large heart was ever ready to aid them in  trouble.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  commiseration is expressed for the Duke of Pentland, who was most tenderly  attached to his beautiful consort. A brilliant star has disappeared from the  social firmament; but what is more lamentable, a noble, religious, charitable  lady has gone, leaving a place which can never be filled. The funeral, which  will take place at Firmingham next Tuesday, will doubtless be largely attended  by those who loved her and knew her worth. The world can ill spare such a one,  who illustrated in her conduct and qualities the highest attributes of womanhood.  She was a great lady, a true, tender woman, a sincere friend, and a model wife.  What words could better befit her untimely grave than that eulogy on Dorcas set  forth in the Acts: &lsquo;This woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she  did&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
