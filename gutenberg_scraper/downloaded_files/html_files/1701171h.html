<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">I. &mdash; THE PURSUIT OF
SIXPENCE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE first beams of the morning sun wandered
across the Esplanade and, penetrating a leafy screen, fell upon
the closed eyelids of Mr. Peter Pell. That gentleman opened one
eye slowly and then closed it quickly, but the sun was not to be
denied and, at last, it dawned upon the awakening senses of Mr.
Pell that it was time to be up and about.</p>

<p>It was not the first time that the exigencies of modern
civilisation had forced Mr. Pell to seek an airy couch on the
playground of the Perthites. By choice he was sybaritic, by
necessity ascetic, but yesterday evening it was a choice between
supper and bed and the vanities of the table proved superior to
the claims of bodily repose.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell, rising from his hard couch, showed what ladies of a
certain age and standing call "a fine figure of a man." He was
largely made with even a slight tendency to stoutness. His head
was somewhat small and set on his head at an angle that gave him,
when excited, a certain air of ferocity. His hair was thin,
although covering nearly all the top of his head.</p>

<p>His voice, his principal asset, was heavy and boomed like the
tenor "C" of the cathedral chimes. For preference he was
clean-shaven, but on this morning his toilet had been neglected
and he showed a two-day growth of beard on chin and lip.</p>

<p>Dispensing with ablutions, Mr. Pell carefully dusted his
clothes and then considered his position. The first, and from
internal reminders, the most pressing necessity was for
breakfast. A search of his pockets revealed, or rather confirmed
the knowledge, that the balance in hand consisted of one penny
and three half pennies.</p>

<p>Balancing each coin on a separate finger Mr. Pell gravely
considered them. Certainly breakfast commensurate with his
requirements was not compassed within the ability of twopence
halfpenny. Some sort of food might be obtained for sixpence, but
even that, sum was not to hand and Mr. Pell's ambition lay in the
direction of a regular thoroughgoing breakfast, beginning with
the usual porridge and continuing through eggs and bacon, chops,
steaks, etceteras, to the grand finale of bread and butter and
marmalade. At the thought of the last item Mr. Pell's tongue
gently inserted itself between his lips for he had a very sweet
tooth. But, however elastic his thoughts, twopence halfpenny was
but too matter of fact.</p>

<p>Somewhere in this gay city of Perth, thought Mr. Pell, there
must be come kind friend from whom the necessary coins of the
realm may be obtained to provide for the realisation of the
Epicurean feast.</p>

<p>Leaving the Esplanade Mr. Pell made his way to Hay Street.
Assuming the air of a moneyed loiterer, he carefully examined the
goods in the shop windows, at the same time keeping a careful eye
open for some acquaintance who might prove financial. The
hurrying crowd of workers and shoppers jostled him, but nowhere
did he see a familiar face.</p>

<p>"Hullo, old chap!" A voice, sounded in his ear and a heavy
hand descended on his shoulder. Mr. Pell swung round with hope
in his heart.</p>

<p>"Just the man I was looking for." The accoster was a thin
nervous looking man with a vacant wandering eye and a ragged
beard. His appearance was unkempt and Mr. Pell could not place
him on his list of acquaintances and friends. But it was evident
from the other's manner that they were acquainted, while Mr.
Pell's memory might be defective, and breakfast loomed as a
possibility.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," retorted Mr. Pell, unctuously. "I am pleased
to see you.&mdash;What&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm in a little difficulty," interrupted the stranger in a
hoarse whisper. "Could you&mdash;would you&mdash;permit yourself
to do me a favour?"</p>

<p>"Well, er&mdash;" commenced Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>The stranger interrupted quickly. "My dear sir, I am sure you
will do your best for me. You know of old how diffident I am of
speaking of intimate, I may say family matters, to an
acquaintance. But you and I are, I should say have been, so
intimate that I feel I may speak to you as a brother. My request
is a small one, so small that you will, I am sure, have no
difficulty in helping me. Can you? Will you? I am sure I have but
to speak and your great heart will immediately respond, lend me
half a crown for a short period. Stay! Do not speak hurriedly The
loan, trifling as it is, will be repaid to you with the utmost
promptitude, and perchance, when circumstances have altered, when
I assume the rightful position to which I am entitled, your
affairs will have my complete and sympathetic support."</p>

<p>Into the thin mist of the early morning vanished Mr. Pell's
hopes of an immediate breakfast. Here was another on the same
expedition as himself. Yet never in his life had Mr. Pell failed
to rise to the occasion and now his tones were urbanity
itself.</p>

<p>"My dear sir! I am most sorry. I am deeply grieved. Owing to
the fact that, very unfortunately, I left home this morning
without my purse I am&mdash;er&mdash;in somewhat similar
straights to yourself. If you will do me the favour of meeting me
after&mdash;er&mdash;my bank opens er&mdash;I shall be pleased to
comply with your request. Until then, <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

<p>With a graceful sweep of his hand Mr. Pell slowly faded down
the street The interruption had only emphasised his need for
refreshment. The morning hours were speeding fast and the
opportunity of obtaining a loan from some business acquaintance
would soon be lost.</p>

<p>Murray and Wellington Streets proved barren hunting grounds
and Mr. Pell turned the corner of Barrack Street, his hopes of a
luxurious breakfast fast dwindling. The Town Hall clock struck
the hour of nine. From the direction of the Terrace came Matt
Horan driving his well-known pacer 'Laughing Bill.' He was
driving at a good speed, but on seeing Mr. Pell quickly pulled
up.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Peter." Now if there was anything that disturbed Mr.
Pell's equanimity, it was to be addressed as 'Peter.' He had a
very serious opinion of his own importance, and for a person of
his commanding figure to be so familiarly addressed showed, in
his opinion, a disregard of the due observances of life. To be
addressed as 'Peter' was sufficient to destroy even a man's
illusion in himself. For these reasons Mr. Pell turned a deaf
ear. But Horan was not to be denied.</p>

<p>"Hey, Peter&mdash;Peter Pell!" Horan was a persistent person
and on second thoughts Mr. Pell thought it wise to answer to the
call. Besides it is not always welcome to have one's name
thundered in the streets for all and sundry to hear.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Horan," said Mr. Pell, advancing to the jog-car
with all the dignity he could assume while breakfastless.</p>

<p>"Come off that 'oss, old pal," retorted Horan. "Got anything
on?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell looked down at his attire. It certainly was not of
the best but, in his opinion, sufficient for decency.</p>

<p>"At the present moment my time is not occupied, if that is
what you mean," replied Mr. Pell with great dignity.</p>

<p>"Jump in, then!" Horan moved up in the seat.</p>

<p>"Into that!" Mr. Pell's voice had a note of anxiety. "I am
afraid, my dear sir, that my&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you ain't as heavy as all that. But please yourself. Got
a job that might suit you if you're on; if you ain't, so long."
Horan made a move to drive off.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Pell saw his breakfast fast escaping him. Leaving
his dignity to be assumed when his bodily needs had been attended
to, he mounted besides his friend in the frail cart.</p>

<p>"It's this way, Peter," commenced Horan, as the pacer moved
suddenly into gait. "I'm at the end of my wits to know what to
do. This 'ere 'orse is great. I'm open to acknowledge that. The
question is, is 'e great enough to win the Christmas Cup. I think
he is."</p>

<p>"He is a very large horse, so far as my judgement can be
relied on," replied Mr. Pell, looking critically at the quadruped
under discussion.</p>

<p>"Oh, get off! What I wants to know is, is he going to pay me
to win the Christmas Trotting Cup."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Horan," replied Mr. Pell with some warmth. "How
should I know? He certainly is a very fine horse so far as I can
judge, but I must acknowledge to a very slight knowledge of
horses, and especially of trotting horses. To some extent
therefore my opinion must be valueless."</p>

<p>"Jest so! If you knew a horse from a cow I wouldn't have
brought you into the game. The question is, are you open for an
offer."</p>

<p>"Of what?" For the moment Mr. Pell was startled.</p>

<p>"To put this 'ere 'orse right in the books."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand you," said Mr. Pell dubiously.</p>

<p>"This 'ere 'orse is the great tip," explained Horan.</p>

<p>"Does he?" asked Mr. Pell, innocently.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Tip."</p>

<p>"Good lor'!" and Mr. Horan looked at his companion with a
certain amount of admiration. "Are you as innercent as all
that?"</p>

<p>"I quite fail to understand your meaning." Mr. Pell had again
obtained a grasp on the situation, although he kept a very tight
grip on the side of the cart.</p>

<p>"You're the boy for my money. Keep it up, Pell, and you'll
pull off the trick."</p>

<p>"Again I quite fail to gather your meaning." A hazy impression
that his companion was making fun of him floated into Mr. Pell's
mind.</p>

<p>"Never mind understanding, Pell. Are you on?"</p>

<p>"On what? Certainly not on that horse."</p>

<p>"Who's a-askin' of yer? Look 'ere, Pell, will you do as I ask,
or will yer get down?"</p>

<p>Again the breakfast for which Mr. Pell was valiantly
struggling faded into the distance. Bewildered with the rapid
motion and the phraseology of his companion he muttered something
that the other took for an assent.</p>

<p>"That's the ticket! Now what I want is why can't I get a
decent price about this 'ere 'orse, and it'll take someone as
hinnercent as yerself to do it."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly inform me how I am to start about the
delicate negotiations with which you have entrusted me."</p>

<p>"All in good time, old buck. Here we are, and the missus has
the breakfast ready. In yer go an' I'll put you wise after."</p>

<p>The pacer swung into the yard and Horan threw the reins to an
expectant boy. From the house came a pleasant odour of
cooking.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was fed almost to repletion, for Mrs. Horan was a
good and generous cook. Smoking one of Horan's black cigars he
followed that worthy into the yard to receive his instructions:
The conference was a long one, and in spite of his absolute
ignorance of the sport of trotting, Pell began to be interested
in the matter. Besides, there appeared to be a possibility of a
certain amount of cash finding its way into his pockets, and that
was a matter on which he had strong convictions.</p>

<p>Fortified with a large breakfast and primed with, to him, a
mass of somewhat vague instructions, out of which the central
idea stood out plainly, Pell took a dignified farewell of his
host and started to walk back to the city. Half-way he stopped in
self-disgusted amazement. Absorbed in the delicate negotiations
entrusted to him and the wealth he would acquire if successful,
he had quite forgotten to obtain a temporary loan from Hogan to
provide for immediate necessities.</p>

<p>For the moment he had thoughts of retracing his steps, but old
experience told him that Horan was a generous payer by results,
while he was one of the most difficult men to extract a loan
from. He decided to go on and trust to his luck.</p>

<p>With his fingers round the four insignificant coins in his
pocket he stepped out citywards, his thoughts filled with the
wealth that would be his in the near future.</p>

<p>Midday on the Terrace is a good time to encounter the sports
of the city of Perth. There can be seen the owner, the jockey,
the bookmaker and the sportsman. The latter is an indefinable
specimen of modern civilization that discounts the wisdom of the
ages. He toils not, neither does he spin, yet Solomon in all his
glory was not arrayed as one of these. To be particular, none of
them seem to lack cash, and many indeed can produce a roll of
those dirty-looking crumpled notes that do duty in Australia for
the British sovereign.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell joined the group that is always to be found
supporting the walls of the United Service Hotel. Introductions
are not enforced in this branch of society, and a chance word or
two, professing a knowledge he did not possess, one of the many
phrases of Horan, coupled with, a clever reference to that
gentleman, soon gave Mr. Pell his favourite position, the centre
of the limelight.</p>

<p>"My friend, Mr. Horan," he commenced.</p>

<p>"Oh, Horan!" someone in the crowd ejaculated disdainfully.</p>

<p>"My friend, Mr. Horan, the owner of 'Laughing Bill' repeated
Mr. Pell with emphasis.</p>

<p>"'E's the winner of the Cup," interrupted a short thickset
man. "Per'aps 'e will, per'aps he wont."</p>

<p>"Goin' to win it yerself?"</p>

<p>The conversation was gradually drifting away from Mr.
Pell.</p>

<p>"Mr. Horan said to me this morning&mdash;" Our worthy was
determined to be heard and had raised his voice slightly.</p>

<p>"If Horan said 'is prayers it's all 'e did say," said the
short man with emphasis, "'E's the closest cuss I've ever had
to deal with."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had another try.</p>

<p>"Mr. Horan gave me to understand at breakfast this morning
that 'Laughing Bill' could not possibly lose the Cup."</p>

<p>"Did he now," the short man was openly derisive, "and what may
I ask did 'e charge for the professional advice?"</p>

<p>"'Laughing Bill' did 34 the other day. I 'ad the watch,"
interjected one of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Wot's that! 'Pretty Pride' did 27 to the mile in the last
Christmas Cup, an' she's on scratch this year."</p>

<p>"An' wot about 'Saucy Sam'? Why 'e did 18 the t'other mornin,"
I timed 'im meself, and 'e's honly 10 behind ."</p>

<p>And so the discussion bandied from one candidate for the big
race to the other. Mr. Pell walked away well satisfied. He had
carried out his instructions to the letter. Before he had gone
far a grimy hand was placed on his cuff.</p>

<p>"'Ave yer much on th' 'orse yerself, sir?"</p>

<p>A small wizened man with 'hanger on' written all over him was
the enquirer.</p>

<p>"Only a few hundreds, my man," replied Mr. Pell with dignity,
"but my affairs cannot possibly interest you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, sir," replied the man humbly, "perhaps I might
be able to 'elp a gentleman who might 'elp me."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell swelled with importance. "In what manner do you
suppose you could be of assistance to me, my man?"</p>

<p>"It's this way, sir. It may 'appen that I may come across some
hinformation that might be useful to a gent such as yer. An' if
so, a gent such as yer might feel grateful."</p>

<p>"In such an event, my friend," Mr. Pell rattled the few coins
in his pocket, "I should be extremely grateful."</p>

<p>"There might he a bit a-comin' now," insinuated the new
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"There will he nothing coming until the information," said Mr.
Pell emphatically.</p>

<p>"There ain't no flies on yer, now, is there," said the man
with grudging admiration. "Well, so long till temorrer. I'll tell
yer what's wot then if yer'll meet me 'ere."</p>

<p>Fingers in his waistcoat pockets, his chest well thrown out,
Mr. Pell strolled along the terrace to the William Street corner.
Pausing to survey the scanty traffic, Mr. Pell retraced his
steps. Outside the United Service Hotel he found, as he had
expected, Sol Arrons, the well-known and highly respected
bookmaker. While he had been talking to the 'sports' Mr. Pell had
noticed the bookmaker listening.</p>

<p>This time Mr. Arrons stopped him. "Excuse me my friend," Mr.
Arrons placed a finger, that sadly needed the services of a
manicurist, on the breast of Mr. Pell's coat. "Excuse me, but
have I not the pleasure of your acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"Have I?" said Mr. Pell, gently removing the finger. "Yes, I
believe it is Mr. Arrons! And what can I do for my worthy
friend?"</p>

<p>"I have heard you talking this morning of the 'Laughing Bill'
is it not so?" said Arrons, peering up into Mr. Pell's face. "Ah,
I thought I guessed right. And, perhaps a fine gentleman like
you, might like to have to have a little bet with old Arrons, on
the fine horse. Just one little bet with old Arrons. Fine
gentlemen like to bet with old Arrons."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell tried to look disdainful, and failed. He had angled
and caught his fish. Let Arrons swallow the bait he had nibbled
at, the bait that Mr. Pell had dangled along the Terrace for the
last hour, and the work was accomplished. Mr. Pell would have his
pockets filled again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might like to have a pony later, Arrons," he
replied as indifferently as he could. "If so, I will not forget
you."</p>

<p>Arrons fairly cringed. "It is good of you to say so," he
fawned. "But why not now? I will give you a good price, an
excellent price. I will&mdash;yes&mdash;I will be generous to
you, my dear friend&mdash;I will give you two to one. Just think,
two little sovereigns for one little sovereign bet."</p>

<p>"You what?" queried Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"On the 'Laughing Bill.'" Arrons appeared slightly astonished
at Mr. Pell's tone.</p>

<p>"No good to me," said Mr. Pell emphatically. "In fact I do not
think I will back the horse at all."</p>

<p>"But you are a friend of Mr. Horan's. You have the knowledge
of what the horse can do. You were with him this morning, and he
told you to back it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is the reason I will not bet." Mr. Pell tried to
look wise.</p>

<p>"You will not bet!" Arrons was excited now. "You have the
information. But I forget. It is dry for a gentleman to stand and
talk. You will come and have a little drink with me, and then you
will tell me what it was that our friend Horan said to you when
you had breakfast with him. Ach, is it not?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell condescended to take a drink at the expense of Mr.
Arrons, to the amazement of the habitués of the Hotel, who strove
vainly to remember a previous occasion on which Arrons had
'shouted' anyone a drink. After the drinks, Arrons steered Mr.
Pell into a vacant corner of the room and busied himself with the
pump-handle.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell responded nobly. He leaked information while not
appearing to do so. In fact, his appearance was that of a man who
strove vainly to retain a valuable secret entrusted to his
charge. With many expressions of goodwill, Arrons parted with his
friend.</p>

<p>Fingering five coins in his pocket, Mr. Pell sauntered towards
Hay Street. Stopping before his favourite restaurant, he took out
of his pocket a yellow coin that glittered in the noon sun.</p>

<p>"There is something in this racing game after all," observed
Mr. Pell to himself, with a sigh of satisfaction.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2">II. &mdash; THE PURSUIT OF A
FLY</a></h2>

<p class="first">IF a house be searched, however careful the
housewife, there will be surely found, in some odd nook or
corner, a cobweb. So in most cities of the world there are to be
found, in the odd corners, traps for the unwary human flies.
Tangarten Chambers, on the "Terrace," has an imposing position.
Most of the chambers are inhabited by members of the legal
fraternity. But there are others, and of the others is to be
numbered Mr. Peter Pell.</p>

<p>Pell had "arrived" since the day when the sun, on its daily
pilgrimage, had discovered him in his Esplanade bedchamber. A
lucky deal with the Terrace "odds-shouters," in which those
gentlemen had not displayed their accustomed acuteness, had
resulted in Mr. Pell becoming the owner of a fair banking
account. Success had bred encouragement, and Mr. Pell blossomed
out as a Land and Estate Agent.</p>

<p>It is sad to reflect that a business connected with so
dignified subjects as Lands and Estates should be the mantle for
so many rogues. Yet it is a fact that if a bad man sets out to
fleece his fellow men commercially, it is usually under the cloak
of a Land and Estate Agency.</p>

<p>In the case of Mr. Pell, that gentleman would have been
puzzled had he been required to find a client anything in the
shape of an estate, or even a small block of land.
Notwithstanding this minor drawback, the office was there and the
door emblazoned with the titles of the business Mr. Peter Pell
was willing to undertake.</p>

<p>As in the case of the cobweb in the house, so the net that Mr.
Pell set for the fly he was confident one day he would snare, was
set in an inconspicuous part of the inscription. It was a bare
and innocent web and announced quietly that on the other side of
that door were the offices of the "Great Fallgall G. M.
Syndicate."</p>

<p>Within the office Mr. Pell had done himself well. The carpet
on the floor, the large roll-top desk and the client's chair, all
bore an appearance of wealth. Mr. Pell was resplendent and would
have inspired confidence in the most wary of city men. With
prosperity, or the semblance of it, Mr. Pell had indulged his
taste in fine raiment to the fair. He affected the style of a
London business man, frock coat, and something neat and classy in
the matter of waistcoats. In the case of Mr. Pell, however, the
waistcoat was classy if not exactly neat. Whatever the general
taste may be, Mr. Pell fancied himself and grew more and more
complacent as he gazed at the large expanse of waistcoat revealed
by his office mirror.</p>

<p>The office of Mr. Peter Pell, Land and Estate Agent and
Secretary to the Great Fallgall Gold Mining Syndicate, had been
established for more than a couple of months, at the time our
records open, and the proprietor had begun to study his bank-book
with some misgivings. True one or two small flies had walked
round the web but had, in spite of the genial welcome they
received, contrived to back out of the trap without more than
singeing their wings. In fact the total takings of the "web" had
resulted in a paltry "fiver" while the expenses were large. Mr.
Pell did not complain. He was prepared to "stick it out" as he,
in a moment of confidence, stated to a friend, until the right
kind of fly (he did not use this exact expression) had become
entangled. To those who can wait, success will come.</p>

<p>One morning as Mr. Pell strolled in the direction of Tangarten
Chambers he had an inspiration that that day would later be
marked on the office calendar with a red circle. The sun was high
in the sky and the majority of the business men of the metropolis
were at their desks, but Mr. Pell did not hurry. Human flies are
foolish mortals and have not the intellect of their winged
confrères and if the human fly had noted the web for examination
it was certain that he would buzz around until Mr. "Spider" Pell
arrived. Therefore, without increasing his wonted leisurely pace,
Mr. Pell entered the Tangarten Chambers and cordially, yet
distantly, returned the salutation of the lift-boy. In the
exigency of existence Mr. Pell had fully realised the
potentialities of his fine presence and developed the art of
taking full advantage of it. But after a few months on the
register of the tenants of the Chambers he had become one of
notabilities of the building, in the eyes of the attendants. A
few cigars, a very little silver, and the trick was done. Mr.
Pell, with his tips at the wrong seasons of the year was
"it."</p>

<p>Arriving at the third floor, Mr. Pell withdrew from his
trouser pocket, by a silver chain that in size might have done
duty for the cable of a rather large toy man-o'-war, his office
key. Directly facing the lift entrance was the office of the
Great Fallgall G. M. Syndicate and standing at the door with all
signs of impatience stood "The Fly."</p>

<p>Too wary to frighten his prey, Mr. Pell opened his door and
strode to his desk. The "Fly" meekly followed him. Without
speaking, Mr. Pell opened his letters and indulged in a running
commentary on the contents. It might be as well to explain here
that these letters had been carefully prepared by Mr. Pell some
time previous and were nightly placed on the desk in preparation
of the visit of the "Fly." Here was the victim, and the spoiler
was ready and eager.</p>

<p>"Humph! Great Fallgall's up two points! Sanders wants to know
if any for sale! No none for him! Ho! So Matthews has made up his
mind to buy that house at last. Well he'll have to pay for the
delay. He'll spring another tenner if I hold off a bit. The
cheapest house in the State. What's this! Application for Great
Fallgall shares. Another! Yet another! And another!!! Let me see.
Five and ten are fifteen and ten hundred shares in one post are
twenty-five! Twenty-five good business!"</p>

<p>Then, thinking the "Fly" properly impressed, "Oh, beg pardon!
Didn't see you there. Come in, sir, make yourself comfortable.
Sit there. Now, tell me what I may have the pleasure of doing for
you?"</p>

<p>As the "Fly" seated himself gingerly in the client's chair,
beside the big desk, Mr. Pell took careful stock of him. He was a
tall thin man with a long gaunt face. His clothes were untidy and
looked ready made, but his boots were the true index to the man,
and, on a rapid survey, Mr. Pell ejaculated under his breath,
"Farmer."</p>

<p>A London spider would have profanely thought "yokel" but in
Western Australia the commercial spider is not so rude and
unpolished. He dignifies the "fly" from the country by the
correct appellation "farmer." It is not to be understood that
"yokel" or "farmer," there is any change in the established
methods of spiders. Both London and Perth spiders treat the
country visitors alike. Flatter and toady; tickle and excite.
But, in the end, skin them or swallow them alive.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell prepared to do both. The "Fly" prepared for the
interview by extracting from a large case a pair of the largest
and roundest spectacles Mr. Pell had ever seen. Perching them on
a very long thin nose, he proceeded to state his
requirements.</p>

<p>"My name is Smith, Joseph John Smith," he commenced in a high
nasal drawl. "You are the proprietor of this Great Fallgall Gold
Mine."</p>

<p>"Only the secretary," replied Mr. Pell modestly. "The
proprietors are umph&mdash;It is owned by a Syndicate, you
know!"</p>

<p>"Pre-cise-l-y," drawled Smith. "You are the secretary." Then
after a short pause came the question like the shot from a
gun.</p>

<p>"You sell the shares?"</p>

<p>"The Syndicate sells the shares," replied Mr. Pell smoothly,
wondering all the while what on earth his visitor was driving at.
"I am but the humble servant of the Syndicate."</p>

<p>"Pre-cise-l-y!" drawled Smith in exactly the same tone. Then a
change of voice. "You cannot deceive me."</p>

<p>"My dear sir!" Mr. Pell was horrified at the suggestion. "All
the dealings of this office are open to the widest, I may say the
fullest, investigation."</p>

<p>"That is what I intend, sir," exclaimed Smith, ferociously. "I
received one of your circulars."</p>

<p>"Prospectus," suggested Mr. Pell mildly. "It sounds so much
better."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" exploded Mr. Smith. "If I come from the country I am
not a born fool."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell tried to look hurt and really achieved a fair
success. "I have come to investigate this matter to the ground,
and if I like it&mdash;" here Mr. Smith sank his voice to an
impressive whisper, "I will buy it."</p>

<p>"Buy some shares?" asked Mr. Pell, for once out of his
depths.</p>

<p>"Buy the mine&mdash;all the
shares&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;controlling interest, sir,"
howled Mr. Smith with all the semblance of fury.</p>

<p>"That would be a very expensive operation," suggested Mr.
Pell, his heart sinking at the thought that his visitor was more
madman than "Fly."</p>

<p>"Expense, be damned," retorted Mr. Smith, leaning forward in
his chair and glaring at Mr. Pell through his large round
glasses. "Do you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I'm sure I don't know." Mr. Pell's imposing
waistcoat was visibly curving in at the waistline, and his collar
appeared to be undergoing some liquefying process.</p>

<p>"I'm Joseph John Smith, and I breed sheep?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell made an effort. "You can't buy shares like you do
sheep, Mr. Smith."</p>

<p>"Why not? Tell me why not. I've made my money in sheep. Lots
of it, lots of sheep. Why can't I buy anything I want as I buy
sheep. Tell me that."</p>

<p>"It will be a very expensive operation, Mr. Smith."</p>

<p>"Did I ever shirk an expensive operation? Ask the people of
the Gascoyne if any deal was too big for me. I'm a born
Australian, and nothing's too big for me."</p>

<p>"It will take a lot of money, Mr. Smith." Mr. Pell tried hard
to discover what ground he had to stand on. Either his visitor
was a clever business man, or into the web had walked one of the
fattest, juiciest flies that ever spider dreamed of. What dare he
put up to this glorious prey?</p>

<p>"I may tell you Mr. Smith," Mr. Pell continued, "that the mine
is undeveloped. We have taken out very fine specimens, sufficient
to show great possibilities. I don't want this information round
the town, but we have the very deepest, richest mine in the whole
of the Commonwealth. It will take a lot of capital to obtain the
controlling interest."</p>

<p>"Name your figure!" The large horny hand of the visitor moved
to his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"Not that, Mr. Smith." Mr. Pell waved the thought of a cheque
aside with a magnificent gesture. "Not that! We must go into the
matter a lot more carefully before I can venture to accept your
cheque."</p>

<p>Joseph John Smith extended the hand that hovered around his
breast pocket in the direction of Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"Shake!" he exclaimed. "You're an honest man."</p>

<p>Fortified with the good opinion of his visitor, Mr. Pell
devoted himself to posting his prey in the details of the Great
Fallgall G. M. Facts and figures rolled from his tongue in a
manner that would, as a writer of fiction, have assured him more
than a competence. As a walking delegate of a trades union he
would have been an unqualified success.</p>

<p>"It comes to this," concluded Mr. Pell. "It will cost you
about three thousand pounds or thereabouts to take up the balance
of shares in the possession of the Syndicate, and about fifteen
hundred more to repurchase the balance of shares necessary to
give you the control."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid, so." Mr. Pell was disappointed. He felt that
fate had used him unkindly in not instructing him more fully of
the tender morsel prepared for his detection.</p>

<p>"Will you have the cheque now, or wait till you get it?"</p>

<p>"Wait until I get it," promptly exclaimed Mr. Pell. Again a
doubt arose in his mind as to the fallibility of his "Fly." Was
he to discover after all his work that the "Fly" was in reality a
brother "spider"?</p>

<p>"Spoken like a man!" exclaimed Smith with satisfaction.
"Now&mdash;" and again the horny hand moved in the direction of
the breast pocket.</p>

<p>"My dear sir!" Mr. Pell stretched forth a detaining hand. "I
could not think of such a thing. You must examine. You must
enquire. You, sir, may deem me to be an honest man, but others
may think otherwise. I have enemies. What successful man has not.
You must enquire. I insist you must satisfy yourself that Peter
Pell is the honest man you now think him."</p>

<p>"That's all right, my boy," exclaimed Smith genially "I ain't
dealt with men up north to be taken in by a town shark. Don't you
think it."</p>

<p>"Your candour does you credit, sir, and touches my heart." Mr.
Pell produced a very fine pocket handkerchief and vigorously blew
his nose. He felt that a tear would be a great relief, but had
not the power to raise one. He would have much preferred a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Look 'ere, Pell." Smith leaned forward in his chair and laid
his hand on the well turned leg of Mr. Pell. "Take that
cheque."</p>

<p>"No." The monosyllable was decisive.</p>

<p>Smith looked keenly at Mr. Pell. "I thought you wouldn't! You
wouldn't have got it if you had said 'yes.' I ain't no fool, and
its only fools that pay the price asked 'em for the goods. Now
I'll make you an offer."</p>

<p>"Sir!" exclaimed Mr. Pell&mdash;the fly was walking right into
the trap and in a moment the door would shut behind him. "Sir, I
will give to your offer my gravest consideration, but you must
remember that I am only the servant of the Syndicate and they
must determine your offer. My word," here Mr. Pell swelled
visibly&mdash;'carries great weight with the Syndicate. I would
deceive you if I let you think otherwise. And that word will be
used in your favour, of course, providing your offer is
commensurate with the value of the mine. But I am afraid&mdash;I
am afraid&mdash;" and Mr. Pell's head rolled gently on its fleshy
support.</p>

<p>"Well then!" Mr. Smith sat upright with a visible jump. "Tell
your Syndicate, or whatever you like to call them, that I will
give them two thousand pounds for the whole concern, lock, stock
and barrel."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell stared. Two thousand pounds! And that for a piece of
ground that, if it held gold, still retained the secret.
Certainly the ground was there. He, himself, had taken over the
mining rights from a hard up friend some month or more ago, but
he had never seen the property and, from what he had heard, gold
had not been discovered within many weary miles of the
location.</p>

<p>Two thousand pounds! His tongue gently inserted itself between
his lips tasting the sweetness of the offer, for Mr. Pell had a
fancy for the sweets of this life. Two thousand pounds! His eyes
dropped to the large expanse of fancy waistcoat of which he was
so proud. What fancy waistcoats could be not design and buy? Two
thousand pounds! The world had been well lost for less.</p>

<p>"And," went on the voice of the fly, "for yourself, if you
bring off the deal, there is a little packet of notes that
might&mdash;mind I say might&mdash;total about two hundred and
fifty. You'll put it through, Pell."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell's tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. Two thousand
two hundred and fifty pounds. British, Australian, English notes,
call them what you please. It required a supreme effort on his
part to regain his composure.</p>

<p>"Sir!" and the rich round voice rolled through the small
office, "your offer as a bribe, I repudiate with indignation,
with scorn. But&mdash;but as the offer of a friend, I should say,
as a little testimonial to my integrity,
and&mdash;and&mdash;business capacity&mdash;" even Mr. Pell could
not leave it entirely to 'integrity,' "&mdash;it would be valued
and esteemed."</p>

<p>"Say no more," replied the 'Fly.' When?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell would gladly have shouted "Now!" but prudence
forbade. With the greatest control he could muster, he stated, "I
shall have to call a meeting of the Syndicate. Shall we say the
day after tomorrow?"</p>

<p>With a grasp of the hand that made Mr. Pell wince, the "fly"
emerged from the web, leaving the "spider" to ponder. For some
time after Smith had left, Mr. Pell sat at his desk, leaning an
aching head on his hands. Barely could he realise what had
happened. Here was a man, dropped apparently from the clouds with
a pocket full of money, asking, nay begging, Mr. Pell to relieve
him of some. Did the skies rain fools?</p>

<p>THE MEETING of the members of the Syndicate took place in Mr.
Pell's office as soon as Mr. Pell could recover his mental
equilibrium. Mr. Pell was in the chair. The reading of the
minutes of the Syndicate was voted unnecessary on the motion of
Mr. Pell, seconded by the same gentleman. As a matter of urgency,
the acceptance of the offer of Mr. Joseph John Smith, of two
thousand pounds for a block of land Mr. Pell had not, and did not
want to see, was moved by Mr. Pell and seconded from the Chair.
Let but the "fly" venture his nose in the web again and the trap
would be sprung.</p>

<p>During the afternoon of the next day, Mr. Pell was called to
the 'phone. The conversation was short and pithy, yet entirely
satisfactory to at least one member of the connection.</p>

<p>"Well?" came the voice along the line.</p>

<p>"Right-ho!" exclaimed Mr. Pell. Ordinarily he was adverse to
slang.</p>

<p>"Cheque?" was the next question that struck Mr. Pell's
ear.</p>

<p>"Cash! Ten tomorrow!"</p>

<p>And then along the line echoed Mr. Pell's last lapse from the
correctness of speech: "Right-oh."</p>

<p>The following day Mr. Pell handed over the Great Fallgall Gold
Mine, together with all rights in the registered offices of the
Company, to Mr. Joseph John Smith and walked forth, a man without
an occupation. In his breast pocket reposed a neat rubber-banded
wad of paper inscribed with the signature of the Commonwealth
Treasurer. Behind him he left a new secretary to the Great
Fallgall Gold Mining Syndicate, together with an office of which
the rent was long in arrears, office furniture for which an
Australian Chinese was indignantly demanding hire purchase, and a
telephone that at any moment might become dumb, unless the
Postmaster General was pacified. All he left behind, but his
fancy waistcoat stood out like the guiding flame that led the
Israelites through the terrors of the desert, and against that
waistcoat reposed the sum of two thousand two hundred and fifty
pounds.</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed, Mr. Fell often thought of Joseph
John Smith. Surely he had, been the "Fly" of flies. Mr. Pell
thought with sore impatience of the carefully baited trap he had
prepared, and of its uselessness. Any old thing would have
sufficed with such a "Fly."</p>

<p>Then one morning, as Mr. Pell was carefully absorbing the
breakfast of two ordinary men, his eye was caught by a double
column heading in the <i>West Australian</i>. It spoke of gold,
not in the usual quantities wrung from reluctant mother earth but
in buckets, pails, truckloads. Gold to be taken for the
asking&mdash;by those who were lucky to own that valuable spot of
this earth's surface. And the name of the mine was The Great
Fallgall Goldmine Limited, with Mr. Joseph John Smith, Managing
Director.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell laid the newspaper on the table with great care. One
might almost have thought it breakable.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he ejaculated, "and he could have got that old
hole off me for a 'fiver.'"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3">III. &mdash; IN PURSUIT OF
LOVE</a></h2>

<p class="first">TO the man who has achieved, a period of
relaxation is given. This is one of the customs of modern
civilisation that is becoming an unwritten law. Thoughts,
somewhat on these lines, occupied Mr. Peter Pell's mind as he
strolled along Hay Street West, one fine March afternoon. He had
succeeded. In the safe custody of his bank reposed two thousand
pounds odd. It had been won by him, if not by the sweat of his
brow, certainly by assiduous thought. That the man from whose
banking account his present wealth had come had benefited to a
greater extent mattered not a jot to Mr. Pell, and when to his
memory occurred the time when he sought a hard and airy couch on
the Esplanade, he thanked heaven he was not as other men.</p>

<p>It has been recorded that the afternoon was fine and it may be
further noted that Mr. Pell's mental condition in every way
matched the weather. He was at peace with himself and his fellow
men. He had time and to spare on his hands, yet he did not intend
to remain long idle. Far from that; already he was on the watch
to again raid the wealth of the unwary. Not that he allowed
himself to think of any future financial operation in that light;
it was business, pure business.</p>

<p>Two thousand pounds is not wealth; Mr. Pell fully realised
this. And he realised that into his system had entered a new
interest. He desired wealth for what wealth would bring, large
meals to sustain his fine commanding figure; wealth to bring to
his wardrobe the fine raiment for which his soul longed&mdash;the
radiant waistcoat, the smooth broadcloth. Then again he desired,
as he surely deserved, ornamentation. Across his flamboyant
waistcoat stretched a chain of fine gold. Already gold, in his
mind, had assumed a minor place in the order of precious things.
What was finer than gold? For a moment he thought kindly of a
watch chain studded with diamonds. But from such desecration Mr.
Pell's artistic soul revolted. A chain of platinum? Yes, that
would serve to impress and it was not gaudy, but&mdash;</p>

<p>By what process of reasoning Mr. Pell's thought travelled from
precious stones to Love (a capital "L" please) it is hard to say.
Yet it must be recorded that on the top of the hill Mr. Pell
stopped dead in his carefully considered walk, struck with the
idea of love.</p>

<p>So far in his life&mdash;and Mr. Pell had attained the age of
53, just the prime of life, as he had informed his landlady that
very morning&mdash;he had not considered the question of Love.
There was certainly a fly in that ointment, for Love must be
connected with Woman.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had never taken women seriously in his life. Up to
the fatal moment when, stopping in his walk at the top of Hay
Street Hill, women had always appeared to be something apart from
his life. Other men had sweethearts and wives. Mr. Pell had sung
about them at sundry "smokers" when he could induce the organiser
to allow him to favour the company with a musical effort, but the
thought of women in so intimate a relation to himself quite took
away his breath.</p>

<p>Yet there was something in the idea that appealed to him. The
successful business man&mdash;and Mr. Pell had come to the point
when he classed himself as a successful business man&mdash;was
set off, or it might be said illuminated by, a wife. It would be
pleasant to be able to invite some business acquaintance he
desired to impress, to dine and spend the evening with
himself&mdash;and his wife.</p>

<p>The thought quite took away his breath. Once accustomed to the
thought of a wife, and it did not take the agile brain of Mr.
Pell long to arrive there, the question arose, "Who?" Certain
ladies of his acquaintance were swiftly passed under review. Only
one of them nearly filled the bill. Mr. Pell had almost decided
on the lady&mdash;getting to the point of engagement rings, when
Cupid revolted. Modern science has quite done away with the
belief in the God of Love. Yet the scientists have still to
explain why, when a man of a certain age, say 53, determines on
love, and a certain lady, something inside of him kicks, and
kicks hard. Why is it that big imposing men marry little
insignificant women, and large fine women look around them for a
man they could squash in a hat box. Yet such is the case. Love is
not logical, in fact it is most illogical. Towns are full of
love's mistakes, long men and short wives, elderly women and
young husbands, and all the variations of the intermediates.</p>

<p>Certain scientists have endeavoured to explain Love as a
microbe. Others by a cell that reaches maturity at a definite age
and attracts like cells in the opposite sex. Facts are hard
things, and while the scientists fool themselves that they have
satisfactorily explained the myth of the ancients away, the
majority of people are quite content to place all the blame for
the misfits on Cupid&mdash;it saves blaming themselves.</p>

<p>So, when Mr. Pell had reached the stage when his mind wandered
over the ladies of his acquaintance, in the search of a suitable
mate, the little god gave a cough and squirm, and another misfit
was quickly fitted into human society.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had stopped in his measured walk. He had also stopped
immediately outside an open gate. In his vision of the future
Mrs. Pell, he had half turned and faced the roadway. This was the
opportunity of the god of Love's misfits!</p>

<p>"Fido! Fido! Come here, you bad dog. Oh, he will be lost!" It
was a feminine voice and not by any means an unmusical one. In a
moment of sanity Mr. Pell would have flown to the rescue, for
gallantry was not the least of his accomplishments. Now, however,
he was wrapped in the visions of his brain. But Fido had received
his instructions from other than a mortal being, and he proceeded
with the utmost promptitude to carry them out. He dived through
the gate and between Mr. Pell's legs. That gentleman sat down on
the pavement, hardly and emphatically, narrowly missing the cause
of his trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was shocked&mdash;in a physical sense. A gentleman of
'fine' figure cannot hastily assume a sitting position without
some disturbance of his mental equilibrium also. When he began to
realise what had happened to him he also became aware of a lady
bending over him. It was a lesson in self-control that should
have had a wider audience. Mr. Pell's impulse on reaching the
pavement with a certain portion of his anatomy had been to
swear&mdash;and Mr. Pell had a choice collection of remarks in
stock, most of them very suitable for the occasion&mdash;but the
face of his fair assister caused him to bite them back so quickly
that he wondered if he had bitten his tongue by the shock of the
descent, or by strength of will.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear! I am so sorry! it was my naughty Fido. I
hope you are not seriously injured!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell gravely assumed an upright position. Even he, with
his strict deportment, would not have described his movements as
graceful. Gentlemen with 'fine' figures cannot spring to their
feet wish the agility of youth, and it is debatable if they can
fall with any more grace.</p>

<p>"My dear madam, pray do not distress yourself. I assure you I
am in no way discomposed. Your fine terrier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is a collie," corrected the lady mildly.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell thought that his definition of
the&mdash;ahem!&mdash;dog that had caused his downfall much more
appropriate. There is something alike in "terrier' and 'terror'
that was almost soothing, but he was too polite to
contradict.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, collie," he replied gently. "I am sorry I did not
get a closer inspection of your pet."</p>

<p>"How nice of you to put it like that," cooed the lady. "Some
men would have been furious at the poor dear."</p>

<p>"Madam, they would not have deserved the name of
'gentlemen.'"</p>

<p>Peter was himself again. Certainly his fair assistant was all
that the heart of a man could desire. But a few words, and Mr.
Pell felt a distinct fluttering beneath his pocket book.</p>

<p>"You must come into my house and let me brush you down,"
insisted the lady with gentle authority.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell now took his first survey of the house. It was
certainly a fine house and must have cost at least four figures
to buy&mdash;Mr. Pell reduced most of the material things of this
earth to figures. It was her house. Mr. Pell looked again at his
hostess. She was certainly as fine a figure of a woman as he was
of a man. They would make a fine couple. Again the fluttering at
his heart.</p>

<p>The lady led the way into a handsomely furnished sitting room
and relieved Mr. Pell of his hat and stick. The next operation
was with a clothes brush, and here there was a small trial of
politeness that ended in Mr. Pell brushing his own clothing. The
lady had yielded, and he could not but admire the graceful way in
which she had bowed to masculine control. A perfect woman&mdash;a
perfect wife. Again the fluttering!</p>

<p>The operations with the clothes brush having concluded, the
lady suggested a glass of wine as a soother and strengthener
after the shock. Mr. Pell could certainly not drink unless the
lady gave countenance and encouragement. The lady was willing.
There ensued a duel of courtesy. The lady went to the
sideboard&mdash;it certainly was a handsome well-made piece of
furniture&mdash;and poured out the wine into two generous
glasses.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell then escorted her to a chair and returning, served
the lady from a silver salver. The salver weighed pleasantly in
his hands. Replacing the salver, Mr. Pell bowed gravely to the
lady, who rose and returned the salutation. They then seated
themselves. It was like a figure of some stately old-fashioned
minuet.</p>

<p>The lady looked at Mr. Pell and was immediately struck with
his "fine" figure. She sighed. "I am so glad it was no
worse."</p>

<p>"Madam, it is the hand of fate that led me to felicity."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir."</p>

<p>Admirers of Mr. Pell must have noted that on no occasion had
he been found lacking in speech. With so fair an incentive he
considered&mdash;in examining the situation later&mdash;that he
had excelled all former efforts. The lady was willing, and from
the usual society small talk became almost confidential. She
pleaded the drawbacks of a lonely life. Mr. Pell spoke of the
hardships of the wealthy bachelor in lodgings, and the
forwardness of landladies was delicately hinted at. The lady was
sympathetic. Finally an invitation to call was given and
accepted.</p>

<p>Considering the interview over his chop at the Savoy Grill
Rooms, Mr. Pell noted the following points. First, the lady was a
widow. Secondly, her name was Mrs. Pascoe. Thirdly, she was
certainly well-off. Fourthly, she had an evident admiration for
the stronger sex. Fifthly, she had most delicately, so very
delicately, bewailed her hard fate in not having a masculine
intelligence and arm to lean her burdens upon. At the thought of
the masculine arm Mr. Pell's curved instinctively&mdash;and the
waitress edged away quickly, and tried to look scandalised.</p>

<p>Men of commerce have many and devious paths to knowledge. Mr.
Pell, as a shining light of commerce, soon attained a true
knowledge of the circumstances in which the late Mr. Pascoe had
left his widow. They were very satisfactory. Mrs. Pascoe lived in
her own house. The furniture was her own. There were no Bills of
Sale or other such uncomfortable legalities. And there were
satisfactory and substantial gilt-edged securities to which the
lady could lay undivided and unencumbered claim. Altogether Mr.
Pell felt that Mrs. Pascoe was a lady that could be loved not
only for herself, but for all she had. Again the fluttering
behind his pocket book.</p>

<p>The first visit was followed by others. Gradually Mr. Pell lay
siege to the fortress of the widow's heart. Carefully he
encompassed her with the siege lines of his love. Valiantly he
attacked the outworks, and one by one entered them and raised the
standard of the Pells. Only the main bulwarks so far resisted.
The lady was coy. She allowed her admirer certain small favours.
The pressure of her hand at meeting and parting. The intimacy of
the divided sofa. Once, joyful day, he was permitted to retain
that small plump hand in his for five minutes, while the lady
described with remarkable exactitude the last moments of the late
lamented, never-to-be-replaced, Horace Pascoe. At the end of the
pathetic recital he was privileged to offer his fine cambric
handkerchief, with the neat, if somewhat prominent monogram, to
catch the soft-shed tear.</p>

<p>That afternoon he walked home on air&mdash;at least he thought
he did. Mr. Pell had well laid his campaign against the forlorn
heart of the widow. But two months had gone and he had
established his footing in the house of Pascoe. Already he looked
upon a certain vacant peg on the hat stand as peculiarly his
own.</p>

<p>It was while he was brushing his hair one morning, he
determined that Mrs. Pascoe's coyness must be stormed. The lady
liked him, nay, in the privacy of his bedchamber, Mrs. Pell dared
to declare that she loved him. What were his feeling towards her?
From the moment he had first seen her face bending over him with
commiseration, and sympathy for his fall, he had considered
himself a lost man&mdash;lost in the mazes of Love's wilderness.
He could congratulate himself that he had in no way, in the siege
of the widow, departed from the strict canons of courtship as be
understood them. He must put his fate to the test.</p>

<p>A careless sweep of the brush, that revealed the fact that the
bald spot he so carefully concealed from the public gaze was
steadily enlarging, also reminded him that time stood still for
no man. Could a bald man woo? Never! Then he must woo and marry
before his baldness became too apparent.</p>

<p>Full of resolve, he waited until four o'clock that afternoon
and then set out for the widow's residence. He knew he would be
expected, for a decided hint had been given that all callers but
himself would be denied that afternoon. As he entered the hall
and gave his hat and stick to the comely maid in attendance, he
eyed the hat-stand peg with a friendly eye. Perchance, when again
he called, he would have a definite future right to, not only the
peg, but the hat-stand as well. He did not intend to pander to
widowly coyness once the fatal 'Yes' was spoken.</p>

<p>"So you have come&mdash;at last." The last two words fell very
softly from the lady's lips.</p>

<p>"Dear lady!" Mr. Pell had once been a student of Charles
Garvise. He raised the plump hand of the widow to his lips.</p>

<p>"I expected you." The lady was making the running with some
vigour thought Mr. Pell, but one glance round the room stifled
all doubts.</p>

<p>"I am in trouble and wanted so much the support of your
business intellect. I wondered if you would call."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell led the lady to the accustomed sofa and bowed her to
the seat. Then majestically he seated himself beside her.</p>

<p>"Would I allow the fairest lady in Perth to be troubled? Tell
me what you desire and it shall be done." Mr. Pell had some idea
this was a quotation, but it fitted very neatly.</p>

<p>"I have some money idle in the bank," continued Mrs. Pascoe
with some hint of business ability, "and I thought of investing
it in 'Great Fallgalls.'"</p>

<p>"No, no, certainly not." Mr. Pell's words came rushing out in
a manner that quite startled the widow.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought the mine was quite safe. Do you know anything
against it?"</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Pell had recovered his composure. The mention
of the Great Fallgall G. M. had been something of a shock to him.
It would never do for the future Mrs. Pell to have any shares in
the mine he had once owned. There had gathered lately a suspicion
in the back of Mr. Pell's mind that Joseph John Smith bad been a
good deal less "flyish" than he had supposed.</p>

<p>"I think," said Mr. Pell, speaking with some weight, "I should
advise something a little more gilt-edged."</p>

<p>"But they pay such little dividends." The widow pouted.</p>

<p>"But they are so safe, dear lady!"</p>

<p>"I like a little flutter," remonstrated the lady.</p>

<p>"And sometimes little flutters pay nothing, not even your
capital." Mr. Pell spoke grimly. "I should not like you to fail
in your investments."</p>

<p>"You are so careful of me," murmured the lady.</p>

<p>"Are you not made to be taken care of?" Mr. Pell was gradually
screwing himself up to the proper pitch.</p>

<p>"Ah! dear!" It was but a sigh that issued from those fair
lips. "Oh, my dear!" And the substantial arm of Mr. Pell fell
from the back of the sofa and stopped at the ample waist, of the
lady.</p>

<p>"What would you advise?" gently asked the widow not appearing
to notice the encircling arm.</p>

<p>"A man!" Mr. Pell replied thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>The widow tried to look shocked.</p>

<p>"But I can't invest in a man!" she giggled.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Mr. Pell, like a famous French Emperor, was
compelling victory out of almost disaster.</p>

<p>"How?" The widow was insistent.</p>

<p>"Men are made for husbands." Mr. Pell was stentorious.</p>

<p>"How nice!" Here the arm had tightened so that the widow could
not but notice it.</p>

<p>"You mustn't do that!"</p>

<p>"Do what?" Mr. Pell happy in the knowledge that matters were
going his way, grew quite playful.</p>

<p>"Put your arm around me, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words of the widow were interrupted by the flinging open
of the door, and the dancing entry of a little girl of about five
years old.</p>

<p>"Please, I've come!" laughed the newcomer.</p>

<p>"Oh, you darling!" gushed the widow. "Come and give me a big,
big kiss."</p>

<p>The baby danced across the room and stopped quickly before Mr.
Pell and the lady. With a grave little curtsey she presented a
bouquet of flowers to Mrs. Pascoe.</p>

<p>"Many, many, happy returns of the day, Granny," she said very
properly, and then with a laugh and a blush flung herself into
the outstretched arms of the widow.</p>

<p>"<i>Granny</i>!" Mr. Pell's air castles came tumbling about
his ears. "<i>Granny</i>!"</p>

<p>How he got out of the house Mr. Pell could never afterwards
explain to himself. That he escaped was all he knew. Granny!
Surely never man was so hardly used in this world! And, as he
wended his weary way to the lonely apartments he had that
afternoon taken a mental farewell of, an absurd voice in his
brain insisted that somewhere in the Prayer Book there was a
clause that stated: "A man may not marry a Grandmother."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">IV. &mdash; IN PURSUIT OF AN
OCCUPATION</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT is a fallacy that work was made for man. Yet
it is a common knowledge that the only man that can exist without
work is the man in love. There is something in love, that permits
the ordinary individual to neglect his work in the world, to
neglect his food, his clothing, his very existence. The lover
lives in a world of his own, peopled by one solitary individual
of the feminine sex, with a chorus of white wings, golden harps
and angelic halos.</p>

<p>Some people may quarrel with the confining of the attributes
of the true lover to the masculine sex and the consequent
elevation of the eternal feminine to the position of the
worshipped. It is but stating a fact. Women are not good lovers.
A woman will not neglect all the decencies and amenities of
modern civilization for the privilege of pondering over the
attributes of the adored&mdash;as seen through rose coloured
spectacles.</p>

<p>Who has ever seen a woman among other women neglecting to
scrutinise the dresses around her, bump into passers, neglect her
hair and above all her meals? Yet this is the normal condition of
the male lover. The female lover has a sharp eye for the set of
the neck-tie, the collar must be well laundered, and she much
prefers the taste of an ice-cream soda to that of the most
profusely moustached lips that were ever pressed to hers.</p>

<p>Females take love in homeopathic doses, males by the
bucketful. Thus, Mr. Pell, while in the thralls of the widow
Pascoe, neglected his food and his dress. His landlady, Mrs.
McPhee, stated to an intimate friend over the back garden wall,
that for the whole of the two months he never ate more than would
have sufficed for an average man. Mr. Pell's account book, and he
was one of those methodical men who entered up every night the
expenditure of the day, showed that during the period he had not
purchased even one new fancy waistcoat. With a return to normal
conditions Mr. Pell found himself suffering from lack of
occupation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pascoe had been occupation enough for him during her
brief reign, but with her involuntary abdication, and elevation
to the dignity of a grandmother, Mr. Pell felt again within his
breast a desire to engage in the stress of the commercial fight.
A man with a capital of four figures should have no difficulty in
finding a suitable occupation. Yet Mr. Pell was definite that any
occupation he entered into must comply with certain
conditions.</p>

<p>First, it must not be strenuous or dirty work&mdash;speaking
in the material sense of the word. Then it must not entail too
close attention or too much office routine. Lastly it must mean
quick money and plenty of it. The last, like the postscript of a
lady's letter, contains the crux of the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had once in his life engaged in the occupation of
Estate and Land Agent. There were reasons that he should not, at
least for some time, engage in any of that business. Not that
there was anything recorded against him derogatory to his fair
name. On the contrary, considered impartially Mr. Pell had been
considerably victimised. He had unwittingly possessed a valuable
piece of property. Another man had basely deprived him of the
fruits of his industry. Mr. Pell did not bear malice and would
willingly have shaken Mr. John Joseph Smith warmly by the
hand.</p>

<p>For the week succeeding the revelation of the perfidy of the
widow, Mr. Pell was the most miserable man on earth&mdash;so he
thought. He was no longer in love, and he had no occupation. A
mind so great as his immediately sought the
solution&mdash;work!</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was at breakfast. Under the kind administration of
Mrs. McPhee he had arrived at the stage of bread and butter
crowned with a thick, impenetrable layer of marmalade. Beside him
lay the morning post. Mr. Pell never mixed business and pleasure,
and the letters lay neglected until the pleasures of the table
were exhausted.</p>

<p>At length Mrs. McPhee entered and removed
the&mdash;er&mdash;slain. She smiled as she surveyed the field of
battle&mdash;Mrs. McPhee was no ordinary landlady, and perhaps
she was susceptible to the fine figure of her lodger. Mr. Pell
carefully raised his slippered feet on to a chair and reached for
his correspondence. The first letter he opened bore the heading
of the Great Fallgall Gold Mining Company Ltd., and read as
follows:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Sir,<br> <br> You have no doubt read of
the great success of the mine this Company lately purchased from
you. We believe that you have a sentimental interest in the
success of the property and therefore request the favour of a
call at the earliest possible moment,<br> <br> Yours
faithfully,<br> The Great Fallgall G. M. Ltd.<br> Joseph John
Smith<br> Managing Director.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell read the letter carefully, twice, and then pondered.
What had occurred that J.J. Smith should send for him. Had
anything been discovered that might possibly occasion pain and
trouble to the late owner, Mr. Peter Pell. He could not think of
any point in the transaction he had left unguarded. Finally,
neglecting his other correspondence and assuming his hat and
boots, Mr. Pell made his way to Landgarten Chambers.</p>

<p>The offices of the Great Fallgall Gold Mine had been removed
to a lower floor and accommodation greatly extended. There was
every sign of prosperity. A small army of clerks appeared to be
busy on the work of recording the amount of gold wrung from the
earth. Mr. Pell marched to the shining mahogany counter and
rapped impatiently for attention.</p>

<p>At the mention of his name doors flew open by magic and in the
shortest possible space of time Mr. Pell found himself face to
face with the Managing Director.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph John Smith was just as gaunt and abrupt as ever.
His clothes were perhaps a shade better than when Mr. Pell had
first met him but his hands were just as calloused and moist. He
greeted Mr. Pell brusquely and pointed to a seat.</p>

<p>"Sit down! Glad you've called. I wanted to see you! Wait until
I've got this infernal letter off my mind! Smoke?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell accepted a cigar and leant back in the client's
chair. In days past Mr. Pell had considered himself amongst the
elect in the noble art of "Fly-trapping," but now in J.J. Smith
he recognised a master mind. Just the right stand off. The busy
attitude that was the real thing. It impressed. In fact, it
impressed Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"There, that's done." J.J. Smith swung round to face his
visitor. "You're looking all right. How's your health?"</p>

<p>Suitably responding, Mr. Pell made a gentle inquiry as to the
meaning of the letter he had received that morning.</p>

<p>"That's all right. Wanted to see you. What are you doing
now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>"That's bad. Anything in view?"</p>

<p>"I am looking round for a suitable business to embark my
capital in," Mr. Pell explained.</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere about £2,500," Mr. Pell replied. "Nothing great, to
a financier like you."</p>

<p>"Pre-cise-l-y!" drawled J.J. Smith. He placed the tips of his
fingers together and gazing into a dark corner of the ceiling.
"Perhaps, I can help you." There was a long pause as Mr. Pell
decided not to reply.</p>

<p>"Let's be candid," J.J. said suddenly. "You think you are
aggrieved by the way we diddled you out of the mine?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Mr. Pell, promptly. "I got my
price."</p>

<p>"Rather more I think," exploded J.J. Smith. "I could have had
that old hole off you for a damned sight less. I paid you for the
booming you did for us."</p>

<p>"I'm satisfied," replied Mr. Pell, doggedly. It was not to his
interest, until the other had opened out, to appear
otherwise.</p>

<p>"You may be, I'm not," snarled J.J. Smith.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to return you one penny," replied Mr. Pell with
heat.</p>

<p>"Who asked you? I didn't!"</p>

<p>J.J. Smith leant over and grasped Mr. Pell's well-turned leg.
"There's those with us that think that we could have made use of
you and that I was a fool to let you out." Then after a pause he
continued. "I'm one of them."</p>

<p>Pell said nothing. For the moment he could not grasp the
situation. He was a man offering something for nothing. Somewhere
in this wood-pile hid a nigger. It was up to him to scoop out the
intruder.</p>

<p>"If you're on for a good thing I have one to offer you.
There's your desk&mdash;" pointing to a far corner, "&mdash;and
there's a pile for you to make if you choose."</p>

<p>"And what do you and your friends want from me?" retorted Mr.
Pell cautiously.</p>

<p>"We want you to join the Board!"</p>

<p>"That means qualifying," replied Mr. Pell. "I am afraid I can
hardly do that!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" J.J. Smith had slipped down in his chair until his
head was only a few inches above the backrail. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"I'm not putting any of my cash into gold mines." Mr. Pell
winked a knowing eye at Joseph John Smith.</p>

<p>"Bosh," replied that individual impolitely. "Who asked you to
do any such thing? That part's already arranged. Say you're on
and the stock shall be handed over."</p>

<p>"And the conditions?"</p>

<p>"Lord, man, you're as shy as a two year old." J.J. Smith
wriggled up in his chair. "Can't you understand plain Australian?
You join the Board. We find the qualifications."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell rose from his chair and bent over J.J. Smith
aggressively. "Look here! You may call me a two-year-old, or any
other thing that takes your fancy, but I'm not buying a
pig-in-the-poke from you or any other man. Where do you and your
Board come in?"</p>

<p>"Top hole, sonny!" J.J. Smith wriggled himself to a seated
position and laughed into Mr. Pell's face. "Lord, what a
suspicious brute you are. Look here! You join the Board. We find
the qualification shares. There's your desk. You come and help me
work things. Are you on?"</p>

<p>For some moments Mr. Pell considered. As the proposition stood
he could see no danger to his pocket. Yet he was to get a lot and
the other party's share was in the mist. Was there anything wrong
with the mine? Did they want to mix him up in the matter and make
a scapegrace of him or was Smith simply out to raid his bank-roll?
Either possibility held an attraction that appealed to the
vanity of Mr. Pell. The man that could get him into a corner and
skin him, monetarily or in reputation, did not in Mr. Pell's
opinion live. There was a catch somewhere. Where was it? Mr. Pell
determined to find out.</p>

<p>"I'm on!" he announced, briefly.</p>

<p>"Good!" J.J. Smith rose to his feet and extended a large hand
for Mr. Pell's grip. "Meeting of the directors this afternoon.
Three p.m. You'll be appointed and take your seat at next
meeting. Start here tomorrow morning, and I'll make you sweat or
my name's not J.J."</p>

<p>During the rest of the day Mr. Pell wandered from one
acquaintance to another looking for the "nigger." In every
quarter he found the Mine well spoken of. Shares were hard to get
and there was every prospect of them being quoted at a premium
when a quotation was obtained on the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>From a friend Mr. Pell obtained a prospectus of the Company
and found that the qualification of a Director was one thousand
fully paid up pound shares. Why then did Mr. Smith and his
fellows want to part with £1,000? There were good names on the
list of directors, and Mr. Pell did not flatter himself that his
name would lend any further lustre to the Mine. Many plausible
suppositions occurred to Mr. Pell, but all were rejected. He was
to get too much and give too little&mdash;now he was to give
nothing.</p>

<p>Nine-thirty the next morning Mr. Pell entered the offices of
the Great Fallgall G. M. Ltd., very curious to know what the
future held. It was, thought Mr. Pell, something like the old
conjuring trick where the operator takes an empty hat and
produces from it many interesting things and finally a cannon
ball. Mr. Pell shivered at the idea of the cannon ball. If there
was a <i>quid pro quo</i> in the present arrangement, then it
would most probably assume quite the weight of a cannon ball when
it descended on his head. In fact, Mr. Pell took a surreptitious
glance at the inside of his hat as he hung it on the peg.</p>

<p>The desk allotted to Mr. Pell was a handsome piece of
furniture. Alone in the office he examined the drawers and found
bundles of prospectuses, note heads, and envelopes. Nothing
suspicious, nothing to give him a clue to what he had come to
believe was a carefully baited trap.</p>

<p>Finally he resorted to the morning paper and waited. About ten
o'clock J.J. Smith walked in and greeted Mr. Pell
boisterously.</p>

<p>"Great man!" he chuckled. "Here as soon as his clerks. Just
the man for the company."</p>

<p>Quickly opening the letters he passed a liberal half over to
Mr. Pell. "These are yours. See! You're our publicity manager.
Interview people, and especially press men. Take that work off
me, I can't stand it. Just your line. I'm a mine man."</p>

<p>"I thought you were a sheep man." Mr. Pell could not resist
the gibe.</p>

<p>"Good for you!" J.J. was not at all abashed. "I picked up a
sheep once or twice and got a liberal portion of his fleece."</p>

<p>Once on the job Mr. Pell thoroughly enjoyed himself. J.J.
Smith did not spare him either in the work or in the matter of
publicity. He was introduced to the callers as the man who had
given Western Australia the inestimable benefit of the Great
Fallgall G. M. He was acclaimed as the discoverer. Before he
closed his desk for the day he had interviewed half-a-dozen
journalists on the finding of the mine and its entirely
fictitious presentation to the State. The morning's newspapers
promised to be interesting reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell waited anxiously for the Board meeting. It was
tolerably certain at that table something would be said, or done,
that would give him a clue to the peculiar position into which he
had been forced by J Smith. But when the Board met, and passed,
he was just as wise as ever. Two things he noted for future
reference. First that the output of the mine was abnormal, and
secondly that the Board bowed very gracefully to the opinions of
Smith. The opening of the mine with its tremendous crop of gold
bearing ore had constituted a great advertisement but in the
newspaper world all events have their allotted span.</p>

<p>When Mr. Pell came back to the Company he found that other
interests had taken the place of the 'richest mine in the State'
and that the Company was expected to pay for its advertisements
at the usual rates. Further that 'puff-pars' were at a discount.
The position in which Smith had placed Mr. Pell altered this for
some time. There was a new interest in the Mine through the
advent of the 'discoverer' on the Board. But the sensation was
only short lived and the 'puff-pars' again became hard to
get.</p>

<p>"You've got to wake it up, Pell," remarked J.J. Smith one
morning. "You've done well so far. Truly a remarkable
imagination. You should have been a novelist. But it's dying out.
One short paragraph in two days. Won't do, Pell! Won't do!"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" Mr. Pell was annoyed. "I'm not
mountebank for the Company. Do you want me to stand on my
head?"</p>

<p>&gt;Mr. Pell was annoyed. It was only rarely that he allowed
himself to descend from the niceties of speech. In fact he had
been heard to comment adversely on the new Australian language
that is coming fast to the fore.</p>

<p>"That's your funeral, Pell, my boy," serenely observed J.J.
Smith, ignoring the irritation of Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"Four days and we get our quotation. Get a big sensation to
boost the event."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell swung around to his desk and thought hard. Slowly an
idea formed in his mind. It would be a big sensation not only to
the public in general, but to Mr. J.J. Smith in particular. If
he could only work it!</p>

<p>Just before four o'clock Mr. Pell closed his desk and took
down his hat.</p>

<p>"Going early," remarked J.J. Smith. "Got that sensation?"</p>

<p>"I have an idea at the back of my mind," replied Mr. Pell
quietly. "I think, I am sure, I can promise you a considerable
sensation."</p>

<p>"Good man!" Mr. Smith resumed his usual genial manner. "Want
any cash?"</p>

<p>"A cheque might be useful."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"A couple of hundred will do."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith scribbled a cheque and passed it over. "Am I to know
the details," he enquired.</p>

<p>"Not at present," replied Mr. Pell gravely. "I should prefer
it to come as a surprise to you."</p>

<p>"All serene!" Mr. Smith was not curious. "Account for the cash
when you are ready."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell paused at the door.</p>

<p>"By-the-bye," he suggested, "what of those shares of mine. The
Director's shares you know. I suppose they are my property?"</p>

<p>"Certs, old man. You've earned them. I'll have them sent along
to your house." Mr. Pell had thought of dipping his hand into his
pocket for the surprise packet and reimbursing himself from the
Company's exchequer later. The offer of the cash and shares was
too good to be refused. Mr. Pell never ignored the small details.
Before returning home Mr. Pell sought out a friend, who had some
knowledge of mining. They had a long conversation, at the end of
which Mr. Pell felt relieved. His friend also looked happy.</p>

<p>For the next couple of days Mr. Pell avoided the streets and
instructed his landlady to inform callers that he was away in the
country. Daily he scanned the newspaper and noted the telegrams
printed from the mine manager stating the progress made and the
number of ounces to the ton the ore was giving.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day he walked into the office of
the Company and hung up his hat on the accustomed peg. J.J.
Smith was at his desk.</p>

<p>"Back again Pell," he remarked carelessly. "How's the
sensation?"</p>

<p>"Complete, Mr. Smith," replied Mr. Pell solemnly. "The mine
will be sprung tomorrow." The two gentlemen enjoyed Mr. Pell's
joke to the full. Both had a different, yet curiously similar,
construction to the double innuendo.</p>

<p>At the luncheon interval Mr. Pell interviewed his broker and
in consequence his bank balance suffered exceedingly. Later in
the afternoon Mr. Smith announced that he was called out of town
and would give full authority to Mr. Pell to act for the Company
during his absence. The papers were duly completed and Mr. Smith
took his leave, somewhat sardonically congratulating Mr. Pell on
his elevation to the honours of Managing Director. He said
something about dead men's shoes. Mr. Pell smiled. In due course
a Stock Exchange quotation was obtained throughout the
Commonwealth and reports began to flow in of the extraordinary
popularity of the mine with the investing public. Before the
close of the first day the shares were jumping to the skies. The
second day fresh reports of enormous finds on the mine were
received and published and the shares again responded.</p>

<p>The <i>Advertiser</i> the following morning, published the
first news of the greatest swindle in Western Australia. It took
the form of a telegram from an investor who was visiting the
mine. It was a long telegram, but every word was thrust at the
people who had had control of the Company. There was no gold.
There never had been any. The experts had been grossly but
cleverly deceived. The mine had been salted heavily. The progress
telegrams, faked. The whole thing was a fraud from beginning to
end.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell did not visit the offices of the Company that
day. He remained in the most rigorous retirement. Deluded
investors besieged the offices of the Company and the police had
to be called to preserve order. Late that afternoon a boy left a
letter for Mr. Pell. He stated that a gentleman who had left
Fremantle by the <i>Amoora</i> had given it to him with half a
sovereign and strict instructions to get it into Mr. Pell's hands
that day. It read&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Dear and gullible friend&mdash;<br> <br> I am
off on a little jaunt to the Old World taking with me a rather
large souvenir of my pleasant stay in Western Australia. Give my
love to all at the office and tell them not to expect me
back.<br> <br> Yours,<br> Joseph John Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell sent the letter along to the <i>Advertiser</i>,
greatly relieved. The tone of the letter was sufficient to fix
the blame on the right shoulders.</p>

<p>The downfall of the Great Fallgall G. M. Ltd was great and
complete. Many thousands of people lost their savings in the
crash. The newspaper gave a well considered opinion of what
should be done to Mr. Joseph John Smith, when he was caught. The
directors of the company hastened to explain their connection
with their late managing director, and the company, endeavouring,
with some success, to make black almost like white. And then,
like all sensations, the matter passed into oblivion.</p>

<p>A week later Mr. Pell sat in his cosy sitting room with his
bank-book on the table before him. He was taking stock of his
position.</p>

<p>"One thousand shares at one pound each fully paid up," he
murmured, "that being my director's qualification. Brown and he
bought two thousand and sold the lot at an average of £5 10s. Say
£16,000 all told. Certainly I owe thanks to my sheep friend, Mr.
Joseph John."</p>

<p>He lay back in his chair and watched the smoke of his cigar
float to the ceiling. "Take from that £500 I gave 'Johnson' for
the examination and telegraphing to the <i>Advertiser</i> and
allow the £260 Smith gave me for the working of the sensation.
Yes! I am quite satisfied."</p>

<p>And then his eyes descended to survey his beautiful new
waistcoat, home that day from the tailors. In another part of the
town a gentleman of the name of Johnson was boasting of the luck
he had had lately. A short trip to the country, first class and
all expenses, and a pile in hand on his return.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Mr. Pell as he climbed into bed that night. "I
don't think I am quite the mug my dear friend Smith thinks," and
he laughed, a comfortable self-satisfied laugh, as he arranged
himself for the sleep he had so hardly earned.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5">V. &mdash; IN PURSUIT OF
CHARITY</a></h2>

<p class="first">MR. PETER PELL was not happy and some ill-natured
person had suggested in a letter to the <i>Advertiser</i>
that he, Mr. Peter Pell, was the criminal brain that had foisted
on a too credulous public the Great Fallgall G. M. Limited. The
following day the leader writer of the <i>Advertiser</i> took up
the story and, without mentioning names, intimated to the
Government it would have a short and stormy life if 'someone' was
not immediately indicted by the grand Jury, placed in the dock
and convicted and sentenced for life, at least. The writer was
indefinite as to the charge&mdash;any old thing
probably&mdash;what was wanted was the conviction. The
Government, or rather the responsible Minister proved obdurate,
perhaps due to the fact that no General Election loomed on the
horizon.</p>

<p>On such small matters rest the life and liberty of a British
subject. Mr. Pell recognised fully the seriousness of the
accusation. His actions were always open and frank. At the outset
of the trouble he had promptly handed Mr. Joseph John Smith's
letter to the press. That his scathing comments had been
ruthlessly edited was a distinct grievance but the future
contained a more disastrous shock. His broker allowed himself to
be interviewed and that interview was honoured with triple
column-headlines. It was a fact that Mr. Pell did not intend to
deny, and indeed it would have been difficult for him to deny,
that he had made a few good thousand pounds out of the boom and
smash of Great Fallgall. That was a private matter and had
nothing to do with the newspaper reading public, and the fact
that a reputable stockbroker could so far forget professional
etiquette as to discuss a client's business, hurt and annoyed Mr.
Pell. If a man could not trust his broker who, under the moon and
stars, could he trust?</p>

<p>Pondering over the sins of his broker Mr. Pell grew indignant,
and quite forgot his own. Secure in the apathy of the Government,
for Governments in Western Australia are not to be bothered with
such trivial things as gold mining swindles, Mr. Pell was only
concerned by the slight annoyance of having to confine himself to
the house for a period. At the first he had determined to brave
public opinion and had boldly shown himself on the Terrace. From
that meeting place of business men he had been abruptly
frightened by a candid friend, who, first drawing his attention
to the article in the <i>Advertiser</i> on the Great Fallgall
Swindle, caustically enquired what Mr. Pell intended to do for
the widows and fatherless who had invested their all in the
Mine.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had, it is sad to record, lost his temper and after
consigning his interrogator to a climate that is still more
sultry than the north-west in the summertime, turned on his heel
and walked home. He had the largest sympathy for the unfortunate;
his hand was always ready with a few shillings for a published
subscription list; his ear was always open to an unfortunate
friend who had anything to say worth hearing; but for the
mendicant, amateur or professional, Mr. Pell had a most supreme
contempt and as amateur mendicants of the worst type he classed
the widow and the fatherless.</p>

<p>The widows and the fatherless had no business to invest their
savings in gold mines. They should confine their investments to
the safe Government and municipal gilt-edged stock. Gold mines
were for the speculator. Mr. Pell did not explain how the
speculator was to get on, and the gold mines also, in the event
of the widows and fatherless following his dictum. The streets of
the metropolis being made unbearable by the officiousness of
busy-bodies Mr. Pell had to confine himself to the house.</p>

<p>He was not a reading man and the only book he took any serious
interest in was his bank book. That, however satisfactory for
occasional perusal, became monotonous when the only literature
available. Newspapers were barred for, led by the bad example of
the <i>Advertiser</i>, other papers had joined in a perfect
screech for investigation.</p>

<p>There was only one consolation. Mrs. McPhee was a cook. Next
to an efficient bank accountant Mr. Pell held in highest respect
an expert cook. As it happened Mrs. McPhee filled the bill to a
nicety. Her entrées were things of beauty, while her sweets were
dreams of delight. For a week Mr. Pell worked steadily through
Mrs. McPhee's repertoire, and then felt he needed exercise.</p>

<p>So far in this history of Mr. Peter Pell his landlady, Mrs.
McPhee, has appeared only as a shadow, a mere background to the
home life of the most remarkable man who ever appeared on the
business horizon of Perth. Recognised as a cook, <i>par
excellence</i>, by Mr. Pell it is but right she should evolve
from the shadowy background and take her rightful place in the
limelight. Mrs. McPhee was not tall, in fact, she was distinctly
short. She did not possess a fine figure. On the contrary she and
her corsetiere had considerable difficulty with a figure that
distinctly inclined to grow out of hand. But above shortness and
<i>embonpoint</i> showed a countenance ruddy and joyful. Her
thick black hair, her smiling brown eyes, her cupid bow of a
mouth all combined to establish a youthful and pleasing
personality. Mrs. McPhee was not young. Youth had been left
behind with care, and a past husband. Mrs. McPhee was
"unattached." She had neither husband or child.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had sat down to his midday meal with a frown on his
brow. He had spent the interval since breakfast gazing out of his
sitting room window with his thumbs twiddling behind his back. It
is an amusement that is likely to pall on the more stolid
individual. Mr. Pell had welcomed the arrival of Mrs. McPhee with
the dishes. Here, at all events, was a business he understood.
After a successful foray on the specimens of Mrs. McPhee's
culinary skill submitted to him, Mr. Pell thought he might be
able to glance through the morning paper. Lighting a fat cigar he
drew an easy chair to the window and opened the newspaper. The
first thing his eyes lit upon were the headlines:</p>

<p class="newspaper">GREAT FALLGALL SCANDAL.<br> SHOULD PELL BE
PROSECUTED</p>

<p>"Where is Charity?" roared Mr. Pell, flinging the newspaper
across the room.</p>

<p>"Law, Mr. Pell!" exclaimed Mrs. McPhee. "You put me all of a
tremble.'</p>

<p>"Is there no Charity in this State?" continued Mr. Pell,
rising to his feet and striding up and down the room.</p>

<p>"I'm sure there is, sir," replied the widow with a deep sigh.
"But gentlemen won't look for it."</p>

<p>"Is there no Charity in Perth?" continued the frenzied man.
"Am I to be hunted from pillar to post by a lot of benighted
asses who don't know a cow from a crocodile?"</p>

<p>"Or a mine from a swindle," suggested the lady softly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" Mr. Pell swung round on his
landlady with an awe-inspiring frown.</p>

<p>"Law, sir, don't take on so. I didn't mean anything. I was
only thinking of the few shares I held."</p>

<p>"Shares in what?" There was anxiety in the manner in which Mr.
Pell asked the question.</p>

<p>"The Great Fallgall, sir," the landlady faltered. "I bought a
few shares."</p>

<p>"Good God!" Mr. Pell strode to the window. "Am I never to get
away from that accursed mine?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have told you sir, but you asked." The widow was
almost in tears. She had a great admiration for her lodger. "I'm
sure I'm not complaining."</p>

<p>"What on earth induced you to buy those things?"</p>

<p>"I saw the prospectus thing on your table, and&mdash;and it
looked&mdash;so nice." The lady was now in open tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell could bear no more. Rushing from the room he seized a
hat and went out into the streets. Instinctively he turned in the
direction of the city and then stopped. It would be extremely
injudicious in the present state of public excitement to show
himself there. Turning hastily his eyes fell on a poster.</p>

<p class="newspaper">GRAND CHARITY CONCERT</p>

<p>Charity! was there such a thing? It was all very well to get
up concerts in the name of Charity. It was a good thing to
subscribe to Charity lists that would eventually find their way
into print. But was there such a thing? Was it Charity to hound a
man in the manner in which he, Peter Pell, was being hounded? Was
it Charity to organise something to show somebody how well a
person could do something which someone else could not do? Was it
Charity to drive a man away from his occupation&mdash;from his
accustomed haunts? Charity! There was no such thing!</p>

<p>For some moments the idea possessed Mr. Pell to go the
<i>Advertiser</i> Office and fling on the editorial desk a cheque
for the total sum he had made by his deals in Great Fallgalls. It
would be a sensation. The newspaper could not but publish the
fact, and it would be surely credited to him for virtue.
But&mdash;and Mr. Pell's capable business mind saw plainly the
but&mdash;would it not be a confession of weakness? Would it not
be a confession of culpability?</p>

<p>No! He could not do that. Besides, the money was rightfully
his, the product of his business capabilities.</p>

<p>"If you please sir, will you buy a ticket for the concert?" It
was a small piping voice that came from well below the region of
the resplendent waistcoat. Mr. Pell looked down on a little girl
in a very dirty frock, that wonderfully matched her face.</p>

<p>"It's for charity," continued the child. Flinging the first
coin his fingers met to the child, Mr. Pell fled. Had the whole
world combined to haunt him with the word 'Charity'? He had asked
if there was such a thing, and at his feet had risen a dirty
child with the word on her lips.</p>

<p>The fresh air and sunshine in time restored Mr. Pell to his
accustomed geniality. He had a most enjoyable walk through the
park and, incidentally, picked up a fine appetite. After all the
world was not so bad a place. The <i>Advertiser</i> was certainly
a bore, but Mr. Pell recognised that newspapers, like other
people, had a living to get, and the newspaper's way, lamentably,
was by the dissemination of sensation. Joseph John Smith was the
real culprit. One day that fact would be patent to the world and
he, Peter Pell, would stand out as the innocent victim he knew
himself to be.</p>

<p>Walking home Mr. Pell ruminated on the possible menu for
dinner. That Mrs. McPhee would excel her previous efforts he
thought possible. At times in their intercourse there had been
differences of opinion and Mr. Pell had realised that Mrs. McPhee
usually composed something choice in the way of a meal as a sort
of peace-offering.</p>

<p><i>"Piper! Evenin' piper! Hall abart the Great Fallgall
Swindle! 'Ere yer are, sir. Piper!"</i></p>

<p>It was a shock-headed urchin that thrust the evening newspaper
under his nose. Mechanically Mr. Pell bought one. It was but a
repetition of the previous articles attacking the late management
of the mine and demanding, with the utmost frenzy, the immediate
hanging of all concerned, from the office-boy upwards. Mr. Pell
heaved a sigh of relief. From the headlines he had expected
something much worse.</p>

<p>As he had expected, Mrs. McPhee had composed something tasty
for his dinner. It took the form of a new entrée. Something
altogether different from what the lady had attempted in the
past. It was a success and Mr. Pell's expressions of delight and
approval were reflected in the beaming face of the lady. A good
dinner leads to reflection. Mr. Pell had, during the repast,
forgotten all about the Great Fallgall but, seated in an easy
chair with one of his pet cigars between his lips, his thoughts
wandered back to the mine and the annoyance it was causing him.
Reflection bred a desire for sympathy, and the advent of Mrs.
McPhee to clear away the dinner things gave the necessary
sympathiser.</p>

<p>"I must look into that matter of your shares, Mrs. McPhee,"
commenced Mr. Pell in a patronising manner.</p>

<p>"Law, sir!" The lady was visibly affected. "I don't think
there is much that even you could do, sir."</p>

<p>The 'even' appealed to Mr. Pell most forcibly. It was a great
thing to be a hero to somebody, even if that somebody be but the
landlady.</p>

<p>"I must look into the matter," repeated Mr. Pell. "Bring me
the papers."</p>

<p>Obediently Mrs. McPhee left the room and returned with a long
envelope bulging with script. Mr. Pell eyed it with some
disfavour. The few shares appeared to have multiplied
considerably.</p>

<p>"Humph!" murmured Mr. Pell, casting over the documents with a
practised hand while Mrs. McPhee stood at one side gazing at the
back of his head, admiringly.</p>

<p>"About £150 at par it appears to me."</p>

<p>"One hundred and seventy-nine pounds," corrected the widow
gently. "I bought on the rise."</p>

<p>"Humph!" Mr. Pell tried not to look annoyed. What on earth did
the silly woman want to buy shares above par for. "Of course you
know what they are worth now?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Advertiser</i> says, nothing." The lady was visibly on
the point of tears.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" Mr. Pell had recovered his composure. "The
<i>Advertiser</i> does not know everything."</p>

<p>Now this was a distinct libel on a reputable newspaper. Mr.
Pell knew that the script was not worth the paper it was written
on, but he had a distinct object in view in encouraging Mrs.
McPhee. It had come into his mind to perform a charitable action.
Not that he looked at it in that light, for at that moment the
mention of the word charity would have driven him into the use of
strenuous and much-to-be-regretted language.</p>

<p>He intended to take over the shares himself. At par,
certainly, for he did not believe in encouraging other people to
buy shares at any inflated value. Besides, the speculation, if it
may be so called, was likely to lead to immediate personal
benefit. Mrs. McPhee believed that the shares were worthless, and
the action of her star border in retrieving the better part of
their value from the wreck would certainly lead to preferential
treatment in the matter of dainty viands.</p>

<p>"Leave these with me, Mrs. McPhee," he exclaimed in his most
impressive tones. "I will see what I can do."</p>

<p>His kindness so impressed the lady that she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"Oh sir!" she sobbed, with so distinct an inclination to rest
her raven tresses on the radiant waistcoat of Mr. Pell, that that
gentleman retreated hastily to the other side of the room. "Oh,
sir, it was my all. If you can do anything it will be a real act
of charity."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell jumped as if a cartridge had exploded at his feet.
Charity! Again that abominable assertion. For the moment he was
almost inclined to return the package of script to Mrs. McPhee.
Instead he reasoned with her.</p>

<p>"Surely, ma'am you don't believe in any such thing." He tried
to speak in a tone of withering scorn.</p>

<p>Now the man who attempts to reason with women is lost, wholly
and utterly. It must have been a moment of mental aberration on
the part of Mr. Pell that induced him to attempt a thing, that
philosophers from the beginning of the world have claimed to be
impossible. Even Adam refrained to reason with Eve&mdash;he ate
the apple.</p>

<p>"I don't care what you call it," replied the lady vigorously,
drying her tears with the end of her apron. "It's a true act of
charity on your part, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here her emotion overcame her again.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell became dogmatic. "I tell you there is no such thing
as charity."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, sir, I wouldn't like to believe that."</p>

<p>The lady was not going to directly oppose Mr. Pell. Women for
some reason always prefer the oblique course in an argument with
the "stronger" sex.</p>

<p>"There's something I call charity, if you don't. Why even
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mr. Pell interrupted. Had he heard the end of Mrs.
McPhee's sentence he might have been convinced of the existence
of charity in its most acute form&mdash;and this tale would never
have been written.</p>

<p>"Charity! Charity!" Mr. Pell had forgotten his landlady and
was lost in a reverie. His gigantic mind had fastened, not on the
word, but on the thing that the word so much misrepresented.</p>

<p>"Is it charitable to give? Is it charitable to relieve? Yes,
that is charity, but not the charity that the world knows.
Charity is a godlike attribute. It is the highest form of
self-sacrifice. It is that which would bind the whole world
together in one great human brotherhood, if the people would only
accept the true and inner meaning of charity. There would be no
war, no more misery. There would be no more harping and carping in
business. Every man would be honest and upright with his
neighbours. There would be no more swindling&mdash;"</p>

<p>And there Mr. Pell stopped for he suddenly realised that his
train of thought, if carried to logical conclusion, would mean
there would be no more gold mines.</p>

<p>"Law, sir!" The widow was listening admiringly to her boarder
"Law sir, you do talk fine. That's just what I think about
it."</p>

<p>"Charity is the highest of the Graces." Mr. Pell was far away
and did not realise the presence of the widow. He had once
belonged to a debating Society and had at times flights of
eloquence that look him far from all mundane affairs. "Charity!
Ah, if I could only teach this world to see Charity as I see it,
what a different place it would be. Gone would be kings and
priests. Uplifted on the altars of the world would be Charity,
the Queen. She would reign in all hearts as now she reigns in
mine. Charity, true Charity! I dream of Charity, I adore her.
What is the world, if but Charity be mine?"</p>

<p>From his reverie Mr. Pell was startled by a pair of firm plump
arms creeping up around his neck.</p>

<p>Startled, he looked down and saw his landlady's head resting
securely on his handsome waistcoat. Instinctively his arms
closed&mdash;with the lady inside.</p>

<p>"Oh, how beautifully you talk. And it's all so true," a voice
murmured softly. "Charity is yours, only yours."</p>

<p>"What on earth's the matter, ma'am?" Mr. Pell was shocked and
distressed.</p>

<p>Mrs. McPhee looked up into his eyes, a carmine blush spread
over her cheeks.</p>

<p>"My name's Charity," she said slowly and distinctly. Even then
Mr. Pell did not realise to what he had committed himself, before
the effect of her last word could penetrate the befogged
brain.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pell&mdash;" the widow's face was again nestling against
his waistcoat, and a soft whisper floated to his ears. "Oh
Peter&mdash;dear!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6">VI. &mdash; IN PURSUIT OF THE LAST
CHANCE</a></h2>

<p class="first">AN old adage formulates that marriage is a
lottery. There should be a statement from some great authority
that, however much of a lottery marriage may be, engagements for
the matrimonial stakes are sheer gambles.</p>

<p>Marriage may assume, at some time or another, the form of a
lottery but the engagement which precedes matrimony, and,
presumably, is entered into for the purpose of allowing the
parties to intimately understand each other, is nothing but a
gigantic gamble that should be put down ruthlessly by the police.
Such thoughts must have crossed the mind of Mr. Pell when, after
an impressive monologue on the beauties of an abstract Charity,
he found himself matrimonially engaged to a human "Charity," and
it was not very long before Mr. Pell began to look on the
interlude in the real light of a Charity. He was performing a
charitable act and his landlady Mrs. Charity McPhee was the
object.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had no objection to matrimony in the abstract. More,
he had seriously meditated the step in regard to a certain
fascinating widow. Some casual people might say that matrimony is
the fact and the life-partner but the incident. Mr. Pell thought
not. He had fixed and firm beliefs, on the distinct equality in
the matrimonial state. Both parties should start on a distinct
equality in the stakes, financial and otherwise.</p>

<p>In this engagement to which he was committed, he was
distinctly handicapped. Mr. Pell had the cash, several, thousands
of it, and the lady had nothing. Had he been allowed time to
think it is probable Mr. Pell would have removed himself, and his
belongings from temptation. But the lady was wise and, having her
bird in hand, proceeded to place him in the cage of
publicity.</p>

<p>Within an hour Mr. Pell had received the congratulations of
half a dozen neighbours. Not yet recovered from the surprise of
the unexpected acceptance of his unguarded semi-proposal, Mr.
Pell did not repudiate the suggestion. His fate was thus sealed.
Mrs. McPhee and her friends settled down to a discussion of the
bridal trousseau and the wedding, Mr. Pell was not consulted. His
was to pay the piper, and the lady knew his means to the last
penny.</p>

<p>Lengthy meditation caused Mr. Pell to accept the situation with
equanimity. He realised he had been caught and, as a man, he must
make the best of a bad case. With these thoughts in his mind he
surveyed Mrs. McPhee not as a landlady to minister to his
comforts, as she had in the past, but as the future Mrs. Pell,
who would minister to his comforts, if it suited her purpose and
her engagements permitted. Though not so fine a figure of a woman
as Widow Pascoe Mr. Pell had to admit that the lady of his choice
(?) might fill the bill.</p>

<p>After a plea for a quiet wedding, and a protest against the
costly wedding premeditated by the bride and her friends, Mr.
Pell turned his thoughts to business as a distraction. Here he
was confronted by the lady with arbitrary restrictions.</p>

<p>After laying down the proposition that Mr. Pell's capital
property invested, would bring in an income of nearly £1000 per
annum the lady conceded that a man had to have an occupation. In
the search for that occupation Mr. Pell was given a free hand,
subject to the conditions:</p>

<p>(1) It should not be connected with gold mining, (2) that the
speculative element should be non-existent, (3) that it must
produce the greatest revenue possible; (4) that the capital
required should be small.</p>

<p>None of these conditions met with Mr. Pell's approval. His
adventures in the realms of commerce had been tinged with the
spirit of adventure. He had the gamblers faith in his luck and in
making a deal he liked to throw his all in the scale, win or
lose. The lady was obdurate but after some argument a compromise
was effected. Mr. Pell was to be allowed a last flutter to the
limit of £1000.</p>

<p>The chains had begun to gall and Mr. Pell would no doubt have
taken a long fond farewell of the lady and Western Australia, if
a brilliant business coup had not occurred to him. Parrying a
suggestion that his bank balance, with the exception of the £1000
should be transferred to Mrs. McPhee for safekeeping, and giving
his solemn word for the due execution of the compact, Mr. Pell
arrayed himself for a fresh appearance in the commercial centre
of the State.</p>

<p>In the course of his wanderings, in his pre-financial days,
Mr. Pell had discovered a tract of land on the South side of the
River Swan, suitable in every respect for a residential suburb.
Enterprising builders and land agents had somehow overlooked the
possibilities of the spot and it remained, until Mr. Pell took
his final flutter, a beautiful wilderness, awaiting but the hand
of a speculative magician to become a new adornment of the City
Beautiful&mdash;Perth.</p>

<p>Now, brought by matrimonial fate to his last flutter, Mr. Pell
bethought him of this land of promise. Here was a chance to make
or lose a fortune. Either way he profited. If his venture was a
success he would not care whether he was married or not. He would
have enough money, as more fortunate brethren, to ignore the
matrimonial shackles and live a gay grass-bachelor existence. If
the scheme was a failure, then it was more probable Mrs. McPhee
would accord him his release from the entanglement&mdash;for Mr.
Pell had no intention of limiting his speculation to a bare
£1000. It was his last gamble and it should be memorable.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was not cordially welcomed at the offices of Messrs
Stack &amp; Co., the noted land and estate agents. The memory of
the Great Fallgall still hung over him, but money talks, and when
Mr. Stack, to whom, after some waiting Mr. Pell found his way,
realised that his visitor was inclined to burn money, his
attitude changed abruptly, and a few cordial words of sympathy
were uttered, that fell like balsam on the sensitive heart of Mr.
Pell.</p>

<p>For a few hundreds, Mr. Pell obtained an option for three
months over a thousand acres of what Mr. Stack described as first
class agricultural land known as the Quicksands Bay Estate, with
a frontage of nearly a mile and a half on the River Swan! Mr.
Stack was quite content with his bargain, and wondered why a man
of Mr. Pell's history should think stock raising could be
profitably carried on there, for that was the excuse Mr. Pell
gave for his desire to purchase the ground. Considering the
matter later, he was distressed at the poorness of the excuse and
the gullibility of Mr. Stack. Still the deal had been completed,
and for three months Mr. Pell was the sole owner. Mentally, he
registered a resolution to frame his excuses in better style in
the future.</p>

<p>Leaving Mr. Stack's palatial offices Mr. Pell ran into the
arms of a reporter of the <i>Advertiser</i>. For the moment he
was inclined to ignore the man, but journalists are people with
terrifically hard hides.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pell! How goes it?"</p>

<p>"Sir!" Mr. Pell appeared to swell with indignation as he
loomed over the journalist, who was a comparatively small
man.</p>

<p>"Oh, chuck it, Pell. I'm Smithers of the <i>Advertiser</i>,
you know. Not going to cut me?"</p>

<p>"If I do my duty I should do more than cut you," replied Mr.
Pell majestically. "I know you, Mr. Smithers, quite well, and your
paper too."</p>

<p>"Oh that's it, is it? Sore over the Great Fallgall. Come out
of it, Pell. It was all business. You shouldn't bear malice. Come
along and stand us a drink." It is a peculiarity of the
journalistic profession that the members have a rooted dislike to
standing drinks.</p>

<p>It was an axiom of Mr. Pell that the press can do no wrong.
This in general. In the matter of the Great Fallgall Mr. Pell was
convinced that the <i>Advertiser</i> had made a mistake, and that
Mr. Smithers, now realising it, was making advances to a more
friendly footing. Even the optimism of Mr. Pell did not go so far
as to imagine that a newspaper could afford to acknowledge a
mistake. Accepting the olive branch held out, Mr. Pell followed
his friend to a select corner in the American Bar of the Palace
Hotel, and nobly ordered two of the most expensive and bizarre
drinks on the menu.</p>

<p>Accepting one of Mr. Pell's best cigars, Mr. Smithers opened
the ball.</p>

<p>"What's the game now, Pell?"</p>

<p>"There is no game, Mr. Smithers. All my transactions are
legitimate business."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers closed one eye gently.</p>

<p>"Well what's the business?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell's gigantic brain worked swiftly. As a flash of light
he saw his way to some fine advertising. Dropping his air of
reserve he leaned across the table and opened his heart to the
journalist.</p>

<p>"It's the best speculation I have ever been connected with, my
boy," he concluded. "I will make the finest Garden Suburb on the
continent. A casino in the gardens on the river front with bands,
afternoon and evening. Mixed bathing, too, and large roomy lots
for building. The finest and most elegant residential area in the
world."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers took it all in with half closed eyes. When Mr.
Pell had finished he looked up and said with childlike
simplicity:</p>

<p>"Where's the swindle?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was disgusted. Human nature was framed on a peculiar
plan, when a journalist of one of the leading newspapers in the
Commonwealth could not distinguish between a first class business
proposition and a swindle. Very carefully he went over all the
points again. At the conclusion of the recital Mr. Smithers rose
and shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>"You're a credit to the State, Pell," he said warmly. "That's
if you succeed in keeping out of the House on the Hill at
Fremantle."</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Pell found the success of his endeavours
in the <i>Advertiser</i>. The article was not
complimentary&mdash;far from it. The word "swindle" was not
mentioned. The facts of Mr. Pell's new speculation were set out
with utmost fairness. The Great Fallgall was rather stressed, and
Mr. Pell's connection with that unfortunate mine mentioned with
more frequency than that gentleman thought decent. The whole
article denounced the new suburb as a swindle, without saying so
in definite terms, and inferred that the public would do well to
stand out of the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was pleased. Had the <i>Advertiser</i> ignored the
speculation or damned it with faint praise, he would have been
seriously distressed. The public is a curious animal, and
delights in something grossly irregular. The <i>Advertiser</i>
had roused curiosity and Mr. Pell prepared to reap the harvest.
For the next, two weeks he was one of the most occupied men in
the city.</p>

<p>"The Quicksands Bay Garden Suburb, Ltd." occupied a suite of
first class offices on the Terrace. The plate glass doors swung
open to vast mahogany counters, where busy clerks met enquirers
with smiling courtesy. Advertisements of "The Suburb," profusely
illustrated, appeared in all the newspapers and journals, not
excepting the <i>Advertiser</i>. Mr. Pell had offered that
newspaper the pick of the advertising, and the advertising
manager had accepted gladly.</p>

<p>Yet the attacks on Mr. Pell and the Suburb continued, although
carefully disguised. The public, however, came with a rush.</p>

<p>"Gosh, Pell!" exclaimed Mr. Smithers one afternoon standing at
the door of the manager's room of the Garden Suburb and watching
the crowd at the counters. "I'm beginning to think this isn't so
much of a swindle, after all."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell walked to a large map of the estate and placed his
finger on one of the best building sites on the estate.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smithers!" he said solemnly, "If this is a swindle that
building block is yours."</p>

<p>"What's the price, old man?" Mr. Smithers was not a suckling
journalist.</p>

<p>"Not a penny," replied Mr. Pell. "I'll give orders for the
transfer to you straight away, and if at the end of six months
you have not proved the Garden Suburb a swindle, you retransfer
to me or pay me the listed price for the ground."</p>

<p>The journalist walked out of the offices thinking hard. Either
the gift of the land was an attempt to bribe him or his
preconceived opinion of Mr. Pell's business rectitude radically
wrong. Anyway he stood to lose nothing, and if he could prove his
newspaper's theory he would be the better by a valuable piece of
land.</p>

<p>Mr. Stack was another person who had his doubts of Mr. Pell.
The consideration for the option offered to him had been
tempting, but he considered he had been grossly deceived in the
preliminaries of the negotiations. Mr. Pell had not distinctly
stated, but he had fully inferred, that the object of the option
was some fantastic theory of bringing cattle to the outskirts of
the city and then fattening them.</p>

<p>Mr. Stack had thought the idea absurd, but that had not
deterred him from accepting the sum offered for the option. Now
that that the Quicksands Bay Garden Estate, Ltd., was a going
concern and likely to make the promoter rich, Mr. Stack felt that
he had been swindled. He looked at his option contract carefully
to discover if he had any remedy, but there was none. Mr. Pell
had been careful not to commit himself, and until the three
months expired and Mr. Pell made default in the purchase, Mr.
Stack could not interfere. Yet there might be other ways.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the second month, Mr. Pell considered the
balance sheet with satisfaction. The sales were decidedly large,
and if they continued to increase at the same rate at the
expiration of his option, he would have considerably more than
the purchase money, and the prospects of a fine estate to be sold
later at greatly enhanced prices.</p>

<p>He was not worried about the option. That document had been of
his own drafting and cast iron so far as his right to dispose of
the land in sections. His bank balance showed the necessary money
on deposit to cover the sales and the surveying of the estate and
preliminary road work fully covered the necessary improvements he
had undertaken to perform.</p>

<p>Yet at the back of Mr. Pell's brain there was some
dissatisfaction. He liked quick money, and the Quicksands Bay
Estate did not promise that. Certainly it was good money and
sure, but when the purchase money had been paid, he would have
little more than his original capital, plus of course, a great
deal of fairly valuable land. It might be years before he could
dispose of the surplus. Mr. Pell had no idea of waiting years for
anything. It was necessary to stimulate sales. But how?</p>

<p>Quicksands Bay lay on the south side of the River Swan. There
had been some talk in the past of a circular tram route from
Perth through Fremantle, taking in both sides of the river. If
this came about, the tramline must pass through Quicksands Bay
Estate. That would serve to accelerate the sales, but that was
not enough.</p>

<p>For some time Mr. Pell thought of applying to his friend
Smithers of the <i>Advertiser</i> for assistance. That newspaper
had been considerably less violent in its attitude to the Estate,
and once or twice almost complimentary. Still it was suspicious
and it would not do to rouse its latent antagonism. No! The
<i>Advertiser</i> was outside the range of practical
assistance.</p>

<p>When, where, and how the brilliant idea first occurred to Mr.
Pell, it is difficult to say. Mr. Pell was always very reticent
on the point. In fact he declaims any interest in the matter. To
his friend Smithers of the <i>Advertiser</i> he stoutly declared
he had nothing to do with it. That was a denial that did him
credit but few people were convinced by his assurance. From all
that appeared in the press, the sole rights to the idea were
vested in the Hon. Marmaduke Ibbetson, M.L.C, and that gifted
legislator had not yet issued his official denial.</p>

<p>Briefly, the Hon. gentleman, speaking in the House on a vote
of censure on the then Government, stated that the pre-election
promises of the Hon. the Minister for Home Affairs had not been
fulfilled. That gentleman had promised much when seeking election
on the south side of the Swan. He had promised bridges and
ferries and they had not happened along. He had promised
tramways, and even a railway, and, although he had been in office
over six months, there was not even a survey peg driven, or even
cut.</p>

<p>The Hon. Marmaduke Ibbetson was a large landowner on the south
side of the river, and felt deeply for the electors. That feeling
he impressively conveyed in his speech. He went further. He
advised the electors to act for themselves, and he would block
the Government in the prosecution of their "Traffic Monopoly
Act."</p>

<p>Speeches made in the heated atmosphere of the House during a
'No Confidence' debate should not be taken too seriously. Houses
of Parliament are not, nowadays, to be taken seriously. They are
there to govern the whole country, not a part of it, and when the
people of the Southern Swan electorate held an indignation
meeting in support of their eminent fellow elector and
representative they seriously embarrassed that gentleman.</p>

<p>"Holy Jehosaphat!" he exclaimed to a sympathetic fellow
Honourable. "Did the idiots think I meant every word I said?"</p>

<p>The 'idiots' evidently did. Another indignation meeting was
held and the various suburbs placarded with bills voicing the
grievances of the Southern Swanites against the Government. The
eminent legislator was invited to air his views on the
indignation platform and did not see his way to refuse. A Company
named "The Southern Railway, Tramway and Ferry Company, Limited,"
was formed and registered and the Hon. Legislator invited to take
up shares and the Chairmanship of the Board.</p>

<p>Again he did not see his way to refuse. A deputation waited on
him at Parliament House and requested him to join a syndicate for
the establishment of gas and electric light works in the
electorate and the consequent independence of the electorate of
the City and Government supplies. A few more ardent spirits
considered the formation of the total separation of the Southern
Swan Electorate from rest of the State and its proclamation as a
separate State of the Commonwealth, with a strong hint to the
Commonwealth Authorities to mind their "p's and q's" or there
might be a formal secession from the Commonwealth on the part of
the electorate and the formation of a Republic with the Hon.
Marmaduke Ibbetson as first and perpetual President. At the end
of the week the Hon. Legislator took to his bed with a severe
attack of something catching, and issued medical bulletins.</p>

<p>There are ill-natured people that affirm, in spite of repeated
denials, that Mr. Pell found the money to finance the various
Southern Swan movements. That Mr. Pell benefited considerably by
the agitation is not to be denied. He does not deny it himself,
but that he was interested other than in a purely commercial
manner he insistently denies. He has emphatically declared that
the sole cause of the agitation was the careless promises of the
Member of the Constituency.</p>

<p>The member for Southern Swan introduced into the Assembly a
Bill to provide for a tramline from Fremantle to South Perth
Point. There was little opposition in the House. All the
opposition came from the Electorate. The electors demanded a
railway. Here Mr. Pell made his first mistake. He offered the
S.S.R.T. and F.P.Co., Ltd the necessary ground through the
Quicksands Bay Estate. Immediately there was a howl of
indignation from the people on the Northern Bank of the Swan.
They had a railway from Perth to Fremantle. It was at the service
of the Southern Swan electors and others at the exact equality of
fares and accommodation as provided for the Northern Swan
inhabitants. All the Southern Swanites had to do was to cross the
present Government Ferry, take a tram to the station and pay
their fares. It was not more than double the distance as the crow
flies and only took about three times as long as a railway from
South Perth to Fremantle direct would take. What more could they
want? Besides the Transcontinental Railway was under way and with
the present labour conditions would probably be of use to the
next or the following generation.</p>

<p>The Southern Swanites retaliated. They would have a railway of
their own or die in the attempt. Capital was raised and a Bill
promoted in Parliament. After some hesitation the
<i>Advertiser</i> joined hands with the Southern Swanites.
Immediately its circulation increased by leaps and bounds. An
<i>Advertiser</i> Promotion Association was added to the many
Societies and Associations in existence in Southern Swan, and the
newsagents who sold other Perth dailies were strictly boycotted.
A deputation waited on the management of the <i>Advertiser</i> to
request that the offices and works of that journal were
immediately removed to the southern side of the river.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell here made his second mistake. He offered the
<i>Advertiser</i> the necessary land free of charge. In spite of
the opposition of the Government the 'Southern Swan Railway Bill'
passed its first and second readings in the Assembly. Supporters
of the Bill declared the matter accomplished, and eagerly bought
up all the land available on the line of the railway. Speculators
were many and active.</p>

<p>Throughout the Southern Swan boom Mr. Stack had watched the
progress of the Quicksand Bay Estate carefully and jealously. At
times he had made tentative offers to Mr. Pell to sell out to him
at a reasonable figure. Mr. Pell declined and raised the price of
all land fifty percent, and declared he would only sell to
selected buyers. He was endeavouring to found a select suburb,
and he would keep the suburb select if he did not sell another
lot.</p>

<p>It was toward the end of the third month that Mr. Stack
decided to take action. Within a week Mr. Pell would have to pay
him the agreed price of the estate, and Mr. Stack knew that not
half of the lots were sold. Enquiries through his bank informed
him that Mr. Pell had the money ready, but Mr. Stack wanted the
land not the money. With a great show of carelessness he invaded
Mr. Pell's offices. There was little show of business, and a
great placard faced the public door:</p>

<p class="newspaper">All Applications for Land<br> Must be made
in Writing.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was seated in his office with his feet up on a chair.
He welcomed Mr. Stack with a curt nod. Mr. Stack accepted a chair
and a cigar, and cast about for a suitable opening. Mr. Pell,
disdaining diplomacy, came to the point.</p>

<p>"Come for your money, Stack?"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;er&mdash;not exactly. It's not due until next
week."</p>

<p>"It'll be paid." Mr. Pell was inclined to be short with his
visitor.</p>

<p>"I know that." Mr. Stack found it more difficult than he
imagine to frame what he wished to say.</p>

<p>"Want any land?" Mr. Pell knew what was on his visitor's mind
and had no intention of blocking the matter.</p>

<p>"If you have any." Mr. Stack was eager now. "Look here, Pell,
why not let me in this deal? You've made a pile and you can't get
off the remainder. I can."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell surveyed the Land Agent with a smile.</p>

<p>"I want my prick for the remainder of the lots, Stack," he
observed. "I'm prepared to hold until I get it."</p>

<p>"I'll give you ten thousand pounds for the remainder of the
lots. Is it a deal?"</p>

<p>For some moments Pell remained silent. The offer would give
him a satisfactory profit, but not what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Look here, Stack. I'm not dealing, that's plain. But for your
offer I'll give you some information. The whole caboodle's
gone."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Mr. Stack gaped his astonishment. "You've
sold it?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," Mr. Pell leaned forward and placed his large
hand on the others knee. "Atkins, Mulberry and Co. have taken an
option of the remaining lots and will open sale next week. That's
why I can't deal with you."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Mr. Stack showed his disappointment plainly.</p>

<p>"They're selling cheap," Mr. Pell continued, "and any
applicants from this office have first option. That's why I've
closed down counter work. How many do you want? Up to a hundred
on this form," and Mr. Pell placed an application form under his
visitor's nose.</p>

<p>"What's the price?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell whispered in the Agent's ear. Mr. Stack was
astonished. Eagerly he seized a pen and filled in the form.
Passing through the outer office Mr. Stack noticed a clerk who
had once been in his employ. Drawing him to the end of the
counter Mr. Stack engaged him in a short conversation. At the
conclusion, the clerk handed Mr. Stack a bundle of papers and
received certain papers in exchange.</p>

<p>The sale of the balance of the Quicksands Bay Estate by
Messrs' Atkins, Mulberry &amp; Co. opened on the following
Monday, and within a few hours they were sold out.</p>

<p>On the following day Messrs Stack offered by auction a large
number of lots acquired by the firm. Most of these were choice
lots and bidding was brisk. Reckoning up the results Mr. Stack
rubbed his hands gleefully. It was a stupendous profit. Arriving
at the office the next morning Mr. Stack found awaiting him among
his correspondence the following letter from Messrs Atkins,
Mulberry &amp; Co.</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Sir.<br> <br> We have pleasure in advising
you that on your application 1034, countersigned by Mr. Pell, we
have allotted you the blocks applied for, and transfer will be
made to you as soon as possible. There will be a slight delay
owing to the great number of transfers to complete and we ask
your kind indulgence.<br> <br> In the matter of your other
application, we regret to say that as these forms were not
countersigned by Mr. Pell, we are unable to make any allotments,
applications prior to yours having preference.<br> <br> Yours
faithfully,<br> Atkins, Mulberry &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Filled with righteous indignation Mr. Stack seized his hat and
made for Mr. Pell's office. That gentleman welcomed him
effusively.</p>

<p>"One of the best of deals, Stack!" he exclaimed, shaking hands
vigorously, "We sold out within an hour and lots of applications
in hand. You got your applications all right? Good! How did the
sale go?"</p>

<p>"Good." Mr. Stack tried to smile cheerfully. "The fact is,
Pell, I'm in a slight difficulty and I know you will help me out.
Our auctioneer was&mdash;er&mdash;carried away by his success and
oversold us. You can let me have a few to help me out."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell closed one eye slowly.</p>

<p>"Naughty?" he exclaimed, wagging a roguish finger at his
friend. "I'm afraid you're nipped, Stack."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you'll help me out." There was bravery in the smile
that met Mr. Pell's.</p>

<p>"Absolutely impossible, old man." Mr. Pell was definite. "I
have only one block to my name, and that the wife and I intend to
live on. Can you recommend me to a good architect?"</p>

<p>It is worthy of record that Mr. Stack's great abilities,
pulled him through. It was a costly business and deep in his
heart there was a suspicion that Mr. Pell knew more than he would
say.</p>

<p>Some days later, at the Palace Hotel corner of the Terrace,
Mr. Pell ran into his friend, Mr. Smithers, of the
<i>Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>"Say, Pell," exclaimed the journalist woefully. "About that
block of land. Suppose I shall have to transfer to you now."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell took the journalist's arm gently and led him to the
reviving department.</p>

<p>"Don't think of it, my boy," he whispered. "Keep the lot with
my blessing."</p>

<p>"Then it was a swindle!"</p>

<p>There was hope in Smithers' voice.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied Pell hopefully, "But one man did get
caught, and badly, too."</p>

<p>At home that evening Mr. Pell made some rapid calculations and
then informed his bride-to-be of the result.</p>

<p>"Live on the interest of £50,000," exclaimed the lady, "Of
course we can, and well, at that. Law, Peter, you are smart," and
graciously she bestowed on her Pell the caress of reward.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7">VII. &mdash; IN PURSUIT OF
GLORY</a></h2>

<p class="first">WITH a modest fortune to his credit Mr. Pell
retired from business and became a gentleman, in contradiction to
the accepted dictum that three generations are necessary for the
transformation. He married, and erected for himself, in a select
position on the Quicksand's Bay Estate, a residence suitable for
his new position. The late Mrs. McPhee, landlady without
encumbrances, blossomed forth as Mrs. Peter Pell, wife of the
eminent financier and founder of the Quicksands Bay Estate.</p>

<p>For occupation Mr. Pell threw all the energies that had raised
him to his present eminent position, into local affairs. He
became an active member of the progress Association and a
presumptive member of the Quicksands Bay Municipal Council, when
that body was formed. He was a keen supporter of local charities
and was on the Committee of every charity and Association he
could gather into the net. Yet he was not satisfied. Associations
and charities are slow working bodies and to Mr. Pell's energetic
and autocratic mind there was no wisdom in the multitude of
councillors.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the Great European War came as a surprise to
Mr. Pell. In common with many other Australians, he had concluded
that a world wide war was without the scope of possibility. A
small war, say between Austria and Serbia would be quickly
localised by the other nations. Serbia was mad to challenge her
big neighbour and would no doubt get a thorough thrashing. Yes,
Serbia must have been mad to go to war and disturb commerce
unnecessarily, but then, all foreigners were mad. The only sane
people in the world were the British and Americans, with possibly
the Australians the sanest portion of the British race.</p>

<p>Russia and France entering the war considerably opened the
eyes of Mr. Pell and his friends. Yet they were continental
military nations and possibly did not know better, but when
England definitely declared to Germany, that she would view the
occupation of Belgium as an act of war, Mr. Pell was
astounded.</p>

<p>What! Fight Germany! Why Germany supplied the State with most
of the cheapest and most useful articles of daily use. To fight
Germany would dislocate trade to an alarming extent. It would
bankrupt half the commercial men of the Commonwealth! It would
lead to untold disasters and what could England do? She had only
a little army; just about sufficient to keep her shores from
invasion.</p>

<p>When Mr. Andrew Fisher, then Prime Minister of the
Commonwealth made his famous speech, offering Britain Australia's
last man and the last shilling, Mr. Pell began to look on matters
from a different standpoint. He had a deep admiration for Mr.
Fisher and was quite willing to follow his lead in so important a
matter.</p>

<p>Then came the call for recruits. Thousands were needed and
thousands enrolled, but still the cry was for more, and more. Mr.
Pell's heart began to burn with martial fire. He, for one, would
do his bit to help the Empire out of the hole. Having plenty of
time he started to tour the town, button-holing all the young men
of his acquaintance and requesting to know why they were not in
khaki.</p>

<p>So enthusiastic did Mr. Pell become in his recruiting campaign
that he began to make himself a nuisance to his friends. Business
men congregate together for the purpose of business and only when
that form of acquaintanceship merges into normal friendship does
an introduction to 'the family' become possible. The average man
in association with his fellows in business has somewhat of the
attributes of the Turks to his womenfolk. He ignores them and
expects others to follow his example.</p>

<p>In the past Mr. Pell had followed rigorously this unwritten
law, but now when the country needed men, unwritten laws had to
go by the board. Mr. Pell began to be openly curious as to the
families of his business acquaintances. He wanted to know how
many sons each had, and how many daughters; the respective ages,
and their adaptability for national and military service.</p>

<p>This was straining a point and so Mr. Stack informed him,
"Look 'ere, Pell. Leave my sons alone. If you want to know,
they've all got good jobs and are going to keep them. They don't
go to your piffling war with my consent, and that's
straight."</p>

<p>"But it is the duty of every man to aid his country in her
hour of need," Mr. Pell had heard the phrase somewhere and
thought it sounded well.</p>

<p>"Then you get into khaki yourself and then we'll talk."</p>

<p>Mr. Stack turned a cold shoulder to Mr. Pell. There was still
a suspicion in his mind that the finale of the Quicksands Bay
Estate episode would be interesting to know.</p>

<p>Get into khaki himself! Mr. Pell had never thought of that. He
looked down at his legs now encased in the most correct thing in
trouserings, and fast disappearing from view except when he
assumed a position that made him appear as if carrying a heavy
load on his shoulders. He knew he possessed a handsome pair of
legs and he could imagine how effective they would appear in
putties. He would certainly make a great figure and an excellent
example to the younger generation.</p>

<p>He would enlist! Age? Well he was not much past 50. He could
easily pass for 40 or even 42. He had heard of men deceiving the
medical examiners that way. As a recruit he would have a vast
influence over the sons of his friends. He would be able to
extend his operations and request strangers to "do their bit." In
imagination he could see himself walking at the head of a large
army of recruits all collected by his efforts. Surely the
authorities would give, him a commission. Captain Pell! It would
look fine. Perhaps after a little judicious wire pulling the
title might be merged into Major Pell.</p>

<p>He walked home that night with his head in the air. Already he
saw the Victoria Cross and the ribbon of the Legion of Honour on
his breast. He would be a popular hero. In the days to come when
the war was but a dream of the past he would be able to recount
to a circle of admiring friends all he had done for the Empire.
He explained this to Mrs. Pell in glowing terms. That lady was
not impressed.</p>

<p>"They might send you to the front," was her opinion. Send him
to the front! to fight! Why he might get shot! With a figure like
his it would be almost impossible for the enemy to miss him.
Besides he had heard that the men had to charge across waste land
at full trot, and Mr. Pell would at any time let the ferry boat
go rather than risk a run.</p>

<p>"They would feed you on bully beef and biscuits." This from
the lady, who had a thorough knowledge of her lord and
master.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell decided to say nothing more of the matter. The war
fever grew, and Mr. Pell became again enthusiastic. After all
they might find a job for him at home. He would, then, have all
the glory of the uniform and none of the dangers. Almost he
decided to enlist and chance it.</p>

<p>Fate brought in his way the son of a man he had a slight
acquaintance with. The youngster was in khaki with the trappings
of an officer! Mr. Pell did not recognise him at first, but once
his memory was refreshed, he became effusive. If he could not
afford to enlist he could certainly afford to give those who did
a good time. Catching his prey by the arm Mr. Pell made for the
most expensive restaurant.</p>

<p>A chance remark of his guest opened the way for honours
without risk. Mr. Pell learned that the Military Authorities had
decided to provide all rejected recruits with medals. With one of
those on his coat Mr. Pell saw his way to being a hero at a
small cost. A good bargain always appealed to him.</p>

<p>It was in this frame of mind that an hour later an
enterprising recruiting sergeant met him in Hay Street. The usual
enquiries were made and information given, and the sergeant took
his way to Francis Street with the new recruits staggering along
at his heels. Mr. Pell almost accomplished the humming of a
martial air as he followed his captor.</p>

<p>Francis Street, one of the quiet backwaters of the city before
the war, was now a scene of activity. Men in khaki were to be
seen on all sides, whilst the shouts of the drill sergeants
overtopped the high walls of the yard. Around the old artillery
buildings, that had some resemblance to the keep of an ancient
castle, had sprung up wood and iron erections to house the small
army of administrators that were supposed, and often failed, to
look after the comforts of the nation's soldiery. Over the top of
all floated the Australian flag and the Union Jack, symbolical of
the new united Empire born at the war cry of an arrogant
tyrant.</p>

<p>How many of these ideas sprang into the mind of Mr. Peter Pell
as he followed his conductor into the examining room, it is hard
to say. Perhaps the only coherent thought was that he was now a
hero&mdash;soon to be a rejected one.</p>

<p>A burly sergeant sitting at a desk in the middle of the room
looked up as Mr. Pell and his conductor strode up to his desk. At
the sight of Mr. Pell's magnificent frame he exclaimed. "Hullo,
Barnum! Brought your menagerie?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell's conductor turned and eyed him with an appraising
glance. "You're optimistic, my son," the other returned, his eyes
full on Mr. Pell. "What's he weigh? Eighteen if you ask me."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell felt himself growing warm. This was an indignity he
had not expected. Why did these men look at him as if he was some
unknown wild beast? It was insulting. For the moment he had the
impulse to turn on his heel and walk out of the room after a
scathing and dignified rebuke, but the thoughts of that rejected
medal held him silent.</p>

<p>"Name?" The question came like a pistol shot from the man at
the desk, and, as Mr. Pell hesitated, "Wake up, sonny. You can
sleep when I've done with you."</p>

<p>"Pell," he mumbled confusedly. "Funny name," quoth the
sergeant. "Got another?" Guessing the meaning of the enquiries,
Mr. Pell muttered "Peter."</p>

<p>"Peter Pell!" The sergeant mouthed the name with relish.
"Seems to me you've struck the limit this time," he continued
addressing the recruiting sergeant who stood by Mr. Pell's
side.</p>

<p>"He's all right," said that worthy; "Get some of the condition
off him and he'll give the weight of some of the yearlings."</p>

<p>"Maybe," the man at the desk looked Mr. Pell over carefully.
"But it'll be a dainty process and some of the 'structors up the
'ill will make your ears burn."</p>

<p>Then to Mr. Pell. "Get over there and show your hide."
Interpreted by his conductor Mr. Pell crossed the hall to a far
corner, where some twenty men were waiting clad only in their
trousers.</p>

<p>There was some considerable time to wait and then Mr. Pell's
name was bawled from the door of a room by an orderly. Propelled
by the friendly arm of his conductor Mr. Pell made a somewhat
undignified entrance before the doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell never speaks of the half hour he spent with the
military doctor. The indignity and inhumanity of that official
burned deep into his soul. He had entered that room with some
idea of the equality and brotherhood of mankind. He had, during
his business career, imbibed some thoughts of the dignity and
standing of the successful business man in the community, but
when he left that room the sole remaining thought in his mind was
that men were not brothers, that military despotism was the curse
of the world, and that the rule of the German Emperor was that of
a genial and benevolent tyrant besides that of an army
doctor.</p>

<p>Never a pugilistic man, he had a fixed and firm belief that he
would part with something handsome for the favour of five minutes
in a forty foot ring with that doctor, no rules and bare
knuckles. Thumped and bruised in body and dignity he huddled his
clothes on and approached the man at the desk.</p>

<p>"When shall I call for the medal?" he asked in a very
different tone from that of the Mr. Peter Pell of half an hour
before.</p>

<p>"What medal?" barked the sergeant without looking up.</p>

<p>"The rejected medal."</p>

<p>The Sergeant looked up quickly. "What the 'ell?" Then be
rummaged among a pile of papers that the orderly had just placed
at his elbow. "Name Pell?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You're passed!"</p>

<p>Passed! For the minute the room whirled, the bulky Sergeant
appeared to be dancing a fantastic jig in his high stool. Passed!
And he knew that his eyes were bad and his teeth would not have
made a mark on the softest bit of bread in the country. Passed!
He would be drilled and trained. His well-developed body would be
emaciated with hard living, hard work, hard words. He would be
bullied by all who could claim the smallest authority over him.
He would be pushed arid swindled by the men who would be called
his comrades. Finally he would be confined in a dirty and crowded
ship exposed in a wet and exposed trench, food for a Hunnish
bullet. From his reverie he was awakened by the voice of the
Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Now then, wake up. Have I got to ask you a dozen times if
you've got any work to do?"</p>

<p>Not understanding the question Mr. Pell replied in the
negative. "Then you can go up with this afternoon's draft. Go and
sit over there and&mdash;" the Sergeant hesitated for a minute
and then concluded "&mdash;look happy."</p>

<p>"I've got a wife," said Mr. Pell beginning to understand. The
Sergeant leaned over his desk in an impressive manner.</p>

<p>"Then I envy you, sonny. I've to go home to mine every night
an' she's always asking when I'm going to the front so as she'll
get shot of me. Some of you newies 'ave all the luck."</p>

<p>Meekly Mr. Pell sat down on a bench where some other men were
congregated. They looked at him vacantly and moved up nearer to
each other. No one of them spoke to him. They were all engaged in
a whispered conversation and did not want his company.</p>

<p>How long he sat there he could not remember. It seemed to him
that he must have slipped a night. His back hurt from the hard
wall against which he leaned. The board under him seemed full of
growing knots that swelled and grew more rugged the longer he sat
on them. Many men came in, some of them brought in as he had been
by recruiting officers, others of their own free will. Each of
them, in turn, departed into the doctor's room and, emerging,
said a few words to the sergeant at the desk. Some of them walked
out of the hall free men. Others, and they were very few, came
over to the bench and took seats there.</p>

<p>Presently a non-commissioned officer entered the room and
walked up to the bench. He looked them over, carefully, somewhat,
thought Mr. Pell, in the manner he had seen butchers surveying
stock at the sale yards.</p>

<p>"Attention!"</p>

<p>Some of the men stood up. Others sat still and gazed at the
officer vacantly.</p>

<p>"Stand up in a line," said the officer briefly. His tone was
that of a schoolmaster addressing the detention class. The men
stood up.</p>

<p>"Gawd!" said the officer under his breath. "'Ere, stand, as
you was happy about it. Square your shoulders, straighten your
legs, turn your toes out and hold up your heads."</p>

<p>Some of the men tried to obey.</p>

<p>The Sergeant at the desk rose and came over to watch
proceedings.</p>

<p>"They look a 'appy lot, don't they," he observed briefly.
"They'll look 'appier when I've done with them. Now, then men!
You're goin' to march through the streets, so look as if you're
enjoying it."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell thought it time to put in a word. "I have a
wife&mdash;" he commenced when the officer interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Then you're one of the lucky ones. You're quit of her and her
talk for a few months, perhaps, if you're lucky enough to stop a
bullet, for ever. Attention! Right turn! March!"</p>

<p>Out in the yard there was another halt. A lieutenant reviewed
the men and tried to infuse some martial spirit into them. He
altered the formation of the ranks and Mr. Pell found himself in
the leading file behind a very noisy band in which the drum
played more than a prominent part.</p>

<p>Fearing to look to the right or left Mr. Pell led the band of
"recruities" through the streets of Perth. Almost he prayed that
the march might end and he could find himself in the train on the
way to Blackboy. The desk sergeant had proved himself a friend in
that he had undertaken to send a telegram to Mrs. Pell informing
her of the military glory that had fallen on her lord.</p>

<p>But Mr. Pell felt defrauded. Where was the glory and the
honour of a military life? Here was he with a smartly cut lounge
coat and the latest thing in Tress's hat, marching side by side
with a swagman. He had hoped to be rejected. The doctors, he bad
heard, were very strict. The <i>Advertiser</i> had stated only a
few weeks before that 60 per cent of the men offering for
enlistment were rejected. What brain wave had happened to the
doctor that he had accepted him? Surely if the majority of the
recruits passed, were like himself, then the Empire must be in a
poor way.</p>

<p>The blare of the band and the shouts of the crowd at length
infused some spirit into Mr. Pell. If this were not a bad dream
and he was really sworn in as a soldier of the king then he must
make the best of it. After all it might not be so bad! Sergeants
were notorious bullies. In every military tale he had read, the
Sergeants bullied the privates. The thing to do was to keep out
of their way as much as possible, obey orders promptly, and all
that. Yes, he thought that military life might not be so bad,
after all.</p>

<p>The next few days were times of torture. Almost before the sun
had topped the trees the call to drill sounded. Right, left,
right, left, right wheel, left wheel, form fours, right face. Hour
after hour until the feet seemed almost to drop from his wearied
limbs. They had dressed him in a loose blue suit and a khaki hat
and brown boots that seemed to weigh about a ton each. Yet in
spite of the dull weariness, Mr. Pell began to enjoy life. True
the meals were primitive, consisting mainly of stew and tea, but
hard work is a great appetiser and, after the first day or so,
Mr. Pell quite looked forward to the 'cook-house' call.</p>

<p>There were some decent chaps in the camp and once the corners
were rubbed off, Mr. Pell began to enjoy the society. He found
that a bushman is still a man in spite of his calloused hands and
unrefined speech. That the farm hand and the station rider could
and would help a new chum in the camp life that their civil
employment had made almost second nature to them. Then there were
the concerts and entertainments that the men got up amongst
themselves. It was great to lounge, every muscle relaxed, and
join in the chorus of some popular song. After all, the untold
ages had sung of the joys of a soldier's life.</p>

<p>Then came leave. The duty sergeant told him that he was on the
roster for three days' leave. This, although Mr. Pell had quite
forgotten to ask. The railway carriage was uncomfortably full and
some of the men would insist on hanging half out of the window
throughout the journey, making the air inside the carriage warmly
close, but it was life, just life!</p>

<p>Mrs. Pell welcomed him home. She did not cry. But she walked
round him, and he was not bad to look at in his new khaki
uniform.</p>

<p>"You're getting thin, Peter," was all she said, but she made
up for lack of sentiment by a supper that made his mouth water in
after remembrance. The next two days were busy ones. Fortunately
Mr. Pell had very little uninvested cash and all his investments
were good and did not require much attention. A visit to his
lawyer placed all financial concerns in the capable hands of Mrs.
Pell. During his absence at the war she was to have the sole and
undivided responsibility of the Pell fortune. The late McPhee had
been a careful Scotsman and Mrs. McPhee (that was) had learned
much from him.</p>

<p>It was at supper on the second day that Mr. Pell found the
flavour of the entrée not what he imagined he thought it ought to
be. His after meal cigar did not taste as it should, and the
whisky was distinctly poor in quality, although the label marked
a first class brand. Suddenly he realised the meaning of it ail.
He was longing to get back to camp! He had grown used to a
soldier's life. Through the pains and disappointments of
training, he had grown to love a hard, disciplined life.</p>

<p>Marching up the hill to Blackboy Camp, he looked at the iron
crowned huts and canvas tents with affection. He realised that
soon he must leave them and depart over the seas to the great
unknown adventure. He had never been out of Western Australia in
his life and the little he knew of the outside world had been
mostly culled from the columns of newspapers. Now he was to go
outside.</p>

<p>In a few days he would see the lights of Fremantle fall in the
wake of the ship. He would look over the stern, smoke his pipe,
and watch the Rottnest Lighthouse gradually dip beneath the
waves. Then he would turn his face to the bows and, over the
waste of waters, see envisioned the fields of France and Belgium,
shot strewn and shattered, he had come to cleanse of the invader
and restore to their former industrial beauty. It was he and his
comrades that would do the work, and when they had accomplished
their task, perhaps they might be given a glance at the big
cities of the world, the centres from which his, and their
fathers had set out on the great adventure to the then wild and
unknown Australia.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Pell was ordered to fall out for rifle
drill. It was a new and decidedly more comfortable style of
drilling. No more the weary tramp, tramp round the dusty square
and the still more dusty roads. They sat in the shade with the
sergeant in their midst, while he took to pieces the mechanism of
a rifle and explained the parts. The long smooth barrel with the
shining spiral-grooved centre, the jerky irresistible bolt, the
neat scientific sights and the all-powerful trigger made Mr.
Pell's fingers itch to hold. At last the rifle rested in his
hands. He felt he must hug it to his breast. What could not a man
accomplish with this weapon.</p>

<p>Then the silent marking, as the rifle rested on the sandbag on
the tripod. Mr. Pell wanted to shout for joy when the Sergeant
said 'Not bad' to his marking.</p>

<p>The day came when his class was detailed for the range. By
this time he had been fitted with a rifle of his own. It was some
weight but he did not mind that. It was the rifle that counted
with its deadly power of barrel and bayonet. He felt it was a
servant he could trust to stand between him and death, yet at the
same time it was his master. As he handled it he could hear it
murmur, "Thrust, Thrust," and then again as his fingers closed
round the trigger, "Pull, Pull." Master and servant in one, but
above all Friend.</p>

<p>"What's up, Pell, you've missed every shot!"</p>

<p>It was an officer that stood over him as he lay facing the
butts. Pell jerked the bolt viciously without replying and took
careful aim at the "bull."</p>

<p>"Missed again!" the officer exclaimed. Then he took the rifle
from Mr. Pell and handed it to the sergeant in charge with a
short order. The sergeant lay down beside Pell and, quickly
sighting, scored a "bull."</p>

<p>"Report to doctor," ordered the officer as he moved down the
line.</p>

<p>It was a very dejected Mr. Pell that left the doctor's tent
the following morning and started to pack his kit.</p>

<p>"What's up sonny?" asked a tent mate.</p>

<p>"Got my 'rejected' medal. That's all!" replied Mr. Pell, and
there was a hard lump in his throat difficult to swallow.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE PURSUIT OF
SOCIETY</a></h2>

<p class="first">MRS. PETER PELL had ambitions. Possessed of a
comfortable income, and a husband who had become amenable to
domestic persuasion, she desired to become a leader of
Society.</p>

<p>It is claimed that Australia is a democratic country. It is
also claimed that all men are equal, and to give point to the
claim it has become the habit of employees to address their
employers as 'Tom' and "Dick." At the very frequent elections,
candidates point to this fact as illustrating the democracy of
Australia.</p>

<p>It is but an illusion. Behind the employer is an irresistible
force&mdash;his wife. The democracy of Australia is not an
immoveable body. Thus the growth of Society in Australia. The
"Tom" and "Dick" are pleasant illusions, to destroy which might
cause something near a revolution. The secret of an autocratic
rule is to preserve illusions. The women of Australia are
autocrats, as are their sisters of the old world.</p>

<p>It has to be allowed to Mr. Peter Pell, as a virtue, that he
held to the great illusion of democracy for a considerable
period, against the persuasions of Mrs. Pell. He had no social
aspirations. He had no desire to see his name in print. In the
past, and while he was battling for the comfortable income Mrs.
Pell was now spending so wisely, he had shunned publicity. In
this he had not always been successful. At times he had read his
name on the headlines of the morning journals with feelings
almost akin to rage. He had been held up to public contumely as a
commercial pirate. Yet he had won through to the leisured ease he
now enjoyed. Was he to jeopardise his ease and privacy for the
doubtful honour of Society? Mrs. Pell said "Yes" very firmly, and
finally carried the proposition without a dissenting voice.</p>

<p>A simple agreement had appeared to Mr. Pell the easiest way
out of the domestic trouble caused by the "Society" question.
There was the money, and there was Mrs. Pell. If the good lady
desired to spend the money in a raid on the Society stronghouses
of Perth Mr. Pell considered it her funeral. He would stand by
and watch the fun. Something of this he mentioned to a friend on
the Terrace one morning and was promptly disillusioned.</p>

<p>"If that's all you know about women, Pell," said the friend
emphatically, "it's a pity you ever got married. If your wife
wants Society you will have to want it too&mdash;and want it
badly."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell recognised the force of the argument. Domestic bliss
had already revealed to him that marriage is the blending of two
personalities into one, and that one decidedly feminine.</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?" he queried. "What is this 'flaming'
Society? Where does it hang out and who's the President or
Chairman of the business?"</p>

<p>"That's just the trouble," replied the friend. "There isn't a
head. It isn't a question of walking into an office and paying a
subscription. The Governor of the State is supposed to be the
head, but he really has but little to do with it."</p>

<p>"A kind of ex-officio member." suggested Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"Not quite." The friend smiled quietly as one in the know. "I
should describe his position as that of a heathen god. Something
to be worshipped, while the priests don't pay much attention to
his wishes."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pell says we must go into Society," said Mr. Pell, in
the tone of a schoolboy repeating a lesson.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you luck." The friend shook hands and walked
away mournfully, as one who went to order a floral token for a
dear departed friend.</p>

<p>For several days Mr. Pell pursued his enquiries as to Society
among his former business associates. From none did he get any
definite satisfaction. One or two in fact suggested that his, Mr.
Pell's, known business methods would be of distinct disadvantage
to him in the matter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pell brought the matter to a climax. One morning at
breakfast she demanded an account of her husband's stewardship.
Mr. Pell was forced to confess that he had made no progress. Mrs.
Pell said little, but that little made it abundantly clear that
her opinion of the human male was small.</p>

<p>"What you have to do," she declaimed; "is to force your way to
their notice. Let me have the paper."</p>

<p>Taking the <i>Advertiser</i> she rapidly scanned the Society
column. Finally she placed her finger on a paragraph. "Lady
Smith-Jones is appealing for subscriptions for the Home for Aged
Bank Clerks," she announced. "You must send her a
subscription."</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear," replied Mr. Pell. If the sending of a few
pounds would obtain the entry of his lady into Society he was
more than willing. "I'll send her a 'fiver' this morning."</p>

<p>"A 'fiver'," echoed Mrs. Pell. "That won't do at all."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell doubled his stake.</p>

<p>"Nonsense." Mrs. Pell was indignant. "You always want to do
thing on the cheap. Send her £500."</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds!" Mr. Pell poured his cup of
tea into his collar instead of his mouth, and did not notice what
he had done. If he could only get into Society on those terms,
bankruptcy stared him in the face. It was a long and wordy
argument. Finally Mrs. Pell consented to a compromise of £250 and
the cheque was duly despatched. It happened that more persons
than Mrs. Pell were interested in the Home for Aged Bank Clerks.
Mr. Smithers of the <i>Advertiser</i> took a particular interest
in the matter on behalf of his paper, and at the time of the
arrival of Mr. Pell's cheque, was interviewing Lady Smith-Jones.
The munificent gift was immediately brought to his
notice&mdash;and noted.</p>

<p>The following morning Mr. Pell was disagreeably surprised to
see that the <i>Advertiser</i> featured his benevolence in large
type. There was a little paragraph as to the virtue and necessity
of the Home, another about Mr. Pell's cheque, and a lot about Mr.
Pell, his business career and the probable reasons for the
donation. Many of the paragraphs carried a sting, for the
<i>Advertiser</i> had a long memory and Mr. Pell's name was
prominent on the newspaper's black list.</p>

<p>A sedative to the newspaper notice was found in a little note
from Lady Smith-Jones, thanking Mr. Pell for his munificent
donation, and requesting him to call at his earliest convenience,
"on business of the Home in which we are both interested." Mrs.
Pell was jubilant. A breach had been made in the fortress.
Another attack and the fortress would fall. Mr. Pell was
despatched forthwith to the interview with abundant instructions
for his guidance, and, incidentally, a hint, that if he failed,
it would be better that the Quicksands Bay ferry boat was wrecked
on the return journey.</p>

<p>Lady Smith-Jones lived in Mount Street. Society, as is
understood in Perth, patronises Mount Street and the
environments. Yet Mount Street is not a thoroughfare likely to
recommend itself to the traditional alderman of Victorian
literature. It branches from St. George's Terrace at the west end
and deceitfully continues on the level for some hundred yards or
so. Then it takes a turn upwards until the unwary traveller
wonders if the journey's end is in the sky&mdash;it eventually
turns out to be the Park.</p>

<p>As it is, "Society" folk now-a-day motor, and the burden of
the ascent is borne by the mechanical steed and not by the
well-shod possessions of wealthy and corpulent gentlemen. Lady
Smith-Jones lived at the higher end. Mr. Pell walked from the
Terrace. It was a very weary and hot gentleman that knocked at
Lady Smith-Jones' door. Only the thought of the £250 he had
invested in that Society dame spurred him on to a final
endeavour. Sovereigns are not picked up in handfuls in Western
Australia, in spite of the promises of the young men of the
State's consulate in Westminster. Mr. Pell had invested&mdash;he
had a doubt as to his wiseness&mdash;and he determined to show a
clean return. The young lady maid, who opened the door,
recognised the fine figure of the visitor, and made no demur to
his demand for an interview.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Pell!" Lady Smith-Jones swam forward with a
shimmer and rustle of silken skirts. Her face beamed with
pleasure, yet she cast a backward glance at a lady seated near
the tea-table. It is all very well to ask a satisfactory
contributor to call, but sometimes that call is most inopportune.
Nothing of this showed in the lady's manner. She was all
graciousness.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell bowed in his most impressive manner. The lady was
good to look upon. Her figure would have been called buxom a few
years ago, and Mr. Pell was slightly old-fashioned in his ideas
regarding women. The modern craze for slimness, that verged on
thinness, found no favour with him. A fine woman should be
substantial. Lady Smith-Jones was decidedly substantial.</p>

<p>A few words of introduction, and the flow of conversation,
interrupted by the advent of Mr. Pell, recommenced. That
gentleman found himself seated beside his hostess, with a thin
angular maiden lady on his other side. Lady Smith-Jones occupied
one hand with a cup of tea, the lady filled the other with cake.
Mr. Pell wished to stir the tea and not to drop the cake. He did
neither.</p>

<p>Lady Smith-Jones was the relict of a merchant of the city of
Perth, who had acquired a considerable fortune by selling shoddy
German goods to the colonists of Western Australia at prices far
in advance of that of the best British goods. After he retired,
he took his wife to the Old Country for a holiday. There happened
to be a crisis with the political party then in power in Great
Britain, and Cornelius Jones was rewarded with a knighthood, as a
token of his services to British trade in the colony. Returning
to Western Australia, Sir Cornelius Smith-Jones (he had assumed
his wife's maiden surname with the title) departed for regions
unknown, leaving his wife to blossom into a "Society"
leader. This was not difficult, for a title opens every door
in a democratic country.</p>

<p>All this, Mr. Pell was well acquainted with. The rise of Sir
Cornelius had been a beacon star in his commercial horizon. Would
he in his turn blossom into "Sir Peter Pell." If the fates were
kind, then he determined he would not leave Lady Pell to "star"
alone. He looked at his hostess with admiration, the cake in one
hand and the cup in the other.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pell has been good enough to donate £250 to our Home for
Aged Bank Clerks," announced Lady Smith-Jones impressively. The
angular female on Mr. Pell's right looked at him.</p>

<p>"So good of him, Lady Smith-Jones. I have some Quicksand Bay
Estate lots, Mr. Pell." Mr. Pell did not see the analogy.</p>

<p>"We shall be able to do so much with so munificent a
donation," continued Lady Smith-Jones.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is any chance of selling Great Fallgall
Gold Mine shares, Mr. Pell?" observed the angular lady.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell dropped quite a large piece of cake.</p>

<p>"I think it is a great shame that the banks, with so much
money, do not make proper provision for their employees when too
old to work." Lady Smith-Jones had mounted her latest hobby. "I
know one case, such a sad one, of a bank clerk over fifty years
of age who has to support a wife and two children on a paltry
£200 a year retiring allowance. I consider it positively
disgraceful. Don't you, Miss Mufkins?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he speculated in land," sniffed the angular lady.
"You are not thinking of establishing a home for Indigent Land
Agents, Lady Smith-Jones?"</p>

<p>"Do you think there is a necessity, dear?" Lady Smith-Jones was
interested.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the angular lady. "They appear to
always do well out of it. Perhaps Mr. Pell can advise you."</p>

<p>Another piece of cake reached the carpet. Mr. Pell's fingers
had closed too firmly on the fragile substance. Before he could
think of a suitable retort the lady rose.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dear Lady Smith-Jones. I have so enjoyed my
call. So glad to have met you, Mr. Pell. Be sure and let me know
if you can sell my Quicksand Bay lots for me."</p>

<p>"Now we can have a nice chat," observed Lady Smith-Jones, as
the door closed after the visitor. "It was so good of you to send
me that cheque."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell slowly turned his eyes from the door. Miss Mufkins
had taken away his breath. Was he always to be reminded of the
past? For the moment he had dreamed of rushing after the lady and
offering to purchase her interests at any premium she required.
Lady Smith-Jones' smooth voice was an antidote.</p>

<p>"It was just the sum we required to make up the deposit on the
new wing. What made you think of poor us?"</p>

<p>"It was my wife. She saw it in the paper." Mr. Pell had not
yet recovered his equilibrium.</p>

<p>"So good of her," cooed Lady Smith-Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell looked at the lady and the lady looked at him. Here
was the chance to place a judicious word to forward his ulterior
object. He opened his mouth to speak, but the lady was first.</p>

<p>"We might as well be candid, Mr. Pell." The lady's manner had
changed suddenly. No longer did she coo, and her figure seemed to
lose its buxomness. "You did not send that cheque for the fun of
the thing."</p>

<p>"I am always willing to forward a deserving object," Mr. Pell
spoke unctuously.</p>

<p>"So am I." Lady Smith-Jones laughed quietly. "I have heard of
you Mr. Pell, and I wanted to meet you. Now you are here you
might be candid. I am open to an offer."</p>

<p>"Then you do not consider the Home for Aged Bank Clerks a
deserving charity?" queried Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"I do not." The lady was emphatic. "Neither do you. If you
want to know, the deserving charity is Lady Smith-Jones."</p>

<p>"But you are a rich woman."</p>

<p>"I try to appear so, Mr. Pell, but it is very hard work."</p>

<p>"Your husband left you a fortune." Mr. Pell was trying to
collect his scattered wits. If Lady Smith-Jones was not a rich
woman then she had successfully hoodwinked the public for a
considerable time.</p>

<p>"My husband left me two thousand pounds." Lady Smith-Jones
leaned forward across the table. "I am making no secret of the
matter to you Mr. Pell, because you and I are in the same boat,
we both live on the public. You by successful raids on the
commercial world, and I by my social charities."</p>

<p>"Why are you telling me this?"</p>

<p>"Because you have come here to buy something I have to sell,
and&mdash;" the lady hesitated&mdash;'I&mdash;I do not want to
lose your custom."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell considered the proposition. It was one thing for the
opposition to place their cards on the table. It was quite a
different thing for him to follow suit. In games of this kind Mr.
Pell did not like to count card against card. He preferred to
have a few in reserve.</p>

<p>"My dear lady!" Mr. Pell temporised. "Your conjecture may be
quite accurate. I may have in mind a purchase. Why do you suggest
you will be the seller?"</p>

<p>"For the reason that you have donated £250 to this
charity."</p>

<p>Lady Smith-Jones was quite at ease. The trend of the
conversation had shown her that Mr. Pell required a <i>quid pro
quo</i> for his cheque.</p>

<p>"I may have certain ideas that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was cautiously feeling his way. The lady however did
not shirk the issue and swept away all obstacles with a careless
hand.</p>

<p>"If you will not explain, then I will. You want to be
recognised by the best people in what you call "Society." You
come to me to help you&mdash;and you are afraid to make the
proposition. Well, I am open to a deal. I will introduce you and
your wife every where and you will pay me&mdash;how much?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell made his offer, and it was accepted. He had learned
much wisdom in the few minutes of his call on Lady Smith-Jones.
Preliminaries were few and, laden with instructions, Mr. Pell
returned to Quicksands Bay.</p>

<p>Very gradually the name of Pell began to appear in the doings
of that inner circle of idlers known as Society. Mrs. Pell
superintended a stall at some charity, and her dress and
history&mdash;as edited by Lady Smith-Jones&mdash;duly appeared
in the papers. Mr. Pell was allotted a seat on certain charity
boards and his speeches found their way&mdash;also duly
edited&mdash;into the press.</p>

<p>Gradually the question "Who are the Pells?" was answered. The
Pells were accepted, and seen everywhere. The climax was reached
when Mrs. Pell was invited to decorate winners at the
Agricultural Show.</p>

<p>What it cost in hard cash Mr. Pell dared not think. Once or
twice he ventured a remonstrance, but Mrs. Pell was enjoying
herself and refused to consider ways and means. Briefly, and
emphatically, she informed Mr. Pell that, if money was lacking,
it was his business to correct the error.</p>

<p>Yet with this dictum the lady coupled a rider, that no more
risky propositions in the way of land deals, or gold mines, were
to be floated. He, the husband of Mrs. Pell, must support his
position. There must be ample opportunity in legitimate trade.
Look at Sir Cornelius Smith-Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had looked. He had received just the right
information on the subject of the deceased merchant, and he was
not inclined to follow in the footsteps of the dear departed. As
to the proposition of "legitimate" trade, it was foreign to Mr.
Pell's instincts and traditions. He was a commercial pirate. His
instincts were to raid. He cared nothing for the stability of
trade. At the head of an established business he knew he would be
a failure, and with that knowledge he had no intention of
trying.</p>

<p>Yet something had to be done. Three months of Society had cost
Mr. Pell a year's income. He felt sore. Money was for the use of
man, not to be squandered. Yet dare he hint of this to Mrs. Pell?
The lady had strong and well defined ideas of her own. She had
decided on obtaining a footing in Society, and Mr. Pell well
understood the uselessness of trying to combat her determination.
Mr. Pell thought deeply.</p>

<p>About this time, two incidents happened in quick succession.
The first was that Messrs Stack &amp; Co. acquired, at bargain
prices, the balance of the Quicksands Bay Estate and made a nice
little sum by the sale thereof. The second, the appearance in the
columns of the <i>Advertiser</i> of a very ordinary
advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">Society ladies are reminded that any
temporary embarrassment can be alleviated by applying to The
Albion Company, Victory House, William Street, Perth.</p>

<p>While quite an ordinary paragraph and regarded as the
offspring of the brain of some financial agent, it was worded in
a manner that attracted the attention of many. Even in so small a
community as Western Australia, there are a number of people who
aspire to be counted in with society. This ambition is expensive
and many a comfortable income will not stand the strain.</p>

<p>Society is a microbe that has not yet been located by
scientists. There are many microbes and germs that scientists
tell us are so small that there is but little hope of locating
them with the present instruments. Perhaps it is that the Society
germ is one of these. Certain it is that, up to the present, our
very conservative scientists have pooh-poohed the idea of a
Society germ. Those who have been attacked by the disease know
better.</p>

<p>Certainly the success of The Albion Company was phenomenal.
Callers were interviewed by a clerk who appeared to have no
knowledge of the State, or any relations on earth. He
acknowledged to the inquisitive Mr. Smithers, of the
<i>Advertiser</i>, that he had been imported from the East. When
questioned as to his antecedents he cheerfully declared that his
employer did not like him to have any such things about the
place, As to his knowledge of his employer, it was most
fragmentary. That gentleman's name was Mr. Duke, he paid a good
salary, and was not to be seen by appointment, or otherwise.
Temporarily embarrassed Society people were asked to write their
requirements.</p>

<p>The mail of the Albion Company was large. The knowledge of the
mythical Mr. Duke was still larger. He seemed to have an intimate
acquaintance with the private history and banking account of
everybody who was worth knowing. His knowledge as to the
reimbursement he desired from the temporarily embarrassed, was
the largest of all.</p>

<p>Prominent ladies of the State soon found that if they were
modest in their demands, as to assistance and terms, they had but
little difficulty in securing the assistance they required. They
followed the rules laid down for them. They wrote their
requirements, fully. A few days after, a carefully designed and
un-business-like promissory note and a post-dated cheque came to
hand. It was surely a most unbusinesslike proceeding. Yet one
lady, who kept the cheque, and forgot to sign the elegant note
wished afterwards that she had a better memory.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers and the <i>Advertiser</i> were bitterly opposed
to the Albion Company. In the first place, Mr. Smithers did not
get anything out of the matter&mdash;not even news. One day he
tackled Mr. Pell on the Terrace and accused him of being the man
behind the scenes at the Albion Company. Mr. Pell was astonished.
All his money was invested in good mortgages on house property.
Besides, now his wife was a Society dame, business, especially of
the "Albion" type, was low. Mr. Smithers professed to be
satisfied, and wrote a slashing attack on the Albion Company and
Mr. Pell, unwarrantedly connecting the two. Mr. Pell consulted
his solicitors. The <i>Advertiser</i> apologised and reprimanded
Mr. Smithers. Mr. Smithers felt very sore.</p>

<p>The gentleman who presides over the Local Court of Perth,
finds that a considerable portion of his time is taken up in
deciding between those who give assistance, and those who require
it. In the preliminary stages of the business, there appears to
be a willingness on both sides to come to a mutual arrangement.
This is followed by a breach of understanding and finally, when
matters reach the Local Court Magistrate, it is hard to
understand how on earth the parties ever managed to agree in the
first principles. Yet in the whole history of the Albion Company,
there is no record of any instance when the legal luminaries were
ever troubled with its or its client's affairs.</p>

<p>A glance at the carefully guarded books of the Albion Company
would have revealed the name of Lady Smith-Jones as a prominent
patron of the firm. In fact, Mr. Duke, who appears to know the
inner history of most of his clients, professed ignorance of the
manner in which this lady conducted her operations. At the first
she had borrowed a small sum from the Company. It had been repaid
promptly, and further sums borrowed in larger amounts. Several
well-known names, all ladies, appeared on the backs of the dainty
'promises' and one day Mr. Duke found one endorsed "Charity
Pell."</p>

<p>Now Mr. Duke did not run off to interview Mr. Peter Pell. It
was not the policy of the Company to do anything so obvious, but
the sleek and able clerk received instructions to discover the
financial standing of Charity Pell's' husband, and also for what
reason Charity Pell should accommodate Lady Smith-Jones. The
report slip was pinned to the "promise" and read:</p>

<p class="letter">Husband&mdash;good.<br>
Wife&mdash;dependent.<br> Cause&mdash;Pirate Bridge.</p>

<p>Bridge is a good game. Auction Bridge claims to be a better.
Auction Bridge intermarried in the Nap Poker-Solo family and the
offspring was named "Pirate." It is a name that has a certain
amount of truth attached to it. It is a mechanical absorber.</p>

<p>Ladies who are fond of card playing have a peculiar code of
honour. To their opponents they play the usual game, but in the
privacy of the nuptial chamber they play with their husbands, as
unwilling opponents, the old game of "Heads I win, tails you
pay." Mrs. Pell had developed a genius in this game, until one
day Mr. Pell definitely refused to play or pay. Mrs. Pell wept.
Lady Smith-Jones talked. Mr. Duke wrote letters.</p>

<p>Financial experts tell us there is but a limited quantity of
gold in circulation. In this time of war and stress, husbands
have found that this limitation is more stringent than they
supposed. They have passed on this knowledge to their families,
and have been named for selfish savages. Certainly when Pirate
Bridge lends a hand, in this time of stress, the financial
limitation of gold is certain to become very acute. Other ladies
than Mrs. Pell found that the matrimonial noose would not tighten
sufficiently and Lady Smith-Jones found herself the sole
possessor of a quantity of daintily perfumed, perfectly matured,
promises on emaciated banking accounts. Mr. Duke was
insistent.</p>

<p>One morning early, a closely veiled lady took the lift in
Victory House to the second floor. Waiting until the lift had
descended again she entered the office of the Albion Company and
asked for Mr. Duke. The clerk returned the stereotyped answer:
"Mr. Duke was not at the office." The Lady professed a
willingness to wait, and was shown into the waiting room.</p>

<p>In the business of the Albion Company it had been found futile
to discourage, by word of mouth, the decision of the callers to
wait until Mr. Duke came in. It was a hobby. The Company did not
discourage hobbies. For this hobby it set apart a handsome
waiting room and made bets with itself on the individual patience
of callers. No one, so far, had waited until Mr. Duke
appeared.</p>

<p>There was no other waiter in the room, and the lady, with a
sigh of relief, threw back the veil and revealed the countenance
of Lady Smith-Jones.</p>

<p>It was a long wait. Luncheon hour passed and the lady longed
greatly for a cup of tea. At five o'clock she was still there,
grim and determined. The clerk ventured to suggest that Mr. Duke
might not call that day, and he wished to lock up and go home.
Lady Smith-Jones gave him permission to lock up. She would be
locked up too. The clerk retired and held a conversation on the
telephone.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. Then the door opened quietly and a
gentleman entered. Lady Smith-Jones caught for her veil but was
not quick enough.</p>

<p>"Lady Smith-Jones!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Pell!"</p>

<p>The lady recovered her self-possession.</p>

<p>"Then you are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Duke." Mr. Pell finished the sentence with a bow. He
appeared to be entirely at ease.</p>

<p>"Then I need not worry over my little notes."</p>

<p>Lady Smith-Jones tried to pass off the matter easily.</p>

<p>"I think, my dear lady, there is every reason why you should
worry."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" Lady Smith-Jones was beaming sweetly at Mr.
Pell. "I am sure you and I will never quarrel."</p>

<p>"Never, dear lady," echoed Mr. Pell. "If you will give up your
private Pirate Bridge parties."</p>

<p>"And it cost me so much time to learn the horrid game," sighed
the lady.</p>

<p>"I find it so expensive," murmured Mr. Pell looking at the
corner of the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Is your objection personal, Mr. Pell?" The lady was
considering the pattern of the carpet.</p>

<p>"Purely personal," echoed Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"I think that difficulty can be overcome."</p>

<p>"I trust so."</p>

<p>There was a pause and then two pairs of eyes found each other.
"And you a Society gentleman. Oh fie, Mr. Pell."</p>

<p>"One must have some occupation."</p>

<p>"A profitable occupation. It is profitable, Mr. Pell?"</p>

<p>"Fairly well." Mr. Pell threw out his chest when he thought of
the difference the Albion Company had made in his banking
account. "Enough for two?"</p>

<p>"Eh!"</p>

<p>"I said 'enough for two.'" The lady was bending forward across
the table, smiling gently.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not." Mr. Pell was very emphatic.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry." The voice of Lady Smith-Jones had fallen
almost to a whisper. "It would be a terrible exposure. Quite a
tit-bit for the <i>Advertiser</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell looked for the door of the trap and found it had
closed very suddenly. He looked at the lady. She was smiling
confidently.</p>

<p>"I must look into the matter!"</p>

<p>"I am so glad you take it like that, my dear Mr. Pell." She
rose from her seat and extended her hand. "Good-bye partner. I am
sure we shall get along so comfortably together."</p>

<p>Limply Mr. Pell took her hand. She pressed it gently and moved
towards the door. There she hesitated.</p>

<p>"And what are the office hours, partner?"</p>

<p>Then the door closed, leaving Mr. Pell alone in the waiting
room.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE PURSUIT OF A
SPY</a></h2>

<p class="first">"PETER!" Mrs. Pell's voice held a note of
shocked warning. Mr. Pell looked up amazedly. "Mind the butter.
Don't you know there is a shortage?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell slowly replaced the large slice of butter on the
dish. Then he reached for the sugar.</p>

<p>"There is no stock of sugar in the State," warned Mrs. Pell,
ominously. The lid of the sugar-bowl became suddenly hot in Mr.
Pell's fingers.</p>

<p>"Is it permitted a man may have breakfast in war time?" Mr.
Pell strove to be sarcastic.</p>

<p>"You talk as if everything was my fault!" Mrs. Pell became
tearful. "I'm sure I don't want to stint you, but when I am to
get more supplies I don't know."</p>

<p>"If it's a question of money?" commenced Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"Money!" the interruption was tinged with scorn. "That's all a
man knows. Why, I paid the grocer nearly £50 for supplies
yesterday and he would only let me have a quarter of a pound of
butter, half a pound of sugar, and a pound of tea."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell grunted.</p>

<p>"And he told me to be careful as he could not promise when he
could let me have any more."</p>

<p>"I shall have to talk to that man," remarked Mr. Pell
majestically.</p>

<p>"What will be the good of that? He's not frightened of you.
It's all because of those horrid strikes in the East. There's
lots of sugar there&mdash;and butter too."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell considered the situation carefully.</p>

<p>"And it's all your fault, too." Womanlike she made the grand
attack on the nearest male. "You think you rule the country, but
you don't."</p>

<p>"My dear Charity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't Charity me!" Mrs. Pell was now on safer ground, that of
household supplies. "It's the fault of those <i>men</i> strikers.
And they're all Germans, too."</p>

<p>"What have the Germans to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Of course they have all to do with it. If we women had been
running the country when war started there would have been no
strikes&mdash;no nothing!"</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have been misinformed," commenced Mr. Pell.
He got no further; ladies have an unconquerable objection to a
two-sided argument.</p>

<p>"I saw it in the newspaper so it must be so. The strikes are
caused by German spies who are determined to starve us, and I
won't starve."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell reached for his hat. The argument had reached the
stage where tears are brought in to turn defeat into rout. It is
unpleasant to go to town in a damp coat.</p>

<p>On the ferry Mr. Pell pondered the situation. He felt there
must be some truth in the facts as stated by Mrs. Pell. There was
certainly a shortage of useful commodities in the State. It was
equally true that in the great centres of the Eastern States
there were plenty of the commodities the West lacked, waiting to
be shipped. Between famine and plenty there stood the
strikers.</p>

<p>The daily press of the world had, for the past three years,
been exposing the machinations of the brutal Hun. Leisured
consideration&mdash;and there is plenty of time for leisured
consideration on the State Ferry Service&mdash;convinced Mr. Pell
that the shortage on his breakfast table had been directly due to
His Majesty the Emperor of Germany. Something <i>must</i> be
done.</p>

<p>During the day, Mr. Pell made many enquiries on the Terrace on
the subject of the German spy system. Most Western Australians,
when in doubt, go to the Terrace for information. No other
country in the world possesses a Terrace of the same peculiar
properties; and it is possible that in no other country would
such a place be allowed. It is the Mecca of information. It
contains, in its varied humanity, representatives of all the
businesses of the State. On the Terrace are to be found farmers
and stockmen who have never seen a farm or a head of live cattle
in their lives. There you can buy anything you don't want and
sell what you have not got. There you can obtain the latest news
of the war and of the great centres of the world. There you will
find the chief newspapers of the State, ready to contradict every
rumour and set up no counter news in their place. It is chiefly
populated by men who appear to have no business and to do well
out of nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Pell was well known on the Terrace. He had at one
time been one of the mysterious persons who reaped where they had
not sown. Now, in the days of his prosperity, he returned to the
fold at intervals to learn the wisdom of commerce, alas, purely
as an outsider. Yet, as of the freemasonry, he was not denied the
information he desired.</p>

<p>"My dear man," exclaimed Mr. Smithers, "did you not read my
articles on the German Menace to Western Australia? You would
have found there all the information you desired."</p>

<p>"Are they very long?" cautiously enquired Mr. Pell. He knew
the Australian journalist by much suffering.</p>

<p>"About one hundred columns of our paper, dear boy. I'm
thinking of publishing them in book form."</p>

<p>"I won't wait for that," said Mr. Pell hurriedly. "Can you
give me the gist of them in tabloid form?"</p>

<p>Only the fear of the law compels men not to talk of their own
works. In this case, Mr. Smithers had the audience he longed for.
It was a chance to glorify Journalist Smithers with much liquid
refreshment and perchance a loan. Carefully he piloted Mr. Pell
to a secluded corner of the Palace bar and unfolded his tale.</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour Mr. Pell learned a lot about the
doings of "Brother Hun" in Western Australia, and a little of the
liquid absorbing powers of a journalist. It was cheap information
for the pound note loan that was duly extracted.</p>

<p>Leaving Mr. Smithers in the bar, Mr. Pell sought out Mr.
Stack. That gentleman, controlling the destinies of one of the
biggest Land and Estate Agencies, was a mine of information. He
welcomed Mr. Pell enthusiastically, for the accolade of Society
erases many unwelcome memories.</p>

<p>"The German menace in Western Australia is very real, Mr.
Pell," commenced Mr. Stack in his best oratorical manner. "I have
given much thought to the matter. In my business I have many
unique opportunities to examine the problem."</p>

<p>"Come to lunch and let's talk," said Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>Mr. Stack reached for his hat without a word. Mr. Pell was
noted for his gastronomic entertainments.</p>

<p>After the first wants of nature had been satisfied Mr. Stack
proceeded to supply Mr. Pell with facts and figures. For the
first time Mr. Pell realised that he had been living on the
hidden crater of a volcano; that the Germans owned Western
Australia and a goodly part of the other States; that German
money had throttled the trade of the Commonwealth; that German
emissaries were in the Government service; that Germans owned the
land, the trade, the people, and the Government. It was the cruel
and bitter truth, bluntly told.</p>

<p>"You may not realise it, Mr. Pell," concluded Mr. Stack, "but
what I have told you are simple facts. Even in this room," and he
gazed cautiously around him, "we are probably surrounded by spies
of the German Empire. Look across there," and he pointed to a far
table. "You see that young man. He is a German spy. It was he who
obtained the plans of the Applecross Wireless Station, the plans
of the Mundaring Weir, and the plans of the Goldfields Water
Supply System and sent them to Germany."</p>

<p>"Why don't they arrest him?" enquired Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"Because, while he is of German extraction, he was born in
Australia. It is our laws that are at fault. We don't say, as we
should, "Once a German, always a German." No, we declare the son
of a German born on Australian soil to be an Australian."</p>

<p>"What do the Germans say?" Mr. Pell thought this a good
question.</p>

<p>"There you have hit the nail on the head, if I may be allowed
to use so vulgar an expression," triumphantly exclaimed Mr.
Stack. "The Germans say "Once a German, always a German," and
they act up to it."</p>

<p>The young man across the room rose from the table and walked
to the door. Mr. Pell felt the warm blood racing through his
veins. Here was an enemy of his country. Here was one of the men
who had shackled the Briton's breakfast table. Surely it was his
duty to act.</p>

<p>"Why has he never been interned?" he whispered hurriedly to
Mr. Stack.</p>

<p>"Because he is first of Australian birth, and secondly he has
never been caught."</p>

<p>"Then I will catch him," exclaimed Mr. Pell fiercely. He
grabbed his hat and, leaving Mr. Stack to settle for the lunch,
followed his prey out of the restaurant.</p>

<p>The spy appeared to have little to do that day. Strolling
along Hay Street he carefully examined the shop windows and after
a time turned into the Palladium Picture Palace. There Mr. Pell
followed him and found a seat where he could keep an eye on him
and also enjoy the entertainment. After the pictures the spy
walked quickly to Murray Street and ascended in the lift to
Boan's Roof Garden for afternoon tea.</p>

<p>It was a prosaic afternoon and Mr. Pell began to wonder if his
friend, Mr. Stack, had not been mistaken. It was also a warm
afternoon and Mr. Pell thought regretfully of his club and the
cool drinks to be obtained there. Tea was not a favourite drink
with him and the young lady in the tea room had looked
scandalised when he had suggested that if she looked far enough a
more palatable drink than tea might be found. Yet still the fires
of patriotism burned fierce. Whatever the discomfort this spy
must be traced and denounced.</p>

<p>The early hours of the evening were passed in an idle
inspection of the streets of Perth. The spy was an indefatigable
walker, Mr. Pell was not. Another picture show gave the tracker a
short interval for relaxation, and then matters began to improve.
Leaving Perth the spy walked quickly westwards. At the top of Hay
Street West hill, he turned into Thomas Street, walking towards
the Park. It was fairly dark and Mr. Pell had some difficulty in
preserving the average between seeing and secrecy. At the corner
of King's Park and Thomas Street the spy stopped. A few moments
and a powerful motor car came from Subiaco and stopped at the
corner. The spy walked to the car and spoke to the driver. A few
moments conversation and he entered the car, which drove, off
leaving Mr. Pell stranded.</p>

<p>This part of Thomas Street is a lonely country lane. There are
a few houses standing in ample gardens, but no shops and, at that
time of the night, but little traffic. To hire a motor here was
impossible. The main street was some quarter of a mile away, and
it was improbable that a motor car would be procurable there.
Still, Mr. Pell resolved to chance it. The ardour of the chase
was in his blood. He was determined not to lose the spy until he
had evidence of his guilt. Visions of a court martial, a firing
squad, a dead German spy, and the thanks of the Government,
flitted across his mind. Determination would bring success and
success meant his elevation to the pedestal of a popular
hero.</p>

<p>It has been said that Mr. Pell was not built for violent
exercise. It is therefore to his credit that he travelled the
intervening space, to the main road, in record time. There, he
found his luck had not deserted him. A public car was loitering
along the street. Hailing it, Mr. Pell sank wearily on the
cushions.</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>It was a simple question, but it might have been the riddle of
the Sphinx for all the answer Mr. Pell could supply. He had seen
his prey drive off in a motor car, and the impulse had been to
obtain, as quickly as possible, a similar vehicle. He had not
heard the spy give any directions to the driver of the car. But
was a patriot to be hampered by such trifles? The first thing was
to get on the track again.</p>

<p>"Drive down Thomas Street to King's Park Road corner and pull
up on the left hand near corner."</p>

<p>Simple as the answer was it showed the trained brain of the
commercial magnate. He would not foul the trail by crossing it
with his own. He would get on the very spot the other car had
started from while the scent lay in its virgin purity. Then he
would act.</p>

<p>The car pulled up with a jerk. Mr. Pell jumped out and told
the driver to descend and follow him. He crossed the road to
where the other car had halted and bent to examine the ground.
There was the mark of the tyres of the spy's car.</p>

<p>"You see those marks," said Mr. Pell in a hoarse whisper.
"What car made them?"</p>

<p>"Blimey," said the man, "you ain't askin' nothin'. If its the
make of tyre yer want its a Firestone."</p>

<p>"Then follow it!"</p>

<p>"Hey? I aint no bloomin' Sherlock 'olmes. Say, wots the game,
mister?"</p>

<p>"It's a German spy," explained Mr. Pell rapidly. "There are
the tracks of his car. Follow them!"</p>

<p>"Well!" The man took off his cap and scratched his head. "I
aint sayin' I've hany time for the blanky Germans, but business
is business and if yer up to paying the piper, I'm on."</p>

<p>"Go ahead!" Mr. Pell felt he had gained a recruit in the great
game.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell's knowledge of motor cars was not profound. It had
been chiefly obtained by the hire of a car at infrequent
intervals to impress some business acquaintance. Thus it was that
when the driver frequently stopped and descended to examine the
road, Mr. Pell felt matters were running smoothly and that soon
he would again sight his quarry.</p>

<p>Passing swiftly through Rokeby Road, the car ran through some
by-streets into the riverside road to Peppermint Grove. At the
Grove the driver turned into Leake Street, and crossing the
railway ran up to Cottesloe. At the Pier end there was no signs
of the quarry and the driver pulled up and awaited orders.</p>

<p>"Are you certain he passed this way?" asked Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"Certain? Sure." The man was emphatic.</p>

<p>"Then we've lost him." Mr. Pell felt his energy had been
wasted. Had he bungled in any way. No, he felt he had conducted
himself in the best private detective manner. It had been a piece
of ill-luck. Would he have another chance?</p>

<p>"Yer ain't going to chuck it, mister?" enquired the driver,
who felt he had a good thing on.</p>

<p>"What can I do?"</p>

<p>"We might have a run around and see if we can pick him up
again."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell assented. There might yet be hope.</p>

<p>They made a futile search through Cottesloe Beach and North
Fremantle. There was no car in that neighbourhood in any way
resembling that at Thomas Street. Then with waning hope Mr. Pell
directed the driver to turn and run towards North Beach.</p>

<p>"It strikes me I've' gone dotty," reproachfully confessed the
driver. "If I'd given my thinkin' box a try I'd have known it was
North Beach way he would have turned."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell did not like to say that if the apparatus named had
been tried a few miles earlier, his goods might have been saved
considerably.</p>

<p>Passing Osborne, the driver pulled up abruptly and descended.
A short examination of the ground and he returned to the car and
swung the headlights on to a certain part of the road. Descending
again, this time accompanied by Mr. Pell, be made a further
examination.</p>

<p>"Blow me tight, guv'nor. We've done the trick. This 'ere's the
same identical car mark yer pointed out at Suby."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell grew excited.</p>

<p>"Drive on! Catch him and I'll give you ten pounds!"</p>

<p>Surmounting a dip in the cliff, the driver pointed out a small
light in the distance. It looked like a powerful search light
streaming out to sea, and it appeared to come from a small rise
about a quarter of a mile ahead. Seeing it, the driver stopped
his engine and put out his headlights.</p>

<p>"It's them, sure enough guv'nor. Look at the way it's dancing.
Sure, yer ought to have the Victoria Cross!"</p>

<p>Cautiously he let in the engine and slowly they crawled on in
the dark towards the slender beam of light. It was behaving in a
most peculiar manner; First it appeared to flash on the clouds
and then on the sea. Then it swung to right and left. At times it
disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>"It's some code they're usin'," affirmed the driver. "Do yer
understand the Morse code, mister? If so, you'll read it
easy."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell confessed he did not know any signalling code.</p>

<p>"It's a pity," said the driver "I'd like to 'ave known what
the blighters were a-sayin' of."</p>

<p>The spy's car was just over the crest of the hill. Out of
sight Mr. Pell's driver stopped the car and Mr. Pell alighted.
Using the most extreme caution Mr. Pell and the driver crept to
the crest and looked over. A large car was drawn across the road
with the headlights pointed out to sea. One had been cut out and
the other, which appeared to be on a moveable bracket, was worked
by a young man, who stood at the side of the car. The driver of
the car was in his seat and the engines purred softly.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell pulled out his notebook and took down the signs, as
well as he could in the dark. The performance continued for some
ten minutes, and then from out of the darkness of the sea came an
answering light. Thrice it shone, and then was extinguished.</p>

<p>"I'll be damned," observed the driver in a husky whisper in
Mr. Pell's ear. "If 'e ain't got a German warship out there."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell silently confirmed the opinion. He could not find
time to speak, for the man at the car had again started to
signal.</p>

<p>"We'd better be goin', guv'nor," exclaimed the driver at last.
"See, 'e's lit 'is other lamp and 'e'll 'ave to come this way.
Let's 'ook it."</p>

<p>Quickly turning the car, Mr. Pell was rapidly taken towards
Cottesloe. At the Ocean Beach Hotel the driver stopped.</p>

<p>"'E can take the lead," he explained to Mr. Pell. "Let's 'ave
a drink, mister. This 'ere spy-catching is dusty work."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell sympathised. Warning the driver to be on the alert,
he went into the hotel and returned with a large drink for the
man. Just then the other car drove up and stopped. The young man
descended and entered the hotel bar. Mr. Pell followed him, and
the driver followed Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>The spy did not seem at all concerned. He spent a few minutes
conversing with the barman, then finished his drink and left the
bar, closely followed by Mr. Pell. Jumping into his car he drove
off, again with Mr. Pell in close attendance.</p>

<p>The two cars made for the Perth-Fremantle Road. The spy was in
a powerful car and rapidly left Mr. Pell in the rear. There
seemed every prospect that he would escape, and Mr. Pell's driver
heartily cursed his machine. At Karrakatta however, Mr. Pell
again sighted his prey, who seemed to have developed engine
troubles. At Subiaco station the two cars were less than a
hundred yards apart, and the spy was apparently heading for
Perth. Just before reaching the Children's Hospital, the spy
turned to the left and threading some quiet streets, drew up at a
house in Queen's Drive Road. Mr. Pell took careful note of the
house, and then ordered his driver to take him to the Quicksands
Ferry Stage.</p>

<p>It had been a hard night's work, yet one that Mr. Pell was
quite satisfied with. He felt that even if he could not serve his
country in the field he would, and could, do good work at home.
The tracking of the German spy had not been an adventurous
business. The man had at no time showed that he knew he was
followed, and in the pocket book of Mr. Pell was information that
would certainly bring him to a retributive Court martial. Mr.
Pell felt vindictive. He thought he would like to see the end of
the matter. Where would the execution be and was he, as chief
witness, entitled to be present? Full of plans for the future, in
which spies tracked down by his cunning were condemned to
lingering deaths, and the rewards he would receive for his
labours, Mr. Pell fell asleep.</p>

<p>Early next morning Mr. Pell sat down to an attempt to decipher
the flash signs he had copied down the previous night. There were
not many of them, and they read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="typewriter">LLRLL RLRLR LRLLL LRRLR LLLLL RLLLL RRLRR
LLLLR LRRLR LRRRL RRLLL LLLLR RLRR RRLR.</p>

<p>It looked a hopeless jumble, but Mr. Pell did not despair. He
tried the letters several ways, but somehow they did not seem to
fit into any of the rules of ciphers he had read of. Counting the
'R's' and the 'L's' he found he had 37 'L's' and only 30 'R's'!
He also discovered that any amount of 'L's' and 'R's' did not
make any other letters of the alphabet, whatever the combination.
One peculiar thing he noticed, and that was that most of the
'L's' were at the beginning of the line and the 'R's' held the
majority at the end.</p>

<p>At lunch time he was no further forward towards the solution
of the problem. During the afternoon he had another attempt, and
finally decided he would have to let someone else share the
honour of exposing the German spy methods in Western
Australia.</p>

<p>Packing up his precious notebook and his attempts at
deciphering, he determined to lay the results before the police.
Leaving the ferry he ran into the arms of Mr. Smithers of the
<i>Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" queried Mr. Smithers abruptly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" countered Mr. Pell feeling almost
guilty.</p>

<p>"You've got something on that distorted conscience of yours,
Pell," retorted Smithers. "I can see it. Now hand it out at
once."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell reflected. After all, the police are a jealous body.
They discourage all attempts of the public to help them, and if
there was anything in the cipher it was more than likely they
would keep it to themselves and deprive him of the glory. He
decided to trust Smithers.</p>

<p>"Come out of the crowd," he whispered, "and I will tell you
all about it."</p>

<p>"Thought I could read your rotten old head," quoth Smithers,
following him on to the Esplanade. "What's the game?"</p>

<p>In a few hurried sentences, Mr. Pell laid the matter before
Mr. Smithers.</p>

<p>"Glory! It's a scoop!" exclaimed the journalist. "Come on to
the office."</p>

<p>At the <i>Advertiser</i> office the heads of the department
were called into consultation. None of them could read the
cipher, but all agreed it looked most suspicious. There was a
dearth of news that night, and the proprietors, who had been
hastily summoned by telephone, decided to make it a "star"
feature for the next day's issue.</p>

<p>The next morning the <i>Advertiser</i> revealed the whole
history of the German spy methods in Western Australia to the
public. It was a great article. The information supplied was
exact, and hardly creditable to the authorities, who, if they,
had possessed eyes, should have seen a great deal more than they
had, or had Mr. Pell. Mr. Smithers, reading his article with his
morning cup of tea, decided to ask for a rise. It might not all
be true but it read well, and who was to know where were the
facts and where was the padding. Mr. Pell, reading the article to
his lady, laid special emphasis on the concluding paragraph.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The facts we have laid before our readers
show the complete ramifications of the German Spy system in this
State. Why have the authorities not taken action before this to
nip this treason in the bud? Why has it been left to a citizen of
this noble city to expose the machinations of our foes in this
land of Freedom? Credit is due to one of the most notable men of
the State, in tracking down the most prominent German spy in our
midst, obtaining his cipher, and handing him over to the
authorities. To-day our worthy citizen, Mr. Peter Pell, is the
most popular hero in the Commonwealth. In the early days of the
war he volunteered his services, but was rejected owing to
physical disabilities. He has made ample amends for those
disabilities by the tracking down of one of the most complete spy
systems that ever existed in a free and democratic country. The
public calls on the Government to mark its appreciation of Mr.
Pell's self-sacrifice in some signal manner."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell spent the day in the city and thoroughly enjoyed
himself. It is a good thing to be a popular here. His hand was
sore with the handshaking he had to accomplish. His head whirled
with the congratulations and questions poured on him from every
quarter. There was to be a public dinner in his honour by the
leading business men of the State, and towards the end of the day
he learned, from an admiring friend, that the Governor had
determined to recommend him to the King for a knighthood.</p>

<p>In the eyes of Mrs. Pell his status had changed. Gradually the
calls of Society had compelled that lady to somewhat neglect the
husband she had won. His opinions and beliefs, once so honoured
and potent, had lately bean disregarded. Now all was changed. Mr.
Pell was <i>it</i> in the State, and <i>it</i> at home.</p>

<p>Late in the day Mr. Pell received a latter from Messrs Stack
&amp; Co. He had not seen Mr. Stack that day and he opened the
letter expecting some appreciation from his friend, who held such
firm opinions on the German Spy question. The letter was
short.</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Pell,<br> <br> Below is a translation of
the cipher you so gallantly discovered and published in this
morning's <i>Advertiser</i>. You somehow started in the middle.
Thanks for the advertisement,<br> <br> Yours, Stack.<br> <br>
uicksand's Bay Estate Now Buy Q.</p>

<p>What did it mean?</p>

<p>Slowly the truth filtered through the fog of words. "Buy
Quicksand's Bay Estate Now!"</p>

<p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;The warship's searchlight was
probably the light-house at Rottnest&mdash;S.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">X. &mdash; THE PURSUIT OF AN
ELECTORATE</a></h2>

<p class="first">A DISTINCT coolness existed between Mr. Peter
Pell and Mr. Smithers of the <i>Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>"You sold us badly, Pell," said Mr. Smithers severely.</p>

<p>"You got your ad. and a lot of good may it do you." Mr. Pell
tried to explain, but the journalist would not listen. It is one
matter to serve the motherland in the detection and exposure of
the German spy system, and it is quite another to assist in the
free advertisement of a Land Agency. That the public in general
was not taken into the confidence of the parties in this argument
was entirely due to the native modesty of the
<i>Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>A newspaper has a great dislike to contradicting news it has
published. Writers who have never had the privilege of working
for a newspaper have wasted a considerable amount of paper and
ink on tales of rival newspaper endeavouring to best each other.
It is a fallacy. There are only a few competent journalists in
each town, and it is not to their interests to antagonise any
newspaper proprietor against them. They have a keen eye to the
main chance, and any information that might seriously injure a
rival newspaper is shelved. They might be on the staff of that
paper one day.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Mr. Stack's brilliant scheme to cause the
downfall of Mr. Pell and the glorification of the lots of the
Quicksands Bay Estate he held, became a total failure. As far as
word of mouth would carry, that gentleman told the tale against
Mr. Pell. Some believed, and some did not.</p>

<p>Finally the affair faded into oblivion. Mr. Pell remained the
popular hero, and Mr. Stack, as became the villain, tore his
hair. He also, as became the same character, swore vengeance.</p>

<p>Throughout the tenor of this world-wide war it has been the
fashion in Australia, at intervals, to declare the nation in dire
peril. Then certain persons stand up and declare they are
standing up to "win the war." They have not yet explained what
the other chaps are doing. If they are out to assist, or to
<i>lose</i> the war. They leave that for their opponents to
decide. What they say is that the war must be won and they are
the men to do it.</p>

<p>It has also become the practice of the unguileful electors to
cheer the man who utters this illuminating phrase and to
immediately demand that the polling booths be opened that they
may give full vent to their feelings. The "Win the War" party are
always ready to oblige. It is certainly easier to count
favourable votes than to put theories into practice.</p>

<p>It was about three months after the episode of the German spy,
and about the time that Mr. Pell was daily expecting to receive
from someone in the Old Country a prepaid package enclosing a
knighthood, or some such interesting memento, that the Prime
Minister decided that his party must "Win the War" again.</p>

<p>It had been a long time since the slogan had resounded through
the States. In the interim there had been a strike of some
magnitude with the usual party recriminations of "bully" and
"traitor," and, unfortunately, the other party had had the cry of
"bully."</p>

<p>Australians, as a body, are rather easily led by a sounding
party cry, and when that cry expresses the opinion of anything
affecting democracy, as the Australians understand it, it is apt
to grow in favour. Therefore the necessity of bringing forward
the well worn "Win the War" shibboleth.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had been the warm supporter of the Prime Minister in
the "Win the War" policy. He ardently desired that the war should
be won. The Prime Minister and his colleagues had decided to win
the war. The other party had not. That was enough for Mr. Pell.
He was willing to help the "Win the War" party.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister declared for a General Election. It is
always better to meet a sympathising electorate than an
unsympathising Parliament. With the "Win the War" cry well to the
fore, there is every chance of getting rid of some of the
recalcitrants while, if they still exist after the polling fray,
well, there is not much harm done. A few thousands of pounds have
been spent, but it is good for trade, and Australia is the
richest country in the world&mdash;counting heads.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell decided to support the Prime Minister. He also
decided to contest the South Perth electorate in the Federal
House of Representatives. He expressed this determination to Mrs.
Pell, but the lady was not sympathetic. He repeated his
determination to Mr. Smithers, who spoke emphatically, and
unkindly, on the subject of the purity of Parliament. Yet Mr.
Pell held to his determination and announced his candidature to
the admiring electors.</p>

<p>For some reason or other Mr. Pell's candidature was well
received locally. Quicksands Bay was solidly in his favour. He
had made that rising suburb from a wilderness of bush. Was it not
likely that if he was returned to Parliament he would continue
that work. Quicksands Bay desired a railway. It required a better
ferry service. It required half a hundred things that no other
suburb ever thought of possessing. Mr. Pell, in moments of
confidence, promised everything.</p>

<p>At this time the Commonwealth Parliament and the State
Parliament were at variance. The Commonwealth had built a railway
from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. The State had promised that if
that railway was built it would continue the line to the ocean at
Fremantle. That promise the State now declined to perform, on the
flimsy pretext that it had no funds. Thus it happened that that
deluded passenger from Sydney to Fremantle had to change
carriages a number of times. Some authorities said thrice, some
more. Anyhow there were changes, whatever the number, and to be
shunted out of a comfortable carriage at some unearthly hour, to
find a problematical train to continue the journey in, is not
interesting.</p>

<p>It had been the intention of the State, when the East to West
railway existed only on paper, to continue the railway to
Fremantle on the south side of the Swan. This would have created
a new Perth on the south side of the river and, incidentally, hit
many vested interests on the north side.</p>

<p>While the railway was building, the State talked about
widening the existing Kalgoorlie line. This pleased the Perthites
and roused the South Perthites to frenzy. Mr. Pell, contesting
the South Perth seat, declared for the South Swan route to
Fremantle. This brought adherents from the Canning and South
Perth districts.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Pell held his first public meeting he was a strong
favourite for the seat. Mrs. Pell decided she had some time to
spare from her social engagements to conduct the proceedings of
the Ladies' Committees. Mr. Stack, who had lately come to live at
Quicksands Bay, openly stated that he preferred Mr. Pell, the
"Win the War" candidate, to the opposition candidate, who
declined to say more than if the war was to wait until the Prime
Minister, assisted by Mr. Pell, won it, the end of the world
might happen first.</p>

<p>The <i>Advertiser</i> was in a parlous position. As the
leading "Win the War" newspaper of the State it had to uphold the
candidature of Mr. Pell, but it did not like it. At first it held
severely aloof. Then, when Mr. Pell, in one day, received the
accolade of the "Win the War" party as their official candidate,
and an autograph letter from the Prime Minister recommending him
to the electors, they had to recognise an unpleasant fact. They
accepted Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>Up to the date of the closing of nominations it looked as
though there was to be a straight issue in the electorate between
Mr. Pell as the "Win the War" candidate, and his official
opponent. Then, at the last minute, appeared a dark horse. Mr.
Bathers of the "Down with the Germans" party nominated. The
newcomer was likely to cost Mr. Pell many votes. There is
something very alluring in a new and unknown quality. Nobody knew
much of the "Down with the Germans" party. It had a programme,
but nobody, least of all Mr. Bathers, seemed to know much about
it.</p>

<p>At his first political meeting he spoke of a great number of
things: of the shortage of luxuries and the evil of protection
and, most of all, of the drink question. In fact many unwary
persons went from that meeting under the impression that Mr.
Bathers and his party were going to "Down with the Germans" by
prohibiting the sale of Australian lager beer throughout the
Commonwealth. Yet Mr. Bathers won support, and as his star
ascended, so did that of Mr. Pell descend.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell held a meeting of supporters. It was a gorgeous feed,
and the liquor would have made Mr. Bathers' hair stand on end.
Towards the close of the meeting many of Mr. Pell's supporters
were not quite clear on the subject of the meeting. A few of the
more advanced thought that it had been decided to drown Mr.
Bathers in Mr. Pell's whisky, and were duly doubtful if the
requisite quantity could be spared. Mr. Stack led the chorus in
proclaiming that Mr. Pell was "a jolly good fellow" and Mr. Pell
replied by returning thanks for his election from the front door
step.</p>

<p>Meeting Mr. Pell on the ferry the next morning Mr. Stack hoped
he had got home all right on the previous night, and then said
"Quite well, thank you." It was a most successful meeting.</p>

<p>Mature reflection caused Messrs Pell and Stack to declare that
something must be done immediately. Until they reached the Perth
landing stage they left it at that. Neither felt in the mood to
proceed further with the subject. On the stage they found Mr.
Smithers waiting. He greeted the twain sourly.</p>

<p>"Something will have to be done, Pell," he declared bitterly.
"That man, Bathers, is running away from you."</p>

<p>"Just what I said to Pell," declared Stack emphatically.
"Didn't I, Pell."</p>

<p>"We'll have to put our heads together," said Pell. Mr. Stack
dissented. He said his head was not in a condition to be placed
in close proximity with anything that morning.</p>

<p>"The trouble is," said Mr. Smithers fiercely, "you chaps want
a drink." Mr. Smithers had no hesitation in giving the
prescription. As a working journalist of the leading newspaper of
the State, he never bought drinks on principle.</p>

<p>"You're going to lose this election, Pell," pronounced Mr.
Smithers, sampling the liquor before him.</p>

<p>"Just what I said this morning," agreed Mr. Stack.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," responded Mr. Pell, clearing a right-of-way
with a lone whisky and soda. "Fill up these glasses again please,
Miss."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers looked from one to the other with envy. "You
chaps must have had a giddy night out."</p>

<p>"I thought we should win last night," continued Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"Just what I said last night," agreed Mr. Stack.</p>

<p>"We had better have a Committee meeting tonight at your
house," suggested Mr. Smithers.</p>

<p>"No!" Mr. Pell was emphatic. "I don't believe in them two
nights running. Besides Mrs. Pell objects to the noise."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have think of something, Pell," said Mr.
Smithers. "The chief is hot on your winning now we have backed
you. Do you hear? You've got to win."</p>

<p>"I told him that last night and again this morning," agreed
Mr. Stack, weakly beckoning to the young lady on the other side
of the counter. Mr. Smithers waited until the bottles had
completed their work and had been replaced on the shelf.</p>

<p>"It comes to this, Pell," he remarked. "You're an old hand at
the bluff game. I'm not going to deny it. You've taken us in and
you've taken in Stack here. Now you've got to put up a joke
that'll take in the electors."</p>

<p>"Just what I said this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Stack, you're drunk," retorted Smithers
rudely.</p>

<p>"Just what I said to Pell this morning," agreed Mr. Stack,
looking at a row of decanters through the bottom of his
glass.</p>

<p>Taking Mr. Pell by the arm Mr. Smithers steered him out into
the street leaving Mr. Stack in the bar.</p>

<p>"You've got both the blanky papers in the town on your side in
this election. That should count for something," Mr. Smithers
explained. "But it won't count for much if you're going to get
drunk every night of the campaign. Pull yourself together, Pell,
and think&mdash;think&mdash;think!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell thought. For some moments he thought. Then he
wondered why the top of Viking House would insist on bowing to
him. He took off his hat gravely and returned the salutation. The
building bowed again and Mr. Pell again reciprocated.</p>

<p>"When you've done with that girl," observed Mr. Smithers
bitterly, "we'll get back to business."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a girl," said Mr. Pell. "It was a house."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers looked grave. "Here, come along to the
chemist."</p>

<p>"No, wait!" commanded Mr. Pell. "I've thought of
something."</p>

<p>Steering unsteadily into a quiet corner Mr. Pell whispered in
Mr. Smithers' ear. That gentleman dissented vigorously, but Mr.
Pell insisted.</p>

<p>"It might work," said Mr. Smithers at length, reluctantly.
"But Lor', the risk."</p>

<p>"Just you go back and hang on to old Stack for the time,"
commanded Mr. Pell. "I'll go to the Club and sleep off some of
this. Meet you in a couple of hours."</p>

<p>Steering carefully towards the third person singular whenever
he met anyone, Mr. Pell proceeded down the Terrace towards his
Club. Mr. Smithers looked after him jealously and then went back
to Mr. Stack. He found that gentleman trying to sell to the bar
belle a Quicksands Bay lot for love on the instalment plan.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mr. Pell left the lavatory of the Club with
the bald spot on the top of his head shining ruddily, and
proceeded to the telephone. He had a short conversation with Lady
Smith-Jones that appeared to result satisfactorily. Punctual to
time Mr. Smithers entered the Club.</p>

<p>Contrasted with Mr. Pell's happy face, he did not appear to be
in the best of spirits.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"It isn't well," replied Mr. Smithers vigorously. "That fool
Stack is still carrying on in the hotel. He told me to go
to&mdash;eh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly," agreed Mr. Pell amiably. "I should have done the
same myself a while ago."</p>

<p>"Then why did you send me back to him?" Mr. Smithers was
perplexed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was to keep you out of mischief," replied Mr.
Pell. "Do you know I have lost all faith in Election
Committees."</p>

<p>"You didn't appear to think that last night."</p>

<p>"Quite so." Mr. Pell smiled reminiscently. "It was a great
evening. Stack told me I returned thanks for my election from my
front doorstep."</p>

<p>"You won't have a doorstep to return thanks from, if you don't
win this election. What the Hades Hughes was thinking of to give
you the official recognition is more than I can understand."</p>

<p>"Don't grouse, Smithers," Mr. Pell smiled genially, as he took
the arm of the journalist and led him out to the Terrace.</p>

<p>"Where are we going to?"</p>

<p>"To see a few friends of Mr. Bathers."</p>

<p>It was a busy morning and Mr. Smithers felt be deserved the
drink Mr. Pell finished the business with. He had not understood
much of what he had heard. Most of the references had been
complimentary in the extreme to Mr. Bathers, yet most of the
interviews had been with persons unable to vote in the
electorate. At intervals he had questioned his guide but had
received only ambiguous replies.</p>

<p>Returning to the Club Mr. Pell wrote a few letters and then
dictated a short statement to Mr. Smithers that left that
gentleman in a greater maze than before. He expostulated but Mr.
Pell would have none of it. In the plainest language he intimated
to Mr. Smithers that it was his election and he would run it as
he jolly well liked and that that eminent journalist was to do as
he was told.</p>

<p>The <i>Advertiser</i> the following morning contained a
paragraph to the effect that Mr. Pell had approached Mr. Bathers
with the proposal that they should combine their forces for the
overthrow of the Official Labor Candidate. In the electorate this
news was received with the greatest enthusiasm, except among the
supporters of the Labor man. Those gentlemen felt that the ground
had been unfairly cut from under their feet. Before midday, large
posters appeared on all the hoardings announcing that, on the
following night, Messrs Pell and Bathers would hold their grand
combined final rally in the Quicksands Bay Agricultural Hall,
recently presented to the district by Mr. Pell. There the two
speakers were to complete the undoing of the Labor Candidate.</p>

<p>Interest as to the result of the meeting was intense and the
audience promised to be a record one for any political meeting in
Australia. Mr. Stack was advertised to take the chair. There were
some unkind persons in and out of the electorate who begged the
question by asking what result the combined meeting was expected
to attain. They drew attention to the fact that the electorate
could only return one member and if Messers Pell and Bathers
annihilated their Labor opponent they would then have not decided
the issue between themselves. Some of these politicians were
Pellites and some were Batherites.</p>

<p>Although the leaders had agreed to combine, it was most
evident that their followers had agreed to continue to differ. It
has been said that it is the habit of Australians to fight their
political battles with their coats off. Even Americans, who are
known the wide world over as a most politically enthusiastic
race, cannot impart into the bloodless fray more vim than
Australians. But with Australians it is not a question of vim.
They have to take off their coats, as their leaders insist on the
elections being held in the hot weather season. It makes
electioneering so much more strenuous.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but that Mr. Pell quite outshone his
political opponent at the Grand Rally. In the first place he was
a much more imposing platform figure. Mr. Bathers was quite a
small man, and wore glasses of the famous literary
type&mdash;big, round and peering. His shoulders were rounded and
he had a high and squeaky voice.</p>

<p>In a comparison of speeches Mr. Pell had no advantage, while
he spread himself over many phrases of Social life. He roused his
audience to wrath and enthusiasm on the shortcomings of the
Commonwealth Government and its neglect of Western Australian
needs. He promised if he was elected he would see that the State
Government toed the line in reference to the Ferry Service. He
declared for a Southern Swan expansion of the Transcontinental
Railway. If the State would not do its duty in this respect then
he, the speaker, would see that the Commonwealth Government built
the line.</p>

<p>Mr. Bathers confined his speech to one subject only. He was
eloquent on the subject of drink. He would shut all the public
houses. He would turn the breweries into homes for inebriates.
The curse of drink must be banished from the State.</p>

<p>It cannot but be acknowledged that Mr. Bathers made the most
popular speech. He was cheered to the echo when he sat down. The
evils of the drink traffic is most popular with a West Australian
audience. A speaker who can harrow the feelings of his audience
by depicting the evils resulting from a too constant attention to
the goods of "Mr. Host" is sure of a close attention and a most
enthusiastic welcome. Yet in Western Australia there is little
doubt that a vast majority of the inhabitants would vote
vigorously against Prohibition. Some of Mr. Pell's supporters
were displeased that he did not deal with the drink question. At
some of the previous meetings, Mr. Bathers had made considerable
capital by referring to Mr. Pell as a&mdash;well shall we say,
non-teetotaller. Mr. Pell had refrained from retorting, and by
his action in making the first advances for combined action, to a
man who had so pilloried him, had secured him much sympathy.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening before the candidates had finished
their speeches, but none of the audience moved. There had spread
a rumour that something uncommon was to happen and rumour was
agog. It had gone round that Mr. Pell had proposed a solution to
the two candidates one seat puzzle. After the candidates had
refreshed themselves from the water bottle on the chairman's
table, Mr. Stack rose to close the meeting. He referred to both
candidates impartially. He thanked them in the name of the
audience for the intellectual treat they had given. He referred
to the disability the electors laboured under, in not being able
to return to the Federal parliament both candidates. It was
invidious to have to choose between so much ability, but that
soulless body, who framed the Australian constitution, had not
allowed for such a position. One candidate would have to be
chosen and the other rejected. In most scathing terms, Mr. Stack
referred to the Labor candidate. He was not a "Win the War" man.
He had no policy that an Australian and an upholder of the Empire
could accept. He had dared to ask the suffrage of the electors of
South Perth, and, to the shame of those electors, it appeared
from the canvass made that he had a considerable following.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen who had addressed the electors that night
had decided that there should be no preferential voting. It was
to be a straight fight, win or lose between the Labor candidate
and the "Win the War" candidate. He, Mr. Stack, was happy to say
that Mr. Bathers had adopted the "Win the War" slogan as one of
his battle cries. Mr. Pell had taken that inspiring phrase as his
one and only platform.</p>

<p>Lowering his voice impressively, Mr. Stack informed the
audience that they were to have the inestimable privilege of that
night deciding who was to carry the "Win the War" banner to
victory. By their vote they were to retire one of the candidates.
They were to choose between Mr. Pell and Mr. Bathers. If their
vote that evening was given to Mr. Pell, then Mr. Bathers had
pledged himself to withdraw from the poll and loyally assist Mr.
Pell in "Winning the War." If, on the other hand, they decided
that Mr. Bathers was the better candidate&mdash;he could not be
so invidious as to say "man"&mdash;then Mr. Pell had given a
similar pledge.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of Mr. Stack's speech both candidates bowed
their pledges to the audience. Three times Mr. Stack tried to get
a decision by a show of hands and failed. Then the candidates
decided on a poll. Scrutineers were appointed and every person in
the room handed a voting paper, generously provided, in
anticipation, by Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>It was close upon midnight before the scrutineers finished
their work and Mr. Stack declared the result:</p>

<p>Mr. Bathers 248<br> Mr. Pell 240<br> Majority for Mr. Bathers
8</p>

<p>It was noticed on his return home Mr. Pell did not look unduly
depressed at his failure. He received the condolences of his
friends and supporters with becoming gravity, and after quieting
the lamentations of Mr. Stack, retired to the privacy of his
chamber and the admonitions of Mrs. Pell.</p>

<p>The <i>Advertiser</i> made a great splash with the news the
following day. On the same day appeared an interview with Mr.
Pell, in which that gentleman declared that he intended loyally
to abide by the decision of the meeting. He would support Mr.
Bathers. On the Terrace Mr. Pell had to run the gauntlet of many
inquisitive persons who thought the latest method of choosing
candidates somewhat informal. Mr. Stack appeared at his office
with a gloomy air and answered enquiries shortly, and with little
courtesy.</p>

<p>"You've cooked your goose, Pell, this time," said Mr. Smithers
gloomily. He was enjoying the hospitality of Mr. Pell in his
club. "What induced you to get up such a silly game? You told me
you were sure to win."</p>

<p>"And I lost." Mr. Pell did not appear unduly downcast by his
defeat.</p>

<p>"You lost, that's a cert." Mr. Smithers was emphatic. "You
know I was never very sweet on you for South Swan, but you're
certainly better than that ass, Bathers."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'm better out of politics," said Mr. Pell
reflectively. "I don't understand the game."</p>

<p>"Well, I only hope you don't go back into what you call
business, Pell," observed Mr. Smithers rising to his toil. "We
don't want you there."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was not in a hurry to place his resignation in the
hands of the returning officer. He cancelled the remainder of his
meetings and spoke once or twice for Mr. Bathers, adopting that
gentleman's platform with enthusiasm. So greatly did he succeed
as a temperance speaker, that many of Mr. Bathers supporters
began to consider him as one of the shining lights of the
movement and spoke of him as the probable leader when Mr. Bathers
retired to represent South Swan in Melbourne.</p>

<p>The night before the election, Mr. Bathers announced that he
would hold his final meeting at the South Perth Town Hall. With a
clear field he had made considerable progress with the
electorate, and it was considered by experts that he would beat
his Labour opponent by at least a thousand votes. To make a good
show, and partly because he found his voice had not stood the
strain any too well, he requested the help of Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>That Gentleman gladly undertook to relieve his late opponent
of the greater part of the strain and to again urge his personal
supporters to vote for Mr. Bathers. During the morning Mr. Pell
was extremely busy. He had several long and confidential
interviews with Lady Smith-Jones. At midday he returned home, as
he said, to recuperate for his evening's exertions.</p>

<p>Scientists tell us that there are still many forces of nature
of which we have but very indifferent knowledge. Perhaps one of
these forces is that commonly known as "Dame Rumour." Certainly
it is, that during the afternoon of that day, rumour was busy
with the name of Mr. Bathers first, there was a hint of his
political stability, but no one thought seriously of that.
Political stability is at a discount throughout the Commonwealth,
and even Prime Ministers are not immune. Than someone started the
rumour that he had left the country. A few people who had seen
the candidate that day wrote vigorous denials in the evening
papers. Mr. Bathers' agent went so far as to offer a reward for
information leading to the conviction of the instigator of these
rumours. The only effect of all the talk was to draw a very large
audience to the South Perth Town Hall. Mr. Stack was to take the
chair.</p>

<p>Punctually at eight o'clock in the evening Mr. Stack, followed
by the supporters of the candidate, mounted the platform and was
greeted with cheers. Mr. Pell came in for a great ovation. There
was no Mr. Bathers. Mr. Stack opened the proceedings with a
somewhat lengthy speech made with one eye on the side door,
through which he hoped to see Mr. Bathers appear any moment.
Finally when the patience of the audience was nearly exhausted,
Mr. Stack was not a good speaker, he apologised for the temporary
absence of the candidate and called oh Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>By some of the audience at that meeting it has been said that
Mr. Pell made the speech of his life. He started with an
exposition of the political creed of Mr. Bathers, and then at the
request of the audience he branched off to the needs of the
district he had made peculiarly his own. He denounced the path of
both Governments. He&mdash;then he stopped.</p>

<p>A messenger was pushing his way through the audience towards
the platform. He held in his hand a large white letter. All eyes
were turned in his direction. Slowly he forged forward and placed
the letter in the hands of the chairman. Mr. Stack fitted his
glasses to his nose and opened the letter. The audience held its
breath and waited.</p>

<p>Mr. Stack arose to his feet. Mr. Pell sat down.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen and ladies," said Mr. Stack, "Mr. Bathers has
written to me a letter that is&mdash;er&mdash;astounding. It
is&mdash;er&mdash;remarkable in the annals of elections in this
state. It is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Read it! Read it!" the cries came from all parts of the
hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Stack smoothed the letter carefully. "Er&mdash;er&mdash;As
you request I will read what Mr. Bathers has to
say.&mdash;Er&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mr. Stack&mdash;I find I cannot get to the
meeting tonight as arranged. I am also afraid I shall have to
resign my candidature for the South Swan seat in the Federal
House of Representatives. The truth is that today a petition in
bankruptcy was filed against me and I am much afraid I shall be
unable to compromise the matter. I am therefore placing my
resignation in your hands,&mdash;Yours faithfully&mdash;J
Bathers."</p>

<p>For some minutes the audience sat in silent wonder. Then a
member of the audience arose.</p>

<p>"Are we to understand that Mr. Bathers cannot contest the
seat."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;am afraid that is so, sir," said Mr. Stark
again examining the letter. "A bankrupt cannot be a member of
Parliament."</p>

<p>"Then as Mr. Pell has withdrawn in favour of Mr. Bathers we,
the electors here assembled, are without a candidate."</p>

<p>"That is so&mdash;er&mdash;I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pell leaned forward and whispered to the chairman but the
questioner had hot finished.</p>

<p>"I move that a vote of censure be passed on Mr. Bathers," he
said. Mr. Stack interposed hurriedly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that would have little effect in getting us out of
the difficulty we are in. I have, however, just learned from Mr.
Pell that while his resignation is written it has, by an
oversight, not been sent. He is therefore eligible to be our
candidate."</p>

<p>As one man the large audience arose. Cheer after cheer
threatened to lift the roof from the walls.</p>

<p>"Pell! Pell! The 'Win the War' Candidate, Pell!"</p>

<p>And he was, by a nine hundred majority.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">XI. &mdash; THE PURSUIT OF A
MONOPOLY</a></h2>

<p class="first">THERE may, one day, live an Australian who will
declare that he has no ambitions in the world of politics; no
ambition to become a member of one of the many Parliaments of
Australia. That he has not sufficient ability to conduct the
affairs of a nation; that he does not aspire to lead his party to
victory at the poll and, on the Government side of the House,
that he does not wish to be sent to Great Britain as Agent
General for his State, or the Commonwealth; that he does not
covet a seat in the British House of Parliament. Such a man may
yet be born of some Australian mother. So far he has not yet been
discovered, and it is probable that if he makes his supreme
renunciation in Western Australia he will be gently but firmly
escorted to the home for the mentally afflicted at Claremont.
Australians are not willing to encourage a revolutionary spirit
in their country.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pell had aspirations. At an early opportunity she
informed her husband that a house in Melbourne was a pure
necessity. Mr. Pell, in the freshness of his triumph, had passed
the matter by without comment, but Mrs. Pell returned to the
attack. Mr. Pell bought a house at once. Six months of political
life convinced Mr. Pell that if he was to realise his
Parliamentary aspirations he must considerably augment his
resources. He was surrounded by men who had made large fortunes
and had come to the Federal centre to enjoy a good time. Mr. Pell
did not like to be out of the running, and a salary as a Member
of the House of Representatives was totally inadequate to meet
his larger expenditure.</p>

<p>At no time in his commercial career had Mr. Pell been at a
loss to conceive a scheme for attracting other people's money
into his pocket. With the fact of the necessity of a larger
income came the natural thoughts of commercial aggression. Most
of these schemes, good as they would have appeared to the Mr.
Peter Pell in the past, were impossible when considered by Mr.
Peter Pell M.H.R. With regret they were placed on one side, with
the exception of one or two which were retained for further
consideration.</p>

<p>Australia is the happy financial ground of the
parliamentarian. Many a man in the history of the nation has
thrown down the pick, or released the throttle of the engine, for
political activity. At the time, he naturally supposes he is to
live on the parliamentary allowance given him by an grateful
country. Later he blossoms out as a squatter of the largest type
and others wonder how it is done.</p>

<p>Casting about for some scheme to augment his income Mr. Pell
came in touch with wealthy philanthropists who desired to benefit
him. They also desired the good of the States and Commonwealth.
They never mentioned their own affairs. If pressed on the subject
they claimed to be amateur politicians, with some commercial
intelligence, willing to place their business ability at the
service of the nation. If the members of the House would vote as
instructed the Commonwealth would benefit in wealth and
importance, and some of that wealth would naturally find its way
into the pockets of the members who had voted so logically.</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Pell tested several of these propositions and
rejected them immediately. He was there to do his best for the
Commonwealth and he would vote for any measure that would advance
the Commonwealth. But, and there was a point where Mr. Pell saw a
very forcible "but," most of these schemes would benefit other
persons to a great extent than they would Mr. Pell or the
Commonwealth. Mr. Pell liked chestnuts, but he had a serious
distaste for the role of monkey.</p>

<p>It was one hot January day that Mr. Pell found the opportunity
he sought. With Mrs. Pell he had returned to his native state for
the Christmas holidays. When a Mr. Waterman was announced, Mr.
Pell groaned thinking he was in for a political interview.</p>

<p>Mr. Waterman was a tall distinguished man of about forty years
of age. He had somewhat the look of an eagle with his high
forehead and hooked nose set between piercing blue eyes. His lips
were straight and close set and barely concealed by an up-brushed
moustache.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pell," he commenced after the usual greetings, "I have
come to you on a serious proposition. Are you willing to consider
a large and profitable commercial adventure?"</p>

<p>It was not an auspicious opening and Mr. Pell's thoughts went
back to the many times he had been approached in almost similar
words. Something of his thoughts must have shown for his visitor
hastened to continue.</p>

<p>"Don't mistake me, Mr. Pell. I am putting no 'boomer' to you.
It is one of the straightest and most profitable propositions in
the State."</p>

<p>"Then why come to me?" Mr. Pell considered he had cornered the
man.</p>

<p>"Because I have watched your commercial life with some
interest and consider you are the man to take my proposition up
and bring it to success."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Oil and Coal."</p>

<p>"I don't understand minerals," remarked Mr. Pell, oblivious of
his past mining deals.</p>

<p>"I do," replied Mr. Waterman. "You can leave that side of the
business to me. I want you to get the concessions from the State,
and work up the political side of the question."</p>

<p>"I don't believe there is oil in the State," remarked Mr.
Pell. "Coal there is, but you will have to show me that you have
your prospect in a place where there are facilities for quick and
cheap transit."</p>

<p>"I can do that," said Mr. Waterman quickly. "Are you on?"</p>

<p>"Where do I come in?" It was a question that Mr. Pell had been
considering from the beginning of the interview.</p>

<p>"Halves," said Mr. Waterman.</p>

<p>They shook hands on the deal.</p>

<p>It was a time of great activity for Mr. Pell. Further
interviews with Mr. Waterman convinced him that that gentleman
had stumbled on a good thing. Questions of shale and bitumen were
settled by an interview with Mr. Waterman at his hotel. From the
samples shown him, Mr. Pell became enthusiastic in the matter.
Coal there was in abundance from the indications. Oil there
probably was, and Mr. Pell saw visions of a new Australian Oil
Company with himself as Managing Director, and the money piling
up hand over fist at the bank. Perhaps he was fated to be the
Australian Rockefeller, controlling the oil supply of the
Southern Hemisphere, and fighting the American monopoly in the
name of humanity&mdash;and his own interests.</p>

<p>In the matter of the concessions Mr. Pell found some trouble.
To Mr. Waterman he complained of the rapacity of the State
Ministers. They stated they were out to do the best for the
interests of the State. They spoke of the Mining Act and the
limitations therein imposed on private ownership. Mr. Pell
retaliated with a glowing account of what he was willing to do
for the State in the matter of coal and oil, if he were allowed
to gently evade the somewhat unwieldy Mining Act.</p>

<p>On that he was faced with the welfare of the Ministers. They
could certainly not over-ride the Act. If they did they would
have the public to fight. The public stood in the way. They would
want to know. And the public, each and every one potential
miners, would ask inquisitive and awkward questions.</p>

<p>Most of these points were discussed with the Attorney-General
of the State. He made it very plain to Mr. Pell that he was in
sympathy with that gentleman's aims. He desired to do all he
could to forward his objects. But the Minister for Mines was
holidaying in the East, and he, the Attorney-General, while
having full power, did not see his way to over ride the Act and
his colleagues.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell spoke of the good to the State.</p>

<p>The Minister replied with a dissertation on the industries of
the South&mdash;West and the damage the oil industry would do to
those industries.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell found himself up against a wall of talk, and having
in the past himself erected like barricades could only grumble
and admire.</p>

<p>"It comes to this, Mr. Pell," concluded the Minister of the
Crown, "we are not in a position to give any extended powers to
private individuals."</p>

<p>"A syndicate would stand on a different footing?" inquired Mr.
Pell.</p>

<p>"That I cannot discuss," said the Minister with an air of
finality. "It would depend on the constitution of the Syndicate.
If it were a Syndicate of prominent men; men high in political
and commercial circles&mdash;we should certainly give the matter
very favourable consideration."</p>

<p>It was a hint and as such Mr. Pell retailed it to his partner
Mr. Waterman. That gentleman was not enthusiastic. He considered
that there was an attempt to shoulder him out of the reward of
his work. On this Mr. Pell felt quite in sympathy with him. At
the present time they each held a half share and if Mr.
Waterman's conclusions were correct they stood to make immense
fortunes. If a Syndicate had to be formed then their shares would
be worth so much less. There could be no doubt but that the State
Ministers were anxious to share in the "good thing."</p>

<p>Further interviews with the Attorney General confirmed this
suspicion. Mr. Pell suggested a Syndicate to explore for oil and
coal over a large expanse of the South&mdash;West of the State.
The Mining Act was to be evaded and certain Ministers were to be
allowed to subscribe to the Syndicate. To this proposition there
was some demur, but finally the Syndicate was formed. Mr.
Waterman said a lot. Mr. Pell said little but his thoughts were
in full agreement with his partner.</p>

<p>After they had received and allotted the shares in the
Syndicate they just managed between them to retain a controlling
interest. It was when the matter of the banking of the Syndicate
funds came under consideration that Mr. Waterman expressed his
greatest disgust. Mr. Pell found the £1,000 capital of the
Syndicate and placed it in the bank. The shareholders forgot to
send in their cheques.</p>

<p>"They'll pay some day," said Mr. Pell hopefully.</p>

<p>"If they don't forget," retorted Mr. Waterman glumly. "They're
the meanest lot of skunks I've ever seen."</p>

<p>"Till then I suppose I must consider the sums as loans,"
continued Mr. Pell, regretfully surveying the butt of his
cheque.</p>

<p>"Then you'd better wipe them off the ledger as bad debts,"
sneered Mr. Waterman, "And they call themselves politicians."</p>

<p>"That's exactly it," replied Mr. Pell, somewhat comforted. It
is a good thing to be a Minister of State. It is good for the
nation and better for the individual. There are so many ways that
a sincere and honest minister can help the State in spite of Acts
of Parliament.</p>

<p>Many people imagine that members of Parliament are paid to
frame Acts, for the public welfare. If that is so, then what need
is there for large and expensive Law Courts? Why do men spend
arduous years training as solicitors and barristers? Why do the
Governments retain large and imposing Public Offices employing
large staffs of officials? No, Parliament is the Puzzle Editor of
the State. It sets the problems, others have to solve them.
Parliament makes an Act, and the lawyers read into that Act
exactly what Parliament did not intend. Parliament makes an Act
and large staffs of officials collect from the general public
monies, in a manner the sage and deliberate members of Parliament
never imagined these sums could be collected. It is a large and
interesting game of puzzle and solve, and the odds all the way
through are on the solvers&mdash;the public pay the stakes.</p>

<p>After the formation of the syndicate some days later, the
Attorney General sent for Mr. Pell and informed him that the
Government would retain to the use of the Western Australian Oil
and Coal Syndicate any area of land desired; a result not
unexpected by Mr. Pell, and he promptly marked off on a map the
area to come under the syndicate. It was only about 500,000
square miles. This land the Government proposed to reserve from
prospecting under the Mining Act and then hand over to the
Syndicate under a special license.</p>

<p>It was a legitimate procedure under the Act, but the
Legislature had certainly never considered giving such wide
powers to the Government.</p>

<p>So far matters had progressed to Mr. Pell's entire
satisfaction. He had secured for his use a considerable portion
of the State, and even if the search for oil and coal proved
abortive, it was more than probable that other minerals would be
discovered that would pay him most generously for the outlay he
proposed to make. It was now up to Mr. Waterman to get to work
and develop the find. But here Mr. Waterman raised objections.
For some time he hesitated and evaded questioning.</p>

<p>Finally he spoke. "You've given away a lot of the prospect,
Mr. Pell," he said, "I don't quite see where I am to come in on
the balance."</p>

<p>"That's easy, Waterman," said Mr. Pell, lying back in his
chair. "You come in with me. We have fifty £100 shares in the
Syndicate of which you are the owner of twenty-five. The others
have gone in the promotion of the Syndicate."</p>

<p>"And the money in the bank?" queried Mr. Waterman.</p>

<p>"That goes to the expenses of the prospecting."</p>

<p>"But I want some cash."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have to want, Waterman," said Mr. Pell
emphatically. "I'm not spending any money at present."</p>

<p>"But I must have money to go on with," protested Mr. Waterman.
"I cannot go down in the bush without my money."</p>

<p>"That's the Syndicate matter," said Mr. Pell. "You'll get your
pay, £85 a week, and your keep. The rest will go for the expense
of boring."</p>

<p>"That's no good to me. I want more."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I want £500 down and £10 a week."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell sat up suddenly. "I say, Waterman," he expostulated.
"That's a bit thick. Why you'll mop up all the money in the
Syndicate."</p>

<p>"Then you had better lend the Syndicate some more, Pell."</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I do," exploded Pell. "I'll go on without
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Waterman laughed. "Go on without me, man," he sneered.
"You would do a lot over that area," and he swept his hand over
the map before them.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell considered for some moments. He realised that for the
first time in his commercial career that he had gone into a
scheme trusting entirely to his partner. He had taken up a large
expanse of the state without any definite knowledge of the
particular spot where Waterman expected to locate coal or oil. In
fact, looking back on the information he had received from that
gentleman he could not state within many miles where the proposed
oil fields lay. He was fairly caught.</p>

<p>With a sigh he realised he would have to pay, and pay
dearly.</p>

<p>"Look here, Waterman," he said at length, "I'll not deny
you've caught me and caught me good. You've got the goods still
and I've planted down my money on a tale. If I play up and smile
can you deliver the goods?"</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"All right then," Mr. Pell sighed again as he drew his cheque
book from his pocket. "I'll treat this as a loan to the
Syndicate." He drew a cheque for £500 and handed it across the
table to Waterman. Then they bent over the maps while Waterman
indicated the location of his finds.</p>

<p>"It looks good," said Pell at length. "When will you
start?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, what about the tools?"</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Pell, "the State are lending us all
we want for nixes. Good old State."</p>

<p>A few days later Mr. Pell returned to Melbourne to his
parliamentary duties and Mr. Watermen left for Albany. For some
time Mr. Pell waited in patience for results that did not come.
Waterman was prolific in reports but none of them were of a
definite nature. To every report was attached a letter asking for
a cheque. Mr. Pell sent the cheques, this time from the balance
to the credit of the Syndicate.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was not happy. Waterman was a most expensive servant
and the funds of the Syndicate dwindled rapidly. On the other
hand frequent letters came from the members of the Syndicate
asking what progress had been made. At first these enquiries were
couched in a friendly tone, but as time and time went on they
became more threatening and the Minister Mr. Windlass had become
almost acrimonious.</p>

<p>Copies of the reports of Mr. Waterman did not serve to pacify
him and he insisted that Mr. Pell returned to Western Australia
and looked into matters personally.</p>

<p>Mr. Windlass apparently considered he had been defrauded, and
that in spite of the fact that Mr. Pell was still awaiting a
cheque from him in payment of his shares in the Syndicate. The
Session was long drawn out and weary. The 'Win the War' Party had
a large majority in both Federal houses and in consequence
debates were conducted with dreary seriousness. There were no No
Confidence motions, no verbal fireworks to enliven the working
days. Mr. Pell felt bored. And there were still the abortive
reports of Mr. Waterman.</p>

<p>Even Parliamentary sessions come to an end, and Mr. Pell
hurried back to his Western home. Hardly had he arrived than he
was summoned to a conference with Mr. Windlass. His reception was
distinctly cool.</p>

<p>"I don't like it, Mr. Pell," said the Minister, "it is not in
our agreement. I don't like it at all."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was understood to say that he was not specially
enamoured of the situation.</p>

<p>"I understood that this man of yours could deliver the goods
at once," continued Mr. Minister, "You distinctly led me to
believe so."</p>

<p>"Waterman told me so," replied Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>"He had no business to have done so." Windlass struck his desk
with his hand. "It has placed me in a most awkward situation.
Most awkward I assure you."</p>

<p>"There is no trouble about the grant?" queried Mr. Pell
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not at present. Not at present," confirmed the Minister, "but
my colleagues are asking questions." Mr. Pell thought of the
shares that had been distributed among these colleagues.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it may become a public question," Mr. Windlass
said impressively. "If so I should have to disavow you and
Waterman."</p>

<p>"That will be difficult." Mr. Pell could not help the
rejoinder. "The Syndicate shares, you know," he explained.</p>

<p>"The Syndicate shares?" queried the Minister with uplifted
brows. "Oh, you mean the shares my brother holds in your
Syndicate. They have nothing to do with me, Mr. Pell. My brother
has no political standing, and the government is not concerned
with his commercial ventures."</p>

<p>"Then you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had you the impression I owned any shares in your Syndicate,
Mr. Pell?" queried the Minister sweetly. "I assure you I have no
interest in the matter except to oblige you."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell felt he had misunderstood Mr. Windlass. That
gentleman was much more wary than he thought.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" he queried. "I don't want you to
do anything," replied Mr. Windlass. "I warn you, however, the
Government will not be able to continue the prospecting licence
much longer."</p>

<p>"That will be rather hard on the Syndicate."</p>

<p>"But unavoidable," said the Minister smoothly. "I in no way
wish to inconvenience you and your friends, but some information
had to become public, and certain persons are using it as a lever
against the Government."</p>

<p>"In exactly what way?"</p>

<p>"There is a man in Perth," continued Mr. Windlass, "who
considers he has a right under the Mining Act to prospect on part
of the area we have granted you. He thinks he knows where there
is coal and oil to be found. We have blocked his applications up
to the present, but he is getting nasty. I'm afraid there is
likely to be trouble with him, and in that case&mdash;?" he
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"In that case you would cancel my permits," completed Mr.
Pell.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that is so, Mr. Pell. Think the matter over and
see what you can do."</p>

<p>With that the Minister dismissed Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>That gentleman left the office in a very depressed frame of
mind. Waterman was still as far off a find as ever, from the
appearance of his reports&mdash;and if the Government cancelled
the grants it would mean that the money Mr. Pell had advanced to
the Syndicate, and Waterman, would be thrown away.</p>

<p>It was the first time Mr. Pell had been had on a business
deal, and he did not like it. Something must be done, to get out
of the matter without further loss, even if there was no chance
of getting his own money back again. Mr. Pell spent the evening
in serious thought.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell's sleep that night was haunted by visions of his lost
five thousand pounds. Waking he determined to wire to Waterman to
return to Perth and wind up the Syndicate. It would be a dead
loss, but in his position as a member of the Federal House of
Parliament he could not allow a scandal unless there was some
compensating advantages. He realised that the State Ministers had
fully protected themselves and, if there was any public exposure
of the manner in which the grant of five hundred thousand square
acres of land had been made, he would have to bear the brunt. Yet
if he closed the venture at once there would be a dead loss.</p>

<p>Could he hold on, or could be foist his share of the venture
on some other person? If the latter was possible then he might be
able to get back at least part of what he had now to consider a
dead loss. A loss! Could not he Pell, get out without a loss? He
would take a little longer for reflection.</p>

<p>It was a mail day and at noon Mr. Pell looked anxiously for a
report from Mr. Waterman. It did not come. During the evening Mr.
Pell again thought deeply. The next day there was no report from
Waterman. Mr. Pell gradually came to the conclusion that be had
been considerably "done" by that gentleman. And there was that
five thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Some days later Mr. Pell received from Albany a large crate
containing several handsome specimens of coal and a large jar of
oil. It had been consigned from Cheyne Beach via s.s.
<i>Eucla</i>, and an accompanying report signed by Waterman
stated it was the first fruits of the prospect. A scale map
enclosed indicating the ground it was desirable to acquire as a
mineral lease.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell placed the map and report in his pocket and proceeded
to the office of the Attorney General.</p>

<p>That gentleman received him coldly but on the production of
the report and map became much more cordial. A rapid conference
resulted in the necessary papers being drawn up by Mr. Pell for
the Syndicate in the Attorney-General's office and forwarded to
the Mines Department with a requesting that further areas be
marked out so as to confine to the Syndicate all suitable
ground.</p>

<p>Secure in the success of his venture Mr. Pell did not waste
time in giving the news to the public. Mr. Smithers of the
<i>Advertiser</i> was an interested witness of the unpacking of
the crate and inspected the labels and route marks carefully.</p>

<p>"One never can be too careful with you, Pell," he remarked
candidly. "You're quite capable of pulling a bluff across
us."</p>

<p>It was not a large case, but with careful dressing it filled a
respectable shop window in Hay Street. Later the Government
analyst's report was framed and hung in the window for the
information of the public.</p>

<p>It was a sensation. Western Australia was proclaimed to be the
future oil producing country of the world, and Mr. Pell was
exalted as the discoverer of the oil.</p>

<p>The <i>Advertiser</i> had a lot to say on the subject and
said it with the word 'if' very prominent. The newspaper was an
old antagonist of Mr. Pell and declined to declare itself in
favour of any proposition of his. There might be something in the
find. There might not. For the present Mr. Pell was entitled to
the benefit of the doubt. Later&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was requested to let the public in on the good thing.
He was earnestly implored not to seek for European capital. There
was capital to be had for the asking in the State, and if it was
necessary to go outside the State, then our brothers and sisters
in the East had the first claim. But Western Australians should
have the first call.</p>

<p>All this Mr. Pell listened to and finally announced that the
Syndicate had decided to float the company in Perth, and Western
Australians would have the first right to the shares.</p>

<p>The flotation of "The Western Australian Oil and Coal Company
Limited" was a great success. The capital was marked at half a
million of which the promoting Syndicate was to be bought out for
four hundred thousand pounds. It was a large sum, but the advent
of more coal and oil specimens at the critical moment floated the
company successfully. The promoters took their interest in
shares.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was satisfied. The Syndicate had merged into the
Company, and with the present excitement over the find he would
have no trouble in disposing of his shares. The Board of
Directors was a strong one, and Mr. Pell to the disappointment of
many refused to allow his name to be included. Instead he quietly
obliged many friends with parcels of shares.</p>

<p>It was just a week after the flotation of the Company that Mr.
Pell received a letter from Waterman that caused him some
perplexity.</p>

<p>Mr. Waterman wrote that he had succeeded in locating a large
bed of coal within easy reach of Cheyne Beach, it was of good
quality and close to the surface. In its caloric quality it
compared very favourable with the Collie coal. Of oil, the sample
bottle he had sent was probably from a small flow. There did not
appear to be any further signs of oil.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell carefully deposited the letter in the grate and
applied a match to it.</p>

<p>"I must wire to Waterman to return at once," he murmured. "If
I had known of this a week ago I would not have parted with those
shares."</p>

<p>The letter flared up in a long dancing flame and then
flickered out.</p>

<p>"It's a fool job dickering with engineer's reports," Mr. Pell
was addressing the ashes. "Anyhow, Waterman won't object when he
sees the cash."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">XII. &mdash; THE PURSUIT OF
PEACE</a></h2>

<p class="first">SUCCESS is the dream of every man&mdash;success
before the age of fifty. After that age man's opinions change,
especially if he has won the success be desired. Thus, Mr. Peter
Pell, M.H.R. and financial magnate, began to desire other things
of life.</p>

<p>His banking account was satisfactory and able to stand any
strains his position might put upon it. His seat in Parliament
was secure, as, at Quicksands Bay, he was unopposed lord of the
land. He now desired peace.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pell had other ideas. In the dim past when Mr. Pell was
her star boarder, she had been content if her rooms let well. The
great ambition then had been to acquire Mr. Pell. But with
success had come other desires. Financial success had opened the
door of social success in Perth. Mr. Pell's election to a Federal
Seat had brought further ambitions. Melbourne opened a wider
vista. Now Mrs. Pell desired to shine in the capital of the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell had won success. Why not now a title&mdash;say a
knighthood to commence with. When Mrs. Pell mentioned the matter
to Mr. Pell in the privacy of the connubial bedchamber, that
gentleman scouted the idea. He had no illusions as to the manner
in which the prefix was attained. To him it was a simple problem
of pounds, shillings and pence.</p>

<p>Certainly he had the money, but he had not the desire to spend
it in this direction. Titles were very well for these who desired
those gew-gaws. He did not.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Pell set her mind on a matter it was not easy to
shift her. She desired ardently to be known as "my lady."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell's indifference was a stumbling block in the way. Once
his cooperation was secured Mrs. Pell felt assured the matter was
practically accomplished. She had never known him defeated, and
in so simple a matter as this she could see no difficulty.</p>

<p>On his part Mr. Pell did not desire social advancement. A
title would be a bore. He would have to go eat and show it off.
If it was only a question of Mrs. Pell's wishes, it is likely Mr.
Pell, as a good and faithful husband would have immediately set
about the acquisition of the prefix. With his knowledge that the
matter would not rest there, he set his foot down firmly on the
proposition, and refused to move it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pell felt herself aggrieved. She let Mr. Pell know this.
She accused him of meanness. It is true Mr. Pell controlled money
matters closely, but no one should have accused him of meanness.
He liked to live in a fine house. He liked, nay, he
desired, that his table should be supplied with the best
obtainable. He liked to see his wife clothed in fine raiment and
make a show in local and Melbourne society. He considered it due
to his position that these things should be. But, beyond all, he
cared, for his own ease and comfort.</p>

<p>A title would not make for his comfort. It would, in the words
of Mrs. Pell, be something to live up to. Mr. Pell did not desire
to live up to anything. Mrs. Pell argued the subject hotly, Mr.
Pell contented himself with a silent opposition. He could not do
more. Mrs. Pell bad too much to say.</p>

<p>This state of things could not continue indefinitely. Unless
Mr. Pell did something, it was probable his opposition would be
overborne by mere verbiage, and the title secured at a large
monetary cost. Yet what could he do? It was useless to argue with
Mrs. Pell. Three years of married life had convinced Mr. Pell
that to argue was to invite defeat. So far he had held his own by
refusing discussion, at the cost of many sleepless nights.</p>

<p>In the bosom of her social circle Mrs. Pell had already
proclaimed that Mr. Pell would shortly be translated. It was a
statement born of a wish, but was received by her intimates, who
already had a warm regard for her tactics and energy, as a
prophesy. It was the cause of some jealousy and a great deal of
talk. Neither worried Mrs. Pell. She had an object to gain and
she felt her only weapons were those of womanhood. To this end
she created all the talk on the subject possible.</p>

<p>As was to be expected most of these prophecies (to call them
by no meaner name) came in due course to the masculine heads of
households, and after deliberation was retailed in the various
smoking rooms of the Federal capital. Thoroughly conned and
commented on, it was not long before some brave spirits
determined to test their authenticity by submitting them to Mr.
Pell.</p>

<p>That gentleman was furious and went home and spoke his mind to
Mrs. Pell, much to that good lady's disgust. But the rumour once
started, soon overran its bounds. Mentioned first in a spirit of
banter between the men of the 'Win-the-War Party' as a good joke
against Mr. Pell, it came at length that certain elements
considered the matter as practically settled.</p>

<p>A Society Journal always on the look out for tit-bits
announced in a guarded paragraph, that an eminent financier of
Western Australia would certainly be mentioned for Birthday
honours. This resulted in an interview between the Prime Minister
and Mr. Pell. The Minister spoke gravely and sorrowfully on the
subject and pointed out to Mr. Pell that honours were not
showered indiscriminately. They had to be won and deserved. He
spoke with his tongue in his cheek and Mr. Pell replied with
earnestness and vigour.</p>

<p>Later Mr. Pell spoke, again to Mrs. Pell and passed a new
regulation for the guidance of that lady. Mrs. Pell defended her
position vigorously, spoke disrespectfully of the Prime Minister,
the Lord Chancellor, the King, besides certain new knights. The
regulation was disregarded and passed into the lumber room of
things matrimonial.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell felt he must take action. A married man may decide to
take action, but the execution was a more difficult thing.
Marriage in these modern days, and in spite of the words of the
Prayer Book, is a democracy. There may have been a time, and the
wording of the Service tends to this supposition, when, marriage
was a monarchy, with a Salic law, but none of the present
generation can speak authoritatively on the point. The modern
male reads of the "Woman who obeyed," his lady prefers the story
of the "Woman who did." They are two distinct points of view and
the one practised in certainly the latter.</p>

<p>The trained intellect of the modern financial genius is
supposed to be capable of solving any problem presented. The
modern novel often deals with the financial genius who has
trouble in his household and solves it by the rule of three that
applies to everyday business. Mr. Pell had read these novels and
sat himself down, secure in his ability, to solve his matrimonial
difficulties in the manner he would have dealt with a land or
mining deal.</p>

<p>First he considered his position. Mrs. Pell was the party he
had to fight. She desired a title. He was 'bearing' titles. Surely
it was a simple problem. If the title came he could decline it.
In his heart he knew that impossible. Life would not be worth
living thereafter. He could go to the Prime Minister and declare
he would not accept a title if it were offered to him. No, he
could hardly do that in the face of the Prime Minister's
declaration that he was not to be offered one.</p>

<p>He had placed that aspect of the case before Mrs. Pell and the
following morning had found his blotting pad scribbled over with
the words "Lady Peter Pell." Mrs. Pell evidently had a poor
opinion of the Prime Minister's foresight.</p>

<p>The problem finally came to the plain issue that Mrs. Pell was
determined to win a title for her husband whether he wished it or
not. His business was to convince Mrs. Pell that she did not want
a title. From the point of view of Mr. Peter Pell the outlook
seemed hopeless, and he sighed.</p>

<p>It occurred once to Mr. Pell that if he lost his money then
Mrs. Pell would realise a title was hopeless. They would not be
able to sustain the dignity of the position. Mr. Pell disliked
this solution of the problem. It would mean the relinquishing of
all the good things he valued. He would have to clothe himself as
the common herd. He would have to feed at cheap restaurants and
his home meals would have no distinction and favour. It meant the
denial of all he had worked for. Even the title with its
attendant garden parties, bazaars and other functions was
preferable.</p>

<p>Then came the brilliant flash of thought. It was the solution
of the problem. He would act in his political life in such a
manner that it would be impossible for the Prime Minister to
recommend him for honour. He would act so that Mrs. Pell would
recognise his disabilities. Yet he most act so that he preserved
peace, as far as possible, in his own household. His action must
be the logical sequence of Mrs. Pell's pet theories put in
practice ostensibly for her pleasure, or better still at her
request. But how?</p>

<p>As befitting one of the social leaders of the Commonwealth
Mrs. Pell was interested is Social Reform. What exactly the dear
ladies who supported this phrase meant was not to be determined
by the mere male. They spoke of overcrowding and poverty where
the average wage was but little under £4 a week. They coupled
with these facts a decided prohibition of the liquor question
while having a standard order at their wine merchants for the
best brand procurable. They shrieked of home industries while
declaring their delicate skins could not be defiled with any
clothing but that made in the slums of Paris and London. They
preached a world-wide economy while gratifying their every wish
at whatever expense to their husbands.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell felt that here was the weapon made for his hand. He
would be a social reformer. He would graft Social Reform on his
declared "Win-the-War" policy. It would be a double-edged weapon,
for he had not forgiven the manner in which the Prime Minister
had spoken on the subject of honours.</p>

<p>A few words spoken at random showed Mr. Pell that he was not
alone in the desire to read his lady a lesson. Her interference
with his comfort was paralleled by the experiences of other
husbands who also suffered. This revelation placed the affair on
a broader footing. He would not fight the battle alone. He would
not have the whole of the ridicule to face. Carefully organised
he would have a solid body of revolting husbands, ostensibly
forwarding the good work their spouses had originated.</p>

<p>It was but the matter of a short time to gather a bodyguard of
supporters. With a possibility of relief from the thraldom of the
past, they were prepared to go any lengths in the matrimonial
battle. In fact Mr. Pell found some trouble in keeping the
movement within bounds. A programme was framed and a date fixed
for the inaugural meeting, Mr. Pell took the chair and was
supported by a fair number of his Parliamentary friends. Ladies
were invited, and the meeting was preceded by a banquet. When the
cloth was withdrawn Mr. Pell spoke of the purposes of the
meeting, and outlined the objects of the proposed Society as
Economy in War-time and after, the total prohibition of drink
except through wine merchants of standing and reputation, support
of Australian industries and world-wide free trade.</p>

<p>A committee of gentlemen was to be elected to draw up the
constitution and rules of the Society, and the ladies were asked
to elect a committee for propaganda work amongst the working
classes.</p>

<p>The new Society did not meet with a very enthusiastic
reception from the newspapers. The <i>Tear</i> pointed out that
it was not encouraging war-time economy to launch a movement with
a banquet of so lavish a nature, and the method of combating the
drink problem as outlined by the Society would only affect the
poorer classes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pell also criticised the methods of the Society. She
objected to the non-inclusion of ladies on the committee, and
when Mr. Pell pointed out that the committee was reserved to
Parliamentarians, stated that in her opinion the Society should
include in its programme a plank claiming Parliamentary seats for
ladies. The Society for Social Reform had been accepted with
ridicule, not opposition. It was welcomed as likely to provide
the comic relief of Parliamentary life, and the newspapers looked
for the members of the committee to bring their theories to light
in the chambers, and thus lighten the dullness of many
speeches.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell decided that something must be done to turn this
ridicule into opposition. The Government had before Parliament a
measure dealing with the limitation of hours of the sale of all
liquor. Mr. Pell promptly tabled an amendment that soldiers and
sailors of the Commonwealth forces be not served while in
uniform. With some difficulty he managed to get this amendment
adopted by the Society.</p>

<p>It raised a storm of indignation. Mr. Pell on rising to move
his amendment was greeted with hisses and hoots. He defended his
amendment on the grounds that the Commonwealth had already gone a
considerable distance along this road by closing the hotels and
wine saloons on the arrival of transports from overseas. He
claimed that if soldiers and sailors were not to be trusted with
open bars on the day they arrived in a port of the Commonwealth,
they were logically not to be trusted on future days.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister sent for Mr. Pell and expostulated. Mr.
Pell stuck to his point and refused to withdraw his amendment.
The amendment was, however, lost, but Mr. Pell felt that he had
scored distinctly.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister met him in the lobby. Shortly after, the
lumpers at the various ports of the Commonwealth struck work.
They did not seem to know exactly why they struck. There was some
question of a time card for workers, but none of them had ever
seen them. It was, however, held by the leaders of the men that
it was derogatory to the dignity of the Australian working man
that the bosses should record the minutes worked between drinks.
Consequently all time systems, bosses and work was declared
'black' and the men went on holiday. It had been along time since
a general holiday had been declared other than by Act of
Parliament, and the men revelled in their freedom.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell, deserting his party, who declared that stoppage of
work was against "winning-the-war," upheld the cause of the men.
He attempted to get the unions to declare that Parliamentary
procedure and "Hansard" were "black."</p>

<p>This was going too far for the leaders of the Labor Party.
Most of them aspired to a seat is some house of Legislature. Mr.
Pell, however, received unexpected support from the Federal
Ministry. The Queensland Parliament published in "Hansard" a full
report of proceedings, in which the Prime Minister and his
proposals were adversely criticised. The Prime Minister thereupon
declared "Hansard" black.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell felt himself growing warm.</p>

<p>The Ladies' Committee of the Society of Social Reform had
meanwhile put in a lot of work. Meeting almost daily they passed
'urgent' resolutions on all and sundry subjects and sent them to
the General Committee. They followed them in the course of a day
or so with an "urgent" message calling for immediate action. The
Secretary of the Society complained to Mr. Pell. He could not get
inside his office and had not seen his desk for months. Mr. Pell
was sympathetic&mdash;and had an important appointment. Mrs. Pell
was the great mainstay of the Ladies' Committee.</p>

<p>Privately Mr. Pell thought she rode her hobby to death. She
had coupled the Society for Social Reform and her longing for a
title, and lived in daily expectation of the former bringing her
the latter. Also she talked about it to Mr. Pell in the small and
early morning hours.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Pell who discovered that soldiers' relations and
wives were not being treated in a considerate manner by the
Government. After consulting Mr. Pell, by way of a monologue, she
sailed a meeting of the Ladies' Committee and laid the matter
before them. They considered Mrs. Pell's remarks were novel and
worthy of consideration. Briefly, Mrs. Pell considered that
soldiers' wives were being defrauded by the Government. Their
husbands were paid but a fraction of what their arduous and
dangerous duties entitled them to. The pay of all soldiers must
be immediately raised. Not only this but the Commonwealth
Government with unparalleled audacity only paid to the wives and
dependants a small proportion of the money due to the
soldiers.</p>

<p>"This," said Mrs. Pell, at the meeting of the Ladies'
Committee, speaking in her best oratorical manner, "is a gross
violation of the rights of women. Does a woman marry a man for
the purpose of receiving but one half or even less of his income.
No! Every woman plainly understands that when she marries she has
a right to the handling of all her husband's money. Does a woman
in civil life remain content when her husband brings home to her
but a fraction of his weekly earnings? No! Then the soldiers'
wives of the Commonwealth should demand that the Government treat
them as their husbands treated them in the pre-war days. The
Government should pay to the soldiers' wives the whole of the
money earned by their husbands fighting the battle of the
Empire."</p>

<p>It was a rousing and inspiring speech, and Mr. Pell felt that
at last Mrs. Pell had advanced his scheme a long way on the road
to success. He was prepared to encourage her, but she and her
colleagues did not require encouragement.</p>

<p>The resolution of the Ladies' Committee was, as usual, sent to
the Parliamentary Committee, over which Mr. Pell presided. On the
motion of that gentleman, the resolution was returned to the
Ladies' Committee with expressed sympathy and full powers to act.
The ladies recorded the sympathy of their minutes and accepted
the powers&mdash;without thanks. A monster mass meeting of
soldiers' female relations was called by Mrs. Pell. Most of the
ladies of the committee made speeches and urged on the soldiers'
wives to demand their rights. A deputation was elected to wait on
the Prime Minister with the various resolutions that had been
passed. A procession was formed, and headed by Mrs. Pell and her
colleagues marched to Parliament House.</p>

<p>"Pell," said one of that gentleman's warmest admirers, as they
stood in a window and watched the procession deploy before them,
"You've done the trick this time. Billy will have to call out the
military."</p>

<p>"Don't talk foolish," replied Mr. Pell amiably, "do you think
the military will come out with their women here. Would you go and
meet your wife with a bayonet?"</p>

<p>"By gum, my boy," was the retort, "and sure I wouldn't."</p>

<p>After disposing of the deputation with well expressed
sympathy, the Prime Minister sent an urgent message to Mr.
Pell.</p>

<p>"Look here, Pell," said the great man, "this has got to stop.
You're ruining the Party."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell did not care about the Party and said so. More, he
informed the Prime Minister that his wife bad taken the bit
between her teeth and was out of control. He did not express his
opinion in such plain terms, but the Great Man read between the
lines.</p>

<p>"But it will never do, man," exclaimed the Prime Minister.
"You may have to do something. What's this wretched Society of
yours for?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pell carefully explained the aims and objects of the
Society for Social Reform.</p>

<p>"Bosh!" exclaimed the Great Man, "I've heard all that before.
What do you and your wife want out of it?"</p>

<p>"I can't answer for Mrs. Pell," said Mr. Pell amiably. "What I
want is Peace."</p>

<p>"Good Lord," the Great Man looked at Mr. Pell in amazement.
"And you're kicking up all this disturbance for the sake of your
domestic peace."</p>

<p>Mr. Pell left it at that. The Great Man was badly riled and
Mr. Pell was content. For the sake of Peace he was prepared to
wage a long guerrilla war, by the aid of Mrs. Pell, with the
Government. Mrs. Pell believed she was working in the direction
of the title she coveted and Mr. Pell was certain he was out of
favour with the Powers that Be. On a bet Mr. Pell was certain the
odds to win were in his own favour. Mrs. Pell felt that with the
present movement she was in a position to cause a lot of
trouble.</p>

<p>The soldiers' wives were solidly behind her. Daily new
recruits were brought to the Society, and to interview the many
adherents she was making, large and handsomely furnished offices
were taken in the heart of the city. Also subscriptions were
pouring in. Every woman in the country felt a big movement was
going forward and desired to be in it. There can be no doubt but
that had the Society for Social Reform been left in the hands of
Mrs. Pell and her supporters the movement, after some
uncomfortable hours for the members of the Federal Ministry,
would have died a natural death. Deputations are interesting, but
wearying. To instruct a Prime Minister in his duty is
interesting, for a few months, but when that gentleman declines,
systematically, to follow the advice so generously offered, the
game loses much of its piquancy.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister received Mrs. Pell and her colleagues
whenever they called. He was so sympathetic. He was so receptive
of ideas, but he did nothing. Always he placed his colleagues in
the paths of progress. It was the War Minister who could not see
his way. That the Treasurer would not ante up with the cash. Mrs.
Pell became quite disheartened.</p>

<p>At this time a lady named Miss Emily Parkington arrived in
Australia. She was a lady of firm disposition and had for many
years interviewed the different members of Foreign Ministries on
various subjects. They had not been sympathetic and Miss
Parkington had had to resort to stern measures to attract their
attention. A few glass merchants had profited and a number of
police constables had suffered.</p>

<p>Then the lady was advised by her medical attendant that a
voyage around the world would be for the benefit of her health.
She came to Australia. West Australia was not sympathetic to Miss
Parkington. She made a few speeches which were well received by
the Labor leaders. They were willing to listen to her theories so
long as they were not antagonistic to their professed programme.
But when the lady tried to pass round the hat they distinctly
gave her to understand that what loose cash was about was needed
for home consumption.</p>

<p>Miss Parkington at this time heard of the Society of Social
Reform, and packing up her boxes sailed for Melbourne. Mrs. Pell
was immensely taken with Miss Parkington. The latter was rather a
good looking girl, very far from the accepted type of agitator.
Mrs. Pell thought she had made a find and after a little
diplomacy worked the lady on to the Ladies' Committee of the
Society. There, Miss Parkington took the bit between her teeth.
The Society had gone far in the matter of progress. Miss
Parkington opened a larger and wider vista of work.</p>

<p>The Capital City of the Commonwealth had become quite used to
processions of the Society of Social Reform. It was a break in
the weary monotony of business to stand for a while and watch the
ladies on their route to interview some Minister at Parliament
House. If a business man had an hour to spare he would follow and
listen to some of the speeches. It was good fun and you had
nothing to pay. Miss Parkington brusquely stated these
processions were futile.</p>

<p>"What we want is a few windows broken," she declaimed to Mrs.
Pell.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked that lady.</p>

<p>"Moral persuasion," answered Miss Parkington. "If we smash all
the windows in Parliament House the Prime Minister will listen to
us."</p>

<p>"He is more likely to send for the police," replied the rather
conservative Mrs. Pell.</p>

<p>Among the ladies of the Society of Social Reform there were
some who were getting tired of the monotony of the work. It was
all very well to walk in procession, but it is not too exciting.
If some windows were broken it might liven things up a bit. Of
course they were not going to do the breaking. Nothing so
unladylike; but if Miss Parkington was willing to do the breaking
they might be prepared to extend a passive superintendence to the
matter. The role of onlooker is exciting and not dangerous.</p>

<p>After discussion the next procession to interview the Prime
Minister was organised on the lines laid down by Miss Parkington.
It was a huge success. The news that there was to be some
stirring doings brought a larger crowd than usual to the steps
of Parliament House. Miss Parkington threw the first stone, and
some of her warmest admirers followed her example. There was some
broken glass, and then the police came. Many of the window-smashers
faded into oblivion.</p>

<p>Miss Parkington stood her ground and in a passionate speech
told the audience that the windows were smashed to earn bread for
the starving women and children. She did not explain if the glass
merchants were going to subscribe out of their surplus profits.
She was content&mdash;there was the deed, and there were the
police. With a good-looking, athletic constable she gave a short
wrestling exhibition, and then walked to the Police Station,
where she called loudly for bail. Mr. Pell, at the instance of
his wife, found the desired security.</p>

<p>The matter of Miss Parkington and Mr. and Mrs. Pell was
debated between the great ones of the Ministry the same evening
at an informal gathering at the Prime Minister's house. It was
decided unanimously that the present state of affairs could not
be allowed to continue. Something had to be done. Comforted with
the assurance that this was all that could be required of them
the subordinate ministers went home and left the Prime Minister
to find the means&mdash;and the way.</p>

<p>A Prime Minister could not attain to his exalted office unless
he understood perfectly the art of evading the question. In the
matter of Mrs. Pell the Minister understood that it was
impossible to go straight to the point. He must isolate the
danger; surround it with a series of platitudes; beat down the
defences with a barrage of self interest.</p>

<p>As Prime Minister of a party that had hoisted a multi-coloured
flag he knew, by instinct, what had to be done.</p>

<p>When the Pells returned to their native State the Society of
Social Reform had attained many of its objects. Some of them were
tempered more or less, but the promoters of the Society had just
cause for self-congratulation. Mrs. Pell had ceased to worry Mr.
Pell about the necessity for a title and, in consequence, that
gentleman had eased off a little in his attacks on the
"Win-the-War Party."</p>

<p>To his constituents at Quicksands Bay Mr. Pell explained he
was not in any way antagonistic to the Prime Minister and the
Party. All he had done had been to make his humble attempt to put
some ginger in the Prime Minister's proposals. They must agree
with him that, while the measures proposed by the Ministers of
the Crown were very well in their way, they were framed in too
conciliatory a spirit for Westralians. Westralians desired the
war to be won without compromise. They would agree with him. Not
quite understanding Mr. Pell the deputation intimated they were
in full agreement with his policy&mdash;if it kept Mr. Pell and
Quicksands Bay well to the fore. Now what about the South Perth
Railway?</p>

<p>Mr. Pell spent the vacation very quietly and pleasantly. He
had consolidated his position. He was sure of his seat in
Parliament for many years to come. Mrs. Pell had learned sense
through the medium of the Society and did not now openly express
opinions contrary to Mr. Pell's. Certainly this was a good old
world to live in if one had&mdash;plenty, of money&mdash;and
Peace.</p>

<p>It was one morning at breakfast that Mr. Pell found by his
plate a letter from the Prime Minister. Thinking it was to do
with some formal party matter, and being due to meet some old
friends at his club, he did not open it until he was on the ferry
on his way to Perth. It was short, only a few lines, but Mr.
Pell read it three times before he gathered the sense.</p>

<p>Dazed, he staggered off the boat and made for a seat on the
Esplanade. There he again read the fateful letter:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Sir,&mdash;<br> <br> I am commanded by the
Prime Minister to inform you that His Majesty the King has
conferred the Order of St. Canute and the Wave on you for your
valuable services in the cause of Social Reform in Australia. The
Prime Minister desires me to convey to you his congratulations on
the well deserved honour.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell sat for some time with the letter in his hand. He had
sought for wealth, and he had gathered. He had sought for honour,
and had succeeded, he had sought for Peace, and had
reaped&mdash;a knighthood. Was there to be peace for him? Sir
Peter Pell! The husband of Lady Pell. Before him the daily grind
of social activity.</p>

<p>With bowed head he rose and strolled towards the city.
Presently he came to a halt. Before him was a thick clump of
bushes. His mind passed back to a day in the past, when, without
a sixpence in his pocket, he lay down there hungry and tired, to
sleep. He had gone far since then. Was he happier?</p>

<p>"By Gad," he exclaimed with sudden fervour, "I believe a man's
happiest when his sole aim is the pursuit of sixpence."</p>
