<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">MARTHA TAYNE sat at her desk, close to the door
leading into Luther Banke's private office. She was leaning
forward, her elbows on the desk-top, her hands cupping her chin. A
heavy frown drew down her brows, half-closing her eyes. Her foot
tapped, impatiently, the mat under her desk.</p>

<p>The office was small, though comfortably furnished. Three tall
lines of steel filing-cabinets and a door occupied one of the
walls. Another wall held two large windows, and under them was a
long, comfortable-looking lounge. The third wall was vacant except
for a rather mediocre steel engraving. Against the fourth wall
stood Martha's desk and close by it was the door leading into the
inner office.</p>

<p>Martha had reason to frown. That morning should have been
devoted by Luther Banke to the overseas mail; and Alec Kempton,
senior partner in Walls, Kempton &amp;amp; Co., the leading
solicitors of the city, had been engaged with Luther Banke for the
past two hours. Impatiently, the girl's eyes wandered to the pile
of correspondence awaiting attention. The beat of her foot beneath
the desk increased perceptibly.</p>

<p>Really, the position was intolerable! More than one business man
in the city had openly stated that Martha Tayne <i>was</i> "Luther
Banke &amp; Co., Jewellers." Outside her door&mdash;opening
directly into the handsome, but discreetly, furnished
shop&mdash;were half-a-dozen immaculately garbed assistants
prepared to swear that if Martha married, handed in her
resignation, or inconsistently "sacked" the firm, the shutters
would have to be erected and a modest notice inserted in the
<i>Government Gazette</i> in the section headed "Bankruptcy."</p>

<p>Yet Martha was a girl and, without the present frown, a
remarkably pretty one. Tall, with dark hair containing more than a
hint of gold, a lithe almost faultless figure, and a clear
complexion, she attracted immediate attention.</p>

<p>From under rather heavy brows looked out keen, brown eyes which
ever held a glint of laughter, even when discussing the gravest
intricacies of business. A note in Luther Banke's private ledger
informed the reader that Martha Tayne had entered the employ of the
firm some three years previous and at that time had given her age
at twenty years.</p>

<p>A little silver gong struck three clear notes as the door from
the shop opened. Martha looked up quickly. A young man stood in the
doorway. For a minute he hesitated then, in response to her quick
nod of recognition, came to the desk and placed close to the girl's
elbow a long, narrow case. A quick movement of his tapered,
well-manicured fingers sprang back the lid, revealing six large,
well-matched emeralds lying on a white velvet bed. For a moment the
girl looked at the jewels a slight smile on her well-formed
lips.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke still engaged, Miss Tayne?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The girl leaned back in her chair, letting her hands fall
to her lap, in a helpless gesture. "The Montgomery emeralds, Mr.
Forde?"</p>

<p>The assistant nodded. He placed a slip of paper on the
blotting-pad before the girl. Martha scanned the few lines and
initialled them.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Forde. I will take charge of the emeralds."</p>

<p>Fred Forde bowed and turned to the door. As his hand touched the
doorknob the little silver bell chimed again. He looked round at
the girl, a thin smile on his lips. She nodded, rising impatiently
from her chair. For some minutes she paced the little room,
continually glancing at the door of the inner office. Once she went
to it and, after a moment's hesitation, bent her head to the panel,
to listen. She could hear no sounds from the room, not even the
murmur of voices. Her hand caught at the door-knob, then dropped to
her side and she resumed her idle pacing.</p>

<p>Luther Banke was a man of routine. Alec Kempton was a
methodical, matter-of-fact solicitor. Both men well knew that
Thursday morning was strictly reserved for the overseas
post&mdash;that to infringe on that time meant the possibility of
disorganising for that week the large interests Luther Banke &amp;
Co. had in all parts of the world, and especially in Europe and
America.</p>

<p>Martha glanced at her wrist-watch then went to the pile of
correspondence on her desk and fumbled through the papers. She had
no necessity to glance at any of them; she knew their contents by
heart. Again she glanced at her watch. Another half-hour and her
work would be too late for that day's mail. For the first time in
the three years she had been Luther Banke's private secretary, the
overseas mail would leave Sydney without including the very
important correspondence from Luther Banke &amp; Co. Again she
turned to face the door of the inner room.</p>

<p>Then her eyes fell on the case of emeralds&mdash;six large
stones, each about the size of a filbert. She lifted the case,
letting the light from the window play on the facets of the jewels,
admiring the quick changing of colours, the marvellous depth and
brilliancy, then abruptly closed the case and replaced it on the
desk.</p>

<p>Another glance at her wrist-watch, checking the time by a swift
look at the clock perched on top of the centre filing-cabinet, and
she turned to the inner office-door. A moment's hesitation and she
knocked. There was no response. A full half-minute she waited, then
knocked again, this time louder. Almost as her hand fell to her
side the door was partly opened and a short, florid man peered
around the edge.</p>

<p>"I wish to speak to Mr. Banke, Mr. Kempton." Martha spoke
coldly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke is engaged, Miss Tayne."</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke cannot be engaged." A quick flush rose to the girl's
face. "He cannot have forgotten that this is mail-day and that many
important matters require his immediate attention, Mr.
Kempton."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter if this is the Day of Judgment!" The
solicitor's florid face grew ruddy. "I have told you, Mr. Banke is
engaged and cannot attend to any business just for the moment."</p>

<p>Martha gasped. The door had almost closed before she regained
her wits; then with a quick forward movement she pushed the door
from the man's hand. It swung back against the wall with a
crash.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry!" Martha spoke contritely, for Alec Kempton was
rubbing his wrist. Yet the little smile on her lips detracted from
the words of her apology. Her quick glances travelled past the
solicitor to the man seated at the desk on the other side of the
room. He was sitting well forward, his body pressed against the
edge of the desk. One hand was raised to his brow, shielding his
face, his elbow resting on the blotting-pad. Something in his
attitude&mdash;a reflection of dejection&mdash;called to the
girl.</p>

<p>She stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke, this is mail-day. I must have your instructions at
once or we shall miss the mail this week."</p>

<p>"I have told you, Miss Tayne! Mr. Banke is engaged on important
business and cannot attend to the mail today."</p>

<p>Alec Kempton had followed the girl into the room and now
interposed between her and the seated man. "I take my instructions
only from Mr. Banke, Mr. Kempton." Martha faced the solicitor
defiantly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke is not in a condition to&mdash;er&mdash;attend to
routine business this morning," the solicitor persisted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke has not said so."</p>

<p>The girl tried to pass the solicitor, but he moved again between
her and the desk.</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to pass, please, Mr. Kempton?"</p>

<p>"No." The man spoke brusquely. "Please go back to your office,
Miss Tayne."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head, but the action was rather uncertain.
For a moment she hesitated, then again stepped quickly to one side.
Something in the attitude of the man at the desk alarmed her. She
turned and faced the solicitor.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Banke unwell, Mr. Kempton?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke has had a&mdash;er&mdash;shock." The man's reply came
after a deliberate pause. "I have told you he is not able to attend
to routine business. You must deal with those matters of which you
are cognisant, and allow other matters to remain over until the
next mail."</p>

<p>Martha gasped. Bewildered she looked from the solicitor to the
seated man. "I don't think you understand, Mr. Kempton," she said
slowly. "The overseas mail of this firm is entirely apart from the
ordinary shop business and local trade. Mr. Banke attends to it
personally, nearly every detail of it requires his personal
attention. It is quite impossible for any of it to be dealt with
without Mr. Banke's personal decisions and instructions."</p>

<p>"Then I am afraid this mail will have to be missed." A slight
smile played about the legal lips.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with Mr. Banke?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;I have told you. He has received a shock."</p>

<p>"A shock?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The solicitor hesitated. "Do you understand now?"</p>

<p>A little smile broke the line of the girl's compressed lips.
Slightly taller than the man before her, she looked down on him.
For a moment she caught sight of steel-blue eyes that held a hint
of fear. Martha moved suddenly, catching the solicitor by the arm
and swinging him to one side. A couple of quick steps and she was
standing before the desk.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke!" The man did not look up. For an instant the girl
waited, fear growing in her heart. Shaking herself, mentally, she
reached forward and touched his hand&mdash;to have her wrist
grasped firmly by Alec Kempton.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kempton!"</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne; you must not."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with Mr. Banke?"</p>

<p>"I have told you&mdash;a shock."</p>

<p>"Then he should be attended to." A quick movement brought the
girl to the side of the desk. Kempton made a feeble effort to
prevent her, but Martha wrenched her arm free.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke!"</p>

<p>The man at the desk did not answer, or even change his position.
The girl looked at him, in perplexity. Something was wrong in that
room; something was wrong with the man seated at the desk. He had
not moved since she had come into the room. He had taken no notice
of her presence, or of her questions. Tentatively, hesitatingly,
she stretched out her hand again to the man. This time the lawyer
grasped her wrist firmly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kempton, how dare you touch me!"</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne." The solicitor's voice held entreaty. "I ask you to
be careful&mdash;to leave this matter to me. Please go back to your
office."</p>

<p>"I refuse."</p>

<p>"I assure you that if you continue to interfere you may do
irreparable harm."</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;" Martha hesitated, "I think there is something
very wrong here." Her words were spoken slowly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Kempton was staring at the girl, his face
greying.</p>

<p>"This." With a sudden movement the girl released herself. She
caught at the seated man's arm, jerking it sideways. "This, Mr.
Kempton. This man is not Luther Banke!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">MECHANICALLY, Martha repeated her statement:</p>

<p>"This man is not Luther Banke." She turned to face the lawyer.
"Mr. Kempton, where is Mr. Banke?"</p>

<p>The lawyer did not answer. He was staring moodily at the man
seated at the desk, a frown on his florid face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke came into the office this morning very early," the
girl continued. "As you know, he has to pass through my room to get
to his. On his way in he stopped at my desk and told me he would be
ready to deal with the overseas mail within an hour. I replied that
the details were awaiting him. He nodded and smiled. I know he has
not left his office since he entered it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you did not see him leave," the solicitor suggested,
his tones showing his uneasiness.</p>

<p>"If I had not seen him, I should have heard him," Martha
continued quickly. "The door between my office and the shop is
fitted with an electric bell that 'rings' immediately the door is
opened. You know that, Mr. Kempton; you have remarked on that bell
to me."</p>

<p>"There may be other ways of leaving this office&mdash;" The
man's uneasiness showed very plainly.</p>

<p>"There are no other ways out of Mr. Banke's office." The girl
spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke&mdash;" Alec Kempton paused, hesitating.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke came in here this morning."</p>

<p>A slight flush stained the girl's cheeks.</p>

<p>"He spoke to me, as I have told you. I followed him in here. As
I went back to my desk the bell on the door leading to the shop
rang, and you entered my room. I came to this door and told Mr.
Banke you were here. I held this door open for you to enter. You
mentioned Mr. Banke's name as you entered. I heard you speak to him
as you entered the room." Martha paused and turned angrily on the
man. "Mr. Kempton, who is this man and what is he doing here? Where
is Mr. Banke?"</p>

<p>For a long moment there was silence in the room. Then the man
behind the desk rose to his feet and lazily stretched himself.
"Interesting, isn't it, Kempton?" He yawned. "Seems to me this
young lady has rather busted things, eh?"</p>

<p>"Me?" The man laughed. "Ask him?" He pointed to the
solicitor.</p>

<p>Martha was bewildered. What did it all mean? She knew that
Luther Banke had not left his office, yet he was not in it. She
glanced about the room again. There was no place there where a man
could hide. With a swift, lithe movement she went to the windows
and flung them open. The massive ironwork protections were intact.
Again she turned to face the room. The two men were regarding her
curiously. Some silent message must have passed between them while
her back had been turned to them. They appeared more at ease. For a
moment the girl regarded them steadily, then went to the door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Miss Tayne?" asked Alec Kempton.</p>

<p>"To summon the police," the girl answered over her shoulder,
half pausing on her way.</p>

<p>"I don't think you had better." The stranger spoke slowly, in a
lazy drawl. "You might find yourself in trouble, y'know."</p>

<p>"Trouble!" Martha turned on the two men passionately. "Mr.
Kempton, you know the trouble that can take place here. Why, in
that shop is over fifty thousands pounds' worth of jewellery."</p>

<p>"Not to mention the Montgomery emeralds." The strange man spoke
indifferently.</p>

<p>Again Martha did not reply to him. The Montgomery emeralds! Were
they the key to the strange happenings of that morning? The
emeralds were on her desk. Instinctively, she made a step toward
her room, then stopped and laughed. The emeralds were well
protected. No one could enter that suite of offices without ringing
the bell attached to the door between her room and the
shop&mdash;and that bell had not rung since she had left her desk.
She went to the door, from whence she could see the long, narrow
jewel-box on the corner of her desk. A little sigh of relief
escaped her lips and she turned again to face the two men, still
silently regarding her, curiosity showing in their faces.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kempton&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned to re-enter the inner office. Her words brought the
solicitor to action. In a couple of strides he reached the door,
Martha retreating before him into the outer office. He turned
swiftly and drew the door shut, turning the key in the lock.
Withdrawing the key from the lock he laid it on the corner of
Martha's desk.</p>

<p>"There is the key to Mr. Banke's room." Alec Kempton spoke in
hurried, worried tones. "You are to retain it until Mr. Banke
returns. Perhaps you will be able to supply him with a satisfactory
explanation of your remarkable conduct this morning."</p>

<p>Martha hesitated a moment, then slipped quickly into her chair.
The solicitor watched her for a moment, then with a shrug went to
the door leading to the shop.</p>

<p>"A moment, Mr. Kempton." The girl spoke quietly. "What of the
man you have locked in Mr. Luther Banke's office?"</p>

<p>"Well, what of him?" The little man answered defiantly.</p>

<p>"Is he to stay there until Mr. Luther Banke returns?"</p>

<p>Alec Kempton shrugged. "That is for you to say now," he replied.
"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke's private safes are in there." The girl spoke
significantly.</p>

<p>"What of that?"</p>

<p>"Those safes hold a valuable collection of mounted and unmounted
gems."</p>

<p>"You examined the windows and found them secure."</p>

<p>"I did not see Mr. Luther Banke leave his office."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Is there necessity for me to explain." Martha passed her hand
over her brow wearily. She let the hand drop to an open drawer of
her desk. Kempton waited a moment for the girl to speak, then took
a step toward the girl's desk. Martha smiled, and her left hand
slipped under the desk. There came the sound of metal clicking on
metal. A startled look came in the little solicitor's eyes, and he
glanced quickly toward the door.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Mr. Kempton." Again the girl smiled. "I
have a switch under my desk controlling the lock of that door. The
sound you heard was the lock being shot home. Now, if you please,
what of the man in Mr. Luther Banke's room?"</p>

<p>"What of him?" Again Alec Kempton gave question for question. He
waited a moment, then shrugged.</p>

<p>"I have no time for your heroics." He moved to the door. "You
will hear more of this when Mr. Luther Banke returns."</p>

<p>"The door is locked, Mr. Kempton."</p>

<p>"Then open it immediately!" The little solicitor turned
furiously and went to the desk. He had not proceeded half-way when
Martha Tayne's hand came out of the desk-drawer, holding a small
automatic. "I prefer you by the door, Mr. Kempton."</p>

<p>"And I prefer the other side of the door." The man laughed
harshly, yet the girl detected a note of nervousness in the
laughter.</p>

<p>"Have you gone entirely mad, girl?":</p>

<p>"I would be mad to allow anyone in Mr. Luther Banke's office
without knowing his business and how he got there." Martha spoke
evenly. She waited a moment, watching the man before her keenly.
Then her voice softened: "Mr. Kempton, you have been Mr. Luther
Banke's legal adviser for a number of years&mdash;you were his
legal adviser long before I came here. You know the strict rules
governing this business. How many of them have been infringed this
morning?"</p>

<p>Again the girl paused, but the man did not reply. "I have told
you the shop contains over fifty thousand pounds' worth of stock;
the safes in Mr. Banke's office contain several times that value.
Here, on my desk&mdash;" Her armed hand rested for a moment on the
emerald box. "Here are jewels valued at over ten thousand pounds.
When Mr. Luther Banke is absent, I am in sole
charge&mdash;responsible for the safety of everything&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice trailed to silence. The man shifted uneasily, allowing
his eyes to fall beneath the girl's level look. "Do you think I
should let anything pass me that I do not thoroughly understand,
and which I do not consider quite clear and honest. I have to use
what discretion I possess. I cannot, I dare not allow what has
happened this morning to pass unchallenged."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest doing?" Alec Kempton spoke after a long
silence.</p>

<p>"Call in the police." Martha answered promptly.
"Unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless, what?"</p>

<p>"Unless you are prepared to answer my questions?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"First, who is the man in Mr. Luther Banke's office?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Alec Kempton would prefer me to answer that
question." The girl swung round in her chair sharply at the sound
of the voice from the direction of the inner office. She saw the
door was now open and, on the threshhold stood the man she had seen
seated in her employer's chair. She glanced to the corner of her
desk where she had seen the solicitor deposit the key he had taken
from the door-lock. The key was there! She started at the strange
man in mute astonishment.</p>

<p>"Interested?" The man laughed slightly. "No, Miss Tayne, I am
not a magician. I unlocked the door&mdash;just that!" He
smiled.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Martha's eyes again went to the corner of her desk.
"The&mdash;the key?"</p>

<p>"The key." The stranger laughed gently. He took from his
waistcoat pocket a strangely-shaped key, tossing it in his hand.
"Just so! The key. Mr. Kempton locked the door, I believe,
confining me in the room, as he thought. I had no desire to stay
there, alone, so I unlocked the door."</p>

<p>For some seconds he watche, the girl, a little twinkle in his
eyes, then strolled across the room to where the solicitor
stood.</p>

<p>"Coming, Alec?" His tones were studiously careless. "Right-o!
Come on."</p>

<p>He caught the handle of the door. A glint of amusement shone in
his fine eyes when he realised that the door was fastened. He
looked toward the girl, backing slowly until his back was pressed
against the lintel.</p>

<p>"May I trouble you to unlatch the door, Miss Tayne," he said
courteously.</p>

<p>"I shall not." The automatic clenched in the girl's fist tilted
menacingly at the man.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" he smiled again. "I must manage it myself." He
turned and for a few seconds carefully surveyed the door and its
frame.</p>

<p>"If you touch that door, I'll shoot,"' said Martha firmly; yet
there was a little quiver in her voice.</p>

<p>"Not necessary, I assure you!" Again he smiled. As he spoke
three irregularly spaced knocks came at the door. Instinctively,
Martha's hand went to the switch controlling the door-lock, and
released it. The door swung open and Fred Forde walked into the
room.</p>

<p>"You rang, Miss Tayne?" The assistant spoke formally.</p>

<p>"I rang?" Martha, showed surprise. "No, Mr. Forde, I did not
ring."</p>

<p>"But I did."</p>

<p>Martha looked toward the door, to see the strange man standing
in the doorway, holding the door ajar. "Just a pin, Miss Tayne; a
small thing, but very useful, sometimes. Lesson One&mdash;a pin
will ring an electric bell, and produce a Mr. Forde."</p>

<p>Martha sprang to her feet, anger flaming in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Move and I fire." Determination was in her voice, her hand was
steady. "Close that door! Tell me, who are you?"</p>

<p>"I?" The stranger's laugh rang through the room. "Why not? Young
lady, my name is 'Cain'&mdash;and you spell it with an 'i'!"</p>

<p>His long arm swept out, catching the solicitor by the collar and
drawing him before the door and through it. A moment and the door
closed, leaving the girl alone in her office with the dumbfounded
jeweller's assistant.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">MARTHA came out of Luther Banke's room, closed the
door and went to the seat behind her desk, sitting down
wearily.</p>

<p>For more than an hour she had been in her employer's private
office, recounting the details of the raid on the jewellery
establishment by the notorious crook who styled himself "Cain."</p>

<p>For more than an hour she had withstood the searching
questioning by Detective-Sergeant Davidson, striving to answer
intelligently and fully while her brain had been in a whirl, and
the keen eyes of the police officer had seemed to stare down into
her secret thoughts accusingly.</p>

<p>Now, in the semi-privacy of her own office she smiled at the
tremors that had assailed her while under examination. She had
nothing to fear, in fact the detective had, at the end of his
questioning, complimented her on the brave stand she had made
against a feared and notorious criminal.</p>

<p>"Cain" had departed with the Montgomery emeralds&mdash;and no
one had seen him take them from her desk. Martha was almost
prepared to swear that he had never approached the desk. Fred
Forde, the assistant, said that he believed the jewels to be on
Martha's desk when he had entered the office to be confronted by
the much-advertised crook, and that from thence on he had been
between the crook and the desk.</p>

<p>Detective-Sergeant Davidson had laughed, suggesting that they
had seen the jewels where Forde had placed them, because they had
expected them to be there. He would not explain that cryptic
remark.</p>

<p>If only Alec Kempton had given her one hint of what had happened
in the inner office after she had shown him in to the man she had
mistaken for her employer. Her fine lips curled in disdain as
thoughts of the little man came to her.</p>

<p>What sort of a man was he? He had allowed himself to be
intimidated, to be awed into silence, almost forced to be an
accessory to the theft of the jewels.</p>

<p>Almost Martha could find admiration in her heart for the man who
had named himself "Cain"&mdash;"Cain," the legendary criminal who
had been driven from his kind with the curse that every human hand
should henceforth be lifted against him. She had to admire the
absolute nerve that had brought him to that establishment, so well
guarded, disguised as the owner, intent on the theft of the famous
Montgomery emeralds. She had to admire the steadfast confidence
which had held him to his task, the fear of discovery ever beside
him.</p>

<p>She could not but admire the strength of will which had allowed
him to overawe the little solicitor and force the man to do his
bidding. Now Martha believed she could trace the crime step by
step.</p>

<p>Now she knew of the false telephone message which had taken
Luther Banke into a distant suburb of the city and there detained
him during the first hours of the morning. She could visualise the
big, unnerving moment for the crook when Alec Kempton had
unexpectedly walked into his presence. She conceived the swift
swoop on the jewels he coveted, and knew, far too well, the details
of the daring escape. Against her will she sighed.</p>

<p>That was adventure!</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Tayne?" Martha looked up suddenly, to see the
detective standing in the doorway, surveying her quizzically.</p>

<p>"Do you want me, Mr&mdash;Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Mister will do, please." Detective-Sergeant Davidson, a tall,
well-set-up man of about thirty years of age, smiled as he closed
the door of Luther Banke's office and came to Martha's desk.</p>

<p>"'Cain' was quite an experience, wasn't he, Miss Tayne?"</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe him real yet," the girl smiled. "And to
think he was in that room for nearly two hours&mdash;and Mr Luther
Banke's safes contain many thousands of pounds worth of
jewels!"</p>

<p>"Safes are not 'Cain's' meat." The detective grinned. "'Cain'
has never put his mark on a safe yet. No, he is a picker-up
of&mdash;well, considered trifles. The Montgomery emeralds were
quite to his taste and in his line&mdash;and they were lying on
your desk ready to his hand, so to speak."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." the girl answered contritely. "I never thought of
them." She hesitated a moment. "You know, so many important pieces
of jewellery lie on this desk at times. With the door to the shop
protected by the electric bolt and the bell, I never believed a
theft could be accomplished in this room."</p>

<p>"Quite a number of things we think impossible prove possible
sooner or later, Miss Tayne." Davidson spoke meditatively.</p>

<p>"Is that a hint, a warning, or an accusation." Martha looked up
quickly.</p>

<p>"Neither one of the three." The detective smiled broadly. "This
is your first experience of a robbery, I believe&mdash;and you have
been in Mr Luther Banke's employ for three years. You are lucky,
Miss Tayne."</p>

<p>"Mr Luther Banke does not think so," the girl returned quickly.
"The Montgomery emeralds are very valuable."</p>

<p>"They may be recovered."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Jewels of that nature are difficult to dispose of."</p>

<p>"For 'Cain' to dispose of?"</p>

<p>"What do you know of 'Cain'?" The question came after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Nothing, but what happened here this morning," the girl said
slowly, "but, I saw him and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;What?"</p>

<p>"I wonder now if I saw the real man." Martha spoke as if
communing with herself.</p>

<p>"The real man!" There was a note of seriousness in the
detective's voice. "Do you know what you mean by that, Miss
Tayne?"</p>

<p>"I know he came here disguised as Mr Luther Banke. Then he wore
a short, close-cropped beard and moustache. He appeared to be a
middle-aged man wearing signs of long-standing illness&mdash;Mr
Banke had been a partial invalid for many years. He acted the
part&mdash;No, he <i>was</i> the man in every sense. When he came
out of Mr Luther Banke's room into my office he was younger, more
virile, every poise of body showing supreme confidence in himself.
I held him under my gun&mdash;" The girl looked up quickly.
"&mdash;and I can shoot, Mr Davidson. I would have shot him if Mr
Kempton had but given me one hint of the truth of what happened in
that office."</p>

<p>Her lips curled at thought of the pusillanimous solicitor. "And
I would have shot to kill. Yet&mdash;" Again she paused. "Yet he
never showed one sign of fear. He&mdash;he laughed!"</p>

<p>"A testimonial, Miss Tayne?" Davidson smiled broadly.</p>

<p>"It may be. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The telephone on the girl's desk shrilled. Martha lifted the
receiver and spoke the name of her firm. She listened for a moment
then pushed the instrument toward the police officer.</p>

<p>"Someone is asking for you, Mr. Davidson."</p>

<p>"For me?" The man looked surprised. For a moment he
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Will you take a message for me, Miss Tayne. Say&mdash;say that
I am engaged."</p>

<p>The girl looked surprised, but obeyed.</p>

<p>For some minutes she listened, then drew a scribbling-pad toward
her and wrote rapidly. Davidson watched the girl for a moment, then
came round the desk and glanced over the girl's shoulder. He
chuckled slightly and Martha looked up, slightly flushed.</p>

<p>"There is the message, Mr&mdash;er&mdash;Davidson." The girl's
eyes were watchful and her tones cold.</p>

<p>"What do you think should be done with it, Miss Tayne?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I should hand it to Mr Luther Banke." A slight smile
came on Martha's lips. "You must acknowledge, the position
is&mdash;er&mdash;unique."</p>

<p>"And the message&mdash;awkward, now that Mr Kempton has left
us." The man laughed gently.</p>

<p>"So sorry Detective-Sergeant Davidson met with
an&mdash;accident&mdash;er&mdash;'Cain'&mdash;you spell it with an
'I,' do you not?" Martha's heart was beating fast yet her hand was
steady as it stole along the line of her desk to where the
automatic rested in the drawer.</p>

<p>"Invariably." Mirth grew in the man's eyes. "If you will forgive
me, Miss Tayne&mdash;" He caught her hand gently and drew it to her
lap. "I have not had experience of your ability with that little
toy, so&mdash;" He picked up the automatic. "May I? I should
greatly appreciate it as a&mdash;a&mdash;memento of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely you don't expect to escape again?" The girl's brows
arched.</p>

<p>"I may be lucky&mdash;again." 'Cain' smiled slightly. "Why
not?"</p>

<p>The girl did not answer immediately. "If I call out&mdash;" she
said at length.</p>

<p>"You will not."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>Martha paused. "I think I shall."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you have bolted the door."</p>

<p>"Mr Luther Banke will hear me."</p>

<p>"Will that affect the&mdash;er&mdash;situation?"</p>

<p>Martha shook her head, decidedly.</p>

<p>"No. Mr Luther Banke is not well. No, I shall not call out.'</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why did you come back here?"</p>

<p>"I wonder if you would be offended if I told you?"</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;a thief?"</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;a man."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;Can a thief be a&mdash;man?"</p>

<p>'Cain' turned and strode across the room. Martha's eyes went to
the drawer where still lay her automatic. Almost her hand went out
to it; then she drew back. No, she could not do that!</p>

<p>Yet the man was a thief. He had gone from that room a little
more than a couple of hours before carrying with him the Montgomery
emeralds. He might have them on him at that moment. If she snatched
at her automatic; bailed him up and called for help; the man could
not evade capture. She would be praised&mdash;rewarded&mdash;and
he&mdash;Somehow she could not visualise him in prison&mdash;a
creature behind bars. Always she would see him as he stood in that
room, alone, playing a dangerous game against the enemies
surrounding him. "Cain," alone, the outcast, fighting against every
man&mdash;every man's hand against him!</p>

<p>The warm colour surged to her face and neck. What was she
thinking; what was she doing? The man was a criminal&mdash;one of
those beings the newspapers and fiction writers named
"master-criminals." He was a danger to society&mdash;yet, somehow,
he made her think of the wild animals, following out the dictates
of their instincts in the jungle, fighting, lone-handed, against
Nature and their natural enemies in the age-old war of
self-preservation.</p>

<p>A wave of sympathy for him&mdash;hunted and
friendless&mdash;swept over her, and again the warm colour rose to
her face.</p>

<p>"Well?" 'Cain' swung violently on his heels to face her. "What
do you want to do?"</p>

<p>"Why did you come back?" Martha dare not look up as she asked
the question.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>The girl did not answer. She could not. For moments she sat,
impotent, then reached under the desk and released the
door-lever.</p>

<p>The slight sound made the man turn quickly. Immediately he
recognised what she had done, and laughed, quaintly and
happily.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the gun, Miss&mdash;Martha?"</p>

<p>Without speaking, she took it from the drawer and held it out to
him.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are on my side?" The words came in a low, fierce
whisper.</p>

<p>"No." Martha spoke firmly, yet her heart betrayed her words.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went to the desk in a few quick strides, standing before the
girl and looking down on her. Martha knew he was there, but she
dared not look up.</p>

<p>"If you will excuse me, Ser&mdash;Mr Davidson, I have important
work waiting. As no doubt you remember, we missed the overseas mail
this morning and that has entailed a lot of&mdash;a lot
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>The hot tears came to her eyes and she brushed them away,
angrily, with the back of her hand; but the tears only came faster.
She groped for her handkerchief, and rubbed her eyes vigorously,
angrily. When she looked up, she was alone in the room.</p>

<p>And, at her elbow stood the familiar long, narrow
box&mdash;open, and blazing brilliantly on their bed of white
velvet&mdash;the Montgomery emeralds!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">"SO it's 'Cain' again?" Sir Edmund Morgan,
Commissioner for Police, looked up from beneath his shaggy
eyebrows. He had the uncanny ability of making officers
interviewing him feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"So Miss Tayne said, sir."</p>

<p>Mark Denvers, Detective-Inspector, answered with some
disquietude. "She said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is Miss Tayne?"</p>

<p>"Miss Martha Tayne, personal secretary to Mr Luther Banke, of
Luther Banke and Co."</p>

<p>The detective particularised carefully.</p>

<p>"Well? What had she to say?"</p>

<p>"Very little, sir. She didn't want to talk&mdash;for some
reason."</p>

<p>"Yet she told you that the thief's name was 'Cain?' How did she
know that?"</p>

<p>"He told her&mdash;when he returned the jewels."</p>

<p>"Cain!" Sir Edmund frowned. "New habit of his, isn't it&mdash;to
first steal the jewels and then return them?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand it, sir." Denvers' uneasiness was growing.
"The Montgomery emeralds are well worth getting away with."</p>

<p>"So has been the other plunder 'Cain' has handled." The
commissioner laughed shortly. "Quite too smart for you people eh?
Gets into the place as Luther Banke and loots the jewels; goes in
again as Detective-Sergeant Davidson&mdash;By the way, what
happened to him?"</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne called the Criminal Investigation Branch and said
that Luther Banke and Co. had been robbed of the Montgomery
emeralds. Detective-Sergeant Davidson was detailed for the
investigation. As he was leaving the office word came through that
'Cain' had committed the theft and that he was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who brought in that information?"</p>

<p>"It was supposed to be a telephone message from plain-clothes
constable Chevers."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;it didn't come from him? Of course not! Well, go
on."</p>

<p>"The message gave the information that 'Cain' had a flat at
Alford Mansions. Sergeant Davidson went there and-"</p>

<p>"Went out; of course! 'Cain' was there waiting for him." The
commissioner laughed harshly. "What on earth are you fellows
thinking of?"</p>

<p>"No one would expect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not with 'Cain'?" Sir Edmund laughed again, sarcastically.
"Lord, man! We've had all this before. Have you forgotten the
States Bank affair? You were bit there, Denvers. 'Cain' had you on
toast. Pulled the wires and you danced to his tune! Then there was
the matter of the Town Hall frauds. Forgotten that? And Lady
Michaelstein's collarette? One would have thought that 'Cain' had
taught you something by this time. But he hasn't! Again the same
old tale. Gets you fellows where he wants you and then-"</p>

<p>"I shall be pleased to hand you my resignation, sir." Denvers
spoke stiffly.</p>

<p>"I'll talk to you about that&mdash;when you have 'Cain' behind
bars." The old chief smiled grimly. "And that's not going to be
long ahead, let me tell you!"</p>

<p>For some moments the old man sat musing.</p>

<p>'Cain'!</p>

<p>Somewhere in his brain was almost admiration for the debonair
crook. The keen analytical mind behind the keen, grey eyes could
fathom and appreciate the marvellous ability for intrigue&mdash;for
out-guessing his opponents&mdash;latent in the master-criminal. If
only he could slough from his shoulders the accumulated years and
take the trail against so worthy an opponent.</p>

<p>The man had defied his department&mdash;yet he could not
withhold a certain liking, a certain respect. The man had fought
cleanly, fairly, treating the battle as if it were a splendid game
in which his freedom was the stake&mdash;a game played to rules
that were not declared&mdash;rules superior to the laws he defied
and laughed at.</p>

<p>'Cain!' Sir Edmund chuckled under the thick, grey moustache
shielding his thin, firm lips. He knew, by memory, the many and
varied descriptions of the crook which had been brought to him.
'Cain'! The man of many disguises&mdash;the man who could flee down
a street before the officers of the law; to turn and walk past them
in quite another identity. The man was a genius a man who would
have gone far within the legal hedges.</p>

<p>Sir Edmund was certain that not one man under his command had
ever come face to face with the real man.</p>

<p>Had this girl&mdash;this Martha Tayne&mdash;seen the real
'Cain'? Why had the man gone back to the jewellers' offices, after
he had the jewels he had risked so much to gain, in his possession?
What had taken him there? Why had he abandoned the gems? Why had he
placed them on the girl's desk&mdash;after spending more than an
hour in her office, discussing the theft of the jewels? What did
the girl know?</p>

<p>Sir Edmund looked down at the report on the desk before him. It
was brief, pointed and coldly correct. What was behind it? What had
been left out of that report? The girl&mdash;this Martha
Tayne&mdash;had made a statement. Was it a full statement of all
she knew? What had she left out of it?</p>

<p>From the papers the commissioner looked up at the man before
him. What was he thinking of? The keen, young-old eyes searched the
man's face; striving to read the thoughts behind the inscrutable
eyes. He had sent for this man, not to hear his words but to search
out the thoughts dominant, or perhaps seething, in his brain.</p>

<p>For Denvers had been the leader of the hunters. He had been the
man appointed to bring 'Cain' before the bar of the laws he had
offended. And Denvers had failed&mdash;not once but time and time
again.</p>

<p>Sir Edmund smiled&mdash;secretly. He had not blamed the
detective for his failures. If the man was worth his salt&mdash;and
the commissioner had faith in him&mdash;he would be blaming himself
inordinately.</p>

<p>At the time of Denvers' last failure he had stood between him
and the minister's just wrath; between him and the newspapers and
public opinion, who were demanding a scapegoat for the department's
failure to lay the notorious master-criminal by the heels.</p>

<p>The smile broadened as Sir Edmund thought of a note that lay in
his office safe. In that note 'Cain' had expressed his admiration
for the abilities of the baffled detective, discounting his
failures to capture the writer with the explanation that the
detective was too honest for the task&mdash;that only a man
possessing the 'criminal mind' could ever succeed.</p>

<p>The criminal mind! The commissioner wondered. Had he now, or had
he ever, possessed "the criminal mind?"</p>

<p>In his more active days he had written in the book of his life;
a long list of successes. Had those successes been due to his
possession of a "criminal mind?"</p>

<p>For more than a year 'Cain' had rested from his activities. Not
one single robbery or theft could be placed to his account during
that period. Now he had re-appeared. Was the city again to writhe
under a new wave of criminal activity? Did 'Cain' intend to
organise a further series of adventures&mdash;thefts that would
augment the very large sums he had gained by his former
activities?</p>

<p>"Get 'Cain'!"</p>

<p>The cold, steel-grey eyes were again lifted to the detective's
face. "Get 'Cain', Denvers! You've got to get him, and that before
he goes too far again."</p>

<p>"I've done my best, sir." The detective shifted uneasily on his
chair. There was a queer hesitancy in his tones.</p>

<p>"You've got to get him." Sir Edmund leaned forward, his voice
tense. "Do you hear me? You've got to bring in 'Cain,' at all
cost." He waited a moment, then continued more quietly.</p>

<p>"You remember twelve months ago? 'Cain' beat you then. The
newspapers were laughing, jeering at you&mdash;insisting that I
stripped the coat from your back&mdash;lashed you out of the
department&mdash;put another man on the crook's trail. Do you know
what saved you then?"</p>

<p>The detective shook his head. His cheeks flamed with colour; his
throat was too choked with emotion for him to speak.</p>

<p>"'Cain' saved you." The commissioner continued. "'Cain' wrote to
me. He claimed you to be a good man; deficient only in one
thing&mdash;that gift that could successfully trail him to justice.
Do you wish to know what that gift is?"</p>

<p>Still the detective held silence.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;'Cain'&mdash;claimed that you would never place your
hand on his shoulder. He wrote that you were a good man&mdash;in
your line. That in search of the murderer, the average
house-breaker, the confidence-man, you were successful; but that
matched against wits&mdash;the super-intelligence of the
master-crook&mdash;you must always fail; because you did not
possess the criminal mind."</p>

<p>"The criminal mind?"</p>

<p>Denvers looked blankly at his chief.</p>

<p>"The criminal mind."</p>

<p>The sparsely-covered, grey head nodded. "That is what he
wrote&mdash;and I believe him to be right." Sir Edmund hesitated,
then continued: "Superintendent Lorrimer has assigned this
case&mdash;the hunting down of 'Cain' to Detective-Sergeant
Davidson. That is his business. Lorrimer must work in his own way,
for the responsibility is his. I don't, as a rule, interfere with
my officers, even when I don't agree with their methods and
actions. All I want from them are results. But in this matter I
have avoided my own rule. I have requisitioned you for special
duty. Do you understand what I mean? No? Then listen:&mdash;"</p>

<p>For moments there was silence in the big room. The
commissioner's eyes were steady on the detective's face, searching
every line, every change of expression.</p>

<p>"You and 'Cain' fought a great duel&mdash;a three years'
duel&mdash;to a stalemate&mdash;a draw, if you prefer to so name
it. The affair cannot be allowed to end there; this department must
always win. I thought&mdash;I knew&mdash;that 'Cain' would one day
reappear. He has. Now the duel is to be resumed. The fight is
yours, personally. You must take the challenge this crook has
offered you. He has named the ground on which the fight is to be
resumed&mdash;you must take that ground&mdash;and win."</p>

<p>"You mean-"</p>

<p>"The ground of the 'criminal mind.' Yes, Denvers, you must
acquire the criminal mind, and succeed. And for that purpose you
must have against you not only 'Cain,' the master-criminal, but
this department!"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"You must acquire the criminal mind&mdash;you must be a
criminal. Superintendent Lorrimer has chosen his man. He had told
me he does not consider you can succeed against 'Cain.' Thus, he
had nominated his champion&mdash;Davidson. That is his right;
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly the fire went out of the old man's eyes; his shoulders
drooped. He sat back, gripping the arms of his chair, tiredly.
"Don't mistake me, Denvers. I am not counselling you to become a
crook. I dare not do that. But to succeed, you must wear the cloak
of a crook; you must have in this department&mdash;the record and
reputation of a crook. Gain that, and I swear you will bring in
'Cain'!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" Denvers muttered under his breath. He looked at his
chief wonderingly.</p>

<p>Sir Edmund shook his head.</p>

<p>"We've got to go through with this, Denvers. 'Cain' must be
stopped&mdash;and you must stop him. I&mdash;I want to see you in
Lorrimer's place when I pass my burdens on to younger shoulders.
Yes, yes! Lorrimer will come here&mdash;there is no other man in
the department ready for the job. You must take his
chair&mdash;but&mdash;but at present this is impossible. With
'Cain's' list of successes against you, I dare not make the
recommendation. You must&mdash;you shall&mdash;succeed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;sir!" The detective hesitated. "I don't think I
understand. Are you instructing me&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I dare not instruct, Denvers."</p>

<p>"Suggesting&mdash;that I become a criminal&mdash;an associate of
criminals?"</p>

<p>"Just that." The old chief nodded. "You must assume the
garb&mdash;and it must fit as your own skin; yet you must keep a
clear conscience. God knows how you can do that&mdash;but do it you
must!"</p>

<p>Sir Edmund slid forward on his chair, staring up at the
detective with penetrating eyes. "today&mdash;now&mdash;you will
write your resignation from this department. Tomorrow you will
leave this building, as an officer of this department; perhaps
never to return. That depends on you&mdash;and the Good God who
rules all things. I shall gazette you&mdash;resigned&mdash;and
shall not give a reason. Do you realise what that means?"</p>

<p>The detective nodded.</p>

<p>"With this hew adventure of 'Cain's,' old matter will be
resurrected. Your failures will be remembered against you.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Sir Edmund hesitated.</p>

<p>"I shall give no reason for your resignation, but the newspapers
will point one out to their public. The official information given
out will be that you have resigned and that Davidson has been
assigned to tracking down 'Cain.' You know how they will couple
that information. Are you prepared for what will follow&mdash;or
have I to place a reason in the <i>Gazette</i> against your
resignation?"</p>

<p>Dumbly, Denvers shook his head. His face had paled to the hue of
death; his body shook with the emotion he could not suppress.</p>

<p>"It will be hard, Denvers&mdash;cruelly hard; but the department
comes first. You know that! Detective-Inspector Mark Denvers will
resign&mdash;and disappear. In his stead, on the roll of the
earth's inhabitants will appear the name of James Frost, a crook, a
criminal, a denizen of this city's underworld&mdash;a man with a
long record of crime.</p>

<p>"Remember, Mark Denvers, James Frost has lived. I have his
record here&mdash;and it is not a nice one."</p>

<p>The old man placed his hand on a file of papers.</p>

<p>"That will be your record&mdash;until 'Cain' rests securely
behind iron bars. Listen:</p>

<p>"James Frost died in Sing Sing prison three days ago. I received
a cable to that effect from the U.S. authorities this morning.
Immediately, I cabled back asking that the news be not given to the
press. It will not. I shall suppress all news of his death. The
world will be told that James Frost escaped from Sing Sing."</p>

<p>Again the commissioner paused, watching the police officer with
keen searching eyes.</p>

<p>"You will be James Frost, Mark Denvers. You will be the crook
who escaped from Sing Sing. You came to Sydney, to escape from the
U.S. police. You came to the Australian underworld&mdash;and there
sought confederacy with 'Cain.' Mark Denvers resigned from the
department&mdash;disgraced."</p>

<p>For minutes there was silence in the long room on the first
floor of Police Headquarters. In a dim corner the tall
grandfather's clock slowly marked the seconds passing into
eternity. Suddenly Denvers raised his head, a look of resolution in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr Commissioner-"</p>

<p>The shrill ring of the telephone bell broke on the
police-officer's words. Without speaking, Sir Edmund shifted round
on his seat and raised the receiver to his ear.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Is that Sir Edmund Morgan speaking?"</p>

<p>"It is. Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Cain." The voice was soft and deferential. "May I convey my
respectful regard to yourself&mdash;and Mister Denvers?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">MARK DENVERS left the Commissioner's office much
perplexed. He went slowly down the stairs and into the street,
nodding carelessly to men he met on the way. Once he turned and
looked back, at a couple of men entering Police
Headquarters&mdash;men he had worked with long and intimately.
Brother officers! Once he had been proud to claim them that. Now?
Now they were no longer "brother officers"&mdash;they were
strangers&mdash;people of a strange race. They were without his
vision; soon&mdash;he shrugged slightly&mdash;soon they would be
active antagonists!</p>

<p>He laughed. But a few minutes before he had sat at the
Commissioner's desk, writing his resignation from the Police
Department. That resignation would be made public the next day.
Then the country would know that "Cain" had reappeared on the scene
of his old activities and triumphs, and that he, Mark Denvers,
one-time Inspector of Detectives. had resigned. What would people
say? What would the news-men write? Would they declare that he had
resigned because of the reappearance of his old foe? A dull flush
mounted to his face; his shoulders lifted irritably.</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p>When they&mdash;the newspapers and the public&mdash;learned that
he had gone down into the underworld! When they realised that he
had become a crook. When they recorded the activities of his old
comrades as they strove to track him down&mdash;convict
him&mdash;send him to prison!</p>

<p>No, thank God! That humiliation was spared him! He would
disappear. From now he was James Frost. Only Sir Edmund and himself
knew the truth. Yet the hunt after "James Frost" would be keen and
sincere. The men he had so long consorted with would do their
uttermost to capture and convict him.</p>

<p>He would have no court of appeal&mdash;no rights but those of
the sneak-thief, the purse-snatcher, the whizz, dip, doper, and
thug. Almost he realised why the man he had sworn to hunt
down&mdash;the man whom to find he was stepping down into the
depths of earth's hell&mdash;had named himself "Cain."</p>

<p>For some moments Denvers stood on the pavement, undecided as to
his first actions. The events of the morning had marched so swiftly
that as yet he had no plans formed, or even nebulous in his brain.
All he realised was that he had to find "Cain"&mdash;get in touch
with him; make him a friend, a comrade&mdash;then betray him.
"Cain!" Where should he find him? Instinctively, to his mind came
the thoughts of the girl&mdash;Martha Tayne; the girl who had last
seen and spoken to the man. Could she tell him anything new? Had
she, in her previous talks with him, missed any vital point in her
brief account of her interview with the man?</p>

<p>Martha Tayne! Denvers smiled at the name. Martha Tayne! She, the
lawyer, Alec Kempton, the shop-assistant, Forde, and
Detective-Sergeant Davidson, comprised those who had seen the
master-criminal on his last adventure.</p>

<p>What could they tell him? He had seen them, one and
all&mdash;and their accounts had materially differed. Martha Tayne
had seen the man three times&mdash;and each time he had seemed to
her a different identity, she had been insistent on that point. He
had changed, not only in personal appearance but in his very
thought processes, expressions, mannerisms. Denvers wondered. Could
any man do that? Why had "Cain" returned the Montgomery
emeralds&mdash;and to the girl; leaving them lying on her desk,
after being with her for more than half-an-hour, alone?</p>

<p>Again Denvers shrugged. The affair was incomprehensible! "Cain"
had taken too great pains; plotted too carefully to steal the
jewels&mdash;and had then abandoned them. Why?</p>

<p>Impulsively, the ex-detective turned and walked down to the main
street. He must find an answer to some of the many questions
crowding his brain. Where should he start? What point in the
disconnected stories surrounding the re-appearance of the
master-crook could he lay hold of to give him the clue he sought?
He could no longer rely on the orthodox police methods in which he
had been trained. No longer had he an efficient organisation to
which to call for support. Now he was a lone hand, playing against
a lone hand. The fight was between "Cain," the master-crook, and
"Jimmie Frost" alias Mark Denvers.</p>

<p>Outside the discreetly groomed windows of Luther Banke &amp;
Co., Jimmie Frost hesitated. The Montgomery emeralds were in the
window, still in their long, narrow, jewellers' case, mounted on a
small stand. On the pavement was gathered a small crowd, intent on
personal examination of the gems which had occupied much news-space
that morning&mdash;gems that had attracted the covetousness of the
much-advertised crook&mdash;"Cain."</p>

<p>"Good-morning. Miss Tayne." The detective stood just within the
office door, watching the girl narrowly. "Can you spare me a few
minutes?"</p>

<p>"Is it important, Mr&mdash;Inspector." The man thought she paled
slightly at the realisation of his presence. "We&mdash;we are very
busy this morning. Yesterday-"</p>

<p>"Yesterday threw matters out of gear." The man who now was
Jimmie Frost laughed gently as he went to the girl's desk. "Of
course!" Yet he knew that he must press his point. Tomorrow the
news would race through the city. Detective-Inspector Mark Denvers
had resigned&mdash;rather than face a renewal of the duel with the
noted master-crook, "Cain!" He could not come to her then.</p>

<p>"I shall not trouble you long."</p>

<p>"Very well." With a little impatient shrug Martha pushed the
papers from her, swinging her chair half-round from the desk. "What
is it you want to know, Mr&mdash;Inspector Denvers?"</p>

<p>"Mister will do." The ex-detective's mouth twisted bitterly at
the evasion. For a moment he waited, looking down on the girl, then
drew a chair to the side of her desk.</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne, what did 'Cain' say when he gave you the
emeralds?"</p>

<p>The girl's face lost colour&mdash;this time quickly; to be
flooded by a flush that stained neck and cheeks. Almost Denvers
nodded. He knew now that his subconscious guess had been right.
"Cain" had not returned the jewels under the urge of conscience. He
had had an ulterior object. What could that have been?</p>

<p>"Mr. 'Cain' did not return the jewels to me&mdash;he left them
on my desk when he left the room."</p>

<p>"And walked out of the door, unmolested?" The ex-detective
paused. "You knew that he was 'Cain'&mdash;the much advertised
criminal?"</p>

<p>"He told me his name." The girl spoke under her breath.
"He&mdash;he stole the emeralds&mdash;and made restitution of
them."</p>

<p>"You did not raise an immediate alarm?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Although you realised that a thief was escaping?"</p>

<p>"For the moment&mdash;no. I was not&mdash;well."</p>

<p>"When you did raise the alarm, 'Cain' was far from the shop?"
The girl bowed her head in assent of what was not a question but a
statement. "Had you a reason, Miss Tayne, for that delay?"</p>

<p>"No." A long pause, then the girl spoke again; "I was surprised.
I had to think. I had to inform Mr. Luther Banke first."</p>

<p>"You informed him about a quarter of an hour after 'Cain' passed
through the shop to the street." Denvers pressed his point
relentlessly.</p>

<p>"It may have been that." Martha raised her head proudly.
"Mr&mdash;Inspector Denvers, are you accusing me of being a
confederate of a thief?"</p>

<p>"I am testing motives, times, positions." The ex-detective spoke
determinedly. "I know your actions&mdash;I have been able to check
them by those of others. But I do not know the actions of 'Cain'.
There you are baffling me; why?"</p>

<p>For some moments the girl did not reply. She was looking down at
her notebook, open on the desk before her; her pencil, held loosely
in her fingers, made indecipherable marks on the page. She looked
up at the ex-detective, seated by the desk, searching her face with
penetrating, eager glances.</p>

<p>"You accuse me of protecting Mr.&mdash;'Cain'?" she said at
length. "Will you&mdash;will you repeat that accusation to Mr.
Luther Banke?"</p>

<p>"Is there necessity for me to see Mr. Banke?" countered Denvers
quickly. "I have made no accusation."</p>

<p>"You accuse me of holding back information," Martha smiled.</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>"You think so." A long pause. "I have told you all I know."</p>

<p>"All?"</p>

<p>"Is it necessary for me to reveal my thoughts&mdash;they
are&mdash;may not be evidence."</p>

<p>Denvers did not speak. Now he knew that the girl was concealing
something. What had she to conceal? He knew that until 'Cain' came
to Luther Banke's shop the girl had never set eyes on the man. How
had he gained this influence over her? "You think that I sympathise
with 'Cain'?" The girl spoke proudly. "I do. I&mdash;I think there
is good in him. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps he has been unjustly hounded
by the law. Who knows? I do not. I do not know his
history&mdash;only his name."</p>

<p>"Is 'Cain' his name?"</p>

<p>"Why ask me?" The girl rose abruptly from her chair. "It may
be&mdash;that he is aptly named. 'Cain'&mdash;with every man's hand
against him! 'Cain'&mdash;with the mark of those 'set-apart' on his
forehead! 'Cain'&mdash;who suffered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Cain'&mdash;the murderer!" Denvers interrupted sternly. "Have
you sympathy with a murderer, Miss Tayne?" Again the girl was
silent. She went to the barred windows, overlooking the
side-street.</p>

<p>Presently she turned to face the room. "Sometimes I think I
understand." Almost she was speaking to herself. "He calls himself
'Cain'. For what reason? There is no blood-guilt on his
brow&mdash;he told me that. Then, why 'Cain'? 'Cain', set apart
from his fellows&mdash;a solitary man, with every other man's hand
upraised against him. Is that the reason? I wonder!"</p>

<p>Her words went straight to the heart of the ex-detective. They
pierced through the armour of conventionality he had striven to
cloak about him since he had sat at the Police Commissioner's desk,
writing his resignation from the Department he had served so
faithfully. They brought back to memory the words Sir Edmund had
used: "&mdash;on the roll of this world will appear the name of
James Frost, a crook, a denizen of this city's underworld&mdash;"
Himself the man! For the moment he had the urge to tell this girl
all; of the interview he had had that morning with the Commissioner
of Police; of his resignation from the Police Department; of his
coming descent into the underworld of the city.</p>

<p>He stiffened. Those facts he had to keep secret; no one but Sir
Edmund must know that in them he was merely acting a part; that his
"disgrace" was but a cloak, from behind which he would spy and
betray.</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne!" Neither of them had heard the door open and Luther
Banke enter the room. "Have you that letter from the Goldsmiths'
Jewellery Company? I don't think we answered that inquiry regarding
pink pearls."</p>

<p>"You answered that letter late yesterday afternoon, Mr. Banke."
Martha was again the efficient, deft secretary. "I typed it and
sent it to the post this morning."</p>

<p>The girl went to an open filing cabinet, her quick fingers
ruffling the papers. She found a sheet of coloured paper and handed
it to her employer. Luther Banke read the carbon copy of the letter
slowly, a puzzled frown on his face. Meanwhile Denvers studied the
jeweller. The man was nervous. The ex-detective noticed that the
hand holding the letter trembled. He noted the thinness of the
bearded face, the hair heavily sprinkled with grey. The beard was
close-cropped, coming to a short point under the chin. He saw that
the eyes were lined and weary&mdash;and he watched two deep furrows
appear on the tired brow.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that letter, Miss Tayne?" asked Luther Banke
wearily. "I never dictated this."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Banke?" Denvers took a quick step
forward. "Miss Tayne states that she took dictation of this letter
late last night, and posted it early this morning. Did you not see
that letter after it was typed?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke forgets." There was much sympathy in the girl's
voice. "You must remember, Mr&mdash;Inspector Denvers, that he is
not at all well."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Mr. Luther Banke dictated that letter. You are quite
sure of that?" The ex-detective spoke eagerly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Luther Banke came back from the street last night,
specially to dictate that letter to me." Martha spoke evenly. "I
was then clearing up, preparatory to going home. He said that he
must answer the Goldsmiths' Jewellery Company's letter before he
left in case he was detained at home this morning. I took the
dictation from him. He said I could type the letter immediately I
arrived this morning and&mdash;and that if he had not arrived by
ten o'clock I was to sign it and post immediately."</p>

<p>"You typed the letter this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And placed it, and a carbon copy, on Mr. Luther Banke's
desk?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What time did Mr. Luther Banke arrive here this morning?"</p>

<p>"Quite early; shortly after I did&mdash;and I was here
punctually at nine-thirty."</p>

<p>"I did not leave home until a quarter to ten." The jeweller
spoke with keen anxiety.</p>

<p>"Did you dictate that letter?" Denvers swung round on the man,
abruptly.</p>

<p>"No." The negative was firmly spoken; yet there was a trace of
hesitancy in Luther Banke's manner.</p>

<p>"What time did you leave here last night?"</p>

<p>"A few minutes to six." The ex-detective looked at the girl.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Mr. Luther Banke went from his office at five minutes to six. I
followed him into the shop. He was there, talking to the
shop-manager, for some minutes, then went through the street-door.
Five minutes later he returned and called me into his private
office, and dictated the letter to me." The girl's reply was
decisive.</p>

<p>"My car was at the door. I entered it and my man drove me
straight home. I never re-entered the shop or my room."</p>

<p>Denvers stared at the girl and man in amazement. He felt that
they were telling the exact truth, as they knew it. Then, who had
come into that office a few minutes after Luther Banke had left it
for the night&mdash;disguised as Luther Banke?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">THE man now named "Jimmie Frost," late of
Sing-Sing prison, and more remotely of Melbourne, Australia, stared
down from the window of the American-type flat he now occupied.
Almost at his feet lay the panorama of the largest city in the
southern hemisphere. For three days&mdash;since he had come to
those rooms as occupant&mdash;he had not been outside the door.
Almost he feared the streets. Had he so altered that he could brave
security, in a city where he was well known?</p>

<p>He turned sharply on his heels and went to the fly-blown mirror
over the sideboard, examining his features critically. The room was
littered with newspapers. His two chief occupations during his
short tenancy of the flat had been the obliteration of his former
identity and a careful search of the newspapers. For what? News of
"Cain?"</p>

<p>He smiled grimly as thoughts of the crook flashed across his
mind. "Cain!" The man against whom every hand was raised! Martha
Tayne, the girl in the jeweller's office, had used that phrase.
Where had she obtained it? From "Cain" himself? There was scarcely
a doubt regarding that. "Cain" had thus explained his strange alias
to the girl. She had accepted it; glorifying it&mdash;and had
allowed the phrase to cast a glamour about the man himself. Was
Martha Tayne in love with "Cain?"</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost, the man who had once been Mark Denvers,
Detective-Inspector of police, pondered the question. That might be
so. If, then&mdash;Would that fact complicate his problem?</p>

<p>Again he turned abruptly from the window, going into the
miniature kitchen of his flat. Behind the sink was a window. He
opened it, and looked out, down a light-well. Two storeys down, oh
the opposite wall, was a small window. That window lighted Martha
Tayne's flat. Had the girl's presence been the reason he had come
to that building? An involuntary shrug answered his question. He
believed&mdash;he knew&mdash;that where Martha Tayne lived there,
sooner or later, he would find a clue that would lead him to
"Cain."</p>

<p>For three days he had lived in the building&mdash;watching, yet
wary that he, himself, should not be seen. He was not yet ready to
face people; his disguise was not yet perfect. Now, in two more
days he would be free to come and go as he chose. Thus had declared
the old Indian fakir to whom he had gone on leaving Luther Banke's
shop, with the demand to be completely altered in face and figure.
Five days the old man had required for the task, declaring that at
the end of that period he would be unrecognised by any comrade in
the police department, unless the infallible Bertillon measurements
were applied; unless his fingerprints were on record. At the end of
five days he would be a new man!</p>

<p>Five days of inaction, except for the periodical application of
the stains and rank-smelling oils; except for the almost daily
readjustment of the strangely shaped physical appliances the old
Indian had provided. Three of the five days had passed and as time
had progressed he had found himself eagerly watching the mirror,
fascinated in studying the strange personage growing from his old
identity. For three days unguents, oils, torturing surgical
appliances&mdash;and the continued watch on Martha Tayne's
flat&mdash;had filled his days. Only two more days and he would be
once more free!</p>

<p>Free! He almost laughed aloud at the thought! Free! Would he
ever again be free?</p>

<p>Impatiently, he went to the table and picked up a thin
manuscript book filled with fine, minute writing. In this book was
the complement of his disguise&mdash;the record of the life and
works of James Frost, international crook. Two more days, and he
would cast the book into the fire&mdash;his disguise complete,
physically and mentally. Sir Edmund Morgan, Commissioner of Police,
had sent that book to him. The minute writings on the thin leaves
was his. From where had the Police Chief obtained these
facts&mdash;for facts only the book contained? The record was
complete, every detail in place; almost every day, every hour
accounted for, except&mdash;the inglorious climax, played within
the old grey walls, "up the river" from New York.</p>

<p>Yet Jimmie Frost still lived! It was Mark Denvers who was dead!
Insistently the man beat that fact on to his consciousness. He had
to forget the man who had once been a Detective-Inspector of polie.
He dared not remember him, the life he had led, the ambitions he
had held. With a shrug of impatience, he picked up a newspaper,
glancing casually down the columns.</p>

<p>A sharp exclamation escaped his lips. "Cain" had been busy
again! For long moments Jimmie Frost stared at the bold headlines
staggered across the page. This time the Southern Shires Bank had
been the victim. From under the eyes of the assistant manager a
bundle of negotiable securities had been taken. The crime bore all
the characteristic marks of the super-crook.</p>

<p>"Cain" had not troubled to conceal his tracks. He had walked
into the bank during the busiest hours of the day, receiving and
acknowledging the respectful salute of the door commissionaire;
posing as an old and valued customer. At the desk, he had demanded
immediate access to the assistant manager&mdash;and all doors had
opened before him. In the inner office, he had asked for certain
securities in the keeping of the bank. These had been produced
without question&mdash;and "Cain" had, almost negligently, signed a
receipt for them, using the name of&mdash;</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost's eyes narrowed when he read the name of the robbed
customer. For what reason was "Cain" paying particular attention to
Luther Banke? He had stolen the Montgomery emeralds&mdash;to
restore them intact within a few hours. He had delighted in posing
as the jeweller, in the man's own office&mdash;dictating his
letters, deceiving his staff. Now he had impersonated Luther Banke
before the assistant manager of his bank, obtaining securities
valued at many thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>Perplexed and worried, the ex-detective strode up and down the
small room trying to penetrate the meaning behind the newspaper
words. Why was "Cain" devoting so much attention to Luther Banke?
Was it his intention to ruin the man? If so, then why had he
returned the emeralds?</p>

<p>Suddenly Jimmie Frost uttered an exclamation. Had the clue he
was searching for come to him? He went to the sideboard and pulled
out one of the drawers. Turning the contents on to the table, he
turned the drawer over. A few deft touches and the bottom wood gave
under his fingers. A space, barely half an inch deep, lay between
the false and real bottoms.</p>

<p>Held under an elastic web was another manuscript book. The
ex-detective carried it to the window. Here was the history of the
man who had named himself "Cain." But a few pages, written in the
same small handwriting in which the "Book of James Frost" had been
written. Still a record of a life of crime but scanty in details,
containing mainly vague conclusions based on admitted theory, for
the super crook had never fallen into the hands of authority, and
his identity was not even suspected.</p>

<p>A record of crime&mdash;crime unique and daring; the history of
a master of disguise. It read like the biography of an old-time
adventurer&mdash;one who played the Game of Life without the
conventional rules and laws of our civilisation; yet who used those
very rules to overcome the barriers Society had erected for its
defence.</p>

<p>A low whistle of astonishment escaped Jimmie Frost's lips. Had
he found the clue he sought? He believed he had; yet where would it
lead him? "Cain" had victimised only five men during his
sensational criminal career. Five men&mdash;and the ex-detective
knew that from those five men "Cain" had taken a large fortune! Was
that the clue he had sought so long?</p>

<p>The ex-detective drew a writing-pad towards him and wrote down
the names, adding what details he could remember against each name.
Once he paused in his task and looked at the clock. Had he time to
get his facts into something like order? At length he sat back and
read over his notes. The trail to "Cain" was becoming more
definite&mdash;but it was also broadening. He sighed, partly with
satisfaction. Again he read what he had written, this time
aloud.</p>

<p>AUGUSTUS PELL: Financier. Robbed by "Cain" of approximately
£5,000 in stocks and other securities&mdash;all easily
negotiable&mdash;during the year 1919. Pell had died in the fall of
that year.</p>

<p>SIR AARON MICHAELSTEIN: Company Promoter. Had always described
himself as Managing Director of The Argosy Insurance Company.
"Cain" had robbed him of over £15,000. That "adventure" had
occurred during the two years succeeding Augustus Pell's death.</p>

<p>Sir Aaron had died about six months after the frauds had been
discovered. Among the loot taken by "Cain" had been the famous
collarette of pearls belonging to Lady Michaelstein.</p>

<p>Again Jimmie Frost turned to the pages of the records book. He
knew that every word in that book was accurate&mdash;it had been
recorded by the Police Commissioner, personally. Two other names
came before the records of "Cain's" attacks on Luther Banke's
fortune. After a moment's hesitation he turned to the end of the
record and entered the details of "Cain's" latest exploit. Then he
turned back to "Cain's" third adventure.</p>

<p>ALDERMAN JOHN SYMONDS&mdash;commonly spoken of by his admirers
as "Honest John"&mdash;had attracted "Cain's" attention, For many
months, even years, the municipal boss had concealed the large
depredations on his fortune and income, by the super-crook. In
stolid silence he had allowed himself to be mercilessly "bled." How
much "Cain" had stolen could only be estimated. John Symonds had
died by his own hand, after an anonymous letter had reached the
Lord Mayor's hands, exposing immense graft frauds. Could that
exposure be traced to "Cain?"</p>

<p>"Cain" had next turned his attention to ANDREW WILSON.</p>

<p>Why Andrew Wilson? The man had saved the wool industry of the
country, at a time when large foreigninterests were threatening
overseas markets. He had flung his great fortune into the fight,
inducing others to follow his lead, stabilising prices, and finally
securing the industry on a firm basis. He had been acclaimed a
national hero&mdash;even during his lifetime there had been talk of
erecting a statue in his honour. The statue had materialised twelve
months after his death.</p>

<p>"Cain" had robbed Andrew Wilson&mdash;robbed him flagrantly and
unmercifully. Rumoursinsisted that the wool kind had lost over a
hundred thousand pounds through "Cain's" activities. Five men;
Pell, Michaelstein, Symonds, Wilson, and now Luther Banke. How were
these men connected in the mind of the super-crook? Five
men&mdash;and four of them were dead!</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost went to the window and looked down on the city,
shimmering under the hot summer afternoon sun. Somewhere in that
maze of brick and stone was "Cain"&mdash;the man he had sworn to
hunt down, and to whose destruction he had sacrificed rank, and
even name. Could he connect these five men together? A financier, a
company promoter, a city alderman, a squatter, and a jeweller.
Almost it seemed, from the record of their activities, that "Cain"
had chosen them haphazardly. Yet the records showed that in nearly
seven years of criminal activity "Cain" had robbed only these
men.</p>

<p>Who was "Cain?" If only he could obtain some small clue to the
man's identity! If only he could trace the man back, through his
early years! When had he become "Cain"&mdash;a man against whom all
other men's hands were raised in anger? Could a clue be found in
those words? Again Jimmie Frost turned to the records book.</p>

<p>The year in which "Cain" was first mentioned was 1919. His
activities had extended until 1926. After that year he had
disappeared for three years. He had returned, to immediately attack
Luther Banke. Two facts were now apparent from the records. Two
facts&mdash;and a theory. Methodically Jimmie Frost wrote them on
the paper-block before him. He sat back, staring at the words he
had written.</p>

<p>The Theory: That the five men 'Cain' had victimised had been at
some period engaged in some business or social activity, inimical
to "Cain" or his interests. Jimmie Frost smiled. Was that
supposition too vague or far-fetched? He turned to the other two
paragraphs.</p>

<p>In his years of crime "Cain" had defrauded only these five men.
Four of them were dead; the fifth&mdash;</p>

<p>The shrill tring of the telephone bell&mdash;the instrument on
the wall in the darkest corner of the room&mdash;caught Jimmie
Frost's attention. He went quickly to it. The telephone had not
been in the flat when he had rented it. He had used a call-box on
the street to communicate his new address to the Commissioner. The
next day workmen had arrived at the flat, and installed the
instrument. Its only connection was with an instrument in Sir
Edmund's private office, at Police Headquarters. The instrument lay
in a locked drawer of the Police Chief's big desk. Only Sir Edmund
knew of its existence.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost lifted the receiver from its hook, whispering a
number into the mouthpiece. Along the wire came another number. The
ex-detective listened in silence.</p>

<p>"Watch the newspapers, Jimmie." The Commissioner's voice was
very earnest. "Get this first, then read what the reporters have to
say. Luther Banke was taken ill in Hunter Street an hour ago, with
a stroke. Get it? A stroke!"</p>

<p>Over the line came the small click of a broken connection.
Jimmie Frost started at the instrument in amazement. Luther Banke
had had a paralytic stroke? Would Luther Banke die?</p>

<p>Involuntarily, the ex-detective's eyes went to the writing pad
on the table. He had no need to read again the second fact he had
copied out of the book of "Cain." It stood in letters of fire on
his memory. Luther Banke might die! He would die! Four men had
predeceased him&mdash;the four men against whom "Cain" had sworn
enmity. If Luther Banke should die! Then would not "Cain" be a
murderer, as well as a thief?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">FIFTY hours later! Fifty hours of waiting&mdash;of
intolerable impatience, and Jimmie Frost went from his flat to the
busy streets.</p>

<p>For minutes he stood on the pavement, watching the hurrying
throngs. He felt as if he had come from months in some place of
quiet and silence. He felt bewildered and harassed in this modern
world of noise and haste. In himself there was the urge to retreat
and seek again the solitude of his apartment. A shrug of his
shoulders and he strode down the street. He paused before a shop
window in which stood a large mirror, smiling at the strange figure
that confronted him. He had altered beyond all recognition. The old
Indian&mdash;fakir though he might be, but true and good man in his
work&mdash;had not failed. He was altered&mdash;entirely altered.
His body was new, as was his face. Mark Denvers had disappeared,
and in his place stood another man&mdash;Jimmie Frost,
international crook! The strange frame of padded cane and wire did
not irk now, as it had at first. He had worn it day and night for
over one hundred and thirty hours. Almost it felt comfortable. He
had become used to it&mdash;he knew he would miss it
when&mdash;when he allowed Jimmie Frost to slip, unnoticed, into
the valley of the forgotten; when Sir Edmund informed the
newspapers that some mistake had been made in de-coding American
cables, and that while Jimmie Frost had indeed escaped from Sing
Sing prison, it had been through the gates of death.</p>

<p>He had changed! Again he looked into the mirror, and smiled. Who
would recognise Inspector Mark Denvers under the greying hair, the
sallow lined skin? Who would recognise the smart alert
Detective-Inspector of former days in this bowed, thin, almost
malformed body? A sense of confidence came to him. He turned from
the mirror, squaring his shoulders&mdash;to be brought to a painful
realisation of the immediate present by the cruel, biting grip of
the old Indian's harness beneath his clothes. Where should he go?
Where commence his quest; the quest on which he had staked
everything worth while in his life. Before leaving his flat he had
reported to the Commissioner that he was now free to act&mdash;to
commence his search for the unknown, "Cain." And while his mind
hesitated his feet instinctively bore him towards the centre of the
city; past the ugly, redbrick building which housed the Police
Department.</p>

<p>For a time he loitered within a few feet of the entrance,
enviously watching his former comrades pass in and out of the
building. A quick desire came to him to call them by name&mdash;and
under the long, greying moustache now concealing his lips, he
smiled. Would they recognise in him the Mark Denvers they had once
known? Would they recognise in the strangely aged man before Police
Headquarters' entrance the notorious international crook, Jimmie
Frost?</p>

<p>With a shrug he turned from the building which for so many years
had housed his work and ambitions, and went down to Hunter Street.
Outside Luther Banke's jewellery store, he paused again. The
Montgomery emeralds were not in the window. He wondered who
controlled the establishment while Luther Banke was incapacitated.
Probably Martha Tayne. She looked capable; during his two
interviews with her he had come to realise that she was the real
driving force of the business&mdash;that Luther Banke was even then
a very sick man, incapable of more than outlining a policy. The
store was shut, yet there were lights in the shop&mdash;not the
night lights, but lights that indicated that someone was still at
work within the building.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost sauntered down the lane beside the building, until
he could look up at the windows he knew lighted Martha Tayne's
office. There were lights in the room and presently he saw the
girl's shadow thrown on the opposite wall of the lane. Martha Tayne
was still at work.</p>

<p>He spent some few minutes in a careful examination of the lane;
to discover that no door from the jeweller's shop opened into it.
Then he returned to Hunter Street, and waited. Some undefinable
sense insisted that if he trailed the girl she would lead him to
the clue he sought.</p>

<p>A bare quarter of an hour and the shop-door opened. Martha Tayne
came out, turning on the pavement to speak to the man who had
followed her to the threshold. For a couple of minutes the girl
spoke earnestly, the man nodding understanding. Then Martha walked
quickly down the street while the man re-entered the shop, closing
the heavy outer doors.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost waited until he heard the doors secured for the
night; he saw all the lights but one extinguished; then followed
the girl. Would Martha Tayne go to her flat? The ex-detective
wondered, pacing the street a bare ten yards behind the girl. He
was not troubled that the girl might turn and recognise
him&mdash;he was too greatly altered for that.</p>

<p>Yet he was troubled. Had he been wrong in coming to the city, to
trail Martha Tayne? Suddenly he shook doubt from him. Martha Tayne
was not making her way home! The girl had paused on the busy
pavement. A taxi drew in to the curb beside her. She entered the
vehicle and it moved out into the stream of traffic.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost looked about him. A taxi was passing. He hailed it.
"Up the road!" he commanded. "Towards Central Square. Look out for
taxi No. 11713, and follow it!"</p>

<p>The man nodded, turning sharply. For a couple of hundred yards
he speeded recklessly; then slowed, waving carelessly to his
passenger. Jimmie Frost leaned forward. Over his driver's shoulder
he could see the tail-light of Martha Tayne's car.</p>

<p>Night had fallen. Jimmie Frost switched off the light in the
taxi and leaned back on the cushions with a sigh of relief. His
driver was a good man and would follow the girl to her destination;
then&mdash;What then?</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost wondered. Where was Martha Tayne going? What
business could be keeping her from home at that time of night? He
knew that she had been at the jewellery store from an early hour in
the morning. Why was she not going home? With Luther Banke on a
sick bed, she must be almost tired to death. The cars were now
speeding through quiet suburbs. Soon houses became more sparse, and
stood in wider, deeper grounds. Jimmie Frost leaned forward
scanning the scenery; Martha Tayne was leading him into one of the
outer wealthier suburbs. A quick slackening of the speed of the car
brought the ex-detective alert.</p>

<p>Martha Tayne's car was drawing in to the curb, before the wide
gates of a handsome residence. As the car he occupied crawled
slowly past Jimmie Frost saw that the girl was paying off her
driver. That indicated she intended to spend some time at the
place.</p>

<p>A few yards up the road Jimmie Frost's driver stopped the car.
The ex-detective alighted and, following the girl's example,
dismissed his man. For some moments he stood watching the two cars
speed citywards. When a turn of the road hid them from sight, he
walked back to the gates through which the girl had passed. A few
yards within the grounds, and he saw her standing before the
hall-door. Hardly had he sighted her when the door opened. The girl
spoke a few words to the maid and entered the house.</p>

<p>So, Martha Tayne was expected and welcomed at that house! There
was no moon and the street lamps were some distance away on either
side of the gates. Jimmie Frost realised that he could move about
the grounds with little chance of being observed. Finding a well
screened hiding place, not far from the house, he settled himself
to watch, and at the same time familiarise himself with his
surroundings.</p>

<p>The house was of two storeys; a wide veranda running along the
width. In the centre, before the hall door, the roof-line was
broken by a raised porch. Immediately above the peak of the porch
were wide latticed windows. From the two windows immediately above
the porch-peak glowed a dim light&mdash;the only light showing on
the front of the house.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost gave a satisfied nod. He shifted his regard to the
grounds. The house stood in gardens of considerable extent, even on
the front side. From where he lay hidden he was out of view from
the road; he knew that anyone would have to walk at least thirty
yards from the gates to come within view of the front door. A
pear-shaped drive led from the gates past the front of the house,
skirting a wide expanse of lawns and flower gardens. Behind then a
tall bank of shrubbery hid the house from observation from the
road. So far as the ex-detective could gather the lay-out of the
grounds were to his advantage. It permitted him to move about
freely, under cover of the night-darkness.</p>

<p>Very carefully he re-examined the physical features of the house
and grounds, committing them to memory. No longer did he remember
himself as Mark Denvers, ex-Detective-Inspector of police; he was
Jimmie Frost; a crook marked and hunted in all civilised countries
of the world. Instinctively his hand went to the belt strapped
around his waist. In it was a collection of tools that would have
aroused the envy of the cleverest cracksman. The feel of the
leather, the knowledge of the hard-glistening,
mathematically-perfect instruments, stirred strange, new impulses
within him, Moving carefully, he came from the shelter of the
trees.</p>

<p>Almost as his foot touched the gravel of the path, he stopped.
Someone was in that garden with him.</p>

<p>He dared not retreat. For a brief moment he hesitated, then
cautiously lowered himself until he was lying, prone, on the damp
grass, watching about him, intently. The newcomer was near the belt
of shrubbery shielding the house from the road.</p>

<p>A few minutes intent staring into the darkness, and Jimmie Frost
wondered if he had really seen anything. At most, he had thought
there had been a sudden thickening of the darkness before the
bushes. He was certain he had not been mistaken. Then, who was the
man&mdash;for he was certain the newcomer was a male.</p>

<p>What interest could the man have in this house? Jimmie Frost
grinned. Another question had come to his brain. Who lived in this
house? Turning slightly, he stared at the house&mdash;as if the
old, weathered stones could give him an answer. A shrug, and again
he turned his attention to that intriguing patch of deeper
darkness. It had not moved. Again Jimmie shrugged. He could only
remain where he was while the man remained there, watching. He
wondered if the man had seen him; if so, then that was the reason
for his present immobility. How long would he wait? What would he
do if impatience overcame caution? Suddenly the thickness in the
darkness disappeared.</p>

<p>The ex-detective stared hard through the night seeking some
explanation of the sudden disappearance of the shadow. Had he made
some incautious move, frightening the man; or had the man moved,
preliminary to stalking him? Jimmie Frost came to his feet quickly,
searching the grounds with eager eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly he crouched back against the shrubbery.</p>

<p>From the direction of the gates came sounds of feet crunching on
gravel. The newcomer made no attempt at concealment. The footsteps
were firm, slow, and rather heavy. They came closer, and now were
accompanied by the slight scuffle of a walking-stick dragging on
gravel. Warily, Jimmie Frost drew back into the shelter of the
shrubs. The man came slowly and steadily along the gravel drive,
passing within a few feet of where Jimmie Frost crouched, in
hiding. The' ex-detective drew in his breath sharply. He knew that
form; that walk; that little trick of trail and pick-up with the
walking-stick&mdash;yet for the moment could not fit the
personality with a name.</p>

<p>Fascinated, Jimmie Frost watched, ad the man came to head of the
drive, ascended the three stone steps before the front door, and
pressed the bell-knob. The bell within the house sounded clearly on
the still night air. Jimmie Frost leaned eagerly forward. In the
dim hall light, when the door was opened, he might possibly
identify the man.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dim figure before the front door was illuminated
from within the house. Jimmie Frost sprang forward with a cry of
amazement. The man who was entering the strange house, following
Martha Tayne, was Sir Edmund Morgan, Commissioner of Police.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">JIMMIE FROST stood in the grounds of the
mysterious house, stricken with amazement. He could hardly realise
what he had seen. Sir Edmund Morgan had entered the house,
following Martha Tayne! What did that mean? Had Sir Edmund gone to
the house to meet the girl? That theory would be absurd. Sir Edmund
lived in a distant suburb of the city. If he wished to interview
Martha he would have seen her in the city, at his office or the
jeweller's shop. The ex-detective was becoming convinced that
matters were not "straight" at that house. He felt certain that
soon he would discover some clue leading to "Cain."</p>

<p>For some moments he stood hesitant then turned, searching the
garden with his eyes, so far as the deep gloom permitted. He
glanced towards where he had hidden amid the trees. It would be
useless to go there again. If anyone was watching in the garden
they must have seen him when he advanced to the gravel drive.</p>

<p>Again, and now more boldly, he advanced towards the centre of
the garden, crossing the drive and walking on to the lawns. He
could not see any movements in the shadows. Half-crouching, he went
to the belt of shrubbery where he had thought he had seen the man
and searched thoroughly. He could not discover traces of anyone
being there lately.</p>

<p>He turned and stared up at the house-front, a puzzled frown on
his brow. Something had happened at the house. For seconds he could
not understand, yet he knew the place had altered in some subtle
manner since he had previously looked. Then he exclaimed
softly.</p>

<p>Someone had been at the latticed windows immediately above the
porch. The curtains had been drawn, but not so closely that Jimmie
Frost did not realise that the dimmed light in the room had been
exchanged for stronger illuminant. Who had entered that room? Who
had been at the window during the moments he had been searching the
grounds for a possible watcher? Had the person who had been at the
window seen him prowling the grounds?</p>

<p>Quickly and silently, he crossed the open lawns before the
house, skirting the flower-beds and coming to the gravel-drive. Now
he was on the opposite side of the grounds and hesitated. An urge
came to him to get into the house&mdash;there to try and solve the
many and perplexing problems crowding his brain. His eyes came to
the peak-roofed porch, and held.</p>

<p>If he could gain that! The curtains of the lighted window were
not closely drawn. He might be able to catch a glimpse of the
interior; watch the people gathered there. He might discover who
owned the house, and why Martha Tayne and Sir Edmund Morgan had
chosen to meet there secretly.</p>

<p>A sudden gust of silent laughter shook him. His memory had
slipped back to a previous incarnation&mdash;when he had been Mark
Denvers. Detective-Inspector of police. That officer had traced and
arrested many second-storey men and porch climbers. He had claimed
to have an expert knowledge of those men and their methods. That
knowledge had been only theoretical. Faced with the necessity to
put to practical use his boasted knowledge, he hesitated. There was
a way up the peaked-porch to that window!</p>

<p>Very cautiously, and moving as silently as possible, he went to
the foot of the porch and examined the structure. A quick glance
around the grounds, and he started to climb. Soon he was pulling
himself up the slope to the peak of the roof. Straddling the
roof-ridge he found his eyes were on a level with the window-sill.
The curtains were not completely covering the window. Holding on to
the window-sill, and cautiously shifting his weight on the roof,
Jimmie Frost, after some manoeuvring found a gap through which he
could peer.</p>

<p>A low exclamation, of sheer astonishment, passed his lips.</p>

<p>He was looking into a well-furnished bedroom. A woman in the
garb of a nurse was moving quietly and efficiently about the room,
frequently glancing at a silent, still figure stretched on the bed.
Almost as Jimmie Frost caught sight of her, she turned and came
directly to the window. Jimmie Frost ducked below the level of the
window-sill, nearly over-balancing, and sliding from the roof in
his haste. For a brief moment the woman parted the curtains and
looked out over the darkened gardens. Jimmie Frost had an idea she
was looking for someone. At length she let the curtains fall back
into place and returned to the bedside.</p>

<p>For some minutes the nurse sat by the bed, her hands clasped in
her lap. Suddenly she looked around and rose to her feet, smiling
at someone who, apparently, had just entered the room. A moment,
and another person came into the range of Jimmie Frost's vision.
The newcomer was Martha Tayne. A few feet from the bed the two
women met and for some minutes conversed in low tones, frequently;
glancing at the still figure on the bed. Presently Martha Tayne
passed the nurse and went to the bed. For a moment she bent over
the invalid to straighten with a little frown on her face.</p>

<p>Where was Sir Edmund Morgan? The counterfeit crook glanced at
the luminous dial of his watch. More than twenty minutes had passed
since Sir Edmund had entered the house; over half an hour since
Martha Tayne had come to the place. Where had Sir Edmund and the
girl been during that interval of time? Who, besides them, the sick
person and the nurse, were in that house? Had Sir Edmund and Martha
Tayne come to that house to secretly meet other persons? Suddenly
Jimmie Frost understood the scene he was viewing. He was looking
into Luther Banke's bedroom. The still figure on the bed was the
jeweller, stricken with illness in the streets of the city, two
days previously.</p>

<p>Martha Tayne had come to see him, after her day's work was
finished. But, that explanation did not include Sir Edmund Morgan's
presence in the house. Had he called to inquire after Luther Banke?
If so, then why had he not accompanied Martha Tayne to the sick
chamber?</p>

<p>The ex-detective shifted impatiently on his precarious footing.
Again he peered between the curtains, into the room. Martha Tayne
was still standing by the bed, looking down on the invalid, the
frown still on her face. Suddenly she looked across the room, and
smiled. Jimmie Frost guessed another person had entered the
room.</p>

<p>A full minute of waiting, and the newcomer entered Jimmie
Frost's field of vision. He recognised his old chief, Sir Edmund
Morgan. The police chief spoke briefly to the girl, then went to
the bed and bent over the still figure. After a short interval Sir
Edmund shrugged, straightened, and turned from the bed. The
ex-detective shook himself impatiently. He could not gather the
meaning of the scene he was witnessing; some little clue was
missing. If only he could interpret the scene before him. Why was
Sir Edmund Morgan in that house&mdash;in that room?</p>

<p>When Jimmie Frost looked into the room again Sir Edmund Morgan
had left the bedside and was conversing with Martha Tayne. Once he
glanced back at the bed, and his fingers strayed to his waistcoat
pocket, extracting a handsome silver cigarette case. He took out of
the case a cigarette, twisting it between his fingers, while he
talked. A puzzled frown came on Jimmie Frost's face. He looked from
the man to the girl. Something was wrong in the scene; for a moment
he could not decide where the mistake had been made. Then a flash
of remembrance from the past illuminated his brain! The man in the
room&mdash;the man who moved and looked like Sir Edmund Morgan was
an imposter!</p>

<p>The truth staggered the ex-detective. But he knew he was not
mistaken. In all the years he had known the police chief he had
never known him to smoke a cigarette. He was certain Sir Edmund did
not possess a cigarette case! Then who&mdash;Almost before the
question was framed in his mind, Jimmie Frost knew the answer. The
man in the room with Martha Tayne was "Cain."</p>

<p>He had no doubts; there could be no doubts! Now, as he eagerly
watched the man he saw that other little personalities were
missing; there were little strangenesses that betrayed the truth.
"Cain" had followed Martha Tayne to Luther Banke's house; at that
moment he was in the house with her.</p>

<p>"Cain" had stolen a fortune from Luther Banke&mdash;as he had
stolen fortunes from four other men. Those other men had died!
Luther Banke was on a sick bed; stricken almost to the point of
death! He must get into that house and prove his
theory&mdash;explore the house and discover who else was concerned
in the plot. For a moment he hesitated; then a wave of confidence
came to him. He was Jimmie Frost&mdash;a crook without the law. He
could dare&mdash;and would!</p>

<p>Lowering himself from the peak of the roof, he found the
guttering with his feet. It was easy to swarm down the porch-side
to the ground. For a moment he hesitated, then started to circle
the house, thinking to find some unguarded door or window through
which he might enter.</p>

<p>As he turned the corner of the house he sensed a presence near
him. Instinctively he threw up his arms, but he was too late.
Something overwhelmingly heavy descended on his head, points of
brilliant fire danced before his eyes. He felt himself
falling&mdash;falling&mdash;</p>

<p>JIMMIE FROST, once Detective-Inspector of Police Mark Denvers,
opened his eyes painfully, and looked about him. A puzzled frown
came on his face. He was in a cold-looking, bare room, lying on a
hard, narrow bed. How had he come there? He remembered being in the
garden before Luther Banke's house, and seeing the tall, dark form
menacing him as he turned the corner of the house. He remembered
the stunning blow that had dropped him to the ground, unconscious.
He remembered the garden and the house, and the incidents of the
evening surrounding them, but he could not remember this room. He
wondered how he had there.</p>

<p>It was a bare, bleak place, with only the hard, plank bed on
which he lay, a shelf above his head and a stool. He rolled over on
his hard bed uneasily&mdash;and the door of the room came within
his vision. It was a strange looking door, heavy and substantial,
and on it was a small barred window, now closed by a shutter. For
minutes he lay puzzling the strange door. Why was that little
window on it? A short hard laugh came from his parched throat. With
an effort he rolled over and sat up. He wanted a drink, but the
pitcher of water was on the shelf, high above his head. Painfully,
and with the room and its contents dancing before his eyes, he
gained his feet, clinging to the wall. With legs that seemed
insecurely attached to his body he moved until he was directly
beneath the pitcher, then stretched upwards. He dragged the jug
from the shelf, spilling most of the contents over himself. He got
the pitcher to his lips and gulped eagerly the tepid liquid, then
placed the vessel on the ground and flung himself on the bed.</p>

<p>Slowly realisation came to him. A searching look about the room
and he recognised it for a police-station cell. Where?</p>

<p>A heavy step sounded in the corridor without the door. A key
fumbled in the lock; the door swung open and a uniformed man
entered.</p>

<p>"So, you're awake, at last!" The warder spoke gruffly, though
not unkindly. "Quite a bend this time, eh?"</p>

<p>"How did I come here?" Jimmie Frost asked, a sense of impending
disaster coming over him.</p>

<p>"Brought in. Drunk and disorderly." The warder grinned. "You're
a newie, aren't you? Ain't seen you before here."</p>

<p>"Drunk and disorderly!" Jimmie Frost restrained a grip. And, he
could not remember anything after climbing down from the
porch-roof!</p>

<p>"Sure! And a real drunk, too! Slept all round the clock, you
have! There ain't a man down the row who ain't envying you."</p>

<p>"I wasn't drunk; I was ill!" The ex-detective spoke without
thought. "Of course! Not drunk!" The man's grin broadened. "You all
say that! You stank of the booze; you do now."</p>

<p>As the warder spoke, Jimmie became aware of the truth of the
statement. He had noticed the smell before the warder had come to
the cell, but had not associated it with himself. Now he recognised
that every movement he made sent out clouds of aroma of stale,
cheap spirits. He smiled secretly.</p>

<p>"Cain" was clever! The crook had seen him peering in at the
bedroom window. While he had been climbing down from the porch roof
"Cain" had descended the back stairs and met him at the
house-corner, then sandbagged him. The disposal of his insensible
body had been easy. "Cain" had drenched him with cheap whisky,
carried him to the road, and left him at the mercy of the next
patrolling constable.</p>

<p>"Cain" had impersonated Sir Edmund Morgan and gained entrance to
Luther Banke's house. For what reason? Was Luther Banke dead? For
the present he would have to allow those questions to remain
unanswered. He had allowed himself to be tricked into a false
position. "Cain" had placed him in the hands of the law. He was a
"drunk and disorderly" and would be lucky if he escaped
imprisonment. What a mess he had made of things! In his first
encounter with the master-crook he had allowed himself to be
tricked and out-witted; more, he was in danger of losing his
liberty! With something like a sigh of disgust at his own
incapacity, he relaxed on his hard couch.</p>

<p>"Here! Come on!" The warder strode into the cell, catching
Jimmie Frost by his collar and lugging him to his feet. "Get a
move-on! Want to keep the&mdash;magistrate waiting for you all
day?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">A STRANGE numbness appeared to have settled on
Jimmie Frost's brain. Under the urge of the warder's hand he came
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Still got a belly full?" The man grinned. "Well, if what I hear
is right, it's you for a rest-cure." He shoved his prisoner before
him into the corridor. Jimmie. Frost did not answer. He was finding
some difficulty in walking with some semblance of sobriety. More
than once in the length of the short corridor he had to touch the
wall to keep his balance. Jimmie Frost knew he must act warily. He
was about to appear before a magistrate on a "drunk and disorderly"
charge. If he could impress the magistrate&mdash;induce him to
believe in a sincere repentance for a first relapse from a sober,
upright life&mdash;he might receive a "caution" and a fine.</p>

<p>Against that theory was the warder's words. The man appeared
certain Jimmie Frost would be remanded or be sentenced to a term of
imprisonment. What charges could the police lay against him? He had
been framed by the super-crook, "Cain." He had sandbagged him and
left him in the gutter, first saturating him with cheap spirits.
Jimmie Frost raised a hand to his aching head. It throbbed
insistently, painfully. Had "Cain" administered to him more than a
sandbag and a bottle of cheap whisky? That was possible.</p>

<p>The facts as they rested did not make sense. Even if he had
spied on "Cain," to place him, a drunk and disorderly, in the hands
of the police, would be a paltry revenge. Jimmie Frost was certain
some deeper meaning lay behind the super-crook's actions. One thing
puzzled him. Had "Cain" known that ex-Detective-Inspector Mark
Denvers was on his tracks? If that supposition was correct then
"Cain" must have a very efficient intelligence service, for, with
the exception of two persons, the whole of the State believed that
Mark Denvers had resigned from the Police Department.</p>

<p>Yet "Cain" had acted as if he shared the closely guarded secret
with the Commissioner and Inspector Denvers. He had chosen to pose
as Sir Edmund Morgan, even in Luther Banke's house. Jimmie Frost
had witnessed the impersonation, and had wondered at its
perfection. There had been only one slip&mdash;the cigarette. In
view of later happenings, Jimmie Frost now wondered if the action
had been a mistake, or the key of a subtle plot.</p>

<p>The warder spoke sharply, reproving Jimmie Frost for loitering.
The counterfeit crook squared his shoulders and quickened his pace.
At the gates of the corridor the warder handed him over to a
waiting constable.</p>

<p>He was taken into a room and told to sit on a wooden bench until
he was called into court. A mirror hung on the wall of the room.
Disregarding a command to remain seated, he rose to his feet and
went to it. He smiled in quiet amusement as he studied the face
that stared back at him from the glass. Foully dirty, unkempt,
unshaven, his clothes reeking with the filth of the gutter, surely
he looked the part he was cast to play. He smiled grimly as he
returned to the bench.</p>

<p>Penniless and foul, he would have to take his medicine. One by
one, the men in the room were called to take their place in the
dock. Many of them returned to that room again, under remand or to
wait for the jail-van. A few, the lucky ones who paid fine, or were
acquitted, did not appear again.</p>

<p>The voice of the court orderly, calling "James Frost," broke on
his reverie. He slouched through the door, into the dock. A
constable mounted to the witness box, standing to attention while
the clerk administered the oath.</p>

<p>The scene was familiar to Jimmie Frost. Many times in his
official life he had taken part in similar scenes, though not from
the dock. The procedure was routine, and utterly drab. Yet he
sensed on this occasion, there was a tenseness about officials and
spectators. Quite an unusual number of police were in
court&mdash;and every eye was turned towards him, expectant and
curious. Under what name had he been charged? Then he remembered.
The orderly had called "James Frost."</p>

<p>Had that name any significance in that court? Under his mask of
sodden indifference he strained every sense to try and anticipate
what was to happen. Had he talked while under the influence of the
large quantities of cheap spirits administered by "Cain"? Had he
allowed any clue to the record of his assumed identity to escape
him?</p>

<p>James Frost! How had these police court officials know that
name? Had he spoken it when brought to the police station and
charged? And, if he had, how had they connected it with the man who
was supposed to have escaped from the old, grey prison, many
thousands of miles away across the seas? A question was asked him,
he believed by the magistrate. He did not catch its purpose, but
mumbled a reply. It was for them, not him, to speak and act.</p>

<p>Then the constable in the witness box commenced to give
evidence. Jimmie Frost, under his assumed air of sullen
indifference, listened intently. It was imperative he should fully
understand all the man had to say. The first sentences of the
constable's evidence were the usual routine of a "drunk and
disorderly." The prisoner had been very drunk. He had also been
abusive, and had resisted arrest, damaging the constable's uniform.
A coat was tendered in evidence, torn and dirty. The prisoner had
refused to give name or address.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;from where had they obtained the "James Frost?"</p>

<p>The constable was continuing his evidence. He held up a large
square of cardboard. Even at the distance he was from the witness
box, Jimmie Frost could read his assumed name&mdash;and more. He
leaned forward, staring amazedly at the placard the constable was
displaying with almost pride. Who had drawn that sign? Only one man
in the state besides himself had that information. No, "Cain" knew
it! "Cain" knew&mdash;and had written those words!</p>

<p>JAMES FROST Who lately escaped from Sing Sing Prison, New York
State, U.S.A., where he was awaiting the date of his execution FOR
MURDER.</p>

<p>The constable talked on. The placard had been secured to the
prisoner's neck by a loop of string, when he was found. He had been
questioned, and had given no explanation. With some dramatic sense
the constable had propped the cardboard before him, on the ledge of
the witness box, while he continued his evidence. Jimmie Frost
stared at the large, bold lettering on the dirty cardboard with
almost disbelief in his eyes. "Cain" had denounced him as an
escaped convict&mdash;and a murderer!</p>

<p>The constable continued his evidence. He held a flimsy piece of
paper in his hand. Jimmie Frost smiled grimly when he saw the
cable. It was the one sent by the New York authorities to the
Police Commissioner, at his request. Again he smiled when the
constable, with some little pomposity, read it aloud. It falsely
announced the escape of one James Frost, from Sing Sing prison.</p>

<p>Dully, Jimmie Frost heard the magistrate speak. He was to be
remanded. The New York police authorities were to be communicated
with.</p>

<p>For eight days! Silently he obeyed the order of the dock keeper
to return to the waiting room. From there a constable escorted him
back to the police cells. For eight days! What then? Would, at the
end of that period, James Frost be declared dead, not escaped? If
so, then what would become of the identity he had laboriously built
up?</p>

<p>Again in the cell, he seated himself on the bunk. He knew he
would not be kept there long. The business of the court had
terminated for the day; his had been the last case on the list.
Shortly, he would be ordered to the line-up, then to enter the
jail-van for the journey to the remand prison. Minutes passed,
lengthening into hours, and the expected summons did not come. At
length Jimmie Frost stretched himself on the bunk, not troubling to
undress.</p>

<p>He wondered what had caused the delay? Had someone intervened on
his behalf? That could not be. Only the Commissioner could act in
that manner, and he would not do so unless appealed to.</p>

<p>Night came, and still no one came for him. Jimmie Frost became
hungry. He had not had food since the previous day. He became
angry. It was absurd to neglect him, even if they did not intend to
send him to the remand prison.</p>

<p>For a time he prowled about his cell, at times trying to squeeze
a few more drops of moisture from the empty jug. Still no one came,
and he again threw himself on the bunk, dozing fitfully.</p>

<p>When he awoke there was no light in his cell. He groped a way to
the door and fingered the wicket through the bars. To his surprise
he found he could open it. A faint light illuminated the cell. He
listened at the door but could hear no sounds in the building.</p>

<p>What could have happened? It was a violation of regulations to
leave prisoners, even those on remand, for any length of time
without inspection. Why had his cell light been extinguished? Why
had not the warder visited him, to inform him where he was to spend
the remand? He groped his way back to the bunk and threw himself on
the blankets.</p>

<p>Something hard pressed against his ribs.</p>

<p>He searched, and found a packet. By the faint light that came
through the wicket he opened it. Within were his keys and
money&mdash;everything that had been in his possession when he had
been struck down in the gardens of Luther Banke's house.</p>

<p>For some moments he sat, turning the articles on his hand. Why
had these things been returned to him? He frowned. Surely he had
not had all that money on him when he left the city to trail Martha
Tayne? If his memory was not playing him false, he then possessed
only a couple of pound notes and a small handful of sliver. Yet now
he held a thick packet of bank notes.</p>

<p>He slipped the rubber band from around the packet of notes and
ran his finger along one edge. To his amazement he found, when he
took the notes to the light, that while a few, top and bottom, were
one pound denominations, the interior notes of the packet were of
£10 values.</p>

<p>Who had brought that money to him? He remembered that the
previous day he had intended informing Sir Edmund Morgan that he
was short of money, but had not done so. Had the Commissioner
guessed he required money, and sent this to him. No, he would not
do that, for he would have had to confide in some messenger, and he
had been insistent that the secret of Jimmie Frost's identity be
between themselves, alone. When he required money Sir Edmund Morgan
paid it into a special account, personally.</p>

<p>Mystery was crowding on mystery! What would happen next? The
gift of money was strange&mdash;the darkness and silence of the
police court cells still more so. Was he going mad? Had "Cain"
administered some drug, dulling his senses? He knew he was in one
of the busiest police stations of the metropolis. He should hear
continued movement, be under constant observation&mdash;and not a
sound disturbed the silence of the building. Perplexed, he paced
the cell, wondering what would happen next. He hesitated, stopped
abruptly in his stride, listening intently.</p>

<p>Someone was in the corridor, approaching his cell and moving
stealthily. Jimmie Frost braced himself to take advantage of any
opportunity the future offered. The footsteps drew near, coming,
very slowly and stealthily. They ceased at the door of his cell. A
long silence, and Jimmie Frost sensed that the person in the
corridor was listening. He hardly dared to breathe. Crouching close
to the door, he waited for some sign or signal, his nerves
quivering with excitement.</p>

<p>Presently he stretched out his hand and laid it on the face of
the door. Ages seemed to pass before he heard a key slither
cautiously into the lock. The door moved slowly, opening outwards.
Jimmie Frost flattened himself against the wall. Again he advanced
a hand to touch cloth, moving. It passed him, going into the cell.
He waited a moment, then slipped silently from the cell into the
corridor; running down to the iron gates. Suddenly he stopped,
turning and staring back at the cell he had just left. Through the
darkness came peal after peal of ringing laughter.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">ONLY for a brief moment did Jimmie Frost hesitate.
He pulled open the iron gates barring the end of the corridor and
slipped out into a passage. Now he must walk warily, calling to his
aid his accumulative knowledge of police station work. He knew this
station well; the passage he was now in would lead him to the
street. Yet about him were many offices, some of them occupied all
night.</p>

<p>He stole warily down the passage and came to a corner. Peering
round the corner he could see the main entrance; but a constable
stood on the top step, his back to the passage. On the right hand
side of the passage was the charge room, and from the room came the
sounds of many voices. He wondered at the absence of any excitement
in the building. Surely the responsible officers knew the cell
quarters were in darkness, the warder absent from his post.</p>

<p>"All right, now." A voice in the charge-room spoke. "Just a fuse
blown out. Where's Atkins? Haven't seen him for nearly an
hour."</p>

<p>"Don't know." A voice answered. "Pull over that switch and give
our little dicky birds some light; or they'll start singing."</p>

<p>"They're quiet enough now."</p>

<p>"Except that fellow who was laughing. Josh! He made it ring
through the building!" The second man snickered. "Rang like a song
through the building."</p>

<p>"Wasn't Atkins; was it?"</p>

<p>"Old grumpy! Laugh like that! Not on your life. Wonder where he
is?"</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost crept a few steps backwards, crouching into a dark
corner, for heavy steps were approaching the charge-room door. A
head came into view, round a doorpost. "Saunders! Seen Atkins
anywhere?"</p>

<p>"Saw him an hour ago, Sergeant. Said he was going to the
chemist. Haven't seen him return."</p>

<p>"Must have come back. The head was withdrawn." From inside the
charge-room the same voice continued: "Harry, find Atkins. Tell him
I want him."</p>

<p>"Hullo, son." The constable at the door spoke to a boy. "What's
the matter? Got a letter for the sergeant, eh? All right, I'll take
it. S'long!"</p>

<p>Jimmie tensed. Here was his opportunity. He waited until the
constable entered the charge-room, then glided to the door.</p>

<p>On the pavement, a few feet from the station-house entrance,
curiosity overcame him. Who had laughed in the cell corridor? Who
had unlocked the door of his cell? Where was the warder, Atkins?
Had that note, brought to the constable by the boy, anything to do
with his escape? He glanced about him eagerly. Two double windows,
heavily barred, opened on the street from the charge-room. One of
the windows was open a couple of inches at the bottom. A few
careful movements, and he was half-crouching under the window,
listening.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and you'd better take over Atkins's job." The sergeant
was speaking. "Hell! What did the silly fool want to go and get
coshed for?"</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost nodded; he was beginning to understand. Atkins, the
warder, had been got out of his way. Who had done that? The name,
"Cain" trembled on his lips. But "Cain" had delivered him to the
police, labelling him "international crook and murderer!" Why,
then, had he come to his aid, clearing the way for his escape from
the station cell?</p>

<p>"Ey, mister!" A furtive-eyed, stunted youth stood at his elbow.
"Your name Jimmie Frost?" Jimmie nodded, cautiously watching around
him. The youth held out a dirty envelope. "Bloke tol' me ter give
you this, mate. Sed you'd understan'."</p>

<p>With a wild half-yell, reminiscent of some partly-forgotten
Wild-West show, the youth spun round on his heels and darted up the
street, leaving Jimmie Frost staring at the envelope in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Say, Sergeant." A voice in the charge-room came sharply. "That
fellow, Frost, has got away. Cell's empty and unlocked."</p>

<p>"What the&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost did not wait to hear more. The hunt was up. He had
to get away from that neighbourhood as quickly as possible. A
tram-route passed the end of the road, a bare fifty yards away. A
car was stopping. He caught it just as it moved on, after a sharp
sprint. It would carry him to within a few hundred yards of his
flat.</p>

<p>It was only when he stood within the entrance hall of the
building that he remembered the envelope the youth had thrust into
his hand. He tore it open. The contents were a single sheet of
notepaper, containing one line of writing. In the dim light of the
hall he read the words; "With compliments.&mdash;'Cain'."</p>

<p>In sudden anger he crushed the paper into a ball and pitched it
into the street, to immediately follow and retrieve it. The paper
contained the only writing that could be directly attributed to the
arch crook "Cain"&mdash;if, indeed, he had written it. A tired,
dissatisfied feeling came over the ex-detective. He climbed the
stairs to his flat, slowly. He had played the first round of his
match against "Cain"&mdash;and the master-crook had defeated him
with contemptuous ease.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the affair he had held all the cards. He
had been certain that "Cain" had not suspected he would leave his
flat that night; he had not even informed Sir Edmund of his
intentions. During the day he had been restless, excited at the
prospect of regaining his freedom, after the long wait for his
disguise to settle&mdash;and had decided to commence investigations
immediately.</p>

<p>On entering his rooms, he made a careful search of the premises,
to make certain no one had entered during his absence. In the
service-hatch he found the morning's milk, now sour; and beside it
a loaf of bread. His bed was still disordered and the rooms
undusted. The woman who cleaned the flat could not enter unless he
was at home.</p>

<p>He threw himself into a chair, brooding moodily. A damned fine
crook, he! And as Mark Denvers he had despised crooks, counting
them tube of a lower intelligence to himself! Now he realised how
very dependant the cleverest officer is on departmental assistance
for his success; how greatly the daily conferences with his brother
officers and superiors enhanced his individual ability. Crooks did
not possess departmental offices fitted with clerks and expensive
recording devices. They had no efficient organisations to aid them.
The few really successful criminals worked "lone-handed," for not
only had they to out-wit the police, but they had to meet treachery
from the crooks surrounding them. He would have to re-start, right
from the beginning; forget all the theories and platitudes of
crooks and their works he and his fellows had constructed in past
days. He must learn to lean solely on his personal resources, to be
entirely self-reliant; able to take full advantage of every
opportunity as it presented itself; act, apparently on impulse, but
really on a well trained instant initiative.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours had passed since he had left his rooms in
search of "Cain." What had he accomplished in that time? He had
discovered that Martha Tayne visited at Luther Banke's house. He
had seen "Cain" in two characters&mdash;Had he? Why was he so
certain that "Cain" had impersonated Sir Edmund Morgan? Only on the
strength of a cigarette and a cigarette case; when he knew the
Police Commissioner to be exclusively a cigar smoker.</p>

<p>Yet, somehow he held that clue proof against doubt. Men did not
change life-habits in a few hours, and he knew there were few
habitual cigar smokers who would consider the insidious cigarette
for one moment. He was certain the man he had seen standing by
Luther Banke's bedside was "Cain." Yet he was certain the man who
had sandbagged him, and delivered him to the police like a bale of
goods, was "Cain." Could both suppositions be correct?</p>

<p>It was obvious that the man who had watched him climb to the
porch-roof was a confederate of the master-crook. He had never
plainly seen the man, only glimpsed him as a deeper shadow against
the gloom of the shrubbery. On the other hand, he had had a plain
view of "Cain" when he impersonated the Police Chief. How could he
reconcile the two facts?</p>

<p>In spite of careful reasoning Jimmie Frost felt that he was only
building a house of cards. Past history&mdash;the mass of facts
accumulated at Police Headquarters&mdash;pointed to "Cain" being a
"lone wolf." At no time had any evidence been obtained to show that
he worked with a confederate.</p>

<p>That had been Mark Denvers handicap through the years. There had
only been the elusive trail left by "Cain" himself. That trail had
neither met nor crossed any other. There had been no confederate to
track, watch or bribe.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost paced the floor of his sitting room irritably. If
only he could obtain some clue to "Cain's" real identity, or
history; one single fact of which to start the weave that,
eventually, would bring "Cain" to his long-deferred
retribution.</p>

<p>Full of his problem, impatient with himself because he could not
pierce to the heart of his mystery, Jimmie Frost wandered into his
kitchen and looked out of the window. Martha Tayne was at home; her
kitchen light was burning. Once he caught a glimpse of her shadow
as she moved about the little room. An impulse to get in touch with
the girl seized Jimmie Frost. He wanted to study her, to know her
habits, probe her thoughts. He wanted to watch her in the future
with full understanding.</p>

<p>He knew that "Cain" was attracted to her. Was she attracted to
him? He was convinced that Martha Tayne was honest&mdash;he would
have sworn to that. If she were crook, what opportunities had lain
to her hands during the years! Day after day she had handled jewels
worth thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>True, like every employee in the trade, she was checked and
watched&mdash;but no brain has yet devised a system that another
brain could not evade or destroy! The ex-detective went to the flat
door. He would go down to Martha Tayne. In the little hall he
hesitated; what excuse could he make for the call?</p>

<p>He was Jimmie Frost, master-crook, not Mark Denvers, resting on
his authority to question in the name of the law. With a shrug of
resignation he turned to re-enter his sitting room. Then his eyes
chanced on the service-hatch. In it stood the jug of soured milk. A
little smile came on his lips. He could go down to the girl and
borrow half a cup of milk. People living in blocks of flats did
that sort of thing&mdash;and became acquainted, sometimes
intimately. But the evening was young; the shops in the
neighbourhood were still open. He could buy milk, among other,
things at half a dozen places within 50 yards of the main hall
door. Yet he seized a jug from the dresser and made for the
door.</p>

<p>Almost as he reached it came the unmusical swirl of the bell. He
turned back into the sitting room, placed the jug on the table,
then answered the call of the bell. A man stood on the landing,
half-turned from the door. As Jimmie Frost opened the door the man
stepped forward, holding out his hand, a little smile on his
lips.</p>

<p>"Mr. James Frost?" He spoke in a pleasant cultivated voice. "You
don't know me, but&mdash;I know you! I had a cable from&mdash;you
know, today. They stated you had come to this city. Sheer luck gave
me your address. Let me introduce myself, Joyce Poynter."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">FOR moments Jimmie Frost hesitated, then stepped
back and motioned to his visitor to enter. He was perplexed. Who
was this man? He had stated that he was in touch with Americans who
were interested in him&mdash;Jimmie Frost; that he had received
advices from the States to get in touch with him. For what reason?
Did this man really believe that he was the murderer who had been
incarcerated in the death cell at Sing Sing prison? That might be
so, but in that case he had not heard the truth from his American
correspondents&mdash;if he had heard from them at all. The real
James Frost had not escaped from prison&mdash;he had died in the
room behind the green door.</p>

<p>Sir Edmund Morgan's cable to the New York police might have been
in time to permit the prison authorities to suppress the news in
the newspapers, but there was no power on earth that could stifle
the grapevine telegraph which served the underworld. Jimmie Frost
was certain that every crook in the United States of America knew
that the real Jimmie Frost was dead.</p>

<p>Why should they cable this man an untruth? The proposition was
impossible, Either this man, who named himself Joyce Poynter had
been deceived, or he was lying. There was a third supposition, that
the man before him was&mdash;"Cain."</p>

<p>Then "Cain" had had him under observation from the time he had
discovered him in the grounds of Luther Banke's house. He had
helped him to escape from the police cell, and had then followed
him to his home. Jimmie Frost cursed under his breath. What a fool
he had been! From the moment he had escaped from the police
station, his only thought had been to get back to his flat. He had
not given a thought to the possibility that he might be followed.
"Cain" or&mdash;</p>

<p>What part had the police in these events? He was certain that
from the moment of his arrest he had not uttered a word that would
incriminate himself&mdash;they had only the lying cable from the
New York police in support of the statements on the large placard
"Cain" had attached to him while he was unconscious. Had the
police, in search of evidence to support the statements on the
placard, faked his escape&mdash;thinking to follow him to his
hide-out? "Cain" or the police! Both were dangers to him. He had
been traced to his home by one or the other. In the future he would
be watched, his privacy examined, his freedom of movement greatly
hampered. In silence he motioned his visitor to precede him into
the sitting room of the flat. There he waited for the man to speak.
He wondered, was he viewing another incarnation of "Cain?"</p>

<p>"So glad to have found you so quickly." The man spoke with a
slight American accent. "Had I been informed of the boat you
travelled on, I would have been at the wharf to welcome you. Now,
may I congratulate you. To have successfully got away from Sing
Sing is a most notable feat."</p>

<p>"Have you been there?" asked Jimmie Frost quietly. Joyce Poynter
smiled, pausing a moment before answering. "I have never escaped
from there." The answer was a neat parry. "Very few have."</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost nodded. He knew the history of the famous American
prison; the splendid record of those controlling it. Very few men
had contrived to escape from within those grey walls; very few of
those who had scaled the walls had retained their liberty for more
than a week.</p>

<p>"Glad you've called." Jimmie Frost seated himself, facing his
guest. "As you say, it's lonely over here, not knowing the
country&mdash;or anyone." He paused, noticeably, before the final
two words. Joyce Poynter nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"How are you off for funds?" He motioned towards his breast
pocket.</p>

<p>"Thanks. Got a stake." The ex-detective smiled. Was this man
prepared to finance him? If so, he wanted something from him. What
could that be?</p>

<p>"I can let you have a grand." Joyce Poynter stretched his long
legs before him. "Of course, that's chicken feed to you. Once you
get going you'll soon gather in all you want."</p>

<p>"Think so?" Jimmie Frost smiled. "I've heard
the&mdash;the&mdash;what do you call them over here--Oh, yes,
'Johns,' are rather clever."</p>

<p>Joyce Poynter smiled. "So, so!" he answered. "Have you anything
in mind?"</p>

<p>The ex-detective shook his head. If he had been a real crook,
with a brain full of plans for the looting of the city, he would
not confide in this very plausible stranger.</p>

<p>For a while he studied his visitor, in silence, a theory
gradually forming in his mind. The man was tall, nearly six feet in
height; slim, with the long, supple leanness of the trained
athlete. His complexion was dark, and his eyes an indeterminate
deep brown colour. A small, well-cared-for moustache decorated his
upper lip; his jowls tended to blue blackness&mdash;the blueness of
the strongly-haired male.</p>

<p>Somehow that colouring of the jaw line disturbed the
ex-detective. That little moustache! Just a few close cropped hairs
on either side of the nostrils! That moustache was not in keeping
with the deep blueness of chin and cheeks. Then&mdash;why, that
moustache might be false! Was this man wearing a disguise? Had the
darkness of his complexion been obtained through dye?</p>

<p>The vague theory that had come to him since he had seen the man
standing on the landing without the flat, was crystallising to a
conviction. The man was a decoy&mdash;or was he "Cain," in another
of his impersonations? That was possible.</p>

<p>More, Jimmie Frost was now willing to bet that he had guessed
right. "Cain" was here, in his flat with him! A glow of triumph
came in the ex-detective's eyes. He had made mistakes&mdash;but
even his mistakes had made for his success! "Cain" had come to
despise him&mdash;to believe him to be an awkward bungler. He had
counted him fool, instead of acknowledging the mistakes to be due
to the actor playing an unaccustomed part. And, those mistakes,
through the induction of a false sense of superiority, had
delivered "Cain" into his hands!</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost silently swore he would make no mistake now. He had
penetrated "Cain's" disguise, but he must keep that knowledge to
himself. He must play the crook's game&mdash;continue to be the
Yankee criminal whose identity he had assumed until he could catch
"Cain" off his guard!</p>

<p>"Anything doing?" he asked shortly, veiling his eyes so that
Joyce Poynter should not see any trace of triumph there.</p>

<p>"There's a lay-out of sparklers&mdash;" Joyce Poynter drawled
slowly; his gaze fixed on his companion's face.</p>

<p>"So!" The ex-detective waited a moment; then, as his companion
did not continue, he asked: "What's your lay?"</p>

<p>Joyce Poynter shrugged. "I live by my wits," he replied
briefly.</p>

<p>"Any good?" Jimmie Frost sat forward suddenly. Now he felt he
could look the man full in the face without betraying himself. "If
there's a cache, why ask me in?"</p>

<p>"I can't shoot it. You can."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Friends." Joyce Poynter lay back in his chair, smiling quietly.
"Think we don't know of you over here, Jimmie Frost? You've got a
reputation with a coffin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" The ex-detective smiled epigrammatically, when the other
paused.</p>

<p>Joyce Poynter did not answer. For a moment his eyes searched the
counterfeit crook's face then, with deliberation, he took from his
waistcoat pocket a cigarette-case, opened it and held it out
invitingly. Jimmie Frost succeeded in repressing a start of
amazement with difficulty. He had seen that cigarette case before.
It was the one "Cain" had handled in Luther Banke's bedroom, when
disguised as the Commissioner of Police.</p>

<p>Carefully repressing any eagerness, he leaned forward and took
it from the man's hand. For a moment the crook made a motion, as if
to retain it, then loosened his clasp.</p>

<p>"Nice case," Jimmie Frost examined the case with interest. "Now,
where have I seen it before?"</p>

<p>In the slight flickering of eyelids Jimmie Frost saw that he had
almost penetrated his opponent's guard. The crook's eyes suddenly
steadied, searchingly, banefully.</p>

<p>"You've seen that cigarette-case before?"</p>

<p>"Sure. And not so long ago." The ex-detective spoke daringly.
"Now&mdash;Where?" He leaned back in his chair, half-closing his
eyes, wrinkling his brows as though deep in thought.</p>

<p>"A whizz!" He laughed gently as he spoke. Under his make-up the
man flushed darkly. Jimmie Frost watched him with interest. He had
called the man a pickpocket and the epithet had hurt. "A whizz!" He
repeated the word with emphasis. "And you want to work with me!
Hold-out!"</p>

<p>He lifted his hand as the man made to speak. "I know that case.
You dipped it from&mdash;you know!" He was watching the man with
keen, eager eyes. What would he do? How would he resent the flow of
abuse. If his surmises were correct, he had called "Cain," the
master-criminal of the city, a pickpocket! Could he insult him
further without precipitating a crisis? "And, you ask
me&mdash;me&mdash;to work with you! You bum! What are you? A bum, a
shelf! No, you're not even that! A top-off's more your mark. Going
to fox me and drop the shuck, eh? Oh, get out of here! You give me
the willies."</p>

<p>As he spoke Jimmie Frost jumped to his feet, watching his
opponent narrowly. He had spoken to force the man to some
retaliation. How would he act?</p>

<p>"Putting the acid on?" Joyce Poynter lounged back in his seat
negligently. Except for the heightened colour in his cheeks, the
steely glitter in his eyes, he showed no signs of resentment.</p>

<p>"Get up!" Jimmie Frost's hand suddenly came in sight, holding a
revolver. "Going to frame me, eh? Well, you've got just one more
guess."</p>

<p>Joyce Poynter did not move, except to raise his hands to the
arms of the chair on which he sat. He had regained his composure,
badly shaken by the ex-detective's aggressive words. A quiet little
smile flecked the corners of his firm mouth.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, Jimmie! I wouldn't. You couldn't, here. How are you
going to explain a real, dead corpse in your flat? You can't get
away with that sort of thing, in this country. Take me for a ride,
eh? No, no! All the people here know of that they read in the
imported dime magazines." The man's nerve staggered the
ex-detective. For the moment he was undecided how to act. He had no
intention of letting the man leave the room, until he left under
police escort. He knew that he had put up a bluff&mdash;and that
the crook had called It. He was facing "Cain"&mdash;of that he had
little doubt. And he had him under his gun.</p>

<p>So far, so good; but what should be his next move? Could he
drive him through the street to the police-station, and have him
detained for inquiries? Explanations would have to be made to the
senior officer on duty&mdash;there would be questions and doubts.
He could not swear that this man was "Cain"; only declare that he
had reasons to believe so. They would want proofs, even of his
beliefs and theories&mdash;and what had he to offer? Then, what of
himself?</p>

<p>He was Jimmie Frost, a crook and a condemned murderer. He could
not claim to be Detective-Inspector Mark Denvers until his prisoner
was proved to be "Cain" without doubt. Until that proof was
obtained, either by himself or the police, he must remain in his
disguise. Any other course would nullify all he had so far
accomplished.</p>

<p>There was a way out for him. If he could get in touch with Sir
Edmund Morgan. The Police Commissioner could solve many of his
difficulties. But how could he contact him? His eyes went to the
telephone in the dark corner. That instrument connected with the
Commissioner's office. Then he remembered, smiling bitterly. Only
Sir Edmund could make the connection. He looked back at his
prisoner, from that fraction of a second glance at the telephone.
"Cain" was on his feet, and in his hand he held a small automatic.
He was smiling slightly.</p>

<p>With a shrug, Jimmie Frost recognised that the initiative had
passed from him, when his eyes had wavered from his prisoner's
face.</p>

<p>"That's your talk, Jimmie Frost?" The man spoke in a low, tense
voice. "I'm a bum, a shelf, a stool-pigeon, eh? Why should I want
to frame you&mdash;you who but a few hours ago escaped from a
police station cell-after framing yourself into the hands of the
police? Now listen, you-"</p>

<p>The rasp of the door bell cut across the man's words. He
started, and half-turned. In a bound, Jimmie Frost was on him,
snatching at the hand holding the automatic almost before his own
gun struck the floor. Again the door bell rang&mdash;raspingly,
irritatingly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER the first moments of surprise, Jimmie Frost
realised that in a physical encounter with the master-crook he was
certain to be beaten, Joyce Poynter had muscles of steel and easily
broke away from the ex-detective's grip. In the short struggle
Jimmie Frost's attention had been centred on the crook's hand
holding the automatic.</p>

<p>As the master-crook threw off his attack he tightened his hold
on the automatic, dragging it from the man's grasp. He rolled over
on the floor&mdash;feeling the hardness of his revolver beneath his
chest. Joyce Poynter sprang to his feet, but the ex-detective
remained lying on his chest on the floor. He levelled the automatic
at the angry man.</p>

<p>"Keep still, Poynter!" Jimmie Frost spoke quietly. "No, I'm not
going to get up yet. That would give you a chance to rush
me&mdash;an opportunity you would certainly seize. Now, what's to
do?"</p>

<p>Lying on the floor, covering the crook with the automatic,
Jimmie Frost puzzled his problem. He must make no mistakes, for
"Cain" would take full advantage of any error of judgment.</p>

<p>Again came the insistent summons of the door bell. Damn it, he
must know who was there! Three times the caller had rung the bell.
The light he had left burning in the hall, when he had let "Cain"
into the flat, would indicate that he was at home. The caller might
become impatient; perhaps, think there was something wrong in the
flat&mdash;and call for assistance to force a way in. Jimmie Frost
cursed under his breath. To attempt to get to his feet would invite
the crook to attack him. He was certain that Joyce Poynter was
"Cain"&mdash;and "Cain" was known to be of infinite resource.</p>

<p>"Get to that door," he commanded, abruptly. "No, don't leave the
room," he continued, as the crook made to go into the hall. "Clasp
your hands behind your head. So! Move to the end of that door."</p>

<p>Very cautiously he raised himself to his knees, the gun levelled
at the crook; then came to his feet, For a moment he paused, then
backed into the hall. A quick movement and he was at the door, one
of the guns in his hand, the other in his pocket. He had to chance
whether the crook carried a second gun&mdash;but the man dared not
shoot while he was at the flat door, an unknown person without
demanding admission.</p>

<p>Yet, Jimmie Frost hoped little from the caller. He was only
answering the bell to prevent trouble; but he must be wary. If the
man outside the door became suspicious, if he thought anything was
wrong in the flat, he might call the police. Jimmie Frost smiled
grimly. He had come to fear the men who had formerly been his
comrades.</p>

<p>With a quick movement he flung open the door, at the same time
flattening himself against the wall beside the door. In that
position he commanded the flat entrance and the open sitting room
door. A man walked into the hall, and Jimmie Frost gasped.</p>

<p>He slammed the outer door shut. "Keep back, sir," he exclaimed,
thrusting himself between Sir Edmund Morgan and the sitting room
door. "'Cain' is in there!"</p>

<p>"Where?" The Police Commissioner looked about him
inquisitively.</p>

<p>"In the sitting room, sir."</p>

<p>The ex-detective walked forward cautiously.</p>

<p>"One moment, until I see that he's safe." A few paces inside the
sitting room he stopped, and grinned. Joyce Poynter was sitting in
the armchair he had previously occupied, peacefully smoking. During
the few minutes Jimmie Frost had been at the flat door the crook
had removed all traces of conflict from his person and the room.
Jimmie Frost turned in the doorway and looked back at Sir Edmund.
The Police Chief nodded and passed the ex-detective, entering the
room.</p>

<p>"Sir Edmund," Jimmie Frost held the revolver he carried well out
of sight. "May I introduce Mr. Joyce Poynter? Poynter, of course
you've heard of Sir Edmund Morgan, the Commissioner of Police."</p>

<p>His eyes narrowed as he watched the crook rise to his feet. The
man showed no signs of agitation. His clothing was in order and
dustless&mdash;while the ex-detective's clothing showed plain signs
of the brief rough and tumble on the sitting room floor.</p>

<p>"Sir Edmund&mdash;delighted!" Joyce Poynter bowed, his manner an
acknowledgment of the Commissioner's position. "Will you take this
chair, Sir Edmund? I chose it when I arrived, because it looked the
most comfortable one in the room."</p>

<p>"Keep your seat, sir." Sir Edmund went to the chair on the
opposite side of the fireplace. "This will do for me." He seated
himself leisurely, perched his glasses on his nose, and looked
inquisitively at the man before him. "Jimmie Frost called you Joyce
Poynter in here. In the hall, he named you, 'Cain.'"</p>

<p>"Mr&mdash;er&mdash;Jimmie Frost does me too much honour." The
crook shrugged. "'Cain?' Now where have I heard that name
before?"</p>

<p>"Read the newspapers?" Sir Edmund had his glasses fixed to his
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Of course! Everybody does. One of the queer habits of the
people of this country. Everybody reads the newspapers, and there's
nothing in 'em. Perhaps that's the reason. Doesn't excite what
brains they have. Anomalous." The crook shrugged. "Can you explain
it, Sir Edmund?"</p>

<p>"I may try; if you will explain why&mdash;er&mdash;Frost called
you 'Cain'?" Joyce Poynter shrugged, but did not reply in words,
Deliberately, he took the silver cigarette case from his pocket and
held it out to Sir Edmund. "Don't touch the beastly things."</p>

<p>The Police Chief's fingers strayed to his right-hand top
waistcoat pocket, producing one of the long black cheroots he
affected.</p>

<p>"A man should smoke tobacco, not&mdash;" A wave of the
tobacco-sample completed the sentence.</p>

<p>"Yes?" The crook gravely flicked his lighter to flame and handed
it to the old man.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" Sir Edmund inhaled deeply. For a full minute he
studied the man before him, his shrewd eyes narrowing. "So, you're
'Cain'?"</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Jimmie Frost apparently has that
opinion."</p>

<p>"Known him long?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Frost? A relation from the United States."</p>

<p>"Hm!" Again the keen young-old eyes strove to pierce the crook's
apparent phlegm. "A relation! Interesting!"</p>

<p>"That I have relations?" Poynter's eyebrows were elevated. "Most
people have, I believe."</p>

<p>"Interesting that your relation should be Jimmie Frost." The
heavy, shaggy brows came together abruptly. The crook smiled, but
did not reply.</p>

<p>"Know him in America?" The Commissioner questioned, after a
short silence.</p>

<p>"Never been there," Poynter answered nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"So you don't know if he is really Jimmy Frost?" The question
came sharply.</p>

<p>"I believe him to be that person."</p>

<p>"But you don't know?"</p>

<p>The crook did not reply. He glanced from the Police Commissioner
to the ex-detective, speculatively. At a sharp "Do you?" from Sir
Edmund, he turned abruptly.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know for certain if he is or not." There was snarl
in the crook's tones. "I don't believe he is!"</p>

<p>"And if I tell you he is, what then?"</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost was puzzled. What was the old man trying to get? He
did not interpose in the conversation, content to mount guard over
the door of the room, the revolver always ready, concealed between
his body and the door. He knew that Sir Edmund was following some
line of reasoning to which he had not yet a clue. Somewhere the old
man had obtained information&mdash;information of value. He could
only watch and listen, for the present.</p>

<p>"So you don't know Jimmie Frost." There was a purr in the Police
Chief's voice. "All you had was a message from the States informing
you that 'Jimmie Frost' was on his way to this country. Just
that&mdash;and you immediately set out to find him. You must be a
clever man, Mr. Poynter&mdash;to find him so easily."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" The crook appeared to be very nervous.</p>

<p>"Jimmie Frost has been very few days in this city. You picked up
his trail very, very easily."</p>

<p>"I may have&mdash;if this man is really Jimmie Frost."</p>

<p>"If I give you my word&mdash;that he is Jimmie Frost?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" The younger man hesitated.</p>

<p>"You want to know how I know? Shall I tell you that I, too, have
correspondents in America; that they cabled me that Jimmie Frost
was on his way to this city&mdash;to see me? That is strange news,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>Joyce Poynter did not answer. Jimmie Frost recognised that the
man's ill-ease was growing, under the Commissioner's
inquisition.</p>

<p>"Very strange that James Frost, once an inmate of Sing Sing's
death cell, should visit this city's Police Chief; that I should
visit him; apparently be prepared to protect him. These are
intriguing questions; to find answers to them should prove
occupation for more than a few of your leisure hours."</p>

<p>Sir Edmund rose, stiffly, to his feet, frowning down on the man
still seated before him. At length, his face cleared.</p>

<p>"An interesting episode," he murmured. He turned to the
ex-detective: "What do you propose to do with him?"</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost shook his head. He did not want to make a decision;
more, he was certain Sir Edmund had a definite line of action
already in mind.</p>

<p>"Jimmy Frost called you 'Cain'." The old man paused, took his
glasses from his nose and slowly placed them in their case. "I
wonder! Are you?"</p>

<p>"What? Who? 'Cain'? Who's 'Cain'?" The crook spoke angrily.</p>

<p>"'Where ignorance is bliss&mdash;'" A humorous smile came on the
old, still-firm lips. "I've had many crooks through my hands, Mr.
Poynter, since the days I walked the streets of this city, a callow
constable. Good phrase, that, Jimmie! Callow constable! And, some
of them are even more than callow. Suppose there are also callow
crooks, Mr. Poynter. Ever met them, or are you one of those the
newspapers designate as 'lone-wolf'?"</p>

<p>"That's enough from you!" Joyce Poynter, flaming anger on his
face, sprang to his feet. "I can guess what the pair of you are
getting at." He pointed at the ex-detective. "He's your
stool-pigeon, eh? Noses out the crooks for you? Well, here's one
you won't get!"</p>

<p>He turned suddenly on his heels and strode to the door, not
heeding the revolver Jimmie Frost brought into view. At a motion
from the Police Commissioner, the ex-detective stepped aside.
Almost as "Cain" reached the sitting room door, a shrill scream
echoed through the house. Again and again came the screams,
carrying on their nerve-racking shrillness a rising crescendo of
terror.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">FOR the moment the shrill agony of the screams
rooted the three men in the flat to where they stood. Sir Edmund
Morgan was the first to recover from the shock. He ran past the two
men to the flat-door, closely followed by the others. Half-way down
the first flight of stairs to the floor below, the Police Chief
hesitated in his headlong rush. The big building was buzzing like a
suddenly-disturbed bee-hive. Flat doors were being opened,
disgorging their quotas of humanity in various stages of dress and
undress. Motioning to his companions to keep close behind him, Sir
Edmund proceeded to descend the stairs more leisurely.</p>

<p>A man was standing at the head of the stairs two floors below
Jimmie Frost's flat, a small group of people surrounding him. He
appeared nervous and ill at ease. The ex-detective recognised him
immediately; he was Alec Kempton. He had seen the man in Luther
Banke's offices. The solicitor had not impressed him favourably.
Even then he had been nervous and irritable, acting as if he had
things to conceal.</p>

<p>In his keen analytical police-brain Jimmie Frost had decided
that Alec Kempton was a man well worth watching. The solicitor had
told a strange tale. He had stated that he had called on Luther
Banke on business the morning "Cain" had stolen the Montgomery
emeralds; that he had been shown into the jeweller's presence by
Martha Tayne, and had not discovered the impersonation of the
jeweller. Yet he had acted queerly, as if trying to shield the
crook.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost had not believed the solicitor, even in part. He
had come from the interview with the conviction that Alec Kempton
and "Cain" were not strangers, and that the crook had some
mysterious hold over the stout, little solicitor&mdash;who had
acted a part under threat of exposure of some misdeed.</p>

<p>Now he found this man in the building, outside Martha Tayne's
flat&mdash;and somewhere near a woman had been screaming!</p>

<p>Where, and who was the woman? The ex-detective gazed searchingly
about him. People were coming up to the landing from the lower
floors. Their faces showed bewilderment. No one showing agitation
had passed them going down to the street.</p>

<p>Without thinking, filled with the spirit of bygone days, he made
to pass the Police Chief, and take control of the inquiry. Sir
Edmund caught warningly at his sleeve. The cool, controlling
restraint brought Jimmie Frost to a realisation of his altered
position. He was now only one of the spectators. He could not
initiate; more, it was not to his advantage to take any prominent
position in public; for now he was James Frost, crook and murderer,
an escapee from Sing Sing prison. Only that day he had escaped from
the police of this city. Every constable, every detective in the
department was alert for his recapture.</p>

<p>He watched about him keenly; his eyes alert for any sign that
might lead him to the truth, his hearing attuned for any careless
words that might place him on the true trail. His body tensed as he
watched the Commissioner walk gravely down the remaining stairs and
push through the inquisitive crowd to Alec Kempton's side.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kempton?" Sir Edmund's keen eyes swept the man, yet his
tone was careless. Jimmie Frost smiled; he recognised that the old
man-hunter was on the trail. Of course, Sir Edmund would know the
man; behind the keen eyes the clever brain was working, dragging
from memory's store details of the man's history&mdash;details
which might have made the man flinch if translated into words.</p>

<p>When Alec Kempton turned to answer Sir Edmund the ex-detective
caught sight of his face, the features accentuated by the overhead
lights of the landing. The lawyer's face was deathly pale, his lips
were trembling, and the hand he lifted, as if to still them,
shook.</p>

<p>What had happened to the man? Had he voiced those awful screams?
That did not seem possible&mdash;Jimmie Frost believed they had
emanated from a woman. He glanced furtively about the group
gathered on the landing. His eyes rested on the door of Martha
Tayne's flat. He noted with surprise that it was ajar.</p>

<p>Immediately his eyes searched the landing for the girl. She was
not there. Martha Tayne! Again the ex-detective's eyes went to the
door. Did the explanation of the screams&mdash;the marked agitation
of Alec Kempton&mdash;lie In that flat?</p>

<p>Little beads of perspiration came on Jimmie Frost's brow. He
forced his way through the crowd on the landing. Was Martha Tayne
in her flat? Only a few minutes before the man who named himself
Joyce Poynter had come to him, he had seen light in her
kitchenette; he had seen her shadow on the blind. But that had been
more than an hour before. Since then she might have gone out. But
would she go out and leave her door ajar?</p>

<p>"'Ware, Jimmie!" He turned swiftly at the feel of a light touch
on his arm, to see Joyce Poynter standing beside him. For the
moment he had forgotten Poynter had been with him and Sir Edmund
when the screams had startled them. Then "Cain" had had nothing to
do with the tragedy he was beginning to believe had taken place in
that building; for "Cain"&mdash;or rather, the man he believed to
be "Cain"&mdash;had been, and still was, beside him. The man's
steady touch brought Jimmie Frost to caution. For a moment he
hesitated.</p>

<p>"All right!" Joyce Poynter spoke suddenly. "Get a move on,
man!"</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost understood. He turned to the door again, his hand
raised the bell. The door swung open under his hand, and he saw a
small wad of folded paper lying on the mat. Immediately, he picked
it up and, with his back to the people on the landing, examined it.
It was a blank sheet of common writing paper, folded many times to
a considerable thickness. On the two outsides of the wad of paper
were marks of the door-jamb. Apparently the thickness of paper had
not been sufficient to hold the door shut. How had that paper come
in the door jamb? For some seconds the ex-detective scanned the
paper and the door frame carefully, but he could discover nothing.
It was merely a common piece of paper, used to keep the door from
swinging open. A woman had screamed, and on that landing; Jimmie
Frost was certain of that! Without asking the question, he was
certain that the man at his side was of the same opinion. Had the
screams come from within that flat? That was probable.</p>

<p>So far as he knew&mdash;so far as Sir Edmund's questions had
discovered up to that moment&mdash;there was no explanation of the
cries&mdash;cries filled with terror.</p>

<p>"Hold the door, Poynter." The trained instinct of the ex-police
officer could no longer be restrained. "Keep everyone out but Sir
Edmund, and anyone he vouches for. I'll call if I want help."</p>

<p>Immediately he crossed the threshold of the flat he felt for,
and found, the light-switch. As the bulb lit, he glanced about the
little hall, replica of the hall of his own flat, two storeys
higher in the building. Nothing about him appeared unusual. The
door of the room he believed to be the sitting-room was closed. As
his fingers reached for the handle, he hesitated. He must be
cautious, careful not to destroy any clues, careful not to leave
his own fingerprints about the flat. He must remember he was no
longer the authorised police officer, Mark Denvers&mdash;he was now
Jimmie Frost, master crook. As in his own flat, another door opened
into the tiny hall. This gave access to the bedroom. For a moment
he stood undecided. Where should he commence his search? He stepped
back and switched off the light for a moment; glancing down at the
bottom of both doors.</p>

<p>A light showed under the sitting-room door. The narrow space
under the bedroom door was dark. Then, someone should be in the
sitting-room. He stepped close to the bedroom door, taking care not
to touch the wood with his bare flesh. He listened, his ear almost
against the panel. There were no sounds of persons in that room. He
went to the sitting-room door and listened. He could not hear a
movement within the room. A light was burning in the sitting-room.
Cautiously, Jimmie Frost placed his elbow against the door, and
pressed it. The door was either latched or locked. For a moment
more he hesitated, then taking out his handkerchief, gripped the
handle lightly through the linen, and turned it, pressing
forward.</p>

<p>The door opened easily. Jimmie Frost peered eagerly into the
room. The lights were full on. For a moment he thought there was no
one in the room.</p>

<p>"Get ahead, man!" Joyce Poynter behind him, was pressing him
forward, anxiety in his voice. Jimmie Frost pushed the man back,
carefully scanning the carpet between the door and the large table,
occupying the centre of the room. He must be careful not to destroy
any clues; nor to leave signs of his presence in the flat. Those
two facts he had to keep continually in mind. He looked back, over
his shoulder, at Joyce Poynter, and scowled. The crowd from the
landing were drifting into the flat-hall.</p>

<p>"You damned fool!" He turned on the crook, with a snarl. "I told
you to keep those people out!"</p>

<p>"Why? What's the matter?" drawled Joyce Poynter, simulating
surprise. "You don't think there's anything really wrong here?"</p>

<p>Irritated that his care to preserve any possible clues that
might be about the flat had been negatived by the crook's
carelessness, or intent, Jimmie Frost strode into the sitting-room.
As he went to pass around the table, he stopped and gasped. A man
was lying, face downwards on the floor. Beside him lay a girl in a
position that suggested that she had collapsed while attempting to
succour the man. The ex-detective moved forward carefully. He bent
over the prostrate man and rolled him over. At sight of the pale,
set face Jimmie Frost uttered an exclamation of unbelief. The man
on the floor, apparently dead, was Luther Banke, and the girl
beside him was Martha Tayne!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT'S the matter, Jimmie?" Jimmie Frost looked
up from beside the insensible man. Beside him stood Sir Edmund
Morgan, his keen, grey eyes moving from the ex-detective to the
couple on the floor.</p>

<p>"Who are they? Are they dead?"</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost shook his head. He scrambled to his feet, and stood
aside so that the Police Chief could see the two unconscious forms.
He remained staring down at Sir Edmund, a frown on his face, his
brain whirling with conflicting doubts and conjectures.</p>

<p>"Luther Banke!" The Commissioner's tones betrayed amazement. He
turned sharply to the two men immediately behind him.</p>

<p>"Poynter! Jimmie! You must help me! Turn all the people out of
this flat. I can't have anyone in here until my men arrive." He
turned again to the two bodies on the floor.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost helped Poynter to clear the flat of the curious
onlookers, then returned to the sitting-room, leaving the crook at
the outer door, with renewed injunctions against admitting anyone,
except the police.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room Jimmie Frost saw a man crouching
against the wall. A couple of strides and he caught him by the
shoulder, swinging him round to face the light. The man was Alec
Kempton. Jimmie Frost nodded understandingly. Sir Edmund had, no
doubt, brought the solicitor into the flat. With an exclamation of
disgust he let the man slide back into his crouch against the wall.
A moment's consideration, and he went again to the hall and
instructed Joyce Poynter that no one was to leave the flat until
further instructions were given.</p>

<p>He gave the order as a message from the Police Chief.</p>

<p>"There's something very strange here, Mark!" Sir Edmund looked
up at his former lieutenant. "Luther Banke here! Why, it's only a
few hours ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped speaking abruptly, turning again to the stricken man
on the floor. A few minutes and he looked up again. "Is there a
telephone in this flat, Ma&mdash;Jimmie?" As he spoke his eyes
searched the room. "Doesn't look as if there is one. Go somewhere
and ring up the nearest police-station. Tell the Inspector on duty
to come here, and to bring a doctor with him."</p>

<p>A man in the little group that still lingered on the landing
outside the flat, acknowledged possession of a telephone. Jimmie
Frost conveyed the Commissioner's message to the desk-sergeant at
the police station, then returned to Martha Tayne's flat. To his
secret relief the girl had regained consciousness and was sitting
on the lounge beside the Police Chief. Luther Banke still lay on
the floor, breathing stertorously.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost frowned. What had happened in that flat during the
past hour? It was evident Luther Banke and Alec Kempton had been
together in that room, probably in some kind of business
conference. But against that, the jeweller was supposed to be
confined to his bed, suffering from some form of stroke. Then, what
was the meaning of Alec Kempton's presence in the flat?</p>

<p>The ex-detective's eyes instinctively went to the corner where
he had left the solicitor. Some of the man's customary assurance
had returned. He had drawn a chair to him and was seated. Jimmie
Frost noted that the chair was so placed that the table hid Luther
Banke's body.</p>

<p>Martha Tayne, Luther Banke, and Alec Kempton!</p>

<p>For some moments Jimmie Frost puzzled the secret connection
between the three persons. If he could guess that he might be able
to reconstruct what had happened In the flat before the girl
screamed. The flat was occupied by Martha Tayne. Jimmie Frost knew,
personally, that she had been at home most of the evening. When he
had arrived home, after his escape from the police cell, he had
seen her in her kitchenette. He had no reason to believe she had
left her flat after that.</p>

<p>Both Alec Kempton and Luther Banke had come to the flat. Had
they arrived together? That only one of the three persons who had
been in the flat could, or would, tell honestly. He could ask Alec
Kempton the question, but he could not rely on the man telling the
truth. He turned abruptly to face the Commissioner and Martha
Tayne.</p>

<p>"Feeling better, Miss Tayne?" There was sympathy in Jimmie
Frost's voice. "Think you're able to talk now?"</p>

<p>"Let her alone, Jimmie." The Commissioner's voice was hard. "She
hasn't had time to think yet."</p>

<p>The ex-detective glanced quickly at the Police Chief. What did
he mean? Why should not the girl be questioned immediately. Surely
if he asked the questions that were trembling on his lips at the
moment&mdash;questioned her at a time when she was not sufficiently
composed to be evasive&mdash;he might quickly learn the truth.</p>

<p>For a moment a surge of resentment against his old chief swelled
in his breast. Why had he checked his questions? Again the picture
he had seen the previous evening, of the Commissioner bending over
the jeweller's sickbed rose to his mind's-eye. But the man he had
believed to be the Commissioner in Luther Banke's house had proved
to be "Cain." Jimmie Frost turned, almost angrily, on the
solicitor.</p>

<p>"Wasn't you screaming, was it, Mr. Kempton?" There was rancour
in his voice. If the girl was not to be questioned, surely he might
deal with this man, whose every action showed him to be a
coward.</p>

<p>"I didn't shout." Alec Kempton tried to assume a bold front.
"I&mdash;I went for help."</p>

<p>"To the head of the stairs, and screamed like a girl!" Jimmie
Frost laughed harshly. "That all you did?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You know." The ex-detective took the man by the shoulders and
swung him round so that the light from the overhead light shone
full on his face. "Only went for help, eh?"</p>

<p>The solicitor nodded, fearfully.</p>

<p>"Who heard you yell?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't shout."</p>

<p>"No?" The ex-detective laughed gratingly. "Get this. Sir Edmund,
a friend, and myself were in my flat&mdash;two floors up. We heard
someone scream&mdash;again and again. We ran out on to the stairs
and came down here, and&mdash;don't you forget this&mdash;we didn't
know where the screams came from, we had to discover this
and&mdash;" he paused, significantly "&mdash;and we never heard
another 'peep' from you. You hadn't apparently, got further than
the front-door
in&mdash;your&mdash;search&mdash;for&mdash;help!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand you." Alec Kempton's voice
quavered.</p>

<p>"I think you do." The ex-detective roughly tilted up the man's
chin, so that the light searched every feature. "You went for help,
eh? And you were here&mdash;right here, where the screams came
from! Get that! And you only got as far as the head of the stairs!
Can't you think of a better tale?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" the solicitor stuttered. Suddenly he gathered his
remaining courage, and faced the detective. "Say, who are you?"</p>

<p>"What the&mdash;" Jimmie Frost turned savagely on the man. "I'm
asking the questions! You didn't scream or shout? Then, what did
you do to make this girl scream?"</p>

<p>"He didn't!" Martha Tayne spoke suddenly. "It
was&mdash;was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" The ex-detective turned swiftly to the girl. Sir Edmund
made a movement, as if to interpose, but a quick glance from Jimmie
Frost checked him. The Commissioner leaned back on the lounge, a
little smile on his lips. Once more Mark Denvers was
incarnate&mdash;and with the brilliancy and force that had gained
him quick promotion in the department.</p>

<p>"Go on, Miss Tayne." There was now a subtle difference in the
questioner's tones, yet to ears not attuned to the finer shades of
inflection the former hardness remained. "You say that Kempton did
not make you scream?"</p>

<p>"He did not." There was no softness in the girl's eyes as she
looked at the solicitor. "Mr. Kempton came to see me on&mdash;on
business."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"We were in this room, talking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What time did Mr. Kempton arrive here?" interrupted Jimmie
Frost.</p>

<p>"About three-quarters of an hour ago." The girl looked down at
her wrist-watch as she spoke.</p>

<p>"And he was here right up to the time when&mdash;when you
screamed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"On business?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>"I am to understand you and Mr. Kempton were discussing
business, only, from the time he arrived, until you screamed?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The word was spoken hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"What business?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Luther Banke's business," the girl evaded.</p>

<p>"Humph!" The ex-detective glanced suspiciously at the girl. She
was recovering her composure far too quickly for his liking.</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Kempton come here often, to discuss Mr. Luther Banke's
business with you?"</p>

<p>"That's not quite fair, Jimmie." The Police Chief interjected in
strangely gentle tones.</p>

<p>"All's fair, chief, when there's something suspiciously like
murder about." The ex-detective spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Murder!" The girl clasped her hands to her mouth,
horrified.</p>

<p>"We're not getting anywhere!" The ex-detective was impatient.
"You were saying, Miss Tayne, that Mr. Kempton came here to discuss
business&mdash;your employer's business&mdash;at this time of
night."</p>

<p>"I have been with counsel in court all day," Alec Kempton
interposed, hastily.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne has told you. I came to discuss an important
business matter with her."</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne has not told me the nature of the business matter."
Jimmie Frost turned to the solicitor suddenly. He faced the girl
again. "Let me get this straight. Mr. Kempton came to this flat
about an hour ago&mdash;because he could not find time during
office hours to go to Mr. Luther Banke's shop. You say he came here
to discuss business&mdash;but neither you nor he appear willing to
disclose the nature of that business&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I cannot discuss Mr. Luther Banke's business with strangers."
The solicitor spoke loftily.</p>

<p>"Not even when Mr. Luther Banke lies like that?" Jimmie Frost
suddenly caught the solicitor by the arm and forced him to face the
unconscious jeweller.</p>

<p>"That is rather a strange attitude for a sworn officer of the
State's Courts to adopt, Mr. Alec Kempton, when your client appears
to be dying!"</p>

<p>Martha Tayne screamed. The ex-detective turned sharply to
her.</p>

<p>"You are going to far, Jimmie!" Sir Edmund spoke angrily. "You
are frightening Miss Tayne!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter here?" A tall, well-formed man stood in the
doorway, glancing keenly about the room. A moment, and he saw Sir
Edmund, and saluted him. "Sorry, sir! Didn't see you for the
moment, though they told me you were here."</p>

<p>At the sound of John Nott's voice Jimmie Frost turned sharply.
For the moment he feared the Inspector catching sight of his face.
Nott had been In Court that day when he faced a charge of "drunk
and disorderly"&mdash;when he had been publicly denounced as James
Frost, international crook and convicted murderer.</p>

<p>Then he grinned. It was improbable the Inspector would recognise
in the well-dressed man on evident terms of intimacy with the
Police Commissioner the dirty, unshaven tramp of the police-court.
He faced the newcomer boldly.</p>

<p>The eyes of the old comrades met and held. A puzzled expression
showed on John Nott's face; for a moment it lingered; then passed.
Jimmie Frost repressed a sigh of relief. How far had the Inspector
gone towards recognising him? He must be more wary in the
future.</p>

<p>A doctor had entered the room with the Inspector, passing
immediately to where Luther Banke lay. Presently Sir Edmund's eyes
met Jimmie Frost's, then looked significantly at the door.
Immediately the ex-detective was alert. He had received his
dismissal&mdash;the Police Chief did not wish him to be questioned
by Inspector Nott.</p>

<p>He moved quietly towards the door. A sudden thought came to him.
How had Nott come upon him without warning? He had stationed Joyce
Poynter at the outer door of the flat, with strict injunctions not
to let anyone in or out without Sir Edmund's express permission.
How then had Nott passed the man? Where was Joyce Poynter, the man
he believed to be "Cain," the mystery crook?</p>

<p>Very quietly he passed from the room to the hall. At the opened
flat-door stood a uniformed constable&mdash;alone! For a moment
Jimmie Frost hesitated, then approached the constable. The man
turned at the sounds of his step.</p>

<p>"Was there a man on guard at this door when you and the
Inspector arrived, constable?" he asked, casually. The constable
grinned, and nodded. "Cool customer, sir," he replied. "Didn't want
to let the Inspector in&mdash;said he had orders not to admit
anyone who wasn't in uniform. Then, when he saw me he remarked that
as the police had at last arrived, he supposed he wasn't wanted any
more and might just as well go back to his flat."</p>

<p>"Go back to his flat!" echoed Jimmie Frost, amazedly. "Where's
that?"</p>

<p>"Up the stairs, sir. He said 'goodnight' to me and walked up the
stairs." The constable hesitated. "I suppose he lives up
there."</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost was no longer paying attention to the constable. He
ran up the stairs to his flat. What had been Joyce Poynter's idea
in going up to his flat? There was no escape from the building that
way.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">JOHN NOTT, Detective-Inspector, stood in the
centre of Martha Tayne's little sitting-room and watched Jimmie
Frost leave the room, a puzzled frown on his face. Something about
the man brought back memories half-forgotten. He knew the man, yet
he could not place him&mdash;give him a name. Yet he believed that
name should have risen instinctively to his lips. With a shrug he
turned to face the others in the room&mdash;to find the Police
Chief watching him.</p>

<p>"All right, Nott." Sir Edmund smiled. "That man's not mixed up
in this matter. Not quite straight&mdash;y'know, but still, a
friend of mine. You can count him out."</p>

<p>Inspector Nott felt relieved. He turned to watch the police
surgeon bending over Luther Banke. It was evident from the deep
frown on the medical man's face that his patient puzzled him. At
length he looked up, speaking irritably.</p>

<p>"Where's the ambulance, Inspector? We must get this man to
hospital as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him, doctor?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"A paralytic stroke, and a severe one." Dr. Cream answered
impatiently.</p>

<p>"I know that." Sir Edmund said quietly. "He is Luther Banke, the
jeweller. No doubt you heard he was taken ill in the city a few
days ago."</p>

<p>"That sounds absurd!" Dr. Cream was on his feet now. "What
exactly do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Luther Banke was picked up in a city street three days ago,
suffering from a paralytic stroke. Since then I have visited him at
his home. I was at his house yesterday evening, and up to then he
had been unconscious."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"At Moorfield."</p>

<p>The doctor laughed, incredulously. "Do you mean to tell me that
he has been unconscious for three days then got up, dressed himself
and came here? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"I am stating facts." Sir Edmund spoke carefully. "Provable
facts. Miss Tayne will support my statements."</p>

<p>Inspector Nott turned eagerly to the girl.</p>

<p>The note of slight antagonism Jimmie Frost had allowed to creep
into his voice had aroused her from the apathy the shock of the
evenings happenings had occasioned. Her intelligence again awake,
she had a strong antipathy against the police and those who wished
to question her. Yet, towards Sir Edmund, who had sat patiently
beside her while her brain slowly recovered from the shocks of the
past hour, she only felt gratitude. He had not attempted to
question her; he had restrained others from questioning her too
sharply. She knew the high position he held; but for his quiet
insistence she might have been closely questioned&mdash;and spoken
of things that made her shudder even to think of.</p>

<p>All she knew!</p>

<p>Sudden shudders racked her body. All she knew&mdash;and she had
been so anxious and puzzled until an hour ago! Now she
knew&mdash;but did she? Or was she only guessing on a series of
events&mdash;on the few words uttered by the man who had staggered
into her room, to fall unconscious at her feet.</p>

<p>She felt, rather than saw, that Inspector Nott was watching her
keenly, waiting for the moment when he might question her. She must
be careful not to tell the police anything of vital
importance&mdash;nothing they could not obtain by questioning
others. She must make the most of the shock she had received, and
of her present condition. At all costs she must gain
time&mdash;until Luther Banke could speak, and she could explain
everything, and receive his instructions.</p>

<p>Forcing her nerves under control she looked up at the
detective.</p>

<p>"Sir Edmund is correct," she said softly. "He has been out twice
to see Mr. Luther Banke during the past three days. I have been out
to 'Rosewood' every evening since Mr. Luther Banke was taken ill. I
went out hoping Mr. Luther Banke had recovered consciousness, and
could give me the necessary instructions for carrying on his
business."</p>

<p>"You are in Mr. Luther Banke's employ?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"I am his personal secretary. When he is absent from business I
am in full charge."</p>

<p>"So you went to Mr. Luther Banke's house&mdash;'Rosewood,'
Moorfield, I believe you said&mdash;every evening to receive his
instructions. Did he, at any time since he was taken ill, speak to
you&mdash;give you any sign, when you spoke to him, that he heard
and understood?"</p>

<p>Martha Tayne shook her head, a sad little smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"Not once," she said. "Since the afternoon Mr. Luther Banke was
suddenly taken ill he has not spoken to me, or given any sign he
heard, or understood when I spoke to him."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Nott showed his bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Banke has been completely unconscious since the stroke,"
Sir Edmund explained. "He has not spoken a word, even to his
nurse."</p>

<p>"You told me you went to Mr. Luther Banke's house this evening,
Miss Tayne?" Nott turned again to the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Banke was then unconscious?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The nurse told me there had been no change."</p>

<p>"Who is professionally attending Mr. Luther Banke?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Matthews. He is neighbour to Mr. Luther Banke, and has been
his medical attendant for years."</p>

<p>"Do you know Dr. Matthew's opinion regarding Mr. Luther Banke's
condition?"</p>

<p>"Only what Nurse Pringle has told me."</p>

<p>"What is that?" Noticing that the girl hesitated to reply, the
Inspector added: "This is not a court, Miss Tayne, and hearsay
evidence is admissible, and sometimes illuminating."</p>

<p>"Nurse Pringle told me that Dr. Matthews considered that Mr.
Luther Banke was in a very serious condition, and
that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" encouraged the detective.</p>

<p>"That he might not recover consciousness until just before
the&mdash;the end." Martha Tayne spoke in a very low voice.</p>

<p>"When did Nurse Pringle tell you this?"</p>

<p>"This evening&mdash;about seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"That was the last time you saw Mr. Banke?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;until he opened the door and walked into this
room."</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I screamed." For some seconds the girl paused, then added: "I
thought&mdash;perhaps I was foolish&mdash;but I thought I saw a
ghost."</p>

<p>Again there was silence; then the detective asked; "Were you
alone when Mr. Banke walked into the room?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Alec Kempton&mdash;Mr. Luther Banke's
solicitor&mdash;was here with me."</p>

<p>Inspector Nott's eyes went swiftly to the man seated in a corner
of the room. "A friendly call?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Alec Kempton came to see me on business connected with the
firm."</p>

<p>"How long was he with you before&mdash;" The Inspector did not
finish his sentence. He glanced at the still form on the floor.</p>

<p>"About twenty minutes."</p>

<p>"You admitted Mr. Kempton to the flat&mdash;you opened the door
to him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I live alone."</p>

<p>"You closed the outer door, after you admitted Mr.
Kempton&mdash;you are quite certain?"</p>

<p>"Quite certain."</p>

<p>"Then, how did Mr. Banke gain admission?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know." Martha Tayne paused, then continued: "I
did not know that Mr. Luther Banke was in the flat&mdash;I did not
know that he had regained consciousness&mdash;until he came into
the room."</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl rose to her feet and turned to Sir Edmund:
"Please, may I go to my room for a while. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Police Commissioner nodded. Inspector' Nott opened the door
for her. As she left the room she averted her eyes from the
solicitor. When he had closed the door after the girl, the
Inspector turned to Alec Kempton.</p>

<p>"Your name Kempton?"</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Alexander Kempton, senior partner in the firm of
Wallis, Kempton &amp; Co." The solicitor spoke with feeble
dignity.</p>

<p>"Yeah!" The keen eyes of the detective stared at the man
bleakly. "That gets us nowhere. What did you come here for
tonight?"</p>

<p>"I came to speak to Miss Tayne on business."</p>

<p>"You heard her say that, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Alec Kempton tried to look indignant, but
failed.</p>

<p>"You were here when Mr. Luther Banke walked into the room?"</p>

<p>"Yes." (Very hesitatingly). "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you say it&mdash;you look it, y'know."</p>

<p>"Look, what?"</p>

<p>"Look here." Inspector Nott moved closer to the solicitor,
bending over him aggressively. "I'm asking the
questions&mdash;understand? When was the last time you saw Mr.
Luther Banke? I'm not referring to when he came here an hour or so
ago."</p>

<p>"Three days ago&mdash;at his office."</p>

<p>"Then you haven't been out to his house at Moorfield since he's
been ill?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"The last time you saw Mr. Luther Banke, he was quite well."</p>

<p>"He looked very ill." Alec Kempton hesitated, then added, as if
in explanation: "I was with him early in the afternoon of the day
he was taken ill."</p>

<p>'"So!" Inspector Nott paused a moment, then asked: "You say, you
came here 'to see Miss Tayne&mdash;on business. What business?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Luther Banke's business."</p>

<p>"What about Mr. Luther Banke's business?"</p>

<p>"I decline to answer that question. The business is extremely
confidential."</p>

<p>"So confidential that it cannot be told to the police&mdash;when
Mr. Banke lies&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>Alec Kempton did not answer. The detective continued,
mercilessly:</p>

<p>"So confidential and private that it could be discussed,
however, with one of Mr. Bankers employees?"</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne is Mr. Luther Banke's confidential secretary. While
he is ill she controls his business and private interests."</p>

<p>"Leave it at that!" Inspector Nott showed impatience. For some
moments he paced the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly he halted before the Commissioner, to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Lor', chief! If only Mark Denvers was here to handle this bird!
I bet he'd 'cheep' for him!"</p>

<p>Sir Edmund nodded. He had seen the quick light flame in the
solicitor's eyes at the mention of the Detective-Inspector's
name&mdash;at the suggestion that he could make unwilling witnesses
talk. Did the man know that but a short half-hour before, Mark
Denvers had stood in that room, and but for the advent of Inspector
Nott would have questioned him? The Commissioner believed he
did.</p>

<p>"So you won't tell me what you and that girl were discussing?"
Inspector Nott suddenly ceased his pacing of the room, halting
before Kempton and snapping out the question. The solicitor
started, but shook his head, negatively.</p>

<p>"You are prepared to swear the matter is so confidential that it
cannot be mentioned&mdash;even when Mr. Luther got off his
death-bed and travelled eight miles to learn its nature?"</p>

<p>The detective drew a bow at venture. Alec Kempton made no
answer.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Luther Banke speak when he came into the room?"</p>

<p>Again Inspector Nott tried to surprise the truth out of the man.
For a moment Alec Kempton's lips parted. Sir Edmund thought the man
was going to answer in the affirmative, but the solicitor remained
silent.</p>

<p>"So he did speak!" The detective had caught the unspoken
affirmative. "What did he say?"</p>

<p>The lawyer's lips pressed together into an almost invisible
line.</p>

<p>"Good enough!" Inspector Nott almost chortled. "So Mr. Luther
Banke had something to say before he fell, unconscious. But did he
fall or did you strike him down? That's possible, y'know. You won't
tell me? Very well; we'll have the girl in to face you. Between the
lies you both tell we may get some truth."</p>

<p>The Inspector turned to Dr. Cream: "How's your patient, doctor?
Still unconscious! Humph! When will I be able to question him?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid&mdash;never." Dr. Cream spoke gravely.</p>

<p>"You say&mdash;" The detective hesitated. "Will he die?"</p>

<p>"Eventually." The medical man spoke with a slight smile. "He may
last, like he is now, without speech, without motion, helpless and
inarticulate but, perhaps, cognisant of everything around
him&mdash;" The doctor paused, then continued: "Can you imagine a
living brain in a dead body? Can you realise that the man lying
there may be understanding everything that is taking
place&mdash;seeing everything within range of his eyes; hearing
everything yet unable to move, speak, or even give the slightest
indication that he is alive&mdash;totally unable to express a
single desire?"</p>

<p>For some moments the detective stood before Dr. Cream, awed by
the vivid picture of a living death, then, with abrupt decision,
turned and strode to Martha Tayne's bedroom door. At the door,
Inspector Nott knocked gently, bending his head to listen for an
answer. Again he knocked. A couple of seconds, and he turned and
glanced at the Police Chief.</p>

<p>Sir Edmund showed his perplexity on his face. He hesitated, then
nodded, imperatively, at the Inspector. Again Inspector Nott
knocked. He waited a moment then turned the handle and flung open
the door, striding into the room. A few minutes, and he returned to
the sitting-room, his face showing perplexity. "Something strange
here, chief," he said, slowly. "That girl's not in her
room&mdash;she's not in the flat. I've been right through it.
Constable Phillips, on guard at the outer door swears she hasn't
passed him. Where the devil can she be?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">MARTHA TAYNE had disappeared from her flat;
disappeared without leaving a single clue to the method of escape,
or to where she had gone. Inspector Nott was completely
baffled.</p>

<p>Another, and very keen search of the premises showed that the
only possible exit was by the front door; and that had been under
the constable's eye from the Inspector's arrival.</p>

<p>Why had Martha Tayne run away?</p>

<p>Sir Edmund Morgan puzzled the question. She had not been
frightened; he had been careful that neither Jimmie Frost nor John
Nott should question her too sharply. She had answered their
questions with apparent frankness, evading only those relating to
her interview with Alec Kempton. Both the girl and the man had
declared that the latter's call that evening had been solely
concerned with Luther Banke's business. Sir Edmund doubted this and
could not understand why Martha Tayne had supported the lawyer in
the evasion. He believed that if Luther Banke was able to speak, he
would declare Alec Kempton handled nothing that could not be
immediately revealed in cases of necessity. Frankly, Sir Edmund
gravely doubted the little solicitor's integrity. What compact was
there between Martha Tayne and Alec Kempton? If there was some sort
of understanding between the two, did it refer to the mystery crook
"Cain?"</p>

<p>Sir Edmund remembered that when "Cain" paid his first visit to
Luther Banke's jewellery store the girl and the lawyer had been
antagonistic. Alec Kempton had shown contemptuous pusillanimity. He
had tried to conceal and shield "Cain."</p>

<p>Why? The Commissioner's memory suddenly recalled the report Mark
Denvers had made when he returned from his first visit to Luther
Banke's shop. He had written that Martha Tayne had given him the
impression that she was withholding information she possessed
regarding "Cain."</p>

<p>Martha Tayne and Alec Kempton! Antagonistic one to the other,
yet allied to protect the greatest and most dangerous crook the
law-forces of the state had ever had to combat.</p>

<p>With a quiet word of commendation and encouragement to Inspector
Nott, Sir Edmund left Martha Tayne's flat and climbed the stairs in
search of Jimmie Frost. He had to see him as soon as possible The
inquiry had passed out of his hands; he dared not intervene
further.</p>

<p>Martha Tayne had fled from Inspector Nott's inquisition. Why,
Sir Edmund could not understand. Then Jimmie Frost had better
disappear, also; at least until Inspector Nott's inquiries in that
building were completed. As he laboured up the stairs the old man
smiled sardonically. If those to whom he was responsible could read
his thoughts at that moment; review his actions!</p>

<p>Sir Edmund had left Inspector Nott re-examining Alec Kempton. In
that the Police Chief felt no compunctions. The lawyer was a
coward&mdash;and worse. He had attempted to shelter behind the
girl. He had been prepared to sacrifice the girl to save "Cain."
Let Inspector Nott work his will on him. Nothing the lawyer could
say, or admit, could make worse the position of the two persons the
Commissioner was prepared to stretch his authority to the utmost to
protect.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost's flat was in darkness, although the door was ajar.
Sir Edmund switched on the sitting-room lights and seated himself
in one of the armchairs. He was tired&mdash;very tired; tired in
brain as well as in body. He was an old man!</p>

<p>Insistently now his brain repeatedly travelled back to old
days&mdash;days when he had walked the streets of that city, garbed
in the constable blue, virile, alert, full of enthusiasm and
ambition; days when he had lived under an Indian sun, mounting
rapidly the ladder of success. He had realised his ambitions. Step
by step he had mounted through the various grades of police work,
to the highest office in the service. He had been Police
Commissioner when his King's son had toured that land. His
knighthood was a recognition of his services&mdash;but that was
another story!</p>

<p>In those days the super-crook "Cain" had not risen to trouble
the country.</p>

<p>"Cain!" The greatest crook he had fought. But, what of
"Cain?"</p>

<p>Now he remembered. Jimmie Frost had insisted that "Cain" was
connected in some way with four men, Who were they? Ah, he
remembered! Pell, Michaelstein, Symonds and Kilson. They were all
men he had known&mdash;some of them he had liked. All dead! And now
Luther Banke!</p>

<p>Pell, Michaelstein, Symonds, Kilson, and Banke! Suddenly, he sat
upright. There was a thought growing in his brain&mdash;a thought
that would not quickly assume complete form. Yet, amid the wavy
outline of nebulous ideas, one name stood out clearly&mdash;the
name of Alec Kempton. If only he could remember! Again the Police
Chief lay back in his chair, biting savagely on the black cheroot
between his teeth. He was old, old; and he could not remember
easily. In bygone days&mdash;when he was young&mdash;</p>

<p>Papers! Lost papers! Alec Kempton and lost papers! But a while
ago, in Martha Tayne's flat, Alec Kempton had admitted to John Nott
that he had asked Martha Tayne for some papers. He had stated that
he believed they were in the jewellery store safe. Pell,
Michaelstein, Banke&mdash;Again and again the names swept through
his memory. And always one was missing. Banke, Kilson, Symonds,
Kempton&mdash;There was one name missing&mdash;a name he could not
recall&mdash;a face he could not remember!</p>

<p>Little beads of perspiration jutted out on his
forehead&mdash;his hands, clasping the leather arms of his chair in
savage intensity, became clammy. Banke, Kempton&mdash;and a bundle
of papers! A lawyer&mdash;and a bundle of papers! A missing name
and a bundle of papers&mdash;missing papers.</p>

<p>Yes, that was right! He had advanced another step In memory's
maze. A name and&mdash;and he could solve the riddle; place the man
who had defied him&mdash;defied his country's laws. "You here,
chief?"</p>

<p>The cord of memory, tautened almost to ringing point, snapped.
Sir Edmund sat up, blinking. Before him stood the man he had named
James Frost.</p>

<p>"Ah, Jimmie!" In an instant the old man had himself under
control. "And our friend Poynter?"</p>

<p>"Got away." The ex-detective winced as he spoke. "For the moment
I'd forgotten about him&mdash;at the door-"</p>

<p>"'Cain' never forgets." The words were spoken almost in a
whisper. "Never mind, Jimmie. Inspector Nott also played to
ill-luck. One of his&mdash;er&mdash;exhibits also got away."</p>

<p>"Kempton? I'd have hardly thought he'd have had the nerve!"</p>

<p>"No. Martha Tayne."</p>

<p>"You mean-?"</p>

<p>"It is hard to understand." Sir Edmund shook his head sadly.
"Foolish girl."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;why&mdash;did she run away?"</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne asked permission to go to her room for a few
minutes. When she did not return within a reasonable time, John
Nott went after her&mdash;and couldn't find her."</p>

<p>"&mdash;and 'Cain' came upstairs." Sir Edmund looked up quickly,
at the ex-detective.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" he asked. For the moment Jimmie
Frost did not reply. He had spoken on impulse&mdash;more by
instinct than by thought. In his sub-conscious mind two facts
linked: "Cain" in his disguise of Joyce Poynter had come
upstairs&mdash;to disappear; Martha Tayne had entered her
bedroom&mdash;and disappeared.</p>

<p>Upstairs! Some kink in his brain held and magnified the word.
But there was only one exit to Martha Tayne's flat&mdash;the door
guarded by the constable. The man had sworn the girl had not passed
that door; he had stated that he had watched Joyce Poynter walk
upstairs.</p>

<p>Martha Tayne's flat was on the second storey of the building;
his own flat was on the fourth floor. Above his flat was only one
storey&mdash;the fifth floor&mdash;and then the roof. A flat
roof!</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost knew that Poynter was not now in the building. In
his search for the crook he had visited every occupied flat,
closely questioning the occupants. There was no fire escape
attached to the building&mdash;no way down to the street but by the
wide stone-lined stairs and passages, through the centre of the
house. The houses flanking the building were but two storeys high.
An active man might lower himself from the roof of the block of
flats to an adjacent roof, but if he did so he would have to leave
his rope to mark the route of his escape, Jimmie Frost knew there
was no rope. He had examined the roof.</p>

<p>"Well?" The quick, staccato word from the Police Chief aroused
the ex-detective from his reverie.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," he spoke meditatively.</p>

<p>"Understand what?" Jimmie Frost drew a chair forward. "I left
Joyce Poynter on guard at Miss Tayne's flat-door. When Inspector
Nott arrived he left&mdash;coming upstairs."</p>

<p>"He may have thought the main door of the building was guarded."
The ex-detective shook his head; that was not the right reason.
"Cain" knew; his actions were reasoned, never guessed.</p>

<p>"Then you connect Miss Tayne's disappearance with&mdash;with
Joyce Poynter coming upstairs?" Sir Edmund demanded.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost nodded. "I believe so," he said.</p>

<p>"But Poynter never saw Martha Tayne after she recovered
consciousness," objected the Commissioner. "You put him on guard at
the flat-door almost immediately we arrived."</p>

<p>Again Jimmie Frost nodded. "I thought he had escaped by means of
a rope from the roof&mdash;but there was no rope there, no signs of
there having been one there."</p>

<p>"Why do you insist on Martha Tayne's disappearance being
connected with Joyce Poynter?" asked Sir Edmund, curiously.</p>

<p>"She could not have escaped from her flat unaided."</p>

<p>The Police Chief did not reply. The statement was a fact. But
even with outside aid, how had the girl escaped?</p>

<p>"You have examined all the flats above the second floor?" asked
the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"I have been in every flat; questioned the occupants." The
ex-detective was emphatic. "I cannot attach a suspicion to any
flat&mdash;or to any occupant. Somehow 'Cain' managed the trick
alone."</p>

<p>For long minutes there was silence in the room, then Jimmie
Frost commenced to speak, his eyes half-closed, his voice a tired
drawl.</p>

<p>"Poynter leaves Martha Tayne's flat;&mdash;he comes upstairs in
full view of the a constable&mdash;he turns the corner of the
stairs, then&mdash;What next?"</p>

<p>For a full minute he was silent, then he continued: "He would
first think of the roof. He would discard that thought, for he had
learned before he entered the building that there was no escape
that way&mdash;unless he had already planted a rope there. He would
know that a rope would indicate the line of his flight&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man's eyes had gradually closed; deep lines of mental
concentration showed on his forehead. Slowly, he continued; "He had
no confederate in any flat in the building&mdash;Rule them out.
'Cain' works alone. But how? Only a rope would have served.
Rope!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly Jimmie Frost jumped to his feet and ran out of the
room. In a few minutes he returned, dangling in his hand a short
piece of rope.</p>

<p>"Sorry, sir!" A quaint smile flecked the ex-detective's lips as
he threw the rope on the table and dropped into his chair. "I'm
losing my punch!"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Wandered about the flat roof above for quite a time; searched
the laundries and sheds there&mdash;and never noticed that all the
clothes-line had mysteriously disappeared. That's the way our
friend 'Cain' went."</p>

<p>"And Martha?"</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost nodded, gloomily. "She's too nice a girl to be
mixed up with that crook. I wonder why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How?" Sir Edmund interjected, loudly.</p>

<p>"Sir?" Jimmie Frost looked up quickly, astonished. "You say
Poynter&mdash;or 'Cain,' if you like&mdash;took the clothes-line
from the roof and escaped. How?"</p>

<p>For minutes there was silence In the room; then abruptly Jimmie
Frost rose to his feet, beckoned Sir Edmund to follow him, and led
into the kitchenette of his flat. The little room was in wild
disorder. The window was open and swung idly in a small breeze.
Over the window-sill was draped yards of rope.</p>

<p>"Never thought of my own flat, sir." The ex-detective spoke
ruefully. "Nor of the clothes-line, either."</p>

<p>"See," he continued, pointing out of the window. "Down there is
a window of Martha Tayne's flat. In some way Joyce Poynter
attracted her attention, then, with the clothes-line he managed to
lower her to the ground, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bring her up here," concluded Sir Edmund, ironically.</p>

<p>"Jumping Joe!" exclaimed Jimmie Frost, In amazement. Abruptly he
turned and went out of the flat. Ten minutes later he returned to
announce: "Martha Tayne's flat door is shut&mdash;and the flat
beneath this flat, on her floor, is empty."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">FOR more than an hour after Sir Edmund left him,
Jimmie Frost paced his sitting-room pondering his problem. He was
annoyed with himself.</p>

<p>He had had "Cain" in his hands, and had allowed him to escape.
More, the crook had taken Martha Tayne with him. Why had the girl
allowed "Cain" to take her from her flat? What inducements, what
threats, had he used to her?</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost swore under his breath. He had relied on the girl
to unconsciously lead him to the crook. He believed that "Cain" was
greatly attracted to the girl and could not long keep outside her
orbit. Now "Cain" had abducted the girl, taking her almost out of
the hands of the police! His raid had succeeded because of its
audacity.</p>

<p>Yet, in detail, how had he accomplished it?</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost had a theory; at the moment he had no proof to his
theory. Before he could search for that proof the police had to
leave the building. He had to wait until the tenants of the flats
settled down for the night.</p>

<p>Time passed slowly. Again and again Jimmie Frost crept down the
stairs until he could see the door of Martha Tayne's flat; see
through the glass of the hall-door the light that proclaimed the
police still held possession of the place. Sounds ascending through
the echoing space of the stairs and corridors at length warned
Jimmie Frost that Inspector Nott had finished his inquiries in
Martha Tayne's flat.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost ran down the stairs until he could see the landing
before Martha Tayne's door. He saw John Nott close the door and
join the constable and Alec Kempton on the landing. Kempton was
angrily flushed. The ex-detective watched them tramp down the
stairs; he followed cautiously, until they passed the main doors,
on to the street.</p>

<p>Silently, in his rubber-soled shoes, he went through the house,
noting that the tenants appeared settled for the night; then
returned to the second-storey landing.</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated before the door of Martha Tayne's
flat, the urge to go in and search being strong on his mind. He
turned on his heel and went to the empty flat. This flat was in a
line with his, one floor intervening. A Yale lock held the outer
door. Jimmie Frost made a brief examination of the lock. Yale locks
are considered "safe!"</p>

<p>He laughed softly as his fingers searched his waistcoat pocket.
An old lag had once shown him how "safe" such locks were. The
queerly-bent piece of steel slipped easily into the keyhole. He
manipulated it carefully. Then his left hand came up to the lock,
holding a long, thin pointed instrument. It passed into the lock
above the "key."</p>

<p>A click, and the door swung open. A slight light from the
landing flickered into the hall of the flat. Jimmie Frost peered
ahead. The flat was empty, though furnished. For a moment he
hesitated, his finger on the light-button. That light would be too
dangerous. He pulled his torch from his pocket. Shading the light
with his fingers, he moved into the flat, closing the hall-door
behind him. He listened at the closed sitting-room door for a
moment before opening it and entering the room.</p>

<p>He released the light of his torch and let it circle the room,
careful that it did not shine on the windows. From the sitting-room
a door opened into the kitchenette. The door was half-open.
Immediately he passed the door he saw that the window was open.</p>

<p>He had expected that. On the sink under the window and on the
sill he saw signs of someone scrambling awkwardly into the flat.
Martha Tayne was a plucky girl! Mentally, Jimmie Frost made his
acknowledgements to her bravery. He looked out of the window,
across the light-well to the opposite kitchenette. It was evident
that the girl had swung from one window to the other on the
clothes-line held by the crook&mdash;a risk many men would have
hesitated to take in the darkness of night.</p>

<p>What fears of the police had induced the girl to undertake that
hazardous feat? What had she feared from their questioning? What
threats or inducements had "Cain" made to her?</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost let the torch-light play slowly about the room. It
came to rest on a door. From his knowledge of his own flat, the
ex-detective knew this opened into the bathroom. He thought the
door moved as the light rested on it. The movement had been almost
imperceptible, yet he was certain the door had moved.</p>

<p>Some instinct warned him there was someone in the bathroom,
watching him. His pulse missed a beat. He knew now that the hunch
he had followed earlier in the evening was correct. Someone was
behind that door! Almost he cried out the man's name. His hand
reached to his hip-pocket for his automatic. Then caution asserted
itself.</p>

<p>Slowly, methodically, he commenced to search the kitchenette. He
found ample signs that others had been there recently. With
apparent concentration he searched the small place, conscious that
hidden eyes were watching his movements. Gradually he approached
the bathroom door, careful not to betray interest in it or the room
beyond. In one sudden bound he reached the door and pulled it
open.</p>

<p>The light from his torch swept the room. Instinct drew his
attention to the bedroom door. Again he sprang forward, and, as his
hand touched the handle, he heard the key turn in the lock.</p>

<p>With a muttered curse, Jimmie Frost ran back, through the
kitchenette to the sitting-room. As he entered the room the door to
the hall closed hastily; he heard the key grate in the lock.</p>

<p>Again he had been out-manoeuvred. He realised, with a wry grin
that he was a prisoner within the flat. It would take him very few
minutes to pick any of the locks, but minutes were precious when
"Cain" was on the run.</p>

<p>Again came sounds of a door closing. Jimmie Frost swore through
his clenched teeth. That door could only have been the hall-door of
the flat closing after "Cain." Had he left the flat alone?</p>

<p>The ex-detective believed he had been accompanied by Martha
Tayne. The sitting-room door was troublesome. First, he had to get
rid of the key, which the crook had left in the lock on the other
side of the door.</p>

<p>Then, in his haste, he twice failed to hold the raised wards. At
length he succeeded in his task, and the door opened. The hall was
in darkness and the outer door shut. Listening for a moment, to
make sure no one was passing up or down the stairs, he slipped out
of the flat, closing the door silently. Instinct drew his eyes to
the adjoining flat&mdash;the one occupied by Martha Tayne.</p>

<p>He stopped with a little gasp of surprise. The door was shut,
and there was a light in the hall. Yet Inspector Nott had left the
place in darkness. Martha Tayne had returned! Was she alone; where
had she been?</p>

<p>He could get answers to those questions. He knew now that "Cain"
had swung the girl from her kitchenette window to the empty flat
then, altering his disguise to baffle the constable had come
downstairs and joined her. Was "Cain" now with Martha Tayne in her
flat? Jimmie Frost believed he was.</p>

<p>He reached out a hand to the door-bell, then hesitated. Whenever
he had faced the master-crook openly he had been outwitted and
defeated. In the future he would play a waiting game&mdash;he would
be a shadow on the man's trail&mdash;waiting patiently until he
could catch him off guard. Then the long, painful search the old
police chief had placed on his shoulders would end.</p>

<p>Stealthily, he mounted the stairs to the half-landing. There he
made himself as comfortable as the stone floor would permit,
waiting for "Cain" to come from the girl's flat. The long minutes
dragged, and Jimmie Frost mustered his patience. Grimly he
reflected, he would have to exercise his patience during the coming
days, while he waited and watched for the master-crook to make that
one fatal error that would place him behind the bars of a
prison-cell.</p>

<p>Gradually the ex-detective's mind reverted to the girl, Martha
Tayne. What would she do? Would she continue to occupy the flat,
acting as if she had done nothing unusual in evading the police? Or
would she leave that building, for some secret hide-out prepared
for her by "Cain?"</p>

<p>He must be prepared for that. If the girl decided to remain at
the flat, continue her normal existence? Jimmie Frost smiled
grimly. Inspector Nott would be furious. But what could he do? The
girl had committed no offence, to the Inspector's knowledge. He
could question her&mdash;but she need not answer his questions.
However inquisitive the Inspector he could not force explanations.
A sense of "Cain's" abnormal criminal cleverness came to the
ex-detective. The man ordered events to suit his purposes; more, he
was alert to take advantage of every opportune circumstance. Martha
Tayne had, for the moment, been a threat to his liberty; in her
hysterical condition she might have spoken words that would have
revealed the crook's real identity. Therefore he had taken
her&mdash;literally taken her out of the hands of the police.</p>

<p>Yet he had not compromised her. She could return to her normal
existence at any moment&mdash;and be forced to no explanations.</p>

<p>Seated on the cold, stone steps, watching the door of Martha
Tayne's flat, Jimmie Frost tried to follow the master-crook's line
of thought. The girl had screamed when Luther Banke, whom she
believed was lying on his death-bed, had walked into her sitting
room. Some officious fool, or fools&mdash;and here he had to
include the Police Commissioner and himself&mdash;had telephoned
the police. Inquiries had resulted in the negative. No crime had
been committed. A woman had the right to scream, day or night. It
was a sex privilege assumed through the ages and which set at
defiance man-made laws. To call the police because a woman had
screamed&mdash;and without first inquiring into the cause of her
hysteria&mdash;was to make oneself ridiculous.</p>

<p>Luther Banke had come to Martha Tayne's flat. Possibly he had
done so before. But Luther Banke had been lying unconscious for
several days, at his home at Moorefield. The doctors had diagnosed
him to be suffering from a paralytic stroke. Then how had he
travelled from Moorefield to Martha Tayne's flat? He had first to
regain consciousness, and command of his limbs. He had to conceal
his recovery from doctors and nurses. He had to raise himself from
his bed and dress himself&mdash;to leave the house unnoticed. He
had to find a public vehicle and give his instructions without the
attendant noticing his condition.</p>

<p>All these facts were impossibilities unless he received aid.
There could be only one answer to the various points of the
problem. In some manner "Cain" had obtained access to Luther Banke,
and control of his actions. He had brought him from Moorefield to
the block of flats.</p>

<p>Yet, how had "Cain" known that the jeweller had regained
consciousness? So far, the ex-detective believed he had reasoned
correctly. He believed "Cain" had known that Alec Kempton had
planned to visit Martha Tayne that night. Luther Banke's partial
recovery had shown a way to stop any plans the lawyer was making.
"Cain" had abducted the jeweller for that purpose, planning to
break in on the conference at the psychological moment.</p>

<p>What had been "Cain's" objective in submitting Martha Tayne to
so terrible a shock? What had he hoped to gain by the jeweller's
intrusion when the interview between the girl and the lawyer was
only to discuss trade business?</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost now knew that "Cain" was the pivot on which turned
the strange happenings surrounding Luther Banke and Martha Tayne.
He could trace the hand and the brain of the master-crook in the
happenings, but he had not the faintest idea of the ultimate
objective of the elaborate plans.</p>

<p>The door of Martha Tayne's flat opened suddenly and the man who
had named himself Joyce Poynter came out on the landing. For a
brief moment he stood at the door, talking to the girl, then walked
out on the landing. Now Martha Tayne came to the door. Jimmie Frost
watched her intently.</p>

<p>The girl showed no signs of the stress of the past hours. She
was smiling; once she laughed. Presently she turned and re-entered
the flat, waving a farewell. Jimmie Frost came to his feet,
prepared to follow the crook. To his amazement "Cain," instead of
descending the stairs, came towards the upper floors. Puzzled at
the crook's behaviour, Jimmie Frost retreated up the stairs, moving
as silently as possible.</p>

<p>With relief, he remembered that he had left his door ajar. When
he was fairly confident "Cain" was making for his flat, he ran
noiselessly up the remaining stairs, entered his flat and closed
the door. Pressing his ear against the door-panel, he listened
intently. "Cain" came up the stairs slowly, but without any attempt
to conceal his presence. The ex-detective heard the crook pause
outside his door. For some seconds there were no sounds from the
landing, then the flap of the letterbox was raised and something
light fell to the hall-floor. Followed the soft "pad-pad" of feet
descending the stairs.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost waited until sound told him that "Cain" had reached
the landing below, then opened the hall-door. The landing light
showed a man's visiting card lying on the mat. Thrusting it hastily
into his vest pocket, he ran down the stairs, intent on keeping the
crook in sight. He caught sight of "Cain" again as the crook passed
through the double swing-doors in the main hall. Waiting a few
moments, he followed to the street.</p>

<p>He had barely reached the outer doors when he heard sounds of a
motor-engine. As he came to the street he saw a vehicle ahead,
moving slowly and making for the main street. The ex-detective ran
in the same direction, intent on finding a taxi and following the
crook. But no vehicles were in sight in that quiet quarter of the
town. At length the car carrying the crook turned a corner,
gathering speed. Almost stamping with impotent anger, Jimmie Frost
was forced to give up the pursuit. Again "Cain" had defeated
him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">DAY after day Jimmie Frost searched the city for a
clue that would again place him on the trail of "Cain." From the
time he had driven from the flats where Martha Tayne lived nothing
had been heard of him. Amid excursions into the city and suburbs to
points where he hoped to pick up news of the master-crook, Jimmie
Frost kept a careful watch over Martha Tayne.</p>

<p>The girl had resumed her former routine of life and went about
her duties with apparent unconcern. With admirable regularity she
left her flat for the jewellery store each morning, and, after
business hours, journeyed to the Moorefield Hospital, where Luther
Banke had been conveyed by the police. Saturday afternoons and
Sundays she spent by the sick man's side.</p>

<p>Inspector Nott saw Martha Tayne the day following the happenings
at her flat At first, the girl had refused to answer his questions;
then had declared she had been shocked into screaming by the
startling apparition of a man she believed to be helpless on a
sick-bed, many miles away. She refused any explanation of Alec
Kempton's call, referring the Inspector to the lawyer. She would
answer no questions regarding her escape from her flat, treating
the matter as a joke on the constable.</p>

<p>John Nott met with no better success when he attempted to
question Alec Kempton. The intervening hours had permitted the
lawyer to regain his nerve. He refused to answer the Inspector's
questions, and when pressed for replies, threatened legal action.
He claimed no crime had been committed, and therefore the Inspector
had no right to interfere.</p>

<p>Luther Banke made no progress towards recovery. The doctors
could not explain how a man in his condition had journeyed
half-a-dozen miles across the busy city. Day after day the jeweller
lay, a helpless, senseless body, apparently unconscious of what was
going on about him.</p>

<p>Here, again, Jimmie Frost was puzzled. The keenest inquiries by
the police had not uncovered one person who had seen him on the
journey. On Jimmie Frost's insistence, Sir Edmund had the jeweller
examined by the leading medical experts of the city&mdash;with the
usual conflict of opinions.</p>

<p>"Cain" had disappeared, apparently, and much of the newspaper
comment he had caused had given place to newer sensations. Yet
Jimmie Frost was certain the crook was alert and working. During
his recent operations the crook had netted several thousands
pounds, mainly from Luther Banke. Yet the ex-detective believed
"Cain" had a further objective, and would strike again soon. He
wondered if that move would be against the jeweller's life.</p>

<p>Many evenings the old Police Chief and the ex-detective sat in
the letter's flat, discussing their problem. During those long and
intimate talks Sir Edmund revealed to his companion the strange
perplexities that beset him&mdash;his vain mental searches for the
missing links in memory's chain. Sir Edmund was emphatic that if
Alec Kempton could be made to speak he could reveal many clues
towards the identity of the super-crook. Jimmie Frost, also,
believed that the lawyer was withholding valuable information; that
even if they could discover the "business" that had taken him to
Martha Tayne's flat that night they could make further progress
with their Inquiries.</p>

<p>But, as time progressed, the solicitor became more tight-lipped.
Jimmie Frost regretted that Inspector Nott had arrived at the
girl's flat so promptly. He believed that if he had been allowed to
further question the solicitor he could have forced the truth. The
theory regarding "Cain" evolved by the Police Chief intrigued
Jimmie. He came to believe, as Sir Edmund did that some link
existed between "Cain" and the five men he had robbed.</p>

<p>Hour after hour through the nights, after the Commissioner had
taken his departure, the ex-detective pored over the police reports
left with him. Again and again, he read his notes on the series of
crimes committed by "Cain"&mdash;striving to find the hidden link
that bound them together. He knew it was there! He was confident of
that&mdash;but always it eluded him. "Cain" in his illegal
activities had robbed only five men; robbed them of many thousands
pounds. The fifth man of the group now lay on a sickbed.</p>

<p>What link bound those men and the super-crook? Jimmie Frost was
certain such a link existed&mdash;and that one day he would
discover it.</p>

<p>"Cain" had taken a large fortune from the five men&mdash;Pell,
Michaelstein, Symonds, Kilson and Banke. The men had all been
citizens of that city; they had all been rich men, engaged in
business. Sir Edmund believed they had all been
acquainted&mdash;that some, if not all, had been, intimates. Had
they also been business associates? Had they&mdash;all of
them&mdash;been engaged to a single business deal? If so, with
whom&mdash;or against whom?</p>

<p>If he could find an answer to those questions! If he could
discover some transaction in which they had all had a
part&mdash;some deal in which some individual had reason to believe
he had been defrauded!</p>

<p>With a sigh, Jimmie Frost thrust the papers from him. On present
knowledge the problem appeared insoluble. To gain success on those
lines meant that he would require a small army of helpers. He would
have to take the men one by one; examine every business deal they
had engaged in. It would be an endless task&mdash;the work of
years. Yet somewhere in the histories of the five men&mdash;and
Alec Kempton&mdash;lay the clue he sought. Four of them were dead,
the fifth was only a living corpse. If he died without speaking,
then only Alec Kempton remained&mdash;and he feared to speak.</p>

<p>Alec Kempton! He had been Luther Banke's solicitor for many
years. During which of those years had he and his client come in
contact with "Cain?" Certainly not of recent years. Jimmie Frost
believed that he would have to go back far beyond the last seven
years&mdash;the years of "Cain's" activities. Sir Edmund was
insistent that, sooner or later, "Cain" would strike at Alec
Kempton. Jimmie Frost believed that the solicitor held the same
opinion. When, and in what manner, the ex-detective could not
guess. He sighed; almost he wished the master-crook would act soon.
He was fretting on inaction&mdash;the wait for the next scene to be
staged.</p>

<p>Alec Kempton and Martha Tayne! Behind them "Cain" the criminal.
Two men and a woman! A whimsical smile came on the ex-detective's
lips. The eternal triangle! Had the age-old problem any part in
this tangle of crime he was seeking to unravel; this search on
which he had staked his career?</p>

<p>Late one afternoon, after hours of deep thought, Jimmie Frost
seized his hat and went down to Hunter Street, to watch Martha
Tayne leave the jewellery store and journey to Moorefield, on her
daily visit to Luther Banke. Time and again he had trailed her on
that journey, in the fast-fading hope that one day she would
deviate from her routine, and lead him to "Cain."</p>

<p>He wondered, would he return to his flat with the old story of
failure? Was he wise to stake so much time on this continued
tracking of the girl? Was he right in believing that, sooner or
later, "Cain" would again seek her?</p>

<p>When he arrived in the city he found the streets crowded with
workers hurrying home from shops and offices. In a doorway opposite
the jewellery store, the ex-detective took his usual stand, careful
that he, himself, was not under observation. Suddenly, he came
alert.</p>

<p>Someone beside himself was watching Luther Banke's store.</p>

<p>Three times a man had sauntered past where he stood, and each
time the man stared earnestly at the shop. Was this man "Cain?"
Jimmie Frost smiled. Was he to see "Cain" in every person who came
near the girl? Drawing more closely into cover, he scanned the
watcher. He could not be the master-crook. Neither in build not
appearance did he resemble the man so keenly sought. Almost exactly
before the doorway where Jimmie Frost lurked the man stopped,
staring up the street. For a few seconds he waited, then moved
slowly in the direction in which he had been looking. Jimmie Frost
came cautiously to the door, and looked after the man. The watcher
had met a friend and was in earnest conversation. A movement of the
pair showed the newcomer's features. He was Alec Kempton.</p>

<p>For several minutes Alec Kempton and the stranger conversed
earnestly, then parted, the solicitor coming in Jimmie Frost's
direction. One glance at the lawyer's face made the ex-detective
smile suddenly. He wondered, what had happened to so greatly
disturb the man?</p>

<p>The watcher stood for some moments where Alec Kempton had left
him, then slowly followed down the road, resuming his patrol before
the jewellery store. The actions of the men puzzled Jimmie Frost
Had the solicitor put this man to trail Martha Tayne, and if so,
for what reason?</p>

<p>The lights in the store were, one by one, extinguished, and
after a short Interval the main door opened and Martha Tayne came
out. As usual, she waited a few moments to speak with the
nightwatchman, then walked briskly up the street. Jimmie Frost hung
back. He knew where the girl was going, but for the moment he was
more interested in the man who was watching the jewellery store.
The man had crossed the road immediately Martha Tayne had appeared,
and now walked a few yards behind her.</p>

<p>The ex-detective followed up the road, keeping man and girl in
sight. At the tram-stop the watcher held back. He watched Martha
Tayne board a Moorefield tram, then turned back into Hunter Street.
Jimmie Frost shadowed the man. Opposite the jewellery store two men
were engaged in a very earnest discussion. The watcher stopped
beside them. Immediately the two men turned to him. A few sentences
were exchanged, then the three men turned up the street.</p>

<p>Pulling his hat well down over his eyes, the ex-detective
lounged against the wall of an hotel, and waited. The men were
walking slowly, the two outer men bending towards the centre man,
as if receiving instructions. At the end of the street they crossed
to the opposite pavement and returned to Luther Banke's store. A
lane ran down beside the store. The watcher went a few yards down
this lane, then returned to his companions. Again the three heads
came together, in consultation.</p>

<p>"Say, mister." A boy spoke at Jimmie Frost's elbow. "Your name
Frost?" At the ex-detective's nod he slipped a piece of paper in
Jimmie Frost's hand. "Bloke tol' me ter give yer this."</p>

<p>"Here!" Jimmie Frost caught the boy by the arm as he was running
off. "Where did you get this from?"</p>

<p>"Bloke gave it ter me to give yer," reiterated the boy.</p>

<p>"And he told you to slip away before I could ask questions."
Jimmie Frost laughed. "Well, you've slipped this time, sonny. Now,
who was the bloke?"</p>

<p>"Tall bloke," he answered, after a pause, and an attempt to slip
from the ex-detective's grasp. "Went down that way." He pointed
down the lane beside Luther Banke's store.</p>

<p>For the moment Jimmie Frost hesitated. He wanted to find the
man; he wanted to examine the note the boy had given him; and he
did not want the boy to escape.</p>

<p>"Look here, sonny," he said suddenly. "Do you want to earn a
couple of shillings?"</p>

<p>The boy's eyes sparkled, as he nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>"Very well." Jimmie Frost smiled at the youngster's sudden
earnestness. "Now keep this under your hat. I'm a detective, and
I'm claiming your help." He knew that he had caught the boy's
attention, and probable assistance. The lure of detection had
caught him. He would be on a "case" and also earning money.</p>

<p>Releasing his grip on the boy's arm, Jimmie Frost went to a lamp
and unfolded the paper. It contained only a single line of writing:
"Watch&mdash;but don't act until you hear from me."</p>

<p>Instinctively, the ex-detective's hand went to his
breast-pocket. From his wallet he took the card the crook had
slipped into his letter-box the night of the mystery at the flats.
One glance showed that they had been written by the same hand. On
the back of the card was written:</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Jimmie. We'll make a detective of you one day.
Await my next message&mdash;C."</p>

<p>Was this note&mdash;the folded paper the boy had brought
him&mdash;the message he had been warned to expect? That was
probable; but what did "Cain" mean? Why should be watch&mdash;and
not act?</p>

<p>He laughed, harshly. "Cain's" message was futile. He had every
intention of watching; what he would do depended on events.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">SOME instinct caused Jimmie Frost to glance across
the road. The men he had been watching were disappearing down the
lane beside the jewellery store. Beckoning the boy to follow him,
he crossed the road to the corner. The men seemed to be debating
some question heatedly, though in subdued voices. A short way down
the lane they grouped, and stopped. The ex-detective noted that
they had halted almost immediately under the windows of Martha
Tayne's office. The men were acting in a suspicious manner, and
would bear watching.</p>

<p>Yet Jimmie Frost felt a keen desire to follow the man who had
written the note. That the man was "Cain" he had little doubt. For
a moment he hesitated. The three men were intent on the jewellery
store, although to casual observation ignoring the building. To his
memory came a theory the Police Commissioner had evolved. Sir
Edmund held that Kempton had gone to Martha Tayne, at her flat, to
persuade her to hand him certain papers from Luther Banke's safe.
The girl had refused.</p>

<p>Now Jimmie Frost carried that theory further. He had watched the
men examining the store building with furtive care. He had seen the
man who was obviously the leader of the gang talking to Alec
Kempton. There was an obvious conclusion to these deductions. Yet
the solicitor was a man of excellent standing in the city. The
ex-detective looked down at the boy, who was watching him with
eager eyes, alert for orders. Should he leave him to watch the
three men, or tell him to scout round and try and find the man who
had given him the note?</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost would have gladly taken the latter task, but he did
not know what disguise the crook had assumed. The boy had tried to
describe the man, but his description would fit half a hundred men
on the streets. He dared not, himself, take the risk of failure in
that direction.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can find the man who gave you that note,
sonny?" he asked the boy, at length. Then, when the boy nodded,
though doubtfully, he added; "Well, have a shot at it. Here&mdash;"
He thrust some silver into the boy's hand. "You may want that if
you have to trail him far. Get on his trail and find out where he
lives."</p>

<p>"Where'll I find yer, mister?" The boy looked up eagerly. Jimmie
Frost scribbled his address on the back of an envelope. "When you
find out where that man lives, come back here. If I'm not here go
to that address and wait for me. Understand?" The boy nodded then
ran across the road, diving into the lane in the direction he had
indicated "Cain" had taken.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost watched him disappear from sight, smiling slightly.
He had sent the boy out on a slender chance. If "Cain" had been
watching him talking to the boy he would lead him a pretty dance
before losing him. That was a chance he had to take. The
ex-detective knew he had taken the only course in the
circumstances. His own job was to watch over the jewellery store.
His instinct told him that the main events of the night would
centre there.</p>

<p>A bundle of papers! A pity that Commissioner Morgan could not
remember more. Yet even that fragmentary memory was valuable.</p>

<p>Alec Kempton and a bundle of missing papers! Were those papers
in Luther Banke's safe? Did the jeweller know the value Alec
Kempton placed on them, and was he deliberately holding them? If
Sir Edmund was right in his theory and the strange actions of
"Cain" and Alec Kempton centred about those documents, then the
actions of the men he was watching were logical. Kempton had bribed
crooks to watch the store, find out the best means of ingress,
then...</p>

<p>One of the crooks had met Alec Kempton, apparently to report to
him; but that was before Martha Tayne had left the premises. He had
assured himself that the girl had finally left for the night then
returned to the store, where he had been joined by other men. All
three were acting most suspiciously. Jimmie Frost was certain that
his deductions were right. But if these men were high-class
cracksmen, then he should recognise them. Breaking into a store of
this nature, forcing a safe constructed to safeguard jewellery
worth many thousands pounds was not a job for amateurs. Even to get
into the store was far beyond the capability of an ordinary
thief.</p>

<p>But he had no recollection of any of these men, although he
prided himself on his knowledge of the leading crooks of the
country. The ex-detective was too wary to follow the men down the
little-used lane. He knew the men would not commence operations
until late at night, possibly not until the small hours of the
morning.</p>

<p>For some time Jimmie Frost strolled round the block, watching
carefully when he passed the two ends of the lane. Just as he was
completing his second circuit he realised that he was hungry; he
had not eaten since lunch. Turning on his heels, he went down the
street to a restaurant he had noted. During his meal the
ex-detective tried to plan his night's work. He had to watch the
jeweller's shop; he had to watch for the boy's return.</p>

<p>He frowned at the latter thought. If the boy came to the end of
the lane while he was away, then he would certainly go to the flat.
That would be awkward. How could he continue to watch the store and
also get in touch with the boy? Finishing his meal quickly, Jimmie
Frost strolled down to the lane-corner. There were no signs of the
boy; possibly he had not yet completed his mission. That was
hopeful. If the boy had lost "Cain's" trail he would have returned
to the lane, if only to report his failure.</p>

<p>Would he? He had given the boy money to pay his expenses.
Perhaps the boy had cleared off with the loot. Then he remembered
the clear light in the boy's eyes when he had asked for his
help&mdash;when he had announced that he was a detective on the
trail of a crook. That light answered for the boy's honesty. He
would come back, whether he was successful or not.</p>

<p>Time passed slowly, yet Jimmie found his spirits rising. The
watching was tiresome, for he had to keep himself as inconspicuous
as possible, and that In fast-emptying streets. Soon he would have
to abandon his patrol and find some obscure place from which to
carry on his watch. Again he glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>More than two hours had passed since the boy had left him. To
where had the chase led the lad? Jimmie Frost shrugged; he wondered
if he had been wise to send the boy after the man? If "Cain" had
sent him that note, then he would certainly remain near, to profit
by the failure of Kempton's plans.</p>

<p>The ex-detective found a corner from which he could keep watch
on the store and the lane without attracting attention. He turned
up the collar of his coat and looked at his watch. It was only a
few minutes after nine. Nothing was likely to happen before
midnight.</p>

<p>Where had the mission led the boy? Even if "Cain" had gone to
his "hideout" the lad could have marked the place and returned to
the city. Then came a sudden thought; had the boy returned while he
had been absent at his meal. If the boy had not found him in Hunter
Street, he would obey instructions and go on to the flat. Jimmie
Frost shrugged. The irony of it. In the old days, when he had been
a Detective-Inspector of police, none of these problems could have
obtruded. He would have found a telephone. In a few minutes half a
hundred men would have been at his command. The police had large
advantages over the lone worker!</p>

<p>He waited until the public clocks struck ten, then left his
watching place. He would go to his flat and see if the boy was
there. Almost immediately he reached the pavement, he shrank back
into the shadows. A man, whose form appeared familiar, was coming
down the street, towards him. He watched the man closely. Opposite
the jewellery store the man halted staring across the road. As he
turned to move on Jimmie Frost pulled his hat well over his eyes,
thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and lurched out on the
pavement, cannoning drunkenly into the man.</p>

<p>"What the&mdash;?" The man turned swiftly, but Jimmie Frost was
staggering down the street. He was amazed. The man was Alec
Kempton&mdash;and within the past couple of hours he had changed
into some sort of disguise. In place of his usual immaculate,
dandified attire he now wore a shabby, rough overcoat, and had a
rakish cap pulled far down over his eyes. A disguise!</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost laughed. So Kempton had to watch his crooks at
work! If only he could thoroughly commit the man; If he could link
him with the crooks he was employing, and have him arrested! Sir
Edmund would see that he talked&mdash;once he was in a prison cell.
If only he could act himself!</p>

<p>He swore under his breath as he staggered drunkenly down the
road. But now he had no power to arrest. All he could do was to
watch and, when he was certain a crime was being committed, obtain
the police. A thought came to him. If he found a constable and told
him a raid on the jeweller's shop was impending, the man would
telephone his station-house. But the patrolman might question how
he had obtained his knowledge; detain him until his sergeant
arrived. That way lay danger to himself and his plans.
Yet&mdash;Jimmie Frost laughed suddenly. There was a way. He
glanced behind him. Alec Kempton was leaning against a wall,
opposite Luther Banke's shop. What a fool! He was asking for
trouble; and he should have it in full measure. Where was a
telephone booth? He would ring up John Nott. The Inspector had a
grudge against Alec Kempton. He would be glad to have him in his
hands&mdash;to arrest him while he was watching a shop being
burgled! That would be a gift to the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Say, mister." A thin voice spoke at Jimmie Frost's elbow. He
looked down, breathing a sigh of relief. The boy had returned.</p>

<p>"Well, sonny; any luck?"</p>

<p>"Watched 'im inter a 'ouse." The boy spoke proudly.</p>

<p>"You did! Where?"</p>

<p>"Moorfield."</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost's heart sank. Had "Cain" again gone to Luther
Banke's home?</p>

<p>"What's the name of the house, sonny?" The ex-detective spoke
after a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"Ain't got one."</p>

<p>"Sure?"</p>

<p>"My oath! It wos a 'ouse all by itself, but it ain't gotter
name, only a number."</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost looked at the lad in some bewilderment. Luther
Banke's house had its name prominent at the gates; the boy could
not have missed It. Had the lad trailed "Cain" to his hide-out?
That was possible, but it would be incredible luck!</p>

<p>"Say, sonny." He caught the boy's shoulder in a friendly grip.
"I believe you're some detective. Where's the nearest telephone?
I've got to get a message to a friend; then you and I will go out
and have a look at that house. If you're right, well, you needn't
worry about not having shillings for the rest of your days."</p>

<p>"Gee!" The boy raised wondering eyes. "Did I track down a crook,
mister? Who's 'e?"</p>

<p>It was then Jimmie Frost, formerly Detective-Inspector Marx
Denvers, committed a grave breach of police discipline. He bent to
the boy's ear and whispered the name: "Cain."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">TEN minutes in a telephone booth and Jimmie Frost
rejoined his small assistant. John Nott had grasped at the
information offered him, hardly waiting to make any inquiries
regarding his informant. The ex-detective parried personal
questions easily, his knowledge of police procedure standing him in
good stead. On the pavement, he half-raised his hand to a cruising
taxi, then turned on his heels. A taxi would not serve his purpose
that night; he must have a car at his absolute disposal.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards from the telephone he found a "Drive
Yourself" hire garage. Five minutes later he and the boy were
travelling rapidly towards Moorfield.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost drove in silence, obsessed by his thoughts. Was
this night to see the end of his tedious hunt? Would he, before
morning, place his hand on "Cain's" shoulder, and terminate a lurid
career of crime? At Moorfield lived Luther Banke. What connection
was there between the jeweller and the mystery he was probing? Some
instinct told him that when he found the solution the jeweller
would be deeply involved. In what manner?</p>

<p>"Cain" had robbed Luther Banke. Yet, three times, at least, the
mystery crook had been in the jeweller's shop, and had stolen
nothing. Once, he had taken away the Montgomery emeralds&mdash;only
to restore them within a few hours. "Cain" had taken them from
Martha Tayne&mdash;he had returned them to the girl.</p>

<p>At the time of the theft of the emeralds, Jimmie Frost had
believed that "Cain" was in love with Martha Tayne; and because of
that had restored the emeralds. Now the ex-detective had revised
those views. "Cain" never acted without a purpose. But, what
purpose could he have in, again and again, visiting the jewellery
store, and each time leaving without loot? The crook had deceived
Martha Tayne, the girl who had spent her business life in close
touch with Luther Banke, with his impersonation of the jeweller. He
could just as easily have deceived the shop assistants. Had he
coveted any gem in the store, he had only to ask for it, and it
would have been handed to him without question. He had to believe
that behind all "Cain's" seemingly inconsequent actions lay some
deep purpose he had not vet even guessed at.</p>

<p>Perhaps that night's work might give him the clue he sought. For
the moment he was trailing along in the wake of the super-crook. If
he could discover the man's objective, get some hint of the methods
he was employing, then he could anticipate him&mdash;frame a trap
into which to lure him. Now they were in Moorfield, close to the
house where Luther Banke lay, helpless and dying. Jimmie Frost let
the car slow, and turned to his companion. "What's your name,
sonny?"</p>

<p>"George."</p>

<p>"Well, George; you take command now. You followed the man out
here; where did he go?"</p>

<p>"Next tram-stop, mister. Slow there, and I'll 'op orf."</p>

<p>The ex-detective slowed the car to a crawl. George opened the
car-door and sprang out, darting up a by-road, waving for the car
to follow him. With slight surprise Jimmie Frost recognised that
the boy was making for Luther Banke's house.</p>

<p>As he passed "Rosewood" Jimmie Frost slowed the car again,
almost coming to a halt. The house was in darkness, the only room
lit being the one over the porch-peak. The ex-detective smiled
ruefully. That room was connected with his inglorious adventure,
when "Cain" had cast him into the hands of the police, a "drunk and
disorderly." The boy paused at the corner of a road turning off to
the right, some fifty yards past Luther Banke's house.</p>

<p>Jimmie followed the boy until he saw him turn in at a gate, with
a signal wave of his hand. Jimmie Frost found a place where he
could park the car, some distance down the road, and walked slowly
back to the gates through which the boy had disappeared. Waiting
until he was certain he was unobserved, he followed the boy. A low
whistle from a clump of bushes located his helper.</p>

<p>"You stay there, George," he ordered. "Watch those gates. If
anyone enters, whistle. Then get for your life."</p>

<p>"Where'll you be?" George looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"You know where to find me." Jimmie Frost smiled at the lad's
ardour. "Like the game, sonny?"</p>

<p>"Gee! It's great!" The thin face was raised to the ex-detective
almost adoringly. "I'm going to be a detective one day&mdash;a 'tec
like that bloke, Denvers. He's a one! Chased 'Cain' all over th'
place an' all but got 'im, once."</p>

<p>"And got kicked out of the department for not getting him!" The
ex-detective's mouth twisted wryly; yet a flush of pleasure swept
on him at the guileless praise.</p>

<p>"Gosh! Why that's only joshing!" George was openly contemptuous.
"Kick 'im outer th' force! They wouldn't do that. He's th' best
'busy' they've got."</p>

<p>"But they did."</p>

<p>"Kid-stakes!" George laughed shrilly. "An' you a 'tec, talkin'
in that slush? Why, that's fer 'Cain.' You mark me
words&mdash;Denver'll collar 'Cain.' He'll turn up agen soon wi'
'is 'and on 'is collar."</p>

<p>For a moment Jimmie Frost stared down at the lad, then laughed.
So that was the result of Sir Edmund's skilfully laid plans; a
child&mdash;a boy of barely fourteen years&mdash;had exposed them
in a few words. He wondered if others had followed the same line of
reasoning. Had "Cain" for instance, believed that his resignation
from the department was but a move in a deep strategic game?</p>

<p>Leaving the boy to watch the gates, Jimmie Frost walked up the
driveway. Some fifty feet from the gates he came in sight of the
house. It was apparently unoccupied. He retraced his steps to the
road and looked for agents' boards. There were none. He turned to
the house again.</p>

<p>Very cautiously he circled the house. Not a light showed in a
window. Had not George been so certain, so insistent, he would have
believed the place deserted. But the boy was certain he had seen
"Cain" enter the place. George told a straight, circumstantial
story; he had led back to the house without hesitation or doubt. If
"Cain" was in that house, then he was taking precautions that no
one should suspect his presence there. Jimmie Frost satisfied
himself that there was no rear exit, then returned to the main
gates and whistled softly. In a moment George came out of the
bushes.</p>

<p>"Know this district, George?" Then, when the boy nodded, the
ex-detective continued: "Get me some information about this house;
who owns it; who last lived here, and&mdash;" He laughed shortly.
"Here's your chance to prove yourself a detective. I want the
history of this house and the people who lived here. If I've left
here by the time you get back, go to my flat." He paused and then
added; "Say, sonny; it's getting late. What will your people say to
you being out until this hour?"</p>

<p>"Ain't got no people."</p>

<p>"No parents? Then where do you live?"</p>

<p>"Live anywhere. Sell papers. Get a doss when I've got
splosh."</p>

<p>"Got a doss for tonight?" Jimmie Frost asked, Then, hurriedly:
"No. you haven't! Here&mdash;" He pulled out his latch-key.</p>

<p>"Here! Take this. I'm sure to be late. Go to my flat. There's
grub in the kitchen. Help yourself to all you want; then get a rug
and curl up on the sofa. I'll make you up a bed when I get home.
Now&mdash;scoot!"</p>

<p>He watched the boy run down the road in the direction of the
tram-stop. Something was tugging at his heartstrings&mdash;a pain
that had been there for days. He had wanted "something"&mdash;and
had not known what that something was. Now he knew! He had been
lonely&mdash;sick for companionship. George was a decent kid. A
slight smile came on the ex-detective's lips as he remembered the
boy's words. He seemed honest&mdash;if he was not, he could be
taught to be so. From appearances, he seemed to keep himself fairly
clean&mdash;and any deficiencies could be rectified with the
abundant supplies of hot water and soap at the flat. He began to
feel quite paternal towards this waif of the streets, who, with a
few unconscious words had given him a new faith in himself.</p>

<p>"Denvers was a great 'tec!"</p>

<p>He squared his shoulders. Well, he'd show the boy! He turned to
the apparently deserted house again. Somehow he would get inside it
before he left it that night, and search the place with scrupulous
care. His hand went to his hip-pocket to feel the comforting
coldness of his gun.</p>

<p>George had declared that "Cain" had entered that house. Was the
master-crook still there? If he were, then Jimmie Frost smiled when
he again remembered the ruse by means of which "Cain" had disposed
of him when he found him spying on Luther Banke's house. He could
play the same trick on "Cain."</p>

<p>If he could find the master-crook, he would bind and gag him. A
cryptic message to the police would result in the house being
searched and the mystery crook found. He would be held, pending
investigations of the message Jimmie Frost intended to leave with
him. A word with the Police Commissioner in the morning, and the
long trail would have ended&mdash;triumphantly.</p>

<p>The house before him was very similar to the one in which Luther
Banke lived. It had only two storeys. Covering the wide veranda
before the house was a red-tiled roof. The main roof of the house
was also of red tiles, and sloped steeply. The walls were roughcast
and the woodwork painted green. That much Jimmie Frost could see by
the light of a three-quarter moon.</p>

<p>He was standing on the edge of a gravel path that led from the
main drive to the rear of the house, wondering where to make his
burglarious entry of the premises, when he heard steps on the
drive.</p>

<p>Silently he slipped behind some bushes, close to the steps
leading up to the front door. The steps came nearer. Through the
screen of bushes he saw a man and woman approaching. They were
walking slowly, engrossed in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>Gradually their forms appeared plain in the moon-light. They
came to the steps and halted a moment. The man dug into his pocket
and produced a key, making some low-voiced remark at which the
woman laughed gently. She followed the man up the steps. Jimmie
Frost almost betrayed himself in his astonishment. The girl was
Martha Tayne. Shifting round in the bushes, at the risk of rustling
leaves betraying his presence, he stared at the man at the
door.</p>

<p>Who was he? Surely not "Cain." The man opened the front door and
entered the house; the girl remaining on the door-step. Presently a
light shone in the hall. A man's shadow came into the light,
beckoning to the girl. Jimmie Frost cursed under his breath. He
dared not move, to try and get a clear view of the man. But, could
he mistake that form; that peculiar twist of the head, when
speaking? As the girl entered the hall, the man half-turned. For
the moment light streaked his face. Now the ex-detective was
certain! That man was "Cain" in his disguise of Joyce Poynter.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">MARTHA TAYNE and Joyce Poynter had entered the
empty house! For minutes Jimmie Frost watched patiently, very
perplexed and somewhat angry. Why had the girl accompanied the man?
He was sure they were alone in the house. From outside appearances,
the place had not been lived in for some considerable time. Yet the
two had entered the house as if long familiar with it; as if they
were at home in its drear darkness.</p>

<p>Again he circled the house. Not one ray of light shone from any
window or, now, even the hall. He came again to the gardens before
the house. So far, he had seen nothing further to excite his
suspicions. Yet he was certain the house held a secret.</p>

<p>Again he examined the exterior of the house, seeking an easy,
noiseless entry. He must get into the house and discover why the
man and girl had come there. He must find out if Joyce Poynter was
"Cain" in one of his many disguises. If he was, then&mdash;Jimmie
Frost smiled. He had confidence in himself&mdash;if he could get
the girl away, leaving the man alone. He must get into that
house&mdash;and he must induce the girl to leave, alone.</p>

<p>Again he scanned the exterior of the house. At length he decided
on a small window on the left-hand side wall, as his means of
entry. He believed it opened into a pantry. If so, that would be
ideal for his purpose. The window opened under the urge of his
jemmy; the lock snapping with what seemed, in the silences of the
night, to be a loud report.</p>

<p>The ex-detective waited. Had the people in the house heard the
noise; would the man come to investigate? Five minutes later he
again approached the window, torch in hand, and pushed it open. As
he had guessed the window lighted the butler's pantry. Two minutes
later he stood in the room, the window closed. The door of the room
was ajar. Holding his torch ready, he moved slowly forward, his
torch shut off, relying on his sense of touch as guide. He knew he
was in a passage; but to what part of the house did it lead?</p>

<p>For about twenty paces he groped forward in darkness; then
stopped and listened. There was not a sound in the house. Where
were the man and girl? As if in answer to the unvoiced question,
came the sounds of the girl's laughter. Again Jimmie Frost waited.
Then, almost covering the lens of his torch with his fingers, he
pressed the switch. The light showed that he was standing at the
end of a passage facing a wall, with a baize-covered door on his
left. The door swung noiselessly on well-oiled hinges. Jimmie Frost
moved slowly forward, passing into another passage. Again he-waited
and listened, before using his light. He was now standing almost at
the foot of a flight of stairs. Before him was a door. He believed
it opened into one of the rooms in the front of the house. On
either side of him were walls. He switched off his light and peered
about. Now he saw a light under a door on his right. That room
would overlook the gardens at the rear of the house.</p>

<p>If Martha Tayne and "Cain" were in that room, why had no light
shone out of the window? No ordinary blind, or curtain, could give
that dead blackness to the windows he had seen when circling the
house. A few moment's consideration and he understood. This was
"Cain's" house. It was reputed to be unoccupied&mdash;but "Cain"
occupied it. He had allowed it to assume its present forlorn
forsaken appearance to deceive the neighbours and inquisitive.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost allowed his light to play freely about the hall for
a few seconds. He found sufficient evidence to believe the interior
to be well-kept and richly furnished. Then the windows of the house
must be hermetically sealed, preventing the faintest gleam of light
showing outside. Stealthily, Jimmie Frost approached the door under
which he had observed the light. He pressed his ear to a panel but
could only hear a soft murmur of voices. If only he could overhear
this conversation; if he could even hear enough to prove to him
that he was right, and this man who posed as Joyce Poynter was
"Cain," then the master-crook would not again escape him.</p>

<p>He knew that his task would not end with his capture of "Cain's"
person. Then his work would enter a new phase. He would have to
prove that he was "Cain."; he would have to prove beyond doubt that
he had committed the crimes with which he was charged. "Cain" would
fight to the bitter end, using every artifice his clever brain
could conceive to prevent conviction. Jimmie Frost fully realised
the big task before him. At no time during the seven years he had
been on the master-crook's trail had he acquired any direct
evidence against the man. Nowhere had he left a single
finger-print; no one was willing to try and identify the man; all
descriptions of the remarkable criminal differed materially. Yet
scattered through the city were the results of the man's crimes;
and against him only assumptions of guilt.</p>

<p>For long minutes Jimmie Frost remained at the door, trying to
overhear some part of the conversation proceeding within the room.
Occasionally he could catch a few words, but nothing he heard had
definite meaning. Exasperated, he returned to the butler's pantry.
In the passage outside the pantry he let the light of his torch
play around. He knew he was safe from observation in the offices of
the house. He believed there was no one in the house but the two
persons in the lighted room he had just left. He looked about him.
The passage contained many doors. He went to the end of the passage
and opened a door. Now he found himself in the kitchens. From the
main kitchen a door opened directly into the gardens. Unlocking the
door quietly, he passed out on to the path.</p>

<p>A quick look around, and he went along the wall until he came to
a window he believed belonged to the room at the moment occupied by
Martha Tayne and Joyce Poynter. The window was high above the
garden path. Jimmie Frost swept his torch light around, looking for
something he could stand on to lift him to window level. He could
find nothing. He went back to the kitchen and fetched a chair.</p>

<p>Standing on it he could press his ear against the glass. Again
he could hear voices in the room. He could hear the man's deep
tones; he could hear Martha Tayne's soft laughter; but he could not
make comprehensible sentences of what he could hear.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost muttered angrily under his breath as he carried the
chair back to the kitchen. Almost he decided on one bold stroke; to
force his way into the room where the two sat and challenge the
man, as "Cain." If he did that; if he could take him prisoner,
bluff the girl into acquiescence, a search of the house might
provide the evidence he had to have.</p>

<p>Second, and quieter, thoughts prevailed. He dared not risk all
he had gained in one impulsive move. He must wait&mdash;time and
patience were on his side. Suddenly he stiffened, turning to the
window.</p>

<p>Someone&mdash;no, some vehicle, was approaching the house,
driving up the gravelled path.</p>

<p>He slipped through the kitchen door, closing it carefully behind
him, and went to the front of the house. An ambulance van was drawn
up before the front door, and two uniformed men were mounting the
steps to the veranda. What was to happen? Jimmie Frost watched, his
mind filled with perplexities.</p>

<p>The men acted methodically, as if engaged in routine business.
He heard the doorbell sound within the house. An interval, and the
street door opened a stream of light dispelling the darkness of the
veranda. Then came voices; one voice spoke to a "doctor."</p>

<p>Who were these men? Why had the ambulance come to that house?
The ex-detective craned forward eagerly. A third man appeared,
coming down from the veranda and going to the door of the
ambulance. He flashed the light of a powerful torch into the van.
Two attendants drew a stretcher from the van. On it lay a long,
still form, completely covered by a white sheet. The man with the
torch went to the house, allowing the light to rest on the steps.
Slowly and carefully the attendants bore the stretcher past the man
with the torch, up the steps and into the house. The torch-bearer
followed them. As he mounted the steps he raised the beam of his
light. It rested on the form of a man standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>The man was Joyce Poynter. Was Joyce Poynter the man the
ambulance foreman had called "doctor?" They were talking together
now. Risking discovery, Jimmie Frost crept nearer. Again the
foreman raised his voice, calling the man "doctor." They passed
into the house and the door closed. Who was the patient the
ambulance had brought to the house? Why had the ambulance man
called Joyce Poynter "doctor?"</p>

<p>The ex-detective could find no answer to the questions. The
affair was bewildering, and made Jimmie Frost still more determined
to get into the house and find answers to his problems. He waited
in his concealment a few more minutes then, as nothing further
happened, started on his journey to the kitchen door. Suddenly he
stopped, pressing himself flat against the ground.</p>

<p>Someone was coming up the drive from the road gates. A few
moments and Jimmie Frost recognised the step. He was puzzled but
certain that his ears had not deceived him. He had heard that step
a few nights previous; he recognised the quaint slither of the
walking-stick on the gravel. Yet he almost doubted himself.</p>

<p>A figure loomed through the night-lights, becoming more plain as
it approached where Jimmie Frost crouched. Leaning heavily on the
walking-stick, the tall, erect figure came to the steps and mounted
to the veranda. Hardly had the bell sounded when the hall-door
opened. The light from the hall illuminated the newcomer. He was
Sir Edmund Morgan, Commissioner of Police. As the ex-detective
watched, he passed into the house and the door closed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">IMMEDIATELY the door was shut behind Sir Edmund,
Jimmie Frost came out from his concealment. For a long time he
stared at the house, a puzzled frown on his face. Every happening
that night had served to deepen, not clarify, the mysteries he was
probing. Why had Martha Tayne and Joyce Poynter come to that house?
True, he believed the house belonged to the man, if indeed he was
"Cain." That might account for the man's presence, but why was the
girl there? What connection could she have with the crook?</p>

<p>When he had visited her at Luther Banke's store, he had been
convinced of her honesty, and her loyalty to her employer. For what
reason had Sir Edmund Morgan come to that house? What did he know
of the place and its inhabitants? Had he expected to meet Martha
Tayne and Joyce Poynter there&mdash;or had he expected to find
"Cain?"</p>

<p>The ex-detective put the thought from him; he was suspecting the
Police Chief of disloyalty to the department. To his perplexities
he had to add the person he had seen carried into that house on the
stretcher. Who was the invalid? For the moment he considered
whether the invalid had been "Cain." He rejected the idea,
immediately. There could be no possible need for "Cain" to adopt
such a subterfuge to gain his own house. The place was not under
police suspicion; never during the seven years of the
master-crook's career had the police been that close on his trail.
Had the invalid on the stretcher been a genuine medical case?</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost shrugged. Before he left that house he would know
the answer to that question. He turned towards the house. For the
present he would not speculate. He had to search and watch. Later,
when he was at home, smoking a last pipe before turning in for the
night, he would try and co-ordinate these problems, and any new
discoveries, into a logical story.</p>

<p>He found the kitchen as he had left it. Moving cautiously, he
went up the passage to the hall, first making sure no one was in
the offices. For a few minutes he lingered before the door of the
room he called "Cain's study." He could hear voices in the room
but, again, could only distinguish an occasional word. He believed
he could identify a new voice&mdash;one deeper in tone than Joyce
Poynter's, but was not certain.</p>

<p>A long wait, listening at the door, and he was confident the
people in the room would not come out of it for some time, unless
disturbed. Then he started a silent, systematic survey of the rooms
on the ground floor. They were well, and completely furnished, and
showed signs of recent use. The only strange thing about them was
that every window was closely sealed with thick felt. He returned
to the hall and went to the stairs. Something might be discovered
in the upper storey.</p>

<p>Halting on the bottom tread, he made a mental picture of the
house. If "Cain" alone occupied it, then the room where the people
were gathered must be his sitting-room. There, it was probable, he
kept his papers&mdash;the documents Jimmie Frost so ardently
desired to examine; the evidence that might put the master-crook
behind prison bars. Yet, even "Cain" must sleep. It was improbable
that "Cain" would make his bed in his sitting-room; and Jimmie
Frost had not found a bedroom on the ground floor.</p>

<p>The ex-detective made his way up the stairs. On the upper
storey, he found himself in a corridor running the width of the
house. At the ends of the corridor were tall windows. They were
carefully blanketed with felt, similar to the windows downstairs.
He let his light slide along the walls of the corridor.</p>

<p>On the front of the house were four doors; on the opposite side
were two doors and a short corridor. The corridor was over the
domestic offices. He switched off his torch&mdash;to immediately
see rays of light coming under a door opposite the head of the
stairs.</p>

<p>Then the person the ambulance had brought to the house had been
a real invalid, and had been placed in this upstairs room. Jimmie
Frost set his ear against a panel of the door. He could hear
someone moving about the room. For a moment he was perplexed; then
grinned broadly. Of course there was someone attending the invalid.
The person moving about the room must be the nurse. But how had she
come to the house? Had she been there before the man and girl
arrived?</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost believed he had seen everyone who had entered the
house after them. A small sound made him turn swiftly. Immediately
he noticed that a light was shining under a door almost opposite
the first lighted room. Cautiously the ex-detective went to the
door. Again he listened. He could hear someone moving within the
room. Then two of the bedrooms were occupied! In which of these
rooms lay the invalid?</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost let the light of his torch play along the length of
the corridor. Both ends were fitted as lounges. A second's
deliberation and he chose the corridor end furthest from the second
lighted room. There, he was sure, he could remain unobserved,
unless the corridor was searched. A little re-arrangement of the
furniture and he made himself comfortable for a long wait. He felt
safe, for he realised that this was not a house of light; in fact,
this corridor had probably not been lighted for some considerable
time.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. Barely had he concluded his
arrangements, when the door of the second lighted room opened.
Jimmie Frost craned forward, but the light in the room was switched
off before the occupant left the room. He only saw a man's form
emerge. The man went to the stairs. The ex-detective followed,
arriving at the head of the stairs to see light flash from the
study, as the door was opened.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost went to the room from which the man had emerged.
Listening at the panel for a moment, he opened the door. A flash
from his torch located the light-switch. He turned and closed the
door. The room was a bedchamber, well-furnished, and evidently
occupied by a man. Swiftly, and with expert precision, the
ex-detective searched the room. The first suspicious thing he found
was a large and well-equipped make-up box in a corner of the
wardrobe. A few minutes later, on top of the wardrobe, he found a
series of boxes, containing wigs and other hirsute make-up aids.
Yet these might belong to an innocent person with amateur
theatrical proclivities.</p>

<p>The room baffled him. Jimmie Frost stood before the
dressing-table, sombrely surveying the room. Was there no clue here
to what he sought? A piece of white paper lay half-hidden by the
bed. Jimmie Frost pounced upon it eagerly. On it was a series of
figures. The paper held only the figures. The ex-detective folded
the paper and placed it in his wallet. Perhaps, somewhere in the
house might be something to connect with it. Switching off the
light, he left the room and went into the corridor.</p>

<p>As he passed the lighted room opposite the head of the stairs,
he listened again at the door. For seconds he could hear no sounds
within the room, then a chair creaked. The nurse&mdash;if there
were a nurse&mdash;was still in the room. Jimmie Frost turned from
the door, then hesitated. He must know who the invalid was; and he
could not afford to wait until the nurse came out of her own
accord. She might not move from the room until morning. In some way
he must shift her.</p>

<p>For some minutes he stood meditating. He must get the nurse from
the room long enough for him to make an examination of it and the
patient. But how? A little smile came on his lips, then he laughed
suddenly. If the nurse was a stranger to the house, there might be
a way. He might be able to frighten her away. For a moment he
thought his idea absurd, but decided to give it a trial. He let his
light play along the corridor. There was no furniture between the
door and his hide-out to impede him. The floor was thickly
carpeted, and his quick steps would make no sounds. Turning to the
door, he rapped on a panel thrice, slowly and distinctly&mdash;then
ran for his hiding-place.</p>

<p>Hardly had he reached safety when the door opened, and a woman
came out on the corridor. For a moment she stood undecided, as if
astonished to find no one there. She peered along the corridor in
both directions, then went to the head of the stairs and peered
down on the hall below. Finally she shrugged, and returned to the
sick room. Hardly had the woman shut the door, when Jimmie Frost
was on his feet.</p>

<p>Allowing her time to settle again in her chair, he knocked
again; thrice, slowly and solemnly. Again he hid. There was an
appreciable interval before the door opened. The woman's head came
into view, scanning the corridor. Then the head was withdrawn and
the door roughly shut. The ex-detective thought he heard the key
turn in the lock. So far, good! But Jimmie Frost wished the woman
to vacate the room, not lock herself within it. He went to the door
again.</p>

<p>Placing his mouth against the key-hole, he moaned, throwing into
his voice all the ghostly eeriness he could command, at the same
time knocking solemnly. Almost before the ex-detective could get
from before the door, it was flung open and the nurse ran to the
stairs, and down them, screaming.</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost ran into the room, closing the door behind him. A
quick glance showed him the bed. He strode to it&mdash;and looked
down on the bearded face of Luther Banke.</p>

<p>A gasp escaped his lips. So Luther Banke was the invalid who had
been brought to that house! Luther Banke was in the power of
"Cain." For almost a minute Jimmie Frost stood beside the bed,
absolutely bewildered. Those seconds almost cost him all the work
he had accomplished that night. He heard voices raised on the floor
below; running footsteps sounded on the stairs. He sprang to the
door and turned the key in the lock. For the moment he was safe;
but how could he escape from that room?</p>

<p>There was no hiding place in it. When they battered down the
door he would be "Jimmie Frost," international crook and murderer,
escapee from Sing Sing-prison, wanted by the police in his own
city. He must escape, and suspicion must not rest on him. In some
manner he must incriminate the nurse; persuade those with her to
believe her the victim of hallucinations. But, how could the locked
door be avoided? Very cautiously, he withdrew the key from the
lock, then went to the windows.</p>

<p>The felt cut easily, and the lower sash lifted. The door was
quivering under the thrust of powerful shoulders. Jimmie Frost went
to the door and carefully slid the key under it, into the corridor.
Then he returned to the window and pulled close the heavy velvet
curtains draping it. Before anyone would think to look behind them,
and see the cut felt, he would have made good his escape.</p>

<p>On the veranda-roof he waited, his ear pressed against the
window. He heard the door give with a sudden crash, and people
storm into the room. Then he slid down to the gutter, and dropped
to the drive. His one thought was that he must get into the house
again, as quickly as possible. While the occupants were upstairs,
searching and wondering over the nurse's fright, was his
opportunity to examine "Cain's" sitting-room.</p>

<p>Silent as the shadows he moved among, he went round the corner
of the house in the direction of the kitchens. Just as he came in
sight of the back door, he saw it slowly open. He drew back into
the shadows. A man came out of the door and advanced to where
Jimmie Frost stood. The ex-detective waited until the man was a
bare couple of yards from him, then pointed the torch at the man's
face and pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>With a shout that was almost a scream of unreasoning terror,
Jimmie Frost dropped his torch, turned and ran. Automatically, his
legs carried him out of the grounds of that house of mystery on to
the suburban road where his car was parked. Presently he stopped,
his brow wet with cold perspiration, every nerve of his body
tingling and trembling. What had he seen? He tried to review the
past minutes logically; but his nerves quivered at the memory. In
the strong light of his powerful torch he had seen before him
Luther Banke; the man he had seen a few moments before stretched on
a bed in the room upstairs, a helpless, living corpse.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">THROUGH the remaining days of his life Jimmie
Frost was never able to recall that night-drive home without a
shudder. Forcing his quivering nerves to obey his will, he drove
the rented car to the garage, then travelled home on a tram. In his
sitting-room he went direct to the sideboard and poured out half a
tumbler of whisky, adding but a dash of soda. He drank it at a
gulp, then filled the tumbler again, this time with a weaker
solution. He turned, and with a little laugh, nodded to George,
sitting up on the sofa, watching him gravely.</p>

<p>"Well, son? Had a good sleep? Did you get that information?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded. "Got a lot, mister." He paused a moment,
watching the ex-detective. "Say, wot's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Why do you think anything is wrong?" Jimmie Frost was
startled.</p>

<p>"Look at yer face." George pointed to the mirror. "Yer as white
as a sheet an' all shakin'."</p>

<p>"Ever seen a ghost, George?" The ex-detective braced himself,
and added quickly: "Well, what about that house?"</p>

<p>"Feller named Ulman lived there last&mdash;queer sorter bloke.
Lived all by 'is-self. 'Ad a son as went ter th' war an' got shot,
or lost or sumthlnk like that. 'Ouse bin shut up fer quite a while.
That's all."</p>

<p>For some time Jimmie Frost considered the information. It did
not fit in with what he knew. He shrugged impatiently. He would go
to bed and leave his problems for a clearer morning brain.</p>

<p>Daylight brought him no nearer a solution. The old problems
remained, intermingled with the new. Things that appeared nearer
solution the previous evening now appeared insoluble. George had
adopted the flat.</p>

<p>Soon after eight o'clock in the morning he came to Jimmie
Frost's bedside carrying morning tea on a tray, with the
newspapers. The ex-detective seized the papers eagerly. Only an
inconspicuous paragraph noted an attempted robbery at Luther
Banke's jewellery store the previous night. The thieves had been
apprehended before they had done more than break into the shop.
There was nothing, in the newspapers concerning Alec Kempton.</p>

<p>Had not John Nott acted on the hint he had given him the
previous evening and incriminated the solicitor with the thieves?
Apparently not. He threw the papers from him, in disgust. Where
should he go that morning? Where pick up again the trail he had
certainly lost at Moorfield. He turned from the breakfast table,
and scanned the boy.</p>

<p>"Stand up, George." Jimmie Frost spoke suddenly. The boy obeyed.
"Hm! Can't have you like that. New suit, and all the etceteras.
Bed, too. What are you going to do, George?"</p>

<p>"Get th' midday papers, mister. Nuthink in th' game afore th'
afternoon,"</p>

<p>"So!" Jimmie laughed. "What about school?"</p>

<p>"Finished school, mister."</p>

<p>"Know all they can teach you?"</p>

<p>The boy shrugged. "Gotter work."</p>

<p>"Like to stay here&mdash;with me?"</p>

<p>"An' be a 'tec?" The boy's face lighted. "Mean it, mister?"</p>

<p>"Right!" Jimmie Frost reached for his hat. He looked down on the
boy, whose face was aglow. "But you'll have to grow, y'know. They
don't take shrimps into the Police Force."</p>

<p>"I'll grow." The boy flexed his muscles. "An' I ain't 'arf
strong."</p>

<p>"They want something more than strength." The ex-detective spoke
seriously, pride in his profession in his voice. "You have to have
brains, and learn to use them."</p>

<p>For the moment the boy looked downcast, then he looked up.
"Straight?" he asked.</p>

<p>Jimmie nodded.</p>

<p>"Then it's gotter be did." George' spoke seriously. "Yer means
school?"</p>

<p>Again Jimmie Frost nodded, smiling at the boy's resolution, then
turned to the door.</p>

<p>As the morning passed he began to regain his spirits. The
youngster developed wonderfully. Dressed in the new clothes, he
looked taller and bulkier. Jimmie Frost began to wonder. Had he
found a new and valuable recruit for the Department? Certainly the
boy had brains, and could use them. If he trained him&mdash;brought
his quest to a successful issue by capturing "Cain"&mdash;He would
regain his old standing in the Police Department, and more; for he
had not forgotten Sir Edmund's words. He would be due for a step in
rank. If Sir Edmund retired, as he had hinted might happen, he
might succeed Superintendent Lorrimer as head of the detective
branch.</p>

<p>He looked down at his companion. He could train this boy. He
believed George had the makings of a fine man in him. During his
youth he could instil in the youngster the essentials of routine
police work the ambitious recruit found it so tedious to
master.</p>

<p>The man and boy arrived back at the flat shortly after midday.
Again Jimmie Frost settled himself to serious consideration of his
problems. Where should he make a fresh start in his quest for
"Cain?" Automatically, his thoughts turned to the house at
Moorfield he believed to be the master-crook's headquarters. It was
improbable he would find "Cain" there now, but the place would
certainly repay careful investigation. A ring came at the outer
door of the flat, and George answered it. Jimmie Frost bent to his
notes. Presently he looked up, to see a tall man standing on the
threshold of the room surveying his quizzically.</p>

<p>"Inspector Nott!" The ex-detective rose to his feet, speaking
formally. "John Nott, you old scaramouch!"</p>

<p>The detective strode forward, holding out his hand. "Thought
you'd get away, did you, Mark Denvers? I had my doubts the other
night, but now&mdash;" Again he shook hands vigorously. "Now I
know."</p>

<p>He stood back, scanning his old comrade. "Lord, man, I shouldn't
have recognised you in that get-up. To think that Mark
Denvers&mdash;"</p>

<p>A tug at his elbow made him pause and look down at George,
standing beside him, looking at Jimmie Frost with curiosity and
awe. "Say, mister!" The boy's hand on John Nott's sleeve was
pleading. "Is 'e Mister Denvers, th' great 'tec?"</p>

<p>"So! Who are you?" John Nott smiled. "What have you been up to
Mark&mdash;kidnapping?"</p>

<p>"My right-hand man." Jimmie Frost laid an affectionate hand on
the boy's shoulder. "This young man is going to be a detective,
like you and I&mdash;was." He uttered the last word almost as an
afterthought.</p>

<p>"Now John Nott, how did you track me here?"</p>

<p>"No credit to me, boy." The big detective laughed. "The Chief
sent me here."</p>

<p>"Sir Edmund?"</p>

<p>"He thought you might like to hear the details&mdash;of last
night's raid, y'know. I'm beginning to suspect that the man who
telephoned me was you."</p>

<p>"There wasn't much on the subject in the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Sir Edmund saw to that. But we made quite a clean-up, with
Lawyer Alec Kempton in the star role."</p>

<p>"Then you got him?"</p>

<p>"Caught him with his three pals. Seems he couldn't trust them to
bring him what he wanted, so he went in to watch them open the
safe. We had got rid of the watchman, didn't want him damaged. We
let them right in, and get ready to work on the safe. Gosh! It was
easy!" He paused, then continued; "One-queer thing happened, Mark.
Just as we got the gang nicely rounded up, I happened to glance at
one of the windows. Lord, I got a shock! I thought I saw Luther
Banke staring in on us; and he looked as if he'd just risen from
the grave."</p>

<p>"Has Alec Kempton talked?" Jimmie Frost asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Not yet." The tall detective paused a moment. "Look here,
Mark," he continued. "I don't know what you and the Chief have
framed up. I do know there's something on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You saw my resignation in the <i>Gazette</i>?" interrupted
Jimmie Frost.</p>

<p>"Your what?" John Nott looked dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"I handed my resignation to Sir Edmund at his request." Jimmie
Frost spoke slowly. "I understood a notification of my resignation
would appear in the next <i>Gazette</i>."</p>

<p>"Then the old man lost it." John Nott laughed. "Cunning old fox,
Sir Edmund. Wonder what was in his mind?"</p>

<p>"He told you to come and see me today?" Jimmie Frost was
puzzled. "I wonder why? Did he give you a message for me?"</p>

<p>"Only that you should watch the telephone." The tall detective
glanced about the room inquisitively.</p>

<p>"You've got a telephone? So! Well, well! Perhaps he'll give you
a ring."</p>

<p>Jimmie Frost did not reply. He wondered why Sir Edmund had sent
John Nott to him; why he had not published his resignation from the
police department in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. He knew that
the police Commissioner was a strategist of no mean order, moving
and using the men under his command as a master-chess player uses
the pieces on the chequered board. His brain worked in devious ways
rarely giving any clue to his objective until he was assured of his
success.</p>

<p>Only two facts stood clear in the bewildering maze of perplexing
details. One was that Sir Edmund had chosen to betray the carefully
guarded secret of his underworld disguise to John Nott, sending him
to him with orders to remain in his company until after a stated
time. In what capacity? As guard or gaoler?</p>

<p>The second fact was equally perplexing. Sir Edmund had bidden
John Nott to warn him to watch the telephone. For what reason? The
telephone was not connected with the public exchange. It
communicated only with the secret instrument in the Police Chief's
office. Then why watch it? Jimmie Frost glanced at his watch. It
wanted but a few minutes to two o'clock. He turned to the boy.</p>

<p>"Run down to the street, George, and get the latest newspapers,
please."</p>

<p>When the boy had left the room, Jimmie Frost turned to his old
comrade:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>John Nott met his look frankly.</p>

<p>"Any message?"</p>

<p>When the tall detective shook his head, Jimmie Frost added:</p>

<p>"Why did Sir Edmund send you here, John?"</p>

<p>The Inspector frowned. "Hanged if I know," he confessed. "He
said he thought I might like to see you again&mdash;and that you
might like to see me."</p>

<p>"And?" The ex-detective asked, when his companion paused.</p>

<p>"Damn it!" Inspector Nott exploded suddenly. "He told me to get
here at half-past one and not to leave until he telephoned
you."</p>

<p>"Strange!" Jimmie Frost' was still further puzzled. What was in
the Police Chief's mind? To what end was he working? Inspector Nott
was to stay with him&mdash;</p>

<p>George came into the room and placed the newspapers on the table
at Jimmie Frost's elbow. The ex-detective opened one; then gasped
in astonishment. John Nott came round the table and leaned over his
shoulder. Conspicuous on the page was the headline:</p>
<br>

<p class="headline">DEATH OF MR. LUTHER BANKE.</p>

<p><br>
Jimmie Frost drew a deep breath. So Luther Banke was dead&mdash;and
he had died in "Cain's" house! Another name had been added to the
sinister total. Five men&mdash;all of them victimised by
"Cain"&mdash;and all dead! The sixth&mdash;the man be believed
destined to be a victim&mdash;lay in a prison cell!</p>

<p>The shrill "t-r-ing" of the telephone bell cut short his
meditations. He rose from his chair and went to the instrument.</p>

<p>"Detective-Inspector Mark Denvers to call on Miss Martha Tayne
at the offices of Luther Banke &amp; Co., Hunter Street, punctually
at noon tomorrow." The Police Chief's voice was severely official.
Then it changed to a more personal note.</p>

<p>"Did you get that, Jimmie? Mark Denvers, not the underworld
crook, Jimmie Frost. Understand? Detective-Inspector Mark
Denvers."</p>

<p>A sharp click in the instrument tokened that the connection had
been severed. With a worried frown on his face Mark Denvers
replaced the receiver on its hook.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="first">MARTHA TAYNE sat at her desk, outside the door of
Luther Banke's private office. She was frowning, and her foot
tapped, impatiently, the rug under the desk. She was nervous.
Continually her eyes turned on the door leading into the shop, then
to the clock perched on top of the big filing cabinet. The
clock-face showed ten minutes to noon.</p>

<p>She was dressed entirely in black; not even a line of white
relieved its sombreness. Yet the heavy mourning suited her well,
throwing into relief the tinge of red in her dark hair,
accentuating the pure whiteness of her skin. Now and again her
fingers strayed to her skirt, plucking nervously at its folds.</p>

<p>Martha Tayne was clothed in black in honour of her late
employer, Luther Banke. That morning she had received official
notice of his death from the hospital authorities. According to
that report, Luther Banke had died in the hospital ambulance, while
being conveyed from the hospital to his own home.</p>

<p>Again the girl's eyes went to the clock. She wondered, why were
the minutes passing so slowly? There was so much to do, and to say,
before night brought ease and contentment. Luther Banke was dead.
For the time she was in sole control of the store&mdash;one of the
largest and richest in the world. There were many men in authority
in its various departments, but one and all, they deferred to her,
a girl not yet numbering twenty-five years. It had been so during
Luther Banke's life, and it would continue, until&mdash;</p>

<p>Indecision now marked her features and her actions. She was
waiting for what she knew must happen. Almost she expected the door
to open and the short stout figure of Alec Kempton to walk into the
room. As solicitor to the deceased jeweller, he had the right of
entry. Martha knew he was one of the trustees under Luther Banke's
will. She knew that the other trustee was a nonentity who would be
a pliant instrument in the bombastic solicitor's hands.</p>

<p>Thank God that events had been so ordered that Alec Kempton
would never again enter that place. Martha had long feared and
distrusted the man. Unofficially she had known of Luther Banke's
death the previous evening. She had stood by his bedside, and
looked down on his ever-still form. She had been amid the bustle
and perplexities his death had occasioned, for Luther Banke had not
died in the ambulance van, nor in his own home. His death had
brought to an end plans she and others had formed&mdash;plans they
believed would succeed in righting a great wrong. Now she was
waiting&mdash;as she had been told to wait. Waiting for what? Those
whom she now allowed to dictate her actions&mdash;men she knew to
be of good repute and standing&mdash;had told her little. She
trusted them&mdash;and was content.</p>

<p>A light tap came on the door opening into the shop. At her
quick, clear word of permission a man entered.</p>

<p>"Joyce!" The girl sprang to her feet. "Is&mdash;has&mdash;?</p>

<p>"All serene, old thing." The young man carefully placed his hat,
stick and gloves on a small table just within the door, then
advanced to meet Martha with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"The ship sailed an hour ago. I'll bet all I've made in my
practice this last twelve months that no one at the wharf had the
slightest suspicion. And you?"</p>

<p>"I?" The girl laughed happily. "An hour more and I shed
this&mdash;" Her fingers touched her black skirt. "I&mdash;I shall
be no longer a hypocrite. No, don't think I am not sorry for uncle
Luther, but&mdash;but I'm too happy for black things and I feel
hypocritical wearing them. Tonight I take the train for&mdash;for,
you know."</p>

<p>"And join the ship at&mdash;you know!" Joyce Poynter mimicked
her tones. "Three miles out at sea&mdash;" The girl laughed, her
face flushing. "And, uncle Edmund?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Will be here in a few minutes. I have never known the old boy
late for an appointment."</p>

<p>"But, Joyce&mdash;it seems&mdash;awful!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;Dick?"</p>

<p>"No." The girl's answer was quick. "I&mdash;I mean&mdash;the
others. I feel as if we were running away&mdash;leaving others to
bear the results of our wrong-doings. Dick&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have the papers?"</p>

<p>"In the safe." Her eyes went to the door of the inner
office.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;that's all right."</p>

<p>Joyce Poynter laughed with evident relief. "But uncle
Edmund&mdash;" The girl's voice held a hint of reproach.</p>

<p>"Uncle Edmund can look after himself." The man spoke easily. "I
heard him called 'an old fox' once, and I believe it. His men swear
by him&mdash;yet I know there is not one who understands him; who
can follow his lines of thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except Mark Denvers," interjected Martha.</p>

<p>"He's your pigeon, my dear." Joyce Poynter laughed. "We are
leaving you to deal with him."</p>

<p>"And if I fail?" The girl hesitated.</p>

<p>"Sir Edmund says that when Martha takes a hand there is no
thought of failure."</p>

<p>The girl swept a mocking curtsy. She said, simply: "I'm
frightened."</p>

<p>"Frightened?" The man's brows rose inquiringly.</p>

<p>"It's for&mdash;Dick."</p>

<p>"The young scoundrel!" Joyce Poynter laughed. "I-"</p>

<p>He turned quickly as the door opened and Sir Edmund Morgan
entered the room. Martha Tayne went to meet him. As she lifted her
cheek for his accustomed caress, he stooped to her hand. The girl
flushed hotly.</p>

<p>"A tribute to a brave woman, my dear." The old man led the girl
to her seat. For a moment he was silent, then lifted his head and
glanced keenly about the room. "Joyce! Martha! You know what has to
be said. You must be guided by me."</p>

<p>A knock came at the door. At a sign from Sir Edmund, Joyce
Poynter went to the door and opened it. On the threshold stood
Inspector Mark Denvers. When he saw the Police Commissioner, he
came forward, saluting gravely.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mark." Sir Edmund spoke slowly. "We've gathered here,
at the end of a long lane. I have to tell you that our quest has
ended."</p>

<p>"I've failed, sir?" There was bitterness in the Inspector's
voice. "I understand you are telling me that 'Cain' has
escaped?"</p>

<p>"He is not here." Sir Edmund waited. For long seconds there was
silence in the room. At length Mark Denvers shrugged and turned to
the door. "I understand, sir," he said. "I've failed! Well, you
have my resignation!"</p>

<p>Again came the painful silence. Mark Denvers raised his head,
proudly. "May I take this opportunity of thanking you for not
publishing it before."</p>

<p>"Uncle!" Martha sprang to her feet. "You are unfair!" She went
to the Inspector. "Mr. Denvers, are you&mdash;are you sorry
that&mdash;that 'Cain' has escaped?"</p>

<p>A shrug gave silent answer to her question.</p>

<p>"If I tell you that I love him?"</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne," the detective's eyes searched her face. "He is a
criminal."</p>

<p>"He is a man who was sorely wronged&mdash;and who took the wrong
way to right his wrongs."</p>

<p>For a full minute the police officer looked into the girl's
eyes. A slight smile came to his lips. "You are telling me that
with him it was a matter of revenge&mdash;of attempted
self-restitution?"</p>

<p>Martha nodded.</p>

<p>"And, that he is honest&mdash;innately honest?"</p>

<p>"I know he is&mdash;I will swear he is." The girl lifted her
head, proudly.</p>

<p>Very gravely, Mark Denvers bowed. "For your sake, Miss Tayne.
I&mdash;I cannot be sorry." Again he turned to the door.</p>

<p>"Walt, Mark!" Sir Edmund spoke, and his voice held the old ring
of authority. "Sit down. I want Martha to tell you the story. It is
your due to hear it."</p>

<p>The girl coloured. For a few seconds she was silent; then
commenced to speak, softly and hesitatingly. As her tale unfolded,
she gained vigour and dramatic power.</p>

<p>"I must start during the days of the Great War." Martha
hesitated. "A young man&mdash;the only son of a very rich
man&mdash;volunteered for service. His father objected&mdash;he
feared for him. But the young man persisted. To the war with this
young man went his great friend&mdash;a friend such as few men
have; a friend who would do much, even sin, for friendship."</p>

<p>Across the room Mark Denvers' eyes sought and met Joyce
Poynter's. He nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"The father was proud of his son, yet he was angry that he had
disregarded his wishes." Martha continued. "For diversion he
returned to business, although he had no need of greater wealth. He
was successful&mdash;very successful, and others were envious of
him."</p>

<p>"Pell, Michaelstein, Symonds, Kilson and Banke," murmured Mark
Denvers.</p>

<p>"Not the last named." Joyce Poynter spoke quickly. "Luther Banke
did not know of the conspiracy until it was too late for him to
interfere successfully."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" Sir Edmund spoke In tones of disbelief. "Dick
did not think so."</p>

<p>"Or he would not have looted him." Mark Denvers lips twitched in
a dry smile.</p>

<p>"We shall never know exactly&mdash;now," Joyce Poynter
concluded.</p>

<p>"Let me continue." Martha spoke. "Mr. Ulman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" The Inspector interjected. The mystery about the house at
Moorfield existed no longer.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Mr. Ulman missed his son greatly. He wrote to him. In
his reply, and in later letters to his father, Dick mentioned
matters that were grave military secrets. Mr. Ulman did not know
that. He was proud of his son; proud of the high and honourable
military record he was building. He showed his son's letters to his
business associates&mdash;the men he believed to be his loyal
friends. One of them&mdash;perhaps more than one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Michaelstein!" interjected Sir. Edmund. "One or more of these
men sympathised with the enemy. There was that in Dick's letters
that should not have been written. This man, or these men, conveyed
that information to the enemy. Somehow the source of the
information became known to the authorities. Dick&mdash;Dick
disappeared&mdash;" The girl broke down, hiding her face In her
hands. "Or he would have been shot as a traitor."</p>

<p>Sir Edmund continued the narrative, his voice harsh with
suppressed emotion. "Is there more to explain? In war there is no
Court of Appeal. The Caesars of War had spoken. Dick became a
fugitive; he became a 'Cain'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A man against whom every other man's hand is raised!" Mark
Denvers spoke under his breath. "I understand now, sir." A long
silence. Then Inspector Denvers rose from his seat and picked up
his hat.</p>

<p>"And the&mdash;the loot, sir? 'Cain's' loot. He has not kept
that?"</p>

<p>Sir Edmund nodded to Martha.</p>

<p>The girl went into the inner office, returning in a few minutes
with a small attaché case. She handed the ease to the detective.
Opening the case, he glanced through the contents, wonder growing
on his face as he came to realise that in his hands was a large
fortune. Closing the case, he offered it to the Police
Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Keep it, lad." Sir Edmund made a gesture of refusal. "You know
how to deal with the contents."</p>

<p>"How did Luther Banke become possessed of this?" asked the
Inspector, tapping the case.</p>

<p>"I placed it in the safe when Dick gave it to me," replied
Martha. "With the&mdash;the loot are the documents Mr. Banke
gathered when he was trying to get evidence of the conspiracy
against Mr. Ulman." The girl paused. "When&mdash;when 'Cain' opened
Mr. Banke's safe he took those papers, but it was not until after
Mr. Banke was taken ill that he examined them. When he partially
recovered, Dick went to him, and they were reconciled. To help
Dick, Mr. Banke pretended to remain ill and unconscious."</p>

<p>"It was during that period he came to your flat?" Mark Denvers
asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I took him, on his insistence," interjected Joyce Poynter.
"Dick Ulman discovered that Alec Kempton was going to Martha and we
suspected that he would put pressure on her to give him access to
the safe."</p>

<p>"Then the man who came to meet the man who took Miss Tayne from
her flat was&mdash;'Cain'?" Mark Denvers laughed suddenly.</p>

<p>Sir Edmund nodded. "I recognised him as soon as I entered the
room. Dick Ulman is a remarkably clever impersonator."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do about Alec Kempton?" asked the
Inspector, after a long pause.</p>

<p>"That is a matter that will require careful thought," replied
Sir Edmund. "At the present time we are holding him on a charge of
burglarious entry, but that helps us little. We want the evidence
that Luther Banke collected and deposited in his safe, for we
believe that evidence will prove that Alec Kempton was the moving
spirit in the conspiracy against the late Mr. Ulman; more, we
believe that Luther Banke held evidence that the indiscreet
statements contained in Dick Ulman's letters were not communicated
to the enemy, but that Alec Kempton falsely informed the military
authorities to that effect for the purpose of damaging the Ulmans.
We do know that he obtained the letters from Mr. Ulman, under
pretence of safe keeping; later claiming that the War Department
had his offices searched, and discovered and confiscated them.
Perhaps a little careful investigation&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Police Chief became silent. After an interval he rose to his
feet, beckoning to Joyce Poynter. "Come Joyce." Then as Mark
Denvers made to leave, also, he added. "No, lad. Martha has more to
say to you. I will see to&mdash;to things until you get to
headquarters."</p>

<p>When the door had closed behind the two men, Martha said: "That
is the first time I have ever seen uncle Edmund afraid." She
laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"Afraid?" questioned the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Can you ever forgive us?" The girl spoke in a half-whisper.
"Oh, I don't think you understand&mdash;yet. Can't you see? We are
all afraid of you."</p>

<p>"Afraid of me?" Inspector Denvers laughed harshly. "I made an
awful blotch of the case."</p>

<p>"Yet, working under an almost impossible handicap, you nearly
succeeded. You would have succeeded, had not Alec Kempton's fears
betrayed him into a false and criminal position. Then we thought we
had better tell you everything, We&mdash;Sir Edmund&mdash;all of
us&mdash;thought that you might&mdash;be prepared
to&mdash;to&mdash;Oh, how can I ask so much of you?" She turned
from him, sobbing.</p>

<p>Mark Denvers winced. "I don't think you need worry, Miss Tayne.
You see, I've not been a police officer-"</p>

<p>"Uncle Edmund never used your resignation. He tore it up
directly you left his room. He never intended-"</p>

<p>"Then why-?"</p>

<p>"Because he&mdash;and all of us&mdash;were frightened of you.
Uncle was frightened when he learned the truth about&mdash;Dick,
and Joyce, and me&mdash;He thought&mdash;He had to handicap you
and&mdash;and that was the best way he could devise." Martha looked
up at the Inspector, shyly. "Can you forgive us&mdash;and
Dick?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" He hesitated a moment. "Then I&mdash;not
'Cain'&mdash;played the 'lone-hand'." He laughed shortly. "But Sir
Edmund&mdash;the Commissioner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir Edmund is not Commissioner&mdash;now." Martha was speaking
with more confidence. "He resigned three days ago, but his
resignation has not yet been published."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;and Mr. Poynter?"</p>

<p>"Joyce is a surgeon&mdash;a very clever one. He will return to
his work." The girl hesitated. "Oh, If I could make it clear to
you! Let me try this way. Mr. Denvers, there lived three sisters;
they are all dead now. One sister married Sir Edmund. Another
sister was my mother. The third sister married Mr. Banke. Their
brother was Joyce's father. Now&mdash;" She laughed gently. "Have I
made you understand our involved relationships?"</p>

<p>Mark Denvers laughed, his face lighting. He took Martha's hand.
"I think so," he said. "Sir Edmund takes his well-earned rest.
Joyce Poynter becomes one of the leading surgeons of the country. I
am still Detective-Inspector." He paused and looked at the girl
curiously. "And you?"</p>

<p>"I leave here&mdash;this country&mdash;tonight&mdash;to join
him." Her words faltered and a happy glow came in her eyes. "We
shall never come back here&mdash;never; but I believe we shall be
happy&mdash;very, very happy."</p>

<p>"I know that." Mark Denvers spoke heartily; yet a little tinge
of regret touched his heart. "Will you let me wish you
luck&mdash;all the world holds best for, and to, you and him?
Good-bye, Miss Tayne."</p>

<p>He turned, abruptly to the door, but the girl called him.</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;Mark." He turned and saw she held an envelope In her
hand. He stiffened slightly. "There is something I&mdash;Sir Edmund
asked me to tell you. Superintendent Lorrimer is to be Commissioner
of Police and&mdash;" She paused. "Uncle Edmund asked me to give
you&mdash;this."</p>

<p>Expectantly, he ripped the letter from its cover. A glance, and
he knew he held In his hand the prize he coveted. He, Mark Denvers,
was to be the new Superintendent of Detectives. He was ordered to
report for duty immediately.</p>

<p>"Miss Tayne&mdash;" Words choked him. The girl had turned to the
window and was looking out over the little lane. For a long moment
Mark Denvers silently regarded her, then went to the door. As he
opened it, he hesitated; turned slowly to face the girl, and bowed,
low and reverently. The door swung shut behind him, leaving the
girl alone in the room with her happy thoughts.</p>

<p>In the shop, Inspector Mark Denvers lingered a considerable
time. The assistant who served him, was surprised at his
indecision, and still more so at the low-voiced instructions for
the delivery of the goods. As he reached the pavement he raised his
hand to a cruising taxi, then lowered it quickly and shook his
head, laughing happily. He had come out from the jewellery store
with not the price of taxi-hire remaining on him. Again he laughed,
almost happily; yet there was a catch in his throat. He stopped and
faced the elaborately-displayed windows of the largest jewellery
store in the city&mdash;and raised his hat. Softly he murmured a
few words&mdash;words that came straight from his heart:</p>

<p>"Health&mdash;happiness, to Martha and 'Cain'!"</p>
