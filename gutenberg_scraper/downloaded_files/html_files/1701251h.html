  <p class="note">"La  parlate d'amor,<br>
    O cari fior,<br>
    Recate i miei sospiri,<br>
    Narrate i miei matiri,<br>
Ditele o cari fior &mdash;"</p>
  <p>Miss  Bouverie ceased on the high note, as abruptly as string that snaps beneath the  bow, and revolved with the music-stool, to catch but her echoes in the empty  room. None had entered behind her back; there was neither sound nor shadow in  the deep veranda through the open door. But for the startled girl at the open piano,  Mrs. Clarkson's sanctum was precisely as Mrs. Clarkson had left it an hour  before; her own photograph, in as many modes, beamed from the usual number of  ornamental frames; there was nothing whatever to confirm a wild suspicion of  the living lady's untimely return. And yet either guilty consciences, or an ear  as sensitive as it was true, had heard an unmistakable step outside.</p>
  <p>Hilda  Bouverie lived to look magnificent when she sang, her fine frame drawn up to  its last inch, her throat a pillar of pale coral, her mouth the perfect round,  her teeth a noble relic of barbarism; but sweeter she never was than in these  days, or at this moment of them, as she sat with lips just parted and teeth  just showing, in a simple summer frock of her own unaided making. Her eyes, of  the one deep Tasmanian blue, were still open very wide, but no longer with the  same apprehension; for a step there was, but a step that jingled; nor did they  recognize the silhouette in top-boots which at length stood bowing on the  threshold.</p>
  <p>"Please  finish it!" prayed a voice that Miss Bouverie liked in her turn; but it was too  much at ease for one entirely strange to her, and she rose with little  embarrassment and no hesitation at all.</p>
  <p>"Indeed,  no! I thought I had the station to myself."</p>
  <p>"So  you had &mdash; I have not seen a soul."</p>
  <p>Miss  Bouverie instantly perceived that honors were due from her.</p>
  <p>"I  am so sorry! You've come to see Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson?" she cried. "Mrs.  Clarkson has just left for Melbourne with her maid, and Mr. Clarkson has gone  mustering with all his men. But the Indian cook is about somewhere. I'll find  him, and he shall make some tea."</p>
  <p>The  visitor planted himself with much gallantry in the doorway; he was a man still  young, with a single eye-glass and a martial mustache, which combined to give  distinction to a somewhat swarthy countenance. At the moment he had also an  engaging smile.</p>
  <p>"I  didn't come to see either Mr. or Mrs. Clarkson," said he; "in fact, I never  heard their name before. I was passing the station, and I simply came to see  who it was who could sing like that &mdash; to believe my own ears!"</p>
  <p>Miss  Bouverie was thrilled. The stranger spoke with an authority that she divined, a  sincerity which she instinctively took on trust. Her breath came quickly; she  was a little nervous now.</p>
  <p>"If  you won't sing to my face," he went on, "I must go back to where I hung up my  horse, and pray that you will at least send me on my way rejoicing. You will do  that in any case. I didn't know there was such a voice in these parts. You sing  a good deal, of course?"</p>
  <p>"I  haven't sung for months."</p>
  <p>He  was now in the room; there was no longer any necessity to bar the doorway, and  the light coming through fell full on his amazement. The girl stood before him  with a calm face, more wistful than ironic, yet with hints of humor in the dark  blue eyes. Her companion put up the eye-glass which he had dropped at her  reply.</p>
  <p>"May  I ask what you are doing in these wilds?"</p>
  <p>"Certainly.  I am Mrs. Clarkson's companion."</p>
  <p>"And  you sing, for the first time in months, the minute her back is turned: has the  lady no soul for music?"</p>
  <p>"You  had better ask the lady."</p>
  <p>And  her visible humor reached the corners of Miss Bouverie's mouth.</p>
  <p>"She  sings herself, perhaps?"</p>
  <p>"And  I am here to play her accompaniments!"</p>
  <p>The  eye-glass focussed the great, smiling girl.</p>
  <p>"<i>Can</i> she sing?"</p>
  <p>"She  has a voice."</p>
  <p>"But  have you never let her hear yours?"</p>
  <p>"Once.  I had not been here long enough to know better. And I made my usual mistake."</p>
  <p>"What  is that?"</p>
  <p>"I  thought I had the station to myself."</p>
  <p>The  questioner bowed to his rebuke. "Well?" he persisted none the less.</p>
  <p>"I  was told exactly what my voice was like, and fit for."</p>
  <p>The  gentleman turned on his heel, as though her appreciation of the humor of her  position were an annoyance to him. His movement brought him face to face with a  photographic galaxy of ladies in varying styles of evening dress, with an equal  variety in coiffures, but a certain family likeness running through the series.</p>
  <p>"Are  any of these Mrs. Clarkson?"</p>
  <p>"All  of them."</p>
  <p>He  muttered something in his mustache. "And what's this?" he asked of a sudden.</p>
  <p>The  young man (for as such Miss Bouverie was beginning to regard him) was standing  under the flaming bill of a grand concert to be given in the township of  Yallarook for the benefit of local charities.</p>
  <p>"Oh,  that's Mrs. Clarkson's concert," he was informed. "She has been getting it up,  and that's why she's had to go to Melbourne &mdash; about her dress, you know."</p>
  <p>He  smiled sardonically through mustache and monocle.</p>
  <p>"Her  charity begins near home!"</p>
  <p>"It  need not necessarily end there."</p>
  <p>"Yet  she sings five times herself."</p>
  <p>"True  &mdash; without the encores."</p>
  <p>"And  you don't sing at all."</p>
  <p>"But  I accompany."</p>
  <p>"A  bitter irony! But, I say, what's this? 'Under the distinguished patronage of  Sir Julian Crum, Mus. Doc., D.C.L.' Who may he be?"</p>
  <p>"Director  of the Royal College of Music, in the old country," the girl answered with a  sigh.</p>
  <p>"Royal  College of Music? That's something new, since my time," said the visitor,  sighing also. "But what's a man like that doing out here?"</p>
  <p>"He  has a brother a squatter, the next station but one. Sir Julian's spending the  English winter with him on account of his health."</p>
  <p>"So  you've seen something of him?"</p>
  <p>"I  wish we had."</p>
  <p>"But  Mrs. Clarkson has?"</p>
  <p>"No  &mdash; not yet."</p>
  <p>"I  see!" and an enlightened gleam shot through the eye-glass. "So this is her way  of getting to know a poor overworked wreck who came out to patch his lungs in  peace and quiet! And she's going to sing him one of his own songs; she's gone  to Melbourne to dress the part; and you're not going to sing anything at all!"</p>
  <p>Miss  Bouverie refrained alike from comment and confirmation; but her silence was the  less creditable in that her companion was now communing chiefly with himself.  She felt, indeed, that she had already been guilty of a certain disloyalty to  one to whom she owed some manner of allegiance; but that was the extent of Miss  Bouverie's indiscretion in her own eyes. It caused her no qualms to entertain  an anonymous gentleman whom she had never seen before. A colder course had  commended itself to the young lady fresh from London; but to a Colonial girl,  on a station where special provision was made for the entertaining of strange  travellers, the situation was simply conventional. It might have been less  onerous with host or hostess on the spot; but then the visitor would not have  heard her sing, and he seemed to know what singing was.</p>
  <p>Miss  Bouverie watched him as he leant over the piano, looking through the songs  which she had dared once more to bring forth from her room. She might well have  taken a romantic interest in the dark and dapper man, with the military  eye-glass and mustache, the spruce duck jacket and the spurred top-boots. It  was her first meeting with such a type in the back-blocks of New South Wales.  The gallant ease, the natural gayety, the charming manners that charmed no less  for a clear trace of mannerism, were a peculiar refreshment after society  racier of Riverina soil. Yet it was none of these things which attracted this  woman to this man; for the susceptible girl was dead in her for the time being;  but the desperate artist was alive again after many weeks, was panting for  fresh life, was catching at a straw. He had heard her sing. It had brought him  galloping off the track. He praised her voice; and he knew &mdash; he knew what  singing was.</p>
  <p>Who  could he be? Not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. could that be possible?</p>
  <p>"Sing  me this," he said, suddenly, and, seating himself at the piano, played the  opening bars of a vocal adaptation of Handel's Largo with a just, though  unpractised, touch.</p>
  <p>Nothing  could have afforded a finer hearing of the quality and the compass of her  voice, and she knew of old how well it suited her; yet at the outset, from the  sheer excitement of her suspicion, Hilda Bouverie was shaky to the point of a  pronounced tremolo. It wore off with the lengthening cadences, and in a minute  the little building was bursting with her voice, while the pianist swayed and  bent upon his stool with the exuberant sympathy of a brother in art. And when  the last rich note had died away he wheeled about, and so sat silent for many  moments, looking curiously on her flushed face and panting bosom.</p>
  <p>"I  can't place your voice," he said, at last. "It's both voices &mdash; the most  wonderful compass in the world &mdash; and the world will tell you so, when you go  back to it, as go back you must and shall. May I ask the name of your master?"</p>
  <p>"My  own name &mdash; Bouverie. It was my father. He is dead."</p>
  <p>Her  eyes glistened.</p>
  <p>"You  did not go to another?"</p>
  <p>"I  had no money. Besides, he had lived for what you say; when he died with his  dream still a dream, I said I would do the same, and I came up here."</p>
  <p>She  had turned away. A less tactful interlocutor had sought plainer repudiation of  the rash resolve; this one rose and buried himself in more songs.</p>
  <p>"I  have heard you in Grand Opera, and in something really grand," he said. "Now I  want a song, the simpler the better."</p>
  <p>Behind  his back a daring light came into the moist eyes.</p>
  <p>"There  is one of Mrs. Clarkson's," she said. "She would never forgive me for singing  it, but I have heard it from her so often, I know so well how it ought to go."</p>
  <p>And,  fetching the song from a cabinet, she thrust it boldly under his nose. It was  called "The Unrealized Ideal," and was a setting of some words by a real poet  then living, whose name caused this reader to murmur, "London Lyrics!" The  composer was Sir Julian Crum. But his name was read without a word, or a  movement of the strong shoulders and the tanned neck on which Miss Bouverie's  eyes were fixed.</p>
  <p>"You  had better play this yourself," said he, after peering at the music through his  glass. "It is rather too many for me."</p>
  <p>And,  strangely crestfallen, Miss Bouverie took his place.</p>
  <p class="note">"My  only love is always near&nbsp;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  country or in town<br>
  I  see her twinkling feet, I hear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  whisper of her gown.</p>
  <p class="note">"She  foots it, ever fair and young,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her  locks are tied in haste,<br>
  And  one is o'er her shoulder flung<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  hangs below her waist."</p>
  <p>For  that was the immortal trifle. How much of its immortality it will owe to the  setting of Sir Julian Crum is a matter of opinion, but here is an anonymous  view.</p>
  <p>"I  like the words, Miss Bouverie, but the setting doesn't take me. It might with  repetition. It seems lacking in go and simplicity; technically, I should say, a  gem. But there can be no two opinions of your singing of such a song; that's  the sort of arrow to go straight to the heart of the public &mdash; a world-wide  public &mdash; and if I am the first to say it to you, I hope you will one day  remember it in my favor. Meanwhile it is for me to thank you &mdash; from my heart &mdash;  and to say good-by!"</p>
  <p>He  was holding out a sunburnt hand.</p>
  <p>"Must  you go?" she asked, withholding her own in frank disappointment.</p>
  <p>"Unfortunately,  yes; my man is waiting for me with both horses in the scrub. But before I go I  want to ask a great favor of you. It is &mdash; not to tell a soul I have been here."</p>
  <p>For  a singer and a woman of temperament, Hilda Bouverie had a wonderfully level  head. She inquired his reason in no promising tone.</p>
  <p>"You  will see at Mrs. Clarkson's concert."</p>
  <p>Hilda  started.</p>
  <p>"You  are coming to that?"</p>
  <p>"Without  fail &mdash; to hear Mrs. Clarkson sing five songs &mdash; your song among them!"</p>
  <p>"But  it's hers; it has been the other way about."</p>
  <p>The  gay smile broadened on the swarthy face; a very bright eye twinkled through the  monocle into those of Miss Bouverie.</p>
  <p>"Well,  will you promise to say nothing about me? I have a reason which you will be the  first to appreciate in due season."</p>
  <p>Hilda  hesitated, reasoned with herself, and finally gave her word. Their hands were  joined an instant, as he thanked her with gallant smile and bow. Then he was  gone. And as his spurs ceased jingling on the veranda outside, Hilda Bouverie  glanced again at the song on the piano and clapped her hands with unreasonable  pride.</p>
  <p>"I  do believe that I was right after all!" said she.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>2</b></p>
  <p>Mr.  Clarkson and his young men sat at meat that evening with a Miss Bouverie hard  to recognize as the apparently austere spinster who had hitherto been something  of a skeleton at their board. Coldly handsome at her worst, a single day had  brought her forth a radiant beauty wreathed in human smiles. Her clear skin had  a tinge which at once suggested and dismissed the thought of rouge; but beyond  all doubt she had done her hair with less reserve; and it was coppery hair of a  volatile sort, that sprang into natural curls at the first relaxation of an  undue discipline. Mr. Clarkson wondered whether his wife's departure had aught  to do with the striking change in her companion; the two young men rested  mutually assured that it had.</p>
  <p>"The  old girl keeps too close an eye on her," said little Mr. Hack, who kept the  books and hailed from Middlesex. "Get her to yourself, Ted, and she's as larky  as they're made."</p>
  <p>Ted  Radford, the station overseer, was a personage not to be dismissed in a  relative clause. He was a typical back-blocker, dry and wiry, nasally cocksure,  insolently cool, a fearless hand with horse, man, or woman. He was a good  friend to Hack when there was no third person of his own kidney to appreciate  the overseer's conception of friendly chaff. They were by themselves now, yet  the last speech drew from Radford a sufficiently sardonic grin.</p>
  <p>"You  see if she is, old man," said he, "and I'll stand by to collect your remains.  Not but what she hasn't come off the ice, and looks like thoring if you take  her the right way."</p>
  <p>Ted  Radford was a confirmed believer in the rightness of his own way with all  mankind; his admirable confidence had not been shaken by a long succession of  snubs in the quarter under discussion. As for Miss Bouverie, it was her  practice to play off one young man against the other by discouraging each in his  turn. But this evening she was a different being. She had a vague yet absolute  conviction that her fortune was made. She could have sung all her songs to the  twain, but for the reflection that Mr. Clarkson himself would hear them too,  and report the matter to his wife on her return.</p>
  <p>And  the next night the male trio were strangely absorbed in some station happening  which did not arouse Miss Bouverie's curiosity in the least. They were excited  and yet constrained at dinner, and drew their chairs close together on the  veranda afterward. The young lady caught at least one word of which she did not  know the meaning. She had the tact to keep out of earshot after that. Nor was  she very much more interested when she met the two young men with revolvers in  their hands the following day.</p>
  <p>"Going  to fight a duel?" she inquired, smilingly, for her heart was still singing  Grand Opera and Oratorio by turns.</p>
  <p>"More  or less," returned the overseer, without his usual pleasantry. "We're going to  have a match at a target behind the pines."</p>
  <p>The  London bookkeeper looked an anxious clerk: the girl was glad when she saw the  pair alive at dinner. There seemed to be little doing. Though the summer was  already tropical, there had been plenteous rains, and Mr. Clarkson observed in  Hilda's hearing that the recent day's mustering would be the last for some  little time. She was thrown much in his company, and she liked Mr. Clarkson  when Mrs. Clarkson was not there. In his wife's hands the good man was wax; now  a mere echo, now a veritable claque in himself, he pandered indefatigably to  the multitudinous vanities of a ludicrously vain woman. But it was soon Miss  Bouverie's experience that he could, when he dared, be attentively considerate  of lesser ladies. And in many ways these were much the happiest days that she  had spent on the station.</p>
  <p>They  were, however, days of a consuming excitement for the caged and gagged  nightingale that Hilda Bouverie now conceived herself to be. She sang not  another note aloud. Mr. Clarkson lived in slippers on the veranda, which Hilda  now associated chiefly with a stranger's spurs: for of the booted and spurred  stranger she was thinking incessantly, though still without the emotions of an  ordinarily romantic temperament. Would he be at the concert, or would he not?  Would he turn out to be what she firmly imagined him, or was she to find out  her mistake? Might he not in any case have said or written some pregnant word  for her? Was it beyond the bounds of possibility that she should be asked to  sing after all?</p>
  <p>The  last question was the only one to be answered before the time, unless a  point-blank inquiry of Mrs. Clarkson be included in the category. The lady had  returned with a gorgeous gown, only less full of her experiences than of the  crowning triumph yet to come. She had bought every song of Sir Julian's to be  had in Melbourne, and his name was always on her lips. In a reckless moment  Miss Bouverie had inquired his age.</p>
  <p>"I  really don't know," said Mrs. Clarkson. "What <i>can</i> it matter?"</p>
  <p>"I  only wondered whether he was a youngish man or not."</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Clarkson had already raised her eyebrows; at this answer they disappeared  behind a <i>toupet</i> dating from her late descent upon the Victorian capital.</p>
  <p>"Really,  Miss Bouverie!" she said, and nothing more in words. But the tone was intolerable,  and its accompanying sneer a refinement in vulgarity, which only the really  refined would have resented as it deserved. Miss Bouverie got up and left the  room without a word. But her flaming face left a misleading tale behind.</p>
  <p>She  was not introduced to Sir Julian; but that was not her prime disappointment  when the great night came. All desire for an introduction, all interest in the  concert, died a sudden death in Hilda Bouverie at her first glimpse of the  gentleman who was duly presented to Mrs. Clarkson as Sir Julian Crum. He was  more than middle-aged; he wore a gray beard, and the air of a somewhat  supercilious martyr; his near sight was obviated by double lenses in gold rims.  Hilda could have wept before the world. For nearly three weeks she had been  bowing in imagination to a very different Sir Julian, bowing as though she had  never beheld him in her life before; and yet in three minutes she saw how  little real reason she had ever had for the illogical conclusion to which she  had jumped. She searched for the sprightly figure she had worn in her mind's  eye; his presence under any other name would still have been welcome enough  now. But he was not there at all. In the patchy glare of the kerosene lamps,  against the bunting which lined the corrugated walls of Gulland's new iron  store, among flower and weed of township and of station, did Miss Bouverie seek  in vain for a single eye-glass and a military mustache.</p>
  <p>The  concert began. Miss Bouverie opened it herself with the inevitably thankless  pianoforte solo, in this case gratuitously meretricious into the bargain,  albeit the arbitrary choice of no less a judge than Mrs. Clarkson. It was  received with perfunctory applause, through which a dissipated stockman  thundered thickly for a song. Miss Bouverie averted her eyes from Sir Julian  (ensconced like Royalty in the centre of the first row) as she descended from  the platform. She had not the hardihood to glance toward the great man until  the indistinct stockman had had his wish, and Mrs. Clarkson, in her fine new  raiment, had both sung and acted a coy ditty of the previous decade, wherein  every line began with the word "somebody." It was an immediate success; the  obstreperous stockman led the encore; but Miss Bouverie, who duly accompanied,  extracted solace from the depressed attitude in which Sir Julian Crum sat  looking down his nose.</p>
  <p>The  township boasted its score of dwellings, but few of them showed a light that  evening; not less than ninety of the round hundred of inhabitants clapped their  hands and mopped their foreheads in Gulland's new store. It might have been run  up for its present purpose. There was an entrance at one end for the  performers, and that on the platform level, since the ground sloped a little;  at the other end was the only other entrance, by which the audience were  admitted. A makeshift lobby had been arranged behind the platform, and thither  Mrs. Clarkson retired to await her earlier encores; when the compliment became  a recognized matter of course, she abandoned the mere form of a momentary  retirement, and stood patiently smiling in the satin ball-dress brought from  Melbourne for the nonce. And for the brief intervals between her efforts she  descended to a throne specially reserved on the great musician's right.</p>
  <p>The  other performers did not dim her brilliance by reason of their own. There was  her own dear husband, whose serious recitation was the one entertaining number.  There was a Rabbit Inspector who rapped out "The Scout" in a defiant barytone,  and a publican whose somewhat uneven tenor was shaken to its depths by the  simple pathos of "When Sparrows Build." Mrs. Clarkson could afford to encourage  such tyros with marked applause. The only danger was that Sir Julian might  think she really admired their untutored attempts.</p>
  <p>"One  must do it," she therefore took occasion to explain as she clapped. "They are  so nervous. The hard thing is to put oneself in their place; it's nothing to me  to sing a song, Sir Julian."</p>
  <p>"So  I can see, madam," said he.</p>
  <p>At  the extreme end of the same row Miss Bouverie passed her unemployed moments  between Mr. Radford and the wall, and was not easy until she had signalled to  little Mr. Hack to occupy the seat behind her. With the two together she felt  comparatively comfortable. Mr. Radford's running criticism on the performers,  always pungent, was often amusing, while Mr. Hack lost no opportunity of  advancing his own ideals in the matter of musical entertainment.</p>
  <p>"A  song and dance," said he, again and again, with a more and more sepulchral  deviltry &mdash;"a song and dance is what you want. You should have heard the Sisters  Belton in their palmy days at the Pav! You don't get the best of everything out  here, you know, Ted!"</p>
  <p>"No;  let's hope they've got some better men than you," returned Radford, inspired by  the quorum of three to make mince-meat of his friend.</p>
  <p>It  was the interval between parts one and two. The platform was unoccupied. A cool  draught blew through the iron building from open door to open door; there was  no occasion to go outside. They had done so, however, at the lower end; there  was a sudden stampede of returning feet. A something in the scuffling steps, a  certain outcry that accompanied them, caused Miss Bouverie and her companions  to turn their heads; they turned again at as sudden a jingle on the platform,  and the girl caught her breath. There stood her missing hero, smiling on the  people, dapper, swarthy, booted, spurred, and for one moment the man she had  reason to remember, exactly as she remembered him. The next his folded arms  sprang out from the shoulders, and a brace of long-barrelled revolvers covered  the assembly.</p>
  <p>"Up  with your hands, every man of you!" he cried. "No, not the ladies, but every  man and boy who doesn't want a bullet in his brain!"</p>
  <p>The  command was echoed in uncouth accents at the lower door, where, in fact, a  bearded savage had driven in all and sundry at his pistol's point. And in a few  seconds the meeting was one which had carried by overwhelming show of hands a  proposition from which the ladies alone saw occasion to dissent.</p>
  <p>"You  may have heard of me before," said the man on the platform, sweeping the forest  of hands with his eye-glass. "My name's Stingaree."</p>
  <p>It  was the word which Hilda Bouverie had heard on the veranda and taken for some  strange expletive.</p>
  <p>"Who  is he?" she asked, in a whisper that bespoke excitement, agitation, but not  alarm.</p>
  <p>"The  fancy bushranger &mdash; the dandy outlaw!" drawled Radford, in cool reply. "I've  been expecting him. He was seen on our run the day Mrs. Clarkson went down to  Melbourne."</p>
  <p>That  memorable day for Hilda Bouverie! And it was this manner of man who had been  her hero ever since: a bushranger, an outlaw, a common robber under arms!</p>
  <p>"And  you never told me!" she cried, in an indignant whisper.</p>
  <p>"We  never told Mrs. Clarkson either. You must blame the boss."</p>
  <p>Hilda  snatched her eyes from Stingaree, and was sorry for Mrs. Clarkson for the first  time in their acquaintance. The new ball-dress of bridal satin was no whiter  than its wearer's face, which had aged several years in as many seconds. The  squatter leant toward her with uplifted hands, loyally concerned for no one and  for nothing else. Between the couple Sir Julian might have been conducting  without his b&acirc;ton, but with both arms. Meanwhile, the flashing eye-glass had  fixed itself on Miss Bouverie's companion, without resting for an instant on  Miss Bouverie.</p>
  <p>"Silence  over there!" cried Stingaree, sternly. "I'm here on a perfectly harmless  errand. If you know anything about me at all, you may know that I have a  weakness for music of any kind, so long as it's good of its kind."</p>
  <p>The  eye-glass dropped for a moment upon Mrs. Clarkson in the front row, and the  irrepressible Radford was enabled to continue his say.</p>
  <p>"He  has, too, from a mouth-organ to a full orchestra, from all accounts, Miss  Bouverie. <i>My revolver's in the coat-pocket next you!</i>"</p>
  <p>"It  is the music," continued Stingaree, looking harder than before in their  direction, "which has brought me here to-night. I've come to listen, and for no  other reason in the world. Unfortunately, when one has a price upon one's head,  one has to take certain precautions before venturing among one's fellow-men.  And, though I'm not here for gain or bloodshed, if any man of you gives me  trouble I shall shoot him like a dog!"</p>
  <p>"That's  one for me," whispered the intrepid overseer, in lower key. "Never mind. He's  not looking at us now. I believe Mrs. Clarkson's going to faint. <i>You take  what I told you and slip it under your shawl, and you'll save a second by  passing it up to me the instant you see her sway!</i>"</p>
  <p>Hilda  hesitated. A dead silence had fallen on the crowded and heated store, and in  the silence Stingaree was already taking an unguarded interest in Mrs.  Clarkson's appearance, which as certainly betokened imminent collapse. "<i>Now!</i>"  whispered Radford, and Hilda hesitated no more. She was wearing a black lace  shawl between her appearances at the piano; she had the revolver under it in a  twinkling, and pressed it to her bosom with both hands, one outside the shawl  and one underneath, as who should hug a beating heart.</p>
  <p>"Mrs.  Clarkson," said Stingaree, "you have been singing too much, and the quality of  your song has not been equal to the quantity."</p>
  <p>It  sounded a brutal speech enough; and to do justice to a portion of the audience  not hitherto remarkable for its spirit, the ungallant criticism was audibly  resented in the back rows. The maudlin stockman had indeed to be restrained by  his neighbors from precipitating himself upon the barrels of Stingaree. But the  effect upon Mrs. Clarkson herself was still more remarkable, and revealed a subtle  kindness in the desperado's cruelty. Her pale face flushed; her lack-lustre  eyes blazed forth their indignation; her very clay was on fire for all the room  to see.</p>
  <p>"I  don't sing for criminals and cut-throats!" the indignant lady cried out. She  glanced at Sir Julian as one for whom she did sing. And Sir Julian's eyes  twinkled under the bushranger's guns.</p>
  <p>"To  be sure you don't," said Stingaree, with as much sweetness as his character  would permit. "You sing for charity, and spend three times as much as you are  ever likely to make in arraying yourself for the occasion. Well, we must put up  with some song-bird without fine feathers, for I mean to hear the programme  out." His eyes ranged the front rows till they fell on Hilda Bouverie in her  corner. "You young lady over there! You've been talking since I called for  silence. You deserve to pay a penalty; be good enough to step this way."</p>
  <p>Hilda's  excitement may be supposed; it made her scandalously radiant in that company of  humiliated men and women, but it did not rob her of her resource. Removing her  shawl with apparent haste, but with calculated deliberation, she laid it in a  bunch upon the seat which she had occupied, and stepped forward with a courage  that won a cheer from the back rows. Stingaree stooped to hand her up to the  platform; and his warm grip told a tale. This was what he had come for, to make  her sing, to make her sing before Sir Julian Crum, to give her a start unique  in the history of the platform and the stage. Criminal, was he? Then the dearest,  kindest, most enchanting, most romantic criminal the world had ever seen! But  she must be worthy of his chivalry and her chance; and, from the first, her  artistic egoism insisted that she was.</p>
  <p>Stingaree  had picked up a programme, and dexterously mounted it between hammer and  cartridge of the revolver which he had momentarily relinquished, much as a  cornet-player mounts his music under his nose. With both weapons once more  levelled, he consulted the programme now.</p>
  <p>"The  next item, ladies and gentlemen," said he, "is another pianoforte solo by this  young lady. We'll let you off that, Miss Bouverie, since you've got to sing.  The next song on the programme is called 'The Unrealized Ideal,' and the music  is by our distinguished visitor and patron, Sir Julian Crum. In happier  circumstances it would have been sung to you by Mrs. Montgomery Clarkson; as it  is, I call upon Miss Bouverie to realize her ideal and ours, and on Sir Julian  Crum to accompany her, if he will."</p>
  <p>At  Mrs. Clarkson's stony side the great man dropped both arms at the superb  impudence of the invitation.</p>
  <p>"Quite  right, Sir Julian; let the blood run into them," said Stingaree. "It is a pure  oversight that you were not exempted in the beginning. Comply with my entreaty  and I guarantee that you shall suffer no further inconvenience."</p>
  <p>Sir  Julian wavered. In London he was a club-man and a diner-out; and what a tale  for the Athen&aelig;um &mdash; what a short cut to every ear at a Kensington dinner-table!  In the end it would get into the papers. That was the worst of it. But in the  midst of Sir Julian's hesitation his pondering eyes met those of Miss Bouverie  &mdash; on fire to sing him his own song &mdash; alight with the ability to do it justice.  And Sir Julian was lost.</p>
  <p>How  she sang it may be guessed. Sir Julian bowed and swayed upon his stool.  Stingaree stood by with a smile of personal pride and responsibility, but with  both revolvers still levelled, and one of them cocked. It was a better song  than he had supposed. It gained enormously from the composer's accompaniment.  The last verse was softer than another would have made it, and yet the singer  obeyed inaudible instructions as though she had never sung it otherwise. It was  more in a tuneful whisper than in hushed notes that the last words left her  lips:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">"Lightly  I sped when hope was high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  youth beguiled the chase;<br>
  I  follow &mdash; follow still; but I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall  never see her Face."</p>
  <p>The  applause, when it came, was almost overwhelming. The bushranger watched and  smiled, but cocked his second pistol, and let the programme flutter to the  floor. As for Sir Julian Crum, the self-contained, the cynical, he was seen for  an instant, wheeled about on the music-stool, grasping the singer by both  hands. But there was no hearing what he said; the girl herself heard nothing  until he bellowed in her ear:</p>
  <p>"They'll  have their encore. What can you give them? It must be something they know.  'Home, Sweet Home'? 'The Last Rose'? 'Within a Mile'? The first, eh? Very well;  it's a leaf out of Patti's book; but so are they all."</p>
  <p>And  he struck the opening bars in the key of his own song, but for some moments  Hilda Bouverie stood bereft of her great voice. A leaf out of Patti's book, in  that up-country township, before a roomful held in terror &mdash; and yet unmindful &mdash;  of the loaded pistols of two bloodthirsty bushrangers! The singer prayed for  power to live up to those golden words. A leaf out of Patti's book!</p>
  <p>It  was over. The last poignant note trembled into nothingness. The silence,  absolutely dead for some seconds, was then only broken by a spirituous sob from  the incorrigible stockman. There was never any applause at all. Ere it came,  even as it was coming, the overseer Radford leapt to his feet with a raucous  shout.</p>
  <p>The  bushranger had vanished from the platform. The other bushranger had disappeared  through the other door. The precious pair of them had melted from the room  unseen, unheard, what time every eye doted on handsome Hilda Bouverie, and  every ear on the simple words and moving cadences of "Home, Sweet Home."</p>
  <p>Ted  Radford was the first to see it; for by the end of the brief song he had his  revolver uncovered and cocked at last, and no quarry left for him to shoot.  With a bound he was on the platform; another carried him into the canvas  anteroom, a third and a fourth out into the moonlight. It was as bright as noon  in a conservatory of smoked glass. And in the tinted brightness one man was  already galloping away; but it was Stingaree who danced with one foot only in  the stirrup of a milk-white mare.</p>
  <p>Radford  rushed up to him and fired point-blank again and again. A series of metallic  clicks was all the harm he did, for Stingaree was in the saddle before the  hurled revolver struck the mare on the ribs, and sent the pair flying through  the moonlight with a shout of laughter, a cloud of sand, and a dull volley of thunderous  hoofs. The overseer picked up his revolver and returned crestfallen to examine  it in the lights of the emptying room.</p>
  <p>"I  could have sworn I loaded it," said he. "If I had, he'd have been a dead man  six times over."</p>
  <p>Miss  Bouverie had been talking to Sir Julian Crum. On Radford's entry she had grown <i>distraite</i>,  but at Radford's speech she turned back to Sir Julian with shining eyes.</p>
  <p>"My  wife wants a companion for the voyage," he was saying. "So that will cost you  nothing, but if anything the other way, and once in London, I'll be answerable.  I've adjudicated these things for years to voices not in the same class as  yours. But the worst of it is you won't stay with us."</p>
  <p>"I  will."</p>
  <p>"No;  they'll want you at Covent Garden before we know where we are. And when you are  ready to go to them, go you must."</p>
  <p>"I  shall do what you tell me."</p>
  <p>"Then  speak to Mrs. Clarkson at once."</p>
  <p>Hilda  Bouverie glanced over her shoulder, but her employers had left the building.  Her smile was less roguish than demure.</p>
  <p>"There  is no need, Sir Julian. Mrs. Clarkson has already spoken to me, though only in  a whisper. But I am to take myself off by the next coach."</p>

  The Black Hole of  Glenranald</b></h2>
  <p>It  was coming up the Murrumbidgee that Fergus Carrick first heard the name of  Stingaree. With the cautious enterprise of his race, the young gentleman had  booked steerage on a river steamer whose solitary passenger he proved to be;  accordingly he was not only permitted to sleep on the saloon settee at nights,  but graciously bidden to the captain's board by day. It was there that Fergus  Carrick encouraged tales of the bushrangers as the one cleanly topic familiar  in the mouth of the elderly engineer who completed the party. And it seemed  that the knighthood of the up-country road had been an extinct order from the  extirpation of the Kellys to the appearance of this same Stingaree, who was  reported a man of birth and mystery, with an ostentatious passion for music and  as romantic a method as that of any highwayman of the Old World from which he  hailed. But the callow Fergus had been spared the romantic temperament, and was  less impressed than entertained with what he heard.</p>
  <p>On  his arrival at Glenranald, however, he found that substantial township shaking  with laughter over the outlaw's latest and least discreditable exploit, at the  back-block hamlet of Yallarook; and then it was that young Carrick first  conceived an ambition to open his Colonial career with the capture of  Stingaree; for he was a serious immigrant, who had come out in his teens, to  stay out, if necessary, for the term of his natural life.</p>
  <p>The  idea had birth under one of the many pine trees which shaded the skeleton  streets of budding Glenranald. On this tree was nailed a placard offering a high  reward for the bushranger's person alive or dead. Fergus was making an  immediate note in his pocketbook when a hand fell on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>"Would  ye like the half o' yon?" inquired a voice in his own tongue; and there at his  elbow stood an elderly gentleman, whose patriarchal beard hid half the buttons  of his alpaca coat, while a black skull-cap sat somewhat jauntily on his head.</p>
  <p>"What  do you mean?" said Fergus, bluntly, for the old gentleman stood chuckling  gently in his venerable beard.</p>
  <p>"To  lay a hold of him," replied the other, "with the help o' some younger and  abler-bodied man; and you're the very one I want."</p>
  <p>The  raw youth stared ingenuously.</p>
  <p>"But  what can you know about me?"</p>
  <p>"I  saw ye land at the wharf," said the old gentleman, nodding his approval of the  question, "and says I, 'That's my man,' as soon as ever I clapped eyes on ye.  So I had a crack wi' the captain o' yon steamer; he told me you hadna a billet,  but were just on the lookout for the best ye could get, an' that's all he'd  been able to get out o' ye in a five days' voyage. That was enough for me. I  want a man who can keep his tongue behind his teeth, and I wanted you before I  knew you were a brither Scot!"</p>
  <p>"Are  you a squatter, sir?" the young man asked, a little overwhelmed.</p>
  <p>"No,  sir, I'm branch manager o' the Bank o' New South Wales, the only bank within a  hunder miles o' where we stand; and I can offer ye a better billet than any  squatter in the Colony."</p>
  <p>"Indeed?  I'm sure you're very kind, sir, but I'm wanting to get on a station," protested  Fergus with all his tact. "And as a matter of fact, I have introductions to one  or two stations further back, though I saw no reason to tell our friend the  skipper so."</p>
  <p>"Quite  right, quite right! I like a man who can keep his tongue in its kennel!" cried  the bank manager, rubbing his hands. "But wait while I tell ye: ye'd need to  work for your rations an any station I ever heard tell of, and I keep the  accounts of enough to know. Now, with me, ye'd get two pound a week till your  share o' the reward was wiped off; and if we had no luck for a year you'd be no  worse off, but could go and try your squatters then. That's a promise, and I'll  keep it as sure as my name's Andr' Macbean!"</p>
  <p>"But  how do you propose to catch this fellow, Mr. Macbean?"</p>
  <p>The  bank manager looked on all sides, likewise behind the tree, before replying  under his breath: "By setting a wee trap for him! A bank's a bank, and  Stingaree hasna stuck one up since he took to his trade. But I'll tell ye no  more till ye give me your answer. Yes or no?"</p>
  <p>"I'm  afraid I don't even write an office hand; and as for figures &mdash;"</p>
  <p>Mr.  Macbean laughed outright.</p>
  <p>"Did  I say I was going to take ye into the bank, mun?" cried he. "There's three of  us already to do the writin' an' the cipherin,' an' three's enough. Can you  ride?"</p>
  <p>"I  have ridden."</p>
  <p>"And  ye'll do any rough job I set ye to?"</p>
  <p>"The  rougher the better."</p>
  <p>"That's  all I ask. There's a buggy and a pair for ye to mind, and mebbe drive, though  it's horseback errands you'll do most of. I'm an old widower, living alone with  an aged housekeeper. The cashier and the clerk dig in the township, and I need  to have a man of some sort about the place; in fact, I have one, but I'll soon  get rid of him if you'll come instead. Understand, you live in the house with  me, just like the jackeroos on the stations; and like the jackeroos, you do all  the odd jobs and dirty work that no one else'll look at; but, unlike them, you  get two pounds a week from the first for doing it."</p>
  <p>Mr.  Andrew Macbean had chanced upon a magic word. It was the position of  "jackeroo," or utility parlor-man, on one or other of the stations to which he  carried introductions, that his young countryman had set before him as his  goal. True, a bank in a bush township was not a station in the bush itself. On  the other hand, his would-be friend was not the first to warn Fergus against  the futility of expecting more than a nominal salary as a babe and suckling in  Colonial experience; and perhaps the prime elements of that experience might be  gained as well in the purlieus of a sufficiently remote township as in realms unnamed  on any map. It will be seen that the sober stripling was reduced to arguing  with himself, and that his main argument was not to be admitted in his own  heart. The mysterious eccentricity of his employer, coupled with the  adventurous character of his alleged prospects, was what induced the lad to  embrace both in defiance of an unimaginative hard-headedness which he aimed at  rather than possessed.</p>
  <p>With  characteristic prudence he had left his baggage on board the river-steamer, and  his own hands carried it piecemeal to the bank. This was a red-brick bungalow  with an ample veranda, standing back from the future street that was as yet  little better than a country road. The veranda commanded a long perspective of  pines, but no further bricks and mortar, and but very few weather board walls.  The yard behind the house was shut in by as many outbuildings as clustered  about the small homesteads which Fergus had already beheld on the banks of the  Murrumbidgee. The man in charge of the yard was palpably in liquor, a chronic  condition from his general appearance, and Mr. Macbean discharged him on the  spot with a decision which left no loophole for appeal. The woman in charge of  the house adorned another plane of civilization; she was very deaf, and very  outspoken on her introduction to the young gentleman, whose face she was  pleased to approve, with the implied reservation that all faces were liars; but  she served up the mutton of the country hot and tender; and Fergus Carrick,  leaning back after an excellent repast, marvelled for the twentieth time that  he was not to pay for it.</p>
  <p>"A  teetotaler, are ye?" said Macbean, mixing a third glass of whiskey, with the  skull-cap on the back of his head. "And so was I at your age; but you're my  very man. There are some it sets talking. Wait till the old lady turns in, and  then you shall see what you shall see."</p>
  <p>Fergus  waited in increasing excitement. The day's events were worthier of a dream. To  have set foot in Glenranald without knowing a soul in the place, and to find  one's self comfortably housed at a good salary before night! There were moments  when he questioned the complete sanity of his eccentric benefactor, who drank  whiskey like water, both as to quantity and effect, and who chuckled  continuously in his huge gray beard. But such doubts only added to the  excitement of the evening, which reached a climax when a lighted candle was  thrust in at the door and the pair advised not to make a night of it by the  candid crone on her way to bed.</p>
  <p>"We  will give her twenty minutes," said the manager, winking across his glass.  "I've never let her hear me, and she mustn't hear you either. She must know  nothing at all about it; nobody must, except you and me."</p>
  <p>The  mystification of Fergus was now complete. Unimaginative as he was by practice  and profession, he had an explanation a minute until the time was up, when the  truth beat them all for wild improbability. Macbean had risen, lifting the  lamp; holding it on high he led the way through baize doors into the banking  premises. Here was another door, which Macbean not only unlocked, but locked  again behind them both. A small inner office led them into a shuttered chamber  of fair size, with a broad polished counter, glass swing-doors, and a  formidable portal beyond. And one of young Carrick's theories received apparent  confirmation on the spot; for the manager slipped behind his counter by another  door, and at once whipped out a great revolver.</p>
  <p>"This  they provide us with," said he. "So far it is our only authorized defence, and  it hangs on a hook down here behind the counter. But you march in here  prepared, your pistol cocked behind your back, and which of us is likely to  shoot first?"</p>
  <p>"The  bushranger," said Fergus, still rather more startled than reassured.</p>
  <p>"The  bushranger, of course. Stingaree, let us say. As for me, either my arms go up,  or down I go in a heap. But supposing my arms do go up &mdash; supposing I still  touch something with one foot &mdash; and supposing the floor just opens and swallows  Mr. Sanguinary Stingaree! Eh? eh? What then?"</p>
  <p>"It  would be great," cried Fergus. "But could it be done?"</p>
  <p>"It  can be, it will be, and is being done," replied the manager, replacing the bank  revolver and sliding over the counter like a boy. A square of plain linoleum  covered the floor, overlapped by a border of the same material bearing a  design. Down went Macbean upon his knees, and his beard swept this border as he  began pulling it up, tacks and all.</p>
  <p>The  lamp burned brightly on the counter, its rays reflected in the burnished  mahogany. All at once Fergus seized it on his own initiative, and set it on the  floor before his kneeling elder, going upon his own knees on the other side.  And where the plain linoleum ended, but where the overlapping border covered  the floor, the planks were sawn through and through down one side of the  central and self-colored square.</p>
  <p>"A  trap-door!" exclaimed Fergus in a whisper.</p>
  <p>Macbean  leant back on his slippered heels, his skull-cap wickedly awry.</p>
  <p>"This  border takes a lot o' lifting," said he. "Yet we've just got to lift it every  time, and tack it down again before morning. You might try your hand over  yonder on the far side."</p>
  <p>Fergus  complied with so much energy that the whole border was ripped up in a minute;  and he was not mistaken. A trap-door it was, of huge dimensions, almost exactly  covered by the self-colored square; but at each side a tongue of linoleum had  been left loose for lifting it; and the lamp had scarcely been replaced upon  the counter when the bulk of the floor leaned upright in one piece against the  opposite wall. It had uncovered a pit of corresponding size, but as yet hardly  deep enough to afford a hiding-place for the bucket, spade, and pickaxe which  lay there on a length of sacking.</p>
  <p>"I  see!" exclaimed Carrick, as the full light flooded his brain.</p>
  <p>"Is  that a fact?" inquired the manager twinkling.</p>
  <p>"You're  going to make a deep hole of it &mdash;?"</p>
  <p>"No.  I'm going to pay you to make it deep for me &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"And  then &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"At  dead o' night; you can take out your sleep by day."</p>
  <p>"When  Stingaree comes &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"If  he waits till we're ready for him &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"You  touch some lever &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"And  the floor swallows him, as I said, if he waits till we are ready for him.  Everything depends on that &mdash; and on your silence. We must take time. It isn't  only the digging of the hole. We need to fix up some counterpoise to make it  shut after a body like a mouse-trap; we must do the thing thoroughly if we do  it at all; and till it's done, not a word to a soul in the same hemisphere! In  the end I suppose I shall have to tell Donkin, my cashier, and Fowler the  clerk. Donkin's a disbeliever who deserves the name o' Didymus more than ony  mon o' my acquaintance. Fowler would take so kindly to the whole idea that he'd  blurt it out within a week. He may find it out when all's in readiness, but  I'll no tell him even then. See how I trust a brither Scot at sight!"</p>
  <p>"I  much appreciate it," said Fergus, humbly.</p>
  <p>"I  wouldna ha' trustit even you, gin I hadna found the delvin' ill worrk for auld  shoulders," pursued Macbean, broadening his speech with intentional humor.  "Noo, wull ye do't or wull ye no?"</p>
  <p>The  young man's answer was to strip off his coat and spring into the hole, and to  set to work with such energy, yet so quietly, that the bucket was filled in a  few almost silent seconds. Macbean carried it off, unlocking doors for the  nonce, while Fergus remained in the hole to mop his forehead.</p>
  <p>"We  need to have another bucket," said the manager, on his return. "I've thought of  every other thing. There's a disused well in the yard, and down goes every  blessed bucket!"</p>
  <p>To  and fro, over the lip of the closing well, back into the throat of the  deepening hole, went the buckets for many a night; and by day Fergus Carrick  employed his best wits to make an intrinsically anomalous position appear  natural to the world. It was a position which he himself could thoroughly  enjoy; he was largely his own master. He had daily opportunities of picking up  the ways and customs of the bush, and a nightly excitement which did not pall  as the secret task approached conclusion; but he was subjected to much chaff  and questioning from the other young bloods of Glenranald. He felt from the  first that it was what he must expect. He was a groom with a place at his  master's table; he was a jackeroo who introduced station life into a town. And  the element of underlying mystery, really existing as it did, was detected soon  enough by other young heads, led by that of Fowler, the keen bank clerk.</p>
  <p>"I  was looking at you both together, and you do favor the old man, and no error!"  he would say; or else, "What is it you could hang the boss for, Fergy, old  toucher?"</p>
  <p>These  delicate but cryptic sallies being ignored or parried, the heavy swamp of  innuendo was invariably deserted for the breezy hill-top of plain speech, and  Fergus had often work enough to put a guard upon hand and tongue. But his  temperament was eminently self-contained, and on the whole he was an elusive  target for the witticisms of his friends. There was no wit, however, and no  attempt at it on the part of Donkin, the cantankerous cashier. He seldom  addressed a word to Carrick, never a civil word, but more than once he treated  his chief to a sarcastic remonstrance on his degrading familiarity with an  underling. In such encounters the imperturbable graybeard was well able to take  care of himself, albeit he expressed to Fergus a regret that he had not  exercised a little more ingenuity in the beginning.</p>
  <p>"You  should have come to me with a letter of introduction," said he.</p>
  <p>"But  who would have given me one?"</p>
  <p>"I  would, yon first night, and you'd have presented it next day in office hours,"  replied the manager. "But it's too late to think about it now, and in a few  days Donkin may know the truth."</p>
  <p>He  might have known it already, but for one difficulty. They had digged their pit  to the generous depth of eight feet, so that a tall prisoner could barely touch  the trap-door with extended finger-tips; and Stingaree (whose latest  performance was no longer the Yallarook affair) was of medium height according  to his police description. The trap-door was a double one, which parted in the  centre with the deadly precision of the gallows floor. The difficulty was to  make the flaps close automatically, with the mouse-trap effect of Macbean's  ambition. It was managed eventually by boring separate wells for a weight  behind the hinges on either side. Copper wire running on minute pulleys let  into grooves suspended these weights and connected them with the flaps, and  powerful door-springs supplemented the more elaborate contrivance. The lever  controlling the whole was concealed under the counter, and reached by thrusting  a foot through a panel, which also opened inward on a spring.</p>
  <p>It  may be conceived that all this represented the midnight labors and the constant  thought of many weeks. It was now the beginning of the cool but brilliant  Riverina winter, and, despite the disparity in their years, the two Scotsmen  were fast friends. They had worked together as one man, with the same patient  passion for perfection, the same delight in detail for its own sake. Almost the  only difference was that the old fellow refreshed his energies with the glass  of whiskey which was never far from his elbow after banking hours, while the  young one cultivated the local excess of continual tea. And all this time the  rascally Stingaree ranged the district, with or without his taciturn  accomplice, covering great distances in fabulous time, lurking none knew where,  and springing on the unwary in the last places in which his presence was  suspected.</p>
  <p>"But  he has not yet robbed a bank, and we have our hopes," wrote Fergus to a  faithful sister at Largs. "It may be for fear of the revolvers with which all  the banks are provided now. Mr. Macbean has been practising with ours, and  purposely put a bullet through one of our back windows. The whole township has  been chafing him about it, and the local rag has risen to a sarcastic  paragraph, which is exactly what we wanted. The trap-door over the pit is now  practically finished. It's too complicated to describe, but Stingaree has only  to march into the bank and 'stick it up,' and the man behind the counter has  only to touch a lever with his foot for the villain to disappear through the  floor into a prison it'll take him all his time to break. On Saturday the  cashier and the clerk are coming to dinner, and before we sit down they are to  be shown everything."</p>
  <p>This  was but a fraction of one of the long letters which Fergus despatched by nearly  every mail. Silent and self-contained as he was, he had one confidante at the  opposite end of the earth, one escape-pipe in his pen. Not a word of the great  secret had he even written to another soul. To his trusted sister he had never  before been quite so communicative. His conscience pricked him as he took his  letter to the post, and he had it registered on no other score.</p>
  <p>On  Saturday the bank closed at one o'clock; the staff were to return and dine at  seven, the Queen's birthday falling on the same day for a sufficient pretext.  As the hour approached Fergus made the distressing discovery that his friend  and host had anticipated the festivities with too free a hand. Macbean was not  drunk, but he was perceptibly blunted and blurred, and Fergus had never seen  the pale eyes so watery or the black skull-cap so much on one side of the  venerable head. The lad was genuinely grieved. A whiskey bottle stood empty on  the laden board, and he had the temerity to pocket the corkscrew while Macbean  was gone to his storeroom for another bottle. A solemn search ensued, and then  Fergus was despatched in haste for a new corkscrew.</p>
  <p>"An'  look slippy," said Macbean, "or we'll have old Donkin here before ye get back."</p>
  <p>"Not  for another three-quarters of an hour," remarked Fergus, looking at his watch.</p>
  <p>"Any  minute!" retorted Macbean, with a ribald epithet. "I invited Donkin, in  confidence, to come a good half-hour airly, and I'll tell ye for why. Donkin  must ken, but I'm none so sure o' yon other impident young squirt. His tongue's  too long for his mouth. Donkin or I could always be behind the counter; anyway,  I mean to take his opeenion before tellin' any other body."</p>
  <p>Entertaining  his own distrust of the vivacious Fowler, Fergus commended the decision, and so  took his departure by the private entrance. It was near sundown; a fresh breeze  blew along the hard road, puffing cloudlets of yellow sand into the rosy dusk.  Fergus hurried till he was out of sight, and then idled shamelessly under  trees. He was not going on for a new corkscrew. He was going back to confess  boldly where he had found the old one. And the sight of Donkin in the distance  sent him back in something of a hurry; it was quite enough to have to spend an  evening with the cantankerous cashier.</p>
  <p>The  bank was practically at one end of the township as then laid out; two or three  buildings there were further on, but they stood altogether aloof. The bank, for  a bank, was sufficiently isolated, and Fergus could not but congratulate  himself on the completion of its ingenious and unsuspected defences. It only  remained to keep the inventor reasonably sober for the evening, and thereafter  to whistle or to pray for Stingaree. Meanwhile the present was no mean  occasion, and Fergus was glad to see that Macbean had thrown open the official  doors in his absence. They had often agreed that it would be worth all their  labor to enlighten Donkin by letting the pit gape under his nose as he entered  the bank. Fergus glanced over his shoulder, saw the other hurrying, and hurried  himself in order to take up a good position for seeing the cashier's face. He  was in the middle of the treacherous floor before he perceived that it was not  Macbean in the half-light behind the counter, but a good-looking man whom he  had never seen before.</p>
  <p>"Didn't  know I was invited, eh?" said the stranger, putting up a single eye-glass.  "Don't believe it, perhaps? You'd better ask Mr. Macbean!"</p>
  <p>And  before it had occurred to him to stir from where he stood agape, the floor fell  from under the feet of Fergus, his body lurched forward, and came down flat and  heavy on the hard earth eight feet below. Not entirely stunned, though shaken  and hurt from head to heel, he was still collecting his senses when the pit  blackened as the trap-door shut in implicit obedience to its weights and  springs. And in the clinging velvet darkness the young man heard a groan.</p>
  <p>"Is  that yoursel', Fergy?"</p>
  <p>"And  are you there, Mr. Macbean?"</p>
  <p>"Mon,  didn't it shut just fine!"</p>
  <p>Curiously  blended with the physical pain in the manager's voice was a sodden philosophic  humor which maddened the younger man. Fergus swore where he lay writhing on his  stomach. Macbean chuckled and groaned again.</p>
  <p>"It's  Stingaree," he said, drawing a breath through his teeth.</p>
  <p>"Of  course it is."</p>
  <p>"I  never breathed it to a soul."</p>
  <p>"No  more did I."</p>
  <p>Fergus  spoke with ready confidence, and yet the words left something on his mind. It  was something vague but haunting, something that made him feel instinctively  unworthy of the kindly, uncomplaining tone which had annoyed him but a moment  before.</p>
  <p>"No  bones broken, Fergy?"</p>
  <p>"None  that I know of."</p>
  <p>"I  doubt I've not been so lucky. I'm thinkin' it's a rib, by the way it hurts to  breathe."</p>
  <p>Fergus  was already fumbling in his pocket. The match-box opened with a click. The  match scraped several times in vain. Then at last the scene sprang out as on  the screen of a magic-lantern. And to Fergus it was a very white old man,  hunched up against the muddy wall, with blood upon his naked scalp and beard,  and both hands pressed to his side; to the old man, a muddy face stricken with  horrified concern, and a match burning down between muddy fingers; but to both,  such a new view and version of their precious hole that the corners of each  mouth were twitching as the match was thrown away.</p>
  <p>Fergus  was fumbling for another when a step rang overhead; and at the sharp exchange  of words which both underground expected, Fergus came on all fours to the old  man's side, and together they sat gazing upward into the pall of impenetrable  crape.</p>
  <p>"You  infernal villain!" they heard Donkin roar, and stamp his feet with such effect  that the floor opened, and down through the square of light came the cashier  feet first.</p>
  <p>"Heaven  and hell!" he squealed, but subsided unhurt on hands and knees as the flaps  went up with such a snap that Macbean and Carrick nudged each other at the same  moment. "Now I know who you are!" the cashier raved. "Call yourself Stingaree!  You're Fowler dressed up, and this is one of Macbean's putrid practical jokes.  I saw his jackal hurrying in to say I was coming. By cripes! it takes a  surgical operation to see their sort, I grant you."</p>
  <p>There  was a noise of subdued laughter overhead; even in the pit a dry chuckle came  through Macbean's set teeth.</p>
  <p>"If  it's practical joke o' mine, Donkin, it's recoiled on my own poor pate," said  the old man. "I've a rib stove in, too, if that's any consolation to ye. It's  Stingaree, my manny!"</p>
  <p>"You're  right, it is, it must be!" cried the cashier, finding his words in a torrent.  "I was going to tell you. He's been at his game down south; stuck up our own  mail again only yesterday, between this and Deniliquin, and got a fine haul of  registered letters, so they say. But where the deuce are we? I never knew there  was a cellar under here, let alone a trap-door that might have been made for  these villains."</p>
  <p>"It  was made for them," replied Macbean, after a pause; and in the dead dark he  went on to relate the frank and humble history of the hole, from its inception  to the crooked climax of that bitter hour. A braver confession Fergus had never  heard; its philosophic flow was unruffled by the more and more scornful  interjections of the ungenerous cashier; and yet his younger countryman, who  might have been proud of him, hardly listened to a word uttered by Macbean.</p>
  <p>Half-a-dozen  fallen from the lips of Donkin had lightened young Carrick's darkness with  consuming fires of shame. "A fine haul of registered letters"&mdash; among others his  own last letter to his sister! So it was he who had done it all; and he had  perjured himself to his benefactor, besides, betraying him. He sat in the dark  between fire and ice, chiefly wondering how he could soonest win through the  trap-door and earn a bullet in his brain.</p>
  <p>"The  spree to-night," concluded Macbean, whose fall completely sobered him, "was for  the express purpose of expounding the trap to you, and I asked you airly to  take your advice. I was no so sure about young Fowler, whether we need tell him  or no. He has an awful long tongue; but I'm thinkin' there's a longer if I knew  where to look for it."</p>
  <p>"I  could tell you where," rasped Donkin. "But go on."</p>
  <p>"I  was watching old Hannah putting her feenishing touches to the table, and  waiting for Fergus Carrick to come back, when I thought I heard him behind me  and you with him. But it was Stingaree and his mate, and the two of us were  covered with revolvers like young rifles. Hannah they told to go on with what  she was doing, as they were mighty hungry, and I advised her to do as she was bid.  The brute with the beard has charge of her. Stingaree himself drove me into the  middle of my own trap-door, made me give up my keys, and then went behind the  counter and did the trick. He'd got it all down on paper, the Lord alone knows  how."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  you Scotchmen!" cried the pleasant cashier. "Talk of your land of cakes! You  take every cake in the land between you!"</p>
  <p>It  seemed he had been filling his pipe while he listened and prepared this pretty  speech. Now he struck a match, and with the flame to the bowl saw Fergus for  the first time. The cashier held the match on high.</p>
  <p>"You  hear all the while?" he cried. "No wonder you lay low, Carrick; no wonder I  didn't hear your voice."</p>
  <p>"What  do you mean by that?" growled Fergus, in fierce heat and fierce satisfaction.</p>
  <p>"Surely,  Mr. Macbean, you aren't wondering who wagged the long tongue now?"</p>
  <p>"You  mean that I wagged mine? And it's a lie!" said Fergus, hoarsely; he was sitting  upon his heels, poised to spring.</p>
  <p>"I  mean that if Mr. Macbean had listened to me two months ago we should none of us  be in this hole now."</p>
  <p>"Then,  my faith, you're in a worse one than you think!" cried Fergus, and fell upon  his traducer as the match went out. "Take that, and that, and that!" he ground  out through his teeth, as he sent the cashier over on his back and pounded the  earth with his skull. Luckily the first was soft and the second hard, so that  the man was more outraged than hurt when circumstances which they might have  followed created a diversion.</p>
  <p>In  his turn the lively Fowler had marched whistling into the bank, had ceased  whistling to swear down the barrel of a cocked revolver, and met a quicker fate  than his comrades by impressing the bushranger as the most dangerous man of the  quartette. Unfortunately for him, his fate was still further differentiated  from theirs. Fowler's feet glanced off Carrick's back, and he plunged into the  well head-first, rolling over like a stone as the wooden jaws above closed  greedily upon the light of day.</p>
  <p>Fergus  at once struck matches, and in their light the cashier took the insensible head  upon his knees and glared at his enemy as if from sanctuary of the Red Cross.  But Fergus returned to Macbean's side.</p>
  <p>"I  never said a word to a living soul," he muttered. "It has come out some other  way."</p>
  <p>"Of  course it has," said the old manager, with the same tell-tale inhalation  through the teeth. Fergus felt worse than ever. He groped for the bald head and  found it cold and dank. In an instant he was clamoring under the trap-door,  leaping up and striking it with his fist.</p>
  <p>"What  do you want?"</p>
  <p>"Whiskey.  Some of us are hurt."</p>
  <p>"God  help you if it's any hanky-panky!"</p>
  <p>"It's  none. Something to drink, and something to drink it in, or there's blood upon  your head!"</p>
  <p>Clanking  steps departed and returned.</p>
  <p>"Stand  by to catch, below there!"</p>
  <p>And  Fergus stood by, expecting to see a long barrel with the bottle and glass that  broke their fall on him; but Stingaree had crept away unheard, and he pressed  the lever just enough to let the glass and bottle tumble through.</p>
  <p>Time  passed: it might have been an hour. The huddled heap that was Macbean breathed  forth relief. The head on Donkin's knees moved from side to side with groans.  Donkin himself thanked Fergus for his ration; he who served it out alone went  thirsty. "Wait till I earn some," he said bitterly to himself. "I could finish  the lot if I started now." But the others never dreamt that he was waiting, and  he lied about it to Macbean.</p>
  <p>Now  that they sat in silence no sound escaped them overhead. They heard Stingaree  and his mate sit down to a feast which Macbean described with groaning modesty  as the best that he could do.</p>
  <p>"There's  no soup," he whispered, "but there's a barr'l of oysters fetched up on purpose  by the coach. I hope they havena missed the Chablis. They may as well do the  thing complete." In a little the champagne popped. "Dry Monopole!" moaned the  manager, near to tears. "It came up along with the oysters. O sirs, O sirs, but  this is hard on us all! Now they're at the turkey &mdash; and I chopped the stuffing  with my ain twa han's!"</p>
  <p>They  were at the turkey a long time. Another cork popped; but the familiar tread of  deaf Hannah was heard no more, and at length they called her.</p>
  <p>"Mother!"  roared a mouth that was full.</p>
  <p>"Old  lady!" cried the gallant Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"She's  'ard of 'earing, mate."</p>
  <p>"She  might still hear you, Howie."</p>
  <p>And  the chairs rasped backward over bare boards as one; at the same instant Fergus  leapt to his feet in the earthly Tartarus his own hands had dug.</p>
  <p>"I  do believe she's done a bolt," he gasped, "and got clean away!"</p>
  <p>Curses  overhead confirmed the supposition. Clanking feet hunted the premises at a run.  In a minute the curses were renewed and multiplied, yet muffled, as though  there was some fresh cause for them which the prisoners need not know. Hannah  had not been found. Yet some disturbing discovery had undoubtedly been made.  Doors were banged and bolted. A gunshot came faint but staccato from the outer  world. A real report echoed through the bank.</p>
  <p>"A  siege!" cried Fergus, striking a match to dance by. "The old heroine has  fetched the police, and these beauties are in a trap."</p>
  <p>"And  what about us?" demanded the cashier.</p>
  <p>"Shut  up and listen!" retorted Fergus, without ceremony. Macbean was leaning forward,  with bald head on one side and hollowed palm at the upper ear. Even the stunned  man had recovered sufficiently to raise himself on one elbow and gaze overhead  as Fergus struck match after match. The villains were having an altercation on  the very trap-door.</p>
  <p>"Now's  the time to cut and run &mdash; now or never."</p>
  <p>"Very  well, you do so. I'm going through the safe."</p>
  <p>"You  should ha' done that first."</p>
  <p>"Better  late than not at all."</p>
  <p>"You  can't stop and do it without me."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  yes, I can. I'll call for a volunteer from below. You show them your spurs and  save your skin."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  I'll stay, curse you, I'll stay!"</p>
  <p>"And  I'll have my volunteer, whether you stay or not."</p>
  <p>The  pair had scarcely parted when the trap-door opened slowly and stayed open for  the first time. The banking chamber was but dimly lit, and the light in the pit  less than it had been during the brief burning of single matches. No peering  face was revealed to those below, but the voice of Stingaree came rich and  crisp from behind the counter.</p>
  <p>"Your  old woman has got away to the police-barracks and the place is surrounded. One  of you has got to come up and help, and help fair, or go to hell with a bullet  in his heart. I give you one minute to choose your man."</p>
  <p>But  in one second the man had chosen himself. Without a word, or a glance at any of  his companions, but with a face burning with extraordinary fires, Fergus  Carrick sprang for the clean edge of the trap-door, caught it first with one  hand and then with both, drew himself up like the gymnast he had been at his  Scottish school, and found himself prone upon the floor and trap-door as the  latter closed under him on the release of the lever which Stingaree understood  so well. A yell of execration followed him into the upper air. And Stingaree  was across the counter before his new ally had picked himself up.</p>
  <p>"That's  because this was expected of me," said Fergus, grimly, to explain the cashier's  reiterated anathemas. "I was the writer of the registered letter that led to  all this. So now I'm going the whole hog."</p>
  <p>And  the blue eyes boiled in his brick-red face.</p>
  <p>"You  mean that? No nonsense?"</p>
  <p>"You  shall see."</p>
  <p>"I  should shoot you like a native cat."</p>
  <p>"You  couldn't do me a better turn."</p>
  <p>"Right!  Swear on your knees that you won't use it against me or my mate, and I'll trust  you with this revolver. You may fire as high as you please, but they must think  we're three instead of two."</p>
  <p>Fergus  took the oath in fierce earnest upon his knees, was handed the weapon belonging  to the bank, and posted in his own bedroom window at the rear of the building.  The front was secure enough with the shutters and bolts of the official  fortress. It was to the back premises that the attack confined itself, making  all use of the admirable cover afforded by the stables.</p>
  <p>Carrick  saw heads and shoulders hunched to aim over stable-doors as he obeyed his  orders and kept his oath. His high fire drew a deadlier upon himself; a stream  of lead from a Winchester whistled into the room past his ear and over his  ducked head. He tried firing from the floor without showing his face. The  Winchester let him alone; in a sudden sickness he sprang up to see if anything  hung sprawling over the stable-door, and was in time to see men in retreat to  right and left, the white pugarees of the police fluttering ingloriously among  them. Only one was left upon the ground, and he could sit up to nurse a knee.</p>
  <p>Fergus  sighed relief as he sought Stingaree, and found him with a comical face before  the open safe.</p>
  <p>"House  full of paltry paper!" said he. "I suppose it's the old sportsman's custom to  get rid of most of his heavy metal before closing on Saturdays?"</p>
  <p>Fergus  said it was; he had himself stowed many a strong-box aboard unsuspected barges  for Echuca.</p>
  <p>"Well,  now's our time to leave you," continued Stingaree. "If I'm not mistaken, their  flight is simply for the moment, and in two or three more they'll be back to  batter in the bank shutters. I wonder what they think we've done with our  horses? I'll bet they've looked everywhere but in the larder next the kitchen  door &mdash; not that we ever let them get so close. But my mate's in there now,  mounted and waiting, and I shall have to leave you."</p>
  <p>"But  I was coming with you," cried Fergus, aghast.</p>
  <p>Stingaree's  eye-glass dangled on its cord.</p>
  <p>"I'm  afraid I must trouble you to step into that safe instead," said he, smiling.</p>
  <p>"Man,  I mean it! You think I don't. I've fought on your side of my own free will. How  can I live that down? It's the only side for me for the rest of time!"</p>
  <p>The  fixed eye-glass covered the brick-red face with the molten eyes.</p>
  <p>"I  believe you do mean it."</p>
  <p>"You  shall shoot me if I don't."</p>
  <p>"I  most certainly should. But my mate Howie has his obvious limitations. I've long  wanted a drop of new blood. Barmaid's thoroughbred and strong as an elephant;  we're neither of us heavyweights; by the powers, I'll trust you, and you shall  ride behind!"</p>
  <p>Now,  Barmaid was the milk-white mare that was only less notorious than her lawless  rider. It was noised in travellers' huts and around campfires that she would do  more at her master's word than had been known of horse outside a circus. It was  the one touch that Stingaree had borrowed from a more Napoleonic but  incomparably coarser and crueller knight of the bush. In all other respects the <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> desperado was unique. It was a stroke of luck, however,  that there happened to be an old white mare in the bank stables, which the  police had impounded with solemn care while turning every other animal adrift.  And so it fell out that not a shot followed the mounted bushrangers into the  night, and that long before the bank shutters were battered in the flying trio  were miles away.</p>
  <p>Fergus  flew like a runaway bride, his arms about the belted waist of Stingaree. Trees  loomed ahead and flew past by the clump under a wonderful wide sky of  scintillating stars. The broad bush track had very soon been deserted at a  tangent; through ridges and billows of salt-bush and cotton-bush they sailed  with the swift confidence of a well-handled clipper before the wind. Stingaree  was the leader four miles out of five, but in the fifth his mate Howie would  gallop ahead, and anon they would come on him dismounted at a wire fence, with  the wires strapped down and his horse tethered to one of the posts till he had  led Barmaid over.</p>
  <p>It  was thus they careered across the vast chessboard of the fenced back-blocks at  dead of night. Stingaree and Fergus sat saddle and bareback without a break  until near dawn their pioneer spurred forward yet again and was swallowed in a  steely haze. It was cold as a sharp spring night in England. But for a mile or  more Fergus had clung on with but one arm round the bushranger's waist; now the  right arm came stealing back; felt something cold for the fraction of a second,  and plucked prodigiously, and in another fraction an icy ring mouthed  Stingaree's neck.</p>
  <p>"Pull  up," said Fergus, hoarsely, "or your brains go flying."</p>
  <p>"Little  traitor!" whispered the other, with an imprecation that froze the blood.</p>
  <p>"I  am no traitor. I swore I wouldn't abuse the revolver you gave me, and it's been  in my pocket all the night."</p>
  <p>"The  other's unloaded."</p>
  <p>"You  wouldn't sit so quiet if it were. Now, round we go, and back on our tracks full  split. It's getting light, and we shall see them plain. If you vary a yard  either way, or if your mate catches us, out go your brains."</p>
  <p>The  bushranger obeyed without a word. Fergus was almost unnerved by the incredible  ease of his conquest over so redoubtable a ruffian. His stolid Scottish blood  stood by him; but still he made grim apology as they rode.</p>
  <p>"I  had to do it. It was through me you got to know. I had to live that down; this  was the only way."</p>
  <p>"You  have spirit. If you would still be my mate &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Your  mate! I mean this to be the making of me as an honest man. Here's the fence. I  give you two minutes to strap it down and get us over."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  slid tamely to the ground.</p>
  <p>"Don't  you dare to get through those wires! Strap it from this side with your belt,  and strap it quick!"</p>
  <p>And  the bushranger obeyed with the same sensible docility, but with his back  turned, so that Fergus could not see has face; and it was light enough to see  faces now; yet Barmaid refused the visible wires, as she had not refused them  all that night of indigo starlight.</p>
  <p>"Coax  her, man!" cried Fergus, in the saddle now, and urging the mare with his heels.  So Stingaree whispered in the mare's ear; and with that the strapped wires flew  under his captor's nose, as the rider took the fence, but not the horse.</p>
  <p>At  a single syllable the milk-white mare had gone on her knees, like devout lady  in holy fane; and as she rose her last rider lay senseless at her master's  feet; but whether from his fall, or from a blow dealt him in the act of  falling, the unhappy Fergus never knew. Indeed, knowledge for him was at an end  until matches burnt under his nose awakened him to a position of the last  humiliation. His throat and chin topped a fence-post, the weight of his body was  on chin and throat, while wrists and muscles were lashed at full stretch to the  wires on either side.</p>
  <p>"Now  I'm going to shoot you like a dog," said Stingaree. He drew the revolver whose  muzzle had pressed into his own neck so short a time before. Yet now it was  broad daylight, and the sun coming up in the bound youth's eyes for the last  time.</p>
  <p>"Shoot  away!" he croaked, raising the top of his head to speak at all. "I gave you  leave before we started. Shoot away!"</p>
  <p>"At  ten paces," said Stingaree, stepping them. "That, I think, is fair."</p>
  <p>"Perfectly,"  replied Fergus. "But be kind enough to make this so-called man of yours hold  his foul tongue till I'm out of earshot of you all."</p>
  <p>Huge  Howie had muttered little enough for him, but to that little Stingaree put an  instantaneous stop.</p>
  <p>"He's  a dog, to be shot like a dog, but too good a dog for you to blackguard!" cried  he. "Any message, young fellow?"</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1701251h-images/page066.jpg" width="492" height="750"></p>
  <p>"Not  through you."</p>
  <p>"So  long, then!"</p>
  <p>"Shoot  away!"</p>
  <p>The  long barrel was poised as steadily as a field-gun on its carriage. Fergus kept  his blue eyes on the gleaming ring of the muzzle.</p>
  <p>The  hammer fell, the cartridge cracked, and from the lifted muzzle a tiny cloud  flowed like a bubble from a pipe. The post quivered under Carrick's chin, and a  splinter flew up and down before his eyes. But that was all.</p>
  <p>"Aim  longer," said he. "Get it over this shot."</p>
  <p>"I'll  try."</p>
  <p>But  the same thing happened again.</p>
  <p>"Come  nearer," sneered Fergus.</p>
  <p>And  Stingaree strode forward with an oath.</p>
  <p>"I  was going to give you six of them. But you're a braver man than I thought. And  that's the lot."</p>
  <p>The  bound youth's livid face turned redder than the red dawn.</p>
  <p>"Shoot  me &mdash; shoot!" he shouted, like a lunatic.</p>
  <p>"No,  I shall not. I never meant to &mdash; I did mean you to sit out six &mdash; but you're the  most gallant little idiot I've ever struck. Besides, you come from the old  country, like myself!"</p>
  <p>And  a sigh floated into the keen morning air as he looked his last upon the lad  through the celebrated monocle.</p>
  <p>"Then  I'll shoot myself when I'm free," sobbed Fergus through his teeth.</p>
  <p>"Oh,  no, you won't," were Stingaree's last words. "You'll find it's not a bit worth  while."</p>
  <p>And  when the mounted police and others from Glenranald discovered the trussed  youngster, not an hour later, they took the same tone. And one and all stopped  and stooped to peer at the two bullet-holes in the post, and at something  underneath them, before cutting poor Fergus down.</p>
  <p>Then  they propped him up to read with his own eyes the nailed legend which first  helped Fergus Carrick to live down the indiscretion of his letter to Largs, and  then did more for him in that Colony than letter from Queen Victoria to His  Excellency of New South Wales. For it ran:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">"This is the gamest little cock I have ever struck. He had  me captive once, could have shot me over and over again, and all but took me  alive. More power to him!</p>
  <p class="note">"Stingaree."</p>

  "To the Vile Dust"</b></h2>
  <p>Vanheimert  had been in many duststorms, but never in such a storm so far from the haunts  of men. Awaking in his blanket with his mouth full of sand, he had opened his  eyes to the blinding sting of a storm which already shrouded the very tree  under which he lay. Other landmarks there were none; the world was swallowed in  a yellow swirl that turned browner and more opaque even as Vanheimert shook  himself out of his blanket and ran for the fence as for his life. He had only  left it in order to camp where his tree had towered against the stars; it could  not be a hundred yards away; and along the fence ran that beaten track to which  the bushman turned instinctively in his panic. In a few seconds he was groping  with outstretched hands to break the violence of a collision with invisible  wires; in a few minutes, standing at a loss, wondering where the wires or he  had got to, and whether it would not be wise to retrace his steps and try  again. And while he wondered a fit of coughing drove the dust from his mouth  like smoke; and even as he coughed the thickening swirl obliterated his tracks  as swiftly as heavy snow.</p>
  <p>Speckled  eyeballs stood out of a sanded face as Vanheimert saw himself adrift and  drowning in the dust. He was a huge young fellow, and it was a great smooth  face, from which the gaping mouth cut a slice from jaw to jaw. Terror and rage,  and an overpowering passion of self-pity, convulsed the coarse features in  turn; then, with the grunt of a wounded beast, he rallied and plunged to his  destruction, deeper and deeper into the bush, further and further from the  fence.</p>
  <p>The  trees were few and mostly stunted, but Vanheimert crashed into more than one  upon his headlong course. The sense was choked out of him already; he was  fleeing on the wings of the storm; of direction he thought no more. He forgot  that the run he had been traversing was at the best abandoned by man and beast;  he forgot the "spell" that he had promised himself at the deserted homestead  where he had once worked as a lad. He might have remembered that the paddock in  which he was burying himself had always been the largest in the district. It  was a ten-mile block without subdividing fence or drop of water from end to  end. The whole station was a howling desert, little likely to be stocked a  second time by enlightened man. But this was the desert's heart, and into it  sped Vanheimert, coated yellow to the eyes and lips, the dust-fiend himself in  visible shape. Now he staggered in his stride, now fell headlong to cough and  sob in the hollow of his arm. The unfortunate young man had the courage of his  desperate strait. Many times he arose and hurled himself onward with curse or  prayer; many times he fell or flung himself back to earth. But at length the  storm passed over and over his spent members; sand gathered by the handful in  the folds of his clothes; the end was as near as end could be.</p>
  <p>It  was just then that two riders, who fancied they had heard a voice, struck an  undoubted trail before it vanished, and followed it to the great sprawling body  in which the dregs of life pulsed feebly. The thing groaned as it was lifted  and strapped upon a horse; it gurgled gibberish at the taste of raw spirits  later in the same hour. It was high noon before Vanheimert opened a seeing eye  and blinked it in the unveiled sun.</p>
  <p>He  was lying on a blanket in a treeless hollow in the midst of trees. The ground  had been cleared by no human hand; it was a little basin of barren clay, burnt  to a brick, and drained by the tiny water-hole that sparkled through its thatch  of leaves and branches in the centre of a natural circle. Vanheimert lay on the  eastern circumference; it was the sun falling sheer on his upturned face that  cut short his sleep of deep exhaustion. The sky was a dark and limpid blue; but  every leaf within Vanheimert's vision bore its little load of sand, and the  sand was clotted as though the dust-storm had ended with the usual shower.  Vanheimert turned and viewed the sylvan amphitheatre; on its far side were two  small tents, and a man in a folding chair reading the <i>Australasian</i>. He  closed the paper on meeting Vanheimert's eyes, went to one of the tents, stood  a moment looking in, and then came across the sunlit circle with his newspaper  and the folded chair.</p>
  <p>"And  how do you feel now?" said he, setting up the chair beside the blanket, but  still standing as he surveyed the prostrate man, with dark eyes drawn together  in the shade of a great straw sombrero.</p>
  <p>"Fine!"  replied Vanheimert, huskily. "But where am I, and who are you chaps?  Rabbiters?"</p>
  <p>As  he spoke, however, he searched for the inevitable strings of rabbit skins  festooned about the tents, and found them not.</p>
  <p>"If  you like," replied the other, frowning a little at the immediate curiosity of  the rescued man.</p>
  <p>"I  don't like," said Vanheimert, staring unabashed. "I'm a rabbiter myself, and  know too much. It ain't no game for abandoned stations, and you don't go  playin' it in top-boots and spurs. Where's your skins and where's your squatter  to pay for 'em? Plucky rabbiters, you two!"</p>
  <p>And  he gazed across the open toward the further tent, which had just disgorged a  long body and a black beard not wholly unfamiliar to Vanheimert. The dark man  was a shade darker as he followed the look and read its partial recognition;  but a grim light came with quick resolve, and it was with sardonic deliberation  that an eye-glass was screwed into one dark eye.</p>
  <p>"Then  what should you say that we are?"</p>
  <p>"How  do I know?" cried Vanheimert, turning pale; for he had been one of the audience  at Mrs. Clarkson's concert in Gulland's store, and in consecutive moments he  had recognized first Howie and now Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"You  know well enough!"</p>
  <p>And  the terrible eye-glass covered him like a pistol.</p>
  <p>"Perhaps  I can guess," faltered Vanheimert, no small brain working in his prodigious  skull.</p>
  <p>"Guess,  then!"</p>
  <p>"There  are tales about a new chum camping by himself &mdash; that is, just with one man &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"And  what object?"</p>
  <p>"To  get away from the world, sir."</p>
  <p>"And  where did you hear these tales?"</p>
  <p>"All  along the road, sir."</p>
  <p>The  chastened tone, the anxious countenance, the sudden recourse to the servile  monosyllable, were none of them lost on Stingaree; but he himself had once set  such a tale abroad, and it might be that the present bearer still believed it.  The eye-glass looked him through and through. Vanheimert bore the inspection  like a man, and was soon satisfied that his recognition of the outlaw was as  yet quite unsuspected. He congratulated himself on his presence of mind, and  had sufficient courage to relish the excitement of a situation of which he also  perceived the peril.</p>
  <p>"I  suppose you have no recollection of how you got here?" at length said  Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"Not  me. I only remember the dust-storm." And Vanheimert shuddered where he lay in  the sun. "But I'm very grateful to you, sir, for saving my life."</p>
  <p>"You  are, are you?"</p>
  <p>"Haven't  I cause to be, sir?"</p>
  <p>"Well,  I dare say we did bring you round between us, but it was pure luck that we ever  came across you. And now I should lie quiet if I were you. In a few minutes  there'll be a pannikin of tea for you, and after that you'll feel a different  man."</p>
  <p>Vanheimert  lay quiet enough; there was much to occupy his mind. Instinctively he had  assumed a part, and he was only less quick to embrace the necessity of a  strictly consistent performance. He watched Stingaree in close conversation  with Howie, who was boiling the billy on a spirit-lamp between the two tents,  but he watched them with an admirable simulation of idle unconcern. They were  talking about him, of course; more than once they glanced in his direction; and  each time Vanheimert congratulated himself the more heartily on the ready  pretence to which he was committed. Let them but dream that he knew them, and  Vanheimert gave himself as short a shrift as he would have granted in their  place. But they did not dream it, they were off their guard, and rather at his  mercy than he at theirs. He might prove the immediate instrument of their  capture &mdash; why not? The thought put Vanheimert in a glow; on the blanket where  they had laid him, he dwelt on it without a qualm; and the same wide mouth  watered for the tea which these villains were making, and for their blood.</p>
  <p>It  was Howie who came over with the steaming pannikin, and watched Vanheimert as  he sipped and smacked his lips, while Stingaree at his distance watched them  both. The pannikin was accompanied by a tin-plate full of cold mutton and a  wedge of baking-powder bread, which between them prevented the ravening man  from observing how closely he was himself observed as he assuaged his pangs.  There was, however, something in the nature of a muttered altercation between  the bushrangers when Howie was sent back for more of everything. Vanheimert put  it down to his own demands, and felt that Stingaree was his friend when it was  he who brought the fresh supplies.</p>
  <p>"Eat  away," said Stingaree, seating himself and producing pipe and tobacco. "It's  rough fare, but there's plenty of it."</p>
  <p>"I  won't ask you for no more," replied Vanheimert, paving the way for his escape.</p>
  <p>"Oh,  yes, you will!" said Stingaree. "You're going to camp with us for the next few  days, my friend!"</p>
  <p>"Why  am I?" cried Vanheimert, aghast at the quiet statement, which it never occurred  to him to gainsay. Stingaree pared a pipeful of tobacco and rubbed it fine before  troubling to reply.</p>
  <p>"Because  the way out of this takes some finding, and what's the use of escaping an  unpleasant death one day if you go and die it the next? That's one reason,"  said Stingaree, "but there's another. The other reason is that, now you're  here, you don't go till I choose."</p>
  <p>Blue  wreaths of smoke went up with the words, which might have phrased either a  humorous hospitality or a covert threat. The dispassionate tone told nothing.  But Vanheimert felt the eye-glass on him, and his hearty appetite was at an  end.</p>
  <p>"That's  real kind of you," said he. "I don't feel like running no more risks till I'm  obliged. My nerves are shook. And if a born back-blocker may make so bold, it's  a fair old treat to see a new chum camping out for the fun of it!"</p>
  <p>"Who  told you I was a new chum?" asked Stingaree, sharply. "Ah! I remember," he  added, nodding; "you heard of me lower down the road."</p>
  <p>Vanheimert  grinned from ear to ear.</p>
  <p>"I'd  have known it without that," said he. "What real bushmen would boil their billy  on a spirit-lamp when there's wood and to spare for a camp-fire on all sides of  'em?"</p>
  <p>Now,  Vanheimert clearly perceived the superiority of smokeless spirit-lamp to  tell-tale fire for those in hiding; so he chuckled consumedly over this thrust,  which was taken in such excellent part by Stingaree as to prove him a victim to  the desired illusion. It was the cleverest touch that Vanheimert had yet  achieved. And he had the wit neither to blunt his point by rubbing it in nor to  recall attention to it by subtle protestation of his pretended persuasion. But  once or twice before sundown he permitted himself to ask natural questions  concerning the old country, and to indulge in those genial gibes which the  Englishman in the bush learns to expect from the indigenous buffoon.</p>
  <p>In  the night Vanheimert was less easy. He had to sleep in Howie's tent, but it was  some hours before he slept at all, for Howie would remain outside, and  Vanheimert longed to hear him snore. At last the rabbiter fell into a doze, and  when he awoke the auspicious music filled the tent. He listened on one elbow,  peering till the darkness turned less dense; and there lay Howie across the  opening of the tent. Vanheimert reached for his thin elastic-sided bushman's  boots, and his hands trembled as he drew them on. He could now see the form of  Howie plainly enough as it lay half in the starlight and half in the darkness  of the tent. He stepped over it without a mistake, and the ignoble strains  droned on behind him.</p>
  <p>The  stars seemed unnaturally bright and busy as Vanheimert stole into their  tremulous light. At first he could distinguish nothing earthly; then the tents  came sharply into focus, and after them the ring of impenetrable trees. The  trees whispered a chorus, myriads strong, in a chromatic scale that sang but  faintly of the open country. There were palpable miles of wilderness, and none  other lodge but this, yet the psychological necessity for escape was stronger  in Vanheimert than the bodily reluctance to leave the insecure security of the  bushrangers' encampment. He was their prisoner, whatever they might say, and  the sense of captivity was intolerable; besides, let them but surprise his  knowledge of their secret, and they would shoot him like a dog. On the other  hand, beyond the forest and along the beaten track lay fame and a fortune in  direct reward.</p>
  <p>Before  departure Vanheimert wished to peep into the other tent, but its open end was  completely covered in for the night, and prudence forbade him to meddle with  his hands. He had an even keener desire to steal one or other of the horses  which he had seen before nightfall tethered in the scrub; but here again he  lacked enterprise, fancied the saddles must be in Stingaree's tent, and shrank  from committing himself to an action which nothing, in the event of disaster,  could explain away. On foot he need not put himself in the wrong, even with  villains ready to suspect that he suspected them.</p>
  <p>And  on foot he went, indeed on tiptoe till the edge of the trees was reached  without adventure, and he turned to look his last upon the two tents shimmering  in the starlight. As he turned again, satisfied that the one was still shut and  that Howie still lay across the opening of the other, a firm hand took  Vanheimert by either shoulder; otherwise he had leapt into the air; for it was  Stingaree, who had stepped from behind a bush as from another planet, so  suddenly that Vanheimert nearly gasped his dreadful name.</p>
  <p>"I  couldn't sleep! I couldn't sleep!" he cried out instead, shrinking as from a  lifted hand, though he was merely being shaken playfully to and fro.</p>
  <p>"No  more could I," said Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"So  I was going for a stroll. That was all, I swear, Mr. &mdash; Mr. &mdash; I don't know your  name!"</p>
  <p>"Quite  sure?" said Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"My  oath! How should I?"</p>
  <p>"You  might have heard it down the road."</p>
  <p>"Not  me!"</p>
  <p>"Yet  you heard of me, you know."</p>
  <p>"Not  by name &mdash; my oath!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  peered into the great face in which the teeth were chattering and from which  all trace of color had flown.</p>
  <p>"I  shouldn't eat you for knowing who I am," said he. "Honesty is still a wise  policy in certain circumstances; but you know best."</p>
  <p>"I  know nothing about you, and care less," retorted Vanheimert, sullenly, though  the perspiration was welling out of him. "I come for a stroll because I  couldn't sleep, and I can't see what all this barney's about."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  dropped his hands.</p>
  <p>"Do  you want to sleep?"</p>
  <p>"My  blessed oath!"</p>
  <p>"Then  come to my tent, and I'll give you a nobbler that may make you."</p>
  <p>The  nobbler was poured out of a gallon jar, under Vanheimert's nose, by the light  of a candle which he held himself. Yet he smelt it furtively before trying it  with his lips, and denied himself a gulp till he was reassured. But soon the  empty pannikin was held out for more. And it was the starless hour before dawn  when Vanheimert tripped over Howie's legs and took a contented header into the  corner from which he had made his stealthy escape.</p>
  <p>The  tent was tropical when he awoke, but Stingaree was still at his breakfast  outside in the shade. He pointed to a bucket and a piece of soap behind the tent,  and Vanheimert engaged in obedient ablutions before sitting down to his  pannikin, his slice of damper, and his portion of a tin of sardines.</p>
  <p>"Sorry  there's no meat for you," said Stingaree. "My mate's gone for fresh supplies.  By the way, did you miss your boots?"</p>
  <p>The  rabbiter looked at a pair of dilapidated worsted socks and at one protruding  toe; he was not sure whether he had gone to bed for the second time in these or  in his boots. Certainly he had missed the latter on his second awakening, but  had not deemed it expedient to make inquiries. And now he merely observed that  he wondered where he could have left them.</p>
  <p>"On  your feet," said Stingaree. "My mate has made so bold as to borrow them for the  day."</p>
  <p>"He's  welcome to them, I'm sure," said Vanheimert with a sickly smile.</p>
  <p>"I  was sure you would say so," rejoined Stingaree. "His own are reduced to uppers  and half a heel apiece, but he hopes to get them soled in Ivanhoe while he  waits."</p>
  <p>"So  he's gone to Ivanhoe, has he?"</p>
  <p>"He's  been gone three hours."</p>
  <p>"Surely  it's a long trip?"</p>
  <p>"Yes;  we shall have to make the most of each other till sundown," said Stingaree,  gazing through his glass upon Vanheimert's perplexity. "If I were you I should  take my revenge by shaking anything of his that I could find for the day."</p>
  <p>And  with a cavalier nod, to clinch the last word on the subject, the bushranger  gave himself over to his camp-chair, his pipe, and his inexhaustible <i>Australasian</i>.  As for Vanheimert, he eventually returned to the tent in which he had spent the  night; and there he remained a good many minutes, though it was now the  forenoon, and the heat under canvas past endurance. But when at length he  emerged, as from a bath, Stingaree, seated behind his <i>Australasian</i> in  the lee of the other tent, took so little notice of him that Vanheimert crept  back to have one more look at the thing which he had found in the old valise  which served Howie for a pillow. And the thing was a very workmanlike revolver,  with a heavy cartridge in each of its six chambers.</p>
  <p>Vanheimert  handled it with trembling fingers, and packed it afresh in the pocket where it  least affected his personal contour, its angles softened by a big bandanna  handkerchief, only to take it out yet again with a resolution that opened a  fresh sluice in every pore. The blanket that had been lent to him, and Howie's  blanket, both lay at his feet; he threw one over either arm, and with the  revolver thus effectually concealed, but grasped for action with finger on  trigger, sallied forth at last.</p>
  <p>Stingaree  was still seated in the narrowing shade of his own tent. Vanheimert was within  five paces of him before he looked up so very quickly, with such a rapid  adjustment of the terrible eye-glass, that Vanheimert stood stock-still, and  the butt of his hidden weapon turned colder than ever in his melting hand.</p>
  <p>"Why,  what have you got there?" cried Stingaree. "And what's the matter with you,  man?" he added, as Vanheimert stood shaking in his socks.</p>
  <p>"Only  his blankets, to camp on," the fellow answered, hoarsely. "You advised me to  help myself, you know."</p>
  <p>"Quite  right; so I did; but you're as white as the tent &mdash; you tremble like a leaf.  What's wrong?"</p>
  <p>"My  head," replied Vanheimert, in a whine. "It's going round and round, either from  what I had in the night, or lying too long in the hot tent, or one on top of  the other. I thought I'd camp for a bit in the shade."</p>
  <p>"I  should," said Stingaree, and buried himself in his paper with undisguised  contempt.</p>
  <p>Vanheimert  came a step nearer. Stingaree did not look up again. The revolver was levelled  under one trailing blanket. But the trigger was never pulled. Vanheimert feared  to miss even at arm's length, so palsied was his hand, so dim his eye; and when  he would have played the man and called desperately on the other to surrender,  the very tongue clove in his head.</p>
  <p>He  slunk over to the shady margin of surrounding scrub and lay aloof all the  morning, now fingering the weapon in his pocket, now watching the man who never  once looked his way. He was a bushranger and an outlaw; he deserved to die or  to be taken; and Vanheimert's only regret was that he had neither taken nor  shot him at their last interview. The bloodless alternative was to be borne in  mind, yet in his heart he well knew that the bullet was his one chance with  Stingaree. And even with the bullet he was horribly uncertain and afraid. But  of hesitation on any higher ground, of remorse or of reluctance, or the desire  to give fair play, he had none at all. The man whom he had stupidly spared so  far was a notorious criminal with a high price upon his head. It weighed not a  grain with Vanheimert that the criminal happened to have saved his life.</p>
  <p>"Come  and eat," shouted Stingaree at last; and Vanheimert trailed the blankets over  his left arm, his right thrust idly into his pocket, which bulged with a red  bandanna handkerchief. "Sorry it's sardines again," the bushranger went on,  "but we shall make up with a square feed to-night if my mate gets back by dark;  if he doesn't, we may have to tighten our belts till morning. Fortunately,  there's plenty to drink. Have some whiskey in your tea?"</p>
  <p>Vanheimert  nodded, and with an eye on the bushranger, who was once more stooping over his  beloved <i>Australasian</i>, helped himself enormously from the gallon jar.</p>
  <p>"And  now for a siesta," yawned Stingaree, rising and stretching himself after the  meal.</p>
  <p>"Hear,  hear!" croaked Vanheimert, his great face flushed, his bloodshot eyes on fire.</p>
  <p>"I  shall camp on the shady side of my tent."</p>
  <p>"And  I'll do ditto at the other."</p>
  <p>"So  long, then."</p>
  <p>"So  long."</p>
  <p>"Sweet  repose to you!"</p>
  <p>"Same  to you," rasped Vanheimert, and went off cursing and chuckling in his heart by  turns.</p>
  <p>It  was a sweltering afternoon of little air, and that little as hot and dry in the  nostrils as the atmosphere of a laundry on ironing day. Beyond and above the  trees a fiery blast blew from the north; but it was seldom a wandering puff  stooped to flutter the edges of the tents in the little hollow among the trees.  And into this empty basin poured a vertical sun, as if through some giant lens  which had burnt a hole in the heart of the scrub. Lulled by the faint perpetual  murmur of leaf and branch, without a sound from bird or beast to break its  soothing monotone, the two men lay down within a few yards, though out of  sight, of each other. And for a time all was very still.</p>
  <p>Then  Vanheimert rose slowly, without a sound, and came on tiptoe to the other tent,  his right hand in the pocket where the bandanna handkerchief had been but was  no longer. He came close up to the sunny side of the tent and listened vainly  for a sound. But Stingaree lay like a log in the shade on the far side, his  face to the canvas and his straw sombrero tilted over it. And so Vanheimert  found him, breathing with the placid regularity of a sleeping child.</p>
  <p>Vanheimert  looked about him; only the ring of impenetrable trees and the deep blue eye of  Heaven would see what really happened. But as to what exactly was to happen  Vanheimert himself was not clear as he drew the revolver ready cocked; even he  shrank from shooting a sleeping man; what he desired and yet feared was a  sudden start, a semblance of resistance, a swift, justifiable shot. And as his  mind's eye measured the dead man at his feet, the live man turned slowly over  on his back.</p>
  <p>It  was too much for Vanheimert's nerves. The revolver went off in his hands. But it  was only a cap that snapped, and another, and another, as he stepped back  firing desperately. Stingaree sat upright, looking his treacherous enemy in the  eye, through the glass in which, it seemed, he slept. And when the sixth cap  snapped as harmlessly as the other five, Vanheimert caught the revolver by its  barrel to throw or to strike. But the raised arm was seized from behind by  Howie, who had crept from the scrub at the snapping of the first cap; at the  same moment Stingaree sprang upon him; and in less than a minute Vanheimert lay  powerless, grinding his teeth, foaming and bleeding at the mouth, and filling  the air with nameless imprecations.</p>
  <p>The  bushrangers let him curse; not a word did they bandy with him or with each  other. Their action was silent, swift, concerted, prearranged. They lashed  their prisoner's wrists together, lashed his elbows to his ribs, hobbled his  ankles, and tethered him to a tree by the longest and the stoutest of their  many ropes. The tree was the one under which Vanheimert had found himself the  day before; in the afternoon it was exposed to the full fury of the sun; and in  the sun they left him, quieter already, but not so quiet as they. It was near  sundown when they returned to look upon a broken man, crouching in his toils like  a beaten beast, with undying malice in his swollen eyes. Stingaree sat at his  prisoner's feet, offered him tobacco without a sneer, and lit up his own when  the offer was declined with a curse.</p>
  <p>"When  we came upon you yesterday morning in the storm, one of us was for leaving you  to die in your tracks," began Stingaree. He was immediately interrupted by his  mate.</p>
  <p>"That  was me!" cried Howie, with a savage satisfaction.</p>
  <p>"It  doesn't matter which of us it was," continued Stingaree; "the other talked him  over; we put you on one of our horses, and we brought you more dead than alive  to the place which no other man has seen since we took a fancy to it. We saved  your miserable life, I won't say at the risk of our own, but at risk enough  even if you had not recognized us. We were going to see you through, whether  you knew us or not; before this we should have set you on the road from which  you had strayed. I thought you must know us by sight, but when you denied it I  saw no reason to disbelieve you. It only dawned on me by degrees that you were  lying, though Howie here was sure of it.</p>
  <p>"I  still couldn't make out your game; if it was funk I could have understood it;  so I tried to get you to own up in the night. I let you see that we didn't mind  whether you knew us or not, and yet you persisted in your lie. So then I smelt  something deeper. But we had gone out of our way to save your life. It never  struck me that you might go out of your way to take ours!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  paused, smoking his pipe.</p>
  <p>"But  it did me!" cried Howie.</p>
  <p>"I  never meant taking your lives," muttered Vanheimert. "I meant taking you &mdash; as  you deserved."</p>
  <p>"We  scarcely deserved it of you; but that is a matter of opinion. As for taking us  alive, no doubt you would have preferred to do so if it had seemed equally safe  and easy; you had not the pluck to run a single risk. You were given every  chance. I sent Howie into the scrub, took the powder out of six cartridges, and  put what anybody would have taken for a loaded revolver all but into your  hands. I sat at your mercy, quite looking forward to the sensation of being  stuck up for a change. If you had stuck me up like a man," said Stingaree,  reflectively examining his pipe, "you might have lived to tell the tale."</p>
  <p>There  was an interval of the faint, persistent rustling of branch and leaf, varied by  the screech of a distant cockatoo and the nearer cry of a crow, as the dusk  deepened into night as expeditiously as on the stage. Vanheimert was not awed  by the quiet voice to which he had been listening. It lacked the note of  violence which he understood; it even lulled him into a belief that he would  still live to tell the tale. But in the dying light he looked up, and in the  fierce unrelenting face, made the more sinister by its foppish furniture, he  read his doom.</p>
  <p>"You  tried to shoot me in my sleep," said Stingaree, speaking slowly, with intense  articulation. "That's your gratitude! You will live just long enough to wish  that you had shot yourself instead!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  rose.</p>
  <p>"You  may as well shoot me now!" cried Vanheimert, with a husky effort.</p>
  <p>"Shoot  you? I'm not going to <i>shoot</i> you at all; shooting's too good for scum  like you. But you are to die &mdash; make no mistake about that. And soon; but not  to-night. That would not be fair on you, for reasons which I leave to your  imagination. You will lie where you are to-night; and you will be watched and  fed like your superiors in the condemned cell. The only difference is that I  can't tell you when it will be. It might be tomorrow &mdash; I don't think it will &mdash;  but you may number your days on the fingers of both hands."</p>
  <p>So  saying, Stingaree turned on his heel, and was lost to sight in the shades of  evening before he reached his tent. But Howie remained on duty with the  condemned man.</p>
  <p>As  such Vanheimert was treated from the first hour of his captivity. Not a rough  word was said to him; and his own unbridled outbursts were received with as  much indifference as the abject prayers and supplications which were their  regular reaction. The ebbing life was ordered on that principle of high  humanity which might be the last refinement of calculated cruelty. The prisoner  was so tethered to such a tree that it was no longer necessary for him to spend  a moment in the red eye of the sun. He could follow a sufficient shade from  dawn to dusk. His boots were restored to him; a blanket was permitted him day  and night; but night and day he was sedulously watched, and neither knife nor  fork was provided with his meals. His fare was relatively not inferior to that  of the legally condemned, whose notorious privileges and restrictions served  the bushrangers for a model.</p>
  <p>And  Vanheimert clung to the hope of a reprieve with all the sanguine tenacity of  his ill-starred class, though it did seem with more encouragement on the whole.  For the days went on, and each of many mornings brought its own respite till  the next. The welcome announcement was invariably made by Howie after a  colloquy with his chief, which Vanheimert watched with breathless interest for  a day or two, but thereafter with increasing coolness. They were trying to  frighten him; they did not mean it, any more than Stingaree had meant to shoot  the new chum who had the temerity to put a pistol to his head after the affair  of the Glenranald bank. The case of lucky Fergus, justly celebrated throughout  the colony, was a great comfort to Vanheimert's mind; he could see but little  difference between the two; but if his treachery was the greater, so also was  the ordeal to which he was being subjected. For in the light of a mere ordeal  he soon regarded what he was invited to consider as his last days on earth, and  in the conviction that they were not, began suddenly to bear them like a man.  This change of front produced its fellow in Stingaree, who apologized to  Vanheimert for the delay, which he vowed he could not help. Vanheimert was a  little shaken by his manner, though he smiled behind the bushranger's back. And  he could scarcely believe his ears when, the very next morning, Howie told him  that his hour was come.</p>
  <p>"Rot!"  said Vanheimert, with a confident expletive.</p>
  <p>"Oh,  all right," said Howie. "But if you don't believe me, I'm sorrier for you than  I was."</p>
  <p>He  slouched away, but Vanheimert had no stomach for the tea and damper which had  been left behind. It was unusual for him to be suffered to take a meal  unwatched; something unusual was in the air. Stingaree emerged from the scrub  leading the two horses. Vanheimert began to figure the fate that might be in  store for him. And the horses, saddled and bridled before his eyes, were led  over to where he sat.</p>
  <p>"Are  you going to shoot me before you go," he cried, "or are you going to leave me  to die alone?"</p>
  <p>"Neither,  here," said Stingaree. "We're too fond of the camp."</p>
  <p>It  was his first brutal speech, but the brutality was too subtle for Vanheimert.  He was beginning to feel that something dreadful might happen to him after all.  The pinions were removed from his arms and legs, the long rope detached from  the tree and made fast to one of Stingaree's stirrups instead. And by it  Vanheimert was led a good mile through the scrub, with Howie at his heels.</p>
  <p>A  red sun had risen on the camp, but in the scrub it ceased to shine, and the  first open space was as sunless as the dense bush. Spires of sand kept whirling  from earth to sky, joining other spinning spires, forming a monster balloon of  yellow sand, a balloon that swelled until it burst, obscuring first the  firmament and then the earth. But the mind of Vanheimert was so busy with the  fate he feared that he did not realize he was in another dust-storm until  Stingaree, at the end of the rope, was swallowed like a tug in a fog. And even  then Vanheimert's peculiar terror of a dust-storm did not link itself to the  fear of sudden death which had at last been put into him. But the moment of  mental enlightenment was at hand.</p>
  <p>The  rope trailed on the ground as Stingaree loomed large and yellow through the  storm. He had dropped his end. Vanheimert glanced over his shoulder, and Howie  loomed large and yellow behind him.</p>
  <p>"You  will now perceive the reason for so many days' delay," said Stingaree. "I have  been waiting for such a dust-storm as the one from which we saved you, to be  rewarded as you endeavored to reward me. You might, perhaps, have preferred me  to make shorter work of you, but on consideration you will see that this is not  only just but generous. The chances are perhaps against you, and somewhat in  favor of a more unpleasant death; but it is quite possible that the storm may  pass before it finishes you, and that you may then hit the fence before you die  of thirst, and at the worst we leave you no worse off than we found you. And  that, I hold, is more than you had any right to expect. So long!"</p>
  <p>The  thickening storm had swallowed man and horse once more. Vanheimert looked  round. The second man and the second horse had also vanished. And his own tracks  were being obliterated as fast as footmarks in blinding snow. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  A Bushranger at Bay</b></h2>
  <p>The  Hon. Guy Kentish was trotting the globe &mdash; an exercise foreign to his habit &mdash;  when he went on to Australia for a reason racy of his blood. He wished to  witness a certain game of cricket between the full strength of Australia and an  English team which included one or two young men of his acquaintance. It was no  part of his original scheme to see anything of the country; one of the  Australian cricketers put that idea into his head; and it was under inward  protest that Mr. Kentish found himself smoking his chronic cigar on the  Glenranald and Clear Corner coach one scorching morning in the month of  February. He thought he had never seen such a howling desert in his life; and  it is to be feared that in his heart he applied the same epithet to his two  fellow-passengers. The one outside was chatting horribly with the driver; the  other had tried to chaff the Hon. Guy, and had repaired in some disorder to the  company of the mail-bags inside. Kentish wondered whether these were the types  he might expect to encounter upon the station to which he had reluctantly  accepted an officious introduction. He wished himself out of the absurd little  two-horse coach, out of an expedition whose absurdity was on a larger scale,  and back again on the shady side of the two or three streets where he lived his  normal life. The fare at wayside inns made the thought of his club a positive  pain; and these pangs were at their sharpest when Stingaree cantered out of the  scrub on his lily mare, a blessed bolt from the blue.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1701251h-images/page098.jpg" width="468" height="750"></p>
  <p>Mr.  Kentish watched the little operation of "sticking up" without a word, but with  revived interest in life. He noted the pusillanimous pallor of the driver and  his friend, and felt personally indebted to the desperado who had put a stop to  their unpleasant conversation. The inside passenger made a yet more obsequious  surrender. Not that the trio were set any better example by their noble ally,  who began by smiling at the whole affair, and was content to the last in taking  an observant interest in the bushranger's methods. These were simple and in a  sense humane; there was no personal robbery at all. The mail-bags were  sufficient for Stingaree, who on this occasion worked alone, but led a  pack-horse, to which the driver and the inside passenger were compelled to  strap the long canvas bags, under his eye-glass and his long revolver. Few  words were spoken from first to last; the Hon. Guy never put in his at all; but  he watched the outlaw like a lynx, without betraying an undue attention, and  when all was over he gave a sigh.</p>
  <p>"So  that's Stingaree!" he said, more to himself than to his comrades in  humiliation; but the bushranger had cantered back into the scrub, and his name  opened the flood-gates of a profanity which made Kentish wince, for all his  knowledge of the world.</p>
  <p>"Do  you never swear at him till he has gone?" he asked when he had a chance. The  driver leant across the legs of his friend.</p>
  <p>"Not  unless we want a bullet through our skulls," he answered in boorish derision;  and the man between them laughed harshly.</p>
  <p>"I  thought he had never been known to shoot?"</p>
  <p>"That's  just it, mister. We don't want him to begin on us."</p>
  <p>"Why  didn't <i>you</i> give him a bit of <i>your</i> mind?" the man in the middle  inquired of Kentish. "I never heard you open your gills!"</p>
  <p>"And  we expected to see some pluck from the old country," added the driver, wreaking  vengeance with his lash.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Kentish produced his cigar-case with an insensitive smile, and, after a  moment's deliberation, handed it for the first time to his uncouth companions.  "Do you want those mail-bags back?" he asked, quite casually, when the three  cigars were in blast.</p>
  <p>"Want  them? Of course I want them; but want must be my boss," said the driver,  gloomily.</p>
  <p>"I'm  not so sure," said Kentish. "When does the next coach pass this way?"</p>
  <p>"Midnight,  and I drive it. I turn back when I get to Clear Corner, you see."</p>
  <p>"Then  look out for me about this spot. I'm going to ask you to put me down."</p>
  <p>"Put  you down?"</p>
  <p>"If  you don't mind pulling up. I'm not going on at present; but I'll go back with  you to Glenranald instead, if you'll keep a lookout for me to-night."</p>
  <p>Instinctively  the driver put his foot upon the brake, for the request had been made with that  quiet authority which this silent passenger had suddenly assumed; and yet it  seemed to them such a mad demand that his companions looked at Kentish as they  had not looked before. His face bore a close inspection; it was one of those  which burn red, and in the redness twinkled hazel eyes that toned agreeably  with a fair beard and fairer mustache. The former he had grown upon his  travels; but the trail of the West-end tailor, whose shooting-jacket is as  distinctive as his frock-coat, was upon Guy Kentish from head to heel. As they  watched him he took an open envelope from his pocket, scribbled a few words on  a card, put that in, and stuck down the flap.</p>
  <p>"Here,"  said he, "is my letter of introduction to the good people at the Mazeppa  Station higher up. If I don't turn up to-night, see that they get it, even if  it costs you a bit of this?"</p>
  <p>And,  putting a sovereign in a startled palm, he jumped to the ground.</p>
  <p>"But  what are you going to do, sir?" cried the driver, in alarm.</p>
  <p>"Recover  your mail-bags if I can."</p>
  <p>"What?  After you've just been stuck up &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Exactly.  I hope to stick up Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>"Then  you were armed all the time?"</p>
  <p>Mr.  Kentish smiled as he shook his head.</p>
  <p>"That's  my affair, I imagine; but even so I am not fool enough to tackle such a fellow  with his own weapons. You leave it to me, and don't be anxious. But I must be  off if I'm to stalk him before he goes through the letters. No, I know what I'm  doing, and I shall do better alone. Till to-night, then!"</p>
  <p>And  he was in the scrub ere they decided to take him at his madcap word, and let his  blood be on the chuckle-head of the new-chummiest new chum that ever came out  after the rain! Was it pluck or all pretence? It was rather plucky even to  pretend in such proximity to the terrible Stingaree; on the whole, the coaching  trio were disposed to concede a certain amount of unequivocal courage; and the  driver, with Kentish's sovereign in his pocket, went so far as to declare that  duty alone nailed him to the box.</p>
  <p>Meantime  the Hon. Guy had skirted the road until he came to double horse-tracks striking  back into the bush; these he followed with the wary stealth of one who had  spent his autumns, at least, in the right place. They led him through belts of  scrub in which he trod like a cat, without disturbing an avoidable branch, and  over treeless spaces that he crossed at a run, bent double; but always, as he  followed the trail, his shadow fell at one consistent angle, showing how the  bushranger rode through his natural element as the crow might have flown  overhead.</p>
  <p>At  last Kentish found himself in a sandy gully bristling with pines, through which  the sunlight dripped like melted gold; and in the fine warp and woof of high  light and sharp shadow the bushranger's horses stood lashing at the flies with  their long tails. The bushranger himself was nowhere to be seen. But at last  Kentish descried a white-and-brown litter on either side of the thickest trunk  in sight, from whose further side floated intermittent puffs of thin blue  smoke. Kentish looked and looked again before advancing. But the tall pine threw  such a shadow as should easily swallow his own. And in another minute he was  peeping round the hole.</p>
  <p>The  litter on either side was, of course, the shower of miscellaneous postal matter  from the mail-bags; and in its midst sat Stingaree against the tree, enjoying  his pipe and a copy of <i>Punch</i>, of which the wrapper lay upon his knees.  Kentish peered for torn envelopes and gaping packets; there were no more. The  bushranger had evidently started with <i>Punch</i>, and was still curiously  absorbed in its contents. The notorious eye-glass dangled against that kindred  vanity, the spotless white jacket which he affected in summer-time; the brown,  attentive face, even as Kentish saw it in less than profile, was thus purged of  the sinister aspect which such an appendage can impart to the most innocent;  and a somewhat passive amusement was its unmistakable note. Nevertheless, the  long revolver which had once more done its nefarious work still lay ready to  his hand; indeed, the Hon. Guy could have stooped and whipped it up, had he  been so minded.</p>
  <p>He  was absorbed, however, in the absorption of Stingaree; and as he peered  audaciously over the other's shoulder he put himself in the outlaw's place. An  old friend would have lurked in every cut, a friend whom it might well be a  painful pleasure to meet again. There were the oval face and the short upper  lip of one imperishable type; on the next page one of <i>Punch's</i> Fancy  Portraits, with lines underneath which set Stingaree incongruously humming a  stave from <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i>. Mr. Kentish smiled without surprise. The  common folk in the omnibus opposite were the common folk of an inveterate  master; there was matter for a homesick sigh in his hint of streaming streets &mdash;  and Kentish thought he heard one as he held his breath. The page after that  detained the reader some minutes. The illustrations proclaimed it an article on  the new Savoy opera, and Stingaree confirmed the impression by humming more <i>Pinafore</i> when he came to the end. Kentish left him at it, and, creeping away as silently  as he had come, described a circle and came noisily on the bushranger from the  front. The result was that Stingaree was not startled into firing, but stopped  the intruder at due distance with his revolver levelled across the open copy of <i>Punch</i>.</p>
  <p>"I  heard you singing <i>Pinafore</i>," cried Kentish, cheerily. "And I find you  reading <i>Punch</i>!"</p>
  <p>"How  dare you find me?" demanded the bushranger, black with passion.</p>
  <p>"I  thought you wouldn't mind. I am perfectly innocuous &mdash; look!"</p>
  <p>And,  divesting himself of his shooting-coat, he tossed it across for the other's  inspection; he wore neither waistcoat nor hip-pocket, and his innocence of arms  was manifest when he had turned round slowly where he stood.</p>
  <p>"Now  may I not come a little nearer?" asked the Hon. Guy.</p>
  <p>"No;  keep your distance, and tell me why you have come so far. The truth, mind, or  you'll be shot!"</p>
  <p>"Very  well," said Kentish. "They were dreadful people on the coach &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Are  they waiting for you?" thundered Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"No;  they've gone on; and they think me mad."</p>
  <p>"So  you are."</p>
  <p>"We  shall see; meanwhile I prefer your company to theirs, and mean to enjoy it up  to the moment of my murder."</p>
  <p>For  an instant Stingaree seemed on the brink of a smile; then his dark face  hardened, and he tapped the long barrel in rest between his knees.</p>
  <p>"You  may call it murder if you like," said he. "That will not prevent me from  shooting you dead unless you speak the truth. You have come for something; what  is it?"</p>
  <p>"I've  told you already. I was bored and disgusted. That is the truth."</p>
  <p>"But  not the whole truth," cried Stingaree. "You had some other reason."</p>
  <p>Kentish  looked down without speaking. He heard the revolver cocked.</p>
  <p>"Come,  let us have it, or I'll shoot you like the spy I believe you are!"</p>
  <p>"You  may shoot me for telling you," said Kentish, with a quiet laugh and shrug.</p>
  <p>"No,  I shall not, unless it turns out that you're ground-bait for the police."</p>
  <p>"That  I am not," said Kentish, growing serious in his turn. "But, since you insist, I  have come to persuade you to give up every one of these letters which you have  no earthly right to touch."</p>
  <p>Their  eyes met. Stingaree's were the wider open, and in an instant the less stern. He  dropped his revolver, with a laugh, into its old place at his side.</p>
  <p>"Mad  or sane," said he, "I shall be under the unpleasant necessity of leaving you  rather securely tied to one of these trees."</p>
  <p>"I  don't believe you will," returned Kentish, without losing a shade of his rich  coloring. "But in any case I suppose we may have a chat first? I give you my  word that you are safe from further intrusion to the level best of my knowledge  and belief. May I sit down instead of standing?"</p>
  <p>"You  may."</p>
  <p>"We  are a good many yards apart."</p>
  <p>"You  may reduce them by half. There."</p>
  <p>"I  thank you," said Kentish, seating himself tailorwise within arm's length of  Stingaree's spurs. "Now, if you will feel in the breast-pocket of my coat you  will find a case of very fair cigars &mdash; J.&nbsp;S. Murias &mdash; not too strong. I  shall be honored if you will help yourself and throw me one."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  took the one, and handed the case with no ungraceful acknowledgment to its  owner; but before Mr. Kentish could return the courtesy by proffering his  cigar-cutter, the bushranger had produced his razor from a pocket of the white  jacket, and sliced off the end with that.</p>
  <p>"So  you shave every day in the wilds," remarked the other, handing his match-box  instead. "And I gave it up on my voyage."</p>
  <p>"I  alter myself from time to time," said Stingaree, as he struck a light.</p>
  <p>"It  must be a wonderful life!"</p>
  <p>But  Stingaree lit up without a word, and Kentish had the wit to do the same. They  smoked in silence for some minutes. A gray ash had grown on each cigar before  Kentish demanded an opinion of the brand.</p>
  <p>"To  tell you the truth," said Stingaree, "I have smoked strong trash so many years  that I can scarcely taste it."</p>
  <p>And  he peered rather pathetically through his glass.</p>
  <p>"Didn't  the same apply to <i>Punch</i>?"</p>
  <p>"No;  I have always read the papers when I could," said Stingaree, and suddenly he  was smiling. "That's one reason why I make a specialty of sticking up the  mail," he explained.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Kentish was not to be drawn into a second deliverance on the bushranging  career. "Is it a good number?" he asked, nodding toward the copy of <i>Punch</i>.  The bushranger picked it up.</p>
  <p>"Good  enough for me."</p>
  <p>"What  date?"</p>
  <p>"Ninth  of December."</p>
  <p>"Nearly  three months ago. I was in London then," remarked Kentish, in a reflective  tone.</p>
  <p>"Really?"  cried Stingaree, under his breath. His voice was as soft as the other's, but  there was suppressed interest in his manner. His dark eyes were only less  alight than the red cigar he took from his teeth as he spoke. And he held it  like a connoisseur, between finger and thumb, for all his ruined palate.</p>
  <p>"I  was," repeated Kentish. "I didn't sail till the middle of the month."</p>
  <p>"To  think you were in town till nearly Christmas!" and Stingaree gazed enviously.  "It must be hard to realize," he added in some haste.</p>
  <p>"Other  things," replied Kentish, "are harder."</p>
  <p>"I  gather from the <i>Punch</i> cartoon that the new Law Courts are in use at  last?"</p>
  <p>"I  was at the opening."</p>
  <p>"Then  you may have seen this opera that I have been reading about?"</p>
  <p>Kentish  asked what it was, although he knew.</p>
  <p>"<i>Iolanthe.</i>"</p>
  <p>"Rather!  I was there the first night."</p>
  <p>"The  deuce you were!" cried Stingaree; and for the next quarter of an hour this  armed scoundrel, the terror of a district as large as England and Wales, talked  of nothing else to the man whom he was about to bind to a tree. Was the new  opera equal to its predecessors? Which were the best numbers? Did <i>Punch</i> do it justice, or was there some jealousy in that rival hot-bed of wit and  wisdom?</p>
  <p>Unfortunately,  Guy Kentish had no ear for music, but he made a clear report of the plot, could  repeat some of the Lord Chancellor's quips, and was in decided disagreement  with the captious banter from which he was given more than one extract. And in  default of one of the new airs Stingaree rounded off the subject by dropping  once more into&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">"For  he might have been a Rooshian,<br>
  A  French, or Turk, or Prooshian,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or,  perhaps, I-tal-i-an!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or,  perhaps, I-tal-i-an!<br>
  But  in spite of all temptations<br>
  To  belong to other nations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  remains an Englishman!"</p>
  <p>"I  understand that might be said of both of us," remarked Kentish, looking the  outlaw boldly in the eyes. "But from all accounts I should have thought you  were out here before the days of Gilbert and Sullivan."</p>
  <p>"So  I was," replied Stingaree, without frown or hesitation. "But you may also have  heard that I am fond of music &mdash; any I can get. My only opportunities, as a  rule," the bushranger continued, smiling mischievously at his cigar, "occur on  the stations I have occasion to visit from time to time. On one a good lady  played and sang <i>Pinafore</i> and <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i> to me from  dewy eve to dawn. I'm bound to say I sang some of it at sight myself; and I  flatter myself it helped to pass an embarrassing night rather pleasantly for  all concerned. We had all hands on the place for our audience, and when I left  I was formally presented with both scores; for I had simply called for horses,  and horses were all I took. Only the other day I had the luck to confiscate a  musical-box which plays selections from <i>The Pirates</i>. I ought to have had  it with me in my swag."</p>
  <p>So  affable and even charming was the quiet voice, so evident the appreciation of  the last inch of the cigar which had thawed a frozen palate, and so conceivable  a further softening, that Guy Kentish made bolder than before. He knew what he  meant to do; he knew how he meant to do it. And yet it seemed just possible  there might be a gentler way.</p>
  <p>"You  don't always take things, I believe?" he hazarded.</p>
  <p>"You  mean after sticking up?"</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"Generally,  I fear; it's the whole meaning of the act," confessed Stingaree, still the  dandy in tone and phrase. "But there have been exceptions."</p>
  <p>"Exactly!"  quoth Kentish. "And there's going to be another this afternoon!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  hurled the stump of his cigar into the scrub, and without a word the villain  was born again, with his hard eyes, his harder mouth, his sinister scowl, his  crag of a chin.</p>
  <p>"So  you come back to that," he cried, harshly. "I thought you had more sense; you  will make me tie you up before your time."</p>
  <p>"You  may do exactly what you like," retorted Kentish, a galling scorn in his  unaltered voice. "Only, before you do it, you may as well know who I am."</p>
  <p>"My  good sir, do you suppose I care who you are?" asked Stingaree, with an angry  laugh: and his anger is the rarest thing in all his annals.</p>
  <p>"I  am quite sure you don't," responded Kentish. "But you may as well know my name,  even though you never heard it before." And he gave it with a touch of triumph,  not for one moment to be confounded with a natural pride.</p>
  <p>The  bushranger stared him steadily in the eyes; his hand had dropped once more upon  the butt of his revolver. "No; I never did hear it before," he said.</p>
  <p>"I'm  not surprised," replied the other. "I was a new member when you were turned out  of the club." Stingaree's hand closed: his eyes were terrible. "And yet,"  continued Kentish, "the moment I saw you at close quarters in the road I  recognized you as &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Stingaree!"  cried the bushranger, on a rich and vibrant note. "Let the other name pass your  lips &mdash; even here &mdash; and it's the last word that ever will!"</p>
  <p>"Very  well," said Mr. Kentish, with his unaffected shrug. "But, you see, I know all  about you."</p>
  <p>"You're  the only man who does, in all Australia!" exclaimed the outlaw, hoarsely.</p>
  <p>"At  present! I sha'n't be the only man long."</p>
  <p>"You  will," said Stingaree through teeth and mustache; and he leaned over, revolver  in hand. "You'll be the only man ever, because, instead of tying you up, I'm  going to shoot you."</p>
  <p>Kentish  threw up his head in sharp contempt.</p>
  <p>"What!"  said he. "Sitting?"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  sprang to his feet in a fury. "No; I have a brace!" he cried, catching the  pack-horse. "You shall have the other, if it makes you happy; but you'll be a  dead man all the same. I can handle these things, and I shall shoot to kill!"</p>
  <p>"Then  it's all up with you," said Kentish, rising slowly in his turn.</p>
  <p>"All  up with me? What the devil do you mean?"</p>
  <p>"Unless  I am at a certain place by a certain time, with or without these letters that  are not yours, another letter will be opened."</p>
  <p>Stingaree's  stare gradually changed into a smile.</p>
  <p>"A  little vague," said he, "don't you think?"</p>
  <p>"It  shall be as plain as you please. The letter I mean was scribbled on the coach  before I got down. It will only be opened if I don't return. It contains the  name you can't bear to hear!"</p>
  <p>There  was a pause. The afternoon sun was sinking with southern precipitancy, and  Kentish had got his back to it by cool intent. He studied the play of  suppressed mortification and strenuous philosophy in the swarthy face warmed by  the reddening light; and admired the arduous triumph of judgment over instinct,  even as a certain admiration dawned through the monocle which insensibly  focussed his attention.</p>
  <p>"And  suppose," said Stingaree &mdash;"suppose you return empty as you came?" A  contemptuous kick sent a pack of letters spinning.</p>
  <p>"I  should feel under no obligation to keep your secret."</p>
  <p>"And  you think I would trust you to keep it otherwise?"</p>
  <p>"If  I gave you my word," said Kentish, "I know you would."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  made no immediate answer; but he gazed in the sun-flayed face without  suspicion.</p>
  <p>"You  wouldn't give me your word," he said at last.</p>
  <p>"Oh,  yes, I would."</p>
  <p>"That  you would die without letting that name pass your lips?"</p>
  <p>"Unless  I die delirious &mdash; with all my heart. I have as much respect for it as you."</p>
  <p>"As  much!" echoed the bushranger, in a strange blend of bitterness and obligation.  "But how could you explain the bags? How could you have taken them from me?"</p>
  <p>Kentish  shrugged once more.</p>
  <p>"You  left them &mdash; I found them. Or you were sleeping, but I was unarmed."</p>
  <p>"You  would lie like that &mdash; to save my name?"</p>
  <p>"And  a man whom I remember perfectly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  heard no more; he was down on his knees, collecting the letters into heaps and  shovelling them into the bags. Even the copy of <i>Punch</i> and the loose  wrapper went in with the rest.</p>
  <p>"You  can't carry them," said he, when none remained outside. "I'll take them for you  and dump them on the track."</p>
  <p>"I  have to pass the time till midnight. I can manage them in two journeys."</p>
  <p>But  Stingaree insisted, and presently stood ready to mount his mare.</p>
  <p>"You  give me your word, Kentish?"</p>
  <p>"My  word of honor."</p>
  <p>"It  is something to have one to give! I shall not come back this way; we shall have  the Clear Corner police on our tracks by moonlight, and the more they have to  choose from the better. So I must go. You have given me your word; you wouldn't  care to give me &mdash;"</p>
  <p>But  his hand went out a little as he spoke, and Kentish's met it seven-eights of  the way.</p>
  <p>"Give  this up, man! It's a poor game, when all's said; do give it up!" urged the man  of the world with the warmth of a lad. "Come back to England and &mdash;"</p>
  <p>But  the hand he had detained was wrenched from his, and, in the pink sunset sifted  through the pines, Stingaree vaulted into his saddle with an oath.</p>
  <p>"With  a price on my skin!" he cried, and galloped from the gully with a bitter laugh.</p>
  <p>And  in the moonlight sure enough came bobbing horsemen, with fluttering pugarees  and short tunics with silver buttons; but they saw nothing of the missing  passenger, who had carried the bags some distance down the road, and had found  them quite a comfortable couch in a certain box-clump commanding a sufficient  view of the road. Nevertheless, when the little coach came swaying on its leathern  springs, its scarlet enamel stained black as ink in the moonshine, he was on  the spot to stop it with uplifted arms.</p>
  <p>"Don't  shoot!" he cried. "I'm the passenger you put down this afternoon." And the  driver nearly tumbled from his perch.</p>
  <p>"What  about my mail-bags?" he recovered himself enough to ask: for it was perfectly  plain that the pretentiously intrepid passenger had been skulking all day in  the scrub, scared by the terrors of the road.</p>
  <p>"They're  in that clump," replied Mr. Kentish. "And you can get them yourself, or send  someone else for them, for I have carried them far enough."</p>
  <p>"That  be blowed for a yarn!" cried the driver, forgetting his benefits in the  virtuous indignation of the moment.</p>
  <p>"I  don't wonder at your thinking it one," returned the other, mildly; "for I never  had such absolute luck in all my life!"</p>
  <p>And  he went on to amplify his first lie like a man.</p>
  <p>But  when the bags were really back in the coach, piled roof-high on those of the  downward mail, then it was worse fun for Guy Kentish outside than even he had  anticipated. Question followed question, compliment capped compliment, and a  certain unsteady undercurrent of incredulity by no means lessened his  embarrassment. Had he but told the truth, he felt he could have borne the  praise, and indeed enjoyed it, for he had done far better than anybody was  likely to suppose, and already it was irritating to have to keep that  circumstance a secret. Yet one thing he was able to say from his soul before  the coach drew up at the next stage.</p>
  <p>"You  should have a spell here," the driver had suggested, "and let me pick you up  again on my way back. You'd soon lay hands on the bird himself, if you can put  salt on his tail as you've done. And no one else can &mdash; we want a few more chums  like you."</p>
  <p>"I  dare say!"</p>
  <p>And  the new chum's tone bore its own significance.</p>
  <p>"You  don't mean," cried the driver, "to go and tell me you'll hurry home after  this?"</p>
  <p>"Only  by the first steamer!" said Guy Kentish.</p>
  <p>And  he kept that word as well.</p>

  The Taking of Stingaree</b></h2>
  <p>Stingaree  had crossed the Murray, and all Victoria was agog with the news. It was not his  first descent upon that Colony, nor likely to be his last, unless Sub&mdash;Inspector  Kilbride and his mounted myrmidons did much better than they had done before.  There is no stimulus, however, like a trembling reputation. Within  four-and-twenty hours Kilbride himself was on the track of the invader, whose  heels he had never seen, much less his face. And he rode alone.</p>
  <p>It  was not merely his reputation that was at stake, though nothing could restore  that more effectually than the single-handed capture of so notorious a  desperado as Stingaree. The dashing officer was not unnaturally actuated by the  sum of three hundred pounds now set upon the outlaw's person, alive or dead.  That would be a little windfall for one man, but not much to divide among five  or six; on the other hand, and with all his faults, Sub&mdash;Inspector Kilbride had  courage enough to furnish forth a squadron. He was a black-bearded,  high-cheeked Irish&mdash;Australian, keen and over-eager to a disease, restless,  irascible, but full of the fire and dash that make as dangerous an enemy as  another good fighter need desire. And as a fine fighter in an infamous cause,  Stingaree had his admirers even in Victoria, where the old tale of popular sympathy  with a picturesque rascal was responsible for not the least of the  Sub&mdash;Inspector's difficulties. But even this struck Kilbride as yet another of  those obstacles which were more easily surmounted alone than at the head of a  talkative squad; and with that conviction he pushed his thoroughbred on and on  through a whole cool night and three parts of an Australian summer's day.  Imagine, then, his disgust at the apparition of a mounted trooper galloping to  meet him in the middle of the afternoon, and within a few miles of a former  hiding-place of the bushranger, where the senior officer had strong hopes of  finding and surprising him now.</p>
  <p>"Where  the devil do you come from?" cried Kilbride, as the other rode up.</p>
  <p>"Jumping  Creek," was the crisp reply. "Stationed there."</p>
  <p>"Then  why don't you stop there and do your duty?"</p>
  <p>"Stingaree!"  said the laconic trooper.</p>
  <p>"What!  Do you think you're after him too?"</p>
  <p>"I  am after him."</p>
  <p>"So  am I."</p>
  <p>"Then  you're going in the wrong direction."</p>
  <p>Kilbride  flushed a warm brown from beard to helmet.</p>
  <p>"Do  you know who you're speaking to?" cried he. "I'm Sub&mdash;Inspector Kilbride, and  this business is my business, and no other man's in this Colony. You go back to  your barracks, sir! I'm not going to have every damned fool in the force  charging about the country on his own account."</p>
  <p>The  trooper was a dark, smart, dapper young fellow, of a type not easily browbeaten  or subdued. And discipline is not the strong point of forces so irregular as  the mounted police of a crescent colony. But nothing could have been more  admirable than the manner in which this rebuke was received.</p>
  <p>"Very  well, sir, if you wish it; but I can assure you that you are off the track of  Stingaree."</p>
  <p>"How  do <i>you</i> know?" asked Kilbride, rudely; but he was beginning to look less  black.</p>
  <p>"I  happen to know the place. You would have some difficulty in finding it if you  never were there before. I only stumbled across it by accident myself."</p>
  <p>"Lately?"</p>
  <p>"One  day last winter when I was out looking for some horses."</p>
  <p>"And  you kept it to yourself!"</p>
  <p>The  trooper hung his head. "I knew we should have him across the river again," he  said. "It was only a question of time; and &mdash; well, sir, you can understand!"</p>
  <p>"You  were keen on taking him yourself, were you?"</p>
  <p>"As  keen as you are, Mr. Kilbride!" owned the younger man, raising bold eyes, and  looking his superior fairly and squarely in the face.</p>
  <p>Kilbride  returned the stare, and what he saw unsettled him. The other was wiry, trim,  eminently alert; he had the masterful mouth and the dare-devil eye, and his  horse seemed a part of himself. A more promising comrade at hot work was not to  be desired: and the work would be hot if Stingaree had half a chance. After  all, it was better for two to succeed than for one to fail. "Half the money and  a whole skin!" said Kilbride to himself, and rapped out his decision with an  oath.</p>
  <p>The  trooper's eyes lit with reckless mirth, and a soft cheer came from under his  breath.</p>
  <p>"By  the bye, what's your name," said Kilbride, "before we start?"</p>
  <p>"Bowen  &mdash; Jack Bowen."</p>
  <p>"Then  I know all about you! Why on earth didn't you tell me before? It was you who  took that black fellow who murdered the shepherd on Woolshed Creek, wasn't it?"</p>
  <p>The  admission was made with due modesty.</p>
  <p>"Why,  you're the very man for me!" Kilbride cried. "You show the way, Jack, and I'll  make the going."</p>
  <p>And  off they went together at a canter, the slanting sun striking fire from their  buttons and accoutrements, and lighting their sunburnt faces as it lit the red  stems and the white that raced past them on either side. For a little they  followed the path which Kilbride had taken on his way thither; then the trooper  plunged into the thick bush on the left, and the game became follow-my-leader,  in and out, out and in, through a maze of red stems and of white, where the  pungent eucalyptus scent hung heavy as the sage-green, perpendicular leaves  themselves: and so onward until the Sub&mdash;Inspector called a halt.</p>
  <p>"How  far is it now, Bowen?"</p>
  <p>"Two  or three miles, sir."</p>
  <p>"Good!  It'll be light for another hour and a half. We'd better give the mokes a  breather while we can. And there'd be no harm in two draws."</p>
  <p>"I  was just thinking the same thing, sir."</p>
  <p>So  their reins dangled while they cut up a pipeful of apparent shoe-leather  apiece: and presently the dull blue smoke was curling and circling against the  dull green foliage, producing subtle half-tint harmonies and momentary  arabesques as the horses ambled neck and neck.</p>
  <p>"Native  of this Colony?" puffed Kilbride.</p>
  <p>"Well,  no &mdash; old country originally &mdash; but I've been out some years."</p>
  <p>"That's  all right so long as you're not a New South Welshman," said Kilbride, with a  chuckle. "I'll be shot if I wouldn't almost have turned you back if you had  been!"</p>
  <p>"Victoria  is to have all the credit, is she, sir?"</p>
  <p>"Anyhow  they sha'n't have any on the other side, or I'll know the reason!" the  Victorian swore. "I&mdash; I&mdash; by Jove, I'd as lief lose my man again as let them have  a hand in taking him!"</p>
  <p>"But  why?"</p>
  <p>"Why?  Do you live so near the border, and can you ask? Did you never hear a  Sydney-side drover blowing about his blooming Colony? Haven't you heard of  Sydney Harbor till you're sick? And then their papers!" cried Kilbride, with  columns in his tone. "But I'll have the last laugh yet! I swore I would, and I  will! I swore I'd take Stingaree &mdash;"</p>
  <p>"So  I heard."</p>
  <p>"Yes,  they put it in their infernal papers! But it was true &mdash; take him I will!"</p>
  <p>"Or  die in the attempt, eh?"</p>
  <p>"Or  die and be damned to me!"</p>
  <p>All  the bitterness of previous failure, indeed of notorious and much-criticized  defeat, was in the Sub&mdash;Inspector's tone; that of his subordinate, though light  as air, had a touch of insolence which an outsider could not have failed &mdash; but  Kilbride was too excited &mdash; to detect. The outsider might possibly have foreseen  a rivalry which no longer entered Kilbride's hot head.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the country was changing even with their now leisurely advance. The timbered  flats in the region of the river had merged into a gully which was rapidly  developing into a gorge, with new luxuriant growths which added greatly to the  density of the forest, suggesting its very heart. The almost neutral  eucalyptian tint was splashed with the gay hues of many parrots, as though the  gum-trees had burst into flower. The noise of running water stole gradually  through the murmur of leaves. And suddenly an object in the grass struck the  sight like a lantern flashed at dead of night: it proved to be an empty sardine  tin pricked by a stray lance from the slanting sun.</p>
  <p>"We  must be near," whispered Kilbride.</p>
  <p>"We  are there! You hear the creek? He has a gunyah there &mdash; that's all. Shall we  rush it on horseback or creep up on foot?"</p>
  <p>"You  know the lie of the land, Bowen; which do you recommend?"</p>
  <p>"Rushing  it."</p>
  <p>"Then  here goes."</p>
  <p>In  a few seconds they had leaped their horses into a tiny clearing on the banks of  a creek as relatively minute. And the gunyah &mdash; a mere funnel of boughs and  leaves, in which a man could lie at full length, but only sit upright at the  funnel's mouth &mdash; seemed as empty as the space on every hand. The only other  sign of Stingaree was a hank of rope flung carelessly across the gunyah roof.</p>
  <p>"He  may be watching us from among the trees," muttered Kilbride, looking sharply  about him. Bowen screwed up his eyes and followed suit.</p>
  <p>"I  hardly think it, Mr. Kilbride."</p>
  <p>"But  it's possible, and here we sit for him to pot us! Let's dismount, whether or  no."</p>
  <p>They  slid to the ground. The trooper found himself at the mouth of the gunyah.</p>
  <p>"What  if he were in there after all!" said he.</p>
  <p>"He  isn't," said Kilbride, stepping in front and stooping quickly. "But you might  creep in, Jack, and see if he's left any sign of life behind him."</p>
  <p>The  men were standing between the horses, their revolvers cocked. Bowen's answer  was to hand his weapon over to Kilbride and to creep into the gunyah on his  hands and knees.</p>
  <p>"Here's  something or other," his voice cried thickly from within. "It's half buried.  Wait a bit."</p>
  <p>"As  sharp as you can!"</p>
  <p>"All  right; but it's a box, and jolly heavy!"</p>
  <p>Kilbride  peered nervously to right, left, and centre; then his eyes fell upon his  companion wriggling back into the open, a shallow, oblong box in his arms, its  polish dimmed and dusted with the mould, as though they had violated a grave.</p>
  <p>"Kick  it open!" exclaimed Kilbride, excitedly.</p>
  <p>But  there was no need for that; the box was not even locked; and the lifted lid  revealed an inner one of glass, protecting a brass cylinder with steel bristles  in uneven growth, and a long line of lilliputian hammers.</p>
  <p>"A  musical-box!" said the staggered Sub&mdash;Inspector.</p>
  <p>"That's  it, sir. I remember hearing that he'd collared one on one of the stations he  stuck up last time he was down here. It must have lain in the ground ever  since. And it only shows how hard you must have pressed him, Mr. Kilbride!"</p>
  <p>"Yes!  I headed him back across the Murray &mdash; I soon had him out o' this!" rejoined the  other in grim bravado. "Anything else in the gunyah?"</p>
  <p>"All  he took that trip, I fancy, if we dig a bit. You never gave him time to roll  his swag!"</p>
  <p>"I  must have a look," said Kilbride, his excitement fed by his reviving vanity.</p>
  <p>The  other questioned whether it were worth while. This settled the Sub&mdash;Inspector.</p>
  <p>"There  may be something to show where he's gone," that casuist suggested, "for I don't  believe he's anywhere here."</p>
  <p>"Shall  I hold the shooters, sir?"</p>
  <p>"Thanks;  and keep your eyes open, just in case. But it's my opinion that the bird's  flown somewhere else, and it's for us to find out where."</p>
  <p>Kilbride  then crept into the gunyah upon his hands and knees, and found it less dark  than he had supposed, the light filtering freely through the leaves and  branches. At the inner extremity he found a mildewed blanket, and the place  where the musical-box had evidently lain a long time; but there, though he  delved to the elbows in the loosened earth, his discoveries ended. Puzzled and  annoyed, Kilbride was on the verge of cursing his subordinate, when all at once  he was given fresh cause. The musical-box had burst into selections from <i>The  Pirates of Penzance</i>.</p>
  <p>"What  the deuce are you at?" shouted the irate officer.</p>
  <p>"Only  seeing how it goes."</p>
  <p>"Stop  it at once, you fool! He may hear it!"</p>
  <p>"You  said the bird had flown."</p>
  <p>"You  dare to argue with me? By thunder, you shall see!"</p>
  <p>But  it was Sub&mdash;Inspector Kilbride who saw most. Backing precipitately out of the  gunyah, he turned round before rising upright &mdash; and remained upon his knees  after all. He was covered by two revolvers &mdash; one of them his own &mdash; and the face  behind the barrels was the one with which the last hour had familiarized  Kilbride. The only difference was the single eye-glass in the right eye. And  the strains of the musical-box &mdash; so thin and tinkling in the open air &mdash; filled  the pause.</p>
  <p>"What  in blazes are you playing at?" laughed the luckless officer, feigning to treat  the affair as a joke, even while the iron truth was entering his soul by  inches.</p>
  <p>"Rise  another inch without my leave and you may be in blazes to see!"</p>
  <p>"Look  here, Bowen, what do you mean?"</p>
  <p>"Only  that Stingaree happens to be at home after all, Mr. Kilbride."</p>
  <p>The  victim's grin was no longer forced; the situation made for laughter, even if  the laughter were hysterical; and for an instant it was given even to Kilbride  to see the cruel humor of it. Then he realized all it meant to him &mdash; certain  ruin or a sudden death &mdash; and the drops stood thick upon his skin.</p>
  <p>"What  of Bowen?" he at length asked hoarsely. The idea of another victim came as some  slight alleviation of his own grotesque case.</p>
  <p>"I  didn't kill him," Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"Good!"  said Kilbride. It was something that two of them should live to share the  shame.</p>
  <p>"But  wing him I did," added the bushranger. "I couldn't help myself. The beggar put  a bullet through my hat; he did well only to get one back in the leg."</p>
  <p>Kilbride  longed to be winged and wounded in his turn, since blood alone could lessen his  disgrace. On cooler reflection, however, it was obviously wiser to feign a  surrender more abject than it might finally prove to have been.</p>
  <p>"Well,"  said Kilbride, "you have the whip-hand over me this time, and I give you best.  How long are you going to keep me on my knees?"</p>
  <p>"You  can get up when you like," replied Stingaree, "if you promise not to play the  fool. So you were really going to take me this time, were you? I have really no  desire to rub it in, but if I were you I should have kept that to myself until  I'd done it. And you wanted to have me all to yourself? Well, you couldn't pay  me a higher compliment, but I'm going to pay you a high one in return. You  really did make me run for it last time, and leave all sorts of things behind.  So this time I mean to take them with me and leave you here instead.  Nevertheless, you're the only Victorian trap I have any respect for, Mr.  Kilbride, or I shouldn't have gone to all this trouble to get you here."</p>
  <p>Kilbride  did not blanch, but he heard his apparent doom with a glittering eye, and was  deaf for a little to <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>.</p>
  <p>"Oh!  I'm not going to harm a good man like you," continued Stingaree, "unless you  make me. Your friend Bowen made me, but I don't promise to fire low every time,  mark you! There's another good man on the other side &mdash; Cairns by name &mdash; you  know him, do you? He'll kick up his heels when he hears of this; but they do no  better in New South Wales, so don't you let that worry you. To think you held  both shooters at one stage of the game! I trusted you, and so you trusted me;  if only you had known, eh? Hear that tune, and know what it is? It's in your  honor, Mr. Kilbride."</p>
  <p>And  Stingaree hummed the policemen's chorus <i>sotto voce</i>; but before the end,  with a swift remorse, induced by the dignity of Kilbride's bearing in  humiliating disaster, he swooped upon the insolent instrument and stopped its  tinkle by touching the lever with one revolver-barrel while sedulously covering  the Sub&mdash;Inspector with the other. The sudden cessation of the toy music,  bringing back into undue prominence all the little bush noises which had filled  the air before, brought home to Kilbride a position which he had subconsciously  associated with those malevolent strains as something theatrical and unreal. He  had known in his heart that it was real, without grasping the reality until  now. He flung up his fists in sudden entreaty.</p>
  <p>"Put  a bullet through me," he cried, "if you're a man!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  shook a decisive head.</p>
  <p>"Not  if I can help it," said he. "But I fear I shall have to tie you up."</p>
  <p>"That's  slow death!"</p>
  <p>"It  never has been yet, but you must take your chance. Get me that rope that's  slung over the gunyah. It's got to be done."</p>
  <p>Kilbride  obeyed with apparent apathy; but his heart was inflamed with a sudden and  infernal glow. Yes, it had never ended in death in any case that he could  recall of this time-honored trick of all the bushrangers; on the contrary,  sooner or later, most victims had contrived to release themselves. Well, one  victim was going to complete his release by hanging himself by the same rope to  the same tree! Meanwhile he confronted his captor grimly, the coil in both  hands.</p>
  <p>"There's  a loop at one end," said Stingaree. "Stick your foot through it &mdash; either foot  you like."</p>
  <p>Kilbride  obeyed, wondering whether his head would go through when his turn came.</p>
  <p>"Now  chuck me the other end."</p>
  <p>It  fell in coils at the bushranger's feet.</p>
  <p>"Now  stand up against that blue gum," he continued, pointing at the tree with  Kilbride's revolver, his own being back at his hip. "And stand still like a  sensible chap!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  then walked round and round the tree, paying out the long rope, yet keeping it  taut, until it wound round tree and man from the latter's ankles to his  armpits. Instinctively Kilbride had kept his arms free to the last, but they  were no use to him in his suit of hemp, and one after the other his wrists were  pinned and handcuffed behind the tree. The cold steel came as a shock. The  captive had counted on loosening the knots by degrees, beginning with those  about his hands. But there was no loosening steel gyves like these; he knew the  feel of them too well; they were Kilbride's own, that he had brought with him  for Stingaree. "Found 'em in your saddle-bags while you were in my gunyah,"  explained the bushranger, stepping round to survey his handiwork. "Sorry to  scar the kid &mdash; so to speak! But you see you were my most dangerous enemy on  this side of the Murray!"</p>
  <p>The  enemy did not look very dangerous as he stood in the dusk, in the heart of that  forest, lashed to that tree, with his finger-tips not quite meeting behind it,  and the blood already on his wrists.</p>
  <p>"And  now?" he whispered, hoarse already, his lips cracking, and his throat parched.</p>
  <p>"I  shall give you a drink before I go."</p>
  <p>"I  won't take one from you!"</p>
  <p>"I  shall make you, if I have to be a bigger brute than ever. You must live to spin  this yarn!"</p>
  <p>"Never!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  smiled to himself as he produced pipe and tobacco; but it was not his sinister  smile; it was rather that of the victor who salutes the vanquished in his  heart. Meanwhile a more striking and a more subtle change had come over the  face of Kilbride. It was not joy, but it was quite a new grimness, and in his  own preoccupation the bushranger did not notice it at all. He sauntered nearer  with his knife and his tobacco-plug, and there was some compassion in his  pensive stare.</p>
  <p>"Cheer  up, man!" said he. "There's no disgrace in coming out second best to me. You  may smile. You'll find it's generally admitted in New South Wales. And after  all, you needn't tell little crooked Cairns how it happened. So that stops your  smile! But he's the best man left on my tracks, and I shouldn't be surprised if  he's the first to find you."</p>
  <p>"No  more should I!" said a harsh voice behind the bushranger. "Hands up and empty,  Stingaree, or you're the next dead man in this little Colony!"</p>
  <p>Quick  as thought Stingaree stepped in front of the tied Victorian. But his hands were  up, and his eye-glass dangling on its string.</p>
  <p>"Oh,  you don't catch me kill two birds," rasped the newcomer's voice, "though I'm  not sure which of you would be least loss!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  stood aside once more, and waved his hands without lowering them, bowing from  his captor to his captive as he did so.</p>
  <p>"Superintendent  Cairns, of New South Wales &mdash; Inspector Kilbride, of Victoria," said he. "You  two men will be glad to know each other."</p>
  <p>The  New South Welshman drawled out a dry expression of his own satisfaction. His  was a strange and striking personality. Dark as a mulatto, and round-shouldered  to the extent of some distinct deformity, he carried his eyes high under the  lids, and shot his piercing glance from under the penthouse of a beetling brow;  a lipless mouth was pursed in such a fashion as to shorten the upper lip and  exaggerate an already powerful chin; and this stooping and intent carriage was  no less suggestive of the human sleuth-hound than were the veiled vigilance and  dogged determination of the lowered face. Such was the man who had succeeded  where Kilbride had failed &mdash; succeeded at the most humiliating moment of that  most ignominious failure &mdash; and who came unwarrantably from the wrong side of  the Murray. The Victorian stood in his bonds and favored his rival with such a  glare as he had not levelled at Stingaree himself. But not a syllable did  Kilbride vouchsafe. And the Superintendent was fully occupied with his  prisoner.</p>
  <p>"'Little  crooked Cairns,' am I? There are those that look a jolly sight smaller, and'll  have a worse hump than mine for the rest of their born days! Come nearer and  turn your back."</p>
  <p>And  the revolver was withdrawn from its carrier on the stolen constabulary belt.  The bushranger was then searched for other weapons; then marched into the bush  at the pistol's point, and brought back handcuffed to the Superintendent's  bridle.</p>
  <p>"That's  the way you'll come marching home, my boy; and one of us on horseback each  side; don't trust <i>you</i> in a saddle on a dark night!"</p>
  <p>Indeed,  it was nearly dark already, and in the nebulous middle-distance a laughing  jackass was indulging in his evening peal. Cairns jerked his head in the  direction of the unearthly cackle. "Lots of 'em down here in Vic, I believe,"  said he, and at length turned his attention to the bound man. "You see, I  wanted to land him alive and kicking without spilling blood," he continued,  opening his knife. "That was why I had to let him tie you up."</p>
  <p>"You <i>let</i> him?" thundered the Victorian, breaking his silence with a bellow.  It was as though the man with the knife had cut through the rope into the bound  man's body.</p>
  <p>"Stand  still," said he, "or I may hurt you. I had to let him, my good fellow, or we'd  have been dropping each other like bullocks. As it is, not a scratch between  us, though I found young Bowen in a pretty bad way. Our friend had stuck up  Jumping Creek barracks in the small hours, put a bullet through Bowen's leg,  and come away in his uniform. Pretty tall, that, eh? I shouldn't wonder if  you'd swing him for it alone, down here in Vic; no doubt you've got to be more  severe in a young Colony. Well, I tracked my gentleman to the barracks, and I  found Bowen in his blood, sent my trooper for a doctor, and got on <i>your</i> tracks before they were half an hour old. I came up with you just as he'd stuck  you up. He had one in each hand. It wasn't quite good enough at the moment."</p>
  <p>The  knife shore through the rope for the last time, and it lay in short ends all  round the tree.</p>
  <p>"Now  my hands," cried Kilbride fiercely.</p>
  <p>"I  beg pardon?" said the satirical Superintendent.</p>
  <p>"My  hands, I tell you!"</p>
  <p>"There's  a little word they teach 'em to say at our State Schools. Perhaps you never  heard it down in Vic?"</p>
  <p>"Don't  be a silly fool," said Kilbride, wearily. "You haven't been through what I  have!"</p>
  <p>"That's  true," said Cairns. "Still, you might be decently civil to the man that gets  you out of a mess."</p>
  <p>Nevertheless,  the handcuffs were immediately removed; and that instant, with the curtest  thanks, Sub&mdash;Inspector Kilbride sprang forward with such vigorous intent that  the other detained him forcibly by one of his stiff and aching arms.</p>
  <p>"What  are you after now, Kilbride?"</p>
  <p>"My  prisoner!"</p>
  <p>"Your  what?"</p>
  <p>"<i>My</i> prisoner," I said.</p>
  <p>"I  like that &mdash; and you his!"</p>
  <p>Kilbride  burst into a voluble defence of his position.</p>
  <p>"What  right have you on this side of the Murray, you Sydney-sider? None at all,  except as a passenger. You can't lay finger on man, woman, or child in this  Colony, and, by God, you sha'n't! Nor yet upon the three hundred there's on his  head; and the sons of convicts down in Sydney can put <i>that</i> in their pipe  and smoke it!"</p>
  <p>For  all his cool and ready insolence, the misshapen Superintendent from the other  side stood dazed and bewildered by this volcanic outpouring. Then his dark face  flushed darker, and with a snarl he clinched his fists. The Victorian, however,  had turned on his heel, and now his liberated hands flew skyward, as though the  bushranger's revolver covered him yet again.</p>
  <p>But  there was no such weapon discernible through the shade; no New South Welshman's  horse; and neither sight, sound, wraith, nor echo of Stingaree, the outlawed  bushranger, the terror and the despair of the Sister Colonies!</p>
  <p>"I  thought it might be done when I saw how you fixed him," said Kilbride  cheerfully. "Those beggars can ride lying down or standing up!"</p>
  <p>"I  believe you saw him clear!"</p>
  <p>"I'll  settle that with you when I've caught him."</p>
  <p>"You  catch him, you gum-sucker, when you as good as let him go!"</p>
  <p>And  a volley of further and far more trenchant abuse was discharged by  Superintendent Cairns, of the New South Wales Police. But Kilbride was already  in the saddle; a covert outward kick with his spurred heel, and the third horse  went cantering riderless into the trees.</p>
  <p>"He  won't go far," sang the Sub&mdash;Inspector, "and he'll take you safe back to  barracks if you give him his head. It's easy to get bushed in this country &mdash;  for new chums from penal settlements!"</p>
  <p>As  the Victorian galloped into the darkness, and the New South Welshman dashed  wildly after the third horse, the laughing jackass in the invisible  middle-distance gave his last grotesque guffaw at departed day. And the  laughing jackass is a Victorian bird.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  The Honor of the Road</b></h2>
  <p>Sergeant  Cameron was undressing for bed when he first heard the voices through the  weather-board walls; in less than a minute there was a knock at his door.</p>
  <p>"Here's  Mr. Hardcastle from Rosanna, sir. He says he must see you at once."</p>
  <p>"The  deuce he does! What about?"</p>
  <p>"He  says he'll only tell you; but he's ridden over in three hours, and he looks  like the dead."</p>
  <p>"Give  him some whiskey, Tyler, and tell him I'll be down in two ticks."</p>
  <p>So  saying, the gray-bearded sergeant of the New South Wales Mounted Police tucked  his night-gown into his cord breeches, slipped into his tunic, and hastened to  the parlor which served as court-room on occasion, buttoning as he went. Mr.  Hardcastle had a glass to his lips as the sergeant entered. He was a very fine  man of forty, and his massive frame was crowned with a countenance as handsome  as it was open and bold; but at a glance it was plain that he was both shaken  and exhausted, and in no mood to hide either his fatigue or his distress.  Sergeant Cameron sat down on the other side of the oval table with the faded  cloth; the younger constable had left the room when Hardcastle called him back.</p>
  <p>"Don't  go, Tyler," said he. "You may as well both hear what I've got to say. It's &mdash;  it's Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>The  name was echoed in incredulous undertones.</p>
  <p>"But  he's down in Vic," urged the sergeant. "He's been giving our chaps a devil of a  time down there!"</p>
  <p>"He's  come back. I've seen him with my own eyes. But I'm beginning at the wrong end  first," said the squatter, taking another sip and then sitting back to survey  his hearers. "You know old Duncan, my overseer?"</p>
  <p>The  sergeant nodded.</p>
  <p>"Of  course you know him," the other continued, "and so does the whole back-country,  and did even before he won this fortune in the Melbourne Cup sweep. I suppose  you've heard how he took the news? He was fuddling himself from his own bottle  on Sunday afternoon when the mail came; the first I knew of it was when I saw  him sitting with his letter in one hand and throwing out the rest of his grog  with the other. Then he told us he had won the first prize of thirty thousand,  and that he had made up his mind to have his next drink at his own place in  Scotland. He left us that afternoon to catch the coach and go down to Sydney  for his money. He ought to have been back this evening before sundown."</p>
  <p>The  sergeant put in his word:</p>
  <p>"That  he ought, for I saw him come off the coach and start for the station as soon as  they'd run up the horse he left behind him at the pub. I wondered what had  brought him, if he was so set on getting back to the old country."</p>
  <p>"I  could tell you," said Hardcastle, after some little hesitation, "and I may as  well. Poor old Duncan was the most generous of men, and nothing would serve him  but that every soul on Rosanna should share more or less in his good fortune. I  am ashamed to tell you how much he spoke of pressing on myself. You have  probably heard that one of his peculiarities was that he would never take  payment by check, like other people? I believe it was because he had knocked  down too many checks in his day. In any case, we used to call him Hard Cash  Duncan on Rosanna; and I am very much afraid that when you saw him he must have  had the whole of his thirty thousand pounds upon him in the hardest form of  cash."</p>
  <p>"But  what has happened, Mr. Hardcastle?"</p>
  <p>"The  very worst," said Hardcastle, stooping to sip. The three heads came closer  together across the faded tablecloth. "There was no sign of him at seven; he  ought to have been with us before six. We had done our best to make it an  occasion, and it seemed that the dinner would be spoilt. So at seven young  Evans, my store-keeper, went off at a gallop to meet him, and at twenty-five  past he came galloping back leading a riderless horse. It was the one you saw  Duncan riding this afternoon. There was blood upon the saddle. I found it. And  within another hour we had found the poor old boy himself, dead and cold in the  middle of the track, with a bullet through his heart."</p>
  <p>The  squatter's voice trembled with an emotion that did him honor in his hearers'  eyes; and the gray-bearded sergeant waited a little before asking questions.</p>
  <p>"What  makes you think it is Stingaree?" he inquired, at length.</p>
  <p>"I  tell you I saw him on the run, with my own eyes, this morning. I passed him in  one of my paddocks, as close as I am to you, and asked him if he was looking  for the homestead. He answered that he was only riding through, and we neither  of us stopped."</p>
  <p>"Yet  you knew all the time that it was Stingaree?"</p>
  <p>"No;  to be quite honest," replied Hardcastle, "I never dreamt of it at the time. But  now I am quite positive on the point. He hadn't his eye-glass in his eye, but  it was dangling on its cord all right; and there was the curled mustache, and  the boots and breeches that one knows all about, if one has never seen them for  oneself. Yet I own it didn't dawn on me just then. I happened to be thinking of  the stations round about, and wondering if they were as burnt up as we are, and  when I met this swell I simply took him for a new chum on one or other of  them."</p>
  <p>"There  had been robbery, of course?"</p>
  <p>"An  absolute clearance," said Hardcastle. "The valise had been cut to ribbons with  a knife, and its other contents were strewed all about; a pocketbook we found  still bulging from the roll of notes which had been taken out. I waited beside  him while Evans went back for the buggy, and when they started to take him in I  rode on to you."</p>
  <p>"We'll  ride back with you at once," said the sergeant, "and find you a fresh horse if  your own has had enough. Run up the lot, Tyler, and Mr. Hardcastle can take his  choice. It seems clear enough," continued Cameron, as the trooper disappeared.  "But this is a new departure for Stingaree; it's the very thing that everybody  said he would never do."</p>
  <p>"And  yet it's the logical climax of his career; it might have happened long ago, but  it's not his first blood as it is," argued Hardcastle, when he had drained his  glass. "Didn't he wing one of you down in Victoria the other day? Your  bushranger is bound to come to it sooner or later. He may much prefer not to  shoot; but he has only to get up against a man of his own calibre, as resolute  and as well armed as himself, to have no choice in the matter. Poor old Duncan  was the very type; he would never have given way. In fact, we found him with  his own revolver fast in his hand, and a finger frozen to the trigger, but not  a chamber discharged."</p>
  <p>"Yes?  Then that settles it, and it must have been foul play," cried Cameron, owning a  doubt in its dismissal. "And we mustn't lose a single minute in getting on this  blackguard's tracks."</p>
  <p>Yet  it was midnight before the little cavalcade set out upon a ride of over thirty  miles, for arrangements had to be made for a telegram to be sent to the  Glenranald coroner first thing in the morning, and to insure this it was  necessary to disturb the postmaster, who occupied one of the three  weather-board dwellings which constituted the roadside hamlet of Clear Corner.  A round moon topped the sand-hills as the trio rode away; it was near its  almost dazzling zenith when they reined up at the scene of the murder. This was  at a point where the sandy track ran through a belt of scrub, and the sergeant  got off to examine the ground with Hardcastle, while Tyler mounted guard in the  saddle. But nothing of importance was discovered by the pair on foot, and  nothing seen or heard by their mounted comrade.</p>
  <p>They  found the station still astir and faintly aglow in the veiled daylight of the  moon. A cluster of the men stood in a glare at the door of their hut; the  travellers' hut betrayed the like symptoms of excitement; at the kitchen door  were more men with pannikins, and odd glimpses of a firelit, white-capped face  within. But on the broad veranda sat two young men with their backs to a closed  and darkened window. And behind the window lay all that remained of an elderly  man, whose brown, gnarled face was scarcely recognizable by the newcomers in  its strange smooth pallor, but his grizzled beard weirdly familiar and still  crisp with lingering life.</p>
  <p>The  coroner arrived in some thirty hours, which had brought forth nothing new; his  jury was drawn from the men's hut and rabbiters' tents; and after a prolonged  but inconclusive investigation, the inquest was adjourned for a week. But the  seven days were as barren as the first, and a verdict against some person  unknown a foregone result. This did not satisfy the many who were positive that  they knew the person; for Stingaree had been seen a hundred miles lower down,  doubtless on his way back to Victoria, and with his appearance altered in a  telltale manner. But the coroner thought he knew better than anybody else, and  had his way, notwithstanding the manifest feeling on the long veranda where he  held his court.</p>
  <p>So  jurors and spectators drifted back to hut and tent and neighboring station, the  coroner started in his buggy for Glenranald, and last of all the police  departed, leading the horse which Hardcastle had ridden home from their  barracks, and leaving him at peace once more with his two young men. But on the  squatter the time had told; his table had been full to overflowing through it  all; and he sank into a long chair, a trifle grayer at the temples, a thought  looser in his dress, as the pugarees of Cameron and Tyler fluttered out of  sight.</p>
  <p>"I  think we might have a drink," he said with a wry smile to Evans, who fetched  the decanter from the store; the jackeroo was called from a stable which had  become Augean during the week, and the three were still mildly tippling when  the store-keeper came to his feet.</p>
  <p>"Good  Lord!" cried he. "I thought we'd seen the last of the plucky police!"</p>
  <p>"You  don't mean to say they're coming back?"</p>
  <p>"I  do, worse luck! Cameron, Tyler, and some new joker in plain clothes."</p>
  <p>Hardcastle  finished his drink with a resigned smile, and stood on the veranda to receive  the intruders.</p>
  <p>"After  all, it will stave off the reaction I began to feel the moment they had turned  their backs," said he. "Well, well, well! I thought I'd just got rid of you  fellows, and back you come like base coin!"</p>
  <p>"You  mustn't blame us," said the sergeant, first to dismount. "We couldn't know that  Superintendent Cairns had been sent up from Sydney, much less that we should  ride right into him in your horse-paddock!"</p>
  <p>The  squatter had stepped down from the veranda with polite alacrity.</p>
  <p>"Glad  to see you, Mr. Cairns," said he. "I only wish you had come before."</p>
  <p>The  creature in the plain clothes looked about him with a dry smile, and a sharp  eye upon the younger men and the empty glasses, as he and the sergeant  accompanied Hardcastle to the veranda, while Tyler took charge of the three  horses. The fame of Cairns had travelled before him to Rosanna, but none had  been prepared for a figure so weird or for a countenance so forbidding and  malign. His manners were equally uncouth. He shook his bent head to decline  refreshment; he pointedly ignored a generalization of Hardcastle's about the  crime; and when he spoke, it was in a gratuitously satirical style of his own.</p>
  <p>"May  I ask, Mr. Hardcastle, if you are the owner or the manager of this lodge in a  howling wilderness?"</p>
  <p>"I'm  sorry to say I am both."</p>
  <p>"I  appreciate the sorrow. I failed to discern a single green blade as I came  along."</p>
  <p>"We  depend on salt-bush and the like."</p>
  <p>"In  spite of which, I believe, you have had several lean years?"</p>
  <p>"There's  no denying it."</p>
  <p>"I  am sorry to be one of so many intruders in such a season, Mr. Hardcastle, but I  shall not trouble you long. I hope to take the murderer to-night."</p>
  <p>"Stingaree?"</p>
  <p>"Not  quite so loud, please. Who else, should you suppose? You may be interested to  hear that he has been in hiding on your run for several days, and so have I,  within fairly easy reach of him. But he is not a man to be taken single-handed  without further loss of life; so I intercepted you, sergeant, and now you are  both enlightened. To-night, with your assistance and that of your young  colleague, I count upon a bloodless victory. But I should prefer you, Mr.  Hardcastle, not to mention the matter to the very young men whom I noticed in  your company on my arrival. Have I your promise to comply with my wishes on  this point, and on any other which may arise in connection with the capture?"</p>
  <p>And  a steely glitter shot through the beetling eyebrows; but Hardcastle had given  his word before the request was rounded to that pedantic neatness which  characterized the crabbed utterances of the round-shouldered dictator.</p>
  <p>"That  is well," he went on, "for now I can admit you both into my plan of campaign.  Suppose we sit down here on the veranda, at the end farthest from any door. Be  good enough to draw your chairs nearer mine, gentlemen. It might be dangerous  if a fourth person heard me say that I had discovered the murderer's ill-gotten  hoard!"</p>
  <p>"Not  you, sir!" cried Cameron.</p>
  <p>"Good  God!" exclaimed the squatter.</p>
  <p>"The  discoverer was not divine, and indeed no human being but myself," the bent man  averred, turning with mischievous humor from one to the other of his astonished  hearers. "Yes, there was more gold than I would have credited a sane Scotchman  with carrying through the wilds; but the bulk was in small notes and the whole  has been buried in the scrub close to the scene of the murder, doubtless to  avoid at once the detection and the division of such unusual spoil."</p>
  <p>"You  are thinking of his mate?"</p>
  <p>It  was Cameron who had asked the question, but Mr. Hardcastle followed immediately  with another.</p>
  <p>"Did  you remove the spoil?"</p>
  <p>"My  dear Mr. Hardcastle! How you must lack the detective instinct! Of course, I  left everything as nearly as possible as I found it; the man camps on the spot,  or very near it; he lights no fires and is careful to leave no marks, but I am  more or less convinced of it. And that is where I shall take him to-night, or,  rather, early tomorrow morning."</p>
  <p>"I  wish you could make it to-night," said Hardcastle, with a yawn that put a  period to a pause of some duration.</p>
  <p>"Why?"  demanded the detective, raising open eyes for once.</p>
  <p>"Because  I've had a desperate week of it," replied Hardcastle, "and am dead with sleep."</p>
  <p>The  other carried his growing geniality to the length of an almost hearty laugh.</p>
  <p>"My  dear sir, do you suppose that I thought of taking <i>you</i> with us? No, Mr.  Hardcastle, the risks of this sort of enterprise are for those who are paid to  run them. And there is a risk; if we timed our attack too early or too late  there would be bloodshed to a certainty. But at two o'clock the average man is  fast asleep; at a quarter after one, therefore, I start with Sergeant Cameron  and Constable Tyler."</p>
  <p>Hardcastle  yawned again.</p>
  <p>"I  should like to have been with you, but there are compensations," said he. "I  doubt if I shall even stay up to see you off."</p>
  <p>"If  you did you would sit up alone," returned the Superintendent. "I intend to turn  in myself for three or four hours; and it will be in the face of all my wishes,  sergeant, if you and Tyler do not do the same. No reason to tell him what a  short night it's to be; it might prevent a young fellow like that from getting  any sleep at all. Merely let it be arranged that we all turn in betimes in view  of an early start; we three alone need know how early the start will be."</p>
  <p>They  had their simple dinner at half-past seven, when the detective took it on  himself to entertain the party, and succeeded so well that the entertainment  was continued on the veranda for the better part of another hour. Doubled up in  his chair, abnormal, weird, he recounted in particular the exploits of  Stingaree (included a garbled version of the recent fiasco across the Murray)  with a zest only equalled by his confidant undertaking to avenge the death of  Robert Duncan before another day was out; all listened in a rapt silence, and  the younger men were duly disappointed when the party broke up prematurely  between nine and ten. But they also had played their part in a fatiguing week;  by the later hour all were in their rooms, and before very long Rosanna Station  lay lighted only by the full white moon of New South Wales.</p>
  <p>Cameron  wondered if it could possibly be two o'clock, while Tyler sat up insensate with  the full weight of his first sleep, when their chief crept into the  double-bedded room in which the two policemen had been put. He owned himself  before his time by an hour and more, but explained that he had an idea which  had only struck him as he was about to fall asleep.</p>
  <p>"If  we hunt for the fellow in the dark," said he, "we may give him the alarm before  we come on him. But if we go now there is at least a chance that we may find  his fire to guide us. I am aware I said he wouldn't light one there, but  everybody knows that Stingaree uses a spirit-lamp. In any case it's a chance,  and with a desperate man like that we can't afford to give the ghost of a  chance away."</p>
  <p>The  sergeant dressed without more ado, as did his subordinate on learning the  nature of their midnight errand; meanwhile the disturber of slumbers was gone  to the horse-yard to start saddling. The others followed in a few minutes. And  there was the horse-yard overflowing with moonshine, but empty alike of man and  beast.</p>
  <p>"I  wonder what's got him?" murmured the bewildered sergeant uneasily.</p>
  <p>"Old  Harry, for all I care!" muttered the other. "I'm no such nuts on him, if you  ask me. There's a bit too much of him for my taste."</p>
  <p>In  his secret breast the sergeant entertained a similar sentiment, but he was too  old an officer to breathe disaffection in the ear of his subaltern. He  contented himself with a mild expression of his surprise at the conduct of the  Sydney authorities in putting a "towny" over his head without so much as a word  of notice.</p>
  <p>"And  such a 'towny'!" echoed Tyler. "One you never heard of in your life before, and  never will again!"</p>
  <p>"Speak  for yourself!" rejoined Cameron, irritated at the exaggeration of their case.  "I have heard of him ever since I joined the force."</p>
  <p>"Well,  he's a funny joke to have shoved over us, a blooming little hunchback like  that."</p>
  <p>"I  always heard that he was none the worse for what he couldn't help, and now I  can understand it," said the sergeant, "for he's not such a hunch &mdash;"</p>
  <p>The  men looked at each other in the moonlight, and the ugly word was never  finished. A dozen hoofs were galloping upon them, their thunder muffled by the  sandy road, and into the tank of moonshine came two horses, hounded by the  detective bareback on the third.</p>
  <p>"Someone  left the slip-rails down, and they were all over the horse-paddock," he panted.  "But I took a bridle and managed to catch one, and it was easy enough to run up  the other two."</p>
  <p>But  even Constable Tyler thought the more of their misshapen leader for the feat.</p>
  <p>There  was now no time to be lost, for it approached midnight, but the trio were soon  cantering through the horse-paddock neck-and-neck, and the new day found them  at the farther gate. The moon still poured unbroken brilliance upon that desert  world of sandy stretches tufted with salt-bush and erratically overgrown with  scrub. The shadow of the gate was as another gate lying ready to be hung; for  each particular wire in the fence there was a thin black stripe upon the  ground. The three passed through, and came in quick time upon the edge of that  scrub in which the crime had been committed. And here the chief called a halt.</p>
  <p>"The  two to nail him must be on foot," said he. "You can creep upon him on foot as  you never could with a horse; but I will remain mounted in the road and ride  him down if he shows fight."</p>
  <p>So  the pair in the pugarees walked one at either stirrup of their crooked chief,  leaving the two horses tethered to a tree, until of a sudden the whole party  halted as one. They had rounded a bend in the road with great caution, for they  all knew where they were; but only one of them was prepared for the position of  the light which flashed into their eyes from the heart of the scrub.</p>
  <p>It  was a tiny light, set low upon the ground, and yet it flashed through the  forest like a diamond in a bundle of hay. It burnt at no little distance from  the track, for at a movement it was lost, but it was some hundreds of yards  nearer the station than the scene of the murder. The chief whispered that this  was where he had found the buried booty, and over half the distance he led the  way, winding in and out among the trees, now throwing a leg across his horse's  withers to avoid a hole, anon embracing its neck to escape contact with the  branches. It was long before they could discern anything but the light itself  amid the trunks and branches of the scrub.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the horseman stopped, beckoning with his free hand to the pair afoot, pointing  at the fire with the one that held the reins; and as they crept up to him he  stooped in the stirrups till his mouth was close to the sergeant's ear.</p>
  <p>"He's  sitting on the far side of the light, but you can't see his face. I thought he  was a log, and I still believe he's asleep. Creep on him like cats till he  looks up; then rush him with your revolvers before he can draw his, and I'll  support you with mine!"</p>
  <p>Nearer  and nearer stole Cameron and Tyler; the rider managed to coax a few more  noiseless steps from his clever mount, but dropped the reins and squared his  elbows some twenty paces from the light &mdash; a hurricane lamp now in the sharpest  focus. The policemen crawled some yards ahead; all three carried revolver in  hand. But still the unsuspecting figure sat motionless, his chin upon his  chest, the brim of his wideawake hiding his face, a little heap of gold and  notes before him on the ground. Then the Superintendent's horse flung up its  head; its teeth champed upon the bit; the man sat bolt upright, and the light  of the hurricane lamp fell full upon the face of Hardcastle the squatter.</p>
  <p>"Rush  him! rush him! That's the man we want!"</p>
  <p>But  the momentary stupefaction of the police had given Hardcastle his opportunity;  the hurricane lamp flew between them, going out where it fell, and for a minute  the revolvers spat harmlessly in the remaining patchwork of moonshine and  shadow.</p>
  <p>"Get  behind trees; shoot low, don't kill him!" shouted the chief from his saddle.  "Now on to him before he can load again. That's it! Pin him! Throw your  revolvers away, or he'll snatch one before you know where you are! Ah, I  thought he was too strong for you! Mr. Hardcastle, I'll put a bullet through  you myself if you don't instantly surrender!"</p>
  <p>And  the fight ended with the bent man leaning in his stirrups over the locked and  swaying group, as he brandished his revolver to suit deed to word. It was a  heavy blow with the long barrel that finally turned the scale. In a few seconds  Hardcastle stood a prisoner, the handcuffs fitting his large wrists like  gloves, his great frame panting from the fray, and yet a marvel of monstrous  manhood in its stoical and defiant carriage.</p>
  <p>"For  God's sake, Cairns, do what you say!" he cried. "Put three bullets through me,  and divide what's on the ground between you!"</p>
  <p>"I  half wish we could, for your sake," was the reply. "But it's idle to speak of  it, and I'm afraid you've committed a crime that places you beyond the reach of  sympathy."</p>
  <p>"That  he has!" cried the sergeant, wiping blood from his gray beard. "It's plain as a  pikestaff now; and to think that he was the one to come and fetch us the very  night he'd done it! But what licks me more than anything is how in the world  you found him out, sir!"</p>
  <p>The  hunchback looked down upon the stalwart prisoner standing up to his last inch  between his two captors: there was an impersonal interest in the man's bold  eyes that invited a statement more eloquently than the sergeant's tongue.</p>
  <p>"I  will tell you," said the horseman, smiling down upon the three on foot. "In the  first place, I had my own reasons for knowing that Stingaree was nowhere near  this place on the night of the murder, for I happen to have been on his tracks  for some time. Who knew all about the dead man's stroke of luck, his insane  preference for hard cash, the time of his return? Mr. Hardcastle, for one. Who  swore that he had met Stingaree face to face upon the run? Mr. Hardcastle alone;  there was not a soul to corroborate or contradict him. Who was in need of many  thousand pounds? Mr. Hardcastle, as I suspected, and as he practically admitted  to me when we discussed the bad season on my arrival. I was pretty sure of my  man before I crossed the boundary fence, but I was absolutely convinced before  I had spent twenty minutes on his veranda."</p>
  <p>The  prisoner smiled sardonically in the moonlight. The policemen gazed with awe  upon the man who had solved a nine days' mystery in fewer hours.</p>
  <p>"You  must remember," he continued, "that I have spent some days and nights upon the  run; during the days I have camped in the thickest scrub I could find, but by  night I have been very busy, and last night I had a stroke of luck. I stumbled  by accident on a track that led me to the place I had been looking for all  along. You see, I had put myself in Hardcastle's skin, and I was quite clear  that I should have buried a lapful of gold and notes somewhere in the bush  until the hue and cry had blown over. Not that I expected to find it so near  the scene of the crime &mdash; I should certainly have gone farther afield myself."</p>
  <p>"But  I can't make out why that wasn't enough for you, sir," ventured the sergeant,  deferentially. "Why didn't you come in and arrest him on that?"</p>
  <p>"You  shall see in three minutes. Wasn't it far better to catch him red-handed as we  have? You will at least admit that it was far neater. I say I have the place. I  say we are all going to it at two in the morning. I say, let us sleep till a  little after one. Was it not obvious what would happen? The only thing I did  not expect was to find him asleep with the swag under his nose."</p>
  <p>Then  Hardcastle spoke up.</p>
  <p>"I  was not asleep," said he. "I thought I was safe for an hour or two  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I began to think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was wondering what to do  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whether to cut my throat at once .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>
  <p>And  his dreadful voice died away like a single chord struck in an empty room.</p>
  <p>"But  Stingaree," put in Tyler in the end. "What's happened to him?"</p>
  <p>"He  also has been here. But he was many a mile away at the time."</p>
  <p>"What  brought him here?"</p>
  <p>The  crooked Superintendent from Sydney was sitting strangely upright in his saddle;  his face was not to be seen, for his back was to the moon, but he seemed to rub  one of his eyes.</p>
  <p>"He  may have wished to clear his character. He may have itched to uphold the honor  of that road of which he considers himself a not imperfect knight. He may have  found it so jolly easy to play policeman down in Victoria, that he couldn't  resist another shot in a better cause up here. At his worst he never killed a  man in all his life. And you will be good enough to take his own word for it  that he never will!"</p>
  <p>He  had backed his horse while he spoke; he turned a little to the light, and the  eye-glass gleamed in his eye.</p>
  <p>The  young constable sprang forward.</p>
  <p>"Stingaree!"  he screamed.</p>
  <p>But  the gray sergeant flung his arms round their prisoner.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1701251h-images/page166.jpg" width="497" height="750"></p>
  <p>"That's  right!" cried the bushranger, as he trotted off. "Your horses and even your  pistols are out of reach, thanks to a discipline for which I love you dearly.  You hang on to your bird in the hand, my friends, and never again misjudge the  one in the bush!"</p>
  <p>And  as the trees swallowed the cantering horse and man, followed by a futile shot  from the first revolver which the young constable had picked up, an embittered  admiration kindled in the captive murderer's eyes.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  The Purification of  Mulfera</b></h2>
  <p>Mulfera  Station, N.S.W., was not only an uttermost end of the earth, but an exceedingly  loose end, and that again in more senses than one. There were no ladies on  Mulfera, and this wrought inevitable deterioration in the young men who made a  bachelors' barracks of the homestead. Not that they ever turned it into the  perfect pandemonium you might suppose; but it was unnecessary either to wear a  collar or to repress an oath at table; and this sort of disregard does not  usually stop at the elementary decencies. It is true that on Mulfera the bark  of the bachelor was something worse than his bite, and his tongue no fair  criterion to the rest of him. Nevertheless, the place became a byword, even in  the back-blocks; and when at last the good Bishop Methuen had the hardihood to  include it in an episcopal itinerary, there were admirers of that dear divine  who roundly condemned his folly, and enemies who no longer denied his heroism.</p>
  <p>The  Lord Bishop of the Back&mdash;Blocks had at that time been a twelvemonth or more in  charge of what he himself described playfully as his "oceanic see"; but his  long neglect of Mulfera was due less to its remoteness than to the notorious  fact that they wanted no adjectival and alliterative bishops there. An obvious  way of repulse happened to be open to the blaspheming squatter, though there is  no other instance of its employment. On these up-country visitations the Bishop  was dependent for his mobility upon the horseflesh of his hospitable hosts;  thus it became the custom to send to fetch him from one station to another; and  as a rule the owner or the manager came himself, with four horses and the big  trap. The manager of Mulfera said his horses had something else to do, and his  neighbors backed him up with some discreet encouragement on their own account.  It was felt that a slur would be left upon the whole district if his lordship  actually met with the only sort of reception which was predicted for him on  Mulfera. Bishop Methuen, however, was one of the last men on earth to shirk a  plague-spot; and on this one, warning was eventually received that the Bishop  and his chaplain would arrive on horseback the following Sunday morning, to  conduct divine service, if quite convenient, at eleven o'clock.</p>
  <p>The  language of the manager was something inconceivable upon the receipt of this  cool advice. He was a man named Carmichael, and quite a different type from the  neighbors who held up horny hands when the Bishop decided on his raid.  Carmichael was not "a native of this colony," or of the next, but he was that  distressing spectacle, the public-school man who is no credit to his public  school. Worse than this, he was a man of brains; worst of all, he had promised very  differently as a boy. A younger man who had been at school with him, having  come out for his health, travelled some hundreds of miles to see Carmichael,  whose conversation struck him absolutely dumb. "He was captain of our house,"  the visitor explained to Carmichael's subordinates, "and you daren't say dash  in dormitory &mdash; not even dash!"</p>
  <p>In  appearance this redoubtable person was chiefly remarkable for the intellectual  cast of his still occasionally clean-shaven countenance, and for his double  eye-glasses, or rather the way he wore them. They were very strong and very  common, without any rims, and Carmichael bought them by the box. He would not  wear them with a cord, and in the heat they were continually slipping off his  nose; when they did not slip right off they hung at such an angle that  Carmichael had to throw his whole body and head backward in order to see  anything through them except the ground. And when they fell, someone else had  to find them while Carmichael cursed, for his naked eye was as blind as a  bat's.</p>
  <p>"Let's  go mustering on Sunday," suggested the overseer &mdash;"every blessed man! Let him  find the whole place deserted, homestead and hut!"</p>
  <p>"Or  let's get blind for the occasion," was the bookkeeper's idea &mdash;"every mother's  son!"</p>
  <p>"That  would do," agreed the overseer, "if we got just blind enough. And we might get  the blacks from Poonee Creek to come and join the dance."</p>
  <p>The  overseer was a dapper Victorian with a golden mustache twisted rakishly up and  down at either end respectively, like an overturned letter S. He lived up to  the name of Smart. The bookkeeper was a servile echo with a character and a  face of putty. He had once perpetrated an opprobrious ode to the overseer, and  had answered to the name of Chaucer ever since.</p>
  <p>Carmichael  leaned back to look from one of these worthies to the other, and his spectacled  eyes flamed with mordant scorn.</p>
  <p>"I  suppose you think you're funny, you fellows," said he, and without the oath  which was a sign of his good-will, except when he lost his temper with the sheep.  "If so, I wish you'd get outside to entertain each other. Since the fellow's  coming we shall have to let him come, and the thing is how to choke him off  ever coming again without open insult, which I won't allow. A service of some  sort we shall have to have, this once."</p>
  <p>"I'm  on to guy it," declared the indiscreet Chaucer.</p>
  <p>"If  you do I'll rehearse the men," the overseer promised.</p>
  <p>"You  idiots!" thundered Carmichael, whose temper was as short as his sight. "Can't  you see I weaken on the prospect as much as the two of you stuck together? But  the beggar's certain to be a public-school and 'Varsity man: and I won't have  him treated as though he'd been dragged up in one of these God-forsaken  Colonies!"</p>
  <p>Now  &mdash; most properly &mdash; you cannot talk like this in the bush unless you are also  capable of confirming the insult with your fists. But Carmichael could; and he  was much too blind to fight without his glasses. He was, in fact, the same  strenuous character who had set his dogmatic face against the most harmless  expletives in dormitory at school, and set it successfully, because Carmichael  was a mighty man, whose influence was not to be withstood. His standard alone  was changed. Or he was playing on the other side. Yet he had brought a  prayer-book with him to the back-blocks. And he was seen studying it on the eve  of the episcopal descent.</p>
  <p>"He  may have his say," observed Carmichael, darkly, "and then I'll have mine."</p>
  <p>"Going  to heckle him?" inquired Smart, in a nasal voice full of hope and  encouragement.</p>
  <p>"Not  at the function, you fool," replied Carmichael, sweetly. "But when it's all  over I should like to take him on about the Athanasian Creed and the  Thirty-nine Articles." Only both substantives were qualified by the epithet of  the country, for Carmichael had put himself in excellent temper for the day of  battle.</p>
  <p>That  day dawned blood-red and beautiful, but in a little it was a blinding blue from  pole to pole, and the thermometer in the veranda reached three figures before  breakfast. It was a hot-wind day, and even Carmichael's subordinates pitied Dr.  Methuen and his chaplain, who were riding from the south in the teeth of that  Promethean blast. But Carmichael himself drew his own line with unswerving  rigidity; and though the deep veranda was prepared as a place for worship, and  covered in with canvas which was kept saturated with water, he would not permit  an escort to sally even to the boundary fence to meet the uninvited prelate.</p>
  <p>Not  long after breakfast the two horsemen jogged into view, ambling over the  sand-hills whose red-hot edge met a shimmering sky some little distance beyond  the station pines. Both wore pith helmets and fluttering buff dust-coats, but  both had hot black legs, the pair in gaiters being remarkable for their length.  The homestead trio, their red necks chafed by the unaccustomed collar, gathered  grimly at the open end of the veranda, where they exchanged impressions while  the religious raiders bore down upon them.</p>
  <p>"They  can ride a bit, too, I'm bothered if they can't," exclaimed the overseer, in  considerable astonishment.</p>
  <p>"And  do you suppose, my good fool," inquired Carmichael, with the usual unregenerate  embroidery &mdash;"do you in your innocence suppose that's an accomplishment confined  to these precious provinces?"</p>
  <p>"They're  as brown as my sugar," said the keeper of books and stores.</p>
  <p>"The  Bishop looks as though he'd been out here all his life."</p>
  <p>Carmichael  did not quarrel with this observation of his overseer, but colorless eyebrows  were raised above the cheap glasses as he stepped into the yard to shake hands  with the visitors. The bearded Bishop returned his greeting in a grave silence.  The chaplain, on the other hand, seemed the victim of a nervous volubility, and  unduly anxious to atone for his chief's taciturnity, which he essayed to  explain to Carmichael on the first opportunity.</p>
  <p>"His  lordship feels the heat so much more than I do, who have had so many years of  it; and to tell you the truth, he is still a little hurt at not being met, for  the first time since he has been out here."</p>
  <p>"Then  why did he come?" demanded Carmichael, bluntly. "I never asked him, did I?"</p>
  <p>"No,  no, but &mdash; ah, well! We won't go into it," said the chaplain. "I am glad to see  your preparations, Mr. Carmichael; that I consider very magnanimous in you,  under all the circumstances; and so will his lordship when he has had a rest.  You won't mind his retiring until it's time for the little service, Mr.  Carmichael?"</p>
  <p>"Not  I," returned Carmichael, promptly. But the worst paddock on Mulfera, in its  worst season, was not more dry than the manager's tone.</p>
  <p>Shortly  before eleven the bell was rung which roused the men on week-day mornings, and  they began trooping over from their hut, while the trio foregathered on the  veranda as before. The open end was the one looking east but the sun was too  near the zenith to enter many inches, and with equal thoroughness and tact  Carmichael had placed the table, the water-bag, and the tumbler, at the open  end. They were all that he could do in the way of pulpit, desk, and lectern.</p>
  <p>The  men tramped in and filled the chairs, forms, tin trunks, and packing-cases  which had been pressed into the service of this makeshift sanctuary. The trio  sat in front. The bell ceased, the ringer entering and taking his place. There  was some delay, if not some hitch. Then came the chaplain with an anxious face.</p>
  <p>"His  lordship wishes to know if all hands are here," he whispered across the desk.</p>
  <p>Carmichael  looked behind him for several seconds. "Every man Jack," he replied. "And damn  his lordship's cheek!" he added for his equals' benefit, as the chaplain  disappeared.</p>
  <p>"Rum  cove, that chaplain," whispered Chaucer, in the guarded manner of one whose  frequent portion is the snub brutal.</p>
  <p>"How  so?" inquired Carmichael, with a duly withering glance.</p>
  <p>Chaucer  told in whispers of a word which he had overheard through the weather-board  wall of the room in which the Bishop had sought repose. It was, in fact, the  monosyllable of which Carmichael had just made use. He, however, was the first  to heap discredit on the book-keeper's story, which he laughed to scorn with as  much of his usual arrogance as could be assumed below the breath.</p>
  <p>"If  you heard it at all," said Carmichael, "which I don't for a moment believe, you  heard it in the strictly Biblical sense. You can't be expected to know what  that is, Chaucer, but as a matter of fact it means lost and done for, like our  noble selves. And it was probably applied to us, if there's the least truth in  what you say."</p>
  <p>"Truth!"  he began, but was not suffered to add another word.</p>
  <p>"Shut  up," snarled Carmichael. "Can't you hear them coming?"</p>
  <p>And  the tramp of the shooting-boots, which Dr. Methuen was still new chum enough to  wear, followed by the chaplain's lighter step, drew noisily nearer upon the  unseen part of the veranda that encircled the whole house.</p>
  <p>"Stand  up, you cripples!" cried Carmichael over his shoulder, in a stage whisper. And  they all came to their feet as the two ecclesiastics appeared behind the table  at the open end of the tabernacle.</p>
  <p>Carmichael  felt inclined to disperse the congregation on the spot.</p>
  <p>There  was the Bishop still in his gaiters and his yellow dust-coat; even the chaplain  had not taken the trouble to don his surplice. So anything was good enough for  Mulfera! Carmichael had lunged forward with a jutting jaw when an authoritative  voice rang out across the table.</p>
  <p>"Sit  down!"</p>
  <p>The  Bishop had not opened his hairy mouth. It was the smart young chaplain who  spoke. And all obeyed except Carmichael.</p>
  <p>"I  beg your lordship's pardon," he was beginning, with sarcastic emphasis, when  the manager of Mulfera was cut as short as he was himself in the habit of  cutting his inferiors.</p>
  <p>"If  you will kindly sit down," cried the chaplain, "like everybody else, I shall at  once explain the apparent irregularity upon which you were doubtless about to  comment."</p>
  <p>Carmichael  glowered through his glasses for a few seconds, and then resumed his seat with  a shrug and a murmur, happily inaudible to all but his two immediate neighbors.</p>
  <p>"On  his way here this morning," the chaplain went on, "his lordship met with a  misadventure from which he has not yet recovered sufficiently to address you as  he fully hoped and intended to do today." At this all eyes sped to the Bishop,  who stood certainly in a drooping attitude at the chaplain's side, his  episcopal hands behind his back. "Something happened," the glib spokesman  continued with stern eyes, "something that you do not often hear of in these  days. His lordship was accosted, beset, and, like the poor man in the  Scriptures, despitefully entreated, not many miles beyond your own boundary, by  a pair of armed ruffians!"</p>
  <p>"Stuck  up!" cried one or two, and "Bushrangers!" one or two more.</p>
  <p>"I  thank you for both words," said the chaplain, bowing. "He was stuck up by the  bushranger who is once more abroad in the land. Really, Mr. Carmichael &mdash;"</p>
  <p>But  the manager of Mulfera rose to his full height, and, leaning back to get the  speaker into focus, stuck his arms akimbo in a way that he had in his most  aggressive moments.</p>
  <p>"And  what were <i>you</i> doing?" he demanded fiercely of the chaplain.</p>
  <p>"It  was I who stuck him up," answered the <i>soi-disant</i> chaplain, whipping a  single glass into his eye to meet the double ones. "My name is Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>And  in the instant's hush which followed he plucked a revolver from his breast,  while the hands of the sham bishop shot out from behind his back, with one in  each.</p>
  <p>The  scene of the instant after that defies ordinary description. It was made the  more hideous by the frightful imprecations of Carmichael, and the short, sharp  threat of Stingaree to shoot him dead unless he instantly sat down. Carmichael  bade him do so with a gallant oath, at which the men immediately behind him  joined with his two companions in pulling him back into his chair and there  holding him by main force. Thereafter the manager appeared to realize the  futility of resistance, and was unhanded on his undertaking to sit quiet, which  he did with the exception of one speech to those behind.</p>
  <p>"If  any of you happen to be armed," he shouted over his shoulder, "shoot him down  like a dog. But if you're all as fairly had as I am, let's hear what the  beggar's got to say."</p>
  <p>"Thank  you, Mr. Carmichael," said the bushranger, still from the far side of the  table, as a comparative silence fell at last. "You are a man after my own  heart, sir, and I would as lief have you on my side as the simple ruffian on my  right. Not a bad bishop to look at," continued Stingaree, with a jerk of the  head toward his mate with the two revolvers. "But if I had let him open his  mouth! Now, if I'd had you, Mr. Carmichael &mdash; but I have my doubts about your vocabulary,  too!"</p>
  <p>The  point appealed to all present, and there was a laugh, in which, however,  Carmichael did not join.</p>
  <p>"I  suppose you didn't come here simply to give us a funny entertainment," said he.  "I happen to be the boss, or have been hitherto, and if you will condescend to  tell me what you want I shall consider whether it is worth while to supply you  or to be shot by you. I shall be sorry to meet my death at the hands of a  thieving blackguard, but one can't pick and choose in that matter. Before it comes  to choosing, however, is it any good asking what you've done with the real  bishop and the real chaplain? If you've murdered them, as I&mdash;"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  had listened thus far with more than patience, in fact with something akin to  approval, to the captive who was still his master with the tongue. With all his  villainy, the bushranger was man enough to appreciate another man when he met  him; but Carmichael's last word flicked him on a bare nerve.</p>
  <p>"Don't  you dare to talk to me about murder," he rapped out. "I've never committed one  yet, but you're going the right way to make me begin! As for Bishop Methuen, I  have more respect for him than for any man in Australia; but his horse was  worth two of my mate's, and that's all I troubled him for. I didn't even tie him  up as I would any other man. We just relieved the two of them of their boots  and clothes, which was quite as good as tying up, with your roads as red-hot as  they are &mdash; though my mate here doesn't agree with me."</p>
  <p>The  man with the beard very emphatically shook a matted head, now relieved of the  stolen helmet, and observed that the quicker they were the better it would be.  He was as taciturn a bushranger as he had been a bishop, but Stingaree was  perfectly right. Even these few words would have destroyed all chance of  illusion in the case of his mate.</p>
  <p>"The  very clothes, which become us so well," continued the prince of personators,  who happened to be without hair upon his face at this period, and who looked  every inch his part; "their very boots, we have only borrowed! I will tell you  presently where we dropped the rest of their kit. We left them a suit of  pyjamas apiece, and not another stitch, and we blindfolded and drove 'em into  the scrub as a last precaution. But before we go I shall also tell you where a search-party  is likely to pick up their tracks. Meanwhile you will all stay exactly where  you are, with the exception of the store-keeper, who will kindly accompany me  to the store. I shall naturally require to see the inside of the safe, but  otherwise our wants are very simple."</p>
  <p>The  outlaw ceased. There was no word in answer; a curious hush had fallen on the  captive congregation.</p>
  <p>"If  there is a store-keeper," suggested Stingaree, "he'd better stand up."</p>
  <p>But  the accomplished Chaucer sat stark and staring.</p>
  <p>"Up  with you," whispered Carmichael, in terrible tones, "or we're done!"</p>
  <p>And  even as the book-keeper rose tremulously to his feet, a strange and stealthy  figure, the cynosure of all eyes but the bushrangers' for a long minute,  reached the open end of the veranda; and with a final spring, a tall man in  silk pyjamas, his gray beard flying over either shoulder, hurled himself upon  both bushrangers at once. With outspread fingers he clutched the scruff of each  neck at the self-same second, crash came the two heads together, and over went  the table with the three men over it.</p>
  <p>Shots  were fired in the struggle on the ground, happily without effect. Stingaree had  his shooting hand mangled by one blow with a chair whirled from a height.  Carmichael got his heel with a venomous stamp upon the neck of Howie; and, in  fewer seconds than it would take to write their names, the rascals were  defeated and disarmed. Howie had his neck half broken, and his face was  darkening before Carmichael could be induced to lift his foot.</p>
  <p>"The  cockroach!" bawled the manager, drunk with battle. "I'd hoof his soul out for  two pins!"</p>
  <p>A  moment later he was groping for his glasses, which had slipped and fallen from  his perspiring nose, and making use of such expressions withal as to compel a  panting protest from the tall man in the silken stripes.</p>
  <p>"My  name is Methuen," said he. "I know it's a special moment, but &mdash; do you mind?"</p>
  <p>Carmichael  found his glasses at that instant, adjusted them, stood up, and leant back to  view the Bishop; and his next words were the apology of the gentleman he should  have been.</p>
  <p>"My  dear fellow," cried the other, "I quite understand. What are they doing with  the ruffians? Have you any handcuffs? Is it far to the nearest police  barracks?"</p>
  <p>But  the next act of this moving melodrama was not the least characteristic of the  chief performance; for when Stingaree and partner had been not only handcuffed  but lashed hand and foot, and incarcerated in separate log-huts, with a guard  apiece; and when a mounted messenger had been despatched to the barracks at  Clare Corner, and the remnant raised a cheer for Bishop Methuen; it was then  that the fine fellow showed them the still finer stuff of which he was also  made. He invited all present to step back for a few minutes into the place of worship  which had been so charmingly prepared, so scandalously misused, and where he  hoped to see them all yet again in the evening, if it would not bore them to  give him a further and more formal hearing then.</p>
  <p>"I  won't keep them five minutes now," he whispered to Carmichael, as the men went  ahead to pick up the chairs and take their places, while the Bishop hobbled  after, still in his pyjamas, and with terribly inflamed and swollen feet. "And  then," he added, "I must ask you to send a buggy at once for my poor chaplain.  He did his gallant best, poor fellow, but I had to leave him fallen by the way.  I am an old miler, you know; it came easier to me; but the cinder-path and  running-shoes are a different story from hot sand and naked feet! And now, if  you please, I will strike one little blow while our hearts are still warm."</p>
  <p>But  how shrewdly he struck it, how straight from the shoulder, how simply, how  honestly, there is perhaps no need to tell even those who have no previous  knowledge of back-block Bishop Methuen and his manly ways.</p>
  <p>What  afterward happened to Stingaree is another matter, to be set forth faithfully  in the sequel. This is the story of the Purification of Mulfera Station,  N.S.W., in which the bushrangers played but an indirect and a most inglorious  part.</p>
  <p>The  Bishop and his chaplain (a good man of no present account) stayed to see the  police arrive that night, and the romantic ruffians taken thence next morning  in unromantic bonds. Comparatively little attention was paid to their departure  &mdash; partly on account of the truculent attitude of the police &mdash; partly because  the Episcopal pair were making an equally early start in another direction. No  one accompanied the armed men and the bound. But every man on the place, from  homestead, men's hut, rabbiter's tent, and boundary-rider's camp &mdash; every single  man who could be mustered for the nonce had a horse run up for him &mdash; escorted  Dr. Methuen in close cavalcade to the Mulfera boundary, where the final  cheering took place, led by Carmichael, who, of course, was font and origin of  the display. And Carmichael rode by himself on the way back; he had been much  with the Bishop during his lordship's stay; and he was too morose for profanity  during the remainder of that day.</p>
  <p>But  it was no better when the manager's mood lifted, and the life on Mulfera  slipped back into the old blinding and perspiring groove.</p>
  <p>Then  one night, a night of the very week thus sensationally begun, the ingenious  Chaucer began one of the old, old stories, on the moonlit veranda, and  Carmichael stopped him while that particular old story was still quite young in  the telling. There was an awkward pause until Carmichael laughed.</p>
  <p>"I  don't care twopence what you fellows think of me," said he, "and never did. I  saw a lot of the Bishop," he went on, less aggressively, after a pause.</p>
  <p>"So <i>we</i> saw," assented Smart.</p>
  <p>"You  bet!" added Chaucer.</p>
  <p>For  they were two to one.</p>
  <p>"He  ran the mile for Oxford," continued Carmichael. "Two years he ran it &mdash; and won  both times. You may not appreciate quite what that means."</p>
  <p>And,  with a patience foreign to his character as they knew it, Carmichael proceeded  to explain.</p>
  <p>"But,"  he added, "that was nothing to his performance last Sunday, in getting here  from beyond the boundary in the time he did it in-barefoot! It would have been good  enough in shoes. But don't you forget his feet. I can see them &mdash; and feel them  &mdash; still."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  he's a grand chap," the overseer allowed.</p>
  <p>"We  never said he wasn't," his ally chimed in.</p>
  <p>Carmichael  took no notice of a tone which the youth with the putty face had never employed  toward him before.</p>
  <p>"He  was also in his school eleven," continued Carmichael, still in a reflective  fashion.</p>
  <p>"Was  it a public school?" inquired Smart.</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"<i>The</i> public school?" added Chaucer.</p>
  <p>"Not  mine, if that's what you mean," returned Carmichael, with just a touch of his  earlier manner. "But &mdash; he knew my old Head Master &mdash; he was quite a pal of the  dear Old Man! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We had such lots in common," added the manager,  more to himself than to the other two.</p>
  <p>The  overseer's comment is of no consequence. What the book-keeper was emboldened to  add matters even less. Suffice it that between them they brought the old  Carmichael to his feet, his glasses flaming in the moonshine, his body thrown  pugilistically backward, his jaw jutting like a crag &mdash; the old Carmichael in  deed &mdash; but not in word.</p>
  <p>"I  told you just now I didn't care twopence what either of you thought of me," he  roared, "though there wasn't the least necessity to tell you, because you knew!  So I needn't repeat myself; but just listen a moment, and try not to be greater  fools than God made you. You saw a real man last Sunday, and so did I. I had  almost forgotten what they were like &mdash; that quality. Well, we had a lot of  talk, and he told me what they are doing on some of the other stations. They  are holding services, something like what he held here, every Sunday night for  themselves. Now, it isn't in human nature to fly from one extreme to the other:  but we are going to have a try to keep up our Sunday end with the other  stations; at least I am, and you two are going to back me up."</p>
  <p>He  paused. Not a syllable from the pair.</p>
  <p>"Do  you hear me?" thundered Carmichael, as he had thundered in the dormitory at  school, now after twenty years in the same good cause once more. "Whether you  like it or not, you fellows are going to back me up!"</p>
  <p>And  Carmichael was a mighty man, whose influence was not to be withstood.</p>

  A Duel in the Desert</b></h2>
  <p>It  was eight o'clock and Monday morning when the romantic rascals were led away in  unromantic bonds. Their arms were bound to their bodies, their feet lashed to  the stirrup-irons; they sat like packs upon quiet station horses, carefully  chosen for the nonce; they were tethered to a mounted policeman apiece, each  with leading-rein buckled to his left wrist and Government revolver in his  right hand. Behind the quartette rode the officer in command, superbly mounted,  watching ever all four with a third revolver ready cocked. It seemed a small  and yet an ample escort for the two bound men.</p>
  <p>But  Stingaree was by no means in that state of Napoleonic despair which his bent  back and lowering countenance were intended to convey. He had not uttered a  word since the arrival of the police, whom he had suffered to lift him on  horseback, as he now sat, without raising his morose eyes once. Howie, on the  other hand, had offered a good deal of futile opposition, cursing his captors  as the fit moved him, and once struggling so insanely in his bonds as to earn a  tap from the wrong end of a revolver and a bloody face for his pains. Stingaree  glowered in deep delight. His mate's part was as well acted as his own; but it  was he who had conceived them both, and expounded them in countless camps  against some such extremity as this. The result was in ideal accordance with  his calculations. The man who gave the trouble was the man to watch. And  Stingaree, chin on chest, was left in peace to evolve a way of escape.</p>
  <p>The  chances were all adverse; he had never been less sanguine in his life. Not that  Stingaree had much opinion of the police; he had slipped through their hands  too often; but it was an unfortunate circumstance that two of the present trio  were among those whom he had eluded most recently, and who therefore would be  least likely to give him another chance. A lightning student of his kind, he  based his only hope upon an accurate estimate of these men, and applied his  whole mind to the triple task. But it was a single task almost from the first;  for the policeman in charge of him was none other than his credulous old  friend, Sergeant Cameron from Clear Corner; and Howie's custodian, a young  trooper run from the same mould as Constable Tyler and many a hundred more, in  whom a thick skull cancelled a stout heart. Both were brave men; neither was  really to be feared. But the man behind upon the thoroughbred, the man in  front, the man now on this side and now on that, with his braying laugh and his  vindictive voice &mdash; triumphant as though he had taken the bushrangers himself,  and a blatant bully in his triumph &mdash; was none other than the formidable Superintendent  whose undying animosity the bushrangers had earned by the two escapades  associated with his name.</p>
  <p>Yet  the outlaw never flattered him with word or look, never lifted chin from chest,  never raised an eye or opened his mouth until Howie's knock on the head caused  him to curse his mate for a fool who deserved all he got. The thoroughbred was  caracoling on his other side in an instant.</p>
  <p>"You  ain't one, are you?" cried the taunting tongue of Superintendent Cairns. "Not  much fool about Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>The  time had come for a reply.</p>
  <p>"So  I thought until yesterday," sighed the bushranger. "But now I'm not so sure."</p>
  <p>"Not  so sure, eh? You were sure enough last time we met, my beauty!"</p>
  <p>"Yes!  I had some conceit of myself then," said Stingaree, with another of his convincing  sighs.</p>
  <p>"To  say nothing of when you guyed me, damn you!" added the Superintendent, below  his breath and through his teeth.</p>
  <p>"Well,"  replied the outlaw, "you've got your revenge. I must expect you to rub it in."</p>
  <p>"My  fine friend," rejoined Cairns, "you may expect worse than that, and still you  won't be disappointed."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  made no reply; and it would have taken a very shrewd eye to have read deeper  than the depth of sullen despair expressed in every inch of his bound body and  every furrow of his downcast face. Even the vindictive Cairns ceased for a time  to crow over so abject an adversary in so bitter an hour. Meanwhile, the five  horses streamed slowly through the high lights and heavy shadows of a winding  avenue of scrub. It was like a hot-house in the dense, low trees: not a  wandering wind, not a waking bird; but five faces that dripped steadily in the  shade, and all but caught fire in the sun. Ahead rode Howie, dazed and  bleeding, with his callous young constable; the sergeant and his chief, with  Stingaree between them, now brought up the rear. By degrees Stingaree raised  his chin a little, but still looked neither right nor left.</p>
  <p>"Cheer  up!" cried the chief, with soothing irony.</p>
  <p>"I  feel the heat," said the bound man, uncomplainingly. "And it was just about  here it happened."</p>
  <p>"What  happened?"</p>
  <p>"We  overtook the Church militant here on earth," rejoined the bushranger, with  rueful irreverence.</p>
  <p>"Well,  you ran against a snag that time, Mr. Sanguinary Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>"I  couldn't resist turning Howie into the Bishop and making myself his mouthpiece.  I daren't let him open his lips! It wasn't the offertory that was worth having;  it was the fun of rounding up that congregation on the homestead veranda, and  never letting them spot a thing till we'd showed our guns. There hadn't been a  hitch, and never would have been if that old Bishop hadn't run all those miles  barefoot over hot sand and taken us unawares."</p>
  <p>Made  with wry humor and a philosophic candor, alike germane to his predicament,  these remarks seemed natural enough to one knowing little of Stingaree. They  seemed just the sort of things that Stingaree would say. The effect, however,  was rather to glorify Bishop Methuen at the expense of Superintendent Cairns,  who strove to reverse it with some dexterity.</p>
  <p>"You  certainly ran against a snag," he repeated, "and now your mate's run against  another." He gave the butt of his ready pistol a significant tap. "But I'm the  worst snag that ever either of you struck," he went on in his vainglory. "Make  no mistake about that. And the worst day's work that ever you did in your life,  Mr. Sanguinary Stingaree, was when you dared to play at being little crooked  Cairns."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  took a first good look at his man. After all he was not so crooked on horseback  as he had seemed on foot at dusk in the Victorian bush; his hump was even less  pronounced than Stingaree himself had made it on Rosanna; it looked more like a  ridge of extra muscle across a pair of abnormally broad and powerful shoulders.  There was the absence of neck which this deformity suggests; there was a great  head lighted by flashing and indignant eyes, but mounted only on its mighty  chin. The bushranger was conceited enough to find in the flesh a coarser and  more common type than that created by himself for the honor of the road. But  this did not make the real Superintendent a less formidable foe.</p>
  <p>"The  most poetic justice!" murmured Stingaree, and resumed in an instant his  apathetic pose.</p>
  <p>"It  serves you jolly well right, if that's what you mean," the Superintendent snarled.  "You've yourself and your own mighty cheek to thank for taking me out of my  shell and putting me on your tracks in earnest. But it was high time they knew  the cut of my jib up here; the fools won't forget me again in a hurry. And you,  you devil, you sha'n't forget me till your dying day!"</p>
  <p>On  Stingaree's off-side Sergeant Cameron was also hanging an insulted head. But  the bushranger laughed softly in his chest.</p>
  <p>"Someone  has got to do your dirty work," said he. "I did it that time, and the Bishop  has done it now; but you shouldn't blame me for helping your fellows to bring a  murderer to justice."</p>
  <p>"You  guyed me," said Cairns through his teeth. "I heard all about it. You guyed me,  blight your soul!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  felt that he was missing a strong face finely convulsed with passion &mdash; as  indeed he was. But he had already committed the indiscretion of a repartee,  which was scarcely consistent with an attitude of extreme despair. A downcast  silence seemed the safest policy after all.</p>
  <p>"It  used to be forty miles to the Corner," he murmured, after a time. "We can't  have come more than ten."</p>
  <p>"Not  so much," snapped the Superintendent.</p>
  <p>"Going  to stop for feed at Mazeppa Station?"</p>
  <p>"That's  my business."</p>
  <p>"It's  a long day for three of you, in this heat, with two of us."</p>
  <p>"The  time won't hang heavy on <i>our</i> hands."</p>
  <p>"Not  heavy enough, I should have thought. I wonder you didn't bring some of the boys  from Mulfera along with you."</p>
  <p>Superintendent  Cairns brayed his high, harsh laugh.</p>
  <p>"Yes,  you wonder, and so did they," said he. "But I know a bit too much. There'll  always be sympathy among scum like them for thicker scum like you!"</p>
  <p>"You're  too suspicious," said Stingaree, mildly. "But I was thinking of the Bishop and  the boss."</p>
  <p>"They've  gone their own way," growled Cairns, "and it's just as well it wasn't our way.  I'd have stood no interference from them!"</p>
  <p>That  had been his attitude on the station. Stingaree had heard of his rudeness to  those to whom the whole credit of the capture belonged; the man revealed his  character as freely as an angry child; and, indeed, a childish character it  was. Arrogance was its strength and weakness: a suggestion had only to be made  to call down either the insolence of office or the malice of denial for  denial's sake.</p>
  <p>"I  wish you'd stop a bit at Mazeppa," whined Stingaree, drooping like a candle in  the heat.</p>
  <p>The  station roofs gleamed through the trees far off the track.</p>
  <p>"Why?"</p>
  <p>"Because  I'm feeling sick."</p>
  <p>"Gammon!  You've got some friends there; on you push!"</p>
  <p>"But  you will camp somewhere in the heat of the day?"</p>
  <p>"I'll  do as I think fit. I sha'n't consult you, my fine friend."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  drooped and nodded, lower and lower; then recovered himself with a jerk, like  one battling against sleep. The party pushed on for another hour. The heat was  terrible; the bound men endured torments in their bonds. But the nature of the  Superintendent, deformed like his body, declared itself duly at every turn, and  the more one prisoner groaned and the other blasphemed, the greater the zest  and obduracy of the driving force behind them.</p>
  <p>Noon  passed; the scanty shadows lengthened; and Howie gave more trouble of an  insensate sort. They reined up, and lashed him tighter; he had actually  loosened his cords. But Stingaree seemed past remonstrance with friend or foe,  and his bound body swayed from side to side as the little cavalcade went on at  a canter to make up for lost time.</p>
  <p>He  was leading now with the kindly sergeant, and his mind had never been more  alert. Behind them thundered the recalcitrant Howie with constable and  Superintendent on either side. They were midway between Mazeppa and Clear  Corner, or some fifteen miles from either haunt of men. Stingaree pulled  himself upright in the saddle as by a superhuman effort, and shook off the  helping hand that held him by one elbow.</p>
  <p>He  was about to do a thing at which even his courage quailed, and he longed for  the use of his right arm. It was not absolutely bound; the hand and wrist had  been badly hurt in the Sunday's fray &mdash; so badly that it had been easy to sham a  fracture, and have hand and wrist in splints before the arrival of the police.  They still hung before him in a sling, his good right hand and fore-arm, stiff  and sore enough, yet strong and ready at a moment's notice, when the moment  came. It had not come, and was not coming for a long time, when Stingaree set  his teeth, lurched either way &mdash; and toppled out of the saddle in the path of  the cantering hoofs. His lashed feet held him in the stirrups; the off  stirrup-leather had come over with his weight; and there at his horse's hoofs, kicked  and trampled and smothered with blood and dust, he dragged like an anchor,  without sign of life.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1701251h-images/page198.jpg" width="478" height="750"></p>
  <p>And  it was worse even than it looked, for the life never left him for an instant,  nor ever for an instant did he fail to behave as though it had. Minutes later,  when they had stopped his horse, and cut him down from the stirrups, and  carried him into the shade of a hop-bush off the track, and when Stingaree  dared to open his eyes, he was nearer closing them perforce, and the scene swam  before him with superfluous realism.</p>
  <p>Cairns  and Cameron, dismounted (while the trooper sat aloof with Howie in the saddle),  were at high words about their prostrate prisoner. Not a syllable was lost on  Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"You  may put him across the horse yourself," said the sergeant. "I won't have a hand  in it. But make sure you haven't killed him as it is &mdash; travelling a sick man  like that."</p>
  <p>"Killed  him? He's got his eyes open!" cried Cairns in savage triumph. Stingaree lay  blinking at the sky. "Do you still refuse to do your duty?"</p>
  <p>"Cruelty  to animals is no duty of mine," declared the sergeant: "let alone my fellowmen,  bushrangers or no bushrangers."</p>
  <p>"And  you?" thundered Cairns at the mounted constable.</p>
  <p>"I'm  with the sergeant," said he. "He's had enough."</p>
  <p>"Right!"  cried the Superintendent, producing a note-book and scribbling venomously. "You  both refuse! You will hear more of this; meanwhile, sergeant, I should like to  know what your superior wisdom may be pleased to suggest."</p>
  <p>"Send  a cart back for him," said Cameron. "It's the only way he's fit to travel."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  sought to prop himself upon the elbow of the splintered wrist and hand.</p>
  <p>"There  are no more bones broken that I know of," said he, faintly. "But I felt bad  before, and now I feel worse."</p>
  <p>"He  looks it, too," observed the sergeant, as Stingaree, ghastly enough beneath his  blood and dust, rolled over on his back once more, and lay effectively with  closed eyes. Even the Superintendent was impressed.</p>
  <p>"Then  what's to be done with him?" he exclaimed, with an oath. "What's to be done?"</p>
  <p>"If  you ask me," returned Cameron, "I should make him comfortable where he is;  after all, he's a human being, and done no murder, that we should run the risk  of murdering him. Leave him to me while you two push on with his mate; then one  of you can get back with the spring-cart before sundown; but trust me to look  after him till you do."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  held his breath where he lay. His excitement was not to be betrayed by the  opening of an eye. And yet he knew that the Superintendent was looking the  sergeant up and down, and he guessed what was passing through that suspicious  mind.</p>
  <p>"Trust  you!" rasped the dictatorial voice at last. "That's the very thing I'm not  inclined to do, Sergeant Cameron."</p>
  <p>"Sir!"</p>
  <p>"Keep  your temper, sergeant. I don't say you'd let him go. But I've got to remember  that this man has twisted you round his finger before today, led you by the  hand like a blessed old child, and passed himself off for me! Look at the  fellow; look at me; and ask yourself candidly if you're the man for the job. But  don't ask me, unless you want my opinion of you a bit plainer still. No; you go  on with the others. The two of you can manage Howie; if you can't, you put a  bullet through him! This is my man; and I'm his, by the hokey, as he'll know if  he tries any of his tricks while you're gone!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  did not move a muscle. He might have been dead; and in his disappointment it  was the easier to lie as though he were. Really bruised, really battered,  really faint and stiff and sore, to say nothing of his bonds, he felt himself  physically no match for so young a man &mdash; with the extra breadth of shoulder and  the extra length of arm which were part and parcel of his deformity. With the  elderly sergeant he might have had a chance, man to man, one arm to two; but  with Superintendent Cairns his only weapons were his wits. He lay quite still  and reviewed the situation, as it was, and as it had been. In the very moment  of his downfall, by instinctive presence of mind he had preserved the use of  his right hand, and that was a still unsuspected asset of incalculable worth.  It had been the nucleus of all his plans; without a hand he must have resigned  himself to the inevitable from the first. Then he had split up the party. He  heard the sergeant and the constable ride off with Howie, exactly as he had  intended two of the three captors to do. His fall alone introduced the element  of luck. It might have killed or maimed him; but the risk had been run with  open eyes. Being alive and whole, he had reduced the odds from three against  two to man and man; and the difference was enormous, even though one man held  all the cards. Against Howie the odds were heavier than ever, but Howie was  eliminated from present calculations. And as Stingaree made them with the  upturned face of seeming insensibility, he heard a nonchalant step come and go,  but knew an eye was on him all the time, and never opened his own till the  striking of a match was followed by the smell of bush tobacco.</p>
  <p>The  shadow of the hop-bush was spreading like spilt ink, and for the moment  Stingaree thought he had it to himself. But a wreath of blue smoke hovered  overhead; and when he got to his elbow, and glanced behind, there sat Cairns in  his shirt-sleeves, filling the niche his body made in the actual green bush, a  swollen wet water-bag at his feet, his revolver across his knees. There was an  ominous click even as Stingaree screwed round where he lay.</p>
  <p>"Give  me a drink!" he cried at sight of the humid canvas bag.</p>
  <p>"Why  should I?" asked the Superintendent, smoking on.</p>
  <p>"Because  I haven't had one since we started &mdash; because I'm parched with thirst."</p>
  <p>"Parch  away!" cried the creature of suspicion. "You can't help yourself, and I can't  help you with this baby to nurse."</p>
  <p>And  he fondled the cocked revolver in his hands.</p>
  <p>"Very  well! Don't give me one!" exclaimed Stingaree, and dealt the moist bag a kick  that sent a jet of cold water spurting over his foot. He expected to be kicked  himself for that; he was only cursed, the bag snatched out of his reach, and  deeply drained before his eyes.</p>
  <p>"I was  going to give you some," said Cairns, smacking his lips. "Now your tongue may  hang out before I do."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  left the last word with the foe: it was part of his preconceived policy. He  still regretted his solitary retort, but not for a moment the more petulant act  which he had just committed. His boots had been removed after his fall; one of  his socks was now wet through, and he spent the next few minutes in taking it  off with the other foot. The lengthy process seemed to afford his mind a  certain pensive entertainment. It was a shapely and delicate white foot that  lay stripped at last &mdash; a foot that its owner, with nothing better to do, could  contemplate with legitimate satisfaction. But Superintendent Cairns, noting his  prisoner's every look, and putting his own confident interpretation on them  all, cursed him afresh for a conceited pig, and filled another pipe, with the  revolver for an instant by his side.</p>
  <p>Stingaree  took no interest in his proceedings; the revolver he especially ignored, and  lay stretched before his captor, one sock off and one sock on, one arm in  splints and sling and the other bound to his ribs, a model prisoner whose last  thought was of escape. His legs, indeed, were free; but a man who could not sit  on a horse was not the man to run away. And then there was the relentless  Superintendent sitting over him, pipe in mouth, but revolver again in hand, and  a crooked finger very near the trigger.</p>
  <p>The  fiery wilderness still lay breathless in the great heat, but the lengthening  shadow of the hop-bush was now a thing to be thankful for, and in it the broken  captive fell into a fine semblance of natural slumber. Cairns watched with  alternate envy and suspicion; for him there could not be a wink; but most  likely the fellow was shamming all the time. No ruse, however, succeeded in  exposing the sham, which the Superintendent copied by breathing first heavily  and then stertorously, with one eye open and on his man. Stingaree never opened  one of his: there was no change in the regular breathing, in the peaceful  expression of the blood-stained face: asleep the man must be. The  Superintendent's own experiments had gone to show him that no extremity need  necessarily keep one awake in such heat. He stifled a yawn that was no part of  his performance. His pipe was out; he struck a match noisily on his boot; and  Stingaree just stirred, as naturally as any infant. But Stingaree's senses were  incredibly acute. He smelt every whiff of the rekindled pipe, knew to ten  seconds when it went out once more, and listened in an agony for another match.  None was struck. Was the Superintendent himself really asleep this time? He  breathed as though he were; but so did Stingaree; and yet was there hope in the  fact that his own greatest struggle all this time had been against the very  thing he feigned.</p>
  <p>At  last he opened one eye a little; it was met by no answering furtive glance; he  opened the other, and there could be no more doubt. The terrible Superintendent  was dozing in his place; but it was the lightest sort of doze, the eyes were  scarcely closed, and all but watching Stingaree, as the cocked revolver in the  relaxed hand all but covered him.</p>
  <p>The  prisoner felt that for the moment he was unseen, forgotten, but that the  lightest movement of his body would open those terrible eyes once and for all.  Be it remembered that he was lying under them lengthwise, on the bound arm,  with the arm in the sling uppermost, and easily to be freed, but yet the most  salient part of the recumbent figure, and that on which the hidden eyes still seemed  fixed, for all their lids. To make the least movement there, to attempt the  slowest withdrawal of hand and arm, was to court the last disaster of discovery  in such an act. But to lie motionless down to the thighs, and to execute a  flank movement with the leg uppermost, was a far less perilous exploit. It was  the leg with the bare foot: every detail had been foreseen. And now at last the  bare foot hovered over the revolver and the hand it held, while the upper man  yet lay like a log under those drowsy, dreadful eyes.</p>
  <p>Stingaree  took a last look at the barrel drooping from the slackened hand; the back of  the hand lay on the ground, the muzzle of the barrel was filled with sand, and  yet the angle was such that it was by no means sure whether a bullet would bury  itself in the sand or in Stingaree. He took the risk, and with his bare toe he  touched the trigger sharply. There was a horrible explosion. It brought the  drowsy Superintendent to his senses with such a jerk that it was as though the  smoking pistol had leapt out of his hand a thing alive, and so into the hand  that flashed to meet it from the sling. And almost in the same second &mdash; while  the double cloud of smoke and sand still hung between them &mdash; Stingaree sprang  from the ground, an armed man once more.</p>
  <p>"Sit  where you are!" he thundered. "Up with those hands before I shoot them to  shreds! Your life's in less danger than mine has been all day, but I'll wing  you limb by limb if you offer to budge!"</p>
  <p>With  uplifted hands above his ears, the deformed officer sat with head and shoulders  depressed into the semblance of one sphere. Not a syllable did he utter; but  his upturned eyes shot indomitable fires. Stingaree stood wriggling and  fumbling at the coil which bound his left arm to his side; suddenly the revolver  went off, as if by accident, but so much by design that there dangled two ends  of rope, cut and burnt asunder by lead and powder. In less than a minute the  bushranger was unbound, and before the minute was up he had leapt upon the  Superintendent's thoroughbred. It had been tethered all this time to a tree,  swishing tails with the station hack which Stingaree had ridden as a captive;  he now rode the thoroughbred, and led the hack, to the very feet of the  humiliated Cairns.</p>
  <p>"I  will thank you for that water-bag," said Stingaree. "I am much obliged. And now  I'll trouble you for that nice wideawake. You really don't need it in the  shade. Thank you so much!"</p>
  <p>He  received both bag and hat on the barrel of the Government revolver, hooking the  one to its proper saddle-strap, and clapping on the other at an angle  inimitably imitative of the outwitted officer.</p>
  <p>"I  won't carry the rehearsal any further to your face," continued Stingaree; "but  I can at least promise you a more flattering portrait than the last; and this excellent  coat, which you have so considerately left strapped to your saddle, should  contribute greatly to the verisimilitude. Dare I hope that you begin to  appreciate some of the points of my performance so far as it has gone? The  pretext on which I bared my foot for its delicate job under your very eyes, eh?  Not so vain as it looked, in either sense, I fancy! Should you have said that  your hand would recoil from a revolver the moment it went off? You see, I  staked my life on it, and I've won. And what about that fall? It was the  lottery! I was prepared to have my head cracked like an egg, and it's still  pretty sore. The broken wrist wasn't your fault; it had passed into the  accepted situation before you turned up. And you would certainly have seen that  I was shamming sleep if we hadn't both been so genuinely sleepy at the time. I  give you my word, I very nearly threw up the whole thing for forty winks! Any  other point on which you could wish enlightenment? Then let me thank you with  all my heart for one of the worst days, and some of the greatest moments, in my  whole career."</p>
  <p>But  the crooked man answered never a word, as he sat in a ball with uplifted palms,  and glaring, upturned, unconquerable eyes.</p>
  <p>"Good-by,  Mr. Superintendent Cairns," said Stingaree. "I'm afraid I've been rather cruel  to you &mdash; but you were never very nice to me!"</p>
  <p>Sergeant  Cameron was driving the spring-cart, toward sundown, after a variety of  unforeseen delays. Of a sudden out of the pink haze came a galloping figure,  slightly humped, in the inspector's coat and wideawake, with a bare foot  through one stirrup and only a sock on its fellow.</p>
  <p>"Where's  Stingaree?" screamed the sergeant, pulling up. And the galloper drew rein at  the driven horse's head.</p>
  <p>"Dead!"  said he, thickly. "He was worse than we thought. You fetch him while I&mdash;"</p>
  <p>But  this time the sergeant knew that voice too well, and his right hand had flown  to the back of his belt. Stingaree's shot was only first by a fraction of a  second, but it put a bullet through the brain of the horse between the shafts,  so that horse and shafts came down together, and the sergeant fired into the  earth as he fell across the splashboard.</p>
  <p>Stingaree  pressed soft heels into the thoroughbred's ribs and thundered on and on. Soon  there was a gate to open, and when he listened at that gate all was still  behind him and before; but far ahead the rolling plain was faintly luminous in  the dusk, and as this deepened into night a cluster of terrestrial lights  sprang out with the stars. Stingaree knew the handful of gaunt, unsheltered  huts the lights stood for. They were an inn, a store, and police-barracks:  Clear Corner on the map. The bushranger galloped straight up to the barracks,  but skirted the knot of men in the light before the veranda, and went jingling  round into the yard. The young constable in charge ran through the building and  met him dismounted at the back.</p>
  <p>"What's  the matter, sir?"</p>
  <p>"He's  gone!"</p>
  <p>"Stingaree?"</p>
  <p>"He  was worse than we thought. Your man all right?"</p>
  <p>"No  trouble whatever, sir. Only sick and sorry and saying his prayers in a way  you'd never credit. Come and hear him."</p>
  <p>"I  must come and see him at once. Got a fresh horse in?"</p>
  <p>"I  have so! In and saddled in the stall. I thought you might want one, sir, and  ran up Barmaid, Stingaree's own mare, that was sent out here from the station  when we had the news."</p>
  <p>"That  was very thoughtful of you. You'll get on, young man. Now lead the way with  that lamp."</p>
  <p>This  time Stingaree had spoken in gasps, like a man who had ridden very far, and the  young constable, unlike his sergeant, did not know his voice of old. Yet it  struck him at the last moment as more unlike the voice of Superintendent Cairns  than the hardest riding should have made it, and with the key in the door of  the cell the young fellow wheeled round and held the lamp on high. That instant  he was felled to the floor, the lamp went down and out with a separate yet  simultaneous crash, and Stingaree turned the key.</p>
  <p>"Howie!  Not a word &mdash; out you come!"</p>
  <p>The  burly ruffian crept forth with outstretched hands apart.</p>
  <p>"What!  Not even handcuffed?"</p>
  <p>"No;  turned over a new leaf the moment we left you, and been praying like a parson  for 'em all to hear!"</p>
  <p>"This  chap can do the same when he comes to himself. Lies pretty still, doesn't he?  In with him!"</p>
  <p>The  door clanged. The key was turned. Stingaree popped it into his pocket.</p>
  <p>"The  later they let him out the better. Here's the best mount you ever had. And my  sweetheart's waiting for me in the stable!"</p>
  <p>Outside,  in front, before the barracks veranda, an inquisitive little group heard first  the clang of the door within, and presently the clatter of hoofs coming round  from the yard. Stingaree and Howie &mdash; a white flash and a bay streak &mdash; swept  past them as they stood confounded. And the dwindling pair still bobbed in  sight, under a full complement of stars, when a fresh outcry from the cell, and  a mighty hammering against its locked door, broke the truth to one and all.</p>

  The Villain-Worshipper</b></h2>
  <p>There  was no more fervent admirer of Stingaree and all bushrangers than George Oswald  Abernethy Melvin. Despite this mellifluous nomenclature young Melvin helped his  mother to sell dance-music, ballads, melodeons, and a very occasional  pianoforte, in one of the several self-styled capitals of Riverina; and despite  both facts the mother was a lady of most gentle blood. The son could either  teach or tune the piano with a certain crude and idle skill. He endured a  monopoly of what little business the locality provided in this line, and sat  superior on the music-stool at all the dances. He had once sung tenor in Bishop  Methuen's choir, but, offended by a word of wise and kindly advice, was seen no  more in surplice or in church. It will be perceived that Oswald Melvin had all  the aggressive independence of Young Australia without the virility which leavens  the truer type.</p>
  <p>Yet  he was neither a base nor an unkind lad. His bane was a morbid temperament,  which he could no more help than his sallow face and weedy person; even his  vanity was directly traceable to the early influence of an eccentric and  feckless father with experimental ideas on the upbringing of a child. It was a  pity that brilliantly unsuccessful man had not lived to see the result of his  sedulous empiricism. His wife was left to bear the brunt &mdash; a brave exile whose  romantic history was never likely to escape her continent lips. None even knew  whether she saw any or one of those aggravated faults of an only child which  were so apparent to all her world.</p>
  <p>And  yet the worst of Oswald Melvin was known only to his own morbid and sensitive  heart. An unimpressive presence in real life, on his mind's stage he was ever  in the limelight with a good line on his lips. Not that he was invariably the  hero of these pieces. He could see himself as large with the noose round his  neck as in coronet or halo; and though this inward and spiritual temper may be  far from rare, there had been no one to kick out of him its outward and visible  expression. Oswald had never learned to gulp down the little lie which insures  a flattering attention; his clever father had even encouraged it in him as the  nucleus of imagination. Imagination he certainly had, but it fed on strong meat  for an unhealthy mind; it fattened on the sordid history of the earlier  bushrangers; its favorite fare was the character and exploits of Stingaree. The  sallow and neurotic face would brighten with morbid enthusiasm at the bare  mention of the desperado's name. The somewhat dull, dark eyes would lighten  with borrowed fires: the young fool wore an eye-glass in one of them when he  dared.</p>
  <p>"Stingaree,"  he would say, "is the greatest man in all Australia." He had inherited from his  father a delight in uttering startling opinions; but this one he held with  unusual sincerity. It had come to all ears, and was the subject of that  episcopal compliment which Oswald took as an affront. The impudent little  choristers supported his loss by calling "Stingaree!" after him in the street:  he was wise to keep his eye-glass for the house.</p>
  <p>There,  however, with a few even younger men who admired his standpoint and revelled in  his store of criminous annals, or with his patient, inscrutable mother, Oswald  Melvin was another being. His language became bright and picturesque, his  animation surprising. A casual customer would sometimes see this side of him,  and carry away the impression of a rare young dare-devil. And it was one such  who gave Oswald the first great moment of his bush life.</p>
  <p>"Not  been down from the back-blocks for three years?" he had asked, as he showed a  tremulous and dilapidated bushman how to play the instrument that he had bought  with the few shillings remaining out of his check. "Been on the spree and going  back to drive a whim until you've enough to go on another? How I wish you'd  tell that to our high and mighty Lord Bishop of all the Back&mdash;Blocks! I should  like to see his face and hear him on the subject; but I suppose he's new since  you were down here last? Never come across him, eh? But, of course, you heard  how good old Stingaree scored off him the other day, after he thought he'd  scored off Stingaree?"</p>
  <p>The  whim-driver had heard something about it. Young Melvin plunged into the  congenial narrative and emerged minutes later in a dusky glow.</p>
  <p>"That's  the man for my money," he perorated. "Stingaree, sir, is the greatest chap in  all these Colonies, and deserves to be Viceroy when they get Federation.  Thunderbolt, Morgan, Ben Hall and Ned Kelly were not a circumstance between  them to Stingaree; and the silly old Bishop's a silly old fool to him! I don't  care twopence about right and wrong. That's not the point. The one's a Force,  and the other isn't."</p>
  <p>"A  darned sight too much force, to my mind," observed the whim-driver with some  warmth.</p>
  <p>"You  don't take my meaning," the superior youth pursued. "It's a question of  personality."</p>
  <p>"A  bit more personal than you think," was the dark rejoinder.</p>
  <p>"How  do you mean?"</p>
  <p>Melvin's  tone had altered in an instant.</p>
  <p>"I  know too much about him."</p>
  <p>"At  first hand?" the youth asked, with bated breath.</p>
  <p>"Double  first!" returned the other, with a muddled glimmer of better things.</p>
  <p>"You  never knew him, did you?" whispered Oswald.</p>
  <p>"Knew  him? I've been taken prisoner by him," said the whim-driver, with the pause of  a man who hesitates to humiliate himself, but is lost for the sake of that same  sensation which Oswald Melvin loved to create.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Melvin was in the back room, wistfully engrossed in an English magazine sent  that evening from Bishop's Lodge. The bad blood in the son had not affected Dr.  Methuen's keen but tactful interest in the mother. She looked up in tolerant  consternation as her Oswald pushed an unsavory bushman before him into the  room; but even through her gentle horror the mother's love shone with that  steady humor which raised it above the sphere of obvious pathos.</p>
  <p>"Here's  a man who's been stuck up by Stingaree!" he cried, boyish enough in his  delight. "Do keep an eye on the show, mother, and let him tell me all about it,  as he's good enough to say he will. Is there any whiskey?"</p>
  <p>"Not  for me!" put in the whim-driver, with a frank shudder. "I should like a drink  of tea out of a cup, if I'm to have anything."</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Melvin left them with a good-humored word besides her promise. She had given no  sign of injury or disapproval; she was not one of the wincing sort; and the  tremulous tramp was in her own chair before her back was turned.</p>
  <p>"Now  fire away!" cried the impatient Oswald.</p>
  <p>"It's  a long story," said the whim-driver; and his dirty brows were knit in thought.</p>
  <p>"Let's  have it," coaxed the young man. And the other's thoughtful creases vanished  suddenly in the end.</p>
  <p>"Very  well," said he, "since it means a drink of tea out of a cup! It was only the  other day, in a dust-storm away back near the Darling, as bad a one as ever I  was out in. I was bushed and done for, gave it up and said my prayers. Then I  practically died in my tracks, and came to life in a sunny clearing later in  the day. The storm was over; two coves had found me and carried me to their  camp; and as soon as I saw them I spotted one for Howie and the other for  Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>The  narrative went no farther for a time. The thrilling youth fired question and  leading question like a cross-examining counsel in a fever to conclude his  case. The tea arrived, but the whim-driver had to help himself. His host  neglected everything but the first chance he had ever had of hearing of  Stingaree or any other bushranger at first-hand.</p>
  <p>"And  how long were you there?"</p>
  <p>"About  a week."</p>
  <p>"What  happened then?"</p>
  <p>The  whim-driver paused in doubt renewed.</p>
  <p>"You  will never guess."</p>
  <p>"Tell  me."</p>
  <p>"They  waited for the next dust-storm, and then cast me adrift in that."</p>
  <p>Oswald  stared; he would never have guessed, indeed. The unhealthy light faded from his  sallow face. Even his morbid enthusiasm was a little damped.</p>
  <p>"You  must have done something to deserve it," he cried, at last.</p>
  <p>"I  did," was the reply, with hanging head. "I&mdash; I tried to take him."</p>
  <p>"Take  your benefactor &mdash; take him prisoner?"</p>
  <p>"Yes  &mdash; the man who saved my life."</p>
  <p>Melvin  sat staring: it was a stare of honestly incredulous disgust. Then he sprang to  his feet, a brighter youth than ever, his depression melted like a cloud. His  villainous hero was an heroic villain after all! His heart of hearts &mdash; which  was not black &mdash; could still render whole homage to Stingaree! He no longer  frowned on his informer as on a thing accursed. The creature had wiped out his  original treachery to Stingaree by replacing the uninjured idol in its niche in  this warped mind. Oswald, however, had made his repugnance only too plain; he  was unable to elicit another detail; and in a very few minutes Mrs. Melvin was  back in her place, though not before flicking it with her handkerchief,  undetected by her son.</p>
  <p>It  was certainly a battered and hang-dog figure that stole away into the bush. Yet  the creature straightened as he strode into star-light undefiled by earthly  illumination; his palsy left him; presently as he went he began fingering the  new melodeon in the way of a man who need not have sought elementary  instruction from Oswald Melvin. And now a shining disk filled one unwashed eye.</p>
  <p>Stingaree  lay a part of that night beside the milk-white mare that he had left tethered  in a box-clump quite near the town; at sunrise he knelt and shaved on the  margin of a Government tank, before breaking the mirror by plunging in. And  before the next stars paled he was snugly back in older haunts, none knowing of  his descent upon those of men.</p>
  <p>There  or thereabouts, hidden like the needle in the hay, and yet ubiquitous in the  stack, the bushranger remained for months. Then there was an encounter, not the  first of this period, but the first in which shots were exchanged. One of these  pierced the lungs of his melodeon &mdash; an instrument more notorious by this time  than the musical-box before it &mdash; a still greater treasure to Stingaree. That  was near the full of a certain summer moon; it was barely waning to the eye  when the battered buyer of melodeons came for a new one to the shop in the  pretty bush town.</p>
  <p>The  shop was closed for the night, but Stingaree knocked at a lighted window under  the veranda, which Mrs. Melvin presently threw up. Her eyes flashed when she  recognized one against whom she now harbored a bitterness on quite a different  plane of feeling from her former repulsion. Even to his first glance she looked  an older and a harder woman.</p>
  <p>"I  am sorry to see you," she said, with a soft vehemence plainly foreign to  herself. "I almost hate the sight of you! You have been the ruin of my son!"</p>
  <p>"His  ruin?"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  forgot the speech of the unlettered stockman; but his cry was too short to do  worse than warn him.</p>
  <p>"Come  round," continued Mrs. Melvin, austerely. "I will see you. You shall hear what  you have done."</p>
  <p>In  another minute he was in the parlor where he had sat aforetime. He never dreamt  of sitting now. But the lady took her accustomed chair as a queen her throne.</p>
  <p>"<i>Is</i> he ruined?" asked Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"Not  irrevocably &mdash; not yet; but he may be any moment. He must be before long."</p>
  <p>"But  &mdash; but what ails him, madame?"</p>
  <p>"Villain-worship!"  cried the lady, with a tragic face stripped of all its humor, and bare without  it as a winter's tree.</p>
  <p>"I  remember! Yes &mdash; I understand. He was mad about &mdash; Stingaree."</p>
  <p>"It  is madness now," said the bitter mother. "It was only a stupid, hare-brained  fancy then, but now it is something worse. You're the first to whom I have  admitted it," she continued, with illogical indignation, "because it's all  through you!"</p>
  <p>"All  through me?"</p>
  <p>"You  told him a tale. You made that villain a greater hero in his eyes than ever.  You made him real."</p>
  <p>"He  is real enough, God knows!"</p>
  <p>"But  you made him so to my son." The keen eyes softened for one divine instant  before they filled. "And I&mdash; I am talking my own boy over with &mdash; with &mdash;"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  stood in twofold embarrassment. Did she know after all who he was? And what had  he said he was, the time before?</p>
  <p>"The  lowest of the low," he answered, with a twitch of his unshaven lips.</p>
  <p>"No!  That you were not, or are not, whatever you may say. You &mdash;" she hesitated  sweetly &mdash;"you had been unsteady when you were here before." He twitched again,  imperceptibly. "I am thankful to see that you are now more like what you must  once have been. I can bear to tell you of my boy. Oh, sir, can you bear with  me?"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  twitched no more. Rich as the situation was, keenly as he had savored its  unsuspected irony, the humor was all over for him. Here was a woman, still  young, sweet and kind, and gentle as a childish memory, with her fine eyes full  of tears! That was bad enough. To make it worse, she went on to tell him of her  son, him an outlaw, him a bushranger with a price upon his skin, as she might  have outlined the case to a consulting physician. The boy had been born in the  trouble of her early exile; he could not help his temperament. He had countless  virtues; she extolled him in beaming parentheses. But he had too much  imagination and too little balance. He was morbidly wrapped up in the whole  subject of romantic crime, and no less than possessed with the personality of  this one romantic criminal.</p>
  <p>"I  should be ashamed to tell you the childish lengths to which he has gone," she  went on, "if he were quite himself on the point. But indeed he is not. He is  Stingaree in his heart, Stingaree in his dreams; it is as debasing a form as  mental and temperamental weakness could well take; yet I know, who watch over  him half of the night. He has an eye-glass; he keeps revolvers; he has even  bought a white mare! He can look extremely like the portraits one has seen of  the wretched man. But come with me one moment."</p>
  <p>She  took the lamp and led the way into the little room where Oswald Melvin slept.  He had slept in it from that boyhood in which the brave woman had opened this  sort of shop entirely for his sake. Music was his only talent; he was obviously  not to be a genius in the musical world; but it was the only one in which she  could foresee the selfish, self-willed child figuring with credit, and her  foresight was only equalled by her resource. The business was ripe and ready  for him when he grew up. And this was what he was making of it.</p>
  <p>But  Stingaree saw only the little bed that had once been far too large, the Bible  still by its side, read or unread, the parents' portraits overhead. The mother  was looking in an opposite direction; he followed her eyes, and there at the  foot, where the infatuated fool could see it last thing at night and first in  the morning, was an enlarged photograph of the bushranger himself.</p>
  <p>It  had been taken in audacious circumstances a year or two before. A travelling  photographer had been one of yet another coach-load turned out and stood in a  line by the masterful masterless man.</p>
  <p>"Now  you may take my photograph. The police refuse to know me when we do meet. Give  them a chance."</p>
  <p>And  he had posed on the spot with eye-glass up and pistols pointed, as he saw  himself now, not less than a quarter life-size, in a great gaudy frame. But  while he stared Mrs. Melvin had been rummaging in a drawer, and when he turned  she was staring in her turn with glassy eyes. In her hands was an empty  mahogany case with velvet moulds which ought to have been filled by a brace of  missing revolvers.</p>
  <p>"He  kept it locked &mdash; he kept them in it!" she gasped. "He may have done it this very  night!"</p>
  <p>"Done  what?"</p>
  <p>"Stuck  up the Deniliquin mail. That is his maddest dream. I have heard him boast of it  to his friends &mdash; the brainless boys who alone look up to him &mdash; I have even  heard him rave of it in his dreams!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  was heavy for a moment with a mental calculation. His head was a time-table of  Cobb's coaches on the Riverina road-system; he nodded it as he located the  imperilled vehicle.</p>
  <p>"A  dream it shall remain," said he. "But there's not a moment to lose!"</p>
  <p>"Do  you propose to follow and stop him?"</p>
  <p>"If  he really means it."</p>
  <p>"He  may not. He will ride at night. He is often out as late."</p>
  <p>"Going  and coming about the same time?"</p>
  <p>"Yes  &mdash; now I think of it."</p>
  <p>"Then  his courage must have failed him hitherto, and it probably will again."</p>
  <p>"But  if not!"</p>
  <p>"I  will cure him. But I must go at once. I have a horse not far away. I will  gallop and meet the coach; if it is still safe, as you may be sure it will be,  I shall scour the country for your son. I can tell him a fresh thing or two  about Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>"God  bless you!"</p>
  <p>"Leave  him to me."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  may God bless you always!"</p>
  <p>His  hands were in a lady's hands once more. Stingaree withdrew them gently. And he  looked his last into the brave wet eyes raised gratefully to his.</p>
  <p>The  villain-worshipper was indeed duly posted in a certain belt of trees through  which the coach-route ran, about half-way between the town and the first stage  south. It was not his first nocturnal visit to the spot; often, as his  prototype divined, had the mimic would-be desperado sat trembling on his hoary  screw, revolvers ready, while the red eyes of the coach dilated down the road;  and as often had the cumbrous ship pitched past unscathed. The week-kneed and  weak-minded youth was too vain to feel much ashamed. He was biding his time, he  could pick his night; one was too dark, another not dark enough; he had always  some excuse for himself when he regained his room, still unstained by crime;  and so the unhealthy excitement was deliciously maintained. To-night, as always  when he sallied forth, the deed should be done; he only wished there was a  shade less moon, and wondered whether he might not have done better to wait.  But, as usual, the die was cast. And indeed it was quite a new complication  that deterred this poor creature for the last time: he was feverishly expecting  the coach when a patter of hoofs smote his ear from the opposite quarter.</p>
  <p>This  was enough to stay an older and a bolder hand. Oswald tucked in his guns with  unrealized relief. It was his last instinct to wait and see whether the horseman  was worth attacking for his own sake; he had room for few ideas at the same  time; and his only new one was the sense of a new danger, which he prepared to  meet by pocketing his pistols as a child bolts stolen fruit. There was no  thinking before the act; but it was perhaps as characteristic of the naturally  honest man as of the coward.</p>
  <p>Stingaree  swept through the trees at a gallop, the milk-white mare flashing in the  moonlit patches. At the sight of her Oswald was convulsed with a premonition as  to who was coming; his heart palpitated as even his heart had never done  before; and yet he would have sat irresolute, inert, and let the man pass as he  always let the coach, had the decision been left to him. The real milk-white  mare affected the imitation in its turn as the coach-horses never had; and  Oswald swayed and swam upon a whinnying steed. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
  <p>"I  thought you were Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>The  anti-climax was as profound as the weakling's relief. Yet there was a strong  dash of indignation in his tone.</p>
  <p>"What  if I am?"</p>
  <p>"But  you're not. You're not half smart enough. You can't tell me anything about  Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>He  put his eye-glass up with an air.</p>
  <p>Stingaree  put up his.</p>
  <p>"You  young fool!" said he.</p>
  <p>The  thoroughbred mare, the eye-glass, a peeping pistol, were all superfluous evidence.  There was the far more unmistakable authority of voice and eye and bearing. Yet  the voice at least was somehow familiar to the ear of Oswald, who stuttered as  much when he was able.</p>
  <p>"I  must have heard it before, or have I dreamt it? I've thought a good deal about  you, you know!"</p>
  <p>To  do him justice, he was no longer very nervous, though still physically shaken.  On the other hand, he began already to feel the elation of his dreams.</p>
  <p>"I  do know. You've thought your soul into a pulp on the subject, and you must give  it up," said Stingaree, sternly.</p>
  <p>Oswald  sat aghast.</p>
  <p>"But  how on earth did you know?"</p>
  <p>"I've  come straight from your mother. You're breaking her heart."</p>
  <p>"But  how can <i>you</i> have come straight from <i>her</i>?"</p>
  <p>"I've  come down for another melodeon. I've got to have one, too."</p>
  <p>"Another  &mdash;"</p>
  <p>And  Oswald Melvin knew his drunken whim-driver for what he had really been.</p>
  <p>"The  yarn I told you about myself was true enough," continued Stingaree. "Only the  names were altered, as they say; it happened to the other fellow, not to me. I  made it happen. He is hardly likely to have lived to tell the tale."</p>
  <p>"Did  he really try to betray you after what you'd done for him?"</p>
  <p>"More  or less. He looked on me as fair game."</p>
  <p>"But  you had saved his life?"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  shrugged.</p>
  <p>"We  rode across him."</p>
  <p>"And  you think he perished of dust and thirst?"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  nodded. "In torment!"</p>
  <p>"Then  he got what he jolly well earned! Anything less would have been too good for  him!" cried Oswald, and with a boyish, uncompromising heat which spoke to some  human nature in him still.</p>
  <p>But  Stingaree frowned up the moonlit track. There was still no sign of the coach.  Yet time was short, and the morbid enthusiast was not to be disgusted; indeed,  he was all enthusiasm now, and a less unattractive lad than the bushranger had  hoped to find him. He looked the white screw and Oswald up and down as they sat  in their saddles in the moonshine: it seemed like sunlight on that beaming  fool.</p>
  <p>"And  you think of commencing bushranger, do you?"</p>
  <p>"Rather!"</p>
  <p>"It's  a hard life while it lasts, and a nasty death to top up with."</p>
  <p>"They  don't hang you for it."</p>
  <p>"They  might hang me for the man I put back in the vile dust from whence he sprung.  They'd hang you in six months. You've too many nerves. You'd pull the trigger  every time."</p>
  <p>"A  short life and a merry one!" cried the reckless Oswald. "I shouldn't care."</p>
  <p>"But  your mother would," retorted Stingaree, sharply. "Don't think about yourself so  much; think about her for a change."</p>
  <p>The  young man turned dusky in the moonlight; he was wounded where the Bishop had  wounded him, and Stingaree was quick to see it &mdash; as quick to turn the knife  round in the wound.</p>
  <p>"What  a bushranger!" he jeered. "Put your plucky little mother in a side-saddle and  she'd make two of you &mdash; ten of you &mdash; twenty of a puny, namby-pamby, conceited  young idiot like you! Upon my word, Melvin, if I had a mother like you I should  be ashamed of myself. I never had, I may tell you, or I shouldn't have come  down to a dog's life like this."</p>
  <p>The  bushranger paused to watch the effect of his insults. It was not quite what he  wanted. The youth would not hang his head. And, if he did not answer back, he  looked back doggedly enough; for he could be dogged, in a passive way; it was  his one hard quality, the knot in a character of green deal. Stingaree glanced  up the road once more, but only for an instant.</p>
  <p>"It  is a dog's life," he went on, "whether you believe it or not. But it takes a  bull-dog to live it, and don't you forget it. It's no life for a young poodle  like you! You can't stick up a better man than yourself, not more than once or  twice. It requires something more than a six-shooter, and a good deal more than  was put into you, my son! But you shall see for yourself; look over your  shoulder."</p>
  <p>Oswald  did so, and started in a fashion that set the bushranger nodding his scorn. It  was only a pair of lamps still close together in the distance up the road.</p>
  <p>"The  coach!" exclaimed the excited youth.</p>
  <p>"Exactly,"  said Stingaree, "and I'm going to stick it up."</p>
  <p>Excitement  grew to frenzy in a flash.</p>
  <p>"I'll  help you!"</p>
  <p>"You'll  do no such thing. But you shall see how it's done, and then ask yourself  candidly if it's nice work and if you're the man to do it. Ride a hundred yards  further in, tether your horse quickly in the thickest scrub you can find, then  run back and climb into the fork of this gum-tree. You'll have time; if you're  sharp I'll give you a leg up. But I sha'n't be surprised if I don't see you  again!"</p>
  <p>There  is no saying what Oswald might have done, but for these last words. Certain it  is that they set him galloping with an oath, and brought him back panting in  another minute. The coach-lamps were not much wider apart. Stingaree awaited  him, also on foot, and quicker than the telling Oswald was ensconced on high  where he could see through the meagre drooping leaves with very little danger  of being seen.</p>
  <p>"And  if you come down before I'm done and gone &mdash; if it's not to glory &mdash; I'll run  some lead through you! You'll be the first!"</p>
  <p>Oswald  perched reflecting on this final threat; and the scene soon enacted before his  eyes was viewed as usual through the aura of his own egoism. He longed all the  time to be taking part in it; he could see himself so distinctly at the work &mdash;  save for about a minute in the middle, when for once in his life he held his  breath and trembled for other skins.</p>
  <p>There  had been no unusual feature. The life-size coach-lamps had shown their  mountain-range of outside passengers against moonlit sky or trees. A cigar  paled and reddened between the teeth of one, plain wreaths of smoke floated from  his lips, with but an instant's break when Stingaree rode out and stopped the  coach. The three leaders reared; the two wheelers were pulled almost to their  haunches. The driver was docile in deed, though profane in word; and Stingaree  himself discovered a horrifying vocabulary out of keeping with his reputation.  In incredibly few minutes driver and passengers were formed in a line and  robbed in rotation, all but two ladies who were kept inside unmolested. A  flagrant Irishman declared it was the proudest day of his life, and Oswald's  heart went out to him, though it rather displeased him to find his own  sentiments shared by the vulgar. The man with the cigar kept it glowing all the  time. The mail-bags were not demanded on this occasion. Stingaree had no time  to waste on them. He was still collecting purse and watch, when Oswald's young  blood froze in the stiffening limbs he dared not move.</p>
  <p>One  of the ladies had got down from the coach on the off side, and behold! it was a  man wrapped in a rug, which dropped from him as he crept round behind the  horses. At their head stood the lily mare, as if doing her own nefarious part  by her own kind. In a twinkling the mad adventurer was on her back, and all  this time Oswald longed to jump down, or at least to shout a warning to his  hero, but, as usual, his desires were unproductive of word or deed. And then  Stingaree saw his man.</p>
  <p>He  did not fire; he did not shift sight or barrel for a moment from the docile  file before him. "Barmaid! Barmaid, my pet!" he cried, and hardly looked to see  what happened.</p>
  <p>But  Oswald watched the mare stop, prick her ears under the hammering of unspurred  heels, spin round, bucking as she spun, and toss her rider like a bull. There  in the moonlight he lay like lead, with leaden face upturned to the shuddering  youngster in the tree.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1701251h-images/page238.jpg" width="496" height="750"></p>
  <p>"One  of you a doctor?" asked Stingaree, checking a forward movement of the file.</p>
  <p>"I  am."</p>
  <p>The  cigar was paling between finger and thumb.</p>
  <p>"Then  come you here and have a look at him. The rest of you move at your peril!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  led the way, stepping backward, but not as far as the injured man, who sat up  ruefully as the bushranger sprang into the saddle.</p>
  <p>"Another  yard, and I'd have grabbed your ankles!" said the man on the ground.</p>
  <p>"You're  a stout fellow, but I know more about this game than you," the outlaw answered,  riding to his distance and reining up. "If I didn't you might have had me &mdash; but  you must think of something better for Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>He  galloped his mare into the bush and Oswald clung in lonely terror to his tree.  A snatch of conversation called him to attention. The plundered party were  clambering philosophically to their seats, while the driver blasphemed  delightedly over the integrity of his mails.</p>
  <p>"That  wasn't Stingaree," said one.</p>
  <p>"You  bet it was!"</p>
  <p>"How  much? He hardly ever works so far south."</p>
  <p>"And  he's nuts on mails."</p>
  <p>"But  if it wasn't Stingaree, who was it?"</p>
  <p>"It  was him all right. Look at the mare."</p>
  <p>"She  isn't the only white 'orse ever foaled," remarked the driver, sorting his  fistful of reins.</p>
  <p>"But  who else could it have been?"</p>
  <p>The  driver uttered an inspired imprecation.</p>
  <p>"I  can tell you. I chanst to live in this here township we're comin' to. On second  thoughts, I'll keep it to myself till we get there."</p>
  <p>And  he cracked his whip.</p>
  <p>Oswald  himself rode back to the township before the moon went down. He was very heavy  with his own reflections. How magnificent! It had all surpassed his most  extravagant imaginings &mdash; in audacity, in expedition, in simple mastery of the  mutable many by the dominant one. He forgave Stingaree his gibes and insults;  he could have forgiven a horse-whipping from that king of men. Stingaree had  been his imaginary god before; he was a realized ideal from this night forth,  and the reality outdid the dream.</p>
  <p>But  the fly of self must always poison this young man's ointment, and to-night  there was some excuse from his degenerate point of view. He must give it up.  Stingaree was right; it was only one man in thousands who could do unerringly  what he had done that night. Oswald Melvin was not that man. He saw it for  himself at last. But it was a bitter hour for him. Life in the music-shop would  fall very flat after this; he would be dishonored before his only friends, the  unworthy hobbledehoys who were to have joined his gang; he could not tell them  what had happened, not at least until he had invented some less inglorious part  for himself, and that was a difficulty in view of newspaper reports of the  sticking-up. He could scarcely tell them a true word of what had passed between  himself and Stingaree. If only he might yet grow more like the master! If only  he might still hope to follow so sublime a lead!</p>
  <p>Thus  aspiring, vainly as now he knew, Oswald Melvin rode slowly back into the  excited town, and past the lighted police-barracks, in the innocence of that  portion of his heart. But one had flown like the wind ahead of him, and two in  uniform, followed by that one, dashed out on Oswald and the old white screw.</p>
  <p>"Surrender!"  sang out one.</p>
  <p>"In  the Queen's name!" added the other.</p>
  <p>"Call  yourself Stingaree!" panted the runner.</p>
  <p>Our  egoist was quick enough to grasp their meaning, but quicker still to see and to  seize the chance of a crazy lifetime. Always acute where his own vanity was  touched, his promptitude was for once on a par with his perceptions.</p>
  <p>"Had  your eye on me long?" he inquired, delightfully, as he dismounted.</p>
  <p>"Long  enough," said one policeman. The other was busy plucking loaded revolvers from  the desperado's pockets. A crowd had formed.</p>
  <p>"If  you're looking for the loot," he went on, raising his voice for the benefit of  all, "you may look. <i>I</i> sha'n't tell you, and it'll take you all your  time!"</p>
  <p>But  a surprise was in store for prisoner and police alike. Every stolen watch and  all the missing money were discovered no later than next morning in the bush quite  close to the scene of the outrage. There had been no attempt to hide them; they  lay in a heap, dumped from the saddle, with no more depreciation than a broken  watch-glass. True to his new character, Oswald learned this development without  flinching. His ready comment was in next day's papers.</p>
  <p>"There  was nothing worth having," he had maintained, and did not see the wisdom of the  boast until a lawyer called and pointed out that it contained the nucleus of a  strong defence.</p>
  <p>"I'll  defend myself, thank you," said the inflated fool.</p>
  <p>"Then  you'll make a mess of it, and deserve all you get. And it would be a pity to  spoil such a good defence."</p>
  <p>"What  is the defence?"</p>
  <p>"You  did it for a joke, of course!"</p>
  <p>Oswald  smiled inscrutably, and dismissed his visitor with a lordly promise to consider  the proposition and that lawyer's claims upon the case. Never was such triumph  tasted in guilty immunity as was this innocent man's under cloud of guilt so  apparent as to impose on every mind. He had but carried out a notorious intention;  for his few friends were the first to betray their captain, albeit his bold  bearing and magnanimous smiles won an admiration which they had never before  vouchsafed him in their hearts. He was, indeed, a different man. He had lived  to see Stingaree in action, and now he modelled himself from the life. The only  doubt was as to whether at the last of that business he had actually avowed  himself Stingaree or not. There might have been trouble about the horse, but  fortunately for the enthusiastic prisoner the man who had been thrown was  allowed to proceed on a pressing journey to the Barcoo. There was a plethora of  evidence without his; besides, the hide-and-bone mare was called Barmaid, after  the original, and it was known that Oswald had tried to teach the old creature  tricks; above all, the prisoner had never pretended to deny his guilt. Still,  this matter of the horses gave him a certain sense of insecurity in his cosey  cell.</p>
  <p>He  had awakened to find himself not only deliciously notorious, but actually more  of a man than in his heart of hearts he had dared to hope. The tenacity and  consistency of his pose were alike remarkable. Even in the overweening cause of  egoism he had never shown so much character in his life. Yet he shuddered to  realize that, given the usual time for reflection before his great moment, that  moment might have proved as mean as many another when the spirit had been wine  and the flesh water. There was, in fine, but one feature of the affair which  even Oswald Melvin, drunk with notoriety and secretly sanguine of a nominal  punishment, could not contemplate with absolute satisfaction. But that feature  followed the others into the papers which kept him intoxicated. And a bundle of  these papers found their adventurous way to the latest fastness of Stingaree in  the mallee.</p>
  <p>The  real villain dropped his eye-glass, clapped it in again, and did his best to  crack it with his stare. Student of character as he was, he could not have  conceived such a development in such a character. He read on, more enlightened  than amused. "To think he had the pluck!" he murmured, as he dropped that <i>Australasian</i> and took up the next week's. He was filled with admiration, but soon a frown  and then an oath came to put an end to it. "The little beast," he cried, "he'll  kill that woman! He can't have kept it up." He sorted the papers for the latest  of all &mdash; a sinful publican saved them for him &mdash; and therein read that Oswald  Melvin had been committed for trial, and that his only concern was for the  condition of his mother, which was still unchanged, and had seemed latterly to  distress the prisoner very much.</p>
  <p>"I'll  distress him!" roared Stingaree to the mallee. "I'll distress him, if we change  places for it!"</p>
  <p>Riding  all night, and as much as he dared by day, it was some hundred hours before he  paid his third and last visit to the Melvins' music-shop. He rode boldly to the  door, but he rode a piebald mare not to be confused in the most suspicious mind  with the no more conspicuous Barmaid. It is true the brown parts smelt of  Condy's Fluid, and were at once strange and seemingly a little tender to the  touch. But Stingaree allowed no meddling with his mount; and only a very sinful  publican, very many leagues back, was in the secret.</p>
  <p>There  were no lighted windows behind the shop to-night. The whole place was in  darkness, and Stingaree knocked in vain. A neighbor appeared upon the next  veranda.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1701251h-images/page246.jpg" width="484" height="750"></p>
  <p>"Who  is it you want?" he asked.</p>
  <p>"Mrs.  Melvin."</p>
  <p>"It's  no use knocking for her."</p>
  <p>"Is  she dead?"</p>
  <p>"Not  that I know of; but she can't be long for this world."</p>
  <p>"Where  is she now?"</p>
  <p>"Bishop's  Lodge; they say Miss Methuen's with her day and night."</p>
  <p>For  it was in the days of the Bishop's daughter, who had a strong mind but no sense  of humor, and a heart only fickle in its own affairs. Miss Methuen made an  admirable, if a somewhat too assiduous and dictatorial, nurse. She had,  however, a fund of real sympathy with the afflicted, and Mrs. Melvin's only  serious complaint (which she intended to die without uttering) was that she was  never left alone with her grief by day or night. It was Miss Methuen who,  sitting with rather ostentatious patience in the dark, at the open window,  until her patient should fall or pretend to be asleep, saw a man ride a piebald  horse in at the gate, and then, half-way up the drive, suspiciously dismount  and lead his horse into a tempting shrubbery.</p>
  <p>Stingaree  did not often change his mind at the last moment, but he knew the man on whose  generosity he was about to throw himself, which was to know further that that  generosity would be curbed by judgment, and to reflect that he was least likely  to be deprived of a horse whose whereabouts was known only to himself. There  was but one lighted room when he eventually stole upon the house; it had a  veranda to itself; and in the bright frame of the French windows, which stood  open, sat the Bishop with his Bible on his knees.</p>
  <p>"Yes,  I know you," said he, putting his marker in the place as Stingaree entered,  boots in one hand and something else in the other. "I thought we should meet  again. Do you mind putting that thing back in your pocket?"</p>
  <p>"Will  you promise not to call a soul?"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  dear, yes."</p>
  <p>"You  weren't expecting me, were you?" cried Stingaree, suspiciously.</p>
  <p>"I've  been expecting you for months," returned the Bishop. "You knew my address, but  I hadn't yours. We were bound to meet again."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  smiled as he took his revolver by the barrel and carried it across the room to  Dr. Methuen.</p>
  <p>"What's  that for? I don't want it; put it in your own pocket. At least I can trust you  not to take my life in cold blood."</p>
  <p>The  Bishop seemed nettled and annoyed. Stingaree loved him.</p>
  <p>"I  don't come to take anything, much less life," he said. "I come to save it; if  it is not too late."</p>
  <p>"To  save life &mdash; here?"</p>
  <p>"In  your house."</p>
  <p>"But  whom do you know of my household?"</p>
  <p>"Mrs.  Melvin. I have had the honor of meeting her twice, though each time she was  unaware of the dishonor of meeting me. The last time I promised to try to save  her unhappy son from himself. I found him waiting to waylay the coach, told him  who I was, and had ten minutes to try to cure him in. He wouldn't listen to  reason; insult ran like water off his back. I did my best to show him what a  life it was he longed to lead, and how much more there was in it than a loaded  revolver. He wouldn't take my word for it, however, so I put him out of harm's  way, up in a tree; and when the coach came along I gave him as brutal an  exhibition of the art of bushranging as I could without spilling blood. I  promise you it was for no other reason. What did I want with watches? What were  a few pounds to me? I dropped the lot that the lad might know."</p>
  <p>The  Bishop started to his gaitered legs.</p>
  <p>"And  he's actually innocent all the time?"</p>
  <p>"Of  the deed, as the babe unborn."</p>
  <p>"Then  why in the wide world &mdash;"</p>
  <p>Dr.  Methuen stood beggared of further speech. His mind was too plain and sane for  immediate understanding of such a type as Oswald Melvin. But the bushranger hit  off that young man's character in half-a-dozen trenchant phrases.</p>
  <p>"He  must be let out, and it may save his mother's life; but if he were mine,"  exclaimed the Bishop, "I would rather he had done the other deed! But what  about you?" he added, suddenly, his eyes resting on his sardonic visitor, who  had disguised himself far less than his horse. "It will mean giving yourself up."</p>
  <p>"No.  You know me. You can spread what I've told you."</p>
  <p>The  Bishop shifted uneasily on his hearth-rug.</p>
  <p>"I  may not see my way to that," said he. "Besides, you must have run a lot of  risks to do this good action; how do you know you haven't been recognized  already? I should have known you anywhere."</p>
  <p>"But  you have undertaken not to raise an alarm, my lord."</p>
  <p>"I  shall not break my promise."</p>
  <p>There  was a grim regret in the Bishop's voice. Stingaree thought he understood it.</p>
  <p>"Thank  you," he said.</p>
  <p>"Don't  thank me, pray!" Dr. Methuen could be quite testy on occasion. "I have other  duties than to you, you know, and I only answer for my actions during the  actual period of our interview. There are many things I should like to say to  you, my brother," a gentler voice went on, "but this is hardly the time for me  to say them. But there is one question I should like to ask you for the peace  of both our souls, and for the maintenance of my own belief in human nature."  He threw up an episcopal hand dramatically. "If you earnestly and honestly  wished to save this poor lady's life, and there were no other way, would you  then be man enough to give yourself up &mdash; to give your liberty for her life?"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  took time to think. His eyes were brightly fixed upon the Bishop's. Yet they  saw a little bedroom just as plain, an English lady standing by the empty bed,  and at its foot a portrait of himself armed to the teeth.</p>
  <p>"For  hers?" said he. "Yes, like a shot!"</p>
  <p>"I'm  thankful to hear it," replied the Bishop, with most fervent relief. "I only  wish you could have the opportunity. But now you never will. My brother, if you  look round, you will see why!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  looked round without a word. In the Bishop's eyes at the last instant he had  learned what to expect. A firing-party of four stocking-soled constables were  drawn across the opened French windows, their levelled rifles poking through.</p>
  <p>The  bushranger looked over his shoulder with a bitter smile. "You've done me, after  all!" said he, and stretched out empty hands.</p>
  <p>"It  was done before I saw you," the Bishop made answer. "I had already sent for the  police."</p>
  <p>One  had entered excitedly by an inner door.</p>
  <p>"And  he didn't do you at all!" cried the voice of high hysteria. "It was I who saw  you &mdash; it was I who guessed who it was! Oh, father, why have you been talking so  long to such a dreadful man? I made sure he would shoot you, and you'd still be  shot if they had to shoot him! Move &mdash; move &mdash; move!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  looked at the strong-minded girl, shrill with her triumph, quite carried away  by her excitement, all undaunted by the prospect of bloodshed before her eyes.  And it was he who moved, with but a shrug of the shoulders, and gave himself up  without another sign.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  The Moth and the Star</b></h2>
  <p>Darlinghurst  Jail had never immured a more interesting prisoner than the back-block bandit  who was tried and convicted under the strange style and title which he had made  his own. Not even in prison was his real name ever known, and the wild  speculations of some imaginative officials were nothing else up to the end. There  was enough color in their wildness, however, to crown the convict with a  certain halo of romance, which his behavior in jail did nothing to dispel.  That, of course, was exemplary, since Stingaree had never been a fool; but it  was something more and rarer. Not content simply to follow the line of least  resistance, he exhibited from the first a spirit and a philosophy unique indeed  beneath the broad arrow. And so far from decreasing with the years of his  captivity, these attractive qualities won him friend after friend among the  officials, and privilege upon privilege at their hands, while amply justifying  the romantic interest in his case.</p>
  <p>At  last there came to Sydney a person more capable of an acute appreciation of the  heroic villain than his most ardent admirer on the spot. Lucius Brady was a  long-haired Irishman of letters, bard and bookworm, rebel and reviewer; in his  ample leisure he was also the most enthusiastic criminologist in London. And as  President of an exceedingly esoteric Society for the Cultivation of Criminals,  even from London did he come for a prearranged series of interviews with the  last and the most distinguished of all the bushrangers.</p>
  <p>It  was to Lucius Brady, his biographer to be, that Stingaree confided the data of  all the misdeeds recounted in these pages; but of his life during the quiet  intervals, of his relations with confederates, and his more honest dealings  with honest folk (of which many a pretty tale was rife), he was not to be  persuaded to speak without an irritating reserve.</p>
  <p>"Keep  to my points of contact with the world, about which something is known already,  and you shall have the whole truth of each matter," said the convict. "But I  don't intend to give away the altogether unknown, and I doubt if it would  interest you if I did. The most interesting thing to me has been the different  types with whom I have had what it pleases you to term professional relations,  and the very different ways in which they have taken me. You read character by  flashlight along the barrel of your revolver. What you should do is to hunt up  my various victims and get at their point of view; you really mustn't press me  to hark back to mine. As it is you bring a whiff of the outer world which makes  me bruise my wings against the bars."</p>
  <p>The  criminologist gloated over such speeches from such lips. It would have touched  another to note what an irresistible fascination the bars had for the wings,  despite all pain; but Lucius Brady's interest in Stingaree was exclusively  intellectual. His heart never ached for a roving spirit in confinement; it did  not occur to him to suppress a detail of his own days in Sydney, down to the  attractions of an Italian restaurant he had discovered near the jail, the  flavor of the Chianti and so forth. On the contrary, it was most interesting to  note the play of features in the tortured man, who after all brought his  torture on himself by asking so many questions. Soon, when his visitor left  him, the bondman could follow the free in all but the flesh, through every  corridor of the prison and every street outside, to the hotel where you read  the English papers on the veranda, or to the little restaurant where the  Chianti was corked with oil which the waiter removed with a wisp of tow.</p>
  <p>One  day, late in the afternoon, as Lucius Brady was beaming on him through his  spectacles, and indulging in an incisive criticism on the champagne at  Government House, Stingaree quietly garroted him. A gag was in all readiness,  likewise strips of coarse sheeting torn up for the purpose in the night. Black  in the face, but with breath still in his body, the criminologist was carefully  gagged and tied down to the bedstead, while his living image (at a casual  glance) strolled with bent head, black sombrero, spectacles and frock-coat,  first through the cold corridors and presently along the streets.</p>
  <p>The  heat of the pavement striking to his soles was the first of a hundred exquisite  sensations; but Stingaree did not permit himself to savor one of them. Indeed,  he had his work cut out to check the pace his heart dictated; and it was by  admirable exercise of the will that he wandered along, deep to all appearance  in a Camelot Classic which he had found in the criminologist's pocket; in  reality blinded by the glasses, but all the more vigilant out of the corners of  his eyes.</p>
  <p>A  suburb was the scene of these perambulations; had he but dared to lift his  face, Stingaree might have caught a glimpse of the bluest of blue water; and  his prison eyes hungered for the sight, but he would not raise his eyes so long  as footsteps sounded on the same pavement. By taking judicious turnings,  however, he drifted into a quiet road, with gray suburban bungalows on one side  and building lots on the other. No step approached. He could look up at last.  And the very bungalow that he was passing was shut up, yet furnished; the  people had merely gone away, servants and all; he saw it at a glance from the  newspapers plastering the windows which caught the sun. In an instant he was in  the garden, and in another he had forced a side gate leading by an alley to  backyard and kitchen door; but for many minutes he went no further than this  gate, behind which he cowered, prepared with excuses in case he had already  been observed.</p>
  <p>It  was in this interval that Stingaree recalled the season with a thrill; for it  was Christmas week, and without a doubt the house would be empty till the New  Year. Here was one port for the storm that must follow his escape. And a very  pleasant port he found it on entering, after due precautionary delay.</p>
  <p>Clearly  the abode of young married people, the bungalow was fitted and furnished with a  taste which appealed almost painfully to Stingaree; the drawing-room was draped  in sheets, but the walls carried a few good engravings, some of which he  remembered with a stab. It was the dressing-room, however, that he wanted, and  the dressing-room made him rub his hands. The dainty establishment had no more  luxurious corner, what with the fitted bath, circular shaving-glass, packed  trouser-press, a row of boots on trees, and a fine old wardrobe full of hanging  coats. Stingaree began by selecting his suit; and it may have been his vanity,  or a strange longing to look for once what he once had been, but he could not  resist the young man's excellent evening clothes.</p>
  <p>"This  fellow comes from Home," said he. "And they are spending their Christmas pretty  far back, or he would have taken these with him."</p>
  <p>He  had wallowed in the highly enamelled bath, and was looking for a towel when he  saw his head in the shaving-glass; he was dry enough before he could think of  anything else. There was a dilemma, obvious yet unforeseen. That shaven head!  Purple and fine linen could not disguise the convict's crop; a wig was the only  hope; but to wear a wig one must first try it on &mdash; and let the perruquier call  the police. The knot was Gordian. And yet, desperately as Stingaree sought  unravelment, he was at the same time subconsciously as deep in a study of a  face so unfamiliar that at first he had scarcely known it for his own. It was  far leaner than of old; it was no longer richly tanned; and the mouth called  louder than ever for a mustache. The hair, what there was of it, seemed  iron-gray. It had certainly receded at the temples. What a pity, while it was  about it &mdash;</p>
  <p>Stingaree  clapped his hands; his hunt for the razor was feverish, tremulous. Such a young  man must have many razors; he had, he had &mdash; here they were. Oh, young man  blessed among young men!</p>
  <p>It  was quite dark when a gentleman in evening clothes, light overcoat, and opera  hat, sallied forth into the quiet road. Quiet as it was, however, a whistle  blew as he trod the pavement, and his hour or two of liberty seemed at an end.  His long term in prison had mixed Stingaree's ideas of the old country and the  new; he had forgotten that it is the postmen who blow the whistles in  Australia. Yet this postman stopped him on the spot.</p>
  <p>"Beg  your pardon, sir, but if it's quite convenient may I ask you for the  Christmas-box you was kind enough to promise me?"</p>
  <p>"I  think you are mistaking me for someone else," said Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"Why,  so I am, sir! I thought you came out of Mr. Brinton's house."</p>
  <p>"Sorry  to disappoint you," said the convict. "If I only had change you should have  some of it, in spite of your mistake; but, unfortunately, I have none."</p>
  <p>He  had, however, a handsome pair of opera-glasses, which he converted into change  (on the gratuitous plea that he had forgotten his purse) at the first  pawnbroker's on the confines of the city. The pawnbroker talked Greek to him at  once.</p>
  <p>"It's  a pity you won't be able to see 'er, sir, as well as 'ear 'er," said he.</p>
  <p>"Perhaps  they have them on hire in the theatre," replied Stingaree at a venture. The  pawnbroker's face instantly advised him that his observation was wide of the  obscure mark.</p>
  <p>"The  theatre! You won't 'ear 'er at any theatre in Sydney, nor yet in the Southern  'Emisphere. Town 'Alls is the only lay for 'Ilda Bouverie out 'ere!"</p>
  <p>At  first the name conveyed nothing to Stingaree. Yet it was not wholly unfamiliar.</p>
  <p>"Of  course," said he. "The Town Hall I meant."</p>
  <p>The  pawnbroker leered as he put down a sovereign and a shilling.</p>
  <p>"What  a season she's 'aving, sir!"</p>
  <p>"Ah!  What a season!"</p>
  <p>And  Stingaree wagged his opera-hatted head.</p>
  <p>"'Undreds  of pounds' worth of flowers flung on to every platform, and not a dry eye in  the place!"</p>
  <p>"I  know," said the feeling Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"It's  wonderful to think of this 'ere Colony prodoocin' the world's best primer  donner!"</p>
  <p>"It  is, indeed."</p>
  <p>"When  you think of 'er start."</p>
  <p>"That's  true."</p>
  <p>The  pawnbroker leant across his counter and leered more than ever in his customer's  face.</p>
  <p>"They  say she ain't no better than she ought to be!"</p>
  <p>"Really?"</p>
  <p>"It's  right, too; but what can you expect of a primer donner whose fortune was made  by a blood-thirsty bushranger like that there Stingaree?"</p>
  <p>"You  little scurrilous wretch!" cried the bushranger, and flung out of the shop that  second.</p>
  <p>It  was a miracle. He remembered everything now. Then he had done the world a  service as well as the woman! He gave thanks for the guinea in his pocket, and  asked his way to the Town Hall. And as he marched down the middle of the  lighted streets the first flock of newsboys came flying in his face.</p>
  <p>"<i>Escape  of Stingaree! Escape of Stingaree! Cowardly Outrage on Famous Author! Escape of  Stingaree!!</i>"</p>
  <p>The  damp pink papers were in the hands of the overflow crowd outside the hall; his  own name was already in every mouth, continually coupled with that of the  world-renowned Hilda Bouverie. It did not deter the convict from elbowing his  way through the mass that gloated over his deed exactly as they would have  gloated over his destruction on the gallows. "I have my ticket; I have been  detained," he told the police; and at the last line of defence he whispered, "A  guinea for standing-room!" And the guinea got it.</p>
  <p>It  was the interval between parts one and two. He thought of that other interval,  when he had made such a different entry at the same juncture; the other  concert-room would have gone some fifty times into this. All at once fell a  hush, and then a rising thunder of applause, and some one requested Stingaree  to remove his hat; he did so, and a cold creeping of the shaven flesh reminded  him of his general position and of this particular peril. But no one took any  notice of him or of his head. And it was not Hilda Bouverie this time; it was a  pianiste in violent magenta and elaborate lace, whose performance also was loud  and embroidered. Followed a beautiful young barytone whom Miss Bouverie had  brought from London in her pocket for the tour. He sang three little songs very  charmingly indeed; but there was no encore. The gods were burning for their  own; perfunctory plaudits died to a dramatic pause.</p>
  <p>And  then, and then, amid deafening salvos a dazzling vision appeared upon the  platform, came forward with the carriage of a conscious queen, stood bowing and  beaming in the gloss and glitter of fabric and of gem that were yet less  radiant than herself. Stingaree stood inanimate between stamping feet and  clapping hands. No; he would never have connected this magnificent woman with  the simple bush girl in the unpretentious frocks that he recalled as clearly as  her former self. He had looked for less finery, less physical development,  less, indeed, of the grand operatic <i>tout-ensemble</i>. But acting ended with  her smile, and much of the old innocent simplicity came back as the lips parted  in song. And her song had not been spoilt by riches and adulation; her song had  not sacrificed sweetness to artifice; there was even more than the old magic in  her song.</p>
  <p class="note">"Is  this a dream?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then  waking would be pain!<br>
  Oh!  do not wake me;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let  me dream again."</p>
  <p>It  was no new number even then; even Stingaree had often heard it, and heard great  singers go the least degree flat upon the first "dream." He listened  critically. Hilda Bouverie was not one of the delinquents. Her intonation was  as perfect as that of the great violinists, her high notes had the rarefied  quality of the E string finely touched. It was a flawless, if a purely popular,  performance; and the musical heart of one listener in that crowded room was too  full for mere applause. But he waited with patient curiosity for the encore,  waited while courtesy after courtesy was given in vain. She had to yield; she  yielded with a winning grace. And the first bars of the new song set one full  heart beating, so that the earlier words were lost upon his brain.</p>
  <p class="note">"She  ran before me in the meads;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  down this world-worn track<br>
  She  leads me on; but while she leads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She  never gazes back.</p>
  <p class="note">"And  yet her voice is in my dreams,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  witch me more and more;<br>
  That  wooing voice! Ah me, it seems<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less  near me than of yore.</p>
  <p class="note">"Lightly  I sped when hope was high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  youth beguiled the chase;<br>
I  follow &mdash; follow still; but I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall  never see her Face."</p>
  <p>So  the song ended; and in the ultimate quiet the need of speech came over  Stingaree.</p>
  <p>" 'The  Unrealized Ideal,' " he informed a neighbor.</p>
  <p>"Rather!"  rejoined the man, treating the stale news as a mere remark. "We never let her  off without that."</p>
  <p>"I  suppose not," said Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"It's  the song the bushranger forced her to sing at the back-block concert, and it  made her fortune! Good old Stingaree! By the way, I heard somebody behind me  say he had escaped. That can't be true?"</p>
  <p>"The  newsboys were yelling it as I came along late."</p>
  <p>"Well,"  said Stingaree's neighbor, "if he has escaped, and I for one don't hope he  hasn't, this is where he ought to be. Just the sort of thing he'd do, too. Good  old sportsman, Stingaree!"</p>
  <p>It  was an embarrassing compliment, eye to eye and foot to foot, wedged in a crowd.  The bushranger did not fish for any more; neither did he wait to hear Hilda  Bouverie sing again, though this cost him much. But he had one more word with  his neighbor before he went.</p>
  <p>"You  don't happen to know where she's staying, I suppose? I've met her once or  twice, and I might call."</p>
  <p>The  other smiled as on some suicidal moth.</p>
  <p>"There's  only one place good enough for a star like her in Sydney."</p>
  <p>"And  that is?"</p>
  <p>"Government  House."</p>
  <p align="center"><b>II</b></p>
  <p>His  Excellency of the moment was a young nobleman of sporting proclivities and your  true sportsman's breadth of mind. He was immensely popular with all sects and  sections but the aggressively puritanical and the narrowly austere. He graced  the theatre with his constant presence, the Turf with his own horses. His  entertainment was lavish, and in quality far above the gubernatorial average.  Late life and soul of exalted circle, he was hide-bound by few of the  conventional trammels that distinguished the older type of peer to which the  Colonies had been accustomed. It was the obvious course for such a Governor and  his kindred lady to insist upon making the great Miss Bouverie their guest for  the period of her professional sojourn in the capital; and a semi-Bohemian  supper at the Government House was but a characteristic <i>finale</i> to her  first great concert.</p>
  <p>The <i>prima donna</i> sat on the Governor's right, and at the proper point his  Excellency sang her praises in a charmingly informal speech, which delighted  and amused the press men, actors and actresses whom he had collected for the  occasion. Only the guest of honor looked a little weary and condescending; she  had a sufficient experience of such entertainments in London, where the actors  were all London actors, the authors and journalists men whose names one knew.  Mere peers were no great treat either; in a word, Hilda Bouverie was not a  little spoilt. She had lost the girl's glad outlook on the world, which some  women keep until old age. There were stories about her which would have  accounted for a deeper deterioration. Yet she was the Governor's guest, and her  behavior not unworthy of the honor. On him at least she smiled, and her real  smile, less expansive than the platform counterfeit, had still its genuine  sweetness, its winning flashes; and, at its worst, it was more sad than bitter.</p>
  <p>To-night  the woman was an exhausted artist &mdash; unnerved, unstrung, unfitted for the world,  yet only showing it in a languid appreciation which her host and hostess were  the first to understand. Indeed, it was the great lady who carried her off,  bowing with her platform bow, and smiling that smile, before the banquet was at  an end.</p>
  <p>A  charming suite of rooms had been placed at the disposal of the <i>prima donna</i>;  the boudoir was like a hot-house with the floral offerings of the evening,  already tastefully arranged by madame's own Swiss maid. But the weary lady  walked straight through to her bedroom, and sank with a sigh into the arm-chair  before the glass.</p>
  <p>"Who  brought this?" she asked, peevishly picking a twisted note from amid the golden  furniture of her toilet-table.</p>
  <p>"I  never saw it until this minute, madame!" the Swiss maid answered, in dismay.  "It was not there ten minutes ago, I am sure, madame!"</p>
  <p>"Where  have you been since?"</p>
  <p>"Down  to the servants' hall, for one minute, madame."</p>
  <p>Miss  Bouverie read the note, and was an animated being in three seconds. She looked  in the glass, the flush became her, and even as she looked all horror died in  her dark-blue eyes. Instead there came a glitter that warned the maid.</p>
  <p>"I  am tired of you, Lea," cried madame. "You let people bring notes into my room,  and you say you were only out of it a minute. Be good enough to leave me for  the night. I can look after myself, for once!"</p>
  <p>The  maid protested, wept, but was expelled, and a key turned between them; then  Hilda Bouverie read her note again:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">"Escaped  this afternoon. Came to your concert. Hiding in boudoir.  Give me five minutes, or raise alarm, which you please.  &mdash; STINGAREE."</p>
  <p>So  ran his words in pencil on her own paper, and they were true; she had heard at  supper of the escape. Once more she looked in the glass. And to her own eyes in  these minutes she looked years younger &mdash; there was a new sensation left in  life!</p>
  <p>A  touch to her hair, a glance in the pier-glass, and all for a notorious convict  broken prison! So into the boudoir with her grandest air; but again she locked  the door behind her, and, sweeping round, beheld a bald man bowing to her in  immaculate evening clothes.</p>
  <p>"Are  you the writer of a note found on my dressing-table?" she demanded, every  syllable off the ice.</p>
  <p>"I  am."</p>
  <p>"Then  who are you, besides being an impudent forger?"</p>
  <p>"You  name the one crime I never committed," said he. "I am Stingaree."</p>
  <p>And  they gazed into each other's eyes; but not yet were hers to be believed.</p>
  <p>"He  only escaped this afternoon!"</p>
  <p>"I  am he."</p>
  <p>"With  a bald head?"</p>
  <p>"Thanks  to a razor."</p>
  <p>"And  in those clothes?"</p>
  <p>"I  found them where I found the razor. Look; they don't fit me as well as they  might."</p>
  <p>And  he drew nearer, flinging out an abbreviated sleeve; but she looked all the  harder in his face.</p>
  <p>"Yes.  I begin to remember your face; but it has changed."</p>
  <p>"It  has gazed on prison walls for many years."</p>
  <p>"I  heard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was grieved .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it was bound to come."</p>
  <p>"It  may come again. I care very little, after this!"</p>
  <p>And  his dark eyes shone, his deep voice vibrated; then he glanced over a shrugged  shoulder toward the outer door, and Hilda darted as if to turn that key too,  but there was none to turn.</p>
  <p>"It  ought to happen at once," she said, "and through me."</p>
  <p>"But  it will not."</p>
  <p>His  assurance annoyed her; she preferred his homage.</p>
  <p>"I  know what you mean," she cried. "You did me a service years ago. I am not to  forget it!"</p>
  <p>"It  is not I who have kept it before your mind."</p>
  <p>"Perhaps  not; but that's why you come to me to-night."</p>
  <p>Stingaree  looked upon the spirited, spoilt beauty in her satin and diamonds and pearls;  villain as he was, he held himself at her mercy, but he was not going to kneel  to her for that. He saw a woman who had heard the truth from very few men, a  nature grown in mastery as his own had inevitably shrunk: it was worth being at  large to pit the old Adam still remaining to him against the old Eve in this  petted darling of the world. But false protestations were no counters in his  game.</p>
  <p>"Miss  Bouverie," said Stingaree, "you may well suppose that I have borne you in mind  all these years. As a matter of honest fact, when I first heard your name this  evening, I was slow to connect it with any human being. You look angry. I  intend no insult. If you have not forgotten the life I was leading before, you  would very readily understand that I have never heard your name from those days  to this. That is my misfortune, if also my own fault. It should suffice that,  when I did remember, I came at my peril to hear you sing, and that before I  dreamt of coming an inch further. But I heard them say, both in the hall and  outside, that you owed your start to me; now one thinks of it, it must have been  a rather striking advertisement; and I reflected that not another soul in  Sydney can possibly owe me anything at all. So I came straight to you, without  thinking twice about it. Criminal as I have been, and am, my one thought was  and is that I deserve some little consideration at your hands."</p>
  <p>"You  mean money?"</p>
  <p>"I  have not a penny. It would make all the difference to me. And I give you my  word, if that is any satisfaction to you, I would be an honest man from this  time forth!"</p>
  <p>"You  actually ask me to assist a criminal and escaped convict &mdash; me, Hilda Bouverie,  at my own absolute risk!"</p>
  <p>"I  took a risk for you nine years ago, Miss Bouverie; it was all I did take," said  Stingaree, "at the concert that made your name."</p>
  <p>"And  you rub it in," she told him. "You rub it in!"</p>
  <p>"I  am running for my life!" he exclaimed, in answer. "It wouldn't have been  necessary &mdash; that would have been enough for the Miss Bouverie I knew then. But  you are different; you are another being, you are a woman of the world; your  heart, your heart is dead and gone!"</p>
  <p>He  cut her to it, none the less; he could not have inflicted a deeper wound. The  blood leapt to her face and neck; she cried out at the insult, the indignity,  the outrage of it all; and crying she darted to the door.</p>
  <p>It  was locked.</p>
  <p>She  turned on Stingaree.</p>
  <p>"You  dared to lock the door &mdash; you dared! Give me the key this instant."</p>
  <p>"I  refuse."</p>
  <p>"Very  well! You have heard my voice; you shall hear it again!"</p>
  <p>Her  pale lips made the perfect round, her grand teeth gleamed in the electric  light.</p>
  <p>He  arrested her, not with violence, but a shrug.</p>
  <p>"I  shall jump out of the window and break my neck. They don't take me twice &mdash;  alive."</p>
  <p>She  glared at him in anger and contempt. He meant it. Then let him do it. Her eyes  told him all that; but as they flashed, stabbing him, their expression altered,  and in a trice her ear was to the keyhole.</p>
  <p>"Something  has happened," she whispered, turning a scared face up to him. "I hear your  name. They have traced you here. They are coming! Oh! what are we to do?"</p>
  <p>He  strode over to the door.</p>
  <p>"If  you fear a scandal I can give myself up this moment and explain all."</p>
  <p>He  spoke eagerly. The thought was sudden. She rose up, looking in his eyes.</p>
  <p>"No,  you shall not," she said. Her hand flew out behind her, and in two seconds the  brilliant room had click-clicked into a velvet darkness.</p>
  <p>"Stand  like a mouse," she whispered, and he heard her reach the inner door, where she  stood like another.</p>
  <p>Steps  and voices came along the landing at a quick crescendo.</p>
  <p>"Miss  Bouverie! Miss Bouverie! Miss Bouverie!"</p>
  <p>It  was his Excellency's own gay voice. And it continued until with much noise Miss  Bouverie flung her bedroom door wide open, put on the light within, ran across  the boudoir, put on the boudoir light, and stooped to parley through the  keyhole.</p>
  <p>"The  bushranger Stingaree has been traced to Government House."</p>
  <p>"Good  heavens!"</p>
  <p>"One  of your windows was seen open."</p>
  <p>"He  had not come in through it."</p>
  <p>"Then  you were heard raising your voice."</p>
  <p>"That  was to my maid. This is all through her. I don't know how to tell you, but she  leaves me in the morning. Yes, yes, there was a man, but it was not Stingaree.  I saw him myself through coming up early, but I let him go as he had come, to  save a fuss."</p>
  <p>"Through  the window?"</p>
  <p>"I  am so ashamed!"</p>
  <p>"Not  a bit, Miss Bouverie. I am ashamed of bothering you. Confound the police!"</p>
  <p>When  the voices and steps had died away, Hilda Bouverie turned to Stingaree, her  whole face shining, her deep blue eyes alight.</p>
  <p>"There!"  said she. "Could you have done that better yourself?"</p>
  <p>"Not  half so well."</p>
  <p>"And  you thought I could forget!"</p>
  <p>"I  thought nothing. I only came to you in my scrape."</p>
  <p>After  years of imprisonment he could speak of this life-and-death hazard as a scrape!  She looked at him with admiring eyes; her personal triumph had put an end to  her indignation.</p>
  <p>"My  poor Lea! I wonder how much she has heard? I shall have to tell her nearly all;  she can wait for me at Melbourne or Adelaide, and I can pick her up on my  voyage home. It will be no joke without her until then. I give her up for your  sake!"</p>
  <p>Stingaree  hung his head. He was a changed man.</p>
  <p>"And  I," he said grimly &mdash; not pathetically &mdash;"and I am a convict who escaped by  violence this afternoon."</p>
  <p>Hilda  smiled.</p>
  <p>"I  met Mr. Brady the other day," she said, "and I heard of him to-night. He is not  going to die!"</p>
  <p>He  stared at her unscrupulous radiance.</p>
  <p>"Do  you wonder at me?" she said. "Did you never hear that musical people had no  morals?"</p>
  <p>And  her smile bewitched him more and more.</p>
  <p>"It  explains us both!" declared Miss Bouverie. "But do you know what I have kept  all these years?" she went on. "Do you know what has been my mascot, what I  have had about me whenever I have sung in public, since and including that time  at Yallarook? Can't you guess?"</p>
  <p>He  could not. She turned her back, he heard some gussets give, and the next moment  she was holding a strange trophy in both hands.</p>
  <p>It  was a tiny silken bandolier, containing six revolver cartridges, with bullet  and cap intact.</p>
  <p>"Can't  you guess now?" she gloried.</p>
  <p>"No.  I never missed them; they are not like any I ever had."</p>
  <p>"Don't  you remember the man who chased you out and misfired at you six times? He was  the overseer on the station; his name may come back to me, but his face I shall  never forget. He had a revolver in his pocket, but he dared not lower a hand. I  took it out of his pocket and was to hand it up to him when I got the chance.  Until then I was to keep it under my shawl. That was when I managed to unload  every chamber. These are the cartridges I took out, and they have been my  mascot ever since."</p>
  <p>She  looked years younger than she had seemed even singing in the Town Hall; but the  lines deepened on the bushranger's face, and he stepped back from her a pace.</p>
  <p>"So  you saved my life," he said. "You had saved my life all the time. And yet I  came to ask you to do as much for me as I had done for you!"</p>
  <p>He  turned away; his hands were clenched behind his back.</p>
  <p>"I  will do more," she cried, "if more could be done by one person for another.  Here are jewels." She stripped her neck of its rope of pearls. "And here are  notes." She dived into a bureau and thrust a handful upon him. "With these  alone you should be able to get to England or America; and if you want more  when you get there, write to Hilda Bouverie! As long as she has any, there will  be some for you!"</p>
  <p>Tears  filled her eyes. The simplicity of her girlhood had come back to the seasoned  woman of the world, at once spoiled and satiated with success. This was the  other side of the artistic temperament which had enslaved her soul. She would  swing from one extreme of wounded and vindictive vanity to this length of  lawless nobility; now she could think of none but self, and now not of herself  at all. Stingaree glanced toward the window.</p>
  <p>"I  can't go yet, I'm afraid."</p>
  <p>"You  sha'n't! Why should you?"</p>
  <p>"But  I still fear they may not be satisfied downstairs. I am ashamed to ask it &mdash; but  will you do one little thing more for me?"</p>
  <p>"Name  it!"</p>
  <p>"It  is only to make assurance doubly sure. Go downstairs and let them see you; tell  them more details, if you like. Go down as you are, and say that without your  maid you could not find anything else to put on. I promise not to vanish with  everything in your absence."</p>
  <p>"You  do promise?"</p>
  <p>"On  my &mdash; liberty!"</p>
  <p>She  looked in his face with a very wistful sweetness.</p>
  <p>"If  they were to find me out," she said, "I wonder how many years they would give <i>me</i>?  I neither know nor care; it would be worth a few. I thought I had lived since I  saw you last .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but this is the best fun I have ever had  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. since Yallarook!"</p>
  <p>She  stood for a moment before opening the door that he unlocked for her, stood  before him in all her flushed and brilliant radiance, and blew a kiss to him  before she went.</p>
  <p>The  Governor was easily found. He was grieved at her troubling to descend at such  an hour, and did not detain her five minutes in all. He thought she was in a  fever, but that the fever became her beyond belief. Reassured on every point,  Miss Bouverie was back in her room but a very few minutes after she had left  it.</p>
  <p>It  was empty. She searched all over, first behind the curtains, then between the  pedestals of the bureau, but Stingaree was nowhere in the room, and the bedroom  door was still locked. It was a second look behind the curtains that revealed  an open window and the scratch of a boot upon the white enamel. It was no breakneck  drop into the shrubs.</p>
  <p>So  he had gone without a word, but also without breaking his word; for, with wet  eyes and a white face, between anger and admiration, Hilda Bouverie had already  discovered her bundle of notes and her rope of pearls.</p>
  <p>There  are no more tales of Stingaree; tongue never answered to the name again, nor  was face ever recognized as his. He may have died that night; it is not very  likely, since the young married man in the well-appointed bungalow, which had  been broken into earlier in the day, missed a suit of clothes indeed, but not  his evening clothes, which were found hung up neatly where he had left them;  and it is regrettable to add that his opera-glasses were not the only article  of a marketable character which could never be found on his return. There is  none the less reason to believe that this was the last professional incident in  one of the most incredible criminal careers of which there is any record in  Australia. Whether he be dead or alive, back in the old country or still in the  new, or, what is less likely, in prison under some other name, the gratifying  fact remains that neither in Australia nor elsewhere has there been a second  series of crimes bearing the stamp of Stingaree.</p>
