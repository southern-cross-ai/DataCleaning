<h2>The Dead Hand<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
L. T. Meade and Robert Eustace</h2>

<h3>First published in Pearson's Magazine, February 1902</h3>

<h3>Being the First of the Experiences of the Oracle of Maddox
Street; Related by Herself.</h3>

<hr>

<p>MY name is Diana Marburg. I am a palmist by profession. Occult
phenomena, spiritualism, clairvoyance, and many other strange
mysteries of the unseen world, have, from my earliest years,
excited my keen interest.</p>

<p>Being blessed with abundant means, I attended in my youth many
foreign schools of thought. I was a pupil of Lewis, Darling, Braid
and others. I studied Reichenbach and Mesmer, and, finally, started
my career as a thought reader and palmist in Maddox Street.</p>

<p>Now I live with a brother, five years my senior. My brother
Rupert is an athletic Englishman, and also a barrister, with a
rapidly growing practice. He loves and pities me--he casts over me
the respectability of his presence, and wonders at what he calls my
lapses from sanity. He is patient, however, and when he saw that in
spite of all expostulation I meant to go my own way, he ceased to
try to persuade me against my inclinations.</p>

<p>Gradually the success of my reading of the lines of the human
hand brought me fame--my prophecies turned out correct, my
intuition led me to right conclusions, and I was sought after very
largely by that fashionable world which always follows anything
new. I became a favourite in society, and was accounted both
curious and bizarre.</p>

<p>On a certain evening in late July, I attended Lady Fortescue's
reception in Curzon Street. I was ushered into a small ante-room
which was furnished with the view of adding to the weird effect of
my own appearance and words. I wore an Oriental costume, rich in
colour and bespangled with sparkling gems. On my head I had twisted
a Spanish scarf, my arms were bare to the elbows, and my dress open
at the throat. Being tall, dark, and, I believe, graceful, my
quaint dress suited me well.</p>

<p>Lady Fortescue saw me for a moment on my arrival, and inquired
if I had everything I was likely to want. As she stood by the door
she turned.</p>

<p>"I expect, Miss Marburg, that you will have a few strange
clients to-night. My guests come from a varied and ever widening
circle, and to-night all sorts and conditions of men will be
present at my reception."</p>

<p>She left me, and soon afterwards those who wished to inquire of
Fate appeared before me one by one.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the evening a tall, dark man was ushered
into my presence. The room was shadowy, and I do not think he could
see me at once, although I observed him quite distinctly. To the
ordinary observer he doubtless appeared as a well set up man of the
world, but to me he wore quite a different appearance. I read fear
in his eyes, and irresolution, and at the same time cruelty round
his lips. He glanced at me as if he meant to defy any message I
might have for him, and yet at the same time was obliged to yield
to an overpowering curiosity. I asked him his name, which he gave
me at once.</p>

<p>"Philip Harman," he said; "have you ever heard of me
before?"</p>

<p>"Never," I answered.</p>

<p>"I have come here because you are the fashion, Miss Marburg, and
because many of Lady Fortescue's guests are flocking to this room
to learn something of their future. Of course you cannot expect me
to believe in your strange art, nevertheless, I shall be glad if
you will look at my hand and tell me what you see there."</p>

<p>As he spoke he held out his hand. I noticed that it trembled.
Before touching it I looked full at him.</p>

<p>"If you have no faith in me, why do you trouble to come here?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Curiosity brings me to you," he answered. "Will you grant my
request or not?"</p>

<p>"I will look at your hand first if I may." I took it in mine. It
was a long, thin hand, with a certain hardness about it. I turned
the palm upward and examined it through a powerful lens. As I did
so I felt my heart beat wildly and something of the fear in Philip
Harman's eyes was communicated to me. I dropped the hand,
shuddering inwardly as I did so.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked in astonishment, "what is the matter, what is
my fate? Tell me at once. Why do you hesitate?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not tell you, Mr. Harman. You don't believe in
me, go away and forget all about me."</p>

<p>"I cannot do that now. Your look says that you have seen
something which you are afraid to speak about. Is that so?"</p>

<p>I nodded my head. I placed my hand on the little round table,
which contained a shaded lamp, to steady myself.</p>

<p>"Come," he said rudely, "out with this horror--I am quite
prepared."</p>

<p>"I have no good news for you," I answered. "I saw something very
terrible in your hand."</p>

<p>"Speak."</p>

<p>"You are a ruined man," I said, taking his hand again in mine,
and examining it carefully. "Yes, the marks are unmistakable. You
will perpetrate a crime which will be discovered. You are about to
commit a murder, and will suffer a shameful death on the
scaffold."</p>

<p>He snatched his hand away with a violent movement and started
back. His whole face was quivering with passion.</p>

<p>"How dare you say such infamous things!" he cried. "You go very
far in your efforts to amuse, Miss Marburg."</p>

<p>"You asked me to tell you," was my reply.</p>

<p>He gave a harsh laugh, bowed low and went out of the room. I
noticed his face as he did so; it was white as death.</p>

<p>I rang my little hand-bell to summon the next guest, and a tall
and very beautiful woman between forty and fifty years of age
entered. Her dress was ablaze with diamonds, and she wore a diamond
star of peculiar brilliancy just above her forehead. Her hair white
as snow, and the glistening diamond star in the midst of the white
hair, gave to her whole appearance a curious effect.</p>

<p>"My name is Mrs. Kenyon," she said; "you have just interviewed
my nephew. Philip Harman. But what is the matter, my dear," she
said suddenly, "you look ill."</p>

<p>"I have had a shock," was my vague reply, then I pulled myself
together.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me my future."</p>

<p>"Will you show me your hand?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenyon held it out, I took it in mine. The moment I glanced
at it a feeling of relief passed over me. It was full of good
qualities--the Mount of Jupiter well developed, the heart-line
clear and unchained, a deep, long life-line, and a fate-line
ascending clear upon the Mount of Saturn. I began to speak easily
and rapidly, and with that fluency which often made me feel that my
words were prompted by an unseen presence.</p>

<p>"What you tell me sounds very pleasant," said Mrs. Kenyon, "and
I only hope my character is as good as you paint it. I fear it is
not so, however; your words are too flattering, and you think too
well of me. But you have not yet touched upon the most important
point of all--the future. What is in store for me?"</p>

<p>I looked again very earnestly at the hand. My heart sank a
trifle as I did so.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I said, "I have to tell you bad news--I did not
notice this at first but I see it plainly now. You are about to
undergo a severe shock, a very great grief."</p>

<p>"Strange," answered Mrs. Kenyon. She paused for a moment, then
she said suddenly: "You gave my nephew a bad report, did you
not?"</p>

<p>I was silent. It was one of my invariable rules never to speak
of one client to another.</p>

<p>"You need not speak," she continued, "I saw it in his face."</p>

<p>"I hope he will take the warning," I could not help murmuring
faintly. Mrs. Kenyon overheard the words.</p>

<p>"And now you tell me that I am to undergo severe trouble. Will
it come soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was my answer. "You will need all your strength to
withstand it," and then, as if prompted by some strange impulse, I
added, "I cannot tell you what that trouble may be, but I like you.
If in the time of your trouble I can help you I will gladly do
so."</p>

<p>"Thank you," answered Mrs. Kenyon, "you are kind. I do not
profess to believe in you; that you should be able to foretell the
future is, of course, impossible, but I also like you. I hope some
day we may meet again." She held out her hand; I clasped it. A
moment later she had passed outside the thick curtain which shut
away the ante-room from the gay throng in the drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>I went home late that night. Rupert was in and waiting for
me.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter, Diana?" he said the moment I appeared.
"You look shockingly ill; this terrible life will kill you."</p>

<p>"I have seen strange things to-night," was my answer. I flung
myself on the sofa, and for just a moment covered my tired eyes
with my hand.</p>

<p>"Have some supper," said Rupert gently. He led me to the table,
and helped me to wine and food.</p>

<p>"I have had a tiring and exciting evening at Lady Fortescue's,"
I said. "I shall be better when I have eaten. But where have you
been this evening?"</p>

<p>"At the Appollo--there was plenty of gossip circulating
there--two society scandals, and Philip Harman's crash. That is a
big affair and likely to keep things pretty lively. But, my dear
Di, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>I had half risen from my seat; I was gazing at my brother with
fear in my eyes, my heart once again beat wildly.</p>

<p>"Did you say Philip Harman?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, why? Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Tell me about him at once, Rupert, I must know. What do you
mean by his crash?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he is one of the plungers, you know. He has run through the
Harman property and cannot touch the Kenyon."</p>

<p>"The Kenyon!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes. His uncle, Walter Kenyon, was a very rich man, and has
left all his estates to his young grandson, a lad of about
thirteen. That boy stands between Harman and a quarter of a
million. But why do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Only that I saw Philip Harman to-night," was my answer.</p>

<p>"You did? That is curious. He asked you to prophesy with regard
to his fate?"</p>

<p>"He did. Rupert."</p>

<p>"And you told him?"</p>

<p>"What I cannot tell you. You know I never divulge what I see in
my clients' hands."</p>

<p>"Of course you cannot tell me, but it is easy to guess that you
gave him bad news. They say he wants to marry the heiress and
beauty of the season, Lady Maud Greville. If he succeeds in this he
will be on his feet once more, but I doubt if she will have
anything to say to him. He is an attractive man in some ways and
good-looking, but the Countess of Cheddsleigh keeps a sharp look
out on the future of her only daughter."</p>

<p>"Philip Harman must on no account marry an innocent girl," was
my next impulsive remark. "Rupert, your news troubles me very much,
it confirms--" I could not finish the sentence. I was overcome by
what Rupert chose to consider intense nervousness.</p>

<p>"You must have your quinine and go to bed," he said; "come, I
insist, I won't listen to another word."</p>

<p>A moment later I had left him, but try hard as I would I could
not sleep that night. I felt that I myself was on the brink of a
great catastrophe, that I personally, was mixed up in this affair.
In all my experience I had never seen a hand like Philip Harman's
before. There was no redeeming trait in it. The lines which denoted
crime and disaster were too indelibly marked to be soon forgotten.
When at last I did drop asleep that hand accompanied me into the
world of dreams.</p>

<p>The London season came to an end. I heard nothing more about
Philip Harman and his affairs, and in the excitement and interest
of leaving town, was beginning more or less to forget him, when on
the 25th of July, nearly a month after Lady Fortescue's party, a
servant entered my consulting-room with a card. The man told me
that a lady was waiting to see me, she begged for an interview at
once on most urgent business. I glanced at the card. It bore the
name of Mrs. Kenyon.</p>

<p>The moment I saw it that nervousness which had troubled me on
the night when I saw Philip Harman and read his future in the
ghastly lines of his hand returned. I could not speak at all for a
moment; then I said, turning to the man who stood motionless
waiting for my answer:</p>

<p>"Show the lady up immediately."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenyon entered. She came hurriedly forward. When last I saw
her she was a beautiful woman with great dignity of bearing and a
kindly, sunshiny face. Now as she came into the room she was so
changed that I should scarcely have known her. Her dress bore marks
of disorder and hasty arrangement, her eyes were red with
weeping.</p>

<p>"Pardon my coming so early, Miss Marburg," she said at once;
then, without waiting for me to speak, she dropped inlo a
chair.</p>

<p>"I am overcome," she gasped, "but you promised, if necessary, to
help me. Do you remember my showing you my hand at Lady Fortescue's
party?"</p>

<p>"I remember you perfectly, Mrs. Kenyon. What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>"You told me then that something terrible was about to happen. I
did not believe it. I visited you out of curiosity and had no faith
in you, but your predictions have come true--horribly true. I have
come to you now for the help which you promised to give me if I
needed it, for I believe it lies in your power to tell me something
I wish to discover."</p>

<p>"I remember everything," I replied gravely; "what is it you wish
me to do?"</p>

<p>"I want you to read a hand for me and to tell me what you see in
it."</p>

<p>"Certainly, but will you make an appointment?"</p>

<p>"Can you come with me immediately to Godalming? My nephew Philip
Harman has a place there."</p>

<p>"Philip Harman!" I muttered.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, scarcely noticing my words, "my only son
and I have been staying with him. I want to take you there; can you
come immediately?"</p>

<p>"You have not mentioned the name of the person whose hand you
want me to read?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not do so--not yet, I mean."</p>

<p>"But can you not bring him or her here? I am very busy just
now."</p>

<p>"That is impossible," replied Mrs. Kenyon. "I am afraid I must
ask you to postpone all your other engagements, this thing is most
imperative. I cannot bring the person whose hand I want you to read
here, nor can there be any delay. You must see him if possible
to-day. I implore you to come. I will give you any fee you like to
demand."</p>

<p>"It is not a question of money," I replied, "I am interested in
you. I will do what you require." I rose as I spoke. "By the way,"
I added, "I presume that the person whose hand you wish me to see
has no objection to my doing so, otherwise my journey may be thrown
away."</p>

<p>"There is no question about that," replied Mrs. Kenyon, "I thank
you more than I can say for agreeing to come."</p>

<p>A few moments later we were on our way to the railway station.
We caught our train, and between twelve and one o'clock arrived at
Godalming. A carriage was waiting for us at the station, we drove
for nearly two miles and presently found ourselves in a place with
large shady grounds. We drew up beside a heavy portico, a man
servant came gravely forward to help us to alight and we entered a
large hall.</p>

<p>I noticed a curious hush about the place, and I observed that
the man who admitted us ilid not speak, but glanced inquiringly at
Mrs. Kenyon, as if for directions.</p>

<p>"Show Miss Marburg into the library," was her order. "I will be
back again in a moment or two," she added, glancing at me.</p>

<p>I was ushered into a well-furnished library; there was a
writing-table at one end of it on which papers of different sorts
were scattered. I went forward mechanically and took up an
envelope. It was addressed to Philip Harman, Esq., The Priory,
Godalming. I dropped it as though I could not bear to touch it.
Once again that queer nervousness seized me, and I was obliged to
sit down weak and trembling. The next moment the room door was
opened.</p>

<p>"Will you please come now, Miss Marburg?" said Mrs. Kenyon. "I
will not keep you long."</p>

<p>We went upstairs together, and paused before a door on the first
landing.</p>

<p>"We must enter softly," said the lady turning to me. There was
something in her words and the look on her face which seemed to
prepare me, but for what I could not tell. We found ourselves in a
large room luxuriously furnished--the window blinds were all down,
but the windows themselves were open and the blinds were gently
moving to and fro in the soft summer air. In the centre of the room
and drawn quite away from the wall was a small iron bedstead. I
glanced towards it and a sudden irrepressible cry burst from my
lips. On the bed lay a figure covered with a sheet beneath which
its outline was indistinctly defined.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by bringing me here?" I said, turning to the
elder woman and grasping her by the arm.</p>

<p>"You must not be frightened," she said gently, "come up to the
bed. Hush, try to restrain yourself. Think of my most terrible
grief; this is the hand I want you to read." As she spoke she drew
aside the sheet and I found myself gazing down at the beautiful
dead face of a child, a boy of about thirteen years of age.</p>

<p>"Dead! my only son!" said Mrs. Kenyon, "he was drowned this
morning. Here is his hand; yesterday it was warm and full of life,
now it is cold as marble. Will you take it, will you look at the
lines? I want you to tell me if he met his death by accident or by
design?"</p>

<p>"You say that you are living in Philip Harman's house?" I
said.</p>

<p>"He asked us here on a visit."</p>

<p>"And this boy, this dead boy stood between him and the Kenyon
property?" was my next inquiry.</p>

<p>"How can you tell? How do you know?"</p>

<p>"But answer me, is it true?"</p>

<p>"It is true."</p>

<p>I now went on my knees and took one of the child's small white
hands in mine. I began to examine it.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," I said slowly, "this child has died a
violent death, and it was caused by design."</p>

<p>"It was?" cried the mother. "Can you swear it?" She clutched me
by the arm.</p>

<p>"I see it, but I cannot quite understand it," I answered, "there
is a strong indication here that the child was murdered, and yet
had I seen this hand in life I should have warned the boy against
lightning, but a death by lightning would be accidental. Tell me
how did the boy die?"</p>

<p>"By drowning. Early this morning he was bathing in the pool
which adjoins a wide stream in the grounds. He did not return. We
hastened to seek for him and found his body floating on the surface
of the water. He was quite dead."</p>

<p>"Was the pool deep?"</p>

<p>"In one part it was ten feet deep, the rest of the pool was
shallow. The doctor has been, and said that the child must have had
a severe attack of cramp, but even then the pool is small, and he
was a good swimmer for his age."</p>

<p>"Was no one with him?"</p>

<p>"No. His cousin, Philip Harman, often accompanied him, but he
bathed alone this morning."</p>

<p>"Where was Mr. Harman this morning?"</p>

<p>"He went to town by an early train, and does not know yet. You
say you think it was murder. How do you account for it?"</p>

<p>"The boy may have been drowned by accident, but I see something
more in his hand than mere drowning, something that baffles me, yet
it is plain--Lightning. Is there no mark on the body?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a small blue mark just below the inner ankle of
the right foot, but I think that was a bruise he must have got
yesterday. The doctor said it must have been done previously and
not in the pool as it would not have turned blue so quickly."</p>

<p>"May I see it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenyon raised the end of the sheet and showed the mark. I
looked at it long and earnestly.</p>

<p>"You are sure there was no thunder-storm this morning?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No, it was quite fine."</p>

<p>I rose slowly to my feet.</p>

<p>"I have looked at the boy's hand as you asked me," I said, "I
must repeat my words--there are indications that he came by his
death not by accident but design."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenyon's face underwent a queer change as I spoke. She came
suddenly forward, seized me by the arms and cried:</p>

<p>"I believe you, I believe you. I believe that my boy has been
murdered in some fiendish and inexplicable way. The police have
been here already, and of course there will be an inquest, but no
one is suspected. Who are we to suspect?"</p>

<p>"Philip Harman," I could not help answering.</p>

<p>"Why? Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"I am not at liberty to tell you. I make the suggestion."</p>

<p>"But it cannot be the case. The boy went to bathe alone in
perfect health. Philip went to town by an earlier train than usual.
I saw him off myself, I walked with him as far as the end of the
avenue. It was soon afterwards that I missed my little Paul, and
began to wonder why he had not returned to the house. I went with a
servant to the pool and I saw, oh, I saw that which will haunt me
to my dying day. He was my only son, Miss Marburg, my one great
treasure. What you have suggested, what I myself, alas, believe,
drives me nearly mad. But you must tell me why you suspect Philip
Harman."</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances it may not be wrong to tell you," I
said slowly. "The night I read your hand I also as you know read
his. I saw in his hand that he was about to be a murderer. I told
him so in as many words."</p>

<p>"You saw that? You told him! Oh, this is too awful! Philip has
wanted money of late and has been in the strangest state. He has
always been somewhat wild and given to speculation, and lately I
know lost heavily with different ventures. He proposed to a young
girl, a great friend of mine last week, but she would have nothing
to do with him. Yes, it all seems possible. My little Paul stood
between him and a great property. But how did he do it? There is
not a particle of evidence against him. Your word goes for nothing,
law and justice would only scout you. But we must act, Miss
Marburg, and you must help me to prove the murder of my boy, to
discover the murderer. I shall never rest until I have avenged
him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will help you," I answered.</p>

<p>As I descended the stairs accompanied by Mrs. Kenyon a strange
thought struck me.</p>

<p>"I have promised to help you, and we must act at once," I said.
"Will you leave this matter for the present in my hands, and will
you let me send a telegram immediately to my brother? I shall need
his assistance. He is a barrister and has chambers in town, but he
will come to me at once. He is very clever and practical."</p>

<p>"Is he entirely in your confidence?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. But pray tell me when do you expect Mr. Harman
back?"</p>

<p>"He does not know anything at present, as ha was going into the
country for the day; he will be back as usual to-night."</p>

<p>"That is so much the better. May I send for my brother?"</p>

<p>"Do anything you please. You will find some telegraph forms in
the hall and the groom can take your message at once."</p>

<p>I crossed the hall, found the telegraph forms on a table, sat
down and filled one in as follows:</p>

<p>"Come at once--I need your help most urgently. Diana."</p>

<p>I handed the telegram to a servant, who took it away at
once.</p>

<p>"And now," I said turning to Mrs. Kenyon, "will you show me the
pool? I shall go there and stay till my brother arrives."</p>

<p>"You will stay there, why?"</p>

<p>"I have my own reasons for wishing to do so. I cannot say more
now. Please show me the way."</p>

<p>We went across the garden and into a meadow beyond. At the
bottom of this meadow ran a swift-flowing stream. In the middle of
the stream was the pool evidently made artificially. Beside it on
the bank stood a small tent for dressing. The pool itself was a
deep basin in the rock about seven yards across, surrounded by
drooping willows which hung over it. At the upper end the stream
fell into it in a miniature cascade--at the lower end a wire fence
crossed it. This was doubtless done in order to prevent the cattle
stirring the water.</p>

<p>I walked slowly round the pool, looking down into its silent
depths without speaking. When I came back to where Mrs. Kenyon was
standing I said slowly: "I shall remain here until my brother
comes. Will you send me down a few sandwiches, and bring him or
send him to me directly he arrives?"</p>

<p>"But he cannot be with you for some hours," said Mrs. Kenyon. "I
fail to understand your reason."</p>

<p>"I scarcely know that yet myself," was my reply, "but I am
certain I am acting wisely. Will you leave me here? I wish to be
alone in order to think out a problem."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenyon slowly turned and went back to the house.</p>

<p>"I must unravel this mystery." I said to myself, "I must sift
from the apparent facts of the case the awful truth which lies
beneath. That sixth sense which has helped me up to the present
shall help me to the end. Beyond doubt foul play has taken place.
The boy met his death in this pool, but how? Beyond doubt this is
the only spot where a solution can be found. I will stay here and
think the matter through. If anything dangerous or fatal was put
into the pool the murderer shall not remove his awful weapon
without my knowledge."</p>

<p>So I thought and the moments flew. My head ached with the
intensity of my thought, and as the afternoon advanced I was no
nearer a solution than ever. It was between four and five o'clock
when to my infinite relief I saw Rupert hurrying across the
meadow.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, Diana?" he said. "Have you lost
your senses? When I got your extraordinary wire I thought you must
be ill."</p>

<p>I stood up, clasped his hands and looked into his face.</p>

<p>"Listen," I said. "A child has been murdered, and I want to
discover the murderer. You must help me."</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" was his remark.</p>

<p>"No, I am sane," I answered; "little Paul Kenyon has been
murdered. Do you remember telling me that he stood between Philip
Harman and the Kenyon property? He was drowned this morning in this
pool, the supposition being that the death occurred through
accident. Now listen, Rupert, we have got to discover how the boy
really met his death. The child was in perfect health when he
entered the pool, his dead body was found floating on the water
half-an-hour afterwards. The doctor said he died from drowning due
to cramp. What caused such sudden and awful cramp as would drown a
boy of his age within a few paces of the bank?"</p>

<p>"But what do you expect to find here?" said Rupert. He looked
inclined to laugh at me when first he arrived, but his face was
grave now, and even pale.</p>

<p>"Come here," I said suddenly, "I have already noticed one
strange thing; it is this. Look!"</p>

<p>As I spoke I took his hand and approached the wire fence which
protected the water from the cattle. Leaning over I said:</p>

<p>"Look down. Whoever designed this pool, for it was, of course,
made artificially, took more precaution than is usual to prevent
the water being contaminated. Do you see that fine wire netting
which goes down to the bottom of the pool? That wire has been put
there for some other reason than to keep cattle out. Rupert, do you
think by any possibility it has been placed there to keep something
in the pool?"</p>

<p>Rupert bent down and examined the wire carefully.</p>

<p>"It is curious," he said. "I see what you mean." A frown had
settled on his face. Suddenly he turned to me.</p>

<p>"Your suggestion is too horrible. Diana. What can be in the
pool? Do you mean something alive, something--" he stopped
speaking, his eyes were fixed on my face with a dawning horror.
"Were there any marks on the boy?" was his next question.</p>

<p>"One small blue mark on the ankle. Ah! look, what is that?"</p>

<p>At the further end and in the deep part of the pool I suddenly
saw the surface move and a slight eddying swirl appear on the
water. It increased into ever widening circles and vanished.</p>

<p>Rupert's bronzed face was now almost as white as mine. "We must
drag the pool immediately," he said. "Harman cannot prevent us; we
have seen enough to warrant what we do; I cannot let this pass.
Stay here, Diana, and watch. I will bring Mrs. Kenyon with me and
get her consent."</p>

<p>Rupert hurriedly left me and went back to the house across the
meadow. It was fully an hour before he returned. The water was once
more perfectly still. There was not the faintest movement of any
living thing beneath its surface. At the end of the hour I saw Mrs.
Kenyon, my brother, a gardener, and another man coming across the
meadow. One of the men was dragging a large net, one side of which
was loaded with leaden sinkers--the other held an old-fashioned
single-barrelled gun.</p>

<p>Rupert was now all activity. Mrs. Kenyon came and stood by my
side without speaking. Rupert gave quick orders to the men. Under
his directions one of them waded through the shallows just below
the pool, and reaching the opposite bank, threw the net across,
then the bottom of the net with the sinkers was let down into the
pool.</p>

<p>When this was done Rupert possessed himself of the gun and stood
at the upper end of the pool beside the little waterfall. He then
gave the word to the men to begin to drag. Slowly and gradually
they advanced, drawing the net forward, while all our eyes were
fixed upon the water. Not a word was spoken; the men had not taken
many steps when again was seen the swirl in the water, and a few
little eddies were sucked down. A sharp cry broke from Mrs.
Kenyon's lips. Rupert kept the gun in readiness.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Mrs. Kenyon, but the words had scarcely died
on her lips before a dark body lashed the surface of the water and
disappeared. What it was we none of us had the slightest idea; we
all watched spell-bound.</p>

<p>Still the net moved slowly on, and now the agitation of the
water became great. The creature, whatever it was, lashed and
lunged to and fro, now breaking back against the net, and now
attempting to spring up the smooth rock and so escape into the
stream. As we caught a glimpse and yet another glimpse of the long
coiling body I wondered if there was a snake in the pool.</p>

<p>"Come on, quicker now," shouted Rupert to the men, and they
pressed forward, holding the creature in the net, and, drawing it
every moment nearer the rock. The next instant Rupert raised the
gun, and leaning over the water, fired down. There was a burst of
spray, and as the smoke cleared we saw that the water was stained
with red blood.</p>

<p>Seizing the lower end of the net and exercising all their
strength the men now drew the net up. In its meshes, struggling in
death agony, was an enormous eel. The next moment it was on the
grass coiling to and fro. The men quickly dispatched it with a
stick, and then we all bent over it.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary-looking creature, six feet in length,
yet it had none of the ordinary appearance of the eel. I had never
seen anything like it before. Rupert went down on his knees to
examine it carefully. He suddenly looked up. A terrible truth had
struck him--his face was white.</p>

<p>"What is it?" gasped poor Mrs. Kenyon.</p>

<p>"You were right. Diana," said Rupert. "Look. Mrs. Kenyon. My
sister was absolutely right. Call her power what you will, she was
guided by something too wonderful for explanation. This is an
electric eel, no native of these waters--it was put here by
someone. This is murder. One stroke from the tail of such an eel
would give a child such a dreadful shock that he would be
paralysed, and would drown to a certainty."</p>

<p>"Then that explains the mark by lightning on the dead child's
hand." I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered my brother. "The police must take the matter
up."</p>

<p>Before that evening Mr. Harman was arrested. The sensational
case which followed was in all the papers. Against my will, I was
forced to attend the trial in order to give the necessary evidence.
It was all too damning and conclusive. The crime was brought home
to the murderer, who suffered the full penalty of the law.</p>
