  <h1 align="center"><b>The Ballad  of Ensign Joy</b></h1>
  <h3 align="center"><b>by<br>
    E.W. Hornung</b></h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the story of Ensign Joy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And the obsolete rank withal<br>
    That I love for each gentle English boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who jumped to his country&rsquo;s call.<br>
    By their fire and fun, and the deeds they&rsquo;ve done,<br>
    <i>I</i> would gazette them Second to none<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who faces a gun in Gaul!)</p>
  <p>It  is also the story of Ermyntrude<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A less appropriate name<br>
    For the dearest prig and the prettiest prude!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under it, all the same,<br>
    The usual consanguineous squad<br>
    Had made her an honest child of God&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left her to play the game.)</p>
  <p>It  was just when the grind of the Special Reserves,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employed upon Coast Defence,<br>
    Was getting on every Ensign&rsquo;s nerves&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick-keen to be drafted hence&mdash;<br>
    That they met and played tennis and danced and sang,<br>
    The lad with the laugh and the schoolboy slang,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with the eyes intense.</p>
  <p>Yet  it wasn&rsquo;t for him that she languished and sighed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for all of our dear deemed youth;<br>
    And it wasn&rsquo;t for her, but her sex, that he cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he could but have probed the truth !<br>
    Did she? She would none of his hot young heart;<br>
    As khaki escort he&rsquo;s tall and smart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lover a shade uncouth.</p>
  <p>He went  with his draft. She returned to her craft.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote in his merry vein:<br>
    She read him aloud, and the Studio laughed!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ermyntrude bore the strain.)<br>
    He was full of gay bloodshed and Old Man Fritz:<br>
    His flippancy sent her friends into fits.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ermyntrude frowned with pain.)</p>
  <p>His  tales of the Sergeant who swore so hard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left Ermyntrude cold and prim;<br>
    The tactless truth of the picture jarred,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of his jokes were grim.<br>
    Yet, let him but skate upon tender ice,<br>
    And he had to write to her twice or thrice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she would answer him.</p>
  <p>(Yet  once she sent him a fairy&rsquo;s box,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her pocket felt the brunt<br>
    Of tinned contraptions and books and socks&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he hailed as &ldquo;a sporting stunt!&rdquo;<br>
    She slaved at his muffler none the less,<br>
    And still took pleasure in murmuring, &ldquo;Yes!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a friend of mine at the Front.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p>One  fine morning his name appears&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking so pretty in print!<br>
  &ldquo;Wounded!&rdquo; she warbles in tragedy tears&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pictures the reddening lint,<br>
    The drawn damp face and the draggled hair . . .<br>
    But she found him blooming in Grosvenor Square,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a punctured shin in a splint.</p>
  <p>It  wasn&rsquo;t a haunt of Ermyntrude&rsquo;s,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That grandiose urban pile;<br>
    Like starlight in arctic altitudes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the stately Sister&rsquo;s smile.<br>
    It was just the reverse with Ensign Joy&mdash;<br>
    In his golden greeting no least alloy&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his shining eyes no guile!</p>
  <p>He showed  her the bullet that did the trick&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed her the trick, X-ray&rsquo;d;<br>
    He showed her a table timed to a tick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a map that an airman made.<br>
    He spoke of a shell that caused grievous loss&mdash;<br>
    But he never mentioned a certain cross<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his part in the escapade!</p>
  <p>She  saw it herself in a list next day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it brought her back to his bed,<br>
    With a number of beautiful things to say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which were mostly over his head.<br>
    Turned pink as his own pyjamas&rsquo; stripe,<br>
    To her mind he ceased to embody a type&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank into her heart instead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I Wonder  that all of you didn&rsquo;t retire!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My blighters were not that kind.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;But it says&nbsp;you&nbsp;&rsquo;advanced under murderous fire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machine-gun and shell combined&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the regular War Office wheeze!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo; &lsquo;Advanced&rsquo;&mdash;with that leg!&mdash;&lsquo;on his hands and knees&rsquo;!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t leave it behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was  soon trick-driving an invalid chair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dancing about on a crutch;<br>
    The&nbsp;<i>haute noblesse</i>&nbsp;of  Grosvenor Square<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt bound to oblige as such;<br>
    They sent him for many a motor-whirl&mdash;<br>
    With the wistful, willowy wisp of a girl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who never again lost touch.</p>
  <p>Their  people were most of them dead and gone.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had only themselves to please.<br>
    His pay was enough to marry upon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As every Ensign sees.<br>
    They would muddle along (as in fact they did)<br>
    With vast supplies of the&nbsp;<i>tertium quid</i><br>
    You bracket with bread-and-cheese.</p>
  <p>They  gave him some leave after Grosvenor Square&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bang went a month on banns;<br>
    For Ermyntrude had a natural<i> flair</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the least unusual plans.<br>
    Her heaviest uncle came down well,<br>
    And entertained, at a fair hotel,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dregs of the coupled clans.</p>
  <p>A Certain  number of cheques accrued<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the wolf from the door:<br>
    The economical Ermyntrude<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had charge of the dwindling store,<br>
    When a Board reported her bridegroom fit<br>
    As&mdash;some expression she didn&rsquo;t permit . . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he left for the Front once more.</p>
  <p>His  crowd had been climbing the jaws of hell:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found them in death&rsquo;s dogteeth,<br>
    With little to show but a good deal to tell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their fissure of smoking heath.<br>
    There were changes&mdash;of course&mdash;but the change in him<br>
    Was the ribbon that showed on his tunic trim<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tumult hidden beneath!</p>
  <p>For  all he had suffered and seen before<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed nought to a husband&rsquo;s care;<br>
    And the Chinese puzzle of modern war<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For subtlety couldn&rsquo;t compare<br>
    With the delicate springs of the complex life<br>
    To be led with a highly sensitized wife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a slightly rarefied air!</p>
  <p>Yet  it&rsquo;s good to be back with the old platoon&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A man in a world of men&rdquo;!<br>
    Each cheery dog is a henchman boon&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially Sergeant Wren!<br>
    Ermyntrude couldn&rsquo;t endure his name&mdash;<br>
    Considered bad language no lien on fame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it&rsquo;s good to&mdash;hear it again!</p>
  <p>(Better  to feel the Sergeant&rsquo;s grip,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though your fingers ache to the bone!<br>
    Better to take the Sergeant&rsquo;s tip<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to make up your mind alone.<br>
    They can do things together, can Wren and Joy&mdash;<br>
    The bristly bear and the beardless boy&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That neither could do on his own.)</p>
  <p>But  there&rsquo;s never a word about Old Man Wren<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the screeds he scribbles to-day&mdash;<br>
    Though he praises his N.C.O.&rsquo;s and men<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rather a pointed way.<br>
    And he rubs it in (with a knitted brow)<br>
    That the war&rsquo;s as good as a picnic now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And better than any play!</p>
  <p>His  booby-hutch is &ldquo;as safe as the Throne,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he fares &ldquo;like the C.-in-Chief,&rdquo;<br>
    But has purchased &ldquo;a top-hole gramophone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of comic relief.&rdquo;<br>
    (And he sighs as he hears the men applaud,<br>
    While the Woodbine spices are wafted abroad<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the odour of bully-beef.)</p>
  <p>He may  touch on the latest type of bomb,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ermyntrude needn&rsquo;t blench,<br>
    For he never says where you hurl it from,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it might be from your trench.<br>
    He never might lead a stealthy band,<br>
    Or toe the horrors of No Man&rsquo;s Land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or swim at the sickly stench. . . .</p>
  <p><i>Her </i>letters came up by ration-cart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the men stood-to before dawn:<br>
    He followed the chart of her soaring heart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With face transfigured yet drawn:<br>
    It filled him with pride, touched with chivalrous shame.<br>
    But&mdash;it spoilt the war, as a first-class game,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this particular pawn.</p>
  <p>The  Sergeant sees it, and damns the cause<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a truly terrible flow;<br>
    But turns and trounces, without a pause,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A junior N. C. O.<br>
    For the crime of agreeing that Ensign Joy<br>
    Isn&rsquo;t altogether the officer boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he was four months ago!</p>
  <p>At  length he&rsquo;s dumfounded (the month being May)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a sample of Ermyntrude&rsquo;s fun!<br>
  &ldquo;You will kindly get leave&nbsp;<i>over Christmas  Day</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or make haste and finish the Hun!&rdquo;<br>
    But Christmas means presents, she bids him beware:<br>
  &ldquo;So what do you say to a son and heir?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;m thinking of  giving you one!!!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What,  indeed, does the Ensign say?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he sit and write?<br>
    What do his heart-strings drone all day?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they throb all night?<br>
    What does he add to his piteous prayers?&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Not for my own sake, Lord, but&mdash;<i>theirs</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See me safe through . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  talk&rdquo;&mdash;and he writhes&mdash;&ldquo;of our spirit out here,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our valour and all the rest!<br>
    There&rsquo;s my poor, lonely, delicate dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As brave as the very best!<br>
    We stand or fall in a cheery crowd,<br>
    And yet how often we grouse aloud!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>She</i> faces&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;with a jest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  has had no sleep for a day and a night;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has written her half a ream;<br>
    He has lain him down to wait for the light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at last come sleep&mdash;and a dream.<br>
    He&rsquo;s hopping on sticks up the studio stair:<br>
    A telegraph-boy is waiting there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&mdash;that is his darling&rsquo;s scream!</p>
  <p>He  picks her up in a tender storm&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how does it come to pass<br>
    That he cannot see his reflected form<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hers in the studio glass?<br>
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that mirror?&rdquo; he cries.<br>
    But only the Sergeant&rsquo;s voice replies:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wake up, Sir! The Gas&mdash;the Gas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Is  it a part of the dream of dread?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the men about?<br>
    Each one sticking a haunted head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a spectral clout!<br>
    Funny, the dearth of gibe and joke,<br>
    When each one looks like a pig in a poke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not omitting the snout!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s  your mask, Sir! No time to lose!&rdquo;<br>
    Ugh, what a gallows shape!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly white cap, and partly noose!<br>
    Somebody ties the tape.<br>
    Goggles of sorts, it seems, inset:<br>
  Cock them over the parapet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study the battlescape.</p>
  <p>Ensign  Joy&rsquo;s in the second line&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more than a bit cut off;<br>
    A furlong or so down a green incline<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire-trench curls in the trough.<br>
    Joy cannot see it&mdash;it&rsquo;s in the bed<br>
    Of a river of poison that brims instead.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only hear&mdash;a cough!</p>
  <p>Nothing  to do for the Companies there&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but waiting now,<br>
    While the Gas rolls up on the balmy air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a small bird cheeps on a bough.<br>
    All of a sudden the sky seems full<br>
    Of trusses of lighted cotton-wool<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the enemy&rsquo;s big bow-wow!</p>
  <p>The  firmament cracks with his airy mines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And an interlacing hail<br>
    Threshes the clover between our lines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a vile invisible flail.<br>
    And the trench has become a mighty vice<br>
    That holds us, in skins of molten ice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the vapors that fringe the veil.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s  coming&mdash;in billowy swirls&mdash;as smoke<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the roof a world on fire.<br>
    It&mdash;comes! And a lad with a heart of oak<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows only that heart&rsquo;s desire!<br>
    His masked lips whimper but one dear name&mdash;<br>
    And so is he lost to inward shame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he thrills at the word: &ldquo;<i>Re-tire!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whose  is the order, thrice renewed?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensign Joy cannot tell :<br>
    Only, that way lies Ermyntrude,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other way this hell!<br>
    Three men leap from the poisoned fosse,<br>
    Three men plunge from the parados,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&mdash;their&mdash;officer&mdash;as well!</p>
  <p>Now,  as he flies at their flying heels,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He awakes to his deep disgrace,<br>
    But the yawning pit of his shame reveals<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A way of saving his face:<br>
    He twirls his stick to a shepherd&rsquo;s crook,<br>
    To trip and bring one of them back to book,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though he&rsquo;d been giving chase!</p>
  <p>He got  back gasping&mdash;&ldquo;They&rsquo;d too much start!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve shot &lsquo;em instead!&rdquo; said Wren.<br>
  &ldquo;That was your job, Sir, if you&rsquo;d the &lsquo;eart&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it wouldn&rsquo;t&lsquo;ve been you, then.<br>
    I pray my Lord I may live to see<br>
    A firing-party in front o&rsquo; them three!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That&rsquo;s what he said to the men.)</p>
  <p>Now,  Joy and Wren, of Company B,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are a favourite firm of mine;<br>
    And the way they reinforced A, C, and D<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was, perhaps, not unduly fine;<br>
    But it meant a good deal both to Wren and Joy&mdash;<br>
    That grim, gaunt man, but that desperate boy!&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it didn&rsquo;t weaken the Line.</p>
  <p>Not  a bad effort of yours, my lad,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Major deigned to declare.<br>
  &ldquo;My Sergeant&rsquo;s plan, Sir&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And <i>that&rsquo;s</i> not bad&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you&rsquo;ve lost that ribbon you wear?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;It&mdash;must have been eaten away by the Gas!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Well&mdash;ribbons are ribbons&mdash;but don&rsquo;t be an ass!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s better to do than dare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dare!  He has dared to desert his post&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he daren&rsquo;t acknowledge his sin!<br>
    He has dared to face Wren with a lying boast&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wren is not taken in.<br>
    None sings his praises so long and loud&mdash;<br>
    With look so loving and loyal and proud!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the boy sees under his skin.</p>
  <p>Daily  and gaily he wrote to his wife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had dropped the beatified droll<br>
    And was writing to him on the Meaning of Life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Bonds between Body and Soul.<br>
    Her courage was high&mdash;though she mentioned its height;<br>
    She was putting upon her the Armour of Light&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including her aureole!</p>
  <p>But  never a helm had the lad we know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he went on his nightly raids<br>
    With a brace of his Blighters, an N. C O.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a bagful of hand-grenades<br>
    And the way he rattled and harried the Hun&mdash;<br>
    The deeds he did dare, and the risks he would run&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the gossip of the Brigades.</p>
  <p>How  he&rsquo;d stand stockstill as the trunk of a tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his face tucked down out of sight,<br>
    When a flare went up and the other three<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell prone in the frightening light.<br>
    How the German sandbags, that made them quake,<br>
    Were the only cover he cared to take,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he&rsquo;d eavesdrop there all night.</p>
  <p>Machine-Guns,  tapping a phrase in Morse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew hot on a random quest,<br>
    And swarms of bullets buzzed down the course<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like wasps from a trampled nest.<br>
    Yet, that last night! They had just set off<br>
    When he pitched on his face with a smothered cough,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a row of holes in his chest.</p>
  <p>He left  a letter. It saved the lives<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three who ran from the Gas;<br>
    A small enclosure alone survives,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Middlesex, under glass:<br>
    Only the ribbon that left his breast<br>
    On the day he turned and ran with the rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lied with a lip of brass!</p>
  <p>But  the letters they wrote about the boy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Brigadier to the men!<br>
    They would never forget dear Mr. Joy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not look on his like again.<br>
    Ermyntrude read them with dry, proud eye.<br>
    There was only one letter that made her cry.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was from Sergeant Wren:</p>
  <p>There  never was such a fearless man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or one so beloved as he.<br>
    He was always up to some daring plan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or some treat for his men and me.<br>
    There wasn&rsquo;t his match when he went away;<br>
    But since he got back, there has not been a day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he has earned a V. C</p>
  <p>A cynical  story? That&rsquo;s not my view.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years since he fell are twain.<br>
    What were his chances of coming through?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of his friends remain?<br>
    But Ermyntrude&rsquo;s training a splendid boy<br>
    Twenty years younger than Ensign Joy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, a British gain!</p>
  <p>And  Ermyntrude, did she lose her all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or find it, two years ago?<br>
    O young girl-wives of the boys who fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your youth and your babes to show!<br>
    No heart but bleeds for your widowhood.<br>
    Yet Life is with you, and Life is good.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bone of <i>your</i> bone lies low!</p>
  <p>Your  blessedness came&mdash;as it went&mdash;in a day.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep dread but heightened your mirth.<br>
    Your idols&rsquo; feet never turned to clay&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never lit upon common earth.<br>
    Love is the Game but is <i>not</i> the Goal:<br>
    You played it together, body and soul,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you had your Candle&rsquo;s worth.</p>
  <p>Yes!  though the Candle light a Shrine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heart cannot count the cost,<br>
    You are Winners yet in its tender shine!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would <i>they</i> choose  to have lived and lost?<br>
    There are chills, you see, for the finest hearts;<br>
    But, once it is only old Death that parts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can never come twinge of frost.</p>
  <p>And  this be our comfort for Every Boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut down in his high heyday,<br>
    Or ever the Sweets of the Morning cloy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the Green Leaf wither away;<br>
    So a sunlit billow curls to a crest,<br>
    And shouts as it breaks at its loveliest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a glory of rainbow spray!</p>
  <p>Be it  also the making of Ermyntrude,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a hundred more&mdash;<br>
    Compact of foibles and fortitude&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woo&rsquo;d, won, and widow&rsquo;d, in War.<br>
    God, keep us gallant and undefiled,<br>
    Worthy of Husband, Lover, or&mdash;Child . . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet as themselves at the core!</p>
