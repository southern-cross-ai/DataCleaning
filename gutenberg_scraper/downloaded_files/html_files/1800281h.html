  <p>Children  we deemed you all the days<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We vexed you with our care:<br>
    But in a Universe ablaze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your childish share?<br>
    To rush upon the flames of Hell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quench them with your blood!<br>
    To be of England&rsquo;s flower that fell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere yet it brake the bud!</p>
  <p>And  we who wither where we grew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never shed but tears,<br>
    As children now would follow you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the remaining years;<br>
    Tread in the steps we thought to guide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As firmly as you trod;<br>
    And keep the name you glorified<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean before man and God.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="LordsLeave"></a>Lord&rsquo;s Leave<br>
    (1915)</b></h2>
  <p>No Lord&rsquo;s  this year: no silken lawn on which<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dignified and dainty throng  meanders.<br>
    The Schools take guard upon a fierier pitch<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere  in Flanders.</p>
  <p>Bigger  the cricket here; yet some who tried<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain to earn a Colour while  at Eton<br>
    Have found a place upon an England side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  can&rsquo;t be beaten!</p>
  <p>A  demon bowler&rsquo;s bowling with his head&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart&rsquo;s as black as skins  in Carolina!<br>
    Either he breaks, or shoots almost as dead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As  Anne Regina;</p>
  <p>While  the deep-field-gun, trained upon your stumps,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From concrete grand-stand far  beyond the bound&rsquo;ry,<br>
    Lifts up his ugly mouth and fairly pumps<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shells  from Krupp&rsquo;s foundry.</p>
  <p>But  like the time the game is out of joint&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No screen, and too much mud for  cricket lover;<br>
    Both legs go slip, and there&rsquo;s sufficient point<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  extra cover!</p>
  <p>Cricket?  &lsquo;Tis Sanscrit to the super-Hun&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheap cross between Caligula  and Cassius,<br>
    To whom speech, prayer, and warfare are all one&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally  gaseous!</p>
  <p>Playing  a game&rsquo;s beyond him and his hordes;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs but to play the snake or  wolf or vulture:<br>
    Better one sporting lesson learnt at Lord&rsquo;s<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than  all their Kultur. . . .</p>
  <p>Sinks  a torpedoed Phoebus from our sight;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the field of play see  darkness stealing;<br>
    Only in this one game, against the light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s  no appealing.</p>
  <p>Now  for their flares. . . and now at last the stars. . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the stars now, in their  heavenly million,<br>
    Glisten and blink for pity on our scars<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From  the Pavilion.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="LastPost"></a>Last Post<br>
    (1915)</b></h2>
  <p>Last  summer, centuries ago,<br>
    I watched the postman&rsquo;s lantern glow,<br>
    As night by night on leaden feet<br>
    He twinkled down our darkened street.</p>
  <p>So  welcome on his beaten track,<br>
    The bent man with the bulging sack!<br>
    But dread of every sleepless couch,<br>
    A whistling imp with leathern pouch!</p>
  <p>And  now I meet him in the way,<br>
    And earth is Heaven, night is Day,<br>
    For oh! there shines before his lamp<br>
    An envelope without a stamp!</p>
  <p>Address  in pencil; overhead,<br>
    The Censor&rsquo;s triangle in red.<br>
    Indoors and up the stair I bound:<br>
  &ldquo;One from the boy, still safe, still sound!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still  merry in a dubious trench<br>
    They&rsquo;ve taken over from the French;<br>
    Still making light of duty done;<br>
    Still full of Tommy, Fritz, and fun!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still  finding War of games the cream,<br>
    And his platoon a priceless team&mdash;<br>
    Still running it by sportsman&rsquo;s rule,<br>
    Just as he ran his house at school.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still  wild about the &lsquo;bombing stunt&rsquo;<br>
    He makes his hobby at the front.<br>
    Still trustful of his wondrous luck&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Prepared to take on old man Kluck!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Awed  only in the peaceful spells,<br>
    And only scornful of their shells,<br>
    His beaming eye yet found delight<br>
    In ruins lit by flares at night,</p>
  <p>In  clover field and hedgerow green,<br>
    Apart from cover or a screen,<br>
    In Nature spurting spick-and-span<br>
    For all the devilries of Man.</p>
  <p>He  said those weeks of blood and tears<br>
    Were worth his score of radiant years.<br>
    He said he had not lived before&mdash;<br>
    Our boy who never dreamt of War!</p>
  <p>He  gave us of his own dear glow,<br>
    Last summer, centuries ago.<br>
    Bronzed leaves still cling to every bough.<br>
    I don&rsquo;t waylay the postman now.</p>
  <p>Doubtless  upon his nightly beat<br>
    He still comes twinkling down our street.<br>
    I am not there with straining eye&mdash;<br>
    A whistling imp could tell you why.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheOldBoys"></a>The Old Boys<br>
(1917)</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is the one with the empty sleeve?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Some sport who was in the swim.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;And the one with the ribbon who&rsquo;s home on leave?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good Lord! I remember <i>him!<br>
  </i>A hulking fool, low down in the school,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no good at games was he&mdash;<br>
    All fingers and thumbs&mdash;and very few chums.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I wish he&rsquo;d shake hands with me!)&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is the one with the heavy stick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who seems to walk from the shoulder?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Why, many&rsquo;s the goal you have watched him kick!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking a lifetime older.<br>
    Who is the one that&rsquo;s so full of fun&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never beheld a blither&mdash;<br>
    Yet his eyes are fixt as the furrow betwixt?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He cannot see out of either,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are the ones that <i>we</i> cannot see,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we feel them as near as near?<br>
    In Chapel one felt them bend the knee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the match one felt them cheer.<br>
    In the deep still shade of the Colonnade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ringing quad&rsquo;s full light,<br>
    They are laughing here, they are chaffing there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet never in sound or sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  those are the ones who never shall leave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they once were afraid they would!<br>
    They marched away from the school at eve,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at dawn came back for good,<br>
    With deathless blooms from uncoffin&rsquo;d tombs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lay at our Founder&rsquo;s shrine.<br>
    As many are they as ourselves to-day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their place is yours and mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  who are the ones they can help or harm?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Each small boy, never so new,<br>
    Has an Elder Brother to take his arm,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show him the thing to do&mdash;<br>
    And the thing to resist with a doubled fist,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he&rsquo;d be nor knave nor fool&mdash;<br>
    And the Game to play if he&rsquo;d tread the way<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the School behind the school.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="RuddyYoungGinger"></a>Ruddy Young Ginger<br>
(1915)</b></h2>
  <p>Ruddy  young Ginger was somewhere in camp,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War broke it up in a day,<br>
    Packing cadets of the steadier stamp<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home with the smallest delay.<br>
    Ginger braves town in his O.T.C. rags&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beards a Staff Marquis&mdash;the limb!<br>
    Saying, &ldquo;Your son, Sir, is one of my fags,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gets a Commission through him.<br>
    Then to his tailor&rsquo;s for khaki <i>complet</i>;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to Pall Mall for a sword;<br>
    Lastly, a wire to his people to say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Left school&mdash;joined the Line&mdash;are you bored?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  it <i>was</i> a bit cool<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A term&rsquo;s  fees in the pool<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a  rule of the school).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There  were those who said &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  young Ginger.</p>
  <p>Ruddy  young Ginger! Who gave him that name?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommies who had his own nerve!<br>
  &ldquo;Into &lsquo;im, Ginger!&rdquo; was heard in a game<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a neighbouring Special Reserve.<br>
    Blushing and grinning and looking fifteen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ginger, with howitzer punt,<br>
    Bags his man&rsquo;s wind as succinctly and clean<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he hopes to bag Huns at the front.<br>
    Death on recruits who fall out by the way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentries who yawn at their post,<br>
    Yet he sang such a song at the Y.M.C.A.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the C.O. turned green as a ghost!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less  the song than the stance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the  dissolute dance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew a  glance so askance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That...  they packed him to France,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little  Ginger.</p>
  <p>Next  month, to the haunts of fine Ladies and Lords<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ventured, in Grosvenor Square:<br>
    The stateliest chambers were hospital wards&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ruddy young Ginger was there.<br>
    In spite of his hurts he looked never so red,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ever less shy or sedate,<br>
    Though his hair had been cropped (by machine-gun, he said)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bandages turbaned his pate.<br>
    He was mostly in holes&mdash;but his cheek was intact!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not but notice, with joy,<br>
    The loveliest Sisters had most to transact<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ruddy young Ginger&mdash;some boy!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaying  Huns by the tons,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a  smile like a nun&rsquo;s&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! of  all the brave ones,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the  sons of our guns&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give  me Ginger!</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBalladofEnsignJoy"></a>The Ballad of Ensign Joy<br>
    (1917)</b></h2>
  <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon  cited wonders three;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One  was the way of a ship at sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One  was the way of a mighty bird,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the way of a serpent was the third.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  Solomon (since he was in the trade)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appended  the way of a man with a maid:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  Solomon (still in the flesh) might add<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  way of a mad with a soldier lad.</i></p>
  <p>This is the story of Ensign Joy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And the obsolete rank withal<br>
    That I love for each gentle English boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who jumped to his country&rsquo;s call.<br>
    By their fire and fun, and the deeds they&rsquo;ve done,<br>
  <i>I</i> would gazette them Second to none<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who faces a gun in Gaul!)</p>
  <p>It is also the story of Ermyntrude<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A less appropriate name<br>
    For an idealistic Academy purde; prude!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under it, all the same,<br>
    The usual consanguineous squad<br>
    Had made her an honest child of God&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cannot be held to blame.)</p>
  <p>It was just when the grind of the Special  Reserves,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employed upon Coast Defence,<br>
    Was getting on every Ensign&rsquo;s nerves&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick-keen to be drafted hence&mdash;<br>
    That they met and played tennis and danced and sang,<br>
    The lad with the laugh and the schoolboy slang,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with the eyes intense.</p>
  <p>Yet it wasn&rsquo;t for him that she languished  and sighed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for all of our dear doomed youth;<br>
    And it wasn&rsquo;t for her, but her sex, that he cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he could but have probed the truth!<br>
    Did she? She would none of his hot young heart;<br>
    As khaki escort he&rsquo;s tall and smart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lover a shade uncouth.</p>
  <p>He went with his draft. She returned to  her craft.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote in his merry vein:<br>
    She read him aloud, and the Studio laughed!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ermyntrude bore the strain.)<br>
    He was full of gay bloodshed and Old Man Fritz:<br>
    His flippancy sent her friends into fits.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ermyntrude frowned with pain.)</p>
  <p>His tales of the Sergeant who swore so  hard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left Ermyntrude cold and prim;<br>
    The tactless truth of the picture jarred,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of his jokes were grim.<br>
    Yet, let him but skate upon tender ice,<br>
    And he had to write to her twice or thrice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she would answer him.</p>
  <p>(Yet once she sent him a fairy&rsquo;s box,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her pocket felt the brunt<br>
    Of tinned contraptions and books and socks&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he hailed as &ldquo;a sporting stunt!&rdquo;<br>
    She slaved at his muffler none the less,<br>
    And still took pleasure in murmuring, &ldquo;Yes!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a friend of mine at the Front.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p>One fine morning his name appears&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking so pretty in print!<br>
  &ldquo;Wounded!&rdquo; she warbles in tragedy tears&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pictures the reddening lint,<br>
    The drawn damp face and the draggled hair . . .<br>
    But she found him blooming in Grosvenor Square,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a punctured shin in a splint.</p>
  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t a haunt of Ermyntrude&rsquo;s,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That grandiose urban pile;<br>
    Like starlight in arctic altitudes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the stately Sister&rsquo;s smile.<br>
    Tropical sunshine was Ensign Joy&mdash;<br>
    In his golden greeting no least alloy&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his shining eyes no guile!</p>
  <p>He showed her the bullet that did the  trick&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed her the trick, X-ray&rsquo;d;<br>
    He showed her a table timed to a tick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a map that an airman made.<br>
    He spoke of a shell that caused grievous loss&mdash;<br>
    But he never mentioned a certain cross<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his part in the escapade!</p>
  <p>She saw it herself in a list next day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it brought her back to his bed,<br>
    With a number of beautiful things to say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which were mostly over his head.<br>
    Turned pink as his own pyjamas&rsquo; stripe,<br>
    To her mind he ceased to embody a type&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank into her heart instead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I Wonder that all of you didn&rsquo;t retire!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My blighters were not that kind.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;But it says&nbsp;<i>you</i>&mdash;&rsquo;advanced under  murderous fire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machine-gun and shell combined&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the regular War Office wheeze!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo; &lsquo;Advanced&rsquo;&mdash;with that leg!&mdash;&lsquo;on his hands and knees&rsquo;!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t leave it behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was soon trick-driving an invalid  chair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dancing about on a crutch;<br>
    The&nbsp;<i>haute noblesse</i>&nbsp;of Belgrave Square<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were moved to oblige as such;<br>
    They sent him for many a motor-whirl&mdash;<br>
    With the wistful, willowy wisp of a girl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who never again lost touch.</p>
  <p>Their people were most of them dead and  gone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had only themselves to please.<br>
    His pay was enough to marry upon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As every Ensign sees.<br>
    They would muddle along as others did,<br>
    With vast supplies of the&nbsp;<i>tertium quid</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One bracket with bread and cheese.</p>
  <p>They gave him some leave after Belgrave Square&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bang went a month on banns;<br>
    For Ermyntrude had a natural<i>&nbsp;flair</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the least unusual plans.<br>
    Her heaviest uncle came down well,<br>
    And entertained, at a fair hotel,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dregs of the coupled clans.</p>
  <p>A certain number of cheques accrued<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the wolf from the door:<br>
    The economical Ermyntrude<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had charge of the dwindling store,<br>
    When a Board reported her bridegroom fit<br>
    As&mdash;some expression she didn&rsquo;t permit . . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he left for the Front once more.</p>
  <p>His crowd had been climbing the jaws of  hell:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found them in death&rsquo;s dogteeth,<br>
    With little to show but a good deal to tell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their fissure of smoking heath.<br>
    There were changes&mdash;of course&mdash;but the change in him<br>
    Was the ribbon that showed on his tunic trim<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tumult hidden beneath!</p>
  <p>For all he had suffered and seen before<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed nought to a husband&rsquo;s care;<br>
    And the Chinese puzzle of modern war<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For subtlety couldn&rsquo;t compare<br>
    With the delicate springs of the complex life<br>
    To be led with a highly sensitized wife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a slightly rarefied air!</p>
  <p>Yet it&rsquo;s good to be back with the old  platoon&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and some of the same old men;<br>
    Each cheery dog is a henchman boon&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially Sergeant Wren!<br>
    Ermyntrude couldn&rsquo;t endure his name&mdash;<br>
    Considered bad language no claim on fame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it&rsquo;s good to&mdash;hear it again!</p>
  <p>(Better to feel the Sergeant&rsquo;s grip,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though your fingers ache to the bone!<br>
    Better to take the Sergeant&rsquo;s tip<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to make up your mind alone.<br>
    They can do things together, can Wren and Joy&mdash;<br>
    The bristly bear and the beardless boy&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That neither could do on his own.)</p>
  <p>But there&rsquo;s never a word about Old Man  Wren<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the screeds he scribbles to-day&mdash;<br>
    Though he praises his N.C.O.&rsquo;s and men<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rather a pointed way.<br>
    And he rubs it in (with a knitted brow)<br>
    That the war&rsquo;s as good as a picnic now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And better than any play!</p>
  <p>His booby-hutch is &ldquo;as safe as the  Throne,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he fares &ldquo;like the C.-in-Chief,&rdquo;<br>
    He has &ldquo;treated his chaps to a gramophone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of comic relief.&rdquo;<br>
    (And he sighs as he hears the men applaud,<br>
    While the Woodbine spices are wafted abroad<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the savour of bully-beef.)</p>
  <p>He may touch on the latest type of bomb,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ermyntrude needn&rsquo;t blench,<br>
    For he never says where you hurl it from,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it might be from your trench.<br>
    He never might lead a stealthy band,<br>
    Or toe the horrors of No Man&rsquo;s Land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or swim at the sickly stench. . . .</p>
  <p><i>Her&nbsp;</i>letters came up by ration-cart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the men stood-to before dawn:<br>
    He followed the chart of her soaring heart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With face transfigured yet drawn:<br>
    It filled him with pride, touched with chivalrous shame.<br>
    But&mdash;it spoilt the war, as a first-class game,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this particular pawn.</p>
  <p>(The Sergeant sees it, and damns the cause<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a duly sullphurous flow;<br>
    But turns and trounces, without a pause,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A junior N. C. O.<br>
    For the crime of agreeing that Ensign Joy<br>
    Isn&rsquo;t altogether the officer boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he was four months ago!</p>
  <p>At length he&rsquo;s dumfounded (the month being  May)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a sample of Ermyntrude&rsquo;s fun!<br>
  &ldquo;You will kindly get leave&nbsp;<i>over Christmas Day</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or make haste and finish the Hun!&rdquo;<br>
    But Christmas means presents, she bids him beware:<br>
  &ldquo;So what do you say to a son and heir?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;m thinking of giving you one!!!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What, indeed, does the Ensign say?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he sit and write?<br>
    What do his heart-strings drone all day?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they throb all night?<br>
    What does he add to his piteous prayers?&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Not for my own sake, Lord, but&mdash;<i>theirs</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See me safe through . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They talk&rdquo;&mdash;and he writhes&mdash;&ldquo;of our spirit  out here,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our valour and all the rest!<br>
    There&rsquo;s my poor, lonely, delicate dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As brave as the very best!<br>
  <i>We</i> stand or fall in a cheery crowd,<br>
    And yet how often we grouse aloud!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>She</i>&nbsp;faces&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;with a  jest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He has had no sleep for a day and a night;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has written her half a ream;<br>
    He has lain him down to wait for the light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at last come sleep&mdash;and a dream.<br>
    He&rsquo;s hopping on sticks up the studio stair:<br>
    A telegraph-boy is waiting there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&mdash;that is his darling&rsquo;s scream!</p>
  <p>He picks her up in a tender storm&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how does it come to pass<br>
    That he cannot see his reflected form<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hers in the studio glass?<br>
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that mirror?&rdquo; he cries.<br>
    But only the Sergeant&rsquo;s voice replies:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wake up, Sir! The Gas&mdash;the Gas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Is it a part of the dream of dread?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the men about?<br>
    Each one sticking a haunted head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a spectral clout!<br>
    Funny, the dearth of gibe and joke,<br>
    When each one looks like a pig in a poke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not omitting the snout!</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s your mask, Sir! No time to lose!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ugh, what a gallows shape!<br>
    Partly white cap, and partly noose!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody ties the tape.<br>
    Goggles of sorts, it seems, inset:<br>
    Cock them over the parapet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study the battlescape.</p>
  <p>Ensign Joy&rsquo;s in the second line&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more than a bit cut off;<br>
    A furlong or so down a green incline<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire-trench curls in the trough.<br>
    Joy cannot see it&mdash;it&rsquo;s in the bed<br>
    Of a river of poison that brims instead.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only hear&mdash;a cough!</p>
  <p>Nothing to do for the Companies there&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but waiting now,<br>
    While the Gas rolls up on the balmy air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a small bird cheeps on a bough.<br>
    All of a sudden the sky seems full<br>
    Of trusses of lighted cotton-wool<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the enemy&rsquo;s big bow-wow!</p>
  <p>The firmament cracks with his airy mines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And an interlacing hail<br>
    Threshes the clover between our lines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a vile invisible flail.<br>
    And the trench has become a mighty vice<br>
    That holds us, in skins of molten ice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the vapors that fringe the veil.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s coming&mdash;in billowy swirls&mdash;as smoke<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the roof a world on fire.<br>
    It&mdash;comes! And a lad with a heart of oak<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows only that heart&rsquo;s desire!<br>
    His masked lips whimper but one dear name&mdash;<br>
    And so is he lost to inward shame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he thrills at the word: &ldquo;<i>Re-tire!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whose is the order, thrice renewed?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensign Joy cannot tell:<br>
    Only, that way lies Ermyntrude,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other way this hell!<br>
    Three men leap from the poisoned fosse,<br>
    Three men plunge from the parados,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&mdash;their&mdash;officer&mdash;as well!</p>
  <p>Now, as he flies at their flying heels,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He awakes to his deep disgrace,<br>
    But the yawning pit of his shame reveals<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A way of saving his face:<br>
    He twirls his stick to a shepherd&rsquo;s crook,<br>
    To trip and bring one of them back to book,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though he&rsquo;d been giving chase!</p>
  <p>He got back gasping&mdash;&ldquo;They&rsquo;d too much  start!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve shot &lsquo;em sight!&rdquo; said Wren.<br>
  &ldquo;That was your job, Sir, if you&rsquo;d the &lsquo;eart&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it wouldn&rsquo;t&lsquo;ve been you, then.<br>
    I pray my Lord I may live to see<br>
    A firing-party in front o&rsquo; them three!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That&rsquo;s what he said to the men.)</p>
  <p>Now, Joy and Wren, of Company B,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are a favourite firm of mine;<br>
    And the way they reinforced A, C, and D<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was, perhaps, not exactly fine,<br>
    But it meant a good deal both to Wren and Joy&mdash;<br>
    That grim, gaunt man, but that desperate boy!&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it didn&rsquo;t weaken the Line.</p>
  <p>Not a bad effort of yours, my lad,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Major deigned to declare.<br>
  &ldquo;My Sergeant&rsquo;s plan, Sir&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And&nbsp;<i>that&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;not bad&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you&rsquo;ve lost that ribbon you wear?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;It&mdash;must have been eaten away by the Gas!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Well&mdash;ribbons are ribbons&mdash;but don&rsquo;t be an ass!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s better to do than dare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dare! He has dared to desert his post&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he daren&rsquo;t acknowledge his sin!<br>
    He has dared to face Wren with a lying boast&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wren is not taken in.<br>
    None sings his praises so long and loud&mdash;<br>
    With look so loving and loyal and proud!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the boy sees under his skin.</p>
  <p>Daily and gaily he wrote to his wife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had dropped the beatified droll<br>
    And was writing to him on the marvel of Life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which illumed and exalted her soul.<br>
    Her courage was high&mdash;though she mentioned its height;<br>
    But he saw not a joint in her Armour of Light&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the bee in her Aureole!</p>
  <p>But never a helm had the lad we know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he went on his nightly raids<br>
    With a brace of his Blighters, an N. C O.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a bagful of hand-grenades.<br>
    And the way he rattled and harried the Hun&mdash;<br>
    The deeds he did dare, and the risks he would run&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the gossip of two Brigades:</p>
  <p>How he&rsquo;d stand stockstill as the trunk of  a tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his face tucked down out of sight,<br>
    When a star-shell burst and the other three<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell prone in the frightening light.<br>
    How the German sandbags, that made them quake,<br>
    Were the only cover he cared to take,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he&rsquo;d eavesdrop there all night. . . .</p>
  <p>Machine-Guns, tapping a phrase in Morse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew hot on a random quest,<br>
    And swarms of bullets buzzed down the course<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like wasps from a trampled nest.<br>
    Yet, that last night . . . They had just set off,<br>
    When he pitched on his face with a smothered cough,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a row of holes in his chest.</p>
  <p>He left a letter. It saved the lives<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three who ran from the Gas;<br>
    A small enclosure alone survives,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Battersea, under glass:<br>
    Only the ribbon that left his breast<br>
    On the day he turned and ran with the rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lied with a lip of brass!</p>
  <p>But the letters they wrote about the boy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Brigadier to the men!<br>
    They would &ldquo;never forget dear Mr. Joy,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not look on his like again.<br>
    Ermyntrude read them with dry, proud eye.<br>
    There was only one letter that made her cry.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was from Sergeant Wren:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There never was such a fearless man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or one so beloved as he.<br>
    He was always up to some daring plan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or some treat for his men and me.<br>
    There wasn&rsquo;t his match when he went away;<br>
    But since he got back, there has not been a day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he has earned a V. C.&rdquo; . . .</p>
  <p>A cynical story? That&rsquo;s not my view.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years since he fell are twain.<br>
    What were his chances of coming through?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of his friends remain?<br>
    But Ermyntrude&rsquo;s training a splendid boy<br>
    Twenty years younger than Ensign Joy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, a British gain!</p>
  <p>And Ermyntrude, did she lose her all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or find it, two years ago?<br>
    O young girl-wives of the boys who fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your youth and your babes to show!<br>
    No heart but bleeds for your widowhood.<br>
    Yet Life is with you, and Life is good.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bone of&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;bone lies low!</p>
  <p>Your blessedness came&mdash;as it went&mdash;in a day.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep dread but heightened your mirth.<br>
    Your idols&rsquo; feet never turned to clay&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never lit upon common earth.<br>
    Love is the Game but is&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;the Goal:<br>
    You played it together, body and soul,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you had your Candle&rsquo;s worth.</p>
  <p>Yes! though the Candle light a Shrine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heart cannot count the cost,<br>
    You are Winners yet in its tender shine!&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would&nbsp;<i>they</i>&nbsp;choose to have lived and  lost?<br>
    There are chills, you see, for the finest hearts;<br>
    But, once it is only old Death that parts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can never come twinge of frost.</p>
  <p>And this be our comfort for Everyboy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut down in his high heyday,<br>
    Or ever the Sweets of the Morning cloy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the swift foot falter or stray.<br>
    So a sunlit billow curls to a crest,<br>
    And shouts as it breaks at its loveliest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a glory of rainbow spray!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BondAndFree"></a>Bond And Free<br>
    (The Bapaume Road,&nbsp;<i>March</i>&nbsp;1917)</b></h2>
  <p>Misty  and pale the sunlight, brittle and black the trees;<br>
    Roads powdered like sticks of candy for a car to crunch as they freeze...<br>
    Then we overtook a Battalion... and it wasn&rsquo;t a roadway then,<br>
    But cymbals and drums and dulcimers to the beat of the marching men!</p>
  <p>They  were laden and groomed for the trenches, they were shaven and scrubbed and fed;<br>
    Like the scales of a single Saurian their helmets rippled ahead;<br>
    Not a sorrowful face beneath them, just the tail of a scornful eye<br>
    For the car full of favoured mufti that went quacking and quaking by.</p>
  <p>You  gloat and take note in your motoring coat, and the sights come fast and thick:<br>
    A party of pampered prisoners, toying with shovel and pick;<br>
    A town where some of the houses are so many&nbsp;  heaps of stone,<br>
    And some of them steel anatomies picked clean to the buckled bone.</p>
  <p>A  road like a pier in a hurricane of mountainous seas of mud,<br>
    Where a few trees, whittled to walking-sticks, rose out of the frozen flood<br>
    Like the masts of the sunken villages that might have been down below&mdash;<br>
    Or blown off the festering face of an earth that God Himself wouldn&rsquo;t know!</p>
  <p>Not  a yard but was part of a shell-hole&mdash;not an inch, to be more precise&mdash;<br>
    And most of the holes held water, and all the water was ice:<br>
    They stared at the bleak blue heavens like the glazed blue eyes of the slain,<br>
    Till the snow came, shutting them gently, and sheeting the slaughtered plain.</p>
  <p>Here  a pile of derelict rifles, there a couple of horses lay&mdash;<br>
    Like rockerless rocking-horses, as wooden of leg as they,<br>
    And not much redder of nostril&mdash;not anything like so grim<br>
    As the slinking ghoul of a lean live cat creeping over the crater&rsquo;s rim!</p>
  <p>And  behind and beyond and about us were the long black Dogs of War,<br>
    With pigmies pulling their tails for them, and making the monsters roar<br>
    As they slithered back on their haunches, as they put out their flaming  tongues,<br>
    And spat a murderous message long leagues from their iron lungs!</p>
  <p>They  were kennelled in every corner, and some were in gay disguise,<br>
    But all kept twitching their muzzles and baying the silvery skies!<br>
    A howitzer like a hyena guffawed point-blank at the car&mdash;<br>
    But only the sixty - pounder leaves an absolute aural scar!</p>
  <p>(Could  a giant but crack a cable as a stockman cracks his whip,<br>
    Or tear up a mile of calico with one unthinkable r-r-r-r-rip!<br>
    Could he only squeak a slate-pencil about the size of this gun,<br>
    You might get some faint idea of its sound, which is those three sounds in  one.)</p>
  <p>But  certain noises were absent, we looked for some sights in vain,<br>
    And I cannot tell you if shrapnel does really descend like rain&mdash;<br>
    Or Big Stuff burst like a bonfire, or bullets whistle or moan;<br>
    But the other figures I&rsquo;ll swear to&mdash;if some of &lsquo;em <i>are</i> my own!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Livid  and moist the twilight, heavy with snow the trees,<br>
    And a road as of pleated velvet the colour of new cream-cheese. . .<br>
    Then we overtook a Battalion... and I&rsquo;m hunting still for the word<br>
    For that gaunt, undaunted, haunted, whitening, frightening herd!</p>
  <p>They  had done their tour of the trenches, they were coated and caked with mud,<br>
    And some of them wore a bandage, and some of them wore their blood!<br>
    The gaps in their ranks were many, and none of them looked at me. . .<br>
    And I thought of no more vain phrases for the things I was there to see,<br>
    But I felt like a man in a prison van where the rest of the world goes Free.</p>

    (1918)</b></h2>
  <p>All  night they crooned high overhead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the skies are over men:<br>
    I lay and smiled in my cellar bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went to sleep again.</p>
  <p>All  day they whistled like a lash<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cracked in the trembling town:<br>
    I stood and listened for the crash<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of houses thundering down.</p>
  <p>In,  in they came, three nights and days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night and all day long;<br>
    It made us learned in their ways<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And experts on their song.</p>
  <p>Like  a noisy clock, or a steamer&rsquo;s screw,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their beat debauched the ear,<br>
    And left it dead to a deafening few<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That burst who cared how near?</p>
  <p>We  only laughed when the flimsy floor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaved on the shuddering sod:<br>
    But when some idiot slammed a door&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My God!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBigThing"></a>The Big Thing<br>
    (1918)</b></h2>
  <p>It was  a British Linesman. His face was like a fist,<br>
    His sleeve all stripes and chevrons from the elbow to the wrist.<br>
    Said he to an American (with other words of his):<br>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big thing you are doing&mdash;do you know how big it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess, Sir,&rdquo; that American inevitably drawled,<br>
  &ldquo;Big Bill&rsquo;s our proposition an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; for him bald.<br>
    You guys may have him rattled, but I figure it&rsquo;s for us<br>
    To slaughter, quarter, grill or bile, an&rsquo; masticate the cuss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope your teeth,&rdquo; the Linesman said, &ldquo;are equal to your tongue&mdash;<br>
    But that&rsquo;s the sort of carrion that&rsquo;s better when it&rsquo;s hung.<br>
    Yet&mdash;the big thing you&rsquo;re doing I should like to make you see!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Our stunt,&rdquo; said that young Yankee, &ldquo;is to set the whole world free!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Linesman used a venial verb (and other parts of speech):<br>
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way the papers talk and politicians preach!<br>
    But apart from gastronomical designs upon the Hun&mdash;<br>
    And the rather taller order&mdash;there&rsquo;s a big thing that you&rsquo;ve <i>done</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  say! The biggest thing on earth, to any cute onlooker,<br>
    Is Old Man Bull and Uncle Sam aboard the same blamed hooker!<br>
    One crew, one port, one speed ahead, steel-true twin-hearts within her:<br>
    One ding-dong English-singin&rsquo; race&mdash;a race without a winner!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  boy&rsquo;s a boyish mixture&mdash;half high-brow and half droll:<br>
    So brave and na&iuml;ve and cock-a-hoop&mdash;so sure yet pure of soul!<br>
    Behold him bright and beaming as the bride-groom after church&mdash;<br>
    The Linesman looking wistful as a rival in the lurch!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  love to be as young as you&mdash;&rdquo; he doesn&rsquo;t even swear&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Love to be joining up anew and spoiling for my share!<br>
    But when your blood runs cold and old, and brain and bowels squirm,<br>
    The only thing to ease you is some fresh blood in the firm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  the war was young, and <i>we</i> were young, we felt the same as you<br>
    A few short months of glory&mdash;and we didn&rsquo;t care how few!<br>
    French, British and Dominions, it took us all the same&mdash;<br>
    Who knows but what the Hun himself enjoyed his dirty game!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  tumbled out of tradesmen&rsquo;s carts, we fell off office stools;<br>
    Fathers forsook their families, boys ran away from schools;<br>
    Mothers untied their apron-strings, lovers unloosed their arms&mdash;<br>
    All Europe was a wedding and the bells were war&rsquo;s alarms!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  chime had changed&mdash;You took a pull&mdash;the old wild peal rings on<br>
    With the clamour and the glamour of a Generation gone.<br>
    Their fun&mdash;their fire&mdash;their hearts&rsquo; desire&mdash;are born again in You!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;<i>That</i> the big thing we&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  as big as Man can do!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When  I lie dying in my bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grief to wife, and child, and friend,&mdash;<br>
    How I shall grudge you gallant dead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sudden, swift, heroic end!</p>
  <p>Dear  hands will minister to me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear eyes deplore each shallower breath:<br>
    You had your battle-cries, you three,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cheer and charm you to your death.</p>
  <p>You  did not wane from worse to worst,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under coarse drug or futile knife,<br>
    But in one grand mad moment burst<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From glorious life to glorious Life....</p>
  <p>These  twenty years ago and more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Mid purple heather and brown crag,<br>
    Our whole school numbered scarce a score,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three have fallen for the Flag.</p>
  <p>You  two have finished on one side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You who were friend and foe at play;<br>
    Together you have done and died;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was where you learnt the way.</p>
  <p>And  the third face! I see it now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So delicate and pale and brave.<br>
    The clear grey eye, the unruffled brow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were ripening for a soldier&rsquo;s grave.</p>
  <p>Ah!  gallant three, too young to die!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pity of it all endures.<br>
    Yet, in my own poor passing, I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall lie and long for such as yours.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="UppinghamSong"></a>Uppingham Song<br>
    (1913)</b></h2>
  <p>Ages  ago (as to-day they are reckoned)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a lone little, blown little fag:<br>
    Panting to heel when Authority beckoned,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoiling to write for the&nbsp;<i>Uppingham Mag.!<br>
  </i>Thirty years on seemed a terrible time then&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years back seems a twelvemonth or so.<br>
    Little I saw myself spinning this rhyme then&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less do I feel that it&rsquo;s ages ago!</p>
  <p>Ages  ago that was Somebody&rsquo;s study;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody Else had the study next door.<br>
    O their long walks in the fields dry or muddy!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O their long talks in the evenings of yore!<br>
    Still, when they meet, the old evergreen fellows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaw in the jolly old jargon as though<br>
    Both were as slender and sound in the bellows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they were ages and ages ago!</p>
  <p>O  but the ghosts at each turn I could show you!&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts in low collars and little cloth caps&mdash;<br>
    Each of &lsquo;em now quite an elderly O.U.&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiser, no doubt, and as pleasant&mdash;perhaps!<br>
    That&rsquo;s where poor Jack lit the slide up with tollies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once when the quad was a foot deep in snow&mdash;<br>
    When a live Bishop was one of the Pollies * &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ages and ages and ages ago!</p>
  <p>Things  that were Decent and things that were Rotten,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How I remember them year after year!<br>
    Some&mdash;it may be&mdash;that were better forgotten:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some that&mdash;it may be&mdash;should still draw a tear. . .<br>
    More, many more, that are good to remember:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yarns that grow richer, the older they grow:<br>
    Deeds that would make a man&rsquo;s ultimate ember<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glow with the fervour of ages ago!</p>
  <p>Did  we play footer in funny long flannels?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had we no Corps to give zest to our drill?<br>
    Never a Gym lined throughout with pine panels?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half of your best buildings were quarry-stone still?<br>
    Ah! but it&rsquo;s not for their looks that you love them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for the craft of the builder below,<br>
    But for the spirit behind and above them&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the Spirit of Ages Ago!</p>
  <p>Eton  may rest on her Field and her River.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrow has songs that she knows how to sing.<br>
    Winchester slang makes the sensitive shiver.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rugby had Arnold, but never had Thring!<br>
    Repton can put up as good an Eleven.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marlborough men are the fear of the foe.<br>
    All that I wish to remark is&mdash;thank Heaven<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="WoodenCrosses"></a>Wooden Crosses<br>
    (1917)</b></h2>
  <p>Go  live the wide world over&mdash;but when you come to die,<br>
    A quiet English churchyard is the only place to lie!<br>
    I held it half a lifetime, until through war&rsquo;s mischance<br>
    I saw the wooden crosses that fret the fields of France.</p>
  <p>A  thrush sings in an oak-tree, and from the old square tower<br>
    A chime as sweet and mellow salutes the idle hour:<br>
    Stone crosses take no notice&mdash;but the little wooden ones<br>
    Are thrilling every minute to the music of the guns!</p>
  <p>Upstanding  at attention they face the cannonade,<br>
    In apple-pie alinement like Guardsmen on parade:<br>
    But Tombstones are Civilians who loll or sprawl or sway<br>
    At every crazy angle and stage of slow decay.</p>
  <p>For  them the Broken Column&mdash;in its plot of unkempt grass;<br>
    The tawdry tinsel garland safeguarded under glass;<br>
    And the Squire&rsquo;s emblazoned virtues, that would overweight a Saint,<br>
    On the vault empaled in iron&mdash;scaling red for want of paint!</p>
  <p>The  men who die for England don&rsquo;t need it rubbing in;<br>
    An automatic stamper and a narrow strip of tin<br>
    Record their date and regiment, their number and their name&mdash;<br>
    And the Squire who dies for England is treated just the same.</p>
  <p>So  stand the still battalions: alert, austere, serene;<br>
    Each with his just allowance of brown earth shot with green;<br>
    None better than his neighbour in pomp or circumstance&mdash;<br>
    All beads upon the rosary that turned the fate of France!</p>
  <p>Who  says their war is over? While others carry on,<br>
    The little wooden crosses spell but the dead and gone?<br>
    Not while they deck a sky-line, not while they crown a view,<br>
    Or a living soldier sees them and sets his teeth anew!</p>
  <p>The  tenants of the churchyard where the singing thrushes build<br>
    Were not, perhaps, all paragons of promise well fulfilled:<br>
    Some failed&mdash;through Love, or Liquor&mdash;while the parish looked askance.<br>
    But&mdash;you cannot <i>die</i> a Failure if you win a Cross in France!</p>
  <p>The  brightest gems of Valour in the Army&rsquo;s diadem<br>
    Are the V.C. and the D.S.O., M.C. and D.C.M.<br>
    But those who live to wear them will tell you they are dross<br>
    Beside the Final Honour of a simple Wooden Cross.</p>
