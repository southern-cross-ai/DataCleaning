<p align="center"><b>I.</b>
</p>

<p>At five o'clock the sombre egg-shaped room at the Ritz ripens to
subtle melody&mdash;the light clat-clat of one lump, two lumps,
into the cup, and the ding of the shining teapots and cream-pots as
they kiss elegantly in transit upon a silver tray. There are those
who cherish that amber hour above all other hours, for now the
pale, pleasant toil of the lilies who inhabit the Ritz is
over&mdash;the singing decorative part of the day remains.</p>

<p>Moving your eyes around the slightly raised horse-shoe balcony
you might, one spring afternoon, have seen young Mrs. Alphonse Karr
and young Mrs. Charles Hemple at a table for two. The one in the
dress was Mrs. Hemple&mdash;when I say "the dress" I refer to that
black immaculate affair with the big buttons and the red ghost of a
cape at the shoulders, a gown suggesting with faint and fashionable
irreverence the garb of a French cardinal, as it was meant to do
when it was invented in the Rue de la Paix. Mrs. Karr and Mrs.
Hemple were twenty-three years old, and their enemies said that
they had done very well for themselves. Either might have had her
limousine waiting at the hotel door, but both of them much
preferred to walk home (up Park Avenue) through the April
twilight.</p>

<p>Luella Hemple was tall, with the sort of flaxen hair that
English country girls should have, but seldom do. Her skin was
radiant, and there was no need of putting anything on it at all,
but in deference to an antiquated fashion&mdash;this was the year
1920&mdash;she had powdered out its high roses and drawn on it a
new mouth and new eyebrows&mdash;which were no more successful than
such meddling deserves. This, of course, is said from the
vantage-point of 1925. In those days the effect she gave was
exactly right.</p>

<p>"I've been married three years," she was saying as she squashed
out a cigarette in an exhausted lemon. "The baby will be two years
old to-morrow. I must remember to get&mdash;"</p>

<p>She took a gold pencil from her case and wrote "Candles" and
"Things you pull, with paper caps," on an ivory date-pad. Then,
raising her eyes, she looked at Mrs. Karr and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you something outrageous?"</p>

<p>"Try," said Mrs. Karr cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Even my baby bores me. That sounds unnatural, Ede, but it's
true. He doesn't begin to fill my life. I love him with all my
heart, but when I have him to take care of for an afternoon, I get
so nervous that I want to scream. After two hours I begin praying
for the moment the nurse'll walk in the door."</p>

<p>When she had made this confession, Luella breathed quickly and
looked closely at her friend. She didn't really feel unnatural at
all. This was the truth. There couldn't be anything vicious in the
truth.</p>

<p>"It may be because you don't love Charles," ventured Mrs. Karr,
unmoved.</p>

<p>"But I do! I hope I haven't given you that impression with all
this talk." She decided that Ede Karr was stupid. "It's the very
fact that I do love Charles that complicates matters. I cried
myself to sleep last night because I know we're drifting slowly but
surely toward a divorce. It's the baby that keeps us together."</p>

<p>Ede Karr, who had been married five years, looked at her
critically to see if this was a pose, but Luella's lovely eyes were
grave and sad.</p>

<p>"And what is the trouble?" Ede inquired.</p>

<p>"It's plural," said Luella, frowning. "First, there's food. I'm
a vile housekeeper, and I have no intention of turning into a good
one. I hate to order groceries, and I hate to go into the kitchen
and poke around to see if the ice-box is clean, and I hate to
pretend to the servants that I'm interested in their work, when
really I never want to hear about food until it comes on the table.
You see, I never learned to cook, and consequently a kitchen is
about as interesting to me as a&mdash;as a boiler-room. It's simply
a machine that I don't understand. It's easy to say, 'Go to cooking
school,' the way people do in books&mdash;but, Ede, in real life
does anybody ever change into a model Hausfrau&mdash;unless they
have to?"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Ede non-committally. "Tell me more."</p>

<p>"Well, as a result, the house is always in a riot. The servants
leave every week. If they're young and incompetent, I can't train
them, so we have to let them go. If they're experienced, they hate
a house where a woman doesn't take an intense interest in the price
of asparagus. So they leave&mdash;and half the time we eat at
restaurants and hotels."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose Charles likes that."</p>

<p>"Hates it. In fact, he hates about everything that I like. He's
lukewarm about the theatre, hates the opera, hates dancing, hates
cocktail parties&mdash;sometimes I think he hates everything
pleasant in the world. I sat home for a year or so. While Chuck was
on the way, and while I was nursing him. I didn't mind. But this
year I told Charles frankly that I was still young enough to want
some fun. And since then we've been going out whether he wants to
or not." She paused, brooding. "I'm so sorry for him I don't know
what to do, Ede&mdash;but if we sat home, I'd just be sorry for
myself. And to tell you another true thing, I'd rather that he'd be
unhappy than me."</p>

<p>Luella was not so much stating a case as thinking aloud. She
considered that she was being very fair. Before her marriage men
had always told her that she was "a good sport," and she had tried
to carry this fairness into her married life. So she always saw
Charley's point of view as clearly as she saw her own.</p>

<p>If she had been a pioneer wife, she would probably have fought
the fight side by side with her husband. But here in New York there
wasn't any fight. They weren't struggling together to obtain a
far-off peace and leisure&mdash;she had more of either than she
could use. Luella, like several thousand other young wives in New
York, honestly wanted something to do. If she had had a little more
money and a little less love, she could have gone in for horses or
for vagarious amour. Or if they had had a little less money, her
surplus energy would have been absorbed by hope and even by effort.
But the Charles Hemples were in between. They were of that enormous
American class who wander over Europe every summer, sneering rather
pathetically and wistfully at the customs and traditions and
pastimes of other countries, because they have no customs or
tradition or pastimes of their own. It is a class sprung yesterday
from fathers and mothers who might just as well have lived two
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The tea-hour had turned abruptly into the before-dinner hour.
Most of the tables had emptied until the room was dotted rather
than crowded with shrill isolated voices and remote, surprising
laughter&mdash;in one corner the waiters were already covering the
tables with white for dinner.</p>

<p>"Charles and I are on each other's nerves." In the new silence
Luella's voice rang out with startling clearness, and she lowered
it precipitately. "Little things. He keeps rubbing his face with
his hand&mdash;all the time, at table, at the theatre&mdash;even
when he's in bed. It drives me wild, and when things like that
begin to irritate you, it's nearly over."</p>

<p>She broke off and, reaching backward, drew up a light fur around
her neck. "I hope I haven't bored you, Ede. It's on my mind,
because to-night tells the story. I made an engagement for
to-night&mdash;an interesting engagement, a supper after the
theatre to meet some Russians, singers or dancers or something, and
Charles says he won't go. If he doesn't&mdash;then I'm going alone.
And that's the end."</p>

<p>She put her elbows on the table suddenly and, bending her eyes
down into her smooth gloves, began to cry, stubbornly and quietly.
There was no one near to see, but Ede Karr wished that she had
taken her gloves off. She would have reached out consolingly and
touched her bare hand. But the gloves were a symbol of the
difficulty of sympathizing with a woman to whom life had given so
much. Ede wanted to say that it would "come out all right," that it
wasn't "so bad as it seemed," but she said nothing. Her only
reaction was impatience and distaste.</p>

<p>A waiter stepped near and laid a folded paper on the table, and
Mrs. Karr reached for it.</p>

<p>"No, you mustn't," murmured Luella brokenly. "No, I invited you!
I've got the money right here."</p>

<p align="center"><b>II.</b>
</p>

<p>The Hemples' apartment&mdash;they owned it&mdash;was in one of
those impersonal white palaces that are known by number instead of
name. They had furnished it on their honeymoon, gone to England for
the big pieces, to Florence for the bric-a-brac, and to Venice for
the lace and sheer linen of the curtains and for the glass of many
colors which littered the table when they entertained. Luella
enjoyed choosing things on her honeymoon. It gave a purposeful air
to the trip, and saved it from ever turning into the rather dismal
wandering among big hotels and desolate ruins which European
honeymoons are apt to be.</p>

<p>They returned, and life began. On the grand scale. Luella found
herself a lady of substance. It amazed her sometimes that the
specially created apartment and the specially created limousine
were hers, just as indisputably as the mortgaged suburban bungalow
out of The Ladies' Home Journal and the last year's car that fate
might have given her instead. She was even more amazed when it all
began to bore her. But it did. The evening was at seven when she
turned out of the April dusk, let herself into the hall, and saw
her husband waiting in the living-room before an open fire. She
came in without a sound, closed the door noiselessly behind her,
and stood watching him for a moment through the pleasant effective
vista of the small salon which intervened. Charles Hemple was in
the middle thirties, with a young serious face and distinguished
iron-gray hair which would be white in ten years more. That and his
deep-set, dark-gray eyes were his most noticeable
features&mdash;women always thought his hair was romantic; most of
the time Luella thought so too.</p>

<p>At this moment she found herself hating him a little, for she
saw that he had raised his hand to his face and was rubbing it
nervously over his chin and mouth. It gave him an air of
unflattering abstraction, and sometimes even obscured his words, so
that she was continually saying "What?" She had spoken about it
several times, and he had apologized in a surprised way. But
obviously he didn't realize how noticeable and how irritating it
was, for he continued to do it. Things had now reached such a
precarious state that Luella dreaded speaking of such matters any
more&mdash;a certain sort of word might precipitate the imminent
scene.</p>

<p>Luella tossed her gloves and purse abruptly on the table.
Hearing the faint sound, her husband looked out toward the
hall.</p>

<p>"Is that you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>She went into the living-room, and walked into his arms and
kissed him tensely. Charles Hemple responded with unusual
formality, and then turned her slowly around so that she faced
across the room.</p>

<p>"I've brought some one home to dinner."</p>

<p>She saw then that they were not alone, and her first feeling was
of strong relief; the rigid expression on her face softened into a
shy, charming smile as she held out her hand.</p>

<p>"This is Doctor Moon&mdash;this is my wife." A man a little
older than her husband, with a round, pale, slightly lined face,
came forward to meet her.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mrs. Hemple," he said. "I hope I'm not
interfering with any arrangements of yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Luella cried quickly. "I'm delighted that you're
coming to dinner. We're quite alone."</p>

<p>Simultaneously she thought of her engagement to-night, and
wondered if this could be a clumsy trap of Charles' to keep her at
home. If it were, he had chosen his bait badly. This man&mdash;a
tired placidity radiated from him, from his face, from his heavy,
leisurely voice, even from the three year old shine of his
clothes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she excused herself and went into the kitchen to
see what was planned for dinner. As usual they were trying a new
pair of servants, the luncheon had been ill-cooked and ill-served
she would let them go to-morrow. She hoped Charles would talk to
them&mdash;she hated to get rid of servants. Sometimes they wept,
and sometimes they were insolent, but Charles had a way with him.
And they were always afraid of a man.</p>

<p>The cooking on the stove, however, had a soothing savor. Luella
gave instructions about "which china," and unlocked a bottle of
precious chianti from the buffet. Then she went in to kiss young
Chuck good night.</p>

<p>"Has he been good?" she demanded as he crawled enthusiastically
into her arms.</p>

<p>"Very good," said the governess. "We went for a long walk over
by Central Park."</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you a smart boy!" She kissed him ecstatically.</p>

<p>"And he put his foot into the fountain, so we had to come home
in a taxi right away and change his little shoe and stocking."</p>

<p>"That's right. Here, wait a minute, Chuck!" Luella unclasped the
great yellow beads from around her neck and handed them to him.
"You mustn't break mama's beads." She turned to the nurse. "Put
them on my dresser, will you, after he's asleep?"</p>

<p>She felt a certain compassion for her son as she went
away&mdash;the small enclosed life he led, that all children led,
except in big families. He was a dear little rose, except on the
days when she took care of him. His face was the same shape as
hers; she was thrilled sometimes, and formed new resolves about
life when his heart beat against her own.</p>

<p>In her own pink and lovely bedroom, she confined her attentions
to her face, which she washed and restored. Doctor Moon didn't
deserve a change of dress, and Luella found herself oddly tired,
though she had done very little all day. She returned to the
living-room, and they went in to dinner.</p>

<p>"Such a nice house, Mrs. Hemple," said Doctor Moon impersonally;
"and let me congratulate you on your fine little boy."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Coming from a doctor, that's a nice compliment." She
hesitated. "Do you specialize in children?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a specialist at all," he said. "I'm about the last of
my kind&mdash;a general practitioner."</p>

<p>"The last in New York, anyhow," remarked Charles. He had begun
rubbing his face nervously, and Luella fixed her eyes on Doctor
Moon so that she wouldn't see. But at Charles's next words she
looked back at him sharply.</p>

<p>"In fact," he said unexpectedly, "I've invited Doctor Moon here
because I wanted you to have a talk with him to-night."</p>

<p>Luella sat up straight in her chair.</p>

<p>"A talk with me?"</p>

<p>"Doctor Moon's an old friend of mine, and I think he can tell
you a few things, Luella, that you ought to know."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" She tried to laugh, but she was surprised and
annoyed. "I don't see, exactly, what you mean. There's nothing the
matter with me. I don't believe I've ever felt better in my
life."</p>

<p>Doctor Moon looked at Charles, asking permission to speak.
Charles nodded, and his hand went up automatically to his face.</p>

<p>"Your husband has told me a great deal about your unsatisfactory
life together," said Doctor Moon, still impersonally. "He wonders
if I can be of any help in smoothing things out."</p>

<p>Luella's face was burning.</p>

<p>"I have no particular faith in psychoanalysis," she said coldly,
"and I scarcely consider myself a subject for it."</p>

<p>"Neither have I," answered Doctor Moon, apparently unconscious
of the snub; "I have no particular faith in anything but myself. I
told you I am not a specialist, nor, I may add, a faddist of any
sort. I promise nothing."</p>

<p>For a moment Luella considered leaving the room. But the
effrontery of the suggestion aroused her curiosity too.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what Charles has told you," she said,
controlling herself with difficulty, "much less why. But I assure
you that our affairs are a matter entirely between my husband and
me. If you have no objections, Doctor Moon, I'd much prefer to
discuss something&mdash;less personal."</p>

<p>Doctor Moon nodded heavily and politely. He made no further
attempt to open the subject, and dinner proceeded in what was
little more than a defeated silence. Luella determined that,
whatever happened, she would adhere to her plans for to-night. An
hour ago her independence had demanded it, but now some gesture of
defiance&mdash;had become necessary to her self-respect. She would
stay in the living-room for a short moment after dinner; then, when
the coffee came, she would excuse herself and dress to go out. But
when they did leave the dining-room, it was Charles who, in a
quick, unarguable way, vanished.</p>

<p>"I have a letter to write," he said; "I'll be back in a moment."
Before Luella could make a diplomatic objection, he went quickly
down the corridor to his room, and she heard him shut his door.</p>

<p>Angry and confused, Luella poured the coffee and sank into a
corner of the couch, looking intently at the fire.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, Mrs. Hemple," said Doctor Moon suddenly. "This
was forced upon me. I do not act as a free agent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of you," she interrupted. But she knew that she
was lying. She was a little afraid of him, if only for his dull
insensitiveness to her distaste.</p>

<p>"Tell me about your trouble," he said very naturally, as though
she were not a free agent either. He wasn't even looking at her,
and except that they were alone in the room, he scarcely seemed to
be addressing her at all.</p>

<p>The words that were in Luella's mind, her will, on her lips,
were: "I'll do no such thing." What she actually said amazed her.
It came out of her spontaneously, with apparently no co-operation
of her own.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see him rubbing his face at dinner?" she said
despairingly. "Are you blind? He's become so irritating to me that
I think I'll go mad."</p>

<p>"I see." Doctor Moon's round face nodded.</p>

<p>"Don't you see I've had enough of home?" Her breasts seemed to
struggle for air under her dress. "Don't you see how bored I am
with keeping house, with the baby&mdash;everything seems as if it's
going on forever and ever? I want excitement; and I don't care what
form it takes or what I pay for it, so long as it makes my heart
beat."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>It infuriated Luella that he claimed to understand. Her feeling
of defiance had reached such a pitch that she preferred that no one
should understand. She was content to be justified by the
impassioned sincerity of her desires.</p>

<p>"I've tried to be good, and I'm not going to try any more. If
I'm one of those women who wreck their lives for nothing, then I'll
do it now. You can call me selfish, or silly, and be quite right;
but in five minutes I'm going out of this house and begin to be
alive."</p>

<p>This time Doctor Moon didn't answer, but he raised his head as
if he were listening to something that was taking place a little
distance away.</p>

<p>"You're not going out," he said after a moment; "I'm quite sure
you're not going out."</p>

<p>Luella laughed.</p>

<p>"I am going out."</p>

<p>He disregarded this.</p>

<p>"You see, Mrs. Hemple, your husband isn't well. He's been trying
to live your kind of life, and the strain of it has been too much
for him. When he rubs his mouth&mdash;"</p>

<p>Light steps came down the corridor, and the maid, with a
frightened expression on her face, tiptoed into the room.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hemple&mdash;"</p>

<p>Startled at the interruption, Luella turned quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Can I speak to&mdash;?" Her fear broke precipitately through
her slight training. "Mr. Hemple, he's sick! He came into the
kitchen a while ago and began throwing all the food out of the
ice-box, and now he's in his room, crying and singing&mdash;"
Suddenly Luella heard his voice.</p>

<p align="center"><b>III.</b>
</p>

<p>Charles Hemple had had a nervous collapse. There were twenty
years of almost uninterrupted toil upon his shoulders, and the
recent pressure at home had been too much for him to bear. His
attitude toward his wife was the weak point in what had otherwise
been a strong-minded and well-organized career&mdash;he was aware
of her intense selfishness, but it is one of the many flaws in the
scheme of human relationships that selfishness in women has an
irresistible appeal to many men. Luella's selfishness existed side
by side with a childish beauty, and, in consequence, Charles Hemple
had begun to take the blame upon himself for situations which she
had obviously brought about. It was an unhealthy attitude, and his
mind had sickened, at length, with his attempts to put himself in
the wrong. After the first shock and the momentary flush of pity
that followed it, Luella looked at the situation with impatience.
She was "a good sport"&mdash;she couldn't take advantage of Charles
when he was sick.</p>

<p>The question of her liberties had to be postponed until he was
on his feet. Just when she had determined to be a wife no longer,
Luella was compelled to be a nurse as well. She sat beside his bed
while he talked about her in his delirium&mdash;about the days of
their engagement, and how some friend had told him then that he was
making a mistake, and about his happiness in the early months of
their marriage, and his growing disquiet as the gap appeared.
Evidently he had been more aware of it than she had
thought&mdash;more than he ever said.</p>

<p>"Luella!" He would lurch up in bed. "Luella! Where are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm right here, Charles, beside you." She tried to make her
voice cheerful and warm.</p>

<p>"If you want to go, Luella, you'd better go. I don't seem to be
enough for you any more."</p>

<p>She denied this soothingly.</p>

<p>"I've thought it over, Luella, and I can't ruin my health on
account of you&mdash;" Then quickly, and passionately: "Don't go,
Luella, for God's sake, don't go away and leave me! Promise me you
won't!&mdash;I'll do anything you say if you won't go."</p>

<p>His humility annoyed her most; he was a reserved man, and she
had never guessed at the extent of his devotion before.</p>

<p>"I'm only going for a minute. It's Doctor Moon, your friend,
Charles. He came to-day to see how you were, don't you remember?
And he wants to talk to me before he goes."</p>

<p>"You'll come back?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"In just a little while. There&mdash;lie quiet."</p>

<p>She raised his head and plumped his pillow into freshness. A new
trained nurse would arrive to-morrow.</p>

<p>In the living-room Doctor Moon was waiting&mdash;his suit more
worn and shabby in the afternoon light. She disliked him
inordinately, with an illogical conviction that he was in some way
to blame for her misfortune, but he was so deeply interested that
she couldn't refuse to see him. She hadn't asked him to consult
with the specialists, though&mdash;a doctor who was so down at the
heel.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hemple." He came forward, holding out his hand, and Luella
touched it, lightly and uneasily.</p>

<p>"You seem well," he said.</p>

<p>"I am well, thank you."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you on the way you've taken hold of things."</p>

<p>"But I haven't taken hold of things at all," she said coldly. "I
do what I have to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's just it." Her impatience mounted rapidly. "I do what I
have to, and nothing more," she continued: "and with no particular
good-will."</p>

<p>Suddenly she opened up to him again, as she had the night of the
Catastrophe&mdash;realizing that she was putting herself on a
footing of intimacy with him, yet unable to restrain her words.</p>

<p>"The house isn't going," she broke out bitterly. "I had to
discharge the servants, and now I've got a woman in by the day. And
the baby has a cold, and I've found out that his nurse doesn't know
her business, and everything's just as messy and terrible as it can
be!"</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me how you found out the nurse didn't
know her business?"</p>

<p>"You find out various unpleasant things when you're forced to
stay around the house."</p>

<p>He nodded, his weary face turning here and there about the
room.</p>

<p>"I feel somewhat encouraged," he said slowly. "As I told you, I
promise nothing; I only do the best I can."</p>

<p>Luella looked up at him, startled.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she protested. "You've done nothing for
me&mdash;nothing at all!"</p>

<p>"Nothing much&mdash;yet," he said heavily. "It takes time, Mrs.
Hemple."</p>

<p>The words were said in a dry monotone that was somehow without
offense, but Luella felt that he had gone too far. She got to her
feet.</p>

<p>"I've met your type before," she said coldly. "For some reason
you seem to think that you have a standing here as the old friend
of the family. But I don't make friends quickly, and I haven't
given you the privilege of being so"&mdash;she wanted to say
"insolent," but the word eluded her&mdash;"so personal with
me."</p>

<p>When the front door had closed behind him, Luella went into the
kitchen to see if the woman understood about the three different
dinners&mdash;one for Charles, one for the baby, and one for
herself. It was hard to do with only a single servant when things
were so complicated. She must try another employment
agency&mdash;this one had begun to sound bored.</p>

<p>To her surprise, she found the cook with hat and coat on,
reading a newspaper at the kitchen table.</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;Luella tried to think of the name&mdash;"why, what's
the matter, Mrs.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Danski is my name."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I won't be able to accommodate you," said Mrs.
Danski. "You see, I'm only a plain cook, and I'm not used to
preparing invalid's food."</p>

<p>"But I've counted on you."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry." She shook her head stubbornly. "I've got my
own health to think of. I'm sure they didn't tell me what kind of a
job it was when I came. And when you asked me to clean out your
husband's room, I knew it was way beyond my powers."</p>

<p>"I won't ask you to clean anything," said Luella desperately.
"If you'll just stay until to-morrow. I can't possibly get anybody
else to-night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Danski smiled politely.</p>

<p>"I got my own children to think of, just like you."</p>

<p>It was on Luella's tongue to offer her more money, but suddenly
her temper gave way.</p>

<p>"I've never heard of anything so selfish in my life!" she broke
out. "To leave me at a time like this! You're an old fool!"</p>

<p>"If you'd pay me for my time, I'd go," said Mrs. Danski
calmly.</p>

<p>"I won't pay you a cent unless you'll stay!"</p>

<p>She was immediately sorry she had said this, but she was too
proud to withdraw the threat.</p>

<p>"You will so pay me!"</p>

<p>"You go out that door!"</p>

<p>"I'll go when I get my money," asserted Mrs. Danski indignantly.
"I got my children to think of."</p>

<p>Luella drew in her breath sharply, and took a step forward.
Intimidated by her intensity, Mrs. Danski turned and flounced,
muttering, out of the door.</p>

<p>Luella went to the phone and, calling up the agency, explained
that the woman had left.</p>

<p>"Can you send me some one right away? My husband is sick and the
baby's sick&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Hemple; there's no one in the office now. It's
after four o'clock."</p>

<p>Luella argued for a while. Finally she obtained a promise that
they would telephone to an emergency: woman they knew. That was the
best they could do until to-morrow.</p>

<p>She called several other agencies, but the servant industry had
apparently ceased to function for the day. After giving Charles his
medicine, she tiptoed softly into the nursery.</p>

<p>"How's baby?" she asked abstractedly.</p>

<p>"Ninety-nine one," whispered the nurse, holding the thermometer
to the light. "I just took it."</p>

<p>"Is that much?" asked Luella, frowning.</p>

<p>"It's just three-fifths of a degree. That isn't so much for the
afternoon. They often run up a little with a cold."</p>

<p>Luella went over to the cot and laid her hand on her son's
flushed cheek, thinking, in the midst of her anxiety, how much he
resembled the incredible cherub of the "Lux" advertisement in the
bus.</p>

<p>She turned to the nurse.</p>

<p>"Do you know how to cook?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I'm not a good cook."</p>

<p>"Well, can you do the baby's food to-night? That old fool has
left, and I can't get anyone, and I don't know what to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can do the baby's food."</p>

<p>"That's all right, then. I'll try to fix something for Mr.
Hemple. Please have your door open so you can hear the bell when
the doctor comes. And let me know."</p>

<p>So many doctors! There had scarcely been an hour all day when
there wasn't a doctor in the house. The specialist and their family
physician every morning, then the baby doctor&mdash;and this
afternoon there had been Doctor Moon, placid, persistent,
unwelcome, in the parlor. Luella went into the kitchen. She could
cook bacon and eggs for herself&mdash;she had often done that after
the theatre. But the vegetables for Charles were a different
matter&mdash;they must be left to boil or stew or something, and
the stove had so many doors and ovens that she couldn't decide
which to use. She chose a blue pan that looked new, sliced carrots
into it, and covered them with a little water. As she put it on the
stove and tried to remember what to do next, the phone rang. It was
the agency.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is Mrs. Hemple speaking."</p>

<p>"Why, the woman we sent to you has returned here with the claim
that you refused to pay her for her time."</p>

<p>"I explained to you that she refused to stay," said Luella
hotly. "She didn't keep her agreement, and I didn't feel I was
under any obligation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have to see that our people are paid," the agency informed
her; "otherwise we wouldn't be helping them at all, would we? I'm
sorry, Mrs. Hemple, but we won't be able to furnish you with any
one else until this little matter is arranged."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll pay, I'll pay!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Of course we like to keep on good terms with our
clients&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes!"</p>

<p>"So if you'll send her money around to-morrow? It's seventy-five
cents an hour."</p>

<p>"But how about to-night?" she exclaimed. "I've got to have some
one to-night."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;it's pretty late now. I was just going home
myself."</p>

<p>"But I'm Mrs. Charles Hemple! Don't you understand? I'm
perfectly good for what I say I'll do. I'm the wife of Charles
Hemple, of 14 Broadway&mdash;"</p>

<p>Simultaneously she realized that Charles Hemple of 14 Broadway
was a helpless invalid&mdash;he was neither a reference nor a
refuge any more. In despair at the sudden callousness of the world,
she hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>After another ten minutes of frantic muddling in the kitchen,
she went to the baby's nurse, whom she disliked, and confessed that
she was unable to cook her husband's dinner. The nurse announced
that she had a splitting headache, and that with a sick child her
hands were full already, but she consented, without enthusiasm, to
show Luella what to do.</p>

<p>Swallowing her humiliation, Luella obeyed orders while the nurse
experimented, grumbling, with the unfamiliar stove. Dinner was
started after a fashion. Then it was time for the nurse to bathe
Chuck, and Luella sat down alone at the kitchen table, and listened
to the bubbling perfume that escaped from the pans.</p>

<p>"And women do this every day," she thought. "Thousands of women.
Cook and take care of sick people&mdash;and go out to work
too."</p>

<p>But she didn't think of those women as being like her, except in
the superficial aspect of having two feet and two hands. She said
it as she might have said "South Sea Islanders wear nose-rings."
She was merely slumming to-day in her own home, and she wasn't
enjoying it. For her, it was merely a ridiculous exception.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware of slow approaching steps in the
dining-room and then in the butler's pantry. Half afraid that it
was doctor Moon coming to pay another call, she looked up&mdash;and
saw the nurse coming through the pantry door. It flashed through
Luella's mind that the nurse was going to be sick too. And she was
right&mdash;the nurse had hardly reached the kitchen door when she
lurched and clutched at the handle as a winged bird clings to a
branch. Then she receded wordlessly to the floor. Simultaneously
the door-bell rang; and Luella, getting to her feet, gasped with
relief that the baby doctor had come.</p>

<p>"Fainted, that's all," he said, taking the girl's head into his
lap. The eyes fluttered. "Yep, she fainted, that's all."</p>

<p>"Everybody's sick!" cried Luella with a sort of despairing
humor. "Everybody's sick but me, doctor."</p>

<p>"This one's not sick," he said after a moment. "Her heart is
normal already. She just fainted."</p>

<p>When she had helped the doctor raise the quickening body to a
chair, Luella hurried into the nursery and bent over the baby's
bed. She let down one of the iron sides quietly. The fever seemed
to be gone now&mdash;the flush had faded away. She bent over to
touch the small cheek.</p>

<p>Suddenly Luella began to scream.</p>

<p align="center"><b>IV.</b>
</p>

<p>Even after her baby's funeral, Luella still couldn't believe
that she had lost him. She came back to the apartment and walked
around the nursery in a circle, saying his name. Then, frightened
by grief, she sat down and stared at his white rocker with the red
chicken painted on the side.</p>

<p>"What will become of me now?" she whispered to herself.
"Something awful is going to happen to me when I realize that I'll
never see Chuck any more!"</p>

<p>She wasn't sure yet. If she waited here till twilight, the nurse
might still bring him in from his walk. She remembered a tragic
confusion in the midst of which some one had told her that Chuck
was dead, but if that was so, then why was his room waiting, with
his small brush and comb still on the bureau, and why was she here
at all?</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hemple."</p>

<p>She looked up. The weary, shabby figure of Doctor Moon stood in
the door.</p>

<p>"You go away," Luella said dully. "Your husband needs you."</p>

<p>"I don't care." Doctor Moon came a little way into the room. "I
don't think you understand, Mrs. Hemple. He's been calling for you.
You haven't any one now except him."</p>

<p>"I hate you," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>"If you like. I promised nothing, you know. I do the best I can.
You'll be better when you realize that your baby is gone, that
you're not going to see him any more."</p>

<p>Luella sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"My baby isn't dead!" she cried. "You lie! You always lie!" Her
flashing eyes looked into his and caught something there, at once
brutal and kind, that awed her and made her impotent and
acquiescent. She lowered her own eyes in tired despair.</p>

<p>"All right," she said wearily. "My baby is gone. What shall I do
now?"</p>

<p>"Your husband is much better. All he needs is rest and kindness.
But you must go to him and tell him what's happened."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think you made him better," said Luella
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. He's nearly well."</p>

<p>Nearly well&mdash;then the last link that held her to her home
was broken. This part of her life was over&mdash;she could cut it
off here, with its grief and oppression, and be off now, free as
the wind.</p>

<p>"I'll go to him in a minute," Luella said in a far-away voice.
"Please leave me alone."</p>

<p>Doctor Moon's unwelcome shadow melted into the darkness of the
hall.</p>

<p>"I can go away," Luella whispered to herself. "Life has given me
back freedom, in place of what it took away from me."</p>

<p>But she mustn't linger even a minute, or Life would bind her
again and make her suffer once more. She called the apartment
porter and asked that her trunk be brought up from the storeroom.
Then she began taking things from the bureau and wardrobe, trying
to approximate as nearly as possible the possessions that she had
brought to her married life. She even found two old dresses that
had formed part of her trousseau&mdash;out of style now, and a
little tight in the hip&mdash;which she threw in with the rest. A
new life. Charles was well again; and her baby, whom she had
worshipped, and who had bored her a little, was dead.</p>

<p>When she had packed her trunk, she went into the kitchen
automatically, to see about the preparations for dinner. She spoke
to the cook about the special things for Charles and said that she
herself was dining out. The sight of one of the small pans that had
been used to cook Chuck's food caught her attention for a
moment&mdash;but she stared at it unmoved. She looked into the
ice-box and saw it was clean and fresh inside. Then she went into
Charles's room. He was sitting up in bed, and the nurse was reading
to him. His hair was almost white now, silvery white, and
underneath it his eyes were huge and dark in his thin young
face.</p>

<p>"The baby is sick?" he asked in his own natural voice.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>He hesitated, closing his eyes for a moment. Then he asked:</p>

<p>"The baby is dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>For a long time he didn't speak. The nurse came over and put her
hand on his forehead. Two large, strange tears welled from his
eyes.</p>

<p>"I knew the baby was dead."</p>

<p>After another long wait, the nurse spoke:</p>

<p>"The doctor said he could be taken out for a drive to-day while
there was still sunshine. He needs a little change."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought"&mdash;the nurse hesitated&mdash;"I thought perhaps
it would do you both good, Mrs. Hemple, if you took him instead of
me."</p>

<p>Luella shook her head hastily.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said. "I don't feel able to, to-day."</p>

<p>The nurse looked at her oddly. With a sudden feeling of pity for
Charles, Luella bent down gently and kissed his cheek. Then,
without a word, she went to her own room, put on her hat and coat,
and with her suitcase started for the front door.</p>

<p>Immediately she saw that there was a shadow in the hall. If she
could get past that shadow, she was free. If she could go to the
right or left of it, or order it out of her way! But, stubbornly,
it refused to move, and with a little cry she sank down into a hall
chair.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd gone," she wailed. "I told you to go away."</p>

<p>"I'm going soon," said Doctor Moon, "but I don't want you to
make an old mistake."</p>

<p>"I'm not making a mistake&mdash;I'm leaving my mistakes
behind."</p>

<p>"You're trying to leave yourself behind, but you can't. The more
you try to run away from yourself, the more you'll have yourself
with you."</p>

<p>"But I've got to go away," she insisted wildly. "Out of this
house of death and failure!"</p>

<p>"You haven't failed yet. You've only begun."</p>

<p>She stood up.</p>

<p>"Let me pass."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Abruptly she gave way, as she always did when he talked to her.
She covered her face with her hands and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Go back into that room and tell the nurse you'll take your
husband for a drive," he suggested.</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>Once more Luella looked at him, and knew that she would obey.
With the conviction that her spirit was broken at last, she took up
her suitcase and walked back through the hall.</p>

<p align="center"><b>V.</b>
</p>

<p>The nature of the curious influence that Doctor Moon exerted
upon her, Louella could not guess. But as the days passed, she
found herself doing many things that had been repugnant to her
before. She stayed at home with Charles; and when he grew better,
she went out with him sometimes to dinner, or the theatre, but only
when he expressed a wish. She visited the kitchen every day, and
kept an unwilling eye on the house, at first with a horror that it
would go wrong again, then from habit. And she felt that it was all
somehow mixed up with Doctor Moon&mdash;it was something he kept
telling her about life, or almost telling her, and yet concealing
from her, as though he were afraid to have her know.</p>

<p>With the resumption of their normal life, she found that Charles
was less nervous. His habit of rubbing his face had left him, and
if the world seemed less gay and happy to her than it had before,
she experienced a certain peace, sometimes, that she had never
known.</p>

<p>Then, one afternoon, Doctor Moon told her suddenly that he was
going away.</p>

<p>"Do you mean for good?" she demanded with a touch of panic.</p>

<p>"For good."</p>

<p>For a strange moment she wasn't sure whether she was sorry.</p>

<p>"You don't need me any more," he said quietly. "You don't
realize it, but you've grown up."</p>

<p>He came over and, sitting on the couch beside her, took her
hand. Luella sat silent and tense&mdash;listening.</p>

<p>"We make an agreement with children that they can sit in the
audience without helping to make the play," he said, "but if they
still sit in the audience after they're grown, somebody's got to
work double time for them, so that they can enjoy the light and
glitter of the world."</p>

<p>"But I want the light and glitter," she protested. "That's all
there is in life. There can't be anything wrong in wanting to have
things warm."</p>

<p>"Things will still be warm."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Things will warm themselves from you."</p>

<p>Luella looked at him, startled.</p>

<p>"It's your turn to be the centre, to give others what was given
to you for so long. You've got to give security to young people and
peace to your husband, and a sort of charity to the old. You've got
to let the people who work for you depend on you. You've got to
cover up a few more troubles than you show, and be a little more
patient than the average person, and do a little more instead of a
little less than your share. The light and glitter of the world is
in your hands."</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly.</p>

<p>"Get up," he said, "and go to that mirror and tell me what you
see."</p>

<p>Obediently Luella got up and went close to a purchase of her
honeymoon, a Venetian pier-glass on the wall.</p>

<p>"I see new lines in my face here," she said, raising her finger
and placing it between her eyes, "and a few shadows at the sides
that might be&mdash;that are little wrinkles."</p>

<p>"Do you care?"</p>

<p>She turned quickly. "No," she said.</p>

<p>"Do you realize that Chuck is gone? That you'll never see him
any more?"</p>

<p>"Yes." She passed her hands slowly over her eyes. "But that all
seems so vague and far away."</p>

<p>"Vague and far away," he repeated; and then: "And are you afraid
of me now?"</p>

<p>"Not any longer," she said, and she added frankly, "now that
you're going away."</p>

<p>He moved toward the door. He seemed particularly weary to-night,
as though he could hardly move about at all.</p>

<p>"The household here is in your keeping," he said in a tired
whisper. "If there is any light and warmth in it, it will be your
light and warmth; if it is happy, it will be because you've made it
so. Happy things may come to you in life, but you must never go
seeking them any more. It is your turn to make the fire."</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down a moment longer?" Luella ventured.</p>

<p>"There isn't time." His voice was so low now that she could
scarcely hear the words. "But remember that whatever suffering
comes to you, I can always help you&mdash;if it is something that
can be helped. I promise nothing."</p>

<p>He opened the door. She must find out now what she most wanted
to know, before it was too late.</p>

<p>"What have you done to me?" she cried. "Why have I no sorrow
left for Chuck&mdash;for anything at all? Tell me, I almost see,
yet I can't see. Before you go&mdash;tell me who you are!"</p>

<p>"Who am I?&mdash;"</p>

<p>His worn suit paused in the doorway. His round, pale face seemed
to dissolve into two faces, a dozen faces, a score, each one
different yet the same&mdash;sad, happy, tragic, indifferent,
resigned&mdash;until threescore Doctor Moons were ranged like an
infinite series of reflections, like months stretching into the
vista of the past.</p>

<p>"Who am I?" he repeated; "I am five years."</p>

<p>The door closed.</p>

<hr>

<p>At six o'clock Charles Hemple came home, and as usual Luella met
him in the hall. Except that now his hair was dead white, his long
illness of two years had left no mark upon him. Luella herself was
more noticeably changed&mdash;she was a little stouter, and there
were those lines around her eyes that had come when Chuck died one
evening back in 1921. But she was still lovely, and there was a
mature kindness about her face at twenty-eight, as if suffering had
touched her only reluctantly and then hurried away.</p>

<p>"Ede and her husband are coming to dinner," she said. "I've got
theatre tickets, but if you're tired, I don't care whether we go or
not."</p>

<p>"I'd like to go."</p>

<p>She looked at him. "You wouldn't."</p>

<p>"I really would."</p>

<p>"We'll see how you feel after dinner."</p>

<p>He put his arm around her waist. Together they walked into the
nursery where the two children were waiting up to say good
night.</p>
