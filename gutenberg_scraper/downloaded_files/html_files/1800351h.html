<h3>This story appeared in <i>All the Sad Young Men</i> (1926)<br>
a collection of short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald</h3>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>I.</b></p>

<p>One day when the young Mathers had been married for about a
year, Jaqueline walked into the rooms of the hardware brokerage
which her husband carried on with more than average success. At the
open door of the inner office she stopped and said: "Oh, excuse
me&mdash;" She had interrupted an apparently trivial yet somehow
intriguing scene. A young man named Bronson whom she knew slightly
was standing with her husband; the latter had risen from his desk.
Bronson seized her husband's hand and shook it
earnestly&mdash;something more than earnestly. When they heard
Jaqueline's step in the doorway both men turned and Jaqueline saw
that Bronson's eyes were red.</p>

<p>A moment later he came out, passing her with a somewhat
embarrassed "How do you do?" She walked into her husband's
office.</p>

<p>"What was Ed Bronson doing here?" she demanded curiously, and at
once.</p>

<p>Jim Mather smiled at her, half shutting his gray eyes, and drew
her quietly to a sitting position on his desk.</p>

<p>"He just dropped in for a minute," he answered easily. "How's
everything at home?"</p>

<p>"All right." She looked at him with curiosity. "What did he
want?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, he just wanted to see me about something."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just something. Business."</p>

<p>"Why were his eyes red?"</p>

<p>"Were they?" He looked at her innocently, and then suddenly they
both began to laugh. Jaqueline rose and walked around the desk and
plumped down into his swivel chair.</p>

<p>"You might as well tell me," she announced cheerfully, "because
I'm going to stay right here till you do."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" he hesitated, frowning. "He wanted me to do him a
little favor."</p>

<p>Then Jaqueline understood, or rather her mind leaped half
accidentally to the truth.</p>

<p>"Oh." Her voice tightened a little. "You've been lending him
some money."</p>

<p>"Only a little."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Only three hundred."</p>

<p>"<i>Only</i> three hundred." The voice was of the texture of
Bessemer cooled. "How much do we spend a month, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, about five or six hundred, I guess." He shifted
uneasily. "Listen, Jack. Bronson'll pay that back. He's in a little
trouble. He's made a mistake about a girl out in
Woodmere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he knows you're famous for being an easy mark, so he comes
to you," interrupted Jaqueline.</p>

<p>"No." He denied this formally.</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose I could use that three hundred dollars?" she
demanded. "How about that trip to New York we couldn't afford last
November?"</p>

<p>The lingering smile faded from Mather's face. He went over and
shut the door to the outer office.</p>

<p>"Listen, Jack," he began, "you don't understand this. Bronson's
one of the men I eat lunch with almost every day. We used to play
together when we were kids, we went to school together. Don't you
see that I'm just the person he'd be right to come to in trouble?
And that's just why I couldn't refuse."</p>

<p>Jaqueline gave her shoulders a twist as if to shake off this
reasoning.</p>

<p>"Well," she answered decidedly, "all I know is that he's no
good. He's always lit and if he doesn't choose to work he has no
business living off the work you do."</p>

<p>They were sitting now on either side of the desk, each having
adopted the attitude of one talking to a child. They began their
sentences with "Listen!" and their faces wore expressions of rather
tried patience.</p>

<p>"If you can't understand, I can't tell you," Mather concluded,
at the end of fifteen minutes, on what was, for him, an irritated
key. "Such obligations do happen to exist sometimes among men and
they have to be met. It's more complicated than just refusing to
lend money, especially in a business like mine where so much
depends on the good-will of men down-town."</p>

<p>Mather was putting on his coat as he said this. He was going
home with her on the street-car to lunch. They were between
automobiles&mdash;they had sold their old one and were going to get
a new one in the spring.</p>

<p>Now the street-car, on this particular day, was distinctly
unfortunate. The argument in the office might have been forgotten
under other circumstances, but what followed irritated the scratch
until it became a serious temperamental infection.</p>

<p>They found a seat near the front of the car. It was late
February and an eager, unpunctilious sun was turning the scrawny
street snow into dirty, cheerful rivulets that echoed in the
gutters. Because of this the car was less full than
usual&mdash;there was no one standing. The motorman had even opened
his window and a yellow breeze was blowing the late breath of
winter from the car.</p>

<p>It occurred pleasurably to Jaqueline that her husband sitting
beside her was handsome and kind above other men. It was silly to
try to change him. Perhaps Bronson might return the money after
all, and anyhow three hundred dollars wasn't a fortune. Of course
he had no business doing it&mdash;but then&mdash;</p>

<p>Her musings were interrupted as an eddy of passengers pushed up
the aisle. Jaqueline wished they'd put their hands over their
mouths when they coughed, and she hoped that Jim would get a new
machine pretty soon. You couldn't tell what disease you'd run into
in these trolleys.</p>

<p>She turned to Jim to discuss the subject&mdash;but Jim had stood
up and was offering his seat to a woman who had been standing
beside him in the aisle. The woman, without so much as a grunt, sat
down. Jaqueline frowned.</p>

<p>The woman was about fifty and enormous. When she first sat down
she was content merely to fill the unoccupied part of the seat, but
after a moment she began to expand and to spread her great rolls of
fat over a larger and larger area until the process took on the
aspect of violent trespassing. When the car rocked in Jaqueline's
direction the woman slid with it, but when it rocked back she
managed by some exercise of ingenuity to dig in and hold the ground
won.</p>

<p>Jaqueline caught her husband's eye&mdash;he was swaying on a
strap&mdash;and in an angry glance conveyed to him her entire
disapproval of his action. He apologized mutely and became urgently
engrossed in a row of car cards. The fat woman moved once more
against Jaqueline&mdash;she was now practically overlapping her.
Then she turned puffy, disagreeable eyes full on Mrs. James Mather,
and coughed rousingly in her face.</p>

<p>With a smothered exclamation Jaqueline got to her feet, squeezed
with brisk violence past the fleshy knees, and made her way, pink
with rage, toward the rear of the car. There she seized a strap,
and there she was presently joined by her husband in a state of
considerable alarm.</p>

<p>They exchanged no word, but stood silently side by side for ten
minutes while a row of men sitting in front of them crackled their
newspapers and kept their eyes fixed virtuously upon the day's
cartoons.</p>

<p>When they left the car at last Jaqueline exploded.</p>

<p>"You big <i>fool</i>!" she cried wildly. "Did you see that
horrible woman you gave your seat to? Why don't you consider
<i>me</i> occasionally instead of every fat selfish washwoman you
meet?"</p>

<p>"How should I know&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Jaqueline was as angry at him as she had ever been&mdash;it
was unusual for any one to get angry at him.</p>

<p>"You didn't see any of those men getting up for <i>me</i>, did
you? No wonder you were too tired to go out last Monday night.
You'd probably given your seat to some&mdash;to some horrible,
Polish <i>wash</i> woman that's strong as an ox and <i>likes</i> to
stand up!"</p>

<p>They were walking along the slushy street stepping wildly into
great pools of water. Confused and distressed, Mather could utter
neither apology nor defense.</p>

<p>Jaqueline broke off and then turned to him with a curious light
in her eyes. The words in which she couched her summary of the
situation were probably the most disagreeable that had ever been
addressed to him in his life.</p>

<p>"The trouble with you, Jim, the reason you're such an easy mark,
is that you've got the ideas of a college freshman&mdash;you're a
professional nice fellow."</p>

<p align="center"><b>II.</b></p>

<p>The incident and the unpleasantness were forgotten. Mather's
vast good nature had smoothed over the roughness within an hour.
References to it fell with a dying cadence throughout several
days&mdash;then ceased and tumbled into the limbo of oblivion. I
say "limbo," for oblivion is, unfortunately, never quite oblivious.
The subject was drowned out by the fact that Jaqueline with her
customary spirit and coolness began the long, arduous, up-hill
business of bearing a child. Her natural traits and prejudices
became intensified and she was less inclined to let things
pass.</p>

<p>It was April now, and as yet they had not bought a car. Mather
had discovered that he was saving practically nothing and that in
another half-year he would have a family on his hands. It worried
him. A wrinkle&mdash;small, tentative, undisturbing&mdash;appeared
for the first time as a shadow around his honest, friendly eyes. He
worked far into the spring twilight now, and frequently brought
home with him the overflow from his office day. The new car would
have to be postponed for a while.</p>

<p>April afternoon, and all the city shopping on Washington Street.
Jaqueline walked slowly past the shops, brooding without fear or
depression on the shape into which her life was now being
arbitrarily forced. Dry summer dust was in the wind; the sun
bounded cheerily from the plate-glass windows and made radiant
gasoline rainbows where automobile drippings had formed pools on
the street.</p>

<p>Jaqueline stopped. Not six feet from her a bright new sport
roadster was parked at the curb. Beside it stood two men in
conversation, and at the moment when she identified one of them as
young Bronson she heard him say to the other in a casual tone:</p>

<p>"What do you think of it? Just got it this morning."</p>

<p>Jaqueline turned abruptly and walked with quick tapping steps to
her husband's office. With her usual curt nod to the stenographer
she strode by her to the inner room. Mather looked up from his desk
in surprise at her brusque entry.</p>

<p>"Jim," she began breathlessly, "did Bronson ever pay you that
three hundred?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no," he answered hesitantly, "not yet. He was in here
last week and he explained that he was a little bit hard up."</p>

<p>Her eyes gleamed with angry triumph.</p>

<p>"Oh, he did?" she snapped. "Well, he's just bought a new sport
roadster that must have cost anyhow twenty-five hundred
dollars."</p>

<p>He shook his head, unbelieving.</p>

<p>"I saw it," she insisted. "I heard him say he'd just bought
it."</p>

<p>"He <i>told</i> me he was hard up," repeated Mather
helplessly.</p>

<p>Jaqueline audibly gave up by heaving a profound noise, a sort of
groanish sigh.</p>

<p>"He was <i>using you</i>! He knew you were easy and he was
<i>using</i> you. Can't you see? He wanted <i>you</i> to buy him
the car and you <i>did</i>!" She laughed bitterly. "He's probably
roaring his sides out to think how easily he worked you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," protested Mather with a shocked expression, "you must
have mistaken somebody for him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We walk&mdash;and he rides on our money," she interrupted
excitedly. "Oh, it's rich&mdash;it's rich. If it wasn't so
maddening, it'd be just absurd. Look here&mdash;!" Her voice grew
sharper, more restrained&mdash;there was a touch of contempt in it
now. "You spend half your time doing things for people who don't
give a damn about you or what becomes of you. You give up your seat
on the street-car to <i>hogs</i>, and come home too dead tired to
even <i>move</i>. You're on all sorts of committees that take at
least an hour a day out of your business and you don't get a cent
out of them. You're&mdash;eternally&mdash;being <i>used</i>! I
won't stand it! I thought I married a man&mdash;not a professional
Samaritan who's going to fetch and carry for the world!"</p>

<p>As she finished her invective Jaqueline reeled suddenly and sank
into a chair&mdash;nervously exhausted.</p>

<p>"Just at this time," she went on brokenly, "I need you. I need
your strength and your health and your arms around me. And if
you&mdash;if you just give it to <i>every</i> one, it's spread
<i>so</i> thin when it reaches me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He knelt by her side, moving her tired young head until it lay
against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Jaqueline," he said humbly, "I'll be more careful. I
didn't realize what I was doing."</p>

<p>"You're the dearest person in the world," murmured Jaqueline
huskily, "but I want all of you and the best of you for me."</p>

<p>He smoothed her hair over and over. For a few minutes they
rested there silently, having attained a sort of Nirvana of peace
and understanding. Then Jaqueline reluctantly raised her head as
they were interrupted by the voice of Miss Clancy in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"A boy's here with some boxes. It's C. O. D."</p>

<p>Mather rose and followed Miss Clancy into the outer office.</p>

<p>"It's fifty dollars."</p>

<p>He searched his wallet&mdash;he had omitted to go to the bank
that morning.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," he said abstractedly. His mind was on
Jaqueline, Jaqueline who seemed forlorn in her trouble, waiting for
him in the other room. He walked into the corridor, and opening the
door of "Clayton and Drake, Brokers" across the way, swung wide a
low gate and went up to a man seated at a desk.</p>

<p>"Morning, Fred," said Mather.</p>

<p>Drake, a little man of thirty with pince-nez and bald head, rose
and shook hands.</p>

<p>"Morning, Jim. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Why, a boy's in my office with some stuff C. O. D. and I
haven't a cent. Can you let me have fifty till this afternoon?"</p>

<p>Drake looked closely at Mather. Then, slowly and startlingly, he
shook his head&mdash;not up and down but from side to side.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Jim," he answered stiffly, "I've made a rule never to
make a personal loan to anybody on any conditions. I've seen it
break up too many friendships."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Mather had come out of his abstraction now, and the monosyllable
held an undisguised quality of shock. Then his natural tact acted
automatically, springing to his aid and dictating his words though
his brain was suddenly numb. His immediate instinct was to put
Drake at ease in his refusal.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see." He nodded his head as if in full agreement, as if
he himself had often considered adopting just such a rule. "Oh, I
see how you feel. Well&mdash;I just&mdash;I wouldn't have you break
a rule like that for anything. It's probably a good thing."</p>

<p>They talked for a minute longer. Drake justified his position
easily; he had evidently rehearsed the part a great deal. He
treated Mather to an exquisitely frank smile.</p>

<p>Mather went politely back to his office leaving Drake under the
impression that the latter was the most tactful man in the city.
Mather knew how to leave people with that impression. But when he
entered his own office and saw his wife staring dismally out the
window into the sunshine he clinched his hands, and his mouth moved
in an unfamiliar shape.</p>

<p>"All right, Jack," he said slowly, "I guess you're right about
most things, and I'm wrong as hell."</p>

<p align="center"><b>III.</b></p>

<p>During the next three months Mather thought back through many
years. He had had an unusually happy life. Those frictions between
man and man, between man and society, which harden most of us into
a rough and cynical quarrelling trim, had been conspicuous by their
infrequency in his life. It had never occurred to him before that
he had paid a price for this immunity, but now he perceived how
here and there, and constantly, he had taken the rough side of the
road to avoid enmity or argument, or even question.</p>

<p>There was, for instance, much money that he had lent privately,
about thirteen hundred dollars in all, which he realized, in his
new enlightenment, he would never see again. It had taken
Jaqueline's harder, feminine intelligence to know this. It was only
now when he owed it to Jaqueline to have money in the bank that he
missed these loans at all.</p>

<p>He realized too the truth of her assertions that he was
continually doing favors&mdash;a little something here, a little
something there; the sum total, in time and energy expended, was
appalling. It had pleased him to do the favors. He reacted warmly
to being thought well of, but he wondered now if he had not been
merely indulging a selfish vanity of his own. In suspecting this,
he was, as usual, not quite fair to himself. The truth was that
Mather was essentially and enormously romantic.</p>

<p>He decided that these expenditures of himself made him tired at
night, less efficient in his work, and less of a prop to Jaqueline,
who, as the months passed, grew more heavy and bored, and sat
through the long summer afternoons on the screened veranda waiting
for his step at the end of the walk.</p>

<p>Lest that step falter, Mather gave up many things&mdash;among
them the presidency of his college alumni association. He let slip
other labors less prized. When he was put on a committee, men had a
habit of electing him chairman and retiring into a dim background,
where they were inconveniently hard to find. He was done with such
things now. Also he avoided those who were prone to ask
favors&mdash;fleeing a certain eager look that would be turned on
him from some group at his club.</p>

<p>The change in him came slowly. He was not exceptionally
unworldly&mdash;under other circumstances Drake's refusal of money
would not have surprised him. Had it come to him as a story he
would scarcely have given it a thought. But it had broken in with
harsh abruptness upon a situation existing in his own mind, and the
shock had given it a powerful and literal significance.</p>

<p>It was mid-August now, and the last of a baking week. The
curtains of his wide-open office windows had scarcely rippled all
the day, but lay like sails becalmed in warm juxtaposition with the
smothering screens. Mather was worried&mdash;Jaqueline had
over-tired herself, and was paying for it by violent sick
headaches, and business seemed to have come to an apathetic
standstill. That morning he had been so irritable with Miss Clancy
that she had looked at him in surprise. He had immediately
apologized, wishing afterward that he hadn't. He was working at
high speed through this heat&mdash;why shouldn't she?</p>

<p>She came to his door now, and he looked up faintly frowning.</p>

<p>"Mr. Edward Lacy."</p>

<p>"All right," he answered listlessly. Old man Lacy&mdash;he knew
him slightly. A melancholy figure&mdash;a brilliant start back in
the eighties, and now one of the city's failures. He couldn't
imagine what Lacy wanted unless he were soliciting.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Mather."</p>

<p>A little, solemn, gray-haired man stood on the threshold. Mather
rose and greeted him politely.</p>

<p>"Are you busy, Mr. Mather?"</p>

<p>"Well, not so <i>very</i>." He stressed the qualifying word
slightly.</p>

<p>Mr. Lacy sat down, obviously ill at ease. He kept his hat in his
hands, and clung to it tightly as he began to speak.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mather, if you've got five minutes to spare, I'm going to
tell you something that&mdash;that I find at present it's necessary
for me to tell you."</p>

<p>Mather nodded. His instinct warned him that there was a favor to
be asked, but he was tired, and with a sort of lassitude he let his
chin sink into his hand, welcoming any distraction from his more
immediate cares.</p>

<p>"You see," went on Mr. Lacy&mdash;Mather noticed that the hands
which fingered at the hat were trembling&mdash;"back in eighty-four
your father and I were very good friends. You've heard him speak of
me no doubt."</p>

<p>Mather nodded.</p>

<p>"I was asked to be one of the pallbearers. Once we
were&mdash;very close. It's because of that that I come to you now.
Never before in my life have I ever had to come to any one as I've
come to you now, Mr. Mather&mdash;come to a stranger. But as you
grow older your friends die or move away or some misunderstanding
separates you. And your children die unless you're fortunate enough
to go first&mdash;and pretty soon you get to be alone, so that you
don't have any friends at all. You're isolated." He smiled faintly.
His hands were trembling violently now.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time almost forty years ago your father came to me
and asked me for a thousand dollars. I was a few years older than
he was, and though I knew him only slightly, I had a high opinion
of him. That was a lot of money in those days, and he had no
security&mdash;he had nothing but a plan in his head&mdash;but I
liked the way he had of looking out of his eyes&mdash;you'll pardon
me if I say you look not unlike him&mdash;so I gave it to him
without security."</p>

<p>Mr. Lacy paused.</p>

<p>"Without security," he repeated. "I could afford it then. I
didn't lose by it. He paid it back with interest at six per cent
before the year was up."</p>

<p>Mather was looking down at his blotter, tapping out a series of
triangles with his pencil. He knew what was coming now, and his
muscles physically tightened as he mustered his forces for the
refusal he would have to make.</p>

<p>"I'm now an old man, Mr. Mather," the cracked voice went on.
"I've made a failure&mdash;I <i>am</i> a failure&mdash;only we
needn't go into that now. I have a daughter, an unmarried daughter
who lives with me. She does stenographic work and has been very
kind to me. We live together, you know, on Selby Avenue&mdash;we
have an apartment, quite a nice apartment."</p>

<p>The old man sighed quaveringly. He was trying&mdash;and at the
same time was afraid&mdash;to get to his request. It was insurance,
it seemed. He had a ten-thousand-dollar policy, he had borrowed on
it up to the limit, and he stood to lose the whole amount unless he
could raise four hundred and fifty dollars. He and his daughter had
about seventy-five dollars between them. They had no
friends&mdash;he had explained that&mdash;and they had found it
impossible to raise the money. . . .</p>

<p>Mather could stand the miserable story no longer. He could not
spare the money, but he could at least relieve the old man of the
blistered agony of asking for it.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Lacy," he interrupted as gently as possible,
"but I can't lend you that money."</p>

<p>"No?" The old man looked at him with faded, blinking eyes that
were beyond all shock, almost, it seemed, beyond any human emotion
except ceaseless care. The only change in his expression was that
his mouth dropped slowly ajar.</p>

<p>Mather fixed his eyes determinately upon his blotter.</p>

<p>"We're going to have a baby in a few months, and I've been
saving for that. It wouldn't be fair to my wife to take anything
from her&mdash;or the child&mdash;right now."</p>

<p>His voice sank to a sort of mumble. He found himself saying
platitudinously that business was bad&mdash;saying it with
revolting facility.</p>

<p>Mr. Lacy made no argument. He rose without visible signs of
disappointment. Only his hands were still trembling and they
worried Mather. The old man was apologetic&mdash;he was sorry to
have bothered him at a time like this. Perhaps something would turn
up. He had thought that if Mr. Mather did happen to have a good
deal extra&mdash;why, he might be the person to go to because he
was the son of an old friend.</p>

<p>As he left the office he had trouble opening the outer door.
Miss Clancy helped him. He went shabbily and unhappily down the
corridor with his faded eyes blinking and his mouth still faintly
ajar.</p>

<p>Jim Mather stood by his desk, and put his hand over his face and
shivered suddenly as if he were cold. But the five-o'clock air
outside was hot as a tropic noon.</p>

<p align="center"><b>IV.</b></p>

<p>The twilight was hotter still an hour later as he stood at the
corner waiting for his car. The trolley-ride to his house was
twenty-five minutes, and he bought a pink-jacketed newspaper to
appetize his listless mind. Life had seemed less happy, less
glamourous of late. Perhaps he had learned more of the world's
ways&mdash;perhaps its glamour was evaporating little by little
with the hurried years.</p>

<p>Nothing like this afternoon, for instance, had ever happened to
him before. He could not dismiss the old man from his mind. He
pictured him plodding home in the weary heat&mdash;on foot,
probably, to save carfare&mdash;opening the door of a hot little
flat, and confessing to his daughter that the son of his friend had
not been able to help him out. All evening they would plan
helplessly until they said good night to each other&mdash;father
and daughter, isolated by chance in this world&mdash;and went to
lie awake with a pathetic loneliness in their two beds.</p>

<p>Mather's street-car came along, and he found a seat near the
front, next to an old lady who looked at him grudgingly as she
moved over. At the next block a crowd of girls from the
department-store district flowed up the aisle, and Mather unfolded
his paper. Of late he had not indulged his habit of giving up his
seat. Jaqueline was right&mdash;the average young girl was able to
stand as well as he was. Giving up his seat was silly, a mere
gesture. Nowadays not one woman in a dozen even bothered to thank
him.</p>

<p>It was stifling hot in the car, and he wiped the heavy damp from
his forehead. The aisle was thickly packed now, and a woman
standing beside his seat was thrown momentarily against his
shoulder as the car turned a corner. Mather took a long breath of
the hot foul air, which persistently refused to circulate, and
tried to centre his mind on a cartoon at the top of the sporting
page.</p>

<p>"Move for'ard ina car, please!" The conductor's voice pierced
the opaque column of humanity with raucous irritation. "Plen'y of
room for'ard!"</p>

<p>The crowd made a feeble attempt to shove forward, but the
unfortunate fact that there was no space into which to move
precluded any marked success. The car turned another corner, and
again the woman next to Mather swayed against his shoulder.
Ordinarily he would have given up his seat if only to avoid this
reminder that she was there. It made him feel unpleasantly
cold-blooded. And the car was horrible&mdash;horrible. They ought
to put more of them on the line these sweltering days.</p>

<p>For the fifth time he looked at the pictures in the comic strip.
There was a beggar in the second picture, and the wavering image of
Mr. Lacy persistently inserted itself in the beggar's place. God!
Suppose the old man really did starve to death&mdash;suppose he
threw himself into the river.</p>

<p>"Once," thought Mather, "he helped my father. Perhaps, if he
hadn't, my own life would have been different than it has been. But
Lacy could afford it then&mdash;and I can't."</p>

<p>To force out the picture of Mr. Lacy, Mather tried to think of
Jaqueline. He said to himself over and over that he would have been
sacrificing Jaqueline to a played-out man who had had his chance
and failed. Jaqueline needed her chance now as never before.</p>

<p>Mather looked at his watch. He had been on the car ten minutes.
Fifteen minutes still to ride, and the heat increasing with
breathless intensity. The woman swayed against him once more, and
looking out the window he saw that they were turning the last
down-town corner.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that perhaps he ought, after all, to give the
woman his seat&mdash;her last sway toward him had been a
particularly tired sway. If he were sure she was an older
woman&mdash;but the texture of her dress as it brushed his hand
gave somehow the impression that she was a young girl. He did not
dare look up to see. He was afraid of the appeal that might look
out of her eyes if they were old eyes or the sharp contempt if they
were young.</p>

<p>For the next five minutes his mind worked in a vague suffocated
way on what now seemed to him the enormous problem of whether or
not to give her the seat. He felt dimly that doing so would
partially atone for his refusal to Mr. Lacy that afternoon. It
would be rather terrible to have done those two cold-blooded things
in succession&mdash;and on such a day.</p>

<p>He tried the cartoon again, but in vain. He must concentrate on
Jaqueline. He was dead tired now, and if he stood up he would be
more tired. Jaqueline would be waiting for him, needing him, She
would be depressed and she would want him to hold her quietly in
his arms for an hour after dinner. When he was tired this was
rather a strain. And afterward when they went to bed she would ask
him from time to time to get her her medicine or a glass of
ice-water. He hated to show any weariness in doing these things.
She might notice and, needing something, refrain from asking for
it.</p>

<p>The girl in the aisle swayed against him once more&mdash;this
time it was more like a sag. She was tired, too. Well, it was weary
to work. The ends of many proverbs that had to do with toil and the
long day floated fragmentarily through his mind. Everybody in the
world was tired&mdash;this woman, for instance, whose body was
sagging so wearily, so strangely against his. But his home came
first and his girl that he loved was waiting for him there. He must
keep his strength for her, and he said to himself over and over
that he would not give up his seat.</p>

<p>Then he heard a long sigh, followed by a sudden exclamation, and
he realized that the girl was no longer leaning against him. The
exclamation multiplied into a clatter of voices&mdash;then came a
pause&mdash;then a renewed clatter that travelled down the car in
calls and little staccato cries to the conductor. The bell clanged
violently, and the hot car jolted to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>"Girl fainted up here!"</p>

<p>"Too hot for her!"</p>

<p>"Just keeled right over!"</p>

<p>"Get back there! Gangway, you!"</p>

<p>The crowd eddied apart. The passengers in front squeezed back
and those on the rear platform temporarily disembarked. Curiosity
and pity bubbled out of suddenly conversing groups. People tried to
help, got in the way. Then the bell rang and voices rose stridently
again.</p>

<p>"Get her out all right?"</p>

<p>"Say, did you see that?"</p>

<p>"This damn' company ought to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you see the man that carried her out? He was pale as a
ghost, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, but did you hear&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That fella. That pale fella that carried her out. He was
sittin' beside her&mdash;he says she's his wife!"</p>

<hr>

<p>The house was quiet. A breeze pressed back the dark vine leaves
of the veranda, letting in thin yellow rods of moonlight on the
wicker chairs. Jaqueline rested placidly on the long settee with
her head in his arms. After a while she stirred lazily; her hand
reaching up patted his cheek.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go to bed now. I'm so tired. Will you help me
up?"</p>

<p>He lifted her and then laid her back among the pillows.</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in a minute," he said gently. "Can you wait
for just a minute?"</p>

<p>He passed into the lighted living-room, and she heard him
thumbing the pages of a telephone directory; then she listened as
he called a number.</p>

<p>"Hello, is Mr. Lacy there? Why&mdash;yes, it <i>is</i> pretty
important&mdash;if he hasn't gone to sleep."</p>

<p>A pause. Jaqueline could hear restless sparrows splattering
through the leaves of the magnolia over the way. Then her husband
at the telephone:</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Lacy? Oh, this is Mather. Why&mdash;why, in regard
to that matter we talked about this afternoon, I think I'll be able
to fix that up after all." He raised his voice a little as though
some one at the other end found it difficult to hear. "James
Mather's son, I said&mdash;About that little matter this
afternoon&mdash;"</p>
