<p class="cpb">I.</p>

<p>It is difficult for young people to live things down. We will
tolerate vice, grand larceny and the quieter forms of murder in our
contemporaries, because we are so strong and incorruptible
ourselves, but our children's friends must show a blank service
record. When young Josephine Perry was "removed" by her father from
the Brereton School, where she had accidentally embraced a young
man in the chapel, some of the best people in Chicago would have
liked to have seen her drawn and quartered. But the Perrys were
rich and powerful, so that friends rallied to their daughter's
reputation&mdash;and Josephine's lovely face with its expression of
just having led the children from a burning orphan asylum did the
rest.</p>

<p>Certainly there was no consciousness of disgrace in it when she
entered the grand stand at Lake Forest on the first day of the
tennis tournament. Same old crowd, she seemed to say, turning,
without any curiosity, half left, half right&mdash;not that I
object, but you can't expect me to get excited.</p>

<p>It was a bright day, with the sun glittering on the crowd; the
white figures on the courts threw no shadow. Over in Europe the
bloody terror of the Somme was just beginning, but the war had
become second-page news and the question agitating the crowd was
who would win the tournament. Dresses were long and hats were small
and tight, and America, shut in on itself, was bored beyond
belief.</p>

<p>Josephine, representing in her own person the future, was not
bored; she was merely impatient for a change. She gazed about until
she found friends; they waved and she joined them. Only as she sat
down did she realize that she was also next to a lady whose lips,
in continual process of masking buck teeth, gave her a deceptively
pleasant expression. Mrs. McRae belonged to the
drawing-and-quartering party. She hated young people, and by some
perverse instinct was drawn into contact with them, as organizer of
the midsummer vaudeville at Lake Forest and of dancing classes in
Chicago during the winter. She chose rich, plain girls and brought
them along, bullying boys into dancing with them and comparing them
to their advantage with the more popular black sheep&mdash;the most
prominent representative of this flock being Josephine.</p>

<p>But Josephine was stiffened this afternoon by what her father
had said the night before: "If Jenny McRae raises a finger against
you, heaven help Jim." This was because of a rumor that Mrs. McRae,
as an example for the public weal, was going to omit Josephine's
usual dance with Travis de Coppet from the vaudeville that
summer.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Mrs. McRae had, upon her husband's urgent
appeal, reconsidered; she was one large, unconvincing smile. After
a short but obvious conference behind her own eyes, she said:</p>

<p>"Do you see that young man on the second court, with the
head-band?" And as Josephine gazed apathetically, "That's my nephew
from Minneapolis. They say he has a fine chance to win here. I
wonder if you'd be a sweet girl and be nice to him and introduce
him to the young people."</p>

<p>Again she hesitated. "And I want to see you about the vaudeville
soon. We expect you and Travis to do that marvelous, marvelous
Maxixe for us."</p>

<p>Josephine's inner response was the monosyllable "Huh!"</p>

<p>She realized that she didn't want to be in the vaudeville, but
only to be invited. And another look at Mrs. McRae's nephew decided
her that the price was too high.</p>

<p>"The Maxixe is stale now," she answered, but her attention had
already wandered. Someone was staring at her from near by, someone
whose eyes burned disturbingly, like an uncharted light.</p>

<p>Turning to speak to Travis de Coppet, she could see the pale
lower half of a face two rows behind, and during the burst of
clapping at the end of a game she turned and made a cerebral
photograph of the entire individual as her eyes wandered casually
down the row.</p>

<p>He was a tall, even a high young man, with a rather small head
set on enormous round shoulders. His face was pale; his eyes were
nearly black, with an intense, passionate light in them; his mouth
was sensitive and strongly set. He was poorly dressed&mdash;green
shine on his suit, a shabby string of a necktie and a bum cap. When
she turned he looked at her with rigid hunger, and kept looking at
her after she had turned away, as if his eyes could burn loopholes
through the thin straw of her hat.</p>

<p>Suddenly Josephine realized what a pleasant scene it was, and,
relaxing, she listened to the almost regular pat-smack,
smack-pat-pat of the balls, the thud of a jump and the overtone of
the umpire's "Fault;" "Out;" "Game and set, 6-2, Mr. Oberwalter."
The sun moved slowly westward off the games and gossip. The day's
matches ended.</p>

<p>Rising, Mrs. McRae said to Josephine: "Then shall I bring Donald
to you when he's dressed? He doesn't know a soul. I count on you.
Where will you be?"</p>

<p>Josephine accepted the burden patiently: "I'll wait right
here."</p>

<p>Already there was music on the outdoor platform beside the club,
and there was a sound of clinking waiters as the crowd swayed out
of the grand stand. Josephine refused to go and dance, and
presently the three young men, each of whom had loved and lost her,
moved on to other prospects, and Josephine picked them out
presently below a fringe by their well-known feet&mdash;Travis de
Coppet's deft, dramatic feet; Ed Bement's stern and uncompromising
feet; Elsie Kerr's warped ankles; Lillian's new shoes; the high,
button shoes of some impossible girl. There were more feet; the
stands were almost empty now, and canvas was being spread over the
lonely courts. She heard someone coming clumsily down the plank
behind her and landing with a plunk upon the board on which she
sat, lifting her an abrupt inch into the air.</p>

<p>"D' I jar you?"</p>

<p>It was the man she had noticed and forgotten. He was still very
tall.</p>

<p>"Don't you go in for dancing?" he asked, lingering. "I picked
you out for the belle of the ball."</p>

<p>"You're rather fresh, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"My error," he said. "I should have known you were too swell to
be spoken to."</p>

<p>"I never saw you before."</p>

<p>"I never saw you either, but you looked so nice in your hat, and
I saw you smiling to your friends, so I thought I'd take a
chance."</p>

<p>"Like you do downstate, hey, Si?" retorted Josephine
insolently.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with downstate? I come from Abe Lincoln's
town, where the boys are big and brilliant."</p>

<p>"What are you&mdash;a dance-hall masher?"</p>

<p>He was extraordinarily handsome, and she liked his
imperviousness to insult.</p>

<p>"Thanks. I'm a reporter&mdash;not sports, or society either. I
came to do the atmosphere&mdash;you know, a fine day with the sun
sizzling on high and all the sporting world as well as the
fashionable world of Lake Forest out in force."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better go along and write it then?"</p>

<p>"Finished; another fellow took it. Can I sit down for a minute,
or do you soil easily? A mere breath of wind and poof! Listen, Miss
Potterfield-Swiftcormick, or whatever your name is. I come from
good people and I'm going to be a great writer some day." He sat
down. "If anybody comes you can say I was interviewing you for the
paper. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Perry."</p>

<p>"Herbert T. Perry?"</p>

<p>She nodded and he looked at her hard for a moment.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he sighed, "most attractive girl I've met for
months turns out to be Herbert T. Perry's daughter. As a rule, you
society nuts aren't much to look at. I mean, you pass more pretty
girls in the Loop in one hour than I've seen here this afternoon,
and the ones here have the advantage of dressing and all that.
What's your first name?"</p>

<p>She started to say "Miss," but suddenly it seemed pointless, and
she answered "Josephine."</p>

<p>"My name's John Boynton Bailey." He handed her his card with
CHICAGO TRIBUNE printed in the corner. "Let me inform you I'm the
best reporter in this city. I've written a play that ought to be
produced this fall. I'm telling you that to prove I'm not just some
bum, as you may judge from my old clothes. I've got some better
clothes home, but I didn't think I was going to meet you."</p>

<p>"I just thought you were sort of fresh to speak to me without
being introduced."</p>

<p>"I take what I can get," he admitted moodily.</p>

<p>At the sudden droop of his mouth, thoughtful and unhappy,
Josephine knew that she liked him. For a moment she did not want
Mrs. McRae and her nephew to see her with him; then, abruptly, she
did not care.</p>

<p>"It must be wonderful to write."</p>

<p>"I'm just getting started, but you'll be proud to know me
sometime." He changed the subject. "You've got wonderful
features&mdash;you know it? You know what features are&mdash;the
eyes and the mouth together, not separately&mdash;the triangle they
make. That's how people decide in a flash whether they like other
people. A person's nose and shape of the face are just things he's
born with and can't change. They don't matter, Miss Gotrocks."</p>

<p>"Please cut out the Stone Age slang."</p>

<p>"All right; but you've got nice features. Is your father
good-looking?"</p>

<p>"Very," she answered, appreciating the compliment.</p>

<p>The music started again. Under the trees the wooden floor was
red in the sun. Josephine sang softly:</p>

<p class="letter"><i>"'Lisibeth Ann-n,<br>
I'm wild a-bow-ow-out you, a-bow-ow-out you&mdash;"</i>
</p>

<p>"Nice here," he murmured. "Just this time of day and that music
under the trees. It's hot in Chicago!"</p>

<p>She was singing to him; the remarked triangle of her eyes and
mouth was turned on him, faintly and sadly smiling, her low voice
wooed him casually from some impersonal necessity of its own.
Realizing it, she broke off, saying: "I've got to go to the city
tomorrow. I've been putting it off."</p>

<p>"I bet you have a lot of men worried about you."</p>

<p>"Me? I just sit home and twirl my thumbs all day."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do."</p>

<p>"Everybody hates me and I return the compliment, so I'm going
into a convent or else to be a trained nurse in the war. Will you
enlist in the French Army and let me nurse you?"</p>

<p>Her words died away; his eyes, following hers, saw Mrs. McRae
and her nephew coming in at the gate. "I'll go now," he said
quickly. "You wouldn't have lunch with me if you come to Chicago
tomorrow? I'll take you to a German place with fine food."</p>

<p>She hesitated; Mrs. McRae's insincerely tickled expression grew
larger on the near distance.</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>He wrote swiftly on a piece of paper and handed it to her. Then,
lifting his big body awkwardly, he gallumped down the tier of
seats, receiving a quick but inquisitive glance from Mrs. McRae as
he lumbered past her.</p>

<p class="cpb">II.</p>

<p>It was easy to arrange. Josephine phoned the aunt with whom she
was to lunch, dropped the chauffeur and, not without a certain
breathlessness, approached Hoftzer's Rathskeller Garten on North
State Street. She wore a blue crepe-de-chine dress sprinkled with
soft brown leaves that were the color of her eyes.</p>

<p>John Boynton Bailey was waiting in front of the restaurant,
looking distracted, yet protective, and Josephine's uneasiness
departed.</p>

<p>He said, "We don't want to eat in this place. It seemed all
right when I thought about it, but I just looked inside, and you
might get sawdust in your shoes. We better go to some hotel."</p>

<p>Agreeably she turned in the direction of a hotel sacred to tea
dancing, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"You'd meet a lot of your friends. Let's go to the old La
Grange."</p>

<p>The old La Grange Hotel, once the pride of the Middle West, was
now a rendezvous of small-town transients and a forum for traveling
salesmen. The women in the lobby were either hard-eyed types from
the Loop or powderless, transpiring mothers from the Mississippi
Valley. There were spittoons in patient activity and a busy desk
where men mouthed cigars grotesquely and waited for telephone
calls.</p>

<p>In the big dining room, John Bailey and Josephine ordered
grapefruit, club sandwiches and julienne potatoes. Josephine put
her elbows on the table and regarded him as if to say: "Well, now
I'm temporarily yours; make the most of your time."</p>

<p>"You're the best-looking girl I ever met," he began. "Of course
you're tangled up in all this bogus society hokum, but you can't
help that. You think that's sour grapes, but I'll tell you; when I
hear people bragging about their social position and who they are,
and all that, I just sit back and laugh. Because I happen to be
descended directly from Charlemagne. What do you think of
that?"</p>

<p>Josephine blushed for him, and he grew a little ashamed of his
statement and qualified it:</p>

<p>"But I believe in <i>men</i>, not their ancestors. I want
to be the best writer in the world, that's all."</p>

<p>"I love good books," Josephine offered.</p>

<p>"It's the theater that interests me. I've got a play now that I
think would go big if the managers would bother to read it. I've
got all the stuff&mdash;sometimes I walk along the streets so full
of it that I feel I could just sail out over the city like a
balloon." His mouth drooped suddenly. "It's because I haven't got
anything to show yet that I talk like that."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bailey, the great playwright. You'll send me tickets to
your plays, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said abstractedly, "but by that time you'll be
married to some boy from Yale or Harvard with a couple of hundred
neckties and a good-looking car, and you'll get to be dumbbell like
the rest."</p>

<p>"I guess I am already&mdash;but I simply love poetry. Did you
ever read 'The Passing of Arthur'?"</p>

<p>"There's more good poetry being written now right in Chi than
during the whole last century. There's a man named Carl Sandburg
that's as great as Shakespeare."</p>

<p>She was not listening; she was watching him. His sensitive face
was glowing with the same strange light as when she had first seen
him.</p>

<p>"I like poetry and music better than anything in the world," she
said. "They're wonderful."</p>

<p>He believed her, knowing that she spoke of her liking for him.
She felt that he was distinguished, and by this she meant something
definite and real; the possession of some particular and special
passion for life. She knew that she herself was superior in
something to the girls who criticized her&mdash;though she often
confused her superiority with the homage it inspired&mdash;and she
was apathetic to the judgments of the crowd. The distinction that
at fifteen she had found in Travis de Coppet's ballroom romantics
she discovered now in John Bailey, in spite of his assertiveness
and his snobbishness. She wanted to look at life through his
glasses, since he found it so absorbing and exciting. Josephine had
developed early and lived hard&mdash;if that can be said of one
whose face was cousin to a fresh, damp rose&mdash;and she had begun
to find men less than satisfactory. The strong ones were dull, the
clever ones were shy, and all too soon they were responding to
Josephine with a fatal sameness, a lack of temperament that blurred
their personalities.</p>

<p>The club sandwiches arrived and absorbed them; there was
activity from an orchestra placed up near the ceiling in the
fashion of twenty years before. Josephine, chewing modestly, looked
around the room; just across from them a man and woman were getting
up from table, and she started and made one big swallow. The woman
was what was called a peroxide blonde, with doll's eyes boldly
drawn on a baby-pink face. The sugary perfume that exuded from her
garish clothes was almost visible as she preceded her escort to the
door. Her escort was Josephine's father.</p>

<p>"Don't you want your potatoes?" John Bailey asked after a
minute.</p>

<p>"I think they're very good," she said in a strained voice.</p>

<p>Her father, the cherished ideal of her life&mdash;handsome,
charming Herbert Perry. Her mother's lover&mdash;through so many
summer evenings had Josephine seen them in the swinging settee of
the veranda, with his head on her lap, smoothing his hair. It was
the promise of happiness in her parents' marriage that brought a
certain purposefulness into all Josephine's wayward seeking.</p>

<p>Now to see him lunching safely out of the zone of his friends
with such a woman! It was different with boys&mdash;she rather
admired their loud tales of conquest in the nether world, but for
her father, a grown man, to be like that. She was trembling; a tear
fell and glistened on a fried potato.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd like very much to go there," she heard herself
saying.</p>

<p>"Of course, they are all very serious people," he explained
defensively. "I think they've decided to produce my play in their
little theater. If they haven't I'll give one or two of them a good
sock on the jaw, so that next time they strike any literature
they'll recognize it."</p>

<p>In the taxi Josephine tried to put out of her mind what she had
seen at the hotel. Her home, the placid haven from which she had
made her forays, seemed literally in ruins, and she dreaded her
return. Awful, awful, awful!</p>

<p>In a panic she moved close to John Bailey, with the necessity of
being near something strong. The car stopped before a new building
of yellow stucco from which a blue-jowled, fiery-eyed young man
came out.</p>

<p>"Well, what happened?" John demanded.</p>

<p>"The trap dropped at 11:30."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I wrote out his farewell speech like he asked me to, but he
took too long and they wouldn't let him finish it."</p>

<p>"What a dirty trick on you."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it? Who's your friend?" The man indicated Josephine.</p>

<p>"Lake Forest stuff," said John, grinning. "Miss Perry, Mr.
Blacht."</p>

<p>"Here for the triumph of the Springfield Shakespeare? But I hear
they may do Uncle Tom's Cabin instead." He winked at Josephine. "So
long."</p>

<p>"What did he mean?" she demanded as they went on.</p>

<p>"Why, he's on the Tribune and he had to cover a hanging this
morning. What's more, he and I caught the fellow ourselves. Do you
think these cops ever catch anybody?"</p>

<p>"This isn't a jail, is it?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no; this is the theater workshop."</p>

<p>"What did he mean about a speech?"</p>

<p>"He wrote the man a dying speech to sort of make up for having
caught him."</p>

<p>"How perfectly hectic!" cried Josephine, awed.</p>

<p>They were in a long, dimly lit hall with a stage at one end;
upon it, standing about in the murkiness of a few footlights, were
a dozen people. Almost at once Josephine realized that everybody
there except herself was crazy. She knew it incontrovertibly,
although the only person of outward eccentricity was a robust woman
in a frock coat and gray morning trousers. And in spite of the fact
that of those present seven were later to attain notoriety, and
four, actual distinction, Josephine was, for the moment, right. It
was their intolerable inadjustability to their surroundings that
had plucked them from lonely normal schools, from the frame rows of
Midwestern towns and the respectability of shoddy suburbs, and
brought them to Chicago in 1916&mdash;ignorant, wild with energy,
doggedly sensitive and helplessly romantic, wanderers like their
pioneer ancestors upon the face of the land.</p>

<p>"This is Miss&mdash;," said John Bailey, "and
Mrs.&mdash;and Caroline&mdash;and
Mr.&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Their frightened eyes lifted to the young girl's elegant
clothes, her confident, beautiful face, and they turned from her
rudely in self-protection. Then gradually they came toward her,
hinting of their artistic or economic ideals, naive as freshmen,
unreticent as Rotarians. All but one, a handsome girl with a dirty
neck and furtive eyes&mdash;eyes which, from the moment of
Josephine's entrance, never left her face. Josephine listened to a
flow of talk, rapt of expression, but only half comprehending and
thinking often with sharp pain of her father. Her mind wandered to
Lake Forest as if it were a place she had left long ago, and she
heard the crack-pat-crack of the tennis balls in the still
afternoon. Presently the people sat down on kitchen chairs and a
gray-haired poet took the floor.</p>

<p>"The meeting of the committee this morning was to decide on our
first production. There was some debate. Miss Hammerton's
drama"&mdash;he bowed in the direction of the trousered
lady&mdash;"received serious consideration, but since one of our
benefactors is opposed to representations of the class war, we have
postponed consideration of Miss Hammerton's powerful play until
later."</p>

<p>At this point Josephine was startled to hear Miss Hammerton say
"Boo!" in a large, angry voice, give a series of groans, varied as
if to express the groans of many people&mdash;then clap on a soft
gray hat and stride angrily from the room.</p>

<p>"Elsie takes it hard," said the chairman. "Unhappily, the
benefactor I spoke of, whose identity you have doubtless guessed,
is adamant on the subject&mdash;a thorough reactionary. So your
committee have unanimously voted that our production shall be 'Race
Riot', by John Boynton Bailey."</p>

<p>Josephine gasped congratulations. In the applause the girl with
the furtive eyes brought her chair over and sat down beside
Josephine.</p>

<p>"You live at Lake Forest," she said challengingly.</p>

<p>"In the summer."</p>

<p>"Do you know Emily Kohl?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"I thought you were from Lake Forest."</p>

<p>"I live at Lake Forest," said Josephine, still pleasantly, "but
I don't know Emily Kohl."</p>

<p>Rebuffed only for a moment, the girl continued, "I don't suppose
all this means much to you."</p>

<p>"It's a sort of dramatic club, isn't it?" said Josephine.</p>

<p>"Dramatic club! Oh, gosh!" cried the girl. "Did you hear that?
She thinks it's a dramatic club, like Miss Pinkerton's school." In
a moment her uninfectious laughter died away, and she turned to the
playwright. "How about it? Have you picked your cast?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," he said shortly, annoyed at the baiting of
Josephine.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll have Mrs. Fiske coming on from New York," the
girl continued. "Come on, we're all on pins and needles. Who's
going to be in it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing, Evelyn. You're not."</p>

<p>She grew red with astonishment and anger. "Oho! When did you
decide that?"</p>

<p>"Some time ago."</p>

<p>"Oho! How about all the lines I gave you for Clare?"</p>

<p>"I'll cut them tonight; there were only three. I'd rather not
produce the thing than have you play Clare."</p>

<p>The others were listening now.</p>

<p>"Far be it from me," the girl began, her voice trembling a
little, "far be it from me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Josephine saw that John Bailey's face was even whiter than
usual. His mouth was hard and cold. Suddenly the girl got up, cried
out, "You fool!" and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>With this second temperamental departure a certain depression
settled on those remaining; presently the meeting broke up,
convoked for next day.</p>

<p>"Let's take a walk," John said to Josephine as they came out
into a different afternoon; the heat had lifted with the first
breeze from Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>"Let's take a walk," John repeated. "That made me sort of
sick&mdash;her talking to you like that."</p>

<p>"I didn't like her, but now I'm sorry for her. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"She's a newspaper woman," he answered vaguely. "Listen. How
would you like to be in this play?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't&mdash;I've got to be in a play out at the
Lake."</p>

<p>"Society stuff," he said, scornfully mimicking: "'Here come the
jolly, jolly golfing girls. Maybe they'll sing us a song.' If you
want to be in this thing of mine you can have the lead."</p>

<p>"But how do you know I could act?"</p>

<p>"Come on! With that voice of yours? Listen. The girl in the play
is like you. This race riot is caused by two men, one black and one
white. The black man is fed up with his black wife and in love with
a high-yellow girl, and that makes him bitter, see? And the white
man married too young and he's in the same situation. When they
both get their domestic affairs straightened the race riot dies
down, too, see?"</p>

<p>"It's very original," said Josephine breathlessly. "Which would
I be?"</p>

<p>"You'd be the girl the married man was in love with."</p>

<p>"Is that the part that girl was going to play?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He frowned, and then added, "She's my wife."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you're married?"</p>

<p>"I married young&mdash;like the man in my play. In one way it
isn't so bad, because neither of us believed in the old-fashioned
bourgeois marriage, living in the same apartment and all. She kept
her own name. But we got to hate each other anyhow."</p>

<p>After the first shock was over, it did not seem so strange to
Josephine that he was married; there had been a day two years
before when only the conscientiousness of a rural justice had
prevented Josephine from becoming Mrs. Travis de Coppet.</p>

<p>"We all get what's coming to us," he remarked.</p>

<p>They turned up the boulevard, passing the Blackstone, where
faint dance music clung about the windows.</p>

<p>On the street the plate glass of a hundred cars, bound for the
country or the North Shore, took the burning sunset, but the city
would make shift without them, and Josephine's imagination rested
here instead of following the cars; she thought of electric fans in
little restaurants with lobsters on ice in the windows, and of
pearly signs glittering and revolving against the obscure, urban
sky, the hot, dark sky. And pervading everything, a terribly
strange, brooding mystery of roof tops and empty apartments, of
white dresses in the paths of parks, and fingers for stars and
faces instead of moons, and people with strange people scarcely
knowing one another's names.</p>

<p>A sensuous shiver went over Josephine, and she knew that the
fact that John Bailey was married simply added to his attraction
for her. Life broke up a little; barred and forbidden doors swung
open, unmasking enchanted corridors. Was it that which drew her
father, some call to adventure that she had from him?</p>

<p>"I wish there was some place we could go and be alone together,"
John Bailey said, and suddenly, "I wish I had a car."</p>

<p>But they were already alone, she thought. She had spun him out a
background now that was all his&mdash;the summer streets of the
city. They were alone here; when he kissed her, finally, they would
be less alone. That would be his time; this was hers. Their
mutually clinging arms pulled her close to his tall side.</p>

<p>A little later, sitting in the back of a movie with the yellow
clock in the corner creeping fatally toward six, she leaned into
the hollow of his rounded shoulder and his cool white cheek bent
down to hers.</p>

<p>"I'm letting myself in for a lot of suffering," he whispered.
She saw his black eyes thinking in the darkness and met them
reassuringly with hers.</p>

<p>"I take things pretty hard," he went on. "And what in hell could
we ever be to each other?"</p>

<p>She didn't answer. Instead she let the familiar lift and float
and flow of love close around them, pulling him back from his
far-away uniqueness with the pressure of her hand.</p>

<p>"What will your wife think if I take that part in your play?"
she whispered.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>At the same moment Josephine's wayward parent was being met by
her mother at the Lake Forest Station.</p>

<p>"It's deathly hot in town," he said. "What a day!"</p>

<p>"Did you see her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and after one look I took her to the La Grange for lunch.
I wanted to preserve a few shreds of my reputation."</p>

<p>"Is it settled?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She's agreed to leave Will alone and stop using his name
for three hundred a month for life. I wired your highly
discriminating brother in Hawaii that he can come home."</p>

<p>"Poor Will," sighed Mrs. Perry.</p>

<p class="cpb">III.</p>

<p>Three days later, in the cool of the evening, Josephine spoke to
her father as he came out on the veranda.</p>

<p>"Daddy, do you want to back a play?"</p>

<p>"I never thought about it. I'd always thought I'd like to write
one. Is Jenny McRae's vaudeville on the rocks?"</p>

<p>Josephine ticked impatiently with her tongue. "I'm not even
going to be in the vaudeville. I'm talking about an attempt to do
something fine. What I want to ask is: What would be your possible
objections to backing it?"</p>

<p>"My objections?"</p>

<p>"What would they be?"</p>

<p>"You haven't given me time to drum up any."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd want to do something decent with your
money."</p>

<p>"What's the play?" He sat down beside her, and she moved just
slightly away from him.</p>

<p>"Mother knows some of the patronesses and it's absolutely all
right. But the man who was going to be the backer is very narrow
and wants to make a lot of changes that would ruin the whole thing;
so they want to find another backer."</p>

<p>"What's it about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the play's all right, don't you worry," she assured him.
"The man that wrote it is still alive, but the play is a part of
English literature."</p>

<p>He considered. "Well, if you're going to be in it, and your
mother thinks it all right, I'd put up a couple of hundred."</p>

<p>"A couple of hundred!" she exclaimed. "A man who goes around
throwing away his money like you do! They need at least a
thousand."</p>

<p>"Throwing away my money?" he repeated. "What on earth are you
talking about?"</p>

<p>"You know what I'm talking about." It seemed to her that he
winced slightly, that his voice was uncertain as he said:</p>

<p>"If you mean the way we live, it doesn't seem quite tactful to
reproach me about that."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that." Josephine hesitated; then without
premeditation took a sudden plunge into blackmail: "I should think
you'd rather not have me soil my hands by
discussing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Perry's footsteps sounded in the hall, and Josephine rose
quickly. The car rolled up the drive.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll go to bed early," her mother said.</p>

<p>"Lillian and some kids are coming over."</p>

<p>Josephine and her father exchanged a short, hostile glance
before the machine drove off.</p>

<p>It was a harvest night, bright enough to read by. Josephine sat
on the veranda steps listening to the tossing of sleepless birds,
the rattle of a last dish in the kitchen, the sad siren of the
Chicago-Milwaukee train. Composed and tranquil, she sat waiting for
the telephone; he could not see her there, so she saw herself for
him&mdash;it was almost the same.</p>

<p>She considered the immediate future in all its gorgeous
possibilities&mdash;the first night, with the audience whispering:
"Do you realize that's the Perry girl?" With the final curtain,
tumultuous applause and herself, with arms full of flowers, leading
forth a tall, shy man who would say: "I owe it all to her." And
Mrs. McRae's furious face in the audience, and the remorseful face
of Miss Brereton, of the Brereton School, who happened to be in
town. "Had I but known her genius, I wouldn't have acted as I did."
Comments jubilant and uproarious from every side: "The greatest
young actress on the American stage!"</p>

<p>Then the move to a larger theater; great, staring, electric
letters, JOSEPHINE PERRY IN RACE RIOT. "No, father, I'm not going
back to school. This is my education and my debut." And her
father's answer:</p>

<p>"Well, little girl, I'll have to admit it was a lucky
speculation for me to put up that money."</p>

<p>If the figure of John Bailey became a little dim during the
latter part of this reverie, it was because the reverie itself
opened out to vaguer and vaguer horizons, to return always to that
opening night from which it started once more.</p>

<p>Lillian, Travis and Ed came, but she was hardly aware of them,
listening for the telephone. They sat, as they had so often, in a
row on the steps, surrounded, engulfed, drowned in summer. But they
were growing up and the pattern was breaking; they were absorbed in
secret destinies of their own, no matter how friendly their voices
or how familiar their laughter in the silence. Josephine's boredom
with a discussion of the tournament turned to irascibility; she
told Travis de Coppet that he smelled of onions.</p>

<p>"I won't eat any onions when we rehearse for the vaudeville," he
said.</p>

<p>"You won't be rehearsing with me, because I'm not being in it.
I've got a little tired of 'Here come the jolly golfing girls.
Hurray!'"</p>

<p>The phone rang and she excused herself.</p>

<p>"Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"There're some people here&mdash;that I've known all my
life."</p>

<p>"Don't kiss anybody. I don't mean that&mdash;go kiss anybody you
want to."</p>

<p>"I don't want to." She felt her own lips' warmth in the
mouthpiece of the phone.</p>

<p>"I'm out in a pay station. She came up to my room in a crazy
humor and I got out."</p>

<p>Josephine didn't answer; something went out of her when he spoke
of his wife.</p>

<p>When she went back on the porch her guests, sensing her
abstraction, were on their feet.</p>

<p>"No. We want to go. You bore us too."</p>

<p>Her parents' car pursued Ed's around the circular drive. Her
father motioned that he wanted to see her alone.</p>

<p>"I didn't quite understand about my spending my money. Is this a
Socialist bunch?"</p>

<p>"I told you that mother knew some of the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who is it you know? The fellow who wrote the play?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where did you meet him?"</p>

<p>"Just around."</p>

<p>"He asked you to raise the money?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I'd certainly like to have a talk with him before you go into
this any further. Invite him out to luncheon Saturday?"</p>

<p>"All right," she agreed unwillingly. "If you don't taunt him
about his poverty and his ragged clothes."</p>

<p>"What a thing to accuse me of!"</p>

<p>It was with a deep uneasiness that, next Saturday, Josephine
drove her roadster to the station. She was relieved to see that he
had had a haircut, and he looked very big and powerful and
distinguished among the tennis crowd as he got off the train. But
finding him nervous, she drove around Lake Forest for half an
hour.</p>

<p>"Whose house is that?" he kept asking. "Who are these two people
you just spoke to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; just somebody. There'll be nobody at lunch,
but the family and a boy named Howard Page I've known for
years."</p>

<p>"These boys you've known for years," he sighed. "Why wasn't I
one?"</p>

<p>"But you don't want to be that. You want to be the best writer
in the world."</p>

<p>In the Perrys' living room John Bailey stared at a photograph of
bridesmaids at her sister's wedding the previous summer. Then
Howard Page, a junior at New Haven, arrived and they talked of the
tennis: Mrs. McRae's nephew had done brilliantly and was conceded a
chance in the finals this afternoon. When Mrs. Perry came
downstairs, just before luncheon, John Bailey could not help
turning his back on her suddenly and walking up and down to pretend
he was at home. He knew in his heart he was better than these
people, and he couldn't bear that they should not know it.</p>

<p>The maid called him to the telephone, and Josephine overheard
him say, "I can't help it. You have no right to call me here." It
was because of the existence of his wife that she had not let him
kiss her, but had fitted him, instead, into her platonic reverie,
which should endure until Providence set him free.</p>

<p>At luncheon she was relieved to see John Bailey and her father
take a liking to each other. John was expert and illuminating about
the race riots, and she saw how thin and meager Howard Page was
beside him.</p>

<p>Again John Bailey was summoned to the phone; this time he left
the room with an exclamation, said three words into the mouthpiece
and hung up with a sharp click.</p>

<p>Back at table, he whispered to Josephine: "Will you tell the
maid to say I'm gone if she calls again?"</p>

<p>Josephine was in argument with her mother: "I don't see the use
of coming out if I could be an actress instead."</p>

<p>"Why should she come out?" her father agreed. "Hasn't she done
enough rushing around?"</p>

<p>"But certainly she's to finish school. There's a course in
dramatic art and every year they give a play."</p>

<p>"What do they give?" demanded Josephine scornfully. "Shakespeare
or something like that! Do you realize there are at least a dozen
poets right here in Chicago that are better than Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>John Bailey demurred with a laugh. "Oh, no. One maybe."</p>

<p>"I think a dozen," insisted the eager convert.</p>

<p>"In Billy Phelps' course at Yale&mdash;" began Howard
Page, but Josephine said vehemently:</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I don't think you ought to wait till people are dead
before you recognize them. Like mother does."</p>

<p>"I do no such thing," objected Mrs. Perry. "Did I say that,
Howard?"</p>

<p>"In Billy Phelps' course at Yale&mdash;" began Howard
again, but this time Mr. Perry interrupted:</p>

<p>"We're getting off the point. This young man wants my daughter
in his play. If there's nothing disgraceful in the play I don't
object."</p>

<p>"In Billy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I don't want Josephine in anything sordid."</p>

<p>"Sordid!" Josephine glared at him. "Don't you think there are
plenty of sordid things right here in Lake Forest, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"But they don't touch you," her father said.</p>

<p>"Don't they, though?"</p>

<p>"No," he said firmly. "Nothing sordid touches you. If it does,
then it's your own fault." He turned to John Bailey. "I understand
you need money."</p>

<p>John flushed. "We do. But don't think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right. We've stood behind the opera here for many
years and I'm not afraid of things simply because they're new. We
know some women on your committee and I don't suppose they'd stand
for any nonsense. How much do you need?"</p>

<p>"About two thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Well, you raise half and I'll raise half&mdash;on two
conditions: First, my name kept entirely out of it and my
daughter's name not played up in any way; second, you assure me
personally that she doesn't play any questionable part or have any
speeches to make that might offend her mother."</p>

<p>John Bailey considered. "That last is a large order," he said.
"I don't know what would offend her mother. There wouldn't be any
cursing to do, for instance. There's not a bit in the whole damn
play."</p>

<p>He flushed slowly at their laughter.</p>

<p>"Nothing sordid is going to touch Josephine unless she steps
into it herself," said Mr. Perry.</p>

<p>"I see your point," John Bailey said.</p>

<p>Lunch was over. For some moments Mrs. Perry had been glancing
toward the hall, where some loud argument was taking place.</p>

<p>"Shall we&mdash;"</p>

<p>They had scarcely crossed the threshold of the living room when
the maid appeared, followed by a local personage in a vague uniform
of executive blue.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Kelly. You going to take us into custody?"</p>

<p>Kelly hesitated awkwardly. "Is there a Mr. Bailey?"</p>

<p>John, who had wandered off, swung about sharply. "What?"</p>

<p>"There's an important message for you. They've been trying to
get you here, but they couldn't, so they telephoned the
constable&mdash;that's me." He beckoned him, and then, talking to
him, tried at the same time to urge him, with nods of his head,
toward the privacy of outdoors; his voice, though lowered, was
perfectly audible to everybody in the room.</p>

<p>"The St. Anthony's Hospital&mdash;your wife slashed both her
wrists and turned the gas on&mdash;they want you as soon as you can
get there." The voice pitched higher as they went through the door:
"They don't know yet&mdash;If there's no train, you can get
a car&mdash;" They were both outside now, walking fast down
the path. Josephine saw John trip and grasp clumsily at the edge
that bordered the gate, and then go on with great strides toward
the constable's flivver. The constable was running to keep up with
him.</p>

<p class="cpb">IV.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, when John Bailey's trouble had died away in
the distance, they all stopped being stunned and behaved like
people again. Mr. and Mrs. Perry were panicky as to how far
Josephine was involved; then they became angry at John Bailey for
coming there with disaster hanging over him.</p>

<p>Mr. Perry demanded: "Did you know he was married?"</p>

<p>Josephine was crying; her mouth was drawn; he looked away from
her.</p>

<p>"They lived separately," she whispered.</p>

<p>"She seemed to know he was out here."</p>

<p>"Of course he's a newspaperman," said her mother, "so he can
probably keep it out of the papers. Or do you think you ought to do
something, Herbert?"</p>

<p>"I was just wondering."</p>

<p>Howard Page got up awkwardly, not wanting to say he was now
going to the tennis finals. Mr. Perry went to the door and talked
earnestly for a few minutes, and Howard nodded.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. Several callers drifted by in cars, but
received word that no one was at home. Josephine felt something
throbbing on the heat of the summer afternoon; and at first she
thought it was pity and then remorse, but finally she knew what the
throbbing was. "I must push this thing away from me," it said;
"this thing must not touch me. I hardly met his wife. He told
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>And now John Bailey began slipping away. Who was he but a chance
encounter, someone who had spoken to her a week before about a play
he had written? He had nothing to do with her.</p>

<p>At four o'clock Mr. Perry went to the phone and called St.
Anthony's Hospital; only when he asked for an official whom he knew
did he get the information: In the actual face of death, Mrs.
Bailey had phoned for the police, and it now seemed that they had
reached her in time. She had lost blood, but barring
complications&mdash;</p>

<p>Now, in the relief, the parents grew angry with Josephine as
with a child who has toddled under galloping horses.</p>

<p>"What I can't understand is why you should have to know people
like that. Is it necessary to go into the back streets of
Chicago?"</p>

<p>"That young man had no business here," her father thundered
grimly, "and he knew it."</p>

<p>"But who was he?" wailed Mrs. Perry.</p>

<p>"He told me he was a descendant of Charlemagne," said
Josephine.</p>

<p>Mr. Perry grunted. "Well, we want no more of Charlemagne's
descendants here. Young people had better stay with their own kind
until they can distinguish one from another. You let married men
alone."</p>

<p>But now Josephine was herself again. She stood up, her eyes
hardening.</p>

<p>"Oh, you make me sick," she cried&mdash;"a married man! As if
there weren't a lot of married men who met other women besides
their wives."</p>

<p>Unable to bear another scene, Mrs. Perry withdrew. Once she was
out of hearing, Josephine came out into the open at last: "You're a
fine one to talk to me."</p>

<p>"Now look here; you said that the other night, and I don't like
it now any better than I did then. What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you've never been to lunch with anybody at the La
Grange Hotel."</p>

<p>"The La Grange&mdash;" The truth broke over him slowly.
"Why&mdash;" He began laughing. Then he swore suddenly, and going
quickly to the foot of the stairs, called his wife.</p>

<p>"You sit down," he said to Josephine. "I'm going to tell you a
story."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Miss Josephine Perry left her house and set
off for the tennis tournament. She wore one of the new autumn gowns
with the straight line, but having a looped effect at the sides of
the skirt, and fluffy white cuffs. Some people she met just outside
the stands told her that Mrs. McRae's nephew was weakening to the
veteran, and this started her thinking of Mrs. McRae and of her
decision about the vaudeville with a certain regret. People would
think it odd if she wasn't in it.</p>

<p>There was a sudden burst of wild clapping as she went in; the
tournament was over. The crowd was swarming around victor and
vanquished in the central court, and gravitating with it, she was
swept by an eddy to the very front of it, until she was face to
face with Mrs. McRae's nephew himself. But she was equal to the
occasion. With her most sad and melting smile, as if she had hoped
for him from day to day, she held out her hand and spoke to him in
her clear, vibrant voice:</p>

<p>"We are all awfully sorry."</p>

<p>For a moment, even in the midst of the excited crowd, a hushed
silence fell. Modestly, conscious of her personality, Josephine
backed away, aware that he was staring after her, his mouth
stupidly open, aware of a burst of laughter around her. Travis de
Coppet appeared beside her.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the nuts!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sorry! Why, he <i>won</i>! It was the greatest come-back I
ever saw."</p>

<hr>

<p>So, at the vaudeville, Josephine sat with her family after all.
Looking around during the show, she saw John Bailey standing in the
rear. He looked very sad, and she felt very sorry, realizing that
he had come in hopes of a glimpse of her. He would see, at least,
that she was not up there on the stage debasing herself with such
inanities.</p>

<p>Then she caught her breath as the lights changed, the music
quickened and at the head of the steps, Travis de Coppet in
white-satin football suit swung into the spotlight a shimmering
blonde in a dress of autumn leaves. It was Madelaine Danby, and it
was the role Josephine would have played. With the warm rain of
intimate applause, Josephine decided something: That any value she
might have was in the immediate, shimmering present&mdash;and thus
thinking, she threw in her lot with the rich and powerful of this
world forever.</p>
