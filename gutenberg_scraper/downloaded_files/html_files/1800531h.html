<h3>First published in  <i>Esquire</i>, May 1935.</h3>

<hr>

<p>I woke up after a lousy dream, and as soon as the old beezer came alive
I went around the yard trying to pick up something interesting, but the
wind was too strong.

<p>There was an old biscuit in my dish and if there's anything gloomier
than one dead biscuit on a windy morning I don't know about it.

<p>The Brain came downstairs early like she usually does ever since she
began staying away all day long. I gave her a rush, and I meant it,
too. I'm not one of these diggities that think their boss is a god,
even if he's an old nigger that smells like everybody that gave him his
clothes&mdash;but really anybody would have to hand it to the Brain.

<p>Since I grew up and got the idea that they don't go in much for any
perfumes except their own, I never had any trouble with her&mdash;except the
time I brought her that bone in the middle of the night and she hit me
in the eye with it.

<p>I was hoping it was about the right day to go out in the country and
swim, but nothing doing&mdash;she got into her moving room at the usual time
and shoved off, and I had to amuse myself. It wasn't the first time I
wished I had something regular to do. My friend across the street was
waiting for his chow, which he gets in the morning, so I had a workout
with the little squirt next door. He came tearing over, cursing and
threatening, because he knew I never hurt him.

<p>"You big, clumsy tub of hair, I could run rings around you, and I'm out
to prove it!"

<p>"Yeah?" I said, kind of amused, because he talks as if he meant it,
and we went through a routine with a lot of false starts, charges, leg
and throat holds, rollaways, and escapes. It was all right, and after,
while we were panting plenty, but I don't get much of a workout with
him, because he uses up so much time dodging and doing circles. I like
a dog to go in and take it. Even a little fellow like him. Once he let
a tooth slip and nipped me, and I gave him hell.

<p>"Don't take advantage, or I'll tear your coat off."

<p>"Aw, don't get sore."

<p>"Then don't let that tooth slip again."

<p>While we were resting he said: "What are you doing this morning?"

<p>"What's on your mind? You won't get me out after some cat again. Some
dogs never grow up."

<p>"It's no cat."

<p>"Then what is it? Meat&mdash;or girls?"

<p>"I'll take you there and you can see for yourself."

<p>"You're generous all of a sudden. How big's the dog that's there now?"

<p>While we waited for my friend we did some barking&mdash;or rather the squirt
did most of it. These little tykes can yelp all day without getting
hoarse. He made some circles around a bunch of kids heading for school,
and I had a laugh when he got a kick in the ribs and gave out a real
yelp. I only barked a little in the base to stretch my throat&mdash;I'm not
one of the kind always shooting off their mouth.

<p>After my friend came out we went with the squirt to see what he'd
found. Just like I thought, it was nothing&mdash;a garbage can with a lid
you could nose off. I got a whiff of some perfume, too, that bucked me
up for a minute, but it was yesterday's, so my friend and I roughed up
the squirt for wasting our time and went off on our own.

<p>We followed a tall lady for a while&mdash;no particular reason except she
had a parcel with meat in it&mdash;we knew we wouldn't get any, but you
never can tell. Sometimes I just feel like shutting my nose and just
following somebody pretending they're yours, or that they're taking you
somewhere. After a couple of streets I picked up a new perfume.

<p>"There's some romance," I said.

<p>"Say you got a nose." He tried for it, but didn't get anything.

<p>"I must be getting old. I can always remember shapes, but I get mixed
up on perfume."

<p>"Shucks, it's just the wind," I said, to make him feel all right,
but he has got a weak nose. Now me, I got a fine nose, but I'm weak
on shapes. In a minute, though, he got it, and we left the lady and
started back down the street at a trot. Say we must have followed a
mile, both of us getting more and more disgusted.

<p>"What's the use?" my friend said. "Either I'm crazy or we're not
following one scent, but about ten."

<p>"I get about twenty."

<p>"What say we quit?"

<p>"Well, we're pretty near now."

<p>We got up on a hill presently and looked down&mdash;and, say, I haven't seen
so many curs since the dog show.

<p>"Sold," I says, and we started home.

<p>The Brain wasn't there yet, but the Beard was. He got out that damn
pole and tried to kid me again, holding it out and jabbering&mdash;a long
time ago I figured out that his object is to see if I'm fool enough to
jump over it. But I don't bite, just walk round it. Then he tried the
trick they all do&mdash;held my paws and tried to balance me up on the end
of my spine. I never could figure out the point of that one.

<p>He started the music-box, that tune that makes my ear hum and starts
me howling&mdash;so I lammed it out and down the street. A dog passed me
carrying a newspaper looking all pleased with himself&mdash;but the one time
I tried that racket I forgot what it was I was carrying and started to
bury it, and when the Beard saw me, was he sore!

<p>Pretty soon I saw my friend coming down the street. He was a fine big
dog. He stopped and visited for a minute, with a child he knew, and
then he saw me, and came running in my direction. What happened next I
couldn't see. It was noon, and there were lots of moving rooms at the
cross street&mdash;the first thing I knew was that one of them had stopped
and then another, and that several people had gotten out. I hurried
over with some men.

<p>It was my friend, lying on his side and bleeding out of his mouth; his
eyes were open, but his breathing was wrong. Everybody was excited, and
they pulled him up on the lawn: by and by his little boy and girl ran
out of their house and came over and began to cry. I and another dog
that knew him well went up to him, and I wanted to lick him, but when I
came really close he snarled, "Scram!" and got half up on his haunches.
He thought I was going to eat him just because he was down.

<p>The little boy said, "Get away, you!" and it made me feel bad because
I've never eaten a dog in my life, and would not unless I was very
hungry. But of course, I went away so as not to worry him, and waited
until they carried him away on a blanket. After that we sniffed at the
blood in the street and one dog licked it.

<p>In the front yard I howled. I don't know why&mdash;then I went to look
for the Brain. When I didn't find her I began to figure that maybe
something had happened to her, too, and she wouldn't be back any more.
I went up on the porch and waited, but she didn't come, so I scratched
on the screen and went in and howled a little at the Beard, who gave me
a head scratch.

<p>Presently I went to the door, and there was the Brain, getting out of
her moving room&mdash;I made a rush for her anyhow, and put my nose in her
hand and almost tripped her going upstairs. It was good to know she was
home. She gave me dinner&mdash;the ground beef again and biscuit and milk
and a good bone. I picked out the meat first; then I drank the milk
and licked the biscuits, but didn't eat them; then I polished my teeth
on the bone and buried it shallow&mdash;I must have a hundred bones around
here, and I don't know why I save them. I never find them again unless
accidentally, but I just can't stand leaving them around.

<p>Afterwards I started to go over and see my friend, but there was nobody
around except the little girl sitting in the swing and crying.
