<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>There was unrest in Austria, arrest in Germany, and in Japan a
plaintive desire to do good to all of Asia. Jugoslavia, Siam, and
Bolivia were trying to remember the address of the League of
Nations, that June in 1933. The most respectable bootleggers in
Maine were worried about Repeal, and in the Golden West every
worker was striking except the makers of buggy whips, and there
were no makers of buggy whips. In all the world, there was peace
only in Scandinavia, Marie Byrd Land, and the heart of Cordwood
McGash.</p>

<p>Cordwood was christened&mdash;except that he probably never was
christened&mdash;Sylvester Goodwillie McGash, in the State of
Vermont. As a true Yankee, when he went West he tried every known
indigenous trade except being Governor, and he even thought about
that, one night after acquiring much popularity and applause by
singing "Bill the Sailor" in O'Toole's sample room. But the next
morning his landlady had words with him regarding the rent and the
discovery of his shoes and a deceased pickerel left hanging on the
chandelier downstairs, and so he went still farther west that
morning&mdash;by freight.</p>

<p>He was variously a sewing-machine salesman, a carpenter, capper
in a medicine show, a gold-prospector, a hard-rock man, a dry-goods
clerk, a newspaper editor and, for one happy month&mdash;which he
somewhat hastily terminated by the back window as the police came
in the front door&mdash;the voice of the Zoroastrian Seeress's
favorite Control, Big Chief Wampum. He was always merry,
occasionally drunk, and he was a celebrated wrestler. But he was
not the lanky Yankee of tradition. He was a small man,
curly-headed, bright-eyed, and he bounced around a good deal, and
to his friends he lent money without remembering it.</p>

<p>Not till he was twenty-nine did he settle down, as time-keeper
and store keeper in a lumber camp twenty miles north of the village
of Jackrabbit Creek. He liked the combination of warm office,
frozen drifts among the pines, and evenings in the bunkhouse, where
he jigged in competition with Nova Scotian Bluenose lumberjacks. He
studied book-keeping and trees. After two years, he started a
general store in Jackrabbit Creek. He dealt in everything from
muskrats to threshing machines. He lent money and wrote insurance.
He speculated in land.</p>

<p>Jackrabbit Creek is on the line between northern forest and
fuelless prairie, and McGash began to sell cordwood by the
trainload to the prairie farms, then to the Twin Cities and Chicago
whence his invariable nickname, Cordwood. He bought and leased
forty thousand acres of land before he was done. When the trees had
been&mdash;no doubt disgracefully&mdash;slashed down, and he could
not sell the cutover land for even five dollars an acre, it looked
as though Cordwood's fortune of $60,000 would go in taxes.</p>

<p>Then they dug up iron.</p>

<p>His poor domain of sand and brushwood was discovered to be as
rich in surface iron ore, to be mined with scoopshovel and railroad
car, as the Mesaba Range itself, and every inch of the deposit near
Jackrabbit was on Cordwood's land alone. The steel companies bought
him out, handsomely.</p>

<p>So it happened that at the age of fifty-five, a bachelor because
he had always loved all the ladies too generously to pick on any
one of them, this little man with the hard hands of a workman, this
cheerful dancer in saloons, this busy speculator to whom business
was not money but a game, found himself with $7,000,000 to his
credit, no job any longer, and no notion whatever as to how he
could use all that incalculable pile. And it found him the one rich
man in Jackrabbit Creek, with its twelve hundred inhabitants, of
whom no man aside from Cordwood McGash could afford two
simultaneous pairs of suspenders. It found him a millionaire
sitting tilted back in a cane-seated chair in front of the Sunset
Trail Hotel, piping to Manny Ilgenfritz, the grocer, "Say,
devertellyuh about the time I was prospectin' in
Colorado&mdash;"</p>

<p>For years, Cordwood had roomed with the Widow Tinkerbun, and he
didn't see how he could hurt her feelings by leaving her, now that
he was suddenly rich.</p>

<p>Sister Tinkerbun had no suites in her boarding house. (Neither
did the Sunset Trail Hotel, for that matter, nor the National
House, where the tin-can tourists stayed.) So Cordwood solemnly
engaged the row of six unconnected bedrooms&mdash;all exactly alike
and equally uncomfortable&mdash;on both sides of the upper hall,
and by sitting and smoking in them in turn, he felt that he was
doing his duty by his wealth. He also brought home to Sister
Tinkerbun and the boarding house table such delicacies as caviar,
especially imported from Minneapolis, ten pounds of peanut brittle,
and an enormous tub of mackerel, very spoiled.</p>

<p>He bought, from Cohen and Cabot, five suits of ready-made
clothes, in checks, plaids, and orange stripes, with six pairs of
shoes and seventeen neckties. It is true that he went on wearing
the familiar flapping grey oversized suit in which Jackrabbit had
known him for five years and the same comfortable old shoes and
Stetson, but he did once in a while venture on the reddest of his
new ties.</p>

<p>Yet even with such Fifth Avenue display, he did not feel that he
was getting his money's worth.</p>

<p>Seven million dollars to spend. That, brooded the once-happy
speculator, was a task.</p>

<p>He gave every child in town a bag of candy. Mostly, they got
sick, and for days he was unpopular with every one in town except
the doctor.</p>

<p>He built a vast, $500,000 Community Hall, and was atrociously
bored by having to sit on the platform at the dedication ceremonies
and listen to the local congressman and three varieties of
bishops.</p>

<p>He sent the local music genius, Les Hoggins, to Paris, to study
the violin. And Les really was a genius, Jackrabbit Creek was
certain, because while most musicians can play only one or two
instruments, Les was master of the fiddle, the piano, the parlor
organ, the mouth organ, the saxophone, the comet, the
banjo-linitar, and the snare-drum, and he could even, during idle
moments between giving shaves and haircuts at Oley Tengbom's Elite
Barber Shop, make very interesting melody on a comb. But even out
of this flight into the higher arts Cordwood got little
satisfaction, because for months he received no word from Les
except picture postcards, usually depicting the Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>Not but that Cordwood had plenty of generous advice about
spending his seven million. From the Twin Cities and even from
Chicago, by train, motor, and plane, came genial gentlemen who
loved to give away cigars and who were willing to let Cordwood in
on annuities, Brazilian gold mines, Long Island real estate,
and&mdash;latest and most refined and intellectual racket of
all&mdash;Little Magazines which were going to revolutionize both
Capitalism and Poetry. But to these missionaries of good will
Cordwood was curt, with a snarling curtness which surprised the
friendly citizenry of Jackrabbit Creek. They who remembered him
listening to an impoverished farmer and paying up his mortgage were
astonished to see him, armed with an ice-water pitcher from the
Sunset Trail Hotel lobby, chase a New York bond-salesman from Main
Street clear out to the Mile Bridge.</p>

<p>These alien experts did not understand Cordwood. They told him
how to make money. And what he wanted to do was to get rid of his
money&mdash;and to get some fun out of doing it. And to get rid,
painlessly, of $7,000,000 is not easy for a man whose idea of a
perfect dinner, these fifty and more years, has been pork and
beans, pickles, lemon murang pie, and cuppacoffee.</p>

<p>He thought of travel, and probably if he had had an energetic
wife, he would have gone out to view the Taj Mahal, and the lark,
oyster, and kidney pie at the Cheshire Cheese. But he had been
credibly informed that in New York you had to bathe every day,
which certainly meant pneumonia; that in London you met nothing but
lords, who addressed you, "Hy sye, old chappie;" and that in Paris
they spoke a funny language and danced in the street.</p>

<p>One satisfactory thing he did do. He bought the Sunset Trail
Hotel, so that he would not feel guilty of loafing about it all day
long in this time of depressing freedom, when it was his civic
duty, as the possessor or the possessed, of $7,000,000 to be free
whether he liked it or not.</p>

<p>Cordwood McGash, gently scratching, was sitting in front of the
Sunset Trail Hotel with Manny Ilgenfritz, the grocer, and Oley
Tengboom, the barber, that comfortable afternoon of June, 1933.
They were all smoking ten-cent cigars&mdash;as presented by Mr.
Cordwood McGash. It was an amiable scene, though not exhilarating.
Doc Berklund's English setter, Dick, slept in the dust in the
middle of the street. Two flivvers were parked across the way in
front of Cohen &amp; Cabot's, and Cordwood, Manny, and Oley argued
as to their owners. An hour later, they were rather stirred at
seeing a complete stranger, in an eight-cylinder 1933 model
Paracelsus with an Iowa license, stop for gas at the filling
station, but that Thracian ship and the foreign faces passed on and
there was nothing much to see in Jackrabbit Creek...not even for a
man who could write his check for $7,000,000.</p>

<p>"Well, nice day," said Mr. Ilgenfritz.</p>

<p>"Yump, nice day," said Mr. Tengbom.</p>

<p>"Pretty warm&mdash;even for this time of year," said Mr.
McGash.</p>

<p>Presently there were events of interest. Up Main Street drove
another flivver, containing&mdash;as the three men confidentially
explained to one another&mdash;Mart Klaupschnagel from south of
town. Repeal had not come yet, and they knew, and firmly stated,
that he was in town for the regular every-ten-day pint. They
watched him go into Doc Berklund's office, come out hiding small
papers in his hand, enter the Bendelari Drug Store, reappear with
an oblong package on which he gazed with pious fervor.</p>

<p>"Old Lady Klaupschnagel'll get her ears beat off tonight. Mart
certainly can handle the dames when he's full of bug-juice," said
Manny Ilgenfritz, enviously.</p>

<p>Then, unannounced by either Gabriel's trumpet or an A.P. flash,
the crack of doom happened to Cordwood McGash and to the
respectable hamlet of Jackrabbit Creek.</p>

<p>From the front entrance of the Sunset Trail Hotel came a
youngish gentleman in such garments as were known to Jackrabbit
only in advertisements: a belted jacket and plus fours the color of
dried grass, a cap to match, rimless eye-glasses on a black silk
cord, a blue pullover with canary-yellow buttons, black and blue
checked stockings, and low shoes of white buckskin and
golden-yellow uppers. The apparition removed its cap to rub its
head, and it was to be seen that he had a sound, dependable
baldness that suggested ledgers and adding-machines and a bank
account.</p>

<p>"By golly, if it ain't another of those philanthropists come to
let me in on a chance to make forty per cent," snarled Cordwood,
rage ruffling his calm like a squall on a mountain lake.</p>

<p>"Naw&mdash;forgot to tell you about him&mdash;dunno <i>how</i> I
forgot," said Oley, the barber. "That's Percy Willoughby. Born
here. Fine family. His dad was perfessor in the school
here&mdash;they left town before you boys ever
come&mdash;twenty-five years ago&mdash;guess Perce is about forty.
Oh, no, he's a real financier. Been working in a bank in
Milwaukee&mdash;cashier or president or something. Driving out to
Seattle, and just stopped over a day to see the old town...Hey,
Perce!"</p>

<p>Mr. Percy Willoughby sauntered over. His smile was benign, yet
it hinted of a mystic knowledge of bills of exchange. His voice was
a silver bell.</p>

<p>"Hello, Oley&mdash;want to shave a bum like me?"</p>

<p>"Sure. But say, Perce, here's a couple gennelmen you never knew
as a kid&mdash;Manny llgenfritz and Syl McGash&mdash;Cordwood
McGash."</p>

<p>Mr. Willoughby became swiftly grave; he became reverent; he
caroled, "Mr. McGash, I've heard of your magnificent success. It's
an honor to all of Jackrabbit."</p>

<p>But even as they shook hands, Cordwood raid doubtfully, "You
don't handle insurance?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed."</p>

<p>"Or any real estate that'll pay forty per cent?"</p>

<p>"Be glad to know of any that would pay a sure five!"</p>

<p>"Sit down!" begged Cordwood, with incredulous relief. "Say, just
passing through like you are, come have supper with me at Sister
Tinkerbun's tonight&mdash;six sharp."</p>

<p>"Delighted," said Mr. Percy Willoughby, in the manner of one man
of the world recognizing another&mdash;two English public schoolmen
meeting in the mountain fastnesses of Kipling...two Chicago bankers
meeting in Athens.</p>

<p>Afta persuading the Widow Tinkerbun that he wasn't really
criticizing her catering, after getting her to dry her tears and
shut up and listen, Cordwood arranged for his exotic guest, Mr.
Willoughby, a really sumptuous supper: cream of tomato soup,
chicken fricassee with dumplings, German fried potatoes, canned
com, and apple pie a la mode. Cordwood was rather silent throughout
the repast itself, listening sharply, his pale-blue eyes steady, to
Mr. Willoughby's entertainment of Mrs. Tinkerbun and the four other
boarders.</p>

<p>Percy&mdash;enough of this Willoughby, this mistering! Is Percy
not to be our friend, our very <i>deus ex machina</i> as he became
to Cordwood? Percy talked very well and listened fairly well. Of
Milwaukee banking he discoursed and all the strange, enchanted ways
of country dubs on the North Shore of Chicago. He explained all the
fallacies of the La Follette family and of Franklin Roosevelt. He
had been everywhere and done everything. He had graduated at
Beloit. He had met Samuel Insull and warned him of the danger of
public utilities. He had given Miss Katharine Cornell considerable
praise&mdash;along with some valuable adverse criticism&mdash;for
her playing in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street." He had told Al
Smith how to fill up the Empire State Building. He had practically
played polo at Del Monte&mdash;he would have played except that he
had wrenched his ankle. He had even been in Europe&mdash;none of
your ordinary four-week tours, but six entire weeks, exclusive of
steamer passage, covering England, Scotland, Ireland, France,
Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, Holland,
Belgium, and Luxemburg&mdash;which Cordwood had always supposed to
be either a city, a prime minister, or a drink, but which proved to
be a country.</p>

<p>But it was not Percy's educated and frequent words which
convinced Cordwood of his virtue as a man of the world, but his
garments.</p>

<p>For, though he was motoring and presumably not carrying a trunk,
Percy had for the fiesta at Sister Tinkerbun's changed from his
tweeds to a natty double-breasted blue suit with a white stripe
faint as a maiden's dream, a button-on stiff linen collar, an Old
Etonian tie, black shoes, and cream-colored spats.</p>

<p>"That's class!" reflected Cordwood. "But I wonder why he wears
the gaiters. Maybe he catches cold easy in the ankles."</p>

<p>Supper done, Cordwood invited Percy to smoke with him in his
suite, and a wink hinted that, safe from the piety of Widow
Tinkerbun, there might be something stronger than a cigar with
which to joy themselves. He wished that he could really utilize the
splendor of his six-room suite, but unless he sat in one bedroom
and Percy in another, he could see no way, and that would not be
very convenient for conversation. They sat in his principal
bedroom. Cord on the bed and Percy in the slightly lopsided 1901
Morris chair. (The room also contained a golden oak bureau, a pine
kitchen table covered with pansy-embroidered brocade, and a
depiction of a stag at bay.)</p>

<p>Cordwood poured out two bolts of forty-rod corn, and hinted,
"Well, I suppose you're going to have another big job, bank cashier
or something, in Seattle."</p>

<p>Percy coughed, looked at the glass of corn in hurt surprise that
it could do such a thing to him, then laughed with a gallant show
of frankness.</p>

<p>"I have no idea, Mr. McGash. Pure spec. Look here. The hometown
boys like to believe that I've been at least vice-president in
Milwaukee. I wasn't. I was private secretary and date-fixer and
general cook and bottle-washer to the president. And I was let out.
No fault of mine&mdash;they were cutting expenses&mdash;I'm a good
secretary. I can run anything from a conference of directors to a
charity bazaar or a trip to China. But I'm no coming Andy
Mellon!"</p>

<p>Cordwood liked that. If he had a guide and counsellor like
Percy&mdash;! The $7,000,000 that he had swallowed churned yeastily
within him.</p>

<p>"Hm. Suppose&mdash;if you got another secretary job, what would
you expect?"</p>

<p>"Eleven thousand five hundred dollars a year."</p>

<p>Now if Percy had said $3,000, Cordwood would have dismissed him
as not really touched with the magic gold of Milwaukee, New York,
and Paris. If it had been $20,000, he would have rejected such
excess.</p>

<p>"Suh-uh-spose you were to kind of stay around here for a while
and kind of steer me a little," he said, with what he felt to be
tremendous craftiness.</p>

<p>Little fish, struggle no longer!</p>

<p>On his third day as secretary to Mr. Cordwood McGash, Percy
suggested, "Look, sir. I've been thinking: You're not really
comfortable here. Why not take the McMullen Mansion!"</p>

<p>"Too big! Couldn't face furnishing it."</p>

<p>"I'll furnish it for you. Did the Big Chief's flat, in
Milwaukee."</p>

<p>"Couldn't desert Mrs. Tinkerbun. She depends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take her along as housekeeper. And we'll get a good cook and
two maids and a chauffeur."</p>

<p>"Three hired girls? Besides Sister Tinkerbun?"</p>

<p>"Then you can have parties every night. Private bar. Play cards.
Open house for all your friends. And have the chaps you knew in the
lumber country come stay with you&mdash;weeks at a time if you feel
like it."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be so bad," mused the victim of freedom and of
Sister Tinkerbun's geologic mattresses. He felt like a child who
has just been asked whether he could conveniently try some ice
cream.</p>

<p>The McMullen Mansion was the largest house in town. It had been
built by the owner of lumber mills, now gone with the passing of
lumbering, and it had been deserted for ten years. It had sixteen
rooms, which made it, far Jackrabbit Creek, rather larger than
Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>Cordwood rented it. He wanted to buy it, but Percy said,
laughing merrily, "Try it first. Who knows? Year from now, we may
be on the Riviera!" And such was Percy's power, already, that
Cordwood snarled only a little as he retorted, "Yes, and we may be
in hell!"</p>

<p>Percy led him then to Minneapolis for furniture, but before they
sneaked away, Mrs. Maybelle Benner firmly entered the scene.</p>

<p>Now among all the dignitaries of Jackrabbit Creek, including
even Mr. Scallion, the banker, the Reverend Mr. Mitch, and the
fortuitously important Cordwood, none was more significant than
Mrs. Benner. She was, at forty, widow of the redoubtable Henry
Simkins Benner, editor of <i>The Star and Tidings</i>. She was
principal of the Junior High School, town librarian, president and
chairman of the program committee of the Sorosis Club, and past
Grand Matron of the Order of the Eastern Star. She represented
Music, Literature, Scholarship, and Respectability and what made
her most esteemed of all, she had a family income of twelve hundred
dollars a year. She came from Hartford, Connecticut, and it was
frequently stated in Jackrabbit that she was related to all the
aristocracy of Hartford and Farmington.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maybelle Benner's lips were a little thin, but she had
perfect teeth and behind the glare of her eyeglasses her eyes were
cheerful.</p>

<p>Cordwood McGash regarded her as a combination of Queen Mary and
a lady baseball player. He admired her as he admired the North Pole
or the international credit system, reverently but
platonically.</p>

<p>Mrs. Benner firmly called upon him at Mrs. Tinkerbun's and
observed, "Mr. McGash&mdash;" Only twenty-six persons in Jackrabbit
called him anything but "Cordwood," and the other twenty-five were
infants under two years of age. "Mr. McGash, I feel it my duty as a
fellow citizen to warn you that this Willoughby fellow is going to
lead you into ways of recklessness&mdash;not that, I imagine, you
need much leading. He is taking you to Minneapolis with all its
dens of vice and pool rooms. You will return carrying a cane, and
maybe a silk hat."</p>

<p>Then all the manhood of Jackrabbit's best wrestler and horseshoe
pitcher arose within him. "Ma'am, Perce is my friend, as I hope you
are, too, and I don't never let nobody jump on none of my friends,
never!"</p>

<p>He looked at her coldly, and for the first time Maybelle seemed
to discover that he was something more than a case history. She
actually blushed a little, and her voice was considerably softer as
she murmured, "Well, I just wanted to warn you. You know we all
look up to you as our leader here."</p>

<p>For hours Cordwood went around swelling at the totally new
notion that he was the leader of the community. And now that it had
been suggested to him, by golly, he <i>would</i> come back with a
cane and a silk hat!</p>

<p>But in Minneapolis Percy Willoughby wouldn't let him. He also
forbade spats, a monocle, and a stock. "I," said Percy, "can wear
all the agony I want to. I'm nothing but a secretary. But you're a
man of property and you've got to look conservative&mdash;and then
you won't have to worry about <i>being</i> conservative." Between
spasms of buying furniture for the McMullen Mansion, he led
Cordwood to a tailor and had made for him four suits of soft greys
and browns and blues.</p>

<p>"Me with seven millions, and neither Maybelle or Perce will let
me wear anything really nice and swell," lamented Cordwood.</p>

<p>But Cordwood admitted that Percy made over the McMullen house
into the pleasantest house he had ever seen. He particularly liked
the private bar and the electric range, though he continued to be
jumpy in his bathroom, which had a pink marble tub with gilded
taps, black marble floors and walls, a gilt ceiling, and an
enormous full length mirror, which caused Cordwood to blush and
itch every time be saw the immodest spectacle of himself with a
bath towel.</p>

<p>And the bills came to $30,000.</p>

<p>One of the smaller downstairs rooms Percy had made into an
office for himself. It was so much simpler than the rest of the
house that Cordwood liked to hang out there, though be felt guilty
about it&mdash;a bum like himself interrupting a business man like
Percy Willoughby. While Percy was out interviewing bootleggers one
day just after the house was furnished, Cordwood sat in the office
admiringly leafing through the bills for the house. And among them
he found a letter far Percy stating that Messrs. Wombat were
pleased to send Percy herewith their check for his commission of
ten per cent on his purchases for S. G. McGash, Esq.</p>

<p>It wasn't that he had been cheated of about $3,000 that sickened
Cordwood. It was that he would have to fire Percy and again be an
orphan in the horrible forest of seven million, even now minus only
thirty or forty thousand. He sat a long while, close to
weeping.</p>

<p>Percy marched in, whistling softly, looked once at Cordwood and
the bills before him, and said cheerily, "I've rounded up ten cases
of Bourbon that's pretty nearly drinkable, at a hundred a
case&mdash;shall I pay him the thousand? Oh, that reminds me, I owe
you about three thousand dollars, Chief."</p>

<p>"Heh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I stuck all these furniture people and decorators a
commission of ten per cent&mdash;with the agreement, though, that
they weren't to raise the price. My graft has about all come in
now, and of course I've always intended to hand it back to
you."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my boy!" said Cordwood. "You keep it! I'm glad you
stung ''em, the pirates! But it's all yours. You made it."</p>

<p>Now that he saw that Percy was almost fantastically honest,
Cordwood's heart was again a little singing bird.</p>

<p>He began to live. There were magnificent parties at the mansion.
Till four in the morning, lumbermen in black and red checked shirts
could be heard, with that dolorousness which is the fine flavor of
ecstasy, assuring the world that "We shall meet but we shall
missum, there will be one vacant chair," or demanding, "And w'en I
die, don' bury me tall, jus' pickle my bones in al-co-HOL." The
mansion would probably have had a bad name and even
Cordwood&mdash;or rather, even $6,900,000&mdash;would have been
boycotted by all the pious of Jackrabbit except that, without even
asking Cordwood about it, Percy invited both the Sorosis Club and
the Ladies' Musical Guild to meet at the mansion, and for these
meetings he provided tea and cocoa and such sandwiches as
Jackrabbit had never seen&mdash;with anchovy paste, with chutney,
with ginger, with salmon and lobster.</p>

<p>And Percy bullied Cordwood into addressing the Men's Bible Class
at the Rev. Mr. Mitch's church on "The Principles of Success."
Percy also wrote the speech, in which Cordwood was made to say that
he attributed all his success to frugality, to having, singularly,
had a mother, and to having attended Sunday School back in Vermont.
It concluded, "I am proud to say, I have a university degree. Most
of you didn't know that, did you? Well, I have&mdash;but it came
from the University of Hard Knocks!"</p>

<p>No one could believe that so good and pious a man ever served
hard licker, so that Cordwood both had the <i>baba au rhum</i> and
ate it, till the gods in conclave muttered, "What? There is a happy
mortal? Wait, we'll do something about <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>All that winter of 1933-34, Cordwood had only one real
woe&mdash;in the embarrassing matter of the chauffeurs. With
Percy's consent, even encouragement, he had bought a sixteen
cylinder limousine, along with a smaller sedan, and a neat $4,000
"job" for Percy's private use. Cordwood longed for the most
beautiful possession he had noted in Minneapolis: a uniformed
chauffeur, and the Percy who had forbidden him spats generously
approved Cordwood's having a chauffeur.</p>

<p>The first one was a frosty Britisher who had, he admitted,
driven for the Best Families. On the first night of his servitude,
he was offended by Cordwood's jovially nicknaming him "Limey." The
second night, at Manny Ilgenfritz's, the chauffeur was horrified by
having his employer stand out on the porch and bellow to the
midnight quiet of Jackrabbit, "Hey Limey, old socks, come on in and
sit in on this poker game. We need another hand."</p>

<p>The Britisher took the nine o'clock train next morning.</p>

<p>His successor was different. On <i>his</i> second night, when he
was driving Cordwood and Percy back from a stylish and unalcoholic
evening at the residence of Mr. Scallion, the banker, this
successor seemed to have difficulty in starting the car; there was
a scent about the streets as though too much alcohol had been
poured into the radiator, and when Cordwood hinted that he drive
more slowly, the driver turned and said affectionately, "Sure,
Cordy, if you and Perce want to go like a hay wagon, it's all right
by me. Rall friends together, heh?"</p>

<p>And <i>he</i> took the next morning's nine o'clock train, and
after that Cordwood solemnly sat up in front and drove his own
limousine, frequently with Percy in the back.</p>

<p>But by spring Cordwood was too used to his fine house and fine
communal drunks to be excited by them, and he still had $6,880,000.
He wanted to do something entirely new, and he dared not ask Percy
for suggestions. Percy might yank him off to a New York apartment,
or a cutely villa at Coney Island&mdash;which spot Cordwood assumed
to be, along with Atlantic City and Newport, the most resplendent
but starchily correct of all summer resorts.</p>

<p>Then Les Doggins, whom Cordwood had sent to Paris, theoretically
to study the violin, began to write extensive letters, instead of
mere post cards. It is true that the fifth letter gave a hint that
something besides affection for Cordwood inspired him, that he
wanted to put over the message that it would be a good idea for
Cordwood to double his allowance. But his first four effusions
positively glowed, and warmed Cordwood's imagination by their
descriptions of Paris. It seemed that all portions of
Paris&mdash;though it was true, explained Les, that he himself was
practising eighteen hours a day and rarely saw them
personally&mdash;were jammed with beautiful cafes, where champagne
cost two cents a glass, where ravishingly beautiful maidens, called
<i>cocottes</i>, yearned for a chance to talk to True Americans
like Cordwood, and where celebrated English explorers and lords and
business magnates were flattered to tears when addressed by a man
like Cordwood and filled with longing to tell him even better
stories than he had ever heard in a lumber camp.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come over, with some of your buddies? I'll show
you the town," suggested Les Doggins.</p>

<p>Cordwood meditated that he'd kinda like to do that. But he also
meditated that he couldn't desert Jackrabbit, when all his friends
depended on him for a good time.</p>

<p>Then, like Keats conceiving "The Eve of St. Agnes," he had his
one sudden, sun-smitten stroke of genius.</p>

<p>Why not go to Paris and take the whole town with him?</p>

<p>That was something no other millionaire had ever thought of!</p>

<p>He was afraid at first to risk his one dear jewel of imagination
to the acid of Percy Willoughby, often and firmly though he assured
himself, "That's my business, I'm not asking Perce's permission.
Who does he think he is? Maybelle Benner or somebody?"</p>

<p>It took him four days to raise the courage and tell his
inspiration to Percy; his plan to hire private trains, hire an
entire steamer, and take as many of the inhabitants of Jackrabbit
as could get away to Paris, Rome, and London.</p>

<p>Percy listened patiently, and patiently he reasoned, "Yes, it
sounds like a great shindig, Chief, but I'm afraid it would be
impossible&mdash;so many people&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know, Perce. And of course there'd be the handling of
an awful lot of money every day, and I couldn't ask you to take all
that responsibility. I thought you might stay here, and I'd hire a
kind of treasurer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes." Into Percy's eyes came a cloudy dream of poetry. "Yes,
there would have to be a lot of ready cash. I'd better go along. I
don't quite trust anybody else. Yes. Shall we start in June?"</p>

<p>As easy as that.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>When he went out, all innocence and glee, to inform his fellow
townsmen what he was going to do for them, Cordwood was bewildered
to find that they weren't as excited about suddenly picking up and
going to Paris as he was. He was a wanderer, chickless and
childless, even if not Percyless, while they had familiar homes,
wives, children, jobs. They liked to be able to find their slippers
or the bathroom in the dark. He had to argue with them, to persuade
them that they really would like it. But he was not altogether
without craft.</p>

<p>He explained to Mrs. Maybelle Benner that they would all enjoy
the treasures of Art and Architecture for which Paris was, and
justly, so celebrated; he warmly pictured the entire expedition,
particularly himself, as spending all its Parisian afternoons and
evenings in following professors about and being lectured at about
painters and the Helmet of Navarre. (He remembered that there had
been some Frog named Navarre&mdash;quite a long while ago, he
believed&mdash;and that he had had a helmet, for some fool reason
or other.) Maybelle Benner seemed very much pleased about Navarre
and his helmet.</p>

<p>Then Cordwood convinced Oley Tengbom, Manny Ilgenfritz, Sime
Bendelari, and Milt Cohen that they would spend all their
afternoons and evenings, under the inspiriting guidance of Les
Doggins, in lapping up strange and peculiarly excellent sorts of
licker&mdash;arrack and akivit and vodka.</p>

<p>To Mr. Scallion, the banker, and Mr. Mitch he hinted that his
dearest desire was to make a serious study of the financial,
religious, and educational systems of France&mdash;if there were
any such systems in so barbarous a land.</p>

<p>Now there were but few persons in Jackrabbit who had ever been
abroad. Oh, of course there were three or four hundred who had been
<i>born</i> in Europe, and lived there from five to thirty years,
but they were merely foreigners, and didn't count as people who
could go over and understand Europe. The real Americans, the people
who had some right to travel and investigate, began to ponder
gravely on Cordwood's offer, and after a week he held a
mass-meeting to which every inhabitant of Jackrabbit was
invited.</p>

<p>Cordwood ruggedly gave the invitation to his proprietary
crusade, but it was Percy Willoughby who, with elegance, anecdotes,
a dinner jacket, and tasteful references to the American Eagle, the
Pilgrim Fathers, and Lafayette, really outlined the plan. Special
trains. Chartered steamer. Sightseeing in New York. Respectable
hotels in Paris&mdash;i.e., those in which all servants spoke
American. To go in summer, when the children would be out of
school&mdash;the children, God bless them, whose little prattling
voices were the sweetest music this side o' Paradise. (It is
probable that Percy forgot that, as far as was known, neither he
nor Cordwood had any children to prattle.) Experts to be brought
from the Twin Cities to care for the town and all necessary
business while the citizenry were away. The noble Mr. McGash to pay
all expenses, including tips&mdash;no one need spend a cent except
for such presents as he might care to bring home. Office now
established downstairs, under the expert guidance of Miss Minnie
Berklund, and all who wished to take the trip please hurry and
register with her, first come to get best accommodations on trains
and steamer, and he wished to thank them one and all and to
express&mdash;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by Ben Pilshaw of the feed store, who wanted
them to give three cheers for good ole Cordwood McGash. They did,
even the Reverend Mr. Mitch.</p>

<p>Some were sick, some could not leave their posts, as doctors or
powerhouse engineers or post-office employees or railroaders, some
were afraid, some plain did not want to go, but out of the 1231
permanent inhabitants of Jackrabbit Creek. 887 persons did actually
register for this gaudy chance of a lifetime, and accompany
Cordwood&mdash;and Perce&mdash;on the European spree.</p>

<p>As commandant and general fixer of the town while the
inhabitants were away, Percy brought in a man for whom, he
admitted, he had an almost prayerful respect; one Colonel Blight,
who had been a soldier, a policeman, a banker, a stock broker, and
the city manager of Septemia, Ohio. Cordwood was vaguely astonished
that a colonel could look so much like a colonel as Colonel Blight
did. He had it all&mdash;the broad shoulders and slim waist, the
white hair and small white mustache, the port complexion, the
hearty voice, the ability, and extreme willingness, to tell what he
had said to Pershing and Lady Astor. After the good colonel, came
an entire corps of persons skilled to guard property, extinguish
fires, answer mail, forward mail.</p>

<p>They were needed even before the caravan took the golden road to
Samarkand. Now that they had committed themselves to helping
Cordwood spend his money, most of the citizenry felt that he was
thereby obligated to heal all their troubles, spiritual and
temporal, so that they might start off blithely. He was expected to
pay up all mortgage interest for at least two years ahead&mdash;and
most of the mortgagees thought it would be all right if he paid off
the mortgages entirely and, if he wanted to, he could burn the
documents up and forget them. Three persons wanted to have slight
operations&mdash;to be arranged and paid for by Cordwood&mdash;and
sixteen wanted their teeth put in shape, and they spoke to
Cordwood, sadly or angrily, as though he might just as well admit
that it was he who had done dirt to their teeth in the first place.
One lady wanted to know if he would mind, personally, escorting her
seven grandchildren to an aunt's, in Waco, Texas&mdash;which, she
said brightly smiling, would make her <i>ever</i> so much more free
on the junket&mdash;and one wanted him to telephone over to Paris
to arrange for her taking a complete course in voice culture during
the three weeks there.</p>

<p>Percy and Colonel Blight and their aides perspiringly did their
best to handle these details for Cordwood but, curiously, most of
the suppliants wanted to see Cordwood himself. They complained that
Perce and the colonel viciously denied such reasonable complaints
as sending to the poor farm at Tallahassee, Florida, for poor Aunt
Ethelberta, so that (though the dear old thing had never seen
Jackrabbit Creek) she might go along on the tour. "Now, Mr
Willoughby, that's so <i>thoughtless</i> of you! It would give
Aunty so much pleasure."</p>

<p>Cordwood was learning, as Percy had long since learned, that
when any one says to you, "Oh, do that&mdash;it would give her so
much pleasure," then that is something most vigorously not to
do.</p>

<p>It was surprising how much of the current $6,870,000 Cordwood
was going to get rid of. He had, before inviting the town,
neglected to learn how much it would cost to charter a de luxe
liner. It would cost, he found, about $25,000 a day, six days to
the crossing and landing included, for a steamer like
<i>Dipsomania</i>, aside from tips, drinks, and the entertainers
whom he was determined to hire in New York. Four hundred thousand
dollars might see the ocean part of the journey, both ways, paid
for, but Perce reminded him that he must not be optimistic.</p>

<p>And so Cordwood signed checks, and signed, and signed, and from
7 a.m. till after midnight daily he listened to neighbors who
wanted him to settle their brother-in-laws' debts or their wives'
tempers or their digestions before the sailing&mdash;and Cordwood
had considerably less fun out of being a millionaire and a public
benefactor than he had ever had in his life.</p>

<p>But things got settled. Perce was a pattern of energy and
precision. Colonel Blight a master of diplomacy and executiveness,
and Cordwood too much of a kind-hearted damned fool to believe it
even when he knew he was miserable, and two weeks before sailing,
practically every one of the crusaders seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>And just then Trouble personified staggered down from the
hills.</p>

<p>A year before, Mr. Bat Badger, lumberjack and teamster, had been
incomparably the highest-ranking Town Drunk in Jackrabbit Creek. In
a lively, unmalicious way, he had gone fishing in the courthouse
fountain, chased the night policeman with an unloaded revolver and,
during a particularly durable hangover, tried to lead the singing
in Mr. Mitch's church, with the misconception that the congregation
were caroling "Little Brown Gal" instead of "The Little Brown
Church in the Wildwood." Cordwood had raised&mdash;that is, had
contributed&mdash;a handsome purse to assist his friend Bat Badger
to get out of town, quick, and go live with his farmer
son-in-law.</p>

<p>Now Bat was suddenly returned&mdash;you needed no newspaper to
learn of it&mdash;and he was announcing to gratified throngs in the
town's one saloon that he was delighted to join Cordwood's party
and show the Frogs and Dagoes what a real two-fisted He-American
could do in the way of serious drinking. He had always wanted to go
to sea, he explained, and he was planning to bunk with the captain
of the liner. Sure he could, if he wanted to, couldn't he? Wasn't
he 'nole friend of Cordwood's and didn't Cordwood own the boat? Let
any high-toned captain try to get fresh with <i>him</i>! And now
would all the boys join him in lil drink, to be charged to his
friend Cordwood?</p>

<p>The bartender wearily requested Bat to go out and soak his head
or, preferably, go climb a tree. Bat was hurt. He was shocked. He
threw at the bartender a glass which broke the mirror. He awoke in
an alley, muttering in a youthful, plaintive way, "Well I'll be
dog-gone!" and arose to waver, slantwise, toward his friend
Cordwood, to tell him of this cruel misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Already, Maybelle Benner, Mr. Scallion, and Mr. Mitch had come,
as one man, to Cordwood's office, and squealed, "If that horrible
scoundrel Badger goes on this tour, neither we nor any other
respectable person in town will go!"</p>

<p>Cordwood looked weary. There had been a time when he had shared
a blanket and a pint with Bat Badger. Percy warbled, "It's all
arranged, Mrs. Benner. Of course Mr. Badger is not to go. Mr.
McGash and I were conferring about that, just as you came in."</p>

<p>The reformers marched beamingly out, in time to meet Bat Badger
on the steps.</p>

<p>"You bad man, you get right out of town! And you're not going to
Europe with us!" rejoiced Mrs. Benner.</p>

<p>"Three jackasses, all in a row. 'Tain't true. Jus' 'nother
mirage! Visyums like this hard on pore lone prospector!" said Mr.
Badger.</p>

<p>He entered the office, after some difficulty in finding on which
side of the door post the door was. Cordwood hailed him with
dubious heartiness.</p>

<p>"Well, well, if it ain't old Bat! Well,
well&mdash;<i>well!</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Badger fumblingly sank into a chair. He said not a word. He
merely shook his wicked old head&mdash;his greasy cap and sunset
nose and brushwood-scattered chin&mdash;shook it slowly and
rebukingly, and wagged a knowing but smeary forefinger.</p>

<p>"Come up to the house and have a drink, old fella!" said
Cordwood, hollowly.</p>

<p>Mr. Badger went on shaking his head and his forefinger in
saddened disillusion, looking at this viper he had now thrust forth
from his bosom.</p>

<p>"How's your daughter and your son-in-law? Folks all fine?"
croaked Cordwood.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Badger gloomily gave voice: "Phar'see!"</p>

<p>"Who's a Pharisee?"</p>

<p>"Who's Phar'see? You're Phar'see!"</p>

<p>"Me? A Pharisee!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you! Whaz Good Book say? Proggle Son comes home. Whaz he
get? Gets fatted leg of lamb. I'm Proggle Son. What do I get? Get
Maybelle Benner! Phar'see. Quit drinking, that's what you done.
Snooty to old friend Bat. Pore old Bat Badger!"</p>

<p>And Mr. Badger shook his palsied head again, gently weeping.</p>

<p>"No, no, Bat! That's a dog-gone lie. I'm just as good a drinker
as I ever was. Come on up home. I'll prove it. I'm no Pharisee. I'm
a good drinking man."</p>

<p>He got Bat into the back of the limousine, where Bat lighted the
butt of a cigar and looked loftily out at the canaille, winking at
the girls, white Cordwood meekly drove in front. At the mansion,
Bat suddenly exhibited the most offensive trick in all his amiably
contrary career. He wouldn't, no, no matter how much his host
begged him, he wouldn't take a single drink of Cordwood's excellent
whisky. This was as unexpected as Hitler's refusing an Imperial
crown, and the not unresourceful Cordwood was helpless. In the
style of a small boy running to his mother with a hurt finger,
Cordwood thought of telephoning for Percy, for good old Colonel
Blight. But he felt too helpless, under the spell of Bat, who was
slumped in a leather armchair accusingly shaking his head and
muttering, "Phar'see! Never drink Pharisee's licker. Not if I
starve!"</p>

<p>"Look, old man! I'll show you how much of a Pharisee I am!
Lookit, the way I drink!" Cordwood poured out half a tumblerful of
rye and tossed it off. "See? Now come on! Drink up! And I got a
swell new story for you. Mrs. Benner? Why, she hates me like rat
poison. Come on now, drink up!"</p>

<p>"Phar'see!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come on! I&mdash;uh&mdash;I been too busy lately to do much
drinking, but with an old buddy like you&mdash;Look, I'm taking
another!"</p>

<p>So it was that Percy returned, with Colonel Blight, to find
Cordwood completely passed out, while Bat still sat soberly
croaking at the near-corpse, "Phar'see! Benners! All
Phar'sees!"</p>

<p>Percy and the colonel gently led Bat outside. Expertly frisking
him, the colonel found that Bat had not carried his prejudice
against the false wine cups of the Pharisee too far. He removed two
bottles of rye and one of gin from Bat's outer coat pockets, a
bottle of Scotch from his inside pocket, and eight Corona Coronas
and three miniature bottles of cordials from his vest. Colonel
Blight murmured something then to Percy, and Percy laughed.</p>

<p>When Cordwood struggled into an agonized wakefulness, in his own
bed, with Percy beside him ready with the aspirin and wet towel, he
groaned, "Not a Pharisee! Where's Bat?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I took the liberty of&mdash;I think Mr. Badger will be
quite happy; probably much happier than in Paris. I have arranged
with young Mr. Knute Tieplowitz to take Mr. Badger on a somewhat
extensive tour&mdash;in fact, to San Diego. I ventured to entrust
Knute with enough money to keep Mr. Badger quite drunk and happy
the entire way. They have been gone now for some hours. I do not
think Mr. Badger will change his mind. Tieplowitz is a charming
companion, and he will be glad to sing duets with Mr. Badger, but
also he was boxing champion in the Agricultural College."</p>

<p>"Say, couldn't you grab the whole six million or whatever there
is left now, and take this whole business over? I guess I could
still get a job clerking."</p>

<p>"Well, not the whole of it," said Percy, with a curious
meditativeness.</p>

<p>Such was the innocence of Mr. Cordwood McGash that he was
astonished when the reporters began to drop into town&mdash;from
Duluth, from St. Paul and Minneapolis, the nearest A. P. and U. P.
correspondents and even one roving reporter from Chicago. They
found it odd and a little unbelievable that a millionaire should
want to take a whole town to Europe, and with pleasant cynicism
they wanted to know&mdash;not necessarily for
publication&mdash;just what he was really up to. They found it
odder that apparently he really wasn't hunting publicity and that
he should be astonished, and considerably pleased, at having his
picture in the papers. They were a cheerful party. Cordwood put
them all up at the mansion, and kept a bartender on duty all night,
and probably not since the arrival of Wilson in Paris had quite
such a flock of adulatory stories burned the wires.</p>

<p>Cordwood was a Modest Man of Millions, A Mystery Millionaire, a
Rival to Death Valley Scotty. And after a certain night during
which Cordwood had enthusiastically led them in the rendition of
"Frankie and Johnny"&mdash;standing on the huge limestone
mantelpiece, to which willing journalistic hands had helped
him&mdash;it was also communicated that in his youth he had longed
to study music, that he had gone forth into the world only to help
his family, all orphans, that in music he was the equal of the late
Secretary Woodin, and that his purpose in taking his neighbors to
Europe was to enable them to listen to the best music.</p>

<p>That same night the local Jackrabbit reporter asked about
Cordwood's willingness to become governor of the state.</p>

<p>Well, that would be all right, thought Cordwood.</p>

<p>The Duluth reporter&mdash;and quite seriously, because by now
Cordwood really had very good Scotch&mdash;asked about his going on
to the presidency.</p>

<p>No, Cordwood didn't think he was fitted for that. And he
understood that in Washington you had to wear a dress suit every
evening.</p>

<p>Here he tiptoed to the hall door, looked about cautiously, made
sure that his secretary was not in sight, motioned the reporters to
gather close, and croaked, "Gotta dresh shuit. Perce gomme dresh
shuit. Minn'ap'lus. Don't <i>like</i> it!"</p>

<p>Neither did they, they all assured him, and at last he felt
happy again; felt that it was a fine thing to have so many millions
and so many friends.</p>

<p>Especially was it comforting to have so loyal a supporter as
Percy Willoughby. For the actual journey it would be necessary to
carry some tens of thousands of dollars in cash. Cordwood had
begged Percy to take charge of this. Percy had
hesitated&mdash;after all, he put it, how could Mr. McGash know
that he would not pocket most of it? When Cordwood had got over
being shocked by the hint that a friend of his could do such a
thing, Percy reluctantly took the enormous pile of new bills and
slipped them into his bureau drawer. But, he insisted, he would
give the Chief an accounting of every penny he spent...give it to
him just as soon as the crusade was over.</p>

<p>Naturally, to the authentic inhabitants of Jackrabbit, Cordwood
had added a few dozen old friends from the lumber camps, and 911
adventurers finally filled the two-section special train for the
journey to New York and the R. M. S. <i>Dipsomania</i>.</p>

<p>Practically all the three hundred odd people who were left
behind, with hundreds of farmers from the neighborhood, jammed the
station and alt the railroad yards. No departure of a troop train
ever saw more weeping, more blanching of cheeks, more piling of
suit-cases upon Gladstone bags, nor half so much of screaming, "Oh,
I've lost my baby's go-cart" and "That's nothing! We've lost our
baby!" A hundred times a minute, people screamed, "Now be sure and
write!" and, "Don't take any wooden money!" and, "Bring me back one
of them French chorus girls!" Veteran conductors of the G.N.P.R.R.
grew hoarse and helpless as they begged. "All aboard, please! All
aboard!" A strange swarthy man with a peanut roaster did enormous
business. For some reason almost every one except Percy Willoughby
seemed to feel that peanuts were exactly the thing to ward off the
perils of the journey. On the roof of the station, Colonel Blight
suddenly appeared, and in a voice which would have routed a
considerable enemy he bellowed, "Come on, now, everybody, three
cheers and a tiger for good old Cordwood McGash!"</p>

<p>They massed on the platform and beyond. But through the
bee-swarm of hysterical exiles cleaved first a bugle note, then a
rank of men in uniforms of plumed brass helmets, red tunics with
gilded Sam Brown belts, yellow breeches with green stripes, cavalry
boots&mdash;the Jackrabbit Creek Band and bugle Corps, playing
"Happy Days Are Here Again." They marched gravely the length of the
platform, back again, then into the first section of the train.</p>

<p>Percy, standing beside Cordwood, protested, "You're not taking
the band along&mdash;to Europe?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" beamed Cordwood.</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;I didn't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it's a little surprise for you and all the folks. I guess
the band'll show the folks in New York and Paris&mdash;Hope I can
fix it so we can have a parade up Fifth Avenue&mdash;the whole
bunch of us marching behind the band!"</p>

<p>Percy sighed. Then, as his fingers touched a bundle of hundred
dollar bills in his pocket, he brightened.</p>

<p>It was Cordwood who was a little sad as the two sections of the
train did actually get into motion and he looked at the outskirts
of Jackrabbit, at the well-beloved loafing places&mdash;the
gasoline tanks, the stock pens, the lumber yard, the wholesale
grocery warehouse, the beaten earth before tarpaper shacks, where
year on year he had squatted in the dust with Old Timers and told
tall lies and passed pints of corn from lip to lip. Would he ever
see them again? Paris might be prettier, but he bet himself that it
wouldn't have any kindlier a glow to it than this rusty-red wheat
elevator in the prairie sunshine.</p>

<p>Percy, in a drawing-room decorated with check-books, portable
typewriters, and bottles of champagne, was in charge of the second
section of the train; Cordwood in charge of the first. And into
Cordwood's car he had somewhat guiltily sneaked his best friends
and drinking-companions: Emmanuel Ilgenfritz and his family, Oley
Tengbom and what Jackrabbit suspected to be somebody else's family,
Doc Berklund, Sime Bendelari. He would have liked the Minervan
radiance of Maybelle Benner, but he felt that she would not really
understand, in the matter of Scotch.</p>

<p>Cordwood had assigned to himself an upper berth, explaining to
Percy that he didn't want any one to feel slighted. In Drawing Room
A, he had put his housekeeper, Sister Tinkerbun, and one of his
three "hired girls." All the way to New York there was quivering
scandal about this, and the only question was whether Cordwood was
criminally carrying on with Sister Tinkerbun, who was nine years
his senior, or the hired girl, who was twenty-two years his junior.
Whichever it might be, the entire caravan felt with a not
unpleasing horror that already, with their own host, they were
beginning to sniff the wickedness of Paris.</p>

<p>In Drawing Room B were Sime Bendelari, apothecarian bachelor and
man-about-village, and the reporter from Duluth.</p>

<p>It seemed that on one particularly white night at the mansion,
Cordwood had invited the Duluth reporter to go along. Cordwood
didn't remember the invitation, but he had learned many years
before that on the morning after, it was better not to inquire too
curiously into what he might have said after midnight. Anyway, the
Duluth reporter was a lovely fellow, and it was a good thing to
have a contact man for the press. He did not know, and he never
afterward learned, that the young gentleman from Duluth had been
fired by wire, after ignoring four commands from his paper to come
home.</p>

<p>This Drawing Room B was Cordwood's refuge all the way to New
York. He was very happy there. He lost $116.50 at poker, and he was
often allowed to sing. He was the gladder of the refuge when,
within an hour after the train had left Jackrabbit, he learned the
real characters of little Irving Berklund and of Magnolia
Ilgenfritz, the hell-child.</p>

<p>No one knows the nature of the Little Ones until he has seen
them relieving the tedium of a train journey. After he has seen
them thus, he realizes that Calvin was absolutely right: that
infant damnation is not only just but highly agreeable. Cordwood
had beheld Irving and Magnolia as normal children, who were
prettily grateful for bags of candy and who had no disagreeable
traits whatever, except perhaps yelping a good deal, throwing
stones at windshields, and secreting dead kittens in one's overcoat
pockets. But the magic of travel was upon them now, and it revealed
the Little Ones as complete demons. They chased each other through
the aisle. They had a game of tag in which the goals were the
shrinking knees of the older passengers. Irving brought from the
observation car a ponderous brass ash-tray, and with this Magnolia
and he played catch, while the adults, their faces furrowed with
agony, crouched in their seats, and the cowardly Cordwood, though
he admitted that he was responsible for these horrors, fled into
Drawing Room B and demanded a drink.</p>

<p>At St. Paul and Minneapolis, there were hundreds of spectators,
with reporters ranging from the financial editors, who desired to
know Cordwood's views on the Latvian bond situation, to the
religious editors, who demanded of the frightened Rev. Mr. Mitch
whether it was true that he was going to hold services in Notre
Dame de Paris. But it was in Chicago that Cordwood really got into
the news.</p>

<p>The trains were met by eighteen reporters, nineteen press-camera
and movie-camera and sound-picture men, and more than a thousand
laymen. Percy had, at Cordwood's insistence, rather sulkily
telegraphed ahead to get police permission for a parade up State
Street, during the six hours when the Jackrabbitites were to study
the economics, ethnology, art treasures, and bars of Chicago.
Gleefully the drum major whirled and caught his stick, at the head
of the procession. Gleefully the troubadours of Jackrabbit whammed
the drum and tootled the fife and blared on the comet, as they
crashed into such novelties as "The Washington Post" and "There'll
Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight." Gleefully Cordwood and a
hundred other male stalwarts trudged at the rear, waving large
pennants painted with pink wild roses and the valiant words,
"Jackrabbit Creek. Biggest Small Town in U. S. A."</p>

<p>And gleefully the simple citizenry of Chicago received them.</p>

<p>The Chicagoans filled the sidewalks, snickering. Small boys by
the hundred stalked beside the parade or followed it, imitating the
marchers. Press photographers snapped it at each corner. And,
starting nowhere in particular, rising along each block, increasing
to a thunder-storm, rose the derisive cheer, "Hurray for the
Jackrabbits!"</p>

<p>Cordwood was enchanted&mdash;for three blocks. He wished that
his friend Percy had not, poor fellow, had to remain at the train;
that Percy might have seen this rare, lovely tribute to true
American democracy. He began then to wonder if the small boys
marching beside them weren't, as they stuck out their little
bellies and arched their arms and waggled their heads, just a
little making mock of the procession. A quick, nauseating suspicion
swamped him. He stared, then he glared at the crowds on the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>"My God, they're not cheering us&mdash;they're kidding us! They
think we're goats!" he trembled.</p>

<p>All the dreadful twenty blocks up State Street and back to the
station, he marched sturdily, shoulders back, not once looking at
the jeerers. But at the station he called the band-leader to him
and said softly, "Pete, I'm sorrier 'n the dickens, but these
big-town hellions think we're just hicks. They think we're funny.
We won't have no more parades, nowhere, and no more band music. You
boys just put up your instruments and enjoy yourselves, rest of the
trip."</p>

<p>Pete Klopot&mdash;by vocation a paper-hanger but spiritually a
brother of Mozart&mdash;snapped, "Hey? What's that? You mean we
ain't to march up Fifth Avenue, like you promised, and not in
Paris, France?"</p>

<p>"Nope. No can do." Cordwood's lips were unwontedly thinned.</p>

<p>"Then by God&mdash;you've cheated us! You'll pay our fares back
to Jackrabbit, and you'll pay for our time&mdash;''</p>

<p>"I certainly will! Here, you, Red Cap. Bring me Mr. Percy
Willoughby from section two of my train, with his check book."</p>

<p>Pete Klopot capitulated with speed. He consented to go take a
look at Paris, and so did the rest of the band. But it was
altogether a sad business. Throughout the journey, from hotel rooms
and from behind lifeboats late at night, on deck, you could hear
the wailing of the unwanted xylophone and the moaning of
unappreciated drums.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Cordwood was so embarrassed, so hurt by the guffaws of Chicago
at his brave pilgrimage, that on the way to New York, he deserted
the manly joys of Drawing Room B for whole moments at a time, and
sat in the next car with Maybelle Benner, sagely collaborating with
her in a deep study of Ohio and Upper New York State. They noticed
and recorded that there were many factories along the way. They
agreed that the apple trees were apple trees and that many of the
denizens of Jackrabbit would not have known that the apple trees
were apple trees but as to themselves, coming as they did from
Vermont and Connecticut, they could tell at the briefest glance
that apple trees, at least in season, bore apples. And together,
fellow highbrows, they persuaded the others to turn the
radio&mdash;Cordwood had had one installed in each car&mdash;from
Hot Cha Cha to Walter Damrosch.</p>

<p>Cordwood noticed that Maybelle had so china-smooth a complexion
that it made his own cheeks feel like a heap of sawdust. He felt
exhilarated when Maybelle breathed. "I didn't know you had such a
taste for classical music, Mr. McGash." He was even fortified to
face the reporters and cameras in New York. For several minutes, on
the June day of their metropolitan arrival, there was no other
news. No one had been purging any European country. Douglas and
America's sweetheart were neither being reconciled nor
disreconciled. The N.R.A. was neither very Bolshevik nor taken over
by Morgan. "Anthony Adverse" had slackened to a sale of less than
ten thousand a day. The baseball teams were plain ornery. But the
press associations had sent on sufficiently colored pictures of
Cordwood and his private circus in Chicago to make him news, and he
was going to be news, whether he liked it or not.</p>

<p>He was ringed with reporters who, with the silky reverence which
has led many a more sophisticated man into the folly of saying
something he really thought, besought him to enlighten them about
the drought. Gertrude Stein, rainbow trout, the future of China,
and whether, when he got there, he would let Paris go on acting
that way, or take it over and run it like Jackrabbit Creek.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that, when he had seen merely the headlines
in the evening paper, Cordwood fled to the R.M.S.
<i>Dipsomania</i>, and hid there, though they were not to sail for
three more days. He was so irritated that he hoofed the absent
banker Scallion out of the Royal Suite, and irascibly took it for
himself.</p>

<p>Percy and he had admitted that in New York they would have to do
some fancy planning to content every one with their accommodations
on the <i>Dipsomania</i>, since for over nine hundred pilgrims,
there were only seven hundred and eighty first-class beds, and some
hundred and twenty-one would have to be content with tourist-third.
(That was according to official figures, though actually, before
they left New York, the number was lessened by eleven, who went to
Harlem and were not found till three days after the sailing.)
Cordwood had modestly planned to be one of the third-class, along
with the young people, but now he irritably tore the Scallion card
from the dainty violet door of the Royal Suite, put his own card
up, entered, threw his hat on the grand piano and his shoes on a
Neo-Gothic desk, and rang for a drink.</p>

<p>He had settled into calmness the next evening and was sitting on
the boat deck watching the skyscrapers against an apple-green sky,
feeling that perhaps, after all, he really would enjoy Paris, when
Maybelle Benner came up to him, her heels a pleasant tapping on the
deck boards, drew over a deck chair, patted his hand, and
intelligently said, "There! I know!"</p>

<p>"But," snarled Cordwood, "they made me say I was going to rent
some dog-gone street they call the Champs Elysees"&mdash;he made it
rhyme with <i>damps pleases</i>, "and grow potatoes on it. Those
newspapers! And they made me ask whether Napoleon was a fruit or a
drink. And one of 'em had a phony photograph of me&mdash;my head
pasted onto a fake business, so it looked like I was riding in a
chariot at the head of the band!"</p>

<p>"I know, Mr. McGash, but now it's all forgotten. New York
wouldn't remember it for more than two days if Bishop Cannon were
arrested for bootlegging&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has he been? Hurray!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no! I just mean that as an example."</p>

<p>"How'd you find me, Maybelle? Good of you to take the
trouble."</p>

<p>"I made Mr. Willoughby tell me...Cordwood."</p>

<p>"How? That's a tight-mouthed lad&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I just told him I'd go to the newspapers and say he'd been
arrested for embezzling the funds of the tour."</p>

<p>"He hasn't been, has he?" sighed Cordwood.</p>

<p>"No, not yet," sighed Maybelle.</p>

<p>Like Mr. Swinburne, then, they were full of the sunset and sad,
if at all, with the fullness of joy. Cordwood dared to touch the
fleecy end of her scarf, but she did not know it. He sighed. She
sighed. They sighed together&mdash;then sat up and giggled.</p>

<p>"Listen to us two old things getting homesick. My! I know we'll
love Paris, but what do you bet we're just as pleased as can be
when we get back to Jackrabbit! My! that's a sweet town! Do you
remember how nice the box-elders are in the courthouse square?"</p>

<p>"And I haven't seen one show-window slicker or tastier dressed
than Cohen &amp; Cabot's!''</p>

<p>"And the creek isn't awfully big but my! such big cottonwood
trees." And she sighed, and he.</p>

<p>Then, briskly, "Mr. McGash&mdash;Cordwood&mdash;I do think you
ought to seize your opportunities and all, and I'm hungry, and what
say we slip off somewhere ashore and have dinner?"</p>

<p>"An elegant idea, Maybelle."</p>

<p>They inquired of a taxi-driver as to a really good place to
dine. He looked at them sharply, and decided on a chop-suey joint.
Cordwood handed him five dollars and, with an appearance of shocked
awe, the taxi-driver instantly took them to Park Avenue.</p>

<p>Cordwood was, as Maybelle flouncingly was not, rather awed by
the quantities of chromium and murals by Mexican communists in the
place, but the head-waiter, who had once been a poor boy himself,
was so sympathetic and kind that almost without a struggle Cordwood
was able to make a sensible and satisfying and wholesome
twenty-five dollar order, ending with strawberries from Labrador.
For any good restaurant can have strawberries out of season, say in
January, but this establishment, the <i>Chameau d'Or</i>, had
devised a ravishing new feature&mdash;it imported viands from
places where it was almost impossible to grow them: Southdown
mutton from vacant lots in the Bronx, salmon from the Amazon, and
moose-meat from Kansas.</p>

<p>The wine-waiter handed Cordwood the vast sacred volume.</p>

<p>"Just a minute. I'll look it over," fretted Cordwood.</p>

<p>"Look," he pleaded with Maybelle. "I know you never drink a
drop, but it's our one night in New York&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have drunk a half-bottle of claret every night since the day
Prohibition began&mdash;and ended. Friends sent it to me from
California, in candied-fruit boxes. The fact that I don't care for
gasoline and ginger ale or for your friend, Mr. Bat Badger, does
not keep me from following the example of most of the saints," said
Maybelle, with complete calmness.</p>

<p>Cordwood was too dazed to speak. There was something he ought to
say, something that you always said at crises when you were
traveling, but he couldn't in this dizzy moment of revelation
remember whether it was, "Well, well, it's a pretty small world
after all," or, "Travel certainly does broaden a fellow."</p>

<p>"There's Chambertin. I've heard that's quite a nice wine,"
suggested Maybelle.</p>

<p>Since to him it tasted rather sour and without any authority in
it, Cordwood wasn't sure whether it was really quite a nice wine or
not&mdash;till he saw how much it cost.</p>

<p>Meantime he had been confiding to Maybelle that, as a child in
Vermont, he had wanted to be president and to reform politics, and
that he had thought vigorously about being a poet. None of this was
true, but after beginning the second bottle of Chambertin, he
believed that it was, and he noted that Maybelle listened to the
pathetic tale of what a misunderstood boy he had been, with notably
more interest in the subject than Oley Tengbom had ever shown.
"My!" she said, frequently and eloquently.</p>

<p>He was in disgrace only once&mdash;when he said that the
artichokes tasted like solidified whisk-brooms.</p>

<p>In the Royal Suite of the <i>Dipsomania</i> that night, Cordwood
reflected, "Golly, Maybelle's the finest lady I ever met. So
cultured and everything. And elegant ankles. But I'd never dare
even shake hands with her. Golly, how she'd bawl me out if I ever
dared stroke her shoulder."</p>

<p>Oh, Sylvester!</p>

<p>The pilgrims had lived in scattered houses in Jackrabbit; they
had been together for but two days on the train. It was only when
they were inescapably at sea that they had a chance to examine and
hate one another. They divided swiftly and sharply into four
groups: they who were not going to let anything interfere with
drinking and quartettes; they who had read a book but still liked a
drink; they who were so determined to hogtie Culture and bring it
back that they frowned on all dissipation; they who liked neither
Culture nor Booze nor anything else in particular and who seemed to
have come along only for the pleasure of concentrated disapproval
of everything. And none in any of these four could endure the
others. Grievously enough, husbands and wives frequently were
divided as to groups, and few spectacles in history have been so
savagely dramatic as the sight of eleven members of the W.C.T.U.
looking down from the promenade deck at their husbands boisterously
shooting craps on a forward hatchway, while relays of stewards
galloped up with clinking trays...and then, most anti-social of
all, the stewards laid down the trays and joined the game!</p>

<p>Cordwood and Percy grew gray as they panted about the boat
trying to make everybody love everybody else.</p>

<p>In Jackrabbit, variations of wealth had not been so irritatingly
evident. But jammed together on shipboard, the women without a
single evening frock hated and gabbled about the women with one
evening frock, and the women with one evening frock abominated and
rebuked the women with a whole wardrobe; and as to Mrs. Scallion,
who had a diamond bracelet and let you know it, the entire feminine
party became violently socialistic. They were jealous of people who
had better staterooms, and people who had the handsomest stewards,
and people who had got ahead of them in drawing the best detective
stories out of the library. In fact, the whole joyous journey to
enchantment was just one orgy of sitting and hating.</p>

<p>They had all forgotten that on the train Cordwood had taken an
upper berth, and now they were very bitter about his occupancy of
the Royal Suite. "<i>Well!</i> I <i>do</i> think he might have made
<i>some</i> effort to look after his <i>guests</i> before he took
care of his <i>own</i> selfish desires," said lady to lovely
lady.</p>

<p>What made it worse was that the selfish millionaire
and&mdash;could you beat it!&mdash;his housekeeper, Sister
Tinkerbun, and that stuck-up New England school-teacher, Maybelle
Benner, all sat at the captain's table, had exclusive access to the
conversation of that stalwart and romantic four-striper. Like most
first voyagers, they believed that there was something especially
exhilarating about all stories told by sea-captains, and the entire
nine hundred of them felt that if there were any justice in the
world, they would be sitting beside the skipper. They glared upon
his table and gloomily imagined that they were missing a
hair-curling tale of shipwreck, at the very least, when actually
the good captain was saying:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, as I look at it, and after a good many years of
experience, bicarbonate of soda is about the best remedy there is
for gas on the stomach."</p>

<p>Cordwood himself had been mildly surprised and pleased at being
invited to the captain's table. It did not occur to him that he had
any superior rights on the boat. And when he was furthermore
invited to a cocktail party in the captain's cabin, when he learned
that J. Pierpont Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and Edsel
Ford and even Gene Tunney had sat right there in that same chair,
Cordwood wiggled with the embarrassment of being honored beyond his
merit.</p>

<p>The captain's cabin was a refuge to him from the rest of the
boat, where he could not go ten feet without one of his guest's
seizing his sleeve to complain&mdash;to complain about the food,
the fog, Mrs. Benner's eastern accent, smoking in the dining-salon,
poker in Mr. Cabot's cabin, kissing on the boat deck, and the
Polish question.</p>

<p>He had entirely given up walking on the promenade deck since
Magnolia Ilgenfritz and Irving Berklund had recruited all the
children aboard into a gang who happily, all day long, hurled
shuffle-board discs at one another, and turned on the fire-hoses,
and tried to crawl into ventilators. When Cordwood wasn't escaping
the children, he was escaping either infuriated guests, who wanted
him to throw the children overboard, or the children's parents, who
sniffed that apparently there were <i>some</i> people who were just
so cranky and so selfish that they didn't want the kiddies to have
any fun at all.</p>

<p>Percy and he kept on desperately getting up
entertainments&mdash;horse races, swimming pool cocktail parties,
movies, concerts, and always dances, which to Cordwood were the
major catastrophes of the trip, because his poor old feet did hurt
so in his dancing slippers, and because he was expected to dance
with every woman over and above twelve years of age and, as there
were over two hundred of them aboard and his capacity was about
three dances an evening, he was always quailing before the brightly
smiling rebuke of some almost unknown female who shook a coy finger
at him and gurgled, "Well! Of course you wouldn't ask poor me to
dance!"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I almost wish I hadn't never got up this trip,"
reflected Cordwood. "Maybe it'd of been more fun to collect
stamps."</p>

<p>It was fortunate that they were met at Cherbourg by practically
the entire French staffs of the American Express Company and Thomas
Cook &amp; Sons&mdash;as Cordwood understood it, indeed one of the
fabulous sons himself was there, surrounded by his staff and gazing
at the battlefield through quite a long telescope. For warlike was
the scene, and heart-rending. Their baggage was heaped on the low
counters of the customs house like the piled dead on a battlefield.
Aged females, never hitherto outside America, were shrieking at the
cynicism with which black-bearded <i>douaniers</i> held up their
respectable woolen union suits. Sporty youths were arguing that
half a dozen cartons of cigarettes didn't mean a thing, not between
friendly nations. Portly merchants, who not an hour before had been
jeering, "No dog-gone foreigner can faze John R. Stipple!" were now
bounding through the customs house wailing, "My God! I can't find
the black suit case! And it's got my razor and my Sunday pants in
it!" And the <i>facteurs</i> stood stolidly with their several
piles of luggage. They knew. By and by these howling barbarians,
who for reasons perfectly incomprehensible and probably improper
had come clear across the ocean, would find their bags and get on
the train and blessedly get the hell out of there and leave the
place to quiet.</p>

<p>They did and, with the sound of a man who has just escaped being
run over, Cordwood looked out of his train window, and was
considerably amazed to find that most of France consisted of fields
and trees and roads, all in colors that would have been considered
quite normal even in Jackrabbit Creek.</p>

<p>There was less confusion in Paris than might have been expected.
Percy and the express company and the son had engaged a fleet of
buses; whole floors had been taken in three hotels within one block
on the Rue Saint Honore; and aside from the loss of Magnolia
Ilgenfritz, who was later found playing steamship with the children
of the Portuguese consul, in the Parc Monceau, the disconsolate
culture-hunters were safely housed. In one of the hotels Percy
established an office, staffed from an American tourist agency, to
arrange for the party whatever diversion they might
prefer&mdash;buses to Fontainebleau, guides to the Night Life of
Montmartre, lists of the best onion soups at Les Halles, addresses
of dressmakers guaranteed to furnish Augustabernard fashions at S.
Klein prices.</p>

<p>So Cordwood sighed and at last prepared to be happy. And at that
moment Mrs. Berklund nipped at him, in the manner of a dog snapping
up a fly, and demanded, "I hate to bother you, but they just won't
give the slightest bit of help in the tourist office, and I must
find out the address of my second cousin that's studying art, or
maybe it's music, here in Paris, from Iowa, Mary Daedal Smith her
name is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then Cordwood blew up.</p>

<p>"Listen! I've brought you all here. I've arranged for autos to
take you anywhere you want to go. I've had a Baedeker Guide and a
Gideon Bible and the latest number of 'Screen Scrapings' put in
every single dern bedroom. And now I quit being nurse maid. I'm
going to enjoy myself a little, now!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Berklund gasped. She panted, "I have never been so insulted
in all my&mdash;when I just asked a civil question!" She marched
away. And Cordwood, intending to dash after her and apologize,
heard a gentle snicker behind him, and turned to view Maybelle
Benner.</p>

<p>"I don't know what came over me! I've never talked to nobody
like that before!" he lamented.</p>

<p>"I thought you were very sound on the subject. I've been waiting
to see when you'd show maybe about half as much sense as it takes
to mow a lawn," said Maybelle. "Come to the Louvre with
me&mdash;just the two of us&mdash;tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"I don't know what a Louvre is&mdash;it sounds like some kind of
a cat-disease our Twinkie has got the loove but whatever it is,
I'll go."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know that Mr. Willoughby is getting a
commission on all the rooms here?"</p>

<p>"Rats! Don't believe a word&mdash;uh&mdash;what makes you think
so?"</p>

<p>"I heard him talking to the manager."</p>

<p>"You mean to say, Maybelle, that you've been sneaking and
snooping and following after that poor young fella?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I didn't follow him one bit. I just sort of made
it my business to be around where he was."</p>

<p>"Oh, Well. Thunder. I don't suppose he'll graft more 'n a few
hundred. He deserves it. 'T'adn't been for him, I'd be dead by
now."</p>

<p>"Very well...Here in the lobby, ten-thirty tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Betcha. And then again, it kind of sounds like a musical
instrument&mdash;he played 'Old Black Joe' on his loove."</p>

<p>His first evening in Pans Cordwood spent with Lester Doggins,
whom he had sent there to study the violin.</p>

<p>Cordwood had been embarrassed by the fear that Les would show up
in a black beard and a wine-colored velvet jacket&mdash;which he
had learned from a veracious movie was the required uniform of all
artists in Paris. He was relieved to see that Les was
smooth-shaven, wearing the same gray suit in which he had left
Jackrabbit, and whooping with unrefined Jackrabbitan heartiness;
relieved equally when Les&mdash;frequently emitting, "Well, by
jiminy! it's grand to see you again!" led him not to a questionable
den of art and the vices but to a sound, wholesome American saloon,
called "Eddie's Chicago Bar." It was filled with American agents
for sewing machines, automobiles, and machine guns; it was adorned
with rye highballs, portraits of Coolidge and Harding, genuine hot
dogs, college youths on vacation, cigarette advertisements, and all
the other native American works of art for which Cordwood was
already homesick. He sighed with happiness, and joined Les in an
old-fashioned.</p>

<p>"Where'll we go to dinner?" hinted Les.</p>

<p>"You name it. Take you to the best joint in this man's
town."</p>

<p>Les sighed with happiness and joined him in a second
old-fashioned.</p>

<p>This was at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>At 7:30 Cordwood delicately noted that Les looked rather shabby.
Les wept and said, yes, he had worked like a dog, he had saved
every nickle he could, but what with the enormous cost of music
lessons and resin&mdash;</p>

<p>At 8:30 Cordwood also wept, and pressed&mdash;after some
difficulty in writing it&mdash;a check for a thousand dollars into
Les's hand.</p>

<p>Les said he was unworthy of it, but he would try to show his
appreciation by becoming one of the best dog-gone radio fiddlers in
America and then, rather quickly drying his tears, suggested,
"Hadn't we better go feed now?"</p>

<p>"You bet. But let's have an old-fashioned first."</p>

<p>At 9:30 things seemed to Cordwood a little confused. He would
have sworn that a newspaper correspondent, a canned-cornbeef
salesman, and two congressmen who were successfully investigating
the Evils of Drink in Europe had been at the table with them, but
they seemed, though he looked all over for them, to have gone
away.</p>

<p>At 4:30 a.m. he awoke, abed in his room at the hotel, completely
undressed except perhaps for his hat and shoes and socks. He stared
around the room. There was, apparently, no Les, no newspaperman, no
canned-beef salesman, not even a congressman in sight, nor anything
reminiscent of a party except a large wrapping-paper sign on which
was written, apparently with lipstick, "Thanks for the Shetland
pony&mdash;Les and Lily."</p>

<p>Never in his life to the present date&mdash;March 10,
1935&mdash;has Cord wood learned anything more about Lily or the
Shetland pony.</p>

<p>By a judicious regimen of bromides, ice water&mdash;the one
English phrase which the night floor-waiter completely
understood&mdash;and walking two hours before breakfast, Cordwood
was in reasonably good shape when Maybelle joined him, for what he
now realized would be a nerve-wrenching attack on the Louvre.</p>

<p>She led him rapidly past a bewildering World's Fair of
sculpture, of mosaics, of enamels, to the Grande Galerie, and he
flinched as he guessed that he was expected to enjoy the paintings
of Carpaccio, Bugiardini, Mantegna, Cosimo. He peered at them
cautiously. Nobody was going to catch <i>him</i> saying the wrong
thing. Then he was shocked. He actually liked them! They weren't as
slick as magazine covers maybe or as the silken ankles which, for
unknown reasons, advertise motor-car bodies, but they
were&mdash;oh&mdash;homelike, these kind-faced madonnas and saints
in gold and scarlet robes&mdash;just such old boys, really, as he
had known and yarned with in Iumber camps and workshops and
farmhouses.</p>

<p>He had a second's dreadful suspicion. Maybe, since he actually
liked them, they weren't the real goods, and Maybelle had led him
in here as a practical joke, to that he'd show his ignorance. But
no, she too&mdash;he cautiously sneaked in a look over his
shoulder&mdash;seemed to appreciate 'em. Gosh! Suppose he, Cordwood
McGash of Jackrabbit Creek, really was all okay on this good taste
and highbrow stuff. Wouldn't <i>that</i> knock Perce's eye out, if
he ever learned it! Wouldn't Reverend Mitch have a fit if that
happened to be true. Gee!</p>

<p>In half an hour Maybelle said, as though she were forgiving him
for something, "Well, shall we go on to another room?"</p>

<p>"Heh? Oh. Oh, no, let's see some more of these."</p>

<p>And it was she, not Cordwood, who finally shifted tired feet and
rubbed smarting eyes, and squeaked in a small exhausted voice,
"Let's go now and come back another day. I do love these Old
Masters&mdash;well, I guess I do&mdash;but an hour and a half,
that's all I can stand at a time."</p>

<p>"Heh? Oh&mdash;oh, all right. Let's come back this
afternoon."</p>

<p>He could not understand it but it seemed to him that Maybelle
Benner was looking at him with an admiration she had never
exhibited before.</p>

<p>In the Tuileries he hesitated, "Lookit&mdash;uh&mdash;we may
never be in Paris again and&mdash;uh&mdash;take a chance for once
and come sit with me at one of these sidewalk cafes. You know.
Interesting to watch the crowds and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, uh," she said intelligently.</p>

<p>She seemed to like the small marble-topped tables, the blue
siphons, the early July sun through the striped yellow awnings. She
sighed, not unhappily, and she almost made Cordwood blush by boldly
taking off her eye-glasses, when suddenly her naked eyes seemed
quite human.</p>

<p>To the waiter she murmured, "Coffee."</p>

<p>Cordwood ventured, "Say I'd kind of&mdash;got a little
indigestion this morning and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, have your brandy and soda." She sounded a little weary.
"You'll have it sooner or later, anyway, so you might as well
indulge your carnal tastes openly."</p>

<p>"You bet your life I'm going to indulge my carnal tastes!
Waiter!"</p>

<p>"Yessir."</p>

<p>"Brandy and soda, and make it carnal!"</p>

<p>"Yessir, carnal brandysoda&mdash;three star carnal, sir?"</p>

<p>"Cordwood!"</p>

<p>"Yessum."</p>

<p>"You would be an atrocious person to try to handle. You'd be so
meek and so conscious of your general plumb low-down worthlessness
nine-tenths of the time, and then just when some one had your feet
all nicely planted on the straight and narrow, you'd jump off it
and go scooting off through the sagebrush, snickering. I don't know
what I'm going to do with you!"</p>

<p>He could hear it&mdash;no doubt about it, no illusion at
all&mdash;he could hear his own voice saying, with a ghastly hollow
mirth, "Well, you might marry me." But he didn't quite say it,
though he knew that he was probably doing a dirty trick in failing
to do what was so clearly expected. He choked it down. He stopped
his mouth with revivifying brandy and soda and when he had done
coughing, he said hastily:</p>

<p>"Didn't know if I'd like those old pictures or not but, by
golly, they're kind of interesting. Don't suppose the French
Government would sell some of 'em, do you? Be nice to take 'em back
to Jackrabbit. <i>That</i> would cer'nly make Blizzard Junction
jealous!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I should think they'd be about as willing to sell them as
to sell Napoleon's tomb."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, rats, Maybelle, you're kidding me. They'd never sell
Napoleon's tomb...Or would they? That <i>would</i> be something to
have in Jackrabbit!"</p>

<p>As they trudged back to the hotel, he felt that the trusting
companionship in which they had sat down at the cafe had somehow
been frosted over.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>The second time that Les Doggins took him out, he almost
fulfilled Cordwood's first panic fears about artiness. Les had not,
in two days, grown a spade beard, but he had put his Jackrabbit
Creek suit back into the mothballs&mdash;Cordwood felt suspicious
about that, somehow&mdash;and he appeared in a ballooning belted
suit of corduroys, a blue flannel shirt with an orange tie of
crinkly raw silk, and a vast and flapping black hat. And he took
Cordwood not to a dependable place like Eddie's Bar, where you
could meet catsup-salesmen and congressmen, but to a dismal
stone-floored cellar on the Left Bank.</p>

<p>"Now I'll show you a real, genuine French place, tonight, and if
Madame Mogador likes you, you'll be right in with the real inner
set. And incidentally, what food! Ah!"</p>

<p>Les kissed his finger tips. Cordwood restrained himself from
homicide, not yet having looked up in Baedeker the French laws on
the subject.</p>

<p>Madame Mogador's establishment was indeed French, except for
perhaps one hundred per cent of its patrons. It had a magpie in a
cage, menus written in what looked like indelible pencil that had
been exposed to the rain, damp napkins, and a poster of the P.L.M.
railway, advocating a journey to Roman ruins which pleasingly
resembled a partly consumed cheese. Madame Mogador herself had a
wig and she had not shaved that morning. She sat at a cashier's
desk that was reminiscent of a pulpit and she nodded, but coldly,
to Les Doggin's perfervid "B'soir, M'dame."</p>

<p>"We're great friends, the Madame and me. I tell you, Cordwood,
there's folks from the Right Bank, dukes and cabinet ministers and
American bankers and everybody, that've been coming here for years,
trying to get chummy with her, but she don't care who you
are&mdash;she's just as likely to take in some little painter you
never heard of as she is the Prince of Wales," said Les.</p>

<p>"I see." Cordwood did not sound his usual sunny, Maymorning,
wildrose self. "I've heard about folks like her. I heard in New
York that if you can get one of these fancy Wop hair-dressers to
okay you, that just fixes you up socially for life. Wouldn't it be
hell&mdash;wouldn't it just about ruin my sojourn in Paris, if the
Madame didn't like me! Say! I know now&mdash;she looks like the
cook I had once on my ranch."</p>

<p>"Who was she?"</p>

<p>"She? Hell! He was a he. But he didn't have as good a moustache
as the Madame. Well say, my boy, d' you think your influence with
the Madame is strong enough to get that waiter to quit picking his
teeth and come take an order?"</p>

<p>But, Cordwood admitted, the ministrone Mogador was really
good&mdash;as good as any canned soup he had ever opened.</p>

<p>They wound up at the Ecrevisse Internationale, where exiled
white Russians sang negro spirituals, and Alabama negroes sang
Cossack folk-songs, very depressing and beautiful, and Les Doggins
who, for a Jackrabbit Creek boy, seemed to know a lot of Parisian
girls, brought any number of monkey-chattering young females to the
table and signified that they were broad-minded and would be
willing to have Cordwood buy for them, if he was nice about it. But
Cordwood himself, since he was again going to the Louvre with
Maybelle next morning, stuck to Italian vermouth.</p>

<p>He went home at eleven.</p>

<p>It was on the next night, after he had gone to a motion-picture
(American) with the Tengboms and Mrs. Tinkerbun, when he was
respectably retiring at midnight, that Les clamored at his bedroom
door, leapt in, bolted the door, and gasped, "My God, you've got to
hide me!"</p>

<p>In slippers, cotton undershirt, and trousers with suspenders
wreathed about his middle. Cordwood was in no costume nor mood to
play melodrama with this Bohemian figure with blue shirt, orange
tie, desperately waving hat, and disordered hair. He growled, "What
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've killed a man!"</p>

<p>"Whaaaaat!"</p>

<p>"Just now! I was crossing the Luxembourg Gardens when a man came
up to me, a perfect stranger, he was an Italian count, and he
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How juh know he was an Italian count?"</p>

<p>"Oh, how? Oh, I knew. He was drunk."</p>

<p>"This count, or you?"</p>

<p>"He was. I was perfectly sober."</p>

<p>"You're not now."</p>

<p>"I know it. I had a drink. Would you stay sober if you'd just
killed a man?"</p>

<p>"Not if he was an Italian count, I wouldn't. I'd be drinking
myself. But there, boy. I'll watch out for you. What really
happened?"</p>

<p>"He come up&mdash;came up to me, and he said, 'All Americans are
sons of inferior animals&mdash;'"</p>

<p>("Not <i>all</i>," muttered Cordwood, thinking of his caravan,
but it was not loud enough to interrupt Les's agony.)</p>

<p>"&mdash;and I said to him, 'You take that back,' and he sneered
at me, and I hit him, and he fell and cracked his skull open on a
bench&mdash;oh, will I ever forget that sight?&mdash;and I sneaked
away, and you've got to hide me from the police!"</p>

<p>Sobbing, Les fell upon the bed, and slipped instantly into a
happy dreamless sleep, smiling with such sweet boyishness that his
mother would have remembered his babyhood and crooned above his
slumbers. Cordwood remembered nothing of the kind. He remembered
only the time when Les had with scholarly patience punched holes in
a dozen costly muskmelons in Cordwood's general store, and poured
kerosene into them.</p>

<p>Still and all, the chump had obviously done something careless.
Not that it seemed to the Cordwood who had lived in gold-rush camps
and oil boom-towns important to have killed a count, especially a
count who didn't owe you any recoverable money, but Europeans were,
he reflected, pernickety about things like that. So he turned in,
most uncomfortably, on the settee in his salon, and slid off it all
night long. Les was gone, in the morning, and when Cordwood got him
on the telephone at the Cafe Pourquoi&mdash;Les had explained that
he used the cafe merely as a handy address, as there was no
telephone at his violin instructor's&mdash;Les grumbled rather
sourly, "Heard nothing about it. Guess it'll be all right."</p>

<p>Cordwood had reason to think of Les that evening, for he had
invited the young genius to a dinner which he was giving at the
Hotel Splendide et de la Siberie, the entire nine hundred pilgrims;
he had assumed that Les would spring with joy at seeing all his old
neighbors. But Les did not spring to the extent of showing up at
the dinner.</p>

<p>The affair proceeded magnificently through green turtle soup,
with sherry and invocation by the Reverend Mr. Mitch, <i>soie
Marguery</i>, with <i>Brauneberger Hasenlaufer</i> and thanks to
our host by Mr. Scallion, <i>caneton presse</i>, with <i>Moulin a
vent</i> and apt remarks, also humor, by Professor Thrig of the
Jackrabbit schools, through roast and salad and sweet. At
eleven-thirty it was really getting down to the speeches, with a
patriotic address by Judge Stubber, to the effect that however
wicked Paris might be, we in America could be proud of the fact
that New York and Chicago were just as wicked any day or night,
when the assistant manager wriggled up to Cordwood and whispered,
"Surr, there is a man outside, he says he is a friend of you, he
must see you&mdash;a Monsieur Doughgins."</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;," stated Cordwood, but he went.</p>

<p>Les Doggins was crouched on the edge of a chair in the anteroom,
still in the blue shirt and orange tie, and with a really promising
sign of the black beard. He sprang up. He hissed&mdash;no matter if
there weren't any s's in the words, he contrived to hiss them just
the same; "You've got to help me. You've got to hide me from the
police. I've killed a man&mdash;an Italian count. I fought a duel
with him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the Luxembourg Gardens?"</p>

<p>"How did you know? Have the police been here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Les! Do you know what's the trouble with you? Somebody's bought
you some liquor." Wearily then, to the assistant manager: "Take
this man up to a bedroom. Remove anything that's easily busted.
Leave a pitcher of ice water and some aspirin&mdash;yes, and I
think a good hymn book, if you've got one handy&mdash;and then lock
him up, and don't let him out till eight tomorrow morning, and send
me the bill."</p>

<p>And the next night, precisely at midnight again, when Cordwood
was going to bed happy in the thought that his bedroom and salon
doors were bolted and safe against all Les Dogginses whatever, he
was terrified at seeing a ghost on the ledge outside his window,
and to have Les part the drapes and tumble in, mumbling, "Gotta
hide me from the police. I just killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An Italian count in Luxembourg Gardens?"</p>

<p>With hurt dignity, with wide and senatorial gestures, Les
remonstrated, "It was not! It was a Spanish duke. In Blizzard
Junction. Killed him. Duel!"</p>

<p>Cordwood, as he unlocked the door, was brief.</p>

<p>"Doggins, who's your music teacher?"</p>

<p>Les smiled cunningly. "You can't fool me. I haven't got any! I'm
studying to be a sculptor now!"</p>

<p>"When d' you quit the violin?"</p>

<p>"Months ago. Aley-aley, aleeeee-hoooooi Old Cordwood, the pore
ole soak. Come have a drink!"</p>

<p>"Doggins, I've got a nice secretary. Percy Willoughby is his
name. Tomorrow morning, just before you kill your first count,
Percy will call on you with your ticket to
America&mdash;third-class&mdash;and help you pack and take you to
the boat train."</p>

<p>"And supposin' I won't go, you old double-faced, lumber
stealin', claim-jumpin' pirate? What'll happen then?
Aley-aley-hoooooo!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. You'll just starve here in Paris, after my
thousand is gone. Your allowance stopped promptly at midnight,
tonight. But I might have Perce find out how many creditors you
have, and tip 'em off that you're in funds just now."</p>

<p>Then for once, perhaps for the first time in his life, Les
Doggins ceased looking calf-like and, much fortified within, became
ferocious. He picked up a chair; he swung it aloft, shrieking, "All
right! Good! I don't want your dirty money, that you stole. But
meanwhile, I'm going to have a little fun with you!"</p>

<p>It did not occur to Cordwood to be afraid of this drunk, thirty
years his junior. He had known when lumberjacks had given up
stamping the faces of their opponents with spiked hoots, as being
too effeminate a gesture, and had taken to gouging out eyes. He
moved catwise. But he didn't like it. The furniture would get a
good deal broken up and that wasn't really nice. The hotel manager
might not care for it. He reached behind him for a heavy pottery
bowl on a console. Les screamed in pure imbecile rage and came on,
swinging the chair.</p>

<p>The door opened and Maybelle Benner, in a quilted lavender
dressing-gown and an awful black rubber cap on her nose, marched
in, took one look, and snapped, "Lester O'Ginnis Doggins! You put
that chair down, right away!"</p>

<p>Les drooped; the chair drooped; Les turned humbly toward Mrs.
Benner.</p>

<p>"To think I taught you for two years in Sunday School&mdash;and
a nasty little boy you were, too, and you always gambled your penny
away, instead of putting it in the collection. And to this day you
don't know your Golden Texts! Hey? What book of the Bible does
'Hadad died also. And the dukes of Edom were: duke Timnah, duke
Aliah, duke Jetheth,' come from? Hey?"</p>

<p>"I forget," whimpered Les.</p>

<p>"You would! And I still owe you one for putting turpentine in my
kitten's milk, and I have half a mind to warm your jacket right
here and now but&mdash;you get out of here, quick, and don't you
dare come back!"</p>

<p>"Yessum," moaned Les Doggins, and fled, never again to adorn
these pages.</p>

<p>As Cordwood was about to take the most daring chance of his life
and embrace Maybelle, dressing-gown and nose-mask and all, they
realized that Les had left the door open and that gathered outside
were a score of the weightiest citizens of Jackrabbit Creek. The
choir-soprano voice of Mrs. Mitch lilted, "And him in his
shirt-sleeves, too! No wonder Mr. Doggins couldn't stand such
goin's-on&mdash;sensitive poet-soul like him!"</p>

<p>The nine-hundred-odd pilgrims had worked faithfully at enjoying
themselves, but they hadn't been successful. They had done their
duty by all of the thirty seven churches worth seeing. They had
faithfully chipped pieces of stone out of the palace at
Fontainebleau to take home as souvenirs. They had eaten snails and
Breton tripe when they wanted buckwheats and hash. And now they
were forlorn and given to audible wonder as to why the dickens
anybody who had a nice home with his own pet rocking chair would
ever leave it.</p>

<p>The scandal of discovering Cordwood and Mrs. Benner in such
intimacy brought their rebellion to the barricades. Mr. Mitch and
Mr. Scallion and Mrs. Berklund assembled some eighty of the really
significant pilgrims in secret conclave in the dining-room of the
Hotel Minauderie. Few meetings since the granting of the Magna
Carta have been more filled with indignation and whereases. Mr.
Scallion, as chairman, was in magnificent form. He was as gentle as
though he were back home, refusing a loan on a quarter-section. He
had a voice, did Mr. Scallion. It rang like the ice beneath
December skates upon Jackrabbit Slew, it moaned like the wind in
the cottonwoods, it blared like the Jackrabbit Band, as he read the
demands of the steering committee:</p>

<p>"Whereas we, the undersigned, had not got any desire to come to
Europe till we were so invited to do so by Mr. S. G. McGash. Esq.,
and whereas said McGash, unmindful of his duties as an American
citizen and paying no attention to the rest of us, has been bumming
around Paris all the time with Mrs. Maybelle Benner and we all wish
to go on record right here and now as being opposed to her being
reappointed to her job as principal of the Junior High&mdash;</p>

<p>"Therefore we demand of the said Mr McGash, Esq., that he not
keep us penned and imprisoned here in Paris but since it was his
idea in the first place anyway that we should go abroad and he
talked a lot about us enjoying ourselves like we liked, that he
accede to our demands as follows, viz:</p>

<p>"Mr Scallion to go to England and to be provided with letters to
American ambassador and to Governor of Bank of England, with
several Lords, etc., to study financial conditions, etc., etc.,
also suite in high-class hotel. With Mrs. Scallion and Mervyn.</p>

<p>"Rev. and Mrs. Mitch and family to investigate missions in
Turkey, India, China, Japan.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cohen &amp; Mr. Cabot to investigate questionable morals in
Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>"Dr. Berklund to take two-year course in surgery,
psychoanalysis, German skiing in Vienna&mdash;P.S. he is willing to
pay fifty dollars ($50.00) per month toward salary of substitute
doc to hold his practise during said period, rest of salary to be
met by said McGash.</p>

<p>"Miss Benicia Axelbrod is willing to remain in Paris, to study
as beautician, but requires flat, hired girl, and letters of
introduction, otherwise willing to get along on two hundred fifty
($250.00) a month during said term of study."</p>

<p>There were only seventy-four other demands, because one of the
council, Mrs. Pandora Gittle, wailed, "All I want to do is to go
home to Jackrabbit&mdash;quick. I just know I left the light on in
the cellar!"</p>

<p>They appointed a delegation of three to call on Cordwood and
quietly make him see the light, but just as the meeting was
adjourning, Cordwood walked in on it, swiftly, followed by Percy
Willoughby. He knew all about it. Sister Tinkerbun had been
listening to the whole affair from the service door of the
dining-room and she had run sputtering to Cordwood.</p>

<p>Cordwood banged a table with a noise surprising from so small a
hand, and announced, "I hear you folks have decided to go off on
your own. Fine! I'd planned to take you to London and Italy and a
lot of places. But as you've all took over charge of this circus, I
won't have to bother. By tomorrow noon, your steamer tickets will
all be ready&mdash;call at my travel office for them.</p>

<p>"We sail on the <i>Dolorous</i> day after tomorrow. She's a
one-class ship, and we won't be able to give single gents and
ladies no cabins to themselves, also by golly, you buy your own
booze. Them as doesn't claim tickets by six tomorrow afternoon pays
their own way back to Jackrabbit."</p>

<p>The rebels were too dazed to realize much save that from the
dining-room door Maybelle Benner was pouring upon Cordwood an
admiration that was a bit embarrassing, and that she even gave to
Percy Willoughby such an amiable glance as she might have given to
a dish of waffles on a winter morning, and that arm in arm with her
was the Sister Tinkerbun whom once they had looked upon as a
pot-walloper and a yes-woman.</p>

<p>The voyage of the S.S. <i>Dolorous</i> was not very inspiriting.
She was a strictly business-like vessel, an old-fashioned craft,
which attended only to getting people across the ocean, and
provided neither gilded ballrooms, swimming-pools, private baths,
red tissue-paper gala caps, nor in any other manner tried to
emulate Atlantic City or Yom Kippur. The disconsolate pilgrims
(only seventeen had angrily remained behind in Paris, on their own)
had all evening long the spectacle of Cordwood, Percy, Maybelle,
Sister Tinkerbun, Manny Ilgenfritz, Oley Tengbom, and Sime
Bendelari being jocular around a large smoking-room table weedy
with glasses, but as for themselves, they could dance to a
phonograph&mdash;or not dance to a phonograph. Worst of all, the
now disgraced Cordwood seemed much happier than he had coming over
on the <i>Dipsomania</i>.</p>

<p>But on the third day out, Cordwood's cheerfulness vanished with
a great and terrible vanishment.</p>

<p>He received&mdash;collect&mdash;from Jackrabbit, from Sheriff
Pimbury, a radiogram. "Whole town Jackrabbit burning up doubt if we
can save anything except memorial fountain." He had scarcely
finished groaning over the message when he had a second: "Looks
like Colonel Blight and gang got away with all cash in bank vaults
county treasury postoffice before fire started stop probably set
fire stop wire instructions Bert Pimbury."</p>

<p>The third was: "Rescued marble top table seven cocktail shakers
lawn-mower bronze statue seems be heathen goddess from your home
what want done with these."</p>

<p>Before he dared tell his once friendly neighbors that they had
lost all their goods, Cordwood worked for hours with Percy. He
would have spent about a million dollars, out of his seven, before
he got his lambs all home. They estimated that it would take about
three million to rebuild the town and get it started.</p>

<p>"By golly, that still leaves me three million, and even this
traveling didn't pan out so good, I don't see any way of getting
rid of the rest," sighed Cordwood. Then he brightened, in memory of
1929: "Except maybe by getting the very best advice from the
soundest kind of brokers and bankers and investing in absolutely
safe securities on their advice."</p>

<p>When the news of the conflagration was made known to the ship,
Mr. Scallion tried to jump overboard. Mrs. Ben Pilshaw, wife of the
hay and feed store, went about moaning, "My lovely new overstuffed
davenport!" Irving Berklund wailed, "My radio&mdash;just when I
thought I'd gotten Kalamazoo." But whatever their griefs
individually, they joined as one man in blaming Cordwood. Except
for him, they would never have left their homes unguarded. Within
an hour, there was among all of them a confused but passionate
feeling that Cordwood had slipped over to America, probably by
aeroplane, and started the fire himself. Indignation meetings were
held in every stateroom, in the smoking-room, even in the bathrooms
where miserable bather called to bather from his tub.</p>

<p>Percy gathered them all into the dining-room after dinner, and
Cordwood announced that he would, if possible, make it good to all
of them.</p>

<p>They jabbered at him. You <i>bet</i> he'd make it good to them
or they'd&mdash;. When they stopped for a second to try to think
just what they would do, if he failed them. Maybelle Benner shot up
and addressed the meeting, uninvited by either party in this
war:</p>

<p>"I call it real good of Mr. McGash. And just kindly remember
that he's under no necessity of doing a single thing. And if he
does rebuild for you, out of the goodness of his heart, you'll have
new houses, and <i>clean</i> ones, which is more than a lot of you
had when we started off! Now I advise you to all quiet right down
and go make lists of what you think you've lost, or are going to
say you've lost, and bring 'em to Mr. Willoughby, and maybe he'll
get Mr. McGash to allow them."</p>

<p>"I don't think I <i>like</i> that woman, Mrs. Benner, any more,"
whispered Mrs. Berklund to Mrs. Mitch.</p>

<p>With considerable speed they scattered to their several cabins
and began frantically to scribble lists on very, very large sheets
of paper; and to gallop toward Cordwood's cabin with the lists, to
get in first.</p>

<p>They must have had exceptional memories&mdash;perhaps due to the
superior air and water of Jackrabbit County. Among two hundred
other items, old Mrs. Peasewick recalled and described in detail
sixteen patchwork quilts, a noble antique clock perfect in every
way except that since the second battle of Bull Run, no one had
been able to make it go, twelve hem-stitched towels none of which
had been used for more than a generation, and a library of nineteen
books, including five by Harold Bell Wright. The stocks-in-trade of
the various stores and small factories made an impressive showing.
Sime Bendelari&mdash;though privately he was food of Cordwood, or
at least of Cordwood's poker and liquor&mdash;estimated a stock
which would have made a handsome showing in a chain of twenty urban
drug-stores, and Cohen &amp; Cabot claimed a loss of such imperial,
such fabulous wares as would have set up a New York&mdash;even a
Chicago&mdash;department store.</p>

<p>Cordwood received all these claims with scarcely a whimper. He
muttered only, "I never noticed any fifty-dollar pajamas in Cohen
&amp; Cabot's!" He would have paid every claim, but Percy and
Maybelle were firm. They clamored about things like insurance,
inventories, appraisers. They kept him up all one night, jabbing at
him, till he agreed to set up a court composed of Percy, Mr.
Scallion&mdash;a crank of the first water but an honest
crank&mdash;and Judge Kilgore to pass on the claims and to pay what
seemed just, receiving from each claimant a receipt and a promise
to pay back whatever the experts should later pronounce to have
been an excess.</p>

<p>Night and day, till they landed, this court sat wearily at its
foul task, arguing with indignant suitors who explained that in a
two-thousand dollar house they had cunningly concealed a grand
piano, $10,000 in bills, and a couple of tiaras from the smuggled
Russian court-jewels. The court allowed Cordwood to come around,
now and then, and he sat back looking drab and shabby and
insignificant in his supposedly new wardrobe. Not again did he tell
happy stories of homicide in lumbercamps to lively parties in the
smoking-room.</p>

<p>The judges paid out nearly three million, of which, they
estimated, Cordwood might get back half a million...Some day. That,
felt Cordwood lugubriously, still left him rather too
rich&mdash;three million he still had on his books.</p>

<p>The night before they landed, Percy came to him with a glorious
suggestion. Cordwood should stay in New York&mdash;if he went back
to Jackrabbit with the clamorous refugees, they would badger him to
death. He, the good Percy, would conduct them back, Cordwood would
better give him a little personal check, say five hundred thousand
or so, and with this Percy would meet all their first needs, in
cash...being careful always, he explained, to get legal receipts
from them.</p>

<p>"Fine! I never did get to see New York. I'll stay couple of
weeks or so. Five hundred thousand&mdash;that be enough?" said
Cordwood gratefully. "Maybe I can get Mrs. Benner to
stay&mdash;with Sister Tinkerbun for chaperon."</p>

<p>Maybelle and Mrs. Tinkerbun were graciously willing to stay,
after he had spoken with hoarse eloquence of night clubs and the
wonders of Grant's tomb, and the three of them saw off at the
station the now more nearly forgiving nine hundred.</p>

<p>They really had a very good time, in New York. They drank
non-alcoholic cocktails in Rockefeller Center. They viewed Roy
Chapman Andrews and Will Beebe at the Natural History Museum.</p>

<p>But they were not altogether dissipated. Came a night when
Maybelle demanded: "Cordwood, dear."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cordwood.</p>

<p>"I want a check for $500,000."</p>

<p>Now that was very nearly a blow. Maybelle had been the only
person in America who hadn't tried to touch him. It made him feel
lonely. Then hastily, she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! Not for myself! To rebuild the Community House
in Jackrabbit! We mustn't let that lovely thing go!" she maintained
earnestly.</p>

<p>"I <i>see</i>!" said Cordwood, happily signing.</p>

<p>Next morning, as Maybelle and Sister Tinkerbun were getting
permanent waves&mdash;and where they ever learned that there were
such things as permanent waves this chronicler has been unable to
discover&mdash;Cordwood thought it might be well to drop in and see
his New York lawyers. They greeted him, he thought, with some
coldness. The head of the firm, Mr. Guidelpop, making a brave show
with his eye-glasses, demanded, "Mr. McGash, I am, if I may say so,
a bit worried about your investments. They seem to me, if I may say
so, to be diminishing at a dangerous rate. Now this two million
dollars that your agent, Colonel Blight, withdrew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blight? Two million?"</p>

<p>"Why yes&mdash;on your power of attorney."</p>

<p>"Could I see that there power of attorney?"</p>

<p>It was forged.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that Cordwood McGash, a simple and quite
decent fellow who had recently been worrying about the spending of
his exorbitant fortune, walked out on the street penniless. He had
supposed that he would like it, but in truth, when he thought of
again batching it, in a tarpaper shack, with greasy tin dishes, he
wasn't entirely happy.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;to the alarm of the traffic cop at Thirty-fourth and
Fifth Avenue&mdash;he stopped on the corner and laughed. Idiot! Of
course! What foolishness! Didn't good old Percy Willoughby have
$500,000 of his? So, happily, he came into his hotel, to find a
telegram from Mr. Scallion:</p>

<p>"Do you know where Willoughby is? Seems to have disappeared. Got
off train at Newark and has not been seen since."</p>

<p>Now Cordwood had been the joy of the hotel. He had always tipped
the bell boys a dollar each and the slightest smile from the
elevator starter had been good for a five. They were all a little
hurt this morning when, after receiving his telegram, he strode to
the elevator without tipping anybody on the way.</p>

<p>But, in the elevator, he laughed again.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," he chuckled, "there is no chance that Maybelle
will marry me. I dunno that it'll be so bad to be batching it
again. Beans are pretty damn good when you cook 'em right."</p>

<p>He opened the door to his suite. Maybelle was sitting there.</p>

<p>"Five hundred thousand dollars, at five per cent is twenty-five
thousand dollars a year&mdash;and that is more than anybody
deserves to have in the world," she said. "You see, the Community
House that I was thinking about is our Community House in
Paris."</p>

<p>"I <i>see</i>," said Cordwood. "But isn't it necessary to get a
marriage license and a steamer ticket?"</p>

<p>Maybelle laughed. "I have them all ready," she said.</p>
