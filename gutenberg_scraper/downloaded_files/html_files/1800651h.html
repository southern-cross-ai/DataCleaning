<p><b>ACT I.</b></p>

<p>SCENE&mdash;<i>A dismantled room in the Osaldi palace.</i>

<p><i>Enter OSALDI and GIOVANNI.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>What, gone? All gone? fame, fortune, substance, lands?<br>
Nought but the title left?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Ay, ay, nought else.<br>
The goodly tree of our most ancient house<br>
Which for so long a time hath stood the shock<br>
Of every wind of heav'n, hath fall'n at last;<br>
And I th' unhappy cause.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Thou?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>But for me,<br>
For me and that wild folly of the blood<br>
Which would not look on danger in the bud,<br>
However brave to meet it in the flower,<br>
You and your brother might have stood this day<br>
Among the proudest nobles in the land,<br>
Instead of hiding in these dim old halls<br>
Heads that were made for council, hands for fight,<br>
And hearts whose manly worth a father sees<br>
But dares not praise too much, lest men should say,<br>
"The loss of fortune, favor, and repute<br>
Hath made the old man mad; low as he is,<br>
He thinks to charm the world back to his feet<br>
With his two needy sons." Ah, my Giovanni,<br>
You are too gentle; you but wrench the sword<br>
When you should boldly draw it. Wrong like this,<br>
Demands a harsher treatment.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Wrong? Well, yes,<br>
Perhaps it was a wrong. But when did wrong<br>
E'er mount so high that love could not outsoar it?<br>
Father, I love you, and in that word toss<br>
The past away forever. As for the future,<br>
If we be born Osaldis, let us be<br>
Osaldis to the core, and made to bend,<br>
Stoop with such strength we crush the thing we stoop to,<br>
And rise up lords again. You smile, my sire;<br>
Does my weak body put to shame my words?<br>
If so, my deeds must put to shame my body.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>If I did smile it was with pride, my boy,<br>
To find my fledglings grown. You and your brother<br>
Are two young eagles hatched upon a rock<br>
But needing nought but your great eagle hearts<br>
To teach you how to mount. Oh that my strength<br>
Were as my years, that I might live to see<br>
Your wings above the clouds!

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>You will, you will.<br>
By this right arm's good force&mdash;

<p>OSALDI.

<p>No force, my son;<br>
I am too old for force. I fain would see<br>
The end before I die, and fortune forced,<br>
Yields not till blood and sinew, heart and brain<br>
Have well-nigh spent themselves.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>How then attain?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>As you attain the fruit of yonder tree;<br>
Stand up and reach, my son.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>But all are reaching,<br>
And what am I that I alone should pluck?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>You are a prince.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Ay, but you say a poor one,<br>
And gold seeks gold.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>True if it seek not rank.<br>
Boy, you are dull, methinks. The ripest fruit<br>
Which hangs within the reach of noble youth,<br>
Falls but through woman's favor. You must wed.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Ah!

<p>OSALDI.

<p>For&mdash; [<i>Enter</i> ZENO.<br>
But hold! here comes our worthy Zeno;<br>
Step back, I pray, but do not quite withdraw;<br>
I 'd speak to you anon.<br>
[GIOVANNI <i>draws back.</i> OSALDI <i>approaches</i> ZENO.<br>
Well, well, what news?<br>
What says the sleek Rigoli?

<p>ZENO.

<p>Good, my lord,<br>
The worthy count sends greeting; knows your fame<br>
And bows unto it; knows your son's deserts<br>
And cries himself his servant; feels them both<br>
Too weighty in the balance 'gainst his daughter,<br>
And therefore must decline the brave alliance<br>
You bade me to propose.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Ay, ay, ay, ay,<br>
A smooth, soft message, but it breaks my heart.<br>
My fame? Great heavens! My deserts? Ye powers!<br>
They are most weighty. Had we owned more gold,<br>
Methinks we then had seen a miracle,<br>
Since what had made all other scales weigh down<br>
Had tossed this up in air. Ah, well, the world<br>
Speaks suavely in this answer of Rigoli.

<p>ZENO.

<p>My lord, a five year hence the Count Rigoli<br>
Will think himself much honored if he gain<br>
So much as late admission to Osaldi.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Hath Giocchi then&mdash;

<p>ZENO.

<p>My gracious lord, no Giocchi;<br>
There's craft in Giocchi blood; I like not Giocchi.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Ay, but what said he? Something blunt, I wot.<br>
What said the jealous Giocchi?

<p>ZENO.

<p>Truly, Prince,<br>
He said no more than this:<br>
"When proud Osaldi Can show a fortune equal to his birth,<br>
Then let him seek my daughter."

<p>OSALDI.

<p>When, when, <i>then!</i><br>
And does he think we e'er should seek his daughter<br>
Were we so much as by one scudo richer?<br>
Fie on him and his daughter!

<p>ZENO.

<p>Yea, my lord,<br>
We are well rid of Giocchi. As to Uzzi&mdash;

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Good! what of Uzzi?

<p>ZENO.

<p>He but stared upon me,<br>
And waving wide the fringes of his sleeve,<br>
Passed by without a word.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>And this from Uzzi!<br>
Time was when had an Uzzi but so much<br>
As laid his hand upon my grandsire's arm,<br>
An hundred swords had winged them to the light<br>
To thrust the insult back. O we are fallen!<br>
Our day is dead indeed.

<p>ZENO.

<p>Never so dead<br>
But it will rise again. There yet is one&mdash;

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Who? Who?

<p>ZENO.

<p>An honorable man, my lord,<br>
Of wealth so great, Rigoli, ay, or Giocchi,<br>
Could not heap up bajocchi to his scudi.<br>
One with a daughter as exceeding fair<br>
As the Rigoli's foul; a woman, Prince,<br>
As young as Giocchi's daughter, and as chaste<br>
As Uzzi's wife is not. And though no count&mdash;<br>
Have you not had enough of counts, my lord?<br>
A man of such high-reaching, quick ambition,<br>
That in default of wealth more merchantable,<br>
He 'd give his very life-blood, drop by drop,<br>
To see his daughter wedded honorably.<br>
Ah, I have heard him talk! no count, I say,<br>
But yet&mdash;

<p>OSALDI.

<p>No count? Belike a noble, then,<br>
In all but titles: simple seignior, Zeno,<br>
But of most gentle pedigree and station.

<p>ZENO.

<p>No pedigree, my lord; but patience! tell me<br>
Is it for names we suffer more this hour,<br>
Or gold to make the names which we possess<br>
As lustrous as they should be?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>But this seignior?<br>
This brave, discreet, and most ambitious father&mdash;<br>
What is he called, good Zeno?

<p>ZENO.

<p>Prince, you know him;<br>
Risifi is his name.

<p>OSALDI.
A merchant? Heavens!<br>
What have I done that you should mock me thus.<br>
A merchant! a Risifi! O have pity!

<p>ZENO.

<p>My lord, it is because of my great pity<br>
That I commend this same. A merchant, true,<br>
But yet a man of spotless honor also;<br>
No Uzzi, Prince, in this. A merchant, true,<br>
But yet with a most exquisite sweet daughter,<br>
And no Rigoli here. A merchant, yes,<br>
But one with mind to yield his daughter up,<br>
And in this also, neither churl nor Giocchi.<br>
My lord, if you do wed your son to her,<br>
You'll live to see three counts below your knee,<br>
And those are&mdash;

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Hold! this daughter, have you seen her?

<p>ZENO.

<p>Yea, I have seen her.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Is she merchant too?<br>
Are barter, bales, and commerce writ upon her;<br>
Shows she her blood, good Zeno?

<p>ZENO.

<p>Just so much<br>
As the rich rose shows it is born of briers;<br>
She is most lovely, Prince.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>And young, you say?

<p>ZENO.

<p>Scarce sixteen, yet, my lord.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>And chaste?

<p>ZENO.

<p>Ah, Prince,<br>
She wears her spirit plainly on her brow,<br>
A white star in a cloudless firmament.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Hum! and a merchant's daughter!

<p>ZENO.

<p>Virtue, Prince,<br>
Doth need no pedigree to make it lovely.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Nor gold, it seems. Ah, ah, and must it be?<br>
Must Ugo, mighty Ugo lend his blood<br>
To make Risifi great. It is too much. [<i>A pause.</i><br>
Zeno, the storm blows heavy on Osaldi<br>
And we must bend or break. If I were now<br>
A two score younger, I would cry, "Blow on<br>
And break us if thou can'st; we will not stoop."<br>
But I am old; my sons, my two brave sons<br>
Sit heavy at my heart, and so we bend;<br>
May Heav'n make light the storm o'erwhelming us!

<p>ZENO.

<p>It will, my lord, it will. O joyful day!<br>
O happy, happy day! O most kind day! [<i>Exit.</i>

<p>OSALDI, <i>bitterly</i>.

<p>Ah, happy day indeed! [<i>To</i> GIOVANNI.]<br>
Son, by your leave,<br>
Another word with you. Touching that matter<br>
We were engaged upon, if you do wed,<br>
'Tis certain you must wed a girl of dower;<br>
Is it not so?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>In truth it seems so, father.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>A girl of goodly dower; of wealth enough<br>
To build our old house up unto the height<br>
Of its late grandeur?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Certain, if possible.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Son, it is possible. Indeed, to tell you truly,<br>
I know of such a one. A fair girl too,<br>
Of beauty most bewitching, and though lacking<br>
In much that an Osaldi might desire,<br>
Possessing to the full the two great needs<br>
Of loveliness and riches. Can you trust me?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Trust you!

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Hold! you would ask if she is born<br>
Of a right noble race? Son, she is not;<br>
But lions crouch, and so may an Osaldi,<br>
If, like the lion, he rouse him with a spring.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Her name, father&mdash;her name?

<p>OSALDI, <i>embarrassed</i>.

<p>Her name, my son?<br>
Her name? Why ask! 'T will be Osaldi soon.<br>
Nay, then; her name? It is&mdash;it is Risifi,<br>
An honest one enough.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>The merchant's daughter?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>How! do you start at that? Are you so proud?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>No, no, not proud. I was but thinking, father,<br>
How base a thing it is for one who hoped<br>
To walk above all earthly littleness,<br>
To lead a trusting woman to the altar<br>
Just for the gold she brings.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>But gold brings power,<br>
And power brings honor; you will sit on thrones<br>
With riches for your bride; is that so base<br>
Boy, you are young, and look on life as yet<br>
From a mere hillock's top. To you the future<br>
Is but the present's dim continuance,<br>
And change a thing of circumstance, not self,<br>
Whereas self changes soonest. What to-day<br>
Seems to your youth the only good in life<br>
Will be, a five year hence, a cause of laughter,<br>
If not of secret shame and stern repentance.<br>
Life is no plain, however vast or varied,<br>
But rising ground, where every forward step<br>
Shifts the horizon. Then be wise, my son,<br>
And whilst you plan the present, O remember<br>
The manhood that will tower in the future,<br>
And give it room, room, room. And now no more;<br>
I go to plead with all the saints for thee,<br>
And a fair issue to our large endeavors.<br>
Keep counsel till we meet, and then I look<br>
To see thee smile again, for on thy smile<br>
A father's pleasure hangs; a father true,<br>
Who did thee once a wrong, but who in this<br>
Seeks for that wrong to make due recompense.

<p>[<i>Exit.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>So, so, thus does Giovanni seal his fate,<br>
Like all his race before him. Is it well?<br>
Alas, 'tis not for me to question it. [<i>A pause.</i><br>
And thou, sweet image, which, though seen but once,<br>
Hath ever dwelt within Giovanni's breast<br>
As type of earth's supremest loveliness;<br>
Thou who with one unconscious glance hath made<br>
A garden to blow ever in my thoughts;<br>
Must I then give thee up; forego the hope<br>
I scarcely knew was hope until I felt<br>
The wreck it made in crumbling into ruin;<br>
Toss from my soul the one pure joy it held<br>
Untarnished from the world, and bowing down<br>
My head unto the yoke of ancient custom,<br>
See all that makes life blessed float away<br>
With that one dream which formed my happiness?<br>
Yes; for the sake of these I love so well,<br>
My white-haired sire and him who calls me brother,<br>
This, and much more, must I, Giovanni, do:<br>
May Heaven receive the willing sacrifice!

<p><b>ACT II.</b></p>

<p>SCENE&mdash;<i>Large hall in the Osaldi palace.</i>

<p><i>Enter</i> LEON <i>and</i> SILVIO, <i>meeting</i>.

<p>LEON.

<p>What's this? What's this? Defiance from the south,<br>
And Florence filled with rumors of a war?

<p>SILVIO.

<p>So Beppo says, a man more slow to prick<br>
The gusty bags of rumor, than to act<br>
Upon th' event when it calls out for action.

<p>LEON.

<p>'Tis news to rouse Osaldi and awake<br>
The slumbering lion in Giovanni's breast.

<p>SILVIO.

<p>Look where he comes, brows bent and eyes cast down<br>
As though Ambition with its glowing wand<br>
Had stirred his humors up.

<p>[<i>Enter</i> GIOVANNI.

<p>SILVIO, <i>starting forward.</i>

<p>Giovanni! Count!

<p>LEON, <i>detaining SILVIO.</i>

<p>Stay, man, the hawk's in flight, let him soar on<br>
Unstayed by thee.

<p>SILVIO, <i>going</i>.

<p>Then here's for lower game.<br>
Alphonso waits within the antechamber;<br>
Let us to him.

<p>LEON.

<p>Good! I am with you there.

<p>[<i>Exeunt</i> LEON <i>and</i> SILVIO.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Where is the empty sphere, my home?<br>
Where is the will to measure will against;<br>
The rocks to wear to sands with my flood waves?<br>
Ah, if&mdash;stupendous if!&mdash;a war were near<br>
Hot with the smoke of conflict; if the wind<br>
Were blowing that should bear demanding cries<br>
For strength and valor; if the so small cloud<br>
That now is sailing upward from the south<br>
Should grow&mdash;Then woe and woe again&mdash;and yet,<br>
Proud inward giant, lion-souled Ambition,<br>
Thou 'dst have thy freedom then. Woe! Yet my soul<br>
Could hurtle 'gainst such woe and strike a flame<br>
Of lightning out. Ah, if the cannon shook<br>
The ground beneath men's feet; if glare were death<br>
And men were hurrying from this world in crowds,<br>
Then could I rise upon the reeking field<br>
And shake dilatingly my power out<br>
In face of those white brows. If need should come&mdash;<br>
If trembling quailing, halting, veering&mdash;men<br>
Drew back from vict'ry side by side with Death,<br>
Then I&mdash;<br>
Ah, old Thermopylae! thy Shades<br>
White, crowned and smiling as they smiled in death,<br>
Pass nigh and fill my breast with jealous shame<br>
That I can stretch no brother-hand to such!<br>
Ah, warrior-creating Marathon!<br>
That drew from clay great hero-souls, put sword<br>
In hand of Pleasure, pricked young men to deeds<br>
Which shake the world e'en now! Ah, Hannibal,<br>
Surrounded by thy long-haired heroines!<br>
O Crecy! Agincourt! and fields<br>
Where ev'n the grass that blooms grows quiveringly<br>
In pride of showing where a hero died!<br>
I 'm one of you, O warriors, and my feet<br>
Go ever wandering towards a battle-field.

<p>[<i>The castle bell rings.</i>

<p>Ha! what is that? [<i>Shouts within.</i>

<p>[<i>Enter LEON, followed by others.</i>

<p>How now, what means this noise?

<p>LEON.

<p>'Tis war's alarm! revolt is in the south<br>
And the Duke calls for soldiers.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>War? You mock me.<br>
Events rush not so close upon our wish,<br>
Else were we gods and circumstance our vassal.<br>
The soldier-steel that buckles to my side<br>
Hath shook its music in your ears and lo!<br>
You cry out War! in echo.

<p>LEON.

<p>No; my cry<br>
Is single and most true. From south and east<br>
Swells the loud call. Although the wind be low,<br>
There's import in it. In a few hours hence<br>
Osaldi's towers will shiver in its blast<br>
And his deep donjons tremble.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Welcome to it!<br>
So it shake ruin from our walls and ope<br>
A way to wealth without the aid of woman.<br>
But look, the Prince.

<p>[<i>Enter PRINCE.</i>

<p>LEON.

<p>We will remain no longer.

<p>[<i>Exeunt LEON and his companions.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI, kneeling.

<p>Father, your blessing! In yon clarion cry<br>
I hear a call worthy Osaldi's answer.<br>
Bless me and let me go.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Hath thy young blood<br>
Leaped to the call so quick?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Yea, as the echo<br>
Answers the huntsman's horn.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>'Tis well; but son,<br>
A man of princely blood goes not to war<br>
With his own sword alone. You must have men,<br>
And men means gold, and gold means&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Marriage?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Yes.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Oh, I had hoped the heavens had turned the scale<br>
Against that hard alternative. But fate<br>
Wills not to man both fame and happiness:<br>
He who would rest his daring foot on heights<br>
So single and so lofty, ev'n must learn<br>
To tread his own heart down.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>And you consent?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>At once, so this, as all things, speed me hence<br>
Unto the field of war.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>It shall, or nought<br>
Shall be by us concluded. Zeno, good friend,<br>
A mission for your wisdom.

<p>[<i>Enter ZENO.</i>

<p>How! your frowns<br>
Speak of fresh tidings. Well, what now? what now?

<p>ZENO.

<p>A delegation, Prince; a line of guests<br>
Drawn up before the gate in order soldierly;<br>
A goodly company.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Their names? condition?

<p>ZENO.

<p>Worthy their errand, if not worthy thee.<br>
Rigoli, master, Giocchi, and proud Uzzi,<br>
In all the pomp of retinue and horse.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Ha, the three foes most deadly to our pride,<br>
And seated at our gates! Well, let them sit.<br>
'Tis not to wed their daughters to my sons<br>
I warrant they have brought their insolent state<br>
To mock my house's poverty. Let them sit!<br>
Long rank has made us patient; we will see<br>
If their new honors bide the bit as well.

<p>ZENO.

<p>But, Prince, they bear the symbol of the Duke.<br>
Not petty counties, but all Florence speaks<br>
In their shrill trumps.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>So, so, as War's solicitors they come;<br>
'Tis insolence, but we'll meet it. Friend, your ear.<br>
Away to the Risifi; give him hope<br>
Of our alliance: bring us pledge of his,<br>
And let the whole be done within the moment<br>
As fast as horse can spring or wish can travel.

<p><i>[Exit ZENO.</i>

<p>O we will meet these upstarts, we will meet them!

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>The trumps grow clamorous.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>It is music, boy,<br>
Long known to these high walls. Let it sing on.<br>
A past like ours commands the present's patience.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>And yet for courtesy.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Hath ruin courtesy?<br>
Methought that ruin had no grace but pride.<br>
Yet since 'tis Florence speaks, hence to the gates<br>
And bid the strangers welcome in the name<br>
Of Country and the Duke. But first your arm<br>
Unto my chair of state. Whate'er betides,<br>
The single seat this room contains, holds <i>me</i>.

<p><i>[Seats himself.</i>

<p><i>[Exit GIOVANNI.</i>

<p>Ah, I will show these nobles of a day<br>
What stuff is in the man they seek to trample.

<p><i>[Enter GIOVANNI, ushering in RIGOLI, UZZI,<br>
and GIOCCHI with their suites.</i>

<p>RIGOLI.

<p>Greeting, my lord! Rigoli stands, your servant.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>'Tis well, Rigoli. Thus hath your sire stood,<br>
And your sire's sire before you. Yours too, Giocchi;<br>
And yours still more, proud Uzzi.

<p>UZZI.

<p>Sooth, my lord,<br>
One needs must stand in halls where seats are lacking.

<p>GIOCCHI.

<p>And cry himself your servant whom the Duke<br>
Honors with his commands.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>So, so, the Duke.<br>
Your courtesy, my lords, outsoars my thanks<br>
And puts my age to blush. Before such wit<br>
My threescore ten may well bow down its head<br>
And yield its seat unquestioning. <i>[Rises.</i><br>
Your wishes, seigniors;<br>
In deference to the Duke, I stand to listen.

<p>UZZI.

<p>'Tis well; the Duke shall know your complaisance;<br>
'T will please him, doubtless.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Come! your message, counts.

<p>RIGOLI.

<p>It is of war. Our lord Duke goes to war<br>
With all his chivalry. You have two sons?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Ay, ay.

<p>RIGOLI.

<p>Two sons of such an ancient house<br>
Should shed a beacon-light upon the field,<br>
Or so the good Duke thinks. Could you then spare<br>
Their youth to the fair cause&mdash;

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Well, well?

<p>RIGOLI.

<p>The Duke<br>
Would greet them with all honour, them and theirs&mdash;<br>
A hundred men accoutered to the full<br>
Were company sufficient&mdash;give them place<br>
And generalship; for even youth bath claims<br>
When fivescore men come pricking at their heels.<br>
And furthermore, the good Duke bids us say,<br>
That for the loan of such fair sums as you<br>
May in your wisdom deem commensurate<br>
With your past fame and present consequence,<br>
He shares with you in fairness such results<br>
As wait upon the enterprise.<br>
Such is our message; may your answer to it<br>
Be like your state: all substance if no show.

<p><i>[All bow mockingly.</i>

<p>OSALDI, <i>aside</i>.

<p>Now may the saints grant patience!<br>
Counts, my state<br>
Greets with indulgence your conspicuous effort<br>
At unaccustomed duties. May the years<br>
Bring you more aptitude. As for your message,<br>
It doeth honor to the Duke and me;<br>
My answer to it&mdash;

<p><i>[Aside to GIOVANNI]</i> See if Zeno comes!

<p><i>[To Counts]</i> I will consider.

<p><i>[Aside]</i> O to haste him hither!

<p>GIOCCHI.

<p>Stay! hear Rigoli out.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>What! is there <i>more?</i>

<p>RIGOLI.

<p>No more than this: that if as gossip prates<br>
The means are lacking to my lord the Prince<br>
To meet the hour's demands in manner fitting<br>
To his great name and famous heritage,<br>
The good Duke shows his mercy, and rememb'ring<br>
The loneliness of age, entreats of thee<br>
To keep thy hearthstone merry with thy sons,<br>
Since they are all that wretched fortune leaves thee.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Ah, ah, the Duke is kind and ye are kind.<br>
That look of decent shame and trembling awe<br>
Becomes your faces bravely. Thanks, my lords;<br>
Ruin, were ruin mine, would find a balm<br>
In such display of grateful sympathy.

<p><i>[They bow mockingly.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI, <i>aside to OSALDI.</i>

<p>Have patience, father; malice tips their scorn.

<p>OSALDI, <i>aside to GIOVANNI.</i>

<p>Patience? Oh, ay; such as the lion hath<br>
That leaps in thought with every burning throb<br>
Of his hot heart against the bars that cage him.<br>
No sign of Zeno yet?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>None yet, my lord.

<p>GIOCCHI.

<p>So, Prince, you understand us?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Ay, too well.<br>
Reverence and awe are easy read, my lords,<br>
So are servility and slavish fear.<br>
My grandsire Ugo read them plain enow<br>
Upon the faces of your ancestors.<br>
But come, enough of this. The Duke's command<br>
Awaits its answer. Let us&mdash;<br>
<i>[Aside]</i><br>
Ha, the sound And clatter of a horse within the court.

<p><i>[To GIOVANNI.]</i>

<p>Is 't Zeno? quick! who waits without there? speak!

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Zeno, my lord.

<p>OSALDI. <i>[To GIOVANNI.]</i>

<p>Good! Bid him give you straight<br>
The answer that he brings me. Note it, thou;<br>
And if it pleasure you, if fate has smiled,<br>
And the Risifi cries Amen! to us,<br>
Lift up your head on entering; but if No,<br>
Bow down your neck as God bows down our house<br>
Beneath the scornful heel of fortune's upstarts.

<p><i>[Exit GIOVANNI.</i>

<p>RIGOLI, <i>[Apart to UZZI.]</i>

<p>I know not why, but I like not his looks;<br>
Should he deceive us, we should show some small.

<p>UZZI, <i>[Apart to RIGOLI.]</i>

<p>It cannot be. Did'st mark the rats our steps<br>
Scared from the arras? They were lean, my lord;<br>
Lean rats bespeak scant larders.

<p>RIGOLI <i>[Apart to GIOCCHI.]</i>

<p>And proud looks,<br>
A store of hidden ducats.

<p>GIOCCHI <i>Apart to RIGOLI.</i>

<p>Do not think it.<br>
Watch how he trembles, how his old head sinks<br>
With less and lesser hope upon his breast.<br>
No ducats there, good friends.

<p>OSALDI, <i>[With effort, his eyes fixed on the door.]</i>

<p>My noble seigniors,<br>
The hour has come to answer. Tell the Duke<br>
That the Osaldis' fortunes have not kept<br>
Strict pace with their desires. Time was when word<br>
Like this from the good Duke had met response<br>
As thunder follows lightning. But years and folly,<br>
Love, and the calls of war, have pricked our coffers,<br>
And they stand somewhat drained.<br>
We&mdash;<i>[with greater effort]</i> are poor&mdash;

<p><i>[Door opens, GIOVANNI enters, head erect.]</i>

<p><i>[OSALDI'S voice rings out.]</i>

<p>Ay as ye guessed, my lords. To the demand<br>
Of the great Duke for soldiers, we can send<br>
But thrice a hundred, duly armed and mounted,<br>
Instead of the five thousand he had thought<br>
Consonant with our greatness. As for money&mdash;<br>
Ten thousand scudi paid at once in full,<br>
Must meekly ask indulgence of the Duke<br>
For the round fifty we had hoped to send him.<br>
Is it enow to give my sons a place<br>
In front of danger?

<p>RIGOLI, <i>embarrassed</i>.

<p>Quite enow, my lord.<br>
<i>[Aside]</i> The old fox <i>has</i> deceived us.

<p>GIOCCHI.

<p>Noble prince,<br>
Florence owns you its debtor. For this gift<br>
Accept our thanks and our most humble service.<br>
Giocchi salutes you.

<p>RIGOLI.

<p>And Rigoli.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Good my lords,<br>
For this same bending of your haughty necks<br>
My purse returns you suitable reverence.

<p>RIGOLI.

<p>His pride o'erwhelms us; let us hence at once.<br>
Farewell, Osaldi; your sons we meet anon.

<p><i>[Is about to pass, but pauses and looks back.</i>

<p>As for the matter of my daughter, Prince&mdash;

<p>OSALDI.

<p>My lord, the jest was answered. My deserts,<br>
Ay, and my fame,&mdash;small as it is,&mdash;you say,<br>
Lift us above your daughter. It is well;<br>
I would not add to your humility;<br>
Speak of the thing no more.

<p><i>[RIGOLI passes on.]</i>

<p>UZZI.

<p>Uzzi departs,<br>
But not without repentance. Should my lord<br>
Still wish to wed his son unto my daughter&mdash;

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Uzzi might pause. Pass on, pass on, my lord,<br>
We need you not. Upon your crooked soul<br>
Repentance sits askew.

<p>GIOCCHI.

<p>Take Giocchi's farewell.<br>
As for the lightness of our seeming scorn,<br>
Accept the sorrow of our better nature,<br>
And speak not of our folly to the Duke.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>I am Osaldi, seignior, and not Giocchi;<br>
I never speak of folly. Hence! away!

<p><b>ACT III.</b></p>

<p><b>SCENE I.</b>&mdash;<i>A room in the Osaldi palace.</i>

<p><i>Enter GIOVANNI and ZENO.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>You say she's fair.

<p>ZENO.

<p>Most fair; her innocent face<br>
Hath that sweet look which comes from gentle thoughts,<br>
And in the glance of her large, lucent eye<br>
A witchery dwells that many a princely dame<br>
Would give her ancient pedigree to add<br>
Unto her store of charms. O you will love her<br>
When you shall see her.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Think you so, good Zeno?<br>
A heart like mine springs not at bliss so lightly.<br>
If kindness starts unbidden in my breast<br>
At touch of her soft spirit, it is all<br>
My anxious soul dare hope. But to th' affair<br>
For Which we 'ye met. As matters look to-day<br>
'Tis time I saw and swore allegiance to<br>
This fair bewitchment, lest the call to war<br>
Come e'er our force and armament be ready.

<p>ZENO.

<p>So thinks the noble Prince, and so, Risifi;<br>
Wherefore it chances that on Agnes' eve<br>
The lordly merchant throws his portals wide<br>
For your betrothal.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Agnes' eve? 'Tis soon.

<p>ZENO.

<p>Meantime your father prays that all be kept<br>
Secret as heretofore. Your brother&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Well?

<p>ZENO.

<p>Comes from the hunt to-day. See that he smiles<br>
In happy ignorance of what his youth<br>
May deem a degradation to his name,<br>
Till the event be certain and his scorn<br>
Fall pointless on the fixed shield of fate.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Unwelcome tidings are as restless, seignior,<br>
As untrained falcons, and will fly, I ween,<br>
Whether we will or no.

<p>ZENO.

<p>Not if the jess<br>
Be strong and the hand steady.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Well, well, well.

<p><i>[Exit ZENO.</i>

<p>So, SO! but three days now, and honor, wealth,<br>
The pomp of generalship, and pride of power<br>
Will be my own, and life be set at last<br>
Within the groove of action. 'Tis an end<br>
Towards which my thoughts have run since youth took on<br>
Color from high ambition; yet, alas!<br>
Where is the joy with which I looked to see<br>
This hour of triumph crowned? Gone with the love<br>
That flushed the arid mountain tops of fame<br>
With lustre not their own. Thus runs the life<br>
Of man towards disappointment. To be great,<br>
Fits not with to be happy. Ah, base wretch,<br>
Who would have all or none; what, then, is love?<br>
A dream, a flitting dream. Shall the ship pause<br>
Because the breath of orange-groves comes sweet<br>
From some near siren isle? What says my sire,<br>
A man whose heart for threescore years and ten<br>
Hath run the gamut of earth's joys and sorrows,<br>
And touched its every chord: "In man's short span<br>
He runs on many a hope. To-day 'tis love<br>
That seems his only good; to-morrow, knowledge;<br>
A five year hence, pow'r and the chance to wield it;<br>
A decade later all his thought is profit;<br>
Then comes old age, and with it joys of ease,<br>
And life again in his posterity."<br>
It is the voice of wisdom, but alas!<br>
What youth e'er gave it heed without the aid<br>
Of harsh experience. <i>[A pause.</i><br>
Ah, what is life!<br>
'Tis but a passing touch upon the world;<br>
A print upon the beaches of the earth<br>
Next flowing wave will wash away; a mark<br>
That something passed; a shadow on a wall,<br>
While looking for the substance, shade departs;<br>
A drop from the vast spirit-cloud of God<br>
That rounds upon a stock, a stone, a leaf,<br>
A moment, then exhales again to God.

<p><i>[Enter CAMILLO, singing.</i>

<p><i>My lady sits at her casement;<br>
O heav'n, how fair, how fair!<br>
The jessamine vines about her<br>
Make halo round her hair:<br>
I see, and longing, lift in singing<br>
The joy and pain within me springing.</i>

<p><i>My lady smiles from her casement;<br>
She plucks a flow'r and stands,<br>
Holding it close to her bosom<br>
In two white tremulous hands:<br>
The songs I sing leap high and higher,<br>
Pleading like hungry flames of fire.</i>

<p><i>My lady leans from her casement;<br>
The flow'r has felt her kiss;<br>
Body and soul I kneel to meet it,<br>
The moment heaves with bliss,<br>
When lo! she speaks, and "Love, to thee,"<br>
She whispers, "far away on sea,<br>
This kiss, and this, and this."</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Brother, your mood is merry.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Sooth, why not?<br>
Does not the sun shine? Do I not fare well?<br>
And have not all the prettiest girls in Florence<br>
Smiled on me from their casements? Tut, Giovanni,<br>
Like our famed grandsire, you are too ambitious,<br>
Your spirit is too broad. The hungry sea<br>
Hath need of all the stars to make it bright,&mdash;<br>
A stream's content with one.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Ambitious? I?<br>
Well, yes, I am ambitious; should I be<br>
A true Osaldi else? The pow'r that shone<br>
From Ugo's martial front and made our name<br>
A trump to call all Tuscany to battle,<br>
Is not so dead that you or I can stand<br>
Upon the verge of war and not feel start<br>
The fine responsive blood. I would behold<br>
Our father smile again, and see thee sit<br>
High as our rank demands.

<p>CAMILLO, <i>bitterly</i>.

<p>Our rank!

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>How now!<br>
You sigh, Camillo, you upon whose youth<br>
The sun has shone and pretty maidens smiled.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Sigh? Nay, not so, or if by chance I did,<br>
'T was as the breezes sigh amid the blooms<br>
Of honeyed forests. Joy weighs hard as pain<br>
And oft-times owns a kindred language.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>True;
Yet now you sigh again, and if my ear<br>
Translates the tone aright, not joy but grief<br>
Speaks to the heart in that uneasy echo.<br>
If sorrow's tooth has touched your gaysome youth,<br>
It fits my love to know it. Speak and learn<br>
How light a grief can grow when shared by friendship.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>It is not much; at least to your discretion<br>
'T will not seem much. I love and love in vain.<br>
'Tis a boy's grief, why note it?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Love? <i>You</i> love?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Ay, but I said 't was nought; spare me your mocks;<br>
I know 'tis folly, yet man lives by love,<br>
And folly makes the paradise cif youth.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>I mock? And whom&mdash;But no; to ask thee that<br>
Were to intrude within the sacred spot<br>
Which each man holds most chary from his fellows&mdash;<br>
The sacred human heart: I ask not that;<br>
But why in vain, Camillo, why in vain?<br>
Beauty like yours would start a tender thought<br>
Within a breast of stone; why then in vain?<br>
Are maidens' hearts so very hard to win?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>That I know not, Giovanni; I but know<br>
This maid's was not if that the merriest eye<br>
Which e'er smiled mercy to a suppliant<br>
Spake truth in its soft language. But, alas!<br>
In this hard world of place and circumstance<br>
Fate rears up other barriers to delight<br>
Than that of love repelled. I am no mate<br>
For this sweet damsel, or by thy proud code<br>
She is no mate for me. By rank a prince,<br>
I may not wed&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Well, well?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>A tradesman's daughter.<br>
Ah, I wot well you 'd start.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>If I did start<br>
It was with wonder at the impish tricks<br>
With which fate mocks us men. A tradesman's daughter!<br>
And you can love her and esteem yourself<br>
Rich if she smiles, and blest if you but wear<br>
Her beauty like a jewel on your heart.<br>
Well, well, this barrier to your rightful joy<br>
May prove less lofty than your fears imagine.<br>
Hast told our father?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>'T were an effort lost;<br>
I know his mind too well.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Yet had'st thou told him&mdash;

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>And heard my darling scorned? Nay, nay; my heart<br>
Is large enough for anguish, but too small<br>
To hug a shame within it.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Humph! and yet<br>
You dearly love her.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Love her? Hear the whole.<br>
It was a day in June, and I who prize<br>
The song of birds and all those shy delights<br>
That hide within the forest's bosky glens,<br>
Above the earthlier charms of street and mart,<br>
Was wandering in the vales without the town,<br>
When suddenly from out their ambient shade<br>
A creature stepped of such entrancing mien,<br>
I felt I ne'er in all my life before<br>
Had looked on mortal beauty. Young she was,<br>
And innocent as holy temples are<br>
Whose atmosphere is worship. Straight to knee<br>
I sank all trembling, soul and body both<br>
Acknowledging unwittingly their mistress;<br>
But of what followed it were hard to tell,<br>
Since lapsed in joy, I scarce remember more<br>
Than that I heard her voice and felt the clasp<br>
Of her shy hand as from the wood's recess<br>
I led her to her fellows. Earth and air<br>
Had felt the touch of heav'n, and in the shock<br>
My dazzled spirit reeled. Nor of that hour<br>
When pricked to action by my love and longing<br>
I sought those woods again, and roaming, came<br>
Upon her musing by the streamlet's bank,<br>
A smile like heav'n upon her innocent mouth,<br>
And in her eyes that look which lifts the spirit<br>
Up as on wings of light, I may not speak.<br>
It is enough that when with late discretion<br>
I asked her name I&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Well?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Knew what despair was.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>So, you forsook her?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>What was left to love<br>
Since fate and duty to our sire decreed<br>
I could not be her husband?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>This was when?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Some seven long weeks ago. It seems a lifetime.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>And you remember?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Will I e'er forget?

<p>GIOVANNI, <i>after a pause.</i>

<p>Brother, your case is not so lost to hope<br>
As it would seem. I may not tell you more,<br>
But if you'll meet me at Risifi's villa<br>
Upon the eve of blessed Agnes day,<br>
You will yourself&mdash;

<p>CAMILLO, <i>falling back.</i>

<p>Risifi! then you know&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>A merchant? Yes, and, stranger still, may soon,<br>
Be pleased to know a merchant's lovesome daughter.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>What secret is there here?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Ask not, but trust<br>
Your fate to Heav'n, and meet me as I 'ye said.<br>
Grim doom holds not such clutch upon our souls,<br>
But sometimes in this harsh, uneasy world,<br>
Our boldest wishes meet with strange fulfilment.

<p><b>SCENE II.</b>&mdash;<i>A vale without Florence.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huntsmen's horns heard in the distance.

<p><i>Enter GIOVANNI and LEON.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>'Tis my last hunt. Through all the rousing din<br>
Of yon mad horns I hear the sound of trumps<br>
Calling me hence to battle. O the joy<br>
Of freedom to the soul that long hath lain<br>
Behind the bars of straitening circumstance!<br>
Scarce can I bide the hour of my release,<br>
My heart calls so for action.

<p>LEON.

<p>And your bride?<br>
The fair young maiden that awaits your troth-plight,<br>
Have you no thought for her!

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>My bride? Ah, Leon,<br>
My bride is fame. I have no heart to give<br>
To fairest woman now. A shadow dwells<br>
Where once such hopes had birth.

<p><i>[Enter at a distance GINEVRA, followed by BIANCA.</i>

<p>But who is this?

<p>LEON.

<p>I know not, seignior, yet her beauty shows<br>
Triumphant in these shades. Methinks her glance<br>
Makes the whole place to shine.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Ah, heaven! yes, yes.<br>
Leon, once since her face seen thus by chance<br>
Hath roused the passion of my manhood up,<br>
And filled my soul with homage. Hath stern fate<br>
Sent her this way to tempt me? Let's away!<br>
I will not meet her look, her innocent look,<br>
So tender, yet so blithe. Risifi's daughter<br>
Hath claims upon me now that make such dreams<br>
A sinful madness.

<p>LEON.

<p>What! you love this stranger?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>I love my honor. Let us hence, good Leon,<br>
For me the hunt is o'er.

<p>LEON.

<p>And this is life!

<p><i>[Exeunt GIOVANNI and LEON.</i>

<p><i>GINEVRA, coming forward.</i>

<p>I 'm weary, my Bianca, let us rest.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Yes, lady, but not here.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>And why not here?

<p>BIANCA.

<p>The place is dark. I dread the chill which breathes<br>
From out these clustering boughs.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>I feel no chill.<br>
I love this heavy shade, this brooding gloom;<br>
My thoughts make light enough. I scarce could breathe<br>
For rising rapture, were there sunlight too.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>But lady&mdash;

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Nay, Bianca, cross me not.<br>
I see no shadows here. The place to me<br>
Is bright as summer and as sweet as June.<br>
Rich-blooded birds and flow'rs inch-deep with honey<br>
Hide in its soft recess; while to my ears<br>
All the wild passion of a young joy pants<br>
In the quick tremble of its laughing leaves.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>And you enjoy such music?

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Yes; did'st doubt it?<br>
Because I pinch your ears and steal your gauds<br>
And play you tricks and laugh from morn till night,<br>
Did'st think my spirit owned no deeper mood?<br>
The maddest brook that trips it through the glen<br>
Has here and there along its joyous course<br>
Shy resting-places for its tired foot<br>
And spots for quiet musing. <i>This</i> is mine:<br>
Then leave me to my dreams.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>The girl who dreams<br>
In bow'rs like these where not a sunbeam dwells,<br>
Has sweetest mem'ries linked unto its gloom,<br>
Or such bright hopes they strike a color through<br>
Its darkest portals. Hast such mem'ries, lady?

<p>GINEVRA, <i>startled</i>.

<p>I? Yes, in sooth, of many a gaysome hour<br>
Spent at your side with lute or harp or book;<br>
What other could I have? But how? You start.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>I thought I heard a step.

<p>GINEVRA, <i>singing</i>.

<p><i>You hear the winds at antic play,<br>
You hear the brooks sing roundelay,<br>
The flow'rs you hear, coquetting, dear,<br>
But not&mdash;</i>

<p>Nay, then I'll quit my pranks,<br>
I cannot bide your frowns. You sigh for sunshine.<br>
Go, then; I'll join you soon.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Upon the terrace?

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Yea, on the terrace.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Good! I will wait thee there.<br>
Only as you do love me, gentle lady,<br>
Linger not here too long. Remember, madam,<br>
That your good father hath some words of import<br>
To say to thee to-night.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>I will remember.<br>
Pray they be words of joy.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>They are indeed; <i>[Aside.</i><br>
Or should be if some wandering dream of love<br>
Hath not made ruthless havoc with a soul<br>
We thought as free as air. <i>[Exit.</i>

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>The good Bianca! as little doth she reck that<br>
happy accident hath already given to my ears the<br>
gist of her most wonderful secret, as that this son<br>
of the Osaldi, whom my father in his wisdom hath<br>
seen fit to accept for my bridegroom, is that stranger<br>
to my eyes which they in their most fortunate<br>
ignorance seem to consider him. But fate is a gay<br>
trickster and plays mad pranks with us all. 'Tis<br>
not the first time the untoward lifting of a curtain<br>
hath brought strange counsels to light. The young<br>
Osaldi! Well, well, he is certainly a most exquisite<br>
gallant. His Good-day, lady, and his Good-even<br>
to you are flavored with the cream of perfectest<br>
courtesy. Then, for a Tuscan, he hath also<br>
a certain comeliness; but have I not sworn, in<br>
good-faith too, that I would not wed a Tuscan were<br>
he the best-made man in Italy? Then there is his<br>
glance, which proclaims to my understanding that<br>
he loves me&mdash;which same seems over-bold. But,<br>
then, his smile! Well, for a smile it certainly does<br>
credit to his wit; but I cannot live upon smiles,<br>
though if I could, I might consent to make a trial<br>
of his,&mdash;and starve belike for my pains.

<p><i>[Muses.</i>

<p><i>[Enter CAMILLO.</i>

<p>CAMILLO, <i>aside</i>.

<p>She's here, and my heart's language hath not<br>
deceived me. Now if it be true, as my brother's<br>
words seem to betoken, that love and fortune await<br>
me on St. Agnes' Eve at the house of her father, it<br>
can be no treason to my future fate to breathe<br>
forth one breath of the passion that consumes me.<br>
<i>[Aloud]</i> Lady?

<p>GINEVRA, <i>aside</i>.

<p>'Tis he. Now heart be still, and wit be all alert<br>
to hide my maiden shame.

<p>CAMILLO, <i>aside</i>.

<p>She does not hear me; or can it be that the<br>
mockery of her spirit hath obtained mastery over<br>
her tenderness? I must determine. <i>[Advances.</i><br>
Fair lady, greeting! A kiss for your sweet thoughts.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>A kiss, Seignior Camillo? That were a poor<br>
exchange for thoughts like mine; so if it please you<br>
I will keep my thoughts and you your kiss; and<br>
lest it should seem ungracious in me to give nothing<br>
upon your asking, I will bestow upon you my<br>
most choice Good-day, and so leave you to your<br>
meditations. <i>[Is about to withdraw.</i>

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>You have the true generosity, lady; you give<br>
away what it costs you the most to part from.<br>
Nay, rumple not your lip; it is the truth, for all<br>
your pretty poutings. Convince me it is not.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Your pardon; but that would take words, and<br>
words would take time, and time given to one of<br>
your persuasion would refute all my arguments on<br>
the face of them.<br>

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Well, lady, since it is your pleasure to be<br>
consistent rather than happy, adieu. Had you stayed<br>
but so long as the bee pauses on an oleander blossom,<br>
you had heard&mdash;

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Buzzing, seignior?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Yes, if by that word you would denominate vows<br>
of constancy and devotion. For I do greatly love<br>
you and would tell you so.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>And for that you expect me to linger! as though<br>
vows were new to my ears and words of love as<br>
strange to my understanding as tropical birds to<br>
the eyes of a Norseman.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>If you do love me you will linger.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Yet if I do, be sure it is from some other motive than love.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>So it be not from hate, I am contented.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p> To be contented with little proves you to be a man<br>
of much virtue.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>When I have you, I am content with much.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>That <i>when</i> is a wise insertion, seignior; it saves<br>
you from shame and me from anger. Hark! some one comes.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>'Tis but the wind. It is a kindly breeze and<br>
grieves to hear a pretty maid so harsh unto her lover.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>I do not own a lover, please your worship.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Then mend your poverty and accept one, lady.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>I am too young to wear a jewel so pretentious.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Time is a cure for youth and marriage a happy speeder of time.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>But youth needs no cure, and if marriage speedeth<br>
time, I'll live a maid and die one. The days<br>
run swift enough without goading, Seignior Camillo.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>But, lady&mdash;

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Nay, but your tongue will outstrip time if you<br>
put not a curb upon it. I' faith, seigmior, I would<br>
not seem rude, but if in your courtesy you would<br>
consent to woo some other maiden to-day, why, I<br>
would strive to bear it. You are not so handsome<br>
seignior, that one would die for you.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>No, lady; but what goes to make other men's<br>
faces fair, goes to make my heart great. The<br>
virtue of my manhood lies in the fact that I love you.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Faith, you are not alone in that. 'Tis the<br>
common fault of the gallants I find. If that is all&mdash;

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>But I will always love you, ev'n to death.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>I doubt it not so death come soon enough.

<p>CAMILLO, <i>drawing his poniard.</i>

<p>Would'st have it come here and now and so prove<br>
me true to my word?

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>I am no judge, to utter the doom your presumption merits.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Your looks speak doom and your sweet lips hide<br>
a sword keener than that of justice.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Have you tried them, seignior, that you speak so<br>
knowingly concerning them? <i>[Retreats.]</i> Your<br>
words, methinks, are somewhat like your kisses, all<br>
breath and no substance.

<p>CAMILLO, <i>following her.</i>

<p>Lady? Sweet one?

<p><i>[Enter LEON.</i>

<p>LEON.

<p>I may not rest until I learn the name and quality<br>
of the fair maid whom my lord has so long loved<br>
to his undoing. <i>[Sees CAMILLO and GINEVRA.]</i><br>
Ah, whom have we here? The lady by my life,<br>
and hand in hand with a gallant. Ah, my Giovanni,<br>
well was it that you hastened hence before<br>
this tender scene acquainted you with the reverse<br>
of love's sweet image, bitter jealousy. But who<br>
is the fortunate youth who hath thus stolen your<br>
treasure? I must see his face. Good heaven! it<br>
is Camillo! I smell trouble here.

<p><i>[Exeunt CAMILLO and GINEVRA in tender converse.</i>

<p>So, so, the youth's fair face, undaunted mien,<br>
And that address which tops his beauty off<br>
As music completes paradise, have won<br>
This maiden for him, and my lord knows not<br>
That she is doubly lost him. Well, well, well!<br>
The fair Ginevra's charms must heal the wounds<br>
This strange event will cause him.

<p><i>[Re-enter BIANCA.</i>

<p>LEON.

<p>Your favor, lady.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Seignior, and yours. I seek my youthful mistress,<br>
The fair Ginevra, whom I left but now
Amid these shadows.

<p>LEON.

<p>How? What name say you?

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Ginevra, seignior.

<p>LEON.

<p>Not Risifi's daughter?

<p>BIANCA.

<p>The same, fair stranger.

<p>LEON.

<p>Trebly cursed Giovanni!

<p>BIANCA, <i>startled</i>.

<p>What? what?

<p>LEON.

<p>Madam, dost know this lady is to wed<br>
The Count Giovanni ere another week
Passes o'er Florence?

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Yea, I know it;<br>
Her sire told me this morn. But she knows nought.<br>
Went she this way?

<p>LEON.

<p>Yea, and her lover with her.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Her lover? Oh! <i>[Is about to rush away.</i>

<p>LEON, <i>detaining her.</i>

<p>Lady, a word I pray you.<br>
Art sure she knew nought of her coming marriage<br>
When she strayed hence?

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Most sure. Her father waits<br>
Ev'n now to tell her. O may Heav'n decree<br>
That tricksy Love lie close to-day and play<br>
No idle pranks with that gay heart of hers<br>
Before the hour be come. A lover, say you?<br>
O I have stayed too long. <i>[Exit.</i>

<p>LEON.

<p>Run, run! thy feet<br>
Will ne'er outspeed the winged boy you fear!<br>
<i>[Re-enter CAMILLO.</i><br>
Ah, but this youth must know he wrongs his brother<br>
In worshipping at this merry maiden's shrine.<br>
How speeds the day, Camillo? <i>[Advances.</i>

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Gayly, Leon.<br>
Joys that have quivered in the scale till now,<br>
Have over-balanced grief. I am a man<br>
Crowned for all time. The maid I love, loves me.<br>
Wot you of greater rapture?

<p>LEON.

<p>Hush, O hush!<br>
Such words will sting you when you hear to whom<br>
This maiden's faith belongs. She is not yours<br>
Howe'er you love, or howsoe'er may she;<br>
The husband destined for her by her sire<br>
Is not yourself, but&mdash;

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Hold! not mine, this maiden?<br>
O Leon, have you weighed the words of doom<br>
You toss so lightly towards me?

<p>LEON.

<p>Fully, seignior;<br>
The fair Ginevra is no wayside flow'r<br>
To be plucked for the liking. Pride and power<br>
Rule o'er her sweetness and command her grace,<br>
And little as she recks the fate that waits her,<br>
All that she hath of charm in form and feature<br>
Is promised hence and&mdash;

<p><i>[CAMILLO reels, LEON rushes forward.</i>

<p>O my Camillo,<br>
Remember you 're a man. Be not o'ercome<br>
By youth's most common grief. The maid is fair,<br>
But so is Bisto's daughter, so the heir<br>
Of proud Colonna's house. There still are left<br>
Others as choice as she.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Others, Leon?<br>
Love sees not others, Love sees but the one;

<p>And when that one is lost, proves false, or dies,<br>
The charm of life, its beauty and its worth,<br>
Fade with her from the world.

<p>LEON.

<p>Is love like this?<br>
Well were it, then, you should not seek to snatch it<br>
From one you hold so near in your observance.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>From one I hold so near? What mean you, Leon?<br>
O God, it is not&mdash;

<p>LEON.

<p>Seignior!

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Not Giovanni?&mdash;<br>
Your silence does convict you. It is he,<br>
My brother, my own brother.

<p>LEON.

<p>But none knew<br>
You loved the maiden.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>O believe it not!<br>
Giovanni knew, else why his strict command<br>
To meet him in Risifi's halls this eve.<br>
Giovanni knew, and, filled with jealous pride,<br>
Bade Hope regain her seat within my breast<br>
That he might shame me 'fore the world and her.<br>
O cruel spite of joy! O selfish heart!<br>
That, drunk with its own bliss, could rise and fling<br>
Its triumph in my face to make me mad.<br>
But let him look to it: I am no child;<br>
He bids me to the feast,&mdash;<i>I will be there.</i>

<p><i>[Going.</i>

<p>LEON.

<p>But Seignior&mdash;

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Wait; you are my faithful friend,<br>
True as my own heart's core. Let no man know<br>
I died but now to youth, and hope, and love. <i>[Exit.</i>

<p>LEON.

<p>He bears it ill. His looks proclaim his vengeance.<br>
Wert wisdom to give warning to Giovanni?<br>
No, that were treason. But I'll watch the lad,<br>
Follow his steps, and wait upon his moods,<br>
And be on hand to hinder any mischief. <i>[Exit.</i>

<p><i>Re-enter GINEVRA and BIANCA.</i>

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>What words are these? You mock me, good Bianca,<br>
Or I have heard amiss.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Not so, not so.<br>
Your father waits but now to give you tidings<br>
Of your betrothal to Osaldi's heir.<br>
He whom you love is not Osaldi's heir;<br>
Only the heir's young brother.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>And I live,<br>
I who should die!

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Madam, be comforted.<br>
If Count Giovanni show a lesser grace<br>
Than the young gallant who has won your heart,<br>
He still is called a lordly gentleman,<br>
Noble and kind. A night of sober thought<br>
Will blast this transient fancy in your breast<br>
And fit you for your fate.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Never! I feel it.<br>
These fancies, as you style them, my Bianca,<br>
That blossom to the heavens in a moment,<br>
Strike root as deep as is despair itself,<br>
In such a heart as mine. 'T will take a wrench<br>
Vigorous as that which twists the life-strings free<br>
To tear it hence. No pow'r save that of Heav'n<br>
Can e'er undo what this one hour has done,<br>
Alas, alas the hour!

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Yet rest thee, lady.<br>
Who knows; perchance thy father yet may please<br>
To grant thee thy desire. Is not Camillo<br>
Of blood as truly noble as his brother?<br>
And is not your most honorable father<br>
Tender of her he loves?

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Ay, to a point,<br>
But he 'll ne'er brook a folly. To the wife<br>
Of Count Giovanni, heir to princely titles,<br>
He 'd give his heart for food; but to the girl<br>
Who dared to cross his lifetime's one ambition,<br>
He 'd be as cruel as the Roman lord<br>
Who stabbed his daughter to her shuddering heart<br>
To save her from dishonor.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Then, fair lady,<br>
Since this is so, 't were surely wisdom's part<br>
To take the fate which kindly Heav'n sends you,<br>
Prompt to accept its good. Too often, madam,<br>
We scorn the cup pressed iron-like to our lips,<br>
Which, if once tasted, would be found to teem<br>
With wine of heavenliest vintage.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Not this cup, Bianca.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>You have not tasted it.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>I know, I know.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Take courage, lady; think that duty bears<br>
Perennial sweets, while joy blooms for a day.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>I will, Bianca. Upon Duty, then,<br>
I fix my constant faith; and since it runs<br>
Counter to joy, why, farewell youth's glad hopes;<br>
Farewell the merry heart and laughing brow;<br>
I have another business in this world<br>
Than to link hands with Pleasure. <i>[Exeunt</i>

<p><b>ACT IV.</b></p>

<p>SCENE&mdash;<i>Vast hall in the Risifi villa. Pages within.</i>

<p><i>Enter ANTONIO.</i>

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>Are all the candles lit? Are the musicians ready?<br>
Is every thing in train? The curtains&mdash;hang they<br>
fair? Look to them, you, and hark you, sirrah, if<br>
I hear anon of so much lacking as a single candle,<br>
I will see you all beat from this hall to the street,<br>
before sunrising. I would have this day remembered<br>
here in Florence, and by my steward's wand<br>
it shall be, or let me never feast another prince in<br>
rich Risifi's villa. <i>[Enter PAULO.</i><br>
So you are come at last. What say you, man,<br>
Are all things well disposed? Think you these rooms<br>
Will bear inspection? Is there finish here?<br>
A prince's eye is critical. What say you, then;<br>
Look we like lords or no?

<p>PAULO.

<p>Too much like lords<br>
And much too little like the men we are.<br>
Pah! this display is odious.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>How? how? how?
What is amiss? Do you not like these hangings?<br>
They are the costliest to be found in Florence;<br>
I hope they 're not amiss.

<p>PAULO.

<p>They are too new;<br>
They smell too rank of the loom.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>And yet they 're scented;<br>
I had the choicest odors flung upon them,<br>
Where is your nose, man?

<p>PAULO.

<p>In its place, Antonio;<br>
Not flung half way in air like some I wot of.<br>
If you would save the lintels to the doors<br>
Lower your crest a space. A man would think<br>
The crowns of all broad Europe had been piled<br>
One on the other o'er that brow of yours,<br>
In toppling insecurity.

<p>PAGE.

<p>Is your new doublet<br>
Too narrow for your stomach that you puff so?

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>Boy, to the scullions! Do you criticise<br>
The man who caters to a noble prince?<br>
As for you, Paulo, were it not indeed<br>
That you 're a poor lean man unworthy greatness,<br>
We 'd measure swords for this.

<p>PAULO.

<p>Peace, peace, Antonio;<br>
Doublets of such rare precious stuff as thine<br>
Are never strong.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>How? how? not strong, my doublet?<br>
He said my doublet; here, you sirrah, you,<br>
Am I in trim? What folly 'tis in man<br>
To huff at a fool's babbling.<br>
<i>[Page stumbles by with wine.</i><br>
Heav'ns, what damage now?

<p>PAGE.

<p>Truth, good Antonio, if I might so speak,<br>
You wear your feet too large.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>My feet? too large?<br>
You say too large? What think you now, young sirrah?<br>
Are they too large for this and this and this? <i>[Kicks him.</i>

<p>PAGE.

<p>O! O! O! O! much too large: much, much, much! <i>[Exeunt</i>

<p><i>Enter RISIFI, OSALDI, GIOVANNI, URBINO, ZENO, and LEON.</i>

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Seignior Risifi, to my mind this thing<br>
Shows but one face and that is, business, business.<br>
You give us gold, we give you rank, 'tis done,<br>
The compact's sealed, and compliment is useless.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>My lord, I would not weary you with words,<br>
But you mistake me here. Not as a churl,<br>
But as a host I offer you my welcome,<br>
Which as a guest you may receive, my lord,<br>
And never stoop were you the Duke himself.<br>
I never vaunt me of my bargains, Prince,<br>
Merchantman though I be. To a Risifi<br>
Success is boast enough; the world is quick<br>
To spy out facts without a pointing finger,<br>
And this thing is a fact. Albeit a trader,<br>
I am as proud as any peer in Florence;<br>
Let my lord rest content.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Seignior, your wisdom<br>
Puts my old age to shame. Henceforth behold<br>
A prince of ancient lineage and fame<br>
Who sees his son, the heir to all his honors,<br>
Wed a Risifi and forbears to boast it.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>My lord says well; 'tis not a thing to boast of.<br>
Dost think to ruffle me? Do you not see<br>
The more you stand upon your rank, my lord,<br>
The more I mount and mount? Disdain my gold<br>
And scoff at him who sells his best for it,<br>
Not at the man who gives what you despise,<br>
To win the thing you hold in noblest favor.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Seignior, as guest, I would refrain from answering<br>
Wit so acute. Zeno, your arm.

<p>URBINO, <i>aside to RISIFI.</i>

<p>Good master,<br>
Rouse not the old man's wrath too far, I pray,<br>
Lest he should break with you.

<p>RISIFI, <i>aside to URBINO.</i>

<p>He 'd break his old heart first.

<p>ZENO, <i>aside to OSALDI.</i>

<p>Wake not the slumbering tiger in his eye;<br>
'Tis much too calm for safety.

<p>OSALDI, <i>aside to ZENO.</i>

<p>Never fear it.<br>
The man who's touched the goal of his desire<br>
Quits not his hold so easy.

<p>ZENO.

<p>Prince, the lady!

<p>URBINO.

<p>The lady, seigniors!

<p><i>[Enter GINEVRA, attended by BIANCA and other ladies.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI, <i>falling back.</i>

<p>Saints of Heav'n!

<p>LEON.

<p>How now, what moves you so?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>'Tis she, my life's sole love,<br>
The fair sweet woman, who, though seen but once,<br>
Has, like a violet nestling in the shade,<br>
Bloomed in my constant memory. O boon<br>
Unhoped, unlooked for! Gift of gracious Heav'n<br>
Where I expected nought! But thus it is;<br>
We pluck at roses and encounter thorns;<br>
Clutch at life's thorns, and fill our hands with roses.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Seignior Giovanni, in this simple maid<br>
You see my hope, my joy, my wealth, my pride:<br>
The one fair pearl dropped in my bosom's core<br>
By the rude wave that wrecked her gentle mother.<br>
You'll find her pure and, though yet timorous,<br>
As duteous and as tender to your suit<br>
As fits her state of youthful modesty<br>
And years of unstained thought. Daughter, your hand<br>
Unto my lord!

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Madam, my service to you!<br>
In saying more, methinks I should say less;<br>
Before so gracious and so rare a presence<br>
Compliment must e'er stand dumb.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Seignior, I thank you.<br>
However small of wit to twist fair sense<br>
From unaccustomed words, I see in these<br>
Your kindness and your truth.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Thy thanks, sweet lady,<br>
Make music in a bosom heretofore<br>
Unused to so divine a melody.

<p>LEON <i>to BIANCA.</i>

<p>She is a lovesome creature, but her face<br>
Hath hints of sorrow shadowing its bloom,<br>
Strange to behold in one so young and blithesome.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Those who have lost their mothers unbetimes,<br>
Oft show these sad lines in their faces, seignior;<br>
'Tis nature's mark that life's most precious boon<br>
Hath somehow missed them.

<p>LEON.

<p>So, if not
The sign of present grief, I am content.<br>
The count is not a man whose nuptial cup<br>
Should hold one drop of secret bitterness.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Is he so kind?

<p>LEON.

<p>The prince of gentlemen,<br>
Surpassed in mind by few, in worth by none;<br>
In manner only by the blither grace<br>
Of his young brother. Were I lord of realms<br>
To which one well-beloved child were heir,<br>
I 'd ask of Heav'n no nobler husband for her<br>
Than our Giovanni.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>You speak strongly;<br>
May her young graces equal your desire.

<p>GIOVANNI <i>to GINEVRA.</i>

<p>Lady, I would not startle your sweet soul<br>
Into a sudden passion. Not the wind<br>
But the soft sunshine best constrains the bud<br>
To ope its delicate leaves. Of all the words<br>
Of gentle courtesy and deep regard<br>
With which I come full laden to your side,<br>
I will but proffer one. Accept this, dear,<br>
The choicest of my store, the rose of speech,<br>
The sweet, <i>I love you</i>, which has been the gem<br>
Of every language since the first fond hour<br>
That woman's smile became a good man's heaven.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>I am a plain man's daughter and scarce know<br>
What words are meet for him who shows such grace<br>
To one so far unworthy. But this love<br>
Springing so quickly up at duty's call&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>So quickly? Ah, 'tis true you know not yet<br>
Aught of what gives to this betrothal hour<br>
Its true significance. Not at duty's beck,<br>
But in despite of duty, will, and time<br>
Have I your gentle image cherished here<br>
Within my heart of hearts. But, lady, hark!<br>
The sound of music welling through the dance<br>
Dreams in the air like perfume hanging rapt<br>
* Above its bed of bloom. If you will tread<br>
The coming measure, I will ease my soul<br>
Of its one secret.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Ah, and <i>thou</i> hast one.

<p><i>[They pass on. RISIFI and PRINCE advance.</i>

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Look where the count and my young daughter go,<br>
With heads bent low like corn in harvest time.<br>
What say you, Prince, if I read rightly there<br>
This thing to them is aught but business, business.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Seignior, my son is kind. <i>[Draws off with ZENO.</i><br>
Too kind, by Heaven!<br>
I like not yonder romance of soft looks,<br>
Low cooing murmurs and love-sick devotion,<br>
It suits not with our name. I 'd have him wed her,<br>
But love her! 'tis plebeian. Never yet<br>
Hath an Osaldi stooped to love a trades-girl.

<p>ZENO.

<p>Yet is she a rare blossom, noble Prince.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Indeed I hope it. Would you have a man<br>
Stoop to the dust and not pick up a jewel?

<p><i>[They pass on. Enter numerous guests, among them ANTONIO and PAULO</i>]

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>It takes a great heart to forgive, they say;<br>
And why should I hang back? There, man, my hand.

<p>PAULO.

<p>What means the cockatoo? I came not here<br>
To prattle with a fool, but to behold<br>
For once a man of mark. Where is the Prince?

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>May Heav'n ordain he's safer than thy manners,<br>
Or he were lost indeed. Stay, is that he?

<p>PAULO.

<p>Yon prancing, dancing jack-a-napes in yellow?<br>
O certain by the rood, the Prince, indeed,<br>
If not Risifi's tapster.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>Now in good sooth<br>
It is Risifi's tapster. By my soul,<br>
But you have eyes, my Paulo;&mdash;not that mine<br>
Are not right serviceable and trusty servants<br>
Look at them else.

<p>PAGE.

<p>I know he has good eyes, for he has kicked me<br>
And never missed the spot.

<p><i>CONRAD, pointing at CLAUDO.</i>

<p>Stay, here's the Prince!

<p>ANTONIO, <i>advancing.</i>

<p>Good Prince, most noble, great, and generous Prince,<br>
Your servant, Prince!

<p>CLAUDO.

<p>Who is this fool?

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>Fool? fool?

<p>PAULO.

<p>Easy, Antonio, this is Seignior Claudo,<br>
The city goldsmith.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>Then the word is pat.<br>
He a prince, he! A simple scullion boy<br>
Might have known better had he seen thy face,<br>
Good master Claudo.

<p>PAULO.

<p>Hush! the Prince indeed. <i>[Points out BEPPO.</i>

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>What! you poor rail without a gewgaw on him?<br>
You peaked, plain, scrimped man in leaden hose?<br>
If I were born so small I 'd hang myself<br>
But I would get more flesh.

<p><i>[Advances to BEPPO, saluting him profoundly.</i>

<p>My gracious Prince!<br>
Your servant, Prince.<br>
Doth my lord Prince need aught?<br>
Are all his wants considered and supplied?

<p>BEPPO, <i>lending himself to the joke.</i>

<p>How! is this Antonio, my good Antonio,<br>
Chief caterer of Florence and the rightful lord<br>
Of this rare feast?

<p>ANTONIO, <i>bowing still deeper.</i>

<p>My lord, you do me honor. <i>[Aside.]</i><br>
Where are you rascals? They are ever off<br>
When a man gets his due. <i>[Aloud]</i><br>
My lord, your will?<br>
I hope my lord is satisfied with all?

<p>BEPPO.

<p>Um! so, so. You have done fairly if so be<br>
The wine is somewhat sour.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>The wine&mdash;sour? sour?<br>
You surely jest, my lord. The wine? How now,<br>
What mean you, sirrahs, hanging 'bout me thus?
Off to your duties, off!

<p>BEPPO.

<p>The fruits are good,<br>
Though something scarce.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>Good heavens!<br>
<i>[To PAULO and the others.</i><br>
What? about me still?<br>
Have you nought else to do but eye my lord?<br>
Away! the noble Prince and I would converse.

<p>BEPPO.

<p>These hangings, as I take it, were put up<br>
Not at thy own suggestion. They 're too gay<br>
For taste refined as thine.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>True, but Risifi<br>
Is sovereign here. He would have yellow, Prince.<br>
Will you walk on?

<p>PAULO.

<p>Nay, haste him not, Antonio.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>How, Paulo, lingering still? Come, I excuse thee.<br>
This fellow's service, Prince, is so devoted;<br>
Come, come, I have said go. <i>[BEPPO laughs.</i><br>
Whose laugh is that?<br>
Is Beppo here?

<p>PAGE.

<p>I do not see him, seignior.

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>That was his laugh. My gracious Prince, your pardon,<br>
But you were saying&mdash;

<p>BEPPO, <i>laughing again.</i>

<p>Man, don't you know me?

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>Know you? Now by my dudgeon if I live<br>
To doff this doublet I will deal you, sirrah&mdash;

<p>PAULO.

<p>Come, come, the Prince! the Prince!

<p>ANTONIO.

<p>Prince me no more;<br>
I've had enough of princes.

<p><i>[Exeunt. Enter GIOVANNI and GINEVRA.</i>

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>And you remember still?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Ay, lady, still.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>A face just lifted from the circling crowd<br>
And straightway lost again like some white wave<br>
Swallowed by sister billows?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Even so.

<p>GINEVRA, <i>with agitation.</i>

<p>And love me?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Love you? O that words, weak words,<br>
Mere bubbles of the breath tossed out to die<br>
On every wayward breeze that frets the air,<br>
Are all I have to tell you, dear, how much.<br>
Love you? My whole soul floats upon your smile<br>
As on a restless sea. I cannot breathe<br>
My natural breath in your sweet atmosphere<br>
But it does seem to catch a fairy fragrance.<br>
Love you? My wild heart leaps unto my lips;<br>
I love you so I scarce can say I love you.

<p>GINEVRA, <i>shrinking.</i>

<p>O God! and I&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>And you?

<p>GINEVRA, <i>advancing to the casement.</i>

<p>Seignior, look forth!<br>
Dost see yon orb of light that girt with power<br>
Rides the still spaces of the firmament,<br>
Queen-like within her golden chariot?<br>
One might in honor worship such a star<br>
Shining supreme upon the front of night,<br>
Nor bate him much from that high majesty<br>
Of self-respect that makes a man a man.<br>
But what of its reflection in the stream,<br>
That puny brilliance which with borrowed gleam<br>
Stares upward from the hollow of the wave<br>
Soulless and unsubstantial? Lives there one<br>
On all this round of earth could stoop so low<br>
As to do homage there? Yet, gentle seignior,<br>
The ideal you have loved is such a star,<br>
I but the weak reflection.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Say you so?<br>
Then are you heaven's high orb made low and sweet<br>
For earthly service and companionship,<br>
And I the wave which holds your beauty shrined<br>
Deep in its cradling bosom. Ah, Ginevra,<br>
Too young to know that love asks small excuse<br>
Of worthiness for loving, let your smile<br>
But cross betimes my stern and iron path,<br>
And I will ask no other light on earth<br>
To guide my steps aright. For where love shines<br>
Ambition owns no pitfalls, fame no sting,<br>
Nor is it in hard disappointment's power<br>
To quite undo us.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Ah, it is too much!<br>
You love me far too well.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Ay, were my days<br>
Hung upon sport and dalliance; but with war<br>
Sounding his eager clarion in my ear,<br>
His sword within my hand, and on my brow<br>
The shadow of the great <i>to do and be</i><br>
Which runs before high fame, 'tis saving grace<br>
To dote so well and fondly. O sweet angel!<br>
Beacon of light to my long-harassed soul,<br>
What boon hath potent Fortune fair enough<br>
To win thee from me. When a dying wretch<br>
Will yield the cup that bubbles to his lip<br>
After long thirst and anguish, then will I<br>
Yield thee and perish. But you tremble, sweet one,<br>
The envious night wind wooing your fair cheek<br>
Hath chilled your gentle blood. Let us pass on.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>No, no, 'tis nought. I&mdash;<i>[aside]</i><br>
O to hear such words,<br>
And feel them strike my breast like blunted arrows.

<p><i>[They pass on.</i>

<p><i>Enter LEON and BIANCA.</i>

<p>LEON.

<p>He's here. But this same moment I perceived<br>
His form glide through the porch. If as I fear<br>
He comes to mar the feast with jealous rage,<br>
'T were fit some warning of the same were given<br>
Unto my noble lord. Where is he, lady?

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Yonder, with his betrothed. Ah, Seignior Leon,<br>
I fear your words' effect. He loves her truly,<br>
And she&mdash;she might have peace had this young gallant<br>
Kept himself hence awhile.

<p>LEON.

<p>That were to find
Judgment in youth and manhood's sternest virtue<br>
Ruling th' unchastened spirit of a boy.<br>
But to my task. Pray heav'n I quit me of it<br>
With wisdom and discretion. <i>[Exit.</i>

<p>BIANCA.

<p>I will follow;<br>
Perchance my woman's wit may help the cause. <i>[Exit.</i>

<p><i>Enter GIOVANNI and LEON.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>You think I am too happy?

<p>LEON.

<p>Nay, my lord,<br>
I think the maid too fair. A love that hath<br>
No surer basis than a winsome face<br>
Crumbles too oft to ruin.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>So 'tis said;<br>
But, Leon, hast thou loved?

<p>LEON.

<p>Not yet, my lord.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Then listen. They who see her call her fair;<br>
Say her smile pleases; that her voice is soft;<br>
Her cheek the home of blushes, light, and joy;<br>
Her glance a shifting glory; and her brow<br>
The throne of beauty and the seat of truth.<br>
But as for me, I can see nought of this.<br>
I do not know if she be fair or not.<br>
A blind man just restored to light, I ween,<br>
Would scarcely stop in looking at a rose<br>
To say that it was beautiful. I only know<br>
Her glance is revelation, and her smile<br>
A torturing delight. Her slightest move<br>
Wakes rapture in me. When I look at her<br>
I feel in that one instant all the reach<br>
The human soul can scale in depth and height,<br>
In ecstasy and pain; so much I love her.

<p>LEON.

<p>Love? love? my lord has love? he's sure of it?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Sure of my love?

<p>LEON.

<p>Sure of the lady, seignior;<br>
Women are so oft given to fickleness.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Leon, dost see this sword? It was my grandsire's,<br>
And on its very blade grim Honor sits<br>
As on a throne. I 'd rather wipe<br>
Its score of deeds and old-time memories<br>
Off in the base blood of a whining cur,<br>
Than soil my lips with bandying doubts of her<br>
Whom, loving, I would wed.

<p>LEON.

<p>My love for you<br>
Led me too far, my lord. I meant no evil.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>There, I believe it; speak of it no more;<br>
You are my very friend; yet hark you, Leon,<br>
'Tis easier for a man to bear all shame,<br>
Anguish and wrong, than listen to a doubt<br>
Urged 'gainst a well-beloved woman's honor.<br>
Yet are you my own Leon. Friend, your brow<br>
Shows signs of watching. Had you dreams last night?

<p>LEON.

<p>Yes, I had dreams, but ask not what they were<br>
Lest they should anger you. They were of her.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Of her&mdash;Ginevra? You did dream of her<br>
And never tell me, Leon?

<p>LEON.

<p>Good my lord;<br>
It was of this I would have spoke when you&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>No more. Tell me your dream. What was it, Leon?

<p>LEON.

<p>My lord, I dreamed I saw her at the altar,<br>
A glorious, smiling bride.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Yes, yes.

<p>LEON.

<p>I dreamed<br>
She was so beauteous that I stood and gazed<br>
. Long on her speaking face, unknowing why<br>
My heart refused its joy, until I turned<br>
My eyes in following hers upon her bridegroom,<br>
And saw&mdash;well, well, ask me not whom I saw&mdash;<br>
It was not thou. O gentle seignior, pardon.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Pardon for what? For an unhallowed dream,<br>
Born of your restless fear? Good Leon, listen.<br>
It is the fashion of our gallants here<br>
To harp on woman's frailty and fondness;<br>
Until, to hear them talk, one scarce would think<br>
God had reserved himself a single jewel<br>
In his vast treasure-house of womankind,<br>
Untarnished and unflawed. This fashion, Leon,<br>
Hath evil in it past the ill it does<br>
To those we most should honor, for it leaves<br>
A dark spot in the mind where doubt, once gendered,<br>
Wallows for evermore. I'll none of it;<br>
And, therefore, though you dream me dreams of hell,<br>
I'll hold unto my faith in womankind<br>
As I hold on to God. The pure in heart<br>
Have right to trust in others' purity.

<p>LEON, <i>aside</i>.

<p>Ay, ay, 'tis so.<br>
What man will dare to tell him<br>
That he who leans on fair Ginevra's faith<br>
Leans to his fall. Seignior, I say no more.<br>
Before such trust Suspicion hides her face,<br>
Abashed at her own daring. <i>[Going.</i>

<p><i>[Enter BIANCA.</i>

<p>Ah, Bianca,<br>
My words have failed, may yours have better fortune. <i>[Exit.</i>

<p>BIANCA, <i>aside</i>.

<p>My words are tears; what else befits the hour?

<p>GIOVANNI, <i>thoughtfully drawing his sword.</i>

<p>I said it was my grandsire's; I said well;<br>
I saw his cheek flush and the quick thrill run<br>
The length of his man's frame&mdash;such virtue dwells<br>
On the high front of fame to startle men.<br>
Ah, noble sword, what fortune lies before thee<br>
In my untutored hands! Will high Renown<br>
Leap with thy flash as in the days of yore?<br>
And proud-eyed Victory run to kiss thy edge<br>
Before the day be done? We may not know;<br>
We can but hope and trust. <i>[Sees BIANCA.</i><br>
Ah, gracious lady,<br>
Your pardon for my daring! Naked steel<br>
Hath little business here.

<p>BIANCA.

<p>True, true, then sheath it&mdash;<br>
Nay, seal it to thy scabbard. Wrong and loss<br>
Are not to be thus met.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Wrong and loss?

<p><i>Enter at the back CAMILLO and GINEVRA in tender converse.</i>

<p>BIANCA.

<p>Ay, look there, but do not draw your sword;<br>
Let Heav'n avenge thee here. <i>[Exit.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>What do I see?<br>
My brother&mdash;my betrothed&mdash;hand clasped in hand&mdash;<br>
Face turned to face&mdash;his full of grief and worship,<br>
While hers&mdash;[<i>staggering back</i>]<br>
O heav'n! what is this doom I see<br>
Shadowing upon me from the seat of bliss<br>
I reckoned all my own!

<p>GINEVRA <i>to</i> CAMILLO.

<p>No more. Since Fate<br>
Has pledged me to your brother, speech twist us<br>
Is well-nigh treason.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Yet such speech must be.<br>
I am no boy to yield my treasure up<br>
Without an effort to arrest the hand<br>
That seeks to rob me. If Giovanni knew&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI, <i>coming forward.</i>

<p><i>If?</i> Does he not? Can one stand witness here<br>
And <i>not</i> know?

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Count Giovanni! <i>[Turns to fly.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Stay! a word<br>
To make all sure. Brother, is this fair woman,<br>
Whom but a moment since I thought my own,<br>
She whom you told me of a week agone?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>The same, alas!

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Not some fair semblance simply,<br>
Like her in feature, form, or circumstance,<br>
But she, herself, the rich Risifi's daughter?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Ay, brother, she herself.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Oh! they spake well<br>
Who said the brightest moms brought heaviest days.

<p><i>[Turning towards her but not looking at her.</i>

<p>Lady, you know this boy; have seen him oft,<br>
And mind his features well. Is it, then, he<br>
Who holds the star, while I the weak reflection?<br>
If not, speak, speak, and I will risk my all<br>
To make you mine indeed. <i>[A pause.]</i><br>
Ye powers that wait<br>
On mortal souls, gird up my heart to bear<br>
This heavy silence! <i>[Another pause.]</i><br>
What, quite still? No word,<br>
No whisper light as air or dying breath,<br>
To bid Giovanni hope? Ah, well; thus sinks<br>
The ship full freighted in the hollow sea,<br>
Leaving no sign behind!

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Brother?

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Giovanni?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Lady, I ne'er have been a happy man.<br>
Gaunt care and circumstance have warped my life<br>
In youth's first prime. If with the sight of thee<br>
Some wandering beam of hope found passage through<br>
Life's darkness to my heart, 't was God's good gift<br>
Whose loss I'll not bemoan. If ye two love<br>
Ye shall be happy. It is not for me,<br>
A man past youth's first flush, to coldly stand<br>
A shadow on the threshold of your joy.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>And thou?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>And I? <i>[A pause.</i><br>
When in the heat of sounding battle-fields<br>
A soldier stands, black danger in his path,<br>
And in his hand the sword to make that danger<br>
Shrink at his feet appalled, one does not ask<br>
If joy or sorrow nerves the arm that wrests<br>
Proud victory from the foe. It is enough<br>
The heart is steady and the arm is steel;<br>
High fame inquires no more. O thou great Power<br>
That broods above the smoky ranks of war,<br>
To thee henceforth I dedicate my soul!<br>
In thy huge volleyings hear the voice of love,<br>
And from the blaze of thy high beacon fires<br>
Snatch, like Prometheus, the living flame<br>
To feed my soul anew. While Honor calls,<br>
Despair cries out in vain. <i>[Rushes forth.</i>

<p><i>[Enter RISIFI, meeting him.<br>
He is followed by OSA.LDI, ZENO, URBINO, and others.]</i>

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Hold! why this haste?<br>
And yon pert stripling by my daughter's side&mdash;<br>
Who may he be, my lord?

<p>GIOVANNI, <i>returning</i>.

<p>One who now holds<br>
Right prior to me here. My brother, seignior;<br>
The noblest of our race, a youth in whom<br>
All truest virtues live, and furthermore<br>
He whom high Heav'n ordains to wed your daughter.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>He? This slim boy? And you, Giovanni, you,<br>
Who but an hour ago received her hand<br>
From me in fair betrothal?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>I am a soldier;<br>
The sweets of love and fair domestic joys<br>
Are not for me.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>And by what right, my lord,<br>
Do you adjudge them with my daughter here<br>
Unto this stripling, though he be your brother?<br>
Is he by chance, for all his beardless lip,<br>
Elder than you in years?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>No.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Then, by heaven,<br>
I know no law or human or divine<br>
That can ordain him to espouse my child,<br>
Betrothed but now to thee.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Yet is there one.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Ha! would'st <i>thou</i> speak?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>A law which none may break,<br>
In this rough world of few and fleeting joys,<br>
Without such penalty as Nature asks<br>
From those who cross her will&mdash;the law of Love.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Love! 'Tis the prate of fools. I know not love;<br>
Nor does my daughter, hedged about and in<br>
As she hath been from earliest infancy;<br>
Or, if by chance the watchfulness of years<br>
Has been in vain, and by some loop-hole small<br>
The Devil has crept in, what pow'r hath that<br>
To make me yield my will. I 'd have her princess,<br>
And princess shall she be, or die a maid.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>O mad ambition!

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Struggle not with it;<br>
Our doom is fixed, all words will be in vain.

<p>ZENO <i>to GIOVANNI.</i>

<p>You are a prince; take that which is thine own<br>
And cease this foolish strife.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>It may not be.<br>
Seignior Risifi, on thy yea or nay<br>
Rests this young maiden's life. For love is life,<br>
And loss of love is death. Is her sweet being<br>
Less to your fatherhood than hope of rank?<br>
Her happiness and honor, peace and joy,<br>
Smaller than satisfaction of a wish<br>
Never called holy, never born in heaven,<br>
But gendered in the bosom of that angel<br>
Who sold himself for pride? I cannot think it;<br>
The strong surprise of this quick change has turned<br>
Your fatherhood awry. A moment's thought<br>
Will bring its own repentance.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Say you so?<br>
Then know you not Risifi. Sooner far<br>
The sun shall turn its back upon the east<br>
And trample out its own refulgent steps<br>
Than I yield up my purpose. But enough!<br>
If one short hour has wearied your young blood<br>
Of charms once thought so bounteous and rare,<br>
Leave her and go thy way; I urge no man<br>
Against his will; but talk not to my age<br>
Of what its duties are, nor in the shame<br>
Of your own treason, fetch this stripling here<br>
To gloss o'er your default.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Seignior, my griefs<br>
Needed no added sting. If she were free,<br>
Naught that the world affords of pomp or power<br>
Could win her from my arms. But she's not free,<br>
And I who hold that honor's springs lie deep<br>
Beneath all selfish yearning, yield her up<br>
To joys more truly hers.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>'Tis well; the son<br>
Of Uzzi's lord will thank you.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Uzzi?

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Ay,<br>
Dids't think such charms as hers had tipped the scale<br>
Against your pride alone?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>But Uzzi, seignior?<br>
It is a villain brood.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>It is a lord's.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>O this is horrible!

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Most horrible.<br>
Can'st look upon this sacrifice, Giovanni?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>I?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>She is young; her years lie long before her;<br>
Save her from this hard fate and take my thanks.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>What, would you tempt me with that thought again?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>'Tis no temptation, 'tis thy rightful due.<br>
Whate'er may chance, I ne'er may hope to wed her,<br>
Then why not thou?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>True, true, then why not I?

<p>URBINO <i>to RISIFI</i>.

<p>He yields, Risifi; urge him but a jot<br>
And all is yours again.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>I urge no man<br>
Against his pleasure. If my daughter's charms<br>
Lack power to hold him to his plighted vow,<br>
Shall words of mine prevail?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>O God! 'tis hard.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>And is that all, my lord?

<p>GIOVANNI, <i>with efort.</i>

<p>All, all, alas!

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Then are we quits. Urbino, to the doors!<br>
Let our guests know that in a fortnight hence<br>
We celebrate our union with Count Uzzi.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>O no, no, no, that were to die indeed!

<p><i>[Falls at Giov ANNI's feet</i>

<p>Save me, Giovanni, save me from a fate<br>
Too dreadful for my strength.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>What! do <i>you</i> plead?<br>
O heaven, this is too much! Rise, lady, rise,<br>
I may not see thee thus.

<p>GINEVRA.

<p>Nor may I rise<br>
Until you grant my suit.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>And what is that?

<p>GINEVRA, <i>timidly.</i>

<p>Most graciously to wed me, seignior.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Wed thee?<br>
O God! O God! And could'st thou wed me, lady,<br>
Be my pledged wife and not behold in dreams<br>
The younger, brighter, dearer face of him<br>
Who stands there in despair? Look at him, lady,<br>
Mark well his face, his beauty, and his love,<br>
And tell me, by the heavens which bend above us,<br>
Could you do this?

<p>GINEVRA, <i>wildly.</i>

<p>I know not; ask me not.<br>
My thoughts are all in tumult.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p><i>Thou could'st not;</i><br>
I see it in thy fond and failing eye<br>
Which droops before his gaze. Would'st have me wed<br>
The lover of another? Friends, farewell;<br>
I have no other business in this place. <i>[Going.</i>

<p>RISIFI.

<p>And now to fresh betrothals! Sound the lute<br>
And let the dance whirl on.

<p><i>[Trumpet heard without.</i>

<p>Ha! what is that?

<p><i>[Enter Messenger.</i>

<p>MESSENGER.

<p>A summons from the Duke to Count Giovanni,<br>
Captain by right of birth and monies promised<br>
Unto the cause of war.

<p><i>[GIOVANNI advances, takes the paper ofered,is about to open it,<br>
but suddenly stops, looks at RISIFI, and drops it.]</i>

<p>RISIFI.

<p>By monies promised!<br>
My lord, have you such monies?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>No, seignior, no.<br>
I had forgot to whom I was beholden<br>
For ev'n the chance to die.

<p>RISIFI, <i>pointing to the packet.</i>

<p>Then let it lie<br>
Till Uzzi comes to lift it.

<p><i>[GIOVANNI starts forward, but instantly recovers himself]</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Nay, 'tis true.<br>
My captaincy is gone with this child's love,&mdash;<br>
All, all in one quick breath.

<p>ZENO.

<p>Nor that alone;<br>
Thy house, thy father, thy young brother too,<br>
Sink in the ruin with thee.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Ah, 'tis so, 'tis so,<br>
Our house is fallen! All my hopes but served<br>
To lift its misery plainer into view<br>
For all men's mockery.

<p>ZENO.

<p>Draw thy sword, Giovanni,&mdash;<br>
Thy grandsire's sword that was to carve our way<br>
To reinstatement. Can'st thou look on it<br>
And not recall the hopes its mem'ries gave,<br>
The day you drew it first?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Zeno, no more.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>And this dear maiden whom you love so well.<br>
Look at her, brother; can you see such beauty<br>
Flung to an Uzzi's keeping?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Cease, O cease!<br>
Man's heart can bear no more. Whate'er betides,<br>
Uzzi stays hence. Forth to the courier, man;<br>
Bid him acquaint the Duke that e'er to-morrow<br>
His captain will be there.

<p>ZENO.

<p>I live again.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>And I, who thought to leave my aged bones<br>
Upon this hostile floor.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>And thou, Camillo?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>My highest love cries <i>Ay</i>, howe'er my heart<br>
Bleeds at its heavy loss.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Brother, I love thee.<br>
Remember this when from the field of war<br>
Ginevra's bridegroom brings the bays of fame<br>
To crown his wreath of love.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>I will remember.

<p><i>[GIOVANNI turns to depart.</i>

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Whither would'st go, my lord?

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>To seek a priest<br>
Who'll bind this knot at once.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>I'll seek him, seignior;<br>
Thy place is at her side. <i>[Exit.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI <i>to GINEVRA.</i>

<p>Sweet, may I take it? <i>[She gives him her hand.</i>

<p>Thanks, dearest lady; may the happy man<br>
Who calls thee wife love thee but half as well<br>
As he you honor thus. Father, your blessing.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>You have it, son, poured out as full and free<br>
As though you were the only hope I had.<br>
And this thy top-most hour.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Brother&mdash;but no!<br>
Confession must be made ere marriage vows,<br>
And lo! here comes the priest.

<p><i>[Enter RISIFI with a priest.</i>

<p>Ah! holy father,<br>
Wilt shrive me ere you wed me?

<p>PRIEST.

<p>Gladly, son.

<p><i>[GIOVANNI, lifting the curtain from before a small closet.]</i>

<p>In, then, and may high Heav'n rain dews of joy<br>
Upon the hearts I leave here.

<p><i>[Exit slowly, looking at GINEVRA</i>

<p>LEON.

<p>What means this shudder?<br>
I feel as though mine eyes had seen his ghost.

<p>ZENO.

<p>And I; yet all is well. 'Tis but his grief<br>
At robbing his young brother of the love<br>
So suited to his years.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>O Zeno, Zeno!<br>
How like his mother did he look but now.<br>
Should there be aught amiss!

<p>RISIFI, <i>aside</i>.

<p>I wished it, yet<br>
My blood runs cold within me.

<p>GINEVRA <i>to BIANCA.</i>

<p>Were it wrong<br>
To cast one farewell glance at him I loved<br>
Before this duty claimed me?

<p>BIANCA.

<p>It were not wise<br>
But&mdash;. <i>[A cry within.]</i>

<p>What is that?

<p><i>[Enter the priest hurriedly.</i>

<p>PRIEST.

<p>Death! death! The noble count<br>
Hath turned his sword against his own brave heart,<br>
And all is over.

<p>OSALDI.

<p>O my mastering fears!

<p><i>LEON, rushing and dragging aside the curtain from before the closet.</i>

<p>My lord?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>Giovanni?

<p>OSALDI.

<p>Ah, my son, my son!

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Hush, it is done. My sword has cut the knot<br>
That baffled all our skill. Camillo, brother,<br>
You love this gentle child?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>I! O thou know'st.

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>Then take her nand in thine. I 'm dying, brother,<br>
And you are now the heir. But these have said<br>
Osaldi's heir should wed Risifi's daughter;<br>
Dost comprehend me now?

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>O brother! brother!

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>No words,&mdash;your hands&mdash;thine, lady,&mdash;thine, Camillo&mdash;<br>
What, have I lost my sense? I do not feel<br>
The touch of thine, Camillo.

<p>CAMILLO.

<p>'Tis too awful.<br>
Perhaps some future day&mdash;

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>No, now.

<p>RISIFI.

<p>Give him thy hand.<br>
Would'st kill him twice and make the girl a widow<br>
Before her sixteenth year?

<p><i>[CAMILLO gives his hand.</i>

<p>GIOVANNI.

<p>So, you will love each other.<br>
Friends, lift me up. A light, there on her face!<br>
I'd see her once again. So, so. <i>[Sinks back.</i>

<p>LEON.

<p>O live, Giovanni!

<p>GIOVANNI, <i>starting to his feet and standing.</i>

<p>No, die! <i>[Falls back dead.</i>
