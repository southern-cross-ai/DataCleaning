<h3>PUBLISHER'S NOTE to the 1954 edition</h3>

<p>The contents of this volume have been gathered from three
collections of Runyon material originally published in 1947, 1948
and 1950 (and for the most part now out of print) with, in
addition, a novelette and five stories never before published in
book form in Great Britain. The collections &mdash; <i>Runyon a la
Carte, Short Takes</i> and <i>All This and That</i> &mdash; were
not exclusively collections of <i>stories</i>; and in order to
create a second omnibus volume of Runyon fiction to range with the
first omnibus <i>Runyon on Broadway</i>, we have arranged in more
of less chronological sequence all the stories not contained in
<i>Runyon on Broadway</i>.</p>

<p>Herein will be found the first stories Runyon ever wrote; also
the last; also an intermediate series of miscellaneous tales headed
by the short novel <i>Money from Home</i>. As a postscript is
reproduced a group of eight short sketches written during Runyon's
final and grievous illness, which will surely survive among records
of human courage in the very shadow of death.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DEFENCE_OF_STRIKERVILLE" id=
"THE_DEFENCE_OF_STRIKERVILLE">1. THE DEFENCE OF STRIKERVILLE</a>
</h2>

<p>THE squad-room conversation had drifted to the state militia,
and everyone had taken a verbal poke at that despised arm of the
military resources.</p>

<p>"Onct I belonged to the milish," remarked Private Hanks, curled
up luxuriously on his cot and sending long, spiral wreaths of smoke
ceiling-ward.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," said Sergeant Cameron. "I recall the
time you first took on &mdash; Plattsburg, '97, wasn't it? I had an
idea then that you came from the state gravel wallopers."</p>

<p>"I'm kiddin' on the square," said Hanks. "I was an out-and-out
snoljer with the milish two years ago out in Colorado. I helped put
down the turrible rebellion in the Coal Creek district."</p>

<p>This statement was received with obvious disbelief.</p>

<p>"Lemme tell you about that," said Private Hanks, sitting up.
"Lemme relate the sad circumstances of J. Wallace Hanks' enlistment
in the Colorado State milish, and if you all don't weep, you
haven't got no hearts.</p>

<p>"They was a bunch of us discharged from the Fifth, in Denver, in
1904. We all has a good gob of finals, and of course none of us
were going back. You all know how that is," and Private Hanks
looked suggestively at Private William Casey, who had just
re-enlisted that day for his fifth "hitch", after a fervid
declaration of a week before that he was through with the service
for ever; Private Casey at that moment being seated disconsolately
upon his cot, red-eyed and dispirited.</p>

<p>"It takes me about a week to get ready to back up into the
railroad building to hold up my right hand and promise Recruitin'
Sergeant Wilson and Uncle Sam to love, honour, and obey, or words
to that effect. The rest of the gang was no better off. They was
scattered up and down Larimer Street, stallin' for biscuits, and
doing the reliever act with them nice new citizens they'd bought in
the flush of their prosperity.</p>

<p>"We all see another three year trick sticking up as conspicuous
as a Chinaman in church, but none of us is dead anxious to go back
so soon. We don't want the gang out at the fort to give us the big
tee-hee after all them solemn swears and rosy air-castles we'd
regaled them with when we departed. We'd like to lay off awhile
until the novelty of our return wouldn't be so strikin'.</p>

<p>"Most of us is too sick to even think of looking for work. We'd
maced about everyone we could think of, from Highlands to the fort,
and we're done, that's all. We're about twenty-five strong, take us
altogether, and there wasn't forty cents. Mex in the layout. Things
is certainly looking fierce, and we're all standing around on the
corner waiting for the first guy to say the word for a break to the
railroad building.</p>

<p>"I happens to pike at one of the signs in front of an employment
office to see if someone ain't looking for a private secretary or a
good manager, and it reads like this:</p>

<p>"'WANTED! &mdash; Able-bodied men for the State militia of
Colorado. $2 a day and found.'</p>

<p>"I leaves the rest of these sad-eyed dubs standing around where
they are and stalls up into this employment office.</p>

<p>"There's a plug sitting behind the desk looking as chest as a
travelling man, and I nails him.</p>

<p>"'What's this gig about militia?' I asks him.</p>

<p>"'Strike-soldiers wanted-two dollars a day and found,' he says,
short-like.</p>

<p>"'Well, that's where I live,' I tells him. 'I'm the original
soldier; all others are infringements.'</p>

<p>"'You gimme two bucks,' he says, 'and I ships you for a
soldier.'</p>

<p>"'Say, mister,' I asks him, 'if I had two bucks, what d'you
reckon I'd want to soldier for?'</p>

<p>"'That's my bit,' he says. 'If you ain't got it, of course I
can't get it. The noble State of Colorado, she pays me just the
same, but when I can get it out of rummies like you, I ketches 'em
coming and going. See?'</p>

<p>"I did, all right, and it looks to me like it was pretty fair
graft. This guy explains the milishy business to me. There's a big
strike on in the Coal Creek district. The milishy is out, but there
ain't enough men, so they gives this employment guinea orders to
pick up all he can. He's just the same as a recruitin' sergeant,
only different.</p>

<p>"I tells him about the rest of the bunch, and he agrees to take
'em all. Then I went back and told the gang, and you'd oughta hear
the holler they sent up. Milishy! Nix! Not for them! They'd starve
first, and a lot more dope like that.</p>

<p>"'Come out o' it!' I tells them. 'Here's a gee hungerin' to slip
us two bucks a day and all found, and you hams standing around with
wrinkles in your bellies, side-stepping like a bunch of mules in
the road. He takes this on while it lasts and gets a stake. The
State's good for the money, or ought to be. Come along, children,
before the boogie man sloughs you in the skookum for mopery!'</p>

<p>"Course they comes! Why, this is duck soup for us all. Think of
two cases a shift for snoljering! We're there stronger than
father's socks when we lines up in that employment office.</p>

<p>"The gee I talks to sends for an officer from this milish, and
he takes charge of us. He ain't a bad feller, only he's a kid and
don't sabe the war business much. He asked me if I'd ever seen
service, and when I flashes about half a dozen parchments on him,
he liked to had a fit. At that, he's a nice little feller and don't
mean no harm. Some of the guys were trying to kid him, but I made
'em cut it out.</p>

<p>"This officer shoos us down to the depot and loads us up on a
train for Coal Creek. He asks us what we wanted to join, and of
course we're all out for the cavalry. It seems that was just what
he wanted. They had a troop up there that was away shy of men, and
a bunch that can ride fits in mighty nice. And so a slice of the
first squadron of the Fifth goes into the milishy business.</p>

<p>"I'd hustled the bunch right through the preliminaries, and they
don't get much chanst to ponder over it until they was on the
train. And then they was sore at themselves and also me. They
breaks up into little squads in the smoker and sits looking
gloomy-like out the window. Every onct in a while some guy would
sigh and say:</p>

<p>"'S'posin' ole Bluch would see us now!' meaning Cap. Bluch
Baker.</p>

<p>"This kid officer was mighty nice on the train, but he he finds
everyone but me mighty unconversational. We pulls into Coal Creek
late that night, and then he suddenly gets all-fired
peremptory.</p>

<p>"'Get out and line up on the platform!' he bawls at us, and,
seeing we're there, we do it.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of guys in uniform standing around and looking us
over some curious, but we're pretty tired and don't mind. This kid
officer gives us right forward, and we climbs hills for the next
hour or so until we comes to a bunch of Sibley tents, and a rooky
challenges us.</p>

<p>"'Halt!' he says. 'Who is it?'</p>

<p>"What d'you think o' that? 'Who is it!' But that's what he says,
all right.</p>

<p>"The kid officer tells him it's Lieutenant Somebody with a
detachment, and the rook yells for the officer of the day. We're
finally passed, although all hands looked at us some suspicious,
and I don't blame them. Another big gang is standing around
rubbering at us as we drills into camp, and they makes a lot of
fresh remarks. I'm pretty glad my bunch is tired, or there'd been
remains to clean up. We're assigned to tents, and a sergeant comes
along and gives us a couple of skinny blankets apiece. The tent has
floors, so bunking ain't so bad as it might be, although it was
colder'n a banker's heart.</p>

<p>"A kid making a stab at reveille on a trumpet gets us out in the
morning, and this same sergeant of blanket fame issues us
mess-kits. It had snowed a few feet during the night, and we're
none too cheerful when we lines up at the mess-shack for breakfast.
We didn't have no roll-call, because we hadn't give in our names.
The camp is laid out pretty well, as we see it by daylight. The
company streets were laid out in rows on a hillside, and there was
a big stable for the cavalry horses at the bottom of the hill. We
weighs up our comrades in arms as we sees them at the mess-shack,
and they're mostly kids. A few gees with very suggestive-looking
shoulders and shame-faced expressions is scattered among them.</p>

<p>"The breakfast ain't so bad, what there is of it, but I could
tell by the wise look on the mugs of some of the gang that came
with me that there'd likely be a minus in the ranks before
long.</p>

<p>"Later in the morning, the captain of the troop lines us up
again, swears us in, and takes our pedigrees. I listened mighty
intent, but I failed to hear anyone kick in with their right name
excepting me, and I had to do it because that kid officer had seen
my discharge. Then they issues us clothes.</p>

<p>"Say, you orderly-bucking stiffs, I wisht you could see them
clothes right now! Most of them was second-hand, and I take it that
our predecessors in that troops had put in their time in civil life
serving as models for ready-made cigarettes. I never heard such a
holler as went up from my gang since the canteen was abolished.
They cussed the state milishy, the State of Colorado, the governor,
and all his hired hands, and they wound up by cussing me for
getting them into it. They was the worst-looking lot of rookies I
ever saw in my life, and they was all the madder because I drew a
pretty fair outfit myself.</p>

<p>"After clothes, we were sent down to the stables to draw our
mounts. I have mentioned that those clothes caused pretty much of a
holler, but it was simply a soft guffaw to the muffled roar that
the gang let out when they saw them gallant steeds. I think the
State of Colorado robbed the hack horse market of Denver when they
sent out the milish, and they copped the whole crop of the previous
generation of horses at that.</p>

<p>"Skates? Say, they wasn't horses. They were hat-racks! They were
shadows of horses &mdash; visions &mdash; dreams!</p>

<p>"The bunch was sore at first, but the funny side finally struck
them, and they commenced picking out the worst mutts they could.
There wasn't much choice, but the lay-out my delegation drew was
certainly a fright. They had all kinds of fun kidding with them
horses and with the rest of the troop. They'd put their saddles on
wrong side before, and all such foolishness, to make the troops
think they was awful rookies.</p>

<p>"But if the clothes and other things were jokes, that soldiering
wasn't. Nix! No play about that. I've monkeyed around in the war
business a few days myself, and I never struck anything any harder
than playing soldier in Colorado. You works right straight through
from reveille to taps. Post duty around camp; patrol mounted, and
guard down in them mines where they'd drop you in a cage so fast
you had to hang on to your hat with both hands to keep your hair
from flying off. When you got down a mile or two, they'd throw you
off with your little gun and tell you to stick there and shoot
anyone that batted an eye. Fine business, that!</p>

<p>"It seems that my bunch was about half of this cavalry troop we
belonged to. In addition there was a whole regiment of foot-shakers
in camp, a battery with one of them old-time Napoleon fieldpieces
and a Gat, and another big troop of cavalry. They called this last
lay-out the Denver Light Horse, and it was a bunch of swells. Most
of them looked to me like they might be calico rippers in civil
life, but they sure laid it on there. They had good horses, and
their uniforms fitted them. We looked like a bunch of volunteers
fresh from the States, lined up alongside of them.</p>

<p>"The clothes and horses let 'em out. They weren't there with
anything else, and most of them had something to say about running
the troop. I give it to the guy that had command of us. He was a
captain named Pard, and I finds out afterwards that he was a boss
machinist or a boiler-maker in Denver when he wasn't working at
this tin snoljering business. He was a silent sort of plug, but he
was strong on the tactics. He knew what ought to be done, anyway,
and when he told you to do anything, you had a hunch he meant what
he said.</p>

<p>"This Light Horse outfit weren't for us a-tall. The second night
we were in camp, a large delegation comes yelling down to our
streets, and when we looks out to see what the trouble was, we
finds they had come to toss us in blankets. Get that? Toss them old
heads from the Fifth in blankets!</p>

<p>"They didn't toss. Not any to speak of. We turned over four
tents coming from under them, and when the hospital corps arrived,
there was ghastly bleeding remains scattered about. Naturally, we
didn't get popular with the Light Horse.</p>

<p>"This Captain Pard was wise to us in no time. He got hep that he
had a crowd of the real things under him, and he didn't try any
foolishness with us. The rest of the camp had to drill every day.
He gave it to us just once. Then he sorter grinned, said something
about us appearing to be pretty well instructed already, and that's
the last drill we had. He had to take us out every day for a stall,
but we put in our time laying around smoking cigarettes in some
shaft house.</p>

<p>"Them strikers we were hired to suppress were already pretty
much suppressed, as we found it. They was mighty sore at the
milishy, and I don't blame 'em, but our fellers got acquainted with
a lot of 'em and found 'em pretty decent at that. There's about
'steen little towns in this Coal Creek district, from one to six
miles apart, and our troop did patrol duty on the roads between
'em. The strikers were peaceable enough, although they didn't have
no use for scabs. They never started anything with us, so we let
'em alone.</p>

<p>"They was especially sore at this Light Horse outfit. Them guys
would go tearing through the streets on their horses, paying mighty
little attention to life or limb, and they cut up rough with the
strikers whenever they got a chanst. They had a big place downtown
called a bull-pen, and these Light Horse snoljers were
everlastingly throwing someone in the pen, and it made the strikers
pretty hot.</p>

<p>"When they finds out we're 'tending strictly to our own business
and not minding theirs, the strikers got sorter friendly with us
and told us their grievances.</p>

<p>"The mining companies owned the houses where the strikers lived
and when the strike comes on they just naturally throws them
strikers out of house and home. So the strikers go to living in
tents in regular camps and making out the best way they could. The
biggest camp was located about two miles out of town and was on our
patrol. We had to stop there every night to see if things was
quiet, and it wasn't long before our gang was mighty friendly with
them strikers. The women in the camp always had hot coffee for us,
and generally a bite, and we got to thinking quite a few of
them.</p>

<p>"This camp I'm telling you about is on a hill, and there's only
one road to it that's anywhere near decent for travelling. We calls
the camp Strikerville.</p>

<p>"We'd been doing this play soldier act for about three weeks and
was just sighting for a pay-day to blow, when a striker comes to us
one day and tells us that the companies is going to give them the
run from where they are camped. He says he has it pretty straight
that the deputies will do the job and that this Light Horse outfit
is in on the play. The deputies and the milishy are to raid the
camp at night and start a row; then the next day the milishy will
run the strikers off altogether, on the ground that they are a
menace to public peace.</p>

<p>"It seems, according to what this guy tells us, that if the
strikers could be chased clean out of the district, scabs could be
gotten without any trouble, and the mines put to work again. He
says the milishy's part in the deal ain't to be recognized at
headquarters, but the snoljers are to go along with the deputies
like they was doing it of their own accord; same as the time a
bunch of deputies and soldiers wrecked a union newspaper office
over at Cadence. The headquarters hollers afterwards about
'disorganized mob,' and making a rigid investigation to discover
the guilty parties, but it was always noticed that the guilty
parties was never caught, and the office stayed wrecked.</p>

<p>"Well, this feller tells us that the gang was going to pull down
the tents and wreck the whole camp. He was mostly worried about
what it might do to the women and children, because there was a lot
of 'em in the camp, and it was colder'n blazes, with two or three
feet of snow on the ground.</p>

<p>"'A girl baby was born to Mrs. McCafferty just to-day,' he says,
'and it will go kinder rough with her and the kid.'</p>

<p>"'Why don't you put up a fight?' asks 'Dirty Dick' Carson.</p>

<p>"'Fight? What with?' the feller asks. 'They took up every gun in
the district when martial law was declared. If we could only put up
one scrap, it would put a stop to this thing of sending these
disorganized mobs, as they call 'em, around doing the dirty
work.'</p>

<p>"'I got a scheme,' says Dick to me, after the feller left, and
he outlines it with much joy. It made a big hit with me right off
the reel, and in stables that evening C Troop, as represented by
the former members of the Fifth Cavalry, has a quiet meeting, and
Dick and me talks to 'em long and earnest. When we gets through, we
had a hard time keeping them from yelling their heads off just to
show how pleased they are.</p>

<p>"'It's all for that McCafferty kid,' I tells 'em. 'Think how
you'd like it if you was just born and got throwed out of house and
home into the snow. Also think of Mrs. McCafferty's coffee.'</p>

<p>"The bunch got so excited with sympathy, I was afraid they would
tip it off to the rest of the camp. To carry out our scheme, we had
to heave the first sergeant of the troop in. He made up the night
patrols and assigned the other sergeants to command. Dick and me
went to him and has him down to our tent where half a dozen of the
old heads is gathered. It just happens that this top sergeant was a
guy thought had been with the volunteers in the Philippines, and he
thought he was an old soldier. Along with it, he was pretty decent,
and when he hears our scheme he kind o' grins and falls for it
right away.</p>

<p>"There were two patrols made up of about ten men, each under a
sergeant, and they worked from dark until early morning riding the
roads. At roll-call that evening the top reads off the names of the
men on patrol, and although everyone of my bunch had been on duty
the night before, our names is included in the list. In addition to
that, he increases each patrol to eleven men, so as to take in all
us fellers, and he says:</p>

<p>"'There's going to be non-commissioned officers' school this
evening, and I want all my regular non-coms there. I'll appoint
Private Hanks to command Patrol No. 1, and Private Carson to
command Patrol No. 2. They'll report to me for instructions.'</p>

<p>"That looked regular enough. The rest of the troop was tickled
to death, because they thought the top was throwing it into our
gang for double duty. It had commenced to snow again heavy, and no
one wanted to ride roads that night.</p>

<p>"'Serves them old stiffs right; they think they know so much,' I
heard one of the rooky kids say, as we scattered for our tents.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, I sends one of our fellers through the lines
just as soon as we was saddled and ready to start out, with orders
to ride to the strikers' camp and put them next. Then Carson and me
went to the top for orders.</p>

<p>"I've always had a hunch that when we was talking to him in
front of his tent, I saw a pair of eyes gaping through the flap,
and that them eyes looked mighty like Captain Pard's, but I
couldn't prove it if I had to.</p>

<p>"'Don't let anyone get hurt now,' was what the top had to say,
and we falls in our details and rides out of camp.</p>

<p>"As I'm going past No. 1, the sentry hollers at me:</p>

<p>"'More H Troop?' H Troop being the Light Horse.</p>

<p>"'Nope! Cavalry patrols; C Troop,' I told him.</p>

<p>"'I didn't know; most of H Troop seems to be out on mounted pass
to-night,' he says, and a sort o' chuckle runs through our
bunch.</p>

<p>"It had started in to snow like the dickens, and you could
hardly see your file leader. We were all pretty well bundled up, so
we didn't mind. The patrols were supposed to take different roads
about a mile from camp, but we all headed straight out towards
Strikerville. I sent out a couple of scouts to Handley, where the
deputies hung out, and told them to hurry up and bring back a
report.</p>

<p>"When we climb the road to the strikers' camp, and you had to do
it pretty slow on account of the rocks and not being able to see
very well through the snow, we finds a big stir going on. There's a
light in every tent, and camp-fires are burning all around. The
women and kids are huddled over the fires, and the men are
scattered about in little bunches, all talking at once.</p>

<p>"This guy I sent ahead had scared the life out of them. The
president and half a dozen other leaders of the union who lived in
camp met us, and I made 'em get busy right away.</p>

<p>"As I tells you, this camp is on a sort of flat plateau on top
of a hill, and there is only one road to it. I made them put the
women and kids in the tents furtherest away from the head of the
road, leaving the lights and fires burning only where they could be
seen from the bottom of the road. Then I gets every man jack and
every kid of any size in the camp rolling snowballs. It was a wet,
mushy snow and packed fine.</p>

<p>"'Put in a few rocks, if you want to,' I suggests, and I guess
they did.</p>

<p>"I posts one of the men at the bottom of the hill, and I puts
the rest of them to work throwing up breastworks across the top of
the road, to avoid accidents. There was a lot of loose rocks laying
around, and a fine trench is up in no time.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon my scouts from Handley comes in, their horses dead
beat.</p>

<p>"'There's about twenty deputies and twenty-five of them H Troop
guys over in Niccoli's saloon,' they tells me. 'They're getting
pretty drunk, and someone's liable to get hurt. They won't start
until about midnight, and then they're coming a-hellin'.'</p>

<p>"'Any non-coms with the troop?' I asks, and they says 'No.' None
of them had their carbines, either; nothing but six-pistols. That
was to divert any idea that they was out on anything but mounted
pass and a hunt for joy.</p>

<p>"'Them deputies are making a fierce talk about tar and
feathering some of your guys,' one of my scouts tells them labour
leaders, and it didn't quiet the agitation which was stirring them
none.</p>

<p>"I had the snowballs stacked along the front of the trench as
fast as they was made, and it wasn't long before there was enough
to fill an ore waggon. I kept everyone hard at work just the same,
because I didn't want to run shy.</p>

<p>"All we could do was to wait and watch, and it was pretty cold
work. The snow stopped along about midnight, but it stayed pretty
dark. My fellows loafed around, smoking and talking and visiting
the McCafferty kid. None of the women folks went to bed, although
they had no notion of what was coming off.</p>

<p>"It must have been about one o'clock when I hears, away off, the
pound of horses' feet on the snow and a jumbled lot of talking and
laughing. I hustles my men together and lines 'em up back of the
breastworks where them strikers are still rolling snowballs like
mad &mdash; good hard ones, too. I had ten of the fellers load the
carbine magazines, and the rest I bunched with all them strikers,
carefully instructed.</p>

<p>"Pretty quick, my outpost comes running up the hill.</p>

<p>"'They're stopped down below,' he says. 'They're going to come
with a rush to surprise the camp. All of 'em are half-stewed.'</p>

<p>"I looked over my arrangements with a critical eye and didn't
see anything lacking. My friends was lined up back of the
breastworks, them with the carbines in the middle, and the strikers
and the rest of my bunch on either side with arms full of big
snowballs. We could look right down on the roadway, shining like a
streak of whitewash across the coal pile. Back of us a few dying
camp-fires were sputtering, and lights burned in a few tents. It
was as quiet as a graveyard. Then a sudden yell splits the air, and
here they comes!</p>

<p>"They was all mounted, and they was trying to run their horses
up that steep, slippery road, yelling like crazy people. Some of
them starts shooting in the air. They was riding without any kind
of formation, and you couldn't tell soldiers from deputies.</p>

<p>"I waits until they are right below us in the road, and then I
fires a shot from my carbine and hollers, 'Halt!'</p>

<p>"They stopped right in the middle of a yell for about a minute,
but it was long enough. It brings 'em to a stop just below us, and
I screeches:</p>

<p>"'Ready! Aim! Fire!'</p>

<p>"My carbine gang tears off a volley, and the rest of the gang
behind the breastworks launches about a barrel of snowballs on top
of the bench in the road.</p>

<p>"'Fire at will!' I commands, and they does; the fellers with the
carbines shooting at the nearest fixed stars, and the others
whaling away with the snowballs.</p>

<p>"Say! I've seen crowds suddenly jimmed up in my time; like the
old Thirteenth on the Warren the time of the fight, or the gang at
Zapote bridge the night the head of Carabao charged us, but that
delegation in the road skinned 'em all a Salt Lake City block.</p>

<p>"They was just naturally stood on their heads. They yelled in
dead earnest, but they didn't do no shooting; they didn't have
time. I hadn't thought about there being any danger until I see
that bunch milling around in the road; the horses rearing and
snorting and kicking, and everyone trying to go in the same
direction at once. I was leary someone was going to get killed. If
any one of 'em had gone down in that muddle, it would have been all
day with 'em. The language them men used wasn't scarcely fit to
eat.</p>

<p>"All the time my crowd was slamming big snowballs down on the
heads of the enemy and firing carbines, and some of the yells that
rose out of the cloud of snow in the road sounded real painful. The
firing squad was working them carbines overtime between laughs.</p>

<p>"The women and kids in the camps came running up to the
breastworks to see what was going on, and they gets next to the
game right away and commences to fire snowballs too, screaming and
laughing.</p>

<p>"At what I judges is the psychological moment, I hollers:
"'Charge!'</p>

<p>"Then all of us sets up an awful yell and loads and fires
snowballs faster than ever.</p>

<p>"Them in the roadway that had their horses turned right didn't
hesitate. They went down that road with a disregard for their necks
that made me nervous. Them that couldn't get their horses turned
right slipped off and went on foot. Pretty soon all you could hear
was echoes dying away in the distance and the screaming and
laughing in the camp.</p>

<p>"We didn't wait for them strikers' thanks. We got our horses and
got out of there almost as fast as the enemy. I separated the
patrols and sent one out one way and took the other direction with
my squad. We rode off a couple of miles and then went racing back.
We got back to the foot of the hill considerably blown, right after
old Major Kelley, Captain Pard, all the headquarters' officers, and
some of H Troop came tearing along. Back of them Carson and the
other patrol was whooping it up along the road, and away back a
company of infantry and a Gatling squad was kicking up the snow as
fast as they could.</p>

<p>"They had heard the shooting at headquarters, and an H trooper
had buzzed into camp with an exciting tale about the strikers'
massacring harmless soldiers and deputies.</p>

<p>"Now, of course, they knew something about this frame-up to
attack the strikers' camp at headquarters but they hadn't figured
on it turning out but one way. Only that lone H trooper had
returned, and the major seemed to sort o' expect to find many gory
bodies scattered around.</p>

<p>"I reported having heard some firing, but no signs of
excitement. The whole works climbed to the strikers' camp, many
hunching up as close to the major as possible. I saw Captain Pard
occasionally glancing at me with a funny look, as he took in that
mussed-up roadway; but the major didn't seem to notice anything.
The camp was as dark as bats, but in answer to our yells some of
the strikers came out looking mighty cross and sleepy. No, they
hadn't heard anything. No fighting; hadn't heard any disturbance,
and it was getting colder all the time, and the major was sleepy
himself, it ended in him telling Captain Pard to instruct his
patrols to make a thorough investigation. Then they all went back
to headquarters.</p>

<p>"On the roads, before daylight, our patrols picked up fifteen H
troopers, most of them bunged up about the head or face where them
rock-loaded snowballs had landed, and we turned everyone over to
the guardhouse for overstaying pass limits. Sore! Oh, no! That's a
mistake! I think they had commenced to tumble, because our fellers
kidded 'em a good deal.</p>

<p>"When I was turning in that morning, an orderly comes to me and
said the major wanted to see me at the officers' mess. I was scared
stiff for a minute, thinking the old man was wise, but I went
over.</p>

<p>"All the officers of the camp were there eating breakfast.
Captain Pard was sitting with an H Troop officer on either side of
him, and he looks at me like he wanted to laugh.</p>

<p>"'Private Hanks, did you learn anything about the occurrences of
last night?' asks the major, looking stern.</p>

<p>"I saw right away that none of them was on, excepting maybe
Captain Pard, and they evidently had been turning it over among 'em
and trying to get at the right of it.</p>

<p>"'Sir!' says I, saluting, 'as near as I can make out, a gang of
H troopers got gay around the strikers' camp, and the women
snowballed them away!'"</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="FAT_FALLON" id="FAT_FALLON">2. FAT FALLON</a>
</h2>

<p>"All soldiers go to heaven when they die," said Private Hanks as
he sat on the steps of one of the barrack halls out at Fort Logan,
carefully fishing what he called the "makings" of a cigarette from
his blouse pocket. "I bases that opinion on my own dope," he
continued. "I got it figured out that the Lord wants people in
heaven who appreciate their surroundings, and after the army a
soldier is sure able to do that.</p>

<p>"There's one man I'd like to meet up there. He's down in Arizona
now, commanding a penny-ante post on the desert, and I don't
suppose he's got much show of getting to heaven from there; but if
he does I'd like to be on the reception committee to meet him and
say: 'Come in, Fat; here's a harp and some wings, and the gang's
all here waiting for you.'</p>

<p>"Flash Fat Fallon's the man I mean &mdash; the whitest man I
ever knew. I take off my hat to Fat, and so does everyone that ever
soldiered with him. He's a captain' now, and I hope he'll live to
command the army.</p>

<p>"Fat commanded B Troop back in them days when the war business
was doing well over in the islands. That was before we lead with
our jack and caught Mr. Aguinaldo's ace, and when everybody worked
but Otis.</p>

<p>"We had one squadron of cavalry there to about ten thousand
infantry and artillery, and that one squadron gave the best
imitation of one man being two different places at the same time
you ever saw. We were out ahead of every flying column; we did a
little rear-guard duty for provision trains; a little outpost duty;
a little reconnoitring duty; a little barrack duty, and a little
everything else that nobody else could do.</p>

<p>"Say, I went into B Troop weighing about one hundred and fifty
pounds, and as soft as mush. I came out weighing one hundred and
twenty-eight, but I was like cold steel all the way through. I was
so tough my face hurt me. We had them little native horse for
mounts; and you got so strong that you'd get off and carry your
horse once in awhile, to give it a rest.</p>

<p>"Flash Fat was a lieutenant then, just from the Point, and
nothing but a big, good-natured kid. He was the only officer we had
with the troop, and he was all the same private out in the field.
He slept with us and ate with us and joshed with us and belonged to
the family generally. I'm telling you right when I say Fat used to
go out and stand outpost in his turn just like the rest of us. The
troop always worked separate from the rest of the squadron; in
fact, the whole squadron wasn't together for over a year.</p>

<p>"Flash got the name of Fat when he was a kid and used to be that
way. We tied the 'Flash' on him just to be doing. He was a kid
always, and I'll bet if you dropped in on him down there in Arizona
right now you'd find him out playing ball with the gang, or up to
some other stunt like that.</p>

<p>"When he was in barracks in Manila, before the gugu blow-off,
Fat was captain of our ball team and played catcher. We led the
Eighth Army Corps league, too.</p>

<p>"I've seen that bunch of huskies playing 'run, sheep, run,'
'duck on rock,' 'old sow,' and things like that, with Fat right in
with them, busier than a man with four hundred dollars and a
thirst. If it was too rainy to be outdoors, like as not you could
happen in our barracks and find Fat and a crowd playing miggles on
the floor of the barracks. They used to act like a bunch of school
kids at recess all the time, and at headquarters they called us
Fallons Failings; but they had an all-fired healthy regard for us
on the firing line.</p>

<p>"You couldn't tell Fat from a private out in the field. He never
wore any mark to show any difference, and he was just as
ornery-looking as the rest of us. He carried a carbine, and was
always right where the guns were going off. Fat was one of the few
officers I've seen who ever gave a private credit for doing a
little thinking for himself.</p>

<p>"In them days a troop or company commander didn't always wait
for orders from headquarters before he made a move. The troops was
pretty much scattered, and the officers had to use their own
nuts.</p>

<p>"B Troop was a rough, tough outfit, recruited in a hurry in
'Frisco for the war, and Fat didn't have no snap at first. He made
his hit with us one day in barracks, when he called down a big
stiff named Devaney for something. Devaney got mouthy when he
thought Fat was out of hearing and was telling us what he was going
to do to Fat when he got out of service. Fat heard him and steps
up, quiet-like, and says:</p>

<p>"'You needn't wait until you get out, Devaney. If you think you
can trim me, come back of the barracks and do it. If you do, I'll
see nothing's done to you for it.'</p>

<p>"Devaney couldn't renig. A big bunch of us heard it, and he
couldn't side-step talk like that. He'd been posing as a fighter
ever since he came into the troop, and be had most of us buffaloed.
So he went back of the barracks with Fat, and for some five minutes
there was the prettiest scrap I ever see. They was about the same
size and heft, but there wasn't nothing to it from the minute they
put their hands up.</p>

<p>"Devaney never laid a mitt on Fat. He never had a peek-in. Fat
stalled him for a while, just cutting his face to ribbons with
jabs, until he got him good and bruised up, and then he put him out
cold.</p>

<p>"There wasn't anyone else in the troop wanted any doings with
Fat after that, and Devaney was one of his best friends.</p>

<p>"It was a picnic out in the field with Fat, from one way of
looking at it. A hike with us was one long josh. We kidded each
other, and we kidded everybody that came along. We went into a
fight like it was all a joke, but I've seen Fat sit down beside a
guy that'd been bumped off and cry like it was his own brother.</p>

<p>"One time in October we was in Manila, resting up for a few days
after a hike down Imus way, when we gets orders to take part in an
expedition up the lake &mdash; Laguna de Bay. They was going to
clean out the town along the lake. B Troop was the only part of the
cavalry to go along, but there was a lot of doughboys, so we
figured we'd mostly guard wagon trains.</p>

<p>"Fat comes up that night with his eyes bulging out.</p>

<p>"'Say,' he says, 'we're not cavalry any more. We're hoss
marines. My orders is to load you on a casco, and we're to be towed
up to the lake by one of the army gunboats.'</p>

<p>"And that's what happened, all right. We left our horses in
Manila and loaded up on one of the big, pot-bellied cascoes that'd
hold a regiment. Then a crazy old side-wheel steamer that they'd
fitted up with a field gun and called a gunboat hitched on to us.
They was a bunch of jackies from the Olympia under a lieutenant on
the side-wheeler.</p>

<p>"Fat told us that we was to cruise around the lake until the
troops attacked a town from the land side, and then we'd go after
'em from the water side &mdash; catch 'em coming and going, you
know.</p>

<p>"It wasn't bad on the casco, because they was only about sixty
of us and they was lots of room, but the idea of cavalry-men being
turned into hoss marines give us a pain in the neck.</p>

<p>"We took it like we took everything else, though, as a big josh.
Going up to the lake, we had a picnic playing sailors. We'd stand
on top of the casco and hail all the boats that passed, like
regular sailors, and I guess we made them jackies on the tow-boat
pretty tired.</p>

<p>"Fat knew what town we was to hit first, but his orders was to
cruise off and on until we heard sounds of firing from the land
side. Laguna de Bay is what you might call a young ocean, strayed
away from its ma, and you can do a lot of cruising round without
hitting land, if you want to.</p>

<p>"We knew we'd have to monkey around that lake two or three days,
anyhow, before the troops got up, so we made ourselves right to
home on the casco.</p>

<p>"Away down in the hold some one found a lot of old pumpkins, or
squash, that the owners of the casco had left there, but they
wasn't no good to eat, so we didn't disturb 'em.</p>

<p>"The first night we was out on the lake, just trailing along
behind the tow-boat and smoking and talking, Fat says:</p>

<p>"'Fellers, when we get back to Manila again, you know what I'm
going to do? I'm going to organize a football eleven and play these
college dubs in the volunteers. I hear 'em around the English club
telling how they used to play back in the States, and they're
figuring on organizing elevens when it gets cooler. We skinned 'em
playing baseball, and we can skin 'em at football. I used to go
some miles at that game when I was at the Point. Anybody know
anything about it?'</p>

<p>"Not many did. Some used to play it when they was kids at
school, but that was so long ago most of them had forgotten it. But
we was for football if Fat said so, and we talked over all kinds of
plans before we went to sleep.</p>

<p>"'Say, loot,' says big Peterson, 'ain't that the game where they
has yells?'</p>

<p>"'Sure,' says Fat. 'I've been thinking over a lot of hot ones
for us, too. We'll have yells, and don't you forget it. Here's one
I thought of the other day. It's part Spanish, part Filipino, and
part United States:</p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"'Zooput! Zooput! Masama
&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Cosa est, no soledad
&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Razzle, dazzle,
sis-boom-ah!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">B Troop! B Troop! Rah! Rah!
Rah!'</span><br>

<p>"Fat had a voice like an army mule braying, and it wasn't no
manner of music that came from his throat when he turned it loose;
but it sounded good to us. The jackies on the tow thought we was
bugs for true. You couldn't see land on either side, you see, so
there wasn't no danger of the enemy hearing us.</p>

<p>"'Here's a good one, loot,' says Corporal Benson, who was quite
a poet, but all right at that:</p>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"'Doughboys, doughboys,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Haw! Haw! Haw!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Cavalry'll eat 'em</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Raw! Raw! Raw!'</span><br>

<p>"'Fine,' says Fat. 'Let's all practise them two.'</p>

<p>"And with him leading us, we sat on top of that casco just
churning up the water with them yells. The jackies on the tow had
the field gun trained on us in case we started to board 'em. We
kept up until we was all hoarse, Fat and Benson making up new yells
until we had about a dozen.</p>

<p>"Next morning the blamedest storm came up, and in about ten
minutes we was shy a tow. The rope busted, and the side-wheeler
went chasing on by itself, leaving us limping along by our
lonely.</p>

<p>"They wasn't no danger. That old casco wouldn't founder and it
couldn't tip over, so we didn't care a whoop. When I woke up I
heard the fiercest sort of a racket on top of the casco, and I
could make out Fat's voice. He was hollering:</p>

<p>"'Lower away the capting's gig!'</p>

<p>"'Port your helm, Mister Johnson.'</p>

<p>"'Ladies first in the life-boats.'</p>

<p>"'Toss me some light preserves.'</p>

<p>"And a lot more like that. When I lamps on top to see what was
going on, there was Fat with a half-dozen of the fellows having the
time of their lives playing sailors. Fat was standing in the bow of
the casco, which was reeling and tossing like it was drunk, and was
yelling through his hands at the others, who didn't seem to be
doing much of anything except see how reckless they could get
climbing over the boat.</p>

<p>"One feller was playing look-out at the stern, and he'd
holler:</p>

<p>"'Breakers ahead, sir!'</p>

<p>"'Where away?' Fat'd ask.</p>

<p>"'Three sheets in the wind,' says the look-out.</p>

<p>"'Luff, you lubber, luff!' bawls Fat, dancing about on the edge
of the bow until I expect him to go heels over tea-kettle into the
lake. Then he'd sing:</p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"'A sailor's life is the life for
me!'</span><br>

<p>"Down in the hold some one was bellering:</p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"'Oh, Capting Fat of the Hoss
Marines</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Fed his soldiers on pork and
beans!'</span><br>

<p>A stranger would've thought he was in the tack-house for
sure.</p>

<p>"The storm kept up 'most all day, and nary a sign of our tow did
we see. Fat decided that we'd be pirates and prey upon the vessels
that come across our path &mdash; only none come. We made Private
Barnes come through with a white under-shirt, the only one in the
troop, which he wore because he said the blue shirts scratched him,
and we h'isted it for a flag, after tearing out a square in the
centre to represent black.</p>

<p>"We had an election of officers, and Fat was made captain and me
first mate. Fat called himself Bloody Biscuit, the Loose Character
of the Laguna, and I was Jiggering Jasper, the Pie-eyed Pirate of
the Peskyhanna. We had Renegade Rube and Three-fingered Jack and
Desperate Dave and Gory John; we had Stephen Stubbs, the
Squint-eyed Scout, and all the other names you ever read in the
yellow-backs. Fat had a christening of the boat. Someone had a
bottle of pickles in his haversack, so we busted that over the bow
&mdash; inside the boat, so the pickles wouldn't escape &mdash; and
Fat says:</p>

<p>"'I christen thee the Bum Steer.'</p>

<p>"We ran everything shipshape, too. We'd talk about 'shivering
our timbers' and 'dashing our toplights,' and we'd jerk our
forelocks and say, 'Aye, aye,' to each other. If we'd only had some
stray vessels to board, it'd been great.</p>

<p>"We figured some on making Barnes walk the plank because he
kicked about tearing his shirt, but we finally compromised on
making him sit in the bow for two hours to represent the
figurehead.</p>

<p>"Along towards night the storm goes down, but still we couldn't
see our tow. We drifted all day, and was in sight of land and going
in nearer to it all the time. We had plenty of grub and tobacco to
last us a few days, and so we wasn't afraid of being lost. When
night comes on, we could see the lights of the houses on shore, and
Fat decides that we needs some lights 'aloft.'</p>

<p>"'So's our tow can run into us,' he says.</p>

<p>"Well, we didn't have nothing but candles, and they don't stay
lit without covers. Fat has a great idea.</p>

<p>"'Go down and get them pumpkins and we'll make
jack-o'-lanterns,' he says.</p>

<p>"We did. Everyone that had a candle gets a pumpkin and carves a
scary-looking devil-head out of it. We h'isted them lanterns on
sticks or hung them over the sides, and I'll bet no such looking
craft was ever seen around that whole archipelago.</p>

<p>"Fat was as pleased as a kid with a new toy. 'That's real
piratical now,' he says, and I don't doubt it was.</p>

<p>"We was drifting along slowly about a mile from the shore.
Little towns fringed that lake clear around, and we could sometimes
hear voices. Every one of the towns was an insurgent stronghold,
and some were supposed to be well fortified, which was why they was
sending a strong force to take 'em.</p>

<p>"After supper we was all on top of the casco, and Fat started us
into practising them football yells again. No one thought about the
noise. We gave them much better than the night before, and when
sixty huskies are yelling all together out on the water on a still
night it makes some disturbance, I'm telling you.</p>

<p>"We was having all kinds of fun when someone noticed the lights
going out alongshore and mentioned it to Fat.</p>

<p>"'Holy smoke!' he says. 'I forgot all about tipping our hand to
the gugus. They'll commence shooting in a minute.'</p>

<p>"But they didn't. It was quiet as the grave, and all we could
hear in towards shore was the lapping of the water.</p>

<p>"'Oh, they're just going to bed,' says Fat, and we started in
yelling again. We kept it up until midnight, with a few songs
thrown in for good measure. Fat taught us to sing:</p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"'Fifteen men on a dead man's
chest</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of
rum!'</span><br>

<p>and that made a big hit with everyone. We sung all the old songs
we knew, and they listened mighty good to us, too.</p>

<p>"Well, we finally got tired and went to sleep, leaving a couple
of guards posted. Fat had all the jack-o'-lanterns thrown
overboard, as the candles had burnt out, and there didn't seem no
chance of that tow picking us up that night.</p>

<p>"At daybreak next morning we was grounded on shore, having
drifted too close in. We was near a good-sized town, but they
didn't seem to be no signs of life in it. Fat had a couple of men
slip over and take a look at the town, but they said they couldn't
see a soul. They didn't go in very far, for fear of a trap.</p>

<p>"We was eating breakfast when the old side-wheeler we'd lost
hove in sight, looking pretty battered about the edges, but still
afloat. She came in close to us, and the naval lieutenant in
command of her bawls out:</p>

<p>"'Where you fellers been?'</p>

<p>"'Looking for you,' says Fat.</p>
"'Well, we been a-looking for you, and so's a whole brigade of
soldiers &mdash; looking for your bodies. We was just going to fire
guns over the water to raise you,' says the naval man.

<p>"'Where's the brigade?' asks Fat.</p>

<p>"'Right outside that town, and the old man's sore as a boil,'
the lieutenant says. 'You'd better go over there and report.'</p>

<p>"'Any gugus in town?' asks Fat.</p>

<p>"'Gugus? I should say not,' says the naval man. 'That's what the
old man's sore at. They ain't a single enemy nowhere.'</p>

<p>"'By the way,' this lieutenant bawls, as Fat gives us orders to
unload, 'you didn't notice anything funny around the lake last
night did you?'</p>

<p>"'Nope,' says Fat; 'what do you mean?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, nothing,' says the navy; 'only my sailors are a little
superstitious, and they've got an idea they saw a new kind of
Flying Dutchman last night.'</p>

<p>"'Must have been smoking hop,' says Fat, and the side-wheeler
backs off.</p>

<p>"We falls in on the shore and marches through the town, which
was as deserted as if no one ever did live there. They was a lot of
swell trenches where they ought to be some enemy, but they was no
enemy to be seen.</p>

<p>"About a mile outside of town they was a most inspiring sight. A
whole brigade of soldiers was camped out, infantry and field guns
and everything else &mdash; just laying there doing nothing.</p>

<p>"They created some excitement when we marches up, and old
General Hill comes a-tearing across the camp with a bunch of staff
officers.</p>

<p>"'Glad to see you, lieutenant,' he bawls at Fat.</p>

<p>"'Feared you were lost in the storm. Had a terrible time, I
guess?'</p>

<p>"'Awful,' says Fat, not batting an eye. 'Where's the enemy,
sir?'</p>

<p>"The old man looked mad a minute.</p>

<p>"'You tell us,' he says. 'Here I bring a whole brigade to take
towns that your troop alone could invest without any trouble. Not a
single insurgent or anyone else in sight. Not any of them. All the
natives, peaceful and otherwise, have taken to the hills. I guess
they got scared of us, but it's the most remarkable thing I ever
heard of. Men, women, and children &mdash; all gone. I was sure I
had reliable information that this country was alive with
insurgents, but they've gone, bag and baggage, leaving only their
trenches. We've beaten this whole side of the lake and cannot find
anyone in the towns. We caught some women who didn't seem able to
keep up with the general scramble, but they're half crazy with
fear. All the interpreters can get out of them is some nonsense
about a spirit ship that cruised along-shore last night with a lot
of screaming devils on board. They say that's what caused the
people to hide out, but of course that's silly.'</p>

<p>"'Well, what do you think of that?' says Fat to us, after the
general had gone."</p>

<h2><a name="TWO_MEN_NAMED_COLLINS" id="TWO_MEN_NAMED_COLLINS">3.
TWO MEN NAMED COLLINS</a>
</h2>

<p>I know some things all right if I could only think of them.
These guys say I'm crazy &mdash; crazy in the head like a sheep;
but I'm as happy as if I had good sense.</p>

<p>I hear 'em talking in the barracks when they think I'm not
around, and I know what they say. I'll make some of 'em hard to
catch, one of these days. They're afraid of me because I killed a
man once. Well, I evened that up, but they don't know it.</p>

<p>When I get out of the army I'm going back to driving hacks in
Denver like it was before I enlisted. It ain't my fault I'm here.
It's the old booze. I gets drunk one day and went out to
Petersburg. I met a guy there who belonged to the army, and before
I knew what I was about I had on one of these uniforms. I only got
six months more, and you bet they won't get me again.</p>

<p>Before I go I'll get good and even with some of these guys. Ever
I catch any of them fresh officers down around Arapahoe Street
after dark I'll fix 'em.</p>

<p>I've heard 'em say I'm the orneriest white man in the army. I
don't know why. I'm big and strong, but that ain't nothing. I can
take this Krag and bend it double like it was made of tin; I did it
once when I got mad at a sentry because he wouldn't let me be.</p>

<p>I can lift any man in this company waist high with one hand. I
can tear open a can of tomatoes with my teeth. But them things
don't make a guy ornery, do they?</p>

<p>I used to get drunk whenever I could, and it made me mean. They
threw it into me, too. Guardhouse all the time, and hard work. Then
one day I heard a non-com tell another they was laying for me with
a general guard to give me a bobtail and a dash at Alcatraz next
time I come up; so I quit. I haven't touched a drop in over a
year.</p>

<p>They's something funny about me, though, and I don't know what
it is. Whenever I walk post in front of the officers' quarters them
fresh guys and their women get out on the porch and watch me. They
talk just like I couldn't hear, too. I heard a woman say one day
when I was stepping off the post &mdash; it's an even hundred of my
steps from one end to the other &mdash; that I reminded her of a
caged lion.</p>

<p>"More like a big bull behind a pasture gate," says an
officer.</p>

<p>"Or a battery horse with the weaves," another sticks in.</p>

<p>Stuff like that, you know. Can you blame me for being sore?</p>

<p>About that man I killed. I didn't mean to do it. His name was
just the same as mine, Charles Collins, only they called him Pretty
Collins. He <i>was</i> pretty, too. He had a load of education, and
he got into the army accidentally, same as me.</p>

<p>I've seen lots of his kind. They're mostly to be found around
Torts or at Brown in evening clothes after a show, and they've paid
me good money for hauling 'em around in my little old hack.</p>

<p>I used to feel like jumping up and saying, "Cab, sir," every
time he came past me on the parade ground. He was a private like
anyone else, but I've seen sentries half bringing their guns down
to salute when they went by. It was the way he wore his clothes
maybe.</p>

<p>I've heard some of these guys say he spent a barrel of money
going the route, and broke his old lady's heart. His old man give
him the run, or something, so he breaks into the army. The officers
pitied him a lot, and he used to be something of a pet with them.
They didn't holler and growl at him same as they do at me and the
rest. I heard the top say once that they offered to get him
discharged, but he wouldn't stand for it. Anyway, they used to
treat him mighty white.</p>

<p>I had it in for him strong.</p>

<p>I didn't like him from the start because they used to kid us
both, changing our names around and calling him Crummy and me
Pretty. I know I ain't pretty, and I knew how they meant it.</p>

<p>The top, when he called the roll, used to put it Collins No. 1,
which was him, and Collins No. 2, which was me. They ain't anything
unusual about that, I've seen companies where they'd have four or
five Johnsons, or Browns, or Smiths.</p>

<p>I got so I hated the sight of Collins. I hated his pink and
white face, and I hated him because he wasn't supposed to be no
better than me, but <i>was</i>, somehow.</p>

<p>He didn't know how much I had it in for him, but he did know I
didn't like him, because one day he starts to joshing me with the
rest, and I took him to the mat. I had my fingers on his throat and
his white flesh came out between them like I had grabbed a lump of
dough.</p>

<p>They broke me loose, but I told him that that if ever he tried
to hand me anything again I'd bust his crust. He looked whiter than
ever, but he bowed polite and says:</p>

<p>"All right, Collins; I beg your pardon. It won't happen
again."</p>

<p>He offered me his hand, but I spit at it. He never spoke to me
again. And I hated him more than ever for it.</p>

<p>They used to rawhide me something fierce in the company. I mean
the non-coms did. I got all the extra duty there was doing. I knew
I was getting the dirty end, but I couldn't holler. It wouldn't
done me any good.</p>

<p>I've seen Pretty Collins come into quarters after taps just
spifflicated, and nothing was ever done to him. Do you wonder I was
sore on him?</p>

<p>Well, I just laid low and waited. I figured to get to him some
day some way, so I laid low.</p>

<p>Finally we goes to Manila and gets sent out on the north line,
where they was fighting about every day. That's when I gets next to
Pretty Collins.</p>

<p>He was about my height and heft, so was in the same set of fours
as me. When we fanned out in open order, that brought him next to
me, on my right. The first scrap we went into I watched Pretty, and
I was hep in a minute.</p>

<p>His face turned whiter than the time I grabbed him, and his
hands trembled so he could hardly hold his gun. I sensed him, all
right, all right. He was a coward.</p>

<p>When the bullets commenced to whistle I thought he was going to
drop in his tracks. I'm no coward, whatever I am, and you bet I
took a lot of satisfaction watching that guy suffer; because they
do suffer &mdash; all the tortures of hell, I've heard.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone else noticed him, but Pretty knew that I
knew &mdash; he looked at me once and saw me grinning.</p>

<p>I used to own a pit dog &mdash; Sunday Morning. He was beat by
Mitchell's Money on the Overland race track one Christmas day. He
was nearly all out when I picked him up for his last scratch, and
he looked at me out of his eyes like he was trying to tell me not
to send him in again. Pretty reminded me of Sunday Morning when he
looked at me across that rice paddy.</p>

<p>It wasn't much of a fight, but when it was over Pretty was as
limp as a rag. The rest thought it was too much sun, but I knew
&mdash; and Pretty knew I knew &mdash; and that was more
satisfaction to me than if the whole brigade knew. He never said
anything to me; just looked at me out of his eyes like Sunday
Morning looked.</p>

<p>It wasn't long after that he was laying in front of a line of
trenches which were across a river from us. The general commanding
the brigade and his staff was with our outfit. The gugus was
slapping a kind of blanket of bullets over our heads, and we was
hugging the ground pretty close. The general sings out to our
captain:</p>

<p>"Send a man down to Colonel Kelley on the left of the line and
tell him to advance at once."</p>

<p>You know what that meant?</p>

<p>A man had to chase across that open field for a quarter of a
mile with the gugus pecking at him. It was a two-ace bet that he
would get his before he got half way. Cap looks down the line and
says:</p>

<p>"Collins!"</p>

<p>He was looking right at Pretty, over my head, and he meant
Pretty. Man! That fellow's face was already white, but it seemed to
go dead all at once. I'll bet anything he couldn't have moved if
he'd tried, his muscles being sort o' paralysed.</p>

<p>Cap kept looking at him &mdash; over my head. It wasn't three
seconds, but it seemed three hours. When I first heard Cap call I
felt glad, because it meant all day with Pretty. Then when I looked
at Pretty's face I felt sorry, and there's where I made a sucker of
myself. I jumped up and started on a run down the line. Cap didn't
say anything. It looked like I had made a mistake and thought be
meant me, but Cap knew better &mdash; and he knew I knew better
&mdash; and Pretty knew better.</p>

<p>They shot at me considerable and winged me a little once, but I
delivered the order and got back in time to go into the charge with
my outfit.</p>

<p>I could've gone into the hospital if I'd wanted to, but I wasn't
hurt very bad. That night I was sleeping near Cap and the two
lieutenants, and I heard Cap say:</p>

<p>"The old man is going to recommend Crummy Collins for a
stiffycate of merit. He wanted to make him a lieutenant, but I
showed him the" &mdash; something &mdash;"of such a course.</p>

<p>"I meant Pretty Collins all the time, because I knew it was a
chance to take him out of the ranks. He could have won his shoulder
straps right there, but &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think he's &mdash;" something I didn't get again, one of
the loots asked.</p>

<p>"I fear he is," says Cap, and I went to sleep.</p>

<p>Well, we put in nearly two years on the islands, but Pretty got
transferred to special duty, and I didn't see no more of him until
we sailed for home. He looked kind of bad in the face, like he'd
been going too strong, but he was just as popular as ever in the
company. No one knew what Cap and me knew, and I didn't tell, but
Pretty kept away from me.</p>

<p>By this time the gang had commenced to treat me a little better,
because I'd showed 'em I was a good game guy, but I didn't have no
bunkies.</p>

<p>I'd almost forgotten Pretty while he was away, but when he comes
back again he made me just as sore as ever at him &mdash; just by
being around, you know.</p>

<p>He didn't get so much petting from the officers as he used to,
but he was still the whole thing with the bucks.</p>

<p>We went to Fort D. A. Russell, just out of Cheyenne, from
'Frisco, and I gets my stiffycate of merit there. It's a big sheet
of paper, something like an officer's commission, all engraved,
with my name and outfit and telling what I'd done when I carried
that order across the firing line. Best of all, it gives me a
couple of bucks extra pay every month. I stuck it away in my chest
and didn't show it to any of the guys, although they knew I got it.
You're supposed to send these things home to the people, so they
can frame 'em and hang 'em up in the parlour, but I didn't have no
people or parlour either.</p>

<p>We hadn't been in Russell more'n a month when Pretty shows up
one morning missing. They calls his name for ten mornings at
roll-call, and then they posts him as a deserter. It like to broke
these guys that'd been so friendly to him all up, and you bet I was
glad.</p>

<p>They caught him in a couple of weeks up in Rock Springs on a
drunk, and they brings him back to Russell and slaps him in the
general prison. He's good for about eighteen months at the lowest,
because the officers that had been so friendly to him shook him
right away.</p>

<p>I was doing guard duty one day over a bunch of prisoners
cleaning up quarters, and Pretty was one of 'em. I wasn't paying
much attention to any but him, watching him moving around in that
brown suit with the big white P on his back, when all of a sudden
he makes a break.</p>

<p>He must a-gone nutty. He didn't have a chance in the world to
get away. They told me he said before he cashed in that he got wild
having my eyes follow him around, but that's rot. All I did, so
help me, was just watch him, and I leave it to any one if that
should make him go bugs.</p>

<p>I hollered at him to halt three times. Then I aimed at him,
meaning to hit him in the leg. His head kept bobbing in front of my
sights, and he was getting further away all the time, so I had to
let go. He dropped and laid there kicking around.</p>

<p>The whole barracks come running up, and I don't remember much
else, except that they relieved me and sent me to quarters.</p>

<p>None of the fellows would talk to me or tell me what was doing,
but I heard someone say he was dead. I stayed in quarters all the
next day, and no one come near me. If I'd walk up to some of the
fellows they'd get up and move off, like they was afraid of me. The
Cap come in towards evening and talked kind to me. He said I'd only
done my duty, but that it would be best for me to be transferred,
and they was going to send me to Plattsburg to join another
regiment. That was all right with me. He told me to get my junk
together and get ready to go right away.</p>

<p>It didn't take me no time to pack. While I was throwing my stuff
into my chest I came across that stiffycate of merit and shoved it
in the inside pocket of my blouse.</p>

<p>I heard some of the fellows talking that night, and they spoke
about "him", so I knew they meant Pretty.</p>

<p>"His father and mother are coming in a special train from the
East," one of them said. "The top and four non-coms are going to
take him to Denver and turn him over to them."</p>

<p>No one even looked at me all this time.</p>

<p>Cap give me my transfer papers and transportation that night,
and next morning I went to Cheyenne and got a train for Denver.
Only the Cap said good-bye to me.</p>

<p>At Denver I missed the first I was to take east, and hung around
the depot all day. Along towards evening a train of just a baggage
car and a Pullman pulled in while I was looking through the fence
outside the depot. The Pullman blinds were down, and it looked so
mournful and still that I had a hunch right away that it was
Pretty's folks. I was right, too. A grey-haired man, who moves
around brisk and talks rough to the porters, gets off and helps a
little old lady, all dressed in black, to the platform. You
couldn't see much of her face on account of a heavy veil, but you
could tell by her eyes that she had been crying a lot.</p>

<p>They hadn't more'n got on the platform when the regular Cheyenne
train pulls in and the top sergeant and a squad of non-coms from my
old company hops off. The old man leads the little old lady up to
them, and they shook hands all around and stood talking awhile.</p>

<p>Then they went to the baggage car, and the squad hauls out a
long wooden box with a flag across it. Somehow it made me sort o'
sick to look at it, because I knew Pretty was inside.</p>

<p>The non-coms put the box on a truck and pushes it over to the
special train and shoves the box in the Pullman &mdash; not in the
baggage car.</p>

<p>The old lady follows it in, and the man stood at the end of the
Pullman talking to the top. I couldn't stand it no longer. I wanted
to hear what they said, so I sneaks through the gate and around
behind a train on the track next to the Pullman.</p>

<p>The old man was saying:</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad the boy died like a gentleman, anyway. He was
always a little wild, but I never believed he was a coward. I was
rather pleased when he joined the army, because I felt it would
make a man of him."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the top says, "he was a man all right. He gave that
prisoner a hard fight before he went under, and would have won out
if the prisoner hadn't been stronger."</p>

<p>I see the drift all right. They was making this old man believe
Pretty had been killed in the performance of his duty; see? I
listens to a little more, and I makes out that the top has told him
Pretty was guarding prisoners, when one of 'em turns on him and
shoots him with his own gun. He was giving Pretty a great
send-off.</p>

<p>Maybe you think I wasn't dead sore!</p>

<p>What right had they to tell all them lies? If it'd been me in
the box they'd probably have said I was the worst black-guard in
the army and got all that was coming to me.</p>

<p>The top and the other non-coms shake hands all around with the
old man again, and then they hikes off. The old man goes into the
Pullman, and the engine crew get ready to pull out. I make up my
mind in about two seconds, Mex., to go in there and tell them folks
all about Pretty and why I had to kill him. I see my chance to get
good and even with him more than ever.</p>

<p>I climbed on the rear platform and opens the door. The box was
in the aisle, and the old lady was setting in a seat beside it. The
old man was with her, holding her hands, and she was crying, soft
and easy like. He isn't crying, but he looks old and tired.</p>

<p>They both raise their heads when I come in and looked at me like
they was waiting for me to say something.</p>

<p>"I soldiered with him," I says, pointing to the box.</p>

<p>The old lady looked at me out of Pretty's eyes, just as Pretty
looked at me that day across the rice paddy. She almost smiled.</p>

<p>"He was all I had," she said. "He was his mother's boy."</p>

<p>The old man didn't say anything &mdash; just looked me over.</p>

<p>I don't know what got the matter with me. I couldn't say a thing
&mdash; just stand there looking at them two like a sad-eyed dub.
The words I wanted to tell 'em wouldn't come.</p>

<p>"He was a good soldier?" the old man finally asks.</p>

<p>It wasn't what I meant to say, but I just had to tell him
yes.</p>

<p>"He was all we had," the old man said. "It is a hard blow, but
it is softened by knowing that he served his country well and died
in the line of duty."</p>

<p>I tried to shake myself together and tell them that their boy
had been a coward and a deserter, and if he'd lived would have put
in a year or so in prison, with a yellow bob-tail discharge at the
end, but I couldn't do it &mdash; that's all.</p>

<p>The train commenced to back up, getting ready to start out.</p>

<p>"Do you know of any of his companions who have any reminder of
my darling boy?" the old lady asked. "They didn't bring anything
&mdash; but his body."</p>

<p>I felt something crackle in my inside breast-pocket. Ain't I a
sucker, though? I stuck my hand in and hauls out that stiffycate of
merit.</p>

<p>"Here," I says, handing it to her. "They sent this to you by
me."</p>

<p>And then I hikes out of that car, for fear I might get dingey
and bust out crying myself.</p>

<p>I know some things, all right, all right.</p>

<h2><a name="AS_BETWEEN_FRIENDS" id="AS_BETWEEN_FRIENDS">4. AS
BETWEEN FRIENDS</a>
</h2>

<center>1</center>

<p>ABIMILECH FETCHER sat upon the front stoop of the Parkins County
court-house, smoking a fretful pipe and paying no heed to the
snow-lined breezes that searched his meagre apparel. He gazed with
eyes of gloom upon the frame houses and store buildings, standing
like serrated teeth; his gaze travelled moodily on to the vast
expanse of flat country which aproned the small but enthusiastic
town of Advance, and against the far horizon he could see the
windmills, flogged by a relentless eastern Colorado wind, waving
wildly. Abimilech Fetcher, Sheriff of the County officer Parkins
aforesaid, was a study of Gloom, done in heavy corpulent lines.</p>

<p>A tall, thin ragged young man, with a self-confident air and a
lean, alert face, suddenly sketched himself into the picture and
stood looking at Abimilech Fetcher, who returned the gaze
morosely.</p>

<p>"Well," said the young man finally, "I may be wrong, but if I
was guessin' and had just one guess, it'd be that there sits
'Chicago Fat,' lookin' as sad and forlorn as a millionaire in
gaol."</p>

<p>The dull eyes of Abimilech Fetcher slowly brightened.</p>

<p>"It's me," he said. "And you might be 'Kid' Switch."</p>

<p>He arose and extended a cheerless fat hand. "Set down, Kid, set
down, and tell me how come you to git shoved offen the main
line."</p>

<p>"You tell me what <i>you're</i> doin' here," said Kid Switch. "I
heard you'd quit hoboin' some years back and had settled down
somewheres, but this can't be the where?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Abimilech drearily, "this is it. I'm the Sheriff.
Also I'm a married man, with two children and a mortgage on my
house, and I'm starvin' to death right now, Kid."</p>

<p>Kid Switch laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>"That's it &mdash; laugh!" said Abimilech bitterly. "I've gotta
notion to vag you. You're the first feller that even looks like a
possible prisoner I've seen in a year. Whatta you doin' here,
anyway, Kid?"</p>

<p>"On my way to San Francisco," said Switch. "I didn't know this
was a branch line until I got here. I snared a freight train at the
junction, havin' been chased offen a varnished rattler, and I
didn't know I wasn't pursuin' the main haulage-way until I peeked
out and saw this wide place in the road. And to think I've scairt
you up &mdash; Chicago Fat &mdash; who usta be one of the grandest
hoboes in the world!"</p>

<p>"It's me, Kid," said Abimilech. "And I thank you for them words.
Sometimes I wisht I'd stuck to the road, but I got remorse and fat
and et cetery and here I be, starvin' to death. I was a good hobo
&mdash; I was a good hobo when you was just a gay cat, and I might
be a good one yet, barrin' the fat."</p>

<p>"Tell me what's the trouble," urged Switch, as he contemplated
the stout figure and suppressed further hilarity.</p>

<p>"It's the cussed fee system," said Abimilech. "The Sheriff has
to make his livin' offen fees. If he's on the main line, like ole
Tobias over here in the next county, he can arrest enough of you
hoboes in the winter time to make money. We git paid a dollar a day
for feedin' prisoners and we kin feed 'em for ten cents a day, if
we use judgment<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">&mdash; that's ninety cents
profit. If you've got enough prisoners you</span><br>
kin git fat. If you ain't got no prisoners, you starve, or go to
work. I been Sheriff two years, come next month, and I ain't seen
enough mallyfacters to keep me in kerosene and other
delicacies."</p>

<p>"If you had, say twelve prisoners for, say, ten days each, would
that help you any!" asked Kid Switch.</p>

<p>"Help!" said Abimilech. "Help! Say, Kid, it'd set me in swell!
I'd perk up and take a reg'lar interest in life. But what's the use
o' talkin'? How kin I git twelve prisoners? How kin I git any
prisoners, when folks don't violate the law, or if they do they're
friends o' yourn and you dassen't stick 'em!"</p>

<p>"I met 'Cleveland' George yesterday and he tells me a bunch of
the fellers are layin' out the cold spell with your neighbour,
Tobias," said Switch.</p>

<p>"He's a mean guy, is Tobias," interrupted Abimilech.</p>

<p>"Bein' prosperous, he's natchally mean."</p>

<p>"Well, he's all right to the tourists," said Kid Switch. "And a
dozen or more of them are hangin' up with him for a coupla weeks.
They're nearly all ole time pals o' yourn and mine and'd be glad to
help you out if it was put to 'em right. We'll call my end just
half, if that's satisfactory to you."</p>

<p>"Talk sense, Kid," urged the bewildered Abimilech. "I don't git
you. How'm I goin' to git them fellers? Tobias ain't goin' to lend
me any. He's too blame stingy."</p>

<p>"Listen," said the Kid mysteriously. "But let's find some place
where it ain't so crimpy around the edges."</p>

<center>2</center>

<p>Sheriff John Tobias, of Queever County, had at least a nodding
acquaintance with all the gentry of the break-beams who travelled
from East to West a few years ago. The county seat of Queever
County is a division point on a trans-continental railroad and
during the year hundreds of nomadic individuals pass that way.</p>

<p>The Queever County gaol is a rickety, but fairly comfortable
structure and during bad weather it was the custom for the human
birds of passage to lodge with Sheriff John Tobias and thus insure
him, in return for good food and treatment, a prosperous business
under the fee system.</p>

<p>He had a sort of gentleman's agreement with the veterans of the
rail that they might plead guilty to a charge of vagrancy before
the only justice of the peace in the town and ten days was the
limit of their sentences. Novices, who were sensitive in the matter
of being called vagrants, but who desired shelter over a stretch of
untravellable weather, could plead to a charge of carrying
concealed weapons &mdash; a razor being a weapon in those parts,
and Sheriff John Tobias was obliging to the extent of furnishing
the razor.</p>

<p>No one really had to remain in the Queever County gaol; it was
of such a frail texture that even a sparrow might have escaped
without great difficulty. Half a dozen tunnels beneath the floor,
leading to sunshine and liberty, told of the passing, in days gone
by, of many an itinerant from the hands of less obliging officers
than Sheriff John Tobias.</p>

<p>In his regime, if a prisoner happened to be in a hurry, Tobias
would permit him to go before the expiration of his term, via the
front door, and would speed him on his way with words of cheer.</p>

<p>Through the years of his long tenure of office this arrangement
endured, an indictment against the fee system, perhaps, but a
source of comfort to those who travelled the western trails in that
day. The town of Queever understood the situation, but when the
gaol was filled, plenty of supplies had to be purchased of the
local merchants, for Tobias was content with small profits and
treated his patrons liberally; the local merchants consequently
favoured the full county gaol, particularly as the burden of
taxation fell upon the balance of the county, which probably, did
not fully understand.</p>

<p>Sheriff John Tobias was viewing the snowstorm from the window of
the gaol office with deep satisfaction; snow meant that his gaol
population would rest contented against the coming of warmer
weather. The darkened skies, pinned down all around the horizon,
foretold a long continued storm.</p>

<p>The office bell jangled shrilly and Sheriff Tobias opened the
door to look upon the damp figure of Kid Switch, who had found a
ten-mile tramp across the snow a bit more of a hardship than he had
figured on. Only freight trains ran to Advance and they were few
and far between.</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" said Sheriff Tobias, heavily. "Come right in,
Switch! I haven't seen you in over a year. Come in, boy, you'll
find a lot of friends present, if you're plannin' to stay, and
they'll be mighty glad to see you."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said the Kid. "Stake me to some dry clothes,
Sheriff; I'm as wet as a fish. I'm goin' to hang up with you until
it clears a little."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said the Sheriff, with the unction of a hotel clerk
greeting a wealthy guest and leading the way to a big steel door,
from behind which came a subdued murmur of voices. "You'll find
'Red,' and Gordon, and Kline, and Kilgallon, and the 'Philadelphia
Shine' and a lot of friends inside, Kid. Cleveland George left here
yesterday. It's a good Winter for me, son."</p>

<p>Kid Switch was familiar with the personnel of Tobias' guests,
having been enlightened by Cleveland George. He was prepared for
the roar of greeting which arose when he stepped into the
"bull-pen" of the none too commodious gaol. After having changed
his wet clothing for capacious garments loaned by the Sheriff,
Switch took a careful inventory of those present and found that,
besides nine whom he knew personally, there were three
subdued-looking individuals. He diagnosed them as "natives."</p>

<p>"They're holdovers to the next term of the district court,"
explained Kilgallon contemptuously. "Plain yaps charged with
stealin' cattle or somethin'. They ain't even got sense enough to
git out o' this pokey and we use 'em to do the cleanin' up. I
thought you was on your way to the Coast, Kid?"</p>

<p>"I was," replied Switch. "But I've stopped over to do a friend a
turn. Bring all the fellers except them rubes around me and I'll
let you in on the play."</p>

<p>"You all know the old Chicago Fat?" was his introductory remark
as he squatted upon the floor and nine choice gentlemen who had
carved their initials on every water-tank between the coasts
gathered about him. Most of them nodded, Kilgallon with
emphasis.</p>

<p>"Ain't he the guy that got up the hoboes' convention?" he
demanded. "Well, he done me dirt &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" interrupted the Kid. "That's past and gone. He's
in hard lines now."</p>

<p>With vivid eloquence he painted a verbal picture of Abimilech
Fetcher, once Chicago Fat, starving at his own hearth-side, as it
were; he etched in pathetic touches here and there which caused the
inky face of Philadelphia Shine to wrinkle lugubriously.</p>

<p>"Fat was a good guy," said Kid Switch. "He was always helpin'
someone else and now he's in distress it seems to me we oughta
remember them ole ties &mdash; ties of brotherhood and such, I mean
&mdash; and go over there and give him a play for ten days so he
can make his fees offen us. We can step out through one of the ole
tunnels to-night and hike over there in no time."</p>

<p>"No, sah!" dissented the Shine. "Ah ain't makin' no
premedjutated changes. Dis hive suits me an' Ah ain't movin' till
mah rent comes due!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" said Kid Switch savagely. "You'll go if the rest
do."</p>

<p>"It ain't a bad idea," said Kline, a pallid young man who was
known to the police between the two coasts as a hotel sneak-thief,
but who was, withal, romantic-looking and interesting. "We've been
pretty good to ole Tobias. And after we stay at Fat's for a week or
so, if the weather is still bad, we can come back here and finish
out with Tobe."</p>

<p>Kilgallon, Jack Gordon, the "Cincinnati Skin," "Red," Henry
Hennessey, "One-Thumb" Cafferty, George, "the Greek" and Heine Barr
nodded grave approval.</p>

<p>"We'd better take them felons, too," said Gordon. "They'll help
swell the count."</p>

<p>"Them's vallyble felons and Tobias thinks as much of them as he
does of his right arm," demurred Hennessey. "Supposin' they'd beat
it?"</p>

<p>"They've got a fat chance!" said Kid Switch. "We'll take 'em
right along and return 'em to Tobe when we git through. Set 'em to
work cleanin' out one of them tunnels now."</p>

<center>3</center>

<p>Abimilech Fetcher doubted that Kid Switch would be able to carry
out his plan successfully; long continued adversity had made
Abimilech pessimistic, but he waited, nevertheless, in the rarely
occupied bastille of Parkins County and amused himself playing
solitaire as the night wore on. His teeth chattered as occasional
wisps of wind sneaked through the chinks in the building and he
shook his head dolefully as he looked about the bare quarters the
thrifty commonwealth had designed for criminal habitation.</p>

<p>As compared to the county gaol of Queever County, the Parkins
place of incarceration was a shanty against a country villa.
Queever County had at least provided heat and electric lights.
Parkins County simply purchased a tier of steel cells, set them
down upon the ground and walled them in with loosely laid brick.
Lanterns were the source of whatever illumination was required.</p>

<p>"I never seen a worse one myself," mused Abimilech. "And I've
seen some bad ones. I never thought it looked so fierce before
until it comes to offerin' it to my friends."</p>

<p>A shout aroused him from his shivering reverie and he opened the
door to admit a terrific gust of wind and an assemblage of chilled
and profane men.</p>

<p>"We're here," said Kid Switch, shaking a blanket of snow from
his shoulders. "Maybe you think it ain't some job herdin' three
felons through ten miles of snow, specially when they know the
country and have a yen to go home. And that coon there &mdash;" He
turned a baleful eye upon Philadelphia Shine who snuffled damply in
a corner.</p>

<p>"He bus' me in the nose," wined the Shine dolorously.</p>

<p>Abimilech Fetcher was engaged in shaking hands with friends of
another day. A pang of remorse bit at his vitals as he found
himself surrounded by faces he had been more than glad to see in
times gone by, and Kilgallon almost forgot the discomfort of that
long march over the snow as he held a passage in rough repartee
with Abimilech.</p>

<p>"I suttinly appreciates your kindness, fellers," said the
Sheriff. "I suttinly do. Now if you'll step into them cells two in
each, I'll bed you down for the night."</p>

<p>"Ah doan lak dis place," sniffed the Shine. "Ah reckon Ah'll go
back to Mista Tobe's."</p>

<p>"Second the motion!" said One-Thumb Cafferty, who had been
investigating the tiny cells.</p>

<p>At that moment the front door again opened and admitted two
stalwart individuals whose coats bulged ominously and who wore
gleaming stars upon their bosoms. Abimilech was relieved. He had
become slightly alarmed over the tardiness of these efficient
farm-hands whom he had impressed as deputies that afternoon and
whom he had instructed to hasten to the gaol upon the arrival of
any strangers. His manner changed. He looked as stern as it is
possible for a fat man to look.</p>

<p>"Silence!" he roared. "Gaol rules prohibit talkin'. Officers,
put 'em in their cells!" he added, turning to the newcomers.</p>

<p>Kid Switch looked at Abimilech, startled.</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' to double-cross me!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Ah-h-h," said Abimilech. "Of course not."</p>

<p>He personally escorted Switch into a small cell near the door
and locked him up by himself.</p>

<p>"You're a swell actor, 'bo," he whispered. "They ain't on."</p>

<p>As the locks clicked behind the prisoners, Gordon shouted, "Turn
on some heat, will you?"</p>

<p>"Heat!" bellowed Abimilech. "They ain't no heat! Lessee, you're
Gordon, ain't you? I know a man what looks like you who would
interest some people in Oskaloosa."</p>

<p>Gordon subsided immediately.</p>

<p>"Hey, you!" bawled Red Hennessey bitterly. "What about that
church door welcome mat that got lost in Sacramento when you was
there last?"</p>

<p>Abimilech went close to the door of the cell and hissed,
"Statoot of limentations, Red: statoot of limentations. But maybe I
kin dig up some place where the statoot ain't run gain Henry
Hennessey."</p>

<p>Whereupon Red became strangely silent.</p>

<p>"If these guys git to chewin' the rag with you, just git some
pails o' cold water and throw it in on them," instructed Abimilech
to his deputies, as he took his departure.</p>

<p>Then the night wore on in cold silence, broken only by the
intermittent comment of the guards upon the weather and the
prospective crops. The prisoners sat hunched up in their chilly
cells whispering schemes of vengeance not only upon Abimilech
Fetcher, but upon that incarnation of misguided philanthropy, Kid
Switch, who slept the sleep of the just and innocent beneath a
large country quilt which Abimilech had thoughtfully left in his
cell.</p>

<p>Morning brought a succession of incidents, including some
underdone beans and an apology for coffee. Abimilech also arrived
accompanied by an aged bewhiskered individual who wore an air of
vast solemnity and carried an enormous book.</p>

<p>Abimilech called him "Judge." A table was placed in the narrow
corridor before the cells and Abimilech seated the tottering Judge
thereat with much ceremony. Then the Judge opened his book, scanned
the pages through gigantic horn spectacles and read:</p>

<p>"John Doe, <i>alias</i> George Kilgallon."</p>

<p>"That's this wicked-lookin' murderer here," said Abimilech,
indicating the peaceful Kilgallon. "Stand up, you Doe, <i>alias</i>
Kilgallon! This is your trial!"</p>

<p>"Who'd I resist and who'd I assault?" roared Kilgallon.</p>

<p>The Judge was evidently deaf, as Abimilech bawled in his
ear:</p>

<p>"He says he's guilty and that you're a &mdash; ole fool."</p>

<p>"Hey!" howled Kilgallon, in wild remonstrance.</p>

<p>"Six months!" piped the Judge, making an entry in his book.</p>

<p>"Richard Roe, <i>alias</i> the Philadelphia Shine," he read
next.</p>

<p>"Assault with a deadly weapon and attempt to commit arson."</p>

<p>"Ah wants a mouthpiece! Ah wants a lie-er!" yelled the Shine in
a great dismay.</p>

<p>"He says he's guilty," bellowed Abimilech into the whiskers of
the Court.</p>

<p>"Ninety days," said the Judge.</p>

<p>Hennessey got three months on a charge of stealing chickens;
One-Thumb Cafferty got sixty days on a charge of disturbance; the
three felons were given twenty days each for vagrancy and all the
others received varying sentences on various charges without having
the opportunity of saying a word. Some turmoil arose, as they
endeavoured to voice their protests, but the deputies secured
buckets of water and quelled the incipient disturbance by a dumb
show of throwing it over the already half-frozen prisoners.</p>

<p>"Kid Switch," said the Judge finally. "You are charged with
carrying concealed weapons!"</p>

<p>"Not guilty!" shouted the Kid from the depths of his cell, where
he was still buried beneath the quilt.</p>

<p>"This man's a dangerous character," yelled Abimilech. "You'd
better get rid of him."</p>

<p>"Two hours to leave town," squeaked the old man and then the
procession filed out, while the prisoners babbled wildly. Abimilech
stopped long enough to unlock Kid Switch's cell.</p>

<p>"You don't want to let dark ketch you here," he warned.</p>

<p>You don't want to let me ketch you anywhere!" howled Gordon from
his cell, regardless of the deputies, and there was a hoarse
growling from the other prisoners.</p>

<p>Outside the gaol door, Abimilech handed Kid Switch a package of
yellow bills.</p>

<p>"That represents every cent I could borry," he said. "It means a
second mortgage on my house and everything else. I didn't like to
hand it to the gang so hard, but I can't let this good thing get
away from me. It'll never happen again. I wouldn't want to be in
your shoes when them parties gits out."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said the Kid lightly. "I can square it with
them."</p>

<p>"Square it!" said Abimilech. "What a chance! You better beat it
out o' town now, before some of the citizens take a shot at you on
general principles. Square it! What a nerve!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Kid Switch blithely. "You won't hear from me
for quite a while."</p>

<p>And then he set off, kicking the snow before him in little
flurries and Sheriff Abimilech Fetcher looked at the gaol with a
complacent grin.</p>

<p>"Here's where I either git rich of bankrupt the county," he
said. "I may have give it to 'em a little strong, but a feller has
got to snatch his opportunities nowadays. I suppose I will have to
give 'em <i>some</i> heat."</p>

<center>4</center>

<p>When Sheriff John Tobias found his gaol depopulated he did not
immediately notify the citizens. He sat down to think the matter
over. By creating tumult, the people might become cognizant of a
laxity of vigilance around the bastille which would hardly redound
to the credit of the Sheriff. Besides, Tobias felt that the strange
exodus was no common gaol break.</p>

<p>Fresh snow bad fallen during the night and the ground gave no
clue. No train had passed through since the preceding day, owing to
blockades, and it was quite cold. Tobias was satisfied that his
guests would not have undertaken travel in such weather simply
because of a sudden desire for freedom.</p>

<p>"Them boys wouldn't a-took my felons," he argued. "They wouldn't
let no ornery cattle thieves go with them."</p>

<p>So the old Sheriff sat quiet and pondered the matter throughout
the day. The light of information broke upon him along in the
evening and the people were aroused by the clamour of a huge bell
in the tower of the court-house, used to apprise the public of
trouble and festivity. The citizens hurried to the court-house,
carrying lanterns, guns and pitchforks, to find Sheriff John Tobias
waiting on the steps of the building.</p>

<p>As soon as he could secure order, the Sheriff made public an
address.</p>

<p>"My friends," he said, "they's been a gaol burglary. My
prisoners, including felons what stole cattle on the Piedras, was
stole out of my gaol by Abimilech Fetcher, Sheriff of Parkins
County, who now holds them without warrant o' law in his gaol. He
larcenied my prisoners, bag and baggage, including them felons,
well knowin' the same to be then and there my pussonel property and
the goods and chattels o' Queever County. He figgers to collect
fees offen his illgotten gains from the County o' Parkins, which
never has no prisoners, because no prisoner would ever become such
thereabouts if he had any sense. Shell this town stand for such
injestice, my friends? I don't think it shell. Shell it allow my
gaol to be burglarized and my prisoners stolen away to fatten the
fee account o' Abimilech Fetcher? I don't think it shell."</p>

<p>The crowd yelled "No, no!"</p>

<p>"Then, my friends," said Sheriff John Tobias, "I want volunteers
to go with me and rescue them poor prisoners from the clutches of
the rapscallion Fetcher."</p>

<p>Forty or fifty men stepped forward with alacrity.</p>

<p>"Come on!" shouted Tobias.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes a weird procession of horse-men, light buggies
and footmen was streaming across the snow towards Advance,
clamouring for the blood of Abimilech Fetcher.</p>

<p>Arriving at the county seat of Parkins County and finding the
town asleep, the citizens of Queever lost no time in assailing the
gaol. The prisoners, who had put in a wretched day, were vastly
alarmed, fearing that they were to be the victims of mob violence,
but when they saw Sheriff Tobias leading a charge through the
shattered door, they set up a cheer of welcome. Abimilech's
deputies disappeared with amazing rapidity.</p>

<p>A general reunion was in progress inside and outside the gaol,
the three felons being the only persons present not transported
with joy at the turn of events, when Abimilech Fetcher, in a state
of great dishevelment, rushed upon the scene.</p>

<p>"Hey! Whatta you doin' with my prisoners?" he roared at Sheriff
Tobias. "It's agin the law!"</p>

<p>"Your prisoners! I like your nerve!" said Tobias. "Whose
prisoners be you gents?" he asked of the assembled gaolbirds.</p>

<p>"Yours!" they cried in chorus.</p>

<p>"Come on, then, let's go home," said Tobias.</p>

<p>The prisoners assembled with alacrity. Abimilech viewed the
proceedings with a feeling of dismay. Then a thought occurred to
him.</p>

<p>"Lemme ask you one thing, Tobias," he said. "How'd you find out
where them people was?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Tobias, "Kid Switch, he told me. I give him fifty
dollars for the information. He wouldn't let it out until I paid
him the money, either. What's the matter, 'Bimilech!"</p>

If he's got to die let him die by the Book, with a Death that he

<span style="margin-left: 16em;">&mdash; <i>Songs of the
"Shut-Ins"</i></span><br>

<p>The condemned man in the cell next to us laughed incessantly. He
had been sentenced that morning, and they told us he had started
laughing as soon as the words, "May the Lord have mercy on your
soul," were pronounced. He was to be taken to the penitentiary next
day to await execution.</p>

<p>Chicago Red had manifested a lively interest in the case. The
man had killed a railroad brakeman, so one of the guards told us;
had killed him coldly, and without provocation. The trial had
commenced since our arrival at the county jail and had lasted three
days, during which time Red talked of little else.</p>

<p>From the barred windows of the jail corridor, when we were
exercising, we could see the dingy old criminal court across the
yard and Red watched the grim procession to and from the jail each
day. He speculated on the progress of the trial; he knew when the
case went to the jury, and when he saw the twelve men, headed by
the two old bailiffs returning after lunch the third day, he
announced:</p>

<p>"They've got the verdict, and it's first degree murder. They
ain't talking and not a one has ever grinned."</p>

<p>Then when the unfortunate was brought back, laughing that dismal
laugh, Red said:</p>

<p>"He's nutty. He was nutty to go. It ain't exactly right to swing
that guy."</p>

<p>Red and I were held as suspects in connection with an affair
which had been committed a full forty-eight hours before we landed
in town. We had no particular fear of being implicated in the
matter, and the officers had no idea that we had anything to do
with it, but they were holding us as evidence to the public that
they were working on the case. We had been "vagged" for ten days
each.</p>

<p>It was no new experience for us in any respect &mdash; not even
the condemned man, for we had frequently been under the same roof
with men sentenced to die. The only unusual feature was Red's
interest in the laughing man.</p>

<p>"Red," I asked, as we sat playing cards, "did you ever kill a
man?"</p>

<p>He dropped a card calmly, taking the trick, and as he
contemplated his hand, considering his next lead, he answered:</p>

<p>"For why do you ask me that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; I just wondered," I said. "You've seen and
done so many things that I thought you might accidentally have met
with something of the sort."</p>

<p>"It isn't exactly a polite question," he replied. "I've seen
some murders. I've seen quite a few, in fact. I've seen some pulled
off in a chief's private office, when they was sweating some poor
stiff; and I've seen some, other places."</p>

<p>"Did you ever kill a man?" I insisted.</p>

<p>He studied my lead carefully.</p>

<p>"I never did," he finally answered. "That is to say, I never
bumped no guy off personal. I never had nothing to do with no job
from which come ghosts to wake me up at night and bawl me out. They
say a guy what kills a man never closes his eyes again, even when
he really sleeps. I go to the hay, and my eyes are shut tight, so I
know I ain't to be held now or hereafter for nothing like
that."</p>

<p>We finished the game in silence, and Red seemed very thoughtful.
He laid the cards aside, rolled a cigarette, and said:</p>

<p>"Listen! I never killed no guy personal, like I say; I mean for
nothing he done to me. I've been a gun and crook for many years,
like you know, but I'm always mighty careful about hurting anyone
permanent. I'm careful about them pete jobs, so's not to blow up no
harmless persons, and I always tell my outside men that, when they
have to do shooting, not to try to hit anyone. If they did,
accidental, that ain't my fault. One reason I took to inside work
was to keep from having to kill anyone. I've been so close to being
taken that I could hear the gates of the Big House slam, and one
little shot would have saved me a lot of trouble, but I always did
my best to keep from letting that shot go. I never wanted to kill
no man. I've been in jams where guys were after me good and strong,
and I always tried to get by without no killings.</p>

<p>"I said I never killed a guy. I helped once, but it wasn't
murder. It's never worried me a bit since, and I sleep good."</p>

<p>He walked to the window and peered out into the yard where a
bunch of sparrows were fluttering about. Finally he turned and
said:</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that for quite a while, and I never do
until I see some poor stiff that's been tagged to go away. Some of
them make me nervous &mdash; especially this tee-hee guy next to
us. I'll tell you about Soupbone Pew &mdash; some day you can write
it, if you want to."</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Soupbone Pew was a rat who trained years ago with Billy Coulon,
the Honey Grove Kid, and a bunch of other old-timers that you've
never seen. It was before my time, too, but I've heard them talk
about him. He was in the Sioux City bank tear-off, when they all
got grabbed and were sent to the Big House for fifteen years each.
In them days Soupbone was a pretty good guy. He had nerve, and was
smart, and stood well with everybody, but a little stretch in the
big stir got to him. He broke bad. Honey Grove laid a plan for a
big spring &mdash; a get-away &mdash; while they were up yonder. It
looked like it would go through, too, but just as they were about
ready, Soupbone got cold feet and gave up his insides.</p>

<p>For that he got a pardon, and quit the road right off. He became
a railroad brakeman, and showed up as a shack running between Dodge
City and La Junta. And he became the orneriest white man that God
ever let live, too.</p>

<p>To hoboes and guns he was like a reformed soak toward a drunk.
He treated them something fierce. He was a big, powerful stiff, who
could kill a man with a wallop of his hands, if he hit him right,
and his temper soured on the world. Most likely it was because he
was afraid that every guy on the road was out to get him because of
what he'd done, or maybe it was because he knew that they knew he
was yellow. Anyway, they never tried to do him, that job belonging
to Coulon, Honey Grove and the others.</p>

<p>Soupbone cracked that no 'bo could ride his division, and he
made it good, too. He beat them up when they tried it, and he made
it so strong that the old heads wouldn't go against a try when he
was the run. Once in a while some kid took a stab at it, but if he
got caught by Soupbone he regretted it the rest of his life. I've
heard of that little road into Hot Springs, where they say a reward
used to be offered to any 'bo that rode it, and how a guy beat it
by getting in the water-tank; and I've personally met that Wyoming
gent on the Union Pacific, and all them other guys they say is so
tough, but them stories is only fairy-tales for children beside
what could be told about Pew. He went an awful route.</p>

<p>I've known of him catching guys in the pilot and throwing
scalding water in on them; I've heard tell of him shoveling hot
cinders into empties on poor bums laying there asleep. That trick
of dropping a coupling-pin on the end of a wire down alongside a
moving train, so that it would swing up underneath and knock a
stiff off the rods, was about the mildest thing he did.</p>

<p>He was simply a devil. The other railroad men on the division
wouldn't hardly speak to him. They couldn't stand his gaff, but
they couldn't very well roar at him keeping 'boes off his trains
because that was what he was there for.</p>

<p>His longest suit was beating guys up. He just loved to catch
some poor old broken-down bum on his train and pound the
everlasting stuffing out of him. He's sent many a guy to the
hospital, and maybe he killed a few before my acquaintance with
him, for all I know.</p>

<p>Once in a while he ran against some live one &mdash; some real
gun, and not a bum &mdash; who'd given him a battle, but he was
there forty ways with a sap and gat, and he'd shoot as quick as
he'd slug. He didn't go so strong on the real guns, if he knew who
they was, and I guess he was always afraid they might be friends of
Honey Grove or Coulon.</p>

<p>He was on the run when I first heard of him, and some of the
kids of my day would try to pot him from the road, when his train
went by, but they never even come close. I've heard them talking of
pulling a rail on him and letting his train go into the ditch, but
that would have killed the other trainmen, and they was some good
guys on that same run then. The best way to do was to fight shy of
Soupbone, and keep him on ice for Honey Grove and Coulon.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Training with our mob in them days was a young kid called
Manchester Slim &mdash; a real kid, not over eighteen, and as nice
and quiet a youngster as I ever see. He wasn't cut out for the
road. It seems he'd had some trouble at home and run away. Old man
Muller, that Dutch prowler, used to have him on his staff, but he
never let this kid in on any work for some reason. He was always
trying to get Slim to go home.</p>

<p>"Der road is hell for der kits," he used to say. "Let der ole
stiffs vork out dere string, und don't make no new vuns."</p>

<p>The Slim paid no attention to him. Still he had no great love
for the life, and probably would have quit long before if he hadn't
been afraid some one would think he was scared off.</p>

<p>They was a pete job on at La Junta, which me and 'Frisco Shine
and Muller had laid out. We had jungled up &mdash; camped &mdash;
in a little cottonwood grove a few miles out of town, and was
boiling out soup &mdash; nitro-glycerine &mdash; from dynamite, you
know &mdash; and Muller sent the Slim into town to look around a
bit. It was Winter and pretty cold. We had all come in from the
West and was headed East. We was all broke bad, too, and needed
dough the worst way.</p>

<p>Slim come back from town much excited. He was carrying a Denver
newspaper in his hand.</p>

<p>"I've got to go home, Mull," he said, running up to the old man
and holding out the paper. "Look at this ad."</p>

<p>Muller read it and called to me. He showed me a little want ad
reading that Gordon Keleher, who disappeared from his home in
Boston two years before, was wanted at home because his mother was
dying. It was signed Pelias Keleher, and I knew who he was, all
right &mdash; president of the National Bankers' Association.</p>

<p>"Well, you go," I said, right off the reel, and I could see that
was the word he was waiting for.</p>

<p>"For certainly he goes," said Muller. "Nail der next
rattler."</p>

<p>"All the passengers are late, but there's a freight due out of
here tonight; I asked," said Slim.</p>

<p>"How much dough iss dere in dis mob?" demanded Muller, frisking
himself. We all shook ourselves down, but the most we could scare
up was three or four dollars.</p>

<p>"If you could wait until after tonight," I says, thinking of the
job, but Muller broke me off with:</p>

<p>"Ve don't vant him to vait. Somedings might happens."</p>

<p>"I'd wire home for money, but I want to get to Kansas City
first," said Slim. "That paper is a couple of days old, and there's
no telling how long it may have been running that ad. I can stop
over in K.C. long enough to get plenty of dough from some people I
know there. I'm going to grab that freight."</p>

<p>"Soupbone on dat freight," said the 'Frisco Shine, a silent,
wicked black.</p>

<p>"Ve'll see Soub," said Muller quietly. "I guess maybe he von't
inderfere mit dis case."</p>

<p>We decided to abandon the job for the night, and all went
uptown. The Slim was apparently very much worried, and he kept
telling us that if he didn't get home in time he'd never forgive
himself, so we all got dead-set on seeing him started.</p>

<p>We looked up the conductor of the freight due out that night and
explained things to him. None of us knew him, but he was a nice
fellow.</p>

<p>"I tell you, boys," he said, "I'd let the young fellow ride, but
you'd better see my head brakeman, Soupbone Pew. He's a tough
customer, but in a case like this he ought to be all right. I'll
speak to him myself."</p>

<p>Muller went after Pew. He found him in a saloon, drinking all by
his lonesome, although there was a crowd of other railroad men in
there at the time. Muller knew Pew in the old days, but there was
no sign of recognition between them. The old Dutchman explained to
Pew very briefly, winding with:</p>

<p>"It vould pe a gread personal favor mit me, Soub; maype
somedimes I return it."</p>

<p>"He can't ride my train!" said Pew shortly. "That's flat. No
argument goes."</p>

<p>The Dutchman looked at him long and earnestly, murder showing in
his eyes, and Pew slunk back close to the bar, and his hand dropped
to his hip.</p>

<p>"Soub, der poy rides!" said Muller, his voice low but shaking
with anger. "He rides your rattler. Und if anyding happens by dot
poy, de Honey Grove Kit von't get no chance at you! Dot all,
Soub!"</p>

<p>But when he returned to us, he was plainly afraid for the
Slim.</p>

<p>"You don't bedder go to-nid," he said. "Dot Soub is a defil, und
he'll do you."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," said Slim. "He can't find me, anyhow."</p>

<p>The old man tried to talk him out of the idea, but Slim was
determined, and finally Muller, in admiration of his spirit,
said:</p>

<p>"Vell, if you vill go, you vill. Vun man can hide besser as two,
but der Shine must go mit you as far as Dodge."</p>

<p>That was the only arrangement he would consent to, and while the
Slim didn't want the Shine, and I myself couldn't see what good he
could do, Muller insisted so strong that we all gave in.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>We went down to the yards that night to see them off, and the
old man had a private confab with the Shine. The only time I ever
saw Muller show any feeling was when he told the boy good-bye. I
guess he really liked him.</p>

<p>The two hid back of a pile of ties, a place where the trains
slowed down, and me and Muller got off a distance and watched them.
We could see Soupbone standing on top of a box-car as the train
went by, and he looked like a tall devil. He was trying to watch
both sides of the train at the same time, but I didn't think he saw
either Slim or the Shine as they shot underneath the cars, one
after the other, and nailed the rods. Then the train went off into
the darkness, Soupbone standing up straight and stiff.</p>

<p>We went back to our camp to sleep, and the next morning before
we were awake, the Shine came limping in, covered with blood and
one arm hanging at his side.</p>

<p>I didn't have to hear his story to guess what had happened.
Soupbone made them at the first stop. He hadn't expected two, but
he did look for the kid. Instead of warning him off, he told him to
get on top where he'd be safe. That was one of his old tricks. He
didn't get to the Shine, who dodged off into the darkness, as soon
as he found they were grabbed, and then caught the train after it
started again. He crawled up between the cars to the deck, to tip
the Slim off to watch out for Soupbone. Slim didn't suspect
anything, and was thanking Soupbone, and explaining about his
mother.</p>

<p>The moment the train got under way good, Soupbone says:</p>

<p>"Now my pretty boy, you're such a &mdash; &mdash; good traveler,
let's see you jump off this train!"</p>

<p>The kid thought he was joshing, but there wasn't no josh about
it. Soup pulled a gun. The Shine, with his own gun in hand, crawled
clear on top and lay flat on the cars, trying to steady his aim on
Soupbone. The kid was pleading and almost crying, when Soupbone
suddenly jumped at him, smashed him in the jaw with the gun-barrel,
and knocked him off the train. The Shine shot Soupbone in the back,
and he dropped on top of the train, but didn't roll off. As the
Shine was going down between the cars again, Souphone shot at him
and broke his arm. He got off all right, and went back down the
road to find the kid dead &mdash; his neck broke.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Old man Muller, the mildest man in the world generally, almost
went bug-house when he heard that spiel. He raved and tore around
like a sure enough nut. I've known him to go backing out of a town
with every man in his mob down on the ground, dead or dying, and
not show half as much feeling afterward. You'd 'a' thought the kid
was his own. He swore he'd do nothing else as long as he lived
until he'd cut Soupbone's heart out.</p>

<p>The Shine had to get out of sight, because Soupbone would
undoubtedly have some wild-eyed story to tell about being attacked
by hoboes and being shot by one. We had no hope but what the Shine
had killed him.</p>

<p>Old man Muller went into town and found out that was just what
had happened, and he was in the hospital only hurt a little. He
also found they'd brought Slim's body to town, and that most people
suspected the real truth, too. He told them just how it was,
especially the railroad men, and said the Shine had got out of the
country. He also wired Slim's people, and we heard afterward they
sent a special train after the remains.</p>

<p>Muller was told, too, that the train conductor had notified Pew
to let Slim ride, and that the rest of the train-crew had served
notice on Pew that if he threw the boy off he'd settle with them
for it. And that was just what made Soupbone anxious to get the
kid. It ended his railroad career there, as we found out
afterwards, because he disappeared as soon as he got out of the
hospital.</p>

<p>Meantime me and Muller and the Shine went ahead with that job,
and it failed. Muller and the nigger got grabbed, and I had a tough
time getting away. Just before we broke camp the night before,
however, Muller, who seemed to have a hunch that something was
going to happen, called me and the Shine to him, and said, his
voice solemn:</p>

<p>"I vant you poys to bromise me vun ting," he said. "If I don't
get der chance myself, bromise me dot venefer you find Soubbone
Bew, you vill kill him deat."</p>

<p>And we promised, because we didn't think we would ever be called
on to make good.</p>

<p>Muller got a long jolt for the job; the Shine got a shorter one
and escaped a little bit later on, while I left that part of the
country.</p>

<p>A couple of years later, on a bitter cold night, in a certain
town that I won't name, there was five of us in the sneezer, held
as suspects on a house prowl job that only one of us had anything
to do with &mdash; I ain't mentioning the name of the one, either.
They was me, Kid Mole, the old prize-fighter, a hophead named
Squirt McCue, that you don't know, Jew Friend, a dip, and that same
'Frisco Shine. We were all in the bull-pen with a mixed assortment
of drunks and vags. All kinds of prisoners was put in there over
night. This pokey is downstairs under the police station, not a
million miles from the Missouri River, so if you think hard you can
guess the place. We were walking around kidding the drunks, when a
screw shoved in a long, tall guy who acted like he was drunk or
nutty, and was hardly able to stand.</p>

<p>I took one flash at his map, and I knew him. It was Pew.</p>

<p>He flopped down in a corner as soon as the screw let go his arm.
The Shine rapped to him as quick as I did, and officed Mole and the
rest. They all knew of him, especially the Honey Grove business, as
well as about the Manchester Slim, for word had gone over the
country at the time.</p>

<p>As soon as the screw went upstairs I walked over to the big
stiff, laying all huddled up, and poked him with my foot.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, you big cheese?" I said. He only
mumbled.</p>

<p>"Stand up!" I tells him, but he didn't stir. The Shine and Mole
got hold of him on either side and lifted him to his feet. He was
as limber as a wet bar-towel. Just then we heard the screw coming
downstairs and we got away from Pew. The screw brought in a jag
&mdash; a laughing jag &mdash; a guy with his snoot full of booze
and who laughed like he'd just found a lot of money. He was a
little, thin fellow, two pounds lighter than a straw hat. He
laughed high and shrill, more like a scream than a real laugh, and
the moment the screw opened the door and tossed him in, something
struck me that the laugh was phoney. It didn't sound on the
level.</p>

<p>There wasn't no glad in it. The little guy laid on the floor and
kicked his feet and kept on laughing. Soupbone Pew let out a yell
at the sight of him.</p>

<p>"Don't let him touch me!" he bawled, rolling over against the
wall. "Don't let him near me!"</p>

<p>"Why, you big stiff, you could eat him alive!" I says.</p>

<p>The jag kept on tee-heeing, not looking at us, or at Pew either
for that matter.</p>

<p>"He's nuts," said Jew Friend.</p>

<p>"Shut him off," I told the Shine.</p>

<p>He stepped over and picked the jag up with one hand, held him
out at arm's length, and walloped him on the jaw with his other
hand. The jag went to sleep with a laugh sticking in his throat.
Soupbone still lay against the wall moaning, but he saw that
business all right, and it seemed to help him. The Shine tossed the
jag into a cell. Right after that the screw came down with another
drunk, and I asked him about Pew.</p>

<p>"Who's this boob?" I said. "Is he sick?"</p>
"Him? Oh, he's a good one," said screw. "He only killed his poor
wife &mdash; beat her to death with his two fists, because she
didn't have supper ready on time, or something important. That
ain't his blood on him; that's hers. He's pretty weak, now, hey?
Well, he wasn't so weak a couple of hours ago, the rat! It's the
wickedest murder ever done in this town, and he'll hang sure, if he
ain't lynched beforehand!"

<p>He gave Soupbone a kick as he went out, and Soupbone
groaned.</p>

<p>Said I: "It's got to be done, gents; swing or no swing, this guy
has got to go. Who is it &mdash; me?"</p>

<p>"Me!" said the Shine, stepping forward.</p>

<p>"Me!" said the Jew.</p>

<p>"Me!" chimed in Mole.</p>

<p>"All of us!" said the hophead.</p>

<p>"Stand him up!" I ordered.</p>

<p>The lights had been turned down low, and it was dark and shadowy
in the jail. The only sound was the soft pad-pad of people passing
through the snow on the sidewalks above our heads, the low sizzling
of the water-spout at the sink, and the snores of the drunks, who
were all asleep.</p>

<p>Us five was the only ones awake. The Shine and Mole lifted
Soupbone up, and this time he was not so limp. He seemed to know
that something was doing. His eyes was wide open and staring at
us.</p>

<p>"Pew," I said in a whisper, "do you remember the kid you threw
off your rattler three years ago?"</p>

<p>"And shot me in the arm?" asked Shine.</p>

<p>Pew couldn't turn any whiter, but his eyes rolled back into his
head.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he whispered. "Don't say that. It made me crazy! I'm
crazy now! I was crazy when I killed that little girl tonight. It
was all on account of thinking about him. He comes to see me
often."</p>

<p>"Well, Pew," I said, "a long time back you were elected to die.
I was there when the sentence was passed, and it'd been carried out
a long time ago if you hadn't got away. I guess we'll have to kill
you tonight."</p>

<p>"Don't, boys!" he whined. "I ain't fit to die! Don't hurt
me!"</p>

<p>"Why, you'll swing anyway!" said Friend.</p>

<p>"No! My God, no!" he said. "I was crazy; I'm crazy now, and they
don't hang crazy people!"</p>

<p>I was standing square in front of him. His head had raised a
little as he talked and his jaw was sticking out. I suddenly made a
move with my left hand, as though to slap him, and he showed that
his mind was active enough by dodging, so that it brought his jaw
out further, and he said, "Don't." Then I pulled my right clear
from my knee and took him on the point of the jaw. The Shine and
Mole jumped back. Soupbone didn't fall; he just slid down in a
heap, like his body had melted into his shoes.</p>

<p>We all jumped for him at the same time, but an idea popped into
my head, and I stopped them. Soupbone was knocked out, but he was
coming back fast. You can't kill a guy like that by hitting him.
The jail was lighted by a few incandescent lights, and one of them
was hung on a wire that reached down from the ceiling over the
sink, and had a couple of feet of it coiled up in the middle.
Uncoiled, the light would reach clear to the floor. I pointed to
it, but the bunch didn't get my idea right away. The switch for the
lights was inside the bull-pen, and I turned them off. I had to
work fast for fear the screw upstairs would notice the lights was
out and come down to see what the trouble was. A big arc outside
threw a little glim through the sidewalk grating, so I could see
what I was doing.</p>

<p>I uncoiled the wire and sawed it against the edge of the sink,
close to the lamp, until it came in two. Then I bared the wire back
for a foot. The gang tumbled, and carried Pew over to where the
wire would reach him. I unfastened his collar, looped the naked end
of the wire around his neck and secured it. By this time he was
about come to, but he didn't seem to realize what was going on.</p>

<p>All but me got into their cells and I stepped over and turned
the switch-button just as Pew was struggling to his feet. The
voltage hit him when he was on all fours. He stood straight up,
stiff, like a soldier at salute. There was a strange look on his
face &mdash; a surprised look. Then, as though someone had hit him
from behind, his feet left the floor and he swung straight out to
the length of the wire and it broke against his weight, just as I
snapped off the current. Pew dropped to the floor and curled up
like a big singed spider, and a smell like frying bacon filled the
room.</p>

<p>I went over and felt of his heart. It was still beating, but
very light.</p>

<p>"They ain't enough current," whispered Mole. "We got to do it
some other way."</p>

<p>"Hang him wid de wire," said the Shine.</p>

<p>"Aw &mdash; nix!" spoke up the Jew. "I tell you that makes me
sick &mdash; bumping a guy off that way. Hanging and electricity,
see? That's combining them too much. Let's use the boot."</p>

<p>"It ain't fair, kind-a, that's a fact," whispered McCue. "It's a
little too legal. The boot! Give him the boot!"</p>

<p>The voice of the screw came singing down the stairs:</p>

<p>"Is that big guy awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I shouted back, "we're all awake; he won't let us
sleep."</p>

<p>"Tell him he'd better say his prayers!" yelled the screw. "I
just got word a mob is forming to come and get him!"</p>

<p>"Let him alone," I whispered to the gang. Mole was making a
noose of the wire, and the Shine had hunted up a bucket to stand
Pew on. They drew back and Soupbone lay stretched out on the
floor.</p>

<p>I went over and felt of his heart again. I don't remember
whether I felt any beat or not. I couldn't have said I did, at the
moment, and I couldn't say I didn't. I didn't have time to make
sure, because suddenly there run across the floor something that
looked to me like a shadow, or a big rat. Then the shrill laugh of
that jag rattled through the bull-pen. He slid along half-stooped,
as quick as a streak of light, and before we knew what was doing he
had pounced on Soupbone and had fastened his hands tight around the
neck of the big stiff. He was laughing that crazy laugh all the
time.</p>

<p>"I'll finish him for you!" he squeaked. He fastened his hands
around Soupbone's neck. I kicked the jag in the side of the head as
hard as I could, but it didn't faze him. The bunch laid hold of him
and pulled, but they only dragged Soupbone all over the place.
Finally the jag let go and stood up, and we could see he wasn't no
more drunk than we was. He let loose that laugh once more, and just
as the Shine started the bucket swinging for his head, he said:
"I'm her brother!" Then he went down kicking.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>We went into our cells and crawled into our bunks. Soupbone lay
outside. The Shine pulled the jag into a corner. I tell you true, I
went to sleep right away. I thought the screw would find out when
he brought the next drunk down, but it so happened that there
wasn't no more drunks and I was woke up by a big noise on the
stairs. The door flew open with a bang, and a gang of guys came
down, wild-eyed and yelling. The screw was with them and they had
tight hold of him.</p>

<p>"Keep in, you men!" he bawled to us.</p>

<p>"That's your meat!" he said to the gang, pointing at what had
been Soupbone. The men pounced on him like a lot of hounds on to a
rabbit, and before you could bat an eye they had a rope around
Soupbone's neck and was tearing up the stairs again, dragging him
along.</p>

<p>They must have thought he was asleep; they never noticed that he
didn't move a muscle himself, and they took the person of Soupbone
Pew, or anyways what had been him, outside and hung it over a
telegraph wire.</p>

<p>We saw it there when we was sprung next morning. When the screw
noticed the blood around the bull-pen, he said:</p>

<p>"Holy smoke, they handled him rough!" And he never knew no
different.</p>

<p>If the mob hadn't come &mdash; but the mob did come, and so did
the laughing jag. I left him that morning watching the remains of
Soupbone Pew.</p>

<p>"She was my sister," he said to me.</p>

<p>I don't know for certain whether we killed Soupbone, whether the
jag did it, or whether the mob finished him; but he was dead, and
he ought to have died. Sometimes I wonder a bit about it, but no
ghosts come to me, like I say, so I can't tell.</p>

<p>They's an unmarked grave in the potter's field of this town I
speak of, and once in a while I go there when I'm passing through
and meditate on the sins of Soupbone Pew. But I sleep well of
nights. I done what had to be done, and I close my eyes and I don't
never see Soupbone Pew.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>He turned once more to gazing out of the window.</p>

<p>"Well, what is there about condemned men to make you so
nervous?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I said some condemned men," he replied, still gazing. "Like
this guy next door."</p>

<p>A loud, shrill laugh rang through the corridors.</p>

<p>"He's that same laughing jag," said Chicago Red.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="MY_FATHER" id="MY_FATHER">6. MY FATHER</a>
</h2>

<p>MY father is a Pioneer. Of such an institution, Mr. N. Webster,
who was himself something of a pioneer, says:</p>

<p>"Pioneer. One who goes before, as into the wilderness, preparing
the way for others to follow."</p>
I do not know that this description covers my father's case
accurately &mdash; it sounds more like a word picture of a Frémont
or a Pike, or an irrigation promoter, with little bearing upon a
man who was the playmate of the untamed William Hickok, Mr. B.
Masterson, and such; nevertheless, I have my father's word for it
that he is a Pioneer.

<p>His high-heeled boots have left their imprint upon the old
cattle trails down Abilene and Dodge City way. I can picture in my
mind's eye his small but hardy frame encased in the fringes
fashionable at that day, cleaving a path towards the setting sun as
he hotly pursued the elusive maverick and furrowed the pine bars of
the Red Light and the Pink Dog Cafes of that interesting period
with his hard-earned dollars.</p>

<p>I have a deep reverence for my father as a Pioneer, which is not
shared by my wife Ellen.</p>

<p>She sees only, in that weatherbeaten little figure, an old
gentleman with a tremendous capacity for indenting the cushions in
the Brown Palace Hotel, where he foregathers at night with his
ancient friends and talks in a loud and querulous tone of
voice.</p>

<p>My wife was born in the West at a time when department stores
and nickelodeon theatres had crowded out the picturesque landscape
to make room for a ragged skyline. Her father is not a Pioneer. He
is merely the general superintendent of a railroad and travels in a
private car. Her mother is not a Pioneer, either. She is a society
leader.</p>

<p>Ellen, therefore, is inured to an atmosphere of labour
difficulties and bargain sales, and could hardly be expected to
sense the romance of the sunset trail as personified in a
mild-looking little man with a stringy goatee, who declines to
shake up the furnace on cold days. My father stands in proper awe
of Ellen, and while he may raise his voice in a loud
"I-remember-when" down at the Brown Palace, his tone is low and
well modulated around my house, where he resides.</p>

<p>Understand, Ellen is not a shrew &mdash; far from it. Neither is
she inclined to be peckish. She simply came into the world at a
time when pioneerism had become a sort of misdemeanour, so far as
six-pistols and wild Indians are concerned, and society felt it
best to preserve a respectable silence regarding certain early
days.</p>

<p>Also, my wife &mdash; but this does not go if she hears it
&mdash; is very obtuse when it comes to an appreciation of the
historical value of the notches in my father's gun. I myself know,
from rumour and otherwise, that in his day my father was a man of
parts, and his aim was esteemed along the border.</p>

<p>The Society of Pioneers decided to hold a reunion one summer,
and for the purposes of that gathering they picked the old city of
Trinity. There was method in this selection. The average Pioneer,
like my father, has daughters-in-law and other womenfolk holding
receptions and functions about his family fireside, at which no
account is taken of those hoary harbingers of civilization. Trinity
is well removed from the social trail and is without reserve
regarding the old days.</p>

<p>When my father announced his intention of attending the reunion,
my wife offered no objection.</p>

<p>"Just so you ridiculous old men do your pioneering outside the
city limits, I'll be satisfied," she remarked.</p>

<p>So my father, with patient resignation, packed his suitcase full
of buckskin clothing and other odds and ends, and betook himself to
Trinity, in company with a large number of other old gentlemen
whose voices began to touch the highest pitch in the vocal scale as
soon as the train moved them beyond the zone of home hostility.</p>

<p>When I returned that evening, I found Ellen in quite a state of
mind.</p>

<p>"The Daughters of the Revolution have appointed me a member of a
committee to go to Trinity and assist in dedicating a museum to the
Spanish explorers," she announced. "I am to make a speech."</p>

<p>Personally, I have always felt that the son of a man who fought
at 'Dobe Walls was as good as the great-great-granddaughter of a
family who pitchforked Britons in the Lexington road, but I do not
say so. I never shall, openly.</p>

<p>"Trinity? That's where father has gone," I said.</p>

<p>"Well," Ellen replied tartly, "those foolish old men haven't
anything to do with this museum. This is being done by the
Daughters, and as other members of the committee are taking their
husbands, you can go with me."</p>

<p>"It will be quite a surprise to father to see us," I
suggested.</p>

<p>I do not feel called upon to explain that the dedication of the
museum might have been arranged to coincide with the Pioneer
reunion because of the connecting historical relation of the two
events. I, a scion of the 'Dobe Walls, will never gratuitously
offend any Daughter of the Revolution.</p>

<p>I did not see my father, but I heard of him as soon as I
registered our names at the best hotel in Trinity, and urged the
grizzled man doing duty as clerk to give us good rooms.</p>

<p>"Kivingson, hey?" he remarked, scrutinizing the register.</p>

<p>"Any relation to Bill Kivingson?"</p>

<p>"My father's name is William Kivingson," I replied coldly. My
wife sniffed one of the most disdainful sniffs.</p>

<p>"The son of ole Bill Kivingson can have anything I've got,"
replied the old man. "Me'n' Bill are pards; we useter raise hell
together around Lamar...."</p>

<p>"Jonas, let us go to our rooms," interrupted Ellen
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Yore old man's around town sum'eres," called the clerk, as we
mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>Trinity is a small but enthusiastic town on the old Santa Fe
trail, which preserves many of its old-time traditions and all of
its saloons. It was humming with activity. The business houses and
the streets were hung with bunting and beaming with hospitality,
while grizzled men dotted the landscape freely. It appeared that
there were really two celebrations &mdash; the Pioneers' reunion
and the dedication of the museum, the latter designed by the women
as a sort of antidote for the masculine gathering.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that, as the son of Bill Kivingson, I was a
man of honour in those parts at that particular time. The clerk at
the hotel took care to point me out in my capacity of Bill
Kivingson's offspring; and my hand was cordially shaken by ageing
men with a violence that threatened my physical well-being.</p>

<p>Ellen was busied with the other members of the committee of the
Daughters, arranging the programme for the dedication, and I
wandered about the town. My search was not an exhaustive one, as I
did not care to encroach upon my father's vacation, and, in
addition to my natural feelings, there <i>are</i> some places where
a bank attaché cannot follow even a Pioneer parent.</p>

<p>As I went about, mingling with the queer crowds, I heard strange
and disquieting rumours dealing with the personality and actions of
one whom they called "Still Bill," who appeared to be a character
of some vehemence.</p>

<p>"Still Bill's broke the Faro bank over to the Blue Moose,"
announced an ancient exfrontiersman as he approached a group of
bronzed old men at the hotel office that evening.</p>

<p>"Made 'em turn the box after he took out twenty-six hundred
dollars!"</p>

<p>"That Bill's a grey wolf," replied a tall man with long straight
hair. There was admiration in his tone. "If Still Bill gets to
going good, there will be some fun in this burg!"</p>

<p>"He's eyes-going far enough right now," replied the bearer of
the news. "I mind the time at Trail City when he cleaned out the
whole blame town. It was bustin' the bank started him that time,
too."</p>

<p>"Yes," put in another, "I rec'leck how he stood off the marshal
and the entire pop'lation of Dodge City for two days an'
nights."</p>

<p>"Well," said the messenger, "he's got that ol' cap'n'ball pistol
&mdash; that ole forty-five howitzer &mdash; an' he was tunin' up
some when I left. He useter be able to singe your eyelashes with
that weepon at fifty yards."</p>

<p>At this point a fat, breathless gentleman who aided locomotion
with a manzanita cane, hobbled excitedly into the office.</p>

<p>"He's loose!" panted this latest courier, in a quavering voice.
"Ole Still Bill has done ontied himself! He's raisin' hell and
puttin' a plug under ear over at the Moose! Like as not he'll come
a'-bulgin' down this street pretty quick. I'm goin' home!"</p>

<p>"He useter be a long-winded cuss, too," said someone. "I don't
reckon at his age, he can hold out more'n two days, but I seen the
time when a week wasn't no limit!"</p>

<p>"They's been a-many a-ring-tailed, red-eyed son o' trouble
turned loose in these here parts," quavered the courier. "I seen
'em come and I seen em go, but they's never been no white man could
claw within a foot 'o the neck o' old Bill Kivingson!"</p>

<p>Kivingson! Bill Kivingson! <i>My Father!</i></p>

<p>I approached the group. "Gentlemen," said I, "you surely do not
mean Mr. William Kivingson &mdash; a smallish man with a goatee and
...?"</p>

<p>"Still Bill! That's <i>him!</i>" came in full chorus.</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "it &mdash; it isn't possible that he should be
performing actions such as you speak of! He is a harmless old
man!"</p>

<p>"Harmless-<i>hell</i>!" snorted the fat old Pioneer. "Harmless
like a mess o' rattlesnakes!"</p>

<p>"But I'm his son!" I argued.</p>

<p>"I don't give a hoo-raw who you are! I'm his pal and I
<i>know</i> Still Bill Kivingson &mdash; knowed him before you was
born. It's good night, all, fer me!"</p>

<p>Now of course my natural thought was to go and get my father and
make him retire for the night; but the hotel clerk laid a kind
restraining hand upon my arm.</p>

<p>"Lay off o' him, son," he said. "When Still Bill gits a-goin',
you jest got to give him a clean track and keep well under kivver.
I ain't seen him speed none in twenty years, but I know what he
<i>could</i> do. Jest you go to bed and lay off o' him.</p>

<p>"He won't hurt nobody," he continued. "All the old-timers'll
keep out of his way, and he never did kill no bar-tenders, or such,
in his life, because he needs 'em. Don't you worry about him. It's
just them animile sperrits which has been plugged up fer a long
time, coming out an' sniffin' around. O' course, if he should
happen to think o' somebody he don't like, he might bother 'em
some; but they ain't no one about Trinity he ain't made up with
long ago."</p>

<p>I debated the matter in my mind and came to the conclusion that
I had better follow the clerk's advice. Who was I, that I should
obstruct the course of a hero of the 'Dobe Walls, equipped with a
cap and ball?</p>

<p>I lay awake for several hours, the tumult of the street pouring
in at my window. Occasionally I heard above the hum of voices a
pistol shot, which never failed to produce deep silence &mdash;
after a great shuffling of feet. The pedestrians seemed to be
seeking shelter. In the hush which followed these explosions there
would come a voice, uplifted in warlike declamation. I could not
make out the words, but there seemed to be a familiar ring to the
belligerent chant.</p>

<p>When I went down the stairs the next morning, leaving Ellen at
her toilet, a strange sight presented itself. It was nine o'clock.
Outside, the sun was shining from a turquoise sky, and the air was
soft as down, yet the lobby of the hotel was packed with men and
women who stood gazing through the windows upon that scene of peace
and quiet as if a terrible storm raged without.</p>

<p>Across the street, I could see, the stores were filled with
similar crowds. The streets were deserted. An old man disengaged
himself from the throng and sidled over to me. It was the hotel
clerk.</p>

<p>"Son," said he, "I don't like fer to tell you-all, but yore old
man, Still Bill, he's a-goin' good and strong this mornin'. He's
plum' busted this celebration, which it can't go on with him
a-streamin' up and down the streets like a pestilence. He's
a-holdin' forth down yonder at the Moose, an' every now an' then he
comes a-boilin' up this way to see if they's any defenceless folks
he can devastate. Son, yore dad is a wolf &mdash; a curly wolf,
that's all &mdash; and time don't change him none."</p>

<p>"He certainly is a long-winded ole body," declared another. "I
reckon it's his superfluous energy o' twenty year a-bubbin' out all
to onct. He allows he has decided to postpone the parade an'
celebration until to-morrow and that he ain't goin' to permit no
moosee dedication a-a-a-tall. He ain't decided yet whether he'll
move this town plum' away or not."</p>

<p>At that moment a high treble yell smote the air, and the crowd
stayed back from the windows. I peered outside to see, far down the
street, a small figure rocketing along at amazing speed. Clad in
buckskins, feathered at the hems, a wide hat, it gave the the
appearance of an animated mushroom, and waving a long-barrelled
revolver, my father surged along in a billow of sound. While I
watched, shame-faced, some of his expressions came to my ears.</p>

<p>"I'm a howlin' wolf from ole Mizzou, an' I'm a-huntin' gore!" he
bawled. "I picks my teeth with bowie-knives, an' the bark o'
six-guns is music to my ears! Yee-owo-wow! I'm a snake in the
grass, an' I hiss when you pass, an' I'm searchin' for folks to
eat! Wow!"</p>

<p>He had a clear path, and he swirled along the street for a block
or two, then doubled back and disappeared in a vocal storm.</p>

<p>"Ain't he a bear?" inquired the hotel clerk; and I could see
that among these Pioneers my father's exhibitions, however much it
shamed me, had aroused considerable admiration.</p>

<p>"Has he hurt anybody?" I inquired nervously.</p>

<p>"<i>Hurt</i> 'em, son?" said the hotel clerk. "<i>Hurt</i> 'em?
Boy, they ain't anybody get near enough to old Hell-on-Wheels out
there to let him <i>hurt</i> 'em. He never <i>hurts</i> no one if
he gits 'em. He jest KILLS 'em. An' he ain't bin able for to ketch
no one here."</p>

<p>"Has he been going all night long?"</p>

<p>"All night," replied the clerk. "He ain't paused for drink for
man or beast to date. An' bimeby we're goin' to set a bear trap out
there in the street so business can proceed. Sim Leggins has gone
after the trap now. Sim is the authorities, an' a pussonal friend
o' yer dad's, but he's decided Still Bill has got his twenty years'
worth."</p>

<p>Beyond the shadow of a doubt I should shortly have nerved myself
to going after my father &mdash; there is no question in my mind
but that I should have done it; but while I was steeling myself, my
wife appeared &mdash; my wife, the immaculate Ellen, appeared in
the crowded lobby, clad in a Japanese kimono, her hair in
curl-papers.</p>

<p>"What is this I hear?" she demanded. "The members of my
committee tell me that our dedication is being postponed by some
beast of a man &mdash; what does this mean?"</p>

<p>I had not the heart to tell her that it was my father. I could
never have found the heart to do so. But at that moment he
disclosed his identity by reappearing in the street &mdash; gun in
hand and a yell in his throat.</p>

<p>Again he careened past the hotel, the crowd falling back
dismayed &mdash; and as I stood there, the picture of
embarrassment, if nothing more, my wife edged close to the window
and stared.</p>

<p>"Come back, Ellen, dear," I said. "They say he's very dangerous
to people he does not like."</p>

<p>That was an unfortunate slip. I had never before suggested that
my father did not like my wife &mdash; certainly he bad never
intimated such a thing.</p>

<p>"Yee-ow-wow!" yelled my father, as he swung back towards his
Blue Moose retreat and disappeared.</p>

<p>My wife hurriedly left the hotel in a flutter of Japanese
colouring, and with a toss of bedroom headgear. The crowd gasped.
She was heading straight for the door of the Blue Moose. I followed
&mdash; I have never permitted my wife to go where I do not go
myself &mdash; and the crowd tailed along, nervously.</p>

<p>At the door of the Blue Moose saloon I paused, my heart beating
with grave concern.</p>

<p>Imagine my feelings! My beloved wife, unappreciative of the
danger attached to an eruption of twenty years of repressed
pioneerial fervour, mindful only of the jeopardy of social
standing, had flung herself headlong into the arms of Peril.</p>

<p>And my beloved father was Peril!</p>

<p>About me pressed the faces of the people, grey with
apprehension, each head bent towards the door of the Blue Moose in
a listening attitude.</p>

<p>Shortly I should have plunged through those doors regardless of
consequences; shortly I should have rushed to my obvious duty.</p>

<p>From the interior of the Blue Moose arose a voice &mdash; a
woman's voice &mdash; the voice of Ellen, my wife.</p>

<p>The door suddenly flew open with a bang, scattering the crowd
like frightened sheep. My wife appeared. In one hand she held a
long cap-and-ball revolver. In the other she clasped the left ear
of a meek old gentleman, who was very white as to face, and who
rubbed his hands together nervously.</p>

<p>"At your time of life, too!" my wife was saying. "You ought to
be ashamed of yourself, you silly old man!"</p>

<p>The crowd collected itself again, amazed, startled.</p>

<p>"Now, Elly &mdash;" quavered my father.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she ordered, in tones such as I never wish to hear
again. "Not another word, you ridiculous old man!"</p>

<p>And up the street, now teeming with an astounded multitude, she
led the resentless howl wolf and snake in the grass, while I, who
seemed destined always to be in the rear of the procession,
followed, still harassed by emotion.</p>

<p>"I'm going to lock you up in a closet until the next train
leaves," my wife was saying. "You &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't lose my gun, Elly," my father exhorted humbly.</p>

<p>"It's the one with notches on it."</p>

<p>A little boy, perhaps ten years of age, was running along beside
them, whooping shrilly.</p>

<p>"Here, boy!" said Ellen, pushing the famous revolver into the
youngster's hands. "Here's a nice plaything for you!"</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>"And now, ladies and gentlemen," said my wife, in closing her
brief remarks at the dedication of the museum, "it is with a
feeling of deepest reverence towards the wonderful men of that
early period, and to those equally wonderful men who came at a
later day to develop and perpetuate the path of progress that we
dedicate this small monument in the hope that it will ever keep
green the memory of the Spanish explorers and the American
Pioneer!"</p>

<p>I have a high regard for my father as a Pioneer, which is not
shared by my wife, Ellen.</p>

<h1><i>Stories à la Carte</i>
</h1>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="MONEY_FROM_HOME" id="MONEY_FROM_HOME">7. MONEY FROM
HOME</a>
</h2>

<p>IT comes on a pleasant morning in the city of Baltimore, Md.,
and a number of citizens are standing in front of the Cornflower
Hotel in Calvert Street, speaking of this and that, and one thing
and another, and especially of the horse races that are to take
place in the afternoon at Pimlico, because these citizens are all
deeply interested in horse races, and in fact they are not
interested in much of anything else in this world.</p>

<p>Among these citizens is The Seldom Seen Kid, who is called The
Seldom Seen because he is seldom seen after anything comes off that
anybody may wish to see him about, as he has a most retiring
disposition, although he can talk a blue streak whenever talking
becomes really necessary. He is a young guy of maybe twenty-five
years of age, and he always chucks a good front, and has a kind
face that causes people to trust him implicitly.</p>

<p>Then there is Hot Horse Herbie, who is called Hot Horse Herbie
because he generally knows about some horse that is supposed to be
hotter than a base-burner, a hot horse being a horse that is all
heated up to win a horse race, although sometimes Hot Horse
Herbie's hot horses turn out to be as cold as a landlord's heart.
And there is also Big Reds, who is known to one and all as an
excellent handicapper if his figures are working right.</p>

<p>Now these are highly respected characters, and if you ask them
what they do, they will tell you that they are turf advisers, a
turf adviser being a party who advises the public about horse
races, and their services are sometimes quite valuable, even if the
coppers at the race-tracks do say that turf advisers are nothing
but touts, and are always jerking them around, and sometimes going
so far as to bar them off the tracks altogether, which is a grave
injustice, as it deprives many worthy citizens of a chance to earn
a livelihood.</p>

<p>In fact, the attitude of these coppers is so odious towards turf
advisers that there is some talk of organizing a National Turf
Advisers' Association, for mutual protection, and bringing the
names of the coppers up at the meetings and booing them for ten
minutes each.</p>

<p>There is another guy standing in front of the Cornflower Hotel
with The Seldom Seen Kid and Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds, and
this guy is a little, dark complected, slippery-looking guy by the
name of Philly the Weeper, and he is called by this name because he
is always weeping about something, no matter what. In fact, Philly
the Weeper is such a guy as will go around with a loaf of bread
under his arm weeping because he is hungry.</p>

<p>He is generally regarded as a most unscrupulous sort of guy, and
in fact some people claim Philly the Weeper is downright dishonest,
and ordinarily The Seldom Seen Kid, and Hot Horse Herbie and Big
Reds do not associate with parties of this calibre, but of course
they cannot keep Philly the Weeper from standing around in front of
the Cornflower Hotel with them, because he resides there the same
as they do.</p>

<p>In fact, Philly the Weeper is responsible at this time for The
Seldom Seen Kid, and Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds being able to
continue residing in the Cornflower, as conditions are very bad
with them, what with so few of the public being willing to take
their advice about the horse races, and the advice turning out the
wrong way even when the public takes it, and they are all in the
hotel stakes, and the chances are the management will be putting
hickeys in their keyholes if it is not for Philly the Weeper
okaying them.</p>

<p>The reason Philly the Weeper is able to okay them is because a
musical show by the name of "P's and Q's" is trying out in
Baltimore, and Philly the Weeper's fiancée, Miss Lola Ledare, is a
prominent member of the chorus, and the company is stopping at the
Cornflower Hotel, and Philly the Weeper lets on that he has
something to do with them being there, so he stands first-class
with the hotel management, which does not think to ask anybody
connected with the "P's and Q's" company about the matter.</p>

<p>If the hotel management does ask, the chances are it will find
out that the company regard Philly the Weeper as a wrong gee, the
same as everybody else, although it thinks well of his fiancée,
Miss Lola Ledare, who is one of these large, wholesome blondes, and
by no means bad-looking, if you like them blonde. She is Philly the
Weeper's fiancée for several years, but nobody holds this against
her, as it is well known to one and all that love is something that
cannot be explained, and, anyway, Miss Lola Ledare does not seem to
let it bother her very much.</p>

<p>She is such a doll as enjoys going around and about, being
young, and full of vitality, as well as blonde, and if Philly the
Weeper is too busy, or does not have enough dough to take her
around and about, Miss Lola Ledare always seems able to find
somebody else who has a little leisure time on their hands for such
a purpose, and if Philly the Weeper does not like it, he can lump
it, and usually he lumps it, for Miss Lola Ledare can be very, very
firm when it comes to going around and about.</p>

<p>In fact, Philly the Weeper is telling The Seldom Seen Kid and
Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds, the very morning in question, about
Miss Lola Ledare and nine other members of the "P's and Q's"
company being around and about the night before with an English guy
who checks in at the Cornflower early in the evening, and who is in
action in the matter of going around and about before anybody can
say Jack Robinson.</p>

<p>"He is a young guy," Philly the Weeper says, "and from what Lola
tells me, he is a very fast guy with a dollar. His name is the
Honourable Bertie Searles, and he has a valet, and enough luggage
to sink a barge. Lola says he takes quite a fancy to her, but,"
Philly the Weeper says, "every guy Lola meets takes quite a fancy
to her, to hear her tell it."</p>

<p>Well, nobody is much interested in the adventures of Miss Lola
Ledare, or any of the other members of the "P's and Q's" company,
but when Philly the Weeper mentions the name of the English guy,
The Seldom Seen Kid, who is reading the sport page of the
<i>News</i>, looks up and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"Why," he says, "there is a story about the Honourable Searles
right here in this paper. He is the greatest amateur steeplechase
rider in England, and he is over here to ride his own horse,
Trafalgar, in some of our steeplechase races, including the Gold
Vase at Belmont next week. It says here they are giving a fox hunt
and a big dinner in his honour to-day at the Oriole Hunts
Club."</p>

<p>Then he hands the <i>News</i> to Philly the Weeper, and Philly
the Weeper reads the story himself, and says like this:</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "from what Lola tells me of the guy's condition
when they get him back to the hotel about six bells this a.m., they
will have to take him to the Oriole Hunts Club unconscious. He may
be a great hand at kicking them over the sticks, but I judge he is
also quite a rum-pot."</p>

<p>"Anyway," Hot Horse Herbie says, "he is wasting his time riding
anything in the Gold Vase. Personally," he says, "I do not care for
amateur steeplechase riders, because I meet up with several in my
time who have more larceny in them than San Quentin. They call them
gentleman riders, but many of them cannot even spell gentleman. I
will take Follow You and that ziggaboo jock of his in the Gold Vase
for mine against any horse and any amateur rider in the world,
including Marsh Preston's Sweep Forward."</p>

<p>"Yes," Big Reds says, "if there is any jumper alive that can
lick Follow You, with the coon up, I will stand on my head in front
of Mindy's restaurant on Broadway for twenty-four hours hand
running, and I do not like standing on my head. Any time they go to
the post," Big Reds says, "they are just the same as money from
home."</p>

<p>Well, of course it is well known to one and all that what Hot
Horse Herbie and Big Reds say about Follow You in the Gold Vase is
very true, because this Follow You is a Maryland horse that is a
wonderful jumper, and furthermore he is a very popular horse
because he is owned by a young Maryland doll by the name of Miss
Phyllis Richie, who comes of an old family on the Eastern
Shore.</p>

<p>It is such an old family as once has plenty of dough, and many
great race horses, but by the time the family gets down to Miss
Phyllis Richie, the dough is all gone, and about all that is left
is a house with a leaky roof on the Tred Avon River, and this
horse, Follow You, and a coon by the name of Roy Snakes, who always
rides the horse, and everybody in Maryland knows that Follow You
supports Miss Phyllis Richie and her mother and the house with the
leaky roof by winning jumping races here and there.</p>

<p>In fact, all this is quite a famous story of the Maryland turf,
and nobody is violating any secrets or poking their nose into
private family affairs in speaking of it, and any time Follow You
walks out on a race-track in Maryland with Roy Snakes on his back
in the red and white colours of the Richie stable, the band always
plays "My Maryland", and the whole State of Maryland gets up and
yells.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, jumping races do not interest such characters as
The Seldom Seen Kid and Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds, or even
Philly the Weeper, very much, so they get to talking about
something else, when all of a sudden down the street comes a
spectacle that is considered most surprising.</p>

<p>It consists of a young guy who is dressed up in a costume such
as is worn by fox hunters when they are out chasing foxes,
including a pink coat, and tight pants, and boots, and a peaked
cap, and moreover, the guy is carrying a whip in one hand, and a
horn in the other, and every now and then he puts his horn to his
mouth and goes ta-ta-tee-ta-ta-tee-ta-dah.</p>

<p>But this is not as surprising as the fact that behind the guy
are maybe a dozen dogs of one kind and another, such as a
dachshund, a Boston bull terrier, a Scottie, a couple of fox
hounds, and a lot of just plain every-day dogs, and they are
yipping, and making quite a fuss about the guy in the costume, and
the reason is that between ta-ta-dees he tucks his horn under one
arm and reaches into a side pocket of his pink coat, and takes out
some little brown crackers, which he chucks to the dogs.</p>

<p>Well, the first idea anybody is bound to have about a guy going
around in such an outfit baiting dogs to follow him, is that he is
slightly daffy, and this is the idea The Seldom Seen Kid, and Hot
Horse Herbie, and Big Reds, and Philly the Weeper have as they
watch the guy, until he turns around to chide a dog that is
nibbling at the seat of his tight pants, and they see that the guy
has a sign on his back that reads as follows:</p>

<center>"BARKER'S DOG CRULLERS"</center>

<p>Then of course they know the guy is only up to an advertising
dodge, and Hot Horse Herbie laughs right out loud, and says like
this:</p>

<p>"Well," Herbie says, "I will certainly have to be in tough shape
to take such a job as this, especially for a guy like old Barker. I
know him well," Herbie says. "He has a factory down here on Lombard
Street, and he likes to play the horses now and then, but he is the
toughest, meanest old guy in Maryland, and will just as soon bat
your brains out as not. In fact, he is thinking some of batting my
brains out one day at Laurel last year when I lay him on the wrong
horse. But," Herbie says, "they tell me he makes a wonderful dog
cruller, at that, and he is certainly a great hand for
advertising."</p>

<p>By this time, the young guy in the fox hunter's costume is in
front of the hotel with his dogs, and nothing will do but The
Seldom Seen Kid must stop him, and speak to him.</p>

<p>"Hello," The Seldom Seen Kid says, "where is your horse?"</p>

<p>Well, the young guy seems greatly surprised at being accosted in
this manner by a stranger, and he looks at The Seldom Seen Kid for
quite a spell, as if he is trying to figure out where he sees him
before, and finally he says like this:</p>

<p>"Why," the young guy says, "it is very strange that you ask me
such a question, as I not only do not have a horse, but I hate
horses. I am afraid of horses since infancy. In fact," he says,
"one reason I leave my home town is because my father wishes me to
give up my musical career and drive the delivery waggon for his
grocery-store, although he knows how I loathe and despise
horses."</p>

<p>Now, of course, The Seldom Seen Kid is only joking when be asks
the young guy about his horse, and does not expect to get all this
information, but the young guy seems so friendly, and so innocent,
that The Seldom Seen Kid keeps talking to him, although the dogs
bother the young guy quite some, while he is standing there, by
trying to climb up his legs, and he has to keep feeding them the
little brown crackers out of his pocket, and it seems that these
crackers are Barker's Dog Crullers, and Hot Horse Herbie personally
tries several and pronounces them most nutritious.</p>

<p>The young guy says his name is Eddie Yokum, and he comes from a
town in Delaware that is called Milburn, and another reason he
comes to Baltimore besides wishing to avoid contact with horses is
that he reads in a paper that the "P's and Q's" company is there,
and he wishes to get a position with the show, because it seems
that back in Milburn he is considered quite an excellent singer,
and he takes a star part in the Elks' minstrel show in the winter
of 1933, and even his mother says it will be a sin and a shame to
waste such talent on a delivery waggon, especially by a guy who can
scarcely bear the sight of a horse.</p>

<p>Well, Eddie Yokum then starts telling The Seldom Seen Kid all
about the Elks' minstrel show, and how he gives imitations of Eddie
Cantor and Al Jolson in black face; and in fact he gives these
imitations for The Seldom Seen right then and there, and both are
exactly alike, except of course Eddie Yokum is not in black face,
and The Seldom Seen Kid confesses the imitations are really
wonderful, and Eddie Yokum says he thinks so, too, especially when
you consider he never even sees Eddie Cantor or Al Jolson.</p>

<p>He offers to render a song by the name of "Silver Threads Among
the Gold," which it seems is the song he renders in the Elks'
minstrels in Milburn, while imitating Eddie Cantor and Al Jolson,
but Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds tell The Seldom Seen Kid that
this will be going too far, and he agrees with them, although Eddie
Yokum seems greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>He is a very nice-looking young guy, with big round eyes, and a
pleasant smile, but he is so innocent that it is really surprising
to think he can walk around Baltimore, Md., safe and sound, even
made up as a fox hunter.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that when Eddie Yokum arrives in Baltimore, Md.,
from Milburn, he goes around to the theatre where the "P's and Q's"
company is playing to see about getting a position with the show,
but nobody wishes to listen to him, and in fact the stage doorman
finally speaks very crossly to Eddie, and tells him that if he does
not desire a bust in the beezer, he will go away from there. So
Eddie goes away, as he does not desire a bust in the beezer.</p>

<p>By and by he has a great wish to eat food, and as he is now all
out of money, there is nothing for him to do but go to work, so he
gets this job with Barker's Dog Crullers, and here he is.</p>

<p>"But," Eddie Yokum says, "I hesitate at taking it at first
because I judge from the wardrobe that a horse goes with it, but
Mr. Barker says if I think he is going to throw in a horse after
spending a lot of money on this outfit, I am out of my head, and in
fact Mr. Barker tells me not to walk fast, so as not to wear out
these boots too soon. I am commencing to suspect that Mr. Barker is
a trifle near."</p>

<p>By this time, no one except The Seldom Seen Kid is paying much
attention to Eddie Yokum, as anybody can see that he is inclined to
be somewhat gabby, and quite a bore, and anyway there cannot
possibly be any percentage in talking to such a guy.</p>

<p>Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds are chatting with each other, and
Philly the Weeper is reading the paper, while Eddie Yokum goes
right along doing a barber, and the dogs are still climbing up his
legs after the Barker's Dog Crullers, when all of a sudden Philly
the Weeper looks at the dogs, and speaks to Eddie Yokum in a most
severe tone of voice as follows:</p>

<p>"See here, young fellow," Philly says, "where do you get the two
fox hounds you have with you? I just notice them, and I will thank
you to answer me promptly, and without quibbling."</p>

<p>Well, it seems from what Eddie Yokum says that he does not get
the fox hounds anywhere in particular, but that they just up and
follow him as he goes along the street. He explains that the Boston
bull, the dachshund, and the Scottie are what you might call
stooges, because they belong to Mr. Barker personally, and Eddie
has to see that they get back to the factory with him every day,
but all the other dogs are strays that join out with him here and
there on account of the crullers, and he shoos them away when his
day's work is done.</p>

<p>"To tell the truth," Eddie Yokum says, "I am always somewhat
embarrassed to have so many dogs following me, but Mr. Barker
sometimes trails me in person, and if I do not have a goodly throng
of dogs in my wake eagerly partaking of Barker's Dog Crullers, he
is apt to become very peevish. But," Eddie says, "I consider these
fox hounds a great feather in my cap, because they are so
appropriate to my costume, and I am sure that Mr. Barker will be
much pleased when he sees them. In fact, he may raise my salary,
which will be very pleasant, indeed."</p>

<p>"Well," Philly the Weeper says, "your story sounds very fishy to
me. These fox hounds undoubtedly belong to my old friend, Mr.
Prendergast, and how am I to know that you do not steal them from
his country place? In fact, now that I look at you closely, I can
see that you are such a guy as is apt to sneeze a dog any time, and
for two cents I will call a cop and give you in charge."</p>

<p>He is gazing at Eddie Yokum most severely, and at this crack
about his friend Mr. Prendergast, and a country place, The Seldom
Seen Kid reaches over and takes the newspaper out of Philly the
Weeper's hands, because he knows Philly has no friend by the name
of Mr. Prendergast, and that even if he does have such a friend,
Mr. Prendergast has no more country place than a jay-bird, but he
can see that Philly has something on his mind, and right away The
Seldom Seen Kid raps to what it is, because there in the paper in
black type is an advertisement that reads as follows:</p>

<p>"LOST, STRAYED, OR STOLEN. TWO LIVER-AND-WHITE FOX HOUNDS
ANSWERING TO THE NAMES OF NIP AND TUCK. $200 REWARD AND NO
QUESTIONS ASKED IF RETURNED TO THE ORIOLE HUNTS CLUB."</p>

<p>Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds read the advertisement over The
Seldom Seen Kid's shoulder, and each makes a lunge at a fox hound,
Hot Horse Herbie grabbing one around the neck, and Big Reds snaring
the other by the hind legs; and this unexpected action causes some
astonishment and alarm among the other dogs, and also frightens
Eddie Yokum no little, especially as The Seldom Seen Kid joins
Philly the Weeper in gazing at Eddie very severely, and The Seldom
Seen Kid speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"Yes," he says, "this is a most suspicious case. There is only
one thing to do with a party who stoops so low as to steal a dog,
and especially two dogs, and that is to clap him in the clink."</p>

<p>Now of course The Seldom Seen Kid has no idea whatever of
clapping anybody in the clink, because as a matter of fact he is
greatly opposed to clinks, and if he has his way about it, they
will all be torn down and thrown away, but he figures that it is
just as well to toss a good scare into Eddie Yokum and get rid of
him before Eddie discovers what this interest in the fox hounds is
all about, as The Seldom Seen Kid feels that if there is any reward
money to be cut up, it is best not to spread it around any more
than is necessary.</p>

<p>Well, by this time, Eddie Yokum has a very good scare in him,
indeed, and he is backing away an inch or two at a time from The
Seldom Seen Kid and Philly the Weeper, while Hot Horse Herbie and
Big Reds are struggling with the fox hounds, and just about holding
their own, when who comes walking up very briskly but a
plain-clothes copper by the name of Detective Wilbert Schmalz,
because it seems that the manager of the Cornflower Hotel gets sick
and tired of the dogs out in front of his joint, and telephones to
the nearest station-house and wishes to know if there is no
justice.</p>

<p>So the station-house gets hold of Detective Wilbert Schmalz and
tells him to see about this proposition; and here he is, and
naturally Detective Schmalz can see by Eddie Yokum's costume and by
the dogs around him that he is undoubtedly very unlawful, and as he
comes walking up Detective Schmalz speaks to Eddie Yokum as
follows: "Come with me," he says. "You are under arrest."</p>

<p>Now what Eddie Yokum thinks he is under arrest for is stealing
the fox hounds, and by the time Detective Schmalz gets close to
him, Eddie Yokum is near one of the two entrances to the Cornflower
Hotel that open on Calvert Street, and both of these entrances have
revolving doors.</p>

<p>So all of a sudden, Eddie Yokum makes a jump into one of these
entrances, and at the same time Detective Schmalz makes a grab for
him, as Detective Schmalz can see by Eddie Yokum's attempt to
escape that he is undoubtedly a very great malefactor, but all
Detective Schmalz gets is the sign off Eddie's back that reads
"Barker's Dog Crullers."</p>

<p>Then Detective Schmalz finds himself tangled up in the revolving
door with the dachshund, which is trying to follow Eddie Yokum, and
crying in a way that will break your heart, while Eddie is dashing
out the other entrance, and there is a great confusion all around
and about, with Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds using language to the
fox hounds that is by no means meant for publication.</p>

<p>In fact, there is so much confusion that very few people notice
that as Eddie Yokum pops out the other entrance and heads for the
middle of the street where he will have plenty of racing room, a
big, shiny town car with a chauffeur and a footman pulls up at the
kerb in front of the hotel, and the footman leaps off the seat and
yanks open the door of the car right under Eddie Yokum's nose, and
the next thing anybody knows, Eddie is inside the town car, and the
car is tearing down the street.</p>

<p>Afterwards Eddie Yokum remembers hearing the footman mumble
something about being sorry, they are late, but Eddie is too
bewildered by his strange experience, and too happy to escape the
law, to think of much of anything else for a while, and it does not
come to him that he must be mistaken for somebody else until the
town car is rolling up the driveway of the Oriole Hunts Club, a few
miles out of Baltimore, and he sees a raft of guys and dolls
strolling around and about, with the guys dressed up as fox
hunters, just the same way he is.</p>

<p>Now, of course the guy Eddie Yokum is mistaken for is nobody but
the Honourable Bertie Searles, who at this time is pounding his ear
back in the Cornflower Hotel, and the chances are glad of it, but
nobody can scarcely blame the chauffeur and the footman for the
mistake when they see a guy dressed up as a fox hunter come
bouncing out of a hotel, where they are sent to pick up an English
gentleman rider, because anybody is apt to look like an Englishman,
and a gentleman, too, if they are dressed up as a fox hunter.</p>

<p>Naturally, Eddie Yokum knows that a mistake is going on the
minute he gets out of the car and finds himself surrounded by guys
and dolls all calling him the Honourable Bertie Searles, and he
realizes that there is nothing for him to do but to explain and
apologize, and get away from there as quick as he can, and the
chances are he will do this at once, as Eddie Yokum is really an
honest, upright young guy, but before he can say a word, what does
he see on the clubhouse veranda in riding clothes but the most
beautiful doll he ever claps eyes on in his whole life.</p>

<p>In fact, this doll is so beautiful that Eddie Yokum is
practically tongue-tied at once, and when she is introduced to him
as Miss Phyllis Richie, he does not care what happens if he can
only hang around here a little while, for this is undoubtedly love
at first sight as far as Eddie Yokum is concerned, and Miss Phyllis
Richie is by no means displeased with him, either, although she
remarks that he is the first Englishman she ever sees who does not
have an English accent.</p>

<p>So Eddie Yokum says to himself he will just keep his trap closed
until the real Honourable Bertie Searles bobs up, or somebody who
knows the real Honourable Bertie Searles comes around, and enjoy
the sunshine of Miss Phyllis Richie's smile as long as possible;
and to show you what a break he gets, it seems that nobody in the
club ever sees the Honourable Bertie Searles in person, and they
are all too busy getting the fox hunt in his honour going to bother
to ask Eddie any questions that he cannot answer yes or no.</p>

<p>Anyway, Eddie Yokum keeps so close to Miss Phyllis Richie that
nobody has much chance to talk to her, although a tall young guy
with a little moustache and a mean look keeps trying, and Miss
Phyllis Richie explains that this guy is nobody but Mr. Marshall
Preston, who is as great an amateur rider in America as the
Honourable Bertie Searle himself is in England.</p>

<p>Furthermore, she explains that Mr. Marshall Preston is the owner
of a horse by the name of Sweep Forward, that is the only horse in
this country that figures a chance to beat her horse, Follow You,
in the Gold Vase, unless maybe the Honourable Bertie Searles'
horse, Trafalgar, is an extra-good horse.</p>

<p>Then she commences asking Eddie Yokum about his horse,
Trafalgar, and of course Eddie not only does not know he has such a
horse, but he hates just even talking about horses, and he has
quite a time switching the conversation, because Miss Phyllis
Richie seems bound and determined to talk about horses, and
especially her horse.</p>

<p>"I am only sorry," Miss Phyllis Richie says, "that it is not
possible to let you ride Follow You over a course, just so you can
see what a wonderful horse he is, but," she says, "it is a
well-known peculiarity of his that he will not permit any one to
ride him except a coloured boy, not even myself. In fact, several
times we try to put white riders on Follow You, and he half kills
them. It is most unfortunate, because you will really appreciate
him."</p>

<p>Well, naturally Eddie Yokum does not consider this unfortunate
by any means, as the last thing in the world he wishes to do is to
ride a horse, but of course he does not mention the matter to Miss
Phyllis Richie, as he can see that a guy who does not wish to ride
horses is not apt to get to first base with her.</p>

<p>What bothers Eddie Yokum more than somewhat, however, is the way
this Mr. Marshall Preston keeps scowling at him, and finally he
asks Miss Phyllis Richie if she can figure out what is eating the
guy, and Miss Phyllis Richie laughs heartily, and says like
this:</p>

<p>"Oh," she says, "Mr. Marshall Preston seems to have an idea that
he loves me, and wishes to marry me. He hates anybody that comes
near me. He hates my poor horse, Follow You, because he thinks if
it is not for Follow You coming along and winning enough money to
support us, I will have to marry him out of sheer poverty.</p>

<p>"But," Miss Phyllis Richie says, "I do not love Mr. Marshall
Preston, and I will never marry except for love, and while things
are not so good with us right now, everything will be all right
after Follow You wins the Gold Vase, because it is a $25,000 stake.
But no matter what happens, I do not think I will ever marry Mr.
Marshall Preston, as he is very wild in his ways, and is unkind to
horses."</p>

<p>Well, this last is really a boost for Mr. Marshall Preston with
Eddie Yokum, but naturally he does not so state to Miss Phyllis
Richie, and in fact he says that now he takes a second peek at Mr.
Marshall Preston he can see that he may be a wrong gee in more ways
than one, and that Miss Phyllis Richie is quite right in playing
the chill for such a guy.</p>

<p>Now there is a great commotion about the premises, with guys
coming up leading horses, and a big pack of fox hounds yapping
around, and it seems that the fox hunt in honour of the Honourable
Bertie Searles is ready to start, and Eddie Yokum is greatly
horrified when he realizes that he is expected to take part in the
fox hunt, and ride a horse, and in fact Miss Phyllis Richie tells
him they pick out the very finest horse in the club stables for him
to ride, although she says she is afraid it will not compare to the
horses he is accustomed to riding in England.</p>

<p>Well, at this, Eddie Yokum is greatly nonplussed, and he figures
that here is the blow-off sure enough, especially as a guy who
seems to be a groom comes up leading a tall, fierce-looking horse,
and hands Eddie the bridle-reins. But Eddie cannot think of words
in which to put his confession, so when nobody seems to be noticing
him, he walks off by himself towards the club stables, and
naturally the horse follows him, because Eddie has hold of the
reins.</p>

<p>Now the presence of this horse at his heels is very disquieting
to Eddie Yokum, so when he gets behind the stables which shut him
off from the sight of the crowd, Eddie looks around for something
to tie the horse to, and finally drops the reins over the handle of
a motor-cycle that is leaning up against a wall, this motor-cycle
being there for the grooms to run errands on to and from the
city.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that in the excitement over getting the fox hunt
started, nobody misses Eddie Yokum at first, and away goes the
crowd on their horses with the hounds yapping quite some, while
Eddie is standing there behind the stables thinking of how to break
the news about himself to one and all, and especially to Miss
Phyllis Richie.</p>

<p>Then Eddie Yokum happens to look up, and who does he see coming
up the driveway in such a direction that they cannot miss seeing
him if he remains where he is, but Philly the Weeper and Hot Horse
Herbie, leading a pair of hounds, which are undoubtedly the fox
hounds they get from Eddie Yokum, and which they are now delivering
to claim the reward.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Naturally, the sight of these parties is most distasteful to
Eddie Yokum, because all he can think of is that in addition to
everything else, he will now be denounced as a dog thief, and Eddie
can scarcely bear to have Miss Phyllis Richie see him in such a
light, so he grabs up the motor-cycle, and starts it going, and
leaps in the saddle, and away he sprints down a country lane in the
opposite direction from the driveway, for if there is one thing
Eddie Yokum can do, it is ride a motor-cycle.</p>

<p>He forgets about the horse being hooked to the motor-cycle, and
of course the poor horse has to follow him, and every time Eddie
Yokum looks around, there is the horse, and Eddie gets the idea
that maybe the horse is chasing him, so he gives the motor-cycle
plenty of gas, and makes it zing. But it is very bumpy going along
the country lane, and Eddie cannot lose the horse, and, besides,
Eddie is personally becoming very tired, so finally he pulls up to
take a rest.</p>

<p>By this time, the horse has enough lather on him to shave the
House of David, and seems about ready to drop dead, and Eddie Yokum
will not care a cuss if he does, as Eddie is sick and tired of the
horse, although the horse is really not to blame for anything
whatever.</p>

<p>Anyway, Eddie Yokum is lying stretched out on the ground taking
a rest, when he hears the fox hounds barking away off, but coming
closer right along, and he figures the fox hunters will also be
moving in his direction, and as he does not wish to ever again be
seen by Miss Phyllis Richie after ducking the hunt, he unhooks the
horse from the motor-cycle, and gives it a good kick in the
vestibule, and tells it to go on about its business, and then he
crawls in under a big brush-heap beside the lane, dragging the
motor-cycle in after him.</p>

<p>Well, what is under the brush-heap but a little bitsy fox, all
tuckered out, and very much alarmed, and this little bitsy fox
seems glad to see such a kind and sympathetic face as Eddie Yokum
possesses, and it crawls into Eddie Yokum's lap, and roosts there
shivering and shaking, and the next thing Eddie knows the
brush-heap is surrounded by fox hounds, who are very anxious to get
at the little bitsy fox, and maybe at Eddie Yokum, too, but Eddie
remembers that he has some of Barker's Dog Crullers still left in
his pocket, and he cools the hounds out no little by feeding them
these appetizers.</p>

<p>By and by the fox hunters come up, following the hounds, and
they are greatly surprised when Eddie Yokum comes crawling out from
under the brush-heap with the little bitsy fox in his arms,
especially as they meet up with Eddie's horse all covered with
perspiration, and figure he must just finish a terrible run,
because of course they do not know about the motor-cycle hidden
under the brush-heap.</p>

<p>They are all the more surprised when Eddie Yokum tells them that
he does not believe in killing foxes, and that he always personally
catches them with his bare hands after the dogs locate them; but
Eddie feels rewarded when Miss Phyllis Richie smiles at him, and
says he is the most humane guy she ever meets, especially when
Eddie says his horse is too tired for him to ride him home, and
insists on walking, carrying the little bitsy fox.</p>

<p>Well, Eddie is commencing to wonder again how he can confess
what an impostor he is, and get away from this company, but the
more he looks at Miss Phyllis Richie, the more he hates to do it,
especially as she is talking about what a wonderful time they will
have at the dinner in his honour later on in the evening, as it
seems that this is to be a very fine affair, indeed, and Harry
Richman and several other stars of the "P's and Q's" company are
expected to be present to entertain, and Eddie Yokum can see where
he may be missing a great opportunity to come in contact with such
parties.</p>

<p>But by the time he gets back to the clubhouse, Eddie's mind is
pretty well made up to get himself out of this predicament, no
matter what, especially as the clubhouse door-man calls him aside,
and says to him like this:</p>

<p>"Mr. Searles," the doorman says, "a most obnoxious character is
here just a little while ago claiming he is you. Yes, sir," the
doorman says, "he has the gall to claim he is the Honourable Bertie
Searles, and he is slightly under the influence, and has several
dolls with him, including a very savage blonde. Of course we know
he is not you, and so we throw him out.</p>

<p>"He is very cheerful about it, at that, Mr. Searles," the
doorman says. "He says it does not strike him as a very lively
place, anyway, and that he is having more fun where he is. But the
savage blonde is inclined to make much of the matter. In fact, she
tries to bite me. It is a very strange world, Mr. Searles."</p>

<p>Well, Eddie Yokum figures right away that this must be the guy
they mistake him for, and he also figures that the guy is a sure
thing to be coming back sooner or later, and as it is now coming on
dusk, Eddie starts easing himself down the driveway, although they
tell him there is a nice room ready for him at the club where he
can clean up and take a rest before dinner; but he does not get
very far down the driveway, when who steps out of some bushes but
Philly the Weeper, who speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," Philly the Weeper says. "I know my eyes do
not deceive me when I see you springing away on a motor-cycle,
but," he says, "imagine my astonishment when I describe you to the
doorman, and he tells me you are the Honourable Bertie Searles.
Why, you can knock me over with the eighth pole, I am so surprised,
because of course I know you are nothing but a dog thief, and I am
waiting around here for hours to get an explanation from you for
such goings on."</p>

<p>Naturally, Philly the Weeper does not mention that he already
has Hot Horse Herbie collect two C's from the club secretary for
returning the hounds, and that he sends Herbie on back to
Baltimore, for Philly the Weeper has a nose like a beagle, and he
smells something here the minute he sees Eddie Yokum going away on
the motor-cycle, and he keeps himself in the background, while Hot
Horse Herbie is collecting the dough, although Philly does not
neglect to take the two C's off of Herbie afterwards, for
safe-keeping.</p>

<p>Of course, Philly the Weeper has no idea Eddie Yokum is trying
to run away entirely on the motor-cycle, or he will not be hanging
around waiting for him to come back, but there Eddie is, and Philly
the Weeper gets the whole story out of him in no time, because
Eddie figures the best thing for him to do is to throw himself on
the mercy of Philly the Weeper as far as the stolen dogs are
concerned.</p>

<p>Well, Philly the Weeper is greatly interested and amused at
Eddie's story of how he is mistaken for the Honourable Bertie
Searles, and has to go fox hunting, and of his sudden and great
love for Miss Phyllis Richie; but when Eddie gets down to telling
him about how he is now trying to slip away from the scene, Philly
the Weeper becomes very severe again, and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"No, no," Philly says, "you are not to go away, at all. You are
to remain here at the club for the dinner in your honour to-night,
and, moreover, you are to take me into the club with you as your
valet, because," Philly says, "I wish to play a joke on certain
members of this organization, including my old friend, Mr.
Prendergast, who will undoubtedly be present. If you will do this
for me, I will forget about you stealing Mr. Prendergast's fox
hounds, although he is inclined to be very drastic about the
matter."</p>

<p>Now, of course, if Eddie Yokum is such a guy as does a little
serious thinking now and then, the chances are he will see that
there is something unusual about all this, but Eddie is not only
very innocent, but by this time he is greatly confused, and all he
can think of to say to Philly the Weeper is that he is afraid the
real Honourable Bertie Searles will come back and expose him.</p>

<p>"You need not worry about this," Philly the Weeper says. "I am
present in ambush when the Honourable Bertie Searles and his party,
including my fiancée, Miss Lola Ledare, are given the bum's rush
out of here a short time ago, and as they depart I hear him
promising to give Lola and her friends a big party downtown
to-night after the show to reimburse them for the churlish
treatment they received here. Remember," Philly says, "you will not
only be rounding yourself up for stealing Mr. Prendergast's dogs,
but you will be able to be with the doll you love so dearly all
evening."</p>

<p>So the upshot of it all is, Eddie Yokum goes back to the club,
taking Philly the Weeper with him and explaining that Philly is his
valet; and one thing about it, Philly makes Eddie more important
than somewhat, at that, which is a good thing, as some of the
members are commencing to wonder about Eddie, especially Mr.
Marshall Preston, who is all burned up at the way Eddie is pitching
to Miss Phyllis Richie.</p>

<p>Now, the reason Philly the Weeper wishes to get inside the
clubhouse is not to play any jokes on anybody, as he says,
especially on his friend Mr. Prendergast, because in the first
place he has no friend named Mr. Prendergast, and in the second
place, Philly the Weeper has no friends by any names whatever. The
reason he wishes to get inside the clubhouse is to collect any
little odds and ends of jewellery that he may find lying about the
premises later on, for collecting articles of this kind is really
one of Philly the Weeper's regular occupations, though naturally he
does not mention it to Eddie Yokum.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he is of quite some service to Eddie Yokum
when they go to the room that is assigned to Eddie, as he coaches
Eddie in the way a guy shall act at dinner, and in talking to such
a doll as Miss Phyllis Richie, and he also fixes Eddie's clothes up
for him a little, as the dinner is to be in fox hunting costume,
which is a good thing for Eddie, as he does not have any other
costume.</p>

<p>The only argument they have is about the little bitsy fox, which
Eddie Yokum is still carrying around with him, and which he wishes
to keep with him at all times, as he is now very fond of the little
creature, but Philly the Weeper convinces him that it is better to
turn it loose, and let it return to its native haunts, and when
Eddie does same the little bitsy fox creates a riot in the club
kennels when it goes streaking past them headed for the woods.</p>

<p>Well, Eddie Yokum is a very hospitable soul, and he wishes
Philly the Weeper to attend the dinner with him, but Philly says
no, a valet is supposed to be a sort of hired hand, and does not go
in for social functions with his boss, so Eddie goes down to dinner
alone, leaving Philly the Weeper in the room, and Eddie is greatly
delighted to find Miss Phyllis Richie is waiting for him to escort
her in, and for the next couple of hours he is in a sort of trance,
and cannot remember that he is not the Honourable Bertie Searles,
but only Eddie Yokum, of Milburn, Del.</p>

<p>All he can remember is that he hauls off and tells Miss Phyllis
Richie that he is in love with her, and she says she loves him
right back, and the only trouble with this conversation is that Mr.
Marshall Preston accidentally overhears it, and is so unhappy he
can scarcely think, because it is only a couple of hours before
that Mr. Marshall Preston asks Miss Phyllis Richie to please marry
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall Preston is so unhappy that he goes out to the bar
before dinner is over and has a few drinks, and then goes upstairs
to a room he is occupying for the evening, just in time to catch
Philly the Weeper collecting a job lot of trinkets in the room to
add to a bundle he already collects from other rooms.</p>

<p>Naturally, this unexpected intrusion is most embarrassing to
Philly the Weeper, especially as Mr. Marshall Preston recognizes
him as the Honourable Bertie Searles' valet, and it is perhaps just
as well for Mr. Marshall Preston that Philly the Weeper is not
rodded up at this time, as Philly never cares to be embarrassed.
But Mr. Marshall Preston turns out to be very broad-minded, and
instead of making a scene over finding Philly the Weeper at his
collecting, he speaks to Philly as follows:</p>

<p>"Sit down," he says. "Sit down, and let us talk this over. What
is there about this party who calls himself the Honorable Bertie
Searles that causes me to wonder, and what is your real connection
with him, and why does your face seem so familiar to me? Tell me
your tale, and tell me true," Mr. Marshall Preston says, "or shall
I call the gendarmes?"</p>

<p>Well, Philly the Weeper can see that Mr. Marshall Preston is no
sucker, so he tells him that the Honourable Bertie Searles at the
club is 100 per cent phoney, because he is nobody but Eddie Yokum,
and he explains how he gets there, and that the real Honourable
Bertie Searles is down-town enjoying himself with members of the
"P's and Q's" company.</p>

<p>"And," Philly says, "the reason my face seems familiar to you
may be because I am around the race-tracks quite often, although I
never have much truck with the steeple-chasers."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Marshall Preston listens to all this with great
interest, and when Philly the Weeper gets through, Mr. Marshall
Preston sits there quiet for awhile, as if he is studying something
out, and finally he says like this:</p>

<p>"I will call up the Honourable Bertie Searles, and we will have
him come here and expose this impostor," he says. "It will be a
good lesson to Miss Phyllis Richie for taking up with such a
character without first finding out something about him. But in the
meantime," he says, "let us continue talking while I make up my
mind about handing you over to the cops."</p>

<p>They continue talking until Mr. Marshall Preston forgets about
calling the Honourable Bertie Searles until an hour later, and then
he may just as well save himself the trouble, for at the moment he
is telephoning, the Honourable Bertie Searles is on his way to the
Oriole Hunts Club with Miss Lola Ledare, and a taxi-load of other
blondes, and a few brunettes, because right in the middle of a nice
party, some of the blondes remember they are due at the club to
help Harry Richman put on a number, and the Honourable Bertie
Searles says he will go along and demand an explanation from the
club for his treatment earlier in the day, although the Honourable
Bertie Searles says he does not really care a whoop, as he is
treated worse in better clubs.</p>

<p>Well, while all this is happening, the dinner is going along
very nicely, and it is a gala scene, to be sure, what with the
decorations, and music, and all, and Eddie Yokum is in more of a
trance than ever over Miss Phyllis Richie, when all of a sudden an
old phflug by the name of Mrs. Abernathy comes running into the
dining-hall letting out a squawk that she is robbed. It seems that
she leaves a purse containing some dough, and other valuables, with
her wraps in the dolls' dressing-room upstairs, and when she goes
up there to powder her nose, or some such, she finds somebody
knocks off her poke.</p>

<p>Now, this causes other dolls to remember leaving their leathers
laying around upstairs, and some of them investigate at once, and
find they are clipped, too, and presently guys who occupy rooms in
the club are also letting out bleats and it becomes apparent that
some thievery is going on around and about, and the club manager
telephones for the police, because the beefs are commencing to be
most upsetting.</p>

<p>Well, naturally Eddie Yokum is paying little attention to this
commotion, because he is too greatly interested in Miss Phyllis
Richie, but all of a sudden a bunch of coppers walk into the room,
and who is among them but Detective Wilbert Schmalz, and the minute
Eddie sees him, he becomes alarmed, as he is afraid Detective
Schmalz may recognize him and put the arm on him for stealing the
fox hounds, even though this matter is now supposed to be rounded
up with Philly the Weeper.</p>

<p>So Eddie Yokum excuses himself to Miss Phyllis Richie and steps
in back of a stand of potted plants, where he will not be
conspicuous, and about this time he hears a familiar voice asking
what is the trouble here, and why are all the coppers present, and
somebody speaks up and says:</p>

<p>"Why, we are robbed."</p>

<p>Then Eddie Yokum hears the familiar voice again, which he
recognizes as the voice of Mr. Barker, who makes the dog crullers,
and it is quite a loud voice, at that, and very unpleasant, and in
fact it is such a loud voice that it causes Eddie Yokum to tremble
in his top-boots, for Mr. Barker states as follows:</p>

<p>"You are robbed?" he says. "Well, think of me, and how I am
robbed, too. I am robbed of my hunting clothes, and I have to
appear here at a hunts dinner for the first time in all the years I
am a member of this club, the way you see me. If they do not happen
to have sense enough to find their way home, I will also be robbed
of Adolph, my dachshund, and Boggie, my Boston, and McTavish, my
Scottie. But," Mr. Barker says, "if it takes me the rest of my
life, I will find the young squirt who runs off with my hunting
clothes and choke the tongue out of his head."</p>

<p>Well, at this, Eddie Yokum peeks around the potted plants, and
he sees Mr. Barker standing nearby in a dinner jacket, and
apparently very angry, indeed, and this is quite a situation for
Eddie Yokum, because he is between Detective Schmalz, who may wish
to put the arm on him, and Mr. Barker, who wishes to choke the
tongue out of his head, and as if this is not enough, there is now
a great commotion at the front door, with dolls squealing, and guys
yelling, and Eddie Yokum hears somebody say that a guy is out there
claiming he is the Honourable Bertie Searles, and trying to fight
his way in.</p>

<p>The racket is so great it attracts everybody's attention, and
Eddie Yokum sees his chance and slips away quietly, popping into
the first door he comes to, and this door leads down a stairway
into the furnace-room, so Eddie hides himself behind a furnace for
awhile.</p>

<p>In the meantime, there is much excitement upstairs, as it seems
that the Honourable Bertie Searles finally battles his way inside
against great odds, and is identified by all the members of the
"P's and Q's" company who are with him, including Harry Richman and
the other stars, as the guy he claims he is, and he is demanding
apologies from everybody connected with the club, while a search is
going on for the phoney Honourable Bertie Searles.</p>

<p>Finally, Detective Schmalz, who joins the search, frisks the
room that Eddie occupies, and finds a couple of missing purses, now
empty, and everybody is saying that there is no doubt Eddie is not
only an impostor, but that he and his valet are thieves; although
Mr. Marshall Preston puts in there, and says he does not think the
valet is a party to the crime, as he personally sees the valet
leaving the premises some time before the robbery can possibly take
place.</p>

<p>So then everybody agrees that Eddie must be a lone hand
criminal, and Miss Phyllis Richie is so mortified she gets her
wraps and goes out on the veranda, especially after somebody
describes Eddie Yokum, and Mr. Barker says he is surely the guy who
cops his hunting costume, and Detective Schmalz, who listens in on
the description, states that he is positive the guy is a much
wanted dog snatcher.</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall Preston goes out on the veranda and tries to
console Miss Phyllis Richie, and in fact he tells her that it is
now time for her to make up her mind to marry him and find safety
from adventurers such as Eddie Yokum, but Miss Phyllis Richie gives
him a very short answer, and there are undoubtedly large tears in
her eyes as she speaks, and anybody can see that she is feeling
very downhearted, so Mr. Marshall Preston leaves her to her
sorrow.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon the entertainment goes into action, and the
real Honourable Bertie Searles becomes the guest of honour in place
of Eddie Yokum, and everybody forgets the unpleasant incidents of
the evening, because the Honourable Bertie Searles is full of life
and spirits and does not centre his attention on any one doll, as
Eddie does when he is guest of honour, but scatters his shots
around and about, although it is plain to be seen that the
Honourable Bertie Searles cares for Miss Lola Ledare more than
somewhat, even if she does keep wishing to go back and fight the
doorman all over again.</p>

<p>Meantime, Eddie Yokum is down in the furnace-room, and how to
get out and away from the club without being observed becomes
something of a problem, as Eddie is still in the fox hunting
costume, and such a costume is bound to attract attention at all
times, and, furthermore, the only entrance to the furnace-room
seems to be the room through which Eddie comes in the first
place.</p>

<p>Well, Eddie sits there behind the furnace thinking things over,
and he can hear the music and the laughter upstairs, and he is
wishing he is back in Milburn, Del., where he has a home, and
friends, and thinking of Milburn, Del., reminds Eddie of the time
he blacks up his face and gives imitations of Al Jolson and Eddie
Cantor; and thinking of this gives him a brand-new idea.</p>

<p>This idea is to black up his face right there and walk out to
safety, because Eddie figures that anybody who sees him is bound to
take him as an employee of the furnace-room, so he peeks into the
furnace, and finds a lot of soot, and he makes his face blacker
than a yard up a chimney.</p>

<p>Moreover, Eddie gets another break when he finds a suit of blue
overalls left by some guy who works in the furnace-room, and also
an old cap, and when he sneaks out the door a little later, he is
nothing but a boogie, as far as anybody can see, and not a very
clean boogie, at that, and the chances are he will be out of the
club and gone in two minutes, if he does not happen to run into the
Honourable Bertie Searles, who is teetering around looking for Miss
Lola Ledare, who is absent from the scene longer than the
Honourable Bertie Searles thinks is necessary.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Miss Lola Ledare is at this time off in a
corner with Mr. Barker, giving Mr. Barker quite a canvass one way
and another, for Miss Lola Ledare is a doll who believes in
scattering her play, but of course this has nothing to do with the
story.</p>

<p>Well, when he runs into Eddie Yokum, naturally the Honourable
Bertie Searles thinks Eddie is really a coloured guy, and right
away the Honourable Bertie Searles gets a big idea, as guys who are
rummed up a little always do. The Honourable Bertie Searles says
that so far the entertainment in his honour lacks the old Southern
touch he is led to believe he will find in such spots as Baltimore,
Md., especially by coloured parties, and he considers Eddie a great
capture, and insists on leading him out on the floor where the
entertainment is going on, and presenting him to the crowd as a bit
of real Southern atmosphere.</p>

<p>Naturally, Eddie Yokum is somewhat embarrassed, and alarmed,
because he is afraid he will be recognized by somebody, but no one
gives him a rumble for who he is, and everybody laughs heartily at
what they consider the Honourable Bertie Searles' humour. Then the
Honourable Bertie Searles says his protégé will now sing, and there
is nothing for Eddie Yokum to do but sing, so he goes into "Silver
Threads Among the Gold," and the orchestra picks him up nicely, and
accompanies his singing.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, Eddie will be very glad to sing before such an
audience, and even now he has a notion to give them Al Jolson and
Eddie Cantor, then he commences thinking of what will happen to him
if he is recognized, and he gets so alarmed he sings a little
flat.</p>

<p>As he is singing, Eddie Yokum makes sure of the direction of the
front entrance to the club, and he keeps edging in this direction
as his song comes to a close, so it seems very natural when he
finishes to bow himself off in an aisle leading to the entrance;
only Eddie keeps right on going out the entrance, and he is on the
veranda, and flying, when who does he run into but Miss Phyllis
Richie.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, at the sight of Miss Phyllis Richie, Eddie Yokum forgets
he is all sooted up, and looks like a smudge, and in fact all he
can think of is how much he loves Miss Phyllis Richie, and he
rushes up to her and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"Darling," Eddie Yokum says, "I am in a bit of a hurry right
now, and do not have time to explain matters, but do not believe
anything you hear about me, because it is by no means true; and,
anyway," Eddie says, "I adore you."</p>

<p>Naturally, Miss Phyllis Richie thinks at first that Eddie is a
real jig, and she is somewhat startled for a moment, but then she
recognizes his voice, and she becomes very indignant, indeed.</p>

<p>"Why," Miss Phyllis Richie says, "you impostor! You cad! You
liar! Why," she says, "you dog stealer! You common burglar! If you
do not get away from here at once, I will call Mr. Marshall Preston
and he will thrash you within an inch of your life, and turn you
over to the police!"</p>

<p>And with this, she hauls off and biffs Eddie Yokum a hard slap
in the kisser, and then she bursts out crying, and there is nothing
for Eddie Yokum to do but to continue on his way, because he hears
the Honourable Bertie Searles yelling for him, and he does not
desire any further complications at this time.</p>

<p>All Eddie Yokum wishes to do is to go away somewhere and sit
down and rest, and get his nerves composed again, as he is feeling
greatly fatigued; and the first thing he does is to go to his
rooming-house and wash himself up, and put on his best suit of
clothes, which he brings with him from Milburn, Del., and then he
starts thinking things over, and what he especially thinks over is
why Miss Phyllis Richie calls him a common burglar, for of course
Eddie Yokum does not know he is suspected of prowling the Oriole
Hunt Club, although he knows it the next morning when he reads all
about the robbery in the paper, and also about how the coppers are
looking for a guy who impersonates the Honourable Bertie Searles to
get into the club for the purpose of committing the crime.</p>

<p>Well, this is a very great shock to Eddie Yokum, and he can see
at once why he stands like a broken leg with Miss Phyllis Richie.
Moreover, he can see that there is just one guy who can state that
he does not get into the club to commit any crimes, and this guy is
nobody but Philly the Weeper, so Eddie figures the thing for him to
do is to find Philly the Weeper, and get him to straighten this
matter out, although of course if Eddie is well acquainted with
Philly the Weeper he will know that getting Philly to straighten
anything out is just the same thing as asking a gimlet to
straighten out.</p>

<p>But Eddie Yokum has great faith in human nature and honesty, so
the next morning he goes around in front of the Cornflower Hotel
looking for Philly the Weeper; but Philly is by no means there,
although The Seldom Seen Kid and Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds are
present; and at first none of them recognize Eddie without his fox
hunter's costume until he asks The Seldom Seen Kid where Philly is,
and The Seldom Seen Kid says like this:</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "if you can tell us, we will be greatly
obliged, for we are seeking him ourselves to cut his ears off
unless he kicks in with our share of a small score we make on some
dogs. Yes," The Seldom Seen Kid says, "we will just love to see
Philly the Weeper, but the 'P's and Q's' company goes to New York
this morning, and the chances are he goes there, too, because he
never gets far away from his fiancée, Miss Lola Ledare, for fear he
will starve to death. But we will catch up with him sooner or
later."</p>

<p>Then The Seldom Seen Kid seems to remember Eddie Yokum's face,
and he starts to laugh, because the last time he sees Eddie Yokum
it is a very humorous spectacle, to be sure; but Eddie Yokum does
not see anything to laugh about, and he starts in telling The
Seldom Seen Kid and Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds how Philly the
Weeper makes him take him into the club as his valet, and what
happens, and how he wishes to find Philly to prove his innocence;
and Hot Horse Herbie is especially horrified, and states as
follows:</p>

<p>"Why," he says, "I ought to know this fink has something on his
mind that spells larceny when he tells me he is going to stick
around out there at the club awhile and sends me back to town.
But," Herbie says, "it does not occur to me it is anything more
serious than maybe stealing a couple of dogs over again to collect
another reward. There is no doubt but what he prowls the joint and
leaves this poor guy to take the fall."</p>

<p>"Philly the Weeper is a wrong gee," The Seldom Seen Kid says. "I
know he is a wrong gee because he means to defraud us of our end of
the two C's he gets yesterday, but I never figure he is wrong
enough to do such a trick as he does to this guy here. It is really
most preposterous. Well," The Seldom Seen Kid says, "the races are
over here tomorrow and the best thing for you to do is to go with
us and see if we can find Philly the Weeper. Anyway," he says, "if
you stick around here you will be picked up and placed in the
sneezer, and it is very, very difficult to get out of a Baltimore
sneezer, once you are in."</p>

<p>So this is how Eddie Yokum comes to be in New York and around
Mindy's restaurant on Broadway the next week with The Seldom Seen
Kid, and Hot Horse Herbie, and Big Reds, and also with other
prominent turf advisers, and followers of the sport of kings, for
Mindy's restaurant is a great resort for such characters.</p>

<p>But although he looks high and low, Eddie Yokum does not see
hide or hair of Philly the Weeper, and neither does The Seldom Seen
Kid and Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds, although his fiancée, Miss
Lola Ledare, is around in different spots nearly every night with
the Honourable Bertie Searles, and the price against the Honourable
Bertie Searles' horse, Trafalgar, in the Gold Vase Steeplechase
goes up by the minute, and some bookmakers will give you as good as
10 to 1 that the Honourable Bertie cannot even sit on a horse
Saturday, let alone ride one.</p>

<p>Most of the conversation around Mindy's at this time is about
the Gold Vase Steeplechase, but it is conceded by one and all that
it is a set-up for Miss Phyllis Richie's Follow You, and every time
Eddie Yokum hears her name he has a pain in his heart, because he
even forgets to think of Philly the Weeper when he is thinking of
Miss Phyllis Richie.</p>

<p>What with being around with parties interested in horse racing,
Eddie Yokum takes to reading the sport pages quite some, and when
it comes to the day before the Gold Vase, he reads about Miss
Phyllis Richie arriving at the Savoy-Plaza with a party of friends
from all over Maryland to see the race, and he hangs around in
front of the hotel for three hours just to get a peek at her,
although he is somewhat discouraged when he sees Miss Phyllis
Richie with Mr. Marshall Preston.</p>

<p>In the evening, he hears the citizens around Mindy's speaking of
Mr. Marshall Preston's horse, Sweep Forward, and of other horses,
but the conversation makes no impression on Eddie Yokum, because he
does not know anything about racing, and in fact he never sees a
race, because he hates horses so much, but there is so much
excitement over the Gold Vase that finally he feels a desire to see
this race, and he asks The Seldom Seen Kid and Hot Horse Herbie and
Big Reds if they will take him with them the next day.</p>

<p>Well, they say they will, although they will much rather take
somebody that has something, because the truth of the matter is,
they are getting a little tired of Eddie Yokum, as he is strictly a
non-producer at this time, and they have to sustain him as he goes
along, and the only reason they do this is they feel sorry for him,
and The Seldom Seen Kid and Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds are noted
for their kind hearts.</p>

<p>The Seldom Seen Kid is especially sorry for Eddie Yokum, because
he knows of Eddie's love for Miss Phyllis Richie, as Eddie confides
same to The Seldom Seen Kid one evening, and as The Seldom Seen
often carries the old torch himself, he knows how it feels.</p>

<p>But he is wishing Eddie Yokum will get a job and forget Miss
Phyllis Richie, as The Seldom Seen Kid regards it as a hopeless
passion, especially as he reads in a paper that Miss Phyllis Richie
is planning to go abroad with a party that will include Mr.
Marshall Preston immediately after the race for the Gold Vase,
although The Seldom Seen Kid does not show this item to Eddie
Yokum.</p>

<p>Well, the day of the Gold Vase Steeplechase is always a great
day at Belmont Park, as it brings together all the greatest
steeplechasers in the country, and the best riders, including
gentleman jocks and professionals, and the best society crowd, and
Eddie Yokum is quite bewildered by what he sees and hears as he
wanders around and about, although he cannot help a feeling of
loathing that all this is over horses.</p>

<p>He looks around for Miss Phyllis Richie, and asks The Seldom
Seen Kid where she is apt to be at such a place as a race-track,
and The Seldom Seen says the chances are she will be out under the
trees behind the grandstand where the horses are walked around and
saddled not long before the big race, to take a peek at her horse,
and furthermore The Seldom Seen Kid says:</p>

<p>"I only wish you are on speaking terms with her, at that," he
says. "There is a rumour that Miss Phyllis Richie's nigger jockey,
Roy Snakes, is off on a bender, or something to this effect.
Anyway, they say he is missing, and if they cannot find him, or get
another jig jock, they will have to scratch Follow You, because no
white guy alive can ride Follow You in a race.</p>

<p>"Now," The Seldom Seen Kid goes on, "I hear there is not another
coon steeplechaser in these parts just now, and if you can find out
if Roy Snakes is really absent, I can get a fair price on Sweep
Forward. With Follow You out, he is a triple-plated pipe. It will
really be quite a favour to me, and some of my customers if you can
secure this information for me before the rush sets in."</p>

<p>Well, Eddie Yokum does not understand what this is all about,
but he does get the idea that Miss Phyllis Richie may be in some
sort of predicament, so he goes out under the trees behind the
grandstand, and waits around there awhile, and sure enough he
finally sees Miss Phyllis Richie standing under a tree around which
an old guy by the name of Ike is leading a big chestnut horse, and
there is a large ring of guys and dolls around the tree looking at
the horse, and furthermore he sees that Miss Phyllis Richie's eyes
are all red and swollen as if she is weeping.</p>

<p>Now at this spectacle, Eddie Yokum's heart goes out to Miss
Phyllis Richie, and he will walk right up to her as bold as a lion
if he is not afraid of the horse, so he waits awhile longer, and
pretty soon Miss Phyllis Richie leaves the group and goes across
the grass to the jockey-house, and what Miss Phyllis Richie is
going to the jockey-house for is to ask if Roy Snakes shows up, or
if they find another darky jockey for her.</p>

<p>But it seems the answer is no both ways, and Miss Phyllis Richie
is turning away looking most despondent when Eddie Yokum steps up
to her and speaks to her as follows:</p>

<p>"Miss Richie," Eddie says, "if there is anything I can do to
help you out in this situation, kindly so state. I know you despise
me," he says, "but I will gladly lay down my life for you."</p>

<p>Well, at this, Miss Phyllis Richie stops and gazes at him
awhile, and there is great sarcasm in her voice when she finally
says:</p>

<p>"Why, the last time I see you, you are coloured. It is a pity
you are not the same way now, or you might take Roy Snakes' place
in this race. Good-day to you, Mr. Burglar, or I will call a
Pinkerton."</p>

<p>She turns away, and goes back to where the old guy is walking
the horse around, and Eddie Yokum follows her at a distance, but
gets up in time to hear her telling Ike it is no use waiting on Roy
Snakes, or anybody else, and to go ahead and declare Follow You out
of the Gold Vase Steeplechase.</p>

<p>Then she disappears in the crowd, but Eddie Yokum can see that
she is very sad, and he is sad himself, and he gets to talking to
Ike, and he asks him what about a guy blacking himself up and
fooling Follow You into thinking he is a smoke, and Ike says it is
undoubtedly a great idea.</p>

<p>"In fact," Ike says, "if I am younger, I will do it myself, just
to save Miss Phyllis Richie, because I hear if she does not win
this stake, she is going to marry Mr. Marshall Preston, and this is
a sad fate for a young doll, to be sure. Between you and me, Mr.
Marshall Preston is far from being all right."</p>

<p>Well, at this news, Eddie Yokum becomes greatly agitated, and he
tells Ike to get him some cork, and he will ride Follow You, and
old Ike is so delighted that he does not bother to ask Eddie Yokum
if he is a good rider. He leaves Follow You in charge of a stable
boy, and takes Eddie Yokum over to the secretary's office and
announces him as a gentleman jockey from Delaware, who is willing
to help Miss Phyllis Richie out of her predicament about a jockey,
and when they suggest that Eddie Yokum seems to be as white as any
of the other white guys who try to ride Follow You and fail, and
Ike says Eddie is going to ride blackface, there is quite a looking
up of the rules.</p>

<p>But there is nothing in the rules against such a thing, although
an old guy in the office with a big white mouser says it seems
quite irregular, and that he does not recall a similar case in
fifty years of experience. However, he says the office is willing
to establish a precedent in the case of such a great horse as
Follow You, though he cannot figure what on earth becomes of Roy
Snakes, or why the only other two coloured steeplechase jockeys in
the East, Washington and Lincoln, find it necessary to go to Aiken
two days before this race.</p>

<p>He is still muttering about the matter when Ike takes Eddie
Yokum to the jockey-house, and then Ike sends in to Frank Stevens'
bar in the clubhouse and buys several bottles of liquor to get
corks for Eddie to burn and black up with, although Ike personally
drinks all the liquor himself.</p>

<p>Well, all the time Eddie Yokum is blacking up, he is saying
every prayer he knows that Roy Snakes, or one of the other dinge
jockeys appears to ride Follow You, but no such thing happens, and
by and by Eddie is out in the Richie colours, and is as black as
anything, and maybe blacker, and while Follow You gives him quite a
snuffing over when Eddie approaches him, the horse seems satisfied
he is dealing with a smoke, and afterwards some people claim this
is a knock to the way Eddie smells.</p>

<p>No one will ever know what Eddie Yokum suffers when he is
hoisted up on Follow You, and there is considerable criticism of
his riding technique, as he does not seem to be sure which is the
front end and which is the back end of a horse.</p>

<p>But by this time, Eddie is determined to go through with this
proposition if he gets killed, and it looks as if he will, at that,
although it does not look as if he will get killed any sooner than
the Honourable Bertie Searles, who arrives at the course slightly
mulled, and who insists on practising a few tricks he once observes
at a rodeo in England, when the horses are going to the post,
because the Honourable Bertie Searles thinks Miss Lola Ledare is in
the grandstand watching him, and he warns her to be sure and take
note of his fancy riding.</p>

<p>Now, the Honourable Bertie Searles is riding along next to Eddie
Yokum, and he seems such a good-natured sort of guy that Eddie
figures it may not be a bad idea to get a little advice from him,
so he asks the Honourable Bertie Searles what are the rules of such
a race, and what is the best thing for a guy who does not know much
about it to do; and while the Honourable Bertie Searles is somewhat
surprised at the question, especially from a smudge rider, he
answers as follows:</p>

<p>"Why," he says, "all you do is to try and keep going. If you
fall off your horse, do not worry, but just get back on again, and
take the jump all over and keep going, unless your neck is broken.
Personally, I generally let my horse, Trafalgar, do the thinking
for me in a race, because Trafalgar is quite a thinker, and maybe
your horse is a thinker, too. But," he says, "keep going."</p>

<p>The most astonished guy around at seeing Eddie Yokum on Follow
You is undoubtedly Mr. Marshall Preston, who is riding his horse
Sweep Forward, but he is no more astonished than Miss Phyllis
Richie, who is sitting in a box in the grandstand with a party of
friends from Baltimore, Md., and who is still weeping, thinking her
horse is out of the race.</p>

<p>She stops weeping when she sees her colours on the track, and
looks at the jockey-board to see who is riding her horse, but the
name E. Yokum on the board means nothing to her, as she never hears
Eddie's real name before, and she does not recognize him at first,
and figures he is some new coloured jockey old Ike digs up at the
last minute.</p>

<p>The horse players on the lawn and the bookies under the stand
are also somewhat astonished, because there nobody ever hears of E.
Yokum before, either, except maybe The Seldom Seen Kid, and Hot
Horse Herbie, and Big Reds, and even they do not know Eddie in his
make-up until they run down to the rail to watch the post parade,
and Eddie Yokum tips them a large wink, although the reason Eddie
tips them this wink is to squeeze a large tear out of his eye,
because Eddie is so alarmed he is half crying, and only love
sustains him in the saddle.</p>

<p>Well, when The Seldom Seen Kid and Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds
see who is on Follow You, and see Eddie's wink, they figure that
there must be something very special doing in this race, and they
start running around everywhere, hoping they may be able to raise a
few bobs to bet on Follow You, but of course nobody is going to let
them have a few bobs for any purpose, and they are greatly
discouraged about the matter, when who do they run into but Miss
Lola Ledare, who is not in the grandstand at all, as the Honourable
Bertie Searles thinks, but is standing on the edge of the betting
ring with some large coarse banknotes in her hand.</p>

<p>Naturally, when they see Miss Lola Ledare in possession of
funds, they are greatly interested, and they surround her and ask
her what seems to be troubling her, and Miss Lola Ledare speaks
freely to them, as she is not aware of any coolness between them
and her fiancée, Philly the Weeper, and what she speaks is as
follows:</p>

<p>"Why," she says, "they do not allow ladies in the betting ring,
and I am waiting here for some one to come along and bet this money
for me on Sweep Forward, so your arrival is most timely. The bet is
for Philly. He raises this money on some old family heirlooms that
I never know he possesses, and he requests me to place it for him.
Personally," she says, "I think the Honourable Bertie Searles will
win this race on Trafalgar, because he tells me so himself, and I
have half a notion to bet some of the money on him, only I am
afraid of what Philly will say if Trafalgar does not come in."</p>

<p>Well, The Seldom Seen Kid takes the dough out of Miss Lola
Ledare's hand, and says to her like this: "Lola," he says, "it will
be a privilege and a pleasure for me to do Philly the service of
betting this money for him &mdash; and by the way, where is
Philly?"</p>

<p>"Why," Lola says, "he asks me not to mention to anybody that he
is present, but I know he will not mind you knowing. He is sitting
away up in one corner of the grand-stand all by himself. To tell
the truth, Philly has become somewhat solitary of late, and I am
commencing to get somewhat displeased with him, because I like
sociable guys, like the Honourable Bertie Searles."</p>

<p>Well, The Seldom Seen Kid is somewhat surprised to find that he
takes ten large C's off of Miss Lola Ledare, because he does not
know there is this much money in the world,and he hurries into the
ring and bets it all on Follow You and gets 6 to 5 for the money,
as Follow You is favourite, even with somebody by the name of E.
Yokum up, which shows what the public thinks of the horse, although
with Roy Snakes riding, the price will be 7 to 10.</p>

<p>There is a ton of money for Sweep Forward at the last minute,
and some very, very smart guys are betting on him, and furthermore
there is a rumour that Sweep Forward has help in the race, which is
a way of saying that some of the others will be trying to assist
Sweep Forward to win, and there is also a rumour that Follow You is
a stiff in the race, and this is why Roy Snakes is not riding; but
one thing about a race-track, you can always hear anything, and the
public sticks to Follow You, no matter what.</p>

<p>There are ten other horses in the Gold Vase, and there is money
for all of them, including Trafalgar, although Trafalgar is 15 to
1, as nobody seems to care for the way the Honourable Bertie
Searles is riding the horse going to the post, what with the
Honourable Bertie Searles doing hand-stands in the saddle, and
otherwise carrying on.</p>

<p>Now the Gold Vase Steeplechase is a race of about three miles,
or about two and a half times around the course, and the horses
have to make about nineteen jumps over hedges and a water jump, and
everybody that knows about these matters will tell you that this is
the toughest race in this country, especially with a big field of
starters, and many things can happen in the race, including death.
In fact, a steeplechaser rider is regarded as a very poor risk,
indeed, by all insurance companies, although it is perhaps just as
well that Eddie Yokum does not know this as he goes to the
post.</p>

<p>But Eddie is smart enough to remember what the Honourable Bertie
Searles tells him about letting the horse do the thinking, and it
happens that Follow You is quite a thinker, indeed, and very
experienced, so when the starter tells them to come on, Eddie just
hangs on to Follow You's mane and lets him do as he feels best, and
Follow You feels that it is best to go right to the front.</p>

<p>At least Eddie Yokum hangs on to Follow You's mane until the
horse hits the first jump, when Mr. Marshall Preston, on Sweep
Forward, comes out of the pack with a rush, and yells look out, and
Eddie is looking out as Follow You jumps with Sweep Forward, and
Eddie lets go the mane so he can look out better, and the next
thing Eddie knows he is on the grass, and the rest of the field is
going past him, and Follow You is standing there looking greatly
surprised.</p>

<p>Well, there is a groan from the grandstand, for here is the
public choice apparently out of the race before it really starts,
but Eddie suddenly remembers what the Honourable Bertie Searles
tells him about keeping going, and taking all the jumps, so he gets
on his feet, and backs Follow You up against the fence and climbs
on him and sends him at the jump again, and this time Eddie does
not forget to hang on to the horse's mane.</p>

<p>But all this takes up some time, and the rest of the field is
anyway half a mile ahead, but three horses go down at the second
jump, and two more at the third, and at both these jumps, Eddie
Yokum falls off Follow You as the horse is jumping, and the public
is commencing to marvel about Follow You making every jump twice,
and wondering if it is a handicap he is giving the others, or
what.</p>

<p>Sweep Forward is out in front going easy, and fencing like a
bird, with Mr. Marshall Preston looking very graceful in the
saddle, and who is laying right close to him all the time but the
Honourable Bertie Searles, on Trafalgar. The rest are strung out
all along the course, and it looks like a parade more than anything
else.</p>

<p>Well, the real tough jump on the course is the water jump in
front of the grandstand, and they take this jump twice during the
race, and the first time Eddie Yokum falls off Follow You into the
water he is so long coming up that many customers think maybe he is
drowned, and most of them hope he is, at that.</p>

<p>But one thing about Follow You, he never runs away when he loses
his rider, but stands perfectly still until Eddie is on his back
again, although Follow You is commencing to look very pained,
especially when it appears to be a sure thing that he will be
lapped by Sweep Forward and Trafalgar, anyway, before the race is
over.</p>

<p>However, other horses keep going down at the various jumps, and
at the end of the second mile, only Sweep Forward and Trafalgar,
and a horse that is called Great Shakes, with a professional jockey
by the name of Smithers up, and Follow You are left in the race,
although of course you cannot say Follow You is really in the race
because he is now almost a full mile to the rear, and Miss Phyllis
Richie faints three different times in the grandstand, once out of
dismay, and twice out of vexation.</p>

<p>It seems that Miss Phyllis Richie does not recognize Eddie Yokum
even yet, but she can see that the guy on her horse does not have
any great knack for riding, and she is annoyed no little,
especially as everybody on the premises is now uniting in a Bronx
cheer for Follow You and his jockey.</p>

<p>The way Eddie Yokum is riding Follow You when he is not falling
off is really something remarkable, as he is all over the horse,
and sometimes halfway under him, and when the Honourable Bertie
Searles sees this exhibition, he gets sored up, because he figures
Eddie is trying to show him up as a trick rider, although of course
Eddie has no such idea whatever.</p>

<p>Now Trafalgar is never more than two lengths off Sweep Forward
at any stage of the race, and anybody can see that the Honourable
Bertie Searles has a great horse under him, and in fact it looks as
if he can go to the front whenever he is ready, and when Great
Shakes falls with Smithers at about the fourteenth jump, it is
strictly a two-horse race, because by this time Eddie Yokum is in
the water jump again, and, anyway, Follow You is getting pretty
much fagged out, because the way the race figures, Follow You does
twice as much work as any of the other horses, and he is carrying
top weight of 175 pounds, at that, counting Eddie's 150 and the
lead in his saddle slots.</p>

<p>In fact, Follow You is so fagged out that he is just able to jog
along, and the jumps in the last mile are as tough for him as they
are for Eddie, and in fact once when Eddie is stretched out on the
grass after a jump, it looks as if Follow You wishes to lay down
beside him.</p>

<p>Well, in the meantime, Mr. Marshall Preston on Sweep Forward and
the Honourable Bertie Searles on Trafalgar, are tearing for the
last jump neck and neck, because the Honourable Bertie Searles now
makes his serious challenge, and the crowd is up and yelling and
nobody even thinks of Eddie Yokum and Follow You plugging along
away back yonder, except maybe Miss Phyllis Richie.</p>

<p>Sweep Forward and Trafalgar take off for the final jump just
like a team, and as Trafalgar jumps, Mr. Marshall Preston gives him
a smack across the nose with his riding bat, which upsets Trafalgar
no little, and in fact causes him to stumble and fall as he clears
the jump, but not before the Honourable Bertie Searles can reach
out almost in mid-air and tweak Mr. Marshall Preston's saddle pad
in such a way that Sweep Forward falls, too, because naturally the
Honourable Bertie Searles is slightly irked by Mr. Marshall Preston
playing such a dirty trick on Trafalgar.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Marshall Preston lets out a loud cry as Sweep Forward
falls, because Mr. Marshall Preston finds himself pinned down under
the horse with a broken leg, and he is in great pain at once, and
while the Honourable Bertie Searles is not hurt, Trafalgar gets up
and runs off so fast there is no chance that the Honourable Bertie
Searles can catch him, and by and by along the course comes Eddie
Yokum on Follow You, the only horse left in the race, with one jump
to go.</p>

<p>Well, the Honourable Bertie Searles runs up the course, somewhat
excited, and begins coaching Eddie Yokum, telling him to take it
easy, and to bear a little to the left going over the jump to keep
from landing on Mr. Marshall Preston and Sweep Forward, and Eddie
tries to do as he is told, but Follow You is now a mighty weary
horse, and for the first time in years he falls taking a hurdle,
and Eddie finds himself on the turf alongside Mr. Marshall Preston,
who stops groaning long enough to look at Eddie Yokum in great
surprise, and to speak to him as follows:</p>

<p>"I am dying," Mr. Marshall Preston says. "Tell Miss Phyllis
Richie that with my last breath I ask her forgiveness for getting
Philly the Weeper to slug her jockey, Roy Snakes, and put him out
of business. She will find him in Harlem. Tell her I am also sorry
I put Washington and Lincoln, the only other jig jocks around,
under contract and send them away, but it is necessary for me to
win this stake and enough in bets to pay my wife in South Dakota
some back alimony I owe her."</p>

<p>And with this, Mr. Marshall Preston closes his eyes and starts
groaning again, and Eddie Yokum remembers about the race,
especially as the Honourable Bertie Searles is calling on him to
get up, and be a man, and keep going, so Eddie gets up and starts
looking around for Follow You, but Follow You is now standing with
his head hanging down, and when Eddie climbs on him again, Follow
You does not seem inclined for any further action, especially in
the way of making another jump.</p>

<p>Well, here is a predicament, to be sure, and as Eddie has no
previous experience with balky horses, he scarcely knows what to
do, especially as Follow You will not respond to kind words, or to
kicks in the stomach, which are advised by the Honourable Bertie
Searles, and in fact what does Follow You do but sit down there in
the middle of the course, and Eddie slides right off his tail.</p>

<p>Then Eddie runs around in front of Follow You to argue with him
face to face, and maybe give him a good yanking by the head, and
for the first time since the race starts, Follow You gets a good
look at who is riding him, and it seems that between the
perspiration that is running down Eddie's face from his efforts,
and falling into the water jump a couple of times, he is now no
longer a boogie, but mostly white, and Follow You is not only
startled but greatly insulted.</p>

<p>He starts scrambling to his feet at once, and Eddie Yokum is
just barely able to climb back on the horse by his mane before
Follow You starts running, taking the last jump again in wonderful
shape, and then tearing on down the home stretch to finish inside
the time limit as the winner of the race, and all that keeps Follow
You from continuing on around the course again is the fact that
Eddie falls off of him plumb exhausted.</p>

<p>Well, the excitement over this is very great, as Follow You's
victory saves the public's money, and they take Follow You to the
judge's stand, and put a blanket of roses on him, and Eddie Yokum
is also there, holding himself up by leaning against old Ike, when
Miss Phyllis Richie comes running up and starts kissing the rest of
the burnt cork off of Eddie's face right in front of everybody, and
speaking to him as follows:</p>

<p>"Oh," she says, "I recognize you when you come out of the water
jump the last time, and I say to myself, then and there, I know he
will win, because I remember your wonderful ride at the fox hunt. I
love you," she says.</p>

<p>Naturally, Eddie Yokum tells Miss Phyllis Richie that her love
is reciprocated, and he does not mention to her that the ride she
speaks of at the fox hunt is negotiated on a motor-cycle, because
at this time there is further excitement, as it seems The Seldom
Seen Kid and Hot Horse Herbie and Big Reds find Philly the Weeper
up in the grandstand, and take him out back and give him quite a
going over for beating them out of their end of the reward money he
collects for the fox hounds, and also remove from his person a
batch of pawn-tickets for the jewellery and other valuables he
collects at the Oriole Hunts Club and converts into cash to bet on
Sweep Forward.</p>

<p>Philly the Weeper says Mr. Marshall Preston permits him to keep
the jewellery on condition he leaves a few articles in Eddie
Yokum's room, after making a business deal with Philly the Weeper
to take care of Roy Snakes in return for Mr. Marshall Preston's
kindness in not turning him over to the police when he finds him
collecting the knick-knacks.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marshall Preston is a hard guy," Philly the Weeper says.
"He tells me he starts out making love to Miss Phyllis Richie only
with the idea of conning her into withdrawing Follow You from this
race, so he can put over a big betting coup. But her having to have
a ziggaboo jock makes it easier for him. But only a very hard guy
will attempt to use love for such a base purpose," Philly the
Weeper says. "Can you imagine me trifling with the love of Miss
Lola Ledare in such a fashion?"</p>

<p>But Miss Lola Ledare says she is not going to give such a
scalawag as Philly the Weeper a chance to trifle with her love any
more, anyway, as she is much fonder of the Honourable Bertie
Searles; and The Seldom Seen Kid turns the pawn-tickets he takes
off Philly the Weeper over to Eddie Yokum, along with ten C's to
remove the articles from hock, although he does not mention the sum
of money he wins on Follow You with the ten C's.</p>

<p>It comes out that Mr. Marshall Preston is not too badly hurt,
after all, so everybody is happy all the way around; but naturally
Eddie Yokum is happiest of all, and he is standing around after the
races mentioning his happiness to Miss Phyllis Richie, when all of
a sudden he is seen to turn quite pale, and out of a clear sky, and
as tired as he is, he starts running, and a large guy is observed
running after him.</p>

<p>It is some hours before Miss Phyllis Richie sees Eddie Yokum to
kiss him again, and to inquire why he seems to be trying to avoid
one of her oldest and dearest Baltimore friends, Mr. Barker.</p>

<h2><a name="A_STORY_GOES_WITH_IT" id="A_STORY_GOES_WITH_IT">8. A
STORY GOES WITH IT</a>
</h2>

<p>ONE night I am in a gambling joint in Miami watching the crap
game and thinking what a nice thing it is, indeed, to be able to
shoot craps without having to worry about losing your potatoes.</p>

<p>Many of the high shots from New York and Detroit and St. Louis
and other cities are around the table, and there is quite some
action in spite of the hard times. In fact, there is so much action
that a guy with only a few bobs on him, such as me, will be
considered very impolite to be pushing into this game, because they
are packed in very tight around the table.</p>

<p>I am maybe three guys back from the table, and I am watching the
game by standing on tiptoe peeking over their shoulders, and all I
can hear is Goldie, the stick man, hollering money-money-money
every time some guy makes a number, so I can see the dice are very
warm indeed, and that the right betters are doing first-rate.</p>

<p>By and by a guy by the name of Guinea Joe, out of Trenton, picks
up the dice and starts making numbers right and left, and I know
enough about this Guinea Joe to know that when he starts making
numbers anybody will be very foolish indeed not to follow his hand,
although personally I am generally a wrong better against the dice,
if I bet at all.</p>

<p>Now all I have in my pocket is a sawbuck, and the hotel stakes
are coming up on me the next day, and I need this saw, but with
Guinea Joe hotter than a forty-five it will be overlooking a big
opportunity not to go along with him, so when he comes out on an
eight, which is a very easy number for Joe to make when he is hot,
I dig up my sawbuck, and slide it past the three guys in front of
me to the table, and I say to Lefty Park, who is laying against the
dice, as follows:</p>

<p>"I will take the odds, Lefty."</p>

<p>Well, Lefty looks at my sawbuck and nods his head, for Lefty is
not such a guy as will refuse any bet, even though it is as modest
as mine, and right away Goldie yells money-money-money, so there I
am with twenty-two dollars.</p>

<p>Next Guinea Joe comes out on a nine, and naturally I take thirty
to twenty for my sugar, because nine is nothing for Joe to make
when he is hot. He makes the nine just as I figure, and I take two
to one for my half a yard when he starts looking for a ten, and
when he makes the ten I am right up against the table, because I am
now a guy with means.</p>

<p>Well, the upshot of the whole business is that I finally find
myself with three hundred bucks, and when it looks as if the dice
are cooling off, I take out and back off from the table, and while
I am backing off I am trying to look like a guy who loses all his
potatoes, because there are always many wolves waiting around crap
games and one thing and another in Miami this season, and what they
are waiting for is to put the bite on anybody who happens to make a
little scratch.</p>

<p>In fact, nobody can remember when the bite is as painful as it
is in Miami this season, what with the unemployment situation among
many citizens who come to Miami expecting to find work in the
gambling joints, or around the race track. But almost as soon as
these citizens arrive, the gambling joints are all turned off,
except in spots, and the bookmakers are chased off the track and
the mutuels put in, and the consequences are the suffering is most
intense. It is not only intense among the visiting citizens, but it
is quite intense among the Miami landlords, because naturally if a
citizen is not working, nobody can expect him to pay any room rent,
but the Miami landlords do not seem to understand this situation,
and are very unreasonable about their room rent.</p>

<p>Anyway, I back through quite a crowd without anybody biting me,
and I am commencing to figure I may escape altogether and get to my
hotel and hide my dough before the news gets around that I win
about five G's, which is what my winning is sure to amount to by
the time the rumour reaches all quarters of the city.</p>

<p>Then, just as I am thinking I am safe, I find I am looking a guy
by the name of Hot Horse Herbie in the face, and I can tell from
Hot Horse Herbie's expression that he is standing there watching me
for some time, so there is no use in telling him I am washed out in
the game. In fact, I cannot think of much of anything to tell Hot
Horse Herbie that may keep him from putting the bite on me for at
least a few bobs, and I am greatly astonished when he does not
offer to bite me at all, but says to me like this:</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "I am certainly glad to see you make such a
nice score. I will be looking for you to-morrow at the track, and
will have some big news for you."</p>

<p>Then he walks away from me and I stand there with my mouth open
looking at him, as it is certainly a most unusual way for Herbie to
act. It is the first time I ever knew Herbie to walk away from a
chance to bite somebody, and I can scarcely understand such
actions, for Herbie is such a guy as will not miss a bite, even if
he does not need it.</p>

<p>He is a tall, thin guy, with a sad face and a long chin, and he
is called Hot Horse Herbie because he nearly always has a very hot
horse to tell you about. He nearly always has a horse that is so
hot it is fairly smoking, a hot horse being a horse that cannot
possibly lose a race unless it falls down dead, and while Herbie's
hot horses often lose without falling down dead, this does not keep
Herbie from coming up with others just as hot.</p>

<p>In fact, Hot Horse Herbie is what is called a hustler around the
race tracks, and his business is to learn about these hot horses,
or even just suspect about them, and then get somebody to bet on
them, which is a very legitimate business indeed, as Herbie only
collects a commission if the hot horses win, and if they do not win
Herbie just keeps out of sight awhile from whoever he gets to bet
on the hot horses. There are very few guys in this world who can
keep out of sight better than Hot Horse Herbie, and especially from
old Cap Duhaine, of the Pinkertons, who is always around pouring
cold water on hot horses.</p>

<p>In fact, Cap Duhaine, of the Pinkertons, claims that guys such
as Hot Horse Herbie are nothing but touts, and sometimes he heaves
them off the race track altogether, but of course Cap Duhaine is a
very unsentimental old guy and cannot see how such characters as
Hot Horse Herbie add to the romance of the turf.</p>

<p>Anyway, I escape from the gambling joint with all my scratch on
me, and hurry to my room and lock myself in for the night, and I do
not show up in public until along about noon the next day, when it
is time to go over to the coffee shop for my java. And of course by
this time the news of my score is all over town, and many guys are
taking dead aim at me.</p>

<p>But naturally I am now able to explain to them that I have to
wire most of the three yards I win to Nebraska to save my father's
farm from being seized by the sheriff, and while everybody knows I
do not have a father, and that if I do have a father I will not be
sending him money for such a thing as saving his farm, with times
what they are in Miami, nobody is impolite enough to doubt my word
except a guy by the name of Pottsville Legs, who wishes to see my
receipts from the telegraph office when I explain to him why I
cannot stake him to a double sawbuck.</p>

<p>I do not see Hot Horse Herbie until I get to the track, and he
is waiting for me right inside the grand-stand gate, and as soon as
I show up he motions me off to one side and says to me like
this:</p>

<p>"Now," Herbie says, "I am very smart indeed about a certain race
to-day. In fact," he says, "if any guy knowing what I know does not
bet all he can rake and scrape together on a certain horse, such a
guy ought to cut his own throat and get himself out of the way
forever. What I know," Herbie says, "is enough to shake the
foundations of this country if it gets out. Do not ask any
questions," he says, "but get ready to bet all the sugar you win
last night on this horse I am going to mention to you, and all I
ask you in return is to bet fifty on me. And," Herbie says, "kindly
do not tell me you leave your money in your other pants, because I
know you do not have any other pants."</p>

<p>"Now, Herbie," I say, "I do not doubt your information, because
I know you will not give out information unless it is well founded.
But," I say, "I seldom stand for a tip, and as for betting fifty
for you, you know I will not bet fifty even for myself if somebody
guarantees me a winner. So I thank you, Herbie, just the same," I
say, "but I must do without your tip," and with this I start
walking away.</p>

<p>"Now," Herbie says, "wait a minute. A story goes with it," he
says.</p>

<p>Well, of course this is a different matter entirely. I am such a
guy as will always listen to a tip on a horse if a story goes with
the tip. In fact, I will not give you a nickel for a tip without a
story, but it must be a first-class story, and most horse players
are the same way. In fact, there are very few horse players who
will not listen to a tip if a story goes with it, for this is the
way human nature is. So I turn and walk back to Hot Horse Herbie,
and say to him like this:</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "let me hear the story, Herbie."</p>

<p>"Now," Herbie says, dropping his voice away down low, in case
old Cap Duhaine may be around somewhere listening, "it is the third
race, and the horse is a horse by the name of Never Despair. It is
a boat race," Herbie says. "They are going to shoo in Never
Despair. Everything else in the race is a cooler," he says.</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "this is just an idea, Herbie, and not a
story."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Herbie says. "The story that goes with it is a
very strange story indeed. In fact," he says, "it is such a story
as I can scarcely believe myself, and I will generally believe
almost any story, including," he says, "the ones I make up out of
my own head. Anyway, the story is as follows:</p>

<p>"Never Despair is owned by an old guy by the name of Seed
Mercer," Herbie says. "Maybe you remember seeing him around. He
always wears a black slouch hat and grey whiskers," Herbie says,
"and he is maybe a hundred years old, and his horses are very
terrible horses indeed. In fact," Herbie says, "I do not remember
seeing any more terrible horses in all the years I am around the
track, and," Herbie says, "I wish to say I see some very terrible
horses indeed.</p>

<p>"Now," Herbie says, "old Mercer has a grand-daughter who is
maybe sixteen years old, come next grass, by the name of Lame
Louise, and she is called Lame Louise because she is all crippled
up from childhood by infantile what-is-this, and can scarcely
navigate, and," Herbie says, "her being crippled up in such a way
makes old Mercer feel very sad, for she is all he has in the world,
except these terrible horses."</p>

<p>"It is a very long story, Herbie," I say, "and I wish to see Moe
Shapoff about a very good thing in the first race."</p>

<p>"Never mind Moe Shapoff," Herbie says. "He will only tell you
about a bum by the name of Zachary in the first race, and Zachary
has no chance whatever. I make Your John a stand-out in the first,"
he says.</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "let us forget the first and get on with your
story, although it is commencing to sound all mixed up to me."</p>

<p>"Now," Herbie says, "it not only makes old man Mercer very sad
because Lame Louise is all crippled up, but," he says, "it makes
many of the jockeys and other guys around the race track very sad,
because," he says, "they know Lame Louise since she is so high, and
she always has a smile for them, and especially for Jockey Scroon.
In fact," Herbie says, "Jockey Scroon is even more sad about Lame
Louise than old man Mercer, because Jockey Scroon loves Lame
Louise."</p>

<p>"Why," I say, very indignant, "Jockey Scroon is nothing but a
little burglar. Why," I say, "I see Jockey Scroon do things to
horses I bet on that he will have to answer for on the Judgment
Day, if there is any justice at such a time. Why," I say, "Jockey
Scroon is nothing but a Gerald Chapman in his heart, and so are all
other jockeys."</p>

<p>"Yes," Hot Horse Herbie says, "what you say is very, very true,
and I am personally in favour of the electric chair for all
jockeys, but," he says, "Jockey Scroon loves Lame Louise just the
same, and is figuring on making her his ever-loving wife when he
gets a few bobs together, which," Herbie says, "makes Louise eight
to five in my line to be an old maid. Jockey Scroon rooms with me
downtown," Herbie says, "and he speaks freely to me about his love
for Louise. Furthermore," Herbie says, "Jockey Scroon is personally
not a bad little guy, at that, although of course being a jockey he
is sometimes greatly misunderstood by the public.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Hot Horse Herbie says, "I happen to go home early last
night before I see you at the gambling joint, and I hear voices
coming out of my room, and naturally I pause outside the door to
listen, because for all I know it may be the landlord speaking
about the room rent, although," Herbie says, "I do not figure my
landlord to be much worried at this time because I see him sneak
into my room a few days before and take a lift at my trunk to make
sure I have belongings in the same, and it happens I nail the trunk
to the floor beforehand, so not being able to lift it, the landlord
is bound to figure me a guy with property.</p>

<p>"These voices," Herbie says, "are mainly soprano voices, and at
first I think Jockey Scroon is in there with some dolls, which is
by no means permissible in my hotel, but, after listening awhile, I
discover they are the voices of young boys, and I make out that
these boys are nothing but jockeys, and they are the six jockeys
who are riding in the third race, and they are fixing up this race
to be a boat race, and to shoo in Never Despair, which Jockey
Scroon is riding.</p>

<p>"And," Hot Horse Herbie says, "the reason they are fixing up
this boat race is the strangest part of the story. It seems," he
says, "that Jockey Scroon hears old man Mercer talking about a
great surgeon from Europe who is a shark on patching up cripples
such as Lame Louise, and who just arrives at Palm Beach to spend
the winter, and old man Mercer is saying how he wishes he has dough
enough to take Lame Louise to this guy so he can operate on her,
and maybe make her walk good again.</p>

<p>"But of course," Herbie says, "it is well known to one and all
that old man Mercer does not have a quarter, and that he has no way
of getting a quarter unless one of his terrible horses accidentally
wins a purse. So," Herbie says, "it seems these jockeys get to
talking it over among themselves, and they figure it will be a nice
thing to let old man Mercer win a purse such as the thousand bucks
that goes with the third race to-day, so he can take Lame Louise to
Palm Beach, and now you have a rough idea of what is coming
off.</p>

<p>"Furthermore," Herbie says, "these jockeys wind up their meeting
by taking a big oath among themselves that they will not tell a
living soul what is doing so nobody will bet on Never Despair,
because," he says, "these little guys are smart enough to see if
there is any betting on such a horse there may be a very large
squawk afterwards. And," he says, "I judge they keep their oath
because Never Despair is twenty to one in the morning line, and I
do not hear a whisper about him, and you have the tip all to
yourself."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "so what?" For this story is now commencing to
make me a little tired, especially as I hear the bell for the first
race, and I must see Moe Shapoff.</p>

<p>"Why," Hot Horse Herbie says, "so you bet every nickel you can
rake and scrape together on Never Despair, including the twenty you
are to bet for me for giving you this tip and the story that goes
with it."</p>

<p>"Herbie," I say, "it is a very interesting story indeed, and
also very sad, but," I say, "I am sorry it is about a horse Jockey
Scroon is to ride, because I do not think I will ever bet on
anything Jockey Scroon rides if they pay off in advance. And," I
say, "I am certainly not going to bet twenty for you or anybody
else."</p>

<p>"Well," Hot Horse Herbie says, "I will compromise with you for a
pound note, because I must have something going for me on this boat
race."</p>

<p>So I give Herbie a fiver, and the chances are this is about as
strong as he figures from the start, and I forget all about his tip
and the story that goes with it, because while I enjoy a story with
a tip, I feel that Herbie overdoes this one.</p>

<p>Anyway, no handicapper alive can make Never Despair win the
third race off the form, because this face is at six furlongs, and
there is a barrel of speed in it, and anybody can see that old man
Mercer's horse is away over his head. In fact, The Dancer tells me
that any one of the other five horses in this race can beat Never
Despair doing anything from playing hockey to putting the shot, and
everybody else must think the same thing because Never Despair goes
to forty to one.</p>

<p>Personally, I like a horse by the name of Loose Living, which is
a horse owned by a guy by the name of Bill Howard, and I hear Bill
Howard is betting plenty away on his horse, and any time Bill
Howard is betting away on his horse a guy will be out of his mind
not to bet on this horse, too, as Bill Howard is very smart indeed.
Loose Living is two to one in the first line, but by and by I judge
the money Bill Howard bets away commences to come back to the
track, and Loose Living winds up seven to ten, and while I am
generally not a seven-to-ten guy, I can see that here is a
proposition I cannot overlook.</p>

<p>So, naturally, I step up to the mutuel window and invest in
Loose Living. In fact, I invest everything I have on me in the way
of scratch, amounting to a hundred and ten bucks, which is all I
have left after taking myself out of the hotel stakes and giving
Hot Horse Herbie the finnif, and listening to what Moe Shapoff has
to say about the first race, and also getting beat a snoot in the
second.</p>

<p>When I first step up to the window, I have no idea of betting
all my scratch on Loose Living, but while waiting in line there I
get to thinking what a cinch Loose Living is, and how seldom such
an opportunity comes into a guy's life, so I just naturally set it
all in.</p>

<p>Well, this is a race which will be remembered by one and all to
their dying day, as Loose Living beats the barrier a step, and is
two lengths in front before you can say, Jack Robinson, with a
third by the name of Callipers second by maybe half a length, and
with the others bunched except Never Despair, and where is Never
Despair but last, where he figures.</p>

<p>Now any time Loose Living busts on top there is no need worrying
any more about him, and I am thinking I better get in line at the
payoff window right away, so I will not have to wait long to
collect my sugar. But I figure I may as well stay and watch the
race, although personally I am never much interested in watching
races. I am interested only in how a race comes out.</p>

<p>As the horses hit the turn into the stretch, Loose Living is
just breezing, and anybody can see that he is going to laugh his
way home from there. Callipers is still second, and a thing called
Goose Pimples is third, and I am surprised to see that Never
Despair now struggles up to fourth with Jockey Scroon belting away
at him with his bat quite earnestly. Furthermore, Never Despair
seems to be running very fast, though afterwards I figure this may
be because the others are commencing to run very slow.</p>

<p>Anyway, a very strange spectacle now takes place in the stretch,
as all of a sudden Loose Living seems to be stopping, as if he is
waiting for a street cab, and what is all the more remarkable
Callipers and Goose Pimples also seem to be hanging back, and the
next thing anybody knows, here comes Jockey Scroon on Never Despair
sneaking through on the rail, and personally it looks to me as if
the jock on Callipers moves over to give Jockey Scroon plenty of
elbow room, but of course the jockey on Callipers may figure Jockey
Scroon has diphtheria, and does not wish to catch it.</p>

<p>Loose Living is out in the middle of the track, anyway, so he
does not have to move over. All Loose Living has to do is to keep
on running backwards as he seems to be doing from the top of the
stretch, to let Jockey Scroon go past on Never Despair to win the
heat by a length.</p>

<p>Well, the race is practically supernatural in many respects, and
the judges are all upset over it, and they haul all the jocks up in
the stand and ask them many questions, and not being altogether
satisfied with the answers, they ask these questions over several
times. But all the jocks will say is that Never Despair sneaks past
them very unexpectedly indeed, while Jockey Scroon, who is a pretty
fresh duck at that, wishes to know if he is supposed to blow a horn
when he is slipping through a lot of guys sound asleep.</p>

<p>But the judges are still not satisfied, so they go prowling
around investigating the betting, because naturally when a boat
race comes up there is apt to be some reason for it, such as the
betting, but it seems that all the judges find is that one
five-dollar win ticket is sold on Never Despair in the mutuels, and
they cannot learn of a dime being bet away on the horse. So there
is nothing much the judges can do about the proposition, except
give the jocks many hard looks, and the jocks are accustomed to
hard looks from the judges, anyway.</p>

<p>Personally, I am greatly upset by this business, especially when
I see that Never Despair pays $86.34, and for two cents I will go
right up in the stand and start hollering copper on these little
Jesse Jameses for putting on such a boat race and taking all my
hard-earned potatoes away from me, but before I have time to do
this, I run into The Dancer, and he tells me that Dedicate in the
next race is the surest thing that ever goes to the post, and at
five to one, at that. So I have to forget everything while I bustle
about to dig up a few bobs to bet on Dedicate, and when Dedicate is
beat a whisker, I have to do some more bustling to dig up a few
bobs to bet on Vesta in the fifth, and by this time the third race
is such ancient history that nobody cares what happens in it.</p>

<p>It is nearly a week before I see Hot Horse Herbie again, and I
figure he is hiding out on everybody because he has this dough he
wins on the fiver I give him, and personally I consider him a guy
with no manners not to be kicking back the fin, at least. But
before I can mention the fin, Herbie gives me a big hello, and says
to me like this:</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "I just see Jockey Scroon, and Jockey Scroon
just comes back from Palm Beach, and the operation is a big
success, and Lame Louise will walk as good as anybody again, and
old Mercer is tickled silly. But," Herbie says, "do not say
anything out loud, because the judges may still be trying to find
out what comes off in the race."</p>

<p>"Herbie," I say, very serious, "do you mean to say the story you
tell me about Lame Louise, and all this and that, the other day is
on the level?"</p>

<p>"Why," Herbie says, "certainly it is on the level, and I am
sorry to hear you do not take advantage of my information. But," he
says, "I do not blame you for not believing my story, because it is
a very long story for anybody to believe. It is not such a story,"
Herbie says, "as I will tell to anyone if I expect them to believe
it. In fact," he says, "it is so long a story that I do not have
the heart to tell it to anybody else but you, or maybe I will have
something running for me on the race.</p>

<p>"But," Herbie says, "never mind all this. I will be plenty smart
about a race to-morrow. Yes," Herbie says, "I will be wiser than a
treeful of owls, so be sure and see me if you happen to have any
coconuts."</p>

<p>"There is no danger of me seeing you," I say, very sad, because
I am all sorrowed up to think that the story he tells me is really
true. "Things are very terrible with me at this time," I say, "and
I am thinking maybe you can hand me back my finnif, because you
must do all right for yourself with the fiver you have on Never
Despair at such a price."</p>

<p>Now a very strange look comes over Hot Horse Herbie's face, and
he raises his right hand, and says to me like this:</p>

<p>"I hope and trust I drop down dead right here in front of you,"
Herbie says, "if I bet a quarter on the horse. It is true," he
says, "I am up at the window to buy a ticket on Never Despair, but
the guy who is selling the tickets is a friend of mine by the name
of Heeby Rosenbloom, and Heeby whispers to me that Big Joe Gompers,
the guy who owns Callipers, just bets half a hundred on his horse,
and," Herbie says, "I know Joe Gompers is such a guy as will not
bet half a hundred on anything he does not get a Federal Reserve
guarantee with it.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Herbie says, "I get to thinking about what a bad
jockey this Jockey Scroon is, which is very bad indeed, and," he
says, "I figure that even if it is a boat race it is no even-money
race they can shoo him in, so I buy a ticket on Callipers."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "somebody buys one five-dollar ticket on Never
Despair, and I figure it can be nobody but you."</p>

<p>"Why," Hot Horse Herbie says, "do you not hear about this? Why,"
he says, "Cap Duhaine, of the Pinkertons, traces this ticket and
finds it is bought by a guy by the name of Steve Harter, and the
way this guy Harter comes to buy it is very astonishing. It seems,"
Herbie says, "that this Harter is a tourist out of Indiana who
comes to Miami for the sunshine, and who loses all his dough but
six bucks against the faro bank at Hollywood.</p>

<p>"At the same time," Herbie says, "the poor guy gets a telegram
from his ever-loving doll back in Indiana saying she no longer
wishes any part of him.</p>

<p>"Well," Herbie says, "between losing his dough and his doll, the
poor guy is practically out of his mind, and he figures there is
nothing left for him to do but knock himself off.</p>

<p>"So," Herbie says, "this Harter spends one of his six bucks to
get to the track, figuring to throw himself under the feet of the
horses in the first race and let them kick him to a jelly. But he
does not get there until just as the third race is coming up and,"
Herbie says, "he sees this name 'Never Despair', and he figures it
may be a hunch, so he buys himself a ticket with his last fiver.
Well, naturally," Herbie says, "when Never Despair pops down, the
guy forgets about letting the horses kick him to a jelly, and he
keeps sending his dough along until he runs nothing but a nubbin
into six G's on the day.</p>

<p>"Then," Herbie says, "Cap Duhaine finds out that the guy, still
thinking of Never Despair, calls his ever-loving doll on the phone,
and finds she is very sorry she sends him the wire and that she
really loves him more than somewhat, especially," Herbie says,
"when she finds out about the six G's. And the last anybody hears
of the matter, this Harter is on his way home to get married, so
Never Despair does quite some good in this wicked old world, after
all.</p>

<p>"But," Herbie says, "let us forget all this, because to-morrow
is another day. To-morrow," he says, "I will tell you about a thing
that goes in the fourth which is just the same as wheat in the bin.
In fact," Hot Horse Herbie says, "if it does not win, you can never
speak to me again."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, as I start to walk away, "I am not interested in
any tip at this time."</p>

<p>"Now," Herbie says, "wait a minute. A story goes with it."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, coming back to him, "let me hear the story."</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="BROADWAY_COMPLEX" id="BROADWAY_COMPLEX">9. BROADWAY
COMPLEX</a>
</h2>

<p>It is along towards four o'clock one morning, and I am sitting
in Mindy's restaurant on Broadway with Ambrose Hammer, the
newspaper scribe, enjoying a sturgeon sandwich, which is wonderful
brain food, and listening to Ambrose tell me what is wrong with the
world, and I am somewhat discouraged by what he tells me, for
Ambrose is such a guy as is always very pessimistic about
everything.</p>

<p>He is especially very pessimistic about the show business, as
Ambrose is what is called a dramatic critic, and he has to go
around nearly every night and look at the new plays that people are
always putting in the theatres, and I judge from what Ambrose says
that this is a very great hardship, and that he seldom gets much
pleasure out of life.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I judge from what Ambrose tells me that there is no
little danger in being a dramatic critic, because it seems that
only a short time before this he goes to a play that is called
Never-Never, and Ambrose says it is a very bad play, indeed, and he
so states in his newspaper, and in fact Ambrose states in his
newspaper that the play smells in nine different ways, and that so
does the acting of the leading man, a guy by the name of Fergus
Appleton.</p>

<p>Well, the next day Ambrose runs into this Fergus Appleton in
front of the Hotel Astor, and what does Fergus Appleton do but haul
off and belt Ambrose over the noggin with a cane, and ruin a nice
new fall derby for Ambrose, and when Ambrose puts in an expense
account to his newspaper for this kady they refuse to pay it, so
Ambrose is out four bobs.</p>

<p>And anyway, Ambrose says, the theatregoing public never
appreciates what a dramatic critic does for it, because it seems
that even though he tips the public off that Never-Never is
strictly a turkey, it is a great success, and, moreover, Fergus
Appleton is now going around with a doll who is nobody but Miss
Florentine Fayette, the daughter of old Hannibal Fayette.</p>

<p>And anybody will tell you that old Hannibal Fayette is very,
very, very rich, and has a piece of many different propositions,
including the newspaper that Ambrose Hammer works for, although of
course at the time Ambrose speaks of Fergus Appleton's acting, he
has no idea Fergus is going to wind up going around with Miss
Florentine Fayette.</p>

<p>So Ambrose says the chances are his newspaper will give him the
heave-o as soon as Fergus Appleton gets the opportunity to drop the
zing in on him, but Ambrose says he does not care a cuss as he is
writing a play himself that will show the theatre-going public what
a real play is.</p>

<p>Well, Ambrose is writing this play ever since I know him, which
is a matter of several years, and he tells me about it so often
that I can play any part in it myself with a little practice, and
he is just getting around to going over his first act with me again
when in comes a guy by the name of Cecil Earl, who is what is
called a master of ceremonies at the Golden Slipper night club.</p>

<p>Personally, I never see Cecil Earl but once or twice before in
my life, and he always strikes me as a very quiet and modest young
guy, for a master of ceremonies, and I am greatly surprised at the
way he comes in, as he is acting very bold and aggressive towards
one and all, and is speaking out loud in a harsh, disagreeable tone
of voice, and in general is acting like a guy who is looking for
trouble, which is certainly no way for a master of ceremonies to
act.</p>

<p>But of course if a guy is looking for trouble on Broadway along
towards four o'clock in the morning, anybody will tell you that the
right address is nowhere else but Mindy's, because at such an hour
many citizens are gathered there, and are commencing to get a
little cross wondering where they are going to make a scratch for
the morrow's operations, such as playing the horses.</p>

<p>It is a sure thing that any citizen who makes his scratch before
four o'clock in the morning is at home getting his rest, so he will
arise fully refreshed for whatever the day may bring forth, and
also to avoid the bite he is apt to encounter in Mindy's from
citizens who do not make a scratch.</p>

<p>However, the citizens who are present the morning I am speaking
of do not pay much attention to Cecil Earl when he comes in, as he
is nothing but a tall, skinny young guy, with slick black hair,
such as you are apt to see anywhere along Broadway at any time,
especially standing in front of theatrical booking offices. In
fact, to look at Cecil you will bet he is maybe a saxophone player,
as there is something about him that makes you think of a saxophone
player right away and, to tell the truth, Cecil can tootle a pretty
fair sax, at that, if the play happens to come up.</p>

<p>Well, Cecil sits down at a table where several influential
citizens are sitting, including Nathan Detroit, who runs the crap
game, and Big Nig, the crap shooter, and Regret, the horse player,
and Upstate Red, who is one of the best faro bank players in the
world whenever he can find a faro bank and something to play it
with, and these citizens are discussing some very serious matters,
when out of a clear sky Cecil ups and speaks to them as
follows:</p>

<p>"Listen," Cecil says, "if youse guys do not stop making so much
noise, I may cool you all off."</p>

<p>Well, naturally, this is most repulsive language to use to such
influential citizens, and furthermore it is very illiterate to say
youse, so without changing the subject Nathan Detroit reaches out
and picks up an order for ham and eggs, Southern style, that
Charley, the waiter, just puts in front of Upstate Red, and taps
Cecil on the onion with same.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate for Cecil that Nathan Detroit does not remove
the ham and eggs, Southern style, from the platter before tapping
Cecil with the order, because it is a very hard platter, and Cecil
is knocked as stiff as a plank, and maybe stiffer, and it becomes
necessary to summon old Doctor Moggs to bring him back to life.</p>

<p>Well, of course none of us know that Cecil is at the moment Jack
Legs Diamond, or Mad Dog Coll, or some other very tough gorill, and
in fact this does not come out until Ambrose Hammer later starts in
investigating the strange actions of Cecil Earl, and then Nathan
Detroit apologizes to Cecil, and also to the chef in Mindy's for
treating an order of ham and eggs, Southern style, so
disrespectfully.</p>

<p>It comes out that Cecil is subject to spells of being somebody
else besides Cecil Earl, and Ambrose Hammer gives us a very long
explanation of this situation, only Ambrose finally becomes so
scientific that nobody can keep cases on him. But we gather in a
general way from what Ambrose says that Cecil Earl is very
susceptible to suggestion from anything he reads, or is told.</p>

<p>In fact, Ambrose says he is the most susceptible guy of this
kind he ever meets up with in his life, and it seems that when he
is going to Harvard College, which is before he starts in being a
dramatic critic, Ambrose makes quite a study of these matters.</p>

<p>Personally, I always claim that Cecil Earl is a little screwy,
or if he is not screwy that he will do very well as a pinch-hitter
until a screwy guy comes to bat, but Ambrose Hammer says no.
Ambrose says it is true that Cecil may be bobbing a trifle, but
that he is by no means entirely off his nut. Ambrose says that
Cecil only has delusions of grandeur, and complexes, and I do not
know what all else, but Ambrose says it is 9 to 10 and take your
pick whether Cecil is a genius or a daffydill.</p>

<p>Ambrose says that Cecil is like an actor playing a different
part every now and then, only Cecil tries to live every part he
plays, and Ambrose claims that if we have actors with as much sense
as Cecil in playing parts, the show business will be a lot better
off. But of course Ambrose cares very little for actors since
Fergus Appleton ruins his kady.</p>

<p>Well, the next time I see Cecil he comes in Mindy's again, and
this time it seems he is Jack Dempsey, and while ordinarily nobody
will mind him being Jack Dempsey, or even Gene Tunney, although he
is not the type for Gene Tunney, Cecil takes to throwing left hooks
at citizens' chins, so finally Sam the Singer gets up and lets a
right hand go inside a left hook, and once more Cecil folds up like
an old accordion.</p>

<p>When I speak of this to Ambrose Hammer, he says that being Jack
Dempsey is entirely a false complex for Cecil, brought on mainly by
Cecil taking a few belts at the Golden Slipper liquor during the
evening. In fact, Ambrose says this particular complex does not
count. But I notice that after this Cecil is never anybody very
brash when he is around Mindy's.</p>

<p>Sometimes he is somebody else besides Cecil Earl for as long as
a week at a stretch, and in fact once he is Napoleon for two whole
weeks, but Ambrose Hammer says this is nothing. Ambrose says he
personally knows guys who are Napoleon all their lives. But of
course Ambrose means that these guys are only Napoleons in their
own minds. He says that the only difference between Cecil and them
is that Cecil's complex breaks out on him in public, while the
other guys are Napoleons only in their own bedrooms.</p>

<p>Personally, I think such guys are entitled to be locked up in
spots with high walls around and about, but Ambrose seems to make
nothing much of it, and anyway this Cecil Earl is as harmless as a
bag of marshmallows, no matter who he is being.</p>

<p>One thing I must say for Cecil Earl, he is nearly always an
interesting guy to talk to, because he nearly always has a
different personality, and in fact the only time he is
uninteresting is when he is being nobody but Cecil Earl. Then he is
a very quiet guy with a sad face and he is so bashful and retiring
that you will scarcely believe he is the same guy who goes around
all one week being Mussolini in his own mind.</p>

<p>Now I wish to say that Cecil Earl does not often go around
making any public display of these spells of his, except when the
character calls for a display, such as the time he is George
Bernard Shaw, and in fact unless you know him personally you may
sometimes figure him just a guy sitting back in a corner somewhere
with nothing whatever on his mind, and you will never even suspect
that you are in the presence of J. Pierpont Morgan studying out a
way to make us all rich.</p>

<p>It gets so that nobody resents Cecil being anything he pleases,
except once when he is Senator Huey Long, and once when he is
Hitler, and makes the mistake of wandering down on the lower East
Side and saying so. In fact, it gets so everybody along Broadway
puts in with him and helps him be whoever he is, as much as
possible, although I always claim he has a bad influence on some
citizens, for instance Regret, the horse player.</p>

<p>It seems that Regret catches a complex off of Cecil Earl one
day, and for twenty-four hours he is Pittsburgh Phil, the race
track plunger, and goes overboard with every bookie down at Belmont
Park and has to hide out for some time before he can get himself
straightened out.</p>

<p>Now Cecil Earl is a good master of ceremonies in a night club,
if you care for masters of ceremonies, a master of ceremonies in a
night club being a guy who is supposed to make cute cracks, and to
introduce any celebrities who happen to be sitting around the
joint, such as actors and prominent merchants, so the other
customers can give them a big hand, and this is by no means an easy
job, as sometimes a master of ceremonies may overlook a celebrity,
and the celebrity becomes terribly insulted.</p>

<p>But it seems that Cecil Earl is smart enough to introduce all
the people in the Golden Slipper every night and call for a big
hand for them, no matter who they are, so nobody can get insulted,
although one night he introduces a new head waiter, thinking he is
nothing but a customer, and the head waiter is somewhat insulted,
at that, and threatens to quit, because he claims being introduced
in a night club is no boost for him.</p>

<p>Anyway, Cecil gets a nice piece of money for being master of
ceremonies at the Golden Slipper, and when he is working there his
complexes do not seem to bother him very much, and he is never
anybody more serious than Harry Richman or Mort Downey. And it is
at the Golden Slipper that he meets this guy, Fergus Appleton, and
Miss Florentine Fayette.</p>

<p>Now Miss Florentine Fayette is a tall, slim, black-haired doll,
and so beautiful she is practically untrue, but she has a kisser
that never seems to relax, and furthermore she never seems much
interested in anything whatever. In fact, if Miss Florentine
Fayette's papa does not have so many cucumbers, I will say she is
slightly dumb, but for all I know it may be against the law to say
a doll whose papa has all these cucumbers is dumb. So I will only
say that she does not strike me as right bright.</p>

<p>She is a great hand for going around night clubs and sitting
there practically unconscious for hours at a time, and always this
Fergus Appleton is with her, and before long it gets around that
Fergus Appleton wishes to make Miss Florentine Fayette his
ever-loving wife, and everybody admits that it will be a very nice
score, indeed, for an actor.</p>

<p>Personally, I see nothing wrong with this situation because, to
tell you the truth, I will just naturally love to make Miss
Florentine Fayette my own ever-loving wife if her papa's cucumbers
go with it, but of course Ambrose Hammer does not approve of the
idea of her becoming Fergus Appleton's wife, because Ambrose can
see how it may work out to his disadvantage.</p>

<p>This Fergus Appleton is a fine-looking guy of maybe forty, with
iron-grey hair that makes him appear very romantic, and he is
always well dressed in spats and one thing and another, and he
smokes cigarettes in a holder nearly a foot long, and wears a watch
on one wrist and a slave bracelet on the other, and a big ring on
each hand, and sometimes a monocle in one eye, although Ambrose
Hammer claims that this is strictly the old ackamarackuss.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Fergus Appleton is a very chesty guy, and
likes to pose around in public places, but I see maybe a million
guys like him in my time on Broadway, and not all of them are
actors, so I do not hate him for his posing, or for his slave
bracelet, or the monocle either, although naturally I consider him
out of line in busting my friend Ambrose Hammer's new derby, and I
promise Ambrose that the first time Fergus Appleton shows up in a
new derby, or even an old one, I will see that somebody busts it,
if I have to do it myself.</p>

<p>The only thing wrong I see about Fergus Appleton is that he is a
smart-Alecky guy, and when he first finds out about Cecil Earl's
complexes he starts working on them to amuse the guys and dolls who
hang out around the Golden Slipper with him and Miss Florentine
Fayette.</p>

<p>Moreover, it seems that somehow Cecil Earl is very susceptible,
indeed, to Fergus Appleton's suggestions, and for a while Fergus
Appleton makes quite a sucker of Cecil Earl.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden Fergus Appleton stops making a sucker of
Cecil, and the next thing anybody knows Fergus Appleton is becoming
quite pally with Cecil, and I see them around Mindy's, and other
late spots after the Golden Slipper closes, and sometimes Miss
Florentine Fayette is with them, although Cecil Earl is such a guy
as does not care much for the society of dolls, and in fact is very
much embarrassed when they are around, which is most surprising
conduct for a master of ceremonies in a night club, as such
characters are usually pretty fresh with dolls.</p>

<p>But of course even the freshest master of ceremonies is apt to
be a little bashful when such a doll as Miss Florentine Fayette is
around, on account of her papa having so many cucumbers, and when
she is present Cecil Earl seldoms opens his trap, but just sits
looking at her and letting Fergus Appleton do all the gabbing,
which suits Fergus Appleton fine, as he does not mind hearing
himself gab, and in fact loves it.</p>

<p>Sometimes I run into just Cecil Earl and Fergus Appleton, and
generally they have their heads close together, and are talking low
and serious, like two business guys with a large deal coming up
between them.</p>

<p>Furthermore I can see that Cecil Earl is looking very mysterious
and solemn himself, so I figure that maybe they are doping out a
new play together and that Cecil is acting one of the parts, and
whatever it is they are doing I consider it quite big-hearted of
Fergus Appleton to take such a friendly interest in Cecil.</p>

<p>But somehow Ambrose Hammer does not like it. In fact, Ambrose
Hammer speaks of the matter at some length to me, and says to me
like this:</p>

<p>"It is unnatural," he says. "It is unnatural for a guy like
Fergus Appleton, who is such a guy as never has a thought in the
world for anybody but himself, to be playing the warm for a guy
like Cecil Earl. There is something wrong in this business, and,"
Ambrose says, "I am going to find out what it is."</p>

<p>Well, personally I do not see where it is any of Ambrose
Hammer's put-in even if there is something wrong, but Ambrose is
always poking his beezer into other people's business, and he
starts watching Cecil and Fergus Appleton with great interest
whenever he happens to run into them.</p>

<p>Finally it comes an early Sunday morning, and Ambrose Hammer and
I are in Mindy's as usual, when in comes Cecil Earl all alone, with
a book under one arm. He sits down at a table in a corner booth all
by himself and orders a western sandwich and starts in to read his
book, and nothing will do Ambrose Hammer but for us to go over and
talk to Cecil.</p>

<p>When he sees us coming, he closes his book, and drops it in his
lap and gives us a very weak hello. It is the first time we see him
alone in quite a spell, and finally, Ambrose Hammer asks where is
Fergus Appleton, although Ambrose really does not care where he is,
unless it happens to turn out that he is in a pesthouse suffering
from smallpox.</p>

<p>Cecil says Fergus Appleton has to go over to Philadelphia on
business over the week-end, and then Ambrose asks Cecil where Miss
Florentine Fayette is, and Cecil says he does not know but supposes
she is home.</p>

<p>"Well," Ambrose Hammer says, "Miss Florentine Fayette is
certainly a beautiful doll, even if she does look a little bit
colder than I like them, but," he says, "what she sees in such a
pish-tush as Fergus Appleton I do not know."</p>

<p>Now at this Cecil Earl busts right out crying, and naturally
Ambrose Hammer and I are greatly astonished at such an exhibition,
because we do not see any occasion for tears, and personally I am
figuring on taking it on the Dan O'Leary away from there before
somebody gets to thinking we do Cecil some great wrong, when Cecil
speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"I love her," Cecil says. "I love her with all my heart and
soul. But she belongs to my best friend. For two cents I will take
this dagger that Fergus gives me and end it all, because life is
not worth living without Miss Florentine Fayette."</p>

<p>And with this Cecil Earl outs with a big long stabber, which is
a spectacle that is most disquieting to me as I know such articles
are against the law in this man's town. So I make Cecil put it
right back in his pocket and while I am doing this Ambrose Hammer
reaches down beside Cecil and grabs the book Cecil is reading, and
while Cecil is still sobbing Ambrose looks this volume over.</p>

<p>It turns out to be a book called The Hundred-Per-Cent-Perfect
Crime, but what interests Ambrose Hammer more than anything else is
a lead-pencil drawing on one of the blank pages in the front page
of the book. Afterwards Ambrose sketches this drawing out for me as
near as he can remember it on the back of one of Mindy's menu
cards, and it looks to me like the drawing of the ground floor of a
small house, with a line on one side on which is written the word
Menahan, and Ambrose says he figures this means a street.</p>

<p>But in the meantime Ambrose tries to soothe Cecil Earl and to
get him to stop crying, and when Cecil finally does dry up he sees
Ambrose has his book, and he makes a grab for it and creates quite
a scene until he gets it back.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot make head or tail of the sketch that
Ambrose draws for me, and I cannot see that there is anything to it
anyway, but Ambrose seems to regard it as of some importance.</p>

<p>Well, I do not see Ambrose Hammer for several days, but I am
hearing strange stories of him being seen with Cecil Earl in the
afternoons when Fergus Appleton is playing matinees in Never-Never,
and early in the evenings when Fergus Appleton is doing his night
performances, and I also hear that Ambrose always seems to be
talking very earnestly to Cecil Earl, and sometimes throwing his
arms about in a most excited manner.</p>

<p>Then one morning Ambrose Hammer looks me up again in Mindy's,
and he is smiling a very large smile, as if he is greatly pleased
with something, which is quite surprising as Ambrose Hammer is
seldom pleased with anything. Finally he says to me like this:</p>

<p>"Well," Ambrose says, "I learn the meaning of the drawing in
Cecil Earl's book. It is the plan of a house on Menahan Street,
away over in Brooklyn. And the way I learn this is very, very
clever, indeed," Ambrose says. "I stake a chambermaid to let me
into Fergus Appleton's joint in the Dazzy apartments, and what do I
find there just as I expect but a letter from a certain number on
this street?"</p>

<p>"Why," I say to Ambrose Hammer, "I am greatly horrified by your
statement. You are nothing but a burglar, and if Fergus Appleton
finds this out he will turn you over to the officers of the law,
and you will lose your job and everything else."</p>

<p>"No," Ambrose says, "I will not lose my job, because old
Hannibal Fayette is around the office yesterday raising an awful
row about his daughter wishing to marry an actor, and saying he
will give he does not know what if anybody can bust this romance
up. The chances are," Ambrose says, "he will make me editor in
chief of the paper, and then I will can a lot of guys I do not
like. Fergus Appleton is to meet Cecil Earl here this morning, and
in the meantime I will relate the story to you."</p>

<p>But before Ambrose can tell me the story, in comes Fergus
Appleton, and Miss Florentine Fayette is with him, and they sit
down at a table not far from us, and Fergus Appleton looks around
and sees Ambrose and gives him a terrible scowl. Furthermore, he
says something to Miss Florentine Fayette, and she looks at
Ambrose, too, but she does not scowl or anything else, but only
looks very dead-pan. Fergus Appleton is in evening clothes and has
on his monocle, and Miss Florentine Fayette is wearing such a gown
that anybody can see how beautiful she is, no matter if her face
does not have much expression. They are sitting there without much
conversation passing between them, when all of a sudden in walks
Cecil Earl, full of speed and much excited.</p>

<p>He comes in with such a rush that he almost flattens Regret, the
horse player, who is on his way out, and Regret is about to call
him a dirty name when he sees a spectacle that will always be
remembered in Mindy's, for Cecil Earl walks right over to Miss
Florentine Fayette as she is sitting there beside Fergus Appleton,
and without saying as much as boo to Fergus Appleton, Cecil grabs
Miss Florentine Fayette up in his arms with surprising strength and
gives her a big sizzling kiss, and says to her like this:</p>

<p>"Florentine," he says, "I love you."</p>

<p>Then he squeezes her to his bosom so tight that it looks as if
he is about to squeeze her right out through the top of her gown
like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube, and says to her again, as
follows:</p>

<p>"I love you. Oh, how I love you."</p>

<p>Well, at first Fergus Appleton is so astonished at this
proposition that he can scarcely stir, and the chances are he
cannot believe his eyes. Furthermore, many other citizens who are
present partaking of their Bismarck herring, and one thing and
another, are also astonished, and they are commencing to think that
maybe Cecil Earl is having a complex about being King Kong, when
Fergus Appleton finally gets to his feet and speaks in a loud tone
of voice as follows:</p>

<p>"Why," Fergus Appleton says, "you are nothing but a scurvy
fellow, and unless you unhand my fiancée, the chances are I will
annihilate you."</p>

<p>Naturally, Fergus Appleton is somewhat excited, and in fact he
is so excited that he drops his monocle to the floor, and it breaks
into several pieces. At first he seems to have some idea of
dropping a big right hand on Cecil Earl somewhere, but Cecil is
pretty well covered by Miss Florentine Fayette, so Fergus Appleton
can see that if he lets a right hand go he is bound to strike Miss
Florentine Fayette right where she lives.</p>

<p>So he only grabs hold of Miss Florentine Fayette, and tries to
pull her loose from Cecil Earl, and Cecil Earl not only holds her
tighter, but Miss Florentine Fayette seems to be doing some holding
to Cecil herself, so Fergus Appleton cannot peel her off, although
he gets one stocking and a piece of elastic strap from somewhere.
Then one and all are greatly surprised to hear Miss Florentine
Fayette speak to Fergus Appleton like this:</p>

<p>"Go away, you old porous plaster," Miss Florentine Fayette says.
"I love only my Cecil. Hold me tighter, Cecil, you great big bear,"
Miss Florentine Fayette says, although of course Cecil looks about
as much like a bear as Ambrose Hammer looks like a porcupine.</p>

<p>Well, of course there is great commotion in Mindy's, because
Cecil Earl is putting on a love scene such as makes many citizens
very homesick, and Fergus Appleton does not seem to know what to
do, when Ambrose Hammer gets to him and whispers a few words in his
ear, and all of a sudden Fergus Appleton turns and walks out of
Mindy's and disappears, and furthermore nobody ever sees him in
these parts again.</p>

<p>By and by Mindy himself comes up and tells Cecil Earl and Miss
Florentine Fayette that the chef is complaining because he cannot
seem to make ice in his refrigerator while they are in the joint,
and will they please go away. So Cecil Earl and Miss Florentine
Fayette go, and then Ambrose Hammer comes back to me and finishes
his story.</p>

<p>"Well," Ambrose says, "I go over to the certain number on
Menahan Street, and what do I find there but a crippled-up,
middle-aged doll who is nobody but Fergus Appleton's ever-loving
wife, and furthermore she is such for over twenty years. She tells
me that Fergus is the meanest guy that ever breathes the breath of
life, and that he is persecuting her for a long time in every way
he can think of because she will not give him a divorce.</p>

<p>"And," Ambrose says, "the reason she will not give him a divorce
is because he knocks her downstairs a long time ago, and makes her
a cripple for life, and leaves her to the care of her own people.
But of course I do not tell her," Ambrose says, "that she narrowly
escapes being murdered through him, for the meaning of the floor
plan of the house in Cecil's book, and the meaning of the book
itself, and of the dagger, is that Fergus Appleton is working on
Cecil Earl until he has him believing that he can be the
super-murderer of the age."</p>

<p>"Why," I say to Ambrose Hammer, "I'm greatly shocked by these
revelations. Why, Fergus Appleton is nothing but a fellow."</p>

<p>"Well," Ambrose says, "he is pretty cute, at that. He has Cecil
thinking that it will be a wonderful thing to be the guy who
commits the hundred-per-cent-perfect crime, and furthermore Fergus
promises to make Cecil rich after he marries Miss Florentine
Fayette."</p>

<p>"But," I say, "what I do not understand is what makes Cecil
become such a violent lover all of a sudden."</p>

<p>"Why," Ambrose Hammer says, "when Cecil lets it out that he
loves Miss Florentine Fayette, it gives me a nice clue to the whole
situation. I take Cecil in hand and give him a little coaching and,
furthermore, I make him a present of a book myself. He finds it
more interesting than anything Fergus Appleton gives him. In fact,"
Ambrose says, "I recommend it to you. When Cecil comes in here this
morning, he is not Cecil Earl, the potential Perfect Murderer. He
is nobody but the world's champion heavy lover, old Don Juan."</p>

<p>Well, Ambrose does not get to be editor in chief of his
newspaper. In fact, he just misses getting the outdoors, because
Cecil Earl and Miss Florentine Fayette elope, and get married, and
go out to Hollywood on a honeymoon, and never return, and old
Hannibal Fayette claims it is just as bad for his daughter to marry
a movie actor as a guy on the stage, even though Cecil turns out to
be the greatest drawing card on the screen because he can heat up
love scenes so good.</p>

<p>But I always say that Cecil Earl is quite an ingrate, because he
refuses a part in Ambrose Hammer's play when Ambrose finally gets
it written, and makes his biggest hit in a screen version of
Never-Never.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="SO_YOU_WONT_TALK" id="SO_YOU_WONT_TALK">10. SO YOU
WON'T TALK!</a>
</h2>

<p>It is along about two o'clock of a nippy Tuesday morning, and I
am sitting in Mindy's restaurant on Broadway with Regret, the horse
player, speaking of this and that, when who comes in but Ambrose
Hammer, the newspaper scribe, and what is he carrying in one hand
but a big bird cage, and what is in this bird cage but a green
parrot.</p>

<p>Well, if anybody sits around Mindy's restaurant long enough,
they are bound to see some interesting and unusual scenes, but this
is undoubtedly the first time that anybody cold sober ever
witnesses a green parrot in there, and Mindy, himself is by no
means enthusiastic about this spectacle.</p>

<p>In fact, as Ambrose Hammer places the cage on our table and then
sits down beside me, Mindy approaches us, and says to Ambrose:</p>

<p>"Horse players, yes," Mindy says. "Wrong bettors, yes. Dogs and
song writers and actors, yes. But parrots," Mindy says, "no. Take
it away," he says.</p>

<p>But Ambrose Hammer pays no attention to Mindy and starts
ordering a few delicacies of the season from Schmalz, the waiter,
and Mindy finally sticks his finger in the cage to scratch the
parrot's head, and goes cootch-cootch-cootch, and the next thing
anybody knows, Mindy is sucking his finger and yelling bloody
murder, as it seems the parrot starts munching on the finger as if
it is a pretzel.</p>

<p>Mindy is quite vexed indeed, and he says he will go out and
borrow a Betsy off of Officer Gloon and blow the parrot's brains
out, and he also says that if anybody will make it worth his while,
he may blow Ambrose Hammer's brains out, too.</p>

<p>"If you commit such a deed," Ambrose says, "you will be
arrested. I mean, blowing this parrot's brains out. This parrot is
a material witness in a murder case."</p>

<p>Well, this statement puts a different phase on the matter, and
Mindy goes away speaking to himself, but it is plain to be seen,
that his feelings are hurt as well as his finger, and personally,
if I am Ambrose Hammer, I will not eat anything in Mindy's again
unless I have somebody taste it first.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am very curious to know where Ambrose Hammer gets
the parrot, as he is not such a character as makes a practice of
associating with the birds and beasts of the forest, but of course
I do not ask any questions, as the best you can get from asking
questions along Broadway is a reputation for asking questions.</p>

<p>And of course I am wondering what Ambrose Hammer means by saying
this parrot is a material witness in a murder case, although I know
that Ambrose is always mixing himself up in murder cases, even when
they are really none of his put-in. In fact, Ambrose's hobby is
murder cases.</p>

<p>He is a short, pudgy character, of maybe thirty, with a round
face and googly eyes, and he is what is called a dramatic critic on
one of the morning blatters, and his dodge is to observe new plays
such as people are always putting on in the theatres and to tell
his readers what he thinks of these plays, although generally what
Ambrose Hammer really thinks of them is unfit for publication.</p>

<p>In fact, Ambrose claims the new plays are what drive him to an
interest in murder for relief. So he is always looking into crimes
of this nature, especially if they are mysterious cases, and trying
to solve these mysteries, and between doing this and telling what
he thinks of the new plays, Ambrose finds his time occupied no
little, and quite some.</p>

<p>He is a well-known character along Broadway, because he is
always in and out, and up and down, and around and about, but to
tell the truth, Ambrose is not so popular with the citizens around
Mindy's, because they figure that a character who likes to solve
murder mysteries must have a slight touch of copper in him which
will cause him to start investigating other mysteries at any
minute.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is a strong knockout on Ambrose in many
quarters because he is in love with Miss Dawn Astra, a very
beautiful young Judy who is playing the part of a strip dancer in a
musical show at the Summer Garden, and it is well known to one and
all that Miss Dawn Astra is the sweet pea of a character by the
name of Julius Smung, until Ambrose comes into her life, and that
Julius' heart is slowly breaking over her.</p>

<p>This Julius Smung is a sterling young character of maybe
twenty-two, who is in the taxicab business as a driver. He is the
son of the late Wingy Smung, who has his taxi stand in front of
Mindy's from 1922 down to the night in 1936 that he is checking up
the pockets of a sailor in Central Park to see if the sailor has
the right change for his taxi fare, and the sailor wakes up and
strikes Wingy on the head with Wingy's own jack handle, producing
concussion of the brain.</p>

<p>Well, when Wingy passes away, leaving behind him many sorrowing
friends, his son Julius takes his old stand, and naturally all who
know Wingy in life are anxious to see his son carry on his name, so
they throw all the taxicab business they can to him, and Julius
gets along very nicely.</p>

<p>He is a good-looking young character and quite energetic, and he
is most courteous to one and all, except maybe sailors,
consequently public sentiment is on his side when Ambrose Hammer
moves in on him with Miss Dawn Astra, especially as Miss Dawn Astra
is Julius Smung's sweet pea since they are children together over
on Tenth Avenue. Their romance is regarded as one of the most
beautiful little romances ever seen in this town. In fact there is
some talk that Julius Smung and Miss Dawn Astra will one day get
married, although it is agreed along Broadway that this may be
carrying romance a little too far.</p>

<p>Then Ambrose Hammer observes Miss Dawn Astra playing the part of
a strip dancer, and it is undoubtedly love at first sight on
Ambrose's part, and he expresses his love by giving Miss Dawn Astra
better write-ups in the blatter he works for than he ever gives
Miss Katharine Cornell, or even Mr. Noel Coward. In fact, to read
what Ambrose Hammer says about Miss Dawn Astra, you will think that
she is a wonderful artist indeed, and maybe she is, at that.</p>

<p>Naturally, Miss Dawn Astra reciprocates Ambrose Hammer's love,
because all the time she is Julius Smung's sweet pea, the best she
ever gets is a free taxi ride now and then, and Julius seldom
speaks of her as an artist. To tell the truth, Julius is always
beefing about her playing the part of a strip dancer, as he claims
it takes her too long to get her clothes back on when he is waiting
outside the Summer Garden for her, and the chances are Ambrose
Hammer is a pleasant change to Miss Dawn Astra as Ambrose does not
care if she never gets her clothes on.</p>

<p>Anyway, Miss Dawn Astra starts going around and about with
Ambrose Hammer, and Julius Smung is so downcast over this matter
that he scarcely knows what he is doing. In fact, inside of three
weeks, he runs through traffic lights twice on Fifth Avenue, and
once he almost drives his taxi off the Queensboro Bridge with three
passengers in it, although it comes out afterwards that Julius
thinks the passengers may be newspaper scribes, and nobody has the
heart to blame him for this incident.</p>

<p>There is much severe criticism of Ambrose Hammer among the
citizens around Mindy's restaurant, as they feel he is away out of
line in moving in on Julius Smung's sweet pea, when any one of a
hundred other Judys in this town will do him just as well and cause
no suffering to anybody, but Ambrose pays no attention to this
criticism.</p>

<p>Ambrose says he is very much in love with Miss Dawn Astra, and
he says that, besides, taxi-cab drivers get enough of the best of
it in this town as it is, although it is no secret that Ambrose
never gets into a taxi after he moves in on Julius Smung without
first taking a good look at the driver to make sure that he is not
Julius.</p>

<p>Well, by the time it takes me to explain all this, Miss Dawn
Astra comes into Mindy's, and I can see at once that Ambrose Hammer
is not to blame for being in love with her, and neither is Julius
Smung, for she is undoubtedly very choice indeed. She is one of
these tall, limber Judys, with a nice expression in her eyes and a
figure such as is bound to make anybody dearly love to see Miss
Dawn Astra play the part of a strip dancer.</p>

<p>Naturally, the first thing that attracts Miss Dawn Astra's
attention when she sits down at the table with us is the parrot in
the cage, and she says to Ambrose:</p>

<p>"Why, Ambrose," she says, "where does the parrot come from?"
"This parrot is a material witness," Ambrose says. "Through this
parrot I will solve the mystery of the murder of the late Mr.
Grafton Wilton."</p>

<p>Well, at this, Miss Dawn Astra seems to turn a trifle pale
around the gills, and she lets out a small gasp, and says:</p>

<p>"Grafton Wilton," she says, "Murdered?" she says. "When, and
where, and how?"</p>

<p>"Just a few hours ago," Ambrose says. "In his apartment on Park
Avenue. With a blunt instrument. This parrot is in the room at the
time. I arrive ten minutes after the police. There is a small
leopard there, too, also a raccoon and a couple of monkeys and
several dogs.</p>

<p>"The officers leave one of their number to take care of these
creatures," Ambrose says. "He is glad to let me remove the parrot,
because he does not care for birds. He does not realize the
importance of this parrot. In fact," Ambrose says, "this officer is
in favour of me removing all the livestock except the monkeys,
which he plans to take home to his children, but," Ambrose says,
"this parrot is all I require."</p>

<p>Well, I am somewhat surprised to hear this statement, as I am
acquainted with Grafton Wilton, and in fact, he is well known to
one and all along Broadway as a young character who likes to go
about spending the money his papa makes out of manufacturing soap
back down the years.</p>

<p>This Grafton Wilton is by no means an odious character, but he
is considered somewhat unusual in many respects, and in fact if his
family does not happen to have about twenty million dollars, there
is no doubt but what Grafton will be placed under observation long
ago. But, of course, nobody in this town is going to place anybody
with a piece of twenty million under observation.</p>

<p>This Grafton Wilton is quite a nature lover, and he is fond of
walking into spots leading a wild animal of some description on a
chain, or with a baboon sitting on his shoulder, and once he
appears in the 9-9 Club carrying a young skunk in his arms, which
creates some ado among the customers.</p>

<p>In fact, many citizens are included to censure Grafton for the
skunk, but the way I look at it, a character who spends his money
the way he does is entitled to come around with a boa-constrictor
in his pockets if he feels like it.</p>

<p>I am really somewhat depressed to hear of Grafton Wilton being
murdered, and I am sitting here wondering who will replace him in
the community, when all of a sudden Miss Dawn Astra says:</p>

<p>"I hate parrots," she says.</p>

<p>"So do I," I say. "Ambrose," I say, "why do you not bring us the
leopard? I am very fond of leopards."</p>

<p>"Anyway," Miss Dawn Astra says, "how can a parrot be a material
witness to anything, especially such a thing as a murder?"</p>

<p>"Look," Ambrose says. "Whoever kills Grafton Wilton must be on
very friendly terms with him, because every indication is that
Grafton and the murderer sit around the apartment all evening,
eating and drinking. And," Ambrose says, "anybody knows that
Grafton is always a very solitary character, and he seldom has
anybody around him under any circumstances. So it is a cinch he is
not entertaining a stranger in his apartment for hours.</p>

<p>"Grafton has two servants," Ambrose says. "A butler, and his
wife. He permits them to take the day off to go to Jersey to visit
relatives. Grafton and his visitor wait on themselves. A private
elevator that the passenger operates runs to Grafton's apartment.
No one around the building sees the visitor arrive or depart.</p>

<p>"In the course of the evening," Ambrose says, "the visitor
strikes Grafton down with a terrific blow from some blunt
instrument, and leaves him on the roof, dead. The deceased has two
black eyes and a badly lacerated nose. The servants find the body
when they arrive home late to-night. The weapon is missing. There
are no strange finger-prints anywhere around the apartment."</p>

<p>"It sounds like a very mysterious mystery, to be sure," I say.
"Maybe it is a stick-up, and Grafton Wilton resists."</p>

<p>"No," Ambrose says, "there is no chance that robbery is the
motive. There is a large sum of money in Grafton's pockets, and
thousands of dollars' worth of valuables scattered around, and
nothing is touched."</p>

<p>"But where does the parrot come in?" Miss Dawn Astra says.</p>

<p>"Well," Ambrose says, "if the murderer is well known to Grafton
Wilton, the chances are his name is frequently mentioned by Grafton
during the evening, in the presence of this parrot. Maybe it is
Sam. Maybe it is Bill or Frank or Joe. It is bound to be the name
of some male character," Ambrose says, "because no female can
possibly strike such a powerful blow as causes the death of Grafton
Wilton.</p>

<p>"Now then," Ambrose says, "parrots pick up names very quickly
and the chances are this parrot will speak the name he hears so
often in the apartment, and then we will have a clue to the
murderer. Maybe Grafton Wilton makes an outcry when he is struck
down, such as 'Oh, Henry,' or 'Oh, George.' This is bound to
impress the name on the parrot's mind," Ambrose says.</p>

<p>Naturally, after hearing Ambrose's statement, the parrot becomes
of more interest to me, and I examine the bird in the cage closely,
but as far as I can see, it is like any other green parrot in the
world, except that it strikes me as rather stupid.</p>

<p>It just sits there on the perch in the cage, rolling its eyes
this way and that and now and then going awk-awk-awk, as parrots
will do, in a low tone of voice, and of course, nobody can make
anything of these subdued remarks. Sometimes the parrot closes its
eyes and seems to be sleeping, but it is only playing possum, and
any time anybody gets close to the cage it opens its eyes, and
makes ready for another finger, and it is plain to be seen that
this is really a most sinister fowl.</p>

<p>"The poor thing is sleepy," Ambrose says. "I will now take it
home with me. I must never let it out of my sight or hearing," he
says, "as it may utter the name at any moment out of a clear sky,
and I must be present when this comes off."</p>

<p>"But you promised to take me to the Ossified Club," Miss Dawn
Astra says.</p>

<p>"Tut-tut," Ambrose says. "Tut-tut-tut," he says. "My goodness,
how can you think of frivolity when I have a big murder mystery to
solve? Besides, I cannot go to the Ossified Club unless I take the
parrot, and I am sure it will be greatly bored there. Come to think
of it," Ambrose says, "I will be greatly bored myself. You run
along home, and I will see you some other night."</p>

<p>Personally, I feel that Ambrose speaks rather crisply to Miss
Dawn Astra, and I can see that she is somewhat offended as she
departs, and I am by no means surprised the next day when Regret,
the horse player, tells me that he sees somebody that looks very
much like Miss Dawn Astra riding on the front seat of Julius
Smung's taxicab as the sun is coming up over Fiftieth Street.</p>

<p>Naturally, all the blatters make quite a fuss over the murder of
Grafton Wilton, because it is without doubt one of the best murders
for them that takes place in this town in a long time, what with
the animals in the apartment, and all this and that, and the police
are also somewhat excited about the matter until they discover
there is no clue, and as far as they can discover, no motive.</p>

<p>Then the police suggest that maybe Grafton Wilton cools himself
off somehow in a fit of despondency, although nobody can see how
such a thing is possible, and anyway, nobody will believe that a
character with an interest in twenty million is ever
despondent.</p>

<p>Well, the next night Ambrose Hammer has to go to a theatre to
see the opening of another new play, and nothing will do but he
must take the parrot in the cage to the theatre with him, and as
nobody is expecting a dramatic critic to bring a parrot with him to
an opening, Ambrose escapes notice going in.</p>

<p>It seems that it is such an opening as always draws the best
people, and furthermore it is a very serious play, and Ambrose sets
the cage with the parrot in it on the floor between his legs, and
everything is all right until the acting begins on the stage. Then
all of a sudden the parrot starts going awk-awk-awk in a very loud
tone of voice indeed, and flapping its wings and attracting general
attention to Ambrose Hammer.</p>

<p>Well, Ambrose tries to soothe the parrot by saying shush-shush
to it, but the parrot will not shush, and in fact, it keeps on
going awk-awk louder than ever, and presently there are slight
complaints from the people around Ambrose, and finally the leading
character in the play comes down off the stage and says he can see
that Ambrose is trying to give him the bird in a subtle manner, and
that he has a notion to punch Ambrose's nose for him.</p>

<p>The ushers request Ambrose to either check the parrot in the
cloakroom or leave the theatre, and Ambrose says he will leave.
Ambrose says he already sees enough of the play to convince him
that it is unworthy of his further attention, and he claims
afterwards that as he goes up the aisle with the birdcage in his
hand he is stopped by ten different theatre-goers, male and female,
who all whisper to him that they are sorry they do not bring
parrots.</p>

<p>This incident attracts some little attention, and it seems that
the editor of the blatter that Ambrose works for tells him that it
is undignified for a dramatic critic to go to the theatre with a
parrot, so Ambrose comes into Mindy's with the parrot again and
informs me that I must take charge of the parrot on nights when he
has to go to the theatre.</p>

<p>Ambrose says he will pay me well for this service, and as I am
always willing to pick up a few dibbs, I do not object, although
personally, I am by no means a parrot fan. Ambrose says I am to
keep a notebook, so I can jot down anything the parrot says when it
is with me, and when I ask Ambrose what it says to date, Ambrose
admits that so far it does not say a thing but awk.</p>

<p>"In fact," Ambrose says, "I am commencing to wonder if the cat
has got its tongue. It is the most noncommittal parrot I ever see
in all my life."</p>

<p>So now I am the custodian of the parrot the next night Ambrose
has to go to the theatre, and every time the parrot opens its trap,
I out with my notebook and jot down its remarks, but I only wind up
with four pages of awks, and when I suggest to Ambrose that maybe
the murderer's name is something that begins with <i>awk</i>, such
as 'Awkins, he claims that I am nothing but a fool.</p>

<p>I can see Ambrose is somewhat on edge to make a comment of this
nature, and I forgive him because I figure it may be because he is
not seeing as much of Miss Dawn Astra as formerly as it seems Miss
Dawn Astra will not go around with the parrot, and Ambrose will not
go around without it, so it is quite a situation.</p>

<p>I run into Miss Dawn Astra in the street a couple of times, and
she always asks me if the parrot says anything as yet, and when I
tell her nothing but awk, it seems to make her quite happy, so I
judge she figures that Ambrose is bound to get tired of listening
to nothing but awk and will return to her. I can see that Miss Dawn
Astra is looking thin and worried, and thinks I, love is too sacred
a proposition to let a parrot disturb it.</p>

<p>Well, the third night I am in charge of the parrot I leave it in
my room in the hotel where I reside in West Forty-ninth Street, as
I learn from Big Nig, the crap shooter, that a small game is in
progress in a garage in Fifty-fourth Street, and the parrot does
not act as if it is liable to say anything important in the next
hour. But when I return to the room after winning a sawbuck in two
passes in the game, I am horrified to find that the parrot is
absent.</p>

<p>The cage is still there, but the gate is open, and so is a
window in the room, and it is plain to be seen that the parrot
manages to unhook the fastening of the gate and make its escape,
and personally I will be very much pleased if I do not remember
about Ambrose Hammer and think how bad he will feel over losing the
parrot.</p>

<p>So I hasten at once to a little bird store over in Eighth
Avenue, where they have parrots by the peck, and I am fortunate to
find the proprietor just closing up for the night and willing to
sell me a green parrot for twelve dollars, which takes in the
tenner I win in the crap game and my night's salary from Ambrose
Hammer for looking after his parrot.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not see much difference between the parrot I
buy and the one that gets away, and the proprietor of the bird
store tells me that the new parrot is a pretty good talker when it
feels like it and that, to tell the truth, it generally feels like
it.</p>

<p>Well, I carry the new parrot back to my room in a little wooden
cage that the proprietor says goes with it and put it in the big
cage, and then I meet Ambrose Hammer at Mindy's restaurant and tell
him that the parrot says nothing at all worthy of note during the
evening.</p>

<p>I am afraid Ambrose may notice that this is not the same old
parrot, but he does not even glance at the bird, and I can see that
Ambrose is lost in thought, and there is no doubt but what he is
thinking of Miss Dawn Astra.</p>

<p>Up to this time the new parrot does not say as much as awk. It
is sitting in the little swing in the cage rocking back and forth,
and the chances are it is doing some thinking, too, because all of
a sudden it lets out a yell and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"Big heel! Big heel! Big heel!"</p>

<p>Well, at this, three characters at tables in different parts of
the room approach Ambrose and wish to know what he means by letting
his parrot insult them, and it takes Ambrose several minutes to
chill these beefs. In the meantime, he is trying to think which one
of Grafton Wilton's acquaintances the parrot may have reference to,
though he finally comes to the conclusion that there is no use
trying to single out anyone, as Grafton Wilton has a great many
acquaintances in his life.</p>

<p>But Ambrose is greatly pleased that the parrot at last displays
a disposition to talk, and he says it will not be long now before
the truth comes out, and that he is glad of it, because he wishes
to renew his companionship with Miss Dawn Astra. He no sooner says
this than the parrot lets go with a string of language that is by
no means pure, and causes Ambrose Hammer himself to blush.</p>

<p>From now on, Ambrose is around and about with the parrot every
night, and the parrot talks a blue streak at all times, though it
never mentions any names, except bad names. In fact, it mentions so
many bad names that the female characters who frequent the
restaurants and night clubs where Ambrose takes the parrot commence
complaining to the managements that they may as well stay home and
listen to their husbands.</p>

<p>Of course I never tell Ambrose that the parrot he is taking
around with him is not the parrot he thinks it is, because the way
I look at it, he is getting more out of my parrot than he does out
of the original, although I am willing to bet plenty that my parrot
does not solve any murder mysteries. But I never consider Ambrose's
theory sound from the beginning, anyway, and the chances are nobody
else does, either. In fact, many citizens are commencing to speak
of Ambrose Hammer as a cracky, and they do not like to see him come
around with his parrot.</p>

<p>Now one night when Ambrose is to go to a theatre to witness
another new play, and I am to have charge of the parrot for a
while, he takes me to dinner with him at the 9-9 Club, which is a
restaurant that is patronized by some of the highest-class parties,
male and female, in this town. As usual, Ambrose has the parrot
with him in its cage, and although it is plain to be seen that the
head waiter does not welcome the parrot, he does not care to offend
Ambrose, so he gives us a nice table against the wall, and as we
sit down, Ambrose seems to notice a strange-looking young Judy who
is at the next table all by herself.</p>

<p>She is all in black, and she has cold looking black hair slicked
down tight on her head and parted in the middle, and a cold eye,
and a cold-looking, dead-white face, and Ambrose seems to think he
knows her and half bows to her but she never gives him a blow.</p>

<p>So Ambrose puts the birdcage on the settee between him and the
cold-looking Judy and orders our dinner, and we sit there speaking
of this and that, but I observe that now and then Ambrose takes a
sneak-peek at her as if he is trying to remember who she is.</p>

<p>She pays no attention to him, whatever, and she does not pay any
attention to the parrot alongside her, either, although everybody
else in the 9-9 Club is looking our way, and, the chances are,
making remarks about the parrot.</p>

<p>Well, now what happens but the head waiter brings a messenger
boy over to our table, and this messenger boy has a note which is
addressed to Ambrose Hammer, and Ambrose opens this note and reads
it and then lets out a low moan and hands the note to me, and I
also read it, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Ambrose: When you receive this Julius and I will be on our
way to South America where we will be married and raise up a
family. Ambrose I love Julius and will never be happy with anybody
else. We are leaving so suddenly because we are afraid it may come
out about Julius calling on Mr. Grafton the night of the murder to
demand an apology from him for insulting me which I never tell you
about Ambrose because I do not wish you to know about me often
going to Mr. Grafton's place as you are funny that way.</p>

<p>They have a big fight, and Ambrose Julius is sorry he kills Mr.
Wilton but it is really an accident as Julius does not know his own
strength when he hits anybody.</p>

<p>Ambrose pardon me for taking your parrot but I tell Julius what
you say about the parrot speaking the name of the murderer some day
and it worries Julius. He says he hears parrots have long memories,
and he is afraid it may remember his name although Julius only
mentions it once when he is introducing himself to Mr. Wilton to
demand the apology.</p>

<p>I tell him he is thinking of elephants but he says it is best to
be on the safe side so I take the parrot out of the hotel and you
will find your parrot in the bottom of the East River Ambrose and
thanks for everything. DAWN.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Ambrose kindly do not tell it around about Julius
killing Mr. Wilton as we do not wish any publicity about
this.&mdash;D.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, Ambrose is sitting there as if he is practically stunned,
and shaking his head this way and that, and I am feeling very sorry
for him indeed, because I can understand what a shock it is to
anybody to lose somebody they dearly love without notice.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I can see that presently Ambrose will be seeking
explanations about the parrot matter, but for maybe five minutes
Ambrose does not say a word, and then he speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"What really hurts," Ambrose says, "is to see my theory go
wrong. Here I am going around thinking it is somebody in Grafton
Wilton's own circle that commits this crime, and the murderer turns
out to be nothing but a taxicab driver. Furthermore, I make a
laughing-stock of myself thinking a parrot will one day utter the
name of the murderer. By the way," Ambrose says, "what does this
note say about the parrot?"</p>

<p>Well, I can see that this is where it all comes out, but just as
I am about to hand him the note and start my own story, all of a
sudden the parrot in the cage begins speaking in a loud tone of
voice as follows:</p>

<p>"Hello, Polly," the parrot says. "Hello, Pretty Polly."</p>

<p>Now I often hear the parrot make these remarks and I pay no
attention to it, but Ambrose Hammer turns at once to the
cold-looking Judy at the table next to him and bows to her most
politely, and says to her like this:</p>

<p>"Of course," he says. "To be sure," he says. "Pretty Polly.
Pretty Polly Oligant," he says. "I am not certain at first, but now
I remember. Well, well, well," Ambrose says. "Two years in Auburn,
if I recall, for trying to put the shake on Grafton Wilton on a
phony breach-of-promise matter in 1932, when he is still under age.
Strange I forget it for a while," Ambrose says. "Strange I do not
connect you with this thing marked <i>P</i>, that I pick up in the
apartment the night of the murder. I think maybe I am protecting
some female character of good repute."</p>

<p>And with this, Ambrose pulls a small gold cigarette-case out of
his pocket that he never mentions to me before and shows it to
her.</p>

<p>"He ruins my life," the cold-looking Judy says. "The
breach-of-promise suit is on the level, no matter what the judge
says. How can you beat millions of dollars? There is no justice in
this world," she says.</p>

<p>Her voice is so low that no one around but Ambrose and me can
hear her, and her cold eyes have a very strange expression to be
sure as she says:</p>

<p>"I kill Grafton Wilton, all right," she says. "I am glad of it,
too. I am just getting ready to go to the police and give myself
up, anyway, so I may as well tell you. I am sick and tired of
living with this thing hanging over me."</p>

<p>"I never figure a Judy," Ambrose says. "I do not see how a
female can strike a blow hard enough to kill such a sturdy
character as Grafton Wilton."</p>

<p>"Oh, that," she says. "I do not strike him a blow. I get into
his apartment with a duplicate key that I have made from his lock,
and I find him lying on the floor half conscious. I revive him, and
he tells me a taxicab driver comes to his apartment and smashes him
between the eyes with his fist when he opens the door, and Grafton
claims he does not know why. Anyway," she says, "the blow does not
do anything more serious to him than skin his nose a little and
give him a couple of black eyes.</p>

<p>"Grafton is glad to see me," she says. "We sit around talking,
and eating and listening to the radio all evening. In fact," she
says, "we have such an enjoyable time that it is five hours later
before I have the heart and the opportunity to slip a little
cyanide in a glass of wine on him."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "the first thing we must do is to look up Miss
Dawn Astra's address and notify her that she is all wrong about
Julius doing the job. Maybe," I say, "she will feel so relieved
that she will return to you, Ambrose."</p>

<p>"No," Ambrose says, "I can see that Miss Dawn Astra is not the
one for me. If there is anything I cannot stand it is a female
character who does not state the truth at all times, and Miss Dawn
Astra utters a prevarication in this note when she says my parrot
is at the bottom of the East River, for here it is right here in
this cage, and a wonderful bird it is, to be sure. Let us all now
proceed to the police station, and I will then hasten to the office
and write my story of this transaction, and never mind about the
new play."</p>

<p>"Hello, Polly," the parrot says. "Pretty Polly."</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="DARK_DOLORES" id="DARK_DOLORES">11. DARK DOLORES</a>
</h2>

<p>WALDO WINCHESTER, the newspaper scribe, is saying to me the
other night up in the Hot Box that it is a very great shame that
there are no dolls around such as in the old days to make good
stories for the newspapers by knocking off guys right and left,
because it seems that newspaper scribes consider a doll knocking
off a guy very fine news indeed, especially if the doll or the guy
belongs to the best people.</p>

<p>Then Waldo Winchester tells me about a doll by the name of
Lorelei who hangs out in the Rhine River some time ago and stools
sailors up to the rocks to get them wrecked, which I consider a
dirty trick, although Waldo does not seem to make so much of it.
Furthermore, he speaks of another doll by the name of Circe, who is
quite a hand for luring guys to destruction, and by the time Waldo
gets to Circe he is crying because there are no more dolls like her
around to furnish news for the papers.</p>

<p>But of course the real reason Waldo is crying is not because he
is so sorry about Circe. It is because he is full of the liquor
they sell in the Hot Box, which is liquor that is apt to make
anybody bust out crying on a very short notice. In fact, they sell
the cryingest liquor in town up in the Hot Box.</p>

<p>Well, I get to mulling over these dolls Waldo Winchester speaks
of, and, thinks I, the chances are Dolores Dark connects up with
one of them away back yonder, and maybe with all of them for all I
know, Dolores Dark being the name of a doll I meet when I am in
Atlantic City with Dave the Dude the time of the big peace
conference.</p>

<p>Afterwards I hear she is called Dark Dolores in some spots on
account of her complexion but her name is really the other way
around. But first I will explain how it is I am in Atlantic City
with Dave the Dude the time of the big peace conference as
follows:</p>

<p>One afternoon I am walking along Broadway thinking of not much,
when I come on Dave the Dude just getting in a taxicab with a
suit-case in his duke, and the next thing I know Dave is jerking me
into the cab and telling the jockey to go to the Penn Station. This
is how I come to be in Atlantic City the time of the big peace
conference, although, of course, I have nothing to do with the
peace conference, and am only with Dave the Dude to keep him
company.</p>

<p>I am a guy who is never too busy to keep people company, and
Dave the Dude is a guy who just naturally loves company. In fact,
he hates to go anywhere, or be anywhere, by himself, and the reason
is because when he is by himself Dave the Dude has nobody to nod
him yes, and if there is one thing Dave is very, very fond of, it
is to have somebody to nod him yes. Why it is that Dave the Dude
does not have Big Nig with him I do not know, for Big Nig is Dave's
regular nod-guy.</p>

<p>But I am better than a raw hand myself at nodding. In fact, I am
probably as good a nod-guy as there is in this town, where there
must be three million nod-guys, and why not, because the way I look
at it, it is no bother whatever to nod a guy. In fact, it saves a
lot of conversation.</p>

<p>Anyway, there I am in Atlantic City the time of the big peace
conference, although I wish to say right now that if I know in
advance who is going to be at this peace conference, or that there
is going to be any peace conference, I will never be anywhere near
Atlantic City, because the parties mixed up in it are no kind of
associates for a nervous guy like me.</p>

<p>It seems this peace conference is between certain citizens of
St. Louis, such as Black Mike Marrio, Benny the Blond Jew, and
Scoodles Shea, who all have different mobs in St. Louis, and who
are all ripping and tearing each other for a couple of years over
such propositions as to who shall have what in the way of business
privileges of one kind and another, including alky, and liquor, and
gambling.</p>

<p>From what I hear there is plenty of shooting going on between
these mobs, and guys getting topped right and left. Also there is
much heaving of bombs, and all this and that, until finally the
only people making any dough in the town are the undertakers, and
it seems there is no chance of anybody cutting in on the
undertakers, though Scoodles Shea tries.</p>

<p>Well, Scoodles, who is a pretty smart guy, and who is once in
the war in France, finally remembers that when all the big nations
get Brooke, and sick and tired of fighting, they hold a peace
conference and straighten things out, so he sends word to Black
Mike and Benny the Blond Jew that maybe it will be a good idea if
they do the same thing, because half the guys are killed anyway,
and trade is strictly on the bum.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>It seems Black Mike and Benny think very well of this
proposition, and are willing to meet Scoodles in a peace
conference, but Scoodles, who is a very suspicious character, asks
where they will hold this conference. He says he does not wish to
hold any conference with Black Mike and Benny in St. Louis, except
maybe in his own cellar, because he does not know of any other
place in St. Louis where he will be safe from being guzzled by some
of Black Mike's or Benny's guys, and he says he does not suppose
Black Mike and Benny will care to go into his cellar with him. So
Scoodles Shea finally asks how about Atlantic City, and it seems
this is agreeable to Black Mike because he has a cousin in Atlantic
City by the name of Pisano that he does not see since they leave
the old country.</p>

<p>Benny the Blond Jew says any place is okay with him as long as
it is not in the State of Missouri, because he says, he does not
care to be seen anywhere in the State of Missouri with Black Mike
and Scoodles, as it will be a knock to his reputation.</p>

<p>This seems to sound somewhat insulting, and almost busts up the
peace conference before it starts, but finally Benny withdraws the
bad crack, and says he does not mean the State of Missouri, but
only St. Louis, so the negotiations proceed, and they settle on
Atlantic City as the spot.</p>

<p>Then Black Mike says some outside guy must sit in with them as a
sort of umpire, and help them iron out their arguments, and Benny
says he will take President Hoover, Colonel Lindbergh, or Chief
Justice Taft. Now of course this is great foolishness to think they
can get any one of these parties, because the chances are President
Hoover, Colonel Lindbergh and Chief Justice Taft are too busy with
other things to bother about ironing out a mob war in St.
Louis.</p>

<p>So finally Scoodles Shea suggests Dave the Dude. Both Black Mike
and Benny say Dave is okay, though Benny holds out for some time
for at least Chief Justice Taft. So Dave the Dude is asked to act
as umpire for the St. Louis guys, and he is glad to do same, for
Dave often steps into towns where guys are battling and straightens
them out, and sometimes they do not start battling again for
several weeks after he leaves town.</p>

<p>You see, Dave the Dude is friendly with everybody everywhere,
and is known to one and all as a right guy, and one who always
gives everybody a square rattle in propositions of this kind.
Furthermore, it is a pleasure for Dave to straighten guys out in
other towns, because the battling tangles up his own business
interests in spots such as St. Louis.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Now it seems that on their way to the station to catch a train
for Atlantic City, Scoodles Shea and Black Mike and Benny decide to
call on a young guy by the name of Frankie Farrone, who bobs up all
of a sudden in St. Louis with plenty of nerve, and who is causing
them no little bother one way and another.</p>

<p>In fact, it seems that this Frankie Farrone is as good a reason
as any other why Scoodles and Black Mike and Benny are willing to
hold a peace conference, because Frankie Farrone is nobody's friend
in particular and he is biting into all three wherever he can,
showing no respect whatever to old-established guys.</p>

<p>It looks as if Frankie Farrone will sooner of later take the
town away from them if they let him go far enough, and while each
one of the three tries at different times to make a connection with
him, it seems he is just naturally a lone wolf, and wishes no part
of any of them. In fact, somebody hears Frankie Farrone say he
expects to make Scoodles Shea and Black Mike and Benny jump out of
a window before he is through with them, but whether he means one
window or three different windows he does not say.</p>

<p>So there is really nothing to be done about Frankie Farrone but
to call on him, especially as the three are now together, because
the police pay no attention to his threats and make no move to
protect Scoodles and Black Mike and Benny, the law being very
careless in St. Louis at this time.</p>

<p>Of course, Frankie Farrone has no idea Scoodles and Black Mike
and Benny are friendly with each other, and he is probably very
much surprised when they drop in on him on their way to the
station. In fact, I hear there is a surprised look still on his
face when they pick him up later.</p>

<p>He is sitting in a speak-easy reading about the Cardinals losing
another game to the Giants when Scoodles Shea comes in the front
door, and Black Mike comes in the back door, and Benny the Blond
Jew slides in through a side entrance, it being claimed afterwards
that they know the owner of the joint and get him to fix it for
them so they will have no bother about dropping in on Frankie
Farrone sort of unexpected like.</p>

<p>Well, anyway the next thing Frankie Farrone knows he has four
slugs in him, one from Scoodles Shea, one from Benny, and two from
Black Mike, who seems to be more liberal than the others. The
chances are they will put more slugs in him, only they leave their
taxi a block away with the engine running and they know the St.
Louis taxi jockeys are terrible for jumping the meter on guys who
keep them waiting.</p>

<p>So they go on to catch their train, and they are all at the Ritz
Hotel in Atlantic City when Dave the Dude and I get there, and they
have a nice lay-out of rooms looking out over the ocean, for these
are high-class guys in every respect, and very good spenders.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>They are sitting around a table with their coats off playing
pinocle and drinking liquor when Dave and I show up, and right away
Black Mike says: "Hello, Dave! Where do we find the tomatoes?"</p>

<p>I can see at once that this Black Mike is a guy who has little
bringing up, or he will not speak of dolls as tomatoes, although,
of course, different guys have different names for dolls, such as
broads, and pancakes, and cookies, and tomatoes, which I claim are
not respectful.</p>

<p>This Black Mike is a Guinea, and not a bad-looking Guinea at
that, except for a big scar on one cheek.</p>

<p>Benny the Blond Jew is a tall, pale guy, with soft,
light-coloured hair and blue eyes, and if I do not happen to know
that he personally knocks off about nine guys I will consider him
as harmless a looking guy as I ever see. Scoodles Shea is a big,
red-headed muzzler with a lot of freckles and a big grin all over
his kisser.</p>

<p>They are all maybe thirty-odd, and wear coloured silk shirts
with soft collars fastened with gold pins, and Black Mike and
Scoodles Shea are wearing diamond rings and wrist-watches. Unless
you know who they are, you will never figure them to be gorills,
even from St. Louis, although at the same time the chances are you
will not figure them to be altar boys unless you are very
simpleminded.</p>

<p>They seem to be getting along first-rate together, which is not
surprising, because it will be considered very bad taste indeed for
guys such as these from one town to go into another town and start
up any heat. It will be regarded as showing no respect whatever for
the local citizens.</p>

<p>Anyway, Atlantic City is never considered a spot for anything
but pleasure, and even guys from Philly who may be mad at each
other, and who meet up in Atlantic City, generally wait until they
get outside the city limits before taking up any arguments.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, it seems that not only Black Mike wishes to meet up with
some dolls, but Scoodles Shea and Benny are also thinking of such,
because the first two things guys away from home think of are
liquor and dolls, although personally I never give these matters
much of a tumble.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I can see that Dave the Dude is not so anxious
about them as you will expect, because Dave is now married to Miss
Billy Perry, and if Miss Billy Perry hears that Dave is having any
truck with liquor and dolls, especially dolls, it is apt to cause
gossip around his house.</p>

<p>But Dave figures he is a sort of host in this territory, because
the others are strangers to Atlantic City, and important people
where they come from, so we go down to Joe Goss's joint, which is a
big cabaret just off the Boardwalk, and in no time there are half a
dozen dolls of different shapes and sizes from Joe Goss's chorus,
and also several of Joe Goss's hostesses, for Joe Goss gets many
tired business men from New York among his customers, and there is
nothing a tired business man from New York appreciates more than a
lively hostess. Furthermore, Joe Goss himself is sitting with us as
a mark of respect to Dave the Dude.</p>

<p>Black Mike and Scoodles and Benny are talking with the dolls and
dancing with them now and then, and a good time is being had by one
and all, as far as I can see, including Dave the Dude after he gets
a couple of slams of Joe Goss's liquor in him and commences to
forget about Miss Billy Perry. In fact, Dave so far forgets about
Miss Billy Perry that he gets out on the floor with one of the
dolls, and dances some, which shows you what a couple of slams of
Joe Goss's liquor will do to a guy.</p>

<p>Most of the dolls are just such dolls as you will find in a
cabaret, but there is one among them who seems to be a hostess, and
whose name seems to be Dolores, and who is a lily for looks. It is
afterwards that I find out her other name is Dark, and it is Dave
the Dude who afterwards finds out that she is called Dark Dolores
in spots.</p>

<p>She is about as good a looker as a guy will wish to clap an eye
on. She's tall and limber, like a buggy whip, and she has hair as
black as the ace of spades, and maybe blacker, and all smooth and
shiny. Her eyes are black and as big as doughnuts, and she has a
look in them that somehow makes me think she may know more than she
lets on, which I afterwards find out is very true indeed.</p>

<p>She does not have much to say, and I notice she does not drink,
and does not seem to be so friendly with the other dolls, so I
figure her a fresh-laid one around there, especially as Joe Goss
himself does not act as familiar towards her as he does towards
most of his dolls, although I can see him give her many a nasty
look on account of her passing up drinks.</p>

<p>In fact, nobody gives her much of a tumble at all at first,
because guys generally like gabby dolls in situations such as this.
But finally I notice that Benny the Blond Jew is taking his peeks
at her, and I figure it is because he has better judgment than the
others, although I do not understand how Dave the Dude can overlook
such a bet, because no better judge of dolls ever lives than Dave
the Dude.</p>

<p>But even Benny does not talk to Dolores or offer to dance with
her, and at one time when Joe Goss is in another part of the joint
chilling a beef from some customer about a check, or maybe about
the liquor, which calls for at least a mild beef, and the others
are out on the floor dancing. Dolores and I are left alone at the
table.</p>

<p>We sit there quite a spell with plenty of silence between us,
because I am never much of a hand to chew the fat with dolls, but
finally, not because I wish to know or care a whoop, but just to
make small talk, I ask her how long she is in Atlantic City.</p>

<p>"I get here this afternoon, and go to work for Mr. Goss just
this very night," she says. "I am from Detroit."</p>

<p>Now I do not ask her where she is from, and her sticking in this
information makes me commence to think that maybe she is a gabby
doll after all, but she dries up and does not say anything else
until the others come back to the table.</p>

<p>Now Benny the Blond Jew moves into a chair alongside Dolores,
and I hear him say:</p>

<p>"Are you ever in St. Louis? Your face is very familiar to me."
"No," she says. "I am from Cleveland. I am never in St. Louis in my
life."</p>

<p>"Well," Benny says, "you look like somebody I see before in St.
Louis. It is very strange, because I cannot believe it possible for
there to be more than one wonderful beautiful doll like you."</p>

<p>I can see Benny is there with the old stuff when it comes to
carrying on a social conversation, but I am wondering how it comes
this Dolores is from Detroit with me and from Cleveland with him.
Still, I know a thousand dolls who cannot remember off-hand where
they are from if you ask them quick.</p>

<p>By and by Scoodles Shea and Black Mike notice Benny is all
tangled in conversation with Dolores, which makes them take a
second peek at her, and by this time they are peeking through
plenty of Joe Goss's liquor, which probably makes her look ten
times more beautiful than she really is. And I wish to say that any
doll ten times more beautiful than Dolores is nothing but a
dream.</p>

<p>Anyway, before long Dolores is getting much attention from Black
Mike and Scoodles, as well as Benny, and the rest of the dolls
finally take the wind, because nobody is giving them a tumble any
more. And even Dave the Dude begins taking dead aim at Dolores
until I remind him that he must call up Miss Billy Perry, so he
spends the next half-hour in a phone booth explaining to Miss Billy
Perry that he is in his hotel in the hay, and that he loves her
very dearly.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, we are in Joe Goss's joint until five o'clock a.m., with
Black Mike and Scoodles and Benny talking to Dolores and taking
turns dancing with her, and Dave the Dude is plumb wore out,
especially as Miss Billy Perry tells him she knows he is a liar and
a bum, as she can hear an orchestra playing "I Get So Blue When It
Rains," and for him to just wait until she sees him. Then we take
Dolores and go to Childs's restaurant on the Boardwalk and have
some coffee, and finally all hands escort her to a little flea-bag
in North Caroline Avenue where she says she is stopping.</p>

<p>"What are you doing this afternoon, beautiful one?" asks Benny
the Blond Jew as we are telling her good night, even though it is
morning, and at this crack Black Mike and Scoodles Shea look at
Benny, very, very cross.</p>

<p>"I am going bathing in front of the Ritz," she says. "Do some of
you boys wish to come along with me?"</p>

<p>Well, it seems that Black Mike and Scoodles and Benny all think
this is a wonderful idea, but it does not go so big with Dave the
Dude or me. In fact, by this time, Dave the Dude and me are pretty
sick of Dolores.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Dave says, "we must start our conference this
afternoon and get through with it, because my ever-loving doll is
already steaming, and I have plenty of business to look after in
New York."</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>But the conference does not start this afternoon, or the next
night, or the next day, or the next day following, because in the
afternoons Black Mike and Scoodles and Benny are in the ocean with
Dolores and at night they are in Joe Goss's joint, and in between
they are taking her riding in rolling chairs on the Boardwalk, or
feeding her around the different hotels.</p>

<p>No one guy is ever alone with her as far as I can see, except
when she is dancing with one in Joe Goss's joint, and about the
third night they are so jealous of each other they all try to dance
with her at once.</p>

<p>Well, naturally even Joe Goss complains about this because it
makes confusion on his dance floor, and looks unusual. So Dolores
settles the proposition, by not dancing with anybody, and I figure
this is a good break for her, as no doll's dogs can stand all the
dancing Black Mike and Scoodles and Benny wish to do.</p>

<p>The biggest rolling chair on the Boardwalk only takes in three
guys or two guys and one doll, or, what is much better, one guy and
two dolls, so when Dolores is in a rolling chair with a guy sitting
on each side of her the other walks alongside the chair, which is a
peculiar sight, indeed.</p>

<p>How they decide the guy who walks I never know, but I suppose
Dolores fixes it. When she is in bathing in the ocean Black Mike
and Scoodles and Benny all stick so close to her that she is really
quite crowded at times.</p>

<p>I doubt if even Waldo Winchester, the scribe, who hears of a lot
of things, ever hears of such a situation as this with three guys
all daffy over the same doll, and guys who do not think any too
well of each other to begin with. I can see they are getting more
and more hostile towards each other over her, but when they are not
with Dolores they stick close to each other for fear one will cop a
sneak, and get her to himself.</p>

<p>I am very puzzled, because Black Mike and Scoodles and Benny do
not get their rods out and start a shooting match among themselves
over her, but I find that Dave the Dude makes them turn in their
rods to him the second day because he does not care to have them
doing any target practice around Atlantic City.</p>

<p>So they cannot start a shooting match among themselves if they
wish, and the reason they do not put the slug on each other is
because Dolores tells them she hates tough guys who go around
putting the slug on people. So they are gentlemen, bar a few bad
cracks passing among them now and then.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, it comes on a Friday, and there we are in Atlantic City
since a Monday and nothing stirring on the peace conference as yet,
and Dave the Dude is very much disgusted indeed.</p>

<p>All night Friday and into Saturday morning we are in Joe Goss's,
and personally I can think of many other places I will rather be.
To begin with, I never care to be around gorills when they are
drinking, and when you take gorills who are drinking and get them
all crazy about the same doll, they are apt to turn out to be no
gentlemen any minute.</p>

<p>I do not know who it is who suggests a daybreak swimming party,
because I am half asleep, and so is Dave the Dude, but I hear
afterwards it is Dolores. Anyway, the next thing anybody knows we
are out on the beach, and Dolores and Black Mike and Scoodles Shea
and Benny the Blond Jew are in their bathing suits and the dawn is
touching up the old ocean very beautiful.</p>

<p>Of course, Dave the Dude and me are not in bathing suits,
because in the first place neither of us is any hand for going in
bathing, and in the second place, if we are going in bathing, we
will not go in bathing at such an hour. Furthermore, as far as I am
personally concerned, I hope I am never in a bathing suit if I will
look no better in it than Black Mike, while Scoodles Shea is no
Gene Tunney in regards to shape. Benny the Blond Jew is the only
one who looks human, and I do not give him more than sixty-five
points.</p>

<p>Dave the Dude and me stand around watching them, and mostly we
are watching Dolores. She is in a red bathing suit with a red
rubber cap over her black hair, and while most dolls in bathing
suits hurt my eyes, she is still beautiful. I will always claim she
is the most beautiful thing I ever see, bar Blue Larkspur, and of
course Blue Larkspur is a racehorse and not a doll. I am very glad
that Miss Billy Perry is not present to see the look in Dave the
Dude's eyes as he watches Dolores in her bathing suit, for Miss
Billy Perry is quick to take offence.</p>

<p>When she is in the water Dolores slides around like a big
beautiful red fish. You can see she loves it. The chances are I can
swim better on my back than Black Mike or Scoodles Shea can on
their stomachs, and Benny the Blond Jew is no Gertrude Ederle, but
of course, I am allowing for them being well loaded with Joe Goss's
liquor, and a load of Joe Goss's liquor is not apt to float well
anywhere.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, after they paddle around in the ocean a while, Dolores and
her three Romeos lap out on the sand, and Dave the Dude and me are
just figuring on going to bed, when all of a sudden we see Dolores
jump up and start running for the ocean with Black Mike and Benny
head-and-head just behind her, and Scoodles Shea half a length
back.</p>

<p>She tears into the water, kicking it every which way until she
gets to where it is deep, when she starts to swim, heading for the
open sea. Black Mike and Scoodles Shea and Benny the Blond Jew are
paddling after her like blazes. We can see it is some kind of a
chase, and we stand watching it. We can see Dolores's little red
cap bouncing along over the water like a rubber ball on a sidewalk,
with Black Mike and Scoodles and Benny staggering along behind her,
for Joe Goss's liquor will make a guy stagger on land or sea.</p>

<p>She is away ahead of them at first, but then she seems to pull
up and let them get closer to her. When Black Mike, who is leading
the other two, gets within maybe fifty yards of her, the red cap
bounces away again, always going farther out. It strikes me that
Dolores is sort of swimming in wide circles, now half turning as if
coming back to the beach, and then taking a swing that carries her
seaward again.</p>

<p>When I come to think it over afterwards, I can see that when you
are watching her it does not look as if she is swimming away from
the beach, and yet all the time she is getting away from it.</p>

<p>One of her circles takes her almost back to Benny, who is a bad
last to Black Mike and Scoodles Shea, and in fact she gets so close
to Benny that he is lunging for her, when she slides away again,
and is off faster than any fish I ever see afloat. Then she does
the same to Black Mike and Scoodles. I figure they are playing tag
in the water, or some such, and while this may be all right for
guys who are full of liquor, and a light-headed doll, I do not
consider it a proper amusement at such an hour for guys in their
right senses, like Dave the Dude and me.</p>

<p>So I am pleased when he says we better go to bed because by this
time Dolores and Black Mike and Scoodles Shea and Benny seem to be
very far out in the water indeed. As we are strolling along the
Boardwalk, I look back again and there they are, no bigger than pin
points on the water, and it seems to me that I can see only three
pin points, at that, but I figure Dolores is so far out I cannot
see her through the haze.</p>

<p>"They will be good and tuckered out by the time they get back,"
I say to Dave the Dude.</p>

<p>"I hope they drown," Dave says, but a few days later he
apologizes for his crack and explains he makes it only because he
is tired and disgusted.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, I often think now that it is strange neither Dave the Dude
or me see anything unnatural in the whole play, but we do not even
mention Dolores or Black Mike or Scoodles Shea or Benny the Blond
Jew until late in the afternoon when we are putting on the old
grapefruit and ham and eggs in Dave's room and Dave is looking out
over the ocean.</p>

<p>"Say," he says, as if he just happens to remember it, "do you
know those guys are away out yonder the last we see of them? I
wonder if they get back okay?"</p>

<p>And as if answering his question there is a knock on the door,
and who walks in but Dolores. She looks all fagged out, but she is
so beautiful I will say she seems to light up the room, only I do
not wish anybody to think I am getting romantic. Anyway, she is
beautiful, but her voice is very tired as she says to Dave the
Dude:</p>

<p>"Your friends from St. Louis will not return, Mister Dave the
Dude. They do not swim so well, but better than I thought. The one
that is called Black Mike and Scoodles Shea turn back when we are
about three miles out, but they never reach the shore. I see them
both go down for the last time. I make sure of this, Mister Dave
the Dude. The pale one, Benny, lasts a little farther, although he
is the worst swimmer of them all, and he never turns back. He is
still trying to follow me when a cramp gets him and he sinks. I
guess he loves me the most at that as he always claims."</p>

<p>Well, naturally, I am greatly horrified by this news, especially
as she tells it without batting one of her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell us you let these poor guys drown out there
in all this salt water?" I say, very indignant. "Why, you are
nothing but a cad."</p>

<p>But Dave the Dude makes a sign for me to shut up, and Dolores
says:</p>

<p>"I come within a quarter of a mile of swimming the English
Channel in 1927, as you will see by looking up the records," she
says, "and I can swim the Mississippi one handed, but I cannot pack
three big guys such as these on my back. Even," she says, "if I
care to, which I do not. Benny is the only one who speaks to me
before he goes. The last time I circle back to him he waves his
hand and says, 'I know all along I see you somewhere before. I
remember now. You are Frankie Farrone's doll.'"</p>

<p>"And you are?" asks Dave the Dude.</p>

<p>"His widow," says Dolores, "I promise him as he lays in his
coffin that these men will die, and they are dead. I spent my last
dollar getting to this town by aeroplane, but I get there, and I
get them. Only it is more the hand of Providence," she says. "Now I
will not need this."</p>

<p>And she tosses out on the table among our breakfast dishes a
little bottle that we find out afterwards is full of enough cyanide
to kill forty mules, which always makes me think that this Dolores
is a doll who means business.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing I wish to know," Dave the Dude says.
"Only one thing. How do you coax these fatheads to follow you out
into the water?"</p>

<p>"This is the easiest thing of all," Dolores says. "It is an
inspiration to me as we lay out on the beach. I tell them I will
marry the first one who reaches me in the water. I do not wish to
seem hard-hearted, but it is a relief to me when I see Black Mike
sink. Can you imagine being married to such a bum?"</p>

<p>It is not until we are going home that Dave the Dude has
anything to say about the proposition, and then he speaks to me as
follows:</p>

<p>"You know," Dave says, "I will always consider I get a very
lucky break that Dolores does not include me in her offer, or the
chances are I will be swimming yet."</p>

DELEGATES AT LARGE</a>
</h2>

<p>WHEN it comes on summer, and the nights get nice and warm, I
love to sit on the steps in front of the bank at Forty-eighth
Street and Seventh Avenue, where a guy can keep himself cool. Many
other citizens are fond of sitting on the bank steps with me, and
usually we sit with our coats on, speaking of this and that.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can see very prominent citizens sitting with me on
the bank steps, including such as Regret, the horse player, and old
Sorrowful, the bookie, and Doc Daro and Professor D. and Johnny
Oakley and The Greek, and often strangers in the city, seeing us
sitting there and looking so cool, stop and take off their coats
and sit down with us, although personally if I am a stranger in the
city I will be a little careful who I sit down with no matter how
hot I am.</p>

<p>Well, one night I am sitting on the bank steps with Big Nig, the
crap shooter, and a guy by the name of Skyrocket, who is nobody
much, when all of a sudden I notice three guys standing on the
sidewalk taking a very good long gander at me, and who are these
guys but certain characters from Brooklyn by the name of Harry the
Horse, and Spanish John and Little Isadore, and they are very hard
characters indeed.</p>

<p>In fact, these characters are so hard that I am glad that none
of the depositors of the bank can see them standing there, as such
a scene is just naturally bound to make any depositor nervous. In
fact, it makes me more nervous than somewhat, and I am by no means
a depositor. But of course I do not let on to Harry the Horse and
Spanish John and Little Isadore that I am nervous, because they may
get the idea that I am nervous about them and take offence.</p>

<p>Well finally I say hello to them, and they all say hello right
back, and I can see that they are not inclined to take offence at
me, but then they start looking at Big Nig and Skyrocket in such a
way that I can see they are taking offence at Big Nig's face and at
Skyrocket's too, and personally I do not blame them, at that, as
these are faces such as may give offence to anybody.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Big Nig and Skyrocket can see that these Brooklyn
characters are taking offence at their faces and in practically no
time Big Nig and Skyrocket are walking briskly up Forty-eighth
Street.</p>

<p>Then Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore take
off their coats and sit there with me quite a while, with nobody
saying much of anything, and I am wondering what these characters
are doing in this neighbourhood, because they know they are by no
means welcome along Broadway or anywhere else in town for that
matter, when finally Harry the Horse speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"Well," Harry says, "we are going out West to-morrow. Yes," he
says, "we are going away out to Chicago, but," he says, "do not ask
us to call on anybody in Chicago for you, as we will be very busy
while we are there."</p>

<p>Now it happens I do not know anybody in Chicago for them to call
on, and if I do know anybody there I will just as soon think of
sending them a bottle of prussic acid as to ask Harry the Horse and
Spanish John and Little Isadore to call on them, but naturally I do
not mention such an idea out loud. And although I am dying to know
why they are going to Chicago, of course I do not ask them, as such
a question is bound to be regarded as inquisitive by these
characters.</p>

<p>So I only say I hope and trust that they will have a very
pleasant journey to Chicago and that they will return safe and
sound, although I am secretly hoping they never return at all,
because if there are any citizens this town can spare it is Harry
the Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore, and especially Harry
the Horse.</p>

<p>In fact, the chances are that Brooklyn, where Harry resides,
will be glad to pay him a bonus to move away from there, because he
is always carrying on in such a way as to give Brooklyn a bad name,
while Spanish John and Little Isadore are no boost to the borough,
either. But Spanish John and Little Isadore only do what Harry
tells them, and what Harry tells me is generally something that
causes somebody plenty of bother.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Harry the Horse has a wild streak in him
and he is very mischievous, and is always putting Spanish John and
Little Isadore up to such tricks as robbing their fellow citizens
of Brooklyn and maybe taking shots at them, and sometimes Harry the
Horse personally takes a shot or two himself. Naturally, this
practice is most distasteful to the citizens of Brooklyn, who are
very fond of peace and quiet.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little
Isadore sit on the bank steps with me quite a while. Finally
however, they get up and put on their coats and shake hands with me
and say they hope to see me when they get back from Chicago, and
then they go away, and I do not hear of them again for several
weeks.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Now one hot night I am again sitting on the steps with a number
of prominent citizens, when who comes along but Little Isadore, and
he motions me to follow him up the street. It is the first time I
ever see Little Isadore without either Harry the Horse or Spanish
John and when I join him, naturally I ask him about the others, and
Little Isadore speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>"Harry is in a hospital in Chicago," Little Isadore says.
"Spanish John is out there waiting for him to get well. I come back
home," Little Isadore says, "to raise some scratch to pay Harry's
hospital fees.</p>

<p>"He is all bunged up. It comes of mixing in politics with a
doll," he says. "Maybe you will like to hear the story."</p>

<p>Naturally I say I will be greatly pleased to hear it, so we walk
around to Mindy's restaurant, and Little Isadore orders up a
sirloin steak smothered in onions, and while he is eating this
steak he begins to talk.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well (Little Isadore says), we go to Chicago all right the day
after we last see you, and we go to Chicago by special invitation
of some very prominent parties out there. I will mention no names,
but these parties are very prominent indeed, especially in beer,
and they invite us out there to take care of a guy by the name of
Donkey O'Neill, as it seems this Donkey O'Neill is also in beer in
opposition to the prominent parties I speak of.</p>

<p>Naturally, these parties will not tolerate opposition, and there
is nothing for them to do but to see that Donkey O'Neill is taken
care of. But of course they do not wish him to be taken care of by
local talent, as this is a very old-fashioned way of transacting
such matters, and nowadays when anybody is to be taken care of in
any town it is customary to invite outsiders in, as they are not
apt to leave any familiar traces such as local talent is bound to
do.</p>

<p>So the prominent parties in Chicago get in touch with Angie the
Ox, in Brooklyn, and Angie speaks so highly of Harry the Horse and
Spanish John and me that we get the invitation, which anybody will
tell you is a great honour.</p>

<p>Furthermore, six G's and all expenses go with the invitation,
and this is by no means alfalfa.</p>

<p>We go to Chicago by the Twentieth Century train, and it is a
nice trip generally, except that while we are in the club car
playing pinocle Harry the Horse gets to looking at a doll with more
interest than somewhat. Now, it is by no means like Harry the Horse
to look at a doll. In fact, in all the years I am associated with
Harry the Horse, socially and in business, he never before looks at
a doll more than once, or maybe twice, because he claims that all
dolls are more or less daffy.</p>

<p>But I will say that the doll in the club car is worth looking
at, and anybody can see that she has plenty of class, although
personally I like them with legs that are not quite so spindly. She
is by no means a real young doll, being maybe twenty-five or
twenty-six, and anybody can see that she knows what time it is.</p>

<p>Furthermore, she is very stylish, and even if Harry the Horse is
a guy who gives dolls a tumble this is about the last doll you will
figure him to tumble, because she looks as if she may be such a
doll as will holler for the gendarmes if anybody as much as says
boo to her.</p>

<p>But Harry the Horse does not seem to be able to keep his eyes
off her, and by and by he quits our pinocle game and takes a chair
next to her and lets on he is reading a magazine. The next thing
anybody knows, Harry is talking to the doll very friendly, which is
a most astonishing sight to Spanish John and me, although Harry can
talk first rate when he feels like it, and furthermore he is by no
means as bad looking as the photos of him the cops send around make
him out.</p>

<p>Well, the conversation between Harry the Horse and the doll is
also most astonishing to Spanish John and me, because we hear her
say to him like this:</p>

<p>"Yes," she says, "I am going to Chicago. I am going to attend
the convention," she says. "I am a member of the New York
Delegation. Some great questions are to be decided in Chicago," she
says, "I love politics, and I think it will be a good thing if all
women take an interest in politics. Do you not think so?"</p>

<p>Well, Harry the Horse may not be the smartest guy in the
country, but he is smart enough to say yes every now and then to
the doll, because if a guy keeps yessing a doll long enough, she is
bound to figure him a bright guy, and worth looking into.</p>

<p>By and by the doll mentions that her name is Miss Maribel Marlo
and that she lives on Park Avenue in the winter and at Southampton
in the summer, so it does not take a mind-reader to figure that she
must have plenty of potatoes.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Finally she takes to asking Harry the Horse questions, and as
Harry is about as good an off-hand liar as there is in the United
States, his answers are very satisfactory indeed, although
personally I figure he is stretching it a little bit when he tells
her that we are also going to the convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Maribel Marlo seems pleased to learn this news from
Harry the Horse, and she says to him as follows: "Of course you are
delegates?" she says.</p>

<p>"Yes," Harry says, "such is indeed the case."</p>

<p>"Why," Miss Maribel Marlo says, "we will all be in the
convention together. How nice!" she says. "What district are you
from?"</p>

<p>Well, naturally Harry does not wish to speak of Brooklyn,
because it is never a good policy for a guy to mention his address
when he is away from home, so he says we are from no district in
particular, which does not sound to me like the right answer, but
it seems to suit Miss Maribel Marlo.</p>

<p>"Oh," she says, "I understand. You are delegates at large."</p>

<p>Well, I am glad Harry the Horse lets it go at this and turns the
conversation back to Miss Maribel Marlo, and anybody can see that
Miss Maribel Marlo is such a doll as does not mind having the
conversation about herself, although it makes me very nervous when
I hear Harry the Horse speak to her as follows: "Lady," Harry says,
"does anybody tell you how beautiful you are?"</p>

<p>Naturally, I expect to see Harry the Horse given plenty of wind
at once for this crack, but it seems it proves interesting to Miss
Maribel Marlo, and she is still listening to Harry when Spanish
John and me go to bed.</p>

<p>Afterwards I learn Miss Maribel Marlo listens to Harry the Horse
until midnight, which is most surprising because Harry is a guy
whose grammar is by no means perfect, but it seems that no doll
minds a guy's grammar as long as he is speaking well of her. And
Harry the Horse tells me that he does not fail to give Miss Maribel
Marlo plenty the best of it in all his remarks. Furthermore, Harry
says, she is deserving of everything he says, which shows that
Harry is impressed by Miss Maribel Marlo more than somewhat.</p>

<p>The next morning when our train pulls into Chicago we see her on
the platform, but she is so surrounded by other dolls, and also by
several guys who wear swell clothes and little moustaches, that she
does not see us, and Harry the Horse is very thoughtful all the
rest of the day.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, Chicago is a very large and busy city, with many citizens
walking around and about, and among these citizens are many parties
wearing large badges, and it seems that these parties are from
different parts of the country and are delegates to the national
convention that is going on in Chicago at this time.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it seems that this convention is a political
proposition, and the idea is to nominate a candidate for President,
and also a candidate for Vice-President, if they can get anybody to
take it. It is this convention that Miss Maribel Marlo is talking
about on the train.</p>

<p>But of course Harry the Horse and Spanish John and me have no
interest in a matter of this kind, because our business is to look
up these prominent parties who invite us to Chicago, and find out
just what is what. But Harry the Horse does not seem anxious to get
down to business at once, and is wandering around looking as if he
is slug-nutty, and I hear he goes over to the Blackstone on
Michigan Boulevard where Miss Maribel Marlo is stopping, to see if
he can get a peek at her.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am somewhat disgusted with Harry the Horse, and so
is Spanish John to think that he becomes interested in a doll when
we have important business to attend to, so I am very glad when a
representative of the prominent parties who invite us to Chicago
calls on us at our hotel to explain just what our hosts expect of
us. This representative is a guy by the name of Snooksy, and he is
very apologetic because he says it looks as if we may be delayed in
town a few days.</p>

<p>"This Donkey O'Neill has plenty of political strength," Snooksy
says. "In fact," he says, "he is a delegate to the big convention,
and," he says, "we figure it may not be a good idea to take care of
him when he is in such a prominent spot. It may cause gossip,"
Snooksy says. "The idea is to wait until after the convention, and
in the meantime I will entertain you gentlemen the best I know
how."</p>

<p>Well, this seems fair enough, and the news cheers up Harry the
Horse, as he figures the delay will give him more chance to see
Miss Maribel Marlo, although he admits to me that he cannot get
near her at the Blackstone, what with her having so many friends
around.</p>

<p>I ask Harry the Horse why he does not walk right in and send his
name up to her, but it seems he cannot remember the name he gives
her on the train, and anyway, he does not wish her to find out that
it is all the phonus bolonus about us being delegates to the
convention.</p>

<p>Harry says there is no doubt in his mind that he must be in love
with Miss Maribel Marlo, and he will not listen to my idea that
maybe it is the change in climate that does not agree with him.</p>

<p>Well, I wish to say that this Snooksy is a splendid entertainer
in every respect, and he takes us around and about the city of
Chicago, and wherever we go he introduces us to many prominent
chafacters, although I notice that Snooks never introduces us by
the same names twice, and before the evening is over I am from four
different cities, including San Francisco, Dallas, Texas,
Shreveport, Louisiana, and Oskaloosa, Iowa.</p>

<p>But nobody ever asks any questions, as it seems the citizens of
Chicago are very polite in this respect, so we all enjoy ourselves
thoroughly, especially Spanish John, who claims the beer in Chicago
is almost as good as the kind Angie the Ox sells in Brooklyn.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, for a couple of days and nights we are entertained by
Snooksy, and even Harry the Horse cheers up, and I commence to
think he forgets Miss Maribel Marlo, until early one a.m. we are in
a joint where there is plenty of beer and other entertainment,
including blondes, when a bunch of guys wearing badges happen
in.</p>

<p>Anybody can see from the badges that these guys are delegates
such as are walking around and about all over town, and,
furthermore, that some of them are delegates from New Jersey, which
is a spot well known to Harry the Horse and Spanish John and me,
although one guy seems to be from Massachusetts and another from
Texas. But they are all full of fun and beer, and one thing and
another, and they take a table next to us, and the first thing
anybody knows we are very neighbourly together.</p>

<p>Well, by and by I notice Harry the Horse examining the badge one
of the New Jersey guys is wearing, and I also hear Harry asking
questions about it, and it seems from what the guy says that
anybody wearing such a badge and carrying a certain card can walk
in and out of the convention, and no questions asked. Then I hear
Harry the Horse speak to the guy as follows:</p>

<p>"Well," Harry says, "I am never in a convention in my life. I
only wish I have such a badge," he says, "so I can see how a
convention works."</p>

<p>"Why," the guy says, speaking out loud so the others hear him,
"this is a terrible state of affairs. Here is a guy who is never in
a convention," he says. "Why," he says, "you will have my seat at
the morning session while I will be catching up on some sleep,
although," the guy says, "the chances are you will find it all very
tiresome."</p>

<p>With this the guy unpins the badge on his chest and pins it on
Harry the Horse, and furthermore he takes a card out of his pocket
and gives it to Harry, and then he calls for more beer, while the
other boys commence asking Snooksy and Spanish John and me if we
will care to see the convention, too.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not care a whoop about seeing any convention,
but the guys are so cordial about the matter that I do not have the
heart to say no, so pretty soon there I am wearing a New Jersey
badge, while Spanish John has a Massachusetts badge and Snooksy the
badge belonging to the guy from Texas.</p>

<p>Also, we have cards saying we are delegates, and are full of
instructions how to act and what to answer in case anybody starts
asking questions. And now you know how it comes that Snooksy and
Harry the Horse and Spanish John and me are sitting in the
convention next day, although Spanish John and Snooksy are not
doing much sitting, but are wandering around, and afterwards I hear
there is some complaint from delegates about losing their leathers
containing their return tickets and funds.</p>

<p>Now of course I never have any idea of going to the convention
when the guys pin the badges on us, and I have no idea Harry the
Horse will even think of such a thing, but nothing will do him but
we must go, and he will not listen to my argument that the other
delegates from New Jersey will see that we are strictly
counterfeit. So there we are, and as it turns out there is great
confusion in the convention when we get in, and nobody pays any
attention to anybody else, which is a break for us.</p>

<p>In fact, Harry the Horse and me become quite pally with some of
the guys around us, especially as Harry remembers before we start
for the convention about a case of good beer that Snooksy sends us,
and figuring we may need a refreshing dram while sitting in the
convention, he slips several of these bottles into his pockets and
wraps up several more, and this beer goes very nice indeed when
Harry starts passing it about.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Personally I am greatly disappointed in the convention, because
it is nothing but a lot of guys and dolls in a large hall, with
signs stuck up here and there on sticks, with the names of
different states on the signs. A guy up on a big platform is
hammering on a table and yelling very loud, and everybody else
seems to be yelling, and it strikes me as most undignified,
especially as some of the guys start marching up and down the
aisles carrying on quite some.</p>

<p>Several of the signs with the names of states on them are being
lugged up and down the aisles, and every now and then a new sign
bobs up in the procession, and then the racket gets worse than
ever. I am about to mention to Harry the Horse that we will be
better off in some more quiet spot when I notice him looking
towards a sign that says New York on it, and who is sitting in a
chair alongside this sign but Miss Maribel Marlo, looking very
beautiful indeed.</p>

<p>Well, I know enough to know that this sign means that the New
York delegates are somewhere around close, and I am wondering if
any of my friends from my old home town are present among them,
because by this time I am getting more homesick than somewhat.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden some of the New York bunch joins the
marchers, and a tall, skinny guy reaches for the New York sign with
the idea of carrying it on the march.</p>

<p>At this, Miss Maribel Marlo stands up on her chair and grabs
hold of the sign, and the skinny guy starts to pull and haul with
her, trying to get the sign away from her. Personally, I will not
give you two cents for a roomful of such signs, but afterwards
somebody explains to me that the marching up and down the aisles,
and the hollering, is a demonstration in favour of some proposition
before the convention, such as a candidate, or something else, and
in this case it turns out to be something else.</p>

<p>It seems that a state sign in such a procession means that the
delegates from this state like the proposition, but it also seems
that sometimes the delegates from a state are all split up, and
some are by no means in favour of the proposition, and they do not
like to see their sign lugged around and about, as it gives a wrong
impression.</p>

<p>Well, it all sounds like a lot of foolishness to me and most
unbecoming of grown guys and dolls, but there the skinny guy is,
tugging one way at the New York sign, and there Miss Maribel Marlo
is, tugging the other way and showing a strength that is most
surprising. In fact, she is even money in my book to out-tug the
skinny guy, when Harry the Horse arrives on the spot and lets go
with a neat left hook which connects with the skinny guy's
chin.</p>

<p>He drops to the floor all spraddled out, leaving Miss Maribel
Marlo still standing on the chair with the sign, and anybody can
see that she is greatly pleased with Harry the Horse's hook, as she
gives him a large smile and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"Oh," she says, "thank you so much! I am glad to see you are on
our side."</p>

<p>Well, just then a short chunky guy makes a reach for the sign,
and Harry the Horse lets go another hook, but this one lands on the
guy's noggin and only staggers him. Now the marching seems to stop,
and one and all commence surging towards Harry the Horse.</p>

<p>Nearly everybody present, including many dolls, seems to be
trying to get a pop at Harry, and he is letting punches fly right
and left, and doing very well with them indeed. In fact, he has
quite a number of guys down when a guy who seems to be about seven
feet high and very thick through the chest, comes pushing his way
through the crowd.</p>

<p>The big guy is wearing an Illinois badge, and as he pushes
through the crowd he speaks as follows: "Let me attend to this
matter," he says. Then when he finally gets close enough to Harry,
he hauls off and hits the back of Harry's neck and knocks him into
the chair on which Miss Maribel Marlo is standing. Personally I
consider the blow a rabbit punch, which is very illegal, but
anybody can see that the big guy is such a guy as is not apt to pay
any attention to the rules.</p>

<p>The chair on which Miss Maribel Marlo is standing goes down as
Harry the Horse hits it, and Miss Maribel Marlo goes with it, still
holding on to the sign, and as she gets down she lets out a loud
scream. She is up at once, however, and she does not seem to be
hurt, but she is very indignant, because she realizes the public
must see what kind of underwear she has on when she goes down.</p>

<p>She is holding the sign in both hands as she arises, and at the
same time Harry the Horse also comes up, but very weak and
staggering, and it is nothing but instinct that causes Harry to
reach for his hip pocket, because generally Harry has the old
equalizer in his pocket.</p>

<p>But when we arrive in town one of the first things Snooksy tells
us is that we must not go around rodded up except when he tells us,
as it seems that being rodded up is against the law in Chicago,
especially for strangers, so instead of the old equalizer what does
Harry find in his hip pocket but a bottle of good beer.</p>

<p>And when Harry finds this bottle of good beer in his hip pocket,
he also remembers about another bottle of good beer in the side
pocket of his coat, so he outs with both these bottles of good
beer, holding one in each hand by the nozzle, and starts waving
them around to get a good wind-up on them before dropping them on
some near-by noggins.</p>

<p>Well, personally I always consider this action most unfortunate,
as it seems the bottles of good beer give Miss Maribel Marlo a
wrong impression of Harry the Horse, especially as one of the
bottles suddenly pops open with a bang, what with the good beer
getting all churned up from the waving around, and the foam flies
every which way, some of it flying over Miss Maribel Marlo, who
speaks to Harry the Horse as follows:</p>

<p>"Oh," she says, "so you are one of the enemy, too, are you?"</p>

<p>And with this, Miss Maribel Marlo hauls off and whacks Harry
over the noggin with the New York sign, busting the sign staff in
two pieces, and knocking Harry out into the aisle, where the big
guy with the Illinois badge walks across Harry's chest, with
Colorado, Indiana, New Mexico, California and Georgia following him
one after the other.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Personally, I consider Miss Maribel Marlo's action very
unladylike, especially as it causes a great waste of good beer, but
when I visit Harry the Horse in hospital the next day he does not
seem as mad at her as he is sorrowful, because Harry says he learns
she makes a mistake, and he says anybody is apt to make a
mistake.</p>

<p>But, Harry says, it ends all his ideas of romance because he can
see that such mistakes are bad for a guy's health, especially as
this one mistake gives him five broken ribs, a broken collar bone,
a cauliflower ear and internal injuries. Harry says his future will
be devoted entirely to getting even with the big guy with the
Illinois badge, although, he says, he will not take this matter up
until after we dispose of the business for which we are invited to
Chicago.</p>

<p>But Snooksy, who is present at this discussion, does not seem to
think there will be any business for us. In fact, Snooksy states
that our hosts are disappointed in the outcome of our visit.</p>

<p>"You see," Snooksy says, "the big guy who assaults Harry is
nobody but Donkey O'Neill himself, in person, and," Snooksy says,
"the chances are, if he ever sees Harry again he will break his
legs as well as his ribs. So," Snooksy says, "my people think the
best thing you can do is to go home as soon as you are able,
although," he says, "they are greatly obliged to you, at that."</p>

<p>Now (Little Isadore says) you know the story of our trip to
Chicago, and what happens out there.</p>

<p>"But," I says to Little Isadore, "what is this convention of
which you speak, a Republican or a Democratic convention?"</p>

<p>"Well," Little Isadore says, "I never think to ask, and anyway,
this is not worrying me one way or the other. What is worrying me,"
he says, "and what is also worrying Harry the Horse and Spanish
John, is that Angie the Ox may hear the false rumour that is being
circulated in Chicago that we try to break up a demonstration in
the convention, in favour of beer because of Harry the Horse's love
for Miss Maribel Marlo. You see," Little Isadore says, "it seems
that Miss Maribel Marlo is one of the most notorious Drys in this
country."</p>

<h2><a name="A_LIGHT_IN_FRANCE" id="A_LIGHT_IN_FRANCE">13. A LIGHT
IN FRANCE</a>
</h2>

<p>IN the summer of 1936, a personality by the name of Blond
Maurice is found buried in a pit of quicklime up in Sullivan
County, or, anyway, what is found is all that is left of Maury,
consisting of a few odds and ends in the way of bones, and a pair
of shoes which have Brown the shoemaker's name in them, and which
Brown identifies as a pair of shoes he makes for Maury some months
before, when Maury is in the money and is able to have his shoes
made to order.</p>

<p>It is common gossip in all circles along Broadway that Maury is
placed in this quicklime by certain parties who do not wish him
well, and it is also the consensus of opinion that placing him
there is by no means a bad idea, at that, as Maury is really quite
a scamp and of no great credit to the community. In fact, when it
comes out that there is nothing left of him but a pair of shoes, it
is agreed by one and all that it is two shoes too many.</p>

<p>Well, knowing that Maury is quicklimed, it is naturally
something of a surprise to me to come upon him in Mindy's
Restaurant one evening in the spring of 1943, partaking of cheese
blintzes. At first I think I am seeing a ghost, but, of course, I
know that ghosts never come in Mindy's, and if they do, they never
eat cheese blintzes, so I realize that it is nobody but Maury
himself.</p>

<p>Consequently I step over to his table and give him a medium
hello, and he looks up and gives me a medium hello right back, for,
to tell the truth, Maury and I are never bosom friends. In fact, I
always give him plenty of the back of my neck because I learn long
ago that it is best not to associate with such harum-scarum
personalities unless, of course, you need them.</p>

<p>But naturally I am eager to hear of his experiences in the
quicklime as I never before meet a guy who returns from being
buried in this substance, so I draw up a chair and speak to him as
follows:</p>

<p>"Well, Maury," I say, "where are you all this time that I do not
see you around and about?"</p>

<p>"I am in a place called France," Maury says. "I leave there on
account of the war. Perhaps you hear of the war?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I say, "I hear rumours of it from time to time."</p>

<p>"It is a great nuisance," Maury says.</p>

<p>"But, Maury," I say, "how do you come to go to a place where
there is a war?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Maury says, "there is no war when I go there. The war is
here in New York. This city is very unsettled at the time, what
with the unpleasantness between my employer, the late Little
Kishke, and Sammy Downtown developing cases for the medical
examiner all over the layout. I am pleased to find on my return
that law and order now prevail."</p>

<p>"But, Maury," I say, "how do you stand with reference to law and
order?"</p>

<p>"I am in favour of both," Maury says.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am all right. Immediately upon my return, I call on the
D.A. in Manhattan to see if he has anything he wishes me to plead
guilty to, and he cannot find a thing, although he seems somewhat
regretful, at that.</p>

<p>"Then," Maury says, "I go over to Brooklyn and call on the D.A.
there, and he consults the books of Murder, Incorporated, and he
states that all he can find entered under my name is that I am
deceased, and that he hopes and trusts I will remain so. I am as
clean as a whistle, and," Maury says, "maybe cleaner."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "I am glad to hear this, Maury. I always know you
are sound at bottom. By the way, do you run into Girondel on your
travels? We hear that he is over there also. At least, he is absent
quite a spell. Girondel is always a great one for going around and
about in foreign lands."</p>

<p>"No," Maury says, "I do not see him there. But if you care to
listen, I will now relate to you my adventures in France."</p>

<p>Well (Maury says), I go to France when things come up that
convince me that I am not as popular as formerly with Sammy
Downtown and his associates, and, furthermore, I am tired out and
feel that I can use a little rest and peace.</p>

<p>And the reason I pick this France as a place to go to is because
I take a fancy to the country when I am there once on a pleasure
trip all over Europe as a guest of the late Drums Capello, who is
in the importing business, and what he imports is such merchandise
as morphine and heroin and sometimes a little opium.</p>

<p>But I wish to state that I have no part of Drums' play in this
respect and no part of his fall when the Brush finally catches up
with him. And, furthermore, I wish to state that I never approve of
his enterprise in any way whatever, but I must say he is a fine
host and takes me all over England and Germany, and introduces me
to many of his friends and business associates, and you can have
them.</p>

<p>Now, the exact spot in France to which I go is a sleepy little
town on the seacoast, but I cannot reveal the name at this time as
it is a military secret and, anyway, I am unable to pronounce it.
The main drag of this town faces a small harbour, and you can stand
in front of any place of business along the stem and almost flip a
dime into the water &mdash;if you happen to have a dime to
spare.</p>

<p>It is an old fishing spot, and when I first go there, it is
infested by fishermen with hay on their chins, and while most of
them inhabit dinky little houses in the town, others live on farms
about the size of napkins just outside the burg, and they seem to
divide their time between chasing fish and cows. But it is quiet
and peaceful there, and very restful after you get used to not
hearing the Broadway traffic.</p>

<p>I reside in a tiny gaff that is called a hotel on the main
street, and this gaff is run by a French bim by the name of Marie.
In fact, all bims in France seem to be named Marie when they are
not named Yvonne. I occasionally notice an old sack in the
background who may be Marie's mamma or her aunt or some such, but
Marie is strictly the boss of the trap and operates it in
first-class style. She is the chief clerk and the headwaiter and
she is also the bartender in the little smoky bar-room that opens
directly on the street, so, if the door is left open, you get
herring with your cognac.</p>

<p>I know she makes the beds and dusts up the three tiny bedrooms
in the joint, so you can see she is an all-around personality. She
is maybe twenty years old, and I will not attempt to describe her
except to say that if I am interested in the hugging and kissing
department, I will most certainly take my business to Marie,
especially as she speaks English, and you will not have to waste
time with the sign language.</p>

<p>Well, it is very pleasant, to be sure, strolling around the
little town talking to the fishermen or wandering out into the
country and observing the agriculturists, who seem to be mostly
female personalities who are all built in such a way that they will
never be able to sit down in a washtub with comfort, and who really
have very little glamour.</p>

<p>It is also very pleasant to nuzzle a dram or two in the cool of
the evening at a little table in front of Marie's hotel and it is
there I make the acquaintance of the only other roomer in the
hotel. He is a fat old guy who is nobody but Thaddeus T. Blackman,
a rich zillionaire from the city of New York and a lam-master from
the Brush boys back home for over twenty years on an income-tax
beef.</p>

<p>It seems that Thaddeus T. is mixed up in a large scandal about
oil lands, and a grand jury hands out readers right and left among
some of the best people in the U.S.A., although all they do is
swindle the government, and it is a great shock to them to learn
that this is against the law.</p>

<p>Anyway, Thaddeus T. starts running as soon as he gets wind of
the beef and does not pause for breath until he arrives in this
little town in France, and there he lives all these years. It seems
the Brush cannot touch him there, and why this is I do not know,
but I suppose it is because he is smart enough to take his zillions
with him, and naturally this kind of moolouw is protection on land
or sea.</p>

<p>He discusses his case with me once and gives me to understand
that it is a bum beef as far as he is concerned and that he only
takes the fall for others, but of course this is by no means an
unfamiliar tale to me, and, as he never mentions why he does not
try to chill the beef by paying the government the dough, I do not
consider it tactful to bring the matter up.</p>

<p>He is up in the paint-cards in age when I meet him, being maybe
close to seventy, and he is a fashion plate of the fashion of about
1922. Moreover, he seems to be a lonely old gee, though how anybody
can be lonely with all his zillions is a great mystery to me. He
always has a short briar pipe in his mouth and is generally
lighting it with little wax matches, and, in fact, I never see a
pipe man who is not generally lighting his pipe, and if ever I get
time I will invent a pipe that stays lit and make a fortune.</p>

<p>Anyway, Thaddeus T. and I become good friends over the little
table in front of the hotel, and then one day who shows up but an
old pal of mine out of the city of Boston, Mass, who is also an
absentee from a small charge of homicide in his home town.</p>

<p>He is called by the name of Mike the Mugger because it seems his
occupation is reaching out of doorways on dark nights and taking
passers-by by the neck and pulling them in close to him with one
hand and examining into their pockets with the other hand, the idea
of the hand around the neck being to keep them from complaining
aloud until he is through with them.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not consider this occupation at all essential
or even strictly ethical, but I always say every guy to his own
taste and naturally I have to respect Mike as the very top guy in
his profession who never makes a mistake except the one time he
clasps a customer too tight and too long and becomes involved in
this difficulty I mention.</p>

<p>He is about thirty-odd and is a nifty drifty in his dress and
very good company, except that he is seldom holding anything and is
generally leaning on me. However, I am personally loaded at this
time and I am not only pleased to okay Mike with Marie for the last
of her three rooms, but I stake him to walk-about money, which is
money for his pocket, and he is grateful to me in every
respect.</p>

<p>Naturally, Mike joins out with Thaddeus T. and me in strolling
here and there and in sitting at the little table in front of the
hotel or in the bar-room, talking and playing cards, and what we
generally talk about, of course, is the good old U.S.A., which is a
subject of great interest to all three of us.</p>

<p>A few fishermen and small merchants of the town are also usually
in the bar-room, and Marie is always behind the bar, and it is not
long before I notice that both Thaddeus T. and Mike the Mugger are
paying considerable attention to her. In fact, Mike tells me he is
in love with her and is surprised that I am not in the same
condition.</p>

<p>"But," Mike says, "of course I will never mention my love to
Marie because I am undoubtedly a low-class personality with a tough
beef against me and am unfit to associate with a nice lady
saloon-keeper."</p>

<p>As far as I can see, Thaddeus T.'s interest in Marie is more
fatherly than anything else, which is very nice if you like an old
wolf for a father. He tells me he wishes he has her for his
daughter because, he says, the one of his own back in the U.S.A. is
a dingbat and so is her mamma, and from the way he carries on about
them, I can see that Thaddeus T.'s former home life is far from
being a plug for matrimony.</p>

<p>Now it comes on 1939 and with it the war, and Thaddeus T., who
can gabble the frog language quite fluently and is always around on
the Ear-ie finding out what is going on, tells me that the people
of the town are pretty much worked up and that some of the guys are
going away to join the army, but it makes little difference in our
lives, as we seem to be outside the active war zone, and all we
know about any actual fighting is what we hear.</p>

<p>We still sit out in front of the hotel in the afternoon and in
the bar-room at night, though I observe Marie now pays more
attention to other customers than she does to us and is always
chattering to them in a most excited manner, and Thaddeus T. says
it is about the war. He says Marie is taking it to heart no little
and quite some.</p>

<p>But it is not until the summer of 1940 that Thaddeus T. and me
and even Mike really notice the war, because overnight the little
town fills up with German soldiers and other German guys who are
not soldiers but seem to be working gees, and it is plain to be
seen that something big is doing. Thaddeus T. says he hears they
are making a submarine base of the harbour because it is a very
handy spot for the subs to sneak out of and knock off the British
ships, and in fact after a while we see many subs and other
shipping along the quays.</p>

<p>Anyway, the Germans pay very little attention to us at first
except to examine our papers, and the officers who come into
Marie's bar for drinks are quite polite and nod to us and sometimes
talk to Thaddeus T., who speaks German better than he does French.
Presently we are practically ignoring the presence of the Germans
in our midst, although naturally Marie has no fancy for them
whatever and is always making faces at them behind their backs and
spitting on the ground when they pass, until I tell her that this
is unladylike.</p>

<p>Well, on coming home one night from a little stroll, I hear a
commotion in the kitchen, which is just off the bar-room, and on
entering I observe Marie wrestling with a big blubber in civilian
clothes who is wearing a small scrubbly moustache and a derby hat
and who has practically no neck whatever.</p>

<p>They are knocking kitchen utensils right and left, including a
pot of spaghetti which I know Marie prepares for my dinner and
which vexes me no little. Marie is sobbing and I can see that the
blubber is outwrestling her and in fact has a strangle hold on her
that figures to win him the fall very shortly. I am standing there,
admiring his technique in spite of my vexation over the spaghetti,
when Marie sees me and calls to me as follows:</p>

<p>"Please help me, Chauncey," which, as I forget to tell you
before, is at this time my monicker, and I am then in possession of
passports and other papers to prove same.</p>

<p>Naturally, I pay no attention to her, as I do not know on what
terms she is wrestling the blubber, but finally I see she is in
some distress, so I step forward and tap the bloke on the shoulder
and say to him like this:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," I say, "but the strangle hold is illegal.
If you are going to wrestle, you must obey the rules."</p>

<p>At this, the guy lets go of Marie and steps back and I say to
her in English, "Who is this plumber?"</p>

<p>"He is Herr Klauber," Marie says back to me in English. "He is
the head of the Gestapo in this district."</p>

<p>Well, then I get a good glaum at the gee and I see that he is
nobody but the same Klauber that Drums Capello does business with
in Hamburg the time I am Drums' guest, only in those days he is not
usually called by the name of Klauber. He is called the Vasserkopf,
which is a way of saying "waterhead" in German, because he has an
extra large sconce piece that is practically a deformity and as the
Vasserkopf he is known far and wide on two continents, and
especially here in New York where he once operates, as a very
sure-footed merchant in morphine, heroin, opium and similar
commodities.</p>

<p>Naturally, it is a great pleasure to me to behold a familiar
puss in a strange place, even if it is only the Vasserkopf's puss,
so I give him a sizeable hello and speak to him as follows:</p>

<p>"Well, Vasser," I say, "this is an unexpected privilege, to be
sure. There you are and here I am, and much water runs over the dam
since last we met, and how are you anyway?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" the Vasserkopf says in English and in a most
unfriendly manner.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Vasser," I say. "Let us not waste time in
shadow-boxing. Do you know our old pal Drums finally takes a fall
in Milwaukee, Wis., for a sixer?"</p>

<p>Then the Vasserkopf comes close to me and speaks to me in a low
voice like this: "Listen," he says, "it is in my mind to throw you
in the gaol house."</p>

<p>"Tut-tut, Vass," I say, "if you throw me in the gaol house, I
will be compelled to let out a bleat. I will be compelled to
remember the time you ship the cargo of Santa Clauses out of
Nuremberg and each Santa contains enough of the white to junk up
half of the good old U.S.A. I hear your Fuehrer is a strait-laced
gee, and what will he say if he hears one of his big coppers
peddles junk and maybe uses it?"</p>

<p>I can see the Vasserkopf turns a little pale around the guzzle
at this statement and he says: "Come outside. We will talk."</p>

<p>So I go outside the gaff with him, and we stand in the street in
the darkness and have quite a chat and the Vasserkopf becomes more
friendly, and tells me that he is now a real high-muck-a-muck with
the Gestapo and the greatest spy catcher in the racket. Then he
wishes to know what I am doing in these parts, and I tell him quite
frankly that I am there for my health and explain my ailment to
him. I also tell him why Thaddeus T. and Mike the Mugger are there
because I know that, as a former underworld personality, the
Vasserkopf is apt to be understanding and sympathetic in such
situations, especially when he knows my hole card is my knowledge
of his background in junk.</p>

<p>"Now, Vass," I say, "all we wish is to be let alone, and if you
can assist us in any way, I will personally be much obliged. What
is more," I say, "I will see that you are well rewarded, if a
member of the Gestapo takes."</p>

<p>"Sure," the Vasserkopf says. "Only let us understand one thing
right off the reel. The broad belongs to me. I am crazy about her.
But there is talk to-day at headquarters of closing this place and
putting her out of business because of her attitude, and because
one of our officers becomes ill after drinking cognac in here last
night.</p>

<p>"I will tell the dumb military he probably has a touch of
ptomaine," he continues. "I will tell them I need this hotel as a
listening post to find out what is going on among the people around
here. I will advise them not to molest you, as you are neutrals,
and it may make trouble with your government, although," the
Vasserkopf says, "I can see that the only trouble your government
may make will be for you. But the Reich is not interested in
American lammeroos, and neither am I as long as you remember the
dame is mine and see that I collect a hundred a week in your money.
I can scarcely sleep nights thinking of her."</p>

<p>Now this seems to me to be a very reasonable proposition all the
way found, except for the hundred a week. The way I look at it, the
Vasserkopf is at least entitled to Marie for his trouble because,
to tell the truth, it will be most inconvenient for Thaddeus T. and
Mike the Mugger and me to leave this spot at the moment, as there
is no other place we can go and no way of getting there if there is
such a place.</p>

<p>So I shave the Vasserkopf to half a C every week, and then I go
back into the hotel to find Marie in the bar with Thaddeus T. and
Mike, and I can see that she is quite agitated by her recent
experience with the Vasserkopf. I also learn from her that it is
not his first visit.</p>

<p>"He is here several times before," Marie says. "He comes to me
first with news of my brother who is a prisoner in a camp near
Hamburg. Herr Klauber tells me he can make things easier for Henri
and perhaps get him released. He comes again and again on different
excuses. I am frightened because I fear his motive." Then all of a
sudden Marie puts her fingers to her lips and says, "Hark!'</p>

<p>We hark, and I hear away off somewhere a sound that I know must
come from a lot of planes, and as this sound grows louder and
louder, and then dies away again, Marie says:</p>

<p>"English bombers," she says. "Every night they pass over here
and go on up the coast to drop their bombs. They do not know what
is going on here. Oh, if we can only show a light here to let them
know this is a place to strike&mdash;this nest of snakes."</p>

<p>"A light?" I say. "Why, if you show a light around here, these
squareheads will settle you in no time. Besides," I say, "it may
get me and my friends in a jam, and we are Americans and very
neutral. Let us not even think of showing a light and, Marie," I
say, "kindly cease sizzling every time you serve a German, and,
Mike, if you have any more Mickey Finns on your person, please take
them yourself instead of dropping them in officers' drinks."</p>

<p>"Who? Me?" Mike the Mugger says.</p>

<p>Well, I see the Vasserkopf in the hotel almost every day after
this talking to Marie, and he always gives me an E-flat hello and I
give him the same, and, while I can see that Marie is afraid of
him, she says he is now very polite to her and does not try to show
her any more holds.</p>

<p>Of course, I do not tell Marie about my deal with the Vasserkopf
and I do not tell Mike either, though I inform Thaddeus T., as I
expect him to kick with some of the dough, and he says okay and
that he is glad to learn that the Vasserkopf is on the take, only
he thinks the half a C is enough without throwing in Marie. But he
says a deal is a deal, and I can count on his co-operation.</p>

<p>From now on as far as we are concerned, everything seems to be
almost the same as before there is any war whatever, except that we
cannot go near the water front where the Germans are working and
everything has to be blacked out good after dark, and you cannot as
much as strike a match in the street, which is a great nuisance to
Thaddeus T., as he is always striking matches. In fact, he almost
gets his toupee blown off by sentries before he can break himself
of the habit of striking matches outdoors at night.</p>

<p>I can see that the Vasserkopf must be keeping his agreement to
front for us at headquarters, all right, and I am greasing him
every week per our arrangement, but I find myself bored by the
place, and I have a feeling that it is time for Mike the Mugger and
maybe Thaddeus T., too, to leave, especially as the Vasserkopf
accidentally drops a hint one day that he finds himself impeded in
his progress with Marie by our constant presence in the hotel and
that he thinks he is getting the short end of the deal. Finally, I
have a conference with Thaddeus T. and state my views to him.</p>

<p>"Yes," Thaddeus T. says, "you are a hundred per cent. right.
But," he says, "leaving here is not a simple matter for us now. I
am reliably informed that the military is likely to oppose our
departure for the present, because the sub base here is a great
secret and they do not care to run the risk of having us noise it
about.</p>

<p>"In fact," he says, "I am told that they are sorry they do not
chase us when they first come here, but now that they make this
mistake, they are not going to make another by letting us depart,
and other information that I hesitate to credit is that they may
wind up clapping us in a detention camp somewhere."</p>

<p>"Thaddeus T.," I say, "I am an American and so is Mike and so
are you, and our country is not concerned in this war. No one can
hold us here against our wishes."</p>

<p>Well, at this, Thaddeus T. lets out a large laugh, and I can see
his point and laugh with him, and then he informs me that for some
days he is personally laying plans for our departure and that he
buys a slightly tubercular motor-boat from a certain personality,
and has it hidden at this very moment in a little cove about a mile
up the coast and that all he now needs is a little petrol, which is
a way of saying gasoline, to run the boat with the three of us in
it out to sea, where we will have the chance of being picked
up.</p>

<p>Thaddeus T. explains to me that all the petrol in this vicinity
is in the hands of the Germans, but he says that where there is a
will, there is a way. Consequently, he makes arrangements with the
same personality who sells him the boat for a supply of gasoline,
and who is this personality but the Vasserkopf, and Thaddeus is
paying him more per gill for the gas than the old Vass ever gets
per ounce for his hop, and, as I am personally paying him
regularly, I can see that he is getting his coming and going and,
naturally, I have to admire his enterprise.</p>

<p>However, Thaddeus states that the Vasserkopf is really most
co-operative in every respect, and that he is to deliver the gas at
the hotel the following night, and moreover that he is going to
escort us to the cove so we will not be molested by any sentries we
may encounter in that vicinity, which I say is very nice of the
Vasserkopf though I seem to remember that there are never any
sentries in that vicinity anyway, as it is part of the coast that
does not seem to interest the Germans in any manner.</p>

<p>Then I get to meditating more and more on the Vasserkopf and on
what a big heart he has, to be sure, and as I am meditating I am
also sauntering late the next evening in a roundabout way up the
coast as I wish to confirm the presence of the boat in the cove
because, of course, there is the possibility of it getting away
after the Vasserkopf has it placed there.</p>

<p>My roundabout saunter carries me across the fields of the little
farms beyond the town that in some places run almost down to the
sea, and it is a route that the Germans are not apt to suspect as
taking me on any considerable journey, even if they notice me
sauntering, which I take care they do not.</p>

<p>Finally, I saunter through a field to a slight rise of ground
that overlooks the little cove, and there is just enough daylight
left by now for me to see a boat floating just offshore, and at
this same moment, I am surprised to scent the odour of fresh-turned
earth near at hand, and the reason I am surprised is because it is
now winter and by no means ploughing time.</p>

<p>Consequently, I look around and I am further surprised to
observe on this rise a newly made trench on the ground of a size
and shape that brings back many memories to me. So I saunter back
in a more roundabout way still meditating no little and quite some
on the Vasserkopf.</p>

<p>But, sure enough, he shows up this very night around nine
o'clock after Marie closes her place, and he brings with him two
five-gallon cans of gasoline which he delivers to Thaddeus T. in
the bar where Thaddeus and me and Mike the Mugger are waiting to
receive the gas. Then, after handing over the cans, the Vass goes
looking for Marie, saying he wishes to speak to her before
escorting us to the boat.</p>

<p>As soon as he leaves the bar, Mike the Mugger outs with his
pocketknife and stabs holes in two corners of the can and speaks as
follows: "It smells like gasoline on the outside, but we smear the
outside of cans with booze in the old bootleg days for the liquor
smell when there is only water inside the cans. I hear the
Vasserkopf is an old booter and he may remember the trick, and,
besides, I do not trust him on general principles."</p>

<p>Now Mike lifts the can up as if it is no more than a demitasse
and he holds it to his mouth so he can get a swig of the contents
through one of the holes, when all of a sudden who comes into the
bar all out of breath but Marie and who is right behind her but the
Vasserkopf, and there is no doubt that Marie is greatly flustered,
and the Vasserkopf is much perturbed.</p>

<p>"So," he says to me, "you are double-crossing me and are going
to take this omelette with you, hey? Well, it is a good thing I
walk in on her as she is packing a keister, and I am now arresting
her as a dangerous spy."</p>

<p>Marie begins to weep and wail and to carry on as bims will do
when they are flustered, and naturally Thaddeus T. and me and Mike
the Mugger are quite perplexed by this situation and, in fact, Mike
is so perplexed that he is still holding the can in his hands and
his cheeks are bulged out on each side from the gasoline in his
mouth as if he has the mumps.</p>

<p>I am about to say something to cool the Vasserkopf off, for, to
tell the truth, up to this minute I have no idea Marie is going
with us, though I can see from the way Thaddeus T. and Mike the
Mugger look that it is undoubtedly their idea. And, before I can
say anything, Mike steps up to the Vasserkopf and gives a huge
ploo-oo-oo and spews his mouthful of gasoline right in the
Vasserkopf's kisser and, as he gets his mouth clear, Mike says,
"Why, you muzzler, it is somewhat watered, just as I suspect."</p>

<p>Well, naturally, the gasoline runs off the Vasserkopf's face and
down over his clothes and he is standing there looking quite
nonplussed, and, as Mike the Mugger sees me gazing at him
disapprovingly, he becomes embarrassed and self-conscious and,
maybe to cover his confusion, he lifts the can of gasoline and
holds it over the Vasserkopf's head, and the gas pours out and
splashes off the old Vass' derby hat and splatters over his
shoulders while he just stands there nonplussed.</p>

<p>Thaddeus T. Blackman is leaning against the bar and, as usual,
he is lighting his pipe with a little wax match and watching the
Vasserkopf, and Marie has stopped crying and is laughing, and I am
just standing there, when we again hear the sound of the planes
high overhead and Thaddeus T. speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"A light you say, Marie?" he says. "A light for the
English?"</p>

<p>Then he flips the lighted match on the Vasserkopf, whose clothes
burst into flames at once and, almost as if they plan it all out
beforehand, Mike jumps to the front door and opens it, and Thaddeus
T. pushes the Vasserkopf, all ablaze, out the door into the street
and yells at him:</p>

<p>"Run for the water!" he yells. "Run, run, run!"</p>

<p>The Vasserkopf seems to see what he means and starts galloping
lickety-split towards the water front with Thaddeus T. puffing
along behind him and giving him a shove whenever he shows signs of
lagging, and Mike the Mugger runs up behind the Vasserkopf and
keeps throwing little spurts of gasoline on him by jerking the can
at him and, from the way it burns on the Vasserkopf, I think Mike's
statement of its dilution may be a slight exaggeration.</p>

<p>As he runs and burns, the Vasserkopf is letting out loud cries
which bring soldiers from every which way, and presently they start
shooting off their rifles in different directions. He is really
quite a bonfire there in the darkness, and now I hear once more far
overhead the drone of planes and I figure the English bombers see
the light and turn back over the town.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there is a whistling sound and then a big
<i>ker-bloom</i>, and then more whistling and more
<i>ker-blooms</i>, and there is no doubt in my mind that it is
Katie-bar-the-door for the water front and the subs lying along the
quays.</p>

<p>I can see the Vasserkopf still blazing and I can hear Thaddeus
T. still urging him to run, and now the bombs are shellacking the
surrounding buildings, and presently I hear, in between the blasts
of the bombs, some rifle shots, and I know the soldiers are firing
at Thaddeus T. and Mike the Mugger and maybe at the Vasserkopf,
too, for making the light.</p>

<p>In fact, by the glow shed by the Vasserkopf, I see old Thaddeus
stumble and fall, and Mike the Mugger go down right afterwards with
his can of gasoline blazing over him, but the Vasserkopf continues
on still in flames until he falls off the quay into the water and,
the chances are, goes out with a zizz.</p>

<p>Well, when I think of Marie, I turn from these unusual scenes to
the little hotel, but it is no longer there, because a bomb
flattens it, too, and it is now nothing but a pile of miscellany. I
do not have much time to look for Marie, as the German soldiers are
all over the layout, trying to learn what happens, but I finally
locate her with a big beam across her chest, and I can see that
there is nothing I can do for her except kiss her and say good-bye,
and when I do this, she murmurs, "Thanks," but I am sure it is only
for Thaddeus T. and Mike the Mugger and the light.</p>

<p>You will scarcely believe the difficulty I experience in getting
away from this unpleasant situation and out of the country. In
fact, I have only a vague recollection of my adventures now, but I
will always remember very clearly how neatly I slip past four
German soldiers sitting in the new-made trench on the rise of
ground above the cove, with a machine gun covering the cove itself,
and how I get in the boat and cut it loose and work it, with my
hands for paddles, to open water, before they realize what is going
on.</p>

<p>And I can never again have any respect for the memory of the
Vasserkopf when I take to meditating on his un-sportsmanlike
conduct in trying to double-cinch a sure thing with a machine gun,
although there are times before I am picked up at sea by an English
destroyer that I find myself wishing that Mike the Mugger does not
waste all the gasoline on the Vass, even if it is watered.</p>

<p>And this is all there is to the story (Maury says).</p>

<p>"But, Maury," I say, "do you not know that some remainders found
in a pit of quicklime up in Sullivan County are supposed to be
yours? They have on your shoes, which are identified by Brown the
shoemaker. Are you ever in a quicklime pit in Sullivan County and,
if so, what is it like?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Maury says, "I am in Sullivan County, all right, but never
in a quicklime pit. I go to Sullivan County at the invitation of
Girondel, and the purpose of his invitation is to discuss ways and
means of getting me straightened out with his chief, Sammy
Downtown.</p>

<p>"But one day," Maury says, "Girondel invites me to a stroll in
the woods with him and, while we are strolling, he is talking about
the beauties of the landscape and calling my attention to the
flowers and the birds, which is all very interesting, to be sure,
but something tells me that Girondel is by no means the nature
lover he seems.</p>

<p>"Finally," Maury says, "he strolls me to a spot in the deep,
tangled wildwood, and all of a sudden I catch an odour of something
I never scent but once before in my life but will never again
forget, and that is the time we lay the late Bugs Wonder to rest in
Greenvale Cemetery. It is the odour of the fresh-turned earth from
Bugs' last resting place.</p>

<p>"And as I catch this again in the woods," Maury says, "I realize
that somebody does some digging around there lately, so I quietly
give Girondel a boff over his pimple with a blackjack and flatten
him like a welcome mat. Then I examine my surroundings and, sure
enough, there, hidden by the shrubbery, I find a deep fresh-made
hole lined with quicklime, and I place Girondel in it and cover him
up and leave him with my best wishes.</p>

<p>"But, first," Maury says, "I change shoes with him because my
own are badly worn and, besides, I know that if ever he is found
the shoes will outlast the quick-lime and be traced as mine, and I
wish Girondel's connection to think I am no more. By the way," he
says, "the odour I mention is the same I notice on the rise of
ground at the cove in France which causes me to distrust the
Vasserkopf. I guess I am just naturally allergic to the odour of
new-made graves."</p>

<h2><a name="OLD_EMS_KENTUCKY_HOME" id="OLD_EMS_KENTUCKY_HOME">14.
OLD EM'S KENTUCKY HOME</a>
</h2>

<p>ALL this really begins the April day at the Jamaica race track
when an assistant starter by the name of Plumbuff puts a twitch on
Itchky Ironhat's fourteen-year-old race mare, Emaleen, who is known
to one and all as Em for short.</p>

<p>A twitch is nothing but a rope loop that they wrap around a
horse's upper lip and keep twisting with a stick to make the horse
stand quiet at the starting gate and while I never have a twitch on
my own lip and hope and trust that I never have same, I do not see
anything wrong with putting twitches on horses' lips, especially
the ones I am betting against as it generally keeps them so busy
thinking of how it hurts that they sometimes forget about
running.</p>

<p>However, it seems that Itchky Ironhat not only considers a
twitch very painful to horses, but he also considers it undignified
for such a horse as old Em, because while everybody else regards Em
as strictly a porcupine, Itchky thinks she is the best horse in the
world and loves her so dearly he cannot bear to see her in pain or
made to look undignified. To tell the truth, it is common gossip
that Itchky loves old Em more than he loves anything else whatever
including his ever-loving wife, Mousie.</p>

<p>In fact, when Mousie tells him one day that the time comes for a
show down and that it is either her or old Em and Itchky says well,
he guesses it is old Em, and Mousie packs up on him at once and
returns to her trade as an artists' model many citizens who
remember Mousie's shape think Itchky makes a bad deal, although
some claim that the real reason Itchky decides in favour of Em
against Mousie is not so much love as it is that Em never wishes
for any large thick sirloin steaks such as Mousie adores.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems that Itchky always goes to the trouble of
personally requesting the assistant starters not to place twitches
on Em's lip, even though he knows very well that she is by no means
a bargain at the post and that she greatly enjoys nibbling
assistant starters' ears off and when Plumbuff ignores his request
it vexes Itchky no little.</p>

<p>The night after the race he calls on Plumbuff at his home in
Jackson Heights and chides him quite some and he also gives him
such a going-over that Plumbuff is compelled to take to his bed
slightly indisposed for several weeks.</p>

<p>When the racing officials learn of the incident they call Itchky
before them and address him in very severe terms. They ask him if
he thinks old Em is Mrs. Man o' War, or what, that he expects great
courtesy for her from assistant starters and they say they have
half a mind to rule Itchky off the turf for life and old Em along
with him. But Itchky states that he only acts in self-defence and
that he can produce twenty witnesses who will testify that Plumbuff
pulls a blunt instrument on him first.</p>

<p>The chances are Itchky can produce these witnesses, at that, as
all he will have to do is go down to Mindy's restaurant on Broadway
and summon the first twenty horse players he sees. Horse players
hate and despise assistant starters because they feel that the
assistants are always giving the horses they bet on the worst of
the starts and naturally these horse players will deem it a
privilege and a pleasure to perjure themselves in a case of this
nature, especially for Itchky Ironhat, who is a popular
character.</p>

<p>His right name is something in twelve letters, but he is called
Itchky Ironhat because he always wears a black derby hat and
generally he has it pulled down on his head until the brim is
resting on his ears and as Itchky is a short, roly-poly guy with a
fat puss he really looks a great deal like a corked jug.</p>

<p>Finally the racing officials say they will not rule Itchky or
old Em off this time but that he must remove Em from the New York
tracks and run her elsewhere and this is wonderful news to the
assistant starters, who are awaiting the decision with
interest.</p>

<p>They feel that they are all sure to wind up daffy if they have
to always be deciding on whether to cater to old Em at the post or
take a going-over from Itchky Ironhat and in fact they say the only
thing that keeps them from going daffy on account of old Em long
before this is that she does not go to the post often.</p>

<p>She is entered in more races than any horse that ever lives, but
just before a race comes up Itchky generally starts figuring that
maybe the track will not suit her, or that the race is too long, or
maybe too short, or that it is not the right time of day, or that
old Em will not feel just like running that day, so he usually
withdraws her at the last minute.</p>

<p>Sometimes the racing officials are a little tough with owners
who wish to scratch horses from a race at the last minute, but they
never argue a second with Itchky Ironhat. In fact, they often give
three cheers when Em is taken out of a race, not only because she
is so cross at the post but because she is so slow that she is
always getting in the way of other horses and inconveniencing them
more than somewhat.</p>

<p>It is the way Itchky thinks old Em feels that figures with him
in taking her out of a race more than anything else, and to hear
him talk you will think she comes right out and informs him how she
feels every day. Indeed, Itchky converses with old Em as if she is
a human being and he claims she can understand everything he says,
though personally I do not believe any horse can understand a
slightly Yiddish dialect such as Itchky employs.</p>

<p>She is a big bay mare with a sway-back and of course she is
quite elderly for a horse, and especially a race horse, but Itchky
says she does not look her years. She is as fat as a goose what
with him feeding her candy, apples, cakes and ice-cream, besides a
little hay and grain, and she is wind-broken and a bleeder and has
knobs on her knees the size of baseballs.</p>

<p>She has four bad ankles and in fact the only thing that is not
the matter with her is tuberculosis and maybe anæmia. It makes some
horse owners shudder just to look at her but in Itchky Ironhat's
eyes old Em is more beautiful than Seabiscuit.</p>

<p>A guy by the name of Crowbar gives her to Itchky at the Woodbine
track in Canada when she is just a two-year-old, rising three. This
guy Crowbar buys her as a yearling out of a sale at Saratoga for
fifty fish but becomes discouraged about her when he notices that
she cannot keep up with a lead pony even when the pony is just
walking.</p>

<p>On top of this she bows a tendon, so Crowbar is taking her out
to shoot her to save the expense of shipping her and he is pretty
sore at having to waste a cartridge on her when he meets up with
Itchky Ironhat and Itchky asks what is coming off. When Crowbar
explains, Itchky Ironhat takes a closer look at Em and she gazes at
him with such a sorrowful expression that Itchky's heart is
touched.</p>

<p>He asks Crowbar to give her to him, although at this time Itchky
is just doing the best he can around the tracks and has about as
much use for a racehorse as he has for a hearse, and naturally
Crowbar is pleased to make the saving of a cartridge. So this is
how Itchky becomes the owner of old Em and from now on he
practically lives with her even after he marries Mousie, which is
what starts Mousie to complaining, as it seems she does not care to
be excluded from her home life by a horse.</p>

<p>It is no use trying to tell Itchky that Em is nothing but an old
buzzard, because he keeps thinking of her as a stake horse and
saying she is bound to win a large stake someday and he spends
every dime he can get hold of in entering her in big races and on
shipping her and feeding her and on jockey fees.</p>

<p>And all this is very surprising to be sure, as Itchky Ironhat is
by no means a sucker when it comes to other horses and he makes a
pretty good living hustling around the tracks. What is more, the
way he can bring old Em back to the races every time she breaks
down, which is about every other time she starts in a race, shows
that Itchky is either a natural-born horse trainer or a horse
hypnotist.</p>

<p>When he is very desperate for a little moolah, he will place Em
in a cheap selling race and it is in spots such as this that she
occasionally wins. But then Itchky always worries himself sick for
fear somebody will claim her, the idea of a claiming race being
that another owner can always claim a horse in such a race by
putting up the price for which the horse is entered, which may be
anywhere from a few hundred dollars on up, according to the
conditions of the race and what the owner thinks his horse is
worth.</p>

<p>Naturally, Itchky has to run old Em for as cheap a price as
horses are ever run for her to win a race, but even then there is
really no sense in him worrying about her being claimed as no owner
with any brains wants such a lizard as old Em in his barn, and
especially after what happens to a character by the name of One
Thumb Haverstraw.</p>

<p>This One Thumb is considered quite a joker and one day in
Maryland he claims old Em out of a race for eight hundred boffoes
just for a joke on Itchky, although personally I always figure the
joke is on One Thumb when he gets her for this price.</p>

<p>Itchky is really greatly dejected over losing old Em and he goes
to see One Thumb fight after the race and tries to buy her back for
two hundred dollars over the claiming price, but One Thumb is so
pleased with his joke that he refuses to sell and then the most
surprising things begin to occur to him.</p>

<p>A few nights later a ghost in a white sheet appears at his barn
and frightens away all the coloured parties who are working for him
as stable-hands and turns all of One Thumb's horses out of their
stalls except old Em and chases them around the country until they
are worn plumb out and are no good for racing for some weeks to
come.</p>

<p>What is more, every time One Thumb himself steps into the open
at night, a bullet whistles past him and finally one breezes
through the seat of his pants and at this he hunts up Itchky
Ironhat and returns old Em to him for four hundred less than the
claiming price and considers it a great bargain, at that, and
nobody ever plays any more jokes on Itchky with old Em.</p>

<p>Now the night of the racing officials' decision, I am sitting in
Mindy's restaurant enjoying some choice pot roast with potato
pancakes when in comes Itchky Ironhat looking somewhat depressed
and, as he takes a seat at my table, naturally I tell him I deeply
regret hearing that he will no longer be permitted to run old Em in
Yew York, and Itchky sighs and says: "Well," he says, "it is a
great loss to the racing public of this state, but I always wish to
do something nice for old Em and this gives me the opportunity of
doing it."</p>

<p>"What will be something nice for her, Itchky?" I say.</p>

<p>"Why," Itchky says, "I take her many places the past dozen
years, but there is one place I never take her and that is her old
home. You see, Em comes from the Bluegrass country of Kentucky and
I get to thinking that the nicest thing I can do for her is to take
her there and let her see the place where she is born."</p>

<p>"Itchky" I say, "how is the bank roll?"</p>

<p>"It is thin," Itchky says. "In fact, if you are thinking of a
touch, it is practically invisible."</p>

<p>"I am not thinking of such a thing," I say. "What I am thinking
of is it will cost a gob to ship old Em to Kentucky."</p>

<p>"Oh," Itchky says, "I do not intend to ship her. I intend to
take her there in person by motor truck and I am wondering if you
will not like to go with us for company, Old Em loves company.
After we let her see her old home we can drop her in a stake race
at Churchill Downs and win a package."</p>

<p>Then Itchky explains to me that he acquires a truck that very
afternoon from a vegetable pedlar for the sum of sixty dollars and
that he also gets a couple of wide, strong planks which he figures
he can let down from the rear end of the truck like a runway so old
Em can walk on them getting on and off the truck and that by
driving by day and resting by night he can take her to the
Bluegrass of Kentucky this way very nicely.</p>

<p>Now it is coming on time for the Kentucky Derby and if there is
one thing I wish to see it is this event, and furthermore I never
get around the country much and I figure that such a journey will
be most educational to me so I tell Itchky he has a customer. But
if I see the truck first I will certainly never think of trying to
get anywhere in it, not even to the Polo Grounds.</p>

<p>Of course when Itchky tells me the truck costs him only sixty
dollars, I am not looking for a fancy truck, but I have no idea it
is going to be older than Henry Ford, or anyway Edsel, and not much
bigger than a pushcart and with no top whatever, even over the
seat.</p>

<p>The body of the truck is not long enough for old Em to stand in
it spraddled out, the way horses love to stand, or her hind legs
will be hanging out the rear end, so what Itchky does is to push
her front legs back and her hind legs forward, so that all four
feet are close together under her like she is standing on a
dime.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider this an uncomfortable position all the
way around for a horse but when Itchky and I get on the seat and Em
finds she can rest her head on Itchky's shoulder, she seems quite
happy, especially as Itchky talks to her most of the time.</p>

<p>It is no time after we start that we find old Em makes the truck
top-heavy and in fact she almost falls overboard every time we take
a curve and Itchky has to choke down to about two miles per hour
until all of a sudden Em learns how to lean her weight to one side
of the truck or the other on the curves and then Itchky can hit it
up to the full speed of the truck, which is about ten miles per
hour. I will say one thing for old Em, I never see a brighter horse
in my life.</p>

<p>The first time we stop to take her off for the night, we find
that the plank runway is all right for loading her because she can
run up the boards like a squirrel but they have too much of a pitch
for her to walk down them, so finally we drop the tail gate and get
hold of the front end of the truck and lift it gently and let her
slide down to the ground like she was on a toboggan and I always
claim that old Em likes this better than any other part of the
trip.</p>

<p>It seems to be a most surprising spectacle to one and all along
our route to see a truck going past with a horse leaning this way
and that to keep balanced and with forty per cent. of her sticking
out of one end of the truck, and twenty per cent. of her sticking
out of the other end, and we often attract many spectators when we
stop. This is whenever we have a blow-out, which is every now and
then. Sometimes there is much comment among these spectators about
old Em and as it is generally comment of an unfavourable nature, I
am always having difficulty keeping Itchky from taking pops at
spectators.</p>

<p>We sleep at night in the truck with old Em tied to the rear end
and we use her spare blankets for covering as Em has more blankets
than any other horse in the country and most of them are very fancy
blankets, at that. It is not bad sleeping except when it rains and
then Itchky takes all the blankets off us and puts them on Em and
my overcoat too, and we have to sit up under the truck and the way
Itchky worries about Em catching cold is most distressing.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we are rolling along the road and Em is dozing on
Itchky's shoulder, he talks to me instead of her, and I ask him if
he knows just where to find Em's old home in the Bluegrass
country.</p>

<p>"No," he says, "I do not know just where, but the record book
gives the breeder of Em as the Tucky Farms and it must be a
well-known breeding establishment to produce such a horse as Em, so
we will have no trouble finding it. By the way," Itchky says, "Em
comes of a very high-class family. She is by an important stallion
by the name of Christofer out of a mare called Love Always, but,"
he says, "the curious thing about it is I am never able to learn of
another horse of this breeding in this country, though Christofer
is once a good race horse in France."</p>

<p>Personally, I consider it a great thing for this country that
there is only one horse bred like Em but naturally I do not mention
such a thought to Itchky Ironhat, not only because I know it will
displease him but because I am afraid old Em may overhear me and be
greatly offended.</p>

<p>The road signs state that we are a few miles out of the city of
Lexington, Ky., and we know we are now down in the Bluegrass
country, when we come upon a tall old guy leaning against a fence
in front of a cute little white house. This old guy looks as if he
may be a native of these parts as he is wearing a wide-brimmed soft
hat and is chewing on a straw, so Itchky stops the truck and puts
on a Southern accent and speaks to him as follows:</p>

<p>"Suh," Itchky says, "can you all direct me to a place called the
Tucky Farms, suh?"</p>

<p>The tall old guy gazes at Itchky and then he gazes at me and
finally he gazes at old Em and he never stops chewing on the straw
and after a while he smiles and points and says:</p>

<p>"It is about three miles up that road," he says. "It is a big
red brick house with some burned-down barns in the background, but
friend," he says, "let me give you a piece of good advice. I do not
know what your business is, but keep away from that place with
anything that looks like a horse. Although," he says, "I am not
sure that the object you have on your truck answers such a
description."</p>

<p>Of course Itchky can see from this crack that the old guy is
making fun of Em and he starts to sizzle all over and forgets his
Southern accent at once and says:</p>

<p>"You do not like my horse?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is a horse, then?" the old guy says. "Well, the party
who owns Tucky Farms is a trifle eccentric about horses. In fact,
he is eccentric about everything, but horses most of all. He does
not permit them on his premises. It is a sad case. You may meet a
disagreeable reception if you go there with your so-called
horse."</p>

<p>Then he turns and walks into the cute little white house and I
have all I can do to keep Itchky from going after him and
reprimanding him for speaking so disrespectfully of old Em,
especially as the old guy keeps looking around at us and we can see
that he is smiling more than somewhat.</p>

<p>Itchky drives on up the road a little ways and, just as the old
guy says, we come upon a big red brick house and there is no doubt
that this is the Tucky Farms because there is a faded sign over an
arched gateway that so states. The house is all shuttered up and is
on a small hill pretty well back from the road and not far from the
house are the remainders of some buildings that look as if they
burned down a long time ago and are never fixed up again or cleared
away.</p>

<p>In fact, the grounds and the house itself all look as if they
can stand a little attention and there is not a soul in sight and
it is rather a dismal scene in every respect. The gate is closed,
so I get down off the truck and open it and Itchky drives the truck
in and right up to the front door of the house under a sort of
porch with white pillars.</p>

<p>Now the truck makes a terrible racket and this racket seems to
stir up a number of coloured parties who appear from around in back
of the house, along with a large white guy. This large guy is
wearing corduroy pants and laced boots and a black moustache and he
is also carrying a double-barrelled shotgun and he speaks to Itchky
in a fierce tone of voice as follows:</p>

<p>"Pigface," he says, "get out of here. Get out of here before you
are hurt. What do you mean by driving in here with a load of dog
meat such as this, anyway?"</p>

<p>He points a finger at old Em who has her head up and is
snuffling the air and gazing about her with great interest, and
right away Itchky climbs down off the seat of the truck and removes
his derby and places it on the ground and takes off his coat and
starts rolling up his sleeves.</p>

<p>"It is the last straw," Itchky Ironhat says. "I will first make
this big ash can eat that cannon he is lugging and then I will beat
his skull in. Nobody can refer to Emaleen as dog meat and
live."</p>

<p>Now the front door of the house opens and out comes a thin
character in a soiled white linen suit and at first he seems to be
quite an old character as he has long white hair but when he gets
closer I can see that he is not so very old at that, but he is very
seedy-looking and his eyes have a loose expression. I can also see
from the way the large guy and the coloured parties step back that
this is a character who packs some weight around here. His voice is
low and hard as he speaks to Itchky Ironhat and says:</p>

<p>"What is this?" he says. "What name do I just hear you
pronounce?"</p>

<p>"Emaleen," Itchky says. "It is the name of my race mare which
you see before you. She is the greatest race mare in the world. The
turf records say she is bred right here at this place and I bring
her down here to see her old home, and everybody insults her. So
this is Southern hospitality?" Itchky says.</p>

<p>The new character steps up to the truck and looks at old Em for
quite a spell and all the time he is shaking his head and his lips
are moving as if he is talking to himself, and finally he says to
the large guy:</p>

<p>"Unload her," he says. "Unload her and take good care of her,
Dobkins. I suppose you will have to send to one of the neighbours
for some feed. Come in, gentlemen," he says to Itchky and me and he
holds the front door of the house open. "My name is Salsbury," he
says. "I am the owner of Tucky Farms and I apologize for my
foreman's behaviour but he is only following orders."</p>

<p>As we go into the house I can see that it is a very large house
and I can also see that it must once be a very grand house because
of the way it is furnished, but everything seems to be as run-down
inside as it does outside and I can see that what this house needs
is a good cleaning and straightening gout.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Salsbury keeps asking Itchky Ironhat
questions about old Em and when he hears how long Itchky has her
and what he thinks of her and all this and that, he starts wiping
his eyes with a handkerchief as if the story makes him very sad,
especially the part about why Itchky brings her to the
Bluegrass.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Salsbury leads us into a large room that seems to
be a library and at one end of this room there is a painting taller
than I am of a very beautiful Judy in a white dress and this is the
only thing in the house that seems to be kept dusted up a little
and Mr. Salsbury points to the painting and says:</p>

<p>"My wife, Emaleen, gentlemen. I name the horse you bring here
after her long ago, because it is the first foal of her favourite
mare and the first foal of a stallion I import from France."</p>

<p>"By Christofer, out of Love Always," Itchky Ironhat says.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Salsbury says. "In those days, Tucky Farm is one of
the great breeding and racing establishments of the Bluegrass. In
those days, too, my wife is known far and wide for her fondness for
horses and her kindness to them. She is the head of the humane
society in Kentucky and the Emaleen Salsbury annual award of a
thousand dollars for the kindest deed towards a horse brought to
the attention of the society each year is famous.</p>

<p>"One night," Mr. Salsbury continues, "there is a fire in the
barns and my wife gets out of bed and before anyone can stop her
she rushes into the flames trying to save her beautiful mare, Love
Always. They both perish, and," he says, "with them perishes the
greatest happiness ever given a mortal on this earth."</p>

<p>By this time, Itchky Ironhat and I are feeling very sad, indeed,
and in fact all the creases in Itchky's face are full of tears as
Mr. Salsbury goes on to state that the only horses on the place
that are saved are a few yearlings running in the pastures. He
sends them all with a shipment a neighbour is taking to Saratoga to
be disposed of there for whatever they will bring.</p>

<p>"Your mare Emaleen is one of those," he says. "I forget all
about her at the time. Indeed," he says, "I forget everything but
my unhappiness. I feel I never wish to see of hear of a horse again
as long as I live and I withdraw myself completely from the world
and all my former activities. But," he says, "your bringing the
mare here awakens old fond memories and your story of how you
cherish her makes me realize that this is exactly what my wife
Emaleen will wish me to do. I see where I sadly neglect my duty to
her memory. Why," he says, "I never even keep up the Emaleen
Salsbury award."</p>

<p>Now he insists that we must remain there a while as his guests
and Itchky Ironhat agrees, although I point out that it will be
more sensible for us to move on to Louisville and get into action
as quickly as possible because we are now practically out of funds.
But Itchky takes a look at old Em and he says she is enjoying
herself so much running around her old home and devouring grass
that it will be a sin and a shame to take her away before it is
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>After a couple of days, I tell Itchky that I think absolutely
necessary arrives, but Itchky says Mr. Salsbury now wishes to give
a dinner in honour of old Em and he will not think of denying her
this pleasure. And for the next week the house is overrun with
coloured parties, male and female, cleaning up the house and
painting and cooking and dusting and I do not know what all else,
and furthermore I hear there is a great to-do all through the
Bluegrass country when the invitations to the dinner start going
around, because this is the first time in over a dozen years that
Mr. Salsbury has any truck whatever with his neighbours.</p>

<p>On the night of the dinner, one of the male coloured parties
tells me that he never before sees such a gathering of the
high-toned citizens of the Bluegrass as are assembled in a big
dining hall at a horse-shoe shaped table with an orchestra going
and with flowers and flags and racing colours all around and about.
In fact, the coloured party says it is just like the old days at
Tucky Farms when Mr. Salsbury's wife is alive, although he says he
does not remember ever seeing such a character sitting alongside
Mr. Salsbury at the table as Itchky Ironhat.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Itchky Ironhat seems to puzzle all the guests
no little and it is plain to be seen that they are wondering who he
is and why he is present, though Itchky is sharpened up with a
fresh shave and has on a clean shirt and of course he is not
wearing his derby hat. Personally, I am rather proud of Itchky's
appearance, but I can see that he seems to be overplaying his knife
a little, especially against the mashed potatoes.</p>

<p>Mr. Salsbury is dressed in a white dinner jacket and his eyes
are quiet and his hair is trimmed and his manner is most genteel in
every way and when the guests are seated he gets to his feet and
attracts their attention by tapping on a wineglass with a spoon.
Then he speaks to them as follows:</p>

<p>"Friends and neighbours," he says. "I know you are all surprised
at being invited here but you may be more surprised when you learn
the reason. As most of you are aware, I am as one dead for years.
Now I live again. I am going to restore Tucky Farms to all its old
turf glory in breeding and racing, and," he says, "I am going to
re-establish the Emaleen Salsbury award, with which you are
familiar, and carry on again in every way as I am now certain my
late beloved wife will wish."</p>

<p>Then he tells them the story of old Em and how Itchky Ironhat
cares for her and loves her all these years and how he brings her
to the Bluegrass just to see her old home, but of course he does
not tell them that Itchky also plans to later drop her in a race at
Churchill Downs, as it seems Itchky never mentions the matter to
him.</p>

<p>Anyway, Mr. Salsbury says that the return of old Em awakens him
as if from a bad dream and he can suddenly see how he is not doing
right with respect to his wife's memory and while he is talking a
tall old guy who is sitting next to me, and who turns out to be
nobody but the guy who directs us to Tucky Farms, says to me like
this:</p>

<p>"It is a miracle," he says. "I am his personal physician and I
give him up long ago as a hopeless victim of melancholia. In fact,
I am always expecting to hear of him dismissing himself from this
world entirely. Well," the old guy says, "I always say medical
science is not everything."</p>

<p>"My first step towards restoring Tucky Farms," Mr. Salsbury goes
on, "is to purchase the old mare Emaleen from Mr. Itchky Ironhat
here for the sum of three thousand dollars, which we agree upon
this evening as a fair price. I will retire her of course for the
rest of her days, which I hope will be many."</p>

<p>With this he whips out a cheque and hands it to Itchky and
naturally I him somewhat surprised at the sum mentioned because I
figure if old Em is worth three G's War Admiral must be worth a
jillion. However, I am also greatly pleased because I can see where
Itchky and I will have a nice taw for the races at Churchill Downs
without having to bother about old Em winning one.</p>

<p>"Now," Mr. Salsbury says, "for our guest of honour."</p>

<p>Then two big doors at one end of the banquet hall open wide and
there seems to be a little confusion outside and a snorting and a
stamping as if a herd of wild horses is coming in and all of a
sudden who appears in the doorway with her mane and tail braided
with ribbons and her coat all slicked up but old Em and who is
leading her in but the large guy who insults her and also Itchky on
our arrival at Tucky Farms.</p>

<p>The guests begin applauding and the orchestra plays My Old
Kentucky Home and it is a pleasant scene to be sure, but old Em
seems quite unhappy about something as the large guy pulls her into
the hollow of the horseshoe-shaped table, and the next thing
anybody knows, Itchky Ironhat climbs over the table, knocking
glasses and dishes every which way and flattens the large guy with
a neat left hook in the presence of the best people of the
Bluegrass country.</p>

<p>Naturally, this incident causes some comment and many of the
guests are slightly shocked and there is considerable criticism of
Itchky Ironhat for his lack of table manners. But then it is agreed
by one and all present that Itchky is undoubtedly entitled to the
Emaleen Salsbury kindness to horses award when I explain that what
irks him is the fact that the large guy leads old Em in with a
twitch on her lip.</p>

<p>Well, this is about all there is to the story, except that
Itchky and I go over to the Louisville the next day and remain
there awaiting the Kentucky Derby and we have a wonderful time, to
be sure, except that we do not seem to be able to win any bets on
the horse races at Churchill Downs.</p>

<p>In fact, the day before the Derby, Itchky remarks that the bank
roll is now lower than a turtles vest buttons and when I express
surprise that we toss off four G's in such a short period, Itchky
says to me like this:</p>

<p>"Oh," he says, "it is not four G's. I send the Emaleen Salsbury
kindness-to-horses award of one G to Mousie. I figure she is
legally entitled to this for leaving me with Em. Otherwise, we will
never get even the three and besides," Itchky says, "I love Mousie.
In fact, I invite her to join me here and she agrees to come after
I promise I will never as much as think of old Em again.</p>

<p>"By the way," Itchky says, "I call up Tucky Farms this morning
and Mr. Salsbury brings old Em into his study and lets her hear my
voice over the phone. Mr. Salsbury says she is greatly pleased. I
give her your love, but of course not as much of yours as I give
her of mine," he says.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Itchky," I say, and at this moment I am somewhat
surprised to notice a metal ash tray removing Itchky's derby hat
from his head and, gazing about, who do I observe standing in the
doorway and now taking dead aim at Itchky with another tray but his
ever-loving wife, Mousie.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="JOHNNY_ONE-EYE" id="JOHNNY_ONE-EYE">15. JOHNNY
ONE-EYE</a>
</h2>

<p>This cat I am going to tell you about is a very small cat, and
in fact it is only a few weeks old, consequently it is really
nothing but an infant cat. To tell the truth, it is just a
kitten.</p>

<p>It is grey and white and very dirty and its fur is all frowzled
up, so it is a very miserable-looking little kitten to be sure the
day it crawls through a broken basement window into an old house in
East Fifty-third Street over near Third Avenue in the city of New
York and goes from room to room saying merouw, merouw in a low,
weak voice until it comes to a room at the head of the stairs on
the second story where a guy by the name of Rudolph is sitting on
the floor thinking of not much.</p>

<p>One reason Rudolph is sitting on the floor is because there is
nothing else to sit on as this is an empty house that is all
boarded up for years and there is no furniture whatever in it, and
another reason is that Rudolph has a .38 slug in his side and
really does not feel like doing much of anything but sitting. He is
wearing a derby hat and his overcoat as it is in the wintertime and
very cold and he has an automatic Betsy on the floor beside him and
naturally he is surprised quite some when the little kitten comes
merouwing into the room and he picks up the Betsy and points it at
the door in case anyone he does not wish to see is with the kitten.
But when he observes that it is all alone, Rudolph puts the Betsy
down again and speaks to the kitten as follows:</p>

<p>"Hello, cat," he says.</p>

<p>Of course the kitten does not say anything in reply except
merouw but it walks right up to Rudolph and climbs on his lap,
although the chances are if it knows who Rudolph is it will
hightail it out of there quicker than anybody can say scat. There
is enough daylight coming through the chinks in the boards over the
windows for Rudolph to see that the kitten's right eye is in bad
shape, and in fact it is bulged half out of its head in a most
distressing manner and it is plain to be seen that the sight is
gone from this eye. It is also plain to be seen that the injury
happens recently and Rudolph gazes at the kitten a while and starts
to laugh and says like this:</p>

<p>"Well, cat," he says, "you seem to be scuffed up almost as much
as I am. We make a fine pair of invalids here together. What is
your name, cat?"</p>

<p>Naturally, the kitten does not state its name but only goes
merouw and Rudolph says, "All right, I will call you Johnny. Yes,"
he says, "your tag is now Johnny One-Eye."</p>

<p>Then he puts the kitten in under his overcoat and pretty soon it
gets warm and starts to purr and Rudolph says:</p>

<p>"Johnny," he says, "I will say one thing for you and that is you
are plenty game to be able to sing when you are hurt as bad as you
are. It is more than I can do."</p>

<p>But Johnny only goes merouw again and keeps on purring and by
and by it falls sound asleep under Rudolph's coat and Rudolph is
wishing the pain in his side will let up long enough for him to do
the same.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose you are saying to yourself, what is this Rudolph
doing in an old empty house with a slug in his side, so I will
explain that the district attorney is responsible for this
situation. It seems that the D.A. appears before the grand jury and
tells it that Rudolph is an extortion guy and a killer and I do not
know what all else, though some of these statements are without
doubt a great injustice to Rudolph as, up to the time the D.A.
makes them, Rudolph does not kill anybody of any consequence in
years.</p>

<p>It is true that at one period of his life he is considered a
little wild but this is in the 1920's when everybody else is, too,
and for seven or eight years he is all settled down and is engaged
in business organization work, which is very respectable work,
indeed. He organizes quite a number of businesses on a large scale
and is doing very good for himself. He is living quietly in a big
hotel all alone, as Rudolph is by no means a family guy, and he is
highly spoken of by one and all when the D.A. starts poking his
nose into his affairs, claiming that Rudolph has no right to be
making money out of the businesses, even though Rudolph gives these
businesses plenty of first-class protection.</p>

<p>In fact, the D.A. claims that Rudolph is nothing but a racket
guy and a great knock to the community, and all this upsets Rudolph
no little when it comes to his ears in a roundabout way. So he
calls up his lawbooks and requests legal advice on the subject and
lawbooks says the best thing he can think of for Rudolph to do is
to become as inconspicuous as possible right away but to please not
mention to anyone that he gives this advice.</p>

<p>Lawbooks says he understands the D.A. is requesting indictments
and is likely to get them and furthermore that he is rounding up
certain parties that Rudolph is once associated with and trying to
get them to remember incidents in Rudolph's early career that may
not be entirely to his credit. Lawbooks says he hears that one of
these parties is a guy by the name of Cute Freddy and that Freddy
makes a deal with the D.A. to lay off of him if he tells everything
he knows about Rudolph, so under the circumstances a long journey
by Rudolph will be in the interest of everybody concerned.</p>

<p>So Rudolph decides to go on a journey but then he gets to
thinking that maybe Freddy will remember a little matter that
Rudolph long since dismisses from his mind and does not wish to
have recalled again, which is the time he and Freddy do a job on a
guy by the name of The Icelander in Troy years ago and he drops
around to Freddy's house to remind him to be sure not to remember
this.</p>

<p>But it seems that Freddy, who is an important guy in business
organization work himself, though in a different part of the city
than Rudolph, mistakes the purpose of Rudolph's visit and starts to
out with his rooty-toot-toot and in order to protect himself it is
necessary for Rudolph to take his Betsy and give Freddy a little
tattooing. In fact, Rudolph practically crockets his monogram on
Freddy's chest and leaves him exceptionally deceased.</p>

<p>But as Rudolph is departing from the neighbourhood, who bobs up
but a young guy by the name of Buttsy Fagan, who works for Freddy
as a chauffeur and one thing and another, and who is also said to
be able to put a slug through a keyhole at forty paces without
touching the sides though I suppose it will have to be a pretty
good-sized keyhole. Anyway, he takes a long-distance crack at
Rudolph as Rudolph is rounding a corner, but all Buttsy can see of
Rudolph at the moment is a little piece of his left side and this
is what Buttsy hits, although no one knows it at the time, except
of course Rudolph, who just keeps on departing.</p>

<p>Now this incident causes quite a stir in police circles, and the
D.A. is very indignant over losing a valuable witness and when they
are unable to locate Rudolph at once, a reward of five thousand
dollars is offered for information leading to his capture alive or
dead and some think they really mean dead. Indeed, it is publicly
stated that it is not a good idea for anyone to take any chances
with Rudolph as he is known to be armed and is such a character as
will be sure to resent being captured, but they do not explain that
this is only because Rudolph knows the D.A. wishes to place him in
the old rocking chair at Sing Sing and that Rudolph is quite
allergic to the idea.</p>

<p>Anyway, the cops go looking for Rudolph in Hot Springs and Miami
and every other place except where he is, which is right in Yew
York wandering around town with the slug in his side, knocking at
the doors of old friends requesting assistance. But all the old
friends do for him is to slam the doors in his face and forget they
ever see him, as the D.A. is very tough on parties who assist guys
he is looking for, claiming that this is something most illegal
called harbouring fugitives. Besides Rudolph is never any too
popular at best with his old friends as he always plays pretty much
of a lone duke and takes the big end of everything for his.</p>

<p>He cannot even consult a doctor about the slug in his side as he
knows that nowadays the first thing a doctor will do about a guy
with a gunshot wound is to report him to the cops, although Rudolph
can remember when there is always a sure-footed doctor around who
will consider it a privilege and a pleasure to treat him and keep
his trap closed about it. But of course this is in the good old
days and Rudolph can see they are gone forever. So he just does the
best he can about the slug and goes on wandering here and there and
around and about and the blats keep printing his picture and
saying, where is Rudolph?</p>

<p>Where he is some of the time is in Central Park trying to get
some sleep, but of course even the blats will consider it foolish
to go looking for Rudolph there in such cold weather, as he is
known as a guy who enjoys his comfort at all times. In fact, it is
comfort that Rudolph misses more than anything as the slug is
commencing to cause him great pain and naturally the pain turns
Rudolph's thoughts to the author of same and he remembers that he
once hears somebody say that Buttsy lives over in East Fifty-third
Street.</p>

<p>So one night Rudolph decides to look Buttsy up and cause him a
little pain in return and he is moseying through Fifty-third when
he gets so weak he falls down on the sidewalk in front of the old
house and rolls down a short flight of steps that lead from the
street level to a little railed-in area-way and ground floor or
basement door and before he stops rolling he brings up against the
door itself and it creaks open inward as he bumps it. After he lays
there awhile Rudolph can see that the house is empty and he crawls
on inside.</p>

<p>Then when he feels stronger, Rudolph makes his way upstairs
because the basement is damp and mice keep trotting back and forth
over him and eventually he finds up in the room where Johnny
One-Eye finds him the following afternoon and the reason Rudolph
settles down in this room is because it commands the stairs.
Naturally, this is important to a guy in Rudolph's situation,
though after he is sitting there for about fourteen hours before
Johnny comes along he can see that he is not going to be much
disturbed by traffic. But he considers it a very fine place,
indeed, to remain planted until he is able to resume his search for
Buttsy.</p>

<p>Well, after a while Johnny One-Eye wakes up and comes from under
the coat and looks at Rudolph out of his good eye and Rudolph
waggles his fingers and Johnny plays with them, catching one finger
in his front paws and biting it gently and this pleases Rudolph no
little as he never before has any personal experience with a
kitten. However, he remembers observing one when he is a boy down
in Houston Street, so he takes a piece of paper out of his pocket
and makes a little ball of it and rolls it along the floor and
Johnny bounces after it very lively indeed. But Rudolph can see
that the bad eye is getting worse and finally he says to Johnny
like this:</p>

<p>"Johnny," he says, "I guess you must be suffering more than I
am. I remember there are some pet shops over on Lexington Avenue
not far from here and when it gets good and dark I am going to take
you out and see if we can find a cat croaker to do something about
your eye. Yes, Johnny," Rudolph says, "I will also get you
something to eat. You must be starved."</p>

<p>Johnny One-Eye says merouw to this and keeps on playing with the
paper ball but soon it comes on dark outside and inside, too, and,
in fact, it is so dark inside that Rudolph cannot see his hand
before him. Then he puts his Betsy in a side pocket of his overcoat
and picks up Johnny and goes downstairs, feeling his way in the
dark and easing along a step at a time until he gets to the
basement door. Naturally, Rudolph does not wish to strike any
matches because he is afraid someone outside may see the light and
get nosey.</p>

<p>By moving very slowly, Rudolph finally gets to Lexington Avenue
and while he is going along he remembers the time he walks from
125th Street in Harlem down to 110th with six slugs in him and
never feels as bad as he does now. He gets to thinking that maybe
he is not the guy he used to be, which of course is very true as
Rudolph is now forty-odd years of age and is fat around the middle
and getting bald, and he also does some thinking about what a
pleasure it will be to him to find this Buttsy and cause him the
pain he is personally suffering.</p>

<p>There are not many people in the streets and those that are go
hurrying along because it is so cold and none of them pay any
attention to Rudolph or Johnny One-Eye either, even though Rudolph
staggers a little now and then like a guy who is rummed up,
although of course it is only weakness. The chances are he is also
getting a little feverish and lightheaded because finally he stops
a cop who is going along swinging his arms to keep warm and asks
him if he knows where there is a pet shop and it is really most
indiscreet of such a guy as Rudolph to be interviewing cops. But
the cop just points up the street and goes on without looking twice
at Rudolph and Rudolph laughs and pokes Johnny with a finger and
says:</p>

<p>"No, Johnny One-Eye," he says, "the cop is not a dope for not
recognizing Rudolph. Who can figure the hottest guy in forty-eight
states to be going along a street with a little cat in his arms?
Can you, Johnny?"</p>

<p>Johnny says merouw and pretty soon Rudolph comes to the pet shop
the cop points out, Rudolph goes inside and says to the guy like
this:</p>

<p>"Are you a cat croaker?" Rudolph says. "Do you know what to do
about a little cat that has a hurt eye?"</p>

<p>"I am a kind of a vet," the guy says.</p>

<p>"Then take a glaum at Johnny One-Eye here and see what you can
do for him," Rudolph says.</p>

<p>Then he hands Johnny over to the guy and the guy looks at Johnny
a while and says:</p>

<p>"Mister," he says, "the best thing I can do for this cat is to
put it out of its misery, You better let me give it something right
now. It will just go to sleep and never know what happens."</p>

<p>Well, at this, Rudolph grabs Johnny One-Eye out of the guy's
hands and puts him under his coat and drops a duke on the Betsy in
his pocket as if he is afraid the guy will take Johnny away from
him again and he says to the guy like this:</p>

<p>"No, no, no," Rudolph says. "I cannot bear to think of such a
thing. What about some kind of an operation? I remember they take a
bum lamp out of Joe the Goat at Bellevue one time and he is okay
now."</p>

<p>"Nothing will do your cat any good," the guy says. "It is a
goner. It will start having fits pretty soon and die sure. What is
the idea of trying to save such a cat as this? It is no kind of a
cat to begin with. It is just a cat. You can get a million like it
for a nickel."</p>

<p>"No," Rudolph says, "this is not just a cat. This is Johnny
One-Eye. He is my only friend in the world. He is the only living
thing that ever comes pushing up against me warm and friendly and
trust me in my whole life. I feel sorry for him."</p>

<p>"I feel sorry for him, too," the guy says. "I always feel sorry
for animals that get hurt and for people."</p>

<p>"I do not feel sorry for people," Rudolph says. "I only feel
sorry for Johnny One-Eye. Give me some kind of stuff that Johnny
will eat."</p>

<p>"Your cat wants milk," the guy says. "You can get some at the
delicatessen store down at the corner. Mister," he says, "you look
sick yourself. Can I do anything for you?"</p>

<p>But Rudolph only shakes his head and goes on out and down to the
delicatessen joint where he buys a bottle of milk and this
transaction reminds him that he is very short in the moo
department. In fact, he can find only a five-dollar note in his
pockets and he remembers that he has no way of getting any more
when this runs out, which is a very sad predicament indeed for a
guy who is accustomed to plenty of moo at all times.</p>

<p>Then Rudolph returns to the old house and sits down on the floor
again and gives Johnny One-Eye some of the milk in his derby hat as
he neglects buying something for Johnny to drink out of. But Johnny
offers no complaint. He laps up the milk and curls himself into a
wad in Rudolph's lap and purrs.</p>

<p>Rudolph takes a swig of the milk himself but it makes him sick
for by this time Rudolph is really far from being in the pink of
condition. He not only has the pain in his side but he has a heavy
cold which he probably catches from lying on the basement floor or
maybe sleeping in the park and he is wheezing no little. He
commences to worry that he may get too ill to continue looking for
Buttsy, as he can see that if it is not for Buttsy he will not be
in this situation, suffering the way he is, but on a long journey
to someplace.</p>

<p>He takes to going off into long stretches of a kind of stupor
and every time he comes out of one of these stupors the first thing
he does is to look around for Johnny One-Eye and Johnny is always
right there either playing with the paper ball or purring in
Rudolph's lap. He is a great comfort to Rudolph but after a while
Rudolph notices that Johnny seems to be running out of zip and he
also notices that he is running out of zip himself especially when
he discovers that he is no longer able to get to his feet.</p>

<p>It is along in the late afternoon of the day following the night
Rudolph goes out of the house that he hears someone coming up the
stairs and naturally he picks up his Betsy and gets ready for
action when he also hears a very small voice calling kitty, kitty,
kitty, and he realizes that the party that is coming can be nobody
but a child. In fact, a minute later a little pretty of maybe six
years of age comes into the room all out of breath and says to
Rudolph like this:</p>

<p>"How do you do?" she says. "Have you seen my kitty?"</p>

<p>Then she spots Johnny One-Eye in Rudolph's lap and runs over and
sits down beside Rudolph and takes Johnny in her arms and at first
Rudolph is inclined to resent this and has a notion to give her a
good boffing but he is too weak to exert himself in such a
manner.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Rudolph says to the little pretty, "and," he
says, "where do you live and how do you get in this house?"</p>

<p>"Why," she says, "I am Elsie, and I live down the street and I
am looking everywhere for my kitty for three days and the door is
open downstairs and I know kitty likes to go in doors that are open
so I came to find her and here she is."</p>

<p>"I guess I forgot to close it last night," Rudolph says. "I seem
to be very forgetful lately."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" Elsie asks, "and why are you sitting on the
floor in the cold and where are all your chairs? Do you have any
little girls like me and do you love them dearly?"</p>

<p>"No," Rudolph says. "By no means and not at all."</p>

<p>"Well," Elsie says, "I think you are a nice man for taking care
of my kitty. Do you love kitty?"</p>

<p>"Look," Rudolph says, "his name is not kitty. His name is Johnny
One-Eye, because he has only one eye."</p>

<p>"I call her kitty," Elsie says. "But," she says, "Johnny One-Eye
is a nice name too and if you like it best I will call her Johnny,
and I will leave her here with you to take care of always and I
will come to see her every day. You see," she says, "if I take
Johnny home Buttsy will only kick her again."</p>

<p>"Buttsy!" Rudolph says. "Do I hear you say Buttsy? Is his other
name Fagan?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Elsie says. "Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"No," Rudolph says, "but I hear of him. What is he to you?"</p>

<p>"He is my new daddy," Elsie says. "My other one and my best one
is dead and so my mamma makes Buttsy my new one. My mamma says
Buttsy is her mistake. He is very mean. He kicks Johnny and hurts
her eye and makes her run away. He kicks my mamma too. Buttsy kicks
everybody and everything when he is mad and he is always mad."</p>

<p>"He is a louse to kick a little cat," Rudolph says.</p>

<p>"Yes," Elsie says, "that is what Mr. O'Toole says he is for
kicking my mamma but my mamma says it is not a nice word and I am
never to say it out loud."</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. O'Toole?" Rudolph says.</p>

<p>"He is the policeman," Elsie says. "He lives across the street
from us and he is very nice to me. He says Buttsy is the word you
say just now, not only for kicking my mamma but for taking her
money when she brings it home from work and spending it so she
cannot buy me nice things to wear. But do you know what?" Elsie
says. "My mamma says some day Buttsy is going far away and then she
will buy me lots of things and send me to school and make me a
lady."</p>

<p>Then Elsie begins skipping around the room with Johnny One-Eye
in her arms and singing I am going to be a lady, I am going to be a
lady, until Rudolph has to tell her to pipe down because he is
afraid somebody may hear her. And all the time Rudolph is thinking
of Buttsy and regretting that he is unable to get on his pins and
go out of the house.</p>

<p>"Now I must go home," Elsie says, "because this is a night
Buttsy comes in for his supper and I have to be in bed before he
gets there so I will not bother him. Buttsy does not like little
girls. Buttsy does not like little kittens, Buttsy does not like
little anythings. My mamma is afraid of Buttsy and so am I. But,"
she says, "I will leave Johnny here with you and come back
to-morrow to see her."</p>

<p>"Listen, Elsie," Rudolph says, "does Mr. O'Toole come home
to-night to his house for his supper, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Elsie says. "He comes home every night. Sometimes
when there is a night Buttsy is not coming in for his supper my
mamma lets me go over to Mr. O'Toole's and I play with his dog
Charley but you must never tell Buttsy this because he does not
like O'Toole either. But this is a night Buttsy is coming and that
is why my mamma tells me to get in early."</p>

<p>Now Rudolph takes an old letter out of his inside pocket and a
pencil out of another pocket and he scribbles a few lines on the
envelope and stretches himself out on the floor and begins
groaning, oh, oh, oh, and then he says to Elsie like this:</p>

<p>"Look, Elsie," he says, "you are a smart little kid and you pay
strict attention to what I am going to say to you. Do not go to bed
to-night until Buttsy gets in. Then," Rudolph says, "you tell him
you come in this old house looking for your cat and that you hear
somebody groaning like I do just now in the room at the head of the
stairs and that you find a guy who says his name is Rudolph lying
on the floor so sick he cannot move. Tell him the front door of the
basement is open. But," Rudolph says, "you must not tell him that
Rudolph tells you to say these things. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Elsie says, "do you want him to come here? He will kick
Johnny again if he does."</p>

<p>"He will come here, but he will not kick Johnny," Rudolph says.
"He will come here, or I am the worst guesser in the world. Tell
him what I look like, Elsie. Maybe he will ask you if you see a
gun. Tell him you do not see one. You do not see a gun, do you,
Elsie?"</p>

<p>"No," Elsie says, "only the one in your hand when I come in but
you put it under your coat. Buttsy has a gun and Mr. O'Toole has a
gun but Buttsy says I am never, never to tell anybody about this or
he will kick me the way he does my mamma."</p>

<p>"Well," Rudolph says, "you must not remember seeing mine,
either. It is a secret between you and me and Johnny One-Eye. Now,"
he says, "if Buttsy leaves the house to come and see me, as I am
pretty sure he will, you run over to Mr. O'Toole's house and give
him this note, but do not tell Buttsy or your mamma either about
the note. If Buttsy does not leave, it is my hard luck, but you
give the note to Mr. O'Toole anyway. Now tell me what you are to
do, Elsie," Rudolph says, "so I can see if you have got everything
correct."</p>

<p>"I am to go on home and wait for Buttsy," she says, "and I am to
tell him Rudolph is lying on the floor of this dirty old house with
a fat stomach and a big nose making noises and that he is very sick
and the basement door is open and there is no gun if he asks me,
and when Buttsy comes to see you I am to take this note to Mr.
O'Toole but Buttsy and my mamma are not to know I have the note and
if Buttsy does not leave I am to give it to Mr. O'Toole anyway and
you are to stay here and take care of Johnny my kitten."</p>

<p>"That is swell," Rudolph says. "Now you run along."</p>

<p>So Elsie leaves and Rudolph sits up again against the wall
because his side feels easier this way and Johnny One-Eye is in his
lap purring very low and the dark comes on until it is blacker
inside the room than in the middle of a tunnel and Rudolph feels
that he is going into another stupor and he has a tough time
fighting it off.</p>

<p>Afterwards some of the neighbours claim they remember hearing a
shot inside the house and then two more in quick succession and
then all is quiet until a little later when Officer O'Toole and
half a dozen other cops and an ambulance with a doctor come busting
into the street and swarm into the joint with their guns out and
their flashlights going. The first thing they find is Buttsy at the
foot of the stairs with two bullet wounds close together in his
throat, and naturally he is real dead.</p>

<p>Rudolph is still sitting against the wall with what seems to be
a small bundle of bloody fur in his lap but which turns out to be
what is left of this little cat I am telling you about, although
nobody pays any attention to it at first. They are more interested
in getting the come-alongs on Rudolph's wrists but before they move
him he pulls his clothes aside and shows the doctor where the slug
is in his side and the doctor takes one glaum and shakes his head
and says:</p>

<p>"Gangrene," he says. "I think you have pneumonia, too, from the
way you are blowing."</p>

<p>"I know," Rudolph says. "I know this morning. Not much chance,
hey, croaker?"</p>

<p>"Not much," the doctor says.</p>

<p>"Well, cops," Rudolph says, "load me in. I do not suppose you
want Johnny, seeing that he is dead."</p>

<p>"Johnny who?" one of the cops says.</p>

<p>"Johnny One-Eye," Rudolph says. "This little cat here in my lap.
Buttsy shoots Johnny's only good eye out and takes most of his
noodle with it. I never see a more wonderful shot. Well, Johnny is
better off but I feel sorry about him as he is my best friend down
to the last."</p>

<p>Then he begins to laugh and the cop asks him what tickles him so
much and Rudolph says:</p>

<p>"Oh," he says, "I am thinking of the joke on Buttsy. I am
positive he will come looking for me, all right, not only because
of the little altercation between Cute Freddy and me but because
the chances are Buttsy is greatly embarrassed by not tilting me
over the first time, as of course he never knows he wings me.
Furthermore," Rudolph says, "and this is the best reason of all,
Buttsy will realize that if I am in his neighbourhood it is by no
means a good sign for him, even if he hears I am sick.</p>

<p>"Well," Rudolph says, "I figure that with any kind of a square
rattle I will have a better chance of nailing him than he has of
nailing me, but that even if he happens to nail me, O'Toole will
get my note in time to arrive here and nab Buttsy on the spot with
his gun on him. And," Rudolph says, "I know it will be a great
pleasure to the D.A. to settle Buttsy for having a gun on him.</p>

<p>"But," Rudolph says, "as soon as I hear Buttsy coming on the
sneaksby up the stairs, I can see I am taking all the worst of it
because I am now wheezing like a busted valve and you can hear me a
block away except when I hold my breath, which is very difficult
indeed, considering the way I am already greatly tuckered out. No,"
Rudolph says, "it does not look any too good for me as Buttsy keeps
coming up the stairs, as I can tell he is doing by a little faint
creak in the boards now and then. I am in no shape to manoeuvre
around the room and pretty soon he will be on the landing and then
all he will have to do is to wait there until he hears me which he
is bound to do unless I stop breathing altogether. Naturally,"
Rudolph says, "I do not care to risk a blast in the dark without
knowing where he is as something tells me Buttsy is not a guy you
can miss in safety.</p>

<p>"Well," Rudolph says, "I notice several times before this that
in the dark Johnny One-Eye's good glim shines like a big spark, so
when I feel Buttsy is about to hit the landing, although of course
I cannot see him, I flip Johnny's ball of paper across the room to
the wall just opposite the door and tough as he must be feeling
Johnny chases after it when he hears it light. I figure Buttsy will
hear Johnny playing with the paper and see his eye shining and
think it is me and take a pop at it and that his gun flash will
give me a crack at him.</p>

<p>"It all works out just like I dope it," Rudolph says, "but," he
says, "I never give Buttsy credit for being such a marksman as to
be able to hit a cat's eye in the dark. If I know this, maybe I
will never stick Johnny out in front the way I do. It is a good
thing I never give Buttsy a second shot. He is a lily. Yes,"
Rudolph says, "I can remember when I can use a guy like him."</p>

<p>"Buttsy is no account," the cop says. "He is a good riddance. He
is the makings of a worse guy than you."</p>

<p>"Well," Rudolph says, "it is a good lesson to him for kicking a
little cat."</p>

<p>Then they take Rudolph to a hospital and this is where I see him
and piece out this story of Johnny One-Eye, and Officer O'Toole is
at Rudolph's bedside keeping guard over him, and I remember that
not long before Rudolph chalks out he looks at O'Toole and says to
him like this:</p>

<p>"Copper," he says, "there is no chance of them out-juggling the
kid on the reward moo, is there?"</p>

<p>"No," O'Toole says, "no chance. I keep the note you send me by
Elsie saying she will tell me where you are. It is information
leading to your capture just as the reward offer states. Rudolph,"
he says, "it is a nice thing you do for Elsie and her mother,
although," he says, "it is not nearly as nice as icing Buttsy for
them."</p>

<p>"By the way, copper," Rudolph says, "there is the remainders of
a pound note in my pants pocket when I am brought here. I want you
to do me a favour. Get it from the desk and buy Elsie another cat
and name it Johnny, will you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," O'Toole says. "Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Rudolph says, "be sure it has two good eyes."</p>

<h2><a name="BROADWAY_INCIDENT" id="BROADWAY_INCIDENT">16. BROADWAY
INCIDENT</a>
</h2>

<p>ONE night Ambrose Hammer, the newspaper scribe, comes looking
for me on Broadway and he insists that I partake of dinner with him
at the Canary Club, stating that he wishes to talk to me.
Naturally, I know that Ambrose must be in love again, and when he
is in love he always wishes to have somebody around to listen to
him tell about how much he is in love and about the way he is
suffering, because Ambrose is such a guy as must have his suffering
with his love. I know him when he first shows up on Broadway, which
is a matter of maybe eight or ten years ago, but in all this time I
seldom see him when he is not in love and suffering and especially
suffering, and the reason he suffers is because he generally falls
in love with some beautiful who does not care two snaps of her
fingers about him and sometimes not even one snap.</p>

<p>In fact, it is the consensus of opinion along Broadway that
Ambrose is always very careful to pick a beautiful who does not
care any snaps of her fingers whatever about him because if he
finds one who does care these snaps there will be no reason for him
to suffer. Personally, I consider Ambrose's love affairs a great
bore but as the Canary Club is a very high-class gaff where the
food department is really above par, I am pleased to go with
him.</p>

<p>So there we are sitting on a leather settee against the wall in
the Canary Club and I am juggling a big thick sirloin steak
smothered in onions while Ambrose is telling me how much he loves a
beautiful by the name of Hilda Hiffenbrower and how he is wishing
he can marry her and live happily ever afterwards, but he is unable
to complete this transaction because there is an ever-loving
husband by the name of Herbert in the background from whom Hilda is
separated but not divorced. And the way Ambrose tells it, Hilda
cannot get a divorce because Herbert is just naturally a stinker
and does not wish to see her happy with anybody else and will not
let her have same.</p>

<p>Well, I happen to know Hilda better than Ambrose does. To tell
the truth, I know her when her name is Mame something and she is
dealing them off her arm in a little eating gaff on Seventh Avenue,
which is before she goes in show business and changes her name to
Hilda, and I also know that the real reason Herbert will not give
her this divorce is because she wants eight gallons of his heart's
blood and both his legs in the divorce settlement, but as Herbert
has a good business head he is by no means agreeable to these
terms, though I hear he is willing to compromise on one leg to get
rid of Hilda.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I know that Hilda is never very sympathetic towards
marriage in any manner, shape or form, as she has a few other
husbands prior to this and dismisses them before they are in office
very long, and I am willing to bet that she has an ice-cream cone
where her heart is supposed to be. But of course I do not feel
disposed to mention this matter to Ambrose Hammer, especially while
I am enjoying his steak.</p>

<p>So I just go on eating and listening and Ambrose seems about
ready to burst into tears as he tells me about his suffering
because of his love for Hilda, when who comes into the Canary Club
all dressed up in white tie and tails but a guy by the name of
Brogan Wilmington, who is what is called a playwright by trade, a
playwright being a guy who writes plays which are put on the stage
for people to see.</p>

<p>As Ambrose is a dramatic critic, it is his duty to go and view
these plays and to tell the readers of the blat for which he works
what he thinks of them, and it seems that he tells them that the
play written by this Brogan Wilmington is a twenty-two-carat
smeller. In fact, it seems that Ambrose tells them it is without
doubt the worst case of dramatic halitosis in the history of
civilization and it is plain to be seen that Brogan Wilmington is
somewhat vexed as he approaches our table and addresses Ambrose as
follows:</p>

<p>"Ah," he says, "here you are."</p>

<p>"Yes," Ambrose says, "here I am, indeed."</p>

<p>"You do not care for my play?" Brogan Wilmington says.</p>

<p>"No," Ambrose says, "I loathe and despise it."</p>

<p>"Well," Brogan Wilmington says, "take this."</p>

<p>Then he lets go with his right and grazes Ambrose Hammer's chin
but in doing so, Brogan Wilmington's coat-tails swing out behind
him and across a portion of lobster Newburg that a beautiful at the
next table is enjoying and in fact the swinging coat-tails wipe
about half the portion off the plate on to the floor. Before Brogan
Wilmington can recover his balance, the beautiful picks up what is
left of her lobster Newburg, plate and all, and clops Brogan on the
pimple with it and knocks him plumb out on to the dance floor where
many parties, male and female, are doing the rumba with great
zest.</p>

<p>Naturally, Ambrose is slightly surprised at this incident, but
as he is a gentleman at all times, even if he is a dramatic critic,
he turns to the beautiful and says to her like this: "Miss,"
Ambrose says, "or madam, I am obliged to you. Waiter," he says,
"bring this lovely creature another dash of lobster Newburg and put
it on my check."</p>

<p>Then he resumes his conversation with me and thinks no more of
the matter, because of course it is by no means a novelty for
Ambrose Hammer to have playwrights throw punches at him, although
generally it is actors and sometimes producers. In the meantime,
the parties out on the dance floor find they cannot rumba with any
convenience unless Brogan Wilmington is removed from their space,
so a couple of waiters pick Brogan up and carry him away and
Ambrose notices that the beautiful who slugs Brogan with the
lobster Newburg now seems to be crying.</p>

<p>"Miss," Ambrose says, "or madam, dry your tears. Your fresh
portion of lobster Newburg will be along presently."</p>

<p>"Oh," she says, "I am not crying about the loss of my lobster
Newburg. I am crying because in my agitation I spill the little
bottle of cyanide of potassium I bring in here with me and now I
cannot commit suicide. Look at it all over my bag."</p>

<p>"Well," Ambrose says, "I am sorry, but I do not approve of
anybody committing suicide in the Canary Club. It is owned by a
friend of mine by the name of Joe Gloze and every Christmas he
sends me a dozen expensive ties, besides permitting me to free-load
here at will. A suicide in his club will be bad publicity for him.
It may get around that death ensues because of the cooking.
However, miss," Ambrose says, "or madam, if you are bound and
determined to commit this suicide you may walk around the corner to
a deadfall called El Parcheeso, which is Joe's rival, and I will
follow you and observe your action in all its sad details and it
will be a fine story for me."</p>

<p>Well, the beautiful seems to be thinking this proposition over
and Ambrose is so occupied watching her think that he loses the
thread of his story of his love for Hilda and seems to forget some
of his suffering, too, and finally the beautiful turns to him and
says:</p>

<p>"Sir, do you rumba?"</p>

<p>"Do I rumba?" Ambrose says. "Miss," he says, "or madam, you now
behold the best rumba dancer in the Western Hemisphere, bar Havana.
There is one guy there who can defeat me, although," Ambrose says,
"it is a photo finish. Let us put it on."</p>

<p>So they get out on the floor and rumba quite a while and after
that they samba some and then they conga and Ambrose can see that
the beautiful has a very liberal education, indeed, along these
lines. In fact, he can see that she rumbas and sambas and congas
much better than any married beautiful should, because between a
rumba and a samba she informs him that her name is Mrs. Brumby News
and that she is the ever-loving wife of a doctor by the same name
without the Mrs., who is much older than she is.</p>

<p>Finally they get all tuckered out from dancing and are sitting
at the table talking of this and that and one thing and another,
and I can tell from Mrs. News' conversation that she is far from
being as intellectual as Professor Einstein and to tell the truth
she does not seem right bright and Ambrose Hammer probably notices
the same thing, but when it comes to beautifuls, Ambrose does not
care if they are short fifteen letters reciting the alphabet. So he
is really enjoying his chat with her and presently he asks her why
she ever figures on knocking herself off and she relates a somewhat
surprising story.</p>

<p>She states that her husband is always too busy trying to find
out what is wrong with his patients to pay much attention to her
and as she has no children but only a chow dog by the name of Pepe
to occupy her time and as her maid can look after the dog better
than she can, she takes to visiting this same Canary Club and
similar traps seeking diversion.</p>

<p>She says that on one of these afternoons some months back she
meets a fat blonde by the name of Mrs. Bidkar and they become great
friends as they both like to gab and sip cocktails and sometimes
pick up rumbas with stray guys as beautifuls will do when they are
running around loose, although it seems from what Mrs. News says
that Mrs. Bidkar is by no means a beautiful but is really nothing
but a bundle and a little smooth on the tooth in the matter of age.
However, she is good company and Mrs. News says they find they have
much in common including the cocktails and the rumbas.</p>

<p>It seems they both also like to play bridge and Mrs. Bidkar
invites Mrs. News to her apartment, stating that she has several
friends in every so often to play this bridge. So Mrs. News goes to
the apartment, which is in East Fifty-seventh Street and very nice,
at that, and she discovers that the friends are all young and
married beautifuls like herself. There are three of them and one
has the name of Mrs. Smythe and another the name of Mrs. Brown, but
what the third one's name is Mrs. News says she does not remember
as it is a long name, and anyway this one does not seem as well
acquainted with Mrs. Bidkar as the others and does not have much to
say.</p>

<p>Anyway, from now on they all play bridge in Mrs. Bidkar's
apartment three or four afternoons a week and sip plenty of
cocktails in between hands and a pleasant time is had by one and
all, according to Mrs. News. Then one day after playing bridge they
are sitting around working on the cocktails and talking of
different matters, when it comes out that they are all unhappy in
their married lives. In fact, it comes out that they all hate their
husbands no little and wish to be shed of them and Mrs. News states
that the one who wishes this the most is Mrs. Bidkar.</p>

<p>Mrs. News says that Mrs. Bidkar declares she wishes her Olaf is
dead so she can collect his life insurance and lead her own life in
her own way, and then she starts asking the others if their
husbands carry such insurance and it seems they do and finally Mrs.
Bidkar says as if in a joke that it will be a good idea if they
dispose of their husbands and put the insurance moo in a common
pool. She says one may put more in the jackpot than another, but
since it will scarcely be possible for them to dispose of five
different husbands all at once the pool will give each a drawing
account after it starts until the whole deal is carried out.</p>

<p>Well, it seems from the way Mrs. News tells it that Mrs. Bidkar
keeps making quite a joke about the idea and the others join in,
especially as they keep pecking away at the cocktails, and after a
while it is a big laugh all the way around. Then Mrs. Bidkar
suggests that to make it more of a joke they deal out the cards to
see which is to be the first to dispose of her husband and the one
who draws the nine of diamonds is to be it, and Mrs. News gets the
nine.</p>

<p>So the party breaks up with everybody still laughing and joking
with Mrs. News over winning the prize and she is laughing, too, but
as she is leaving Mrs. Bidkar calls her back and hands her a little
vial which she states contains cyanide of potassium and whispers
that after Mrs. News thinks it over she will see that many a true
word is said in jest and that perhaps she will wish to use the
cyanide where it will do the most good. Then Mrs. News says before
she can say aye, yes, or no, Mrs. Bidkar pushes her out the door
and closes it, still laughing.</p>

<p>"So," Mrs. News says, "I come here to the Canary Club and I get
to thinking what a great sin I am guilty of in participating in
such a joke, even though my husband is really nothing but an old
curmudgeon and is related to Clarence Closeclutch when it comes to
money, and I become so remorseful that I decide to take the cyanide
myself when I am interrupted by the good-looking gentleman striking
you. By the way," she says, "do you know if he rumbas?"</p>

<p>Now this story seems rather interesting to me and I am expecting
Ambrose Hammer to become greatly excited by it, because it sounds
like a crime mystery and next to love Ambrose Hammer's greatest
hobby is crime mystery. He often vexes the cops quite some by
poking his nose into their investigations and trying to figure out
who does what. To tell the truth, Ambrose's interest is sometimes
so divided between love and crime that it is hard to tell whether
he wishes to be Clark Gable or Sherlock Holmes, though the chances
are he wishes to be both. But I can see that Ambrose is half asleep
and when Mrs. News concludes her tale he speaks to her quite
severely as follows:</p>

<p>"Madam," he says, "of course you are a victim of a gag.
However," he says, "you are such a swell rumba dancer I will
overlook your wasting my time with such a dreary recital. Let us
shake it up a little more on the dance floor and then I must return
to my office and write a Sunday article advising the sanitation
authorities to suppress Brogan Wilmington's play before it
contaminates the entire community. He is the guy you flatten with
your lobster Newburg. He is not good looking, either, and he cannot
rumba a lick. I forget to mention it before," Ambrose says, "but I
am Ambrose Hammer."</p>

<p>Mrs. News does not seem to know the name and this really cuts
Ambrose deeply, so he is not sorry to see her depart. Then he goes
to his office and I go home to bed and the chances are neither of
us will give the incident another thought if a guy by the name of
Dr. Brumby News does not happen to drop dead in the Canary Club one
night while in the act of committing the rumba with his wife.</p>

<p>Ambrose and I are sitting in Mindy's restaurant on Broadway when
he reads an item in an early edition of a morning blat about this,
and as Ambrose has a good memory for names he calls my attention to
the item and states that the wife in question is undoubtedly the
beautiful who tells us the unusual story.</p>

<p>"My goodness, Ambrose," I say, "do you suppose she gives the guy
the business after all?"</p>

<p>"No," Ambrose says, "such an idea is foolish. It says here he
undoubtedly dies of heart disease. He is sixty-three years old and
at his age the price is logically thirty to one that a doctor will
die of heart disease. Of course," Ambrose says, "if it is known
that a doctor of sixty-three is engaging in the rumba, the price is
one hundred to one."</p>

<p>"But Ambrose," I say, "maybe she knows the old guy's heart is
weak and gets him to rumba figuring that it will belt him out
quicker than cyanide."</p>

<p>"Well," Ambrose says, "it is a theory, of course, but I do not
think there is anything in it. I think maybe she feels so sorry for
her wicked thoughts about him that she tries to be nice to him and
gets him to go out stepping with her, but with no sinister motives
whatever. However, let us give this no further consideration.
Doctors die of heart disease every day. Do I tell you that I see
Hilda last night and that she believes she is nearer a settlement
with Hiffenbrower? She is breakfasting with him at his hotel almost
every morning and feels that he is softening up. Ah," Ambrose says,
"how I long for the hour I can take her in my arms and call her my
own dear little wife."</p>

<p>I am less interested in Hilda than ever at this moment, but I am
compelled to listen for two hours to Ambrose tell about his love
for her and about his suffering and I make up my mind to give him a
miss until he gets over this one. Then about a week later he sends
for me to come to his office saying he wishes me to go with him to
see a new play, and while I am there waiting for Ambrose to finish
some work, who comes in but Mrs. News. She is all in mourning and
as soon as she sees Ambrose she begins to cry and she says to him
like this:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Hammer," she says, "I do not kill my husband."</p>

<p>"Why," Ambrose says, "certainly not. By no means and not at all.
But," Ambrose says, "it is most injudicious of you to permit him to
rumba at his age."</p>

<p>"It is his own desire," Mrs. News says. "It is his method of
punishing me for being late for dinner a few times. He is the most
frightful rumba dancer that ever lives and he knows it is torture
to me to dance with a bad rumba dancer, so he takes me out and
rumbas me into a state approaching nervous exhaustion before he
keels over himself. Mr. Hammer, I do not like to speak ill of the
dead but my late husband really has a mean disposition. But," she
says, "I do not kill him."</p>

<p>"Nobody says you do," Ambrose says.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. News says, "somebody does. Do you remember me
telling you about drawing the cards at Mrs. Bidkar's apartment to
see who is to dispose of her husband first?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Ambrose says, "you mean the little joke they play on you?
Yes," he says, "I remember."</p>

<p>"Well," Mrs. News says, "Mrs. Bidkar now says it is never a joke
at all. She says it is all in earnest and claims I know it is all
the time. She is around to see me last night and says I undoubtedly
give my husband poison and that I must turn his insurance money
into the pool when I collect it. There is quite a lot of it. Over
two hundred thousand dollars, Mr. Hammer."</p>

<p>"Look," Ambrose says, "this is just another of Mrs. Bidkar's
little jokes. She seems to have quite a sense of humour."</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. News says, "it is no joke. She is very serious. She
says unless I turn in the money she will expose me to the world and
there will be a horrible scandal and I will go to gaol and not be
able to collect a cent of the insurance money. She just laughs when
I tell her I spill the cyanide she gives me and says if I do, I
probably get more poison somewhere else and use it and that she and
the others are entitled to their share of the money just the same
because she furnishes the idea. Mr. Hammer, you must remember
seeing me spill the cyanide."</p>

<p>"Mrs. N.," Ambrose says, "does anyone tell you yet that you make
a lovely widow? But no matter," he says. "Yes I remember hearing
you say you spill something but I do not look to see. Are you
positive you do not do as Mrs. Bidkar suggests and get some other
destructive substance and slip it to your husband by accident?"</p>

<p>Well, at this Mrs. News begins crying very loudly indeed, and
Ambrose has to spend some time soothing her and I wish to state
that when it comes to soothing a beautiful there are few better
soothers than Ambrose Hammer on the island of Manhattan. Then when
he gets her quieted down he says to her like this:</p>

<p>"Now," Ambrose says, "just leave everything to me. I am
commencing to sniff something here. But," he says, "in the meantime
remain friendly with Mrs. Bidkar. Let her think you are commencing
to see things her own way. Maybe she will hold another
drawing."</p>

<p>"Oh," Mrs. News says, "she has. She tells me the one whose name
I cannot remember draws the nine of diamonds only the day before my
husband departs this life. It is a long name with a kind of a
foreign sound. Mrs. Bidkar says she has a lot of confidence in this
one just on her looks although she does not know her intimately. I
only wish I can think of the name. I have a dreadful time thinking
of names. I remember yours when I happen to see it over an article
in the paper the other day about Brogan Wilmington's play and then
I remember, too, that you mention that he is the good-looking
gentleman in the Canary Club the night we meet. Mr. Hammer," she
says, "you say some very mean things about his play."</p>

<p>"Well," Ambrose says, "I do not know about the propriety of a
beautiful in widow's weeds attending the theatre, but I happen to
have a couple of skulls to Wilmington's play right here in my desk
and I will give them to you and you can go and see for yourself
that it really is most distressing. Probably you will see
Wilmington himself standing in the lobby taking bows for no reason
whatever, and I hope and trust you take another close glaum at him
and you will see that he is not good looking. And," Ambrose says,
"I tell you once more he is a total bust at the rumba."</p>

<p>"Why," Mrs. News says, "I will be delighted to see his play. It
may help break the monotony of being a widow, which is quite
monotonous to be sure, even after a very short time. I almost miss
poor Brummy in spite of his narrow views on punctuality for dinner,
but please do something about Mrs. Bidkar."</p>

<p>Then she leaves us, and Ambrose and I gaze at the new play which
seems to me to be all right but which Ambrose says is a great
insult to the theatre because Ambrose is very hard to please about
plays, and it is some days before I see him again. Naturally, I ask
him if he does anything about Mrs. News' case and Ambrose says:</p>

<p>"Yes," he says, "I prod around in it to some extent and I find
it is an attempt at blackmail, just as I suspect. It is a most
ingenious set-up, at that. I look up Mrs. Smythe and Mrs. Brown and
one is a chorus gorgeous by the name of Beerbaum and the other is a
clerk in a Broadway lingerie shop by the name of Cooney. Neither of
them is ever married as far as anybody knows. Mrs. Bidkar is
originally out of Chicago and has a husband, but," Ambrose says,
"nobody seems to know who he is or where he is."</p>

<p>"But Ambrose," I say, "how can Mrs. Smythe and Mrs. Brown enter
into a deal to dispose of their husbands as Mrs. News states when
they have no husbands? Is this entirely honest?"</p>

<p>"Why," Ambrose says, "they are stooges. You see," he says, "Mrs.
Bidkar has a little moo and she rents this apartment and uses these
two as trimming. Her idea is to pick up dumb beautifuls such as
Mrs. News who are not too happy with their husbands and get them
wedged in on such a situation as develops here, and the other two
help out."</p>

<p>"Ambrose," I say, "do you mean to tell me this Mrs. Bidkar is so
heartless as to plan to have these beautifuls she picks up chill
their husbands?"</p>

<p>"No," Ambrose says. "This is not her plan at all. She has no
idea they will actually do such a thing. But she does figure to
manoeuvre them into entering into the spirit of what she calls a
joke just as she does Mrs. News, the cocktails helping out no
little. It all sounds very harmless to the married beautiful until
Mrs. Bidkar comes around afterwards and threatens to tell the
husband that his wife is a party to a scheme of this nature.
Naturally," Ambrose says, "such a wife is very eager to settle with
Mrs. Bidkar for whatever she can dig up."</p>

<p>"Why, Ambrose," I say, "it is nothing but a shakedown, which is
very old-fashioned stuff."</p>

<p>"Yes," Ambrose says, "it is a shake, all right. And," he says,
"it makes me very sad to learn from Mrs. Smythe and Mrs. Brown, who
work with Mrs. Bidkar in other cities, that many husbands must be
willing to believe anything of their ever-lovings, even murder, and
that the wives know it, because they always settle promptly with
Mrs. Bidkar. She is a smart old broad. It is a pity she is so
nefarious. Mrs. Smythe and Mrs. Brown are very grateful when they
find I am not going to put them in gaol," Ambrose says. "I have
their phone numbers."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "now there is nothing left to be done but to clap
this Mrs. Bidkar in the pokey and inform Mrs. News that she can
quit worrying. Why, goodness gracious, Ambrose," I say, "Mrs.
Bidkar is really a great menace to be at large in a community. She
ought to be filed away for life."</p>

<p>"Yes," Ambrose says, "what you say is quite true, but if we put
her in gaol it will all come out in the blats and Mrs. News cannot
afford such notoriety. It may bother her in collecting her
insurance. Let us go and see Mrs. Bidkar and explain to her that
the best thing she can do is to hit the grit out of town."</p>

<p>So we get in a taxi-cab and go to an address in East
Fifty-seventh Street that turns out to be a high-toned apartment
house, and Ambrose stakes the elevator guy to a deuce and the guy
takes us up to the sixth floor without going to the trouble of
announcing us on the house phone first and points to a door. Then
Ambrose pushes the buzzer and presently a female character appears
and gazes at us in a most hospitable manner.</p>

<p>She is short and is wearing a negligée that permits her to widen
out freely all the way around and she has straw-coloured hair and a
large smile and while she is by no means a beautiful, still you
cannot say she is a crow. In fact, I am somewhat surprised when
Ambrose asks her if she is Mrs. Bidkar and she states that she is,
as I am expecting a genuine old komoppo. We enter an elegantly
furnished living-room and she asks our business, and Ambrose
says:</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. B.," he says, "you almost get a good break when old
Doc News drops dead after you stake his wife to the poison because
it looks as if you have her where she can never wiggle off no
matter what she says. But," Ambrose says, "my friend Mrs. News is
cute enough to seek my advice and counsel."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Mrs. Bidkar says. "And who are you?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," Ambrose says. "I am here to tell you that if you
are present in these parts to-morrow morning you will find yourself
in the canneroo."</p>

<p>At this, Mrs. Bidkar stops smiling and a very hard look indeed
comes into her eyes and she says:</p>

<p>"Listen, guy, whoever you are," she says. "If you are a friend
of Mrs. News you will tell her to get it on the line at once and
save herself trouble. I may go to gaol," she says, "but so will she
and I can stand it better than she can because I am there before,
and anyway the charge against me will not be poisoning my
husband."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bidkar," Ambrose says, "you know Mrs. News does not poison
her husband."</p>

<p>"No?" Mrs. Bidkar says. "Who does, then? They cannot pin it on
me because Mrs. News herself claims she spills the stuff I give her
and which she thinks is cyanide but which is really nothing but
water, so she must get something else to do the job. Her own
statement lets me out. But if you take her story that she does not
poison him at all, you must be dumber than she is, although," Mrs.
Bidkar says, "I will never believe such a thing is possible."</p>

<p>"Water, hey?" Ambrose says. "Well, Mrs. Bidkar," he says, "I can
see that you really believe Mrs. News is guilty of this poisoning,
so I will have to show you something I have here," he says, "a
little document from the medical examiner stating that an autopsy
on the remains of the late Dr. Brumby News discloses no sign of
poison whatever. You can confirm this by calling up the district
attorney, who has the autopsy performed and who is still very angry
at me for putting him to a lot of bother for nothing," Ambrose
says.</p>

<p>"An autopsy?" Mrs. Bidkar says, taking the paper and reading it.
"I see. To-morrow morning, do you say? Well," she says, "you need
not mind looking in again as I will be absent. Good day," she
says.</p>

<p>Then Ambrose and I take our departure and when we are going
along the street I suddenly think of something and I say to him
like this:</p>

<p>"An autopsy, Ambrose?" I say. "Why, such an action indicates
that you never entirely believe Mrs. News yourself, does it
not?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Ambrose says, "I believe her, all right, but I always
consider it a sound policy to look a little bit behind a
beautiful's word on any proposition. Besides, cyanide has an odour
and I do not remember noticing such an odour in the Canary Club and
this makes me wonder somewhat about Mrs. News when I begin looking
the situation over. But," Ambrose says, "of course Mrs. Bidkar
clears this point up. Do you know what I am wondering right this
minute? I am wondering what ever happens to Mrs. Bidkar's husband,"
he says.</p>

<p>Well, personally I do not consider this a matter worth thinking
about, so I leave Ambrose at a corner and I do not see him again
for weeks when we get together in the Canary Club for another
dinner, and while we are sitting there who comes past our table
without her mourning and looking very gorgeous indeed but Mrs.
Brumby News.</p>

<p>When she sees Ambrose she stops and gives him a large good
evening and Ambrose invites her to sit down and she does same but
she states that she is on a meet with a friend and cannot remain
with us long. She sits there chatting with Ambrose about this and
that and he is so attentive that it reminds me of something and I
say to him like this:</p>

<p>"Ambrose," I say, "I understand the course of your true love
with Hilda may soon be smoothed out. I hear Hiffenbrower is in a
hospital and may not be with us much longer. Well," I say, "let me
be the first to congratulate you."</p>

<p>Yow Mrs. News looks up and says:</p>

<p>"Hilda?" she says. "Hiffenbrower?" she says, "Why, this is the
name of the other girl at Mrs. Bidkar's I am never able to
remember. Yes, Hilda Hiffenbrower."</p>

<p>Naturally, I am greatly surprised and I gaze at Ambrose and he
nods and says:</p>

<p>"Yes," he says, "I know it from the day I begin my
investigation, but," he says, "I am too greatly shocked and pained
to mention the matter. She becomes acquainted with Mrs. Bidkar the
same way Mrs. News does. Hilda is always quick to learn and
personally I feel that Hiffenbrower makes a mistake in not
cancelling her out as the beneficiary of his insurance when they
first separate. It is unfair to place great temptation before any
beautiful and," Ambrose says, "especially Hilda.</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "Hiffenbrower is suffering from prolonged doses
of powdered glass in his cereal but you are wrong about his
condition. They are laying even money he beats it, although of
course his digestion may be slightly impaired. I hear the cops
trace Hilda to South America. Oh, well," Ambrose says, "I am
through with the beautifuls for ever. Mrs. N., do you care to push
a rumba around with me?"</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. News says, "here comes my friend. I think you meet
him before. In fact," she says, "you are responsible for us getting
together by sending me to the theatre on the free tickets that
night."</p>

<p>And who is the friend but this Brogan Wilmington, the
playwright, whose play is now running along quite successfully and
making plenty of beesom in spite of what Ambrose states about it,
and as Mrs. News gets up from the table to join him, Brogan
Wilmington gazes at Ambrose and says to him like this:</p>

<p>"Bah," Brogan Wilmington says.</p>

<p>"Bah right back to you," Ambrose says, and then he begins going
through his pockets looking for something.</p>

<p>"Now where do I put those phone numbers of Mrs. Smythe and Mrs.
Brown?" Ambrose says.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="THE_IDYLL_OF_MISS_SARAH_BROWN" id=
"THE_IDYLL_OF_MISS_SARAH_BROWN">17. THE IDYLL OF MISS SARAH
BROWN</a>
</h2>

<p>OF all the high players this country ever sees, there is no
doubt but that the guy they call The Sky is the highest. In fact,
the reason he is called The Sky is because he goes so high when it
comes to betting on any proposition whatever. He will bet all he
has, and nobody can bet any more than this.</p>

<p>His right name is Obadiah Masterson, and he is originally out of
a little town in southern Colorado where he learns to shoot craps,
and play cards, and one thing and another, and where his old man is
a very well-known citizen, and something of a sport himself. In
fact, The Sky tells me that when he finally cleans up all the loose
scratch around his home town and decides he needs more room, his
old man has a little private talk with him and says to him like
this:</p>

<p>"Son," the old guy says, "you are now going out into the wide,
wide world to make your own way, and it is a very good thing to do,
as there are no more opportunities for you in this burg. I am only
sorry," he says, "that I am not able to bank-roll you to a very
large start, but," he says, "not having any potatoes to give you, I
am now going to stake you to some very valuable advice, which I
personally collect in my years of experience around and about, and
I hope and trust you will always bear this advice in mind.</p>

<p>"Son," the old guy says, "no matter how far you travel, or how
smart you get, always remember this: some day, somewhere," he says,
"a guy is going to come to you and show you a nice brand-new deck
of cards on which the seal is never broken, and this guy is going
to offer to bet you that the jack of spades will jump out of this
deck and squirt cider in your ear. But, son," the old guy says, "do
not bet him, for as sure as you do you are going to get an ear full
of cider."</p>

<p>Well, The Sky remembers what his old man says, and he is always
very cautious about betting on such propositions as the jack of
spades jumping out of a sealed deck of cards and squirting cider in
his ear, and so he makes few mistakes as he goes along. In fact,
the only real mistake The Sky makes is when he hits St. Louis after
leaving his old home town, and loses all his potatoes betting a guy
St. Louis is the biggest town in the world.</p>

<p>Now of course this is before The Sky ever sees any bigger towns,
and he is never much of a hand for reading up on matters such as
this. In fact, the only reading The Sky ever does as he goes along
through life is in these Gideon Bibles such as he finds in the
hotel rooms where he lives, for The Sky never lives anywhere else
but in hotel rooms for years.</p>

<p>He tells me that he reads many items of great interest in these
Gideon Bibles, and furthermore The Sky says that several times
these Gideon Bibles keep him from getting out of line, such as the
time he finds himself pretty much frozen-in over in Cincinnati,
what with owing everybody in town except maybe the mayor from
playing games of chance of one kind and another.</p>

<p>Well, The Sky says he sees no way of meeting these obligations
and he is figuring the only thing he can do is to take a run-out
powder, when he happens to read in one of these Gideon Bibles where
it says like this:</p>

<p>"Better is it," the Gideon Bible says, "that thou shouldest not
vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay."</p>

<p>Well, The Sky says he can see that there is no doubt whatever
but that this means a guy shall not welsh, so he remains in
Cincinnati until he manages to wiggle himself out of the situation,
and from that day to this, The Sky never thinks of welshing.</p>

<p>He is maybe thirty years old, and is a tall guy with a round
kisser, and big blue eyes, and he always looks as innocent as a
little baby. But The Sky is by no means as innocent as he looks. In
fact, The Sky is smarter than three Philadelphia lawyers, which
makes him very smart, indeed, and he is well established as a high
player in New Orleans, and Chicago, and Los Angeles, and wherever
else there is any action in the way of card-playing, or
crap-shooting, or horse-racing, or betting on the baseball games,
for The Sky is always moving around the country following the
action.</p>

<p>But while The Sky will bet on anything whatever, he is more of a
short-card player and a crap-shooter than anything else, and
furthermore he is a great hand for propositions, such as are always
coming up among citizens who follow games of chance for a living.
Many citizens prefer betting on propositions to anything you can
think of, because they figure a proposition gives them a chance to
out-smart somebody, and in fact I know citizens who will sit up all
night making up propositions to offer other citizens the next
day.</p>

<p>A proposition may be only a problem in cards, such as what is
the price against a guy getting aces back-to-back, or how often a
pair of deuces will win a hand in stud, and then again it may be
some very daffy proposition, indeed, although the daffier any
proposition seems to be, the more some citizens like it. And no one
ever sees The Sky when he does not have some proposition of his
own.</p>

<p>The first time he ever shows up around this town, he goes to a
baseball game at the Polo Grounds with several prominent citizens,
and while he is at the ball game, he buys himself a sack of Harry
Stevens' peanuts, which he dumps in a side pocket of his coat. He
is eating these peanuts all through the game, and after the game is
over and he is walking across the field with the citizens, he says
to them like this:</p>

<p>"What price," The Sky says, "I cannot throw a peanut from second
base to the home plate?"</p>

<p>Well, everybody knows that a peanut is too light for anybody to
throw it this far, so Big Nig, the crap shooter, who always likes
to have a little the best of it running for him, speaks as
follows:</p>

<p>"You can have 3 to 1 from me, stranger," Big Nig says.</p>

<p>"Two C's against six," The Sky says, and then he stands on
second base, and takes a peanut out of his pocket, and not only
whips it to the home plate, but on into the lap of a fat guy who is
still sitting in the grand stand putting the zing on Bill Terry for
not taking Walker out of the box when Walker is getting a pasting
from the other club.</p>

<p>Well, naturally, this is a most astonishing throw, indeed, but
afterwards it comes out that The Sky throws a peanut loaded with
lead, and of course it is not one of Harry Stevens' peanuts,
either, as Harry is not selling peanuts full of lead at a dime a
bag, with the price of lead what it is.</p>

<p>It is only a few nights after this that The Sky states another
most unusual proposition to a group of citizens sitting in Mindy's
restaurant when he offers to bet a C note that he can go down into
Mindy's cellar and catch a live rat with his bare hands and
everybody is greatly astonished when Mindy himself steps up and
takes the bet, for ordinarily Mindy will not bet you a nickel he is
alive.</p>

<p>But it seems that Mindy knows that The Sky plants a tame rat in
the cellar, and this rat knows The Sky and loves him dearly, and
will let him catch it any time he wishes, and it also seems that
Mindy knows that one of his dish washers happens upon this rat, and
not knowing it is tame, knocks it flatter than a pancake. So when
The Sky goes down into the cellar and starts trying to catch a rat
with his bare hands he is greatly surprised how inhospitable the
rat turns out to be, because it is one of Mindy's personal rats,
and Mindy is around afterwards saying he will lay plenty of 7 to 5
against even Strangler Lewis being able to catch one of his rats
with his bare hands, or with boxing gloves on.</p>

<p>I am only telling you all this to show you what a smart guy The
Sky is, and I am only sorry I do not have time to tell you about
many other very remarkable propositions that he thinks up outside
of his regular business.</p>

<p>It is well-known to one and all that he is very honest in every
respect, and that he hates and despises cheaters at cards, or dice,
and furthermore The Sky never wishes to play with any the best of
it himself, or anyway not much. He will never take the inside of
any situation, as many gamblers love to do, such as owning a
gambling house, and having the percentage run for him instead of
against him, for always The Sky is strictly a player, because he
says he will never care to settle down in one spot long enough to
become the owner of anything.</p>

<p>In fact, in all the years The Sky is drifting around the
country, nobody ever knows him to own anything except maybe a bank
roll, and when he comes to Broadway the last time, which is the
time I am now speaking of, he has a hundred G's in cash money, and
an extra suit of clothes, and this is all he has in the world. He
never owns such a thing as a house, or an automobile, or a piece of
jewellery. He never owns a watch, because The Sky says time means
nothing to him.</p>

<p>Of course some guys will figure a hundred G's comes under the
head of owning something, but as far as The Sky is concerned, money
is nothing but just something for him to play with and the dollars
may as well be doughnuts as far as value goes with him. The only
time The Sky ever thinks of money as money is when he is broke, and
the only way he can tell he is broke is when he reaches into his
pocket and finds nothing there but his fingers.</p>

<p>Then it is necessary for The Sky to go out and dig up some fresh
scratch somewhere, and when it comes to digging up scratch, The Sky
is practically supernatural. He can get more potatoes on the
strength of a telegram to some place or other than John D.
Rockefeller can get on collateral, for everybody knows The Sky's
word is as good as wheat in the bin.</p>

<p>Now one Sunday evening The Sky is walking along Broadway, and at
the corner of forty-ninth Street he comes upon a little bunch of
mission workers who are holding a religious meeting, such as
mission workers love to do of a Sunday evening, the idea being that
they may round up a few sinners here and there, although personally
I always claim the mission workers come out too early to catch any
sinners on this part of Broadway. At such an hour the sinners are
still in bed resting up from their sinning of the night before, so
they will be in good shape for more sinning a little later on.</p>

<p>There are only four of these mission workers, and two of them
are old guys, and one is an old doll, while the other is a young
doll who is tootling on a cornet. And after a couple of ganders at
this young doll, The Sky is a goner, for this is one of the most
beautiful young dolls anybody ever sees on Broadway, and especially
as a mission worker. Her name is Miss Sarah Brown.</p>

<p>She is tall, and thin, and has a first-class shape, and her hair
is a light brown, going on blonde, and her eyes are like I do not
know what, except that they are one-hundred-per-cent eyes in every
respect. Furthermore, she is not a bad cornet player, if you like
cornet players, although at this spot on Broadway she has to play
against a scat band in a chop-suey joint near by, and this is tough
competition, although at that many citizens believe Miss Sarah
Brown will win by a large score if she only gets a little more
support from one of the old guys with her who has a big bass drum,
but does not pound it hearty enough.</p>

<p>Well, The Sky stands there listening to Miss Sarah Brown
tootling on the cornet for quite a spell, and then he hears her
make a speech in which she puts the blast on sin very good, and
boosts religion quite some, and says if there are any souls around
that need saving the owners of same may step forward at once. But
no one steps forward, so The Sky comes over to Mindy's restaurant
where many citizens are congregated, and starts telling us about
Miss Sarah Brown. But of course we already know about Miss Sarah
Brown, because she is so beautiful, and so good.</p>

<p>Furthermore, everybody feels somewhat sorry for Miss Sarah
Brown, for while she is always tootling the cornet, and making
speeches, and looking to save any souls that need saving, she never
seems to find any souls to save, or at least her bunch of mission
workers never gets any bigger. In fact, it gets smaller, as she
starts out with a guy who plays a very fair sort of trombone, but
this guy takes it on the lam one night with the trombone, which one
and all consider a dirty trick.</p>

<p>Now from this time on, The Sky does not take any interest in
anything but Miss Sarah Brown, and any night she is out on the
corner with the other mission workers, you will see The Sky
standing around looking at her, and naturally after a few weeks of
this, Miss Sarah Brown must know The Sky is looking at her, or she
is dumber than seems possible. And nobody ever figures Miss Sarah
Brown dumb, as she is always on her toes, and seems plenty able to
take care of herself, even on Broadway.</p>

<p>Sometimes after the street meeting is over, The Sky follows the
mission workers to their headquarters in an old storeroom around in
Forty-eighth Street where they generally hold an indoor session,
and I hear The Sky drops many a large coarse note in the collection
box while looking at Miss Sarah Brown, and there is no doubt these
notes come in handy around the mission, as I hear business is by no
means so good there.</p>

<p>It is called the Save-a-Soul Mission, and it is run mainly by
Miss Sarah Brown's grandfather, an old guy with whiskers, by the
name of Arvide Abernathy, but Miss Sarah Brown seems to do most of
the work, including tootling the cornet, and visiting the poor
people around and about, and all this and that, and many citizens
claim it is a great shame that such a beautiful doll is wasting her
time being good.</p>

<p>How The Sky ever becomes acquainted with Miss Sarah Brown is a
very great mystery, but the next thing anybody knows, he is saying
hello to her, and she is smiling at him out of her
one-hundred-per-cent eyes, and one evening when I happen to be with
The Sky we run into her walking along Forty-ninth Street, and The
Sky hauls off and stops her, and says it is a nice evening, which
it is, at that. Then The Sky says to Miss Sarah Brown like
this:</p>

<p>"Well," The Sky says, "how is the mission dodge going these
days? Are you saving any souls?" he says.</p>

<p>Well, it seems from what Miss Sarah Brown says the soul-saving
is very slow, indeed, these days.</p>

<p>"In fact," Miss Sarah Brown says, "I worry greatly about how few
souls we seem to save. Sometimes I wonder if we are lacking in
grace."</p>

<p>She goes on up the street, and The Sky stands looking after her,
and he says to me like this:</p>

<p>"I wish I can think of some way to help this little doll," he
says, "especially," he says, "in saving a few souls to build up her
mob at the mission. I must speak to her again, and see if I can
figure something out."</p>

<p>But The Sky does not get to speak to Miss Sarah Brown again,
because somebody weighs in the sacks on him by telling her he is
nothing but a professional gambler, and that he is a very
undesirable character, and that his only interest in hanging around
the mission is because she is a good-looking doll. So all of a
sudden Miss Sarah Brown plays a plenty of chill for The Sky.
Furthermore, she sends him word that she does not care to accept
any more of his potatoes in the collection box, because his
potatoes are nothing but ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>Well, naturally, this hurts The Sky's feelings no little, so he
quits standing around looking at Miss Sarah Brown, and going to the
mission, and takes to mingling again with the citizens in Mindy's,
and showing some interest in the affairs of the community,
especially the crap games.</p>

<p>Of course the crap games that are going on at this time are
nothing much, because practically everybody in the world is broke,
but there is a head-and-head game run by Nathan Detroit over a
garage in Fifty-second Street where there is occasionally some
action, and who shows up at this crap game early one evening but
The Sky, although it seems he shows up there more to find company
than anything else.</p>

<p>In fact, he only stands around watching the play, and talking
with other guys who are also standing around and watching, and many
of these guys are very high shots during the gold rush, although
most of them are now as clean as a jaybird, and maybe cleaner. One
of these guys is a guy by the name of Brandy Bottle Bates, who is
known from coast to coast as a high player when he has anything to
play with, and who is called Brandy Bottle Bates because it seems
that years ago he is a great hand for belting a brandy bottle
around.</p>

<p>This Brandy Bottle Bates is a big, black-looking guy, with a
large beezer, and a head shaped like a pear, and he is considered a
very immoral and wicked character, but he is a pretty slick
gambler, and a fast man with a dollar when he is in the money.</p>

<p>Well, finally The Sky asks Brandy Bottle why he is not playing
and Brandy laughs, and states as follows:</p>

<p>"Why," he says, "in the first place I have no potatoes, and in
the second place I doubt if it will do me much good if I do have
any potatoes the way I am going the past year. Why," Brandy Bottle
says, "I cannot win a bet to save my soul."</p>

<p>Now this crack seems to give The Sky an idea, as he stands
looking at Brandy Bottle very strangely, and while he is looking,
Big Nig, the crap shooter, picks up the dice and hits three times
hand-running, bing, bing, bing. Then Big Nig comes out on a six and
Brandy Bottle Bates speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"You see how my luck is," he says. "Here is Big Nig hotter than
a stove, and here I am without a bob to follow him with,
especially," Brandy says, "when he is looking for nothing but a
six. Why," he says, "Nig can make sixes all night when he is hot.
If he does not make this six, the way he is, I will be willing to
turn square and quit gambling forever."</p>

<p>"Well, Brandy," The Sky says, "I will make you a proposition. I
will lay you a G note Big Nig does not get his six. I will lay you
a G note against nothing but your soul," he says. "I mean if Big
Nig does not get his six, you are to turn square and join Miss
Sarah Brown's mission for six months."</p>

<p>"Bet!" Brandy Bottle Bates says right away, meaning the
proposition is on, although the chances are he does not quite
understand the proposition. All Brandy understands is The Sky
wishes to wager that Big Nig does not make his six, and Brandy
Bottle Bates will be willing to bet his soul a couple of times over
on Big Nig making his six, and figure he is getting the best of it,
at that, as Brandy has great confidence in Nig.</p>

<p>Well, sure enough, Big Nig makes the six, so The Sky weeds
Brandy Bottle Bates a G note, although everybody around is saying
The Sky makes a terrible over-lay of the natural price in giving
Brandy Bottle a G against his soul. Furthermore, everybody around
figures the chances are The Sky only wishes to give Brandy an
opportunity to get in action, and nobody figures The Sky is on the
level about trying to win Brandy Bottle Bates' soul, especially as
The Sky does not seem to wish to go any further after paying the
bet.</p>

<p>He only stands there looking on and seeming somewhat depressed
as Brandy Bottle goes into action on his own account with the G
note, fading other guys around the table with cash money. But
Brandy Bottle Bates seems to figure what is in The Sky's mind
pretty well, because Brandy Bottle is a crafty old guy.</p>

<p>It finally comes his turn to handle the dice, and he hits a
couple of times, and then he comes out on a four, and anybody will
tell you that a four is a very tough point to make, even with a
lead pencil. Then Brandy Bottle turns to The Sky and speaks to him
as follows:</p>

<p>"Well, Sky," he says, "I will take the odds off you on this one.
I know you do not want my dough," he says. "I know you only want my
soul for Miss Sarah Brown, and," he says, "without wishing to be
fresh about it, I know why you want it for her. I am young once
myself," Brandy Bottle says. "And you know if I lose to you, I will
be over there in Forty-eighth Street in an hour pounding on the
door, for Brandy always settles.</p>

<p>"But, Sky," he says, "now I am in the money, and my price goes
up. Will you lay me ten G's against my soul I do not make this
four?"</p>

<p>"Bet!" The Sky says, and right away Brandy Bottle makes his
four.</p>

<p>Well, when word goes around that The Sky is up at Nathan
Detroit's crap game trying to win Brandy Bottle Bates' soul for
Miss Sarah Brown, the excitement is practically intense. Somebody
telephones Mindy's, where a large number of citizens are sitting
around arguing about this and that, and telling one another how
much they will bet in support of their arguments, if only they have
something to bet, and Mindy himself is almost killed in the rush
for the door.</p>

<p>One of the first guys out of Mindy's and up to the crap game is
Regret, the horse player, and as he comes in Brandy Bottle is
looking for a nine, and The Sky is laying him twelve G's against
his soul that he does not make this nine, for it seems Brandy
Bottle's soul keeps getting more and more expensive.</p>

<p>Well, Regret wishes to bet his soul against a G that Brandy
Bottle gets his nine, and is greatly insulted when The Sky cannot
figure his price any better than a double saw, but finally Regret
accepts this price, and Brandy Bottle hits again.</p>

<p>Now many other citizens request a little action from The Sky,
and if there is one thing The Sky cannot deny a citizen it is
action, so he says he will lay them according to how he figures
their word to join Miss Sarah Brown's mission if Brandy Bottle
misses out, but about this time The Sky finds he has no more
potatoes on him, being now around thirty-five G's loser, and he
wishes to give markers.</p>

<p>But Brandy Bottle says that while ordinarily he will be pleased
to extend The Sky this accommodation, he does not care to accept
markers against his soul, so then The Sky has to leave the joint
and go over to his hotel two or three blocks away, and get the
night clerk to open his damper so The Sky can get the rest of his
bank roll. In the meantime the crap game continues at Nathan
Detroit's among the small operators, while the other citizens stand
around and say that while they hear of many a daffy proposition in
their time, this is the daffiest that ever comes to their
attention, although Big Nig claims he hears of a daffier one, but
cannot think what it is.</p>

<p>Big Nig claims that all gamblers are daffy anyway, and in fact
he says if they are not daffy they will not be gamblers, and while
he is arguing this matter back comes The Sky with fresh scratch,
and Brandy Bottle Bates takes up where he leaves off, although
Brandy says he is accepting the worst of it, as the dice have a
chance to cool off.</p>

<p>Now the upshot of the whole business is that Brandy Bottle hits
thirteen licks in a row, and the last lick he makes is on a ten,
and it is for twenty G's against his soul, with about a dozen other
citizens getting anywhere from one to five C's against their souls,
and complaining bitterly of the price.</p>

<p>And as Brandy Bottle makes his ten, I happen to look at The Sky
and I see him watching Brandy with a very peculiar expression on
his face, and furthermore I see The Sky's right hand creeping
inside his coat where I know he always packs a Betsy in a shoulder
holster, so I can see something is wrong somewhere.</p>

<p>But before I can figure out what it is, there is quite a fuss at
the door, and loud talking, and a doll's voice, and all of a sudden
in bobs nobody else but Miss Sarah Brown. It is plain to be seen
that she is all steamed up about something.</p>

<p>She marches right up to the crap table where Brandy Bottle Bates
and The Sky and the other citizens are standing, and one and all
are feeling sorry for Dobber, the doorman, thinking of what Nathan
Detroit is bound to say to him for letting her in. The dice are
still lying on the table showing Brandy Bottles Bates' last throw,
which cleans The Sky and gives many citizens the first means they
enjoy in several months.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Sarah Brown looks at The Sky, and The Sky looks at
Miss Sarah Brown, and Miss Sarah Brown looks at the citizens around
and about, and one and all are somewhat dumbfounded, and nobody
seems to be able to think of much to say, although The Sky finally
speaks up as follows:</p>

<p>"Good evening," The Sky says. "It is a nice evening," he says.
"I am trying to win a few souls for you around here, but," he says,
"I seem to be about half out of luck."</p>

<p>"Well," Miss Sarah Brown says, looking at The Sky most severely
out of her hundred-per-cent eyes, "you are taking too much upon
yourself. I can win any souls I need myself. You better be thinking
of your own soul. By the way," she says, "are you risking your own
soul, or just your money?"</p>

<p>Well, of course up to this time The Sky is not risking anything
but his potatoes, so he only shakes his head to Miss Sarah Brown's
question, and looks somewhat disorganized.</p>

<p>"I know something about gambling," Miss Sarah Brown says,
"especially about crap games. I ought to," she says. "It ruins my
poor papa and my brother Joe. If you wish to gamble for souls,
Mister Sky, gamble for your own soul."</p>

<p>Now Miss Sarah Brown opens a small black leather pocketbook she
is carrying in one hand, and pulls out a two-dollar bill, and it is
such a two-dollar bill as seems to have seen much service in its
time, and holding up this deuce, Miss Sarah Brown speaks as
follows:</p>

<p>"I will gamble with you, Mister Sky," she says. "I will gamble
with you," she says, "on the same terms you gamble with these
parties here. This two dollars against your soul, Mister Sky. It is
all I have, but," she says, "it is more than your soul is
worth."</p>

<p>Well, of course anybody can see that Miss Sarah Brown is doing
this because she is very angry, and wishes to make The Sky look
small, but right away The Sky's duke comes from inside his coat,
and he picks up the dice and hands them to her and speaks as
follows:</p>

<p>"Roll them," The Sky says, and Miss Sarah Brown snatches the
dice out of his hand and gives them a quick sling on the table in
such a way that anybody can see she is not a professional crap
shooter, and not even an amateur crap shooter, for all amateur crap
shooters first breathe on the dice, and rattle them good, and make
remarks to them, such as "Come on, baby!"</p>

<p>In fact, there is some criticism of Miss Sarah Brown afterwards
on account of her haste, as many citizens are eager to string with
her to hit, while others are just as anxious to bet she misses, and
she does not give them a chance to get down.</p>

<p>Well, Scranton Slim is the stick guy, and he takes a gander at
the dice as they hit up against the side of the table and bounce
back, and then Slim hollers, "Winner, winner, winner," as stick
guys love to do, and what is showing on the dice as big as life,
but a six and a five, which makes eleven, no matter how you figure,
so The Sky's soul belongs to Miss Sarah Brown.</p>

<p>She turns at once and pushes through the citizens around the
table without even waiting to pick up the deuce she lays down when
she grabs the dice. Afterwards a most obnoxious character by the
name of Red Nose Regan tries to claim the deuce as a sleeper and
gets the heave-o from Nathan Detroit, who becomes very indignant
about this, stating that Red Nose is trying to give his joint a
wrong rap.</p>

<p>Naturally, The Sky follows Miss Brown, and Dobber, the doorman,
tells me that as they are waiting for him to unlock the door and
let them out, Miss Sarah Brown turns on The Sky and speaks to him
as follows:</p>

<p>"You are a fool," Miss Sarah Brown says.</p>

<p>Well, at this Dobber figures The Sky is bound to let one go, as
this seems to be most insulting language, but instead of letting
one go, The Sky only smiles at Miss Sarah Brown and says to her
like this:</p>

<p>"Why," The Sky says, "Paul says 'If any man among you seemeth to
be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.'
I love you, Miss Sarah Brown," The Sky says.</p>

<p>Well, now, Dobber has a pretty fair sort of memory, and he says
that Miss Sarah Brown tells The Sky that since he seems to know so
much about the Bible, maybe he remembers the second verse of the
Song of Solomon, but the chances are Dobber muffs the number of the
verse, because I look the matter up in one of these Gideon Bibles,
and the verse seems a little too much for Miss Sarah Brown,
although of course you never can tell.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is about all there is to the story, except that
Brandy Bottle Bates slides out during the confusion so quietly even
Dobber scarcely remembers letting him out, and he takes most of The
Sky's potatoes with him, but he soon gets batted in against the
faro bank out in Chicago, and the last anybody hears of him he gets
religion all over again, and is preaching out in San Jose, so The
Sky always claims he beats Brandy for his soul, at that.</p>

<p>I see The Sky the other night at Forty-ninth Street and
Broadway, and he is with quite a raft of mission workers, including
Mrs. Sky, for it seems that the soul-saving business picks up
wonderfully, and The Sky is giving a big bass drum such a
first-class whacking that the scat band in the chop-suey joint can
scarcely be heard. Furthermore, The Sky is hollering between
whacks, and I never see a guy look happier, especially when Mrs.
Sky smiles at him out of her hundred-per-cent eyes. But I do not
linger long, because The Sky gets a gander at me, and right away he
begins hollering:</p>

<p>"I see before me a sinner of deepest dye," he hollers. "Oh,
sinner, repent before it is too late. Join with us, sinner," he
hollers, "and let us save your soul."</p>

<p>Naturally, this crack about me being a sinner embarrasses me no
little, as it is by no means true, and it is a good thing for The
Sky there is no copper in me, or I will go to Mrs. Sky, who is
always bragging about how she wins The Sky's soul by outplaying him
at his own game, and tell her the truth.</p>

<p>And the truth is that the dice with which she wins The Sky's
soul, and which are the same dice with which Brandy Bottle Bates
wins all his potatoes, are strictly phony, and that she gets into
Nathan Detroit's just in time to keep The Sky from killing old
Brandy Bottle.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MELANCHOLY_DANE" id="THE_MELANCHOLY_DANE">18. THE
MELANCHOLY DANE</a>
</h2>

<p>IT is a matter of maybe two years back that I run into Ambrose
Hammer, the newspaper scribe, one evening on Broadway and he
requests me to attend the theatre with him, as Ambrose is what is
called a dramatic critic and his racket is to witness all the new
plays and write what he thinks about them in a morning blat.</p>

<p>I often hear the actors and the guys who write the plays talking
about Ambrose in Mindy's restaurant when they get the last edition
and read what he has to say, and as near as I can make out, they
feel that he is nothing but a low criminal type because it seems
that Ambrose practically murders one and all connected with any new
play. So I say to him like this:</p>

<p>"No, Ambrose," I say, "I may happen to know the guy who writes
the play you are going to see, or one of the actors, and as I
understand it is always about nine to five that you will put the
blister on a new play, I will be running the risk of hurting myself
socially along Broadway. Furthermore," I say, "where is Miss
Channelle Cooper who accompanies you to the new plays for the past
six months hand-running?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Ambrose says, "you need not worry about the guy who writes
this play, as his name is Shakespeare and he is dead quite a spell.
You need not worry about any of the actors, either, as they are
just a bunch of plumbers that no one ever hears of before, except
maybe the leading one who has some slight notoriety. And, as for
Miss Channelle Cooper, I do not know where she is at this
particular moment and, not to give you a short answer, I do not
give a D and an A and an M and an N."</p>

<p>"Why, Ambrose," I say, "the last time we meet, you tell me that
you are on fire with love for Miss Channelle Cooper, although, of
course," I say, "you are on fire with love for so many different
broads since I know you that I am surprised you are not reduced to
ashes long ago."</p>

<p>"Look," Ambrose says, "let us not discuss such a tender subject
as Miss Cooper at this time or I am apt to break into tears and be
in no mood to impartially perform my stern duty towards this play.
All I know is she sends me a letter by messenger this morning,
stating that she cannot see me to-night because her grandmother's
diabetes is worse and she has to go to Yonkers to see her.</p>

<p>"And," Ambrose goes on, "I happen to know that in the first
place her grandmother does not have diabetes but only a tumour, and
in the second place she does not live in Yonkers but in Greenwich
Village, and in the third place Miss Cooper is seen late this
afternoon having tea at the Plaza with an eighteen-carat hambola by
the name of Mansfield Sothern. I wonder," Ambrose says, "if the bim
is ever born who can tell the truth?"</p>

<p>"No, Ambrose," I say, "or anyway not yet. But," I say, "I am
surprised to hear Miss Cooper turns out unstable, as she always
strikes me as the reliable sort and very true to you, or at least
as true as you can expect these days. In fact," I say, "I have it
on good authority that she turns down Lefty Lyons, the slot-machine
king, who offers to take charge of her career and buy a night club
for her. But of course Mansfield Sothern is something else again. I
often enjoy his comedy on the stage."</p>

<p>"He is a hunk of Smithfield who steals the names of two great
actors to make one for himself," Ambrose says. "I will admit that
he is sometimes endurable in musical comedy, if you close your eyes
when he is on the boards and make believe he is somebody else, but,
like all actors, he is egotistical enough to think he can play
Hamlet. In fact," Ambrose says, "he is going to do it to-night and
I can scarcely wait."</p>

<p>Well, I finally go to the theatre with Ambrose and it is quite a
high-toned occasion with nearly everybody in the old
thirteen-and-odd because Mansfield Sothern has a big following in
musical comedy and it seems that his determination to play Hamlet
produces quite a sensation, though Ambrose claims that most of
those present are members of Mansfield's personal clique from café
society and he also claims that it is all nothing but a plot to
make Mansfield seem important.</p>

<p>Personally, I am not a Shakespeare man, although I see several
of his plays before and, to tell you the truth, I am never able to
savvy them, though naturally I do not admit this in public as I do
not wish to appear unintelligent. But I stick with Ambrose through
the first act of this one and I observe that Mansfield Sothern is
at least a right large Hamlet and has a voice that makes him sound
as if he is talking from down in a coal mine, though what he is
talking about is not clear to me and consequently does not arouse
my interest.</p>

<p>So as Ambrose seems very thoughtful and paying no attention to
me, I quietly take my departure and go to Mindy's where some hours
later along in the early morning, I notice Miss Channelle Cooper
and this gee Mansfield Sothern reading Ambrose's column, and
Mansfield is shedding tears on the paper until the printer's ink
runs down into his bacon and eggs. Naturally, I go out and buy a
paper at once to see what causes his distress and I find that
Ambrose writes about the play as follows:</p>

<p>"After Mansfield Sothern's performance of Hamlet at the Todd
Theatre last night, there need no longer be controversy as to the
authorship of the immortal drama. All we need do is examine the
graves of Shakespeare and Bacon, and the one that has turned over
is it."</p>

<p>Now I do not clap eyes on Ambrose Hammer again until the other
evening when he enters Mindy's at dinner-time, walking with a cane
and limping slightly. Furthermore, he is no longer roly-poly, but
quite thin and he gives me a huge hello and sits down at my table
and speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>"Well, well," Ambrose says, "this is indeed a coincidence. The
last time we meet I take you to a theatre and now I am going to
take you again on my first night back in harness. How is the
<i>gedemte brust</i> and the <i>latkas</i> you are devouring?"</p>

<p>"The <i>latkas</i> are all right, Ambrose," I say, "but the
<i>brust</i> is strictly second run. The war conditions are such
that we must now take what we can get, even when it comes to
<i>brust</i>. I do not see you for a spell, Ambrose. Are you absent
from the city and why are you packing the stick?"</p>

<p>"Why," Ambrose says, "I am overseas and I am wounded in North
Africa. Do you mean to tell me I am not missed in these parts?"</p>

<p>"Well, Ambrose," I say, "now that you mention it, I do remember
hearing you are mixed up in the war business, but we are so busy
missing other personalities that we do not get around to missing
you as yet. And as for going to the theatre with you, I must pass,
because the last time you steer me up against a most unenjoyable
evening. By the way, Ambrose," I say, "I wonder what ever becomes
of that bloke Mansfield Sothern and Miss Channelle Cooper. And what
are you doing in North Africa, anyway?"</p>

<p>I am in North Africa (Ambrose says) risking my life for my paper
as a war correspondent because one day my editor calls me into his
office and speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>"Hammer," he says, "kindly go to the front and send us back
human-interest stories about our soldiers. Our soldiers are what
our readers are interested in. Please eat with them and sleep with
them and tell us how they live and what they think about and how
they talk and so forth and so on."</p>

<p>So I go to London, and from London, I go to North Africa on a
transport, and on this voyage I endeavour to start following my
instructions at once, but I find that eating with the soldiers has
its disadvantages as they can eat much faster than I can because of
their greater experience and I am always getting shut out on the
choicer titbits. And when I ask one of them if I can sleep with
him, he gives me a strange look, and afterwards I have a feeling
that I am the subject of gossip among these gees. Furthermore, when
I try to listen in on their conversation to learn how they talk,
some of them figure I am a stool pigeon for the officers and wish
to dunk me in the ocean. It is by no means a soft touch to be a war
correspondent who is supposed to find out how the soldiers live and
how they talk and what they think about, and when I mention my
difficulties to one of the officers, he says I may get closer to
the boys if I enlist, but naturally I figure this will be carrying
war correspondenting too far.</p>

<p>But I write these human-interest stories just the same and I
think they are pretty good even if I do hear a guy in the censor's
office call me the poor man's Quentin Reynolds, and I always mingle
with the soldiers as much as possible to get their atmosphere and
finally when they learn I am kindly disposed towards them and
generally have plenty of cigarettes, they become quite
friendly.</p>

<p>I am sorry I do not have time to tell you a great deal about my
terrible personal experiences at the front, but I am putting them
all in the book I am writing, and you can buy a copy of it later.
In fact, I have enough terrible experiences for three books, only
my publisher states that he thinks one book per war correspondent
is sufficient for the North African campaign. He says that the way
correspondents are writing books on North Africa with Sicily and
Italy coming up, he does not figure his paper supply to last the
war out.</p>

<p>I first arrive at a place called Algiers in North Africa and I
find it is largely infested by Arabs and naturally I feel at home
at once, as in my younger days in show business when I am working
for a booking office, I personally book a wonderful Arab acrobatic
troop consisting of a real Arab by the name of Punchy, two guys by
the name of O'Shea, and a waffle who is known as Little Oran,
though her square monicker is really Magnolia Shapiro.</p>

<p>Consequently I have great sentiment for Arabs, and the sights
and scenes and smells of Algiers keep me thinking constantly of the
good old days, especially the smells. But I will not tax your
patience with the details of my stay in Algiers because by the time
I reach there the war moves away off to a place called Tunisia and
I am willing to let it stay there without my presence. Then, after
a week, my editor sends me a sharp message asking why I am not at
the front getting human-interest stories instead of loitering in
Algiers wasting my time on some tamale, although, as a matter of
fact, I am not wasting my time. And how he learns about the tamale
I have no idea, as she does not speak a word of English.</p>

<p>However, one way and another I proceed to a place called Bone
and then I continue on from there one way and another, but mostly
in a little consumptive car, in the general direction of Tunis, and
as I go, I keep asking passing British and American soldiers where
is the front. And they say the front is up front, and I keep going
and in my travels I get very sick and tired of the war because the
enemy is always dropping hot apples all over the landscape out of
planes, and sprinkling the roads with bullets or throwing big
shells that make the most uncouth noises around very carelessly
indeed.</p>

<p>Naturally, this impedes and delays my progress quite some
because, from time to time, I am compelled to pause and dismount
from my little bucket and seek refuge from these missiles in holes
in the earth, and, when I cannot find a hole, I seek the refuge by
falling on my face on the ground. In fact, I fall so often on my
face that I am commencing to fear I will wind up with a pug
nose.</p>

<p>Part of the time I am travelling with another newspaper scribe
by the name of Herbert something, but he goes to Foldsville on me
soon after we leave Bone, with a case of heartburn caused by eating
Army rations, which reminds me that I must speak to the F.B.I.
about these rations some day as it is my opinion that the books of
the guy who invents them should be looked over to see which side he
is betting on.</p>

<p>Well, all the time I keep asking where is the front, and all the
time the soldiers say the front is up front. But I do not seem to
ever find the front and, in fact, I later learn from an old soldier
that nobody ever finds the front because by the time they get to
where it ought to be, the front is apt to be the rear or the
middle, and it is all very confusing to be sure.</p>

<p>Early one morning, I arrive at what seems to be the ruins of a
little town, and at the same moment, an enemy battery on a hill a
couple of miles away starts throwing big biscuits into the town,
although I do not see hide or hair of anyone there, and whether it
is because they think some of our troops are in the town or just
have a personal grudge against me, I never learn.</p>

<p>Anyway, all of a sudden something nudges my little wagon from
under me and knocks it into pieces the size of confetti and at the
same moment I feel a distinct sensation of pain in my Francesca. It
comes to my mind that I am wounded and I lie there with what I know
is blood running down the inside of my pants leg which gives me a
most untidy feeling, indeed, and what is more, I am mentally
depressed quite some as I am already behind with my copy and I can
see where this will delay me further and cause my editor to become
most peevish.</p>

<p>But there is nothing I can do about it, only to keep on lying
there and to try to stop the blood as best I can and wait for
something to happen and also to hope that my mishap does not
inconvenience my editor too greatly.</p>

<p>It is coming on noon, and all around and about it is very quiet,
and nothing whatever seems to be stirring anywhere when who appears
but a big guy in our uniform, and he seems more surprised than
somewhat when he observes me, as he speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" he says. "What is this?"</p>

<p>"I am wounded," I say.</p>

<p>"Where?" he says.</p>

<p>"In the vestibule," I say.</p>

<p>Then he drops on one knee beside me and outs with a knife and
cuts open my pants and looks at the wound, and as he gets to his
feet, he says to me like this:</p>

<p>"Does it hurt?" he says. "Are you suffering greatly?"</p>

<p>"Sure I am," I say. "I am dying."</p>

<p>Now the guy laughs ha-ha-ha-ha, as if he just hears a good joke
and he says, "Look at me, Hammer," he says. "Do you not recognize
me?"</p>

<p>Naturally I look and I can see that he is nobody but this
Mansfield Sothern, the actor, and of course I am greatly pleased at
the sight of him.</p>

<p>"Mansfield," I say, "I am never so glad to see an old friend in
my life."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by old friend?" Mansfield says. "I am not your
old friend. I am not even your new friend. Hammer," he says, "are
you really in great pain?"</p>

<p>"Awful," I say. "Please get me to a doctor."</p>

<p>Well, at this, he laughs ha-ha-ha-ha again and says, "Hammer,
all my professional life, I am hoping to one day see a dramatic
critic suffer, and you have no idea what pleasure you are now
giving me, but I think it only fair for you to suffer out loud with
groans and one thing and another. Hammer," Mansfield says, "I am
enjoying a privilege that any actor will give a squillion dollars
to experience."</p>

<p>"Look, Mansfield," I say, "kindly cease your clowning and take
me somewhere. I am in great agony."</p>

<p>"Ha-ha-ha-ha," Mansfield Sothern ha-has. "Hammer, I cannot get
you to a doctor because the Jeremiahs seem to be between us and our
lines. I fear they nab the rest of my patrol. It is only by good
luck that I elude them myself and then, lo and behold, I find you.
I do not think there are any of the enemy right around this spot at
the moment and I am going to lug you into yonder building, but it
is not because I take pity on you. It is only because I wish to
keep you near me so I can see you suffer."</p>

<p>Then he picks me up in his arms and carries me inside the walls
of what seems to be an old inn, though it has no roof and no
windows or doors, and even the walls are a little shaky from much
shellfire, and he puts me down on the floor and washes my wound
with water from his canteen and puts sulpha powder on my wound and
gives me some to swallow, and all the time he is talking a blue
streak.</p>

<p>"Hammer," he says, "do you remember the night I give my
performance of Hamlet and you knock my brains out? Well, you are in
no more agony now than I am then. I die ten thousand deaths when I
read your criticism. Furthermore, you alienate the affections of
Miss Channelle Cooper from me, because she thinks you are a great
dramatic critic, and when you say I am a bad Hamlet, she believes
you and cancels our engagement. She says she cannot bear the idea
of being married to a bad Hamlet. Hammer," he says, "am I a bad
Hamlet?"</p>

<p>"Mansfield," I say, "I now regret I cause you anguish."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sothern to you," Mansfield says. "Hammer," he says, "I hear
you only see two acts of my Hamlet."</p>

<p>"That is true," I say. "I have to hasten back to my office to
write my review."</p>

<p>"Why," he says, "how dare you pass on the merits of an artist on
such brief observation? Does your mad jealousy of me over Miss
Channelle Cooper cause you to forget you are a human being and make
a hyena of you? Or are all dramatic critics just naturally hyenas,
as I suspect?"</p>

<p>"Mansfield," I say, "while I admit to much admiration and, in
fact, love for Miss Channelle Cooper, I never permit my emotions to
bias my professional efforts. When I state you are a bad Hamlet, I
state my honest conviction and while I now suffer the tortures of
the damned, I still state it."</p>

<p>"Hammer," Mansfield Sothern says, "listen to me and observe me
closely because I am now going to run through the grave-diggers'
scene for you which you do not see me do, and you can tell me
afterwards if Barrymore or Leslie Howard or Maurice Evans ever
gives a finer performance."</p>

<p>And with this, what does he do but pick up a big stone from the
floor and strike a pose and speak as follows:</p>

<p>"'Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite
jest, of most excellent fancy; he hath borne me on his back a
thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my
gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs?
your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the tables on a
roar? Not one, now, to mock your own grinning? quite chapfallen?
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an
inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that.
Pr'ythee, Horatio, tell me one thing'"</p>

<p>Now Mansfield stops and looks at me and says: "Come, come,
Hammer, you're Horatio. Throw me the line."</p>

<p>So I try to remember what Horatio remarks at this point in
Hamlet and finally I say, "'How is that, my lord?'"</p>

<p>"No, no," Mansfield says. "Not 'How is that?' but 'What's that?'
And you presume to criticize me!"</p>

<p>"All right, Mansfield," I say. "'What's that, my lord!'"</p>

<p>And Mansfield says, "'Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this
fashion i' the earth?'"</p>

<p>I say, "'E'en so.'"</p>

<p>"'And smelt so?' pah!" Mansfield says, and with this, he throws
the stone to the floor, and at the same moment I hear another noise
and, on looking around, what do I see in the doorway but two German
officers covered with dust, and one of them says in English like
this:</p>

<p>"What is going on here?"</p>

<p>Naturally, I am somewhat nonplussed at the sight of these guys,
but Mansfield Sothern does not seem to notice them and continues
reciting in a loud voice.</p>

<p>"He is an actor in civil life," I say to the German. "He is now
presenting his version of Hamlet to me."</p>

<p>"'To what base uses we may return, Horatio!'" Mansfield Sothern
says. "'Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander
&mdash;- '"</p>

<p>"'Till he finds it stopping a bunghole?'" the German cuts in and
then Mansfield looks at him and says: "'Find,' not 'finds,'" he
says.</p>

<p>"Quite right," the German says. "Well, you are now prisoners. I
will send some of my soldiers to pick you up immediately. Do not
attempt to leave this place or you will be shot, as we have the
town surrounded."</p>

<p>Then the two depart and Mansfield stops reciting at once and
says, "Let us duffy out of here. It is growing dark outside, and I
think we can make it. Are you still suffering first class,
Hammer?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I say, "and I cannot walk an inch, either."</p>

<p>So Mansfield laughs ha-ha-ha and picks me up again as easy as if
I am nothing but a bag of wind and carries me out through what
seems to have been a back door to the joint, but before we go into
the open, he throws himself face downward on the ground and tells
me to pull myself on his back and hook my arms around his neck and
hold on, and I do the same. Then he starts crawling along like he
is a turtle and I am its shell. Naturally, our progress is very
slow, especially as we hear guys everywhere around us in the dark
talking in German.</p>

<p>Every few yards, Mansfield has to stop to rest, and I roll off
his back until he is ready to start again and, during one of these
halts, he whispers, "Hammer, are you still suffering?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I say.</p>

<p>"Good," Mansfield says, and then he goes on crawling.</p>

<p>I do not know how far he crawls with me aboard him because I am
getting a little groggy, but I do remember him whispering very
softly to himself like this:</p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>"'Imperious Caesar, dead and
turn'd to clay,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;"><i>Might stop a hole to keep the
wind away.'"</i></span><br>

<p>Well, Mansfield crawls and crawls and crawls until he crawls
himself and me right into a bunch of our guys, and the next thing I
know is I wake up in a hospital, and who is sitting there beside me
but Mansfield Sothern and, when he sees I am awake, he says like
this:</p>

<p>"'O, I die, Horatio.'"</p>

<p>"Mansfield," I say, "kindly cheese it and permit me to thank you
for saving my life."</p>

<p>"Hammer," he says, "the pleasure is all mine. I am sustained on
my long crawl (which they tell me is a new world record for
crawling with a guy on the deck of the crawler) by the thought that
I have on my back a dramatic critic who is suffering keenly every
inch of the way.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he says, "that you hear I am decorated for rescuing
you, but kindly keep it quiet, as the Actors' Guild will never
forgive me for rescuing a critic. Also, Hammer, I am being sent
home to organize overseas entertainment for my comrades, and
naturally it will be along Shakespearean lines. Tell me, Hammer, do
you observe your nurse as yet?"</p>

<p>And, with this, Mansfield points to a doll in uniform standing
not far away, and I can see that it is nobody but Miss Channelle
Cooper, and I can also see that she is hoping she is looking like
Miss Florence Nightingale. When she notices I am awake, she starts
towards my cot, but at her approach, Mansfield Sothern gets up and
departs quite hastily without as much as saying boo to her and and
as she stands looking at him, tears come to her eyes and I can see
that a coolness must still prevail between them.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am by no means displeased by this situation because
the sight of Miss Channelle Cooper even in a nurse's uniform brings
back fond memories to me and, in fact, I feel all my old love for
her coming up inside me like a lump, and, as she reaches my
bedside, I can scarcely speak because of my emotion.</p>

<p>"You must be quiet, Ambrose," she says. "You know you are
delirious for days and days, and in your delirium you say things
about me that cause me much embarrassment. Does Mansfield happen to
mention my name?"</p>

<p>"No," I say. "Forget him, Channelle. He is a cad as well as a
bad Hamlet."</p>

<p>But the tears in her eyes increase, and suddenly she leaves me
and I do not see her for some days afterward and, in fact, I do not
even think of her because my editor is sending me messages wishing
to know what I am doing in a hospital on his time and to get out of
there at once, and what do I mean by putting a horse in my last
expense account, which of course is an error in bookkeeping due to
my haste in making out the account. What I intend putting in is a
hearse, as I figure that my editor will be too confused by such an
unexpected item to dispute it.</p>

<p>So here I am back in the good old U.S.A. (Ambrose says) and now
as I previously state I am going to take you to the theatre again
with me, and who are you going to see but our old friend Mansfield
Sothern playing Hamlet once more!</p>

<p>Now this prospect by no means thrills me, but I am unable to
think of a good out at once, so I accompany Ambrose, and when we
arrive at the theatre, we find the manager, who is a guy by the
name of James Burdekin, walking up and down in front of the joint
and speaking in the most disparaging terms of actors, and customers
are milling around the lobby and on the sidewalks outside.</p>

<p>They are going up to James Burdekin and saying, "What is the
matter, Burdekin?" and "When does the curtain go up!" and "Who do
you think you are?" and all this and that, which only causes him to
become very disrespectful indeed in his expressions about actors
and, in fact, he is practically libellous, and it is several
minutes before Ambrose and I can figure out the nature of his
emotion.</p>

<p>Then we learn that what happens is that Mansfield Sothern
collapses in his dressing-room a few minutes before the curtain is
to rise, and, as the gaff is all sold out, it is naturally a
terrible predicament for James Burdekin, as he may have to refund
the money, and thinking of this has James on the verge of a
collapse himself.</p>

<p>"Hammer," he says to Ambrose, "you will do me a favour if you
will go backstage and see if you can find out what is eating this
hamdonny. I am afraid to trust myself to even look at him at the
moment."</p>

<p>So Ambrose and I go around to the stage entrance and up to
Mansfield Sothern's dressing room, and there is Mansfield sprawled
in a chair in his Hamlet make-up, while his dresser, an old
stovelid by the name of Crichton, is swabbing Mansfield's brow with
a towel and speaking soothing words to him in a Southern
accent.</p>

<p>"Why, Mansfield," Ambrose says, "what seems to ail you that you
keep an eager audience waiting and put James Burdekin in a
condition bordering on hysteria?"</p>

<p>"I cannot go on," Mansfield says. "My heart is too heavy. I just
learn of your return and, as I am sitting here thinking of how you
must make plenty of hay-hay with Miss Channelle Cooper when you are
lying there under her loving care in North Africa and telling her
what a bad Hamlet I am, I am overcome with grief. Ambrose," he
says, "is there any hope of you being crippled for life?"</p>

<p>"No." Ambrose says. "Come, come, Mansfield," he says. "Pull
yourself together. Think of your career and of poor James Burdekin
and the box-office receipts. Remember the ancient tradition of the
theatre: The show must go on&mdash;although, personally, I do not
always see why."</p>

<p>"I cannot," Mansfield says. "Her face will rise before me, and
my words will choke me as I think of her in another's arms.
Ambrose, I am in bad shape, but I am man enough to congratulate
you. I hope and trust you will always be happy with Miss Channelle
Cooper, even if you are a dramatic critic. But I cannot go on in my
present state of mind. I am too melancholy even for Hamlet."</p>

<p>"Oh," Ambrose says, "do not worry about Miss Channelle Cooper.
She loves you dearly. The last time I see her, I request her to be
my ever-loving wife when this cruel war is over, but she says it
can never be, as she loves only you. I say all right; if she wishes
to love a bad Hamlet instead of a good correspondent, to go ahead.
And then," Ambrose says, "Miss Channelle Cooper speaks to me as
follows:</p>

<p>"'No, Ambrose,' she says. 'He is not a bad Hamlet. A better
judge than you says he is a fine Hamlet. Professor Bierbauer, the
great dramatic coach of Heidelberg, now a colonel in the German
army, tells me he witnesses a performance by Mansfield in a ruined
tavern in a town near the front, that, under the conditions, is the
most magnificent effort of the kind he ever views.'</p>

<p>"It seems," Ambrose says, "that the professor is wounded and
captured by our guys when they retake the town, and, at the moment
Miss Channelle Cooper is addressing me, he is one of her patients
in a near-by ward, where I have no doubt he gets quite an earful on
your history and her love. Where are you going, Mansfield?"</p>

<p>"Why," Mansfield says, "I am going around the corner to send a
cablegram to Miss Channelle Cooper, telling her I reciprocate her
love and also requesting her to get Professor Bierbauer's opinion
in writing for my scrapbook."</p>

<p>Well, I wait up in Mindy's restaurant with Mansfield to get the
last editions containing the reviews of the critics and, naturally,
the first review we turn to is Ambrose Hammer's, and at Mansfield's
request I read it aloud as follows:</p>

<p>"'Mansfield Sothern's inspired performance of Hamlet at the Todd
Theatre last night leads up to the hope that in this sterling young
actor we have a new dramatic force of the power of Shakespearean
roles of all the mighty figures of another day, perhaps including
even the immortal Edwin Booth.'</p>

<p>"Well, Mansfield," I say, when I finish, "I think Ambrose now
pays you off in full on your account with him, including saving his
life, what with giving you Miss Channelle Cooper and this wonderful
boost, which, undoubtedly, establishes your future in the
theatre."</p>

<p>"Humph!" Mansfield says. "It seems a fair appraisal at that, and
I will send a clipping to Miss Channelle Cooper at once, but," he
says, "there is undoubtedly a streak of venom left in Ambrose
Hammer. Else, why does he ring in Booth?"</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="BARBECUE" id="BARBECUE">19. BARBECUE</a>
</h2>

<p>ONE afternoon in an early November, I am sitting in Chesty
Charles' little Sharkskin Grill on Biscayne Boulevard in the city
of Miami, Florida, chatting of this and that with a guy by the name
of High-C Homer, who is called by this name because he loves to
sing songs in a real high voice.</p>

<p>In fact, Homer tells me that when he is much younger he wishes
to become a singer by trade and tries out one amateur night at the
old Colonial Theatre in New York but he says professional jealousy
is very strong at the time and somebody in the audience pegs a
turnip at him while he is singing Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt and hits
him on the Adam's apple and affects his vocal cords so his voice is
never again good enough for the stage, but all right for back
rooms.</p>

<p>Anyway, when he sees there is no hope for him in a musical
career, Homer has to find something else to do and what he does is
the best he can, which is one thing and another, and he is
explaining to me in the Sharkskin Grill that even doing the best he
can, he is not doing so good, when in comes a fuzz by the name of
Finnegan, a fuzz being a way of saying a plain-clothes copper, who
steps up to Homer and speaks to him as follows:</p>

<p>"Homer, the chief of police will consider it a favour if you
will kindly bid us farewell."</p>

<p>"Why?" Homer says. "What is his idea?"</p>

<p>"Does the chief have to have one?" Finnegan asks.</p>

<p>"No," Homer says, "by no means and not at all. I am just
wondering."</p>

<p>"Well," Finnegan says, "when he first mentions your name he
requests me to bring you in because it seems a large touch comes
off in West Palm Tuesday night and right away the chief thinks of
you. But," Finnegan says, "I remember seeing you in the police
station all night Tuesday night trying to square that traffic
violation, so you cannot also be in West Palm and when I speak of
this to the chief he says all right but to suggest your departure
anyway. You may thank me if you wish."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Homer says. "Do you mind telling me the details of the
touch to which you refer?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Finnegan says, "it is a pay-off swindle. They beat an old
simkin from Iowa for fifty thousand tears of blood."</p>

<p>"A fifty-er?" Homer says. "My goodness, this is important moo.
But, Finnegan," he says, "I am not in the pay-off world and I do
not see how anybody can associate me with such incidents. I am an
operator on the race courses and quite upright and legitimate."</p>

<p>"Well," Finnegan says, "if you call skinning marks on those
phony tip sheets you peddle legitimate, maybe you are legit, but
perhaps the chief looks through the files on you. I seem to be able
to remember some things myself."</p>

<p>"Never mind," Homer says. "Tell the cheese of police good-bye
for me, Finnegan, and the same to you."</p>

<p>Then Homer thinks a while and finally he guesses he will go over
to Tampa and he invites me to accompany him and as it is quite a
while before the races start in Miami and I have nothing on my mind
at the moment and the fuzz also gives me some severe looks, I
accept the invitation.</p>

<p>So Homer goes to a parking lot not far away where he keeps an
old bucket parked and presently we are rolling along the Tamiami
Trail headed west, and as we journey along Homer sings several
songs to me that sound very soothing but all the time he seems to
be in deep thought and finally he sighs and says to me like
this:</p>

<p>"Well," Homer says, "fifty thou is undoubtedly a splendid tally
but I am glad I am not in on it. Honesty is the best policy, to be
sure. There are no handholds on a wrong dollar. The way of the
transgressor is hard. But," he says, "if it is the guys I think it
is, they at least owe me the courtesy of a refusal to participate
because of past favours rendered. I never hear a word from
them."</p>

<p>Then Homer begins singing again and I get to thinking that it is
really most remarkable that there are still marks in this world for
the pay-off, as the pay-off is really a very old-fashioned dodge in
which the marks are convinced that they are being let in on crooked
horse races and are permitted to win a while in an astonishing
manner, but when they commence asking about being paid off they are
told they must first prove they will be able to settle if they
happen to lose.</p>

<p>So the marks generally send to their banks and get the cash
money to prove this, as the pay-off guy never picks marks who do
not have cash money in banks, and the next thing anybody knows the
money disappears and so do the pay-off guys. Furthermore, the marks
seldom squawk, as the pay-off guys are cute enough to pick marks
who cannot afford to let it become noised about that they are
trying to make a few dishonest dibs, though it is well known to one
and all that when such a mark does squawk it is the loudest squawk
ever heard on land or sea.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the pay-off requires great perseverance
and much preparation and expense, but personally I do not approve
of this method of making a living, as it calls for much deceit.</p>

<p>Now the Tamiami Trail is a road that runs from Miami towards
Tampa and vice versa through the Everglades, and the Everglades is
a big stretch of flat country that makes you feel very lonesome
indeed after the sun goes down. And soon after dusk it comes on to
blow and after a while it is quite a high breeze and, in fact, the
wind is picking up our old can in one place and setting it down in
another yards away and this makes riding in it a trifle bumpy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it begins raining more than somewhat and it is
darker than a yard down a bear's throat except when it lightnings
and I tell Homer it may be a good idea to pull up up and wait until
the storm blows over. Homer says he quite agrees with me and that
in fact he is looking for a gaff he knows of which ought to be
somewhere along about where we are at the moment, and I tell him he
better find it very shortly as it does not look as if the old
rattle-and-jar can hold the road much longer.</p>

<p>Finally we notice some streaks of light through the dark and the
rain off to one side of the road and Homer says this must be the
spot and he turns the car in that direction and we come on a long,
low frame building which I can see seems to be some kind of a jook,
which is a sort of a roadhouse where refreshments are sold and
dancing goes on and I do not know what all else.</p>

<p>Homer runs his old pail as close as possible to the side of the
building where the other cars are parked and we get out and he
locates a door that figures to open outward and we pull on it
together with the wind pushing against us for several minutes
before we can pull it wide enough to ease inside. And there we are
in a long, narrow room with a number of tables scattered around in
it and a small bar and an old piano on one side and with big gas
lamps swinging back and forth from the ceiling as the wind shakes
the building.</p>

<p>There are maybe half a dozen guys in the joint sitting at the
tables and behind the bar is a short, stocky-built female party of
maybe half past thirty-eight, to give her a few hours the best of
it. She is by no means fashionably dressed and, in fact, she has on
a short-sleeved ragged sweater and her brown hair with streaks of
grey in it is flying every which way about her head and she is far
from beautiful. In fact, she is strictly a blouwzola, but when
Homer sees her he seems greatly pleased and he walks up to the bar
and speaks to her as follows:</p>

<p>"Hello, Barbecue," he says. "Big wind outside."</p>

<p>"Big wind inside now," she says. "Well, Homer," she says, "what
line of larceny are you engaged in this season?"</p>

<p>"Look, Barbecue," Homer says, "why do you always speak of
larceny to me when I come to pay you a social call? It hurts my
feelings, especially," he says, "when I am now as honest as the day
is long."</p>

<p>"The days are getting shorter," Ms Barbecue says.</p>

<p>"Homer," she says, "I never ask you to pay me any social calls.
In fact, it seems to me that when you are here a year ago I tell
you to please remain away forever. It is the time you persuade me
to bet forty dollars of my hard-earned funds on some catfish in a
race at Hialeah stating you know something, and it is not in yet.
It is also the time I miss a tenner from my damper after you go,
Homer," she says. "I am always hearing strange things about you
from the cops who come around asking questions whenever you are in
this part of the country, and besides," she says, "you remind me of
gloomy days. But," she says, "I will not turn a dog out on such a
night. Sit down, Homer, and keep quiet and do not try to talk me
into anything," she says.</p>

<p>So we go to a table and sit down and Homer seems very sad and
finally I say to him:</p>

<p>"Homer," I say, "what is the idea of this old komoppo speaking
to you in such a discourteous manner? Who is she and how well do
you know her?"</p>

<p>"I know her well," Homer says. "She is no komoppo. In fact, I
think she is quite handsome if you look at her from a certain
angle. She is once my wife. Her name is Sadie but everybody calls
her Barbecue since she opens this drum because she specializes in
barbecued spareribs, which is a very tasty morsel, indeed. She
divorces me years ago because she claims my way of life is not
substantial. But," Homer says, "I still love her. Every time I see
her I love her more than ever. I hear she does very nicely here,
too. I am always hoping to win her back again, but she seems
somewhat hostile this evening. Can I always pick winners?" Homer
says.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am somewhat surprised to learn that Homer High-C is
ever married and I am more surprised that he seems to be carrying
the torch for such a looking pancake as this Barbecue. Personally I
will just as soon carry one for a crocodile, but, of course, I do
not mention these sentiments to Homer. On the contrary I express my
deepest sympathy for him and about now Homer notices two guys
sitting at a table in a corner away back in the rear of the room
and gives them a hello. It is not a large hello and, in fact, it is
a very small hello and they hello him back just as small and maybe
smaller and Homer lowers his voice to a whisper and says to me like
this:</p>

<p>"The big guy is Dandy Jock McQueen out of St. Louis," he says.
"The little guy is Johnny Aquitania. They're very rapid guys in
every way, shape, manner and form."</p>

<p>"What is their business?" I say.</p>

<p>"They have a pay-off background," Homer says. "Now I can
understand the touch Finnegan the fuzz speaks of because these
parties are connected with a pay-off store which operates out of
Tampa. Yes," Homer says, "it will be a privilege and a pleasure to
me to get a glaum at the contents of the little brown suit-case
under the table there.</p>

<p>"I will almost guarantee it contains the beesom they take off
the marks in West Palm and they are undoubtedly on their way back
to Tampa with it."</p>

<p>I am looking the guys over when there is a noise at the front
door and in comes a guy and a pretty thing and the guy is dragging
what seems to be a big bull-fiddle in a zippered-up canvas case
behind him, a bull-fiddle being a large musical instrument about
six feet long which is sometimes called a bass viol and which is
played with great zest by musicians in orchestras. In fact, I
recognize the guy as a party by the name of Juliano who has an
orchestra of his own in a night trap in Miami where I go
occasionally though I do not know him personally, and I do not
remember him playing a bull-fiddle, either. What I remember him
playing is a clarinet and very hot too.</p>

<p>He is a young guy and the pretty with him is also young and she
is wearing a long raincoat and has a felt hat pulled down to her
eyes but I can see enough of her face to judge that she is quite a
lovely object to behold, if you like blondes, and I like blondes.
They sit down at a table not far from Homer and me and Juliano lays
the bull-fiddle case down on the floor beside him and they both
glance around in a way that causes me to figure that they are
somewhat agitated.</p>

<p>But naturally I also figure their agitation comes of their
experience in the storm outside and I am thinking that they make a
fine-looking young couple together when I happen to observe the
bull-fiddle case more closely and I say to Homer like this:</p>

<p>"Homer," I say, "I think there is something in the bull-fiddle
case that is not a bull-fiddle."</p>

<p>"Why?" Homer says.</p>

<p>"Because," I say, "it is something too limp for a bull-fiddle
and I notice it pulls heavy for a bull-fiddle when the guy drags it
in. Besides," I say, "you do not lay a bull-fiddle flat on the
floor. What you do with a bull-fiddle is to stand it up against the
wall."</p>

<p>Well, at this, Homer takes a good glaum himself at the
bull-fiddle case and finally he says:</p>

<p>"No," he says, "it is not a bull-fiddle in the bull-fiddle case.
It is a body. I see a finger sticking out of a place where the
zipper comes open a little. But," he says, "I cannot tell from the
finger whether it is a male or a female body."</p>

<p>"Homer," I say, "why do you suppose they are carrying a body
around in a bull-fiddle case?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Homer says, "perhaps it is just a hobby. Any way," he
says, "it is a live body because the finger just wiggles."</p>

<p>Well, I can see the finger for myself and sure enough, it is
wiggling though not very much and I have a notion to go over and
ask Juliano and the pretty what is the idea of a body in the
bull-fiddle case, only I am afraid they may think I am inquisitive.
Then Juliano seems to notice that Homer and I are glauming the
bull-fiddle case though he does not seem to observe the finger
himself and in fact by this time the finger disappears from view.
But presently Juliano says something to the pretty and they get up
and go out the front door again, this Juliano dragging the
bull-fiddle case after him.</p>

<p>We can hear their car starting even above the wind but they are
not gone more than five minutes before they are back again but
without the bull-fiddle case and Juliano stops at the bar and
remarks to Barbecue that the breeze is too strong for them to think
of continuing their journey.</p>

<p>They sit down at their table again and Homer whispers to me that
their going out is just a stall to plant the bull-fiddle case in
their car because the chances are our gazing at it makes Juliano
nervous and he also tells me not to stare at them any more as it is
most impolite. So I pay no more attention to them and neither does
Homer and they pay no more attention to us, which makes it even,
but continue talking to each other very earnestly with their heads
close together and finally Homer whispers to me like this:</p>

<p>"I am commencing to be a little curious about the bull-fiddle
case," Homer says. "Follow me," he says, "but," he says, "make it
nonchalant."</p>

<p>Then he gets up but instead of going towards the front he
saunters in the direction of the back end of the room and as I tail
him I can see that Homer is somewhat familiar with these premises.
He leads the way into a kitchen where an old coloured guy with a
bald head is cooking meat on a revolving spit over a charcoal
brazier and producing very savoury odours, indeed, and then on into
a small room opening off the kitchen which I can see is a sort of
store-room. It is full of sacks and boxes and there are vegetables
and other truck hanging from the rafters including a middling sized
dressed pig and Homer points to this pig and says:</p>

<p>"Barbecue personally raises them and butchers them for her
business," he says. "She is really a smart broad," he says. "Do you
wonder I love her?"</p>

<p>Now Homer goes out-a-door of the storeroom into the wind and I
go with him and he moves around the parked cars fumbling in each
one in the dark until he finds what he is looking for, which is the
bull-fiddle case. It is jammed in the back seat of a big limousine
and Homer lifts it out and drags it into the storeroom where he
unzippers the case from top to bottom and what falls out of it but
a little tiny grey-haired guy with a little tiny grey moustache who
is in dinner clothes and whose hands are tied in front of him with
cords.</p>

<p>His feet are also tied and he has a gag in his mouth, and
naturally Homer and I are greatly surprised at this spectacle and
Homer says to the guy like this:</p>

<p>"What is the idea of putting yourself in a bull-fiddle case?" he
says.</p>

<p>But the guy just rolls his eyes and it is plain to be seen that
he cannot speak with the gag in his mouth, so Homer outs with his
pocket knife and cuts all the cords and lifts the guy to his feet
and says:</p>

<p>"Come, come," he says. "Please explain this hiding in a
bull-fiddle case, will you? It is not dignified for a party of your
years."</p>

<p>"They put me in it," the little guy finally says. "My wife
Dimples and Juliano. She hits me over the head with a blunt
instrument when I am not looking and when I regain consciousness I
am tucked in this bull-fiddle case. I have a terrible headache.
They think I am dead and are driving out into the Glades to cast my
remains into a swamp. I hear them discussing the matter when I
revive in the bull-fiddle case. My name is Greebins."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," Homer says. "This sounds most unconstitutional. What
is their idea?"</p>

<p>"Dimples is in love with Juliano," Greebins says. "She wishes to
get rid of me so she can acquire my money and marry Juliano and
live happily ever afterward. Well," he says, "I cannot blame her. I
am nearly three times her age and by no means vivacious, and
Dimples enjoys laughter and music and the rumba."</p>

<p>"Well," Homer says, "now you can step in and confront them and
they will think they are seeing a ghost and after we scare them
half to death we will turn them over to the law, although," he
says, "personally I am opposed to doing the law any favours."</p>

<p>"No," Greebins says. "I will not confront them now. It will he
too great a shock to Dimples. She is a nervous little thing. Let us
consider this situation."</p>

<p>Then he sits down on a box and I suggest to Homer that while we
are doing this considering, Juliano may miss us from the scene
inside and become uneasy and take it into his head to see if his
bull-fiddle case is still where he places it and not finding it, he
and the pretty may fan off and we will have nothing to consider and
Homer says this is undoubtedly true and that we must not waste too
much time.</p>

<p>At this moment, the old coloured guy comes into the storeroom
and removes the dressed pig from its hook on the rafter, probably
with the idea of lugging it into the kitchen and carving it up, but
Homer stops him and takes the pig himself and puts it in the
bull-fiddle case and zippers it up tight. Then Homer goes out into
the wind again dragging the bull-fiddle case and when he returns he
says:</p>

<p>"Now," he says, "we can consider at our leisure. I put the
bull-fiddle case back in their car, pig and all, so if they
investigate they will find everything in order."</p>

<p>"Why," Greebins says, "you are really a genius. You settle the
whole problem. If I confront them now it will not only be a great
shock to Dimples' nervous system but they will flee in dismay and I
may never see her again. But if we let them go on their way and
dispose of this bull-fiddle case in a swamp thinking I am still in
it, they will not know I am still alive until Dimples tries to
collect my money. Then," he says, "when she finds she is unable to
do this while I am alive, she will return to me because Dimples
cannot do without money and Juliano does not have a quarter. Of
course," Greebins says, "it is somewhat humiliating to use a pig as
a stand-in. I will prefer a lamb."</p>

<p>"Greebins," Homer says, "do you mean to state that you will take
her back after all this? Why?"</p>

<p>"I love her," Greebins says.</p>

<p>"Ah," Homer says. "I see your point. Well," he says, "you remain
out of sight in the kitchen until the storm passes and they leave
and we will drive you back to Miami where you can await
developments. That is," Homer says, "if my can is not blown there
already."</p>

<p>So Homer and I go back into the large room and nobody seems to
notice our return any more than they do our departure and it may be
because one and all now have something else to think about, which
is the way the building is shaking in the wind. In fact, everyone
is just sitting still looking somewhat perturbed and there is no
conversation and finally Barbecue speaks up and says like this:</p>

<p>"Listen," Barbecue says, "is this a wake, or what? Homer," she
says, "sing something, will you? I will play for you."</p>

<p>Then she goes over to the old piano and begins playing and what
she plays is Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt, and Homer sings as follows:</p>

<div class="poem2"><i>Oh, don't you remember,<br>
Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt,<br>
Dah dah, de, dah dah,<br>
Dah, de dah."</i>
</div>

<p>"Homer," Barbecue says, "a little less of the dah-de-dah stuff
and more words."</p>

<p>"I do not remember the words," Homer says. "I do not sing this
song in years. Not since I used to sing it to you. Barbecue," he
says, "you know I still love you. What about you and me trying it
again?"</p>

<p>"Homer," she says, "you are not really a bad guy at heart and I
like you, but," she says, "you are loaded with larceny and I fear
you always will be. Come back a year from to-day and if you can
tell me you live 100 per cent. on the square during this period,
there is a chance for you."</p>

<p>Well, all of a sudden there is quite a crash and the roof over
the rear of the room caves in, and it caves in over the spot where
the piano is located, too, and Homer pulls Barbecue off the stool
and out of the way just in time and all of us go to the front part
of the joint where a piece of the roof still holds, including this
Juliano and the pretty who is sobbing and carrying on in such a
manner that I can see she is indeed high-strung. Personally, I
flatten out on the floor and the others soon follow my example and
now there is nothing else to do but to lie there and to hope and
trust that the rest of the gaff does not go.</p>

<p>Finally when daylight comes on, the wind dies down and the sun
shines and we can look around and see what happens and it is
something of a mess, to be sure, though not as bad as you will
expect. The parked cars outside the building seem to be pushed
around no little, but I can see that at least one of them is not
damaged, as I observe Juliano and the pretty departing
lickity-split with the bull-fiddle case bouncing up and down in the
back of the car, they are going so rapidly. And what becomes of
them I do not know and, furthermore, I do not care, as I consider
them most unworthy characters, indeed, though from what I see of
the pretty I judge Greebins calls the turn in figuring her to come
back to him when she discovers the true situation about his
money.</p>

<p>Now I remember that the guys Homer High-C mentions as Dandy Jock
McQueen and Johnny Aquitania never seem to be among us after the
roof caves in, so I go to the spot where they are sitting the last
time I see them and I behold them under a pile of rubbage, lying
quite still, and I tell Homer that I fear these parties are no
more.</p>

<p>"Yes," Homer says, "I know this several hours ago. You do not
notice it, but during the confusion I crawl over there figuring to
help them, only to find I am too late. It is very sad. I also
secure the little brown suit-case while I am about it. Just as I
suspect, it is full of the soft. It is all in neat stacks. I can
tell by feeling around in it in the dark. I have a wonderful sense
of feeling for banknotes. Yes," he says, "it contains plenty of
moo. I am most fortunate."</p>

<p>"Why, Homer," I say, "you do not intend keeping it, do you? It
seems to me," I say, "that there is a law requiring you to turn
this property over to the heirs of the deceased."</p>

<p>"Can this be true?" Homer says. "Well," he says, "such a course
will only lead to legal complications and take a lot of time. I am
going to South America and establish a home and live there honestly
on these funds for a year from date to keep my promise to Barbecue.
Then I will return and we will resume our happiness where we leave
off. Do I tell you she kisses me for yanking her away from the
piano and saving her life? But, come," Homer says, "let us find our
friend Greebins and return to Miami."</p>

<p>Well, as we are making ready to depart Barbecue comes up to
Homer and puts her arms around him and gives him a large hug and
says to him like this:</p>

<p>"Be strong, Homer," she says. "Think of me when you feel
temptation and never do the least little thing out of line,
because," she says, "it may come to my ears and cancel my promise.
Return to me pure and we will finish our lives together in great
happiness. I am going to trust you once more, Homer," she says.</p>

<p>"Barbecue," Homer says, "wild horses will not be able to drag me
from the straight and narrow path from now on, and," he says, "this
even goes for race horses, too."</p>

<p>Then he points the car for Miami and we are off, with Barbecue
and the old coloured guy waving us farewell, and I observe that
tears are running down Homer's cheeks and splashing on the little
brown suit-case which is resting in his lap, so I can see that he
is deeply touched.</p>

<p>So I suggest to Homer that we go to the Sharkskin Grill and have
a few drinks and maybe they will cheer Greebins up too, and Homer
thinks the drinks a good idea even if they do not cheer Greebins
up, and presently we are lined up in front of the Sharkskin Grill
bar having these drinks when who comes in but Finnegan, the fuzz,
and he walks up to Homer and says:</p>

<p>"Hello," he says, "I am very glad to see you again, Homer,
although it seems to me I tell you to take it on the lammeroo out
of here just yesterday. Or am I mistaken?"</p>

<p>"No," Homer says, "you are not mistaken. I go, but I am driven
back by the big storm."</p>

<p>"What big storm?" Finnegan says. "Do you mean the slight squall
over the Glades? Look, Homer," he says, "you must not speak of such
a minor disturbance as a big storm. The chamber of commerce will
disapprove of your statement as a knock to our weather, which is
wonderful at all times. Anyway," he says, "I repeat I am glad to
see you because I now have a definite order for your arrest."</p>

<p>"Copper," Homer says, "I tell you again I am not in the pay-off
department. I have nothing whatever to do with the West Palm
matter. You may arrest me if you choose but I will immediately
summon a lawbooks and sue you for false imprisonment."</p>

<p>"Well, I choose," Finnegan says. "Come with me."</p>

<p>Now at this time Homer is carrying the little brown suit-case
and in fact he never loosens his clutch on it for a minute.</p>

<p>And at this point Greebins, who does not say much more than yes
or no for several hours, steps up to Homer and taps him on the
shoulder and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"Brother," Greebins says, "I am trying to think of where I see
you before ever since I stand out in the kitchen last night and
hear you sing Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt. It just this very instant
comes to me. It is years ago at the Colonial Theatre and you appear
on the stage and sing the same song. You are really terrible both
times, but," he says, "this is neither here nor there. I peg a
vegetable at you from the Colonial audience and score a bull's-eye
under your chin. It is the only unconventional conduct of which I
am ever guilty and I wish now to make you a belated apology."</p>

<p>"Ah," Homer says. "So you are the one! Do you realize," he says,
"that you ruin my whole life? If it is not for your destroying my
musical career with your vegetable I will probably still be married
to Barbecue and partaking of her profits and never come in contact
with such scurvy characters as this copper."</p>

<p>I am greatly surprised to note that Homer High-C appears to be
labouring under strong emotion because he is usually quite calm, no
matter what. In fact, he appears to be losing control of himself
for the moment. Suddenly he swings this little brown suit-case
around his head like Hubbell taking a windup and belts Greebins
over the pimple with it, almost knocking him loose from his little
grey moustache. It is a blow of such great force that it not only
flattens Greebins but it breaks open the suit-case and a number of
fat packages of banknotes spill out over the floor and Finnegan
picks up one of these packages and observes that the band around it
has the name of a Des Moines bank on it.</p>

<p>"Well, well," Finnegan says. "Well, well, well, well. Des
Moines, eh? Iowa, eh? The West Palm swag, eh? Homer," he says, "how
fortunate for me you boff this little old gee with such a weapon as
your suit-case, although, Homer," he says, "it strikes me as most
unsportsmanlike considering the difference in your ages. But if I
do not see this money with my own eyes, I will never suspect you of
being mixed up in the West Palm skulduggery, especially when I know
you are right here in this city when it comes off. I will get
promoted for this, I hope," he says.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Homer says. "What do you mean you will never
suspect me? Do you not just put the arm on me for it? Do you not
just state you have an order for my arrest?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Finnegan says, "the arrest order is for something entirely
different, Homer. I am wondering why you keep beefing about the
pay-off thing when I do not even dream of connecting you with it.
The chief gets a call today from a biscuit by the name of Barbecue
who runs an eating joint out on the Trail and who states that she
can prove by the eye-witness testimony of a coloured party who
works for her that you rob her of a pig. Come on, Homer."</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="LITTLE_PINKS" id="LITTLE_PINKS">20. LITTLE PINKS</a>
</h2>

<p>ONE night in the Canary Club, Case Ables, the bookmaker, slaps a
redheaded chorus Judy who is called Your Highness across the mouth
and knocks her down a flight of stairs and he uses only his bare
hand, at that.</p>

<p>It is agreed by one and all that Case Ables is a little out of
line in this situation as he is a big fat guy who outweighs Your
Highness maybe a hundred and eighty pounds, but it is also agreed
that if some Judy in the city of New York must be knocked down a
flight of stairs it may as well be Your Highness, for she is
without doubt a great pain in the neck.</p>

<p>And, of course, Case Ables is slightly vexed at the moment as he
is just after spending plenty of moolouw in the Canary Club and
when it comes on the closing hour for the drum he wishes to go
somewhere else and have jolly times and he also wishes to take Your
Highness with him for company and so forth, and she refuses to
go.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, if Case Ables only thinks to ask somebody in
advance he will learn that Your Highness always refuses to go out
with anybody for company or anything else, unless she is sure they
are in the high income-tax brackets and of excellent social
position, and naturally the social position lets Case out.</p>

<p>In fact, the reason she is called Your Highness and is
considered such a pain in the neck is because she plays the frost
for all who are not well established as practically zillionaires,
and she makes no bones of stating that her angle is to find a
character of means who is not entirely repulsive and marry him, and
when somebody asks her what about love, she says well, what about
it, and, of course, there is no answer to this.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider Your Highness' attitude slightly
unromantic, especially for a Judy who is only about twenty-two
years old, but many citizens claim that it displays great
intelligence, although they all admit they are glad she can never
have them in mind for her purpose.</p>

<p>In fact, Joe Gloze, the owner of the Canary Club, states that as
far as he is concerned he will just as soon marry a fire plug as
Your Highness as he says he figures a fire plug will not be so cold
and hard in case of a clinch. But, of course, Joe Gloze admits he
is only guessing both ways.</p>

<p>However, no one can deny that Your Highness does very good for
herself by specializing in characters of means. They are always
taking her nice places and she has fine clothes and fur wraps and
other odds and ends such as these characters dearly love to bestow
upon chorus Judys for the asking, and Your Highness is not at all
tongue-tied when it comes to asking.</p>

<p>Furthermore, she has quite a personal following of these
characters and always brings trade to any joint in which she is
working, so she gets a good salary although all she has to do is to
walk around with the rest of the chorus and look beautiful, which
is really no effort at all for Your Highness. In fact, many
citizens say that if she is not the most beautiful Judy that ever
hits Broadway, she is at least in there somewhere scrambling along
close up.</p>

<p>The price is 8 to 5 anywhere along Broadway that Your Highness
will sooner or later marry the United States Mint, or maybe the
Bank of England, and 20 to 1 that she will make either of them sick
of her in two weeks when she winds up in a heap at the foot of the
stairs from Case Ables' slap. I remember she has on a red dress and
what with this and her red hair she reminds me more than somewhat
of a woodpecker that someone knocks out of a tree with a rock.</p>

<p>Well, while she is lying there, a bus boy in the Canary Club by
the name of Little Pinks, who has a very large nose and a short
forehead and who does not weigh more than ninety pounds, apron and
all, runs down the stairs and begins carrying on in a way that is
most distressing to hear, especially to Case Ables, as Little Pinks
keep yelling that Case is a murderer and a no-good and I do not
know what all else.</p>

<p>So naturally Case has to go down the stairs and give Little
Pinks a few good clops on the chops because such talk is
practically vilification of character and by no means pleasing to
Case Ables. But the more clops Little Pinks gets the louder he
yells and as a scene of this nature is by no means beneficial to an
establishment such as the Canary Club, Joe Gloze and two of his
captains of waiters go down and assist Case in the clopping, so
after a while Little Pinks is very well clopped indeed.</p>

<p>It comes out that Little Pinks is a great admirer of Your
Highness, but it is agreed that even so he is going too far in
speaking so freely of Case Ables. In fact, after some discussion it
is the consensus of opinion that a bus boy has no right to admire
anybody and consequently Little Pinks is in great disfavour with
one and all, especially when it comes out that his admiration of
Your Highness is from a distance and that he never more than says
good evening to her in his life and even then she does not answer
unless she feels like it. And of course, everybody who knows Your
Highness knows that she will very seldom feel like answering a
busboy.</p>

<p>It becomes plain to all that Your Highness probably never knows
Little Pinks is alive, yet it seems that whenever she goes to work
in a night club, Little Pinks always gets himself a bussing job
there, just so he can be near her and see her. When this
information is made public it is generally agreed that Little Pinks
is slightly eccentric and furthermore, when Joe Gloze gets to
figuring that if Pinks is so busy admiring Your Highness he must be
neglecting his bussing, he gives Little Pinks a few more clops for
luck.</p>

<p>Well, finally it also comes out that Your Highness' spine is
injured, so she will never walk again and Case Ables feels so sorry
about this that he talks some of paying her hospital expenses, but
Joe Gloze convinces him that it will be setting a bad precedent in
these situations. In fact, Joe Gloze says it may start his chorus
Judys to falling down the stairs of their own free will just to get
in hospitals.</p>

<p>There is also a rumour around that Your Highness has a right to
sue Case Ables for damages, but as Case soon has thirty-four
witnesses, including the cop on the beat, who are willing to swear
she attacks him first and that she is undoubtedly under the
influence of something at the time, nothing comes of this rumour.
In fact, everybody forgets the incident as quickly as possible
except Your Highness and maybe Little Pinks, who is bound to
remember if only because Joe Gloze gives him the heevus from his
job in the Canary Club.</p>

<p>Now all this is some years ago and it comes on a winter when
things are pretty tough for one and all and I judge they must be
especially tough for bus boys as I meet Little Pinks on Broadway
one cold day and he is thinner than an old dime and does not have
enough clothes on to make a bathrobe for a mouse. His toes are
leaking out of his shoes and he is as blue as a toad from the cold
and I stake him to four bits out of the goodness of my heart. Then
I ask him if he ever sees Your Highness and he says to me like
this:</p>

<p>"Sure, I see her," Little Pinks says. "I see her all the time.
In fact, Your Highness lives in the same place I do which is in a
basement over in West Fifty-second Street near Tenth Avenue. I am
the only one who does see her nowadays as all her former friends
give her the brush-off after she is hurt. She is in the hospital
nearly a year and," he says, "she has to sell all her possessions
to pay the expenses. She does not have one penny when I take her to
my place to live."</p>

<p>"How is she now?" I say.</p>

<p>"She is cold," Little Pinks says. "Always so cold. There is not
much heat in our basement and this is one reason why Your Highness
is always slightly irritable. But," he says, "it keeps me so busy
hustling around trying to get a few dibs to keep up the instalments
on the wheel chair I buy her and for food and magazines that I
cannot afford a better place. Your Highness must have her magazines
so she can keep up with what the society people are doing. They
cost quite a lot," he says.</p>

<p>"Are you married to her?" I say.</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness, no," Pinks says. "Do you suppose Your Highness
will marry anybody like me? She is too proud to think of such a
thing. She is just letting me take care of her until she can get
well and marry somebody with a lot of sugar. That is always her
dream," he says. "When she is in good humour she talks about how
she will reward me some day.</p>

<p>"But," Little Pinks says, "she is not often in good humour
lately because she is so cold. She says she wants to go to Miami
where it is warm and where there are society people like she sees
in the magazines. She says she will get a chance to meet guys with
money there. Yes," he says, "I think I will take her to Miami."</p>

<p>"Well, Pinks," I say, "that will be fine, but how are you going
to get her there? It looks to me as if you may be a little short of
what it takes."</p>

<p>"Why," Little Pinks says, "I will push her there in her
wheelchair."</p>

<p>"Pinks," I say, "I guess you are a case for Bellevue. It is
thirteen hundred miles to Miami."</p>

<p>"How far is thirteen hundred miles?" Little Pinks says.</p>

<p>"Pinks," I say, "thirteen hundred miles is thirteen hundred
miles. That is how far it is. You can no more push somebody in a
wheel chair such a distance than you can roll a peanut from here to
Chicago with your nose."</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "I must try because Your Highness cannot stand
the cold much longer. Now I must hurry home to cook the dinner,
and," he says, "to-night is the night I do the washing. Your
Highness does not like to be without clean clothes, especially
lingerie. I am a good cook and launderer now and nobody can dust
and sweep or wait on an invalid better than I can. Your Highness
takes a lot of waiting on," he says. "I used to forget things but
now she keeps a long cane at her chair to remind me when I
forget."</p>

<p>"Pinks," I say, "everybody knows his own business best, but what
is the idea of your working and slaving for a cold, selfish little
broad such as Your Highness if you are not married to her and are
not even going to get married to her? What is your percentage?" I
say.</p>

<p>"Why," Little Pinks says, "I love her."</p>

<p>And with this he goes on down the street and I can see that he
shrinks a lot since I last see him and in fact he is now so small
that I look for him to fall out of the hole in the seat of his
pants any minute.</p>

<p>Well, it comes on the winter of 1938 and I am in Chesty Charles'
little grill on Biscayne Boulevard in the city of Miami thinking of
very little when I notice that the character who is doing porter
work around the joint seems to be nobody but Little Pinks, although
he is without doubt greatly altered. So I ask Chesty if this is not
who the porter is and Chesty says to me like this:</p>

<p>"All I know," Chesty says, "is that he is a little stirry. He
comes to me with a screeve from some old friends of mine in the
canneroo at Raiford. He is just after doing a three er and it seems
to leave some impression on him. He talks to himself a lot. Yes,"
Chesty says, "he is without doubt stirr-crazy."</p>

<p>After a while, when the porter does not seem to have anything on
his hands, I walk over to him and slap him on the back and speak to
him as follows:</p>

<p>"Hello, Pinks," I say. "How is everything?"</p>

<p>He turns around and looks at me a minute and I can see that it
is Little Pinks all right and then he says:</p>

<p>"Oh, hello."</p>

<p>"Do you remember me?" I say.</p>

<p>"Sure," Little Pinks says. "You give me four bits on Broadway
one day. It is a cold day."</p>

<p>"How is Your Highness?" I say.</p>

<p>At this, Little Pinks puts his fingers on his lips, and says
shush and then he takes me by the arm and leads me out the back
door of the grill into a sort of area-way where they keep the
garbage cans and he motions me to sit down on one can and he sits
on the other and says like this:</p>

<p>"It is now over four years ago," he says, "since I bring Your
Highness down here."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Pinks," I say. "You state you bring her. How do
you bring her?"</p>

<p>"I push her in her wheel chair," he says.</p>

<p>"You push her in her wheel chair thirteen hundred miles?" I say.
"Pinks, do you think you are kidding somebody?"</p>

<p>"Wait till I tell the story," he says. "It is thirteen hundred
miles. It does not seem like a block to me now. But let me tell it
all."</p>

<p>It is not so difficult as it may sound to push a wheel chair
from New York City to Miami (Little Pinks says) with such a tiny
thing as Your Highness in the chair as by the time we start she
does not weigh much more than a bag of popcorn and besides it is a
very nice wheel chair with rubber tyres and ball-bearing wheels and
rolls very easy, to be sure.</p>

<p>In fact, the only tough part of the journey is from the basement
in West Fifty-second Street to the ferry that takes us across the
river to the Jersey side. After that we thumb our way along, with
Your Highness doing the thumbing, and we get many a lift in empty
trucks, although the drivers are generally greatly surprised,
indeed, at the spectacle of a Judy in a wheel chair asking for a
ride.</p>

<p>But it is seldom an empty comes along without stopping for us
and usually the driver has to get out and help lift Your Highness,
chair and all, into the truck and block the wheels so the chair
will not roll out on the bumps and sometimes Your Highness is so
bossy about the job that she gets the drivers to asking her who she
thinks she is.</p>

<p>She likes the open trucks best and often passes up closed vans
that offer a lift to wait for one without a top so she can sit in
her chair and watch the scenery on all sides and pretend she is
somebody big like a queen. When she is in one of those open trucks
she nearly always pretends she is Cleopatra in her royal barge
scooting along the Nile which is an idea she gets from some movie
and while I do not mind her pretending to be Cleopatra or anybody
else I can see that her conversation often makes the truck drivers
very nervous.</p>

<p>Once in the state of South Carolina when I am pushing the chair
along a road we are stopped by an automobile containing three
characters who are very hard-looking indeed, and one of these
characters outs with a large Betsy and requests us to hold up our
hands. Then one of the others fans me to see if I have any funds or
valuables, and the third character looks Your Highness over and
they are surprised and slightly annoyed to find only eighty-six
cents on us all told.</p>

<p>So they start questioning us and when I tell them all about Your
Highness and me, they are more surprised than ever and one of them
picks Your Highness up out of her wheel chair and puts her in the
automobile. They make me get in after her and then they tie a rope
to the wheel chair and tow it quite a distance behind the
automobile, travelling very slow, so as not to yank the chair
around too much.</p>

<p>They let us go at a cross-roads where they say they must branch
off to get to a town off the main highway where they wish to rob a
bank and, furthermore, they give me a pound note for my pocket and
one of them who listens to Your Highness more than anyone else says
that what I really deserve is a gold medal although he does not
state why.</p>

<p>Another time in Georgia, I somehow lose the highway and hit a
road that goes nowhere but into a swamp and the next thing we know
we are in the midst of a bunch of five stove lids in striped
clothes and it turns out that they are escaped convicts and are
very desperate guys.</p>

<p>Personally, I figure we are going to have a lot of trouble with
these parties, but right away, Your Highness puts them to work
fixing up a camp for us for the night and ordering them around
until one of them tells me he will be glad to return to the prison
and give himself up, especially as every time one of the stove lids
gets close enough to Your Highness' chair she reaches out and gives
him a good belt with her cane.</p>

<p>It takes us about two weeks to get to Miami between her thumbing
and my pushing and we live very good on the way. Sometimes I mooch
a dookey at a kitchen door but Your Highness does not care much for
Southern cooking and prefers canned goods such as I am able to
obtain by climbing in the windows of country stores at night. Once
I enter a henroost and sneeze a pullet when Your Highness thinks
she feels in a mood for a little chicken à la king, but the pullet
turns out to be very tough, and Your Highness is most critical,
indeed.</p>

<p>However, she cheers up no little and quite some when she feels
the sun and sees the ocean in Miami. In fact, she is so cheerful
that she forgets to remind me of anything with her cane for one
whole day and has only a few cross words for me. The first thing I
do is to find a room for her in a small rooming house on Miami
Beach and the next thing I do is get myself a job bussing in a
restaurant not far from the rooming house.</p>

<p>Then every morning, before I go to work, I push her in her wheel
chair over to a big hotel on the beach that is called the Roney
Plaza and she sits there on the sidewalk all day long watching the
people walking up and down and here and there and to and fro and,
the chances are, trying to flirt with any guy that she figures has
as much as nine dollars in his pockets, for Your Highness never for
a minute forgets her dream of marrying someone with money and
social position, but, anyway, money.</p>

<p>Well, to tell the truth, Your Highness is now not as beautiful
as formerly, though I never before admit it to anybody. In fact,
she is so thin she is almost a shadow and her face is drawn down to
the size of a nickel and there is no more glint of her hair and she
is by no means such a looking Judy as will attract the attention of
guys, especially as the shape that once draws them her way in herds
is no longer on public view.</p>

<p>But Your Highness does not realize the change in her appearance
and when she finds that the only ones who smile at her and stop and
talk to her as she is sitting there are kindhearted old Judys, and
that guys never rap to her at all, she becomes somewhat impatient
and one day she speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>"Pinks," she says, "I know what is wrong. I do not have any
jewellery. I notice that anybody who has a lot of jewellery on
always attracts plenty of attention even if they are as ugly as
anything. Pinks, you get me a lot of jewellery," she says.</p>

<p>"Well, Your Highness," I say, "this is quite an order to be
sure. I do not know how I am going to get you any jewellery. I am
wondering right now about the room rent."</p>

<p>"Oh," she says, "you can get it. You get those groceries and
that chicken when you want them. Pinks, I must have a lot of
jewellery. I must, I must, I must."</p>

<p>Then she gets mad at me and the way Your Highness gets mad at me
is to never say a word but just sit looking sad and it almost
breaks my heart when she does this. In fact, I can scarcely sleep
when she is mad at me, so instead of trying I spend the next few
nights looking around a little and casing a few big houses in which
I figure there is bound to be plenty of jewellery.</p>

<p>One night I enter one of these houses by way of a loose window
and make my way very quietly to a bedroom in which I can see
somebody is sleeping and there on a bureau in plain sight is a
whole hatful of jewellery. In fact, there is a big square-cut
diamond ring, and a batch of diamond bracelets and a large diamond
clip, so I figure that the party sleeping in the bedroom is some
Judy and that she wears this jewellery earlier in the evening and
is careless enough not to put it away in a safe place when she is
going to bed.</p>

<p>Anyway, I remove the jewellery and present it the next morning
to Your Highness and she is quite pleased with it, although she
states that the square-cut diamond is not of first-class colour and
that the mountings of the bracelets are old-fashioned and cheap.
However, she says they will do very well and she puts all the
jewellery on and sits looking at herself in a mirror for half an
hour. She never asks me where I get it or how. One thing about Your
Highness, she never wishes to know where anybody gets anything or
how as long as she gets it herself.</p>

<p>I push her in her chair over to the Roney as usual and when I go
for her late in the afternoon she is smiling and happy and says
that just as she figures the jewellery attracts plenty of attention
to her, although she admits she does not get much of a tumble from
any young guys who look as if they may be worth getting a tumble
from.</p>

<p>"But," Your Highness says, "they will come later. This afternoon
a very fine-looking old party who says he is Dr. Quincey, of
Chicago, and his wife talk to me an hour. She is old, too, but
nice. Pinks, I think they are rich and maybe they will introduce me
to people. Maybe they have a son. They are much interested in my
new jewellery."</p>

<p>Well, about an hour later I can understand this interest because
a gendarme comes around to the rooming house and calls me out and
tells me I am under arrest charged with the burglary of the home of
Dr. Quincey, of Chicago, of sixty thousand dollars' worth of swag,
and while I am naturally somewhat perturbed by this announcement, I
can see that what Your Highness knows about the value of jewellery
is not much.</p>

<p>The gendarme takes me to the police station and into a room
where several other coppers are waiting and also an old guy with a
beard that they tell me is this Dr. Quincey and I am quite
surprised to see him smile at me and to observe that he does not
seem to be anywhere near as indignant as I will be myself upon
beholding a guy who knocks me off for my valuables.</p>

<p>In fact, it is Dr. Quincey who starts questioning me instead of
the cops and what he questions me most about is Your Highness and
finally I tell him the whole story about us from start to finish
including the part about where I finally enter his house and remove
the jewellery and when I speak of this the cops are all in favour
of immediately placing me in the gaolhouse without any more
dickering, and then sending out and arresting Your Highness, too,
and recovering the jewellery.</p>

<p>"One moment, gentlemen," this Dr. Quincey says. "I have a long
talk with the girl to-day and observe her closely. She is extremely
ill. There is no doubt of that. She is not only extremely ill but,"
he says, "she has strange delusions of grandeur."</p>

<p>"Is that bad, Doc?" I say.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he says. "I am not willing to condone this young
fellow's crime, but let us suspend action on him temporarily. Say
nothing to the girl and let her keep on wearing the jewellery a
while longer under surveillance and let Pinks remain at liberty in
the meantime if he promises to give himself up when you send for
him and accept punishment afterward."</p>

<p>"What do you mean afterward?" I say.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he says. "We will let you know later. Do you
agree?"</p>

<p>Well, naturally I am glad to agree to anything whatever if it is
going to keep me out of the pokey but the coppers are by no means
so eager. They say I have all the earmarks of a guy who will breeze
off out of their reach as soon as they take their hands off me, but
the old guy has them send me out of the room and has a long talk
with them in private and then they tell me I can go until they want
me.</p>

<p>Of course I do not tell Your Highness what comes off and she
goes on wearing the jewellery every day and taking great pleasure
in same but I notice that one of the coppers I see in the room is
always around somewhere close in plain clothes, so I judge they are
taking no chances on the jewellery evaporating.</p>

<p>In fact, sometimes the copper talks to Your Highness and as he
is a young guy and by no means bad-looking, and is always hanging
around, she commences to figure that maybe he has a crush on her
and she plays plenty of swell for him.</p>

<p>When I come to get her when he is around, she gives me a large
bawling out for this and that and lets on that I am just a guy
working for her, although of course he knows very well who I am.
Then the copper happens to let it out that he is married and after
that he cannot get close enough to her to hand her a
grapefruit.</p>

<p>Your Highness tells me that Dr. Quincey and his wife are around
to see her often and she says that sometimes she thinks that maybe
the old Doctor likes her pretty well himself. In fact, she says she
thinks Dr. Quincey has plenty of gall to look at her the way he
does right in front of his wife and I say maybe he is only admiring
her jewellery.</p>

<p>Now for several days Your Highness is very thoughtful and has
little to say and it seems to me that she is getting so she is not
much more than a shadow in her chair. Her eyes are as big as dinner
plates and once I think she is crying which is a great surprise to
me as I never before see her shed a tear. Then one afternoon I go
to the Roney Plaza to get her and I find her watching the sunset
instead of the people and after a while she looks at me and smiles
and says:</p>

<p>"Come close to me, Little Pinks."</p>

<p>It is one of the few times she ever calls me Little Pinks.
Generally it is just Pinks and it is not often she smiles at me,
either. So I go up to the side of her chair but only figuring that
the chances are she wishes to get me close enough to give me a belt
with her cane for something I forget to remember and she says:</p>

<p>"Kneel down, Little Pinks."</p>

<p>Well, of course, this is an unusual request, especially in such
a place, but if there is one thing I am accustomed to from Your
Highness it is unusual requests, so I kneel down in front of her
chair and she reaches out with her cane but instead of belting me
she taps me on the shoulder with it and says:</p>

<p>"Rise up, Sir Little Pinks, my brave and true knight. Rise up
and may God bless you forever and always."</p>

<p>Naturally I figure this is something else Your Highness gets
from a movie or maybe out of a book and I am wondering what the
idea is when I see that there are real tears running down her
cheeks and she holds out her thin arms to me and says:</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Little Pinks."</p>

<p>So I kiss her for the first and only time in my life and she
holds me tight to her breast a moment and slowly whispers:</p>

<p>"Little Pinks, I love you."</p>

<p>Now I feel her arms loosen and her poor little body slips down
farther in the chair and I do not need Dr. Quincey who happens
along just then to tell me Your Highness is dead. He says she lasts
longer than he expects from the first time he ever sees her.</p>

<p>I get her buried out here in a little cemetery in the sun where
she will never be cold again and then I go to the police station
and give myself up and cop a plea of guilty to robbery and take two
to ten years. I am now out on parole (Little Pinks says) and this
is all there is to the story.</p>

<p>"Pinks," I say, "I am indeed very sorry for you."</p>

<p>"Sorry for me?" Little Pinks says. "Say," he says, "I am sorry
for you. You never kiss Your Highness and hear her say she loves
you."</p>

<p>Well, it is a couple of weeks before I am in Chesty's drum again
and I do not see Little Pinks around, so I ask Chesty what becomes
of his porter and Chesty says to me like this:</p>

<p>"Why," he says, "they pick him up again for violating his parole
and send him back to Raiford. I do not know how or why he violates
it because I never think to ask, but," he says, "that guy is better
off there because he surely is off his nut."</p>

<p>So I call up a guy I know by the name of Smiddy who works in the
sheriff's office and ask him if he can remember anything about a
character by the name of something that sounds like Pinks.</p>

<p>"Wait until I look in the record," Smiddy says. "Pinks, Pinks,
Pinks," he keeps saying, so I figure he is going through a book.
"Say," he says, "here is a guy by the name of Pincus who is grabbed
for parole violation. Maybe he is your guy. I remember him now
myself. It is a most unusual case."</p>

<p>"What is most unusual about it?" I say.</p>

<p>"Why," Smiddy says, "this Pincus makes his way into the hotel
room of a winter tourist by the name of Ables and for no reason
anybody can figure out he ties Ables to his bed at the point of a
Betsy and bangs him across the back with a baseball bat until he
permanently injures the poor guy's spine. Do you know what I
think?" Smiddy says.</p>

<p>"No," I say, "what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think this Pincus is daffy," Smiddy says. "But," he says, "of
course we cannot have our winter tourists treated like Mr.
Ables."</p>

<h2><a name="PALM_BEACH_SANTA_CLAUS" id=
"PALM_BEACH_SANTA_CLAUS">21. PALM BEACH SANTA CLAUS</a>
</h2>

<p>IT is the afternoon of a hot day in the city of West Palm Beach,
Florida, and a guy by the name of Fatso Zimpf is standing on a
street corner thinking of very little and throwing so much shade
that a couple of small stove lids are sitting on the kerb at his
feet keeping cool, for this Fatso weighs three hundred pounds if he
weighs a carat and as he is only about three feet eight inches tall
he is really quite a tub of blubber and casts a very wide
shadow.</p>

<p>At that, he is somewhat undernourished at this time and in fact
is maybe fifteen or twenty pounds underweight as he does not
partake of food for two days, and if the small stove lids know how
hungry he is the chances are they will not be sitting so close to
him. To tell the truth, Fatso is so hungry that his stomach is
wondering if his throat is on a vacation and what is more he does
not have as much as one thin dime in his pants pockets to relieve
his predicament.</p>

<p>This Fatso is a horse player by trade and he is en route to
Miami to participate in the winter meetings at Tropical Park and
Hialeah, and he leaves New York City with just enough money to get
him as far as West Palm Beach by bus, but with nothing over for
food and drink on the journey. However, he does not regret having
to leave the bus at West Palm Beach as his strength is slowly
dwindling from hunger and he figures he may be able to get
something to eat there.</p>

<p>Besides, the bus people are talking of charging him excess fare
because it seems that Fatso laps over on both sides in one seat so
much that they claim it is just the same as if he has three seats,
and other passengers are complaining and the journey is by no means
a pleasure trip for Fatso.</p>

<p>Well, while Fatso is standing there on the corner all of a
sudden a big red roadster pulls up in the street in front of him
with a good-looking tanned young guy in a sport shirt driving it
and a skinny Judy sitting in the seat next to him and the skinny
Judy motions for Fatso to come out to the car.</p>

<p>At first Fatso does not pay any attention to her because he does
not wish to move around and take his shade away from the small
stove lids, as he can see that they are very comfortable, and when
it comes to children no kinder-hearted guy than Fatso ever lives no
matter if they are slightly coloured children. In fact, Fatso is
enduring no little suffering from the heat, standing there just
because he is too kindhearted to move.</p>

<p>The skinny Judy in the roadster keeps motioning to him and then
she cries "Hey, you!" in a loud tone so finally Fatso goes out in
the street to the car figuring that maybe she wishes to ask him the
way to some place although of course Fatso does not know the way to
any place in these parts, and he can see that she is not a
bad-looking Judy, though not young, and that she has yellow hair
tied back with a fancy handkerchief and a blue sweater and blue
slacks and a lot of bracelets on her arms and rings on her
fingers.</p>

<p>Fatso can see that this is a party who must be in the money and
he can also see that she has hard blue eyes and a bossy way about
her because as he goes up to the side of the car with the small
stove lids following in his shade she speaks to him in a voice that
seems to scratch on her tonsils coming up, as follows:</p>

<p>"Look here," she says, "are you out of a job?"</p>

<p>Now this Fatso is always very courteous to all female characters
even when he can see that they are nothing but mountain lions and
he bows and says:</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "not to give you a short answer, ma'am, but who
wants to know?"</p>

<p>"I do," the skinny Judy says. "I am Mrs. Manwaring Mimm."</p>

<p>"I am Elmore Zimpf," Fatso says, though up to this time he never
before mentions his first name in public for fear of arousing
criticism.</p>

<p>"Never mind who you are," Mrs. Mimm says. "Do you want a job or
are you on relief?"</p>

<p>Naturally, Fatso does not want a job, for jobs are what he is
keeping away from all his life and furthermore he does not care for
Mrs. Mimm's manner and he is about to back away from this situation
when he gets to thinking how hungry he is. So he asks her what kind
of a job she is thinking of and she says to him like this:</p>

<p>"I want you for my Santa Claus," she says. "I am giving my
annual Christmas Eve party at my place in Palm Beach to-morrow
night and as soon as I see you I say to the count here that you are
the very one for my Santa Claus. My Santa Claus suit will just fit
you," she says. "We always have to stuff it up with pillows for my
butler Sparks and he never looks natural."</p>

<p>At this Fatso remembers that Christmas is indeed close at hand
and naturally this makes him think of Mindy's restaurant on
Broadway and the way they cook turkey there with dressing and
cranberry sauce and with mashed potatoes and turnips or maybe baked
squash to come along and thinking of these matters causes him to
sigh heavily and to forget where he is for the moment until he is
aroused by hearing the young guy driving the car speak as
follows:</p>

<p>"This fat bum is dead from the neck up, Margaret," he says. "You
better find someone else."</p>

<p>"No," she says, "I must have this one. Why, Gregorio, he will be
a sensational Santa Claus. See here," she says to Fatso, "I will
give you fifty dollars."</p>

<p>Well, on hearing the young guy speak of him as a fat bum,
Fatso's thoughts return to West Palm Beach at once and he takes a
good look at the young guy and he can now see that he has a piece
of a moustache on his upper lip and that there is something about
him that is quite familiar.</p>

<p>However, Fatso cannot place him as anybody he knows so he
figures it is just the type that makes him seem familiar because of
course there are thousands of good-looking tanned young guys with
pieces of moustaches on their upper lips running around Florida at
this season of the year, but he is greatly displeased with this
particular young guy for calling him a fat bum.</p>

<p>In fact, Fatso is insulted because while he does not mind being
called fat or even a bum he does not care to be called both at the
same time because it sounds unrefined. He is figuring that maybe it
will be an excellent idea to reach over and tag this young guy one
on the chops, when he remembers hearing Mrs. Mimm mention fifty
dollars.</p>

<p>So he takes this matter up with her to make certain his ears do
not deceive him and sure enough she is willing to give him half a C
to be her Santa Claus with two boffoes in advance so he can get
across Lake Worth to an address she gives him without walking,
provided he will proceed there at once, and Fatso accepts these
terms and dismisses the small stove lids from his shade with a
nickel apiece and the chances are they figure he is Santa Claus
already.</p>

<p>Now this is how Fatso Zimpf comes to be at Pink Waters which is
the name of Mrs. Manwaring Mimm's estate in Palm Beach and this
estate is about the size of Central Park and faces on the ocean and
has many palm trees and fountains and statuary and a swimming pool
and a house that reminds Fatso of Rockefeller Centre, and with
enough servants running around to form a union.</p>

<p>Fatso reports to the butler Sparks and it turns out that this
Sparks is very glad to see him when he learns that Fatso is to be
Santa Claus because it seems that Sparks always considers it most
undignified for a high-class butler to go around being Santa Claus
with pillows stuffed down his pants.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it turns out that Sparks is a horse player at heart
and when he finds that Fatso is familiar with the gee-gees he
becomes very friendly to be sure and supplies him with plenty of
information and scandal about one and all in the best circles of
Palm Beach and several surrounding spots.</p>

<p>He explains to Fatso that Pink Waters is one of the biggest
estates in these parts and that Mrs. Manwaring Mimm is richer than
six feet down in Iowa, with money that she gets off her papa, who
makes it out of the oil dodge years back, and that she marries any
time she feels like it and that she feels like it three times so
far and is now feeling like it again. In fact, Sparks tells Fatso
that she is now feeling like marrying a young guy by the name of
Johnny Relf who also has plenty of dough or will have when his
parents kindly pass away.</p>

<p>Sparks says that personally he does not approve of this marriage
because there is a slight disparity in age between the parties
concerned. He says Johnny is only in his middle twenties and not
too bright for his years, at that, while Mrs. Mimm is two
face-liftings old that he knows of, but he says she is such a
determined character that he does not think it advisable for him to
mention his disapproval of her plan.</p>

<p>Then Fatso remembers the young guy in the roadster with Mrs.
Mimm and he asks Sparks is this the party she is going to marry and
Sparks says:</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he says. "That is Count Gregorio Ferrone of an old
Italian noble family. Mrs. Mimm meets him in New York last summer
and brings him here to Pink Waters as a house guest. I understand,"
Sparks says, "that he is about to contract a marriage that will be
most advantageous to him. I do not think," he says, "that the count
is in funds to any extent."</p>

<p>"He is very impolite," Fatso says. "He does not talk much like a
foreigner to me. He calls me a fat bum without any accent.
Personally," Fatso says, "I mark him N.G."</p>

<p>"Well," Sparks says, "to tell you the truth I second the motion.
The count is indeed a little brusque at times, especially," he
says, "with the servants. He claims he lives in this country off
and on for years so perhaps he loses his accent. Mrs. Mimm does not
really seem to know much about him."</p>

<p>Then Sparks tells Fatso that he is not expected to do anything
at all until it comes time for him to be Santa Claus the next night
so Fatso wanders around and about and admires the sights and scenes
of Palm Beach and finally he strolls along the ocean sands and
there in a lonely spot what does he behold but a beautiful young
Judy of maybe eighteen crying as if her heart will break.</p>

<p>Now if there is one thing Fatso cannot stand it is the sight of
a female character in distress, so he steps up to her and taps her
on the shoulder and says to her like this:</p>

<p>"Little miss," he says, "are you in trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," she says: "who are you?"</p>

<p>"Why," Fatso says, "I am Santa Claus."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she says. "There is no Santa Claus. I know it better
now than anybody else in this world. Anyway," she says, "if you are
Santa Claus where are your whiskers?"</p>

<p>Then Fatso explains about how he is to be Santa Claus for Mrs.
Mimm the next night and as soon as he mentions Mrs. Mimm's name the
beautiful young Judy starts crying harder than ever.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mimm is the whole trouble," she says. "Mrs. Mimm steals my
Johnny away from me and now I must marry Count Gregorio. I hate him
even if he is a count. Mrs. Mimm is an old thing and I want my
Johnny."</p>

<p>She continues her crying and Fatso stands there putting two and
two together and he can see that he comes upon another angle of the
situation that Sparks the butler describes to him.</p>

<p>"Tut-tut," he says. "They tell me Johnny is a light-weight. Dry
your tears and think no more of the matter."</p>

<p>Well, at this she stops crying and gazes at Fatso who observes
that her eyes are a soft brown and he also observes that she has a
shape that is worthy of mention, for Fatso is very observing even
if he is fat, and finally she says:</p>

<p>"Of course Johnny is a lightweight," she says. "Everybody knows
that. In fact," she says, "everybody knows he is a complete nitwit,
but," she says, "what difference does that make? I love him. He is
awfully good-looking and lots of fun. I love him a zillion dollars'
worth. If you are Santa Claus," she says, "you give me my Johnny
for my Christmas present instead of the speedboat my papa is
getting me. I want my Johnny. I hope Mrs. Mimm drops dead."</p>

<p>Now there are more tears and Fatso keeps patting her on the
shoulder and saying now, now, now, and there, there, there, and
finally she quiets down and he is able to get a better idea of her
story. It is a simple love story such as Fatso often hears before,
because a fat guy is always hearing love stories though he never
has any to tell himself.</p>

<p>It seems that she and this Johnny have a big quarrel one night
in New York because she wishes to go to the Stork Club and he
wishes to go to El Morocco and harsh words are exchanged and they
part in bitter anger and the next thing she knows he is in Palm
Beach and Mrs. Mimm is taking dead aim at him and then this Count
Gregorio Ferrone comes along and her papa and mamma decide that it
will be a great idea for her to marry him and give them an excuse
to have a villa in Italy.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that she agrees to do same while she is still
sored up at Johnny but when her papa and mamma take her to their
own home in Palm Beach for the winter and she learns the situation
between Johnny and Mrs. Mimm is quite serious, she regrets her
decision and spends all her time wandering along the sands by
herself.</p>

<p>In fact, she says if Fatso does not happen along this particular
day the chances are her remainders will now be floating out to sea,
because she learns from a jeweller on Worth Avenue that Johnny just
buys a square-cut diamond ring the size of a bath rug and that she
knows it must be Mrs. Mimm's Christmas present and to tell the
truth she hears that Mrs. Mimm picks it out herself and tips the
jeweller off to promote Johnny into buying this ring. Furthermore,
she hears that Mrs. Mimm is going to announce her engagement to
Johnny at the Christmas party.</p>

<p>"And," she says, "I will have to be there to hear it because
Count Gregorio is her house guest and my papa and mamma are going
and it will be considered very peculiar if I fail to be present.
Anyway," she says, "I will hate to have anyone know I am so
downcast about Johnny and why I am telling you I cannot think
except you are fat and have a kind face."</p>

<p>By this time Fatso is becoming somewhat impatient with tears, so
he changes the subject and asks her who she is and she says her
name is Betty Lou Marvel and that her papa is nobody but Junius X.
Marvel, the big automobile guy.</p>

<p>She says everybody in Palm Beach is afraid of Mrs. Mimm because
she can think up very strange things to say about anybody she does
not like and that nobody dare stay away from her parties if they
are invited, especially her Christmas party. Betty Lou says it is
years since anybody has a private Christmas in Palm Beach because
Mrs. Mimm makes them bring all their presents to her party and has
them given away there by her own Santa Claus and Betty Lou says she
is glad they cannot take her speedboat there, and so is Fatso when
he comes to think it over.</p>

<p>"Well, little Miss," Fatso finally says, "kindly give Count
Gregorio no more thought. I am personally giving him much
consideration ever since he calls me a fat bum and I will take care
of him. But," he says, "I do not see what I can do about your
Johnny and Mrs. Mimm and if he is such a numskull as to prefer her
to you maybe you are better off without him. Merry Christmas,
little miss," he says.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, Santa Claus," Betty Lou says, and then Fatso
goes on strolling along the sands wishing he is younger and two
hundred pounds lighter.</p>

<p>Well, it comes on Christmas Eve and Pink Waters is all lighted
up like Palisades Park with a Christmas tree as tall as a church
steeple in the middle of the patio and all the fountains going with
coloured lights squirting on the water and two orchestras playing
one after the other and long tables spread out in the open. In
fact, it is as beautiful a scene as anybody could wish to see and
very Christmasy-looking except it is quite hot.</p>

<p>When the guests are assembling, Fatso is taken in his Santa
Claus suit into the library of the house which opens out into the
patio by Sparks the butler and given a little final coaching
there.</p>

<p>It seems that the first part of the party is for the neighbours'
children and the second part is for the grown-ups, male and female,
and on the Christmas tree in the patio and stacked up at the foot
of the tree are many packages containing the presents for the
little ones and Sparks explains that it is the duty of Fatso as
Santa Claus to distribute these packages.</p>

<p>On a table in the library is a pile of small packages and Sparks
says that after he distributes the packages to the children in the
patio, Fatso is to return to the library and put these small
packages in his Santa Claus bag and go out and stand under the tree
again and take the small packages out of the bag one by one and
call off the names written on them and hand them out to the parties
they are meant for.</p>

<p>"You will be very careful with these small packages," Sparks
says. "They contain presents from husbands to their ever-loving
wives and vice versa and from one sweet pea to another, and so
forth and so on. The chances are there are many valuable gewgaws in
these packages," he says.</p>

<p>Then Sparks leaves Fatso alone in the library while he goes out
to see if everything is ready for the appearance of Santa Claus and
Fatso can observe him through the tall French window that opens on
the patio, bustling about through the gay scene, and with nothing
else to do until Sparks' return, Fatso takes to examining the small
packages and thinking to himself that if he has the money the
contents represent the chances are he will be able to retire from
horse playing and perhaps find some beautiful young Judy like Betty
Lou to love him.</p>

<p>He observes Betty Lou in the patio with the young guy that he
now knows as Count Gregorio and he can see that she seems somewhat
depressed and then he notices Mrs. Mimm with a tall blonde young
guy at her heels that he figures must be the Johnny Relf that Betty
Lou is crying about and Fatso thinks to himself that from his looks
this Johnny must indeed be something of a waste ball.</p>

<p>Finally Sparks returns and says everything is all set and out
into the patio goes Fatso jingling a lot of sleigh bells and
beaming on one and all and the orchestras play and the little
children let out shrill cries of joy. There is no doubt but what
Fatso is a wonderful success as Santa Claus with the little
children and many of them wish to shake hands with him but after an
hour of standing under the tree picking up packages and calling off
names, Fatso commences to get a little weary.</p>

<p>Moreover, he commences to get a trifle vexed with the little
ones, especially when some of them insist on pulling his whiskers
and small boys start kicking him on the ankles to see if he is
alive and by and by Fatso is thinking that maybe President
Roosevelt is right about the redistribution of wealth.</p>

<p>In fact, Fatso finally becomes so vexed that he takes to quietly
stepping on a few little toesies here and there accidentally on
purpose and the childish cries of pain are enough to break
anybody's heart and probably many of these children stop believing
in Santa Claus.</p>

<p>Well, he finally gets rid of all the little children and they
are taken away by their nurses and only the grown-ups are left and
it is a gay gathering to be sure with one and all in evening dress
and drinking champagne and dancing, and Fatso retires to the
library again and when Sparks comes in to help him load up with the
small packages, Fatso says to him like this:</p>

<p>"Sparksy," he says, "who is the most jealous married guy present
at this party?"</p>

<p>"Why," Sparks says, "that is an easy one. The most jealous
married guy at this party or anywhere else in the world is
undoubtedly old Joel Brokebaugh. He is an old walrus who is married
to a young mouse, and," Sparks says, "he thinks that every guy who
says good morning to Mrs. Brokebaugh is after her, although," he
says, "this idea will make you laugh yourself sick when you see
her.</p>

<p>"She is undoubtedly a very low score for looks," Sparks says.
"Furthermore," he says, "she has no more spirit than a gooseberry.
Old Brokebaugh is so stingy he will not let her buy a new hat or a
new dress more than once every few years although he has millions.
He does not wish her to dress up for fear some guy may notice her.
Personally," Sparks says, "I think old Brokebaugh is touched in the
wind for figuring anybody else will ever want his wife, but he has
a violent temper and often causes scenes and some say he even
carries a pistol in his pocket at all times."</p>

<p>"Brokebaugh, eh?" Fatso says.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sparks says. "They are sitting together under the coconut
palm by the big fountain, though why they come to a Christmas party
nobody knows because they never give each other anything in the way
of presents and take no part in the festivities. Everybody feels
sorry for Mrs. Brokebaugh, but," Sparks says, "I say what she needs
is some spunk."</p>

<p>Well, Fatso again goes out into the patio with his bag full of
the small packages and by this time what with the champagne and the
dancing and the spirit of the occasion and all this and that,
everybody is in a lively mood and they give Fatso a big cheer and
no one is any gayer than Mrs. Mimm.</p>

<p>In fact, she is practically hilarious and she gives Fatso a
large smile as he goes past her and he can see that she is pleased
with his efforts and he can also see that she still has this Johnny
with her and that Johnny looks no brighter than before, if as
bright, and then Fatso spots the couple Sparks speaks of under the
coconut palm and he is somewhat surprised to note that Sparks
slightly overrates Mrs. Brokebaugh's appearance.</p>

<p>Even from a distance Fatso can see that she is a zero for looks
but he can also see that the old guy with her seems to be about as
described by Sparks, only more so. He is a tall, thin old guy with
a red face and a bald head and eyes like a shark and Fatso observes
that the servants tiptoe going past him.</p>

<p>Well, Fatso gets under the tree and starts calling out names
once more and giving out packages and there is now great excitement
and many oohs and ahs in female voices on all sides and finally he
gets down to just a few packages and calls out the name of Johnny
Relf and right away afterwards the name of Miss Betty Lou Marvel
and in fact Fatso calls them so close together that they meet under
the tree though all they do is exchange cruel glances.</p>

<p>Fatso does not say anything whatever to this Johnny as he gives
him his package, because Fatso feels that he already does enough
talking in words of one syllable to the children, but when Miss
Betty Lou steps up he gives her a smile and says:</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, little miss."</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, Santa Claus," she says, "but I still do not
believe in you."</p>

<p>Then she starts walking away opening her package as she goes and
all of a sudden she lets out a cry and starts running towards
Johnny Relf but by now Johnny opens his own package, too, and
starts running towards Betty Lou.</p>

<p>So they meet practically head-on and start taking holds on each
other in the presence of one and all, because it seems that Betty
Lou's present is a large square-cut diamond ring with a card in the
box which states that it is to my beloved from Johnny and that his
present is a pair of big black pearl studs with a card saying they
are with all my heart to Johnny from Betty Lou.</p>

<p>Of course nobody bothers to look into the matter at the moment,
but when somebody does so later on it is considered something of a
coincidence that the writing on the two cards is exactly the same
and not very neat, but one and all figure it is just an act of
Providence and let it go at that, especially as an act of
Providence is regarded as quite a compliment to Palm Beach.</p>

<p>In fact, at this particular moment nobody is paying much
attention to anything much but the great happiness of Betty Lou and
Johnny, except Mrs. Mimm and she is watching Fatso with keen
interest, though Fatso is unaware of her attention as he walks over
to where Mrs. Brokebaugh is sitting and hands her a package instead
of calling out her name.</p>

<p>Then Fatso returns to the house figuring to get his Santa Claus
suit off and collect his wages from Sparks and vanish from these
parts before anybody learns that he writes these cards when he is
alone in the library and swaps them for cards that will give the
ring to Mrs. Mimm from Johnny and the black pearls to Johnny from
Mrs. Mimm, in both cases with love.</p>

<p>While he is walking through a long hallway, all of a sudden
Fatso gets a feeling that he is being followed, and looking around
he observes Mrs. Mimm close behind him. There is something about
Mrs. Mimm that causes Fatso to walk a little faster and then he
notes that Mrs. Mimm is walking quite a little faster than he
is.</p>

<p>So Fatso dodges into an open doorway that he hopes and trusts
may lead him elsewhere but he forgets that when he goes through
doors it is usually advisable for him to turn sideways because of
his great width. He goes at this door frontways and the next thing
he knows there he is stuck right in the middle of the doorway and
then he becomes conscious of great discomfort to the southward as
it seems that Mrs. Mimm is forgetting she is a lady and is kicking
him severely and it also seems that these evening shoes that the
Judys wear nowadays with their bare toes sticking out in front are
capable of inflicting greater pain when used for kicking than just
ordinary shoes.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it appears that there is some commotion in the
patio because Mrs. Brokebaugh is so startled at getting any
Christmas present at all that she cannot open the package Fatso
gives her so old Mr. Brokebaugh opens it for her and finds a gold
vanity case with a card that reads as follows:</p>

<p>"To my sweetest sweet from Gregorio."</p>

<p>Well, of course old Mr. Brokebaugh has no way of knowing that
this is Count Gregorio's present to Betty Lou and that Fatso does
not even change the card but only rubs out Betty Lou's name on it
and puts down Mrs. Brokebaugh's, though naturally old Mr.
Brokebaugh knows who Gregorio is.</p>

<p>In fact, he can see Gregorio at this very moment standing near
by feeling of his little moustache and looking greatly bewildered
at the scene that is still going on at intervals, between Betty Lou
and Johnny, and all of a sudden old Mr. Brokebaugh lets out a yell
and jumps up and pulls a pistol out of his pocket and starts full
tilt at the count speaking in a loud tone, as follows:</p>

<p>"So," he says, "you are making a play for my wife, are you,
scoundrel?"</p>

<p>Well, of course Count Gregorio has no idea what old Mr.
Brokebaugh is talking about, but he has eyes in his head and he can
see that Mr. Brokebaugh is making a dead set for him and that he is
hotter than a firecracker and he can also see the pistol and from
the way the count turns and starts running it is plain to be seen
that whatever he may be, he is no sucker.</p>

<p>He knocks over three debutantes and a banker worth ten million
dollars making for the patio wall and trying to keep trees and
bushes between him and old Mr. Brokebaugh as he goes and all this
time old Mr. Brokebaugh is running after him and with surprising
speed for a guy his age and waving the pistol and requesting the
count to stand still and be shot.</p>

<p>He never gets a really fair crack at the count except when
Gregorio is going over the wall and then old Mr. Brokebaugh lets
fly twice and misses both times and the sound of this shooting
probably saves Fatso many more contusions as it brings Mrs. Mimm
running into the patio to find out what is going on and in her
absence Fatso wiggles on through the doorway.</p>

<p>So Fatso shakes the sands of Palm Beach from his feet regretting
only that he never gets a chance to ask Betty Lou if she now
believes in Santa Claus and he goes on down to Miami and a year
later he relates the above circumstances to me one day when we are
sitting in the rocking chairs on the veranda of the Hotel
McAllister hoping to catch somebody going to the races with a
couple of spare seats in their car, for things are by no means
dinkum with Fatso and me at the moment.</p>

<p>"You see," Fatso says, "to-morrow is Christmas again and this is
what reminds me of these matters at this time."</p>

<p>"So it is, Fatso," I say. "It is strange how time flies. But,
Fatso," I say, "are you not most severe on Count Gregorio in not
only knocking him out of a chance to pick up a few boffoes by
marriage but in almost getting him plugged by a jealous
husband?"</p>

<p>"No," Fatso says. "By no means. You must always remember he
calls me a fat bum. Besides," he says, "old Brokebaugh just spares
me the humiliation of denouncing Gregorio as a former bus boy in
Vincenti's wop restaurant in West Fiftieth Street and still wanted
for robbing the damper of thirty-six dollars.</p>

<p>"I will never forgive myself if I am compelled to holler copper
on anybody whatsoever," Fatso says, "but," he says, "of course I
will do so as a last resort to prevent Gregorio from marrying Betty
Lou. It comes to me all of a sudden why his face is familiar when I
am strolling on the sands the time I meet Betty Lou. I never forget
a face."</p>

<p>Well, at this moment a big limousine stops in front of the hotel
and a small-sized lively Judy all dressed up and sparkling with
jewellery hops out of the car and runs up the veranda steps with
three good-looking tanned young guys with little moustaches running
after her and she is laughing and gay and looks like plenty in the
bank, and I am greatly surprised when she skips up to Fatso and
gives him a pat on the arm and says like this:</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, Santa Claus!"</p>

<p>Then she is gone as quick as she comes and the young guys with
her and she is still laughing and Fatso is gazing at a fifty-dollar
note in his hand with great pleasure and he says:</p>

<p>"She is from Palm Beach," he says. "Anytime anybody from Palm
Beach recognizes me they stake me to something because they
remember that Mrs. Mimm never pays me the fifty she promises me for
being her Santa Claus. I understand," Fatso says, "that it is a
public scandal in Palm Beach."</p>

<p>"Is this one Betty Lou?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Fatso says. "She is Mrs. Brokebaugh. I recall now I
hear that ever since she gets the Christmas present that she thinks
to this very day is from Count Gregorio, she decides she is a
natural-born charmer and blossoms out into a life of gaiety, and,"
Fatso says, "they tell me her husband cannot do a thing about it.
Well, Merry Christmas to you."</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, Fatso," I say.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="CLEO" id="CLEO">22. CLEO</a>
</h2>

<p>ONE pleasant spring day at the Bowie race track, there comes to
me a guy by the name of Fat-Fat, who is a horse player by trade and
who is called by this name because he is not only fat but he is
double fat. In fact, he is very fat indeed. He has a paper in his
hand and he seems greatly pleased and he says to me like this:</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "The Beard wants me. Yes," he says, "Uncle Sam
at last calls me to join the colours. I have here a summons to
report to my draft board in Yew York City. I understand you are
seeking means of transportation there and I will be pleased to have
you accompany me in my car as my guest. Why," Fat-Fat says, "I can
scarcely wait to get my uniform. It is long my ambition to serve my
country and besides," he says, "when Cleo my fiancée sees me as a
soldier maybe she will speak to me again after giving me the back
of her neck for all these months."</p>

<p>So there I am speeding through Delaware with Fat-Fat in his big,
open automobile for at this time he is quite strong in the funds
department what with putting over several nice parlays at Bowie and
my presence is without doubt a great comfort to him as Fat-Fat
always likes to have someone to converse with. But it seems to me
he can do just as well alone, as when Fat-Fat gets sunk down behind
the wheel all his chins pile up around his neck and he is never
able to turn his head one way or the other to see who he is
conversing with or how they are taking it. In fact, he just talks
straight ahead.</p>

<p>He never talks about anything whatsoever but this Cleo he is in
love with, but as most of his words get lost among his chins I
never hear half of what he says so I do not try to answer him and
anyway Fat-Fat does not care whether you answer him or not as long
as you do not try to change the subject from Cleo.</p>

<p>She is a brown-haired pretty who has a dancing background and at
the time I am speaking of she is working for Buddy DeSylva in a
show by the name of Panama Hattie and she is regarded as one of the
prettiest of all the pretties in the show. To tell the truth, she
is regarded by some as a gorgeous and it is generally conceded that
she is by no means an intellectual, or anyway not offensively
so.</p>

<p>I am not very well acquainted with her but Fat-Fat tells me that
she is a hard-working and conscientious pretty and that after the
show is over at night she hastens right to her home in the Bronx
and I have no doubt this is very true, although I also hear from
other sources that she generally routes herself to the Bronx by way
of the Stork Club, Leon and Eddie's, La Martinique and similar
detours.</p>

<p>Well, as we go buzzing along, suddenly we behold an interesting
spectacle at the side of the road. A cow is lying on the ground
quite still and a little calf is standing beside it on very wobbly
pins going mah-ah-ah, like that, and a guy in overalls and a dirty
shirt, who is without doubt a Jasper, is also standing there
looking most depressed, and seeing all this, Fat-Fat stops the car
and gets out and views the situation a while and the following
conversation ensues:</p>

<p>"Hello," Fat-Fat says. "What comes off?"</p>

<p>"A truck kills my cow," the Jasper says. "I see it disappearing
over the hill just as I come up."</p>

<p>"Why," Fat-Fat says, "this is quite pitiful. What about the
midget here?" he says, pointing to the calf. "Why is it making such
a row? Does it get hit too? I see many a cow in my time," Fat-Fat
says, "but never before do I see a midget one."</p>

<p>"Look, Fat-Fat," I say, "this is not a midget. This is a baby
cow that is called a calf and a fine specimen it is, too, and it is
bawling because its mamma is lying here cold in death. It is now an
orphan."</p>

<p>"Well," Fat-Fat says, "I never see such a sawed-off cow before
so naturally I think it is a midget cow. I never realize there are
baby cows. I always figure they come full-size. Look at its big,
soft brown eyes. Who do they remind you of?"</p>

<p>I look at the calf's eyes but they do not remind me of anybody's
except a calf's and I so state to Fat-Fat who is now squatted down
petting the calf and gazing into its eyes while the calf is still
going mah-ha-ah.</p>

<p>"They are Cleo's eyes," Fat-Fat says. "I never see such a
resemblance. Mister," he says to the Jasper, "is this a boy baby
cow or a girl baby cow?"</p>

<p>"Why," the Jasper says, "it is a cow calf so it must be a girl.
If it is a boy it will be a bull calf and not a cow calf at all.
Now," he says, "I must lug this calf nearly two miles to my home
back here in the woods. I do not see how they wander so far away in
the first place."</p>

<p>"Why not shoo it along ahead of you?" I say. "Or maybe we can
find a piece of string and you can pull it."</p>

<p>"No," the Jasper says, "I will have to carry it. It is too young
and it is already plumb tuckered out from walking. This is a
terrible blow to me as the cow is my sole possession in the way of
livestock and she supplies milk for my children. She is a Jersey
and a wonderful milker. Now," he says, "I have no means of getting
milk for my children or for this calf either."</p>

<p>"Mister," Fat-Fat says, "will you sell this baby cow to me? I
will give you a hundred dollars for it. It will make a wonderful
present for Cleo my fiancée and something to remember me by when I
am in the Army serving my country, and," he says, "more than
anything else she is sure to consider it a most touching gesture
when she learns I buy a baby cow just because its eyes remind me of
her. Cleo is really very sentimental."</p>

<p>Well, at this I remonstrate with Fat-Fat and try to explain to
him that such a purchase is most ill-advised. But Fat-Fat will not
listen to me, and the upshot of it is he gives the Jasper the
hundred dollars and the Jasper, who is practically stunned by the
transaction, lifts the calf into the back seat of the car and tells
Fat-Fat he must feed it milk out of a bottle for a spell.</p>

<p>So away we go with the calf lying down in the seat and going
mah-ah-ah, but presently Fat-Fat finds he cannot keep looking
around at the calf on account of his chins preventing him from
turning his head and he makes me do the driving while he gets in at
the back seat with the calf and before long he is calling it Cleo
and I can see that this is now the calf's name.</p>

<p>We stop at the first town we come to and Fat-Fat buys a baby's
nursing bottle with a nipple on it at a drugstore and then he buys
some milk and gets a guy in a hamburger joint to warm it up and he
feeds Cleo in a way that is astonishing to behold. I never know
before that Fat-Fat is so handy in this respect but he tells me he
often performs a similar service for his baby brother and his baby
sister, too, when he is a kid over on Tenth Avenue. By the time we
reach Yew York City, I can see that Fat-Fat is greatly devoted to
Cleo the calf and I can also see that Cleo the calf thinks very
well of Fat-Fat, which is not surprising considering he is the
source of her warm milk.</p>

<p>We pull up in front of Mindy's restaurant on Broadway around the
dinner hour when the place is well filled with customers and
Fat-Fat lifts Cleo the calf out of the car and carries her inside
in his arms and naturally it is quite a surprise to one and all to
observe this spectacle, especially when Fat-Fat sits down at a
table in a booth and puts Cleo on the settee opposite him. In fact,
there is so much commotion that Mindy himself appears and when he
sees Cleo the calf he does not even shake hands with Fat-Fat and
tell him he is glad to see him back but says to him like this:</p>

<p>"Wrong bettors, yes," Mindy says, "Actors and newspapermen and
song writers, yes. But," Mindy says, "calves no. You cannot keep
these cattle in my gaff, Fat-Fat."</p>

<p>"This is Cleo, Mindy," Fat-Fat says.</p>

<p>"Cleo?" Mindy says. "Ha-ha-ha-ha," he says. "Cleo just leaves
here for the theatre full of goulash with the guy with the one
eyeglass she is running around with while you are absent. I think
he is a nobleman refugee. Everybody is a nobleman refugee nowadays.
I do not like his looks. But," Mindy says, "this is neither here
nor there nor elsewhere. You must take this thing out of here,
especially," he says, "as calfs are very seldom house broke."</p>

<p>Well, at this, Cleo the calf goes mah-ah-ah and who comes up but
Ambrose Hammer, the newspaper scribe, who speaks to Mindy as
follows:</p>

<p>"See here, Mindy," he says, "you serve veal in here, do you
not?"</p>

<p>"The very best," Mindy says. "Veal stew, veal chops, veal
tenderloin and wiener schnitzel, which is a veal."</p>

<p>"It all comes from a calf," Ambrose says. "You also serve
calves' liver, do you not?"</p>

<p>"None better," Mindy says. "It is very good for nimmicks."</p>

<p>"You mean anæmics," Ambrose says. "Kindly do not distort the
English language, Mindy. Now," he says, "what is the difference
between permitting the by-products of the calf in here and the calf
itself? You are being very unreasonable, if you ask me."</p>

<p>Naturally, Mindy is somewhat nonplussed by this argument,
especially as he wishes to remain on friendly terms with Ambrose
Hammer because sometimes Ambrose mentions the joint in his column,
which is very nice publicity indeed, and besides by this time
everybody in the place is interested in Cleo the calf and all the
pretties are coming up and addressing her in baby language and
Mindy can see that she is quite an attraction.</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "I will have to think this situation over."</p>

<p>So he retires to the kitchen and Fat-Fat and I have our dinner
and Cleo the calf has her milk out of the bottle and Ambrose Hammer
sits down with us and listens with great interest to Fat-Fat's
story of how he comes to buy Cleo the calf because of her eyes and
why he calls her Cleo and all this and that. In fact, Ambrose is so
interested that he goes to his office and writes a very fine story
about Fat-Fat and Cleo the calf and also about Cleo the pretty, but
of course we do not know this until the blat Ambrose works for
comes out the next morning.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Fat-Fat takes Cleo the calf around to the hotel
in West Forty-ninth Street where he always lives in New York,
figuring to register her there and then go looking for Cleo the
pretty and have a reunion and one thing and another with her. But
he has great difficulty convincing the night clerk that Cleo the
calf is acceptable as a lodger because it seems that just a couple
of weeks previously the clerk admits a guest with a boa constrictor
and this boa constrictor escapes during the night and goes visiting
in other rooms and causes so much unrest in the hotel that the
clerk does not get a wink of sleep throughout his watch.</p>

<p>However, Fat-Fat is an old patron of the hotel and besides he
stakes the clerk to a sawsky, so he gets his old room and by this
time he is pretty well tuckered out himself so he decides to get a
good night's sleep before looking for Cleo the pretty and while
Cleo the calf goes mah-ah-ah most of the night, it does not seem to
disturb the other guests and does not bother the clerk at all, as
it seems he is raised on a farm and is accustomed to such sounds in
the night.</p>

<p>Well, soon after daylight the next morning the hotel is
surrounded by reporters and photographers from the afternoon blats
because it seems Ambrose Hammer makes Fat-Fat and Cleo the calf
sound very interesting, indeed, but it also seems that even before
they get there Cleo the pretty has Fat-Fat on the phone and that
she is sizzling about Fat-Fat telling Ambrose the calf's eyes
remind him of hers and claiming that this is just the same thing as
comparing her to a cow.</p>

<p>"Furthermore," Fat-Fat says when he is telling me about this
incident later in the day, "she informs me that I am nothing but a
tub of lard and that if I ever as much as look at her again she
will call the cops. She says anyway she is now in love with a very
high-class guy by the name of Henri something and is going to marry
him. When I tell her I buy Cleo the calf as a present for her she
spurns my token in words I am never before aware she even
knows.</p>

<p>"I also have other bad news," Fat-Fat says. "I am rejected
to-day by the doctors for the Army. They say I am too corpulent.
They give me the elbow without even permitting me to remove my
garments. Now I cannot even serve my country. On top of everything
else, I blow a good bet on Air Brigade in the fourth at Jamaica. I
am most despondent," Fat-Fat says. "But," he says, "I am now very
glad I buy Cleo the calf or I will have nothing whatever to console
myself with. I can always gaze into her eyes and remind myself of
my lost love."</p>

<p>For a couple of days the hotel receives so much publicity in
connection with Cleo the calf that the management is greatly
pleased with her presence but when the blats stop talking about her
she gets to be quite a bore, and they request Fat-Fat to remove
her, especially as guys from the health department commence coming
around and stating that it is setting a bad precedent to other
hotels to have a calf as a guest.</p>

<p>So Fat-Fat has to get rid of Cleo the calf or find another place
to live and by this time he is very fond of her, indeed, and cannot
bear the idea of parting from her. Finally, he finds a spot over on
Eleventh Avenue along in the Fifties not far from the North River
docks where an old bundle by the name of Mrs. Squamm runs a small
fleabag and who is very glad to have Fat-Fat and Cleo the calf. In
fact, Mrs. Squamm states that she often longs for a touch of rural
atmosphere over on Eleventh Avenue and feels that Cleo the calf
will provide same.</p>

<p>Furthermore, right next door to Mrs. Squamm's little fleabag
there is a fenced-in vacant lot covering half a block which is once
occupied by a house that burns down years ago leaving nothing but a
big hole in the ground in the centre of the lot that is formerly
the cellar, and Fat-Fat can see that this lot will be very handy
for Cleo the calf to romp about in when she gets older, especially
as Mrs. Squamm's kitchen where Cleo the calf sleeps opens right
into the lot.</p>

<p>Now the summer passes by and I do not see Fat-Fat for some time
although I hear of him hustling and bustling about the race courses
at his trade as a horse player, and then one night I run into him
in front of Mindy's and ask him how Cleo the calf is.</p>

<p>"Why," Fat-Fat says, "she is fine and growing like a weed. I
play with her every day, wrestling and rolling about on the floor
with her to strengthen her muscles and also to reduce my own
weight. I never give up hope of being permitted to serve my country
in the Army. She runs about the lot next door when I am at the
track and is enjoying herself in a way that is a pleasure to
behold. But," Fat-Fat says, "I am sorry to say that there has come
up some friction between Cleo the calf and a bunch of small kids
who also wish to use the lot as a playground. She detests
them."</p>

<p>"What about the other Cleo?" I ask.</p>

<p>At this, the tears start rolling down Fat-Fat's cheeks and he is
unable to speak, so I can see he is deeply affected and naturally I
am very sorry for him, especially as I hear rumours along Broadway
that Cleo the pretty seems to be crazy about this Henri. In fact, I
observe them one night together in the Stork Club holding hands and
gazing into each other's eyes in such a way that I can see it must
be love.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot blame her much as this Henri is a
good-looking guy with a small moustache and is very well dressed
except for a monocle and alongside of him Fat-Fat is naturally
nothing but a plater compared to a stake horse but of course looks
are not everything. To tell the truth, they are only about eighty
per cent. I make a few inquiries about Henri but nobody seems to
have any line on him except that he is undoubtedly a foreign guy
and seems to have plenty of beesom but at this time there are so
many foreign guys in New York with plenty of beesom that no one
ever bothers to find out who they are or where they are from, or
whatever.</p>

<p>Well, one night in the late fall, Fat-Fat calls me up at Mindy's
and requests me to come over to Mrs. Squamm's house and keep him
company, stating that he is not feeling well and does not wish to
go out. He also states that Mrs. Squamm goes to bed early and Cleo
the calf is sleeping out in the lot because she is now so big she
takes up too much room in the kitchen, and that he is low in his
mind and lonesome. So I go there and am playing him a little
pinochle and permitting him to win to cheer him up when along
towards midnight there comes a knock at the door and when Fat-Fat
opens it who rushes in but a big guy and a couple of smaller guys
and the big guy displays a badge in his hand and speaks like
this:</p>

<p>"Jubble is the name," he says. "Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Where are who?" Fat-Fat says.</p>

<p>"Kindly do not stall," Jubble says. "One of my guys hears her
give this house address to the taxi jockey as they drive away from
the Stork Club. They leave the cab, which is now in our custody,
waiting down the street a block off and walk here and the jockey
says he sees them climb over the fence into the lot next door, and
as we do not observe hide nor hair of them in the lot they must be
in this house because there is no other house around close. Come,
come," he says, "speak up."</p>

<p>Now all of a sudden we hear Cleo the calf's voice out in the lot
going mah-ah-ah as if she is in distress and Fat-Fat runs out the
back door of the kitchen and into the lot and Jubble and his guys
run after him and so do I. The street lights outside the fence
throw a dim light all over the lot but Cleo the calf is not to be
seen although we can still hear her. So Fat-Fat follows the sound
of her voice until it brings him to the hole in the ground that is
once a cellar and as the voice seems to come from this hole, Jubble
and his guys all turn flashlights into the hole and we observe a
somewhat unusual scene.</p>

<p>Cleo the calf and Cleo the pretty and Henri the foreign guy are
all down in the hole and Cleo the calf is chasing Cleo the pretty
and Henri back and forth in this space which is about the size and
depth of a long, narrow room, in a most surprising manner and going
mah-ah-ah in a tone that indicates she is greatly vexed, and I can
see that Cleo the calf is much more developed since I last notice
her and in fact she is quite large.</p>

<p>Now and then Henri tries to climb up one side of the hole,
digging his fingers in the dirt wall and Cleo the calf immediately
butts him vigorously from behind and knocks him down. Once while we
are gazing at this scene, Cleo the pretty also tries to climb the
wall and Cleo the calf butts her in the same place she does Henri
and just as vigorously and Cleo the pretty is sobbing and Henri is
using the most ungenteel language and Cleo the calf keeps going
mah-ah-ah so there is really some little confusion, and on viewing
all this, Fat-Fat becomes slightly indignant and speaks as
follows:</p>

<p>"See here, now," Fat-Fat says, "you must not be playing tag with
Cleo the calf at such an hour in a hole in the ground. She is
supposed to be getting her rest."</p>

<p>Well, even in the confusion I notice that the hole that is once
a cellar looks as if somebody recently clears it out and does a lot
of digging as if to make it deeper as there is much fresh earth
around and about and there are steps dug in one wall as if to
enable whoever does the digging to climb in and out and I also
notice that there are light boards across the hole like a flat
roof, and it is plain to be seen that these boards give way under
some kind of weight in the middle so I figure this is where Cleo
the calf and Cleo the pretty and Henri drop through into the hole.
Furthermore, Jubble seems to notice this, too, because he says:</p>

<p>"Why," he says, "this is really most ingenious. I must tell our
chief, Mr. Hoover, about this spy trap. Maybe we can build a few in
Washington."</p>

<p>"What makes it a spy trap?" I say.</p>

<p>"It traps this Henri guy, does it not?" Jubble says.</p>

<p>"And he is a spy. He is Henri la Porte, alias Muller, the most
dangerous secret agent and saboteur in the world. We are tailing
him for months. Johnson," he says to one of his guys, "jump down in
there and put the handcuffs on him, although," he says, "maybe you
better wait until somebody surrounds the animal that is pursuing
him."</p>

<p>At this, Fat-Fat drops down into the hole and puts his arms
around Cleo the calf and calls her pet names and quiets her down
and then this Johnson follows him into the hole and applies the
darbolas to Henri's wrists and all the time Henri is putting up
quite a bleat and saying he will see his ambassador and maybe the
President, and Cleo the pretty is sitting on the ground down in the
hole crying as if her heart will break.</p>

<p>We finally get them all out of the hole but Cleo the calf and go
back to Mrs. Squamm's house and on the way I ask Fat-Fat if he
notices the way the old cellar is fixed up and he says he does and
that he is greatly bewildered by same but that it is best not to
speak of this matter until we see what is what. He says there is
undoubtedly more here than meets the eye, and about now a tall guy
I do not see before comes into the house with still another guy
that I can see is a taxi-cab jockey and the tall guy whispers
something to Jubble and Jubble says like this:</p>

<p>"Fine," he says. "I am glad you put it in a safe place. Well,"
he says, gazing at Cleo the pretty who is still crying no little,
"I must also put this beautiful under arrest as an accomplice,
although," he says, "it is by no means the established policy of
our chief, Mr. Hoover, to molest beautifuls."</p>

<p>Now of course here is a predicament to be sure, because anybody
can see that being arrested as an accomplice to a saboteur will
present Cleo the pretty in an unfavourable light before her public
and Cleo the pretty begins to cry louder than ever and she looks at
Fat-Fat and speaks to him as follows:</p>

<p>"Irving," she says, "save me."</p>

<p>"Why," Fat-Fat says to Jubble, "what do you mean she is an
accomplice? She is my fiancée and my personal assistant. I have her
stool this Henri guy into the lot so we can trap him in exactly the
manner you observe, although," Fat-Fat says, "of course I do not
know he is as great a scapegrace as you state. I figure he is just
a fiancée thief and it is my intention to give him a going-over and
this marvellous here is in on the play."</p>

<p>"Oh," Jubble says, "I beg your pardon, miss. I beg everybody's
pardon. Why," he says, "you may get a medal for this. Now I must
hasten to my office and leave my lads to follow with the prisoner.
But," he says, "we must keep this capture quiet until we round up
any others who may be connected with Henri."</p>

<p>As Jubble departs and while I am still thinking of what an
exaggeration Fat-Fat is guilty of, and am also still wondering
about the cellar, Cleo the pretty throws herself into Fat-Fat's
arms and kisses him and says:</p>

<p>"Irving," she says, "forgive me for everything, I never really
love anybody but you."</p>

<p>"Why," Fat-Fat says, "I forgive you, all right, but how do you
come to be in this lot out here in the first place, not to mention
being down in the hole?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Cleo the pretty says, "I am going away and I get to
thinking of you, and I remember your address here, because I always
keep track of you, and I induce Henri to make a stop. He is putting
me aboard a ship that sails for South America at midnight and he is
going to join me there later and we are to be married. I want to
see you for the last time, but Henri has the cab stop before we
reach your door. I can see now he must suspect we are being
followed.</p>

<p>"We walk the rest of the way," Cleo the pretty says, "but Henri
is evidently still suspicious as he boosts me over the fence into
the lot and follows after me and tells me we must wait there awhile
and what do I see in the lot but a terrible animal and for no
reason this animal becomes angry and chases us around until we run
across what looks like solid ground but which gives way under our
feet and drops us into the hole. It is a dreadful experience,
Irving," she says.</p>

<p>"I do not understand it," Fat-Fat says. "It is not in keeping
with Cleo the calf's character to display such temper. I guess she
realizes Henri is a wrongie."</p>

<p>"Irving," Cleo the pretty says, "you must not think Henri is as
bad as these parties state. He is very kind to me and gives me a
perfectly huge basket of fruits and flowers and candles for my
going-away present. I leave it in the cab and, Irving," she says,
"I trust you will recover it for me."</p>

<p>At this, the tall guy who comes in last and who seems to be
questioning the taxicab jockey, steps over to Cleo the pretty and
taps her on the shoulder and says:</p>

<p>"Sister," he says, "Henri is not putting you on a boat for South
America. He is putting you on one that is going to Egypt and is
loaded with war supplies. And in the basket of stuff he gives you
for a present is a time bomb that will sink the ship and you with
it inside of twelve hours."</p>

<p>"Why," Cleo the pretty says, "maybe he is a rascal after all.
But," she says, "it is a beautiful basket."</p>

<p>Afterwards I hear this same tall guy talking to Henri in another
room and he says to Henri like this:</p>

<p>"Muller," he says, "how do you ever come to join out with a dumb
broad such as this?"</p>

<p>"Why," Henri says, "I need a dumb one for my purpose. But I am
dumber than she is. If I do not let her talk me into making this
stop for a farewell to the blubberhead I will have her aboard the
Zoozoo and my work will be accomplished."</p>

<p>But of course I do not mention this conversation to Fat-Fat or
to Cleo the pretty either as I fear it may cast a slight cloud over
their happiness.</p>

<p>"Well," Fat-Fat says, when the guys finally leave with Henri,
"everything turns out for the best. But," he says, "I am still
puzzled as to how such a gentle little thing comes to commit this
violent assault. Maybe I do wrong in teaching her to butt," he
says.</p>

<p>Then Fat-Fat and Cleo the pretty kiss and hug again and their
pleasure in this proceeding is really beautiful to behold and later
Cleo the pretty tells me in confidence that what makes her realize
that she truly loves Fat-Fat is that when she sees Cleo the calf in
the lot and remembers the rumours that come to her ears of how
Fat-Fat adores this creature, a terrible wave of jealousy comes
over her and she cannot resist giving Cleo the calf a good kick in
the slats. And Cleo the pretty says this kick is undoubtedly what
stirs Cleo the calf to a passion and causes her to run them into
the hole.</p>

<p>I drop over to Mrs. Squamm's a few days later and Fat-Fat and
Cleo the pretty and Mrs. Squamm are having something to eat in the
kitchen and Cleo the calf is standing half in and half out of the
doorway watching them and I give them all a huge hello including
Cleo the calf and sit down and Fat-Fat says to me like this:</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "Mrs. Squamm finds out about the cellar for me.
It seems the little kids of the neighbourhood who are disputing
with Cleo the calf for possession of the lot see a movie about
big-game hunters in Africa or some such place and observe how they
trap lions and tigers and elephants and all this and that and they
are pretending among themselves as kids will do that Cleo the calf
is a tiger and they make a trap of the cellar similar to something
they see in the movies to snare her. Mrs. Squamm says it is called
a pitfall. She thinks they are playing they are Frank Bucks. My
gracious," Fat-Fat says, "when I am a kid, Jesse James is plenty
good enough for me."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "no doubt you will soon be passing about the
neighbourhood distributing a few bootses in the antses?"</p>

<p>"By no means," Fat-Fat says. "Let us say no more about this
incident as I am receiving great credit for personally trapping
Henri and in fact I am to be rewarded with a job in the service of
the Beard. They are going to send me to a school and make an
undercover guy of me to run down other secret agents and saboteurs
and such. So I will get to serve my country after all."</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Fat-Fat," I say. "And what is to become of
Cleo the pretty here and also of Cleo the calf?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Fat-Fat says, "I am buying a little farm up the Hudson. We
are going to live there and raise a lot of little Cleos on both
sides."</p>

<p>Then he and Cleo the pretty begin hugging and kissing again and
Mrs. Squamm laughs heartily and Cleo the calf goes moo-oo-oo, like
that, so I can see her voice is commencing to change no little.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="THE_LACEWORK_KID" id="THE_LACEWORK_KID">23. THE
LACEWORK KID</a>
</h2>

<p>Now, of course, the war makes itself felt along Broadway no
little and quite some and in fact it is a most disturbing element
at times as it brings many strangers to the city who crowd Mindy's
restaurant to the doors and often compel the old-time regular
customers to stand in line waiting for tables, which is a very
great hardship, indeed.</p>

<p>It does no good to complain to Mindy about this situation as he
is making so much money he is practically insolent and he only asks
you if you do not know there is a war going on, and besides Mindy
is generally waiting for a table himself.</p>

<p>Well, one evening I am fortunate enough to out-cute everyone
else for a chair that is the only vacant chair at a little table
for two and the other chair is occupied by a soldier, and who is
this soldier but a guy by the name of The Lacework Kid who is
eating as if Hitler is coming up Broadway.</p>

<p>Now The Lacework Kid, who is generally called Lace for short, is
a personality who is maybe thirty years old but looks younger and
is a card player by trade. Furthermore he is considered one of the
best that ever riffles a deck. In fact, he comes by his monicker
because someone once remarks that his work with the cards is as
delicate as lace, although personally I consider this an
understatement.</p>

<p>He comes from the city of Providence which is in Rhode Island,
and of course it is well known to one and all that for generations
Providence produces wonderful card players, and in his childhood
The Lacework Kid has the advantage of studying under the best minds
there, and afterwards improves his education in this respect by
much travel.</p>

<p>Before the war he is a great hand for riding the tubs and makes
regular trips back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean because a
guy in his line can always find more customers on the boats than
anywhere else and can also do very good for himself by winning the
pools on the ship's daily run if he can make the proper connections
to get the information on the run in advance.</p>

<p>I only wish you can see The Lacework Kid before the war when he
is at the height of his career. He is maybe five feet nine and very
slender and has brown eyes and wavy brown hair and a face like a
choirboy and a gentle voice.</p>

<p>He wears the best clothes money can buy and they are always of
soft quiet materials and his linen is always white and his shoes
black. He wears no jewellery showing, but he carries a little gold
watch in his pants pockets that stands him a G-er in Paris and a
gold cigarette box that sets him back a gob in the same place.</p>

<p>He has long slim white hands like a society broad and in fact
there is no doubt that his hands are the secret of The Lacework
Kid's success at his trade of card playing as they are fast and
flexible and have youth in them, and youth is one thing a good card
player must have, because age stiffens up more than somewhat. But
of course age is a drawback in everything in this wicked old
world.</p>

<p>It is really a beautiful sight to watch The Lacework Kid handle
a deck of cards because he makes the pasteboards just float
together when he is shuffling and causes them to fall as light as
flecks of foam when he is dealing. His speciality is a game called
bridge when he is riding the tubs and he is seldom without
customers because in the first place he does not look like a guy
who can play bridge very well and in the second place he does not
appear to be such a personality as the signs in the smoking rooms
on the boats refer to when they say "Beware of Card Sharks." In
fact The Lacework Kid generally tries to get a chair right under
one of these signs to show that it cannot possibly mean him.</p>

<p>I see The Lacework Kid a few years before this night in Mindy's
when he just gets in on a German liner and he has a guy by the name
of Schultz with him and is entertaining this Schultz royally
because it seems Schultz is the smoking room steward on the liner
and is The Lacework Kid's connection in winning the pools and in
introducing bridge customers to him and putting him away with them
as a rich young American zillionaire and as the trip nets Lace two
thou on the pools alone he feels quite grateful to Schultz.</p>

<p>But of course this is before there is any war and later when I
see him the unpleasantness is on and no liners are running and Lace
tells me his trade is the greatest economic casualty of the whole
war, and he is wondering if there is any use trying to ride the
submarines back and forth looking for customers.</p>

<p>And now here he is again as large as life and in fact slightly
larger as I can see he puts on a little weight and he looks very
good in his uniform and has a red ribbon on his chest, so I say to
him like this:</p>

<p>"Lace," I say, "it is indeed a pleasure to run into you and I
can see by your uniform that you are in the war business and by
your ribbon that you distinguish yourself in some manner. Perhaps
you are decorated for dealing the general a nice hand off the
bottom?"</p>

<p>Well, at this, The Lacework Kid gives me a most severe look and
says:</p>

<p>"It is a Good Conduct Medal. I get it for being a fine soldier.
I may get an even better award for an experience I will now relate
to you."</p>

<p>I will omit the details of my early career in the Army (The
Lacework Kid says) except to tell you that my comrades know me only
as Sergeant Fortescue Melville Michael O'Shay, my mamma getting the
first two names out of a novel she is reading at the time I am
born, and my papa's papa bringing the last two over from
Ireland.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they know nothing of my background and while there
are occasions when I am greatly tempted to make assessments against
them out of my great store of knowledge when they are playing such
trifling games as blackjack, I resist the urge and confine myself
strictly to the matter in hand, which is the war.</p>

<p>I am the waist gunner in a Flying Fortress on a raid over
Germany one pleasant afternoon when our ship is so severely jostled
by anti-aircraft shells that we are compelled to bail out and no
sooner do I land than up comes three German soldiers with rifles in
their dukes.</p>

<p>They point these rifles at me in a most disquieting manner and
while I only know a word or two of the German language I can see
that I am their prisoner and the next thing I know I am in a prison
camp where I find my comrades and also several hundred other gees
who seem to be British and one thing and another.</p>

<p>It is not a large camp and in fact I learn that it is just a
sort of temporary detention spot for prisoners who are rounded up
in this particular section of the country and that they are usually
transferred to a larger gaff after a while. It is located in a
hilly country not far from the Swiss border and you can see high
mountains in the distance that I am told are the Alps.</p>

<p>But even with the view it is by no means a desirable place. The
life in this camp is most monotonous and the cuisine is worse,
which is a terrible disappointment to me as I am rather fond of
German cooking, and particularly adore the apple strudel of this
race, and the chow they give us makes me more violently anti-Nazi
than ever and also gives me indigestion. To tell the truth, I spend
most of my time trying to figure a way to escape though they tell
me that if I am patient I will sooner or later be exchanged for a
German prisoner.</p>

<p>There is a company of maybe a hundred German soldiers guarding
the camp and I am only there a few hours before I learn that the
officer who is in charge of the joint is a captain by the name of
Kunz, and that he is also sometimes called The Butcher because it
seems that in the early days of the war he is in command of an
outfit in Poland and thinks nothing of killing people right and
left for no reason whatever except he enjoys seeing them die.</p>

<p>But it seems he finally gets himself in bad with his boss and is
sent to this little out-of-the-way prison camp as a lesson to him
and he runs the place like the tough warden of a stir back home
though he does not show up much in person around the camp and in
fact I never see him myself until the time I am going to tell you
about.</p>

<p>One afternoon a German sergeant comes into the prison yard,
where I am taking a little exercise and beckons me off to one side
and I am somewhat surprised to observe that the sergeant is nobody
but Schultz the steward, who speaks to me in a low voice as
follows:</p>

<p>"Hello, Lace," he says, "How is everything?"</p>

<p>"Schultz," I say, "everything stinks."</p>

<p>"Lace," he says, "what do you know about something American that
is called gin rummy?"</p>

<p>"Gin rummy?" I say. "Why I know it is supposed to be a card game
but as a matter of fact it is nothing but a diversion for
idiots."</p>

<p>"Are you a gin rummy man?" Schultz says. "I mean do you play the
game?"</p>

<p>"Schultz," I say, "nearly everybody in the United States of
America plays gin rummy. The little children in the street play it.
Old broads play it. I understand there is a trained ape in the
Bronx Zoo that plays it very nicely and I am not surprised,
because," I say, "I can teach any dumb animal to play gin rummy if
I can get it to hold ten cards."</p>

<p>"Well," Schultz says, "what I am getting at is do you play it as
well as you play bridge and in the same way? What I must know is
are you a mechanic at gin? I mean if necessary?"</p>

<p>Well naturally I am slightly vexed by this question as I
consider it an insult to my integrity as well as a reflection upon
my card playing to even hint that I do anything in cards except
outplay my opponent through my superior skill. To tell the truth, I
feel it is just the same as asking Joe Louis if he uses the
difference in his gloves when he is meeting a chump.</p>

<p>"Schultz," I say, "you are undoubtedly a scoundrel to always be
thinking in terms of larceny. I never swindle anybody at anything
despite any rumours to the contrary that you may hear. And I never
hear of any swindles in gin rummy except planting a guy who is
supposed to have a piece of your opponent's play alongside him to
tip off his cards to you.</p>

<p>"But," I say, "I consider this a low form of thievery. However,
Schultz," I say, "I will be guilty of false modesty if I do not
admit to you that like all gin players I think I am the best. In
fact, I know of but one who can beat me consistently at gin and
that is Kidneyfoot, the waiter in Mindy's, but then he teaches me
the game and naturally figures to top me slightly."</p>

<p>Well, then this Schultz unfolds a very strange tale to me.</p>

<p>He says that when Captain Kunz is in the United States for some
years before the war as an attaché of the German embassy in
Washington, he learns the game of gin rummy and it becomes a great
passion with him.</p>

<p>It seems from what Schultz says that after Kunz returns to
Germany, he misses his gin rummy no little as the game is
practically unknown in his country where card players generally
favour pinochle or maybe klabriasch. It seems that Kunz tries to
teach some of his countrymen how to play gin but has little success
and anyway the war comes on and promoting an American game will be
deemed unpatriotic, so he has to cease his efforts in this
direction.</p>

<p>But he cannot stop thinking of gin, so he finally invents a sort
of solitaire gin and plays it constantly all by himself, but it is
most unsatisfactory and when he hears of American prisoners
arriving in his camp, he sends for Schultz and asks him to canvass
us and see if there are any gin rummy players in the crowd. And in
looking us over, Schultz spots me.</p>

<p>"Now," Schultz says, "I build you up to the captain as the
champion gin player of the United States, and he finally tells me
the other night that he wishes to play you if it can be done in
secret, as of course it will be very bad for morale if it gets out
that the commandant of a prison camp engages in card games with a
prisoner. The captain is rich and likes to play for high stakes,
too," Schultz says.</p>

<p>"Look, Schultz," I say, "I do not have any moolouw with me here.
All my potatoes are planted in a jug in England and I do not
suppose the captain will accept notes of hand payable there."</p>

<p>"Listen," Schultz says, dropping his voice to a whisper, "I tell
all my fellow soldiers here about your gin playing, and how you are
so clever you can make a jack jump out of a deck and sing
Chattanooga Choo-Choo if necessary, and we all agree to pool our
resources to provide you with a taw. We can raise maybe fifty
thousand marks. But," Schultz says, "you must not breathe a word of
this to your comrades. The captain must think they are the ones who
are backing you. You will receive twenty-five per cent. of your
winnings, and I will personally guarantee your end."</p>

<p>Naturally, I figure Schultz is giving me the old rol-de-dol-dol
for some reason because it does not make sense that an officer in
the German army will wish to play an American prisoner gin rummy,
but then I remember that gin players will do anything to play gin
and I figure that maybe the captain is like the old faro bank
player who is warned as he is going into a gambling house to beware
of the bank game there because it is crooked and who says:</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it is, but what am I going to do? It is the only
game in town."</p>

<p>Well, of course this is an ancient story to you and you will
kindly forgive me for springing it at this time, but I am trying to
explain the psychology of this captain as I see it. Anyway, I tell
Schultz to go ahead and arrange the game and in the meantime I get
a deck of cards and practise to refresh my memory.</p>

<p>Now, one night Schultz shows up at my quarters and tells me to
come with him and he says it in such a stern voice and acts so
mysterious that everyone figures I am being taken out to be shot
and to tell you the truth I am not so sure myself that this is not
the case. But when we get away from the other prisoners, Schultz is
quite nice to me.</p>

<p>He takes me outside the gates of the prison camp and we walk
along a road about a mile when we come to a small house set back
from the road in a grove of trees and Schultz stops in front of
this house and speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>"Lace," he says, "in the course of your playing with the captain
kindly do not refer to our people as krauts, pretzels, beerheads,
Heinies, Boches, sausages, wienies or by the titles of any other
members of the vegetable or animal kingdom, and do not tell him
what you Americans are going to do to us. It will only make for an
unfriendly atmosphere, and his replies may distract you from your
gin. He understands English, so please be discreet in every
respect."</p>

<p>Then he hands me a roll of German marks a steeplechase horse
will be unable to hurdle and leads the way into the house, and by
this time I figure out what the scamus is. I figure that Schultz
pegs me for a bleater, and the captain is going to try to get some
information out of me and, in fact, I am looking for a touch of the
old third degree from the Gestapo.</p>

<p>But on entering the house, which seems to be very plainly
furnished, the only person present is a big guy in uniform with a
lot of gongs on his chest, which is a way of saying medals, and
whose head is shaved like Eric von Stroheim's in a Nazi picture. He
is sitting at a table in front of a burning fireplace fooling with
a deck of cards.</p>

<p>Schultz introduces me to him, but the guy only nods and motions
me to sit down at the table opposite him and tosses the deck of
cards to me. I examine the backs carefully to see if they are
marked, but they seem strictly kosher in every way, and then I say
to Captain Kunz like this:</p>

<p>"Captain," I say, "let us understand one thing. I am a
non-commissioned officer, and you outrank me from hell to breakfast
time, but in this game you must not take advantage of your rank in
any way, shape, manner or form, to intimidate me. We will play New
York rules, with gins and undercuts to count twenty each and
blitzes double."</p>

<p>Kunz nods and motions me to cut the cards for the deal, and he
wins it and away we go. We play three games at once and as soon as
both of us are on all three games, we start another frame of three,
with Schultz keeping score, and it is not long before we have as
many as three frames or nine games going at once, which makes a
very fast contest, indeed. We are playing for a hundred marks a
game or three hundred marks across, which Schultz tells me is about
a hundred and twenty dollars in my money, the way the Germans
figure their marks.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe gin rummy in detail as you can
call up any insane asylum and get any patient on the phone and
learn all about it in no time, as all lunatics are bound to be gin
players, and in fact the chances are it is gin rummy that makes
them lunatics. Furthermore, I will not bore you with my philosophy
of the game, but I say it is ninety-five per cent. luck and five
per cent. play, and the five per cent. is the good card player's
strength in the pinches, if there are any pinches.</p>

<p>The cards in gin rummy run hot and cold the same as the dice in
a crap game. It is by no means necessary to go to Harvard to learn
to play gin and in fact a moron is apt to play it better than
Einstein. If you get the tickets in gin, you are a genius, and if
you do not get them, you are a bum. When they do not come, you can
only sit and suffer, and the aggravation of waiting on cards that
never arrive will give you stomach ulcers in no time.</p>

<p>Well, I can see at once that Captain Kunz plays as good a game
of gin as anybody can play and he also has good regulation
dialogue, such as "This is the worst hand I ever see in my life,"
and "I only need one little card from the draw to get down," and so
forth and so on, but he delivers his dialogue in German and then
Schultz translates it for me as it seems the captain does not care
to address me direct in English, which I consider very snobbish of
him.</p>

<p>About the only word he says I can understand is <i>frischer</i>
when he picks up a bad hand and wishes to know if I am agreeable to
a fresh deal, which is a courtesy a gin player sometimes extends if
he also has a bad hand, though personally I am opposed to
<i>frischer</i>. In fact, when I get a bad hand, I play the
Pittsburgh Muddle system on Kunz, which is to pick up every card he
discards whether I need it or not and then throw it back at him
when my hand improves, the idea being to confuse your opponent and
make him hold cards that gum up his hand.</p>

<p>Well, I get my rushes right away and win the first frame and am
going so strong on the second that Kunz gets up and peels his coat
down to a pair of pink suspenders and ten minutes later he drops
the suspenders off his shoulders and opens his waist band. In the
meantime, Schultz kibitzes the captain on one hand and me on the
next, and of course a kibitzer is entitled to present his views on
a play after it is over, and Schultz is undoubtedly a real kibitzer
and becomes quite excited at times in his comment.</p>

<p>However, once he is very bitter in his criticism of a play that
costs the captain a game, and Kunz turns on him like a wolf and
bawls him out and scares Schultz silly. But later the captain
apologizes because as a gin player he is bound to respect the right
of a kibitzer.</p>

<p>I keep waiting for Kunz to slip in questions to me about our Air
Force and one thing and another, but he never makes a remark that
is not in connection with the game and finally I can see that my
suspicions are unfounded and that he is nothing but a gin player
after all.</p>

<p>Well, daylight is coming through the windows of the house when
the captain says we must knock off playing, and Schultz must hurry
me back to camp, and I am somewhat startled to realize that I am
four hundred marks loser which I whip out and pay immediately.
Furthermore, Schultz is terribly depressed by this situation and
all the way back to the camp he keeps telling me how I disappoint
him in not winning and asking me what becomes of my mechanics, and
finally I get sore and speak to him as follows:</p>

<p>"Schultz," I say, "the guy is not only better than a raw hand at
gin but he also outlucks me. And I tell you I do not know of any
mechanics in gin rummy and if you do not care to trust to my
superior skill to finally prevail, you can call it all off
now."</p>

<p>Then Schultz cools down a little and says maybe I will do better
next time, but I judge his disappointment is communicated to the
other German soldiers as they seem very crusty with me all day
though my greatest trouble is standing off the questions of my own
gang about my absence.</p>

<p>Well, Schultz is around after me again that night to take me to
the house in the grove, and in fact every night for a month
hand-running I play the captain and it is not long before I am
beating him like breaking sticks. And every night the captain pays
off like a slot machine and every day I turn my dough over to
Schultz and he pays me twenty-five per cent. and then distributes
the balance among the guys in his syndicate.</p>

<p>Naturally, I stand first-class with all the Jerries who are in
on the play and they also become more pleasant towards my comrades
and finally I tell these comrades what is going on and while they
are greatly amused I can see that they are also greatly relieved,
because it seems they are troubled by my nightly absences from the
camp and are glad to learn that it is only for the purpose of
playing gin with the enemy.</p>

<p>At the end of the month and basing my estimate on a round ten
thousand marks I have stashed away, I figure I am forty thousand
marks winner on Kunz. Then one night I beat him for a thousand
marks and he does not whip it out as usual but says something in
German to Schultz, and Schultz tells me the captain says he forgets
his wallet somewhere, and I say all right, but that it is only fair
for him to give me a scratch for the dough.</p>

<p>Schultz translates this to the captain, who looks very angry and
seems to be highly insulted, but finally he outs with a notebook
and scribbles an I.O.U., because, of course, at this stage of my
life I am not trusting anyone and especially a Nazi.</p>

<p>He settles the next night before we start playing, but he takes
a good bath this time and gives me the finger again, and while he
comes alive the following night, this continues to happen again and
again, and something tells me that Kunz is troubled with the
shorts. When I mention this suspicion to Schultz, he seems a trifle
uneasy and finally he says:</p>

<p>"Well, Lace," he says, "I fear you are right. I fear our good
captain is in over his head. To tell the truth, your game is
commencing to bore me and the other soldiers of the Fatherland no
little because the captain borrows money from us every day, which
is a terrible thing for a high officer to do to the soldiers of his
command, and, while you win it back for us promptly, we now fear he
will never replace the principal."</p>

<p>"Why, Schultz," I say, "do you not tell me that the captain is
richer than six feet down in Mississippi mud?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Schultz says, "and he keeps talking of his properties in
Berlin, but we are nonetheless uneasy. And the worst thing about it
is that your twenty-five per cent. is eating up all the funds in
circulation. It is a vicious circle. Lace," Schultz says, "can you
spare me a couple of thou? I must send something to my frau and I
will repay you when the boats get to running again."</p>

<p>"Schultz," I say, "your story smacks of corn because I do not
believe you have a wife and, if you do have one you will never be
sending her money. But," I say, "I will advance you a thousand
marks for old times' sake on your marker."</p>

<p>So I weed him the thousand and accept his Kathleen Mavourneen,
which is a promise to pay that may be for years and may be forever,
and the reason I do this is because I am by no means certain that
Schultz may not incite his fellow soldiers to gang up and deprive
me of my hard-earned twenty-five per cent. by force, if he can find
out where I have it carefully buried. To tell the truth, I do not
repose great confidence in Schultz.</p>

<p>Well, that night I beat Kunz for twelve hundred marks, and he
pays me five hundred on account, and as Schultz and I are getting
ready to leave, he says something in German to Schultz, and when we
are on our way back to camp, Schultz tells me he has to return to
the house and see the captain, and then I really commence to worry
because I fear the two may get their heads together and plot
against my well-being.</p>

<p>But as far as Captain Kunz is concerned, my worry is groundless
as along towards noon of this same day, we hear a rumour that he
commits suicide by shooting himself smack-dab through the head and
this causes so much excitement that our guards forget to lock us in
that night or even to watch us carefully, and all of us Americans
and some of the British walk out of the gates and scatter over the
country-side, and most of us reach safety in Switzerland, and I
afterwards hear there is quite a scandal in German circles about
the matter.</p>

<p>But before we go, I have a slight chat with Schultz and say to
him like this:</p>

<p>"Schultz," I say, "tell me all."</p>

<p>"Well," Schultz says, "I know that when the captain asks me to
return to the house after taking you back to camp, he wishes to
borrow the money I get from you to play you again to-night, because
when I tell him yesterday I am personally broke and cannot advance
him any more, he is the one who suggests I approach you for a touch
and in fact he threatens to make trouble for me over certain
matters that transpire in Poland if I fail to do so.</p>

<p>"So," Schultz says, "when I reach the house, I first peer
through a window into the living-room and see the captain still
sitting at the table with the deck of cards you use spread out
before him as if he is examining them, and all of a sudden, I am
seized with a terrible fury at the thought that he is waiting there
to take my money to gamble it away frivolously, and an impulse that
I cannot restrain causes me to out with my pistol and give it to
him through the window and also through the onion.</p>

<p>"And," Schultz says, "I will always remember how the blood drips
down off the table and splatters over the nine of diamonds that is
lying on the floor under your chair and how it comes to my mind
that the nine of diamonds is considered a very unlucky card indeed
and how fortune-tellers say it is a sign of death. It is a great
coincidence," Schultz says, "considering the number of times you
catch the captain with big counts in his hands when he is waiting
for that very nine."</p>

<p>"Ah," I say, "I figure you have something to do with his
demise."</p>

<p>"But," Schultz says, "as far as anyone but you and me know, it
is suicide because I also have the presence of mind to fire one
shot from his pistol which is the same make as mine, and leave it
in his hand. It is suicide because of despondency, which his
superior officers say is probably because he learns of his
impending purge."</p>

<p>"Schultz," I say, "you are bound to come to a bad end but now
good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," Schultz says. "Oh, yes," he says. "Maybe I ought to
state that I am also prompted to my act by the fear that the
captain will finally find the nine of diamonds on the floor, that
you forget to retrieve when you leave him this morning."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Schultz?" I say.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," Schultz says.</p>

<p>And this is all there is to the story (The Lacework Kid
says).</p>

<p>"Well, Lace," I say, "it is all very exciting, and it must be
nice to be back on Broadway as free as the birds and with all that
moolouw you collect as your twenty-five per cent. in your pants
pockets."</p>

<p>"Oh," Lace says, "I do not return with a white quarter. You see
I use all my end to bribe Schultz and the rest of the German
soldiers to leave the doors and gates unlocked that night and to be
looking the other way when we depart."</p>

<p>Then The Lacework Kid leaves, and I am sitting there finishing
my boiled yellow pike, which is a very tasty dish, indeed, and
thinking about the captain's blood dripping on the nine of
diamonds, when who comes up but old Kidneyfoot the waiter, who is
called by this name because he walks as if he has kidneys in both
feet and who points to Lace going out the door and says to me like
this:</p>

<p>"Well," Kidneyfoot says, "there goes a great artist. He is one
of the finest card players I ever see except in gin rummy. It is
strange how this simple game baffles all good card players. In
fact," Kidneyfoot says, "The Lacework Kid is a rank sucker at gin
until I instruct him in one manoeuvre that gives you a great
advantage, which is to drop any one card to the floor accidentally
on purpose."</p>

<h2><a name="BLONDE_MINK" id="BLONDE_MINK">24. BLONDE MINK</a>
</h2>

<p>Now of course there are many different ways of cooking tripe but
personally I prefer it stewed with tomatoes and mushrooms and a bit
of garlic and in fact I am partaking of a portion in this form in
Mindy's restaurant on Broadway one evening in January when a
personality by the name of Julie the Starker sits down at my table
and leans over and sniffs my dish and says to me like this:</p>

<p>"Tripe," he says. "With garlic," he says. "Why, this is
according to the recipe of the late Slats Slavin who obtains it
from his old Aunt Margaret in Troy. Waiter," he says, "bring me an
order of this delicious concoction only with more garlic. It is
getting colder outside and a guy needs garlic in his system to
thicken his blood. Well," he says, "this is indeed a coincidence
because I just come from visiting the late Slats and having a small
chat with him."</p>

<p>Naturally I am somewhat surprised by this statement as I know
the late Slats is resting in Woodlawn Cemetery and to tell the
truth I remember I am present as a pallbearer when he is placed
there to rest, but I am also pleased to hear these tidings as Slats
is always a good friend of mine and no nicer guy ever steps in shoe
leather.</p>

<p>"Well," I say to Julie, "and how is Slats these days?"</p>

<p>"He is cold," Julie says. "He states that it is very crimpy
around the edges up there in Woodlawn especially at night. You know
the late Slats always hates cold weather. He is usually in Florida
by this time of year to duck the chill.</p>

<p>"Furthermore," Julie says, "he is greatly embarrassed up there
without a stone over him such as Beatrice promises to get him. He
says it makes him feel like a bum with nothing to show who he is
when all around him are many fine markers including one of black
marble to the memory of the late Cockeyed Corrigan, who, as you
know, is of no consequence compared to the late Slats who is really
somebody."</p>

<p>Well, of course this is very true because the late Slats is
formerly known and esteemed by one and all on Broadway as one of
the smartest operators in horse racing that ever draws breath. He
is a handicapper by trade and his figures on the horses that are
apt to win are so highly prized that one night he is stuck up by a
couple of guys when he has six thou in cash money on him, but all
they want is his figures on the next day's races.</p>

<p>He is a player and a layer. He will bet on the horses himself
when he sees spots he fancies or he will let you bet him on them
and he has clients all over the United States who call him up at
his office on Broadway and transact business with him one way or
the other. He is a tall guy in his late forties who is not much
thicker than a lath which is why he is called Slats though his
first name is really Terence.</p>

<p>He is by no means Mr. America for looks but he dresses well and
he is very rapid with a dollar. He is the softest touch in town for
busted guys and he will get up in the middle of the night to do
somebody a favour, consequently no one gets more or larger hellos
along the main drag than the late Slats.</p>

<p>He comes from a little burg upstate by the name of Cohoes and I
hear that he and Julie the Starker are friends from their
short-pants days there, although Julie is about the last one in the
world you will expect to see a guy of class like Slats associating
with as Julie is strictly in the muggola department.</p>

<p>He is about Slats' age and is short and thick and has a kisser
that is surely a pain to even his own mama. He is called Julie the
Starker because starker means a strong rough guy and there is no
doubt that Julie answers this description in every manner, shape
and form.</p>

<p>He is at one time in his life a prize fighter but strictly a
catcher which is a way of saying he catches everything the other
guy throws at him and at other times he is a bouncer; I do not know
what all else except that he has some Sing Sing background.</p>

<p>At all times he is a most undesirable personality but he is very
fond of the late Slats Slavin and vice versa, and they get along
together in a way that is most astonishing to behold.</p>

<p>He is not only a handy guy for Slats but he is also a social
companion and for some years wherever you see Slats you are apt to
see Julie the Starker except when Slats is with his fiancée, Miss
Beatrice Gee and even then you may see Julie though as a rule Miss
Beatrice Gee does not approve of him any more than she does of
leprosy. In fact, she makes no bones about considering the very
sight of Julie revolting to her.</p>

<p>In addition to being the late Slats' fiancée, Miss Beatrice Gee
is at this time a prominent show girl in one of Mike Todd's musical
shows and she is conceded by one and all to be the most beautiful
object on Manhattan Island or anyway no worse than a photo finish
for the most beautiful.</p>

<p>She is an original brunette and is quite tall and carries
herself in a way that the late Slats says is dignity, though it
really comes of Mike Todd's director putting a big copy of the
Bible on her head and saying she will either learn to walk
balancing it or else, though he never does tell her or else
what.</p>

<p>Other dolls call Miss Beatrice Gee a clothes horse because it
seems she wears clothes with great skill, and furthermore she is
crazy about them although her best hold is not wearing them, which
she also does with great skill but of course only on the stage.
When she is not on the stage she is always groomed like a stake
horse going to the post for a big race, and no one takes greater
pride in her appearance than the late Slats Slavin, except Miss
Beatrice Gee herself.</p>

<p>While I do not believe the story that once when she has a
headache and Doc Kelton puts his thermometer in her mouth, to see
if she is running a temperature, the mercury freezes tight, there
is no doubt that Beatrice is not the emotional type and to be very
frank about the matter many think she is downright frosty. But of
course, no one ever mentions this to the late Slats because he is
greatly in love and the chances are he maybe thinks Beatrice is
hotter than a stove and personally I am in no position to deny
it.</p>

<p>Well, in much less time than it takes me to tell you all this,
Julie the Starker has his tripe and is eating it with more sound
than is altogether necessary for tripe no matter how it is cooked
and to tell the truth I have to wait until he pauses before I can
make him hear my voice above his eating. Then I say to him like
this:</p>

<p>"Why, Julie," I say, "I cannot understand why Slats is in the
plight you describe with reference to the stone. I am under the
impression that he leaves Beatrice well loaded as far as the
do-re-mi is concerned and I take it for granted that she handles
the stone situation. By the way, Julie," I say, "does Slats say
anything to you about any horses anywhere for to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No," Julie says. "But if you have a minute to spare I will tell
you the story of Beatrice and her failure to take care of the
matter of the stone for the late Slats. It is really a great
scandal."</p>

<p>Then without waiting to hear if I have a minute to spare or not,
he starts telling me, and it seems it all goes back to a night in
late September when Beatrice informs Slats that she just comes upon
a great bargain in a blonde mink coat for twenty-three thousand
dollars and that she desires same at once to keep herself warm
during the impending winter although she already has enough fur
coats in her closet to keep not only herself warm but half of
Syracuse, too.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Julie," I say at this point, "but what is a blonde
mink?"</p>

<p>"Why," Julie says, "that is the very question Slats asks and he
learns from Beatrice that it is a new light-coloured mink fur that
is sometimes called blue mink and sometimes platinum mink and
sometimes blonde mink and he also learns that no matter what it is
called, it is very, very expensive, and after Slats gets all this
info he speaks to Beatrice as follows:</p>

<p>"'Baby,' he says, 'you cut right to the crimp when you mention
twenty-three thou because that is exactly the size of the bank roll
at this moment. But I just come off a tough season and I will need
all my ready for navigating purposes the next few months and
besides it looks like a mild winter and you can wear your old last
season's leopard or caracul or ermine or Persian lamb or beaver
until I get going again.'"</p>

<p>Now at this (Julie the Starker says) Beatrice flies into a
terrible rage and tells Slats that he is a tightwad and a skinflint
and a miser, and that he has no heart and no pride or he will not
suggest that she go around in such shabby old floogers and that she
will never humiliate herself in this manner. She says if she waits
even a few minutes, someone else is sure to snap up the blonde mink
and that she may never again meet with a similar opportunity.</p>

<p>"Well, they have a large quarrel," Julie says, "and when Slats
and I get back to his hotel apartment that night he complains of
not feeling any too well and in fact he finally keels over on the
bed with his tongue hanging out and I send for Doc Kelton who says
it is a heart attack and very bad.</p>

<p>"He says to tell the truth it is 100 to 1 Slats will not beat it
and then Doc takes his departure stating that he has so many
shorter-priced patients he cannot afford to waste time on long
shots and he leaves it to me to notify Slats that his number is
up.</p>

<p>"On receiving this information, Slats requests me to find Miss
Beatrice Gee and bring her to his bedside, which I do, although at
first she is much opposed to leaving her table in the Stork Club
where she is the centre of a gay throng, until I whisper to her
that I will be compelled to flatten her and carry her unless she
does.</p>

<p>"But on arriving at Slats' apartment and realizing that he is
indeed an invalid, Beatrice seems to be quite downcast and starts
to shed tears all over the joint, and I have no doubt that some of
them are on the level because surely she must remember how kind
Slats is to her.</p>

<p>"Then Slats says he wishes to talk to Beatrice alone and
requests me to go into the next room, but of course I have a crack
in the door so I can hear what goes on between them and what I hear
is Slats saying to Beatrice like this:</p>

<p>"'Baby,' he says, 'reach in under my pillow and get the package
of currency there. It is the twenty-three I tell you about and it
is all the dough I have in the world. It is all yours except
twenty-six hundred which you are to pay Clancy Brothers the
tombstone makers in Yonkers for a stone I pick out for myself some
time ago and forget to pay for although my plot in Woodlawn is free
and clear.</p>

<p>"'It is a long stone of white Carrara marble in excellent
taste,' Slats says. 'It is to lie flat over my last resting place,
not to stand upright, and it is cut to exactly cover same from end
to end and side to side. I order it in this form,' Slats says,
'because I am always a restless soul and long have a fear I may not
lie quietly in my last resting place but may wish to roam around
unless there is a sort of lid over me such as this stone. And
besides,' he says, 'it will keep the snow off me. I loathe and
despise the snow. I will leave the engraving to you, Baby, but
promise you will take care of the stone at once.'</p>

<p>"Well, I hear Beatrice promise between sobs, and also no doubt
as she is reaching under the pillow for Slats's plant and when I
step back into the room a little later, Slats is a goner and
Beatrice is now really letting the salt water flow freely, although
her best effort is in Woodlawn two days later when it looks as if
we will have to send for a siphon to unflood the premises.</p>

<p>"But to show you what a smart strudel Beatrice is, she is around
the day after we place the late Slats to rest saying that he does
not leave her a thin dime. You see, she is figuring against the
chance that relatives of Slats may show up and clam his estate and
she even lets Slats' lodge pay the funeral expenses although of
course this is no more than is coming to any departed brother.</p>

<p>"I do not dispute her statement because I think she is entitled
to the dough as long as Slats gives it to her, and of course I take
it for granted that she will split herself out from enough of the
swag to buy the stone according to her promise, and in fact I am so
sure of this that one afternoon last week I go out to Woodlawn not
only to pay my respects to the memory of the late Slats but to see
how his last resting place looks with the stone over it.</p>

<p>"Well, what do I see but Slats himself walking around and around
a mound of dried earth with some withered flowers scattered over it
and among these flowers I recognize my own wreath which says 'So
long, pal' on it and which costs me a double-saw, but there is no
stone whatsoever over the mound, not even as much as a weentsy
little pebble."</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Julie," I say. "You state that you see the late
Slats walking around and about. Do you see him all pale and
vapoury?"</p>

<p>"Well," Julie says, "now you mention it, I do seem to recall
that Slats is a little on the pale side of what he used to be. But
he is otherwise unchanged except that he is not wearing his derby
hat as usual. We do not give him his derby hat when we place him to
rest, as the undertaker guy says it is not necessary. Anyway, when
he spies me, Slats stops walking and sits down on the edge of the
late Cock-eyed Corrigan's black marble marker, which is practically
next door to him and says to me like this:</p>

<p>"'Hello, Julie,' he says. 'I am commencing to wonder what
becomes of you. I am walking around here for weeks trying to keep
warm and I am all tuckered out. What do you suppose is the idea of
not providing people with overcoats when they are placed to rest?
Only I do not rest, Julie. Do you see Beatrice lately and what does
she say about my stone?'</p>

<p>"'Slats,' I say, 'I must confess I do not see Beatrice lately,
but I never dream she does not provide the stone long before this
as per her promise which I can tell you now I overhear her make to
you. A solemn deathbed promise.'</p>

<p>"'Never mind what kind of bed it is,' Slats says. 'It is a
morbid topic. And I think you have plenty of gall to be on the Erie
when I am saying my last good-bye to my baby. You owe us both an
apology. Look her up right away and give her a good one and ask her
what about my stone. The chances are there is a hitch somewhere.
Maybe the engraving is causing the delay. I am sure Beatrice will
wish something sentimental on it like Sleep well my beloved, and
engraving takes time.'</p>

<p>"Well, I am about to mention that she already takes time enough
to have George Washington's farewell address engraved on it but all
of a sudden the late Slats disappears from sight and I take this as
a hint for me to blow, too, and that very night I hunt up Beatrice
to give her Slats' message.</p>

<p>"I find her standing at the bar of a gaff called the Palmetto
with a couple of guys and I notice she is wearing a fur coat the
colour of mist that I do not remember ever seeing on her before and
I turn to a dame who is sitting at a table and say to her like
this:</p>

<p>"'Pardon me, little miss,' I say, 'but just to satisfy my
curiosity, can you tell me the name of the fur that party over
yonder is wearing?'</p>

<p>"'Blonde mink,' she says. 'It is perfectly beautiful too.'</p>

<p>"'And what does such a garment cost?' I ask.</p>

<p>"'Why,' she says, 'that one seems to be first-class merchandise.
It costs twenty-five thousand dollars. Maybe more, but not much
less. It is the very newest fur out.'</p>

<p>"Then I walk over to Beatrice and tap her on the shoulder, and
when she turns I motion her out of hearing distance of the guys she
is with and speak to her as follows:</p>

<p>"'Well, Bea,' I say, 'your new coat must hang a little heavy on
you considering that it represents the weight of a nice tombstone.
I never mention it to you before but I hear your last chat with the
late Slats Slavin including your promise but until I find you in
this lovely benny no one will ever make me believe you mean to
welch on your word.'</p>

<p>"'All right, all right,' she says. 'So I do not buy the stone.
But it costs twenty-six hundred and all I have is twenty-three
thousand and an odd tenner and this coat is a steal at
twenty-three. If I wait another minute longer someone else is sure
to snap it up and the dealer wants his all cash. Besides Slats will
never know he does not get the stone.'</p>

<p>"'Bea,' I say, 'I have a talk with Slats to-day at Woodlawn. He
knows he has no stone and he is upset about it. But he is making
excuses for you, Bea. He figures you are unexpectedly delayed a bit
in getting it there. You have the guy fooled even yet.'</p>

<p>"At this Beatrice gazes at me for some time without saying a
word and I notice that looking into her eyes is just the same as
looking into a couple of ice cubes. Then she gives her coat a
twitch and brings it closer around her and finally she says:</p>

<p>"'Julie,' she says, 'I want to tell you something. If ever again
you speak to me or about me I will start remembering out loud that
Slats has a large bundle of cash on him that last night and I will
also start wondering out loud what becomes of it and a guy with
your biography cannot stand much wonderment such as that. And if
you see Slats again tell him how I look in my new coat.'</p>

<p>"'Bea,' I say, 'you will never have any luck with your new coat
because it means leaving poor Slats up there in Woodlawn restless
and cold.'</p>

<p>"'No luck?' she says. 'Listen,' she says, 'do you see the
dopey-looking little punk in the uniform leaning against the bar?
His name is Freddy Voogan and his papa is a squillionaire out in
Denver and I am going to marry the kid any minute and what do you
think gets him for me? My blonde mink. He notices how nice I look
in it and insists on meeting me. No luck?' Beatrice says. 'Is
kicking up a gold mine no luck?'</p>

<p>"'Bea,' I say, 'it is bad enough to rob the grave as you already
do but it is even worse to rob the cradle.'</p>

<p>"'Good-bye, Julie,' Bea says. 'Do not forget to tell Slats how I
looked in my new coat.'</p>

<p>"Well, I will say she looks wonderful in it even though I am
greatly disappointed in her because it is plain to be seen that
Beatrice has no sentiment about the past. So now I am compelled to
report back to the late Slats Slavin that he is on a bust as far as
the stone is concerned and I hope and trust that my revelation will
not cause him too much anguish."</p>

<p>And with this, Julie the Starker dunks up the last of the tripe
gravy on his plate with a piece of rye bread and gets up to take
his departure and I say to him like this:</p>

<p>"Julie," I say, "if you happen to think of it, kindly ask the
late Slats to look over the entries at Hialeah for the next few
days and if he can send me a winner now and then I can get parties
to bet a little for me."</p>

<p>"Well," Julie says, "Slats has other things on his mind besides
horses right now, but," he says, "I will try to remember your
request although of course you will carry me for a small piece of
your end."</p>

<p>Then he leaves me and I am still sitting there when a plain
clothes copper by the name of Johnny Brannigan comes in and sits
down in the chair Julie just vacates and orders some Danish pastry
and a cup of Java, and then almost as if he hears the conversation
between Julie and me he says:</p>

<p>"Oh, hello," he says. "How well do you know Miss Beatrice Gee
who is formerly the fiancée of the late Slats Slavin? I mean how
well do you know her history and most especially do you know any
knocks against her?"</p>

<p>"Why?" I say.</p>

<p>"Well," Johnny says, "it is strictly an unofficial question.
There is hell up Ninth Street over her. A family out in Denver that
must have more weight than Pike's Peak gets the Denver police
department to ask our department very quietly about her, and our
department requests me to make a few inquiries.</p>

<p>"Of course it is not an official police matter. It is an
exchange of courtesies.</p>

<p>"It seems," Johnny says, "that Miss Beatrice Gee is going to
marry a member of this family who is under twenty-one years of age
and his papa and mamma are doing handstands about it, though
personally," Johnny says, "I believe in letting love take its
course. But," he says, "my theory has nothing to do with the fact
that I promise to make a return of some kind on this blintz."</p>

<p>"Well, Johnny," I say, "I do not know anything whatever about
her but you just miss a guy who can probably give you a complete
run-down on her. You just miss Julie the Starker. However," I say,
"I am pretty sure to run into him to-morrow and will tell him to
contact you."</p>

<p>But I do not see Julie the next day or for several days after
that and I am greatly disappointed as I not only wish to tell him
to get in touch with Johnny, but I am anxious to learn if Slats
sends me any info on the horses. For that matter I do not see
Johnny Brannigan either until late one afternoon I run into him on
Broadway and he says to me like this:</p>

<p>"Say," he says, "you are just the guy I am looking for. Do you
see the late editions of the blats?"</p>

<p>"No," I say, "why?"</p>

<p>"Well," Johnny says, "they are carrying big stories about the
finding of Miss Beatrice Gee in her apartment in East 57th Street
as dead as a doornail. It looks as if the young guy from Denver she
is going to marry bounces a big bronze lamp off her coco in what
the scribes will undoubtedly call a fit of jealous rage because he
has a big row with her early in the evening in the Canary Club when
he finds a Marine captain from the Pacific teaching her how the
island natives in those parts rub noses when they greet each other,
although the young guy claims he walks away from her then and does
not see her again because he is too busy loading himself up with
champagne.</p>

<p>"But," Johnny says, "he is found unconscious from the champagne
in his hotel room to-day and admits he does not remember when or
where or what or why. My goodness," Johnny says, "the champagne
they sell nowadays is worse than an anæsthetic."</p>

<p>Naturally this news about Miss Beatrice Gee is quite distressing
to me if only because of her former association with the late Slats
Slavin and I am sorry to hear of the young guy's plight, too, even
though I do not know him. I am always sorry to hear of young guys
in trouble and especially rich young guys but of course if they
wish to mix bronze lamps with champagne they must take the
consequences and I so state to Johnny Brannigan.</p>

<p>"Well," Johnny says, "he does not seem to be the bronze-lamp
type, and yet who else has a motive to commit this deed? You must
always consider the question of motive in crimes of this
nature."</p>

<p>"What about robbery?" I say.</p>

<p>"No," Johnny says, "All her jewellery and other belongings are
found in the apartment. The only thing missing as far as her maid
and acquaintances can tell seems to be a new fur coat which she
probably leaves some place in her wanderings during the evening.
But now I remember why I am looking for you. I am still collecting
data on Miss Beatrice Gee's background though this time officially
and I recall you tell me that maybe Julie the Starker can give me
some information and I wish to know where I am apt to find
Julie."</p>

<p>"A new fur coat, Johnny?" I say. "Well," I say, "as a rule I am
not in favour of aiding and abetting coppers but this matter seems
different and if you will take a ride with me I think I may be able
to lead you to Julie."</p>

<p>So I call a taxicab and as we get in, I tell the jockey to drive
us to Woodlawn Cemetery and if Johnny Brannigan is surprised by our
destination he does not crack but whiles away the time on the
journey by relating many of his experiences as a copper, some of
which are very interesting.</p>

<p>It is coming on dusk when we reach Woodlawn and while I have an
idea of the general direction of the late Slats Slavin's last
resting place, I have to keep the taxi guy driving around inside
the gates for some time before I spot the exact location through
recognizing the late Cockeyed Corrigan's black marble marker.</p>

<p>It is a short distance off the auto roadway so I have the hackie
stop and Johnny Brannigan and I get out of the cab to walk a few
yards to the mound and as we approach same who steps out from the
shadow of the late Cockeyed Corrigan's marker but Julie the Starker
who speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>"Hello, hello," he says. "I am glad to see you and I know you
will be pleased to learn that the late Slats gives me a tip for you
on a horse that goes at Hialeah to-morrow but the name escapes me
at the moment. He says his figures make it an absolute kick in the
pants. Well," Julie says, "stick around a while and maybe I will
remember it."</p>

<p>Then he seems to notice the presence of Johnny Brannigan for the
first time and to recognize him, too, because all of a sudden he
outs with Captain Barker and says:</p>

<p>"Oh, a copper, eh!" he says. "Well, copper, here is a little
kiss for you."</p>

<p>And with this he lets go a slug that misses Johnny Brannigan and
knocks an arm off a pink stone cherub in the background and he is
about to encore when Johnny blasts ahead of him, and Julie the
Starker drops his pizzloover and his legs begin bending under him
like Leon Errol's when Leon is playing a drunk.</p>

<p>He finally staggers up to the last resting place of the late
Slats Slavin and falls there with the blood pumping from the hole
that Johnny Brannigan drills in his chest and as I notice his lips
moving I hasten to his side figuring that he may be about to utter
the name of the horse Slats gives him for me.</p>

<p>Then I observe that there is something soft and fuzzy spread out
on the mound under him that Julie the Starker pats weakly with one
hand as he whispers to me like this:</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "the late Slats is not only resting in peace
now with the same as his stone over him but he is as warm as toast
and in fact warmer."</p>

<p>"The horse, Julie," I say. "What is the name of the horse?"</p>

<p>But Julie only closes his eyes and as it is plain to be seen
that he now joins out permanently with the population of Woodlawn,
Johnny Brannigan steps forward and rolls him off the mound with his
foot and picks up the object that is under Julie and examines it in
the dim light.</p>

<p>"I always think Julie is a little stir-crazy," Johnny says, "but
I wonder why he takes a pop at me when all I want of him is to ask
him some questions and I wonder too, where this nice red fox fur
coat comes from?"</p>

<p>Well, of course I know that Johnny will soon realize that Julie
probably thinks Johnny wishes to chat with him about the job he
does on Miss Beatrice Gee but at the moment I am too provoked about
Julie holding out the tip the late Slats Slavin gives him for me to
discuss the matter or even to explain that the red is only Julie's
blood and that the coat is really blonde mink.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="BIG_BOY_BLUES" id="BIG_BOY_BLUES">25. BIG BOY
BLUES</a>
</h2>

<p>IT is along towards two o'clock one pleasant morning and things
are unusually quiet in Mindy's restaurant on Broadway and in fact
only two customers besides myself are present when who comes in
like a rush of air, hot or cold, but a large soldier crying out in
a huge voice as follows:</p>

<p>"Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello."</p>

<p>Well, when I take a good glaum at him I can see that he is
nobody but a personality by the name of West Side Willie who is
formerly a ticket speculator on Broadway and when he comes over to
me still going hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, I say to him
quite severely like this:</p>

<p>"Willie," I say, "you are three hellos over what anybody is
entitled to in Mindy's even if there is anybody here which as you
can see for yourself is by no means the situation."</p>

<p>"Oh," Willie says, "I happen to have a few hellos to spare and
besides I am so glad to get back on the big street again that I
feel liberal. We are here for a run."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the war?" I say.</p>

<p>"I mean <i>Gee Eyes</i>, the soldier show I am with," Willie
says. "We are a riot on the Coast. We lay them in the aisles in
Denver. We kill the people in Cleveland. We will do a wonderful
trade here."</p>

<p>Then Willie sits down and explains to me that one day when he is
in a camp in the desert out in California and practically dying by
inches of the heat and the drilling and the victuals and the other
hardships of soldier life and especially the victuals, his
commanding officer sends for him and says:</p>

<p>"Klump," he says, for such is West Side Willie's family
monicker, "they are organizing an all-soldier musical show at Santa
Ana and there is a request out for the names of all enlisted men in
this area who are formerly connected with show business.</p>

<p>"I understand," the commanding officer says, "that you are
familiar with matters of this nature and you will therefore report
at once to Santa Ana to participate although personally," he says,
"I consider it all just so much fol-de-rol and how the hell we can
win the war behind the footlights I do not know."</p>

<p>Well, naturally Willie does not inform the commanding officer
that his connection with show business is slightly informal but he
gets on a train at once and goes to Santa Ana and there he
discovers that the guy who is putting on the show is nobody but a
playwright by the name of Hathaway Go who is once befriended by
Willie to the extent of a meal in a one-arm gaff in West
Forty-ninth and who is grateful ever since.</p>

<p>He is slightly surprised to see Willie appear in answer to a
call for show people as he is aware that Willie does not sing or
dance or play an instrument but after hearing Willie's description
of soldier life in the desert his heart is touched and he says he
guesses he can use a sure-footed guy to take tickets although when
Willie asks what about selling them Hathaway Go gives him such a
long slow look that Willie never renews the subject.</p>

<p>However, he is greatly downcast when he thinks of the
opportunities in connection with these pasteboards because he feels
that everyone will want them and when Willie is in action on
Broadway he is known far and wide for his skill in manipulating
with tickets to theatres and prize fights and hockey games and one
thing and another that everyone wants but are unable to get unless
they see Willie and pay his ice, which is a way of saying his
premiums.</p>

<p>I often hear complaints that sometimes Willie asks more ice than
the face value of the tickets but this is probably only for tickets
that are very hard indeed to get and naturally Willie is entitled
to some compensation for saving the customers the trouble of
standing in line at the box offices to buy the tickets and then
finding the tickets are all gone anyway. Besides Willie frequently
has to take care of others out of his end to get the tickets in the
first place so life is really not all ice with him.</p>

<p>"Well," Willie says, "I make the best of the position to which I
am appointed although I must say the spectacle of throngs of
customers being permitted to buy our tickets at face value at the
box office when they will be delighted to pay two, three, four,
five or six slugs premium if they cannot get them any other way is
most disheartening to me.</p>

<p>"But," Willie says, "I become a terrific ticket taker. In fact,"
he says, "I am known as the Eisenhower of the front door.
Furthermore, this assignment comes to me in nick of time because my
original outfit is sent to Europe where I understand the victuals
are even worse than they are in camp and there is practically no
hotel life for an enlisted man."</p>

<p>"Willie," I say, "I am glad to see you again and I congratulate
you on your military career and hope and trust you do not sustain
any wounds such as tearing off a hangnail by mistake for the stub
of a ticket some night. I am sure that your engagement on Broadway
will be most auspicious."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Willie says, "but we are all nervous and worried over
a situation that develops here. Do you remember Johnny Blues? The
one they call Big Boy Blues?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," I say. "I remember him as well as if he is my
brother only I am thankful such is not the case."</p>

<p>"Do you know Big Boy Blues has a son?" Willie says.</p>

<p>"Yes," I say, "I know it. They call him Little Boy Blues."</p>

<p>"Well," Willie says, "Little Boy Blues is the star of our show.
He is the greatest thing in it. He slays the customers. He is
wonderful."</p>

<p>"Why, Willie," I say, "I am glad to hear this news. I not only
remember Big Boy Blues but come to think of it I remember his
ever-loving sheriff who is the mamma of Little Boy Blues, I hope.
If he has any talent it must come from her because the only talent
Big Boy Blues ever has that I recall is that he can crush a human
skull with one blow of his fist even though the skull belongs to a
copper.</p>

<p>"In fact," I say, "I recall the night he performs this feat on a
copper by the name of Caswell. I seem to remember that Caswell is
in Polyclinic hospital for eight weeks but he finally recovers and
is now a captain."</p>

<p>"Listen," Willie says, "Little Boy Blues appears in our show as
a female ballet dancer. He dresses as a dame in a short skirt and
one thing and another."</p>

<p>Well, at this I am slightly horrified as I can see what West
Side Willie has in mind. I can see that it is going to be a great
shock to Big Boy Blues if he learns of the matter because it is
only about a year back that he is along Broadway bragging about his
son being in the Army and stating that Little Boy will undoubtedly
destroy a large number of the enemy single-handed.</p>

<p>Naturally, everybody agrees with him as Big Boy Blues strongly
disapproves of anyone not agreeing with him and it is plain to be
seen that after putting his son away as a destroyer he is apt to be
displeased when he finds Little Boy is not only a ballet dancer but
one in the attire of a doll and I so state to West Side Willie.</p>

<p>"Yes," Willie says, "that is exactly what we fear. We fear Big
Boy will be so vexed he will tear the theatre down stone by stone
and maybe peg the stones at us. However, it is our information from
Little Boy's mamma that Big Boy thinks his son is somewhere
overseas and has no idea he is in our show and it is our hope that
he does not hear of it until after opening night anyway.</p>

<p>"Then," Willie says, "we expect to be rolling so good that we
can replace Little Boy if necessary, but," he says, "we positively
need him for the first night because he is the best thing in the
show by seven or eight lengths and it is a great pity we dast not
give him some advance publicity. Well, I will bid you good night as
I must catch myself a few snores. Our company gets into Grand
Central at noon and I wish to be there to meet it."</p>

<p>Then Willie takes his departure and I remain sitting there
awhile thinking of what a great surprise it is to Broadway years
ago when Big Boy Blues hauls off and marries a small canape by the
name of Miss Rosie Flynn who is singing in the old Golden Slipper
Club in West Forty-eighth Street and how Bookie Bob goes around
offering to lay plenty of 9 to 5 that Big Boy gives her at least
two broken arms inside of two weeks and finding no takers as Big
Boy is known to one and all as a crude character.</p>

<p>He is at least six feet three inches high and he weighs anyway
220 pounds and he has a loud voice that causes parties four blocks
away to tremble when he lets it out and he has a record at police
headquarters that consists mainly of mayhem. He is a doorman and a
bouncer at the Golden Slipper when I first know him but one day he
climbs on the seat of a stray truck and drives it off and the next
thing anybody knows he has one of the largest trucking businesses
in the city.</p>

<p>Now Miss Rosie Flynn does not weigh ninety pounds with her
girdle on and she has red hair and freckles and is by no means a
spectacular singer but she is practically famous on Broadway
because it is generally conceded that she is pure. The chances are
she can marry into much more genteel circles than those in which
Big Boy Blues moves just on the strength of being pure and it is
the popular belief that Big Boy frightens her into marrying him as
no one can think of any other reason for this union.</p>

<p>Well, after they are married and before the stray truck comes
along to provide the keystone for Big Boy's success they live in a
small apartment as far over on West Forty-ninth Street as anyone
can live unless they live in a canoe in the North River and it is
by no means a fashionable neighbourhood but it is the best they can
do on their income in those days and it is there a son is born to
them who is so small that Big Boy is greatly mortified and slightly
perturbed.</p>

<p>In fact, he brings the child over on Broadway and goes around
peering into the faces of various Broadway personalities who infest
the Golden Slipper and then gazing closely at the child as if he is
making comparisons. I never see this child again and to tell the
truth I seldom see Big Boy Blues afterwards and then only when I do
not learn in advance that he is coming my way but I read now and
then in the blats about him slugging his truck drivers or somebody
else's truck drivers or just somebody else, so I judge he is the
same old Big Boy.</p>

<p>But as the years go on I occasionally run into Rosie Flynn who
seems to be fatting up somewhat in spots and she tells me that Big
Boy by no means admires the child that she now speaks of as Little
Boy Blues because he remains puny and scary but I can see that
Rosie thinks very well of him, indeed. In fact, Little Boy Blues is
all she talks about and as he gets older I learn from her that she
has him away at school as much as possible as he is a great eyesore
to Big Boy who keeps him frightened half to death by yelling at him
and sometimes giving him a few clops.</p>

<p>From what Rosie tells me, I judge Little Boy Blues is quite a
weakling and far from being a credit to a virile personality such
as Big Boy but when the war comes on and Little Boy is drafted, Big
Boy becomes very proud of him and wishes to be real fatherly
towards him.</p>

<p>In fact, one day at Dix where Little Boy Blues is stationed for
awhile, Big Boy approaches him with his hand extended to shake
hands and Little Boy is so alarmed that he turns and runs away and
keeps running until he is so far from camp that he is two days
finding his way back and is put down as AWOL.</p>

<p>Well, I become so interested in what West Side Willie tells me
about the show that I go to the Grand Central at noon myself the
next day to see the soldier company arrive and it is quite an
impressive scene as the members are in full marching gear with
rifles and all this and that and march from the station through the
streets to the theatre in West Forty-eight where the show is going
to open.</p>

<p>West Side Willie does not march with them but joins me in
following them only we stick to the sidewalk and people stop and
applaud the company and the members bow right and left and smile
and when I say to Willie that I consider this somewhat unmilitary,
he says:</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "you see most of these guys are professional
actors even if they are soldiers and they are bound to take bows
when they hear applause even if they are sitting in the electric
chair waiting for the guy to pull the switch."</p>

<p>He points out Little Boy Blues to me and I can see that he is
small and frail-looking and seems to be buckling slightly at the
knees from the weight of his pack and rifle and that he has red
hair like his mamma. I also see Rosie Flynn on the sidewalk ahead
of me following the march so I quit West Side Willie and overtake
her and say to her like this:</p>

<p>"Well, Rosie," I say, "I notice your offspring has your top
piece but the way he does not resemble Big Boy in any manner, shape
or form is really remarkable. By the way," I say, "how is Big Boy?
Not that I care, Rosie, but I wish to be polite."</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h-h!" she says and looks around as if she is afraid Big
Boy may be in earshot. "He is all right except his temper is
shorter than ever. He chucks one of his own truck drivers into the
river yesterday truck and all. I am so afraid of what will happen
if he learns Little Boy is in this show. You see," she says, "I
tell him the last time I hear from Little Boy he is with Coogan's
Cobras in the Pacific."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "you do not pick a soft spot for him, anyway.
Coogan's Cobras are supposed to be the fightingest outfit in our
Army."</p>

<p>"It is because I see the name in the newspapers so much," Rosie
says. "It pleases Big Boy to think Little Boy is in such company. I
pray he does not learn the truth before the show opens. Poor Big
Boy has no appreciation of the fine and delicate and artistic. I
often wake up at night in trembling at the thought of his anger if
he learns of the large fees I pay for Little Boy's dancing
instruction."</p>

<p>I commence trembling myself right then and there thinking of
such a situation and at this point I unload Rosie Flynn and go on
my way because I realize that if Big Boy learns of the fees she
mentions he may not only wipe out Rosie but anyone who ever even
knows her. To tell the truth, I am a little disappointed in Rosie
as I always figure her to have some sense and while I do not say it
is wrong for anybody's son to dance I consider it sinful to pay
fees to encourage him to do it.</p>

<p>Well, the day of the opening I am surprised more than no little
when West Side Willie hunts me up and gives me a skull, which is a
way of saying a free ticket for the show and I figure it must be
because business is not up to expectations but when I mention this
idea to Willie he becomes quite provoked.</p>

<p>"Why," he says, "we are sold out in advance for half the entire
engagement already. This show is the biggest thing since nylons. If
you examine your ducket you will observe that no seat is specified.
That means you have standing room only."</p>

<p>But standing room is by no means undesirable in a New York
theatre especially at openings because where you stand is in back
of the last row which places you in a position to leave quickly and
quietly in case the show is bad and this is where I am located for
the opening of <i>Gee Eyes</i>. I am a little late getting to the
theatre and the audience is pretty well seated when I arrive and as
I am going in West Side Willie who is taking tickets with great
skill holds back a Broadway columnist and his wife a minute and
says to me:</p>

<p>"What do you think we have with us to-night?" he says. "Why,
nobody but Colonel Billy Coogan, the commander of Coogan's Cobras.
He is a tall slim guy with a lot of ribbons on his chest and he is
in the third row centre."</p>

<p>"Yes," the columnist says. "He flies in from the Pacific only
to-day to get a new decoration to-morrow from the President in
Washington."</p>

<p>Naturally on taking my place in the rear of the house I spot
Colonel Coogan at once by his uniform away down front and I am
somewhat astonished to observe next to him a head and a pair of
shoulders that even at long distance and from behind I identify as
belonging to Big Boy Blues, and what is more he seems to be
chatting with Colonel Coogan.</p>

<p>I am standing there wondering about this spectacle but just then
the curtain opens and I dismiss the matter from my mind as I can
see at once that this is a pretty good show although personally I
like a little more sex appeal than it is possible to get into shows
in which all the performers are hairy-legged guys with no bims
whatever around.</p>

<p>The one thing I am looking for which is Little Boy Blues does
not come on until the finale and this is a very large number,
indeed, with the entire cast on stage when out comes a slim and
graceful young ballet dancer in a flaring short skirt and all who
can easily pass for a doll if you do not know it has to be a guy in
this company unless somebody makes a serious mistake.</p>

<p>I can see that the dancer is undoubtedly Little Boy Blues even
without looking at the programme to make sure and while I am by no
means a judge of ballet dancing and in fact can do without same
entirely in a pinch, I realize that he gives a great performance.
In fact, I realize that he is no doubt a genius at ballet dancing
and as the curtain closes on him the audience lets out a roar of
applause that I afterwards hear shakes the glasses off the back bar
in the gin mill next door to the theatre.</p>

<p>Then the curtain opens again as is always the case when there is
great applause and Little Boy Blues stands there on the stage
panting as if he just finishes a fast hundred yards and taking bows
with one hand on his stomach and also perspiring no little and the
audience applauds with even greater vigour than before and at this
moment I observe Big Boy Blues jump up from his seat down
front.</p>

<p>I notice his mouth is wide open so I judge he is yelling
something and thinks I to myself well, here it comes, although
there is too much noise for me to hear what he is yelling about,
and besides at almost the same instant he jumps up a guy in the
seat directly behind him jumps up too and practically
simultaneously with Big Boy's mouth opening a blackjack drops on
his sconce and Big Boy sinks back quietly in his seat. Then I
recognize the guy behind him as Captain Caswell in civilian
clothes.</p>

<p>Well, the uproar from the audience continues but of course it is
all over Little Boy Blues' dancing and no one notices what happens
to Big Boy although a couple of coppers come down the aisle and
lift him out of his seat and drag him away still unconscious.
Furthermore, no one pays any attention to Colonel Coogan who is up
on his feet and saying to everyone around him that the slugging of
Big Boy is the worst outrage since Pearl Harbour though no one
seems to listen to him.</p>

<p>By this time Little Boy Blues is panting and perspiring more
from taking bows than from his dancing so the curtain closes in on
him and the first act for good and nearly everyone in the audience
moves out into the lobby for the intermission to smoke and gas and
all they are gassing about is Little Boy's dancing. Then I see
Captain Caswell talking to Rosie Flynn in a corner of the lobby and
I get close enough to hear the captain say:</p>

<p>"Well, Rose," he says, "you certainly do the community a service
by requesting police protection here to-night. If it is not for
your warning and my skill with a jack we will have serious trouble
although to tell you the truth we have enough already with the guy
we commandeer the seat from behind Big Boy. I only hope and trust
that he does not have as much influence as he claims and anyway he
can have the seat now."</p>

<p>Then Colonel Coogan comes into the lobby still stating in a loud
voice that the jacking of Big Boy is a scandalous matter and that
somebody will hear from the War Department and maybe the OPI, too,
when Captain Caswell steps up to him and informs him that Big Boy
is jacked because he is about to start wrecking the joint in
discovering that his son is a dancer in the show.</p>

<p>"No, no," Colonel Coogan says. "There is a terrible error
somewhere. He knows his son is in the show all right because
someone calls him up this evening and gives him the information.
Mr. Blues introduces himself to me and tells me about it while we
are sitting there side by side waiting for the curtain. He does not
seem to know just what to think about his son being in the show at
first but he asks me as a special favour not to mention it to Mrs.
Blues if ever I happen to meet her because she thinks her son is
with my command and Mr. Blues fears it will break her heart if she
learns the truth."</p>

<p>"Colonel," Captain Caswell says, "I distinctly hear Big Boy yell
when he gets up from his seat and our experience with him in the
past is that he always prefaces his acts of violence by
yelling."</p>

<p>"Yes," Colonel Coogan says, "he yells all right, but so do I and
what we are both yelling is bravo."</p>

<p>At this point I hear a slight gasp behind me and on looking
around I observe that Rosie Flynn slumps to the floor in a dead
faint consequently there is more excitement during which I take my
departure without even waiting for the second act as my legs are
very tired from the standing room only.</p>

<p>I am again sitting in Mindy's restaurant along about three
o'clock in the morning still resting my legs when who comes in but
West Side Willie and I am most distressed to note that he has two
black eyes and swollen lips and that he seems greatly dishevelled
in every respect.</p>

<p>"Why, my good gracious, Willie," I say. "Do you get run over by
a tank division or what?"</p>

<p>"No," Willie says, "Big Boy Blues belts me. By the way," he
says, "everybody is all wrong about him crushing the human skull
with a single blow of his fist. He hits me on top of the head twice
with his right and only raises a contusion and I think he damages
his duke at that. However," Willie says, "it is only fair to say
Big Boy comes to the theatre to find me fresh from the hospital
after he is treated for the jacking he receives from Captain
Caswell and perhaps he does not have all his strength. He inflicts
most of my injuries with a left hook."</p>

<p>"Well, Willie," I say, "it shows you how Colonel Coogan is
deceived by Big Boy and Captain Caswell is right all the time. I
suppose Big Boy's fury over Little Boy being in <i>Gee Eyes</i>
flares up anew when he has time to think about it and no doubt he
assaults you as a representative of the show."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Willie says, "Big Boy is still all pleasured up over
Little Boy's performance, and what is more he and Little Boy and
Rosie Flynn are enjoying a happy and very loving family reunion but
Big Boy gets to brooding about the ticket speculator who calls him
up and tells him of Little Boy's presence in the show and hustles
him into buying a ticket for a hundred dollars which is about a
ninety-five dollar premium."</p>

<p>"I see," I say. "You are the speculator, of course."</p>

<p>"Well," Willie says, "I am stuck with a ticket that I pay six
dollars for myself and I happen to need a hundred and I know Big
Boy Blues will pay anything to get in the theatre if he hears
Little Boy is in the show although naturally I figure it will be
only to tear the place apart. But I also know Rosie Flynn arranges
for police protection so I do not see how he can do any harm even
if he is there.</p>

<p>"So," Willie says, "I call him up and promote him. It is more
than human nature can stand to let such an opportunity pass. But
besides getting belted I also undergo another slight misfortune
to-night. I am relieved of my job with the show and ordered to
Colonel Coogan's combat unit in the Pacific."</p>

<h2><a name="WHY_ME" id="WHY_ME">26. WHY ME?</a>
</h2>

<p>WHEN physical calamity befalls, the toughest thing for the
victim to overcome is the feeling of resentment that it should have
happened to him.</p>

<p>"Why me?" he keeps asking himself, dazedly. "Of all the millions
of people around, why me?"</p>

<p>It becomes like a pulse beat&mdash;"Why me? Why me? Why me?"</p>

<p>Sometimes he reviews his whole life step by step to see if he
can put his finger on some circumstance in which he may have been
at such grievous fault as to merit disaster.</p>

<p>Did he commit some black sin somewhere back down the years? Did
he betray the sacred trust of some fellow human being? Is he being
punished for some special wrongdoing?</p>

<p>"Why me?"</p>

<p>He wakes suddenly at night from a sound sleep to consciousness
of his affliction and to the clock-like ticking in his
brain&mdash;"Why me? Why me? Why me?"</p>

<p>He reflects, "Why not that stinker Smith? Why not that louse
Jones? Why not that bum Brown? Why me? Why me? Why me?"</p>

<p>Was he guilty of carelessness or error in judgment?</p>

<p>"Why me? Why? Why? Why?"</p>

<p>It is a question that has been asked by afflicted mortals
through the ages. It is being asked more than ever just now as the
maimed men come back from war broken in body and spirit and
completely bewildered, asking "Why me?"</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>I do not have the answer, of course. Not for myself nor for
anyone else. I, too, am just a poor mugg groping in the dark,
though sometimes I think of the words of young Elihu reproving Job
and his three pals: "Look into the heavens, and see; and behold the
clouds which are higher than thou."</p>

<p>The Book of Job may have been an attempt to solve the problem
why the righteous suffer and to point out that such suffering is
often permitted as a test of faith and a means of grace. They sure
put old Job over the hurdles as an illustration.</p>

<p>He was a character who lived in the land of Uz, 'way back in the
times recorded in the Old Testament. He had more money than most
folks have hay and he was also of great piety. He stood good with
the Lord, who took occasion to comment favourably on Job one day to
Satan, who had appeared before Him.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>"There is no one like Job," remarked the Lord to Satan. "He is a
perfect and upright man. He fears God and eschews evil."</p>

<p>"Well, why not?" said Satan. "You have fixed him up so he is
sitting pretty in every way. But you just let a spell of bad luck
hit him and see what happens. He will curse you to your face."</p>

<p>"You think so?" said the Lord. "All right, I will put all his
belongings in your power to do with as you please. Only don't touch
Job himself."</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, the Sabeans copped all of Job's oxen and
asses and killed his servants and his sheep were burned up and the
Chaldeans grabbed his camels and slaughtered more of his servants
and a big wind blew down a house and destroyed his sons.</p>

<p>But so far from getting sore at the Lord as Satan had figured
would happen after these little incidents, Job rent his mantle and
shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped and
said:</p>

<p>"Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return
thither; the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be
the name of the Lord."</p>

<p>Now had I been Satan I would have given Job up then and there
but lo, and behold, the next time the Lord held a meeting Satan
again appeared and when the Lord started boosting Job for holding
fast to his integrity, Satan sniffed disdainfully and said:</p>

<p>"Skin for skin, yea, all that a man has he will give for his
life, but just you touch his bone and his flesh and see what your
Mr. Job does."</p>

<p>"All right," the Lord said, "I will put him in your hands, only
save his life."</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>Then Satan smote poor Job with boils from the soles of his feet
to the crown of his head. I reckon that was the worst case of boils
anyone ever heard of, and Job's wife remarked:</p>

<p>"Do you still retain your integrity? Curse God, and die."</p>

<p>"Woman," Job said, "you are a fool. Shall we receive good at the
hands of God and not evil?"</p>

<p>But when those pals of Job's, Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar, came
to see him he let out quite a beef to them and in fact cursed the
day he was born. In the end, however, after listening to discourses
from his pals of a length that must have made him as tired as the
boils, Job humbly confessed that God is omnipotent and omnipresent
and repented his former utterances and demeanour "in dust and
ashes" and the Lord made him more prosperous than ever before.</p>

<p>"Why me?"</p>

<p><i>"&mdash;Therefore have I uttered that I understood not;
things too wonderful for me, which I knew not."</i>

<h2><a name="THE_DOCTOR_KNOWS_BEST" id="THE_DOCTOR_KNOWS_BEST">27.
THE DOCTOR KNOWS BEST</a>
</h2>

<p>A MAN has a pain in a certain spot.</p>

<p>It isn't a severe pain. It isn't an incapacitating pain. But it
is nonetheless a pain.</p>

<p>The man goes to a doctor.</p>

<p>"Doc," he says, "I've got a kind of a pain."</p>

<p>So the doctor examines him. He takes the man's temperature,
feels his pulse. He looks down the man's throat. He listens to the
man's chest. He tests his reflexes.</p>

<p>The doctor finds nothing. He gives the man some simple remedy
and tells him that ought to do the trick.</p>

<p>The man is back in a few days, "Doc," he says, "that pain is
still there. I don't feel so good."</p>

<p>The doctor makes another examination. He has the man go to an
X-ray fellow for a few takes of his teeth and his interior. The
doctor puts the exposures on a rack and gazes at them intently. He
sees nothing. He lets the man look at them. The man does not see
anything, either.</p>

<p>Then the doctor gives the man diathermic treatments. He gives
him vitamin pills and vitamin hypodermics. The needles hurt the man
like hell.</p>

<p>"How are we to-day?" the doctor asks the man on the man's next
visit. The doctor is not taking the needles himself, so he has no
call to cut himself in on the man's suffering with that "we".</p>

<p>"Doc," the man says, "that pain is still there. I don't feel so
good."</p>

<p>Now the doctor puts the man on a strict diet. He tells him to
stop smoking and drinking and to cease doing all the other things
the man enjoys.</p>

<p>"Doc," the man says, "that pain is still there."</p>

<p>The doctor commences to resent the man's attitude. He commences
to hate the very sight of the man's kisser. So do his office
attendants. They look at one another knowingly when he appears for
his treatments.</p>

<p>When the man's friends ask the doctor what's the matter with the
man, the doctor shrugs his shoulders. He purses his lips. He smiles
slightly. He as much as says there is nothing the matter with the
man.</p>

<p>The man is observed taking one of the pills the doctor
ordered.</p>

<p>"He's always taking pills," the observer remarks. "He's a
hypochondriac. His doctor can't find a thing wrong with him."</p>

<p>Now if the man has had a good break from life and remains a
bachelor, he is not in such bad shape, but if he has the misfortune
to be married he is in an awful fix because his wife and family are
more difficult to convince that he has a pain than the doctor. They
resent his attitude even more than the doctor.</p>

<p>"I've still got that pain," he says to his wife.</p>

<p>"It's just your imagination," she says.</p>

<p>"You never looked better in your life. You mustn't give way to
every little ache that comes along. Think of all the suffering in
the world. I'm really the one that ought to be in bed."</p>

<p>"I don't feel so good," the man says.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," his wife says.</p>

<p>So the man finally hauls off and gives up the ghost. He ups and
dies. His wife and family are astonished, and indignant.</p>

<p>"Well," the man's friends say. "He wasn't looking any too well
the last time he was around and he was complaining about a pain,
too. Must have been something radically wrong with the old boy, at
that."</p>

<p>The doctor is in a bit of a huff about the man dying that
way.</p>

<p>Well, nothing serious, if you are careful about what you eat and

<p>All right, Doc. Careful is the word from now on. Thanks.</p>

<p>Wait a minute. No orange juice.</p>

<p>What, no orange juice, Doc? Always have orange juice for
breakfast.</p>

<p>No, no orange juice.</p>

<p>Okay, Doc. That's gonna be tough, but grapefruit is just as
good.</p>

<p>No grapefruit, either. No acids.</p>

<p>No grapefruit? Say, what does a guy do for breakfast, Doc?</p>

<p>Cereals.</p>

<p>Don't like cereals, Doc.</p>

<p>No syrup.</p>

<p>You don't mean a little sorghum on wheat cakes, do you, Doc?</p>

<p>No sorghum. No wheat cakes. No sugar.</p>

<p>You don't mean no sugar in the coffee, Doc? Just a couple of
spoons a cup?</p>

<p>Yes, and no coffee.</p>

<p>Now look, Doc. You don't mean no coffee at all?</p>

<p>No coffee.</p>

<p>Say, Doc, that's all right about no sugar, but you must be
kidding about no coffee at all.</p>

<p>No coffee.</p>

<p>Not even a coupla cups a meal, Doc? Why, that's just a
taste.</p>

<p>No coffee.</p>

<p>Doc, that ain't human.</p>

<p>No candy.</p>

<p>Not even a little bitsy box of peppermints at the movies,
Doc?</p>

<p>No, no peppermints. No ice.</p>

<p>You ain't talking about a tiny dab of banana ice cream, are you,
Doc? The kind that goes down so slick?</p>

<p>Yes, no sweets at all. No highly spiced stuff. No herring.</p>

<p>What kind, Doc?</p>

<p>Any kind. No herring.</p>

<p>But you don't mean a little of that chef's special, Doc? The
kind with the white sauce on it?</p>

<p>No herring.</p>

<p>Not even matjes, Doc?</p>

<p>No herring.</p>

<p>Well, all right, Doc. No herring. Gefüllte fish will have to

<p>No gefüllte fish. No goulash.</p>

<p>What kind of goulash, Doc? Hungarian?</p>

<p>Any kind. No salami. No highly seasoned Italian food.</p>

<p>I never eat that more than a couple times a week, anyway; I'll
take a lobster Fra Diavolo now and then.</p>

<p>None of that.</p>

<p>Are you sure about the herring, Doc? There must be some kind
that're all right.</p>

<p>No herring.</p>

<p>It's a conspiracy. Whoever heard of a little herring hurting
anybody? Why, Doc, people have been eating herring for years and it
never bothered them.</p>

<p>No herring.</p>

<p>Well, all right, no herring after to-night and to-morrow. What's
this list, Doc?</p>

<p>It's your diet. Follow it closely.</p>

<p>But there ain't anything on it a guy can eat, Doc. It's
terrible. You were just kidding about the coffee, weren't you, Doc?
No coffee! Can you imagine a guy trying to live without coffee
&mdash; what? You can't!</p>

<p>And no cigarettes.</p>

<p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN RUNYON AND BED</p>

<p>( <i>A Little Style Larceny from Benjamin Franklin</i>)</p>

<p>RUNYON: Well, Bed, here I am again. Gosh, I feel tough.</p>

<p>BED: What's the matter now?</p>

<p>RUNYON: I ache all over. I think I've got a fever, Gosh, I feel
tough.</p>

<p>BED: I'm not surprised. You can't stand it any more, old
boy.</p>

<p>RUNYON: Stand what?</p>

<p>BED: Staying out all night and eating what you please and when
you please.</p>

<p>RUNYON: Say, what has that got to do with the way I feel? I've
picked up a germ of something somewhere.</p>

<p>BED: Well, that's because your physical resistance to germs is
weakened from staying out all night and eating indiscriminately.
You ought to know better.</p>

<p>RUNYON: My physical resistance is all right. This is some kind
of germ that has nothing to do with staying out and eating. Say,
why don't you have more covers? You haven't got enough blankets on
to make a boxing glove for a bumblebee.</p>

<p>BED: I've got on as many as usual.</p>

<p>RUNYON: Well, look how I'm shivering.</p>

<p>BED: That's because your resistance is low, I tell you.</p>

<p>RUNYON: I guess I need a doctor.</p>

<p>BED: It doesn't make any difference whether you need one or not
&mdash; you'll have him. I wish you would get one that doesn't dump
himself down on me when he's looking you over. I'm a little tired
myself from the way you tossed around last night and hollered.</p>

<p>RUNYON: What was I hollering about?</p>

<p>BED: How do I know? You kept hollering "take that!"</p>

<p>RUNYON: Oh, I remember. I was dreaming I was a prizefighter and
was knocking Joe Louis out. I guess it was the knackwurst and
sauerkraut I ate before I came home.</p>

<p>BED: Knackwurst and sauerkraut, eh? And you wonder why you don't
feel good? Why, that's enough to kill a donkey.</p>

<p>RUNYON: See here, Bed. Knackwurst and sauerkraut don't make your
bones ache and give you a fever. My chest is sore, too. I may be
getting pneumonia. Gosh, I feel tough. I'm afraid I'm in for a
siege.</p>

<p>BED: My goodness, I hope not.</p>

<p>RUNYON: Why, don't you like my company?</p>

<p>BED: Oh, your company is all right, but I enjoy it more a little
at a time. Then I'm not in so much danger.</p>

<p>RUNYON: What do you mean &mdash; danger?</p>

<p>BED: Well, I have to constantly be on guard against being
destroyed by fire from those cigarettes you are always smoking.
When I think of the narrow escapes I've had it makes my pillows
shiver. You shouldn't smoke cigarettes when you are sick,
anyway.</p>

<p>RUNYON: Say, a fellow has to do something. He can't just lie
still all day and night, can he?</p>

<p>BED: You certainly don't anyway. You keep me in constant torment
by kicking around and getting my sheets all knotted up. Your
constant groaning is most disturbing, too.</p>

<p>RUNYON: Say, I seem to have a lot of faults, don't I?</p>

<p>BED: Oh, I won't say anything about the soup stains you get on
me when you are having your meals off a tray, but I wish you would
be more careful about the bread crumbs. They are really most
annoying. Another thing, your language is at times slightly
offensive.</p>

<p>RUNYON: Listen here, Bed. Maybe I'd better go to a hospital and
be sick if you're going to be so critical.</p>

<p>BED: You wouldn't like it. They would turn the lights out on you
early and wouldn't let you do so much reading. You couldn't have
the radio turned on all the time, either. By the way, why do you
keep switching from station to station every few minutes instead of
listening to one programme all the way through?</p>

<p>RUNYON: That's because I'm always trying to find torch music
when I'm sick. It makes me feel better. I wish Ukelele Ike was
always on the radio singing "It Had to Be You" when I'm sick. Gosh,
I feel tough. Say, Bed, how does typhoid fever start?</p>

<p>BED: Oh, you haven't got typhoid fever. If you've got anything
it's probably just a little cold. Is that another cigarette? And
didn't I hear you groan? Well, I can see that I'm in for it again.
Oh, my goodness!</p>

<p>RUNYON: Send for the doctor. Gosh, I feel tough!</p>

<h2><a name="BED-WARMERS" id="BED-WARMERS">30 BED-WARMERS</a>
</h2>

<p>WHEN I was in a hospital for a sort of check-up, I was reminded
of a medical friend of mine in Hollywood who has the biggest
check-up business in all Southern California.</p>

<p>The hospitals out there, as everywhere else, are always pressed
for space for patients, especially private rooms. My friend's
clientele is strictly the private room type and he had to devise
some method of holding at least one or two private rooms in reserve
at all times lest some of his patients die of mortification over
having to lie ill in wards.</p>

<p>He keeps a list of movie producers, directors, executives and
even a few actors and when one of his private room patients who has
been really sick is ready for discharge, he calls up some fellow on
the list and says:</p>

<p>"Henry, I have been thinking of you lately and I wish you would
pop into Gates Ajar hospital to-morrow morning for a check-up. I
have a room there for you."</p>

<p>Naturally Henry hustles for the hospital so fast you can
scarcely see him for heel dust because the chances are he is a
hypochondriac to begin with and in any event the check-up is always
de rigueur in Hollywood. It gives a man something to talk about
when he goes out socially.</p>

<p>Henry takes with him an assortment of silk robes and silk
pyjamas and slippers and other gear, just in case any of the nurses
are attractive enough to warrant a display of this nature, and he
crawls into the hospital hay still warm from the body heat of the
last patient.</p>

<p>He does not know it but he is there just as a holder. He does
not know my friend is using him to keep the room against the coming
of a patient of greater illness or importance&mdash;and especially
importance&mdash;than Henry. My friend drops around about noon and
takes his blood pressure and is assuming a serious expression
before telling Henry that it looks bad when the phone rings.</p>

<p>"Doctor," the office downstairs advises him, "Mrs. Farfel has
just arrived."</p>

<p>"Henry," my friend says, as he hangs up, "you are 100 per cent.
okay just as I thought. You can get out of that bed right now and
go home, and consider yourself checked up to
who-laid-the-rail."</p>

<p>"But, Doctor," Henry says, "don't you think &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Henry," my friend says, "please get up. I will help you put on
your clothes. I need the room for Mrs. Farfel."</p>

<p>"You mean the wife of &mdash;" Henry begins.</p>

<p>"Yes," says my friend. "Ah, here she is now! Henry, you will
have to dress out in the hall."</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>Of course, I do not believe the story that my friend had three
of these holders dressing out in the hall at the same time, but
there is no doubt that his check-up turn-over is very rapid and
very large. I fear, however, that he has lost a very good check-up
customer in the person of another friend of mine, a top producer,
who entered the Gates Ajar for a check-up, thinking he was going to
get a good rest from his missus and was dispossessed by my medical
friend in forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>What made the producer particularly sore was his discovery that
the patient who succeeded him was that same missus who went in for
treatment for a nervous breakdown. I am inclined to the opinion
that my medical friend should have employed a stranger as holder,
at that.</p>

<p>The hospital life is not for Runyon. It operates on the theory
that the day begins at about eight o'clock in the a.m., at which
hour the nurse comes barging in with bright hellos that have a
slightly synthetic ring to one who knows that she must have got up
at six o'clock to get to the hospital from her home so early unless
she lives around the corner. Even then no one can be that cheerful
at 8 a.m., especially on a dark day.</p>

<p>The hospital regime is too upsetting to my routine. I think it
was originally devised for farmers. What proof can they offer that
it does a man any good to be awakened at 8 a.m., and put to sleep
at 9 p.m., when all his life he has slept until noon and gone to
bed at 4 a.m.? Let us be fair about this.</p>

<p>After a couple of weeks of hospital order I find myself dozing
at gin rummy games like Jules Saranoff, the champion gin player of
the Friars club, a famous man with his violin in the old days of
vaudeville. When "Sary" plays gin, everyone bets on him up to the
moment he heaves the ten of spades when he should have chucked the
nine of clubs, which is apt to happen any minute after he has
played eight or ten hours because he no longer possesses the
stamina of former years.</p>

<p>One night I was nodding on "Sary's" left and did not see exactly
what came off but it seems his opponent ginned and won the game on
a bad play by "Sary" and I was awakened by his backers clamouring
to be declared off the next game on the ground that he was asleep.
I remarked that his eyes were open so he must be awake.</p>

<p>"The one on your side is," said a backer, "but the one on the
other side is closed. He is sleeping one-eye."</p>

<h2><a name="SWEET_DREAMS" id="SWEET_DREAMS">31. SWEET DREAMS</a>
</h2>

<p>WE think the greatest institution ever devised for human comfort
is the bed. Let us talk about beds.</p>

<p>A man is usually born in bed, and spends at least half his life
in bed. If he is lucky, he dies in bed. We used to think that the
best place to die was on the battlefield, face to the foe, etc.,
but that was when we were much younger and more casual about
dying.</p>

<p>Now we know that a battlefield is likely to be an untidy sort of
place and much more lonesome for the purpose of dying than a nice
clean bed, with the doctors and the sorrowing relatives clustered
about, all wondering how soon they are going to get paid off.</p>

<p>However, let us not pursue those morbid reflections about beds.
We prefer thinking of beds in their more cheerful aspects. We like
to think of a bed as a place of refuge and rest &mdash; as a
sanctuary against the outside world with its troubles and woes,
where sometimes in beautiful dreams, a fellow can live a few hours
in ecstasy.</p>

<p>Of course there may be a few bad dreams, too, but we always
figured they are stood off by the pleasure derived from awakening
to a realization that they are not true. Only the other night a
bloke shoved us off a twenty-storey building, but we woke up just
before we hit the ground and our joy on discovering that we were
still safe in bed completely cancelled the few sweaty seconds we
suffered while falling.</p>

<p>We claim to be one of the greatest authorities in the United
States on beds &mdash; that is, on the sleeping qualities of beds.
We have slept in beds in every State of the Union, and we must say
good beds are fairly common in these days when the construction of
springs and mattresses has reached a degree approaching perfection,
and American housewives, in furnishing their homes, are properly
placing more importance on beds than on any other items of
household equipment.</p>

<p>We can remember when some hotel beds, and a lot in private
homes, too, were pretty hard to take. Even now I occasionally run
across a survivor of the times when a bed was commonly just a sort
of rack with a lumpy mattress and creaky springs and skimpy
coverings for a fellow to toss around on between suns, though in
general Americans have become educated to the idea of complete
comfort in beds.</p>

<p>The trouble with Americans about beds in the past was their
theory that a bed typified indolence. They apparently did not
realize that the better a fellow rested in bed, the livelier he was
likely to be when he got up, and that the better the bed, the
better his rest. It is our opinion that the energy of Americans
generally has greatly increased since the improvement in beds.</p>

<p>We hold that many Americans owe their lack of appreciation in
beds to faulty education in youth. Some parents send their children
to bed as punishment. If they would reverse this procedure and send
them to bed only as a reward, and keep them out of bed as a
penalty, it would inspire in the kids a respect and appreciation
for beds for which they would thank their fathers and mothers in
later years.</p>

<p>It might be a good idea, too, to teach the youngsters right from
taw that they should never take any worries to bed with them
&mdash; that they should regard bed as a secure nest in which they
should rest without giving a thought to worldly concerns. If you
started on them early enough maybe they would grow up with the
knack of disregarding the winds of worry rattling at the window
panes, or the rain of adversity pattering on the roofs that
disturbs so much adult peace of mind in bed.</p>

<p>We never cared much for that Spartan simplicity in beds that
some fellows profess to fancy. A cot in the corner, or a crude
pallet on the ground 'neath the stars is not for us. We went
through all that in our army days, and you can have it.</p>
We will take all the luxury with which a bed can possibly be
surrounded &mdash; a gentle, yielding mattress, and quiet, cushiony
springs, and soft, downy pillows, and snowy linen and the richest
of coverings. A fellow gets little enough out of life under any
circumstances without making his hours of rest too tough.

<p>We like a bed wide and long that we can kick around in without
falling out or stubbing our toes. As we have said, good beds are
common enough, but a truly great bed &mdash; one that fits
perfectly, and that sleeps good, is a rarity that a fellow should
cherish above all other possessions. We have a bed in New York City
that we think is the sleepingest bed in the whole world and would
not part with it for anything, but of course another fellow might
not like it. It might not just fit him. That is the thing &mdash;
to get a bed that fits.</p>

<p>I realize, of course, that my appreciation of a bed is due
largely to the fact that I am one of those fortunate chaps who
sleeps fairly well, for which I am grateful to a kind providence. I
can imagine nothing worse than insomnia. I am lucky enough to be
able to sleep after a fashion standing up, or hanging on a hook,
but in a good bed &mdash; say, that is when I really saw wood!</p>

<h2><a name="PASSING_THE_WORD_ALONG" id=
"PASSING_THE_WORD_ALONG">32. PASSING THE WORD ALONG</a>
</h2>

<p>SINCE I lost my voice or about ninety per cent. of its once
bell-like timbre, I have discovered many inconveniences as well as
some striking conveniences.</p>

<p>The greatest inconvenience is that it involves explanations to
friends on meeting them for the first time since the vocal
abatement and they are grieved by the absence of my former
thunderous salutations.</p>

<p>You see in my set warmth of greeting is rated by the size of the
hellos you give and receive and I was always noted for issuing the
hood rive, or top size, the good old "Hello, hello, hello, hello,
the old well, well, well, hello, hello, hello."</p>

<p>Now that I am perforce down to the 6 7/8 size hello for one and
all which is just a nubbin of a hello and the brush off kind you
give a gee you do not like my friends are inclined to huffiness
towards me until I explain about the voice.</p>

<p>This is a bit of strain in itself but fortunately they soon
start telling me about remedies that cures other blokes they know
so all I have to do is to stand there and nod my head at
intervals.</p>

<p>I find the nod wonderfully non-committal, especially when
someone is delivering a big knock against someone else because word
cannot be carried to the knockee that Runyon was a party to the
knock. At least they cannot quote a nod.</p>

<p>I am occasionally distressed by strangers to whom I address
myself in my low murmur answering me in imitative whisper, possibly
inadvertently, possibly because they think I am kidding and
possibly just because they have no sense. Sometimes even my friends
do the same thing in that gentle spirit of mockery of human
affliction from which many actors and others have long drawn their
humour.</p>

<p>You have undoubtedly heard some of our public performers
discoursing humorously on cross-eyed persons, on bald heads, on the
deaf and the dumb and the lame and the halt. You have perhaps seen
them simulate limps and other distortions of the body to point up
their jokes. It is a common practice for us to apply nicknames
suggestive of affliction such as "Gimp", "Frip", "Humpty", "Deafy",
"Blinky", "Baldy" and the like.</p>

<p>False teeth and glass eyes and the toupee have long been
standard items of jest among our jokesters. A person who is
compelled to resort to a hearing device, one of the greatest boons
to afflicted humanity ever invented, is said to be "wired for
sound" which is supposed to be good for a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>And not only is infirmity one of our leading topics of humour
but it is often brought up by men in moments of anger against the
infirm, as when they say things like "That one-legged so-and-so",
as if the infirmity itself was a reproach.</p>

<p>Of course the humour that deals with infirmities is in bad
taste. Most American humour is in bad taste and growing worse under
the present vogue for the suggestive and the downright obscene in
the spoken and written word. But even the suggestive and the
obscene is not as unkind as the humour dealing with bodily
affliction.</p>

<p>The hale and hearty shun the afflicted and I cannot say I blame
them much. I can well imagine that I am a great trial to my friends
who have to bend their ears close to my kisser to hear what I am
saying. Maybe it would be better for all concerned if I did not try
to talk at all because everybody else is talking these days and I
would not be missed.</p>

<p>I carry a pad of paper in my pocket and when conversation is
indicated I jot down my end of the gabbing on paper and pass it on
to my vis-à-vis who takes a glaum at the chirography, crumples up
the slip of paper and casts it aside, nodding his head or muttering
a non-committal um-hah because he cannot read it any more than I
can after it is two hours cold.</p>

<p>The forced practice has produced a headache for me as this
morning I was waited on by four guys who were all mighty
belligerent. I mean they all wanted to place the sluggola on me.
They wanted to bash out my brains, if any. I mean they were
sizzling.</p>

<p>The first one to appear we will call Pat, though his name is
really Pete. He had a piece of paper in his hand that he handed to
me, saying, truculently:</p>

<p>"What does this mean?"</p>

<p>The paper had obviously been wadded up and smoothed out again
and I could not decipher the writing, though it looked
familiar.</p>

<p>"Who wrote this?" I asked Pat (in writing).</p>

<p>"You did," he said, fiercely.</p>

<p>Then it dawned on me that it was indeed my own writing and I
read it better.</p>

<p>"Pat is a louse," the writing said.</p>

<p>I tried to remember when I had written it. It could scarcely
have been at the editorial council in Joe Connolly's office because
insects were not discussed, only a few heels. As a matter of fact I
did less talking in Joe Connolly's office than anywhere else in
town because when I walked in he had a great big pad of foolscap
lying on his desk and I felt insulted. It was a hint that I talk a
heap.</p>

<p>It might have been in Lindy's late at night when I had a meeting
with Oscar Levant and Leonard Lyons, but it comes to my mind that
we did not get as far down in the alphabet as the P's. We quit at
the O's because I ran out of pad paper and Lindy commenced to get
sore at the way I was working on the backs of his menu cards.</p>

<p>I was busy writing out a denial for Pat when Joe and Ike and
Spike, as we will call them, came barging in and each of them had a
crumpled slip, and were so hot that taken jointly you could have
barbecued a steer on them. I read one slip that said Mike would rob
a church, another that stated that Ike would guzzle his grandmamma
if he thought it would help him while there was still another that
I would not think of putting in a public print. I did not realize
that I knew some of the words.</p>

<p>I think if there had been only one present he would have belted
me but the four being there at the same time complicated matters
because each one knew the others are copper hollerers or stool
pigeons, which is what I had in mind in my writing, and would belch
to the bulls if a murder or mayhem came off.</p>

<p>So they finally left muttering they would see me later and I was
taught a lesson about leaving written testimony scattered around.
However, I think that there is a plot for a great crime story in
all this by my favourite mystery writer of the moment Raymond
Chandler of Los Angeles. I mean he could have the real killer going
about dropping notes that finally land him in the gas chamber at
Quentin because Chandler puts all his mysteries in California as if
we do not have them in Florida, too.</p>

<p>I notice that whipping out the pad sends most of my
acquaintances to searching themselves for their specs and they
invariably have some fatuous remark to make about getting old as if
I did not know by just looking at them or remembering how long I
have known them.</p>

<p>I do not pull the pad and pencil on the dames. I just shake
hands and grin idiotically. Most women are near-sighted since
infancy and too vain to wear cheaters but why should I embarrass
them. Besides not all of them can read.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="DEATH_PAYS_A_SOCIAL_CALL" id=
"DEATH_PAYS_A_SOCIAL_CALL">33. DEATH PAYS A SOCIAL CALL</a>
</h2>

<p>DEATH came in and sat down beside me, a large and most
distinguished-looking figure in beautifully-tailored soft, white
flannels. His expansive face wore a big smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello," I said. "Hello, hello, hello. I was not expecting
you. I have not looked at the red board lately and did not know my
number was up. If you will just hand me my kady and my coat I will
be with you in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"Tut-tut-tut," Death said. "Not so fast. I have not come for
you. By no means."</p>

<p>"You haven't?" I said.</p>

<p>"No," Death said.</p>

<p>"Then what the hell are you doing here?" I demanded indignantly.
"What do you mean by barging in here without even knocking and
depositing your fat Francis in my easiest chair without so much as
by-your-leave?"</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>"Excuse me," Death said, taken aback at my vehemence. "I was in
your neighbourhood and all tired out after my day's work and I
thought I would just drop in and sit around with you awhile and cut
up old scores. It is merely a social call, but I guess I owe you an
apology at that for my entrance."</p>

<p>"I should say you do," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, you see I am so accustomed to entering doors without
knocking that I never thought," Death said. "If you like, I will go
outside and knock and not come in until you answer."</p>

<p>"Look," I said. "You can get out of here and stay out of here.
Screw, bum!"</p>

<p>Death burst out crying.</p>

<p>Huge tears rolled down both pudgy cheeks and splashed on his
white silk-faced lapels.</p>

<p>"There it is again," he sobbed, "That same inhospitable note
wherever I go. No one wants to chat with me. I am so terribly
lonesome. I thought surely you would like to punch the bag with me
awhile."</p>

<p>I declined to soften up.</p>

<p>"Another thing," I said sternly, "what are you doing in that
get-up? You are supposed to be in black. You are supposed to look
sombre, not like a Miami Beach Winter tourist."</p>

<p>"Why," Death said, "I got tired of wearing my old working
clothes all the time. Besides, I thought these garments would be
more cheerful and informal for a social call."</p>

<p>"Well, beat it," I said. "Just Duffy out of here."</p>

<p>"You need not fear me," Death said.</p>

<p>"I do not fear you Deathie, old boy," I said, "but you are a
knock to me among my neighbours. Your visit is sure to get noised
about and cause gossip. You know you are not considered a desirable
character by many persons, although, mind you, I am not saying
anything against you."</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>"Oh, go ahead," Death said. "Everybody else puts the zing on me
so you might as well, too. But I did not think your neighbours
would recognize me in white, although, come to think of it, I
noticed everybody running to their front door and grabbing in their
'Welcome' mats as I went past. Why are you shivering if you do not
fear me?"</p>

<p>"I am shivering because of that clammy chill you brought in with
you," I said. "You lug the atmosphere of a Frigidaire around with
you."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me?" Death said. "I must correct that. I must
pack an electric pad with me. Do you think that is why I seem so
unpopular wherever I go? Do you think I will ever be a social
success?"</p>

<p>"I am inclined to doubt it," I said. "Your personality repels
many persons. I do not find it as bad as that of some others I
know, but you have undoubtedly developed considerable sales
resistance to yourself in various quarters."</p>

<p>"Do you think it would do any good if I hired a publicity man?"
Death asked. "I mean, to conduct a campaign to make me
popular?"</p>

<p>"It might," I said. "The publicity men have worked wonders with
even worse cases than yours. But see here, D., I am not going to
waste my time giving you advice and permitting you to linger on in
my quarters to get me talked about. Kindly do a scrammola, will
you?"</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>Death had halted his tears for a moment, but now he turned on
all faucets, crying boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.</p>

<p>"I am so lonesome," he said between lachrymose heaves.</p>

<p>"Git!" I said.</p>

<p>"Everybody is against me," Death said.</p>

<p>He slowly exited and, as I heard his tears falling
plop-plop-plop to the floor as he passed down the hallway, I
thought of the remark of Agag, the King of the Amalekites, to
Samuel just before Samuel mowed him down: "Surely the bitterness of
death is past."</p>
