<hr><h2><a name="ch1"></a>1. THE HONOUR OF VARANO</h2>

<p>CESARE BORGIA, Duke of Valentinois and Romagna, rose slowly from his
chair, and slowly crossed to the window of that spacious chamber in
the Rocca of Imola. He stood there in the autumn sunshine gazing down
upon the tented meadow and the river beyond, and upon the long ribbon
of road, the ancient Via Aemilia, stretching smooth and straight with
never a crease until it was lost in the distant hazy pile that was
Faenza.

<p>That road which crosses Northern Italy diagonally&mdash;a line of almost
unwavering straightness for a hundred miles from the ancient Rubicon
to Piacenza&mdash;may well have been a source of pride to Marcus Aemilius
Lepidus, some fifteen hundred years before; to Cesare Borgia,
contemplating it upon that autumn day, it was no better than a source
of vexation&mdash;a way north and south by which to his relief might march
the troops he did not dare to summon.

<p>From the road his eyes shifted again to the besieging camp in the
meadows by the river. There all was bustle, an incessant movement
of men and horses, industrious as a colony of ants. Yonder a group
of engineers were mounting a park of artillery with which they
hoped to smash a way into his stronghold. Farther off was a great
coming-and-going of glittering armed figures about the large green
tent that housed the too-daring Venanzio Varano. Away to the west a
half-naked swarm of men laboured with picks and spades at a ditch
by which to deviate the water from the river and so serve them as a
rampart against any sudden sortie of the besieged.

<p>A faint hum of all this business reached the watcher in his eyrie,
and he cursed it between contempt and anger; contempt, to think how
the mere lifting of his finger would scatter that presumptuous little
army, as a flock of sparrows scatters perceiving the hawk poised above
them in the blue; anger, to consider that he dared not lift that same
finger lest other and greater plans, not yet mature, should suffer by
this too-early display of might; contempt again, of this fool Varano,
and his petty daring, to conceive that Cesare Borgia was at the end of
his resources and a prey for such a handful of mercenaries&mdash;the very
sweepings of the martial market-place&mdash;as Varano had assembled; anger
again, that for a day, for an hour, he must allow Varano to continue in
that conceit. With what a puffed-up arrogance would not this fool of
Camerino be ordering the business of the siege against this Imola that
gave no sign, against this brown citadel drowsing unresponsive in the
late autumn sunshine under the Borgia banner with its bull device that
floated from the Maschio Tower.

<p>A stealthy step in the room behind him went unheeded by the Duke. That
it did so, proved the extent of his absorption, for there never lived
a man of keener senses; never a man who combined with an intellect
superacute such splendid animal faculties as were his. Merely to behold
him was to perceive all this. He was in the very flower of his youth;
some seven and twenty years of age; tall, straight and lithe as steel.
His father, Pope Alexander VI, had been accounted in early life the
handsomest man of his day; of a beauty of countenance, it was said,
that acted upon women as the lodestone upon iron&mdash;which had by no
means helped him to the virtuous course that should be looked for in a
churchman. That beauty Cesare had inherited, but refined and glorified
by the graces of Madonna Vanozza de' Catanei, the Roman lady who had
been his mother. If there was sensuality in the full lips of the red
mouth, half-hidden by the silky tawny beard, this was corrected by
the loftiness of the pale brow; the nose was delicately arched, the
nostrils sensitive, and the eyes&mdash;who shall describe the glory of those
hazel eyes? Who shall read their message, who shall depict the will,
the intellect, the dreamy wistfulness, the impassiveness that looks out
of them?

<p>He was dressed from head to foot in black; but through the slashings
of his velvet doublet gleamed the rich yellow of an undervest of
cloth-of-gold; a ruby-studded girdle gripped his loins, and on his hip
hung a heavy gold-hilted Pistoja dagger in a golden sheath of cunning
workmanship. His tawny head was bare.

<p>Again came never so faintly the creak of that stealthy footstep behind
him, and again it went unperceived. Nor yet did Cesare move when
another and heavier tread rang on the staircase mounting to his room.
Absorbed he continued his survey of Varano's camp.

<p>The door was opened and reclosed. Someone had entered and was
approaching him. Still he did not stir; yet without stirring he spoke,
addressing the newcomer by name.

<p>"And so, Agabito," said he, "you have sent my summons to Varano?"

<p>To another less accustomed than his secretary, Agabito Gherardi, to
Cesare's ways, this might have seemed almost uncanny. But Agabito was
familiar with that superacuteness of his master, whose perceptions were
keen as a blind man's and who could recognise a step where another
would have needed to behold the face.

<p>He bowed as Cesare turned to him. He was a man of middle height, well
nourished, with a mobile, humorous mouth and keen dark eyes. His age
may have been forty, and, as became his clerkly station, he wore a
black surcoat that descended to his knees.

<p>"It has gone, Highness," he answered. "But I doubt the gentleman of
Camerino will decline the invitation."

<p>Agabito observed the Duke's glance to stray past and beyond him. Musing
and idle seemed his eyes to Agabito&mdash;which but serves to show that,
intimately though the secretary accounted that he knew his master, yet
he had not fathomed the inscrutability of Cesare's glance. For the eyes
which looked dreamy were alert and watchful, and the brain behind them
was working swiftly to conclusions. The arras over beyond the great
carved writing-table was quivering never so faintly. This Cesare was
observing&mdash;seeming to muse&mdash;and he was considering that the air was
still and that no draught could account for that phenomenon. Yet when
presently he spoke, he betrayed nothing of observation or conclusion.

<p>"Art ever a pessimist, Agabito," said he.

<p>"True-sighted, my lord," amended the secretary, with the easy
familiarity Cesare conceded him. "For the rest, what does it matter,
whether he comes or not?" And he smiled, a thousand wrinkles gathering
about his eyes. "There is always the back door."

<p>"It is your cursed pessimism again to remind me that there is that and
naught but that."

<p>Agabito spread his hands, his countenance a grimace of deprecation.

<p>"Who cares to open that back door?" quoth the Duke.

<p>"Why, man, if I make the allies aware of its existence, if I so much as
lift the latch, the click of it will so scare them that they'll every
one escape me. The back door, you say! You are growing old, Agabito.
Show me the way to drive off that shallow fool with such means as I
dispose of here."

<p>"Alas!" sighed the secretary hopelessly.

<p>"Alas, indeed!" snapped the Duke, and strode past him into the room.
There he paced a while, considering the position, Agabito observing him.

<p>To a more vexatious pass than this matters could not have come. It was
the season of the league against him formed by the Orsini in alliance
with his own revolted captains Vitelli and Baglioni. These rebels stood
in arms a full ten thousand strong, determined upon his destruction,
having sworn his death. Cunningly they spread their net to hem him in,
believing that they had him safe and that his strength was sapped.
And he, the better to take them in the toils they were spinning for
himself, had indulged them in their conviction that he was powerless
and unprepared. Actively had he done so, deliberately dismissing three
of his companies of French lances&mdash;the very, backbone of his army&mdash;and
putting it about that they had left him of their own accord, led off
by their captains with whom he had quarrelled. Thus had it seemed as
if his knell had indeed sounded; already the allies accounted him
their prey, for, without the French lances, the forces of which he
disposed were of no account. But they knew nothing of the Romagnuoli
men-at-arms that Naldo had assembled for him, still less of the Swiss
foot and the Gascon mercenaries whom his officers held ready for him in
Lombardy&mdash;nor should they know until the hour was ripe. He had but to
lift his finger, and there would sprout up such an army as should make
the allies sick with misgivings. Meanwhile he desired that they should
bait their trap for him, lulled by their false security. He would walk
into it complacently enough; but&mdash;by the Host!&mdash;what a surprising stir
would he not make within it. How the springs of that same trap should
take them on the recoil and crush them!

<p>To have planned so well, so precisely to have reckoned the moves that
must enable him to cry "Checkmate!"&mdash;and to find himself, instead,
stalemated by the act of this rash fool of Camerino who sat out there
in egregious self-complacency, little recking the volcano that was
under him!

<p>For here is what had happened. This Venanzio Varano, one of the
dethroned lords of Camerino, impatient at the sluggishness of the
allies, and unable to urge them into swifter action, had drawn off
and taken matters into his own hands. Gathering together a desperate,
out-at-elbow army of discredited mercenaries of all nations, numbering
perhaps a thousand strong, he had marched upon Imola, and there laid
siege to Cesare in his stronghold&mdash;cursed alike by the allies and by
Cesare for his interference in the plans of each.

<p>"Perhaps," said Agabito presently, "if the allies observe the success
that seems to attend Varano, they will join him here. Then would be
your opportunity."

<p>But Cesare waved a hand impatiently. "How can I put a net about them
here?" he asked. "I could rout their army; but what of that? It is the
brains of it I want&mdash;and at one blow. No, no," he ended. "Meanwhile,
let us see what answer Varano makes to my invitation, and what comes of
it."

<p>"And if nothing comes, you'll strike?" said Agabito, as though he urged
it.

<p>Cesare pondered, his face clouding. "Not yet," said he. "I'll wait and
hope for some chance. My luck&mdash;there is my luck, remember." He turned
to the massive, richly wrought writing-table, and took up a packet.
"Here is the letter for the Signory of Florence. I have signed it.
Contrive to get it hence."

<p>Agabito took the package. "It will tax my ingenuity," said he, and
pursed his lips.

<p>"Attend to it," said Cesare, and so dismissed him.

<p>The door closed upon the secretary; his steps receded down the stone
staircase, and the sound of them was lost. Then Cesare, standing in
mid-apartment, faced the arras which had quivered on Agabito's entrance.

<p>"Come forth, messer the spy," said he quite calmly.

<p>He was prepared to see a man emerge in answer to that summons&mdash;and he
had some notion of that man's identity&mdash;but he was quite unprepared for
the manner in which his order was to be obeyed.

<p>The arras was swept aside, and across the intervening space, it seemed
to Cesare, was hurled as from a catapult a great, brown human shape
with one arm raised to strike. The blow descended. The dagger took
Cesare full in the breast, and there snapped suddenly. As the broken
blade tinkled on the floor, the Duke's hands closed like manacles about
the wrists of his assailant.

<p>The wretch may never have seen Cesare snap a horseshoe in his fingers,
nor yet seen Cesare decapitate a bull at one single stroke of a
spadoon, but of the awful strength that could accomplish such feats
as those he had now the fullest and most painful demonstration. This
murderer was a big fellow, of stout thews and sinews, yet in the grip
of that lithe young man his strength was all turned to water. He felt
as if the iron pressure of Cesare's fingers were crushing his wrists
to pulp, were twisting his elbows out of joint. He came howling to
his knees, then caught his nether lip in his teeth to repress another
howl. His right hand opened and released the hilt and stump of his
poniard, which went to rejoin the blade upon the floor. He looked up
with fearful eyes into the Duke's face, and found it calm&mdash;horribly,
terrifically calm&mdash;betraying neither anger nor exertion.

<p>"Messer Malipiero," said his Highness, "you should never have chanced
a shirt of mail when there was my naked throat to offer you so fair a
mark." And he smiled amiably&mdash;the very superlative of mockery&mdash;into the
other's tortured countenance. Then he released him. "Get up!" he said
more briskly. "We must talk."

<p>"My lord! My lord!" whimpered the assassin, holding out his maimed
wrists. "Forgive! Forgive!"

<p>"Forgive?" echoed Cesare, halting as he moved away. "Forgive what?"

<p>"My&mdash;the thing I did but now."

<p>"Oh, that! Why, it is the manliest thing you have done since you came
hither. Count it forgiven. But the rest, Malipiero&mdash;your offering
your sword to me in a time of need, your lies to me, your gaining my
confidence, and you the spy of Varano&mdash;must I forgive that too?"

<p>"My lord!" groaned the abject Malipiero.

<p>"And even if I forgive you all this, can you forgive yourself&mdash;you, a
patrician&mdash;that you should have come to turn spy and assassin?"

<p>"Not&mdash;not assassin, my lord. I had not meant that. It was in
self-defence, seeing myself discovered and accounting myself lost. Oh,
I was mad! Mad!"

<p>The Duke moved away towards the table. "Well, well," said he, "it is
over and done with." He took up a silver whistle, and blew a blast upon
it. Malipiero, staggering to his feet, turned if possible a shade paler
than he had been. But the Duke's next words reassured him. "And for my
own part, since you lay such store by it&mdash;I forgive you."

<p>"You forgive me?" Malipiero could not believe his ears.

<p>"Why not? I am a good Christian, I hope; and I practise the Christian
virtue of forgiveness; so much indeed, that I deplore most deeply the
necessity of hanging you none the less."

<p>Malipiero flung wide his aching arms, and made a sound in his throat,
terror staring from his protruding eyes.

<p>"What choice have I?" quoth Cesare, in answer to that incoherent cry.
"There are the things you have overheard. It was unfortunate."

<p>"Gesu!" cried the other, and advanced a step towards Cesare. "I swear
that I'll be dumb."

<p>"You shall," said Cesare.

<p>Heavy steps approached. Malipiero gulped, then spoke quickly, with
fearful earnestness.

<p>"I swear no word of what I heard shall ever cross my lips&mdash;I swear it
by all my hopes of heaven, by the Blessed Mother of God!"

<p>"You shall not be forsworn," Cesare assured him. Then the door opened,
and the officer of the guard stood at attention on the threshold.

<p>Malipiero clutched at his breast, swung about this way and that in the
frenzy of his despair, until his glance met Cesare's calm eyes and
impassive countenance. Then his tongue was loosened. Imprecations,
ordures of speech too horrible for chronicling, poured torrentially
from his quivering lips, until a touch upon the shoulder struck him
into a shuddering silence. Limply he surrendered himself to the officer
who at a sign from Cesare had advanced.

<p>"Let him be confined in solitude," said the Duke, "until I make known
my pleasure."

<p>Malipiero looked hopelessly at Cesare. "When&mdash;when is it to be?" he
asked hoarsely.

<p>"At dawn tomorrow," Cesare answered. "God rest your soul!"

<p>A trumpet blared beneath the walls of Imola, and its brazen voice
reached Cesare Borgia in that room in the Maschio Tower. He dropped
his pen and lay back in his chair. Conjecturing what might hang upon
that trumpet-blast, he smiled pensively at the groined ceiling that was
painted blue and flecked with golden stars, and waited.

<p>Presently came Messer Gherardi with news that an ambassador had arrived
from Varano's camp, and Cesare ceased to smile.

<p>"An ambassador?" he echoed, his brows knitting. "Does a servant come in
response to the invitation I sent the master?"

<p>Agabito's ready smile deprecated this vexation. "Is it really matter
for wonder? These Varani are treacherous, bloody men. Venanzio fears
that you might deal with him as he with you in the like circumstances.
He knows that were he removed his mercenaries would not avenge him,
would not stand together for a day. You will see the ambassador, my
lord? I can promise that you will find Varano's choice of messenger
most interesting."

<p>"How?" quoth Cesare shortly.

<p>But the secretary's answer seemed almost an evasion. "There has been an
arrest made since last I was here," said he. "I never trusted Gustavo
Malipiero. How came he in this room, Highness?"

<p>"That matters little. What he sought matters rather more. It was my
life." And Cesare pointed to the pieces of the broken dagger, still
lying where Malipiero had dropped them half-an-hour ago. "Pick it up,
Agabito," said he.

<p>On the point of obeying, Agabito checked, a queer smile twisting the
corners of his mobile mouth. "You might presently wish that I had left
it," said he. "Let it lie there yet a while, my lord."

<p>Cesare's eyes questioned the secretary.

<p>"Shall I introduce the ambassador of Varano?" was Agabito's bland
inquiry.

<p>"Why&mdash;what has he to do with Malipiero's dagger?" quoth the Duke,
perceiving that in Gherardi's mind some connection must exist.

<p>"Perhaps nothing, perhaps much. Be your Highness the judge."

<p>Cesare waved a hand, assenting. Agabito crossed to the door, opened it
and called; then leisurely returned to take his stand by the table at
Cesare's elbow Steps ascended the stairs. Two men-at-arms in morion
and corselet clattered in and flanked the doorway, and between them
entered, with clank of scabbard and ring of spurs, an elderly man of
middle height, very splendid in purple velvet. In midapartment he
checked with military abruptness, and bowed stiffly, yet profoundly, to
the Duke. Then he came upright again, and out of a vulture face a pair
of shifty eyes met Cesare's stem glance.

<p>Whilst a man might count a dozen there was utter silence in the
chamber, the ambassador waiting for the Duke to address him, the Duke
seeming in no haste, but staring at the man and understanding what had
been in Gherardi's mind when he had begged that the dagger should be
let lie a while.

<p>A bee sailed through the window and the hum of its wings was the only
sound that disturbed a stillness that was becoming unnatural. At last
Cesare spoke to the ambassador of Varano, to the father of the man who
half-an-hour ago had sought to murder him.

<p>"It is thou, Malipiero, eh?" said he, his face impassive as a mask, his
brain a whorl of speculation of considering and connecting.

<p>The man bowed again. "Your servant always, Highness."

<p>"Art the servant of the Lord of Camerino?" the Duke amended. "Art
the fox that waits upon the wolf?" And the evenness of his tones was
marred by the faintest suspicion of a sneer. "I bade your master
attend me that we might arrange the terms upon which he will consent
to raise this siege. He sends you in his place. It is an affront&mdash;tell
him&mdash;which I shall lay to his already very heavy score. Let him flout
me while the little fleeting chance is his. But let him not cry out
hereafter when I call the reckoning."

<p>"My lord was afraid to come, Magnificent."

<p>Cesare laughed shortly. "I nothing doubt it. But you&mdash;you, Malipiero?"
And he leant forward, his tone of a sudden invested with a deadly
menace. "Were you not afraid to take his place?"

<p>Malipiero started, his natural pallor deepened, and the corners of
his mouth were perceived by Agabito to quiver slightly. But before he
could answer, the Duke had sunk back into his chair again, and asked in
normal tones: "Why have you come?"

<p>"To treat in my lord's name."

<p>Cesare considered him a moment in silence. "For that and nothing else?"
he inquired.

<p>"What else, indeed, Highness?"

<p>"'Tis what I asked thee," said Cesare shortly.

<p>"My lord," the other cried in quaking protest, "I come as an
ambassador."

<p>"Why, true. I was forgetting. Discharge your embassy. You know the
thing that I would buy. Tell me the price this trader of Camerino asks."

<p>Malipiero the elder drew himself erect, and formally performed his
errand. As he spoke his eyes strayed to the broken dagger lying almost
at his feet, the gold hilt gleaming in a shaft of sunlight; but the
weapon told him nothing, it was plain, for he never checked or faltered
in the delivery of his message.

<p>"My lord of Camerino," he announced, "will raise this siege and
withdraw his army in return for your signed undertaking to recall your
troops from Camerino, reinstating him in his lordship and leaving him
to enjoy it unmolested."

<p>Cesare stared in amazement at the effrontery of the demand. "Was he
drunk, this lout of Camerino, when he sent that message?" Malipiero
quailed under the scorn of the Duke's eyes. "Magnificent," he said, "it
may be that my Lord Venanzio seems arrogant to you. But you will find
him firm in his resolve. He has you, he swears, in the hollow of his
hand."

<p>"Has he so? Body of God! Then he shall find that I am made of
gunpowder, and when I burst that same hand of his shall be blown to
rags. Go tell him so."

<p>"You'll not accept his terms?"

<p>"Sooner will I sit in Imola until the Resurrection of the Flesh."
Malipiero paused a moment like a man undecided. His glance shifted to
the shaven, humorous face of Agabito Gherardi; but he saw nothing there
to embolden him. Nevertheless like a good ambassador, he said what else
he had been bidden say.

<p>"Vitellozzo, the Orsini and the Baglioni are coalescing."

<p>"Do you give me news? And how shall that serve Varano? His subjects
of Camerino loathe him for a bloody tyrant, and being once rid of him
they'll never suffer his return."

<p>"I am not sure..." began Malipiero.

<p>"I know thou'rt not. But I, who am, tell thee." He pushed back his
chair on that, and rose. "Agabito, let this ambassador of Varano be
reconducted, and with courteous treatment."

<p>And with that, as if dismissing the entire matter from his mind, he
sauntered across the room, past Malipiero, towards the window; and as
he went he drew from his pocket a little comfit-box in gold and blue
enamel.

<p>Agabito experienced a pang of disappointment. Not so, by much, had he
pictured the conclusion of this interview. And yet, perhaps Cesare in
his cunning and unfailing calculation counted upon something more.
Even as he thought of it he saw in Malipiero's attitude that it was
so, indeed. For the ambassador made no shift to go. He stood there
shuffling uneasily, his foxy old eyes roaming from the secretary to the
young duke, and betraying the labour of his mind.

<p>"Highness," he said at last, "may I speak with you alone?"

<p>"We are alone," said Cesare over his shoulder. "What else have you to
add?"

<p>"Something that will make for the advancement of your interests."

<p>Cesare turned his back to the window, and his beautiful eyes grew
very narrow as they surveyed the bowing Malipiero. Then a faint smile
hovered round his lips. He made a sign to the men-at-arms standing by
the door. They turned and clattered out.

<p>"Agabito remains. I have no secrets from my secretary. Speak out."

<p>"Highness..." began the ambassador, and halted there. Then, under
Cesare's impatient eye, "My Lord Varano is in earnest," he concluded
lamely.

<p>Cesare shrugged and raised the lid of his comfit-box. "So I had
understood from you already. Is there nothing more?"

<p>"You were pleased to correct me, Highness, when upon entering here I
announced myself your servant."

<p>"By what tortuous ways do you travel to your goal? Well, well! You were
my servant once; now you are his. Would you be mine again? Is that your
meaning?"

<p>Malipiero bowed eloquently. The Duke considered him, shot a glance at
Agabito, then with deliberation picked a coriander-seed.

<p>"The lord of Camerino's fortunes, then, do not wear so very prosperous
a look?" said he, between question and conclusion, and thereby set
Malipiero infernally ill at ease.

<p>The ambassador had looked for some eagerness on Cesare's part. This
calm, half-mocking indifference chilled him. At last he took his
courage in both hands. "It was I," he announced, "who made Varano
afraid to come&mdash;to the end that he might send me."

<p>The lid of the comfit-box snapped down. His Magnificence of Valentinois
was interested at last, it seemed. Encouraged, Malipiero went on, "I
did this that I might lay my poor services at your disposal; for at
heart, Highness, I have ever been your most devoted. My only son is in
your service."

<p>"You lie, you foul, infernal traitor. You lie!" And Cesare advanced
upon him as if to strike him into dust. Gone now was the impassive calm
on his face; gone the inscrutable softness of his eyes; their glance
enveloped Malipiero as in a flame&mdash;a flame that swept about his heart
and left it ashes.

<p>"My lord! My lord!" he babbled foolishly.

<p>Cesare halted in his approach, and resumed his quiet manner as abruptly
as he had cast it off.

<p>"Look at that dagger at your feet," he said, and Malipiero obeyed him
stupidly. "It was broken an hour ago against my breast. Can you guess
whose the hand that wielded it? Your son's&mdash;this precious only son of
yours, who is in my service."

<p>Malipiero recoiled, bearing a hand to his throat as if something choked
him.

<p>"You came hither for such scraps of knowledge as that spy might have
gleaned. My invitation to Varano was your opportunity. Without it
you would still have come, bearing as spontaneous the offer that you
brought as answer. The object of your spying you best know&mdash;you that
never yet kept faith with any man. Oh, there is no doubt, Malipiero,
that at heart you have ever been my devoted servants&mdash;you and your son."

<p>"O God!" groaned the unhappy wretch.

<p>"Your only son is to be hanged at daybreak tomorrow. It shall be from
this window here, in sight of this Varano whom he served, in sight of
you who have ever been my most devoted."

<p>Malipiero cast himself upon his knees; he flung out his arms wildly.
"My lord, I swear to you that I knew naught of any plot to&mdash;to hurt
you."

<p>"Why, I believe you for once. There may have been no such plot. But I
caught your son in the act of spying, and so he took, perhaps, what
seemed to him the only course. It makes no difference. He would have
hanged without that."

<p>Malipiero, on his knees, raised a livid face, his brow glistening with
the sweat of the agony that racked him.

<p>"Highness," he cried, in a quavering voice, "I have it in my power
to make amends for my son's folly. I can rid you of this bankrupt of
Camerino. Shall it&mdash;shall it be a bargain between us? My son's life for
the raising of this siege?"

<p>Cesare smiled. "It was to make me some such proposal, I think, that you
desired to speak with me alone. Nothing is altered but the price&mdash;for
not a doubt but that you intended some other profit from the treachery
you had conceived."

<p>Malipiero flung dissimulation to the winds. What, indeed, could it
avail him against one who looked so deep and unerringly into motives?
The greed of gold which had made him a constant traitor to any whom he
served had been his only stimulus in this fresh treachery. But now, the
life of his boy was all the recompense he asked. He frankly said as
much.

<p>"I will not bargain with you," was Cesare's contemptuous answer.

<p>Tears welled to the eyes of the distraught man and coursed down the
furrows of the livid cheeks. Wildly he implored clemency and urged upon
the Duke's attention the gain he stood to make.

<p>"There is not in all Italy a knave with whom I would so scorn to deal
as you, Malipiero. Man, you have steeped yourself in the filth of
treachery until you stink of it. The very sight of you offends me."

<p>"My lord," the wretch clamoured, "I can raise this siege as could no
other man. Grant me Gustavo's life, and it shall be done to-morrow. I
will draw Varano away&mdash;back to Camerino. What are his men without him?
You know their worth, Highness&mdash;a parcel of hirelings with no heart in
the business, who would never stay to oppose a sally if Varano were not
at hand to urge them."

<p>Cesare measured the man with a calculating eye. "What means have you to
perform so much?"

<p>At that suggestion that the Duke was inclined to treat with him,
Malipiero rose. He shuffled a step nearer, licking his lips. "Varano
loves his throne of Camerino dearly. But there is one thing he loves
still more&mdash;his honour. Let it be whispered to him that the lady, his
wife&mdash;" He leered horribly. "You understand, Magnificent? He would
leave his camp out yonder and dash back to Camerino, where she bides,
as fast as horse could bear him."

<p>Cesare felt his soul revolt. The thing was vile, the fruit of a vile
mind, uttered by a vile mouth; and as he looked at the leering creature
before him, a sense of nausea took him. But his face showed no sign of
this; his beautiful passionless eyes betrayed none of the loathing with
which this arch-traitor inspired him. Presently his lips parted in a
smile; but what that smile portended Malipiero could not guess until he
spoke.

<p>"Possibly there is in Italy a viler thing than thou; probably there is
not. Still, it is for me to use thee, not convert thee. Do this thing,
then, since you are assured it may be done."

<p>Malipiero drew a deep breath of relief. Insults were of no account to
him. "Grant me my son's life, and I undertake that by tonight Varano
shall be in the saddle."

<p>"I'll make no bargains with you," Cesare answered him.

<p>"But if I do this thing you will be clement, you will be merciful,
Highness?"

<p>"Rest content. You shall not fail to find me just."

<p>"I am content," said Malipiero. "I count upon that. And yet&mdash;and yet...
Reassure me, Highness! I am a father. Promise me that, if I serve you
in this, Gustavo shall not hang."

<p>Cesare eyed him a moment and shrugged contemptuously. "He shall not
hang. I have said that you shall find me just. And now to details."
Cesare crossed briskly to the writing-table. "Have you power in
Varano's name to grant a safe-conduct?"

<p>"I have, Highness."

<p>"Here is what you will need. Write, then&mdash;for twenty men from Imola."

<p>Malipiero snatched a quill, and in a hand that shook, for all his
efforts to steady it, he wrote and signed the order Cesare demanded.
The Duke took the paper and sat down.

<p>"How shall I have knowledge that Varano has departed?" he inquired.

<p>Malipiero considered a moment. Then, "As soon as he goes tonight I will
extinguish the cresset that burns outside his tent. You can see it from
here."

<p>Cesare nodded shortly, and blew upon his silver whistle. To the
men-at-arms, re-entering in answer to that summons, he consigned the
person of the ambassador, bidding them reconduct him to the gates.

<p>When the door had closed again, Cesare turned to Agabito with a smile
of grim contempt. "I had best served the world had I violated the
sacredness of that ambassador's person, and held a family hanging in
the morning. The toad! Madonna! The foul, crapulous toad! But there!
Summon Corella, and bid them have young Malipiero at hand."

<p>When, presently, Cesare's Venetian captain, whom so many supposed to be
a Spaniard, stalked into the room&mdash;a tall, stately man, all steel and
leather&mdash;the Duke tossed Malipiero's safe-conduct across to him, and
gave his orders.

<p>"You will watch tonight the cresset that burns outside Varano's tent.
Ten minutes after it has been quenched you will ride out with the
twenty men you choose, and make for Camerino." Cesare unrolled a map
and beckoned Corella to his side. "But not this way, Michele&mdash;not by
Faenza and Forli. You shall take to the hills and thus outstrip another
party going by the main road. Contrive that you reach Camerino in
advance of it by at least six hours, and remember that those others
will ride desperately. Agabito will instruct you later in what else you
have to do. The manner of it shall be in your own hands."

<p>Michele da Corella gasped. "They will set out before me," he said.
"They will take the shorter road, and they will ride desperately. Yet
I am to be in Camerino at least six hours ahead of them. In short, I
am to work a miracle, and I am just Michele da Corella, a captain of
horse."

<p>Cesare looked up quietly. "Chucklehead!" said he. "You will detach
the two best-mounted men of your company, and send them after the
other party by the Rimini road. Let them pass and precede them, and so
contrive with the relays to delay them upon the road sufficiently to
enable you to do as I command."

<p>Corella flushed out of shame of wits that must appear so dull.

<p>"Now, go, Michele," the Duke bade him, "and make ready."

<p>As Corella was withdrawing the Duke recalled him. "I said twenty men.
I should have said nineteen&mdash;counting yourself; the twentieth will be
Messer Gustavo Malipiero, who is to ride with you. Bid them bring him
in now."

<p>Corella saluted and withdrew. Cesare sat back in his great leathern
chair and glanced at Agabito. "Well?" he inquired. "Do you perceive
what a web of justice I am weaving?"

<p>"Not yet, my lord," confessed Agabito.

<p>"Not? I sometimes think you are as dull-witted as Michele."

<p>And Agabito kept it to himself that he sometimes thought his master
possessed all the guile and craft of Satan.

<p>As Malipiero the older had undertaken, so did he perform; though in the
performance he went near to being strangled by the powerful hands of
Venanzio Varano.

<p>He repaired at nightfall to Venanzio's tent with his foul invention,
and at the first hint of his meaning the passionate lord of Camerino
flung into a fury. He caught Malipiero by his scraggy throat, swung him
off his feet, and went over with him in a dark corner of the tent.

<p>There he pinned him to the ground under a knee that seemed to be
crushing every bone in the old traitor's breast.

<p>"Dog!" he snarled, and Malipiero writhed and squirmed, halfdead from
shock and fright, expecting to feel the other's teeth close on his
windpipe, so brutal was Varano become in his great rage. "Do you
proclaim my wife a trull?" he roared. "Say that you lied! Confound
yourself, you rogue, or, by the Host I'll wring your carrion neck."

<p>Then Malipiero, coward though he was at heart, was fired with the
courage of despair. "Fool!" he panted, struggling for breath. "Fool, I
spoke out of love for you, and I can prove the thing I say."

<p>"Prove it?" roared the infuriated Varano, and he heaved the wretch up
to dash him down again. "Prove it? Can lies be proved?"

<p>"No," said Malipiero. "But truth can."

<p>It was a simple and very obvious retort. Yet it produced its effect
upon Varano, and Malipiero was able to breathe more freely at last.
Varano had released him; he had risen and was bawling for lights.
Malipiero sat up, nursing his bruises, making sure that no bones
were broken, and breathing a prayer of thanksgiving to Our Lady of
Loreto&mdash;who had ever been the object of a special devotion on his
part&mdash;that he had had the wit to forge proofs betimes that should lend
countenance to the foul charges he made against a pure lady's honour.
He comforted himself, too, with the reflection that those same proofs
would avenge the mishandling he had suffered, and that for the bruises
Varano had dealt his body he would presently deal such bruises to
Varano's soul as should go some way to make them quits.

<p>Lights came, revealing the shrivelled, yellow-faced man sitting
there upon the floor, with tumbled hair and rent garments and a very
evil glimmer in his rat's eyes, and the other&mdash;the great lumbering
Varano&mdash;standing over him, no less pale and evil to behold.

<p>"Now, dog, the proofs."

<p>This was Malipiero's hour of vengeance. Slowly he loosed the points
of his purple doublet; slowly he groped within the breast of it, and
slowly he drew forth a package tied with an orange ribbon.

<p>Slowly he was proceeding to unfasten it, when Varano, with an oath of
impatience, stooped, snatched the package, and tore away the ribbon.
Then he strode to the table, unfolded a letter, and spread it under his
great hand.

<p>Malipiero, watching him with fearful, unblinking eyes, saw the great
head slowly sink forward on to his breast. But Varano rallied quickly.
His faith in his wife was no mere thistledown to be so lightly
scattered. He sank to a chair, and turned to Malipiero, who had now
risen.

<p>"Tell me," he said, "tell me again, how came these into your hands?"
There was now no anger in his voice. He spoke like a man who is
struggling between dark unconsciousness and painful consciousness.

<p>"Madonna's chamberlain Fabio brought them an hour ago during your
absence. He dared not come while you were here. Love of you made him
traitor to your lady. Fear of you kept him from delivering the letters
to you himself. And no sooner had he said so much to me than he was
gone again, leaving the cursed package in my hands."

<p>"If&mdash;if they were false!" cried Varano, wrestling with that fierce
natural jealousy of his upon which the cunning Malipiero had built his
schemes.

<p>The traitor's face grew long with simulated sorrow. "My lord," he
murmured dolefully, "to bid you build on that were not to love you.
What ends could Fabio wish to serve? And Fabio loves you. And Fabio,
who purloined those letters from madonna's treasure casket, knew of
their existence, else he had not sought them."

<p>"Enough!" cried the wretched Varano&mdash;a cry of anguish. Then with an
oath he opened out another letter. "Oh, vile!" he groaned. "Oh, worse
and worse," and he read the signature&mdash;"Galeotto"&mdash;then knit his brows.
"But who is this Galeotto?"

<p>On the livid face of the satyr behind his chair a faint smile was
smeared. He had a sense of humour, this Malipiero, and in the fiction
of that name, in the equivoque it covered, it had found a sly
expression. Aloud he parodied a line of Dante's:

<p><i>"Galeotto fu il nome, e chi lo scrisse!"</i>

<p>With a snort the lord of Camerino turned to a third letter. His hand
clenched and unclenched as he read. Then he raised it, and smashed it
down upon the table with a fearful oath. He came to his feet. "Oh,
shameless!" he inveighed. "Adulteress! Trull! Oh, and yet&mdash;so fond to
all seeming, and so foully false! God help me! Is it possible&mdash;is it&mdash;"

<p>He checked, his blood-injected eyes fastened upon Malipiero, and
Malipiero recoiled now in horror of the devil he had raised. He drew
hastily aside, out of Varano's way, as the latter, moved by a sudden
resolve, strode to the entrance of the tent, beating his hands together
and calling.

<p>"Saddle me three horses on the instant," he commanded, "and bid
Gianpaolo make ready for a journey." Then, striding back into the tent,
"The third horse is for you, Malipiero."

<p>"For me?" clucked the traitor, in a greater fright than any that had
yet touched him since embarking on this evil business.

<p>"For thee," said Varano sternly. Then towering above the shivering
wretch, "Hast ever known torture, Malipiero?" he inquired. "Hast ever
seen the hoist at work, or the rack disjointing bones and stretching
sinews till they burst, till the patient screams for the mercy of a
speedy death? If God in His great clemency should please that you
have lied to me&mdash;as I pray He may&mdash;you shall make acquaintance with
those horrors, Malipiero. Ah, it makes you faint to think on them,"
he gloated, for he was, as Cesare had said a cruel, bloody man. Then
suddenly, sternly, "Go make you ready for this journey," he commanded,
and Malipiero went.

<p>Here was a tangle, a complication on which the astute Venetian&mdash;for
this Malipiero hailed from Venice, the very home and source of
craft&mdash;had failed to reckon. That Varano should still be suspicious
amid all his passion of jealousy, and should wish to make sure of
Malipiero against the chance of precisely some such situation as the
existing one, was something that had never entered the traitor's
calculations.

<p>What was he to do? Mother of God, what was he to do?

<p>As he stood in his own tent a sickness took him, a sickness that was
physical as well as spiritual. Then he rallied, played the man a
moment, and drew his sword. He ran his thumb along the edge of it to
test its keenness; he set the hilt against the ground, and paused. He
had but to place himself with his heart over the point&mdash;so&mdash;and drop
forward. A Roman death was here&mdash;swift and painless. Surely he had
reached the end, and if he took not this easy means of egress there
were the horrors Varano had promised him&mdash;the rack and the hoist.

<p>Then he bethought him of his son. His son would hang at dawn unless
Varano went. And if he killed himself now, Varano must guess the truth,
and would remain. That and the reflection that between Imola and
Camerino much might betide, restrained him. He took up his sword again,
and restored it to its sheath. Steps sounded without; a soldier stood
at the entrance, with a summons from Varano. The traitor braced himself
to go.

<p>As they reached Varano's tent he bethought him of one thing there was
yet to do, and turning to the mercenary who paced behind him, "Quench
me that cresset," he commanded shortly.

<p>The fellow caught up a pail of water standing near, and flung the
contents on the blaze, extinguishing it.

<p>"Why, what is this?" asked Varano, stepping forth.

<p>"There was too much light," said Malipiero glibly. "They can see us
from the castle."

<p>"What then, man?"

<p>"Would you have Cesare Borgia know that you ride forth?" cried
Malipiero, with a very obvious sneer for the thing the other overlooked.

<p>"Ah, true! You are a thoughtful knave. Come now. To horse!"

<p>As they mounted, and were ready to set out&mdash;Malipiero between Varano
and Gianpaolo da Trani, his esquire&mdash;Schwarz, the captain of the
mercenaries, came up. The rumour of Varano's departure running round
the camp had reached the Swiss, and, incredulous, he came for orders.

<p>"Plague me not," growled the Lord Venanzio in answer.

<p>"But, Excellency," the man protested, "shall you be absent long?"

<p>"As long as my business needs."

<p>"Then from whom shall I take orders in the meantime?" cried the
condottiero, out of patience.

<p>"From the devil," said Varano, and gave his horse the spur.

<p>All night they rode, and so desperately that by dawn they were in San
Arcangelo, and Malipiero bethought him with a pang that here, under
this bridge, which gave back a hollow echo of their horses' hoofs,
flowed the ancient fateful Rubicon, which he was crossing figuratively
as well as literally.

<p>Varano, riding half a horse's length in advance of his companions,
pushed on, his face set, his eyes ahead. A mile or so beyond Arcangelo
they were overtaken and passed by two riders going at a gallop, who
thundered away towards Rimini in a cloud of dust. They were the men
despatched by Corella, and they had taken fresh horses at Cesena in the
Duke's name, thus outstripping the weary cattle of the men of Camerino.

<p>Varano watched their speed with eyes of furious envy, and cursed the
spent condition of his own horse. So they pressed on towards Rimini,
their pace slackening now with every mile and in spite of all their
flogging. At last the town was reached, and at the "Three Kings" Varano
bawled for fresh horses with never a thought for breakfast. But horses,
the host regretfully informed them, there were none to be had that
morning.

<p>"Perhaps at Cattolica..." he suggested.

<p>Varano never stayed to argue. He drank a cup of wine and ate a crust,
then heaved himself back into the saddle and urged his companions on.
He was to pay for this unreasoning haste; for it was a haste that
did not make for speed in the end. It took them three hours to reach
Cattolica&mdash;three weary men on three spent horses. And here again they
were met by the same tale of no relays. There would be none until the
evening.

<p>"Until evening?" roared Varano hoarsely. "Why, 'tis not yet noon!"

<p>Malipiero, utterly worn out, had sunk on to a stone bench in the
inn-yard. "Horses or no horses," he groaned, "I can go no farther." His
face was grey, his eyes encircled by black lines. Yet Varano observed
nothing of this, as he turned upon the fellow in a fury of suspicion.
Before he could speak, however, his esquire had come to Malipiero's
rescue.

<p>"Nor I, body of God!" he swore. "Before I ride another mile I must eat
and sleep. What odds, my lord?" he reasoned with the scowling Varano.
"We'll sleep by day, and ride by night. When all is said, it is the
speediest travelling."

<p>"Sleep?" growled Varano. "I had not meant to sleep this side
Camerino&mdash;perhaps, indeed, not then. But since I ride with women...
Pshaw!"

<p>Thus matters stood, then. They rested all that day in Cattolica, and
what hopes of escaping Malipiero may have fostered were quenched
entirely by the lack of means. They resumed their journey again at
dusk, upon fresh horses then provided&mdash;indifferent beasts, however, and
far from such as Varano's hot impatience craved. Again they rode all
night, going westward by Urbino, which was in the hands of Cesare's
revolted captains, then south to Pergola, where they came soon after
daybreak on the morrow.

<p>Thence to Camerino was little more than thirty miles, and Varano
would have gone straight on, but that again the lack of fresh horses
foiled his purpose. It was in vain he swore, besought or threatened.
The country was all topsy-turvy, he was answered, infested with
men-at-arms, and horses were scarce. He must wait until his own were
rested. Until noon, then, they abode there, and now it was that
Malipiero had the inspiration to feign illness, since flight was
impossible.

<p>"My head swims," he had whimpered, "and my loins burn. I am an old man,
my lord, unfit to ride as you have made me ride."

<p>Varano's eyes, dull, aching and bloodshot from his sleeplessness,
measured the other fiercely. "Shalt have a physician in Camerino," said
he.

<p>"But, my lord, it is my fear that I may never get so far."

<p>"Dismiss the fear," Varano enjoined him. "For you shall be there this
evening&mdash;living or dead." And he stalked out, leaving Malipiero cold
with a great fear that already he was suspected. When the hour to
resume the journey came, Malipiero renewed his protestations.

<p>"Mount!" was all the answer Varano returned him, and Malipiero,
resigning himself to the awful fate that awaited him, climbed painfully
to the saddle. He was ill, indeed; between fear and saddle-weariness he
was all but spent. Yet he sat his horse in a sort of desperation, and
so came into Camerino at eventide between his companions.

<p>The place was garrisoned by a small company of Borgia soldiers&mdash;nor
were many needed, for had the Varani attempted to return, the whole
state would have taken up arms to beat them off. Under cover of the
dusk, Venanzio led his companions to a mean hostelry in the borgo.
There he left Malipiero with Gianpaolo&mdash;the latter virtually gaoler to
the former. Alone, Varano went forth to seek for himself the truth of
this vile tale that had been told him.

<p>Meanwhile, Malipiero, wrapped in his cloak, lay stretched on a settle
shivering with horrid anticipation of the hoist and the rack. Soon,
soon now, Varano would discover the treachery, and then&mdash;He groaned
aloud, disturbing Gianpaolo, who sat at table eating.

<p>"Do you suffer, sir?" quoth the esquire; not that he greatly cared, for
he loved Malipiero little, but that it seemed an inquiry which courtesy
demanded. Malipiero groaned again for only answer, and the esquire,
moved to pity, brought the unhappy man a cup of wine.

<p>Malipiero gulped it down. It warmed him, he protested, and begged for
more. Then having drained a second, and after that a third goblet,
he relapsed into his forlorn attitude. But the wine creeping through
his veins inspired him with new courage. He had been too fearful of
consequences, he now perceived. He should have made a dash for it
before this. Even now it might not be too late. There were Borgia
troops in the town. He would find refuge at the citadel. He had but to
inform the captain or the governor, or whoever might be in command,
of Varano's whereabouts in the town, and he would find shelter and
gratitude.

<p>Fired by the notion, he flung off the cloak, and got briskly to his
feet.

<p>"I need air!" he cried.

<p>"I'll open the window," said the too-obliging Gianpaolo.

<p>"The window? Bah! This place is foul. I will take a turn outside."

<p>Gianpaolo, eyeing him curiously&mdash;and with good reason, for the man had
lately sworn he could not move without pain&mdash;barred his way to the door.

<p>"Best await my lord's return," said he.

<p>"Why, I shall be back before then."

<p>But Gianpaolo had his orders&mdash;that Malipiero was not to be allowed
out of his sight. Moreover there was this sudden vigour in one who so
lately had been prostrate from exhaustion. Gianpaolo could not believe
that wine alone had wrought a change so portentous.

<p>"Why, if you will, you will," said he. "But in that case I'll with
you," and he reached for his cap.

<p>Malipiero's face fell at that. But his recovery was swift. Let the fool
come, by all means, if he insisted. Malipiero would march him into a
trap, and quickly. And then, even as he was on the point of consenting,
the stairs groaned under a heavy step; the door was flung open so
violently that it struck against the wall, and Venanzio Varano, with
mad blazing eyes and a brow of thunder, strode into the room.

<p>Malipiero backed away in terror, with an inward curse at his own
tardiness in perceiving the obvious way of escape. Now it was too late.
Varano had learnt the truth already and again Malipiero bethought him
of the rack; already in imagination he felt his sinews cracking and the
rude hands of the executioner upon him.

<p>And then, marvel of marvels, Varano dropped into a chair, and took his
great black head in his hands. A while he remained thus, Gianpaolo
and Malipiero watching him&mdash;the traitor understanding nothing of this
bearing, unable to think what could have happened?

<p>Presently Varano sat up, composed himself, and looked sorrowfully at
Malipiero.

<p>"Malipiero," said he, "I have prayed God ever since we left Imola
that, for some reasons which the rack should tear from you, you had
lied to me. But&mdash;" A sob cut his utterance. "Oh, there is no more pity
in heaven than on earth. This thing is true, it seems&mdash;most vilely,
hideously true."

<p>True! Malipiero's senses reeled an instant under the shock of it. Then
a great warmth thawed his terror-frozen veins; a great exultation sang
within his vile soul; a great thankfulness welled up from his heart to
heaven for this miraculous escape. His spirit capered and jested within
him. He would set up for a diviner, a seer, after this.

<p>Outwardly he remained a pale embodiment of sorrow. He licked his dry
lips, his little eyes sought Varano's and fell away before the awful
glance that met them. So may the damned look.

<p>He wanted to question Varano, to ask how he had discovered this thing,
that he might satisfy himself of the incredible truth of it; and yet he
dared not. Nor was there the need; for presently Varano gave him the
information that he craved.

<p>"I was recognised in the street as I quitted the inn. A man who saw me
come forth followed me, overtook me, and called to me by name. He had
been my servant once, he said, and had ever loved me, wherefore he had
meant this very night to ride forth in quest of me to tell me of the
things that were happening in my absence.

<p>"When I had heard this story I would have gone at once to that accursed
palace where by the Borgia clemency that vile adulteress is housed. But
he stayed my impatience with his counsel. He bade me wait&mdash;wait until
dead midnight, and so make certain. He himself&mdash;this good soul that
loves me&mdash;will watch for me, and will be at hand when I arrive."

<p>He rose violently. His grief and shame dropped from him, and were
replaced by an anger dreadful to behold. Imprecations rained from his
mouth, which was twisted like that of a man in physical suffering. A
mirror hanging from a wall of that poor chamber caught his eye. He
strode to it and scanned himself, rubbing his brow the while. Then with
his clenched fist he shivered the thing to atoms.

<p>"It lied," he roared, and laughed most terribly. "It showed a fair
smooth brow&mdash;no horns&mdash;no horns! I that am antlered like a stag!" And
his awful laugh shook the windows in their crazy frames.

<p>At midnight the Lord Venanzio rose from his chair where he had been
sitting motionless for upwards of an hour. His face was haggard, his
eyes stern and his mouth hard.

<p>"Come," he said quietly, "it is the hour."

<p>Gianpaolo, with a deep sorrow in his heart, and Malipiero, with an
unholy glee in his, followed their lord down the narrow stairs, and out
into the scented autumn night. They went up the steep street to the
palace that crowned the hill. But passing the main doors they struck
down a narrow lane and so came to a wicket in a high wall. A man rose
up before them, seeming to materialise out of the gloom.

<p>"He is within," he murmured to Varano. "He went the usual way, leaving
the gate unlocked."

<p>"That was considerate in him," said Varano heavily, and dropped a purse
into the hands of the spy. Then he pushed the wicket till it opened,
and beckoned his companions after him into a garden that was thick with
shrubs. They came by an alley black as Erebus into a fair clearing
under the stars; and here Varano checked, and gripped Malipiero's wrist.

<p>"Yonder," he snarled. "That is her chamber." And with his other hand he
pointed to a lighted window&mdash;the only window of the palace that still
showed a light. "See with what a warmth it burns&mdash;a Vestal fire!" he
sneered, and laughed softly. Next he sped swiftly forward across the
yielding turf, his companions following. Under her balcony he paused.

<p>"See," he whispered back to them. "Is he not considerate, this gallant?
Look!" And they saw dangling from the balcony a great ladder of silken
rope.

<p>Had Varano still hoped against hope, still set his trust in his wife
against the things he had been told, the letters he had seen, then must
his last hope have foundered here.

<p>He swarmed the ladder with the ease and speed of an ape. They saw him
fling one leg over the stone parapet and then the other; there followed
a crash and ring of shivered glass, as with his shoulder the infuriate
husband smashed a way into the room.

<p>He found his quarry standing in mid-apartment, startled by this
terrific entrance&mdash;a fair young man, tall and comely, decked like a
bridegroom all in white and gold, his discarded doublet still hanging
in his hand.

<p>Varano swooped upon him ere he could utter a word, locked an arm about
his neck, wrenched him backwards, and, dropping on one knee, caught
him, as he fell, across the other. The wretch, half-strangled in that
awful grip, saw a long dagger gleam above him, heard a terrific voice:
"Hound of hell, I am Venanzio Varano. Look on me, and die!"

<p>The dagger sank to the hilt; it was raised again, and yet again, to be
replunged into the heart of this man who had dishonoured him. Then, by
an arm, Varano dragged the warm, twitching body across the room towards
the bed, leaving a great crimson smear in its wake along the mosaic
floor.

<p>"Shalt lie snug tonight," he sneered, "snug and warm, snug and warm.
And this wanton&mdash;" He dropped his hold of the dead arm and turned to
the bed, his thoughts running now directly upon his wife. Clutching his
dagger firmly in one hand he swung aside the heavy curtains with the
other.

<p>"Now, harlot..." He checked. The bed was empty, undisturbed.

<p>The door behind him opened suddenly. He swung about, a horrid,
blood-spattered sight.

<p>On the threshold stood a tall man with a grave dark countenance and
a very martial bearing, a man whose fame was almost as well known to
every soldier in Italy as was the Duke his master's.

<p>"Michele da Corella!" quoth Varano, thunderstruck. "You were in Imola.
What make you here?" Then, his mind swinging back to the weightier
matter that oppressed it. "My wife?" he cried. "Where is Madonna
Eulalia?"

<p>Corella advanced into the room. Behind him pressed a posse of
javelin-men in the Borgia livery of red and yellow.

<p>"Your wife, my lord, is in Bologna&mdash;safe," said he.

<p>Varano, bewildered, stared at Cesare's captain. "Why&mdash;why&mdash;what
treachery is here?" he mumbled thickly, like a drunkard.

<p>"A very foul one, my lord&mdash;yet not one that touches you so nearly as
that other. The traitor is that knave, that scavenger, Malipiero, a
part of whose plot it was most vilely to slander the fair name of the
spotless lady of Venanzio Varano."

<p>"Slander?" echoed, Varano, and "Spotless?" fastening upon those words
amid all that Corella had spoken. "It is not true, then?" he cried.

<p>"As heaven hears me, it is not true," Corella answered. "The people of
Camerino were venting upon Madonna Eulalia their resentment against
your house, my lord; and so, a week ago, she sought shelter with her
father in Bologna. No doubt her courier would reach your camp almost in
the hour in which you left it."

<p>A great sob broke from Varano; tears coursed down his war-worn cheeks.
What signified to him that he had been betrayed in other matters? What
signified losses and reverses so that his Eulalia was true and spotless?

<p>Corella was speaking. Briefly he gave Varano the details of the
treachery by which Malipiero had drawn him away from Imola, so that
Cesare might rout the mercenary rabble that would never stand in its
leader's absence. He had sought to bargain for the life of his son who
was to have hanged for spying and for attempting to murder the Duke.
Cesare, loving the treason but loathing the traitor, had refused to
make terms, promising Malipiero in return for the betrayal he proposed
no more than justice.

<p>"It was by Malipiero's contriving," he pursued, "that I left Imola,
and did what else was necessary to accomplish my lord's wishes in this
matter, even to housing comfortably in this chamber a person whom his
Highness had entrusted to me. My thought was that he would attempt to
escape by the ladder provided for the purpose and that you would take
him as he came forth. Your impatience, my lord&mdash;"

<p>"By the Host!" roared Varano, breaking in, "Cesare Borgia shall answer
to me for having put upon me the slaying of an innocent man."

<p>Corella looked at him a moment with lifted brows. "You have not
understood," he said. He pointed to the corpse. "That carrion was
Gustavo Malipiero."

<p>Varano recoiled. "Gustavo Malipiero? His son?" And he jerked a thumb in
the direction of the window.

<p>"His son."

<p>"My God," said Varano hoarsely. "Is this the justice of your Duke?"

<p>"Ay, my lord, upon the assassin there and the traitor outside; upon
both at one blow&mdash;and that by the hand of yourself, whom Malipiero so
foully abused, and through the very scheme that he invented. Such is
the very perfect justice of my Duke."

<p>Varano looked at Corella. "And incidentally his own purposes are
served," he sneered.

<p>Corella shrugged. But already Varano had turned from him. He took up
the body in his powerful arms, and staggered with it to the shattered
window. He heaved it over the balcony into the garden below "There,
Malipiero," he cried, "is the price of your services to me. Take it,
and begone."

<hr><h2><a name="ch2"></a>2. THE TEST</h2>

<p>THERE was in the army of Cesare Borgia a young Sicilian officer,
Ferrante da Isola by name, who through his military genius, his wisdom
in council and his cunning in strategy rose rapidly to be one of the
Duke's most trusted captains.

<p>This Ferrante was a bastard of the Lord of Isola's; but considering his
father's numerous legitimate progeny, he perceived that in his native
Sicily little scope could await his considerable ambitions. All his
possessions were youth and courage, a long active body and a handsome
face, a quick brain and a blithe, mercurial heart. With these he went
forth from his father's house in quest of a market where such wares
should command their price. He had come to Rome in the autumn of 1500,
the year of the Papal Jubilee, the very season in which Cesare Borgia
was arming for the second campaign of the Romagna. He had found ready
employment; promotion had followed swiftly during the war, in which
he had been constantly conspicuous by his valour and address; and, at
length, when Tiberti was killed before Faenza by the bursting of a gun,
the command that had been Tiberti's was given to Ferrante. Thus within
six months of joining Cesare's army he found himself a full-blown
captain with a condotta of horse under his control, admitted to the
Duke's councils, and enjoying the confidence, and in some measure the
friendship, of his master.

<p>To have achieved so much in so little time augured well for the future.
Ferrante felt that high destinies awaited him, and in this assurance he
permitted himself the luxury of falling in love.

<p>The thing came about in the following summer, as the army emerged from
the Bolognese on its homeward march&mdash;an army much reduced in numbers
by the troops that had been left to garrison the conquered states, and
still further to be reduced by the forces to be sent against Piombino.
Cesare Borgia lay in the pleasant city of Lojano and rested what time
he awaited the solicited sanction of the Signory of Florence to march
his troops through Tuscany, and considered at the same time some easy
means of reducing the little state of San Ciascano which, despite the
fall of Faenza, still held stubbornly against the Duke.

<p>This San Ciascano was something of a thorn in the flesh of Valentinois.
To reduce it were, after all, an easy matter were he to move against it
in force, and devote two or three weeks to besieging and bombarding it.
But other matters claimed his attention. The Pope was urging his return
to Rome; the King of France required his support in the Neapolitan
campaign, and it was not the time to turn aside and spend perhaps a
month in combating the stubbornness of those hillfolk; nor could he
spare any portion of his forces for the work, since all that he could
spare must go against Piombino.

<p>His only course, therefore, was to send some of the troops left in
the Romagna to do this work; and this was a matter that required
consideration and careful planning. Guile should best serve his
purposes&mdash;as it ever did&mdash;if the chance but offered to employ it. So he
schemed and planned what time he waited in Lojano, and in the meantime
our gallant young Ferrante cast eyes of ardent longing upon Cassandra,
the only daughter of the noble and High and Mighty House of Genelleschi.

<p>The captain had first beheld her in the Church of the Annunziata,
whither he had gone to inspect a much-vaunted fresco by Messer
Masaccio&mdash;for he was something of a dabbler in the arts himself, and
had at one time studied painting, though we have no evidence of the
results that followed. It would seem, however, that on this occasion
the Madonna of the Annunciation from the brush of Messer Masaccio was
entirely obscured in the eyes of our young captain by the Madonna
Cassandra of the House of Genelleschi.

<p>Had you questioned him, as he came forth from the church at sunset,
he could not have told you so much as the colour of the veil of the
Madonna in the picture he had gone to see, whilst he could have
described with tedious minuteness every lineament, every detail of
colouring, every particular of shape and every item of raiment of the
living madonna whom he had seen by chance, and upon whom his eyes had
fed for a full hour. And not a doubt but that he would have waxed
rhapsodical in the telling, being of a sudden plunged into that mood of
amorous ecstasy that will make a poet of the meanest of us.

<p>And yet there would have been no need; for there in front, with an
elderly woman in attendance, tripped the lady herself, so that you
might behold her and be spared Ferrante's long-winded rhapsodies.

<p>It was her going that had drawn the soldier forth. It was to the end
that he might still behold her that he came, with never another thought
for Masaccio and the treasures of art, now that so great a treasure of
nature was revealed to him.

<p>He had the wit to reach the holy water font ahead of her, and having
dipped his fingers turned courteously to offer her the moisture that
was clinging to them, which she most graciously accepted, her eyes
downcast after one swift upward glance which, Ferrante said afterwards,
went near to blinding him. He leaned back as for support against the
porphyry font, and never noticed that he was effectively frustrating
the attempts to approach it exerted by her elderly companion.
Abandoning these, at last, the dame made off in the wake of her charge,
flinging back a malevolent glance at the tall young captain who had
thwarted her pious intentions.

<p>Ferrante leaned on, a while, entranced, his eyes following the two
women as they crossed the little square in the gathering dusk. But he
saw them not. What he saw was a little oval face of the colour of old
ivory, framed in shining tresses of black hair confined in a golden
net; lips that were red with the warm red of pomegranate blossoms, and
eyes that were blue as the Adriatic&mdash;eyes whose one fleeting glance had
burned itself for ever into his memory.

<p>At last he stirred; stirred as she reached the farther side of the
square and was on the point of vanishing into the gloom of one of the
narrow streets that flowed from it. He came down the wide steps of the
church, and moved to follow her. It was not an evening on which such a
maid should be abroad with no more protection than that of an old dame.
The town was a-swarm with soldiers&mdash;great, aggressive Swiss, peppery
Gascons, passionate Spaniards and too-gay Italians. Not even the iron
discipline of the Duke might save that child from untoward consequences
of her innocent daring in venturing forth thus at nightfall. He was
chilled at the thought of the indignities that might be offered her as
she went, and he quickened his pace. He overtook them swiftly, and not
a moment too soon, it seemed.

<p>Four men, two of whom he recognised as of his own condotta, were
lurching down the street with arms linked, forming a human chain which
now barred the women's progress. The dame, taken with fear, came to a
standstill, and clutched her companion's arm. Thereupon jests flew from
the men-at-arms&mdash;the rude, heavily salted jests of campaigners&mdash;and
they swooped down suddenly upon the women.

<p>Simultaneously came quick steps and the ring of spurs behind the
latter, and so they stood rooted there in a great fear, deeming
themselves taken between two fires. Then, suddenly, a brisk voice rang
out, stem with command, and at the sound of it the soldiers obediently
fell aside, leaving the way clear.

<p>The dame looked up, to find the tall young captain of the font standing
at her side. And at sight of him, and in view of the effect of his
presence and command, relief overspread her broad face, to be quickly
followed by mistrust of the singlemindedness of this intervention.

<p>Ferrante addressed himself&mdash;cap in hand, and bowing with the grace of
the perfect courtier&mdash;to the mistress. "Madonna, you may pursue your
way; yet suffer that I pursue it with you. Lojano is unpleasantly full
of soldiers, and my escort may not come amiss."

<p>It was the dame who answered&mdash;quickly, as if to forestall her
mistress&mdash;and Ferrante, hungering to hear the lady's voice, was angered.

<p>"Sir," said she, "it is not far. Madonna's brothers shall thank your
Excellency."

<p>"I ask no thanks," he answered, a thought surlily; then added, with
more characteristic grace: "'Tis I shall thank madonna for the honour
of having used me as her escort."

<p>The lady seemed on the point of answering; but again the dame
forestalled her, rendered more mistrustful than ever by the sugariness
of the soldier's speech. Ferrante vented his vexation on the four
men-at-arms who stood grinning there, holding of their captain's
conduct in this matter precisely the same view as did the dame.

<p>"If you would be spared the attentions of the provost-marshal," said
he, "you would do well to remember the orders of his Highness, and
respect all persons and property."

<p>The men stood silent under the rebuke. But ere he had taken a dozen
paces up the street beside his charges, he heard a smothered laugh
behind him, and then one of the soldiers, mimicking his accents: "We
are to respect persons and property, remember."

<p>"And when," said another, "the person is the property, or the intended
property, of the captain, why&mdash;by Bacchus!&mdash;we are to turn our eyes
the other way, like good little brothers of St Francis!" Ferrante
glowered wrathfully, and for a moment was on the point of turning back
to chastise this overdaring jester. But chancing to glance aside at the
dame, he found her eyeing him with an expression of mingled fear and
malevolence that stung him into an even swifter anger.

<p>"Foul-minded knaves," said he, leaning towards her, and jerking his
thumb backwards over his shoulder. "Foul-minded as waiting-women."

<p>She bridled, and flushed to a dull purple. Not a doubt but that her
anger was no more than just controlled by prudence. She spoke, in an
acid, vinegary voice: "I think, sir, we need not trouble you further.
We shall be safe alone."

<p>"Say 'safer,' mistress, since 'tis what is in your mind," he snapped;
then to the lady, "I trust, madonna," said he, in a different tone,
"that you do not share your woman's unworthy fears?"

<p>Still he was not to hear her voice; again it was the dame who answered
him.

<p>"I said but, sir, that we should be safe alone. If you construe more
than that into my words, you do so out of your knowledge of yourself."

<p>Even as she spoke, two burly Swiss swung into view, turning a corner
of the street. They were singing lustily but tunelessly; for they
were very drunk. Ferrante looked at them, and from them to the dame,
a thought mockingly, for there was fear writ large on her broad
face&mdash;fear lest he should take her at her word, and leave them.

<p>"Woman," said he, "you are a bargue tossing between Scylla and
Charybdis." Then he stooped to add confidentially: "Courtesy, believe
me, makes a good pilot." And with that he led them past the noisy
Swiss, and on with no more word spoken.

<p>Thus in a silence that in the end grew sullen they came to a very noble
palace in the town's main street. Over the door was a great escutcheon
of stone supported by two lions couchant; but Ferrante could not
discern the blazon in the failing light.

<p>The women had halted, and now surely, he thought, he should hear the
lady's voice at last. He peered at the little face that showed so white
and ghostly in the dusk. In the distance a boy was singing; down the
street two men were passing with heavy tread and clanking spurs, and
Ferrante cursed one and the other producer of these noises, lest they
should cause him to miss a note of the music with which his ears were
about to be rejoiced. But he might have spared himself the pains. For
yet again it was the dame who spoke, and in that moment he hated her
voice more than any sound that he had ever heard.

<p>She thanked him curtly, and dismissed him. Dismissed him thus, like a
groom, on the doorstep, she who had said that madonna's brothers should
thank him. True, he had disclaimed the need for thanks, and by that
must now abide; but was it courteous to have accepted his disclaimer?
Oh, the thing had its bitterness! True, the lady had thrown him a
smile, and had curtsied prettily; but what are a smile and a curtsy to
one who hungers for words?

<p>He bowed profoundly, and turned away, hurt and angry, as the women
vanished within the cavernous portals of the mansion. He gripped by the
shoulder a citizen who chanced to pass him at that moment. He had a
lean sinewy hand, and the citizen's flesh was pampered and tender, his
soul timid. The fellow squealed in this sudden grip.

<p>"Whose arms are those?" quoth Ferrante.

<p>"Eh? Arms?" gasped the citizen. "Oh&mdash;ah! Those? The arms of the
Genelleschi, Excellency."

<p>Ferrante thanked him, and went his way to his own quarters.

<p>And now of a sudden it seemed that this Ferrante became a man of most
fervent piety. Leastways he was to be found in the Church of the
Annunziata each morning for early Mass, though the form of devotion
that took him thither was not one that had to do with the salvation of
his soul. He went that he might daily feast his eyes upon Cassandra de'
Genelleschi. He had learnt her name by now.

<p>Thus a week sped, and in that little time a great change was wrought in
the captain's nature. Hitherto he had been a soldier to the exclusion
of all else, the very pattern of what a condottiero should be, holding
his men submissive as the limbs of a body whereof he was the brain. Now
he became a dreamer, taking little account of his company, and swiftly
losing his grip of the unruly troopers who served under him, so that
they fell to committing offences against the Borgia discipline until
the matter came to the ears of Cesare, who summoned Ferrante to his
presence, and sternly admonished him.

<p>Ferrante excused himself lamely; put forth the lamentable plea of
ignorance of what might be toward; wherefore he was reprimanded and
bidden to guard against the repetition of such outrages as had lately
been perpetrated by his men. He left the Duke's presence in an anger
that promised ill for his followers, but which was presently forgotten
in a daydream revolving about the white beauty of Cassandra de'
Genelleschi.

<p>His love-sickness touched a crisis. He could not so continue. The daily
sight of her in church was no nourishment for his starving soul; indeed
it was a provocation. His repeated attempts to engage her in speech
had been frustrated by the ever-present dame, and so, being driven
to despair, he determined that the citadel must be bombarded if he
would ever hoist his colours there. To this bombardment he proceeded,
and for his missile he employed a letter&mdash;a most wonderful perfervid
composition reflecting the extent of his distemper.

<p>"<i>Cavissima Cassandra, madonna diletissima,"</i> he addressed her, having
cut a pen, for good omen, from the feather of an eagle's wing. "You
have heard tell," he wrote, "the sad story of Prometheus, and the pangs
he suffered of having his liver daily fed upon by the bird of Jupiter.
'Tis a very piteous tale, which must have moved your gentle heart. But
how infinitely more piteous am I, how infinitely greater is the anguish
I endure, whose very heart is daily rent, torn and devoured by my
ardent longings, I who am chained by love's fetters to the dark rock of
despair! Compassionate me, then, <i>madonna mia</i>," he pursued, and much
more in this hyperbolic strain, which in saner moments must have moved
him to derision.

<p>The mad letter he despatched to her by an esquire, who was to see
it safely into her own hands, waylaying her for the purpose at the
palace door. This did the esquire, as he was bidden. Nevertheless, the
letter passed unread into the hands of Leocadia, the waiting-woman.
She would have read it, but that she lacked the art; so she bore it to
Cassandra's brothers, informing them whom she suspected was the sender,
and also how this same Borgia captain had hung about their heels for
this week past as though he had been their very shadow.

<p>Tito, the elder, heard and frowned, read the letter and laughed between
contempt and anger, then passed it to Girolamo, who swore unpleasant
oaths and lastly bade Leocadia call their sister.

<p>"Who is this man Ferrante?" inquired Girolamo, when the woman departed
on her errand.

<p>Tito, who was pacing the chamber, stopped short and snorted
contemptuously. "A by-blow of the Sicilian Lord of Isola by a peasant
woman&mdash;a base knave of no fortune, an adventurer, who likely seeks to
use our house and an alliance with it as a means to his ends."

<p>"As an end in itself, more likely," answered Girolamo, shifting in his
chair. "You are very well informed concerning him."

<p>"As to that&mdash;he is of some prominence in the Borgia train, and has
command of a condotta," Tito explained. "A handsome dog; and Cassandra,
being a woman and a fool&mdash;" He spread his hands, sneering. Girolamo
scowled.

<p>They were both swarthy, hawk-faced men, these Genelleschi, and much
older than their sister, towards whom their attitude was paternal
rather than fraternal.

<p>She entered presently, ushered by Leocadia, and she looked at them with
a something of fear clouding the effulgence of her eyes.

<p>Girolamo rose, and proffered her a chair; she smiled at him, and took
her seat, folding white useless hands in the lap of her blue gown.

<p>It was Tito who addressed her. "So, Cassandra," said he, "it seems you
have a lover."

<p>"A&mdash;a lover? I?" said she. "Of your choosing, Tito?" She had a rather
high-pitched voice that was quite colourless, and&mdash;to one skilled in
tones&mdash;gave index to the extreme feebleness of her mind.

<p>"Of my choosing, ninny?" echoed Tito, mimicking her accents. He never
had much patience with her. "Via! Pretend less innocence, my lady. Read
me this letter. It was intended for you."

<p>Cassandra took the paper from Tito, and knit her brows. Slowly and
with great labour she set herself to decipher the heavy scrawl of her
soldier-lover. At length she appealed to Girolamo.

<p>"Will you read it for me?" she begged. "I am but indifferent skilled,
and the writing here is&mdash;"

<p>"Pah! Give it me," broke in Tito, sneering; and snatching it
impatiently away from her, he read it aloud. When he had done he looked
at her, and she returned his glance quite blandly.

<p>"Who is Messer Prometheus?" she inquired.

<p>Tito glared savagely, inflamed by the inconsequence of her question.
"A fool who overreached himself like this one," he answered, tapping
the letter. "It is not of Prometheus that I would hear you talk; but of
this Ferrante. What is he to you?"

<p>"To me? Why, naught."

<p>"Hast seen him none the less. Hast ever spoke to him?"

<p>It was Leocadia who answered. "Nay, my lord. I saw to that," said she.

<p>"Ah!" said Tito. "He has addressed you, then?"

<p>"Daily, my lord&mdash;on leaving church."

<p>Tito considered her sternly; then turned again to his sister. "This
man," he said, "seeks to court you, Cassandra."

<p>Cassandra giggled. There was a tiny mirror in the heart of her fan of
white ostrich plumes. In this she now surveyed herself, and the gesture
was very eloquent.

<p>"You think it little marvel, eh?" put in Girolamo. Yet, though
sardonic, he was more gentle than his brother in addressing her.

<p>She giggled again, looking from her mirror to her brothers. "I am very
comely," said she, with conviction. "And the gentleman is not blind."

<p>Tito laughed loud and harshly. He scented danger. Fools such as his
sister, whose only sense was a sense of vanity&mdash;he had no illusions
on the score of her&mdash;were all too prone to responsiveness to a man's
admiration, and to go to foolish lengths in that responsiveness. Her
views regarding Messer Ferrante must be corrected.

<p>"Fool," said he contemptuously, "do you conceive that this adventurer
is taken by your white face and baby eyes?"

<p>"With what else, then, pray?" quoth she, her brows arched upwards.

<p>"With the name of Genelleschi and the portion that is yours. What else
have you that shall draw a needy adventurer?"

<p>A flush overspread the pretty, foolish face. "Is it so?" she asked,
turning to Girolamo. "Is it indeed so?" Her tone quivered a little.

<p>Girolamo flung out his hands and shrugged. "Beyond all doubt," he
assured her. "We have sound knowledge."

<p>Her eyes glistened and were magnified by sudden tears. "I thank you for
this timely warning," said she&mdash;and they saw that she was in a great
rage&mdash;the rage that springs of vanity scarified. She rose. "Should this
fellow again address me, I shall know what answer to return him." She
paused a moment. "Shall I send a reply to that insolent letter?" she
asked them.

<p>"Best not," said Tito. "Silence will be the best mark of your contempt.
Besides," he added, sneering, "your writing being more difficult to
read even than his, might leave him in some doubt as to your real
intentions."

<p>She stamped a very shapely foot clad in a shoe of cloth-of-gold,
turned, and angrily departed with her woman.

<p>Tito looked at Girolamo, and sat down.

<p>"You have been well advised," said Girolamo, "and you have set up an
effective barrier."

<p>"Pooh!" said Tito. "A woman's vanity is an instrument upon which the
merest fool may play any tune he pleases. But I shall set up a more
effective barrier still&mdash;the barrier of a tombstone&mdash;ere I've done.
This insolent upstart shall be punished. To dare&mdash;to dare!" he cried.

<p>Girolamo shrugged. "We have done enough," said he. "Be content with
that. More might be dangerous to ourselves. This knave of Isola stands
well in the esteem of Cesare Borgia. If he should come to any harm, the
Duke might exact a heavy price."

<p>"Maybe," said Tito, and there for the moment let the matter lie,
chiefly for lack of means to accomplish the thing that he desired.

<p>But when on the morrow he went to pay his court to this Borgia, for
whom he had scant love, he heard a matter discussed in the antechamber
that set him thinking. This matter concerned Ferrante. Men were talking
of the change that had come upon the captain; of the want of discipline
in his condotta, which had been the most orderly in the entire army,
and of the Duke's grave displeasure at this state of things. Messer
Tito, gathering a sudden inspiration from all this, went presently to
beg private audience of the Duke.

<p>Cesare was at work with his secretary in a pleasant sunny chamber
whose balcony overlooked a garden all ablaze with blossom. Gherardi
was writing, to the Duke's dictation, a letter to Messer Ramiro de
Lorqua, Cesare's Governor of Forli. It was a letter that concerned the
reduction of San Ciascano; and Valentinois, as he lightly paced the
chamber, smiled as he dictated, for at last he had hit upon a plan to
make a sudden end of that troublesome resistance.

<p>Gherardi concluded the despatch, and rose to make way for Cesare, that
the latter might append his signature. At that moment a chamberlain
entered with Messer de' Genelleschi's request for a private audience.

<p>Cesare paused, holding his ink-laden pen suspended, and his eyes
narrowed.

<p>"Genelleschi, eh?" said he, and there was no pleasure in the tone.
"Admit him."

<p>He looked at his secretary. "What's here, eh, Agabito? This man's
friendship for Bologna is notorious, yet he hangs about my court and
now he demands audience of me. It would little surprise me to find him
a spy of the Bentivogli, or of those interested in San Ciascano."

<p>Gherardi slowly pursed his lips, and slowly shook his head. "We have
had him closely watched&mdash;quite fruitlessly, my lord."

<p>"Ah!" said Cesare, plainly unconvinced.

<p>Then the door opened, and the chamberlain ushered in Messer Tito de'
Genelleschi. The Duke drew the letter to him, and signed it "Cesare"
swiftly and with a great flourish. He passed it to Gherardi, who stood
at his elbow, and bade him seal it. Then, at last, he slowly turned his
eyes upon the newcomer, who had advanced to the middle of the room,
and&mdash;great man though he was in Lojano&mdash;stood there, like a lackey,
awaiting the Duke's pleasure.

<p>Cesare's beautiful eyes turned dreamily upon him, with no hint of
the scrutiny they were exerting, and Cesare's voice very gentle and
musical, invited him to speak.

<p>"Highness," said Tito, "I have a grievance."

<p>"Against us?" quoth Cesare, in a manner that invited confidence.

<p>"Against certain men-at-arms of your following."

<p>"Ah!" There was undoubtedly a quickened interest in the tone. "Proceed,
I beg, sir. This is a matter which it imports that we should know."

<p>And now Tito unfolded the pretty tale he had prepared, which had it
that on three occasions his sister and her waiting-woman had suffered
rudeness at the hands of certain soldiers in the town&mdash;such rudeness
that they dared no longer go forth save under an escort of armed
lackeys.

<p>Cesare's eyes kindled with anger as he listened. "An example shall be
made," said he. "Can you afford me particulars that will help me to lay
hands on the offenders?"

<p>"No more than that they were men of Messer Ferrante da Isola's
condotta."

<p>The anger grew in the Duke's tone and glance. "Ferrante again!" he
exclaimed. "But this exceeds all bounds." Then suddenly, his voice
sharp as a knife's edge, "How know you they were Ferrante's?" he asked.

<p>The question took Tito entirely unawares. The fool had not dreamed
that a great man like Cesare would stoop to petty details of "how" and
"why." It was unworthy, and it was unusual, and so, unfortunately,
Messer Tito had no answer ready. This he betrayed by his foolish
expression, by the foolish blinking of his eyes under that glance of
Cesare's which of a sudden had become cold and searching.

<p>"Why&mdash;" he began, drawling that he might have time to think, and
laughing to cover his confusion, "in the first place they were horse
soldiers, and in the second&mdash;why&mdash;it was gathered from remarks that
they let fall."

<p>"Ah! And these remarks&mdash;what were they?"

<p>"You see, Highness," explained the other, "I am but giving you the
facts as related to me by my sister and her woman; unfortunately it did
not occur to me to examine them so minutely."

<p>Cesare nodded his head. "And you were justified by the manner in which
justice has been dispensed in Italy. But my justice is not so. Your
oversight shall be repaired at once," he continued briskly. "I'll sift
this to the dregs, that there may be no misapprehension. Agabito, let a
messenger summon Messer Tito's sister and her woman instantly."

<p>But as Agabito was departing on this errand, the Duke stopped him.
Tito's face&mdash;the sudden consternation of it&mdash;had told Cesare all he
sought to learn.

<p>"Wait," he said, and leaned back in his chair, laying tapering
fingertips together, and smiling as if in self-contempt. "After all,
where is the need? No, no, Agabito; we may confidently take Messer
Tito's statement to be correct. For of course these men of Ferrante's
would be known to the lady by their device."

<p>"Ah, yes, yes," cried Tito eagerly. "'Twas that, Highness. It had
escaped my memory."

<p>"It might well," said Cesare. "So slight a detail. But now that you
recall it, do you by chance remember what the device was?"

<p>Here Tito knit his brows, took his shaven chin in his hands, and
appeared to be in a very travail of recollection. "Now let me see," he
muttered. "Surely, surely, I remember. I&mdash;"

<p>"Would it be blue and white?" quoth Cesare gently.

<p>Tito smacked fist into palm. "Blue and white&mdash;blue and white, of
course," said he. "'Twas so&mdash;'twas blue and white indeed. How came I to
forget it?"

<p>Agabito stooped low over the papers at the table, to hide the smile
he could not repress&mdash;for the men of Ferrante's condotta wore no such
badge at all.

<p>"The matter shall be dealt with," said Cesare. "Ferrante shall be
called to account at once. Note that, Agabito," the Duke commanded.
Then he leaned forward, pondering for a brief moment. That Tito had
lied to him he was assured beyond all doubt; but it remained for him to
discover Tito's full aim and motive. Was it Ferrante he sought to harm?
Cesare set himself to find an answer to that question.

<p>"I deplore this matter, Messer Tito," said he, with a very gracious
courtesy. "It is not usual in my troops to give occasion for complaint.
They are sternly schooled. But this Ferrante latterly&mdash;by the Host!&mdash;I
know not what ails him!"

<p>"Like enough it will be the company be keeps," suggested Tito, and thus
advanced another step into his morass of falsehood.

<p>"Why, what company is that?"

<p>But now Tito made a feint of seeking to draw back. "Ah&mdash;no, no! I've
been indiscreet. I have said more than was my intent. Forget it,
Highness."

<p>"Messer Tito," said Valentinois very sternly, "do you trifle with me?
Am I a man from whom things are thus to be concealed?"

<p>"But, my lord, I beseech you! If I were to say what it was in my mind
to say, it might..it might&mdash;" He waved helpless hands.

<p>"Might it?" said Cesare, his brows raised. "Then let it, I beg you&mdash;and
without more delay, for I have other suitors awaiting audience this
morning. Come, sir, speak! What company do you imply is kept by
Ferrante da Isola?"

<p>"Imply? Oh, Highness!"

<p>"State, then&mdash;I care not. Come, man, come. In what company have you
heard of his being seen?"

<p>"Heard? Should I accuse a man on hearsay? Ah, no. I speak of what I
have seen, Highness. On more occasions than one have I beheld this man
of yours in a tavern of the borgo in the company of some gentlemen of
Bologna who are well known to me. It may be innocent. It may be."

<p>Cesare looked at him very coldly now. "You are implying, sir, that
Ferrante da Isola consorts with enemies of mine to my hurt."

<p>"Oh, my lord! Acquit me of that, I beseech you. I imply nothing. I but
state what I have seen. The rest is but what you, yourself, infer,
Highness; not what I imply."

<p>"You could if necessary make oath concerning these same facts?"

<p>"I am quite ready, should you doubt my word," said Tito, with a sudden
access of dignity.

<p>"To perjure yourself?" quoth Cesare softly.

<p>"To perjure myself?" cried Tito, his tone of a sudden mighty haughty.

<p>Cesare was silent a moment, his fingers toying at his tawny beard, the
faintest shadow of a smile quivering about his lips. Then he shrugged
contemptuously, and looked the other straight between the eyes.

<p>"Messer Tito, I do not believe you," he said.

<p>An angry scowl crumpled the smoothness of Genelleschi's brow, and his
quickened blood glowed through the tan of his cheeks. That he had lied,
and knew it, did not temper his indignation at being given the lie thus
coldly and calmly&mdash;and before a witness, too. There were men enough in
Italy who would there and then have leaped at the Duke's throat for
such a speech. But Genelleschi was not of these.

<p>"Highness," he exclaimed, in haughty and indignant protest, "you forget
that my name is Genelleschi."

<p>Cesare smiled, displaying teeth of a dazzling whiteness. He rose,
slender and graceful in his deep purple surcoat.

<p>"Tis you forget that mine is Cesare Borgia." His eyes caught Messer
Tito's glance, and held it captive. "As deeply as I abhor a liar, just
so deeply do I love an honest, loyal soul; and such an honest, loyal
soul is Ferrante da Isola."

<p>"Complete your meaning, Excellency," cried the other, his voice now
thick with wrath.

<p>"Is there the need?" smiled Cesare.

<p>Genelleschi all but choked. He felt that, if he remained, the wave of
fiery anger that his soul sent forth would whelm all caution; so he
bowed low&mdash;too low for courtesy pure and unalloyed.

<p>"Your Highness will suffer me to take my leave," he said, and turned to
depart.

<p>"I trust that is the most that you shall ever take of me, sir," said
the Duke, and dismissed him with a gesture.

<p>But as Genelleschi reached the door Cesare's voice arrested him. "Stay,
Messer Tito. You may be conceiving that I have used you harshly." His
eyes had narrowed suddenly, but Tito saw naught of this. "You may
conceive that you have had an ill return for the service you came
here to render me in warning me of this man's treachery; that it
would better sort with the ways of justice in which I claim to walk
that I should satisfy myself that Ferrante is indeed innocent before
convicting you of falsehood."

<p>"I confess, Magnificent," answered Tito, with a mock deference that did
not escape the Duke, "that some such thought was in my mind."

<p>"Bethink you, though," returned the Duke, speaking slowly, "that
Ferrante's infatuation for your sister is known to me, as is also
known that you and your brother account him an upstart of low birth,
whose suit is an offence to your lofty station, whose throat you would
cut but for the fear that I might take heavy payment for the life of
an officer I rate so highly. Consider that I know all this, and ask
yourself how can I believe your accusation, unsupported by any proofs,
against a man whose loyalty to me has been tried a dozen times."

<p>Messer Tito blinked in sheer surprise at the extent of Cesare's
knowledge, and was confounded by it&mdash;not realising that much of this
same knowledge was inference, and the inspiration of the moment in that
most subtle brain.

<p>His recovery was swift from that confusion which showed Cesare how
truly aimed had been his shaft. To deny his attitude towards Ferrante,
Tito realised, would be futile. But he could still belittle it; still
claim that he brought Cesare this warning out of pure loyalty&mdash;must
have brought it him though his own brother had been the traitor.

<p>Cesare smiled at that phase of Tito's protestations, and his smile
added fuel to the other's flaming wrath.

<p>"You say that my word is unsupported by any proofs, Magnificent. In
Lojano the word of Genelleschi is accounted proof enough of anything he
says."

<p>"I do not gainsay it. But why should not I prefer to place my trust in
Ferrante, whom I have ever found loyal?"

<p>"I have warned you, Magnificent," cried the other. "I have no more to
say."

<p>The Duke stood pondering a moment, staring through the window at the
red roofs of Lojano. Then he turned again to Messer Tito.

<p>"My disbelief in you shall be justified," he said. "I will put him to
the test. If he fail me, I shall do penance to you for my unbelief.
But woe betide you if he comes unscathed through the ordeal. Will you
accept the wager?"

<p>Genelleschi, knowing the utter falseness of the accusations he had
brought, knowing the loyalty of the man he had defamed, quailed at the
question. But he stood committed by what he had said.

<p>"I accept," he answered, and went so far as to invest with pretended
eagerness his answer. Whatever might follow, he must now appear sincere.

<p>Cesare cogitated him in silence a moment, then crossed back to
the table from which he had moved, and took up a package freshly
sealed&mdash;the letter to Ramiro de Lorqua which Agabito had just prepared.

<p>"At Imola," he said, "lies Ramiro de Lorqua with two thousand men,
awaiting my orders for the attack upon San Ciascano. Those orders are
in this letter. Ferrante knows that Caserta and the defenders of San
Ciascano would pay handsomely to learn the contents. This letter shall
go by Ferrante's hand tonight. That shall be the test."

<p>"But, Highness," cried Tito, with cunning concern, "if he should betray
you! Have you counted the cost to yourself?"

<p>"I know the cost, sir," was Cesare's answer, his face inscrutable.
"Thus do I justify myself for testing him." And with that he gave
Genelleschi his dismissal.

<p>Tito Genelleschi went home with very mingled sensations. Things had
fallen out in a most amazing manner, and had exceeded by much any
intentions of his own when he had sought audience of the Duke. He
had the feeling of one who has been swept along by sheer chance, and
force of circumstances, into committing himself to far more than he
had ever dreamed of at the outset. He was pervaded, too, by a grave
misgiving&mdash;an uneasiness as to what steps Cesare might take against
him when Ferrante emerged triumphant from the test, as Ferrante must;
for Messer Tito had no cause to doubt the man's exceeding loyalty
to his master. The Duke had threatened him with vague consequences
of his accusation should Ferrante's conduct prove it false. There
was need for action on his part; he must take his measures; in some
way he must contrive that Ferrante's letter should miscarry; it but
remained to devise the means, to determine upon a plan. Thus, and again
compelled by sheer force of circumstances in very self-defence to
carry through this matter to which he had so rashly set his mind, did
Tito Genelleschi become an active traitor to Cesare Borgia. Ferrante
must fail; Cesare Borgia must pay the price of having said to Tito
Genelleschi, "I do not believe you."

<p>Tito sought counsel with his brother. The latter's face became grave
when he heard how Tito stood committed, and he criticised the matter
freely and harshly. His elder brother lost patience.

<p>"What's done is done," he broke in, very surly. "And what's to do is to
do; we should do better to consider that."

<p>"Ah!" said Girolamo. "And what is to do?"

<p>Thus abruptly questioned, Tito as abruptly replied, and in doing so
answered not only his brother's words but his own perplexity.

<p>"The contents of that letter," said he, "must be made known to the
defenders of San Ciascano, that the plans of Valentinois may be
wrecked, and that thus he may be persuaded that Ferrante is a traitor."

<p>Girolamo looked at him, his lips pursed, his eyes scared.

<p>"Yes," he said slowly, "that of course is what you would wish. It is
daring to the point of madness. Fortunately it is also impossible."

<p>"Say you so? Ha!" It was a snort of anger. Tito felt that his endurance
that morning was being sorely taxed. "Impossible, eh?" And then, on
the instant, as he eyed his brother, inspiration came in answer to the
urgent call of his rage. His rising anger sank again upon the instant.
His eyes dilated with surprise at his own conceit. A superior smile
twisted his thin lips.

<p>"Impossible, eh?" he repeated, in such a manner that it became plain to
Girolamo that his brother had solved the riddle. But Tito vouchsafed
him no enlightenment just yet. He sent for Cassandra.

<p>"What has Cassandra to do with this?" inquired Girolamo.

<p>"Everything," said Tito, with a great assurance.

<p>When she came, Tito set a chair at the table for her, motioned her into
it, then placed ink, pens and paper before her.

<p>"You are to write a letter, Cassandra, to your fine lover&mdash;to this
Ferrante da Isola," said he.

<p>Her great eyes regarded him with astonishment, which for the moment
lighted the dullness of her beautiful, vacant face.

<p>"You are to confess yourself moved by this letter&mdash;stirred to the very
soul of you. Ah&mdash;you have a soul, Cassandra?" he inquired, with the
sneer that he held ever in readiness. Her stupidity was a constant
irritation to him, the keener when he considered her faultless beauty.

<p>"Fra Giorgio has taught me so," she answered, impervious as ever to the
subtleties of sarcasm.

<p>"Fra Giorgio is a fool," said he.

<p>"You must not say so, Tito," she admonished him. "Fra Giorgio says that
it is sinful to mock at priests."

<p>"By which, conscious of the mockery he must provoke, he means that it
is sinful to mock at him. But our business is with Messer Ferrante."

<p>"Yes, Tito," said she.

<p>"You shall write, then, that, moved by his burning epistle&mdash;and&mdash;and
the thought of his heart suffering the same fate as the&mdash;liver of
Messer Prometheus, you desire more knowledge of him."

<p>"Oh, but I do not. He is too tall and lean and ugly; and he is
beardless, and I love a beard."

<p>"Tchah!" snapped Tito peevishly. "Attend to me. You are to write him
as I bid you; what you may think is another matter, with which we have
no concern. You shall say that we&mdash;Girolamo and I&mdash;are from home, and
bid him come to you this evening at sunset. Ah&mdash;and by the garden gate;
that will have a more furtive, romantic air, which, doubtless, will
impress the Sicilian dog, eh, Girolamo?"

<p>Girolamo shrugged. "You forget I do not share your confidence," said
his brother.

<p>"But you can guess the rest. He will come, Cassandra, not a doubt of
that, and for a while&mdash;an hour, say&mdash;you may pretend to him and to
yourself that he is indeed your lover, and hold him in dalliance with
you in the garden, there. Then&mdash;But I'll school you in the rest. The
letter first. Come, girl; here is what you need."

<p>She took a pen, dipped it, and poised it above a sheet of paper. Her
delicate brows were drawn together in perplexity, wondering what all
this should portend. At last she asked Girolamo; she preferred always
to address her questions to him; he was wont to answer her with less
impatience than Tito.

<p>"Why am I to do this?"

<p>"It is Tito's affair," said Girolamo. "But the object is to punish this
upstart for the affront he has put upon us in daring to lift his eyes
to you."

<p>"How will you punish him?" she asked, smiling interestedly now, athirst
for details.

<p>"That you shall learn presently," cut in Tito. "First the letter&mdash;the
letter. Come, begin."

<p>"How shall I begin?"

<p>Tito flung himself into a chair, and peevishly dictated the epistle,
she laboriously penning the words he flung at her with ever-growing
impatience. And by eccentricities of spelling, and vagaries of
handwriting, she achieved a document at last which should afford Messer
Ferrante some considerable mental exercise. So said Tito when he
scowlingly surveyed the scrawl. He dispatched it none the less to the
captain's quarters by a young maid of the house, and then made known to
Girolamo the remainder of his plot, and to Cassandra just so much as it
imported her to know, schooling her carefully in what was required of
her.

<p>Girolamo acknowledged the plan to be shrewd, deplored certain elements
of danger it contained, and finally expressed the opinion that
Ferrante, charged with such a mission and in the very hour of setting
out upon it, would not come, whatever his feelings for Cassandra. Tito
scoffed at his brother's conception of a lover.

<p>"Oh, he will come; he will come, never fear," said Tito, "and in the
fact that he will never dare confess that small breach of duty lies our
own security from those minor dangers that seem so big to you."

<p>That there were full grounds for Tito's assurance the evening proved.
For as the Angelus was ringing from the Duomo adown the street at the
back of the Palazzo Genelleschi came the rattle of hoofs, to halt by
the green door by the tall brown wall.

<p>The brothers were sitting with Cassandra at the trysting spot by
an old lichened fountain that spouted into a little lake in which
Girolamo&mdash;who was an Epicurean&mdash;cultivated frogs and eels.

<p>At the sound of hoofs Tito became attentive; when they halted he rose,
caught his brother by the arm and vanished with him into the house.

<p>Alone on the stone seat beside the fountain Cassandra waited, and was
faintly taken with a desire to laugh. But her waiting was brief, and
presently she saw the tall figure of her lover advancing towards her
in the twilight. He was all cased in grey leather, save for the band
of claret hose which showed between his thigh-boots and his jerkin,
and the steel cap and gorget gleaming like silver on his head and at
his neck. His face was pale with emotion under the tan of it, and his
eyes, when he came to fall upon one knee beside her, were the eyes of a
fanatic at prayer.

<p>"Madonna," he murmured, "you have shown me a mercy beyond all my
deserts; given me a happiness such as I dreamt not that life could
hold. I scarce dared to hope that you would deign return an answer to
my poor scrawl. That you should bid me come to you and give utterance
in words to all the fierce longings that are my torture was something
that not even my dreams had dared to promise me." She sat&mdash;the demurest
maid in all Italy that evening&mdash;with folded hands and downcast eyes,
listening to this madman's babble. And now that he paused she made him
no answer, for the excellent reason that she could think of none.

<p>"You will forgive me that I come before you thus&mdash;in this campaigner's
raiment. It is not so I had seen myself paying my court and homage at
your feet. But I go tonight upon a journey and a mission. Indeed, but
for the hunger of my eyes to look once again upon your peerless beauty,
but for the hunger of my ears to hear the melodies of your sweet
accents&mdash;I had by now&mdash;were I full dutiful to the Duke, my master&mdash;been
out of Lojano. Do you, madonna, absolve me for my want of duty and for
my condition?"

<p>He knelt there looking up almost timidly&mdash;and he the captain of a score
of battles&mdash;at this fair child, who was to him the incarnation of all
that is good and beautiful and noble upon earth.

<p>She viewed him languidly&mdash;and he was good to look upon: dark and
swarthy; shapely and tall; young and strong, with a fine, male beauty
in his shaven face, and a rare fire in his full, black eyes. But she
had been too well schooled by Messer Tito to lapse now from her lesson,
and fall into admiration of him. Besides, was he not a lowborn knave,
when all was said, and was not this devotion he professed for her an
insult? She had her brothers' word for it, and this beautiful, soulless
fool had no judgment that was not her brothers'.

<p>"I find that you are very well," she said, and he flushed with
pleasure. "And as for your want of duty&mdash;why, what is an hour?"

<p>His face clouded for a moment. She did not understand that an hour
filched from such a duty as was his might be a serious matter were it
known of.

<p>"What is an hour?" he echoed slowly, and then, his passion rising he
gave it tongue. "Ah, what is not an hour? What may it not be? The
sweetness of heaven, the bitterness of hell may all be crowded into an
hour. Were this hour all of my life that I should spend thus in your
beloved presence, then my life were but an hour&mdash;the rest but prologue
and epilogue to this one hour of living."

<p>"Oh, sir," she said, her lids drooping, and the long fringe of them
lying upon her perfect cheek; and again, "Oh, sir!"

<p>A fool you had vowed her, surely, had you witnessed her then and heard
the vacuous simper of her tones. But the captain&mdash;so blinding was his
distemper&mdash;was translated into ecstasy.

<p>"I am called Ferrante," he murmured. "Will you&mdash;will you not speak my
name, Cassandra?"

<p>She flashed him a glance, then drooped her lids again. "Ferrante!" she
murmured, and turned his brain to fire, for never had he dreamed that
his name contained such melodies. He put forth a trembling, faltering
hand to take one of her own, that was surrendered to him and lay
passive in his grasp.

<p>"Wilt give me this, sweet angel?" he implored her.

<p>"Give you what?" quoth she.

<p>"This hand&mdash;this little hand."

<p>"Why&mdash;to what purpose? Have you not two great able hands of your own?"

<p>"Delicious wit," cried the enraptured wight. "Be merciful, dear maid!"

<p>She laughed, that foolish treble laugh of hers, which rang in his
infatuated ears like a peal of silver bells, what time he feasted his
eyes upon the matchless beauty of her face. His breathing was shortened
by the excess of emotion that possessed him; a languor slowly crept
along his veins. And then she bade him sit beside her, and he obeyed
her, eagerly yet timidly&mdash;very foolishly, thought she.

<p>As he sat thus in the tepid eventide, in that fair-scented garden, he
came to think that heaven and the world had used him very well. He
was at peace with all men; he loved all men. And presently he spoke
of that, spoke of the change that loving her had wrought in his whole
life; how it altered the drift and current of it; how from harsh and
overbearing that he had been accounted, he would henceforth strive to
be meek and gentle, that he might be worthier of her gentle self&mdash;in
all of which he employed the very choice and flowery eloquence that
comes to some men in the season of their inamoration, but which she
found wearisome and very foolish.

<p>This, however, she dissembled. She listened demurely, as becomes a
maid, and occasionally gave such answers as she had been tutored in,
false words suggesting her reciprocation of his passion.

<p>Thus the hour that he had said might hold his lifetime sped swiftly for
him in his delicious intoxication, slowly for her to whom each minute
brought an increasing weariness. The shadows deepened about them; the
purple afterglow was fading from the sky; the trees and shrubs became
dark blurs against a gloomy background; the windows of the house behind
him sprang into light, and from the lake came the harsh croaking of a
frog.

<p>He rose, alarmed, mindful of his mission, and sought to shake his sweet
entrancement from him.

<p>"You are not leaving me?" she sighed.

<p>"Alas, madonna, that must I, though grieving!"

<p>"It is but a moment since you came," she protested, and ravished him by
the innocence that could utter such words of open wooing. He had won a
pearl among maidens for his own.

<p>He took her hand, and stayed to speak again of love; then spoke again
of going. But her little fingers had coiled themselves about his own.
In the gloom he saw the pale shimmer of her upturned face; her voice
came up to him on the scented summer air. He bent over her as he
answered: "Listen, beloved. Tonight I ride to Imola with messages of
state. But on my return I shall seek your brothers, to beg of them this
treasure in their keeping."

<p>She sighed. "When will you return?" she asked.

<p>"In three days' time, if all goes well. An age, sweet lady. But oh, the
reward that my patience shall receive!"

<p>She broke in quickly: "You shall not go without a stirrup-cup; you
shall not leave until you have pledged me. Come!" And she drew him, no
longer resisting, to the house.

<p>Through glass doors opening from the terrace she led him into a
spacious, handsome chamber, and there in the light shed from the golden
candle-branch he stood and his eyes devoured the glorious beauty of her.

<p>She beat her hands together and a page appeared, whom she bade bring
wine.

<p>And what time they waited they stood before each other, and a something
of pity took her in that moment. She was a woman after all, and the
call of his splendid manhood could not go unheeded. It may well be
that had he left her to herself she had now lacked the courage for
her treacherous task. But in that moment his passion, so long held in
check, welled up in a great tide that swept him to his ruin.

<p>He caught her slight, frail body in his arms. Crushing her to him, he
fiercely sought her lips. She battled to resist him, and for a second
he had sight of her white face; and what he saw there checked him. It
was a look of fear and loathing blent. He let her go, and fell back,
foolish, awkward and ashamed. And then&mdash;for Ferrante was shrewder than
most men&mdash;it came to him that this aversion to his clasp was odd in an
innocent who had so lately offered him such liberal encouragement.

<p>Even as the thought disturbed him the page entered, bearing on a golden
salver a jug of beaten gold and two opalescent, thin-stemmed goblets of
Venetian make. She moved to meet the page, with a fluttering laugh. She
poured the wine.

<p>He watched her closely out of gloomy eyes, and noted the deathly pallor
of her face, the trembling of her hand. Was it still the effect of his
embrace, he wondered.

<p>She came to him prettily now, a goblet in each hand. He took the one
she offered him, and bowed as she pledged him, smiling, though still
pale.

<p>"God speed you on your journey," said she.

<p>"God hasten my return to you," he answered, and drank the half of the
contents of his cup.

<p>It was a potent wine, hot in the throat and quickening to the blood.

<p>Its effect upon him was very swift. Scarce had he drunk but that there
appeared to him less need for urgency in his departure. He considered
that his horse was safely tethered to the ring outside the gate. A
few moments more would matter little; he would make them good upon
the road; and the present was very sweet. A mood of happy optimism
enwrapped him as a cloak. He sank languidly to a chair. Indeed, with
each breath he took his languor grew. It was the summer air, he
thought; the day had been excessively hot.

<p>"You are faint," she cried, and there was a gentle concern in her tone
very sweet to hear, seeming to assure him that he was forgiven his
momentary amorous violence.

<p>He laughed foolishly, inebriately almost. "Why... yes..." he gasped.

<p>"Drink," she bade him. "The wine will revive you."

<p>Mechanically he obeyed her, emptying his cup at a draught. Again that
sense of heat in the throat, that sense of fire in all his veins. He
strove to rise, suddenly, subconsciously alarmed. His knees failed him
and he sank back gasping. The room swam; a red mist was rolling and
billowing before his eyes; and then, through that mist, shining as
shines the moon, clear and distinct, he beheld the face of Cassandra
de' Genelleschi&mdash;no longer the sweet, innocent, childish face he loved,
but a face that looked at once foolish and wicked, a face detestable.
It was as if in that moment of physical obfuscation the eyes of his
soul were opened. Alarmed, he strove to concentrate all his powers
to cast off the torpor that possessed him. For just one moment he
succeeded, and in that moment he understood. He rose heavily from his
chair, his eyes blazing, his livid, glistening face terrific to behold.

<p>"Traitress!" he cried, and had God given him strength a moment longer
he would have killed her with his hands, such was the awful revulsion
that possessed him, making her beauty the most loathsome thing in all
the world.

<p>But ere he could move another step his knees were loosened again and
he sank back into the chair from which he had risen. The priceless
Venetian goblet slipped from his fingers and was shivered on the
tesselated floor. Black night descended upon his brain; his senses left
him, and his head fell forward on his breast.

<p>Cassandra stood staring down at him a moment, in horror and in fear.
He looked as he were dead. Then she turned, and as she did so the door
opened and her brothers entered. She would have stayed&mdash;inquisitive as
a child&mdash;to see them at their work. But her part in that black business
was concluded, and they drove her to bed ere they set about what more
there was to do.

<p>Tito drew the heavy curtains across the windows, whilst Girolamo made
swift search in the sleeper's clothes. He drew forth a package sealed
with the Borgia steer. It was the letter Tito had seen that day. With
a dagger heated in a flame he raised the seal unbroken, and together
by the candle-branch&mdash;Tito peering over Girolamo's shoulder&mdash;they made
themselves masters of the contents. Then Girolamo fetched ink and
quill&mdash;he was the swifter penman of the two&mdash;and sat down to make a
copy of that document.

<p>This letter bade Ramiro de Lorqua march with his two thousand men upon
Tigliano on the morrow, reduce and occupy it before attempting the
attack upon San Ciascano itself. For that he was to await Cesare's
further orders, meanwhile setting up a blockade.

<p>"This," said Tito, showing his fine teeth, "will be in the hands of
the men of San Ciascano long before Messer Ferrante shall have reached
de Lorqua at Imola. How Caserta will welcome the information! You must
carry it yourself, Girolamo."

<p>Girolamo was cunningly replacing the seal. "Caserta should pay us a
fine price for it."

<p>They laughed together. "A great night's work!" said Tito. "We have
destroyed that upstart fool there, and we shall deal the Duke of
Valentinois a blow that will stagger him."

<p>Girolamo thrust the package back into the breast of Ferrante's doublet.

<p>"What of this carrion?" quoth he.

<p>"Leave me to deal with it," said Tito. "I'll carry it to a wine-shop in
the borgo. When he wakes his adventure at the Palazzo Genelleschi will
seem a dream to him. Besides, he'll be in haste to redeem the time he
has lost, and he'll ride like the wind for Imola. He may be stirring
again before dawn."

<p>"Start enough for me," said Girolamo, and took the letter. "There will
be a surprise in store for Messer Ramiro de Lorqua when he marches
upon Tigliano. If Caserta knows anything of the art of war he should
annihilate the Borgia captain."

<p>On that they parted, Girolamo to ride to San Ciascano and Tito to
dispose of Ferrante against his waking.

<p>By the following evening Girolamo was back again, stiff from riding,
haggard and covered with dust. But he was in high spirits. The affair
had sped well. Caserta's gratitude for the warning had been profound;
he had set about taking his measures; the credit of the Genelleschi
with Bologna should be enhanced, and their zeal rewarded. As he was
returning, and after he had crossed the River Po, Girolamo had met
Ferrante, riding as if the devil were behind him, on his way to Imola.
From a screen of trees by the roadside he had watched the belated
messenger's furious passage.

<p>And now the Genelleschi, well content, sat down and waited for news of
the rout of the Borgia forces under de Lorqua&mdash;the news that should
prove Ferrante da Isola a traitor who had sold his duke, and vindicate
Tito de' Genelleschi's character. Cesare Borgia should bitterly repent
him for having given that gentleman the lie.

<p>It was on the morrow that news began to penetrate to Lojano of a bloody
battle in the territory of San Ciascano; and with it came a summons to
Tito de' Genelleschi to wait upon the Duke of Valentinois. He went with
a grave countenance and a mocking heart.

<p>"You will have heard the news?" was Cesare's questioning greeting. The
Duke had been writing busily when Tito was ushered into his presence.

<p>"I have heard a rumour of a battle, Highness," said Tito, and he found
it in his heart to admire the Duke as he had never yet admired him. His
calm was indeed magnificent. Part of his army routed, his most trusted
follower proved a traitor, yet there he sat, his countenance smooth and
inscrutable, his tone level and impassive as ever.

<p>"That letter that Ferrante bore," said Cesare, "bade de Lorqua march
upon Tigliano and invest it. But it seems that the folk of San Ciascano
had news of its contents, for Caserta lay in ambush at Tigliano
awaiting the attack."

<p>Tito's heart leapt within him. With difficulty did he keep the joy he
experienced from showing in his countenance. "You would not be advised,
Highness!" he cried. "You would have faith in this rogue Ferrante in
spite of my warnings."

<p>Cesare smiled quietly into the other's face. "Was I not well advised?"
he asked.

<p>"Well... well advised? Well advised! But&mdash;"

<p>"Ay&mdash;well advised. Had it fallen out otherwise than this, Ferrante had
indeed been proved a traitor."

<p>"Otherwise?" faltered Messer Tito, who understood nothing now.

<p>"It seems you have not heard the end of the story," said Cesare.
"Whilst Caserta and his forces waited at Tigliano for de Lorqua, the
latter crossed the river some miles to westward, and marching upon
soldierless and undefended San Ciascano, made himself master of it with
scarcely a blow struck. Caserta, seeing his rear threatened, and the
state lost to him, is, I am informed, in full flight."

<p>With eyes that laughed in mingled scorn and amusement, the Duke
considered white-faced, uncomprehending Genelleschi for some moments.

<p>"You see, sir," he explained at last, "Ferrante bore two letters; the
contents of the one were intended for Caserta to lure him thus to his
ruin with false information; the contents of the other&mdash;which Ferrante
bore in his boot, where you did not think of looking&mdash;were for de
Lorqua alone. As I bade him, so did he act, and proved his loyalty.
I did not choose that you should know the full extent of the test to
which I submitted him, and in which you helped him to succeed. For
when, in obedience with my orders, Ferrante went to offer to sell the
false dispatch to San Ciascano, he was driven out as an impostor by
Caserta, who had already bought their contents from your brother."
Cesare laughed grimly. "But for the circumstance that Caserta is fled,
I think I should send you to him that he might recompense you fittingly
for the false information you conveyed to him."

<p>A great terror took Genelleschi then, and with it&mdash;odd assortment&mdash;a
fierce anger. He had been an unwitting tool&mdash;he and his&mdash;in the
Borgia's cunning hands. But terror beat his anger down, and very soon
he came to his knees before the pitiless Duke&mdash;the Duke whose justice
was so swift, and terrible; the Duke who never erred on mercy's side.

<p>"Mercy!" he begged, in broken accents.

<p>But Cesare laughed again and waved his hand contemptuously. "I am well
content," said he. "I may break camp at once and resume my march,
thanks to you, who have helped me solve the riddle that delayed me. I
will consider also and set against your evil intentions that you have
rendered a good service to my friend Ferrante da Isola, in curing him
of his lovesickness. A man so afflicted makes an indifferent soldier."

<p>Still paralysed with terror&mdash;a terror that increased under the
utterances of that mocking voice, under the contempt of those beautiful
eyes&mdash;Tito still kept his knees, with hands upheld. The sight began
to weary Cesare; then disgusted him. He rose abruptly. His glance
hardened; his tone changed, and, from softly mocking, it grew of a
sudden harsh.

<p>"Out of my sight, toad," he bade that proud gentleman of Lojano. "Get
you gone, and never show your face&mdash;your own, your brother's or your
sister's&mdash;in my dominions again. Go!"

<p>And Genelleschi went, and counted himself fortunate.

<hr><h2><a name="ch3"></a>3. FERRANTE'S JEST</h2>

<p>THE career of Ferrante da Isola&mdash;or, to be particular, the sudden
cessation of all record of it&mdash;is a matter that must have intrigued
many a student of history. In a blaze of military glory he comes into
its pages; flashes across them like a meteor, leaving a trail of fiery
deeds in his wake; and is gone into an extinction as utter as it is
abrupt.

<p>The tale of that passing, and of the jest that led to it, is the tale I
have set myself to tell. It was early foretold this Ferrante that his
jesting would undo him, for he was overfond of the practice, and for
all that he loved the merry tales of Messer Giovanni Boccacci he seems
to have taken their lessons little to heart, else he might have heeded
the admonition of Pampinea, to guard against making jest of others. And
it happened, too, that this humour of his was of a warped and bitter
kind, so that his own laughter, as often as not, was purchased by the
grief and tribulation of others.

<p>It had been so from the commencement of men's recollection of him, but
since he had himself suffered so sorely at the hands of Cassandra de
Genelleschi that cruel quality of his humour had undergone increase.

<p>Now Ferrante's condotta formed pan of that division of the army of
Cesare Borgia that descended the Valley of Cecina to go against
Piombino. But he was not destined to take part in that siege, for
the Duke, it seemed, had other work for his very capable hands. At
Castelnuovo&mdash;on the night the army encamped there&mdash;Cesare Borgia
summoned him to his tent. He found the Duke in a furred gown, seated
upon his campbed, studying a map; and before he had completed his bow,
Cesare had abruptly come to the business upon which he had summoned him.

<p>"You are acquainted with the country hereabouts?" he asked sharply.

<p>Ferrante had some knowledge of it, and being a Sicilian, and not one to
belittle his attainments, he answered promptly: "As with the palm of my
own hand, Magnificent."

<p>The Magnificent slightly raised his brows, and slightly smiled.
"Nevertheless, you may find this helpful," said he, and held out
the map, which Ferrante obediently took. Then came the Duke's next
question: "What force do you judge would suffice for the taking of
Reggio di Monte?"

<p>Now Ferrante had enjoyed for some time the confidence of the Duke, and
had been a member of his councils; but never yet had he been honoured
to the extent of having his opinion thus privately sought by Cesare.
His pride in himself awoke; he grew suddenly in importance in his own
eyes, as he drew himself up, knit his brows, and thoughtfully stroked
his shaven chin, considering.

<p>"It would largely depend upon the time at that force's disposal," he
replied, to avoid committing himself.

<p>Cesare made an impatient gesture. "Do I not know that?" he said. "Let
us assume that there is haste, and that an army cannot be spared for a
siege. What force could master the place?"

<p>The problem was a tough one; and Ferrante waxed uneasy, lest, by
failing satisfactorily to solve it, his opinions should lose the vast
esteem in which it would seem that they were held by the Duke.

<p>"Why, as to that, now," said he reflectively, "Reggio di Monte is
no such easy place to capture. It is pitched on a hill-top, like an
eagle's nest, and boasts of its impregnability to assault." He paused a
moment. "Force will not crack that nut as soon as strategy."

<p>Cesare Borgia nodded. "That," said he, "is why I sent for you."

<p>Ferrante was flattered; yet not unduly. It was as a strategist that
he had won distinction; his military imagination was far above the
common even of great soldiers; his talent for scheming and devising,
and his audacity in executing, had been duly recognised and were widely
admired&mdash;though by none more ardently than by himself.

<p>"I propose," said Cesare, "to give you charge of the affair when I know
what men you will require."

<p>Ferrante's heart was quickened in its beating. To conduct a campaign;
to lead not a mere condotta, but an army&mdash;here, indeed, was a great
stride in his promotion. In imagination he beheld himself already
a lieutenant-governor. But he broke into no thanks or protestation
of devotion as another might have done; he bowed soberly, as one
acknowledging a charge, taking the matter calmly as his due.

<p>"I shall require&mdash;" (he paused, considering) "two thousand men."

<p>"You shall have a thousand," said Cesare quietly. "That is all the
force that I can spare. Will you undertake it with that?

<p>"Since you can spare no more, that must suffice," said Ferrante, with a
fine show of confidence in his own powers to achieve the impossible.

<p>"Very well," said the Duke. "You will take your own condotta of horse;
Ramires shall lead it for you; della Volpe shall command your foot, and
Fabio Orsini shall act as your lieutenant. Are you content with these
officers?"

<p>Content with them! Two&mdash;Diego Ramires and Taddeo della Volpe&mdash;were
among the most famous condottieri in Cesare's train. And they were to
serve under him! His fortunes soared on giant pinions. Had he imagined
himself a lieutenant-governor? He had been too modest; he perceived
this now, and saw himself already Governor-General of the Romagna. Yet
he contained his satisfaction, contenting himself with bowing soberly.

<p>"I shall require some artillery," said he.

<p>"I have none for you&mdash;not indeed enough for my own needs against
Piombino," was the answer.

<p>Ferrante was disappointed. What was an army without artillery? He posed
some such question to the Duke. "If you could spare me were it no more
than four guns," he sighed in conclusion.

<p>"Four guns? Why, what shall you do with four guns?" quoth Cesare. "To
grant you them would be to weaken myself without strengthening you."

<p>"They might serve me well for display," said Ferrante, giving the first
reason he could think of&mdash;a reason that was to recur to him later, and
afford him the very kernel of the scheme he was to develop. At the
moment, however, all that he thought of it was that the explanation was
a paltry and unworthy one.

<p>Not so, it seemed, thought Cesare, for his glance quickened as it
rested upon Ferrante, as though the condottiero's words had awakened
in the Duke's mind some notion of the means by which the task he was
imposing might be carried through.

<p>"Be it so, then," he said. "You shall have the guns. All will be ready
for you by sunrise. You will set out then."

<p>Ferrante bowed and departed, well content. But outside, under the
stars of that summer night, his satisfaction and self-complacency met
a check. How&mdash;how was the thing to be accomplished? It had been easy
to speak confidently of doing it with a thousand men, and to look
confident; it would have been the same had the Duke suggested that he
should do it with a hundred&mdash;and just as easy, he grimly reflected now.
Here was a great chance of distinction, true; but there was a still
greater chance of disaster. He felt now that the task of capturing
Reggio di Monte with a thousand men was one he would like to allot to
his worst enemy&mdash;and on that he went to bed, hoping for the counsel
that sleep is said to bring.

<p>He awoke despondent; but his spirits rose when he came forth from his
tent to find his army all drawn up awaiting him. It was in his eyes a
very noble sight, and never did lover look with greater ardour upon his
mistress than did Ferrante upon those men-at-arms.

<p>There was his own condotta&mdash;a phalanx of steel-clad horsemen&mdash;rearing
skywards a forest of four hundred lances, and here the close-packed
ranks of sturdy Romagnuoli foot; yonder the baggage-carts and the
ordinance mounted upon carriages drawn by bullocks; and above was the
morning sun shining upon all and striking fire from morion, corselet
and lance-head.

<p>Through the bustle of the camp from which they were departing came
Ferrante's officers to greet their leader; first the Spaniard Ramires,
tall and handsome, leading his charger, bridle over arm; after him
rolled the sturdy Taddeo della Volpe&mdash;that valiant one-eyed veteran,
who had left his other eye at Forli and had boasted that he was glad
of it since it enabled him to see but the half of danger; lastly came
the youthful Fabio Orsini, a very pretty fellow in variegated hose, who
dissembled his valour under a cloak of foppishness. If they entertained
any jealousy of Ferrante's promotion, they dissembled it, and very
friendly were they as they stood there to receive his orders.

<p>These he issued briskly; and presently the horse, with Ramires at its
head, began to move. After it, della Volpe defiled his foot; and lastly
came the guns and baggage-carts. Ferrante rode some little way in the
rear, accompanied by Orsini and followed by two mounted esquires.

<p>In this order they went back by the road that but yesterday they had
travelled, and climbed the first hill of that rugged country. From the
crest of it, Ferrante looked back upon the main body of the army which
was on the point of resuming its westward march. Then he rode down the
incline, and turned his thoughts once more to the business to which he
stood committed.

<p>Anon, letting the reins lie on the neck of his ambling charger, he
drew forth the map that Cesare had given him, and pored over it as if
to gather inspiration from its tracings. One matter this study did
determine&mdash;how Reggio di Monte should be approached. Not by the highway
running up the valley along the river, whence their coming might be
witnessed and their strength&mdash;or, rather, their weakness&mdash;observed by
the men of Reggio on the heights. Rather must they approach it under
cover, and to this end Ferrante ordered the troops&mdash;after the noontide
rest&mdash;to strike away to the south and the hills. As a consequence they
rested at nightfall on the slopes of Monte Quarto, with that stout hill
as a screen between themselves and the eyes of Reggio.

<p>There they pitched the tents of the officers, and there the men
bivouacked under the summer sky. Ferrante ascended the hill alone that
night, and from the summit he looked across the narrow gap of valley
at the lights of Reggio on the hill-top opposite, a bowshot away. That
was his first view of the town. He had come and he had seen; but to the
conquering he perceived no way just yet. Would a way be opened to him?
He sat down to think, and so near did the lights of Reggio seem that he
entertained the perfectly idle reflection that a bridge thrown across
the gap would afford an easy solution of the riddle.

<p>Now this papal fief of Reggio di Monte, you are to know, had been
unlawfully sold by the late Pope, Innocent VIII, to Count Prospero
Guancia, and upon the latter's death had been inherited by his brother
Girolamo, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Apollonia, who now held it, in
open rebellion against the authority of the Holy See. For whilst the
Cardinal-Count as cleric must, and did, acknowledge the sovereignty of
Pope Alexander VI, as tyrant he refused&mdash;so far as Reggio di Monte was
concerned&mdash;to recognise in the latter his temporal overlord. He was
by no means blind to the danger of this insubordination; but he was a
crafty and far-seeing opportunist, employing well-paid spies at Rome to
keep him informed of his danger's precise degree.

<p>Hitherto, Cesare Borgia had been fully engaged beyond the Apennines,
in the conquest of the Romagna, with no time to turn aside to gather
so comparatively insignificant a fruit as Reggio di Monte. The
Cardinal-Count well knew that in the course of things his own turn
should come, and that he might be forced to yield his fief. But it was
also possible that chance might serve him; and he deemed it as well
to wait in his out-of-the-way corner of Tuscany until the enemy was
at his gates. He had known a spasm of fear when word was brought him
that the Pope's son was in Tuscany, marching upon Piombino, and he
wondered uneasily whether Cesare would turn aside to dislodge him from
his stronghold. But he did not consider the peril imminent, knowing as
he did that Cesare was in haste, that he was awaited in Rome, and that
he was to join the French in the Neapolitan campaign. That Neapolitan
campaign was a sweet subject of reflection to the Cardinal-Count. Much
might happen in the course of it, and a French defeat would mean such
loss of power to the Pope that it was unlikely Reggio or any other
Northern tyranny would be further disturbed by Borgia ambition. So
overwhelmingly clear was this to the Cardinal-Count, so firmly did he
found his hopes upon it, that he was resolved to withstand any but
an overwhelming attack that might be made upon him in the meantime.
To this end he had made due preparation. He was well victualled to
resist a siege, and, if poorly garrisoned, he could rely upon the
natural strength of Reggio, the stoutness of its walls and its almost
inaccessible position on its craggy heights.

<p>The game he was disposed to play was a very plain and obvious one, and
it was obvious to Messer Ferrante, who was considering it as he sat
there on the hill-top and looked across the valley at his prey. Not
to such a detachment as Ferrante commanded would the Lord of Reggio
surrender, and Ferrante could imagine the laugh of scorn with which his
lordship would greet the appearance of the full force that had been
sent against him. Therefore, it followed logically in Ferrante's mind
that, if the Cardinal-Count was to see the force at all, he must be
kept in ignorance of its weakness, be led to suppose it greater than it
was&mdash;that a prompt surrender might be inspired.

<p>So far&mdash;and strictly in theory&mdash;all was easy. In practice even this
easy beginning seemed none too possible; and, if it were, what was to
follow after? He sat there far into the night, devising impracticable
stratagems, and weaving romantically impossible plans.

<p>"If my men had wings now, or every horse of my condotta were a
Pegasus," he said aloud, and checked there, realising that this sort of
speculation was unprofitable and could lead him nowhere. Yet it was a
very perfect type of such plans as flitted through his mind.

<p>In the end he became angry. It was immensely flattering of the Duke to
show such confidence in him by sending him with so entirely inadequate
a force; but he now found it in his heart to wish that he had been
given less confidence and more men.

<p>He sat on, resolved to await the coming of day, that he might take a
survey of the ground before he went to rest. And presently the early
summer dawn crept over the silent land, pale and colourless as a
moonstone at first, then quickening to the iridescence of the opal, and
lastly flaming into a glory of gold and purple in the east, behind the
stark black mass of mountains that were Italy's backbone.

<p>Ferrante surveyed the valley in the clear morning light. Below him was
a farmstead with pasture-land and arable, beyond it a vineyard, and
below this again an olive grove that ran down to the sparkling river
winding at the bottom. From the water wisps of mist were rising, like
steam from an overheated beast. Beyond it, to the south, a wedge of
woodland spread some little way along its course. Before him, on a
level with him, stood the red-brown mass of the city of Reggio, the
Maschio Tower of the citadel standing square and clear above the rusty
roofs. With the eye of the soldier he considered the stout walls and
their roofed battlements, saw how these sprang from grey rock that
was no whit less sheer, and observed how the rock in turn rose out of
meadow-land that became ever gentler in slope and richer in hue as it
descended to the emerald green of the valley by the river. He remarked
the grey road, wound spirally about it, like a rope, and commanded by
the city at every point of it, and he determined that that way lay no
hope of effecting an entrance by surprise.

<p>Undoubtedly the Duke had set him a choice task. He stood leaning
against a boulder, chin in hand, and very thoughtful. The sun's hot
face looked over the Apeninnes, and dispelled the last shadow from the
narrow valley at his feet. He watched the river tumbling and sparkling
in the morning light, watched the thin mist, rising more swiftly now.
The sight of that mist brought him an inspiration; at least, it showed
him what might be done if it were a fog, and indulging his dream he
conceived a very subtle, crafty plan, for which, however, a fog was
wholly essential. He came back to realities with an oath. There was
no fog, and, since it was not in the power of man to make fogs, what
purpose could it serve to waste time considering what he might do with
one.

<p>He turned away in a mighty ill-humour, and went down the hill to his
camp, more out of conceit with himself than ever he had been in his
twenty-five years of life&mdash;which in Messer Ferrante, after all, was not
so bad as it might have been in another.

<p>To the sentry standing by his tent he gave an order. "There is a
farmstead over the hill. Let six men go there at once, secure every
member of the household and bring all prisoners to the camp here."

<p>It was a precautionary measure against word of their presence being
prematurely conveyed to Reggio. He entered his tent, flung off his
cloak, all sodden with dew, pulled off his long boots, and flung
himself on his couch, tired from his long vigil. Presently the flap was
lifted and Fabio Orsini came in.

<p>"Well returned," the lieutenant greeted Ferrante. "Where have you spent
the night?"

<p>"On Pisgah," answered Ferrante sleepily, "surveying the promised land."

<p>"At what hour do we march?"

<p>"'Tis what I most desire to know. By your leave, I'll seek counsel in
sleep."

<p>Orsini made shift to depart. At the entrance he looked back. "Have you
commands for me?" he asked.

<p>Ferrante's answer seemed an odd one. "Can you make fogs?" quoth he.

<p>"Fogs?" echoed Orsini.

<p>"Ay, fogs&mdash;dense fogs, white fogs, fat fogs."

<p>"Why, no," laughed Orsini.

<p>"Then," said Ferrante, "I have no commands for you." And he turned over
to go to sleep.

<p>When he awakened he found his three officers assembled in his tent.

<p>"It is noon, Sir Captain," said Ramires.

<p>"Did I make it so?" grumbled Ferrante peevishly. "What now?"

<p>"We have come for your orders."

<p>"Then I'll order breakfast," said Ferrante, and sat up rubbing the
sleep from his eyes.

<p>"We refer to marching orders," della Volpe explained, rolling his one
eye fiercely.

<p>Ferrante drove his fingers through his rumpled hair and flung his
jaws wide in a yawn. "Whither do you march?" he inquired, when he had
recovered.

<p>"Whither?" they cried in chorus, and looked at one another. Ferrante
began to find them entertaining; also his opinion of them as soldiers
sank considerably. They were mere fighters, stout fighters, but no
more. "Let us take counsel," he said. He rose, went to the entrance,
and bawled for one of his esquires, calling for meat and drink.

<p>"I spent the night up yonder," he informed them, "considering the
matter of our attack, and surveying the land. I discovered one
important thing, sirs." He paused.

<p>"Yes, yes?" they cried.

<p>"That this is no easy business," he informed them easily.

<p>"Thus much we knew," roared della Volpe.

<p>"Ah, you knew? Good! That is where your intelligence surpasses mine."

<p>The single eye of the grizzled captain of foot fixed itself sternly
upon Ferrante.

<p>"The question is," said Ramires slowly, "when are you going to attack?"

<p>"I crave your pardon," said Ferrante, "but that is not the question at
all. The question is&mdash;how are we going to attack?"

<p>His esquires entered, bearing bread and meat, fruit, and eggs beaten in
wine. Ferrante took the things, spread them beside him on the camp bed,
and began to eat.

<p>"What do you counsel?" he inquired, his mouth full.

<p>The question seemed to perturb them, suggesting considerations hitherto
ignored.

<p>"Why," said Ramires, "here's a deal of bother about seizing a thieves'
nest."

<p>"There is likely to be a deal more before it's seized," said Ferrante,
and quaffed his mess of eggs and wine with relish. Yet their stupidity,
their failure to see his difficulties even when he suggested them,
began to put him out of patience.

<p>"I am all for the direct attack," said della Volpe, with the fighter's
scorn of the schemer.

<p>"It should be dear to you," said Ferrante. "It has cost you an eye
already."

<p>The remaining eye glowered fiercely out of that scarred face. "My eye
was my own to lose."

<p>"As is your temper&mdash;though you were wiser to retain it, Ser Taddeo."

<p>"And I thank God I lost my eye," went on the condottiero, "since, had I
two, I might see as much danger as do you."

<p>"I think," said Ferrante, "that you have made that jest before."

<p>"Sirs, sirs!" cried Ramires, intervening. "We are concerned at present
with the attack on Reggio."

<p>"For myself, and to be frank," said Ferrante, "I am more concerned with
breakfast. But let that be. I can listen as I eat. Expound me your
plans." And he sank his teeth into the succulent fibres of a peach.

<p>Ramires braced himself to the task, and with the occasional
interpolations from della Volpe he propounded strategies that were old
in the days of Cyrus, but none of which would have led that same Cyrus
into Babylon, nor was likely to lead them into Reggio. Orsini stood
listening, but venturing no opinion. Ferrante ate, drank, and heard
them as soberly as he might.

<p>"You assure me of one thing," said he, when they had done. "That you
have never seen this city of Reggio. Go up, and look at it, I beg."

<p>"What will take one place will take another," said della Volpe.

<p>"Always granting that that other is not Reggio," put in Ferrante. "Go
up; go up, and survey the town; and, ere you go, put off your armour,
lest it glitter. When you have seen, perhaps you will have help to
offer me."

<p>As they were departing, by no means in the best of moods, he stayed
them.

<p>"Can you make fogs, Messer Taddeo?" he asked.

<p>"Fogs?" quoth Taddeo, bewildered.

<p>"It is plain you cannot. Can you, Ramires?"

<p>"Is it a jest?" quoth the Spaniard, with a great dignity.

<p>"It is plain you cannot either. I have a plan for bringing the arrogant
Messer Guancia to his knees. But my plan requires a fog. Since you
cannot make me a fog, perhaps you'll go pray for me; and whilst you're
gone, I'll try to think of something better."

<p>They went out accounting him mad, and the Duke no better for having
given him charge of this expedition. They comforted one another by
vilifying him as they climbed the hill to get a view of Reggio.

<p>After sunset Ferrante's tent was once more invaded by his officers.
Taddeo had a plan, he claimed&mdash;a most original plan. Ferrante looked up
hopefully.

<p>"A night attack!" Taddeo announced, with pride.

<p>Ferrante sneered. Taddeo argued; let them set out in an hour; there
would be no moon; they could reach Reggio undetected and surprise its
gates.

<p>Ferrante's sneer grew broader. "An excellent plan, Messer Taddeo, but
for one thing which you have overlooked."

<p>"And what may that be?" challenged the truculent veteran.

<p>"That they are not all stone-deaf in Reggio, and therefore that a
thousand men winding about a hard mountain road would be heard before
they were half-way up. Then, Messer Taddeo, we shall have as pretty
a shower of rocks and boiling pitch to greet us as ever rained on a
parcel of fools."

<p>Taddeo was angry, and he had the support of Ramires, whilst Orsini&mdash;as
became his youth&mdash;stood neutral. It was all very well for Ferrante to
sneer at their suggestions; but what better could he offer?

<p>None, he admitted. "If only we had a fog, now&mdash;" he began; and at the
very mention of the word they flung out in a passion and left him.

<p>But despite the ease he affected in their presence his mind was
tortured by perplexity. He slept but ill that night, and he awoke at
peep of day. He rose, dressed, and went out into the clear, steely
light of dawn. Very slowly, and his wits very busy about this appalling
riddle that had been set him, he ascended the hill. He fostered a faint
hope that the renewed contemplation of Reggio might inspire him.

<p>The light grew rapidly as he went up, and by the time he had gained the
summit it was broad day. Arrived there he uttered a soft ejaculation,
and it was not across at Reggio, standing dark and sharply outlined
against the pale southern sky that he stared, but down into the narrow
valley at his feet. He stared and stared, misdoubting his senses,
fearing that he must be asleep in his tent and dreaming&mdash;dreaming of
the thing that so obsessed his mind. For half the valley was blotted
from his sight in the thick billows of a mist that hung there above the
now hidden river. It was the fog of his dreams. Then he roused himself.
Here was no time to be lost. Every moment was of value, for none might
say how soon that mist would rise.

<p>He turned and flung down the hill again like a madman. Like a madman
he burst upon the awakening camp, bawling for trumpets, and kicking
sleepers out of their dreams.

<p>"To horse! To horse!" he bellowed, and presently to his own were added
the brazen voices of half-a-dozen trumpets.

<p>His officers, half-dressed and unkempt, came hurrying for his orders.
He issued them sharp and briefly; the officers dashed off again to see
them executed. Soon all was a confusion of scurrying men and stamping
horses. Soon out of that confusion order began to resolve itself. The
foot was ready first and, as it formed up, Ferrante waited for no more.
He flung himself on to the charger one of his esquires had fetched
him, summoned trumpeters to his side, caught up the great red and gold
standard bearing the device of the bull, and shouted to the foot to
follow him.

<p>"Ramires, marshal the horse; but do not stir until my trumpets summon
you. Fabio, see to the guns. Taddeo, follow me. On, on!"

<p>At a run he led them up to the crest of Monte Quarto, his mounted
trumpeters busy all the while, rousing the countryside with their
brazen din, and bringing all Reggio to the walls in quick alarm. Over
the hill's crest he led those six hundred men, marching four abreast,
for the way was narrow; down he led them until himself and the foremost
ranks were plunged into the mist, and hidden.

<p>"Now run," he bade them&mdash;for their descent of the hill had been sedate
so far; and he led them&mdash;not down, but away to the right, and round the
flank of the hill until they rejoined the rear of the column near the
summit once more. There he stood aside, bidding them on; and Taddeo,
who grasped his meaning, went on with them, and over the crest and
down and round again in an unbroken chain. At last, when the whole
column had five times repeated the manoeuvre, and five times been round
and over the shoulder of Monte Quarto, Ferrante bade Taddeo halt and
marshal them there as they returned. Then he sent forward Orsini with
the guns and baggage-carts&mdash;the latter empty, for there had been no
time to break camp&mdash;and after these he followed again, with Ramires now
and the horse, his trumpeters more vociferous than ever.

<p>The manoeuvre of the foot was repeated with the horse, and after
these came again more foot, more guns and baggage-carts, and lastly
more horse. For upwards of an hour did the fearsome pageant which
Ferrante's cunning had devised to terrorise the defenders of Reggio
continue to parade before the scared eyes of the watchers on the walls.
For an hour and upwards did the Cardinal-Count himself observe those
vast forces pouring over the summit of Monte Quarto in a never-ending
torrent of steel-cased men and splendid horses, flashing and glittering
in the morning sun that shone upon the heights. Into the mist below
they passed&mdash;to ford the river, and cross the valley, thought the
Cardinal-Count&mdash;to be led round and back, in fact, over the shoulder of
the hill again, and down and round in never-ending legions.

<p>By the time the thinning mist warned Ferrante that he should make
an end, the Cardinal-Count computed that ten thousand men at least
composed the army that was come against him, and drew from this the
only possible conclusion&mdash;that the very thing he had deemed unlikely
had come to pass, and that Cesare Borgia had turned aside and come with
his entire army to compel Reggio to surrender.

<p>It was a sour draught for the Cardinal-Count; a force of a thousand,
of two thousand or even of five thousand, he would defiantly have
withstood, setting his faith in time. But with such an army as this
marching against his gates, the Tyrant of Reggio realised in bitterness
that the time was come for other measures. He must consider, and to
consider he withdrew, calling his council to attend him.

<p>His council was panic-stricken. With one voice its members urged him to
surrender&mdash;to make betimes a becoming show of humility, and save the
city from the fire and sword that must wait upon the defiance of such
a host as lay encamped below. For Ferrante had encamped, meanwhile,
in the valley; and in this matter he was effectively assisted by the
forest to pursue the comedy of his pageant.

<p>When the curtain of mist was rolled aside, Reggio had beheld on the
wood's edge no more than a matter of a thousand men. But there was such
constant coming and going, into and out of the forest, that it was
clear the Duke had bivouacked his countless legions under the shelter
of the trees, and that this matter of a thousand men or so was but an
overflow&mdash;a supposition confirmed by the fact that there were no horses
to be seen.

<p>The Cardinal-Count sat listening to the appeal of his counsellors&mdash;a
long, lean, majestic man, whose haughty countenance was livid now. He
gnawed his heavy lip awhile, considering; and presently there came an
usher to announce a herald from the Lord Cesare Borgia, Duke of Romagna
and Valentinois.

<p>The herald was admitted to the council-chamber&mdash;a very pretty fellow in
a surcoat of scarlet and gold with the pontifical arms embroidered upon
his breast, with stockings that were one red and the other yellow.

<p>He bowed profoundly to the assembled company, unnecessarily proclaimed
his office, and still more unnecessarily the many titles of the Duke of
Valentinois, in whose name he spoke. Thereafter he did his errand very
courteously, and it was a more courteous errand than the Cardinal-Count
had looked for. It summoned him to surrender. Just that, and no more.
It was backed by no threat of hideous alternatives, and in that lay the
most deadly threat of all. Cesare Borgia was so sure of Reggio that he
did not even deign to threaten.

<p>It was over. Nothing remained them but surrender. The Duke held them
in the hollow of his hand. He gave Messer Guancia until sunset to
determine. The Cardinal bowed his head.

<p>"Upon what conditions does his Highness bid me yield?" he asked, in a
dull voice.

<p>"He offers you safe-conduct for yourself and your garrison," said the
herald.

<p>A bitter smile crossed the lips of the rebellious prelate.

<p>"I thank his Highness for so much forbearance," said he. "I will take
counsel, and determine. My ambassadors shall wait upon him later."

<p>The herald bowed and took his leave.

<p>The Cardinal-Count sat on, in a brooding silence that none dared
disturb. He suffered horribly from the wound his pride had taken, and
he cast about him for a salve that should assuage the pain of it. And
then, suddenly, his counsellors, sitting mutely expectant, observed his
dark eyes to harden and glitter evilly.

<p>"Be it as you wish," he said, in a level voice. "Surrender shall be
made today. You have leave to go, sirs." And he motioned them away.

<p>Alone he sat there, clutching the arms of his chair, and smiling softly
and cruelly to himself. Reggio must fall. But Cesare Borgia and his
captains should not outlive their victory.

<p>He rose, and went to strike a gong; then bade a servant summon his
secretary, his seneschal and the captain of his garrison.

<p>In the plain below, by the wood's edge, some tents had been pitched,
Ferrante's amongst others, and in this sat Ferrante and his officers
that afternoon to receive the ambassadors of the Cardinal-Count. The
condottiero had gone far towards redeeming his character in the eyes
of his lieutenants by the morning's manoeuvres; yet Ramires, whilst
lavishing praise of its astuteness, still wanted to know what Ferrante
would have done had there been no fog, and Taddeo, whilst admitting and
similarly praising that shrewd piece of humbug, was sceptical of its
having the full effect that Ferrante looked for, and he wanted to know
what was to happen if Messer Guancia still resisted.

<p>Ferrante's good humour, however, was nothing damped. Things had sped so
miraculously well for him that he could not but believe that his luck
was flowing strongly; that he was right was proved presently when the
ambassadors arrived.

<p>They were three: Messer Annibale Guancia&mdash;generally reputed to be the
Cardinal-Count's nephew, though scandalmongers alleged the kinship to
be a nearer one&mdash;the captain of the garrison and the president of the
council.

<p>A crowd of men had surrounded them on their approach, and so hemmed
them about that they had feared for their very lives and had been in
no case to look round and take notice of the real extent of the Borgia
forces. Thus they were hustled into Ferrante's presence.

<p>Messer Annibale, the spokesman, looked from one to the other of the
occupants of the tent, and blinked. Ferrante was seated, with Taddeo
standing on one hand and Ramires on the other, both the lieutenants
being armed at all points. At a small table to one side and rather
behind them sat Fabio Orsini, quill in hand, a sheet of parchment
unrolled before him.

<p>"My errand," Annibale announced, "is to the Duke of Valentinois'
Excellency."

<p>"I am his Excellency's lieutenant, deputed by him to receive your
errand," answered Ferrante, very haughty. "His Excellency was expecting
the Cardinal-Count in person, and would have conferred with him had he
come. But to meet a deputy he sends a deputy. So say on, sir."

<p>Annibale hesitated a moment; but the point raised by Ferrante was a
just one, and being moreover impressed by the calm assurance of these
officers, he formally made offer of surrender in the lord of Reggio's
name, subject to safe-conduct being granted to Reggio's defenders, one
and all.

<p>"That is to say, you accept the offer made you by the Duke's Highness.
It is well." He turned to Orsini. "Set it down," he commanded. Then to
the ambassadors: "Is there aught else?" he asked.

<p>"A prayer, sir," said Annibale.

<p>"Prefer it."

<p>"My lord implores the Duke's Magnificence to spare the city occupation
by so vast an army, or indeed by more than just such troops as it may
be his good purpose to place in garrison. My lord having the well-being
of this poor city at heart, and fearing for its inhabitants dire
consequences of such an occupation..."

<p>"Enough!" broke in Ferrante. "So much I have power to grant. Set it
down, Fabio, that saving two hundred men of Messer della Volpe's foot,
who are to garrison the city, Reggio di Monte's hospitality shall not
be taxed by his Highness' troops." Then to the envoy, "That, sir, I
think, is all. It but remains to sign the articles of capitulation, and
for his Highness or his deputy to receive the oath of fealty of the
council."

<p>"The one and the other may be done in Reggio this night, and to that
end my lord dares hope that the Duke's Excellency and the officers in
his train will sup with him at the palace, when all may be amicably
concluded."

<p>Ferrante's eyebrows went up in some astonishment at the request, and
the envoy made haste to explain.

<p>"It is my lord's most earnest wish to make his peace with the Holy
Father and with the Duke; and he trusts that this his ready submission
will weigh with them, and that, in earnest of forgiveness for his
past resistance, his Magnificence will deign to accept my lord's
hospitality."

<p>Ferrante considered a moment. "The Duke's Highness desires to show no
harshness where he is not constrained to it," he answered deliberately.
"And, provided the citadel is in our hands by then, I can accept in his
name the invitation of the Cardinal-Count."

<p>The envoy bowed. "You may proceed to occupy the citadel at once," said
he. "The captain of the garrison is here to tell you so."

<p>On that and some valedictory compliments the interview came to an end,
and the ambassadors of Reggio were reconducted. An hour later Taddeo
della Volpe marched two hundred of his foot into Reggio, and took
possession of the citadel, whence he sent word to Ferrante that all had
run a smooth course and that the Cardinal-Count's garrison&mdash;and it was
a scant one&mdash;had disarmed.

<p>Towards sunset Ferrante, accompanied by Ramires and Orsini, and
escorted by a guard of honour of a hundred men-at-arms, rode into
Reggio to sign the articles, receive the oath of fealty, and sup with
the Cardinal-Count.

<p>Under the deep archway of the gate he was met by Taddeo, the veteran's
scarred face agrin now with satisfaction. He felt that he had his share
in this amazingly easy victory, and that he would have his place in
the brave tale that was to be told to Cesare Borgia. He came attended
by a score of pikemen, and with these he now joined Ferrante's party.
Together they proceeded towards the palace through streets that were
lined with silent, timid, anxious townsfolk.

<p>On the steps of the cloistered staircase that ascended from the vast
courtyard of the old palace they found the majestic scarlet figure of
the Cardinal-Count awaiting them. The fierce eagerness in his eyes was
changed to disappointment when he learned that Cesare Borgia was not
with them. It was Ferrante who explained his master's absence.

<p>Now Ferrante loved a jest so well that he was ever loth to keep one to
himself. Indeed he found that the revelation of it to the person who
had been the unconscious victim added an epilogue almost as humorous as
the jest itself. The element of cruelty that was inherent in the man
took pleasure in gloating over discomfiture and the humiliation of the
arrogant, and he desired to see it savoured to the bitter full.

<p>So now he must stand there, very debonair and smiling, and inform the
Cardinal-Count, with the pleasantest manner in the world, not only that
the Duke was absent, not only that he had never been present, but,
further, the precise manner in which, by the help of the morning's
mist, he had befooled the Cardinal-Count into surrendering an
impregnable city to a mere detachment of a thousand men.

<p>And he related it all with the gay and easy manner of one who expects
his listener to laugh with him.

<p>But no responsive laughter was there from the Cardinal-Count. Whiter
and yet whiter grew his face as he realised the trick by which he had
been cozened into opening his gates. Sterner and sterner grew his
glance as he appraised that tall, graceful figure in pearl-grey silk
with here and there a touch of violet to match the sweeping plumes in
his grey hat, and in a voice harsh and quivering with rage he desired
to be informed what gentlemen he was to have the honour of welcoming to
his table.

<p>"I am Ferrante da Isola," said the condottiero, with conscious pride,
and on that he presented one by one his three companions.

<p>Messer Guancia smiled now; but his smile was not nice to see. "It
remains for me," he said, "to pay with the best grace I can command."

<p>"Why here," cried Ferrante gaily, "is the spirit in which I love to see
a jest accepted."

<p>But his officers felt chilled under the lord of Reggio's glance as he
bade them welcome.

<p>So great was the rage within the prelate, so overmastering his desire
to be avenged upon these men who put this trick upon him, and upon
this glib fellow who laughed of it to his face, that he forgot his
disappointment at the absence of the Duke. He turned, with Ferrante at
his side, and led the way up that grey staircase of carved stone and
into the palace.

<p>He had said that it remained for him to pay with the best grace he
could command, and Ferrante had cried gaily that here was such a spirit
as he loved. Well, well! He should love that spirit less when he knew
more of it&mdash;when he discovered precisely what payment was intended. So
ran the prelate's thoughts. They steadied him, and comforted him for
the loss he had sustained.

<p>With great deference and ceremony were Ferrante and his lieutenants
led to table, and to keep them company and do them fitting honour
there were a score or so of gentlemen and officers of Messer Guancia's
following. Ferrante looked about him, and smiled. He knew no fear.
Under his court finery he wore a mesh of steel, as did his comrades,
and in the yard below his hundred men and Taddeo's twenty were under
arms and within call.

<p>They got to the superbly appointed table. At its head sat the
Cardinal-Count, enthroned in a great gilded chair that was slightly
raised above the level of the others. The rest disposed themselves with
a careless disregard of precedence that Ferrante looked upon as odd.
He found himself midway down the board&mdash;instead of on the Cardinal's
right hand as was his due as the honoured guest, the representative
of the Duke of Valentinois. Their host, he saw, was hemmed about by
men of his own household, and none of the Borgia officers was within
six men of him. Again he observed that he and his comrades had been
effectively separated, so that on either hand of each were at least
two of the gentlemen of Reggio. On his own left hand he had Messer
Annibale&mdash;that nephew of the Cardinal-Count who had earlier come to him
as an ambassador; on his right was a gentleman of lesser eminence.

<p>Suspicion awoke then in the bosom of Messer Ferrante. Here all was not
as it should be. What if he had walked into a trap? What if the prelate
proposed to murder them, and then ring the bells and lead forth what
force he could muster against a little army without officers? He and
his fellows wore their swords, it was true, whilst the vanquished came
ostentatiously without weapons. But in their robes they might have
daggers hidden, and they were twenty men opposed to four. It had ever
been a maxim of Ferrante's that who despises an enemy reinforces him;
and he wondered, with an angry misgiving, could he have been guilty
here of that dangerous error. He wondered, too, upon what pretext
he might bring in a party of his guards. That pretext he had soon
enough&mdash;of his own making. It was not for nothing that he was accounted
the very prince of strategists.

<p>He had been engaging his left-hand neighbour, Messer Annibale, in a
trivial conversation, when a lackey approached to serve him, bearing
a great silver platter of brodetto of fish. In turning&mdash;as if by
chance&mdash;Ferrante drove his elbow sharply into the fellow's side. Over
went the platter of brodetto, and full half its contents were strewn
upon the condottiero's delicate pearl-grey silk. Ferrante came to his
feet in a magnificently simulated passion, and caught the lackey a blow
that sent him hurtling against the tapestried wall of the apartment.

<p>"By the Passion!" he roared. "Are you no better served than this in
Reggio?"

<p>From the head of the table came the prelate's voice, apologetic and
conciliatory; Messer Annibale, too, had risen, and was seeking to
pacify the infuriated captain. His own companions&mdash;Taddeo, Ramires
and Orsini&mdash;sought also to calm him and to recall him to some sense
of good behaviour. But Ferrante waved all wrathfully aside, pushed
back his chair, and strode doorwards, a mess of fish and savoury
ingredients dripping from his ruined finery as he went. He tore aside
the door-curtain with an angry hand, and in an angry voice he shouted
for the men of Taddeo's foot.

<p>The entire company had risen now, the Cardinal-Count among the rest,
dismay and vexation overspreading his white face. "What would you do,
my lord?" he asked. "This man has done no more than&mdash;"

<p>"I have no concern with him." Ferrante broke in rudely, facing the
table again, and towering there, the very incarnation of wrath. "But if
I am to sup with your Magnificence I'll not be served by swineherds and
bathed in fish-stews. I'll have my soldiers to wait upon me and teach
your lackeys their trade."

<p>A dull flush was tinting the Cardinal-Count's cheekbones. "It shall be
as you will, Most Excellent," said he.

<p>"I mean it so to be," said Ferrante, snorting, and he turned to his
men&mdash;a score of them&mdash;who thronged the threshold. "Lay aside your
pikes," he commanded, "and attend us here at table. So, my lord of
Reggio, you shall see what service means." And he came back to his
place at the board.

<p>His comrades began to understand, and so, too, did the
Cardinal-Count&mdash;gathering understanding from the number Ferrante had
bidden to attend them. He smiled a trifle scornfully. "You gentlemen of
Rome have much to teach us," said he, by way of restoring good humour
in their ranks, and Ferrante laughed, and this object being achieved,
made haste to remove the constraint which his burst of anger had left
upon the company. He had partly succeeded when the wine was brought.
From the hands of the seneschal one of his men received a great jug of
beaten gold on which was choicely figured the story of Bacchus and the
Nymphs of Nysa.

<p>With a clumsiness that made a mock of Ferrante's boast, the
half-armoured man-at-arms clattered to the Cardinal-Count with his
great jug. He was about to pour, when the prelate stayed him, covering
his goblet with his hand.

<p>"First to my guests," said he, with a courtly smile; and
good-humouredly he twitted Ferrante on the manners of his Ganymede.
Ferrante took it in excellent part. Indeed, it was his design, now that
he had gained his ends, to promote good feeling, or, at least, the
outward seeming of it.

<p>His own glass was filled and those of his three lieutenants, and upon
that the seneschal snatched the jug from the soldier to replenish
it&mdash;for all that there was not the need. Nor did he return it to
him, for already a man-at-arms with a similar vessel, directed by
the seneschal, was serving now the gentlemen of Reggio. No doubt the
thing would have been less noticeably accomplished had the servants
of the Cardinal-Count had the performing of it, as had been intended.
Yet clumsily as it was done, and although half-consciously noticed by
Ferrante at the time, he saw nothing unnatural in it, certainly nothing
to arouse suspicion.

<p>He reached for his goblet, and had it half-way to his lips, when over
the rim of it his eyes met those of his host. It was no more than a
transitory glance, for Ferrante, of intent, let his eyes sweep on, idly
and unconcerned. But in that flash he had seen something that now gave
him pause. It was not much; but men of a high order of intelligence, as
was Ferrante, are of a singularly swift receptivity to impressions. The
Cardinal-Count, he had observed, was watching him furtively from under
lowered brows, a something cruel and cunning in his glance. Then it was
that, as in a flash of recollection, he remembered his subconscious
observation that the wine for his followers and himself had not been
poured from the same jug as that which had supplied the gentlemen of
Reggio. And that trifle, which he had scarcely noticed at the time,
assumed now gigantic proportions in his mind. The wine before him and
his three officers was poisoned! He knew it as much by intuition as by
the slight evidences he had.

<p>In some fraction of a second did all this flash through Ferrante's
mind, and before that second was complete he had determined how to act.

<p>Another in his place, and presuming upon the presence of his
men-at-arms, would have risen there and then, and flung his accusation.
Not so Ferrante. He would not have the laugh against him if, after all,
he should be wrong; would not have it said that timidity had misled
him. Besides, it pleased him to deal more subtly, more humorously, with
Messer Guancia.

<p>So he stayed himself in the very act of raising his goblet, and in the
most natural manner&mdash;as one who has just bethought him of something
that is of moment&mdash;he leaned across the board, and called to Orsini,
who was seated some way below him on the opposite side. Orsini looked
up.

<p>"Your tablets," said Ferrante. "I have remembered that I have a note to
make." And whilst Orsini fumbled for his tablets and Ferrante waited,
leaning across the board, he took the opportunity to mutter two words
quickly in Spanish to Ramires who sat immediately facing him.

<p>"No <i>bibas!</i>" said he, under cover of the murmur of conversation about
him, and trusting to the fact that, in Reggio, Spanish&mdash;particularly
when it was slurred and muttered&mdash;would not be understood. By the quick
lift of the Spaniard's eyebrows he saw that he had caught the words.

<p>Ferrante sat back, and lest Messer Guancia should suspect his motives
he leisurely lifted his goblet, and appeared to sip the wine. In
reality he did no more than hold it a moment against his tightened
lips, which he was careful to wipe when he set down the cup again.

<p>The eyes of the Cardinal-Count became alight with satisfaction. But
Ferrante was blind to this. His neighbour handed him Orsini's tablets.
He opened them, and wrote the imperative command, "Drink not! Warn
Taddeo." He closed them and passed them back.

<p>"Read what I have written, Fabio," he said. "I wish you to bear it in
your mind."

<p>Orsini obeyed him, and Ferrante admired the manner in which the
youngster kept his countenance, and played his part. Fabio looked up
smiling and nodded; then turned the tablets about in his hands as one
who hesitates. At last, leaning over to della Volpe.

<p>"I think this matter concerns you as much as it does me, Taddeo," he
said. "Does it not?" he added, and passed the tablets across to the
veteran.

<p>And he was no more than in time. He stayed Taddeo in the very act
of lifting his cup. Taddeo read, was baffled for a moment, then
understood, and nodded to Ferrante.

<p>"I will see it done," said he, and pocketed the tablets.

<p>Ferrante heaved a sigh of infinite relief, and considered the second
move in this queer game to which he had set his hand. In that instant
the Cardinal-Count rose to his feet, and called upon his friends to
quaff the health of their noble guests.

<p>There was a premonitory scraping of chairs as the company prepared to
rise. But Ferrante, swifter than the rest, leaped to his feet before
them, snatching up his goblet as he did so.

<p>"One moment ere you drink," he cried, and with outspread left hand
he stayed the company in the very act of rising. "Let me beg your
Magnificence to resume your seat," said he. "I have some words to say
in my master's name touching the surrender of Reggio&mdash;a message for
you, which I make no doubt will lead you the more gladly to pledge us,
and him with us."

<p>His eyes sparkled, there was a delicate flush on his still youthful
cheek. But neither of these signs was the herald of an eager eloquence,
as those others deemed them. They were the outward manifestation of the
delight that Ferrante took in this game of strategy he had set himself
to play; this pitting of quick wits against the clumsy murderous plan
of the Cardinal-Count. In anticipation, he was already relishing the
deadly jest he had prepared.

<p>"My message to you," he began&mdash;and carelessly, abstractedly, as he
spoke, he passed the goblet into his left hand, "is a message of good
will. Had bloodshed been necessary ere Reggio di Monte had raised her
gates to us&mdash;"

<p>He broke off abruptly, staring at the Cardinal-Count.

<p>"What ails your Excellency?" he cried, alarm ringing loud in his
question.

<p>Instantly all eyes were turned upon the lord of Reggio, all necks
were craned that men might obtain a better view of the prelate, who
sat back, blinking in surprise. In that moment Ferrante's left hand
set down his cup beside Messer Annibale's. His eyes never left the
Cardinal's face.

<p>"Why nothing ails me," said the prelate, nonplussed. "I am well."

<p>Ferrante's fingers closed now over the stem of Annibale's goblet. His
own body thrust forward screened the act from those below him on his
side. Annibale's body, similarly placed allowed the lord of Reggio
to see nothing of it. For the rest all eyes were too intent upon the
Cardinal-Count to observe that swift exchange, and ere any glances
returned to Ferrante he was holding his goblet at the height of his
breast, as they had last beheld him.

<p>"A trick of the lights, perhaps," laughed Ferrante. "It seemed to me
that your Excellency had turned pale, and that you sank back exhausted."

<p>"No, no," said the prelate, with a reassuring smile. "I am well. I may
have sat back. No more than that. Continue, pray, Messer Ferrante."

<p>Ferrante continued&mdash;a rambling speech full of words of great sound but
little meaning, out of which it transpired that the people of Reggio
might rest assured that in the Lord Cesare Borgia they would find an
overlord to care for them as for his very children. It was hardly what
he had seemed to promise at the outset, and it provoked the secret
scorn of most of the Lord Guancia's friends. When he had done he raised
his goblet on high.

<p>"I drink," he said, "to the peace and prosperity of Reggio di Monte,
and to the success and victory of our Duke's arms."

<p>And slowly, with head well back, he drained his cup.

<p>Whoever pledged Cesare Borgia, as he had called upon them to do, he
was sure that the Cardinal-Count would not; and he observed that the
prelate did no more than make a pretence of sipping at his cup, what
time he watched Ferrante with evil, exulting eyes.

<p>Ferrante's officers watched him, too, their eyes dilating with alarm,
whilst in obedience to his message of warning they did no more than
pretend to touch their wine.

<p>But one or two there were who drank, and among these was Messer
Annibale, the Cardinal's nephew. No doubt the luscious fare of his
uncle's table had quickened his thirst, for he drained his cup to the
dregs ere he set it down.

<p>And then, as Ferrante was resuming his seat, the Cardinal still
watching him&mdash;Messer Annibale uttered a scream, clutched at his girdle
as if to loosen it, and went over backwards, taking his chair with him.
Chair and man crashed to the ground. Out of it rolled the nephew of
the Cardinal-Count, and some little way along the floor; then he lay
prone, his legs drawn under him, his contracted hands clawing at the
tesselated floor, whilst his drawn mouth emitted scream after scream of
anguish.

<p>That and other horrid sounds rang upon the panic-stricken silence. The
gelid hand of terror closed about the hearts of that noble company.
Stricken sat all, with white faces and staring eyes, no face more
white, no eyes more wide, than the lord of Reggio's own. Soldiers and
servants stood aghast, and most aghast of all the seneschal who had
handed out the poisoned wine and feared now&mdash;as feared his master&mdash;that
there had been an error in the jugs.

<p>Ferrante covertly watched the ghastly face of Messer Guancia during the
time of his nephew's cruelly long-drawn agony; he watched, and waited
until the figure on the ground lay mercifully still. Then he rose once
more, the only one at ease in that assembly. Mockery smouldered in his
eyes and curled his strong lips as he broke the awful silence.

<p>"It seems, my lord of Reggio," said he, "that here is some mistake.
Your seneschal has lacked the care that is so necessary when it is
proposed to serve the guests with poisoned wine. It seems that you have
been caught in your own toils."

<p>An effeminate youth across the board, who had no doubt drunk freely,
uttered a piercing scream, and fell forward in a swoon. Ferrante smiled
inwardly to see his plans thus furthered by the terror of a fool.

<p>"Ramires," said he quietly, "send up a score of men. Then close the
gates, and make yourself master of the palace."

<p>Ramires went out. The dozen men that had come to fill the place of
lackeys sprang to their pikes at a word from Ferrante.

<p>"Sirs," said he amiably to the company, "you will assemble at that end
of the chamber&mdash;all save my lord, the Cardinal-Count." And seeing a
hand or two steal furtively to the breast of a doublet: "The man who
bares a weapon," he told them fiercely, "shall be strangled out of
hand in the yard below. Be warned, sirs! I do not lack the means to
constrain the unwilling."

<p>And they went, a flock of frightened sheep, all but three&mdash;the lord of
Reggio, the one who was dead and the one who had fainted.

<p>Taddeo's pikemen, reinforced now by a score of others that Ramires had
brought in, stood guard over them, a line of bristling steel through
which none was mad enough to attempt to break.

<p>Ferrante turned once more to the Cardinal-Count. Messer Guancia sat
gripping the arms of his chair, but showing no other sign of life. The
condottiero said but one word to him, said it pointing to the goblet
that stood, almost untasted, before the prelate.

<p>"Drink!"

<p>The wits of the Cardinal-Count were in a mist; but at that sharp word
of command they sought to struggle through. He stirred, shrank farther
back into his chair at first. Then he reared his head and sought to
summon courage to his glance and bearing that he might mask the terror
inspired him by that cup which he believed to contain poison, but which
Ferrante knew did not.

<p>"I will not drink," he answered.

<p>Ferrante shrugged his shoulders. "We shall see," he said, and called
a soldier to him. "I make you Messer Guancia's gaoler," said he. "You
will lock him in his chamber with a soldier to guard him constantly,
and you shall give him neither meat nor drink until in the guard's
presence he shall have consumed that cup of wine." He turned to his
officers. "Come, sirs. Here is no more to do."

<p>His men-at-arms drove the gentlemen of Reggio out of the chamber and
out of the palace, of which Ferrante remained in full possession. And
ere they sought their beds he explained to his mystified lieutenants
how he had juggled the affair, how fooled the Cardinal-Count for the
second time that day.

<p>"And now he sits there," he ended, smiling, "with a cup of wine before
him that is as wholesome and innocent as the milk he suckled in his
infancy, yet believing it poisoned he dares not touch it; sooner will
he suffer agonies of hunger and of thirst; possibly he may even die
sooner than set lips to it. Is it not humorous?"

<p>"It is horrible," said Orsini, shuddering.

<p>"It is just," said Taddeo; and Ramires nodded.

<p>"It is merciful," Ferrante protested. "Another would have had him
strangled. When he can endure no more, let him drink, and I'll punish
him no further."

<p>Next morning they went betimes to pay the prisoner a visit. They
found him huddled in his great gilded chair, his scarlet robes drawn
close about him. Before him on the table stood the tall gold goblet
still untouched. As they entered he looked up at them with wild,
blood-injected eyes. His face was ashen to the lips.

<p>They considered him a while in silence. Then Ferrante spoke. "You are
very obstinate, my lord," said he. "You have but to drink to obtain
release."

<p>It was intentionally an ambiguous speech, and the Cardinal-Count's only
reply was a shudder. Ferrante changed the guard and departed with his
officers.

<p>They returned at evening and found the scene unchanged&mdash;the old man
huddled in his chair; the tall goblet standing on the board before him.
But early next morning word was brought Ferrante that he had died in
the night, and Ferrante called his officers and repaired with them at
once to the great chamber.

<p>There they found the long scarlet figure lying prone, already stiff and
cold.

<p>"How is this?" Ferrante asked the sentry.

<p>"He drank some of the wine at midnight," replied the soldier, "and he
died upon the instant almost."

<p>Ferrante's brows went up; his officers muttered their astonishment. He
crossed to the table, and peered into the goblet. It was more than half
full. He smiled thoughtfully. It was not the end he had expected, but
it was very curious; it was most quaintly humorous in its way. The man
had been fulminated by his terror; destroyed by his imagination.

<p>As he stood there, considering the dead prelate, Ferrante gave
utterance to his thoughts.

<p>"Most strange," said he, "how deadly a man's terrors may become. Beware
of fear, my friends; it is man's worst enemy. It has laid this one low.
He thought that he drank poison&mdash;and there he lies, poisoned; poisoned
by his own imagination, for he drank no other." And he stirred the body
thoughtfully with his foot.

<p>"Impossible!" cried Taddeo.

<p>"There is some mistake in this," added Ramires.

<p>Ferrante looked at them and sneered. "It is the way of you; you can see
no more than what is placed before you&mdash;not always that. This wine,"
he said, taking up the goblet, "is as free from poison as when it was
first crushed. Behold the proof of it." And bearing it to his lips he
drained the cup.

<p>Then he hurled it from him with a force that sent it crashing against
the wall. He reeled a moment, his hands to his face; stood another
instant fighting for breath and rocking on his feet; then his knees
gave way and he fell supine, with arms outstretched&mdash;dead.

<p>In the Cardinal-Count's right hand they found anon the explanation. It
clutched a phial that gave off an acrid scent as of bitter almonds. The
rest was easily imagined. The lord of Reggio, deeming himself doomed
beyond all hope, and assured that sooner or later he must die by this
cup of wine which he believed was poisoned, or else perish slowly of
hunger and of thirst, had determined to drink, and so have done. But
remembering the long-drawn agony of his nephew, which he had witnessed,
and seeking at least to avoid the like, he had determined to increase
the poison in the wine, and had emptied into it the phial which, it so
chanced, he still had with him.

<p>And that is the story of the passing of Messer Ferrante da Isola, and
of the jest that killed him.

<hr><h2><a name="ch4"></a>4. GISMONDI'S WAGE</h2>

<p>BENVENUTO GISMONDI, thief and scoundrel, rode slowly northward along
the old Aemilian Way, upon a stolen horse. The country all about him
was a white glare of sun-drenched snow. Before him stretched the long
straight road, of a less virgin whiteness, and in the distance&mdash;some
four miles away&mdash;loomed hazily the spires of Forlimpopoli.

<p>Benvenuto ambled on, cursing the cold and the emptiness of his stomach,
and thrusting the numbed fingers first of one hand then of the other
into his capacious mouth for warmth. His garments, that once had been
fine, were patched and shabby; his boots were ragged, and in places
a livid gleam from his sword peeped through the threadbare velvet
scabbard. On his head he wore an old morion, much dinted and rusted,
by which he thought to give himself a military air; from under this
appeared long wisps of his unkempt black hair, to flutter like rags
about his yellow neck. His white pockmarked face, half-hidden in a
black fur of beard, was the most villainous in Italy.

<p>He was in sad case. There was too much respect for the property of
others demanded in the Romagna these days, since the Lord Cesare Borgia
had come to rule there, and such men as Benvenuto Gismondi were finding
it difficult to make a living. For there was nothing heroic about
Benvenuto's villainy. He was no reckless masnadiero, to demand fat
purses at point of sword in the open country. There were risks in that
profession which he had no desire to face. He was essentially a town
thief&mdash;of the kind that lurks in doorways on dark nights awaiting the
chance to put a knife into the back of some wayfarer and, thereafter,
plundering the corpse at leisure. And of that class the Lord Cesare
Borgia had all but made an end in the cities where he ruled.

<p>Therefore was Messer Benvenuto on his travels. He was for the
north&mdash;for Bologna, perhaps or even Milan&mdash;anywhere where an honest
God-fearing thief might ply his trade undisturbed by the excessive zeal
of a meddling podesta. But he went with no good grace; he had matter
for grievance in this enforced departure out of the Romagna; for he
was a Romagnuolo to the core of him, and he loved his native land,
accounting all others barbarous. Besides, in Cesena there was a certain
sloe-eyed Giannozza, deep-bosomed and hipped like an amphora&mdash;the Hebe
of the "Half-Moon" Inn&mdash;who had stirred our hero very violently to
love, as he understood the emotion. The thought of her and of the warm
luxuriance of her charms was torture to him as he rode there on the
snow-spread Aemilian Way, whipped by the keen north wind; and it caused
him to curse more bitterly than ever that Pope's bastard whom he blamed
for his misfortunes.

<p>In the distance, a mere speck as yet on the eternity of a road, a
horseman was approaching. But Benvenuto had no concern with him. His
concern was entirely with his own distress, and particularly with the
gnawings of his stomach. Beyond Forlimpopoli he could not go fasting.
There were limits to a man's endurance. Yet how was he to find a meal?
He might sell his horse. But without a horse, how should he reach
Bologna, or still more distant Milan? Besides, what should such as he
be doing with such a horse for sale? There would be questions, not
a doubt of that&mdash;there were always questions now in this distraught
country&mdash;and if his answers failed to satisfy the questioners, as like
as not they'd hang him. They were a deal too free with their hangings
nowadays.

<p>He ambled on, disconsolate; almost desperate enough for valour. Nearer
drew the other horseman, and Benvenuto began to take an interest in
him. He began to wonder whether a bold, browbeating manner and a harsh
voice might produce a purse, and he began to wonder whether, if he
set his mind to it, he could not sustain the one and the other. He
shivered, and his yellow teeth chattered. Before resolving he would
wait and see what manner of man was this who came alone and at so brisk
a speed. Meanwhile he unsheathed his heavy sword and held it naked in
his left hand, ready for work but concealed in the folds of his ragged
cloak. Thus he rode amain to meet this wayfarer.

<p>As the other drew nearer, Benvenuto observed that he was well mounted
and very richly dressed, wearing a quilted brigandine&mdash;a garment that
is dagger-proof&mdash;and over that a cloak of wine-coloured velvet heavily
trimmed with lynx fur. At still closer quarters Benvenuto observed
that he was young and of a very noble air, and he remarked the heavy
gold chain that lay upon his breast, the jewelled brooch that held the
black plume in his velvet cap. He concluded that here was a nut worth
cracking.

<p>He watched the fellow furtively as they drew together, and edged his
horse towards the middle of the road so that they must pass each
other at close quarters. The young man scarce glanced at him; he rode
absorbed in his own thoughts. Benvenuto fell to trembling violently
and his courage went near to deserting him completely. But he braced
himself at the last moment, and as the stranger passed abreast of him
he stood up suddenly in his stirrups, flashed up his sword, and aimed
with all his strength a blow at that young head.

<p>Too late the stranger saw the movement and the weapon. His hands
tightened on his reins even as the murderous stroke descended. He
swayed a second, being smitten, and then plunged downwards from the
saddle. His frightened horse broke away at the gallop. The young man's
spur hung in the stirrup, nor was released until he had been dragged a
dozen paces through the snow. He lay there, and the horse, unhampered
now and unchecked, sped on like a mad thing.

<p>Benvenuto wheeled and rode up to the fallen man. For some minutes he
sat breathing hard and grinning, as he considered that figure supine
there in the snow, grinning too, but breathing not at all. Free of
the confining cap, which had fallen off and lay some way behind, the
youth's fair hair was flung back from the head and embrued from the
wound that had been dealt him. Blood, too, lay in small patches along
the trail made by his body as it was dragged.

<p>Benvenuto looked back along the road towards Forlimpopoli, and forward
towards Cesena. No living thing was in sight. So, well content, he
got down from his horse to reap the harvest of his bloody work. But
the rich raiment that had tempted him with its promise into daring so
much now seemed to mock him. He rose from an almost fruitless search,
cursing the poverty of the dead man's pockets, and weighing in his palm
the gold chain he had taken from his victim's neck and a silken purse
containing but three gold ducats. His prize, it seemed, was gilt, not
solid gold.

<p>To have risked so much for so little, angered him. To have been put to
the necessity of killing a man to earn three gold pieces and a trumpery
chain was an irony practised upon him by an unfriendly fate. He
reflected that to commit murder was a grave matter. It was to imperil
the salvation of his immortal soul&mdash;and Messer Benvenuto accounted
himself a truly devout and pious fellow, a dutiful son of Mother
Church. He had a special devotion for the black Madonna of Loreto, and
was a member of the Confraternity of St Anna, whose scapular he wore
day and night upon his dirty skin.

<p>It was by no means the first time he had killed a man; but never had
he been so poorly compensated for the mortal sin and the risk of hell
which the deed entailed.

<p>He glanced down at the blue-white face of his victim, and it seemed
to him that the dead eyes were leering with evil conscious mockery. A
panic seized him. He turned, snatched his horse's bridle, flung himself
shuddering into the saddle and rode off. Twenty paces away he reined in
again. He was behaving like a fool. The man's cloak with its heavy lynx
fur was worth at least five ducats; and there was a jewel in his cap.

<p>He went back, and in going he pondered. What should he do with a rich
cloak? To sell it would be no easier than to sell his horse. Out of
that train of thought came inspiration. The dead man could give him all
he lacked, and never feel the loss of it, being dead.

<p>He dismounted again, tethered his horse by the roadside, and set about
his horrid task. But first he closed those hideously mocking eyes. To
propitiate the departed spirit he even went so far as to kneel there,
in the slush and snow, and patter a prayer for its repose. Then he set
to work. He took the body under the armpits, and dragged it from the
road. Down into the broad ditch and up again into the field beyond he
dragged it. There, with chattering teeth and fingers that shook so that
his work was retarded despite his frenzy of haste, he stripped the dead
youth of his dagger-proof brigandine of quilted velvet, his undervest
of silk, his great boots of grey leather, and his trunk-hose. Next he
stripped away his own greasy rags, shuddering all the while and making
queer whimpering noises&mdash;partly because the cold was punishing him
acutely, partly because of other things.

<p>There in the bright January sun he arrayed himself piece by piece in
the gay plumage of the cockerel he had plucked. Thus he should travel
in ease and dignity to Milan; thus command respect and courteous
treatment&mdash;matters with which his acquaintance hitherto had been
subjective. Thus should many a door be opened to him and many an
opportunity discovered.

<p>The dead man was much of his own proportions; even the boots, one of
which he had already donned, should comfortably encase his feet. As
he took up the second boot he discovered a certain stiffness on the
inside of the leg. He fingered it, bending the leather in his hand; the
matter intrigued him. He ran his fingers over the other boot; there was
no corresponding stiffness there. Again he returned to the one he had
not yet donned; and now a foxy gleam shone from his close-set eyes;
thoughtfully he rubbed his long lean nose. That something was hidden
in that boot was very clear; and it was a common enough hiding-place.
Now a thing that is worth one man's while to hide is, reflected Messer
Benvenuto, worth another man's while to find. It looked as if this
enterprise of his were not to be so fruitless as he at first supposed.

<p>To rip the outer leather from the lining was a moment's work. Then from
the gap he drew a package of papers wrapped in a blank sheet on the
edge of which was the broken half of a green seal. It was held together
by some threads of silk. To snap these threads and to fling off the
wrapper took Messer Benvenuto no longer than it takes to blink an eye.
He spread one of the three contained sheets, and ran his glance over
the large angular hand that sprawled across it.

<p>It was a letter couched in Latin, and from that letter our rascal
gathered, first and foremost, that his victim's name was Crespi, and
that Faenza was his native place. He learned what more there was to
learn; for Ser Benvenuto was no illiterate clod. A fond mother had
vowed him to the Church, and so he had perforce done his humanities,
and for all that years were sped since then, he had not yet forgotten
that Latin tongue which so painfully he had acquired. His eyes gleamed
as they followed and spelled out the sprawling characters. Here indeed
was matter that might be worth a hundred times its weight in gold. But
not here in the open would he stand to investigate the full value of
his prize. Someone might chance to come that way, and find him there
with the incriminating body. He looked about.

<p>In the far distance, towards Forlimpopoli, specks were moving along
the road. A cavalcade approaching; though no sound reached him yet.
In haste he thrust the papers into his bosom, and his foot into the
boot&mdash;never heeding that his stocking was all wet from standing in
the snow. Then he took Messer Crespi's sword, and buckled it about
his loins; lastly he snatched up the cloak, shook the snow from it,
and flung it jauntily upon his own shoulders. Of his own discarded
rags he made a bundle, and with this he sprang back to the road.
There yet remained Messer Crespi's cap, which still lay where it had
fallen. He took it up. It was slashed across the crown; but, being very
ample of folds, this was easily dissembled, and there was no blood on
the outside and little on the inside of it. But there was something
else inside it&mdash;a black mask, a complete vizor for the face, such as
gentlemen sometimes wore when they went abroad.

<p>Benvenuto replaced it in the crown of the cap, and set the
latter a-top his lank, ill-kempt black hair. In his finery his
countenance&mdash;half-wolf, half-fox&mdash;looked more villainous than ever.

<p>He glanced over his shoulder at the little cavalcade, still very
distant; then he got to horse and set off. But he no longer rode
northward; he was returning in his tracks; returning to Cesena, urged
to this course by the papers he had discovered. For at Cesena lay
Cesare Borgia himself, in winter quarters, and Benvenuto's business now
was with Cesare Borgia, whom these papers so very closely touched. The
Duke's open-handedness was a byword. Benvenuto pondered that liberality
of the Duke's, and relished the reflection that he bore him matter to
cause him to open his hands wide indeed.

<p>Having ridden a mile or so, Benvenuto flung his bundle of rags into the
ditch. He saw it sink through the half-frozen crust of snow, and pushed
on unburdened.

<p>Presently he drew forth the papers again, that he might complete their
perusal. This warmed him to the very core. He had done a glorious, a
patriotic thing, it seemed, in disposing of this Messer Crespi&mdash;whoever
he might be. And he was clearly clean of sin; since who kills a
murderer is no worse than who robs a thief. That Messer Crespi was a
murderer&mdash;a very desperate murderer&mdash;these letters fully showed, for
they revealed a barbarous plot against the life of no less a person
than the High and Mighty Lord Cesare Borgia, Duke of Valentinois
and Romagna. They showed Messer Crespi to have been one of a band
of patriots from various states of the Romagna&mdash;the letters did not
disclose how many&mdash;who had leagued themselves to do this work. They
moved in secret, he gathered, and were not known one to another, to
lessen the dangers of betrayal. This was plain, since Messer Crespi was
bidden to come masked to the assembly that was to be held that very
night in the Palazzo Magli, in Cesena. But the leader, the inspirer,
the soul and brain of the conspiracy, was evidently known to all; for
he signed the letter, and his name was Hermes Bentivogli&mdash;the name of
as bloody and treacherous a tyrant as lived in Italy, the murderer of
the Marescotti, the son of Giovanni Bentivogli, Lord of Bologna.

<p>Benvenuto was, himself&mdash;as you have gathered&mdash;no lover of Cesare
Borgia, and, far from deploring his assassination, he would have
hailed his slayer as a hero among heroes. But a man of his peculiar
temperament is not to be expected to sink self-interest in political
considerations, and to forgo the chance of doing Cesare Borgia a
service for which Cesare Borgia should reward him with a pretty,
twinkling heap of golden ducats.

<p>Benvenuto had those ducats very clear in his imagination. He saw them
piled before him on the dirty table of the "Half-Moon" Inn; saw the
yellow, rippling gleam of them; heard the rustle and chink of the heap
as it was stirred. He saw the black eyes of his luscious Giannozza grow
big at the sight of so much gold; he felt her soft, warm body yielding
generously at last to his embraces.

<p>Oh, most brightly shone the star of Messer Benvenuto Gismondi, thief
and scoundrel. His fortune rose in a neap tide. And in the pleasant
consideration of this heartening fact he rode across the bridge over
the Savio, and so entered the strong city of Cesena.

<p>First to the Half-Moon to leave his horse in charge of the gaping,
cross-eyed landlord&mdash;Giannozza's puny and most unworthy sire; then to a
barber's to have his hair and beard trimmed combed and perfumed, that
that part of him should be in harmony with the whole; then back to
the Half-Moon to dine in an inner chamber which he had bespoken, with
Giannozza to bring his meat and pour his wine.

<p>In the common-room men stared at him, as he swept through; and he,
perceiving this, broke upon Giannozza in the inner chamber with the
exclamation: "Behold me&mdash;a jewel set in brass."

<p>Giannozza, hand on hip, measured him with some wonder and more mistrust
in her bold, black eyes. She was a handsome baggage, full conscious of
it, gracefully sluggish, and very insolent.

<p>"You are soon returned," said she, and added uncompromisingly the
question&mdash;"What villany have you been working?"

<p>"Villany?" quoth he. "Nay, now&mdash;villany!"

<p>"Whence, else, your fine feathers? What gull have you been plucking?"

<p>He took her in his arms, and pulled her to him, leering; she permitting
it with a cool indifference. "I have taken service, sweet," he
announced.

<p>"Service, thou? With Satan?"

<p>"With the Lord Cesare Borgia," said he&mdash;for, being a thief, it
naturally follows that he was a facile liar. Though as a liar you do
not here see him at his best; for, after all, what he now stated might
be construed into intelligent anticipation.

<p>"Has he hired you for his murderer?" she inquired, with the cool
insolence that was a part of her.

<p>"I am his saviour," he announced, and fell into big but obscure talk of
services rendered and to be rendered and more of the rich guerdons that
were to fall to him of the Duke's bounty; she listening, her red lips
curling into a lazy smile of insolent unbelief in him. In the end that
smile so angered him that he flung her off rudely, and sat down.

<p>"I am to confer with his Magnificence today," he announced. "He awaits
me at the castle. You'll believe me when I spread his ducats before
your big, fool's eyes. Oho! Ser Benvenuto will be <i>ben venuto</i> then!"

<p>She thrust out her heavy lip at him.

<p>"Dost sneer at me, thou trull?" he bellowed, furious. Then with a
superior air, "Bestir!" he bade her. "Bring meat and wine. The Lord
Duke of Valentinois awaits me. Bestir, I say!"

<p>She looked him over from under half-closed lids, and sneered audibly.

<p>"You knock-kneed, pock-marked foulness," said she. "What airs be these?"

<p>He choked with fury&mdash;the more hurt because the straightness of his legs
was the pride of one who could lay claim to few physical advantages. He
set aside his anger, to argue the matter. But she cut him short.

<p>"Such airs as yours cost money," she informed him. "Where is your
purse?"

<p>He produced a ducat, and banged it resonantly upon the dirty table. At
the unexpected sight of that yellow disc her eyes widened in surprise
and greed, and her manner underwent an instant change. She bustled now
in preparation for his meal; fetched a bottle from the cellar, and from
the kitchen a steaming shoulder of roast kid, exuding a rich savoury
smell of garlic. She placed white bread before him&mdash;a rare luxury
that&mdash;and flung logs upon the fire.

<p>He, being very hungry, forgot what remained of his recent anger, and
fell to with a relish; so that for a while the dingy chamber re-echoed
with the prodigious sounds of his eating and drinking. Anon, his vigour
abating, he bestowed some attention upon the girl as she moved about
the chamber with the indolent, feline grace that was natural to her.
The food heartened him; and what with the wine and the great fire that
roared now in the chimney and threw fantastic light and shadow through
the gloomy room, Messer Benvenuto was pervaded by a pleasant torpor.

<p>"Sit here beside me, Giannozza," he besought her, pulling gently at her
plump arm.

<p>"And his Magnificence of Valentinois? Does he no longer await you?"
quoth she, with her lazy sneer.

<p>He scowled. "A plague on his Magnificence," he grumbled, and fell
thoughtful. It was very snug and pleasant here, and outside it was
chill and bleak, and there was snow on the ground. And yet&mdash;surely
it was worth the trouble of walking up to the castle to have his cap
filled with ducats!

<p>He rose and strode to the window. He looked out upon a slushy
stableyard and a patch of turquoise sky. The afternoon was waning, and
the thing must be done that afternoon or not at all.

<p>"Ay, I must go, sweet. But I'll be away no longer than I must." He took
up his cloak, and swathed it about him, planted the plump cap upon
his ugly head, kissed her noisily&mdash;she suffering it with that same
detestable apathy&mdash;and swaggered out.

<p>Benvenuto took his way to the main street, and then up the hill towards
the citadel, the huge Rocca built by the great Sigismondo Malatesta.

<p>Unchallenged he gained the bridge, whence the snow had been swept into
the moat below. He crossed it, going with a certain nervousness now,
and certain tremblings of spirit which increased with the thud of each
step of his upon the timbers.

<p>His imagination set an august and fearful majesty about this duke
whom he had never seen, but whose name was known to all men and
feared by most. He felt as one about to enter the presence of things
supernatural, and he went with such an awe as in his early infancy had
attended his first visits to a church.

<p>He had crossed the bridge and stood in the shadow of the great archway,
under the portcullis. Strange that no one should be there to ask his
business. Strange that the place harbouring that godlike being should
be so easy of approach.

<p>There was a sudden clank, and a halbert flashed before him and was
poised on a level with his breast. Benvenuto jumped for very fright.
A man-at-arms in marion, corselet and cuissarts had stepped out from
behind a buttress where he was sheltering from the wind and had
levelled his pike to bar our hero's passage.

<p>"<i>Alto la?</i> Whither do you go?"

<p>Benvenuto stammered a moment, flung out of countenance by this sudden
apparition of a natural foe&mdash;a representative, however humble, of law
and power. Then he recovered.

<p>"I seek the Lord Duke of Valentinois," he announced.

<p>The pike was lowered, recovered and ground with a thud. "Pass on," said
the sentry, and drew back once more behind the sheltering buttress.

<p>Benvenuto went forward, his uneasiness increasing with his surprise at
the readiness of his admission. This was not well, he reasoned. Out
of a place so easy to enter, it might be difficult to depart again.
His conscience and his nerves played tricks upon him. He wished that
he had remained in the snug parlour of the <i>"Mezza Luna"</i> with the
delectable Giannozza, and never ventured thus into the shrine of this
awful divinity. For he stood by now shivering in the courtyard of the
fortress, and not even the prospect of the ducats to be earned served
to encourage him. He wished them at the devil. Presently he braced
himself; inwardly mocked his own fears; reassured himself in part; and
looked about him.

<p>The court was deserted, save for two sentries&mdash;one pacing at the foot
of a stone staircase that led up to a gallery on the first floor; the
other guarding a deep archway that led to an inner court. Thence came a
murmur of voices, and as Benvenuto peered in that direction he saw that
it was thronged with people.

<p>The sentries paid no heed to him; but he considered them attentively.
The man guarding the staircase was a sturdy, swarthy fellow of
forbidding countenance; the other, a tall, fair-bearded knave, looked
benign and friendly. Benvenuto's choice was made. He advanced with
simulated resoluteness towards the archway and the yellow-bearded guard.

<p>"I seek the Lord Duke of Valentinois," he announced, dissembling as
best he might his tremors. "Where shall I find him?"

<p>The guard looked at him. If the livid, pock-marked face was villainous,
the clothes were noble; and whilst to a courtier Messer Benvenuto must
have looked a lackey, to a lackey he looked a courtier. So without
hesitation the guard stood aside before him, and pointed with his pike
into the inner courtyard.

<p>"His Highness is in there."

<p>Benvenuto passed on, and, as he went, the sounds from the inner court
he was approaching died suddenly away. The crowd had fallen into
silence. It greatly intrigued him to know what might be taking place.
On the far side of the archway he tapped the arm of a sentry, who
stood on a horse block, gazing over the heads of the people assembled
there&mdash;a motley gathering of perhaps a hundred men of all conditions,
in which, however, the soldier and the courtier predominated. The
man-at-arms looked down impatiently, and Benvenuto repeated that he
sought the Lord Duke of Valentinois.

<p>"He is yonder," said the guard, pointing into the heart of the throng.

<p>Benvenuto was intrigued. What was taking place? He stood on tip-toe;
but being short of stature he gained nothing by it. Suddenly the crowd
broke into cheers and hand-clappings. Again Benvenuto plucked the
sentry's sleeve.

<p>"My business with his Highness presses," he urged. "It is of the first
importance. I must see him instantly."

<p>The guard considered him. "I doubt you'll have to wait," said he. He
pointed to a page in scarlet and yellow, who, astride a cannon by the
wall, was shouting and clapping his hands. "Best tell him," said the
soldier. "He'll take your message for you as soon as may be."

<p>Benvenuto thanked him and went on, pressing unceremoniously past one
or two who blocked his way. He spoke to the page politely; he shouted
to him; finally he shook him by the leg, and thus gained at last his
attention.

<p>"I seek the Lord Duke of Valentinois," he said for the fourth time
since his arrival in that fortress. "It is a very pressing matter&mdash;a
matter of life and death."

<p>The page looked him over superciliously, and grinned. "You'll have to
wait," he answered. "His Highness is busy over there."

<p>"Over there?" echoed Benvenuto. But the page took no further heed of
him. Whereupon, determined to see what might be taking place, Benvenuto
climbed on to the gun, behind the boy. Thence he could see over the
heads of the throng, and what he saw surprised him.

<p>These spectators formed a ring, from which all snow had been swept. In
the centre of this two men faced each other, alert, and with hands held
slightly forward. Both were naked to the waist, and they contrasted
oddly. One was tall, big-limbed and heavy&mdash;a very giant&mdash;swarthy,
black-bearded, and hairy as a goat about the trunk and limbs; the
other, tall also, yet not quite so tall, was of a slenderness that
looked delicate by comparison; his long hair and crisp beard were of
an auburn fairness, and his naked torso was smooth, and of a gleaming,
alabaster whiteness. They were wrestlers about to come to grips, and
Benvenuto pitied the comely, white-fleshed fellow, with a contemptuous
pity, and looked forward with interest to the mauling he must receive
in the embrace of that great bear of a man to whom he was opposed.

<p>Then Benvenuto scanned the foremost ranks of the spectators, looking
for one whose regal presence must proclaim the Duke. He beheld several
very noble-looking gentlemen; but he was left in doubt as to which of
them might be Cesare Borgia, and meanwhile the wrestlers were locked
in combat, swaying this way and that, as first one heaved and then the
other. The only sound in the courtyard was the sharp hiss of their
breath, the quick patter of their shifting feet, and the smack of their
hands upon each other's body.

<p>Benvenuto watched, amazed at the fair man's ability to resist so long.
He had his fingers locked now about the giant's neck, and was exerting
his might and weight to pull the fellow forward and throw him off his
balance. And as he put forth his strength, Benvenuto was surprised by
the sudden ripple of muscle and sinew upon the smooth, alabaster back.
Protuberances as large as apples appeared suddenly under the wrestler's
shoulder-blades, whilst from either side of his spine leaped tight
ropes of unsuspected power. Clearly the fellow was none so soft as he
might seem at a first glance. Yet here his efforts were all vain. As
well might he have sought to move a bull. The giant stood with legs
wide and feet firmly planted, resisting the exertions of the other.

<p>Then in a flash he moved; wrenched his neck free; seized his opponent
about the waist, and swung him from the ground. And then, before he
could use his unquestionable advantage, his opponent's two hands had
caught him by the chin, and were forcing his head back with such harsh
violence that he was compelled to abandon his hold.

<p>They fell apart, breathing hard, very wary of each other.

<p>The page turned a white excited face to Benvenuto. "Madonna!" swore the
stripling. "He all but had him then!"

<p>"Who is the fellow?" asked Benvenuto.

<p>"A blacksmith from Cattolica," answered the boy. "They say he has not
his match for strength in the Romagna."

<p>"Ay; but the other&mdash;the white-fleshed cockerel?"

<p>The lad stared at him. "Why&mdash;whence are you? From the Indies or the new
world of Messer Colombo? That is his Highness the Duke of Valentinois."

<p>Benvenuto stared back at the page, and frowned. "Look you, young sir,"
said he, "do you seek to make a fool of me?"

<p>"Diavolo!" said the pert boy. "Who am I to improve upon God's work?"

<p>And then a shout from the crowd drew the attention of both back to the
ring.

<p>The fair wrestler had stooped, evaded the blacksmith's long arms,
and seizing him by the legs had hoisted him from the ground. But
the smith's great hands had closed about the other's neck, and so
neutralised the hold, making a throw impossible&mdash;for by their rules a
throw was no throw in which the thrower went down with the thrown. The
shout had been raised while the matter was in doubt, and when it seemed
that the blacksmith must suffer defeat, and the word that Benvenuto
caught from a hundred throats was "Duca! Duca!"

<p>It informed him that the page had spoken truth; but the surprise of it
almost stunned him. Was that, indeed the Duke? That Cesare Borgia? That
the demigod whose presence he had approached with such overwhelming awe?

<p>Why, he was no better than another. A duke who wrestled with
blacksmiths in the courtyard of his own castle! Faugh! Was that a duke
to be feared?

<p>Now that he had seen this pope's bastard, Benvenuto felt himself every
inch his equal. What false attributes&mdash;he reflected&mdash;are bestowed by
man's imaginings upon the great! Cesare Borgia was a man like any
other&mdash;and he wrestled with blacksmiths! He should pay Benvenuto
handsomely for the information Benvenuto brought him. No longer would
Benvenuto be afraid to demand full value for his wares.

<p>Meanwhile the combat assumed a greater interest in his eyes, and he
watched it, marvelling at the folly of this duke. To be a duke and to
permit himself to be rudely handled in this fashion! Like enough there
would be broken bones under that white skin of his before all was
done. It was not thus that Benvenuto understood the trade of dukes;
not thus that he had conceived them. Rich wines, a well-spread table,
a soft couch, abundance of minstrels to soothe him with their music,
and the brightness of female eyes to gladden him. These, Benvenuto
had ever conceived to be the natural attributes of dukeship. This
rough-and-tumble with blacksmiths in a courtyard on a winter day held
no place in his conception.

<p>The page was giving him information. "His Highness has promised fifty
ducats to any man who can throw him."

<p>Lackaday! Fifty ducats for such a service! Oh, the Duke was a queer
fellow&mdash;but most ducally open-handed, as people said; and Benvenuto
smiled to think of the tax he should presently levy upon that
open-handedness.

<p>Meanwhile, the wrestlers were at grips again, more vigorously than
ever; and, as he watched them, Benvenuto was lost in wonder of the
Duke's amazing agility. He seemed compact of springs of steel, so lithe
and swift were all his movements, so pantherine his step, his crouch,
his leap. The end seemed now to Benvenuto less a foregone conclusion
than at first. For the brute might of the Colossus appeared to spend
itself against the supple strength of the young Duke.

<p>The end came suddenly. Before men realised it, all was done. The
blacksmith made a sudden rush to grapple his opponent. The Duke, to
avoid him, swung aside from the hips, leaving his feet firmly planted;
as the giant missed his grip and hurtled forward, suddenly off his
balance, Cesare's arms coiled themselves sideways about his waist. His
hands locked and his grip tightened so that the smith could not turn in
that embrace to face his antagonist.

<p>Again Benvenuto saw that ripple and rise of muscle under the fair white
skin of the Duke's back. Men held their breaths. Here was a well-seized
grip. Could the Duke hold it&mdash;hold that gigantic mass of writhing
muscle?

<p>Hold it he did. He crouched a little, gathered his right leg under him,
and thrust out his left hip. It was like the stretching of an archer's
bow. And then it was as if the quarrel had been loosed, and the quarrel
was the blacksmith. There had been a sudden heave; the protruded hip
came straight again, and the blacksmith, swung an instant to the
horizontal, crashed down upon his shoulder, and lay there, groaning.
But his groans were lost in the deafening cheer that went up from the
ring of spectators in the yard and others who had watched the contest
from the windows of the quadrangle.

<p>"Duca! Duca!" was the shout. Caps flew aloft; men clapped, and laughed,
and bellowed at each other the niceties of the throw.

<p>The Duke meanwhile had gone down upon one knee beside the prostrate
wrestler, and was holding up his hand for silence. The man had been
hurt. His shoulder was dislocated or his collar-bone broken from the
force of the impact with which he fell.

<p>Men-at-arms came forward to help him, half-stunned and suffering, to
his feet.

<p>"Let Torella see to his shoulder," said the Duke, adding to the man
himself. "You are the stoutest rogue I was ever matched against, and
you made me tremble for my reputation." He had his hand on the man's
sound shoulder, very friendly as he spoke.

<p>Hearing and seeing so much, Benvenuto's contempt for his Highness
steadily increased. He caught the look of dog-like gratitude in the
smith's eye, and sneered at both of them.

<p>"You shall have twenty ducats to comfort you," were the Duke's last
words to the man. At least, thought Benvenuto, there was no doubt that
he was free with his ducats; and that was the main thing now.

<p>An attendant fetched the Duke a silken vest and a fur-lined surcoat,
and he donned the garments with the quick grace peculiar to all his
actions.

<p>Benvenuto begged the page to announce him to his Highness, urging the
importance of the matter upon which he came, which already had been too
long delayed. The page obligingly departed on that errand. Benvenuto
saw him hover a moment about the Duke, then make a profound obeisance
and deliver his message.

<p>Cesare was settling the surcoat upon his shoulders. He inclined his
head to listen to the boy; then he looked up, and his eyes fell upon
Benvenuto, standing there full now of arrogance and assurance. And that
same arrogance went out of Benvenuto when Cesare's eyes fell upon him,
as a candle goes out in a gust of wind.

<p>What there might be in the glance of those matchless eyes he could not
have attempted to tell you. But something sped upon it to his brain,
and partly numbed it. It was as if his body were of glass, and those
eyes were looking through it into the dirty little soul within.

<p>Then, abruptly, the Duke beckoned him. He got down from his eminence,
and went forward without swagger, his breathing quickened, his skin
cold. Soldiers, courtiers and others fell away before him, opening
a lane, through which he passed into the immediate presence of that
auburn-haired young man.

<p>"You have something to tell me," said the Duke, his voice gentle
enough, and yet the coldest that Benvenuto had ever known; his eyes so
level and penetrating that Benvenuto could not support their glance.

<p>"Something&mdash;something of great moment, Magnificent," faltered the thief.

<p>Cesare was silent an instant, still considering him; and in that
instant the wretched Benvenuto felt that he had no secrets from the
Duke; that all that there was to know of him was known to this man
whose equal he had so lately accounted himself.

<p>"Come with me, then," said the Duke in his gentle voice&mdash;a voice rich
in melody&mdash;and turned away.

<p>Preceded by the page he crossed the courtyard, and mounted six steps to
an oaken door studded with great iron nails, which a man-at-arms flung
open for him at his approach. Benvenuto followed meekly, uncomfortable
under the many eyes that conned him and detected&mdash;he was convinced&mdash;his
true station and quality under his brave stolen raiment.

<p>From the bright, clear sunshine of the courtyard he passed into a large
and somewhat gloomy hall, cheered by the ruddy play of light on the
floor and walls and ceiling from a great fire that burned in the vast
cowled fireplace. The floor was strewn with fresh rushes; there were
tapestries on two of the walls, and a staircase ascended to a gallery
on the right. Near the fire stood a large arm-chair in red velvet with
an escutcheon in gold which glowed and faded as the firelight caught
it. By this was a massive table, elaborately carved, and yonder a
buffet upon which stood goblets and a tall golden beaker. From this
latter a faint steam was rising, and Benvenuto's nostrils caught and
were set a-quiver by the sweet perfume of spiced wine.

<p>Cesare flung himself into the chair by the fire. The page fetched the
beaker and a goblet&mdash;a single goblet, Benvenuto noted&mdash;and poured wine
for his master, thereafter setting the beaker on the table.

<p>The Duke waved the stripling away into the background, and turned at
last to Benvenuto, who stood there in mid-apartment, foolish and ill at
ease.

<p>"Now, sir," said he, "your errand?"

<p>The question fell abruptly. It was by no means the question Benvenuto
had expected to begin with. But he must answer it.

<p>"I am in possession, my lord," he said, "of particulars of a plot which
aims at your life."

<p>He had counted upon making a profound impression. But this was a day of
surprises for him, of incredible revelations into the ways and habits
of dukes. Not a muscle moved in Cesare's calm face; unblinking those
haunting eyes continued to regard him. There fell a pause, terminated
at last by the Duke, whose slender fingers impatiently tapped the table.

<p>"Well, sir, well?" he cried sharply. "What else?"

<p>"What else?" stammered Benvenuto. "Why&mdash;that is all."

<p>"All?" the Duke frowned. "But these particulars?"

<p>"I&mdash;I have them here. They are contained in these letters, of which I
became possessed today, and&mdash;and I have ridden at all speed to bring
them to you." He was fumbling in his doublet.

<p>"You have ridden? Whence?"

<p>"Eh&mdash;from Forli."

<p>He produced the letters. He had, as you know, entertained bold
thoughts of the price he would ask, the bargain he would drive before
surrendering them. But all notion of that had gone from him with his
courage. He had beheld an instance of the Duke's proverbial liberality
in the case of the wrestler. He had no doubt the Duke would be no less
liberal with him. He would depend upon that. He advanced timidly to the
table, and set the letters before the Duke.

<p>Cesare scanned them rapidly. Midway through the first his brows became
knit. He gave a sharp order to the page.

<p>"Beppo, summon me Messer Gherardi."

<p>The page went up the stairs, along the gallery, and through a doorway
at the end. Cesare resumed his reading. Benvenuto waited, wondering.

<p>At last the Duke set down the letters on the table. Benvenuto had
expected outbursts, transports of rage, ferocious satisfaction, then
protestations of gratitude to him&mdash;the Duke's saviour&mdash;and, lastly, a
golden recompense. From the beginning nothing fell out as he expected.
There was no outburst, no trace of anger even. The Duke's handsome
lofty face remained as calm as though such matters were of daily
occurrence in his life; his words, when he spoke, did not seem even
remotely to bear upon the matter of this conspiracy.

<p>"What is your name, sir?"

<p>Under the play of those awful, beautiful eyes Benvenuto answered
truthfully, feeling that he dared not lie&mdash;that to lie were idle: "I am
Benvenuto Gismondi, your Highness' servant."

<p>"Of Forli?"

<p>"Of Forli, Magnificent."

<p>"And your trade?"

<p>Benvenuto's uneasiness welled up. "I&mdash;I am a poor man, Highness. I&mdash;I
live as I can."

<p>He saw Cesare's eyes pondering his garments&mdash;the gold chain on his
breast, the jewel in the cap he held&mdash;with the faintest yet most
sinister of smiles. Too late he perceived how he had blundered; too
late he cursed himself for not having come with a tale prepared. But
how should he have expected such questions? What manner of man was this
who could turn aside from such a matter as Benvenuto had set before
him, to make inquiries so alien to the subject.

<p>"I see," said Cesare, and the tone was such that it turned the
scoundrel's soul to water, froze the marrow in his spine, filling him
as it did with horrid premonitions. "I see. And this Messer Crespi of
Faenza, to whom these letters were addressed&mdash;he is dead?" It was but
the slightly rising inflection of the voice that made a question of
that statement.

<p>Livid, shaking now in every limb, and will-less before this man who
seemed to draw the very soul out of him, Benvenuto answered: "He is
dead, Magnificent."

<p>"Ah! You were well advised in that," the Duke agreed. He smiled, and
his smile was the deadliest Gismondi had ever seen. "He was, I take
it," the Duke pursued, "a man of much your own height and build."

<p>"It is so, Magnificent."

<p>"That, too, is fortunate, as it is fortunate you should have had the
happy thought to array yourself in his apparel. No doubt the condition
of your own would be a sufficient justification."

<p>"My lord, my lord!" cried the abject scoundrel, and would have flung
himself upon his knees to implore mercy but that Cesare's next words
stayed him.

<p>"Why&mdash;what now? It is all most fortunate, I say. I would not have it
other."

<p>Benvenuto stared into that smiling face, sorely mistrustful. He
detected something sinister in that fair speech.

<p>Steps sounded on the gallery. Down the stairs came the page, returning,
followed by a well-nourished gentleman in black, whose face was round
and white, whose nose was sharp, and whose crafty eyes took, in
passing, the measure of Messer Benvenuto.

<p>"Ah, Agabito!" the Duke hailed him, and held out the letters. "These
pretend to be from Hermes Bentivogli. Do you recognise the hand?"

<p>The secretary took the papers, and crossed to the window to examine
them in the light. Suddenly he cried out: "What is this, my lord?"

<p>"Did I bid you read, Agabito?" quoth the Duke, with the faintest show
of impatience. "Is the hand that of Hermes Bentivogli?"

<p>"Assuredly," answered Agabito readily. He was well acquainted with the
writing of the Bolognese.

<p>The Duke sighed, and rose. "Then the thing is true, and he is here in
Cesena. He has vowed to kill me, more than once. At last, it seems, he
has the courage to take the thing in hand."

<p>"He must be seized, my lord."

<p>Cesare stood with bowed head, lost in thought. Benvenuto, seemingly
forgotten for the moment, watched furtively, and waited.

<p>"There may be a score of others in the plot," said Cesare slowly.

<p>"But he is the brain&mdash;the brain," cried Agabito, slapping the papers in
his excitement.

<p>"God help the body that is ruled by such a brain," sneered the Duke.
"Ay, he should be crushed. He should be made to feel the full weight,
the full terror of my justice."

<p>Benvenuto shuddered to the very soul of him at the words and the tone.

<p>"But&mdash;" The Duke shrugged wearily, and turned to face the fire. "He is
of Bologna, and behind Bologna there is France, and if I strangle this
cut-throat, God alone knows what complications may confront me."

<p>"But with such evidence as this&mdash;" began Agabito.

<p>"It is no matter of right or wrong," Cesare snapped at him. "Before
I move&mdash;" He stopped short, and turned again. His glance, hard and
bright, fastened once more upon Benvenuto, whilst he extended his hand
to Gherardi for the papers. The secretary promptly resigned them.

<p>"Here," said the Duke, and he now held out the letters to Benvenuto.
"Take you these papers, of which in the way of your scoundrel's trade
you have become possessed. Learn their contents by heart. Then go at
midnight&mdash;as the letter directs&mdash;to the Palazzo Magli. Play the part of
Messer Crespi, and bring me word tomorrow of what these conspirators
intend and who their associates elsewhere."

<p>Gismondi fell back a pace, his eyes dilating. "My lord," he cried. "My
lord, I dare not."

<p>"Oh, as you please," said the Duke most sweetly. "But there are enough
cut-throats in Italy&mdash;too many vermin of your kind&mdash;that we should
hesitate to dispose of one. Beppo, call the guard."

<p>"My lord," cried Benvenuto again, starting forward, shaken by fresh
terror; and the sudden hoarseness of his voice surprised him. "A
moment, Magnificent&mdash;of your pity! If I do this thing...?" he began;
then stopped, appalled by the very contemplation of it.

<p>"If you do this thing," said Cesare, answering the uncompleted
question, "we will not inquire into the death of Messer Crespi. Our
forgetfulness shall be your wage. I confess," he continued, his tone
most amiable, "that I shall do this reluctantly, for I have vowed to
exterminate your kind. Nevertheless, out of consideration for the
service you are to render, I will hold my hand this time. Fail me, or
refuse the task, and there is the rope&mdash;first to extract confession
from you on the hoist, and afterwards to hang you. The choice is yours."

<p>Gismondi stared and stared into that beautiful young face, so mockingly
impassive. His terror gave way to a dull rage, and but for the
exhibition of strength he had so lately witnessed in the courtyard,
he might not have curbed his impulse to attempt to anticipate upon
the Duke the work of Messer Crespi's friends. He cursed his folly
in setting his trust in the gratitude of princes; he mocked his own
credulity in thinking that his tale would be received with joy and
purchased at more gold than he could carry.

<p>In the end he staggered out of the chamber, and out of the citadel,
pledged to betake himself at midnight to the Magli Palace, at the
imminent risk of his sweet life, assured that he would be watched by
Cesare Borgia's spies and that, did he fail to perform the task he had
undertaken, the risk to his life would be more imminent still.

<p>Back to the Half-Moon he went, to closet himself in that inner chamber
of the inn. He called for candles&mdash;for dusk had meanwhile fallen&mdash;and
set himself to con the papers that should have been his fortune but
were become his ruin. To the charms of Giannozza he was for once as
unresponsive as to the sneer of her cross-eyed father which had greeted
his return and his crestfallen air.

<p>Giannozza being a woman and inquisitive was intrigued by this change
in his demeanour, this gloomy abstraction; but powerless to elicit
explanation. The seductions with which she sought to loose his tongue
all left him cold. At length she fetched him a jug of spiced wine,
deeming it the likeliest philtre to charm his soul to confidences.
But still he disappointed her. He viewed the jug with apathy; the
accustomed gleam was absent from his eyes, and she listened in vain
for the usual resounding anticipatory smack of his great coarse lips.
Listlessly he took up the vessel. He moved it slowly in his hand,
causing the steaming wine to swirl, and made lachrymose philosophy.

<p>"Man," said he, "is no better than a fluid in the jug of circumstance.
It is circumstance that moulds and shapes him at her will, as this wine
is moulded in this jug; and his end is much as this." And he emptied
the jug sorrowfully.

<p>"Touching this service of the Duke's...?" began Giannozza.

<p>He waved her away. "Go. Leave me. I need to be alone a while."

<p>She called him by offensive names, which he scarce heeded, and left him.

<p>Spiritless and dejected sat he there, staring at the fire, which was
burning low by now. Thoughts of escape returned to him, to be dismissed
again. He was doomed if he essayed it. There were two strangers even
now in the common-room, drinking and making friends with Giannozza's
unutterable father. That they were emissaries of Cesare Borgia,
detailed to watch him, and to seize him should he attempt to leave the
town, he had no single doubt. His only chance was the narrow one the
Duke had set him&mdash;through the gathering of the conspirators that night.

<p>So he returned to the letters and set himself to learn by heart their
contents&mdash;as the Duke had urged him&mdash;that he might carry through this
dread affair and play that night his fearful role.

<p>Thus it befell that midnight found him at the wicket in the great
doors of the Magli Palace. Crespi's purple cloak hung loosely from his
shoulders in such a manner as to mask his figure; Crespi's black silk
vizor was upon his face, for the letters told him&mdash;and in that lay
his one chance&mdash;that the conspirators were to come masked and remain
unknown one to another.

<p>The Palazzo Magli, be it known, was at this time untenanted, wherefore
it had been chosen for this secret meeting.

<p>Gismondi found the wicket yield to his pressure. He pushed it wide, and
stepped over the sill formed by the actual door, into a blackness as of
the very pit. Instantly the wicket closed behind him, and he stood in a
darkness so thick that it seemed a thing material and palpable. All was
still; no faintest sound disturbed the stillness.

<p>"A cold night," he said aloud, this being the appointed watchword.

<p>Instantly a hand gripped his arm, and Gismondi was troubled by a thrill
of fear. Nevertheless he spoke again as was appointed.

<p>"And it will be colder anon."

<p>"Colder for whom?" quoth a voice.

<p>"For one who is warm enough tonight."

<p>His arm was released, and instantly the gloom was dispelled. A cloak
was lifted from a lanthorn standing on the ground, and from this a
circle of light gleamed feebly along the tiled floor, rose faintly
thence to a man's height, but pierced no farther into the upper
darkness.

<p>A black figure, indistinct in the misty light, his face masked, signed
to Benvenuto to follow; took up the lanthorn and crossed the hall, his
footsteps sounding eerily in that empty place. Another similar figure
remained&mdash;Benvenuto observed&mdash;standing immovable by the wicket, ready
to admit the next comer.

<p>Across the hall, Benvenuto's guide opened a door, and conducted him
into a spacious courtyard within the quadrangular precincts of the
palace. A thick soft carpet of snow lay on the ground, and from the
lanthorn swinging in the hand of his guide a yellow wheel of light fell
on the whiteness, and Benvenuto observed the tracks of many steps that
had preceded him that way. They reached another door, passed through
another hall, chill and gloomy as a vault, and so on to yet a third
door in which a wicket opened to give them passage into a garden.

<p>Here the guide paused. "Follow those tracks," he said, "to the garden's
end. There you will find a ladder against the wall. Surmount it and
follow the tracks in the next garden. They will lead you to a door,
which will be opened to your knock." He turned abruptly, stepped back
into the hall, and slammed the wicket, leaving Benvenuto alone and very
frightened.

<p>For a moment he paused with fresh and very wild ideas of flight
thrusting themselves upon his notice. But he cast them aside. Already
he had gone too far for retreat. If only it were daylight. But this
gloom, faintly relieved out here by the ghostly luminousness of the
all-covering snow, was sharpening his nerves. He looked up at the black
sky all flecked with stars that twinkled frostily, then at the track,
faintly discernible. He went forward until he found the ladder and the
wall. He went over and into another garden; found the track there, and
pursued it to the house.

<p>He readily perceived the object of so much travelling. The meeting
was not at the Palazzo Magli at all. It had been so announced as a
safeguard. By this journey across two gardens, the plotters were
introduced into another palace some distance away. Should danger
threaten the Palazzo Magli, should it be beset or invaded, the enemy
would find an empty nest, and the men who had been left on guard there
would know how to convey a warning to the real meeting-place, whence
the conspirators might disperse unchallenged.

<p>Benvenuto went up some steps to a stout door and knocked. It was opened
instantly, and as instantly closed when he had passed in. He stood once
more in Stygian darkness, his pulses beating wildly.

<p>Out of the gloom came an unexpected question&mdash;a question for which the
letters had not specifically prepared him.

<p>"Whence are you?"

<p>An instant did he hesitate, mastering his sudden terror, and answered
as Crespi must have answered: "From Faenza."

<p>"Enter," the voice bade him. And now a door was suddenly flung wide,
and a flood of light issuing from it smote and almost blinded him,
after the long spell of darkness that had been his.

<p>Peering and blinking he went forward with a bold step and a quaking
heart, thanking his patron saint and Our Lady of Loreto for the mask
that covered the livid fear writ large upon his countenance.

<p>He entered a spacious chamber, lighted by a dozen great candle-branches
suspended from ceiling and from panelled walls. Down the middle of
this room ran a long quadrangular table, at which sat seven other
plotters masked and muffled as was he&mdash;and all in silence, like so many
<i>beccamorti</i>.

<p>The door closed softly behind him, and the sound chilled him,
suggesting to his fevered mind the closing of a trap. He heartened
himself with the reflection that he had learned his lesson well; he
persuaded himself that he had nothing to fear; and he went forward to
find himself a chair at the table. He sat down and waited, glad enough
that the secrecy of the proceedings precluded intercommunion. And
presently others came, as he had come, and like himself each sat aloof
from his fellow-plotters.

<p>At last the door opened again to admit one who differed from the rest
in that he wore no mask. He was a tall man with a big-nosed, shaven
face, swarthy and bold-eyed. He was a man in the full vigour of youth,
and he was dressed from head to foot in black. A long sword swung from
his girdle, and a heavy dagger rested on his right hip. This, Benvenuto
guessed, must be Bentivogli.

<p>He was followed by two masked figures in black&mdash;who had the air of
being in attendance&mdash;and upon his entrance the entire company&mdash;now
numbering a round dozen&mdash;rose to its feet.

<p>Gismondi knew enough of this affair, into which an odd irony had thrust
him, to understand why this man, who was the head and leader of the
<i>congiura</i>, should come unmasked; for, whilst the identity of the
plotters was kept secret one from another, their leader was known, at
least by name, to each and all, as were all known, by name at least, to
him.

<p>Bentivogli stepped to the head of the long table. One of his attendants
set a chair for him; but he did not sit. He stood there, his heavy
underlip thrust forward, his great brow puckered in a frown, his dark
eyes playing over the assembled company. At length he spoke.

<p>"We are all assembled, my friends," said he, "and to me it is strange
that this should be so." A chill went through Benvenuto like a
sword-thrust in the vitals. But he gave no sign. He stood immovable
among the others.

<p>"Be seated, all," Bentivogli bade them, and all sat; but he, their
leader, remained standing.

<p>"I have reason to believe," he said, in a cold, hard voice, "that here
amongst us sits a spy."

<p>There was a rustle as of wind through trees as the muffled company
stirred at that fell announcement. Men turned to scan one another with
eyes that flashed fiercely through the eyeholes of their vizors, as
though their glances would have burned a way through the silk that
screened their neighbours' countenances. It seemed to Gismondi in that
moment of choking panic that the entire company was staring at him;
then he knew this for a trick of his imaginings; and, betide what
might, he set himself to do as others did, and to glare fiercely in his
turn at this and that one. Some three or four were upon their feet.

<p>"His name!" they cried. "His name, Magnificent!"

<p>But the Magnificent shook his head and motioned them to resume their
seats. "I know it not," said he, "nor in whose place he is here."
Whereat Gismondi breathed more freely. "All that I know is this. As I
rode hither today, we came, some two miles from Cesena, upon the body
of a man, who had been murdered, robbed and stripped almost naked.
The body was scarce cold when we discovered it, and in the distance,
towards Cesena, rode one who may well have been the murderer. Now it
chanced that by the body we found a sheet of paper, which I have here.
It bears, as you see, the half of a green seal&mdash;a seal bearing the
imprint of arms not to be identified with those of any house in Italy
today, yet arms familiar to all of you who have received communications
from me in the matter upon which we are assembled here tonight."

<p>Bentivogli paused a moment, then continued: "Undoubtedly that paper
was a wrapper that had enclosed communications from me concerned with
our present business. Whether such a letter had been addressed to the
dead man I do not know, nor do I know who he was nor whence he came.
But someone here should be able to throw light upon this matter&mdash;unless
the dead man was indeed one of us, and his murderer has replaced him at
this meeting. Can any of you give me the explanation which I seek?"

<p>He sat down and waited, looking from one to another. But no answer came
from any.

<p>Gismondi felt his breath failing him. If he had wished to speak at that
moment&mdash;if he had prepared a likely tale to meet the emergency, he
could not have given utterance to it then.

<p>A slow, cruel smile overspread Bentivogli's heavy features as the
deathly silence was maintained.

<p>"So," he said at length. "It is as I supposed." Then in an altered and
brisker tone: "Had I known where each of you was lodged, I had found
means to warn you against coming here tonight. As it is, I can only
hope that we are not yet betrayed. But this I know: that the man who
became possessed of the secret of our plot sits here amongst us now&mdash;no
doubt that he may learn its scope more fully before he goes to sell his
story to him you know of."

<p>Again there was that rustling stir, and several voices were raised,
harsh and hot with threats of what should be the fate of this rash spy.
Gismondi gnawed his lip in silence, waiting and wondering, the strength
all oozing from him.

<p>"Twelve of us were to have foregathered here tonight," said Bentivogli
impressively. "One of us, it seems, lies dead; yet twelve are here. You
see, my friends," he added, a sardonic note vibrating in his voice,
"that there is one too many. That one," he concluded, and from sardonic
his voice turned grim, "that one we must weed out."

<p>He rose as he spoke, a splendid figure, tall and stately.

<p>"I will ask you, one by one, to confer with me apart a moment," he
announced. "Each of you will come when summoned. I shall call you, not
by name but by the city from which you come."

<p>He turned from the table, and moved down into the shadows under a
gallery at the far end of the long room, and with him went the two who
had attended him on his arrival.

<p>Gismondi watched them, fascinated. The two attendants, he supposed,
would do the uprooting when the weed was discovered; for that reason
did they accompany Bentivogli, and for that purpose did they withdraw
into the shadow, as more fitting than the light for the deed of
darkness that would presently be done. An icy sweat broke on his skin.

<p>"Ancona!" called Bentivogli in a loud voice, and the name boomed
mournfully on the chill air.

<p>A masker rose upon the instant, thrusting back his chair, and marched
resolutely down the room to confer with the master-plotter.

<p>Gismondi wondered how many moments of life might yet remain him. There
was a mist before his eyes, and his heart thudded horridly at the base
of his throat with a violence that seemed to shake him in his chair at
each pulsation, and he marvelled that the boom of it did not draw the
attention of his neighbours.

<p>"Arezzo!" came the voice, and another figure rose and went apart,
passing the returning "Ancona" on the way.

<p>Bagnolo followed Arezzo, and Gismondi began to realise that the
president was taking them alphabetically. He wondered how many more
there might be before Faenza&mdash;the call to which he must respond, since
Crespi was of Faenza, as he knew. He wondered too what questions would
be asked him. From the knowledge he had gathered from the letters
be found himself able to surmise them, and he knew what answers he
should make. His terror abated, but it did not leave him; some other
questions there might be&mdash;something for which those papers did not make
provision; there must be.

<p>"Cattolica!" came the summons, and a fourth conspirator rose.

<p>And then, of a sudden, the whole company was on its feet, and Gismondi
had risen too, mechanically, from very force of imitation, and the
heart-beats in his throat were quickened now with sudden hope. In the
distance there had been a sound of voices, and this was followed on the
instant by a heavy tread in the corridor without&mdash;a tread accompanied
by the clank of armour.

<p>"We are betrayed!" cried a voice&mdash;after which, in awful silence, the
masked company stood and waited.

<p>A heavy blow smote the door and it fell open. Across the threshold, the
candlelight reflected from his corselet as from a mirror, came a mighty
figure armed <i>cap-a-pied</i>; behind him three men-at-arms, sword on thigh
and pike in hand, pressed closely.

<p>Three paces within the room the great armoured figure halted, and
surveyed the company with eyes that smiled grimly from a bearded face.

<p>"Sirs," he warned them, "resistance will be idle. I have fifty men at
hand."

<p>Bentivogli advanced with a firm step. "What is your will with us?" he
challenged, a fine arrogance in his voice.

<p>"The will of his Highness, the Duke of Valentinois," was the man's
answer, "to whom your plot is known in its every detail."

<p>"You are come to arrest us?"

<p>"One by one," said the captain, with an odd significance and a slight
inclination of the head. "My grooms await you in the courtyard."

<p>For an instant there was silence, as well might be at that
pronouncement, and Gismondi understood&mdash;as all understood&mdash;that here,
in the courtyard of this palace, those gentlemen caught red-handed were
to expiate their treason at the strangler's hands.

<p>"Infamy!" cried one, who stood beside Gismondi. "Are we, then, to have
no trial?"

<p>"In the courtyard," replied the captain grimly.

<p>"Not I, for one!" exclaimed another, and his voice was fresh and
youthful. "I am of patrician blood, and I'll not be strangled in a
corner like a capon. If die I must, I claim by right of birth the axe."

<p>"By right of birth?" the captain mused, and smiled. "In truth your very
birthright, so it seems. Come, sirs..."

<p>But others stormed, and one there was who called upon his fellows to
draw what steel they carried, and die with weapons in their hands like
men.

<p>Gismondi, apart, with folded arms, watched them, and grinned behind his
vizor. It was with him the hour of exultation, of revulsion from his
recent terrors. He wondered to what lengths of folly these rash men
would go. He thought he might witness a pretty fight; but Bentivogli
disappointed him of such expectations. He came forward to the
table-head, and his voice was raised to dominate and quell the others.

<p>"Sirs," said he, "the game is played and lost. Let us pay forfeit and
have done."

<p>What choice had they? What chance&mdash;all without body armour and few with
better weapons than a dagger&mdash;against fifty men-at-arms in steel?

<p>Again for a moment there was silence. Then one of the masked company,
with a sudden, strident, reckless laugh, stepped forward.

<p>"I'll lead the way, O my brothers," he said, and bowed to the captain.
"I am at your orders, sir."

<p>The captain made a sign to his men. Two of them laid aside their pikes
and came forward to seize that volunteer. Swiftly, and without word
spoken, they hurried him from the chamber.

<p>Gismondi smiled. This entertainment amused his cruel nature more than
had done that other of a little while ago.

<p>Again and again the men-at-arms returned; and victim after victim
was hurried out to the waiting grooms in the courtyard. One set up
a resistance as wild as it was futile; another screamed when he was
seized. But in the main they bore themselves with a calm dignity.
The soldiers went swifty about their work, and after a brief ten
minutes there remained but four of the conspirators. One of these was
Bentivogli, who as the leader reserved himself the honour of going
last; two others were the men who had been attendant upon him; the
fourth was Messer Benvenuto, who watched and waited, chuckling to think
how the name of Cesare Borgia would stink in Italy for this night's
work.

<p>The men-at-arms had re-entered and stood waiting for the next victim.
Bentivogli made a sign to Gismondi that was plain of meaning. Gismondi
shrugged, smiled to himself under cover of his mask, and stepped
forward with a swagger. But when the soldiers seized him, he shook them
impatiently aside.

<p>"A word with you, sir," said he to the captain, mighty haughty.

<p>The captain flashed him a keen glance. "Ah!" said he. "You will be he
whom I was told to look for. Tell me your name that I may know you."

<p>"I am Benvenuto Gismondi."

<p>The captain nodded thoughtfully. "I must permit myself no error here.
You are Benvenuto Gismondi, and&mdash;" He paused inquiringly.

<p>"And," Gismondi completed impatiently, "I am here on behalf of the Duke
Cesare Borgia."

<p>A quiet, wicked laugh broke from the captain's bearded lips. One of his
heavy gauntleted hands fell upon Gismondi's shoulder; the other tore
the vizor roughly from his face. Startled, understanding nothing, he
was swung round so that he faced Bentivogli.

<p>"Does your Excellency know the villain?" asked the captain.

<p>"I do not," answered Bentivogli, and added: "God be thanked!"

<p>He clapped his hands vigorously; and now it was that Benvenuto realised
into what manner of trap he was fallen, and what manner of ruse the
master-plotter had adopted to weed out, as he had promised, the one who
usurped the place of him that had been slain upon the Aemilian Way.
That clapping of hands was a summons, in answer to which there came
trooping back into the chamber the entire company of muffled plotters.
No farther than the corridor had they been taken; and on arrival
there to each one who had sustained with honour this ordeal had been
explained the test that was afoot.

<p>Betimes next morning Ramiro de Lorqua, Cesare's Governor of Cesena,
waited upon his master with a dagger and a blood-smeared scrap of paper.

<p>He had to report that the body of a man had been discovered at daybreak
on the far bank of the castle moat, by the drawbridge. The dagger that
had slain the fellow had been employed to attach to him the label which
Ramiro presented to the Duke. On this was scrawled: "The property of
Cesare Borgia."

<p>Accompanied by his governor, Cesare descended to the courtyard to view
the body. It lay there, covered by the purple, fur-trimmed cloak which
Benvenuto had worn yesterday. Ramiro turned this down to disclose the
ashen face. The Duke looked, and nodded.

<p>"It is as I thought," said he. "It is very well."

<p>"Your Highness knows him?"

<p>"A poor rogue whom I employed on a desperate venture."

<p>Ramiro&mdash;a thick-set, black-visaged, choleric man&mdash;swore roundly, as
he did upon the slightest provocation. He would see to it that the
culprits were tracked and found. Cesare shook his head, and smiled.

<p>"You will search in vain, Ramiro," he said. "Yet I can name to you the
leader of the party that is answerable for this murder; I can tell you
even that he rode out of Cesena at daybreak today, and what road he
took. But to what end? He is a fool who has performed my justice for
me, and knows it not. I fear him no more than I fear this poor carrion."

<p>"My lord, I do not understand!" said Ramiro.

<p>"Is it necessary that you should?" smiled the Duke. "My will has been
done. Understand so much, and bury me this dead&mdash;and with him the
entire affair."

<p>He turned away, to come face to face with Agabito Gherardi, who was
approaching hurriedly.

<p>"Ah, you have heard the news," Cesare greeted him. "Now behold the
face," and he pointed to the dead.

<p>Agabito looked and shrugged. "You would have it so," he said. "But you
could have taken them all."

<p>"And had all Italy calling me butcher for my pains&mdash;Venice, the
envious, Milan, the spiteful, Florence, the evil-tongue&mdash;all of them
lifting their horrid voices to the dear task of defamation. And to what
end?" He linked an arm through Agabito's, and drew the secretary away.
"That was an effective scarecrow I set up amongst them last night."
He smiled grimly. "They could not dream that the whole thing was
chance&mdash;that Benvenuto Gismondi was but a thief who had murdered this
Messer Crespi for the sake of plunder. They conceive Crespi to have
been killed, stripped and replaced in their council, all by my design.
They conclude that I have as many eyes as Argus, and the conspiracy is
as frost-bitten as your nose, Agabito. They are paralysed with fear
of me and the ubiquity of my spies. No man of those plotters counts
himself safe, and they have scattered to their several homes, all plans
abandoned since they fear the worst.

<p>"Could I improve upon the matter by hunting them down? I think not,
Agabito. Benvenuto Gismondi has served my purpose as fully as I
intended, and, incidentally, he has had justice and a fitting wage."

<hr><h2><a name="ch5"></a>5. THE SNARE</h2>

<p>MESSER BALDASSARE SCIPIONE stepped out into the lane, and closed the
green gate by which he had issued from his lady's garden.

<p>He stood a moment in the dusk of eventide, a fond smile upon his honest
rugged face; then he flung his ample scarlet cloak about him, and
departed with a jingle of spurs, erect and very martial in his bearing,
as became the captain of the Borgia forces in Urbino.

<p>At the comer, where the lane debouched into the Via del Cane, he came
suddenly upon a very splendid gentleman who was lounging there. This
gentleman's eyes narrowed at sight of the valiant captain. He was
Messer Francesco degli Omodei, cousin-german to Baldassare's lady.

<p>The captain's bearing stiffened slightly. Yet his bow was gracious as
he swept off his plumed cap in response to the other's uncovering. With
that he would have passed on had not Messer Francesco deliberately
barred his way.

<p>"Taking the air, Sir Captain?" he questioned, sneering faintly.

<p>"By your gracious pleasure&mdash;and God's," answered Baldassare, smiling
ironically into the other's unfriendly face&mdash;a swarthy young face of
a beauty almost classical, yet very sinister of eye and very cruel of
mouth.

<p>Flung out of countenance by that ironic counter, Francesco had no
answer ready, whereupon: "You are detaining me, I think," said the
captain airily, and made shift to pass on.

<p>"I will go with you, by your leave," said Francesco, and fell into step
beside the scarlet figure.

<p>"The honour notwithstanding, I should prefer to go alone," said
Baldassare.

<p>"I desire to speak to you."

<p>"So I had gathered. But I do not desire to listen. Will that weigh with
you, Messer degli Omodei?"

<p>"Not a hair's weight," laughed the other impudently.

<p>Baldassare shrugged, and stalked on, his left hand resting naturally
upon the hilt of his sword, so that the scabbard thrust up his scarlet
cloak behind.

<p>"Messer Baldassare," said Francesco presently, "you come this way too
often."

<p>"Too often for what&mdash;for whom?" quoth the captain stiffly, yet without
truculence.

<p>"Too often to please me."

<p>"Possibly. But not often enough to please myself, which, frankly now,
is my entire concern."

<p>"I do not like it," said Francesco, very surly.

<p>Baldassare smiled. "Which of us can command what he likes? Now I,
Messer Francesco&mdash;I dislike you exceedingly. Yet here I am suffering
you to walk beside me."

<p>"It is not necessary that you should."

<p>"It would not be, had you the grace to perceive that your company is
unwelcome."

<p>"There are ways of remedying such things," said the other, very
sinister now, and striking his hilt with his open palm.

<p>"For you," said Baldassare. "Not&mdash;alas!&mdash;for me. I am the commander of
the Urbino troops. It is not for me to embark upon private quarrels.
His Highness of Valentinois is impatient of disobedience to his laws.
Messer Ramires&mdash;his podesta here in Urbino&mdash;is careful to enforce them
for his own sake. I have no wish to hurt myself for the sake of hurting
you. And you, Messer Francesco, being as craven as you are sly, presume
upon this state of things to put upon me affronts which I may not
resent."

<p>He delivered the last sentence through his teeth&mdash;a very whiplash.
Under his outward calm a storm was raging in the bosom of this haughty,
fiery-tempered soldier. For this was that same Baldassare Scipione who
some years later was boldly to impugn the honour of the crown of Spain,
and throw down a gage of battle which not a Spaniard in Christendom
had the daring to take up. From that may you infer how he relished the
impertinences of this Urbinate fop.

<p>Francesco had checked suddenly, his face aflame. "You insult me!" he
said thickly.

<p>"I hope so," answered Baldassare, outwardly imperturbable.

<p>"Your insolence shall be punished."

<p>"I am glad that you see the necessity," said Baldassare, facing the
other with a smile.

<p>Francesco's frown showed how little he understood the captain.
Baldassare proceeded to explain. "If you were to draw upon me now, here
in the street, I should be constrained to defend myself. I could not
then be blamed for what might happen; there are enough people abroad
to bear witness to the true manner of the event. So proceed, I implore
you, to visit with your punishment this insolence of mine."

<p>Francesco's face had gradually lost its colour. His breathing was
quickened. A smile twisted his mouth oddly.

<p>"I see," he said. "Oh, I see. But if I should kill you, I should have
to reckon with the podesta."

<p>"Let not the consideration of my death deter you," said Baldassare,
still smiling, "for I shall see to it that it does not happen."

<p>Francesco stood a moment, scowling at the captain. Then, with a shrug
and a curse, he turned on his heel and strode away, Baldassare's soft,
mocking ripple of laughter following him.

<p>He went down the street in the deepening dusk, a fine figure of a man,
heedless of the many greetings bestowed upon him as he passed&mdash;for well
known in Urbino was Messer Francesco degli Omodei. Thus he came to the
house of his friend Amerigo Vitelli, and entered in quest of him.

<p>He found Amerigo at table, but disdained the invitation to join in the
repast.

<p>"I could not eat," he growled. "I am fed to a surfeit with Scipione's
insolence. Fed to a surfeit! I choke with it." And he flung himself
into a chair, at the table, opposite his host.

<p>Amerigo's small, pale eyes surveyed him uneasily. A young man was
this Amerigo Vitelli, of the Vitelli of Castello, and cousin to that
Vitellozzo who served with Cesare Borgia. His age would be about
Francesco's own, but nothing else had he in common with his friend. He
was of middle height&mdash;or slightly under it&mdash;of a full habit of body, a
flabbiness of flesh and a puffiness of face that told of his habitual
excesses. He was dressed in blue velvet, richly jewelled and heavily
perfumed, and he was being ministered by two comely striplings clad in
silk of his colours&mdash;blue and gold.

<p>The room in which he sat was lofty and sumptuous, and the splendour
and character of its equipment reflected the voluptuary it enshrined.
From a ceiling, on which was delicately frescoed the indelicate story
of Bacchus and Ariadne, depended a massive candle-branch of silver-gilt
charged with a dozen candles of scented wax, which shed a soft golden
light through the apartment. The walls were hung with Flemish arras,
on which were figured the erotic metamorphoses of Jupiter: his avian
courtship of Leda, his taurine wooing of Europa, his pluvial descent
upon Danae. The table was spread with snowy linen, and bore no dish of
fruits or comfits, no cup or beaker that was not a precious work of art.

<p>Behind Vitelli the windows stood open to the summer evening and the
perfumes of the garden. The roofs of Urbino formed a dark shadow-mass
in the deepening dusk, the tower of the Zoccolanti springing square and
rigid, a black silhouette against the deep turquoise and fading saffron
of the sky.

<p>One of the silk-clad pages rustled to Francesco, and set a crystal
cup before him. From a vessel of beaten gold whose handles were two
hermaphrodites carved in ivory, the boy poured an old Falernian
wine that was of the hue of bronze. Francesco gulped the half of it
so carelessly that Amerigo scowled his displeasure. Such wine was
priceless&mdash;to be inhaled with awe, and savoured sip by sip; not swilled
like so much tavern slop.

<p>Francesco, entirely unconscious that he was offending, set down his
cup, and sank back into his chair, his face black with the displeasure
that absorbed him.

<p>"What has happened to you?" quoth Amerigo presently.

<p>Francesco briefly related the tale of all this heat of his. Amerigo
listened, what time he sliced a peach into a beaker of wine and
hydromel.

<p>"You are very clumsy," he said at length. The insult to his Falernian
did not conduce to make him sympathetic.

<p>"Clumsy?" roared Francesco, sitting forward in his chair. This was the
very last drop wanting to make his cup flow over.

<p>Vitelli smiled quietly, and signed to the pages to withdraw. He waited
until they had departed and the door was closed.

<p>"Look, Francesco," said he then&mdash;he had a gentle voice and a curiously
weary sluggishness of speech that was seldom known to quicken, even in
the heat of wine. "This man Scipione stands in our way. Your foolish
dotard of an uncle, blind to worldly matters, gives his daughter too
much freedom, which she abuses with this upstart." He paused, passed
a plump, very white and jewelled hand over his sensual mouth, and his
pale eyes fixed themselves upon the bold, handsome countenance of his
guest. "There is, so far as I can see, but one course open to you. You
must&mdash;remove him."

<p>"<i>I</i> must!" sneered Francesco. "A fine lover thou, by the Host! to set
it upon me to remove the rival who struts an obstacle in your path."

<p>Amerigo smiled, entirely unruffled. "I thought," said he, "that that
was a settled matter." He took up a silver skewer, and stirred the
peach slices in the wine. "The price was agreed&mdash;the half of her dowry
shall be yours to patch a fortune that much dicing has rent to tatters.
Did I, by chance, misunderstand you?" He did not look up as he spoke.
His attention was upon his peach slices. He lifted a fragrant morsel on
the skewer and bore it to his lips.

<p>Francesco surveyed his friend in silence a moment, his brow black as a
thundercloud. "Were I a lover," he said presently, "I think the duello
should serve my ends."

<p>Amerigo shrugged contemptuously. "Madonna!" he exclaimed. "The duello!
Oh, I can be as hot as any man to resent an affront. But the duello!
God save us! A fool's practice! Because a man is noxious to me, is that
a reason why I should afford him the means to kill me? How should that
help me?"

<p>"None the less," grumbled Francesco, as if to spur the other, "did
this upstart stand between me and my desires, my rival&mdash;my successful
rival-in a woman's love, I should not let his swordsmanship deter me."

<p>"Then do not," countered Amerigo quietly. "Since the practice finds
favour with you, out with your cartel, or set a glove across his smug
face, or otherwise contrive that he may have an opportunity of driving
a hole through your belly. Out, and to it, I say, since that's your
humour."

<p>"It is not my humour," said Francesco, cooling as the other became
heated. "For I am not a lover."

<p>"Nay, you are wrong. You <i>are</i> a lover&mdash;a lover of gold, my Checco,"
said the host, lapsing again into his more habitual languor. "And what
a man, being penniless, will not do for the love of ducats, he will
not do for the love of woman. Moreover, there is your own hatred to be
served&mdash;for not a doubt but that this man has known how to excite it."

<p>"What am I to do?" quoth Francesco angrily.

<p>"Why, the thing that you advised to me." And Vitelli, having consumed
the last peach slice, drank off the blend of wine and hydromel with
relish.

<p>Francesco considered him. "You love Beatrice?" he inquired.

<p>"As I love peaches in wine; nay, even more. I love her so well that to
win her I will not risk a life which it is my aim to devote to serving
her." He smiled his supreme mockery of his friend and bondslave in this
business.

<p>Francesco rose. "If I were to die by this man's hand where would be the
advantage?"

<p>"There would be a certain advantage to you in that you would have
peace from your creditors. To me, of course, there would be no
advantage&mdash;unless they hanged this Scipione for the deed&mdash;a matter
which I greatly doubt."

<p>"You see, then, that the duello were sheer folly?"

<p>"Your wits are wandering, Franceschino. That is what I, myself, have
been urging upon your notice."

<p>"And that we must devise some other way?"

<p>"Rather that you must devise some other way. I confide the thing to you
on your own terms."

<p>Francesco smacked fist into palm. He was angry and desperate. "Ay, but
what&mdash;what?" he cried.

<p>"I depend upon the notoriously wicked fertility of your imagination,
Checco."

<p>"Oh! do not mock. Bend your mind to the solution of this riddle."

<p>"Why plague myself, when it shall profit you to solve it for me?
Sainted Virgin!" he added impatiently, "am I to pay you to do this
thing and yet do it myself?"

<p>Francesco leaned across the table, his face within a foot of his
companion's. "And if I fail you, Amerigo? What then?"

<p>"I shall consider that when you have failed me."

<p>Unreasonably exasperated, Francesco was filled by sudden hatred of
his friend, and a temptation to abandon the enterprise. But at the
timely thought of the clamouring Hebrews whose prey he was, he wisely
repressed his feelings.

<p>"You set me a very heavy task," he complained.

<p>"But I offer you a very heavy payment," the other reminded him. "The
slaying of Scipione was no part of our original bargain."

<p>"Our bargain was that you wed me to your cousin. If Scipione's death is
expedient to that end, you must contrive it."

<p>"You know that there is scarce a cut-throat to be found in Urbino these
days," Omodei protested. "The pestilent government of this Borgia
podesta has changed the face of things here, as Cesare Borgia&mdash;may he
rot in hell!&mdash;is changing the face of Italy. By the Passion! We were
promised liberty by this Duke of Valentinois. What has he given us?
A slavery the like of which, I'll swear, the world has never seen."
He moved away from the table, and paced the apartment as he talked,
rendered restless by the passion that possessed him. "He has made
children of us, here as elsewhere. No longer are we free to conduct our
lives and adjust our differences as seems best to us. We must order
ourselves at his good pleasure, and here is a podesta, who is no better
than a nurse to see that we do not break our toys. Yet Italy endures
him!"

<p>He flung arms to the ceiling, apostrophising the heaven which he
believed to lie somewhere beyond it.

<p>"A man such as this Scipione&mdash;an earthworm, a reptile&mdash;is noxious
to us. Yet, hire me a cut-throat to deal with him, and there is
the podesta and the law and a preposterous garboil, ending as like
as not in the rope&mdash;and not for the cut-throat only." Francesco's
voice rose, and he hammered out the words, beating fist into palm to
emphasise them: "Not for the cut-throat only, but for the man who hired
him to the work, be he never so high. And this&mdash;this&mdash;is liberty!
This&mdash;this&mdash;is wise government!"

<p>With an oath and a final shrug, he dropped into his chair again,
wearily, as if exhausted by his rage.

<p>Amerigo smiled calmly ever. "All this I knew. But I know not how it
shall serve you to rail and rant against this state of things. It
exists, and must be reckoned with. I depend upon your help."

<p>"I see no way in which to help you."

<p>"But you will, Checco. You will. Give it thought. You are wise and
far-seeing. I build confidently upon my faith in you. And remember that
when the thing is done and I am wed to Beatrice, your reward awaits
you."

<p>Francesco perceived at last that no help was to be expected from
Amerigo. Either the man had no invention, or&mdash;and more likely&mdash;of
set purpose he refrained from exerting it, that he should not be
incriminated in anything that followed. All he desired was Francesco's
help to marry Beatrice degli Omodei. The rest, and whatever it might
entail, was matter for Francesco; and Amerigo did not see that he
should buy the service with the half of his future wife's dowry, and
yet take such risks as might be incurred by so much as a suggestion of
his own.

<p>So Francesco realised with what manner of mean-hearted knave he had to
deal, and that in this matter he must help himself from first to last.

<p>Vainly was it that he cast about him for some way that should entail
no risk to his precious skin. The hired assassin, as he had said, was
no longer to be trusted in these days of Borgia dominion and Borgia
justice. Two weeks ago a gentleman of Urbino, a friend of Francesco's,
had employed a cut-throat to rid him of his enemy. The assassin had
been tracked, seized and tortured into betraying the hand that hired
him; with the result that Francesco's friend, though of one of the
noblest houses of Urbino, had been strangled by the common hangman.
Francesco was of no mind to suffer a like fate, however desperate his
Hebrew creditors might render him.

<p>He hit at last upon the notion of disposing of Scipione&mdash;so far as
Beatrice was concerned&mdash;without recourse to bloodshed. If he could but
stir up his uncle, old Count Omodei, into a proper sense of parental
responsibility, all might yet be well.

<p>He repaired to him on the morrow, and found him in his library amid
the treasures of learning that to him were more than daughter, family,
honour or any other worldly affair; and the white-haired old count gave
Francesco a cold welcome. He was deep in a manuscript copy of the <i>"De
Rerum Natura"</i> of Lucretius, fire-new from the printing-press&mdash;that
uncanny invention&mdash;which had been set up at Fano under the patronage of
Cesare Borgia. Naturally he resented this interruption; besides which
he had but little kindness for this splendid, profligate nephew who
burst upon him now to school him in the art of safeguarding daughters.

<p>"I have come to speak to you concerning Bice," Francesco had announced,
his tone bold to the point of truculence.

<p>The Count thrust his horn-rimmed spectacles up on to his forehead,
closed the tome upon his forefinger, and looked up.

<p>"Concerning Bice?" quoth he. "And how may Bice concern you?"

<p>"As your nephew, as an Omodei&mdash;on the score of the family honour&mdash;"

<p>The Count's brows came together. "And who made you custodian of the
family honour, sir?" quoth he with a fine sarcasm.

<p>"Nature, sir," was the hot answer, "when I was born an Omodei."

<p>"Ah, Nature!" murmured the student. "I thought it might have been your
creditors."

<p>Taken aback, Francesco flushed. This uncle of his, it seemed, did not
live so utterly out of the world as he supposed.

<p>"But you were about to say?" the Count inquired.

<p>"That Bice abuses the excessive liberty you allow her. She lacks the
discretion we look for in our maids. Her name&mdash;her fair name&mdash;is in
peril. There is a soldier of Cesare Borgia's&mdash;"

<p>"You will be meaning Baldassare Scipione," put in the Count. "Well?"

<p>Francesco stared, mouth agape. "You&mdash;you knew?" he bleated.

<p>"Pooh! You are too late by an hour," said Omodei.

<p>"Too late? Too late for what, sir?"

<p>"For whatever is your intent, if it concern Bice and her tall captain.
They are betrothed."

<p>"Betrothed?"

<p>"Why, yes," replied the Count, enjoying the other's plain discomfiture,
for no better reason than that he neither loved nor trusted his fine
nephew. "This captain of hers sought me here an hour ago upon this very
matter. A fine fellow, Checco&mdash;a fine fellow and a studious. 'Twas
he brought me this copy of Lucretius. A rare work, a precious work
on Nature and her ways. It might interest you who lay such store by
Nature."

<p>Francesco's rage blazed up. "And do you barter your daughter for a
wretched tome?" he exclaimed.

<p>"Art a fool, Francesco," said his uncle with conviction, "and Scipione
is to marry Bice. I have no more to say."

<p>"But I have, sir."

<p>"Then go say it elsewhere, in the name of all the devils. You have
interrupted me in an engrossing passage. Go say what you have to say to
your creditors. They will be glad enough to hear from you."

<p>But Francesco was of no mind to be dismissed. "What do you know of this
fellow Scipione?" he demanded.

<p>Omodei made a gesture of weariness. "What do I know of any man?" he
asked. "He is a fine soldier and a student, and when a man is both
these things he is the best things that a man can be. Add to it the
fact that he loves Bice and that Bice loves him&mdash;and so, God give them
joy of each other."

<p>"Ha!" laughed Francesco mirthlessly. "Ha! Ha! But who is he, whence is
he? And what&mdash;what of his family?"

<p>The question was prompted by despair, and even as he asked it,
Francesco felt its weakness and futility. A plea of "family" was rarely
urged on any count by the cinquecentist. Family&mdash;a toy which was new
to the rest of Europe&mdash;had long since ceased to interest the average
Italian of the cinquecento, who recognised in man no worth that was not
personal to himself.

<p>Add to this the consideration that the count had been reading
Lucretius, and you will appreciate the contemptuous sniff with which he
met the question.

<p>"If you read Lucretius, Francesco, you would think less of family,"
said he.

<p>"But I do not read Lucretius," answered Francesco, desperately pursuing
his weak contention, "and the world does not read Lucretius, and so&mdash;"

<p>"If you read Lucretius you would think less of the world."

<p>"But I do not read him," the young man insisted.

<p>"If you did, you would understand why I find him more interesting than
yourself. So go with God, Francesco, and leave me to my old scholar."

<p>Francesco went, discomfited. He was sick with despair and rage. He
thought of seeking Amerigo again. But knew it idle. He had come to the
end of peaceful propositions. To sever the relations between Madonna
Bice and this Borgia adventurer, to open a way for Amerigo, and thus
serve his own interests, only cold steel remained. He turned pale at
the mere thought of it. He dared not procure assassination. He was of
a keen and vivid imagination which might have served him well had he
but had the industry to employ it to good purpose. This imagination now
chilled him, causing him to feel the strangler's rope already about his
wind-pipe.

<p>So he resolved at length upon the duello. He would so affront the
captain as to leave him no choice but to issue his cartel, and if he
killed Scipione in the encounter no blame could attach to one who was
not the challenger. But if the captain killed him? It was a risk he
must envisage, and either way, he reflected bitterly, his creditors
should be appeased.

<p>But it came to pass that late that night, as he still sat brooding upon
the matter, he bethought him of something he had once read in a book
of Lorenzo Valla's. Though no student by disposition, he found much in
Valla to interest him, and he had a copy of that writer's works at hand.

<p>He sought the volume in a painted coffer that stood in his chamber, and
turned to the page that he had in mind&mdash;the indictment of homicide and
the justifications that may exist for it.

<p>Thus had Valla written:

<p class="newspaper">There is the instance, which many yet remember, of Messer Rinaldo of
Palmero, a gentleman of Tuscany, who, hearing voices in his sister's
chamber late one night, did enter there to discover her in the arms of
her lover, one Messer Lizio d'Asti. And Ser Rinaldo, blinded by just
choler at the sight, unsheathed his iron and slew them both, that their
blood might purify his house of that dishonour. And Ser Rinaldo was by
the State commended and honoured for the deed.<br>
<br>
Such homicide has ever been, from the most ancient times, and must ever
be accounted just and justified. It is the inviolable right of every
male to slay whomsoever hold too lightly the honour of his female kin,
provided that he take the offender <i>in flagrante</i>.

<p>Francesco set the volume down, and remained long bemused. <i>"In
flagrante"</i> said the learned Valla. That was the difficulty; and
without that circumstance the slaying upon such grounds was fraught
with danger, for the slayer must make good by proofs his accusation.

<p>If he could but contrive to lure Scipione to her house at dead
midnight, and there, taking him unawares, speed a dagger through his
heart, who would dare blame him? Though not her brother, yet Francesco
stood near enough to Beatrice in kinship to claim the right to guard
the honour of the Omodei.

<p>But how&mdash;how draw Scipione to the snare?

<p>And then the means flashed into his subtle, wicked brain. He saw a way!
A monstrous, appalling plan took shape. But he never hesitated to adopt
it, since it solved his problem.

<p>He rose, an oath of satisfaction ringing through the laughter that
bubbled on his lips.

<p>Francesco's plan stood the test of the morning's reflection. Now that
he had slept upon it, it pleased him even better than when it had first
occurred to him. He discovered in it as many facets as a diamond, and
each one as clear and brilliant as the rest.

<p>Nothing that he could have devised could have equalled this for
completeness. Borgia justice&mdash;being justice, after all&mdash;must accept the
deed and must commend it. No suspicion could attach to his motives; not
even though it could be shown that he had entertained a private malice
for Scipione. Scipione's presence in Madonna Beatrice's chamber should
be a sufficient answer to every question that suspicion could prompt or
ingenuity devise.

<p>His first impulse&mdash;an impulse of sheer vanity, while the hot glow of
pride in his invention was upon him&mdash;was to seek Amerigo, dazzle him
with the announcement of the amazing scheme which for his benefit he
had devised. But the very vanity which prompted this, prompted upon
further reflection that he should wait. First let him accomplish
his design; and then announce to Amerigo not a mere plan but an
achievement. How Amerigo would stare! How lost in wonder must he not be
at Francesco's fertile wit!

<p>So he matured his cruel plans, down to the minutest detail, keeping
the house that day and until the second hour of night had struck. Then
he called for his hat and cloak, his sword and dagger, and went forth
attended by a groom to light him on his way.

<p>He came to the door in the garden wall from which we saw Scipione
emerge on the evening before last. He tried it, to find it latched on
the inside; and the wall was fully ten feet high. So he bade his lackey
quench his torch, and that being done he ordered the man to stand
against the wall, what time Francesco used him as a ladder and mounted
upon his shoulders. Standing erect he was able to throw an arm over the
wall's summit. Active and sinewy, he was astride of it a moment later.
Then he lowered himself to his full length on the inner side, and so
dropped gently upon a bed of yielding mould.

<p>Next, he admitted his servant, and bidding the man follow, went forward
through the leafy gloom of that scented place.

<p>He took his way through the familiar alleys, and the beacon by which
he steered his course was a light gleaming from one of the windows of
the mezzanine. It was the window of a room which, he knew, Beatrice
affected&mdash;a sort of anteroom to her bedchamber&mdash;and it opened doorwise
upon a wide balcony of granite, whence a flight of some twenty steps,
guarded by a balustrade that was smothered in a luxuriance of ivy, ran
down into the garden.

<p>At the foot of this staircase Francesco halted to consider the face of
the house. Save for that window, all was darkness, which meant that the
household was by now abed. True he could not see the windows of the
library, which faced the street. It was likely enough that his uncle
would be at one of his studious vigils. But then his uncle was not
lightly disturbed, and Francesco did not intend to make himself heard
until his plan had reached fulfilment.

<p>Bidding his groom await him there he went up that granite staircase
to the balcony with noisy foot and clank of scabbard to herald his
approach. And ere he was midway the lighted space above was widened as
the curtains were flung quickly aside. The glass doors stood open, and
a figure, black against the light, appeared under the lintel.

<p>"Who comes?" he heard his cousin's voice.

<p>"It is I, Bice," he answered promptly, and made his voice quiver, as
if he were a prey to excitement. "I&mdash;Francesco." And as he gained the
balcony and stood level with her: "Is your father with you?" he asked
breathlessly, and added, "I come with news."

<p>She drew back and aside to give him entrance. She eyed him in
astonishment&mdash;a slender slip of womanhood, with the black hair and pale
skin that was common to the Omodei.

<p>"An odd hour this for visiting," said she. "My father is at his
studies. I will fetch him."

<p>"Did I not say that I bring news, Bice?" he cried, and the quiver in
his voice became more marked. "Let your father have peace. My news
concerns yourself."

<p>"Me?" Her soft eyes regarded him with some mistrust. She knew her
cousin's fame for shiftiness and guile. Her very father had schooled
her in that knowledge.

<p>"Ay, you," he answered, and flung, exhausted, into the nearest chair,
breathing noisily and fanning himself with his velvet cap. "I&mdash;I have
run at least a mile, to bring you word&mdash;in time," he gasped.

<p>His well-played fatigue, his distraught air, were awakening her alarm.
She blenched as she regarded him from where she stood by the window
door, one slender arm uplifted, the hand grasping the curtain's edge
above her head. She was all in white, in a loose robe that was open at
the neck, and caught at the waist in a girdle of hammered gold with a
turquoise clasp. Her ebony hair hung behind her in two heavy plaited
ropes, dressed so for the night.

<p>All was as it should be, opined Messer Francesco with satisfaction.
He had judged his moment as he judged all things, he reflected
complacently, with a judgment that was unerring.

<p>She stared at him, her eyes dilating, dark glistening pools in the
white beauty of her face, and held her breath what time she awaited his
explanation.

<p>But instead of explaining he continued to play upon her fears and to
strain them to the very verge of breaking point.

<p>"A cup of wine!" he panted. "A draught of water! To drink&mdash;Gesu! give
me to drink!"

<p>At last she stirred. She moved to a diminutive press of brown walnut
carved with podgy cupids, that stood in a corner of that very choicely
appointed chamber and into a dainty thin-stemmed beaker poured him a
draught of Puglia.

<p>"Whence do you come?" she asked, impatient for his news, and infected
by some of his excitement.

<p>"No matter whence I come," said he, taking the cup from her hands. "It
is my news that matters." And avidly he gulped the wine, what time she
watched him, wondering and uneasy.

<p>"It concerns Messer Baldassare Scipione," he enlightened her, and saw
her sudden start.

<p>"What&mdash;what of him?"

<p>His eyes narrowed now as they pondered her. "I know you and him to be
betrothed," he explained. "Your father told me of it but yesterday.
Hence my anxiety, my haste to bring you word of this thing that is to
do." And like a thunderbolt he launched his lying message: "There is a
plot to murder Captain Scipione this night."

<p>"Gesu Maria!" she gasped, and clutched her breast, the last remnant
of her mistrust of her cousin whelmed in sudden terror for her lover.
Her eyes were wild, her face livid, her bosom heaved convulsively; she
looked as she would faint.

<p>"Nay, nay, courage, Bice! Courage!" he admonished her. "There is still
time to save him&mdash;else had I not been here."

<p>She made an effort to control her fears; to put them by, and summon
reason to her aid. "Put why&mdash;why have you lost time in seeking me? Why
did you not instantly bear your story to the podesta?" she questioned.

<p>"To him? To Ramires?" He laughed softly and with infinite scorn.
"Because the magistrate himself is in this business."

<p>"Ramires!" she cried. "Oh, impossible!"

<p>"Ah, wait." His tone was a thought impatient as he proceeded to offer
an explanation that should render credible his bold lie. "Men who stand
high in their master's favour, as does Scipione in Cesare Borgia's,
are seldom loved by their fellow-servants. Ramires fears that Scipione
may supplant him. Envy and jealousy are scorpion-whips to drive such
men as the Podesta Ramires. They have urged him to ally himself with
Scipione's other enemies, and so, tonight, the thing is to be done."

<p>It seemed incredible. Doubts of its truth recurring, instinctive
mistrust of her cousin flickered anew in Beatrice's mind. But she cast
them out, bethinking her that did she heed them and were she in error,
her lover's life might pay the price of these same doubts. Yet they
insisted and demanded satisfaction.

<p>She controlled her fears, and eyed her cousin, as if to pierce to the
very soul and brain of him.

<p>"Here is a very sudden and strange concern, Francesco, for a man you
never loved. It would seem more natural to me to find you linked with
his enemies than have you come here to warn me."

<p>He stared at her for a moment, as if dumbfounded&mdash;as indeed he was.
Then he rose with an angry stamp of exasperation.

<p>"God give me patience!" he exclaimed. "Here's woman's logic&mdash;woman's
way! You'll stand in talk and seek to plumb my motives while they cut
your lover's throat. By the Host! girl, I may not have loved this
fellow of your choice. But must it follow that I wish his death?"

<p>"Yet, so much emotion for a man you do not love&mdash;"

<p>"Hear her, O Virgin!" quoth he, and turned upon her in a blazing heat
of impatience. "Is my emotion for him, do you say? Bah!" He snapped
finger against thumb. "Let them slit his throat and be done with it,
for aught I care. My concern, my emotion, is for you. Shall I see you
widowed or ever you are wed? Have I no right to a concern on your
behalf, Bice? But there, I see you do not trust me; and, as God lives,
I know not why I should serve you, that being so."

<p>With a gesture expressing injury and anger he pulled his cloak about
him, and strode to the window. But now terror, like a hurricane, swept
her after him, to clutch his arm, and to detain him.

<p>"Nay, Franceschino, wait! I was wrong&mdash;so wrong!"

<p>He paused, looking down, ruffled, yet long-suffering.

<p>"Can you serve me?" she asked him breathlessly. "Is there aught you can
do to save him?"

<p>"For that purpose have I sought you," he answered, with a great
dignity. "They do not strike till midnight."

<p>"Midnight!" she gasped. "It wants but an hour."

<p>"Time and to spare for what you have to do."

<p>"I? What is there I can do? What power have I?" She was pleading
piteously through such questions.

<p>"The power to subtract him from his enemies before they are upon him;
to get him away from his house in the Zoccolanti. Bring him here to
your side, and keep him here till morning&mdash;till the danger is overpast.
Then he can call his men to arms, and take measures for his safety."

<p>She recoiled, staring at him between wonder and horror. "Keep him
here&mdash;here? And till morning? Are you mad, Francesco?"

<p>He pondered her, did this very subtle gentleman, with positive
contempt. "Is this your love for him?" he asked. "At every step you
raise an obstacle. And why not here? You're soon to be his wife."

<p>A crimson flush spread slowly on her face, and was gone, leaving her
paler than she had been. "Francesco," said she, in a voice that was
forcedly calm, "if you desire to serve me and to save me the life of
Baldassare, you may do it without putting this shame upon me. Go to
him. Warn him of his peril, and bear him home with you to your own
house, there to abide till morning. Go&mdash;and send me word when it is
done. I shall not sleep until I hear from you."

<p>He stood surveying her, and his expression melted from contempt to
pity; a faint smile appeared at the comers of his tight-lipped, cruel
mouth.

<p>"You try my patience very sorely&mdash;by the Host you do!" said he. "I
wonder what this captain finds to love in such a fool!" Then in a
sudden heat he went on: "Why, every ninny sees a demi-god in the lout
who quivers at her touch. Yet you&mdash;you&mdash;say you love this man; you
believe you love him, and yet you hold him in such base esteem that you
can picture him fleeing in terror to take hiding in my house at a word
of peril that I may speak to him. Is that your conception of Baldassare
Scipione?" he demanded with scathing scorn. "Do you account the man you
love so poor-spirited a cur? Why, girl, it is odds he would not believe
me; and if he did, he would scorn my offer and stay to have his throat
cut for his honour's sake. Such, at least, is the Baldassare Scipione
whom I know&mdash;I, who do not love him."

<p>It was all most subtly thought of, and it sank deep into Beatrice's
mind, and there took root. How could she doubt the truth of an argument
that revealed her lover as a hero of romance? What woman could resist
the flattery of so conceiving the man she loved? Conviction overwhelmed
her. Then a fresh doubt leapt up, but of another sort.

<p>"But&mdash;but if this be so&mdash;how can I hope to lure him from his danger?"

<p>"By not allowing him to perceive it," he answered promptly.

<p>"How, then&mdash;" she stared at him, utterly at a loss.

<p>He smiled, reassuringly and faintly mocking, a smile that seemed to ask
what should she do without his guidance.

<p>"I have thought of it all," he said. "You will represent the danger as
threatening you&mdash;not him. You will write him three lines to say you are
in grave peril and in urgent need of him, bidding him come to you upon
the instant. Such a call as that he will not refuse. He will come&mdash;Mars
borne upon the wings of Eros."

<p>"That were to lie to him," said she.

<p>"Oh, give me patience!" he cried again. "It is no lie. You <i>are</i> in
danger&mdash;in danger of going mad, in danger of dying of a broken heart
when they bring you word of how he perished. So bid him come," he urged
her sharply, "and bid him come by the garden and that staircase. Thus
he will be less in danger of being seen."

<p>That hint of secrecy revived her erstwhile scruples. She stood now by
the table, which was strewn with a half-wrought embroidery and the
coloured silks that had been her materials, and she confessed her
horror in her glance.

<p>"I can't, I can't!" she wailed. "How can I, Francesco? To keep him
here&mdash;here!" And shivering as she spoke, she covered her crimsoning
face.

<p>Francesco snorted. "Would you prefer that his enemies prevail?" he
asked her fiercely. "Shall Baldassare Scipione be so much carrion
tomorrow?" He leaned towards her, urging eagerly: "Come, come! Is this
an hour for scruples. Its sands are running down. Soon it will be too
late. As for your fair name&mdash;tush! your fears are idle. I will remain
with you. Or, if that suffice not to quiet your scruples, your father
shall be summoned to join us in this vigil."

<p>Her face cleared. "Then all is plain. Why did you not say this
earlier?" And yet she hesitated, and knit her brows whilst he fetched
writing materials from the press, and thrust aside the embroidery on
the table, clearing a space, that she might write. "How shall we keep
him, once he comes and finds there is no danger for me?"

<p>"Write!" he snapped. "I have thought of everything. Come, come, or
he'll be butchered whilst you are asking questions."

<p>Conquered at last, she sat down and wrote furiously:

<p class="letter">MY BALDASSARE,&mdash;I am in danger, and in urgent need of you. Come to
me instantly. The garden door is unlatched; come by the steps to my
chamber.<br>
<br>
BEATRICE.

<p>She folded the note, tied it with some threads of crimson silk, and
gave it to him. Her heart was beating as it would stifle her.

<p>"You are sure that we shall be in time?" said she.

<p>"No doubt," he reassured her, "though you've wasted a deal of it."

<p>He stepped to the window, and whistled softly. At the same time, she
moved in the opposite direction to the door.

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked sharply.

<p>"To call my father," she answered, her hand upon the latch. "Wait!" He
was so impressive, and mysterious that she obeyed him, and came slowly
back to the table.

<p>Steps pattered on the stone staircase. His groom appeared on the
balcony. Francesco tossed the note to him.

<p>"That to the Illustrious Captain Scipione at once, and make all haste,"
he ordered.

<p>The man's steps pattered down again and through the garden at a run.
Francesco came slowly back into the room, his face a shade paler than
it had been, his manner restless, his eyes furtive.

<p>"Your servants will be abed?" he asked, as if in idleness.

<p>"Why, yes," she answered. "But I will rouse them when I call my father."

<p>"It was fortunate for me&mdash;more fortunate still for your fine
captain&mdash;that you, at least, had not retired before I came. Will you
not sit?" And he advanced a chair. "There is something I wish to tell
you ere you rouse the house."

<p>She sat, he standing behind the chair he had proffered. From under his
cloak he drew a coil of slender rope, noosed with a running knot, all
ready for his purpose. Quick as lightning he slipped the loop over her
head, and down so that it encompassed her arms and body and the chair's
tall back. He drew it tight almost in the same movement, and then, as
alarmed she parted her lips to cry out, he clapped one hand to her
mouth, whilst with the other he fumbled for the gag he had brought.

<p>When all was done, and gagged and with a second cord lashing her ankles
to the chair, she sat helpless and mute before him, a wild terror
staring from her dark eyes, he surveyed her, smiling, well pleased with
the swift adroitness wherewith he had performed his task. He crossed to
the door, and locked it. Then he drew the heavy crimson curtains across
the windows, and that done he sat down, flung one silken leg over the
other, and surveyed her with a smile of gentle mockery.

<p>"I am more distressed than I can say, to have been compelled to
submit you to this rough usage and this discomfort. Necessity is my
task-master. I will not have your father or your servants disturbed
just yet. Presently I, myself, will call them. Meanwhile, dear Bice,
dispel your personal alarms, for I swear to you that you shall suffer
no hurt; that what I have done, I have done but as a temporary
restraint."

<p>And now he proceeded to explain. "You are to understand, dear cousin,
that when I told you that there is a plot afoot to murder your fine
captain, I told you not a word more than the truth. Too often has he
presumed to affront me, sheltered like a coward behind the shield of
Borgia justice, which would have strangled me had I slain him&mdash;though
honourably&mdash;in the duello. But he was a fool for all his pains, for he
might have known that Francesco degli Omodei was not the man to leave
unavenged the insults of an upstart condottiero. Tonight he pays his
score."

<p>In loyalty to his friend Vitelli&mdash;his paymaster in this foul
business&mdash;Francesco made no mention of his name. Besides his loyalty,
he had to consider that for the fruition of his schemes Amerigo must
ultimately wed Beatrice. To that end this business was but the means.
Therefore Amerigo must nowise be associated here with Messer Francesco.

<p>"Are you wondering," he resumed, "why I have chosen such a place and
hour in which to do this thing? You shall learn, sweet cousin, lest you
should suffer through concern for my safety when it is done.

<p>"When this fool Scipione, hastening hither all on fire with love and
rage and valour, shall cross that threshold, then he dies. Here in your
chamber shall he breathe his last. What greater blessing could he ask
of Fate? Such happiness is not given to every lover, though many sigh
for it&mdash;in their verses.

<p>"Do not suppose that when the thing is done I shall become a fugitive
from justice." He smiled infernally, for he was cruel to the core of
him. "In that hour I shall call your father, loose your bonds and rouse
the house&mdash;all Urbino will I rouse, and myself, fetch the podesta to
hear the tale of how, surprising your Captain Scipione here in your
arms at dead midnight, I slew him for the honour of the Omodei.

<p>"You think, perhaps, that you will deny my story? And so, no doubt, you
will. But consider now," he mocked her, "who is there will believe you?
You dream perhaps that my servant will tell of the note he bore at my
bidding. Build not upon that. My servant I can trust for silence."

<p>Her eyes flashed him mute hatred from out of her livid face. But
Francesco was nothing daunted, nothing moved. Rather did her dumb agony
spur him to further derisive explanation.

<p>"Urbino shall acclaim me for this night's work," said he. "I may even
come to figure in song and story for future ages to admire me."

<p>Thereafter there was a spell of silence, and the cousins sat awaiting
the coming of Beatrice's lover; she in a torture of fear, in a sickness
of remorse for having given so little heed to the warnings of her
intuition against this man of whose life she had never known a single
deed of good.

<p>He sat uneasy now, fearful of interruption. It was approaching
midnight; the old scholar above stairs might bethink him to seek his
bed, and ere he went might come to see that all was well with his
daughter. Francesco's fears grew with every beat of his pulses. He sat
livid, fretful, gnawing at his nails, his ears straining, his nerves
starting at every creak that broke the midnight stillness.

<p>Yet were his fears all idle. The old count in his library had fallen
soundly asleep over the fourth book of the <i>"De Rerum Natura."</i>

<p>Meanwhile, Francesco's servant, a lank, loose-limbed fellow, whose
name&mdash;for what it matters&mdash;was Gasparo, sped swiftly towards the
Zoccolanti and the house of Scipione, on the errand that was to fetch
the victim to the springe so cunningly prepared.

<p>Had Messer Amerigo Vitelli but known of it, all had been well&mdash;from
the monstrous point of view of nimble-witted Franceschino. But Messer
Amerigo did not know, and thence it was to ensue that Francesco was to
pay for the vanity that had bound him to silence until the thing should
be accomplished.

<p>It came about by one of those coincidences, which, meeting us at every
step and weaving themselves into the warp of our intentions, alter,
modify and set a pattern upon the fabric we call Life.

<p>Messer Amerigo had been supping at the house of one Nomaglie, whose
banquets outrivalled any that Lucullus ever spread. He was rolling
home, flushed spiritually, and materially fired by a Vesuvian wine
which he had grossly abused and some of whose sulphur had got into his
veins and made him ripe for any devilry. With him came some half-score
merry gentlemen of Urbino, entirely of Amerigo's kidney and similarly
charged with Nomaglie's volcanic brew. The noisy party was flanked
by four stalwart lackeys, bearing torches, and preceded by a boy in
cloth-of-gold wearing a gilded mask in the form of a calf's head&mdash;the
emblem of the Vitelli&mdash;and thrumming a lute.

<p>Into this company blundered our friend Gasparo, to find his way
blocked; for the noisy troop sprawled itself from wall to wall across
the narrow street.

<p>The servant flattened himself in a doorway to give passage to them. But
they were by no means minded to give passage in their turn to him or
any other whom at that hour they might chance to meet.

<p>"Now, who may this be?" quoth Amerigo, in his sweet, mincing voice, his
tongue stumbling over the consonants. "And why does he lurk there like
a spy?" He stopped, and the procession halted with him&mdash;the master of
these revels. "Hale him forth," he commanded.

<p>Gasparo was instantly charged by the foremost roysterers, seized, and
dragged, exceedingly scared, into mid-street before Amerigo. The latter
struck a judicial attitude, its dignity a trifle marred by the leaning
of his pink cap over his left eye. His podgy figure was gorgeous in
rosy silk, with a line of diamond buttons running down the middle of
his doublet; his hose was striped pink and white, vertically from foot
to knee, horizontally thence to his trunks. He looked extremely absurd.

<p>"So, rogue," he roared, "explain this night-walking."

<p>"I&mdash;I am Gasparo, sir," pleaded the lackey, nor thought to explain that
he was the servant of Francesco degli Omodei, conceiving in his vanity
that he was as well known to Messer Amerigo as was Messer Amerigo to
him.

<p>"Oho!" crowed Vitelli. "You are Gasparo, eh?" And to the company
he imparted with drunken owlishness the solemn information. "He is
Gasparo. Mark that well, sirs. He is Gasparo."

<p>And the revellers responded by linking arms and dancing furiously about
the lackey and his interlocutor in a circle, howling to the renewed
thrumming of the lute:

<p class="poem">"He is Gasparo&mdash;paro&mdash;paro!<br>
He is Gasparo&mdash;paro&mdash;puh!"

<p>This gibbering, swirling human vortex frightened the poor groom out of
the little sense he had received from stingy Nature. Already he foresaw
an ugly ending to this frolic, imagined grim horrors to which this
demoniac mummery was but the prologue.

<p>Amerigo took him by the arm, and drew him close. "We are detaining you,
you say?" quoth he. "Of course we are detaining you. You will abstain
from fatuous observations of that sort. We cannot endure them. This,
sir, is a company of wits."

<p>Upon that word of his the lute thrummed again, the circular dance was
resumed, the page in the golden calf's head improvised, and the others
howled the chorus:

<p class="poem">"Oh, Gasparo&mdash;paro&mdash;paro!<br>
Oh, most fortunate of cits!<br>
Oh, Gasparo&mdash;paro&mdash;paro!<br>
You are fallen among wits!"

<p>Round and round went the idiotic, howling, drunken crew, a swirl
of many coloured legs, a rainbow of fluttering cloaks, weird,
phantasmagoric, and&mdash;to Gasparo&mdash;wholly terrific as seen in the ruddy,
fitful glare of the torches.

<p>"You are expected, eh, Gasparo?" quoth Amerigo, when presently the
dancers paused.

<p>"Indeed, I am, sir. Let me go; let me go, I beg, Magnificent," implored
the lout.

<p>"He's expected," said Amerigo to the company, very solemnly and a
trifle thickly. "This laggard lover is expected, and he wastes his time
here with a parcel of drunken, bawdy midnight brawlers. Shame on thee,
Gasparo." Then in Gasparo's ear, but loud enough for all to hear him:
"Where does she live now, and what's her name? Is she tall or short,
fat or lean, black or golden? Descant, man! Propound her virtues of the
spirit and the flesh, that we decide if you shall keep this tryst. I am
Amerigo Vitelli, the <i>arbiter foeminae</i> of Italy. You may have heard of
me. So descant freely&mdash;as to a judge."

<p>And now Gasparo saw light of a sudden in his trouble. He had but to
mention the name of the man to whom he bore his message, and there
would be an end to this baiting.

<p>"You mistake, Messer Amerigo," said he. "You mistake, Magnificent. I am
expected by the Captain Baldassare Scipione at his house yonder. I beg
that you'll suffer me to go."

<p>The leer faded slowly from Amerigo's flushed and puffy face. Some of
the drunken vacuity departed from his eye, and the company, either
noting or feeling the change, fell silent. Gasparo felt it too. It was
as if a chill wind had blown suddenly upon him.

<p>"What are you to Messer Scipione?" asked Amerigo, his voice now harsh.
He was grown wicked of a sudden, and from mischievously ape-drunk that
he had been, he was turned lion-drunk at the mention of his successful
rival. His mood was now to roar and rend.

<p>Scared back into the tremors from which he had been daring to emerge,
Gasparo stammered, "I&mdash;I have a letter, Magnificent, for the captain."

<p>Had the fool but said from whom he came instead of to whom he went,
all might have been well. But, because he imagined himself known to
Vitelli, he did not.

<p>The mere mention of the letter filled Amerigo with suspicious jealousy,
which in his drunken state craved satisfaction. Harshly he demanded its
production. The lackey whimpered that he dared not obey; implored them
anew to let him go; for he had the scent of danger breast-high by now.

<p>Amerigo in his new mood was very short with him. "The letter!" he
snarled. And then to his friends, with a wave of a fat white hand:
"Obtain it me!" he commanded.

<p>They were like hounds unleashed upon a quarry, in their eagerness for
the frolic that obeying him entailed. Four of them pounced upon the
unfortunate Gasparo. In the twinkling of an eye the doublet was gone
from his back, ripped into four pieces; his vest followed it, similarly
quartered, and lastly, his very shirt. The rent garments were flung to
others to be searched.

<p>A dagger was inserted at Gasparo's waistband, and his trunks were
swiftly slashed away, he never daring to move, lest the dagger's other
edge should scrape acquaintance with his flesh.

<p>Within five seconds of their laying hands upon him, Gasparo stood as
naked as upon the occasion of his first appearance in this vale of
sorrow, and in Amerigo's hands was the letter which his doublet had
yielded. The completion of their work of denudation had been mere
wantonness.

<p>Reckless of any consequences, Amerigo broke the threads which bound the
missive, and called for light. A torch was advanced. Vitelli read, and
his face grew black with rage, then lighted again with inspiration.
If Beatrice was in danger, as the letter said, was not he, himself,
the very man to fly to her assistance. If not, if the letter were...
He checked on the notion, scowling again in an effort of thought. The
blundering servant had said, he remembered, that he was expected by the
captain. Then this letter... Again he checked, and very softly licked
his lips and smiled.

<p>Meanwhile the Saturnalian dance about Gasparo was resumed. The lute
throbbed, and the boy improvised, whilst the others thundered after
him, and awakened the street from end to end.

<p class="poem">"He's as rosy as a cupid,<br>
This Gasparo&mdash;paro&mdash;paro;<br>
And his legs are sweetly crooked,<br>
Oh, Gasparo&mdash;paro&mdash;puh!"

<p>Amerigo broke through the ring. "Away, away!" he cried. Then beckoned
a torchbearer. "Attend me, you," he commanded. "Gay people, a happy
night! Seek your sport elsewhere. My game's afoot! Good night! Most
happy night!"

<p>And he was gone, stumbling and lurching down the street, at once
lighted and supported by his torchbearer.

<p>They watched his departure in a sudden silence of surprise; then vainly
shouted to him to return.

<p>"This will end badly," muttered one. "He is overdrunk to be let go."

<p>"Why, then, after him!" put in another.

<p>The procession formed up once more, the golden boy placed himself at
the head, and so led them away down the street, thrumming his lute, and
improvising fresh verses on the subject of Gasparo.

<p>The lackey, shivering and whimpering in a doorway, watched their
departure. Then he crept forth, and picking up the poor remains of
his garments, disguised his nakedness as best he could in them. In a
fury, fiercely hoping for vengeance, he went off resolutely to thunder
on Messer Baldassare Scipione's door, to inform the captain of what
had taken place, and of how he had been robbed of a letter from Monna
Beatrice degli Omodei, which he had been bidden bring with all dispatch.

<p>The captain listened patiently, questioned fruitlessly, swore fiercely,
called for sword and hat, dispatched Gasparo to rouse the podesta, and
himself set out at a run for the house of Omodei.

<p>In Madonna Beatrice's chamber sat the cousins waiting. The man consumed
by his impatience and his fears of an interruption at the eleventh
hour; the girl in frozen terror, with thudding heart and heaving
bosom; desperately sustained from fainting by the imperative necessity
to witness whatever might come to pass; fostering&mdash;and yet afraid to
foster&mdash;the hope that Francesco's diabolical plans should yet miscarry.

<p>Abruptly and silently Francesco came to his feet, with head slightly
inclined, listening intently. He smiled cruelly. The game was won.

<p>"Your lover comes, Beatrice," he announced, very softly.

<p>His ears had caught the distant creak of rusty hinges, and so had hers.
Her heart worked ponderously, a sickness oppressed her, and rolling
noises were booming in her ears; and yet, knowing that she dared
not sink into the merciful unconsciousness stealing over her like a
slumber, she shook it off, and by a sheer effort of will regained her
self-control.

<p>Francesco softly crossed to her, and plucked away the gag.

<p>"Scream now, if it will comfort you," said he. And she, knowing that to
cry out would but serve to hasten her lover to his doom, was silent.

<p>Her cousin drew away, and went to take his stand by the heavy curtains,
a fine, tall figure, brave in grey and gold. He crouched a little,
balanced for the spring, his long dagger gleaming in his hand.

<p>To the ears of the twain, strained now and super-sensitive, came
a snapping of twigs in the garden below. The lover approached in
reckless, headlong haste. At last his step was on the staircase&mdash;the
step of one whose foot is softly clad&mdash;mounting swiftly to the balcony.

<p>Francesco, pale and something breathless, with furrowed brow and
dilated nostrils, moved neither limb nor eye as he waited at his post.
Had he but done so&mdash;had he but chanced to look at Beatrice in that
moment he would have seen in her face that which would have given him
pause.

<p>She sat there in her bonds, her head thrust forward, her lips parted,
her eyes wide. And though fear sprawled lividly across the winsome
beauty of her face, yet there was something else&mdash;a certain surprise
and even some relief. For Beatrice knew that the man who was climbing
the staircase to meet Francesco's dagger was not her lover. In that
moment, as she listened to those approaching steps, she lived but in
her hearing, which had absorbed into itself the entire sentiency of her
being.

<p>Even Francesco should have known that this soft-shod, stealthy, yet
uncertain footstep was not Scipione's. To herald the captain's approach
there had been a firmer tread, the clink of spurs, perhaps the clank of
sword.

<p>His reason should have warned him of the thing which she had learned
entirely without reasoning. But like herself, he, too, had whittled all
his faculties into one sharp point, and was intent but upon that.

<p>She would have cried out had she bethought her that hers was the
power of utterance. She would have stayed Francesco's hand; for she
knew not into what breast his dagger was about to plunge. But her
brain was numb to all save three mighty facts which absorbed her
consciousness&mdash;knowledge, surprise and infinite relief that this was
not Baldassare.

<p>The steps pattered across the balcony, and the crimson curtains bellied
inwards. And in that same moment, Francesco struck; once, twice,
thrice, in quick succession his poniard rose and descended through the
thick velvet of the curtains into the body of the man beyond.

<p>There came a muffled cry, a cough, a gurgling groan, and with them a
frantic agitation of the curtains that told of clutching for support.
Then the rod snapped above, a man hurtled forward, tripped by the
draperies he had torn from their hangings and enveloped by them.
Swathed in them as in a winding-sheet, he rolled at their feet, a
crimson velvet bundle from which protruded two legs in pink and white
silk that kicked convulsively, and then were stiff and still.

<p>Francesco, breathing noisily in his excitement, stepped briskly across
that writhing heap to cut the cords that bound Beatrice. He whipped
them quickly away, and flung them behind the press.

<p>Limp, now that the bonds supported her no longer, she huddled, half
swooning in the chair. But Francesco had no time to think of her.
Steps sounded in the passage, someone tried the door, then rapped
impatiently, and his uncle's voice called Beatrice.

<p>Francesco dashed the sweat from his clammy brow, strode briskly to the
door, turned the key, and flung it wide.

<p>On the threshold he came face to face with his white-haired uncle,
candle in one hand, the inevitable book closed upon his forefinger in
the other.

<p>"Francesco!" he exclaimed, and frowned between anger and amazement.
"What make you here at such an hour? And what is happening? Why was
that door locked?"

<p>Francesco, miraculously self-controlled by now, his face a mask of
sorrowing concern, drew his uncle by the arm into the chamber, and
closed the door.

<p>The old man's eye caught that ominous red bundle on the floor, and he
started forward, and perceived the absurd plump legs in their pink
and white stockings. Then he looked at his daughter, who sat livid,
dull-eyed, and no longer more than half conscious. Lastly he turned his
blank, scared face upon his nephew.

<p>"What does it mean?" he inquired hoarsely, a quaver in his voice, a
sense of evil overcoming his usual mistrust of his nephew.

<p>Francesco flashed a glance at Beatrice; then his grimness all deserted
him. "My God!" he cried out. "How shall I tell you?" He buried his face
in his hands; his shoulders heaved, and a sob escaped him.

<p>"Francesco!" cried his uncle in tremulous appeal. "What is it? Who is
that?" And he pointed to the body on the ground.

<p>And then Francesco made pretence to control himself, and told his
wicked story, told it with a cunning as surpassing as that of the tale
itself, with averted eyes, in a voice stifled now by emotion, broken
now by sobs. Thus did he relate how passing homeward he had seen the
garden postern standing wide; wondering he had stepped into the garden,
and seeing a light in the window of the chamber Beatrice was wont to
inhabit, he had advanced, moved by a premonition that all was not
well. Through the window he had seen them&mdash;Baldassare Scipione and
Beatrice&mdash;there together. By a strange negligence, which had proved the
man's just undoing, they had not bethought them to draw the curtains
close. Inflamed by a kinsman's righteous indignation, he had climbed
the stairs, and so surprised them. He had fallen upon Scipione and he
had slain him.

<p>Old Omodei sat, a bowed figure, hands on knees, head fallen forward,
and listened to his nephew's infamous invention, entirely duped by it,
convinced by the grim evidence at hand. A while after Francesco had
done, he remained so, like one bereft of understanding. At last he
moved; a groan escaped him, and Francesco looking furtively saw two
tears trickle slowly adown his uncle's furrowed cheeks. Yet Francesco
knew no pity.

<p>Suddenly the old man stiffened. He rose, determination on his ashen
face. He looked steadily and long at Beatrice, who met his glance with
one that he accounted of defiance. She had heard the story. She knew
that she must contradict it, knew that she held this vile Francesco
in the hollow of her hand. And yet she sat spellbound, incapable of
speech, frozen out of volition by an odd curiosity to see what these
men would do. She was as a spectator at some play in whose movement she
was nowise concerned.

<p>The Count turned fiercely to Francesco. "Give me your dagger," he
demanded, and held out his hand.

<p>"What would you do?" cried Francesco, now alarmed.

<p>"Complete the work that you have but half done. Wipe out the remainder
of this stain. Give me your dagger."

<p>Francesco drew away, aghast. "No, no!" he cried. "You shall not. I
swear that you shall not."

<p>"You fool!" his uncle snarled at him. "Can I let live an Omodei at
whom the vulgar may point the finger of scorn? Shall I suffer her&mdash;my
daughter&mdash;to be leered at for a strumpet each time she goes abroad.
Come, come! Give me your&mdash;"

<p>He checked abruptly. His mouth fell open. He hunched his shoulders,
like one gathering to resist a blow.

<p>Beatrice had found her voice at last, and used it&mdash;used it to utter a
soft, scornful laugh.

<p>The Count recovered, and the anger that had momentarily ebbed came
flooding back. "You laugh!" he cried, his eyes ablaze. "You dare to
laugh?"

<p>She rose slowly. Her recovery of her faculties was complete. The
immensity of her scorn blotted out fear and horror and all other
things, leaving her supremely mistress of herself.

<p>"I laugh, my father, at that poor fool and liar who has dug himself
a pit as deep as death. I could almost laugh at you for very scorn
of your readiness to believe him. I think, sir," she pursued, with a
dignity the like of which he had never dreamed could dwell in her,
"that you have lived too much with your books and too little with your
daughter, else you had known better than for one instant to have given
heed to this foul knave."

<p>In that fair virgin's eyes there glowed a majesty of anger that made
her father cringe and tremble. No longer he the executioner of her, but
she the judge of him, and pitiless in her judgment as only the child
can be to the parent who has failed in parenthood.

<p>He leaned against the table and hung his head, a very criminal with all
the feelings of a thief convicted. Mere words, after all, had robbed
him of his self-respect, and Francesco was at hand to restore it him
with words.

<p>"Alas, Beatrice!" sighed her cousin. "Better would it beseem you to
admit your fault in all humility, to go down upon your knees and sue
for pardon, than add to all the rest this gross... Oh, sir, oh, sir,"
he cried to his uncle, "I have no words for it. That she should seek to
hector so, while the body of her lover lies at her feet, here, to speak
her shame."

<p>"Ha!" It was a growl from her father. His eye rekindled. He threw back
his old white head. "Can you explain that?" he challenged her.

<p>"I can," said she, quite calmly. "But it would make a long story."

<p>"Not a doubt," he rumbled savagely.

<p>"It shall be told you later. Meanwhile, there is a shorter should
suffice to brand this subtle gentleman, your nephew. That body which
Francesco says shall speak my shame shall speak his villainy instead."

<p>She crossed to the body, her glance upon Francesco who watched her in
surprise. "Who do you say lies here?" she asked him, a world of disdain
in her voice, almost a shadow of a smile about her pale lips.

<p>The look, the tone went through Francesco like so much steel. He
steadied himself, attempted to shake off his sudden fears, studied the
pink and white legs, and was stricken dumb.

<p>But the Count broke the momentary silence.

<p>"What serves that question? You heard him say 'your lover'&mdash;Baldassare
Scipione."

<p>She looked from one to the other, then down a moment at the bundle
lying there. Stifling her repugnance she stooped quickly, and with
shaking fingers pulled away the velvet folds that had formed about the
dead man's head. She disclosed at last the livid face and staring eyes
of Amerigo Vitelli.

<p>"Look!" she bade them, erect now, and pointing to that face.

<p>They looked, and Francesco all but screamed his horror. He controlled
himself, and his fertile brain worked now at fever pace. How this thing
had chanced he could not for the moment think, nor did he greatly
care. What mattered was to save himself&mdash;to save his neck from the
strangler's noose that was dangling now so close.

<p>The Count stared, and gasped, utterly bewildered. Suddenly his
voice challenged Francesco, harsh and quivering: "What say you now,
Francesco?"

<p>He looked at his uncle by an effort of will. By a still greater, he
looked at Beatrice. Then he spoke. His voice trembled, his face was
ghastly; but all this was as it should be. He had found his answer.

<p>"It is strange indeed, I should have been so mistaken," said he.
"Perhaps because I knew how my cousin stands towards Captain Scipione,
I never dreamed that her midnight visitor could be another."

<p>It was shrewd&mdash;infernally shrewd. For a moment it convinced the Count;
for a moment it made Beatrice feel that the ground she had deemed so
firm was crumbling beneath her feet. Then from the balcony a new voice
spoke: "There are some folks in the garden can explain more fully."

<p>They started round at that intruding sound, at that voice that rang
with such sardonic calm. On the balcony, sharply outlined against the
night's black background by the light that beat upon him from the room,
stood the tall figure of Baldassare Scipione in his scarlet cloak. So
absorbed had they been that his soft approach had gone unheeded.

<p>He turned now, and made a sign into the night. From the garden, in
response, came a faint clank of arms, then heavy steps rang on the
staircase.

<p>Scipione stepped forward into the room. Beatrice sped to him. He put
an arm about her, in protection, and over her head confronted the
bewildered Count and the now terrified Francesco who had backed away
before him until he clawed the arras and could back no farther.

<p>"There are some drunken revellers in the garden who followed their
friend Vitelli, and saw him done to death but ten minutes since, as he
was entering here, before he had passed those curtains. He fell into
a snare that was baited for myself. You shall know more anon, sir.
Meanwhile, here are the bargelli of the podesta to seek the murderer."

<p>Six of the podesta's men clattered in, some of the revellers hanging
fearfully in their wake. One there was who pushed forward into the
room&mdash;a slim figure in cloth of gold and with a gilded calf's head
mask upon his face. That absurd mask he tore off as he entered, and at
sight of his dead master's body, Amerigo's page flung aside his lute,
and poured forth twixt rage and sorrow the tale of what he had beheld.
He was the witness to bring Messer Francesco degli Omodei within the
clutches of the Justice of the Duke, and his neck into the strangler's
noose.

<hr><h2><a name="ch6"></a>6. THE LUST OF CONQUEST</h2>

<p>THE hour of Cesare Borgia's power and glory was that of full noontide.
He had made an end of the treacherous condottieri who had dared to
rise against him and for a moment to hold him in check, threatening
not only to arrest his conquering progress but to undo all that he had
done. He had limed a springe for them at Sinigaglia, and&mdash;in the words
of the Florentine Secretary, Machiavelli&mdash;he had lured them thither
by the sweetness of his whistling. They came the more readily in that
they mistook their roles, conceiving themselves the fowlers, and him
the victim. He quickly disabused their minds on that score; and having
taken them, he wrung their necks with no more compunction than had they
been so many capons. Their considerable forces he partly destroyed and
dispersed, partly assimilated into his own vast army, whereafter he
swept southward and homeward to Rome by way of Umbria.

<p>In Perugia his sometime captain, Gianpaolo Baglioni, one of the more
fortunate rebels who had escaped him, was arming to resist him, and
making big talk of the reckoning he would present to Cesare Borgia. But
when from the high-perched eyrie of his ancient Etruscan stronghold,
Gianpaolo caught afar the first gleam of arms in the white January
sunshine, he talked no more. He packed instead, and fled discreetly,
intent to reach Siena and take shelter with Petrucci.

<p>And no sooner was he gone than Perugia&mdash;which for generations had been
weary of his blood-smeared family&mdash;sent ambassadors with messages of
welcome to the Duke.

<p>Gianpaolo heard of this in Assisi, and his rage was a prodigy even for
a Baglioni. He was a black-browed, powerful man, built like an ape with
a long body and short legs, a fine soldier, as all the world knows,
endowed with a reckless courage and a persuasive tongue that lured men
to follow him. In quitting Perugia, he had listened for once to the
voice of discretion, urged by the cold and calculating quality of his
hatred of the Borgia, and by the hope that in alliance with Petrucci he
might stir up Tuscany, and so return in force against the Duke.

<p>But now that he had word of how cravenly&mdash;as he accounted it&mdash;his city
of Perugia had not only bent her neck to the yoke of the conqueror,
which was perhaps inevitable, but had further bent the knee in homage
and held out her arms in welcome, he repented him fiercely of his
departure, and was blinded to reason by his rage.

<p>He was so mad as to attempt to induce Assisi to resist the advancing
Duke. But the city of St Francis bade the belligerent Gianpaolo go with
God ere the Duke arrived; for the Duke was already on his way, and did
he find Gianpaolo there, the latter would assuredly share the fate
which had visited his fellow-rebels.

<p>Baglioni angrily took his departure, to pursue his road to Siena. But
some three miles to the south of Assisi he drew rein, and lifted his
eyes to the stronghold of Solignola, poised, gaunt and grey, upon
a projecting crag of the Subasian hills. It was the lair of that
indomitable old wolf Count Guido degli Speranzoni, whose pride was as
the pride of Lucifer, whose fierceness was as the fierceness of the
Baglioni&mdash;to which family he claimed kinship through his mother&mdash;whose
defiance of the Pope was as the defiance of an infidel.

<p>Gianpaolo sat his horse under the drizzling rain, and considered
Solignola awhile, with pursed lips. Tonight, he reflected, Cesare would
lie at Assisi, which was as ready as a strumpet for surrender. Tomorrow
his envoys would wait upon the Lord of Solignola, and surely, if he
knew the old warrior, Count Guido's answer would be a haughty refusal
to receive the Duke.

<p>He took his resolve. He would ride up, and seek out Speranzoni. If the
Count were indeed prepared for resistance, Gianpaolo had that to say
that should encourage him. If his resoluteness had not been weakened,
as had most men's, by the mere approach of Cesare Borgia, then it might
yet come to pass that here they should do the thing that at Sinigaglia
had so grievously miscarried. Thus should his strangled comrades be
avenged, and thus should Italy be rid of this scourge. Of that same
scourge, as he now dubbed the Lord Cesare Borgia, he had himself but
lately been one of the thongs. But Messer Gianpaolo was not subtle.

<p>He turned to his armoured followers&mdash;a score or so of men-at-arms
who remained faithful to him in this hour of general defection&mdash;and
made known his intention to ride up to Solignola. Then, by a winding
mountain path, he led the way thither.

<p>As they ascended from the vast plain of Umbria, so leafless, grey and
desolate under that leaden wintry sky, they perceived through a gap in
the hills the cluster of little townships and hamlets, on the slopes
and in the eastern valley, which formed the territory and dominion of
Solignola. These lay practically without defences, and they must fall
an easy prey to the Duke. But Baglioni knew that the fierce old Count
was not the man to allow any such considerations to weaken his resolve
to resist the Borgia, and to that resolve Gianpaolo hoped to spur him.

<p>Dusk was descending when the little company of Perugians reached the
Northern Gate of Solignola, and the hells of the Duomo were ringing
the Angelus&mdash;the evening prayer in honour of the Blessed Mother of
Chastity revived in Italy by the unchaste Borgia Pope. Baglioni's party
clattered over the bridge spanning a chasm in the rocks in the depths
of which a foaming mountain torrent, swollen and umber-tinted by the
recent rains, hurled itself adown its headlong course to join the Tiber
in the valley.

<p>Having satisfied the guard, they rode forward into the city and up the
steep long street to the Rocca, regarded with awe by the burghers, who
looked upon them as the harbingers of this invasion which they knew to
be sweeping towards them from the north.

<p>Thus they came to the mighty citadel and thudded over the drawbridge
into the great courtyard, where they were instantly hemmed about
by a swarm of men-at-arms who demanded of them not only an account
of themselves, but news as well of Cesare Borgia's army. Gianpaolo
satisfied them briefly, announced his name, and demanded to see Count
Guido at once.

<p>The Lord of Solignola sat in council in the Sala degli Angioli&mdash;a
chamber so known from the fresco which Luini had painted on the
ceiling, representing the opening heavens and a vision of angels beyond
the parted clouds. With the Count sat Messer del Campo, the President
of the Council of Anziani, Messer Pino Paviano, the Master of the
Artificers' Guild, two gentlemen from the valley&mdash;the Lords of Aldi
and Barbero&mdash;a gentleman of Assisi&mdash;Messer Gianluca della Pieve&mdash;and
the Count's two principal officers, the Seneschal of Solignola and the
condottiero Santafiora.

<p>They sat about a long, quadrangular oak table in the thickening gloom,
with no other light but that of the log fire that roared under the
wide cowled chimney; and with them, at the foot of the table, facing
the Count, odd member of this warlike council, sat a woman&mdash;the Lady
Panthasilea degli Speranzoni, Count Guido's daughter. In years she
was little more than a girl; in form and face she showed a glorious
maturity of womanhood; in mind and character she was a very man. To
describe her the scholarly Cerbone had already, a year ago, made use
of the term 'virago'&mdash;not in its perverted, but in its literal and
original meaning, signifying a woman who in intellect and spirit is a
man.

<p>It was by virtue of these endowments as much as because she was Count
Guido's only child and heir, that she attended now this council, and
listened gravely to all that was urged in this matter of the Borgia
invasion. She was magnificently tall, and very regal in her bearing and
in the carriage of her glorious head. Her eyes were large, dark and
lustrous; her hair of a glowing copper; and her tint of the delicate
fairness that is attributed to the daughters of the north. The rich
colour of her sensitive lips told of the warm blood that flowed in her;
their set and shape bore witness to her courage and her will.

<p>Into this assembly, which rose eagerly to receive him, was ushered the
Lord Gianpaolo Baglioni. He clanked into the room upon his muscular
bowed legs, a sinister figure as seen in the gloom with the firelight
playing ruddily upon his armour and his swarthy black-bearded face.

<p>Count Guido advanced to embrace him and to greet him with words of
very cordial welcome, which at once told the crafty Baglioni all that
he most desired to know. The Count presented him to the company, and
invited him to join their council, since his arrival was so timely and
since, no doubt, he would be able to offer them advice of which they
stood most sorely in need, that they might determine upon their course
of action.

<p>He thanked them for the honour, and dropped with a rattle of metal into
the proffered chair. Count Guido called for lights, and when these were
fetched they revealed the haggard air of Messer Gianpaolo which was
accentuated by the splashed harness in which he came amongst them, just
as he had ridden. His smouldering eye travelled round the board, and
when it found the Assisian gentleman, Gianluca della Pieve, he smiled
sombrely.

<p>"Hard though I have ridden," said he, "it seems that another is before
me with news of what is happening in Assisi."

<p>Della Pieve answered him. "I arrived three hours ago, and I bore the
news that Assisi has thrown up her gates to receive and harbour the
invader. The Communal Palace is being prepared for him; it is expected
that he will remain awhile in the city, making it a centre whence he
can conduct such operations as he intends against such strongholds as
may resist him."

<p>"And is Solignola to be reckoned among these?" inquired Gianpaolo
bluntly, his eyes upon Count Guido.

<p>The old Lord of Solignola met his glance calmly, his shaven hawk face
inscrutable, his almost lipless mouth tight and firm. It was a face at
once handsome, strong and crafty&mdash;the face of one who never would yield
lightly.

<p>"That," he answered slowly, "is what we are assembled to determine.
Have you anything to add to the information afforded us by della Pieve?"

<p>"I have not. This gentleman has told you all that is known to me."

<p>"None the less your coming is most timely. Our deliberations make no
progress, and we do not seem likely to agree. You, perhaps, may guide
us with your counsel."

<p>"You see, Messer Baglioni," put in the Lord of Barbero&mdash;a redfaced,
jovial gentleman of middle-age&mdash;"our interests are different, and we
are naturally governed by our interests."

<p>"Naturally, as you say," agreed Baglioni with imperceptible sarcasm.

<p>"Now we of the valley&mdash;and my friend Francesco d'Aldi, there, cannot
deny it&mdash;we of the valley lie open to attack; we are defenceless;
the few townships that have walls at all, have not such walls as
will resist bombardment. It is a fine thing for Count Guido and the
folk of Solignola itself to talk of resistance. Solignola is all but
impregnable. And well-provisioned and well-garrisoned as the city
is, Count Guido may, if it please him, resist long enough to enforce
advantageous terms. But what in the meanwhile will be our fate down
yonder? Cesare Borgia will avenge upon us the stubbornness of the
capital. Therefore do we urge his Excellency&mdash;and we have in this the
suffrage also of the Master of the Artificers' Guild&mdash;to follow the
example of Assisi and your own Perugia" (Gianpaolo winced) "and send
his ambassadors to the Duke with offers of submission."

<p>Gianpaolo shook his great head. "It is not the Duke's way to avenge
upon dependencies the resistance of a capital. He is too guileful,
believe me. Whom he subjects he conciliates. There will be no such fire
and sword as you fear for your townships of the valley. Solignola's
resistance&mdash;if she resist&mdash;will be visited upon Solignola alone. That
much I can say from my knowledge gained in service with the Duke. Let
me remind you of Faenza. What harm was suffered by the folk of the
Val di Lamone? Why, none. The strongholds surrendered, and knew no
violence, although Faenza herself resisted stubbornly."

<p>"But to little purpose," put in Paviano&mdash;the Guildmaster&mdash;sourly.

<p>"That," said Count Guido, "is beside the point. And Faenza had not the
natural strength of Solignola."

<p>"Yet, ultimately," protested Barbero, "surrender you must. You cannot
resist an army of ten thousand men for ever."

<p>"They cannot besiege us for ever," snapped Santafiora, the condottiero,
rearing his cropped bullet-head.

<p>Baglioni sat back in his chair, and listened to the hot debate that
followed now. He was as one who has tossed down a ball into a field of
players, and, having done so, watches it being flung back and forth in
the course of the ensuing game.

<p>Count Guido, too, took little part in the discussion, but listened
silently, his eyes passing from speaker to speaker, his countenance a
mask. Facing him his daughter was sitting forward, her elbows on the
table, her chin in her cupped palms, intent upon every word that was
uttered, her eyes now glowing with enthusiasm, now coldly scornful,
as the argument turned for or against resistance. But it was all
inconclusive, and at the end of a half-hour's wrangling they were no
nearer a decision than when Gianpaolo had arrived.

<p>It was at this stage that Count Guido turned again to the Perugian,
and, profiting by a momentary silence following a vigorous plea for
resistance from Santafiora, invited him to speak.

<p>"It may be that I can help you," said Gianpaolo slowly, "for it happens
that my proposal supports neither one side nor the other of the
discussion to which I have listened. My suggestion concerns a middle
course; and since something of the sort seems to be needed here if you
are not to spend your days in talk, perhaps your courtesy will give
attention to what I have to say."

<p>The company stirred expectantly, and settled into an attentive silence.
Panthasilea's eyes turned with the others upon the grim face of the
speaker, and never left it whilst he was delivering his message.

<p>"Sirs," he said, "here has been talk of resistance and of surrender. Of
attack, of assuming the offensive, it seems not one of you has thought."

<p>"To what purpose?" quoth Santafiora, scowling. "We have a bare five
hundred men."

<p>But Baglioni imperiously waved the condottiero into silence. "Hear me
out before you judge me, and do not outrun me by conclusions of your
own. You may know&mdash;or you may not, for Italy is full of lies upon
the subject&mdash;of the business in which those gallant gentlemen, who
were my friends, came by their deaths in Sinigaglia&mdash;a death which I,
myself, have very narrowly escaped by the infinite mercy of God." And
he crossed himself piously. "It had been planned, sirs, to take this
Duke, and make an end of him. An arbalister was to have shot him as he
rode into the town. But he is the fiend&mdash;the incarnate fiend. He came
forewarned. <i>Praemonitus et praemunitus</i>. He turned the trap about,
and took in it those who had plotted to take him. The rest you know."
He leaned forward, and his blood-injected eyes ran over the assembled
company. "Sirs," he concluded in a thick, concentrated voice, "that
which failed at Sinigaglia might succeed in Assisi."

<p>There was a stir, breaking the rapt silence in which he had been heard.
He looked at them with challenge in his glance. "Needs more be said?"
he asked.

<p>"Ay," cried Paviano, "the how and the when, the ways and the means."

<p>"Why that, of course. But first&mdash;" He turned to Count Guido. "Have
you a mind to follow such a course; to rid Italy of this scourge at a
single stroke; to save your dominions and the dominions of others from
being ravished by this insatiable devourer? Destroy Cesare Borgia, and
you will have destroyed the head and brain of the Pontifical forces;
thus there will be an end to this conquest of the Romagna, which
presently will spread into a conquest of middle Italy; for if he lives
he will not rest until he is king of Tuscany. He is not easy of access,
and since Sinigaglia he uses all precautions. Yet while he is resting
in Assisi should be your opportunity if you have a mind to seize it."

<p>Count Guido sat thoughtful and frowning, whilst eagerness glowed on
several faces, positive fierceness of concurrence on one or two. But
one dissentient there was in old del Campo.

<p>"It is murder you are proposing," he said in tones of chill reproof.

<p>"And what then? Shall a mere word set up a barrier for grown men?"
demanded the fierce Baglioni.

<p>"It would not for one woman that I know of," said the clear boyish
voice of Madonna Panthasilea, and so drew upon herself, with those
first words she had ventured to utter in that council, the gaze of all.
There was a feverish light in her dark eyes, a feverish glow in her
fair cheeks. Meeting their glances she addressed them: "What my Lord
Gianpaolo has said is true. While Cesare Borgia lives there is no peace
for middle Italy. And there is one thing, and one thing only that can
save Solignola&mdash;the death of Cesare Borgia."

<p>A roar of acclamation was the answer to those words&mdash;words uttered
already by Baglioni&mdash;now that they fell from her red lips. It was her
beauty and her glorious womanhood that swayed them&mdash;as men ever will be
swayed even against reason, against honour and against knowledge.

<p>But old del Campo remained untouched by the subtle magnetism of sex. He
rose as the acclamations died down. He turned a calm, impassive face
upon Count Guido.

<p>"My lord," he asked, his voice ice-cold, "does this receive your
countenance?"

<p>The white face of the old Count was set and hard, as his voice was hard
when, after a moment's thought, he spoke. "Upon what grounds, Messer
del Campo, would you urge that it should not? for that is clearly what
you would urge."

<p>The President of the Anziani steadily met the Count's steely glance. He
bowed a thought ironically. "I am answered," he said. He thrust back
his chair, and stepped from the table. "Permit, my lord, and you, sirs,
that I withdraw before you go further in a matter in which I will have
no part."

<p>He bowed again to all, drew his furred robes about him, and proudly
left the chamber in the ensuing silence, leaving a chill behind him.

<p>Scarce had the door closed after him than Gianpaolo was on his feet,
his face pale with excitement.

<p>"Sir Count," he cried, "that man must not leave the citadel. Our
lives may hang upon it. Too many such schemes have miscarried through
less than this. Cesare Borgia's spies are everywhere. They will be in
Solignola now, and should del Campo utter a word of what has passed
here, the Duke may hear of it tomorrow."

<p>There was a moment's silence. Count Guido's eyes seemed to ask
Gianpaolo a question.

<p>"There is no dungeon in your castle too deep for Messer del Campo until
this thing is done," said he; and he added almost under his breath:
"Indeed, I doubt if there be any deep enough."

<p>The Count turned to Santanora. "See to it," he said in a low voice, and
Santanora rose and departed on his errand.

<p>Madonna Panthasilea's face grew very white; her eyes dilated. She
feared the worst for old del Campo, who had been her own and her
father's faithful friend for many a year. Yet she saw the necessity for
the measure, and so crushed down the womanly weakness that arose in
her, and spoke no word of intercession for him.

<p>Presently the Count solemnly addressed the company.

<p>"Sirs," he said, "you have plainly signified your agreement with the
proposal made by Messer Gianpaolo."

<p>"A thought occurs to me," put in Francesco d'Aldi, and at once he
claimed their attention. He was a scholar, a patron of the arts, a man
of natural shrewdness and much worldly experience, who had dwelt much
in courts and for a season had been the Orator of Solignola at the
Vatican. "A doubt occurs to me as to the wisdom of my Lord Baglioni's
proposal as it stands."

<p>Angry glances, a snort or two of impatience, and a short contemptuous
laugh from Baglioni, were his answers. But he fronted the disapproval
calmly, and in that moment of his pause Santafiora re-entered the
chamber.

<p>"Give me your patience, sirs," said Messer Francesco, and he almost
smiled. "I do not wish to bear del Campo company in his dungeon."

<p>Santafiora smiled grimly as he resumed his seat. That and his silence
told the company all that it could have asked the condottiero.

<p>"Say on," the Count bade the Lord of Aldi. "We all know your worth,
Francesco."

<p>Messer Francesco bowed, and cleared his throat. "Messer Gianpaolo has
told us what would result from the death of Cesare Borgia&mdash;enough to
justify the slaying of him so far as the ultimate consequences are at
issue. But we, here in Solignola, have also to consider the immediate
consequences of this act; for those immediate consequences would touch
ourselves."

<p>"Sacrifice for the State's weal is the duty of the individual," said
Gianpaolo harshly.

<p>"Since Messer Gianpaolo proposes to seek safety for himself in Siena,
it is easy for him to utter these beautiful sentiments," said Aldi
tartly.

<p>Some laughed, Baglioni spluttered an angry oath, and Count Guido
intervened to sooth him.

<p>"Myself," proceeded Francesco d'Aldi, "I oppose the sacrifice of the
individual where it is not necessary, and in this case I hold that
it is not. We are to consider that with Cesare Borgia are several
condottieri who are devoted to him. Such men as Corella, Scipione,
della Volpe and others would never allow his death to go unavenged. And
the measure of revenge they would exact is such as no man may calmly
contemplate. Solignola would cease to exist; not a town, not a hamlet
would be left standing&mdash;no man, woman or child would they spare in
their devastating fury. Can you envisage that, sirs?" he inquired, and
was answered by gloomy looks and silence. "But I have an alternative
proposal," he continued, "which should more effectively meet our needs,
and lead to the same result for us&mdash;for Solignola, Assisi and Perugia.

<p>"It is that we take the Duke of Valentinois alive, and hold him as a
hostage, threatening to hang him if we are beset. That should keep
his condottieri in check, and meanwhile we send our envoys to the
Pope. We offer his Holiness his son's life and liberty in exchange
for our own lives and our own liberties, in exchange for a Bull of
perpetual franchisement from the States of the Church; and to quicken
his Holiness' penmanship we add a threat that if the Bull is not in
our hands within a given term we will proceed to hang the Lord Cesare
Borgia."

<p>"Most shrewd!" Baglioni cried, and others echoed the applause.

<p>"But there is a difficulty," said Francesco. "It lies in the Duke's
capture."

<p>"Indeed, yes," agreed Paviano gloomily.

<p>"But surely by guile," urged Count Guido, "he might be lured into
some&mdash;some trap."

<p>"We should need such guile as Cesare Borgia's own," said Santafiora.

<p>And now for a while they talked to no purpose, and first one offered
a suggestion, then another; but these suggestions were all as obvious
to propose as they were impossible to execute. That a half-hour was
spent, and they were no nearer a solution; some indeed were beginning
to despair, when Madonna Panthasilea rose slowly to her feet.

<p>She stood at the table's end, her bands resting lightly upon the board,
her tall, lithe body in its russet gown, inclining slightly forward,
her bosom rising and falling, and the pallor of excitement on her face,
the sparkle of excitement in her liquid eyes.

<p>"It is most fitting," she said slowly, her voice steady and composed,
"that Solignola's future mistress should be Solignola's saviour in this
hour. Thus shall I prove my right to rule here when the time comes&mdash;and
please God it may he very distant yet."

<p>The silence of utter amazement that followed her words was broken at
length by her father.

<p>"You, Panthasilea? What can you do?"

<p>"What no man of you all could do. For here is a matter that may best be
fought with woman's weapons."

<p>Against this they protested clamorously, some in horror, some in anger,
all excited, save only Baglioni, who cared not how the thing were done
so that it was done.

<p>She raised a hand for silence and obtained it.

<p>"There is between the Borgia and me this matter of saving Solignola.
That alone were matter enough to spur me. But there is more." She grew
deathly white and swayed a moment with closed eyes. Then, recovering
herself, continued: "Pietro Varano and I were to have wed this spring.
And Pietro Varano was strangled three months ago in the market-place
of Pesaro by Borgia justice. That too lies between me and the Duke of
Valentinois; and vengeance should give me strength in this enterprise,
which must be approached by such ways as only a woman's feet may tread."

<p>"But the danger of it!" cried Count Guido.

<p>"Think not of that. What danger shall I run? I am not known in Assisi,
where I have not been since I was a little child. I am scarce known in
Solignola itself, where I have been seen but little since my return
from Mantua. And I shall be careful how I show myself in Assisi. Sirs,
you must not gainsay me in this. I set my hand to the task to preserve
our State's independence, to save thousands of lives. As Messer
Gianpaolo has said, sacrifice for the State's weal is the duty of the
individual. Yet here so much can scarcely be required."

<p>Men muttered, and looked at her father. It was for him to speak. The
Count took his head in his hands and sat in thought.

<p>"What&mdash;what is your plan?" quoth Gianluca della Pieve thickly. Her
ready answer showed how fully already she had considered the matter.
"I shall go down to Assisi, taking with me a dozen men of Santafiora's
condotta, disguised as peasants and lackeys. And while Solignola defies
Cesare Borgia, and so detains him in Assisi, I shall find ways to lure
him into a snare, bind him hand and foot and bear him off to Siena,
where Messer Gianpaolo will await me. For my purpose, Messer della
Pieve, your house in Assisi will be necessary to me. You will lend it
me."

<p>"Lend it you?" quoth he in horror. "Lend it to be a mouse-trap in
which you&mdash;your matchless womanhood&mdash;shall be the cheese? Is that your
meaning?"

<p>She lowered her eyes; a crimson flush overspread her face.

<p>"Solignola," she replied, "is in danger of being conquered. In
the valley thousands of women and little children are in danger
of homelessness, of death and worse than death. Shall one woman
hesitate"&mdash;and now she raised her eyes again and flashed them defiantly
upon the company&mdash;"shall one woman hesitate to endure a little insult
when at the price of it she can buy so much?"

<p>It was her father who returned the answer that none other dared return.
He uncovered a face that had become grey and haggard.

<p>"She is right," he said, and&mdash;odd argument for an Italian of the
cinquecento&mdash;"it is her sacred duty to the people she was born to
rule," he informed them. "Since there offers no way by which a man's
strength may prevail against Valentinois, della Pieve you will lend
your house; you, Santafiora, the men that she requires."

<p>Assisi, conquered without bloodshed, all trace of conquest sedulously
removed as was the way of Cesare Borgia, was settling down to its
workaday aspect which the Duke's occupation had scarcely ruffled.

<p>Though princes perish, thrones crumble in min, and dynasties be
supplanted, citizens must eat and live and go about their business.
Thus, whilst some remained in Assisi who scowled as Cesare Borgia, Duke
of Valentinois, went abroad, the greater portion bared their heads and
bowed their duty to the conqueror, the great captain who had made it
his life's task to reconsolidate into one powerful state these petty
tyrannies of the Romagna.

<p>The half of Cesare's army was encamped in the surrounding country. The
other half, under Michele da Corella, had advanced to lay siege to
Solignola, which had returned a defiant answer to Cesare's envoys when
these had gone to invite Count Guido to surrender.

<p>It was a difficult place to take, and Cesare was too wise a captain
to be in haste where haste must prove expensive. Assisi afforded him
pleasant quarters, and was a convenient centre for the transaction of
such business as he had with Florence and Siena, and so he sat down
very patiently to await the result of certain operations which he had
indicated to Corella.

<p>The chief feature of these was the preparation of a mine under the
walls on the southern side of the city, almost under the very citadel
itself at the point where it was flanked by the hill. Between the
difficulties of access to the place, and the vigilance and continual
sorties of the defenders, it became apparent at the end of a week
that at the present rate of operations it would take Corella a month
to effect a breach. Cesare began to consider the wisdom of opening a
bombardment, deterred, however, by the difficulty there would be in
effectively mounting a park of artillery upon those rocky slopes.

<p>The matter of this obstinate but futile resistance offered by
Solignola, intrigued his Highness of Valentinois, and he was assured
that some explanation for it must exist that was not obvious. That
explanation he sought on every hand, for the Sinigaglia affair had
rendered him doubly wary and alert.

<p>One fair morning in early February, on which the deeper golden of
the sunlight told of approaching spring, Cesare rode down the steep
borgo from the market-place, the centre of a brilliant group of
horsemen&mdash;captains in steel, courtiers in silk, and, beside him, upon a
snow-white mule, the handsome scarlet figure of Cardinal Remolino, the
Papal legate <i>a latere</i>.

<p>It was a joyous cavalcade, most of its members being as young as the
young Duke himself; and gay talk and laughter leaped from them as they
rode forward to visit Corella's camp under Solignola.

<p>In the open space before the Convent of Santa Chiara their progress was
arrested for a moment by a mule litter that struck across their course
towards one of the streets that led to San Rufino. It was attended by
two footmen, and a very elegant cavalier on a big roan horse who rode
on the litter's farther side.

<p>The Cardinal-legate was speaking to Cesare, and Cesare was allowing his
eyes to stray, as do the eyes of a man not over-interested in what he
is being told. They chanced to fall upon the litter, and what he saw
there caught his roving glance, and held it.

<p>The curtain had been drawn aside, and at the very moment that he
looked, the cavalier was&mdash;or so it seemed to him&mdash;stooping to point him
out to the lady who sat within. It was this lady's splendid beauty that
now engrossed his gaze; and in that instant her eyes, large and solemn
as a child's, were raised to his.

<p>Their glances met across the little intervening space, and Cesare saw
her lips part as in surprise, saw the colour perish in her cheeks,
leaving them ivory white. In homage&mdash;not to the woman, but to the
beauty that was hers, for like all of his race he accounted beauty the
most cardinal of all the virtues&mdash;the conqueror doffed his hat, and
bowed to the very withers of his horse.

<p>The Cardinal, checked in full flow of argument, scowled at this proof
of inattention, and scowled more darkly still when to reveal the full
extent of it, Cesare asked him softly: "Who is that lady, do you know?"

<p>The prelate, who had a famous eye for feminine beauty, followed
Cesare's indication promptly. But in that moment the curtain fell
again, thus baffling his eager glance.

<p>Cesare, a smile on his lips, uttered a slight sigh, and then fell very
pensive, intrigued by the element of abnormality, slight as it was,
that the incident had offered. He had been pointed out to her, and at
sight of him she had turned pale. What was the reason? He could not
recollect that he had ever seen her before; and had he seen her, hers
was not a face he had forgot. Why, then, did the sight of him affect
her in so odd a manner? Men enough had turned pale before him, ay, and
women too. But there had ever been a reason. What was the reason here?

<p>The litter and its attendants vanished into the by-street. But still
Cesare was not done with it. He turned in his saddle to an Assisian
gentleman who rode behind.

<p>"Did you mark the cavalier who accompanied that litter?" quoth he, and
added the question: "Is he of Assisi?"

<p>"Why, yes, Excellency," was the answer. "That is Messer Gianluca della
Pieve."

<p>"Della Pieve?" said Cesare, thoughtful. "That is the member of the
council who was absent when the oath was taken. Ha! We should have more
knowledge of this gentleman and his motives for that absence." He rose
in his stirrups as his horse moved forward, and called over the heads
of some others: "Scipione!"

<p>One of the steel captains pushed forward instantly to his side. "You
saw the litter and the cavalier," said Cesare. "He is Messer Gianluca
della Pieve. You will follow them, and bring me word where the lady
resides, and at the same time you will bring me Messer della Pieve. Let
him await my return at the Palace. Should it be necessary you will use
constraint. But bring him. Away with you. Forward, sirs."

<p>Baldassare Scipione backed away, wheeled his charger, and departed in
discreet pursuit of the litter.

<p>Cesare pushed on, his cavaliers about him; but he went thoughtful,
still pondering that question: "Why did she turn pale?"

<p>The reason, had he known it, might have flattered him. Madonna
Panthasilea had come to Assisi to destroy by guile one whom she had
never heard described save as an odious monster, the devastator of
all Italy. She had looked to see some horror of a man, malformed,
prematurely aged and ravaged by disease and the wrath of Heaven.
Instead she found a youthful cavalier, resplendent of raiment, superb
of shape, and beautiful of countenance beyond all men that she had ever
seen. The glory of his eyes when she had found them full upon her own,
seeming to grope into her very soul, had turned her faint and dizzy.
Nor did she recover until the curtain fell again, and she remembered
that however noble and gallant his presence, he was the enemy of her
race, the man whose destruction it was her high mission to encompass as
she stood pledged.

<p>Reclining in her litter as it moved forward, she half closed her eyes,
and smiled to herself as she remembered how avid had been his gaze. It
was well.

<p>The litter curtain was slightly lifted from without. "Madonna, we are
being followed," murmured Gianluca.

<p>Her smile grew broader, more content. The affair was speeding as it
should. She said so to her cavalier.

<p>Her smile and her words caused an anger to flare out in Gianluca&mdash;an
anger that for a moment had manifested itself that night when first she
had committed herself to this task, and had been smouldering since.

<p>"Madonna," he cried in a voice that was hoarse, "this is a Delilah's
work to which you are committed."

<p>She stared at him, and paled a little to bear this brutally true
description of the task; then she took refuge in haughtiness.

<p>"You are presumptuous, sir," she told him, and so lashed him with that
answer that he lost his head.

<p>"Presumptuous enough to love you, madonna," he replied, almost
fiercely, yet muttering, that her attendants should not overhear him.
"That is why I abhor to see you wedded to a task so infamous; making a
lure of your matchless beauty, a base&mdash;"

<p>"Stop!" she commanded him, so sternly that he obeyed her despite
himself.

<p>She paused a moment as one who chooses words, nor looked at him again
after that first imperious glance.

<p>"You are singularly daring," she said, and her voice was pitiless.
"We will forget what you have said, Messer Gianluca&mdash;all of it. As
long as I am in Assisi I must continue under your roof, since my
mission demands it. But I trust, sir, that you will relieve me of your
attendance, thus sparing me the memory of your offence, and yourself
the sight of one whom you condemn so harshly."

<p>"Madonna," he cried, "forgive me. I meant not as you think."

<p>"Messer della Pieve," she answered, with a little, cruel laugh of
scorn, "to be frank, I care not greatly what you meant. But I beg that
you will respect my wishes."

<p>"Depend upon it that I will, madonna," he answered bitterly, "and
suffer me to take my leave of you."

<p>He let the curtain fall, and even as he did so the litter came to a
halt before the portals of his house&mdash;one of the handsomest palaces in
Assisi, standing by the Duomo of San Rufino.

<p>With a white, sullen face he watched her alight, leaning upon the arm
of a footman who had hastened to discharge the pleasant duty that
usually was Gianluca's own; then he doffed his hat, bowed frigidly, and
wheeling his horse, he rode slowly away, nursing his sorely lacerated
pride, which the young Assisian mistook for injured love, just as he
had mistaken for love the ambition which had caused him to lift his
eyes to the future high and mighty Countess of Solignola.

<p>It was, therefore, a very short-tempered young gentleman who found
himself suddenly confronted and hailed by a tall warlike fellow on a
tall horse. Messer Gianluca scowled at Cesare's captain.

<p>"I do not know you, sir," said he.

<p>"That misfortune I am here to amend," said the bland Scipione.

<p>"I do not seek your acquaintance," said Gianluca still more rudely.

<p>"You shall have it, none the less. For I have orders to force it upon
you if necessary."

<p>Now these were ugly words to one whose conscience was not clear of
treason. Della Pieve's dark mood was elbowed aside by fear.

<p>"Is this an arrest?" he asked.

<p>Scipione laughed. "Why, no," said he. "I am sent to escort you; that is
all."

<p>"And whither, sir?"

<p>"Now here's a catechism! To the Communal Palace, to repair your
omission to wait upon his Highness of Valentinois."

<p>Gianluca looked into the other's rugged face, and observed that it was
friendly; he took courage, and made no more demur. And as they rode,
he sought to draw information from Scipione, but finding the captain
as close as an oyster, and mistrusting this closeness, he grew afraid
again.

<p>At the Communal Palace matters were no better. He was left to cool his
heels in an antechamber for two hours and more, to await the return of
the Duke who was abroad. It was in vain that he begged to be allowed
to depart, vowing that he would return anon. He was desired, for only
answer, to be patient; and so the conviction was forced upon him that
in some sort he was a prisoner. He remembered Baglioni's words, that
the Duke had spies everywhere, and he began to fear the worst. So
engrossed was he with these fears that all thought of Panthasilea faded
utterly from his mind&mdash;that lesser matter being supplanted by this
greater.

<p>At length, when his torture of suspense had reached a climax, and he
had begun to shiver in that chilly anteroom, an usher came to inform
him that the Duke awaited him. Whether it was of intent that the Duke
had submitted him to this suspense, to the end that through fear his
spirit might be softened as metal in the furnace, it is not possible
to say. But it may well be that some such purpose this crafty Duke
had sought to serve, desiring as he did to ascertain precisely what
was the attitude towards himself of this puissant gentleman of Assisi
who had failed to come with his brother <i>Anziani</i> to take the oath
of allegiance. Certain it is that della Pieve was a very subdued and
morally weakened young man when at length he was admitted to Cesare
Borgia's presence.

<p>He was ushered into the gloomy hall of the palace, which was lighted by
windows set high in the wall, and decorated by a multitude of rampant
lions&mdash;the Assisian emblem&mdash;frescoed in red upon a yellow ground,
unpleasantly bewildering to the eye. The place was chill, for all that
a wood fire was burning in the vast fireplace. About this stood a group
of Cesare's captains and courtiers, talking and laughing, when Gianluca
was admitted. His advent, however, was followed by a general and
somewhat disconcerting silence, and he became the object of a no less
disconcerting attention on the part of those same gentlemen, whilst
here he caught a smile, and there a shrug, all serving to heighten his
uneasiness.

<p>He gained the middle of the chamber, and hung there pausing awkwardly
for a moment. Then from the group the Duke's tall figure detached
itself. His Highness was all in black, but his doublet was embroidered
in arabesques of gold thread, so finely wrought that at the little
distance separating them, Gianluca thought him to be wearing damascened
body-armour.

<p>Cesare advanced, his pale young face very set and grave, fingers toying
with his tawny beard, eyes sad and thoughtful.

<p>"I have waited a week to give you welcome, Messer della Pieve," said
he coldly. "As I seemed in danger of having to forgo the honour, I
was constrained to send for you." And he paused as if awaiting an
explanation.

<p>But della Pieve had nothing to say. His mind seemed benumbed under the
Duke's steady glance, under the eyes of all those gentlemen at the
room's end.

<p>It was Cesare's aim to determine whether della Pieve's recusancy was
that of active or of passive enmity. If passive, the man might go his
ways; but if active, Cesare must know more of it. And meanwhile he had
been gathering information.

<p>He had ascertained that Gianluca della Pieve had quitted Assisi on the
eve of his own arrival, and had returned upon the morrow of that event,
bringing with him a very beautiful lady, a kinswoman of his, it was
put about. That lady was lodged in his palace, and was shown a great
deference by her attendants.

<p>Such was the sum of Cesare's information. Slight in itself; most
certainly too slight to have aroused the least suspicion against della
Pieve, had he but come to take the oath. Viewed, however, in the light
of that recusancy and in conjunction with the sudden pallor of the
beauty in the litter at sight of Cesare, his Highness judged that there
was matter to be proved. And now he had della Pieve's confused and
guilty bearing to confirm him in that judgment.

<p>As the Assisian offered no explanation, Cesare passed to questions.

<p>"Although you are one of the first citizens of Assisi, you were not
among the <i>Anziani</i> when the oath was taken on Sunday last," he said.
"I shall rejoice to hear your motives for that absence."

<p>"I&mdash;I was not in Assisi at the time, Magnificent," said della Pieve.

<p>"Ay&mdash;but dare you tell us where you were?" cried Cesare sharply&mdash;and
his tone was the tone of one who questions upon matters fully known
to him. "I do not wonder that you hesitate to answer," he added after
a moment's pause, and that completed Gianluca's assurance that his
movements were already known.

<p>"My lord," he faltered, "Count Guido was my father's friend. We owed
him many favours."

<p>Here was knowledge gained, and upon it Cesare built rapidly.

<p>"I am not quarrelling with your visit to Solignola," he said slowly,
and the stricken Gianluca never suspected that he, himself, had just
afforded the first intimation of that same visit. "Nor yet am I
quarrelling with your friendship for Count Guido. My displeasure is
with the motives that led you to seek him."

<p>That fresh vague random shot of Cesare's went home as had done the
others. Gianluca blenched. Plainly all was known.

<p>"My lord," he cried, "I swear before Heaven that I took no willing part
in any of the measures determined at Solignola."

<p>So! Measures had been determined at Solignola! Cesare turned it over
in his mind, recalled the fact that della Pieve had gone alone and had
returned accompanied by a lady&mdash;the lady of the litter, the lady who
had turned pale at the sight of him that day. Undoubtedly she was from
Solignola. It remained to ascertain her identity.

<p>"How am I to believe you?" he asked.

<p>Della Pieve clenched his hands. "I have, of course, no means of proving
what I say," he admitted miserably.

<p>"Indeed you have, sir. There is one proof you are overlooking."
Cesare's voice was very cold. "It is yours to use frankness with me
now, and so convince me of your honesty. Yet you are careful to tell
me nothing." His eyes narrowed, and again in that tone of one who is
possessed of the fullest knowledge: "Not even," he added, "in the
matter of this lady whom you fetched from Solignola with you on your
return."

<p>The Assisian recoiled as if he had been struck, unable to follow
the simple method of inference by which Cesare had arrived at the
conclusion that the lady was from Solignola, never dreaming that the
Duke was but groping for information, and assured that the identity of
Panthasilea must be known to this man with as many eyes as Argus.

<p>He took refuge at the last in falsehood, touching the motives of his
visit to Count Guido's stronghold. "Magnificent," he began by way of
preface, "since you know so much you will understand the rest."

<p>"My present aim," said Cesare, "is to test your honesty."

<p>Gianluca plunged headlong into the falsehoods he contemplated, praying
Heaven that Cesare's information might be sufficiently limited to admit
of his being believed.

<p>"Why, is it not natural, Excellency, that being determined upon this
resistance, Count Guido should have desired to place his daughter
in safety&mdash;to remove her from the perils and discomforts of a place
besieged? In my having given her the shelter of my house, is there
anything that reflects upon my honesty towards your Highness? I have
said that my father owed great favours to Count Guido. Could I, then,
do less than I have done?"

<p>Cesare stood surveying him, his face inscrutable. So! The lady was
Count Guido's daughter. That was valuable knowledge gained. But that
Count Guido's daughter should have come to Assisi&mdash;into Cesare's very
camp&mdash;to seek safety and shelter, was a foolish clumsy lie. Therefore
there must be some other motive for her presence, which Gianluca found
himself forced to withhold.

<p>Thus reasoned the Duke. And having formed his sound conclusions, he
shrugged and laughed scornfully.

<p>"Is this your honesty?" he asked. "Is it thus that you would prove that
you are not my enemy?"

<p>"It is the truth, my lord!"

<p>"It is a lie, I say," the Duke retorted, raising his voice for the
first time. "I am too well informed, sir, to be hoodwinked so easily."
Then dropping back to his calm, level tones: "You abuse my patience,
sir," he said, "and you forget that there are the rack and the hoist
below stairs with which I can force the truth from you if necessary."

<p>Gianluca's manhood rebelled at the threat. He braced himself by an
effort of will, and looked the Duke boldly between the eyes, sustained
by the courage of the desperate.

<p>"Neither hoist nor rack could extract another word from me," he said.
"For I have no more to tell."

<p>Cesare continued to ponder him in silence. He was not prone to needless
or fruitless cruelty. And he fancied that having learned so much
already, the rest might be discovered without resorting to the violence
of the rack. For the moment, however, it was plain that della Pieve
would say no more. He nodded slowly.

<p>"You have no more to tell me, eh? An ambiguous phrase, sir. But I think
I read its real meaning."

<p>He turned to the group about the hearth, which included the tall
captain Scipione. He beckoned the condottiero to him.

<p>"Baldassare," said he, "take Messer della Pieve hence, and place
him under arrest until I make known my pleasure. Let him be closely
confined with guards you can trust to allow him to commune with none."

<p>It was not Cesare's intention to run the risk of Panthasilea's learning
that her identity was known to him; for in that case the present gain
would all be wasted, and the true aim of her presence in Assisi remain
undiscovered.

<p>The matter intrigued Cesare Borgia not a little. He took counsel that
night with Agabito Gherardi, his shrewd, white-faced secretary; and
Agabito, though by nature a mild and kindly man, had no hesitation in
recommending that the torture should be employed to squeeze the last
drop of truth from Messer della Pieve.

<p>"We may come to it in the end," said Cesare. "But the moment, I fancy,
is not propitious. There was in this fellow's face this morning a look
as of willingness for martyrdom, which does not augur well. I infer
that he loves Count Guido's daughter, and, so, is strengthened in
obstinacy. What is at the bottom of it all I cannot even guess. I swear
it would baffle that crafty Florentine Secretary Machiavelli&mdash;which is
as much as to say the devil himself."

<p>And at that same hour Madonna Panthasilea degli Speranzoni was in
earnest talk with one of her faithful followers from Solignola, a
youth named Giovanni. Until tonight the manner of approaching her task
had baffled her completely, since della Pieve had failed her in her
original scheme. She had desired him to make pretence of loyalty to the
Duke, and to present her as his kinswoman, Eufemia Bracci of Spoleto.
But della Pieve, out of repugnance for the whole affair, had refused,
and so had thwarted her.

<p>But now that at last she had seen her man, and taken his measure as
much by his brave appearance as by the very ready gallantry expressed
in the obeisance to which the mere sight of her had moved him, she saw
her way; and she was laying her plans for the morrow with Giovanni.

<p>The morrow dawned fair and clear, a day that was more of April than
of February. A soft wind was blowing from the south, warm and subtly
fragrant, and from a cloudless, cobalt sky the sun shone genially upon
the plain of Umbria, and struck fire and silver from the tumbling
waters of the Tescio.

<p>It was at the ford, almost under the very walls of Assisi, that Cesare
Borgia, returning with a half-dozen gentlemen from an early morning
ride to the camp under Solignola, came suddenly and unexpectedly upon
Madonna Panthasilea.

<p>She was seated upon the ground in a forlorn and dejected attitude,
resting her shoulders against a grey boulder that had partly concealed
her from the Duke's eyes until he was abreast of her. She was
dressed in that bright russet gown in which you beheld her at her
father's council; cut low in the bodice it revealed the perfection
of her throat, the splendid column of her neck. Her bright hair was
partly unbound, and strands of it caught the breeze and fluttered
distractingly about her faintly-tinted cheeks. Her veil had fallen back
and slipped down on to her shoulders.

<p>In the meadow, at some little distance, a riderless mule was cropping
the short grass.

<p>At sight of her Cesare instantly swung himself from the saddle, and
she had leisure to admire the athletic ease of the movement and the
matchless grace of the man as he approached her, cap in hand, his long
bronze-coloured hair gleaming in the sunlight.

<p>At a glance he had recognised her; at a glance perceived the
plight&mdash;real or pretended&mdash;in which she found herself; and, however
that might be, he rejoiced in this chance to come to grips with her.

<p>He bowed profoundly, and she found herself looking into the gentlest
and most beautiful eyes that she had ever seen. The appeal to her
womanhood of this very perfect manhood, this splendid youth and
strength of which he was the incarnation, was instant and irresistible.
A pang shot through her at the thought of her task; her first qualm
beset her with that first glance of his. But it was no more than the
momentary outcry of her instincts under the shock of the encounter;
immediately reason's cold hand seized the reins of her will, and
governed it.

<p>"You are hurt, madonna," he murmured, in that gentle yet richly
melodious voice that was one of his greatest charms. "The mischance you
have suffered is very plain to see. Permit that we assist you?"

<p>She smiled at him, and even as she smiled her mouth assumed a painful
twist and grew as quickly smooth again. "It is my ankle," she
complained, and put a hand to the injured limb.

<p>"It must be bound," said he, and swiftly loosed a scarf he wore about
his body.

<p>"No, no!" she cried&mdash;a cry of real alarm, as his sharp ears detected.
"My women will tend it when I reach home. It is not far."

<p>"Believe me," he insisted, "it should be bound at once."

<p>She crimsoned under his glance. She looked up piteously and very
beautiful, and made the crimsoning do service for a blush of virgin
modesty.

<p>"I implore you not to pain me by insisting," she pleaded. And he,
playing his part as she played hers, lowered his eyes in submission,
and shrugged his regret at such injudicious obstinacy.

<p>She proceeded to tell him how she came in such a plight. "My mule had
crossed the ford," she said, "and was mounting the hither bank when it
slipped upon those stones, came down upon its knees and threw me off."

<p>He looked grave concern. "Ungracious beast," said he, "to cast off
so fair a burden!" And he added: "You should not ride forth alone,
madonna."

<p>"It is not my custom. But on such a morning, the spring I think was in
my soul, and I was athirst for freedom."

<p>"A dangerous thirst," said he, "the quenching of which has been the
death of many. You should have considered all the Borgia soldiery
a-swarm about the countryside."

<p>"What should I fear from them?" she asked him, bewitchingly innocent,
her eyes wide. "You, yourself, are one&mdash;are you not? Must I then fear
you?"

<p>"Ah, madonna," he cried, "'tis you fill me with fear."

<p>"I?" quoth she, lips parting in a half-smile.

<p>"Fear for this same freedom which you seem to prize, and which I prize
no less. What man can account himself free who has met your glance?
What man can be other than a slave thereafter?"

<p>She laughed lightly as she turned aside that thrust in the high lines.
"Why, here's a courtier," said she. "And I deemed you but a soldier."

<p>"I am a courtier here, madonna," he said, bowing low before her.
"Elsewhere I am the Duke."

<p>He watched the pretty play of feigned surprise upon her face; the
simulated sudden confusion. "The Duke&mdash;you!"

<p>"Your slave," said he.

<p>"My lord, I have been blind&mdash;very blind. It had been better had I been
as dumb. What must you deem me?"

<p>He looked at her, and sighed. "Life is so short! I should not find it
long enough to tell you."

<p>She flushed again under his burning gaze; for despite suspicion and
all else he found her&mdash;as all men must&mdash;very good to see; and his
admiration showed clearly in his glance.

<p>"We are forgetting my poor foot, my lord," she reminded him. "And I
detain you. Perhaps one of your gentlemen will come to my assistance."

<p>"Nay, in this office I will not be supplanted. But one of them shall
fetch your mule." He turned, and sharply gave an order which sent his
gentlemen all spurring towards the grazing beast. "Can you rise with
help?" he asked her.

<p>"I think I could."

<p>He stooped, and crooked his arm. But she drew back. "Highness!" she
murmured in confusion, "It were too much honour! By your leave, I will
await one of your gentlemen."

<p>"Not one of them shall have my leave to help you," he said, laughing,
and again, insistently, he thrust his arm upon her notice.

<p>"From such masterful ways&mdash;how can I defend myself?" said she, and
taking his arm she rose painfully on her one sound foot; then lost her
balance, and fell heavily against him with a little cry.

<p>His arm flashed round her waist to steady her. Her hair lay an instant
against his cheek; the sweet fragrance of her filled his brain. She
murmured piteous excuses. He smiled, silent, and held her so until
the mule was brought. Then, without a word, he lifted her in his arms
as though she had been a child, and set her in the saddle. And the
strength of him amazed her, as it had amazed many another to more
hurtful purpose.

<p>One covert but very searching glance he bestowed upon the mule's
knees. As he had expected, they were smooth and glossy, and showed no
slightest hurt or stain. It left him no doubt that her ankle was in
like case, and with a little smile he turned and vaulted lightly into
his own saddle. Then, coming beside her, he took the bridle of her mule
in his right hand, and called to one of his gentlemen to protect her on
the other flank.

<p>"Thus, madonna, you will he safe," he assured her. "And now&mdash;forward!"

<p>They went down the short incline to the water, and splashed across the
ford, and so rode forward into Assisi. As they went, the Duke talked
lightly, and she responded with a ready tongue and many a sidelong
glance of admiration for his person and of pleasure in the flattering
homage of his words, which was not wholly feigned. As they were
entering the town, he asked her whither did she desire them to conduct
her.

<p>"To the house of my kinsman, Messer Gianluca della Pieve, by San
Rufino."

<p>Her kinsman! Here, considered Cesare, was more deception. How did she
propose to call herself, he wondered; and bluntly asked her.

<p>Her reply came readily. "I am Eufemia Bracci of Spoleto, your Highness'
devoted subject."

<p>He made no answer to Eufemia Bracci of Spoleto. But he smiled fondly
upon her, such a sweet, guileless smile as assured her that Gianpaolo
Baglioni had by much overrated his acuteness.

<p>At the door of della Pieve's house he took his leave of her. And at
the last moment, and purely out of malice, he promised to send his own
physician Torella to attend her; and he dissembled his amusement and
his perception of the sudden fear that leaped for a moment to her eyes.
She implored him not to think of it, assured him that a day's rest
would mend her foot, and she was obviously relieved that he took her
word for this, and did not insist.

<p>He rode away bemused, and once back at the Communale he sent for
Agabito Gherardi and told him what had passed, "And so, Agabito," he
concluded, "the Lady Panthasilea degli Speranzoni is here in Assisi,
calling herself Eufemia Bracci of Spoleto, the kinswoman of della
Pieve. She has thrust herself upon my notice, and sought to enlist my
interest and ensnare my senses. Can you read me this riddle?"

<p>Agabito's round white face was contemptuously placid. "It is extremely
simple," said he. "She is the bait in a trap that has been set for you."

<p>"That, Agabito, is what I have been telling you. What I desire to know
is the nature of the trap itself. Can you hazard me a guess?"

<p>"The matter is too serious for guessing," replied the secretary,
unmoved. "If I might venture to advise you, Highness, it is that you
go armed abroad and with all precaution, and that you do not adventure
yourself within the doors of the Palazzo Pieve save with an ample
escort."

<p>Cesare opened his black doublet to show Agabito the gleam of the steel
mesh he wore beneath. "Armed I am," said he. "But for the rest of your
advice&mdash;" he shrugged. "There is a way of handling these traps so that
they close upon those who set them. There was such a trap prepared for
a man in Sinigaglia, not so long ago. But you know that story."

<p>"In that case, my lord, you had precise knowledge of what was intended."

<p>Cesare looked at the other, smiling cruelly. "Knowledge which the
torture wrung from Messer Ramiro de Lorqua," he said. "Bid them prepare
a hoist in the hall below, tonight; and let the executioner and his
assistants be summoned to await my pleasure."

<p>Agabito departed, and the Duke turned his mind to other matters. That
evening he sat late at supper with his gentlemen, and when he dismissed
them it was to closet himself with Agabito and his clerks and keep them
at work upon despatches for Rome and Florence until far into the night.

<p>Towards midnight he turned to Agabito to inquire had all been made
ready for the examination of della Pieve; and then, even as the
secretary was answering him, the door was opened and a servant entered
quickly.

<p>"What now?" demanded Cesare, frowning.

<p>"Soldiers from the camp under Solignola, Magnificent, with a prisoner."

<p>He raised his brows, surprised. "Admit them," he said. And a youth in
peasant garb and cross-gartered leggings, his hands pinioned behind
him, was led in between two men-at-arms. With them came a young officer
of Corella's, whom Cesare instantly addressed.

<p>"What is this?"

<p>The officer saluted.

<p>"We took this man, Magnificent, less than an hour ago, upon the slopes
under Solignola. He had eluded our sentries and was through our
lines, and but that in the dark he loosed a boulder, and so drew our
attention, he had gained the city. We found him to be the bearer of a
letter written in cipher. But Don Michele was unable to induce him to
say whence this letter or for whom."

<p>He handed Cesare a small square of paper the seal of which had already
been broken. The Duke took it, ran his eye over the array of baffling
ciphers, examined the seal, and finally bore the paper to his nose and
sniffed it. Very faintly he caught a fragrance that reminded him of a
woman in a bright russet gown; just such a fragrance had he inhaled
that morning during those brief moments in which she had lain in
simulated helplessness against his breast.

<p>He advanced towards the travestied messenger, his solemn eyes upon the
man's calm intrepid face.

<p>"At what hour," he asked quietly, "did Madonna Panthasilea degli
Speranzoni despatch you with this letter?"

<p>The man's countenance changed upon the instant. Its calm was swept away
by a consternation amounting to fear. He recoiled a step, and stared
wide-eyed at this Duke, who watched him with such awful impassiveness.

<p>"Men speak the truth of you!" he cried at last, carried away by his
excited feelings.

<p>"Rarely, my friend&mdash;believe me, very rarely." And the Duke smiled
wistfully. "But what have you heard?"

<p>"That you have made a compact with the devil."

<p>Cesare nodded. "It is as true as most things that are said of me. Take
him away," he bade the officer. "Let him be confined in strictest
solitude." Then to the youth: "You have nothing to fear," he said. "You
shall come by no harm, and your detention shall not exceed a week at
most."

<p>The youth was led out in tears&mdash;tears for the mistress whom he served,
persuaded that from this terrific Duke nothing was concealed.

<p>Cesare tossed the note to Agabito. "Transcribe it for me," he said
shortly.

<p>"It is in cipher," said Agabito, bewildered at the order.

<p>"But the key has been obligingly supplied. The last word is composed of
eleven numerals and of these the second, sixth and last are the same.
Assume that word to be 'Panthasilea'. It will simplify your task."

<p>Agabito said no more, but bent, quill in hand, over the letter, whilst
Cesare&mdash;a long scarlet figure in a furred robe that descended to his
ankles&mdash;thoughtfully paced the chamber.

<p>Soon the secretary rose, and handed Cesare the transcription.

<p class="letter">I engaged his attention at last this morning, and I have made an
excellent beginning. Within a few days now I count upon an opportunity
to carry out the business. I am prepared. But I shall proceed slowly,
risking nothing by precipitancy.&mdash;PANTHASILEA.

<p>Cesare read, and held the paper in a candle flame, reducing it to
ashes. "It tells no more than we already knew. But that much it
confirms. Mend the seal of the original, and let means be found to
convey it to Count Guido. Let one of my men replace the original
messenger, then let him pretend that he is wounded, and so induce some
rustic with a promise of good payment from Count Guido to bear the
letter to Solignola.

<p>"And let Corella be advised that he is to see to it that he captures no
more messengers at present. Thus he will find it easier to complete the
mine; for as long as the folk of Solignola depend upon my defeat here
in Assisi and believe it to be progressing, they are not likely to be
as vigilant as if they had but their own efforts to depend upon. And
now for Messer della Pieve. Let him be sent for."

<p>The Assisian gentleman had been confined in no dungeon. He was
comfortably lodged in one of the chambers of the palace; his bed and
board were such as befitted a gentleman of his station; and his gaolers
used him with all deference. Therefore it is no matter for marvel that
he slept soundly on the night in question.

<p>From that sleep he was rudely roused to find four men-at-arms in his
chamber, looking grim and fantastic in the light of the single smoky
torch that was held aloft by one of them.

<p>"You are to come with us," said the man whose heavy hand still rested
upon Gianluca's shoulder.

<p>Della Pieve sat up in alarm, blinking but wide-awake, his heart beating
tumultuously.

<p>"What is it?" he demanded in a quavering voice. "Whither must I go?"

<p>"With us, sir," was all the answer he received&mdash;the man who answered
him obeying to the letter the orders he had received.

<p>The poor gentleman looked fearfully from one to another of those
bearded faces, gloomy and mysterious in the shadows of their steel
morions. Then, resigning himself, he flung back the covers, and stepped
from the bed.

<p>A soldier cast a mantle over his shoulders, and said: "Come."

<p>"But my clothes? Am I not to dress?"

<p>"There is not the need, sir. Come."

<p>Frozen now with fear, assured that his last hour had struck, Gianluca
permitted them to conduct him barefoot as he was along chill passages,
down a dark staircase and into the very hall where yesterday he had
been given audience by the Duke.

<p>Into this was he now ushered, and so into a scene that Cesare had
carefully prepared with the object of torturing the man's soul&mdash;a
merciful object, after all, since thus he hoped to avoid the maiming of
his body.

<p>Ranged against the wall, midway up the chamber, stood a table draped
in black. At this sat the black figure of the questioner, gowned and
cowled like a monk. He was flanked by a clerk on either hand, and
before each of these were paper, ink-horns and quills. On the table
stood two candle-branches, each bearing a half-dozen candles. There
was no other light in that great vaulted chamber, so that the greater
portion of it remained mysteriously in shadow.

<p>On the hearth at the room's far end stood an iron tripod supporting a
brazier in which the charcoal was glowing brightly. Thrust into the
heart of this fire Gianluca observed with a shudder some wooden-handled
implements to be heating.

<p>Across the chamber, facing the questioner's table, grey ropes, like
the filaments of some gigantic cobweb, dangled from pulleys that were
scarcely visible in the upper gloom of the groined ceiling&mdash;the torture
of the hoist. By these ropes stood two men in leathern vests, their
muscular, hairy arms bared to the shoulder. A third man, similarly
dressed, stood in the foreground making knots in a length of whipcord.

<p>In mid-chamber&mdash;the one spot of colour in all that hideous
greyness&mdash;stood Cesare Borgia in his long scarlet gown, thumbs hooked
into his silken girdle, a scarlet cap upon his head. His eyes were
indefinitely sad and wistful as they rested now upon Gianluca.

<p>The young Assisian stood there and looked about him in dread
fascination. He knew now to what purpose he had been awakened and
dragged from his bed. He fought for air for a moment; the beating
of his heart was stifling him. He reeled, and was steadied by the
leathern-clad arm of one of the soldiers.

<p>No word had been spoken, and the silence entered into alliance with
the chill breath of the place, with the gloom and with the horror
of preparations indistinctly revealed, to make the scene appear to
Gianluca as some horrific nightmare. Then at a sign from Cesare, the
executioner's assistants advanced, almost silent-footed, to receive the
patient from the soldiers. These surrendered him and clattered out.

<p>Gianluca was led forward to the table, and stood there between his two
fearsome guards to face the questioner.

<p>From the depths of the cowl a cold voice spoke, and to Gianluca it
seemed to ring and boom through the vaulted place.

<p>"Messer Gianluca della Pieve," said the voice, "you are guilty
of having conspired with Count Guido degli Speranzoni, Tyrant of
Solignola, against the High and Mighty Lord Cesare Borgia, Duke of
Valentinois and Romagna; and of having prepared here in Assisi a
pitfall for this same High and Mighty Lord. Thereby you have deserved
death. But worse than death have you deserved when it is considered
that his highness is Gonfalonier of Holy Church, that the battles he
fights are the battles of Holy See. Therefore have you sinned not only
against the Duke's Magnificence, but against God and His Earthly Vicar,
our Holy Father the Pope. Yet since the Church has said: <i>'Nolo mortem
peccatoris, sed ut magis convertatur et vivat,'</i> his Highness in our
Holy Father's name desires to spare you so that you make frank and full
confession of your sin."

<p>The booming voice ceased; yet echoes of it still reverberated through
the tortured brain of Gianluca. He stood there, swaying, feebly
considering his course. He hung his head.

<p>"Look behind you," the voice bade him, "and behold for yourself that we
do not lack the means to unseal your lips should you prove obstinate."

<p>But Gianluca did not look. He did not need to look. He shivered;
but still said no word The questioner made a sign. One of the
executioners whipped the cloak from Gianluca's shoulders, and left
that poor gentleman standing in his shirt. He felt himself seized by
strong&mdash;cruelly strong&mdash;hands. They turned him about, and dragged him
across the room towards the hoist. Midway he hung back, throwing his
entire weight upon their arms to check them.

<p>"No, no!" he pleaded through ashen lips.

<p>Suddenly the Duke spoke. "Wait!" he said and, stepping forward, barred
their way. He waved his hand, and the executioners fell back, leaving
Gianluca alone with his Highness in mid-apartment.

<p>"Messer della Pieve," said Cesare gently, and he placed a hand upon the
Assisian's shoulder, "consider what you do; consider what is before
you. I do not think the questioner has made that clear enough. You
have seen the hoist at work; you have perhaps seen it wrench a man's
shoulders from their sockets." And his steely fingers tightened about
the shoulder that he held, until it seemed to Gianluca that a thousand
threads of fire were coursing down his arm. He gasped in pain, and the
Duke's grip at once relaxed. Cesare smiled&mdash;a smile of tender, infinite
pity.

<p>"Consider by that how little you are fitted to endure the cord. Be
assured that you will speak in the end. And what do you think would
follow? Your release? Indeed, no. If once the cords of the hoist have
grappled you, you become the property of the law; and when the law has
made you speak, it will silence you for ever. Consider that. From the
agonies of a broken body your release lies through the hangman's hands.
Consider that you are young&mdash;that life has much to offer you, and
consider above all that your silence will profit no one, your speech
betray no one that is not betrayed already&mdash;that your obstinacy will
lead you to sacrifice yourself for no useful purpose."

<p>Gianluca's eyes looked piteously at the Duke from out of his ashen face.

<p>"If&mdash;if I could believe that!" he murmured.

<p>"It is easy to convince you, and in convincing you of that I shall
convince you also of my own disinterestedness in seeking to save you
even now.

<p>"Learn, then, that Madonna Panthasilea degli Speranzoni has already
spread her net for me; that today she thrust herself upon my notice;
that tonight she sent a letter to her father informing him of this
good beginning and that within a week she looks to accomplish her
treacherous work and take me in her toils.

<p>"Knowing so much already, am I likely to fall a victim to this thing
they plan? Can anything that you may add be of so much moment that you
should suffer torture and death sooner than reveal it?"

<p>Gianluca shivered. "What do you desire to know?" he asked. "What can
I add? You seem already to know all&mdash;more even than do I. Or is it,"
he added in sudden apprehension, "that you seek my evidence to use it
against this lady?"

<p>"Already have I all the evidence I need, were such my aim. There is
the letter which she wrote her father. That alone would doom her did
I desire it. No, no. All that I seek to learn from you is the precise
nature of this trap that has been prepared. You will see that in
telling me that you can no longer do any hurt to Count Guido or his
daughter."

<p>"Why&mdash;if that is all&mdash;"

<p>"That is all," said Cesare. "A little thing. And there stands the
horrible alternative awaiting you. Could I be more generous? Speak, and
you may return to bed; I shall hold you a prisoner for caution's sake
until Solignola falls. Then you may go your ways in perfect freedom. I
pledge you my word for that. Be silent, and&mdash;" He waved a hand to the
grey cords of the hoist, and shrugged.

<p>That was the end of della Pieve's silence. He saw clearly that no
purpose could be served by persisting in it; that he would but
sacrifice himself in vain&mdash;and this for a woman who had deemed his love
presumptuous and had used him with so little mercy, So he told the Duke
the little thing his Highness sought to know&mdash;that his abduction was
the purpose of the conspiracy, the aim for which Madonna Panthasilea
was in Assisi.

<p>Towards noon upon the morrow a very dainty page in the Duke's livery
came to della Pieve's house bearing a scented letter in Cesare's own
hand, wherein his Highness like the humblest suitor, craved permission
to come in person and receive news of Madonna Eufemia Bracci.

<p>Panthasilea's eyes sparkled as she read. Her plans were speeding
marvellously. Fortune for once was arrayed against this Cesare Borgia
whose proverbial luck had caused him to be dubbed <i>Filius Fortunae</i>.

<p>The permission his Highness sought she very readily accorded, and so it
fell out that the Borgia came in person some few hours later. Leaving
his splendid cavalcade to await him in the little square, he went alone
into her house.

<p>He came magnificently arrayed, as a suitor should. His doublet was of
cloth of gold; milk-white one silken hose, sky-blue the other, and the
girdle and carriages of his sword were ablaze with jewels worth many a
principality.

<p>He found her in a chamber whose window doors opened upon the topmost
of the garden's several terraces, and it was a room that was a worthy
setting for so rare a gem. Eastern carpets were spread upon the
mosaic floor, rich tapestries arrayed the walls; books and a lute
stood upon an ebony table that was inlaid with ivory figures. By the
fireplace two of her women were at work upon the embroidering of an
altar-cloth, whilst madonna, herself, reclined upon a low couch of
Eastern pattern. A subtle fragrance hung upon the air&mdash;the bittersweet
of lilac essences, a trace of which he had yesternight detected in the
intercepted letter.

<p>Upon his entrance she made as if to rise; but in that he checked her.
With sweet concern he forbade the effort, and swiftly crossed the room
to stay her by force if need be; whereupon she sank back, smiling.

<p>She was all in white, coiffed in a golden net from which a sapphire,
large as a bean, hung upon her brow.

<p>One of her women hastened to approach a low chair of antique design,
whose feet, carved in the form of the lion's paw, were of solid silver.
He sat, and solicitously inquired how fared madonna's ankle, to receive
her assurance that by tomorrow it should bear her weight again.

<p>Their interview was brief, perforce, and flavoured by hints from him
of the deep regard he had conceived for her; it was confined to pretty
play of courtly speeches, a game of fence at which Madonna Eufemia
Bracci of Spoleto showed herself no novice.

<p>And yet, tightly strung to her task though she was, she feasted her
eyes upon the rare grace and beauty of his resplendent presence,
nor repelled the dangerous rapture which his haunting eyes and soft
melodious voice aroused in her.

<p>When at length he departed, he left her very thoughtful.

<p>On the morrow he returned, and again upon the following day; and ever
did the cavalcade await him in the square below. The game began to
interest him beyond all his expectations. This thrusting of his head
into the lion's maw afforded him sensations such as he had never yet
experienced; this hunting the hunters, this befooling the befoolers,
was no new thing to him, but never had he engaged upon it under
circumstances more entertaining.

<p>On the occasion of his third visit he found her alone, her women having
been dismissed before his entrance. Wondering what fresh move in the
game might this portend, he dropped upon one knee to thank her for the
signal favour of it, and bore her fragrant hand to his devout lips. But
her face was very grave, and for the first time she surprised him.

<p>"My lord," she said, "you mistake me. I have dismissed my women because
I had that to say to you which you must prefer that I say without
witnesses. My lord, you must visit me no more."

<p>For once in his life he was so astonished that he permitted his
countenance to reflect his feelings. Yet she mistook for chagrin the
sudden change she saw there.

<p>"I must visit you no more, madonna!" he cried, and his accents
confirmed her impression. "How have I offended? Tell me, that on my
knees, here at your feet, I may atone."

<p>Gently she shook her head, gazing down upon him with a tender sadness.
"How should you have offended, my lord? Rise, I implore you."

<p>"Not until I know my sin." And his eyes were the eyes of the humblest
suppliant at a shrine.

<p>"You have not sinned, my lord. It is&mdash;" She bit her lip; a gentle
colour warmed her cheek. "It is that I&mdash;I must think of my good name.
Oh, have patience with me, Highness. You will make me the talk of this
scandal-mongering town if daily your escort is seen awaiting you below
whilst you come to visit me."

<p>At last he understood the fiendish subtlety at work within that lovely
head. "And is that all?" he cried. "Is there no other reason&mdash;none?"

<p>"What other reason should there be?" she murmured, eyes averted.

<p>"Why, then, it is soon remedied. In future I will come alone."

<p>She pondered a moment, and gently shook her head. "Best not, my lord.
Indeed, that were worse. You would be seen to enter. And coming
thus&mdash;oh, what would folks not say?"

<p>He sprang up, and boldly put an arm about her. She suffered it, but he
felt the shudder that ran through her. "Does it matter&mdash;what they say?"
quoth he.

<p>"Not&mdash;not to you, my lord. But me&mdash;consider me. What is a maid's fair
name once it is blown upon by scandal?"

<p>"There&mdash;there is a back way&mdash;by your garden. Thus none would see me.
Give me the key, Eufemia."

<p>Under lowered lids he watched her face, saw what he looked for, and
released her. Inwardly he smiled. He was the very prince of amorous
boobies, of love-lorn fools&mdash;the most obliging numskull that ever
dashed into a trap prepared for him. So was she thinking, not a doubt,
in a mental glow at the subtleties of her poor strategy.

<p>She stood trembling before him. "My lord, I&mdash;I&mdash;dare not."

<p>So much fencing began to nauseate him; the daring of it amounted to
folly and moved him to some contempt. He grew cold upon the instant.

<p>"So be it, then," said he. "I will not come again."

<p>He reduced her now to terror. He saw the quick alarm that leapt to
her dark eyes. He admired her swift recovery of a situation that was
slipping from her grasp.

<p>"My lord, you are angry with me." She hid her face on his shoulder.
"You shall have the key," she murmured.

<p>He departed with it, persuaded that she was the most callous, heartless
traitress that had ever drawn the breath of life. He might have thought
differently had he seen her as she sat there after his departure,
weeping bitterly and reviling herself most cruelly. And yet that night
she wrote to her father to tell him that all was speeding excellently,
and that the end was near.

<p>And Solignola, lulled more and more by these messages and by the
desultory manner in which the siege was being conducted, kept but
indifferent watch. They heard at times the blows of picks under the
southern wall of the citadel, and they knew that Corella's men were at
work there. But they no longer sallied to disperse them, deeming it but
an idle waste of life now that another and more effective method of
checkmate was all but in their grasp.

<p>The following afternoon was well advanced when Cesare Borgia tapped
upon the window doors of the room in which it was Panthasilea's custom
to receive him. He found her alone; and there was some confusion in her
manner of receiving him now that he came in secret, as a lover avowed.
But he was that day the very incarnation of discretion.

<p>They talked of many things that afternoon, and presently their talk
drifting by the way of the verse of Aquilano to the writings of
Sperulo, who had followed Cesare's banner as a soldier, the Duke fell
into reminiscences. He spoke of himself for once, and of his task in
Italy and his high aims; and as he talked, her erstwhile wonder at
the difference betwixt what she found in him and what she had looked
for, arose again. He was, she had been told, a man compounded of
craft and ambition; harsh, unscrupulous, terrible to foe and friend
alike; a man devoid of heart, and therefore pitiless. She found him so
gentle, courtly, and joyous, and of so rare a sweetness of thought and
speech that she was forced to ask herself, might not envy of his great
achievements and his strength be the true source of the hatred in which
he was held by those upon whom he warred.

<p>A tall-necked Venetian flagon of sweet Puglia wine stood that afternoon
upon the table, having been left there by her women; and, moved by an
impulse she could scarce explain, she poured a cup for him when towards
dusk he rose to take his leave. He came to stand beside her by the
table whilst she brimmed the goblet, and when she would have filled
another for herself, he covered the vessel with his hands.

<p>It was as if some of the passion latent in him, at which, as if despite
him, his ardent glance had hinted none too seldom, leaped of a sudden
forth.

<p>"Nay, nay," said he, his great eyes full upon her, their glancing
seeming to envelop her, and hold her as in a spell. "One cup for us
twain, I do beseech you, lady, unworthy though I be. Pledge me, and
leave on the wine the fragrance of your lips ere I pledge you in my
turn. And if I reel not hence ecstatically, divinely drunk, why, then I
am a clod of earth."

<p>She demurred a little, but his will made sport with hers as does the
breeze in autumn with the leaf; and he watched her the while for all
the hot passion that seemed to film his eyes. For he was acquainted
with drugged wines, and such pretty artifices, and had no fancy for
unnecessary risks in this game that he was playing.

<p>But this wine was innocent. She drank, and handed him the cup. He bent
his knee to receive it, and drained it, kneeling, his eyes upon her
face.

<p>Thereafter he took his leave of her, and she stood at the window
looking after his departing figure as it descended the garden and was
merged at last into the thickening gloom. Then she shivered, a sob
broke from her quivering lips, and she sank limp into a chair, again
as yesterday to fall a-weeping for no reason in the world that was
apparent.

<p>And again that night she wrote to the Count, her father, that all was
going better than she could have dared to hope, and that within three
days she looked to place in the hands of those who waited that which
should enable them to purchase the emancipation of Solignola.

<p>He came again upon the morrow, and upon the morrow of that again; and
now Count Guido's daughter entered upon a season of sore experiences.
In Cesare's absence she ripened her plans for his ultimate capture; in
his presence she was all numb, fascinated by him, filled with horror
and self-loathing at her task, the very creature of his will.

<p>At last was reached that fateful evening that had been settled for
the Judas deed. He came at nightfall, as she had begged him&mdash;urging
her request as an added precaution against scandal&mdash;and he found her
awaiting him in the gloom, no other light in the chamber save that of
the logs that blazed upon the hearth. He took her hand and bore it to
his lips. It was ice-cold and trembled in the clasp of his as trembled
all her body now. He scanned her face and saw that it was drawn, for
all that its pallor was dissembled by the ruddy firelight. He saw
that she could not bear his gaze, and so concluded&mdash;as already he had
suspected&mdash;that the snare was to be sprung tonight.

<p>"Eufemia!" he cried. "My Eufemia, how cold you are!"

<p>She shivered at the endearment, at the soft caress of his voice, the
pleading ardour of his eyes. "It&mdash;it is very chill," she faltered. "The
wind is in the north."

<p>He turned from her and crossed again to the windows, her glance
following him. He drew the heavy curtains close, and shut out what
little daylight yet lingered in the sky.

<p>"So," he said, "it will be more snug within."

<p>He was dressed from head to foot in the warm red-brown of leaves in
autumn; and as he stood there against the dark background of the
curtains, the red light of the logs, playing over the smooth velvet of
his doublet and the shimmering silk of his hose, turned him into a man
of flame; and of shifting liquid fire seemed the girdle of gold scales
that clasped his waist.

<p>Tall, majestic, and magnificently lithe and graceful, he seemed to her
now the very embodiment of perfect manhood. More than man he seemed in
the fantastic, ardent panoply he borrowed from the firelight.

<p>He moved, and fire glowed and shot, quivered, vanished and gleamed
again along his scaly girdle. He took her hands and drew her down
beside him on the Eastern settle, out of the firelight's direct range,
yet so that her face remained illumined.

<p>She submitted despite herself. All her instincts cried out against this
dangerous propinquity, thus in the flame-lit gloom.

<p>"I&mdash;I will call for lights," she faltered, but made no attempt to rise
or to disengage the hand he held.

<p>"Let be," he answered gently. "There is light enough, and I have not
long to stay."

<p>"Ah?" she breathed the question and felt her heart-beats quickening.

<p>"But a moment; and I am more grieved since it is my last evening here
with you."

<p>He noted the guilty start, the sudden spasm of fear that rippled across
her face, the quivering half-stifled voice in which she asked: "But
why?"

<p>"I am the slave of harsh necessity," he explained.

<p>"Work awaits me. Tomorrow at dawn we deliver the final assault which is
to carry Solignola."

<p>Here was news for her. It seemed that not an hour too soon had she
resolved to act.

<p>"You&mdash;are certain that it will be final?" she questioned, intrigued by
his assurance, eager to know more.

<p>He smiled with confidence. "You shall judge," said he. "There is a
weakness in the walls to the south under the hill, spied out from the
commencement by Corella. Since then we have spent the time in mining
at that spot; and there has been during these last days an odd lack
of vigilence on the part of Count Guido's followers. Solignola seems
as a town lulled by some false hope. This has served us well. Our
preparations are complete. At dawn we fire the mine, and enter through
the breach."

<p>"So that I shall see you no more," said she, feeling that something
she must say. And then, whether urged to make-believe or by sheer
femininity, she continued: "Will you ever think again, I wonder, when
you pass on to further conquests, of poor Eufemia Bracci and her
loneliness in Spoleto?"

<p>He leaned towards her, his head thrust forward; and his eyes, glowing
in the half-light, looked deeply into hers, so deeply that she grew
afraid, thinking he must see the truth in the very soul of her. Then
he rose, and moved away a step or two until he stood in the full glow
of the fire, one velvet-shod foot on the andiron. Outside the window
he had heard the gravel crunch. Someone was moving there. Her men, no
doubt.

<p>He stood awhile like a man deep in thought, and she watched him with
something in her face that he would have found baffling had he seen
it. Her right hand was playing fretfully about her throat and heaving
bosom, betraying by its piteous movements the stifling feeling that
oppressed her.

<p>Suddenly he turned to her. "Shall I come back to you, my Eufemia?" he
asked in a hushed but very ardent voice. "Would you have it so?" And he
flung out his arms to her.

<p>Her glance upraised met his own, and her senses reeled under those
imperious eyes instinct with a passion that seemed to enwrap her as in
a mesh of fire. Suddenly she began to weep.

<p>"My lord, my dear lord!" she sobbed.

<p>She rose slowly, and stood there swaying, a poor broken thing whelmed
by a sudden longing for the shelter of those outstretched arms,
yet horribly afraid, with a mysterious fear, and filled too with
self-loathing for the treachery she had plotted. Once it had seemed to
her that she did a noble and a glorious thing. Now of a sudden, in the
very hour of accomplishment, she saw it vile beyond all vileness.

<p>"Eufemia, come!" he bade her.

<p>"Ah, no, no," she cried, and hid her burning face in her trembling
hands.

<p>He advanced, and touched her. "Eufemia!" The appeal in his voice was a
seduction irresistible.

<p>"Say&mdash;say that you love me," she pleaded piteously, urged to demand it
by her last remaining shred of self-respect&mdash;for in all their communion
hitherto not one word of love had he included in the homage he had paid
her.

<p>He laughed softly. "That is a bombardment with which any clown may win
a citadel," said he. "I ask a free surrender."

<p>His arms went round her as she fell sobbing on his breast, willing and
unwilling, between gladness and terror. She was crushed against him;
his lips were scorching hers. Her sobs were stifled. If to her eyes he
had seemed a thing of flame a moment since, to her senses now he was
live fire&mdash;a fire that seared its way through every vein and nerve of
her, leaving ecstatic torture in its wake.

<p>Thus they clung; and the leaping firelight made one single and gigantic
shadow of them upon wall and ceiling.

<p>Then he gently disengaged the arms that had locked themselves about his
neck, and gently put her from him.

<p>"And now, farewell," he said. "I leave my soul with you. My body must
elsewhere."

<p>At that, remembering her men who waited in the garden, her terror rose
about her like a flood. She clutched his breast. "No, no!" she cried
hoarsely, eyes wide in horror.

<p>"Why, what is this?" he protested, smiling; and so sobered her.

<p>"My lord," she panted, controlling herself as best she could. "Ah, not
yet, my lord!"

<p>She was mad now. She knew not what she said, nor cared. Her only aim
was to keep him there&mdash;to keep him there. He must not be taken, Her
men must be dismissed. She must tell him. How, she knew not; but she
must confess; she must warn him, that he might save himself. So ran her
thoughts in a chaotic turbulence.

<p>"I know not when I may see you next. You ride at dawn. Cesare, give me
an hour&mdash;a little hour."

<p>She sank down, still clutching the furred edge of his doublet. "Sit
here beside me awhile. There is something&mdash;something I must say before
you go."

<p>Obediently he sank down beside her. His left arm went round her and
again he drew her close. "Say on, sweet lady," he murmured, "or be
silent at your pleasure. Since you bid me stay, that is enough for me.
I stay, though Solignola remain unconquered for tomorrow."

<p>But in surrendering to his clasp once more, her courage left her; it
oozed away, leaving her no words in which to say the thing she longed
to say. A sweet languor enthralled her as she lay against his breast.

<p>Time sped. The logs hissed and cackled, and the play of firelight
gradually diminished. The flames lessened and died down, and under a
white crust of ash the timbers settled to a blood-red glow that lighted
but a little space and left black shadow all about the lovers.

<p>At long length, with a sigh, the young Duke gently rose, and moved into
the little lighted space.

<p>"The hour is sped&mdash;and more," said he.

<p>From the shadows a sigh answered his own, followed by the hiss of a
quickly indrawn breath. "You must not leave me yet," she said. "A
moment&mdash;give me a moment more."

<p>He stooped, took up the iron, and quickened the smouldering fire,
thrusting into the heart of it a half-burned log or two that had
escaped consumption. Flames licked out once more; and now he could
discern her huddled there, chin in palms, her face gleaming ghostly
white in the surrounding gloom.

<p>"You love me?" she cried. "Say that you love me, Cesare. You have not
said it yet."

<p>"Does it still need words?" he asked, and she accounted that caress of
his voice sufficient answer.

<p>She hid her face in her hands and fell a-sobbing. "Oh, I am vile! Vile!"

<p>"What are you saying, sweet?"

<p>"It is time that you knew," she said, with an effort at control. "A
while ago you might have heard steps out yonder had you listened.
There are assassins in the garden, awaiting you, brought here by my
contriving."

<p>He did not stir, but continued to look down upon her, and in the
firelight she saw that he smiled; and it flashed upon her that so
great was his faith in her, he could not believe this thing she told
him&mdash;conceived, perhaps, that she was jesting.

<p>"It is true," she cried, her hands working spasmodically. "I was sent
hither to lure you into capture that you may be held as a hostage for
the safety of Solignola."

<p>He seemed slightly to shake his head, his smile enduring still.

<p>"All this being so, why do you tell me?"

<p>"Why? Why?" she cried, her eyes dilating in her white face. "Do you not
see? Because I love you, Cesare, and can no longer do the thing I came
to do."

<p>Still there was no change in his demeanour, save that his smile grew
sweeter and more wistful. She was prepared for horror, for anger or
for loathing from him; but for nothing so terrible as this calm, fond
smile. She watched it, drawing back in fascinating horror, as she would
not have drawn back from his poniard had he made shift to kill her for
her treachery. Sick and faint she reclined there, uttering no word.

<p>Then, smiling still, Cesare took a taper from the over-mantel, and
thrust it into the flame.

<p>"Do not make a light!" she pleaded piteously; and, seeing that he did
not heed her, she hid her scarlet face in her hands.

<p>He held the flame of the taper to each of a cluster of candles in the
branch that stood upon the table. In the mellow light he surveyed her a
moment in silence&mdash;smiling still. Then he took up his cloak, and flung
it about him. Without another word he stepped towards the window.

<p>It was clear to her that he was going; going without word of reproach
or comment; and the contempt of it smote her cruelly.

<p>"Have you nothing to say?" she wailed.

<p>"Nothing," he answered, pausing, one hand already upon the curtains.

<p>Under the spur of pain, under the unbearable lash of his contempt, a
sudden mad revulsion stirred within her.

<p>"The men are still there," she reminded him, a fierce menace in her
tone.

<p>His answer seemed to shatter her wits. "So, too, are mine, Panthasilea
degli Speranzoni."

<p>Crouching, she stared at him, and a deathly pallor slowly overspread
a face that shame and anger had so lately warmed. "You knew?" she
breathed.

<p>"From the hour I met you," answered he.

<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;why&mdash;?" she faltered brokenly, leaving her sentence for
his quick wit's completing.

<p>At last he raised his voice, and it rang like stricken bronze.

<p>"The lust of conquest," he answered, smiling fiercely. "Should I, who
have brought a dozen states to heel, fail to reduce me Count Guido's
daughter? I set myself to win this duel against you and your woman's
arts, and your confession, when it came, should be the admission that I
was conqueror in your heart and soul as I am conqueror elsewhere."

<p>Then he dropped back into his habitual, level tones. "For the rest," he
said, "such was their confidence in you up there in Solignola that they
relaxed their vigilance and afforded me the time I needed to prepare
the mine. That purpose, too, I had to serve."

<p>The curtain-rings clashed, as he bared the windows.

<p>She struggled to her feet, one hand to her brow, the other to her heart.

<p>"And I, my lord?" she asked in a strangled voice. "What fate do you
reserve for me?"

<p>He considered her in the golden light. "Lady," said he, "I leave you
the memories of this hour."

<p>He unlatched the window doors, and thrust them wide. A moment he stood
listening, then drew a silver whistle, and blew shrilly upon it.

<p>Instantly the garden was astir with scurrying men who had lain
ambushed. Across the terrace one came bounding towards him.

<p>"Amedeo," he said, "you will make prisoners what men are lurking here."

<p>One last glance he cast at the white crouching figure behind him, then
passed into the darkness, and without haste departed.

<p>At dawn the mine was fired, and through the breach Solignola was
carried by assault, and Cesare the conqueror sat in the citadel of the
Speranzoni.

<hr><h2><a name="ch7"></a>7. THE PASQUINADE</h2>

<p>THE lute strings throbbed under the touch of the fair-haired stripling
in green and gold. His fresh young voice was singing Messer Francesco
Petrarca's madrigal:

<p class="poem">"Non al suo amante piu Diana piacque<br>
Quando, per tal ventura, tutta ignuda<br>
La vide in mezzo delle gelide acque;"

<p>At this point, and inspired perhaps by the poet's words, Cardinal
Farnese&mdash;that handsome voluptuary&mdash;leaned over the Princess of
Squillace, sighing furiously and whispering things which none might
overhear.

<p>The scene was the spacious Pontifical Chamber of the Vatican&mdash;the
Sala dei Pontefici&mdash;with its wide semicircular colonnade overlooking
the beautiful gardens of the Belvedere, and its wonderfully frescoed
ceiling where panels recording the deeds of popes hung amid others
depicting the gods of pagan fable. There was Jupiter wielding his
thunderbolts; there Apollo driving the chariot of the Sun; there Venus
and her team of doves, Diana and her nymphs, Ceres and her wheat
sheaves; and there Mercury in his winged cap, and Mars in all the
panoply of battle. Inter-wrought were the signs of the Zodiac and the
emblems of the seasons.

<p>The time was early autumn, when cooler breezes begin to waft away
the pestilential humours that overhang the plain of Rome during the
sweltering period of Sol in Leo.

<p>A vast concourse thronged the noble apartment&mdash;an ever shifting
kaleidoscope of gorgeous human fragments&mdash;the purple of prelates, the
grey steel of soldiers, the silks of rustling courtiers of both sexes,
as many-hued as the rainbow itself, and here and there the sober black
of clerks and of ambassadors.

<p>At the chamber's farthest end, on a low dais, sat the imposing figure
of Roderigo Borgia, Ruler of the World, Father of Fathers, under the
title of Alexander VI. He was robed in the pontifical white, the white
house-cap upon his great head. Although in his seventy-second year, he
retained a vigour that was miraculous, and seemed a man still in his
very prime. There was a fire in the dark, Spanish eyes&mdash;eyes that still
retained much of that erstwhile dangerous magnetism whereof Gasparino
da Verano wrote so eloquently some years ago&mdash;a ring in the rich voice
and an upright carriage in the tall, full figure that argued much youth
still lingering in this amazing septuagenarian.

<p>Near him, on the stools upon which the Teutonic Master of Ceremonies
had, with his own hands, placed cushions covered with cloth of gold,
sat the lovely, golden-haired Lucrezia Borgia, and the no less lovely,
no less golden Giulia Farnese, named by her contemporaries Giulia La
Bella.

<p>Lucrezia, in a stomacher stiff with gold brocade and so encrusted
with gems of every colour as to lend her a splendour almost barbaric,
watched the scene before her and listened to the boy's song with a rapt
expression in her blue eyes, her fan of ostrich plumes moving slowly in
her jewelled fingers. She was in her twenty-second year, divorced of
one husband and widowed of the other yet preserving a singular and very
winsome childishness of air.

<p>In the corner of the room, on the far right hand of the dais, her
brother Giuffredo, Prince of Squillace, a slim, graceful, pale-faced
youth, stood gnawing his lip, his brows contracted in a frown as he
watched his Aragonese wife, who, in the distance, was shamelessly
wantoning with Farnese.

<p>A certain bold beauty was this Donna Sancia's endowment, despite the
sallowness of her skin, a tint that was emphasised by the ruddiness of
her henna-dyed hair. She was something fleshy, with full red lips and
large liquid eyes of deepest brown, low-lidded and languorous, which
of themselves betrayed her wanton nature and justified her husband's
constant torture of jealousy.

<p>But with all this our concern is slight. It is no more than the
setting of another tragi-comedy of jealousy that was being played that
afternoon in the Sala dei Pontefici.

<p>Over by the colonnade, Beltrame Severino, a tall, black-browed
gentleman of Naples, was leaning against one of the pillars, apparently
concerned with the singing-boy and the company in the chamber, in
reality straining his jealous ears to catch what was passing between
a youth and a maid who stood apart from the rest, in the loggia that
overlooked the gardens.

<p>The youth was one Messer Angelo d'Asti, a fair-headed son of Lombardy,
who had come to Rome to seek his fortune, and was installed as
secretary to the Cardinal Sforza-Riario. He had a lively wit, and he
was a scholar and something of a poet; and the Cardinal, his master,
who, to a desire to be known as a patron of the arts, added an
undeniable taste for letters, treasured him the more on that account.

<p>Let the Cardinal Sforza-Riario love him to a surfeit for his verses.
With that, Beltrame, his rival, had no concern. What plagued the lithe
and passionate Neapolitan was Lavinia Fregosi's interest in those same
verses and in their author. For, indeed, this progress of Angelo's in
Lavinia's regard was growing so marked that Beltrame accounted it high
time to be up and doing if he would be saved the pain of submitting to
defeat.

<p>As he leaned now against his pillar, urged by his jealousy to play the
eavesdropper, he caught some such words as:

<p>"...in my garden tomorrow... afternoon... an hour before the Angelus..."

<p>The rest he missed. But what he caught was sufficient to lead him
to conclude that she was giving an assignation to this Lombard
poetaster&mdash;it was thus, with a man's nice judgment of his rival, that
Beltrame dubbed Messer Angelo.

<p>He narrowed his eyes. If Messer Angelo thought that tomorrow afternoon,
an hour before the Angelus, he was to enjoy the felicity of undisturbed
communion with Madonna Lavinia, he was sowing disappointment for
himself. Beltrame would see to that. He was your dog-in-the-manger type
of lover, who would allow to no other what he might not himself enjoy.

<p>As the boy's song came to an end, and a murmur of applause rolled
through the room, the twain came forward through the pillars, and
so upon the Neapolitan. The latter attempted to greet Lavinia with
a smile and Angelo with a scowl at one and the same time; finding
the performance impossible, he was feeling foolish and therefore
increasingly angry, when, suddenly, a diversion was created.

<p>A brisk step rang through the chamber, to the martial jingle of spurs.
Men were falling back and a way was opening of itself before some
new-comer, who must be of importance to command so much by his mere
presence. A curious silence, too, was creeping over all.

<p>Beltrame turned, and craned his neck. Down the middle of the long room,
looking neither to right nor to left, and taking no account of the
profound bows that greeted his advance, came the tall figure of the
Duke of Valentinois. He was dressed in black, booted and armed, and
he strode the length of the Pontifical Chamber as if it were a drill
ground. His face was white, an angry fire glowed in his eyes, and his
brows were drawn together. In his right hand he carried a sheet of
parchment.

<p>Arrived before the dais, he bent his knee to the Pope, who had watched
the unusual character of his son's advent with a look that plainly
reflected his surprise.

<p>"We have been expecting you," said Alexander, speaking with the slight
lisp peculiar to him; and he added, "but not thus."

<p>"I have had that to do which has delayed me, Holiness," replied the Duke
as he rose. "The lampoonists are at work again. It is not enough that
I deprived the last of these obscene slanderers of his tongue and his
right hand that he might never utter or pen another ribaldry. Already
he has an imitator&mdash;a poet this time." He sneered. "And not a doubt but
that unless we make an example of him he will not lack a following."

<p>He held out the parchment that he carried, unfolded and smoothed it
with an angry hand. "This was attached to the plinth of the statue of
Pasquino. Half Rome had been to see it and to laugh over it before news
reached me, and I sent Corella to tear it down and fetch it me. Read
it, Holiness."

<p>Alexander took the parchment. His face had reflected none of Cesare's
anger whilst the latter was announcing the cause of it. It remained
smooth now that he read, until at last it broke into creases of
amusement.

<p>"Do you smile, Holiness?" quoth Cesare in the angry tone that he alone
dared use to the father who at once loved and feared him.

<p>Alexander laughed outright. "Why, what is here to fret you so?" he
asked. He handed the parchment to Lucrezia, inviting her to read.
But no sooner had her fingers closed over it than Cesare snatched it
impatiently away from her, and left her staring.

<p>"By your leave&mdash;no," he said. "Enough have laughed already." And he
looked with meaning at the Pope. Here at least he had expected sympathy
and an indignation responsive to his own; instead of which he had found
but amusement.

<p>"Come," said the Holy Father soothingly, "the thing is witty, and
it has none of the more usual lewdness; nor yet is it so gross an
exaggeration of the truth, when all is said." And he rubbed his great
nose reflectively.

<p>"Your indifference is comprehensible, Holiness," said Cesare. "The
thing does not touch yourself."

<p>"Pshaw!" said the Pope with a broad gesture. "What if it did? Am I the
man to waste heat upon anonymous pasquinaders? My child, the great
shall never lack defamers. It is the price of greatness in a mean
world. Be thankful that it has pleased God to make you worth defaming.
As for the earthworms that pen ribaldries&mdash;why, if their lampoons are
witty, relish them; if merely stupid, ignore them."

<p>"You may be as patient as you please, Holiness. Patience becomes your
sovereign station." He seemed, never so faintly, to sneer. "As for
myself&mdash;I am resolved to stamp out this passion for lampoons. Slander
shall be driven down into its lair of filth and mud, and choked
there by my justice. Let me but find the author of this pasquinade,
and, I swear to God," he went on, raising his voice and shaking his
clenched hand at the ceiling, "that I will hang him though he be a
prince&mdash;temporal or spiritual."

<p>The Pope shook his great head, and smiled tolerantly upon all this heat.

<p>"Let us pray, then," he lisped, "that you do not find him. The writer
of those verses gives much promise."

<p>"He does, Holiness. He gives great promise of a sudden death from
suffocation."

<p>The Pope's smile wavered nothing in its benignity. "You should follow
my own ensample, Cesare, of contempt for these scribblers."

<p>"I do, Holiness. The bargelli have my orders to make diligent search
for this rhymer. When they have found him you shall see me express my
contempt for him. This ribaldry shall end."

<p>He knelt again, kissed the ring on the hand the Pope extended, and upon
that withdrew as he had come, white-faced and angry to an extent that
was most rarely shown by him.

<p>"You do not seem at ease, Angelo," murmured Beltrame in his rival's ear.

<p>Angelo turned to face the speaker fully. He had paled a little during
Cesare's angry speech, and Beltrame observing this had thereafter
watched him, actuated by a suspicion that was born of hope and founded
upon a knowledge of Angelo's leaning towards satirical verse and of his
attitude towards the family of the Pontiff.

<p>This inimical and satirical attitude of Angelo's towards the Borgias
in general and Cesare in particular was natural in a Milanese, and it
had of late been fostered in his employment by Cardinal Sforza-Riario,
whose house had suffered so rudely at Cesare's hands. It was, indeed,
Angelo's too-fluent pen which, in the interval of singing the thousand
beauties of Lavinia Fregosi, had composed that bitter pasquinade
wherein was ridiculed&mdash;somewhat late in the day, it is true&mdash;Cesare
Borgia's transition from the Cardinalitial purple to the steel and
leather of a condottiero.

<p>That Beltrame should comment upon his slight agitation was disturbing
now to Angelo. He very readily assumed that the Neapolitan's suspicions
were not only definite, but founded upon some evidence of which he must
have become possessed. That it was evidence of any value Angelo could
scarcely suppose; and so he set himself to dissemble and explain his
obvious perturbation.

<p>He laughed and shrugged, as one who throws off some feeling that has
weighed upon him. "Why, yes," he admitted. "I am ever ill at ease
when Valentinois is present. He affects me so. I cannot explain it. A
natural antipathy, perhaps. Have you never experienced it, Beltrame?"

<p>Beltrame sneered. "Not I. Perhaps I have an easier conscience."

<p>"Oh, the conscience of a saint, I am sure, Beltrame," said Angelo, and
finding that Lavinia had meanwhile moved away on her brother's arm, he
turned to follow, for Marco Fregosi was his friend.

<p>Beltrame too had been his friend until just lately. Until they became
rivals for the affections of Lavinia, they had been deeply attached and
all but inseparable. Orestes and Pylades men had dubbed them. It was to
Angelo a source of secret sorrow&mdash;the one cloud in the bright heaven of
his hopes&mdash;that of their friendship no more than the ashes remained. He
would have mended matters had it been possible. But Beltrame made it
daily more impossible; grew daily more and more hostile, until Angelo
realised that it was time to be wary of the man who once had loved him
but who did not so much as trouble now to dissemble his hatred.

<p>By a grey old sundial, creeper-clad, on a lawn green as an emerald and
smooth as velvet, in a luxurious garden on the Banchi Vecchi by old
Tiber, stood on the morrow's afternoon Lavinia and her two suitors.

<p>Beltrame's unexpected coming had been a source of deep vexation to
Angelo&mdash;though it might instead have been a source of joy had he but
known how much Lavinia shared that same vexation. As it was he could
but do his best to dissemble it, and maintain a smiling front.

<p>The child&mdash;she was little more&mdash;leaned a smooth white elbow on the
grey old stone, a mischievous, bewitching smile revealed her dazzling
teeth in which was caught by the stem a blood-red rose, one of the last
roses of the year. Her great black eyes were now veiled demurely under
half-lowered lids and curved sweep of lashes, now raised distractingly
to the enamoured glances of one or the other of her swains.

<p>And they, each dissembling his annoyance at the other's presence, each
revealing the joy he found in her, little dreamed what trouble lay for
them in the heart of that crimson rose she flaunted, nor how one of
them must pay the forfeit of his life for its possession.

<p>Beltrame, on the spoor of his suspicions, and hoping to dash the
other's easy assurance, and steady flow of talk and laughter&mdash;all of
which provoked him, since he felt himself out-matched by it&mdash;dragged in
an allusion to the pasquinade that had so angered Cesare Borgia.

<p>But Angelo laughed. "He is like that," he said to Lavinia, in apology
for the Neapolitan. "The skull in the cave of the anchorite&mdash;a
perpetual reminder of things best forgotten."

<p>"I can understand that you should account them so," said Beltrame
darkly.

<p>"Why, then," returned Angelo, "knowing my wishes, it will be the easier
for you to respect them."

<p>And then Lavinia, to create a diversion from this talk which was not
plain to her, but which seemed laden with much menace, playfully smote
Angelo's cheek with that rose of hers, saying that she did it to punish
his excessive pertness.

<p>"Such punishment," said he, "is an encouragement to wickedness." And as
he spoke his hands closed over the rose, and his eyes smiled hardily
upon the lady of his adoration, with never a thought or care for his
rival's presence.

<p>Beltrame flushed darkly under his tan, and his brows came together as
he looked on.

<p>"You'll crush the flower!" she cried, and more concern could not have
laden her voice and glance had it been his heart that was in danger of
being crushed.

<p>"You can show pity for the flower, madonna, who have none for me."

<p>"Out of pity, then, I relinquish it," said she, and letting the stem
slip through her fingers, she left the rose in his enfolding hands.

<p>"Pity for me, or for the rose?" he asked, his blue eyes very ardent.

<p>"For which you will&mdash;for both," she laughed, and shyly dropped her eyes.

<p>"Ay, madonna," snapped Beltrame. "Give him your pity. I do not grudge
him that. He needs it."

<p>She stared at the Neapolitan's brooding face, alarmed an instant; then,
dissembling this, she laughed. "Why, Ser Beltrame, are you angry&mdash;and
for the matter of a rose? There are still many in the garden."

<p>"In the garden, yes. But the one I coveted, the one I begged of you but
a moment since&mdash;that one is gone," he reproached her.

<p>"And I am to blame if Ser Angelo is rude and violent?" quoth she,
striving to keep the matter in the realm of jest. "You were witness
that I did not give him the flower. He took it without permission;
seized it with ruthless force."

<p>Beltrame smiled, as smiles the loser in the act of paying; and the gall
in his soul fermented, but was repressed for the time, to bubble forth,
the more violent for its repression, an hour or so thereafter when he
was alone with Angelo.

<p>They had departed together from Lavinia's garden, and together they
made their way in the twilight through the Rione di Ponte. Side by side
they went; Beltrame moody and thoughtful; Angelo with smiling eyes
and the lilt of a song on his lips, with new words which his mind was
setting to it as they paced along.

<p>Suddenly Beltrame spoke; his voice harsh and grating.

<p>"Touching that rose, Angelo," he began.

<p>"'Twas culled in Paradise," breathed Angelo softly, and he inhaled its
fragrance in an ecstasy.

<p>"I covet it," said the other viciously.

<p>"Ah! Who would not?" smiled the poet. And he quoted, with modifications
to suit his own case, a sonnet of Petrarca's:

<p class="poem">"Cupid's right hand did open my left side,<br>
And planted in my heart a crimson rose."

<p>"'A laurel green' the poet has it," Beltrame corrected him.

<p>"Petrarca, yes. But I&mdash;"

<p>The Neapolitan's right hand fell heavily on Angelo's shoulder, and
stayed him.

<p>"We'll keep to the master's words, by your leave, dear Angelo," he
laughed; and his laugh was evil and unpleasant. Angelo stared at him,
the smile of ecstasy fading from his lips. "I'll play at Cupid,"
explained Beltrame, with a sneer, "and here's my laurel for the
purpose." He tapped his sword-hilt, nodding darkly. "It shall be red
anon, as a compromise to your own poetic fancy."

<p>Horror filled Angelo, but no fear. "Beltrame," he said solemnly, "I
have loved you."

<p>"There is a green stretch that I know of close at hand, behind the
Braschi. It is as smooth and green as&mdash;as the turf in Madonna Lavinia's
garden. A sweet spot to die in. Shall it be there?"

<p>Anger rose in Angelo's soul, and in the rising waxed hot and passionate
as the Neapolitan's own. That this man who had been his friend should
now seek his life for very jealousy, and where it could nothing profit
him, incensed him by its mean unreasonableness.

<p>"Why, since that is your mood," he answered, "it shall be where you
will. But first, Beltrame&mdash;"

<p>"Come, then," the Neapolitan bade him, harshly interrupting the appeal
he guessed was on the point of following. Then he laughed his evil
laugh again. "'Angel' are you named; an angel does Monna Lavinia
account you. It is high time I made an angel of you in earnest."

<p>"And just as surely as you are a devil, just so surely shall you sup in
hell this night," returned Angelo as he strode on beside the other.

<p>But as they went the poet's eyes grew troubled. His spurt of anger
spent, the folly of the thing appalled him. He must attempt to avert it.

<p>"Beltrame," he questioned, by way of opening a discussion, "what is
your sudden quarrel with me?"

<p>"Madonna Lavinia loves you. I saw it in her eyes today. I love Lavinia.
Needs more be said?"

<p>"Why, no, indeed," said the poet, and his eyes grew dreamy again, his
lips assumed a wistful smile. "If that contents you there is no doubt
that it contents me. My thanks, Beltrame."

<p>"For what?" quoth Beltrame with suspicion.

<p>"For having seen what you saw, and for having told me of it. I lacked
the certainty. It will make a sweet thought to die on, if God wills
that I should die. Have you no fear, Beltrame?"

<p>"Fear?" snorted the stalwart Neapolitan.

<p>"Men say the gods love a lover."

<p>"Not a doubt but they'll love you well enough to take you to their
bosom."

<p>On that they crossed the street, and skirting the Braschi Palace, they
descended a narrow lane where the shadows made night, to emerge again
into the twilight of an open square. And as they went Angelo's poetic
soul, not to be restrained even by the matter that impended, suggested
an opening line for a sonnet on a lover dying. He muttered it aloud to
test its rhythm and gather inspiration to continue.

<p>"What do you say?" asked Beltrame over his shoulder. He was a pace or
two in front, as became the more eager of the twain.

<p>"I am but muttering a verse," said Angelo quietly: "'There's a sweet
visage, sweet can render death.' Can you give me an unusual rhyme for
death?"

<p>"I'll give you the thing itself if you'll but have patience," growled
Beltrame. "Come. This is the place."

<p>They had penetrated a belt of acacias set about a stretch of smooth,
green turf. Peace reigned there. The place was utterly deserted, and
the trees made an effective screen in case anyone should come whilst
they were at their bloody work.

<p>Suddenly the Angelus bell boomed on the lethargic evening air. They
paused, and bared their heads, and though murder was in the soul of one
of them, he offered three Aves up to heaven. The bell ceased.

<p>"Now," said Beltrame, casting his hat upon the grass, and untrussing
the points of his doublet with swift, eager fingers.

<p>Angelo started as from a reverie, and proceeded, more leisurely, to
make ready. A moment he stood, holding the rose to his lips, breathing
the fragrance of it; he was loath to put it down; yet he needed both
his hands, one for his sword, the other for his dagger; for Beltrame
awaited him, doubly armed. At last he solved the difficulty, and set
the stem of the flower between his teeth.

<p>If God willed that he should die that evening, at least her first love
token should be with him in his last moments; its perfume&mdash;fond emblem
of her soul&mdash;should sweeten for him his last breath on earth.

<p>Beltrame saw him coming, the rose between his lips and lacking the wit
to sound a poet's fancies, he deemed it an act of mockery, a thing done
derisive and exultantly. He paled a shade. He looked furtively around.
They were alone. A deadly smile flickered on his lips as he raised his
weapons, and fell on guard.

<p>He was a gentleman trained in arms, was this Beltrame; and easy, he
thought, should be to him the slaughter of a scribbling poet, a man
versed in no weapon but the goose-quill. Yet his certainty of victory
was based on an even surer measure of precaution; his valour sprang
from another advantage&mdash;an advantage that made him no better than a
murderer, as you shall learn.

<p>Sword and dagger met dagger and sword; parted, met again, circled,
flashed, struck fire, were locked an instant, and once more were
parted. For some five minutes they fought on. The sweat gathered on
Beltrame's brow, and he breathed a prayer of thanks to a heaven that
surely did not heed him, for the secret advantage that was his; without
that it would almost seem that this scrivener must prove his better.

<p>They fell back to breathe a moment, each welcoming the brief respite,
for each was winded by the fierce vigour of the onslaught. Then
they engaged once more, and Angelo knew in his heart that he was
Beltrame's master. But that he held his hand, Angelo might have slain
his adversary a score of times had the latter had a score of lives to
lose. But he was gentle&mdash;as gentle as he was skilled&mdash;and he could not
seek the life of the man who had been his friend. Instead he sought
Beltrame's sword arm. If he could drive a foot or so of steel through
it, there would be an end to the encounter; and by the time the wound
was healed he would see to it that their difference was healed also;
he would reason with this hot-headed Beltrame during the season of his
convalescence, and seek to induce him out of his murderous jealousy.

<p>Suddenly Beltrame's point came like a snake at Angelo's throat. Angelo
was no more than in time to turn the thrust aside, and the viciousness
that could aim so at a vital spot, stirred his anger anew; it also
awoke him to a sense of his own danger. Unless he disabled Beltrame
soon, his life would pay the price of his generosity. Beltrame was
the stronger and was showing less fatigue; unless he went in soon, he
might not go in at all. Since he could not reach the arm, he would take
Beltrame there, high up in the right breast, above the lung, where
little damage could be done, thus:

<p>He parried a sharp thrust delivered rather high, and on the binding
of the blade went in and up with a stroke that he had learnt from the
famous Costanzo of Milan, who had been his preceptor in the art of
swordsmanship.

<p>His point went home unwarded; but instead of sinking through
unresisting flesh, it struck something that jarred and numbed his arm;
and on the stroke his rapier snapped, and he was left with a hilt and a
stump of steel.

<p>Beltrame laughed, and Angelo understood. The Neapolitan wore a shirt of
mail&mdash;one of those meshes so much in fashion then, so fine that your
two hands might encompass and conceal it, and yet so finely tempered as
to be proof against the stoutest stroke of sword or dagger.

<p>The poet twisted the rose to a corner of his mouth, that he might have
freedom to speak, what time with his dagger and the stump that remained
him, he made the best defence he could against the other's furious
charge.

<p>"Coward!" he cried in a fury of reproach. "Oh, craven hound! Assassin!
Ah... Gesu!"

<p>Beltrame's sword had found him. A second he stood shuddering, his lips
twisted, his eyes surprised. Then he hurtled forward, and lay prone
on the turf, horribly still, his teeth clenched fast over the stem of
his red rose. Beltrame stood over him, sword embrued to the hilt, a
mocking, cruel smile on his swarthy face.

<p>Then the murderer dropped on one knee, and laid hands on Angelo to turn
him over. He had killed him for the rose. He would take it now. But
in the very act of setting hands upon his victim, he paused. Sounds
reached him from beyond the trees, over by the Braschi Palace.

<p>"Down there!" he heard a voice shouting in the distance; and footsteps
came beating quickly on the stones.

<p>He understood. Some one attracted by the clash of blades had spied on
them and had run for the bargelli.

<p>Swift and silent as a lizard, Beltrame darted to the dark pile of
doffed garments. He snatched up his doublet, sword, belt and scabbard;
he never waited to don them, but tucking them under his arm and
clapping hat on head, he was gone from that open space of lawn thanking
Heaven for the thickening dusk that lent him cover as he ran.

<p>In a dark alley not twenty paces from the square he paused, laid
down his bundle, and carefully wiped and sheathed his weapons. Then
he donned his doublet, girded on his belt, straightened his hat, and
sauntered boldly back, adown the alley.

<p>At the mouth of it he was suddenly confronted by three of the bargelli.
A lanthorn was raised and flashed on his patrician garments. An officer
stepped forward briskly.

<p>"Whence are you, sir?" he asked.

<p>"From Piazza Navona," answered Beltrame without hesitation.

<p>"This way?" And the officer pointed up the alley.

<p>"Why, yes. This way."

<p>One of the bargelli laughed. The officer stepped closer to Beltrame,
and bade the lanthorn-bearer hold the light in the gentleman's face.

<p>"This alley, sir, has but one entrance&mdash;this. Now, sir, again whence
are you?"

<p>Confused, Beltrame sought shelter in bluster. He would not be
interrogated. Was not a gentleman free to walk where he listed? Let
them beware how they incommoded him. He was Messer Beltrame Severino.

<p>The officer increased in courtesy but diminished nothing in his
firmness.

<p>"A man has been done to death down there," he informed Beltrame, "and
you would be well advised to return full answers to my questions,
unless you prefer to go before the Ruota."

<p>Beltrame bade him go to the devil. Whereupon the men laid hands upon
him, and the officer made bold to examine his weapons. Despite his
precautions, Beltrame grew afraid, for he had wiped them in the dark.

<p>The officer looked along the sword, then peered under the quillons
of the hilt. What he saw there caused him to touch the spot with his
finger, and then examine this.

<p>"Wet blood," said he, and added curtly to his men, "Bring him with you."

<p>They carried him off that he might tell what story he pleased to the
president of the Ruota, and explain his wanderings in that blind alley
by the Braschi.

<p>Now it happened that the hole that Beltrame made in Angelo d'Asti's
fair body was not large enough for the escape of so great a soul. Yet
might it have proved so but for another thing that happened. As they
were bearing him away from the scene of the combat, wondering who he
might be, and whither they should carry him, the group was met by Marco
Fregosi&mdash;Madonna Lavinia's brother, and Angelo's good friend.

<p>At sight of Angelo's face, Marco made the bearers pause, and demanded
to know what had befallen. Then, upon finding that the poet's life was
not yet extinct, he ordered them to carry him to his villa on Banchi
Vecchi&mdash;the house which Angelo had left but an hour or so ago.

<p>They nursed him back to health and wholeness. The beautiful Lavinia in
a passion of solicitude tended him herself. Could she have done less?
For you are to know that they brought him in with the red rose still
tight between his teeth, and she had recognised her love token. If
anything had still been wanting to complete Angelo's conquest of her
virgin heart, that thing he now afforded.

<p>It was nine days before he opened his eyes to reason and understanding,
his danger overpast; life and happiness awaiting him. They told him
he was at the Villa Fregosi, and the very announcement did as much to
complete his recovery as their tender efforts had done to bring it thus
far.

<p>On the morrow he saw Lavinia at last. Her brother brought her to him,
and seeing him awake again her eyes filled with tears, as sweet as
those had been bitter with which she had watered his pillow and her
own&mdash;though he knew it not, nor dreamed it&mdash;during the first days
of sojourn with them, when his vital fire seemed on the point of
extinction.

<p>It was on the occasion of this visit that Marco asked him for the
details of what had happened, the story of how he had come by his hurt,
expressing at the same time his own suspicions that it was Beltrame who
had all but slain him.

<p>"Ay," answered Angelo wistfully, "Beltrame it was&mdash;the coward! He wore
a mesh of steel in secret, and forced me into a combat that must end in
murder."

<p>"And upon what grounds did you quarrel?" was Marco's next question,
heedless of his sister's heightening distress.

<p>"We fought for a rose; this." He bore his hand half-way to his lips;
then, bethinking him, he smiled, and dropped it back upon the coverlet.

<p>"I have kept it for you," said Lavinia through her tears.

<p>The light of a great joy leaped to the poet's eyes to answer her; a
flush mounted to his pale brow.

<p>"You fought for a rose?" quoth Marco, frowning. "I hardly understand."

<p>"You wouldn't," said Angelo. "'Twas a rose of Paradise."

<p>Marco looked grave. "Lavinia," said he, rising gently, "I think perhaps
we had better leave him. His mind is wandering again."

<p>"No, no," laughed Angelo, and his tone was reassuring. "Tell me&mdash;what
of Beltrame?"

<p>"He is dead," said Marco.

<p>"Dead?" And for all that he had suffered at Beltrame's hands, for all
that Beltrame had sought his life, there was distress in Angelo's voice
and in the glance he bent upon Marco. "How came he to die?"

<p>"By the will and pleasure of the Lord Cesare Borgia. He was hanged."

<p>"And I think he deserved it, Angelo," said Lavinia. "He deserved it for
his attempt to murder you, if not for the thing for which they punished
him."

<p>"For what else, then, did he suffer?"

<p>"Do you remember," she said, "that afternoon at the Vatican?"

<p>"Yes," he answered, mystified.

<p>"And how the Duke of Valentinois came in, so very angry, and told of
the verses that had been found that day upon the statue of Pasquino,
and how his bargelli were seeking for the author?"

<p>"Yes, yes. But what has this to do with Beltrame?"

<p>"He was the author," said Marco.

<p>"Beltrame?"

<p>"It was proved so. It fell out thus," Marco related. "It was his
attempt to murder you that destroyed him. He was found near the Braschi
a few moments after the bargelli had discovered you. There was blood on
his sword, and so they carried him before the Tribunal of the Ruota,
which began his examination with the usual formality of having him
searched. In his pocket was found the original of those very verses,
with all the erasures and emendations and substitutions that a writer
makes in perfecting his work. He denied all knowledge of them; told, I
know not what preposterous lies. But they put him to the question. At
the third hoist he confessed."

<p>"Confessed?" quoth Angelo, his eyes dilating.

<p>"Ay; the torture drew it from him. He may perhaps have thought they
would not go the length of hanging him, or else, that since you were
doubtless dead, they would hang him in any case, and so that he might
at least avoid further agonies by confessing and being done with it.
Cesare Borgia is tired of pasquinades, and wished to make an ensample.
And so they hanged him next morning beside the statue of Pasquino."

<p>Angelo sank back on his pillows, and stared at the ceiling for some
moments.

<p>"He was undoubtedly a coward," said he at length, smiling bitterly,
"and he met a coward's fate. He deserved to die. And yet he was not the
author of that pasquinade."

<p>"Not the author? How do you know?"

<p>"Because&mdash;Are we alone? Because," said Angelo softly, "it was I who
wrote it."

<p>"You, Angelo?" cried brother and sister in a breath. Angelo's eyes were
wandering round the room, reflecting the bewilderment that filled his
soul. Suddenly they paused, fastening upon a garment of shot silk that
was thrown across a chair.

<p>"What is that?" he asked abruptly, pointing.

<p>"That? Your doublet," answered Marco. "They fetched it with you from
the Braschi, when you were wounded."

<p>Angelo sank back again, and he smiled never so faintly.

<p>"That makes it clear," he said. "Beltrame took the wrong doublet in the
dark. The verses were in my pocket."

<p>Lavinia's hand stole over Angelo's where it lay upon the coverlet. He
raised his eyes to hers. "We owe him much&mdash;to this Beltrame," he said
slowly. "I could have known no peace while they were hunting the author
of that pasquinade. He has satisfied the hunters, and so removed the
danger of discovery from me. That is something. But I owe him more, do
I not, Lavinia?"

<p>"Why, what else do you owe him?" inquired Marco.

<p>"This brother of yours is a very dull fellow, Lavinia," said Angelo,
smiling as the blessed smile.
