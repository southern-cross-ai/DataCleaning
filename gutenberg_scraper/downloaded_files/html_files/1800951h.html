<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>I. &mdash; OLD SIGNALS RISE
AGAIN</h2>

<p class="first">HE entered town late in the day, stabled his horse
at Connoyer's and crossed to the hotel: and when he came to
register he held the pen motionless awhile, as though the
recollection of his full name were an unfamiliar act. On his
features, brown-burned by all the years of outdoor life, lay that
grave and attentive sereneness of a man long accustomed to his own
company, to his own resources and solitary whimsies. He signed,
"James T. Keene, Dalhart, Texas," in a broad angular hand and
waited for the key.</p>

<p>The clerk said hopefully, "Long way to come."</p>

<p>Keene's bland "yes" closed the clerk out. He took the key and
turned to the stairs. Dust silvered his clothes, weather had faded
them. His hair lay thick and black and ragged against his temples,
there was no mark or scar or shadow of any worry on his face. His
mouth was broad below a heavy nose, his eyes were of that shade of
gray which is almost blue. Riding had trimmed him, had limbered all
his muscles so that his boots made almost no noise on the stairs.
At the upper landing he looked back with a sudden flip of his head
and caught the clerk's following glance, and at that moment his
eyes were nearer black than gray, with glass-sharp splinters of
interest in them. Thus catching the clerk's off-guard curiosity, he
was a man hard and fine-drawn by the habits of his life: the next
moment he erased that impression with a smile and entered his
room.</p>

<p>In this room's stale warmth every ancient odor of a frontier
hotel lay as a musty remembrance. Once there had been crimson roses
in the pattern of the shabby carpet. A pine bureau held its pitcher
and bowl; there was an iron bedstead whose enamel was chipped by
the roweling of countless spurred boots, a rocking chair, and on
the wall a lithograph of an old Indian scout belly-flat beside a
desert waterhole. Day's last clear light came through the single
grimed window and through a bullet hole in the wall, autographed by
the maker as follows: "Ventilated by Smoky Jules from Medora, 1882.
Forty-four barrel on a forty-five frame. Never bet aces in another
man's game." Some other weary-wise traveler, incited to public
comment, had added: "Plenty of livestock in this bed. If I was a
rustler I'd get rich."</p>

<p>It was one more hotel room in one more prairie town, but for Jim
Keene it was the first night beneath a roof in sixty days. He
stripped to the waist, scrubbed away the dust of long travel, and
shaved in a growing twilight. Standing by the window later he had a
better view of the town.</p>

<p>The main street was a crooked river of silver dust running from
a yellow depot at one end of Prairie City to the out-scatter of
sheds and corrals at the other. Keene looked down upon single-story
buildings sitting shoulder to shoulder, on board awnings shadowing
the street walks, on alleys leading to rear compounds. A wagonload
of barbwire rolled past, driven by an obvious homesteader with a
square-cut beard. In front of a saloon which advertised itself as
the Cattleman's Palace cow ponies stood heads down and half
asleep.</p>

<p>There was something wrong with the town; he had caught the smell
of that at first entry. He considered the street the saddle shop,
the Cattleman's Palace, the grain-and-feed store, the sign which
said, "Worsham and Ross, Gen'l Mchdse," the flimsy bank building,
the courthouse. He made a picture in his head of it, for to Jim
Keene the real world was made up of stray words overheard and the
odd change on people's faces, of prints in the sand and houses
sitting empty in the middle of sagebrush, of bullet holes in a
hotel wall, of a man enormous in every physical detail standing now
in the doorway of the Cattleman's Palace watching the homesteader
and his load of barbwire.</p>

<p>The wagon stopped, the homesteader got down and started for the
hotel. As he did so the man at the saloon&mdash;a man nearly as
tall and as broad as the saloon door&mdash;moved into the street.
When he passed the homesteader he swerved aside deliberately and
his elbow caught the homesteader and knocked him off balance to the
dust. The big man walked on, never looking back, but immediately a
small crowd of cowhands appeared in front of the saloon, watching
this scene with a narrow amusement. The homesteader got up from the
dust and stood still, staring at his feet; in a moment he continued
on to the hotel, slightly limping.</p>

<p>Jim Keene rolled a cigarette, watching the big man turn back to
the punchers gathered at the saloon door. The big man had made his
play for the entertainment of the punchers; now he grinned and
waggled a hand and the whole group passed into the saloon. Keene
lighted the cigarette. He took one deep drag of smoke into his
lungs. To his face came the wry tightness of distaste and a
feeling, the old feeling over which he had never had any control,
ripped through him. He murmured to himself: "Always something like
that," and went downstairs.</p>

<p>In the dining room he saw the homesteader again. The homesteader
was at a corner table with his wife and a grown son and two small
children. It appeared to be a holiday for them, a break in the hard
work and loneliness of some sagebrush quarter-section a long way
from town. They were all cheerful except the man himself, who sat
at the head of the table without appetite or interest. Keene
thought, "He didn't tell them about the knock-down."</p>

<p>Rising from his finished meal. Keene left the dining zoom. He
was fed and at ease, his muscles were idle after the long ride and
every sound and sensation of this town pleased his hungry senses;
yet a cool wind was blowing from his errant past, that wind which
governed his life no matter what wisdom his mind might hold. He
felt it and regretted it, but nevertheless it pressed softly
against him and it made him smile as he crossed to the doorway. In
the smile was some regret. In it also, though he never knew this,
was a hopeful anticipation.</p>

<p>He stood on the street to watch the crowd flow by. Ranch outfits
came in and sent the street dust high as they wheeled before the
Cattleman's Palace. They moved along the street with a salty
arrogance; the razor-sharp appetites of rough living propelled them
into the saloon. Their voices came back to Keene, high and quick
and cheerful. Homesteaders entered town and wagons and buggies were
banked wheel to wheel against the walks. Along these walks families
cruised and grouped up with other families and moved idly on.
Lamplights turned the steady street dust to a film of gold.</p>

<p>He heard a man say: "You see Jesse Morspeare knock Spackman
down?"</p>

<p>Keene crossed the street and was caught in the slow-drifting
stream of the crowd. On a wall of the saddle shop he saw a sign
which read: "Re-elect Sheriff Ben Holders," and beside it a second
sign said, "For Sheriff&mdash;Jesse Morspeare. The Cattlemen's
Choice." He paused by these notices, bracing himself against the
steady push of people, and remembering what he had heard only a
moment ago. Morspeare was the big one who had rammed his elbow into
the homesteader. The homesteader was Spackman. At that moment the
story of this town and the surrounding prairie was as clear to Jim
Keene as though he had lived his life in it.</p>

<p>A wave of homesteaders broke against him and stirred him out of
his tracks and rolled on. A girl drove her rig against the walk and
jumped to the street. She made a complete turn in the dust, saw
Keene, and spoke. "Have you seen Dr. Ellenburg?" Her hand touched
his arm to stop him, bringing his attention down to the steady,
gray alarm in her eyes; strain pushed the edges of her lips
together. Keene removed his hat before he answered, and still
delayed his answer. She was a tall girl whose hair had been whipped
loose from fast riding. The touch of her arm was a weight and the
tilt of her head was a picture in this noise and shadow and
confusion. He said: "Sorry, but&mdash;" and saw her thrown backward
by the collision of a man's blunt shoulder. The man had put his
head down to make a way through this crowd, He was drunk and saw
nothing, and he was laughing to himself as he shoved forward.</p>

<p>Keene caught the drunk by the coat collar and hauled him back.
He whirled the man around and put both arms against his chest and
slammed him against the saddle-shop wall.</p>

<p>The drunk cried: "Hey&mdash;Broken Bit!"</p>

<p>The girl straightened and tried to break away, but the crowd
quit moving; it made a tight ring around Keene and the girl and the
drunk. Men pushed down the street and somebody called out: "That
you, Snap? Hey, Broken Bit! Hey, Red!"</p>

<p>"No," said Keene to the girl, "I haven't seen the doctor. I'm a
stranger here."</p>

<p>The drunk planted himself firmly on his feet, bowed his head and
butted Keene in the chest. Cowhands slid through the crowd and
stood still, carefully watching. The drunk pushed against Keene,
making no headway. He got rougher and angrier, he stamped his feet
on Keene's boots, he swung his arms. Suddenly Keene slapped the
drunk's face and straightened him up. Keene looked across the
narrow circle, observing that one red-headed puncher looked at all
this with narrow interest. Keene said: "You Broken Bit?"</p>

<p>"That's my outfit," admitted the redhead.</p>

<p>Keene caught the drunk under the arms. He called, "Here's your
baby," and threw him at the redhead.</p>

<p>The redhead didn't care for that. He batted the drunk aside.
"You're a little tough, friend."</p>

<p>The cool wind blew stronger and every piece of this scene was
something Keene could repeat from memory.</p>

<p>Regret and pleased anticipation ran through him in equal
strength, side by side. "Tell your partner to pull in his elbows,
Red." Then he forgot about the redhead and he forgot about the
drunk. "This lady is looking for a Dr. Ellenburg."</p>

<p>Somebody in the crowd called: "Up at the courthouse."</p>

<p>The girl said: "Thanks." She had no reason for smiling, he
thought, but still she smiled and murmured to him, "I'm sorry," and
turned away. The crowd moved on. The drunk, having forgotten the
last few minutes, rose from the walk and vanished, butting his way
through the crowd.</p>

<p>The redhead remained, pushing his glance at Keene in a rough,
half-aroused way. He was a long, freckle-faced man, never doubting
himself. His red hair lay tight and short-curled against his head.
He was bold enough for anything, but sufficiently smart to take his
good time to read what he saw.</p>

<p>"You don't look like a homesteader."</p>

<p>"Don't let it worry you."</p>

<p>"Maybe I will."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," agreed Keene. He was smiling, he was thinking
back and remembering how this always went. It never changed. A man
rode a thousand miles but the pattern caught up with him and now it
was hard to know whether to be glad or sorry. He stood there,
appraising the man in front of him. The redhead was a handsome
rascal, and knew it. He was hard as iron and he knew that too. If
he belonged to Broken Bit he would no doubt be the riding boss, for
that air of bold assurance was on him. The homesteader, Spackman,
came from the hotel with his family and stood in the street's
lamp-stained shadows; and immediately a second family joined the
Spackmans. A girl stood in front of Spackman's grown son and
touched his chest with her hand and laughed at him. Her lips were
red and her brown-dusted face was stirred by that laughter and by
the excitement of the night. Spackman's son looked at her with a
solemn, disturbed interest. Keene noticed all this; and now he saw
the redhead's glance strike across the street to that girl. His
face changed, a flare of strong interest showed in his eyes. The
two homestead families, now in one group, quartered across the
street's dust. The girl's eyes lifted and saw the redhead and the
smile left her lips; after she had gone by she looked quickly over
one shoulder with a knowing darkness in her eyes, and by that
obscure coquette's glance she raked up every hungry impulse in the
redhead, leaving him with his tantalized hope. Keene saw all
this.</p>

<p>Keene moved on to the saloon and walked into its full blast of
noise, into its rolling haze of tobacco smoke. Piano music clanked
steadily from the deep back end. Along the bar, which ran the whole
distance from front door to rear door, men stood elbow against
elbow and a back bar mirror flashed out its prisms of light and
four barkeeps slowly sweated as they worked. Heads of deer and
antelope and bear were mounted on the walls; two lamps bracketed a
painting of a fleshy beauty lying on a couch, her heavy-lidded
smile fixed on the poker tables below.</p>

<p>After the silence and long loneliness of the trail this noise
and warmth and glitter, this odor of tobacco and whisky and clothes
saturated with horse smell, comforted Keene. He found an empty
place at a table and bought a stack. Somebody called through the
saloon. "Where you been, John?" Looking toward the door, Keene saw
the redhead enter the saloon with the giant Jesse Morspeare behind
him. More outfits raced into Prairie City, the sound of their
arrival trembling through the flimsy walls of the saloon. A shot
flattened along the night and the saloon doors swung ceaselessly
back and forth to the inbound passage of the steady-flowing
crowd.</p>

<p>Keene sat low in the chair, hat pulled down over his eyes. He
ordered a drink and a cigar and he got the cigar evenly drawing
between his lips, observing the deliberate manner in which Red John
moved across the floor to take a seat at his table. Red John said:
"A stack," and seemed to be amused at some joke in his head.</p>

<p>The old streaky feeling traveled through Jim Keene. All the
ancient signals of trouble were rising in him and about him while
he watched Red John's hard, rope-burned hands shuffle and deal the
cards. They were fast hands; the fingers were supple. It was
something to remember. He lifted his glance and caught the straight
blow of the redhead's green-flecked eyes.</p>

<p>"You're no nester," murmured Red John.</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Red John's voice cut in quickly. "Now, Snap was a little drunk.
But that don't matter. If a Broken Bit man wants to use his elbows
it's all right."</p>

<p>Keene said, "I pass," and laid his fingers on the table. He
rubbed them along the felt table top, making short slow circles.
Nothing ever changed. The quarrels of men rose from the same old
reasons and moved through the same old pattern.</p>

<p>"I said it was all right," said Red John in softest voice.</p>

<p>That long wind had been blowing against Keene all evening; it
strengthened now, it grew colder and stronger, coming up a
thousand-mile trail. The player to his left took up the cards to
shuffle them, but he laid them down again and said, "I'm cashing
in," and left the table. Keene collected the cards and roped them
between his hands.</p>

<p>"No haymow shuffles," said Red John. "You're a little queer on a
lot of things, friend." He was talking in the same edged, amused
voice, yet the ring of it flattened, it went out of key and his
lids made a narrower frame around his eyes. Keene dealt and drew a
long breath and felt the old current of wildness crowd him. This
was what he had traveled so far and so long to escape. But the
distance meant nothing; for a man carried his passport to hell in
his heart wherever he traveled.</p>

<p>"It occurs to me&mdash;" he said.</p>

<p>Red John cut straight across the rest of it. "You're tough with
drunks, friend. Which is an easy stunt."</p>

<p>Keene put down his cards and placed his hands at the edge of the
table. He came out of his chair and flung the table in Red John's
lap and watched Red John fall backward. Chips clacked along the
floor. Red John's body made a squashing echo in the saloon and
within the space of a breath there was no talk in the place and no
sound except Red John's grunt as he wrenched himself to his feet.
He took three backward steps and paused. The other players at the
table moved away at once and an open space appeared behind Red
John, made by the withdrawing of men from the bar.</p>

<p>"When I'm talking," said Keene, "I don't like to be cut in."</p>

<p>Heat flared in Red John's eyes, the quick shadow of cruelty came
to them; the man's lips drew down at the corners, they thinned in
the center. Keene, waiting for what he knew would come, remembered
how many other times he had watched this scene take shape before
him. The memory made him smile and the smile was a rash signal on
his face. He stood with his feet apart; he stood still, and though
he had ridden a thousand miles to escape this kind of scene there
was no regret in him now. This saloon was the Cattleman's Palace
but it might have been the Drover's in Abilene or the Belle in San
Antonio; it might have been a lot of other towns. If a man had
pride and temper and if these were the things he cherished and
would defend it made no difference how far he ran.</p>

<p>"Friend," said Red John, "I like to meet a tough man and try my
luck."</p>

<p>That was it. That was the core and the meaning of the old story.
A man had pride and pride took him into a fight. If he survived
that fight his reputation grew and other men came along to say, as
Red John was now saying, "I like to meet a tough man and try my
luck." The time came when a man got weary of it and saw somewhere
his own death in a last showdown and ran from it as he was now
running. But there was no hope in running. For it was in the man,
always.</p>

<p>So he stood there, still smiling, and said as he had said many
times before: "All right, Red. Take a try."</p>

<p>Into the sibilant stillness of the room crashed the high scream
of a woman, followed by the running scuff of heavy boots and the
bubbling echo of a man's voice in pain. A puncher put his head
through the door. He yelled, "Broken Bit!" and disappeared. The
saloon crowd rushed at the door, pushing Red John aside, throwing
him off his careful balance. Red John made a gesture with his
hands, turned from Keene, and went out into the street. A floor man
moved stolidly forward to pick up the capsized table and chairs.
Then somebody said, "All right, Tonk," and the floor man moved
away. Keene turned about, finding a man behind him whose eyes were
brilliant green against an Irishman's crimson complexion. This
man's eyes held a dancing light. They were approving Keene.</p>

<p>"My boy," he said, "be careful of that fellow. He's a Broken Bit
man."</p>

<p>Keene said: "He's the boss?"</p>

<p>"He's the foreman. Grat DePard's the boss." Then the green-eyed
man grinned. "Ah now, it would be a lovely fight between you. I
think you're the one that might do it. You've got the mark. I'm Tim
Sullivan and this is my place. Be careful of that crowd."</p>

<p>Keene crossed the saloon and pushed open the doors and was
stopped by the solid crowd on the walk. In the middle of the street
a ring of men, homesteaders and cowhands, stood around the Spackman
wagon with its load of barbwire. Spackman's grown son and the two
children were on the wagon seat. Mrs. Spackman stood by the wagon
with an ax in her hand. Spackman was in the dust, now slowly
rising; blood dripped from his mouth and dropped along his beard.
He got to his feet and put up his hands in uncertain defense
against Jesse Morspeare, who was a black and towering hulk in the
stained lamplight and shadow of this night.</p>

<p>"Don't get in my way again," said Morspeare.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spackman screamed: "If you hit him again I'll use this
ax."</p>

<p>Morspeare said: "Red, grab that old fool's ax."</p>

<p>Red John moved out of the circle, slow and careful; as he did so
the Spackman boy jumped down from the wagon and stood beside his
mother, and then Jim Keene saw homesteaders come slowly together,
their faces black and stubborn yet half afraid. Red John was
laughing. "You'll cut yourself with that ax, ma'am. Just put it
down."</p>

<p>"Let her alone," said Spackman's boy.</p>

<p>Spackman spoke through his cut mouth: "No doubt you can do what
you want with me, Jesse. But we'll still be out there on the Silver
Bow flats when you're dead and gone. Now let me go home."</p>

<p>"Old man," said Morspeare, "don't ever get in my way."</p>

<p>"Then," said Spackman stubbornly, "stay out of mine."</p>

<p>"Go on back to Ioway and grub your land," called Morspeare.
"Don't come here and spoil range grass."</p>

<p>"We'll be here," said Spackman, slow and weary and firm.</p>

<p>"Not long," retorted Morspeare, moving forward. Mrs. Spackman
raised the ax, Broken Bit men edged forward, the homesteaders were
a tighter, darker knot in the street. Red John laughed again, not
moving. The homestead girl, having come to the wagon, put her hand
on the shoulder of Spackman's boy. Now Red John watched her and
Keene saw her stare back at Red John with a half-interested,
half-repelled attention. Her red lips softened as she looked at the
foreman.</p>

<p>Keene came against the crowd on the walk. He put his hands
between the touching shoulders of two men and shoved them away. He
hit them with a roll of his body and went through. He was in the
street dust, pulling a Broken Bit man aside. The Broken Bit man
flung himself around, resenting that roughness with a lifted arm.
He looked at Keene, saying irritably, "Stop that!" Keene passed him
and got behind Red John. The Broken Bit foreman stirred in his
tracks, hearing trouble. He swayed and swung his head and found
Keene, and he took a rapid step to the left and made a half turn.
In the rounds of his eyes Keene saw the quick-roused flicker of
cruelty again.</p>

<p>A voice quietly called: "Make way here." A gray and straight and
severe old man walked inside the circle, saying: "Stop that,
Jesse."</p>

<p>Morspeare let out a rumbling answer. "You won't be wearin' that
star long, Borders."</p>

<p>"Long enough. You can go home, Spackman, or you can stay. It
makes no difference. You Broken Bit boys just ease along."</p>

<p>A rider came up the street on a trotting horse, calling, "What's
this&mdash;what's this?"</p>

<p>The crowd broke instantly to let him into the circle. He reined
up before Morspeare and Borders. He sat heavy and square on a big
horse, the burned darkness of his face shining like polished saddle
leather in the saloon's outthrown light. He wore a cotton shirt
unbuttoned at the collar and the muscles of his neck snapped
straight and tight when he moved his head. He was big-chested, with
a long flat nose and heavy lips loosely rolled together. He had a
thick voice, the sound of it dropping like an ax stroke into the
silence.</p>

<p>He looked at Morspeare, at Red John. He said: "When I want
trouble I'll tell you. Get the hell out of town."</p>

<p>The huge Morspeare shifted on his feet. He lost his spirit
immediately. "Ah, Grat&mdash;"</p>

<p>This, then, was Grat DePard. Keene considered the man with a
widening attention, forming his own judgments. DePard sat like a
soldier on the big horse, obviously accustomed to having his own
way; on him was the air of a dry, aloof scheming. Jesse Morspeare
dropped his head. Turning, he moved out of the circle, never
thinking to question the order tossed so bluntly at him. DePard
looked around at his crew. "Go on," he said. "Go on."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spackman spoke up. "Tell them to leave us alone."</p>

<p>Grat DePard dipped his head at her, giving her no comfort with
his voice. "Take care of yourself. I didn't ask you homesteaders to
come into this country and break up my range."</p>

<p>The Broken Bit men moved away in reluctance. Red John looked at
the homestead girl, his desire sharp-calling over the dust. DePard
stared at the old and serene sheriff. "Ben," he said, "these are my
men. Don't order them around so quick."</p>

<p>"Hold them in hand then," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I'll do as it pleases me to do, Ben," announced DePard. He
turned his horse. His glance touched Keene and remained steadfast a
brief moment, the completely unrevealing glance of a player
studying his hand. A moment later he followed his forming outfit
down the street and soon left town.</p>

<p>Keene watched the crowd dissolve. The homestead girl rose to the
seat with the Spackman boy, smiling up at him and speaking some
soft, provocative word to him. The Spackman boy nodded slowly and
put the team in motion. The outfits were running out and the
homesteaders were departing, and presently Prairie City settled to
its quiet hour and lights began to die and the street's silver dust
glowed darkly through the settled shadows. Building corners made
gaunt angles against the black sky.</p>

<p>Keene went into the saloon and stood up to the bar. The trade
had dropped to a single steady game at one poker table; half a
dozen men, other punchers from other outfits, remained at the bar.
Pouring himself a drink, he watched the gray straight sheriff enter
the saloon and walk toward him. This, he remembered, would be Ben
Borders, who was running for re-election against the giant Jesse
Morspeare.</p>

<p>Borders said: "Son, you make a wide splash."</p>

<p>"A drink?" offered Keene.</p>

<p>"One," said Borders, "one for an old man," and poured his drink.
He had a slow and courteous voice, he had age's faded eyes. Behind
the austerity of that long, disciplined face gentleness lay.
"You're ridin'?"</p>

<p>"Just riding."</p>

<p>"It sounds natural," reflected the sheriff. "Just fancy-dancin'
along the trail, admirin' the shape of your shadow. That's a nice
time of life. Better than most times. Always something over the
next hill."</p>

<p>"What's over it?" asked Jim Keene.</p>

<p>"Now that I remember back," said Ben Borders quietly, "it was
the looking that was good, never the finding. But of course," and
he added this with a perceptible regret, "I was a little headstrong
and wanted too much. A man like that makes pictures in his head.
The pictures are hard to fill."</p>

<p>"Why," said Jim Keene, "that's true. But a man's got to find the
picture. If he took less, what would he have?"</p>

<p>"I thought that once," said the sheriff, and let his glance go
far back into time. "But I was a young man then. Here's to the next
hill, son."</p>

<p>"How," said Keene, and drank his whisky and left the saloon.</p>

<p>He crossed to the hotel and went to his room, but now he knew he
couldn't stay. The walls were closing in on him and the night was
flat and restlessness had its way with him. He went down to pay his
bill. In fifteen minutes he had left the town behind.</p>

<p>It was then ten o'clock, with a coolness coming to the night.
Somewhere he heard the sigh of wind through a lonesome juniper and
somewhere the howl of a coyote floated along the stillness. To the
rear and to either side lay the flat of the desert, and here and
there he made out the distant wink of a homestead shanty; before
him he saw the shapeless bulk of mountains. That was north, and
toward the north he pointed, toward the hills he proposed to cross,
one upon another, until the restlessness was gone.</p>

<p>Near midnight he made camp and built up a small sagebrush fire
and cooked coffee; rolled in his blankets, he watched the fire die.
Once he heard the distant drum of several horsemen. Starlight lay
pale on the desert. This night, in Prairie City, his past had
caught up with him and once more the old story had been played out
in the saloon. A thousand miles wasn't enough to escape it;
somewhere in the northern distance maybe he'd find a reason to put
his pride away and be a humble man without a gun. Before he fell
asleep he remembered the girl who had asked him about the doctor.
Her face was oval and white and composed in his memory; around her
eyes, he remembered, had been the hint of an iron resolution, but
in her lips he had seen a contradictory thing.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>II. &mdash; AURORA BRANT</h2>

<p class="first">AURORA BRANT returned to the homestead shack with
Dr. Ellenburg at midnight. When he left half an hour later he told
her the worst of it in his bluntest words. "Your father," he said,
"can't last out another day." She had known he would say that. The
rest of the long, black night she sat by the bed, watching her
father move through his fitful intervals of sleep, half dreaming of
death and half-awake and aware of its coming.</p>

<p>Now it was day and he had fallen into a real sleep. Aurora stood
at the shanty door to watch strong light move across a sea of sage
and yellow grass. Prairie City was a blur twenty-five miles
southward. Here and there at lonely intervals small square
shanties, no different than the one in which she lived, stood
against the sun; far away she saw a rider and his ribbon of dust.
This was the Silver Bow flats, on which the homesteaders were
settling. Only last year it had been free government land used by
the cattle outfits to graze their beef; the hatred of the cattlemen
at that intrusion was the one real fear in the heart of every
homesteader.</p>

<p>She saddled her pony in the shed, took a bucket with a long
rope, and rode toward the river a few hundred yards away. The
Silver Bow crossed the flats by means of a deep lava-rock gorge and
made a bend here and came out of its canyon to provide the only
suitable land within twelve miles.</p>

<p>At the river she rode the horse into the current and dropped the
bucket to the full length of the rope, therein filling it. This was
a device her father&mdash;a clever man who could do anything with
his mind and nothing with his hands&mdash;had invented to save the
labor of dismounting. While the horse had its long morning drink
she looked across the river at the small, gray log cabin on the
north side.</p>

<p>Beyond the ford two ridges formed the walls of a narrow
valley&mdash;Cloud Valley&mdash;whose grass lay rich yellow in the
sunlight; gradually as the valley ran northward the ridges pinched
in and became the rough-tumbled chain of the Thunderhead Range,
here and there touched by snow patches. All that valley was cattle
graze, with the ranch houses of the big outfits&mdash;Broken Bit,
Rafter T, and Cleve Stewart's Chain and Ball&mdash;hidden in small
box canyons playing off from the valley. Every foot of that golden
fifteen-mile meadow was free land, open to any homesteader who
wished to file upon it. Only one homesteader had ever tried. He had
built the log cabin across the ford. One night he had been shot
dead and now the cabin stood as a stark warning to all other
homesteaders.</p>

<p>She turned back. When she reached the yard of the shanty she
heard her father calling with more strength than he had to spend.
Dropping from the horse, she hurried in and saw the fear frozen in
his eyes. He reached for her hand. "A man sees the sorry side of
himself at a time like this. At this stage of the game you don't
make excuses for yourself any more. I have never really been happy
when alone. I can't even die alone."</p>

<p>"Don't regret anything, Dad. We've seen the world. We've had
fun."</p>

<p>"If that were only all&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was very thin and in the last few years his hair had turned
white at the edges, and he had hated that because he hated age. He
was sixty but still kept the blue eyes of a young man; his face was
without a line of worry. He had never worried, never worked very
hard, never bound himself to any one place. Wherever they had moved
he had always begun by saying: "This is our home at last. Here's
where we make our fortune." But in a little while depression always
came upon him and the orthodox pattern of life would bore him and
then he would say: "It is not as I'd hoped it would be, Aurora.
Let's try New Orleans. It is a lovely place." And so they would
move. All her first memories were of trains and boats and coffee at
midnight on ferries and stages rocking across lonely places. For
him change was the breath of his life and regularity was death.</p>

<p>He held her hand and this too was as it had always been, for
even as a child it had been her voice comforting him, her
steadiness cheering him. It was her strength he fed on. He said:
"One thing I regret. We never should have come here."</p>

<p>"It has been a lovely year, Dad."</p>

<p>She had the power to take his doubts away; now he was pleased to
see that she believed in him. "Yes, it has been. And it was the
cheapest health cure we could find." Then another thought turned
him still and dreary and a pale shadow moved over his face and he
spoke from the farther corridors of his strength: "How much money
do we have left?"</p>

<p>Money was another responsibility he had never faced. She had
been the banker. Now, as before, she lied to him to save him from
one more gray fact he could never face. "About two hundred
dollars."</p>

<p>"Enough to get you out of here. You can't keep this homestead.
You wouldn't want to." He paused to struggle with his own
conscience. "I have never cared for your mother's people. They
disliked me when I married your mother and hated me when she died.
But they're well off and they'll be good to you. I can think of no
other way."</p>

<p>"All right, Dad."</p>

<p>It eased him to hear her approval. It took the last
responsibility from his shoulders, he who could not bear
responsibility. He smiled out of those blue eyes which held her
love so securely. A little of the old gay boyishness came back to
him and then, in accordance with his changeable mind and heart, it
went away. He lay quietly on the bed and she knew he would be
thinking of a poem out of Wordsworth or the glitter and laughter of
some great party in his younger years, or perhaps he was thinking
of tomorrow and the great day to come in another place.</p>

<p>"I leave you so little," he said. "Not even friends. We have
never stayed anywhere long enough to make friends."</p>

<p>"Everything," she said, "has been lovely. Always."</p>

<p>"You must not be too serious, Aurora. Let the solemn ones grind
out their souls by trying to shake the roots of the world. Life
will break you if you let it. Don't let it. Be gay. There is never
enough laughter, never enough laziness and dreaming. Remember one
thing when people speak those dismal words about duty and
usefulness and the necessity of making something great of your
life. Remember that the heart of a rose contains all the meaning
this world has for any of us. Its fragrance is yours for nothing.
Go to your mother's people, take a year in a finishing school.
Marry well and have a great house and bring people to it who are
wise and witty and full of pleasant nonsense."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Yes."</p>

<p>But, watching her, he had his moment of insight. "I think I have
made you old too soon. One of us had to do the worrying and you did
it. You do not know yourself. You have the capacity for loving some
man with your whole heart. If you find that man permit yourself to
love him. Ask no questions and have no doubts. That is the one
great adventure." And then, deeper and deeper along the black
tunnel into which he steadily receded, he said in a changed and
terrible voice: "Aurora&mdash;my life has been a failure." When she
touched his cheek she knew he was dead.</p>

<p>There was no shock. This event had been long foreshadowed and
her first thought as she bent to kiss him was that his face had
turned young and a little eager, as though, having stayed in one
place too long, the old excitement returned once more for his final
journey. She sat down in the doorway, her shoulder against its
edge, her arms idle in her lap. Her shoulder bent a little, her
head dropped.</p>

<p>Coming along the road, Jim Keene saw her in this attitude and
recognized her as the girl who had the previous night asked him
about the doctor. When he rode before the shanty she looked up and
he observed that the fear and strain of that occasion had been
replaced by an expression as near bottomless despair as he had ever
seen. As much as it was against his manners to dismount before
being invited, he stepped from the saddle and moved to the door and
saw the dead man inside.</p>

<p>"Your father?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>It was a tone of heartbreak, of a world fallen forever. She
wasn't crying. It looked to him as though her feelings were
deadlocked, leaving her wholly powerless; once in his own career he
had known something distantly similar when, struck in the pit of
the stomach, he could not breathe, speak or move. He sat down
beside her. "Maybe," he said, in the most sympathetic of voices, "I
can help," and took her shoulders and pulled her against his
chest.</p>

<p>He felt the quick loosening of her body and then he was
listening to the sudden onset of her crying.</p>

<p>He said nothing. He sat still, watching color come back to her
cheeks. Her hair was a solid black, lustrous in the sunlight; the
smell of it was sweet. She was tall for a woman and her shoulders
were square and strong, and there was a substance to her body; it
was warm and firm in his arms. Her skin was lightly browned by the
sun and her lips were broad and on the edge of being full&mdash;the
lips of a giving woman, but not of a pliant one. He had seen her
only once before, but even then she had left an impression with
him. The impression had remained.</p>

<p>The weight went suddenly from his arms; she straightened and
gave him a full, quick look in which he witnessed a self-willed
pride now deliberately shutting out the softer things he had
seen.</p>

<p>He stood up with his hat in his hand. A rider showed on the
desert, slowly jogging forward on a big horse&mdash;a nester riding
all arms and feet. The sun was half up in the east, red from late
fall's dust. Sagebrush carpeted the desert as far as sight ran. On
the southern horizon a blue haze beautifully shimmered. He said:
"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>She had never really noticed him before. Now it was his voice
that drew her attention, a voice soft as summer's wind. He was
young, his face long and thoughtful and thick-tanned from wind and
sun and from health. When he looked out upon the desert his lids
came together and she caught the poised and thorough alertness of
his attention, as though he lived on small margins of safety and
watched those margins with care. But when he turned to her she saw
the kindness of his eyes&mdash;and the approval in them.</p>

<p>Her deep beliefs were secret and lonely ones, seldom shared. It
surprised her to find she was explaining herself to him. "It was
always a bright and wonderful world for my father, with nothing
unkind in it. But at the last the color of it died out and that was
the greatest hurt he ever had. I think that is why I
cried&mdash;because he had to see anything dark."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Jim Keene, "it was kind of a desert dark, with the
stars all shining and the wind blowing cool from the west. When I
take the trail I'd like to start in shadows like that. You can't
see heaven when the sun's shining."</p>

<p>He had a voice with idle melody in it; he was thinking about her
and trying to be kind. Then she remembered the way he laughed when
he had shoved the drunk into Red John's arms. Behind that laughter
had been a full knowledge of his act and all that it might mean. He
was a strange man.</p>

<p>The rider came steadily up and rounded at the cabin, being
Spackman from the homestead two miles east. Spackman said: "Your
father better?"</p>

<p>She stood up. "He's dead, Fritz." That was all. It was a
simplicity, Keene thought, that cut through everything. She was
through crying and through being afraid.</p>

<p>"I will send the woman over," said Spackman. "I will send to
town for Ellenburg. It is necessary for the certificate. We must of
course bury him today."</p>

<p>"Yes, Fritz."</p>

<p>"So," said Spackman and turned away. "That's all you want?"</p>

<p>"When you come back," said Aurora Brant, "will you please bring
your wagon?"</p>

<p>"Also I will see Cannon. He will make the coffin and Mrs. Cannon
will line it as she did for my baby." He looked at Jim Keene, not
knowing him; but since there were necessary things to be done he
said to Keene, "You will dig," and rode away.</p>

<p>Aurora spoke to Keene: "I wouldn't want to delay you."</p>

<p>He said: "What is a day, or a year?"</p>

<p>He didn't understand the shadow which made its brief appearance
on her face. But she was thinking, "So Father would have
said."<br></p>
<br>

<p>She had asked that the grave be dug at the corner of the claim
which overlooked the river. Keene had finished this chore when he
saw her leave the crowd of neighbors at the house and cross the
field. She passed him and dropped to the edge of the bluff; and as
he came over to her he saw that she had her eyes on the cabin
beyond the ford. He sat down beside her and rolled up a cigarette.
For a moment her attention turned to him. She touched his hand.
"You've been good," she murmured, and then her mind traveled
away.</p>

<p>She had twenty dollars, not the two hundred she had told her
father; and she was alone. Never again would she watch her father's
face grow eager as he thought of moving to some new-promised
wonder; never again would she silently, wearily wait for that
eagerness to wear away and discontent to return. She had never let
him see how much she hated all that, how dreary a life it had been
for her. Gay and charming, he had taken pains to teach her many
things but he had never known how terrible a lesson in improvidence
he had furnished her, how great her hatred was of their
hand-to-mouth existence, the friendlessness of poverty, the cheap
hotel rooms in strange towns, the humiliation of pawning their
possessions to eat, the hours of waiting on dreary roads for a
friendly wagon to come by.</p>

<p>It had left in her a passionate resolve to possess something so
that she might look the world in the eye and be proud again. Never
henceforth would she be a shadow drifting along the earth; she
would take root and grow. No more gaiety, no more high-hearted
gambling with tomorrow, no more bright and gallant dawns fading
into empty sunsets. She would stay in one place, she would have one
spot on earth which belonged to her. That was her fixed resolve;
that was the hunger of her heart.</p>

<p>She wouldn't write her mother's people, for that was the old
story of improvidence again, another version of asking for a free
ride and a free meal. She would stay here. She had decided that
months ago when she realized her father could not live out the
summer. She wasn't a homestead woman and she couldn't handle a plow
like Mrs. Spackman but, looking across the river to the cabin, she
knew there was another way to survive. She would have a roof of her
own and be strong. She would ask nothing and she would work.</p>

<p>Keene said: "They're coming," and pulled her up. She stood by
the grave with Keene, watching the slow and heavy homestead men
come across the field with her father's coffin. The crowd made a
small ring around the grave and Elijah Patterson, who had once been
a preacher in the East, stood at the grave's head and made his
talk. All the neighbors had come, impelled by that feeling of help
which was so strong among the homesteaders. She noticed too that
Cleve Stewart, who owned the Chain and Ball outfit, stood by his
horse in the background. He was the only cattleman among them; she
remembered that.</p>

<p>Elijah Patterson had finished, and there was nothing left now
but to fill in the grave; the homestead men were waiting for her to
leave before they began that chore. She delayed a moment, every
memory of her father so clear, so painfully alive and dear; and
then she said goodbye to him and felt the strangeness of being
alone.</p>

<p>Keene turned her away. They walked back across the field to the
tar-paper shanty. The homesteaders drifted behind. Spackman came
up. "I brought the wagon."</p>

<p>"Will you help me load?"</p>

<p>Spackman went into the house with some of the other men; they
came out with Aurora Brant's possessions and lifted them to the
wagon&mdash;a stove, a bed, a trunk, a crate of dishes, and a board
table with its soap-box chairs. Keene noticed a rider follow from
the grave&mdash;a solid man with a square, outthrust chin. He was
around thirty, with the cattle trade stamped on him. He stood
before Aurora Brant, saying: "I'm sorry, Aurora." He glanced at the
things in the wagon and Keene noticed disappointment cross the
bulldog face. The man looked tough and he had the shoulders of a
fighter, but there was something different behind his
eyes&mdash;something perceiving and soft. "You're not moving?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Cleve."</p>

<p>"Come up to Chain and stay a few weeks," said Cleve Stewart.</p>

<p>The homesteaders stood in the background, listening. They stayed
away from the cattleman, watching him and not trusting him, not
easy in his presence. Once he looked beyond Aurora to them; and his
eyes were reserved and cool.</p>

<p>"I'll not be going far away," said Aurora. She paused and
watched him carefully. "Only across the ford to that cabin."</p>

<p>Spackman, rising to the wagon seat, had gotten as far as the
wheel hub. He dropped back to the ground. "What's that?" Mrs.
Cannon said, sharp and alarmed. "Aurora, don't you do that!"</p>

<p>Fear came out of these people like a smell. Keene, now watching
Cleve Stewart, noticed how grave his face became as he shook his
head. "You can't do that, Aurora."</p>

<p>She said: "Would the cattlemen kill a woman, Cleve?"</p>

<p>An embarrassed blush crossed his face; he dipped his chin toward
the ground. Keene looked across the river at the cabin and though
he didn't know the story he had seen enough in Prairie City to make
an accurate guess. There never was any change in this old hatred
between cattle and plow. He admired Aurora Brant for the way she
stood in the clear and sunless evening, for her simplicity, for the
will that shone out of her, for the changelessness of her
purpose.</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart said: "The cabin's on the wrong side of the river,
Aurora. It is on Broken Bit grass. I can't help you."</p>

<p>"I didn't ask for help, Cleve."</p>

<p>"Even if I could," said Stewart, struggling with his conscience,
"I wouldn't. I'm a ranch owner. I've got to protect my grass. I'd
have to stick with them when they protect their grass."</p>

<p>"Not your grass," said Aurora quietly. "It never was yours or
theirs. It belongs to the government. It is open to whoever files
on it."</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart started to speak, but he looked beyond Aurora to
the homesteaders and Keene saw the man slowly shut his mind against
them. These two worlds of cattle and plow had no meeting ground.
There could never be truce or tolerance between them. There could
never be anything but a fight for survival. All he said was: "I'm
sorry, Aurora."</p>

<p>Spackman spoke uncertainly: "I don't know about me drivin' over
there."</p>

<p>Keene said: "All right, I'll drive the wagon over." Stewart gave
Keene an affronted look. He recognized Keene's type at
once&mdash;one horseman instantly identifying another. He said:
"You're no nester, friend." Spackman made up his mind. "To hell
with those cowmen. I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Spackman," called his wife, "you be careful! You got enough
trouble."</p>

<p>But Spackman was a fighter. "We'll see," he said, and whipped
the team toward the ford.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Stewart. Tipping his hat to Aurora, he rode
away.<br></p>
<br>

<p>The stove had been set up in the yard, pending a thorough
cleaning of the log house; and Keene and Aurora had eaten. Now it
was a full star-shining dark with the river rustling on the gravel
ford and somewhere a coyote crying and wind moving cool and
soundless over the earth.</p>

<p>Keene said: "You'll need a man to set up that stove. You'll need
a man for a lot of things. How will you plow, how will you build a
fence?" After a thoughtful pause he added, "How will you
stick?"</p>

<p>She had learned his name only a moment before and used it now.
"I'll stick, Jim. I'll never move. Wait and see." Then she brought
her glance to his face. "But you'll not be here to see."</p>

<p>He stood by his horse, a thick raw-boned shadow in the darkness.
He was a man hard to know, he was different than any man she had
met. He was smiling and his voice had a soft, swinging tone. "Good
luck."</p>

<p>"You've been kind," she murmured, watching him rise to the
saddle. He removed his hat and he ceased to smile. He had touched
her life and now he was moving on. She found herself saying, "What
will you be doing?"</p>

<p>"Just riding&mdash;just looking."</p>

<p>"Jim," she said with a vehemence that surprised her, "never do
that! You'll grow old, you'll find nothing, you'll die
disappointed."</p>

<p>"What else can a man do?"</p>

<p>"Good luck," she said, and watched him disappear in the
shadows.</p>

<p>Coyotes were crying all through the ridges at either side of the
valley. She listened to Keene's horse tap a slow beat from the
earth and heard the sound die. Loneliness flowed in the shadows;
there were no homestead lights visible from this low side of the
river, no friendliness shining through the night. She turned into
the cabin and undressed and lay on the bed, hearing the steady
rustle of the water. She thought of her father and of his voice, so
eager and cheerful, and his smile which had taken the sting from
all his shortcomings. Sadness weighted her down; the sudden
solitariness of her life was new and hard to bear. But despite that
she was sure of her future. This cabin where a man had died was her
home. His name had been Garratt and that would be the name of the
settlement. She knew exactly what she would do; she drifted into
sleep.</p>

<p>She was roused by the sound of horses scuffing near the cabin
and the murmur of voices. Something struck against the iron stove
and a man cursed and the stove rang loud in the night and seemed to
fall from its legs. "Blackie," said a man, "that's a horse over
there. Take it along."</p>

<p>She flung on her robe and slid across the cabin's rough floor in
her bare feet and opened the door. She saw two riders on foot in
the foreground and two other men farther away. She called out: "Who
are you?"</p>

<p>One of the men called: "A woman!"</p>

<p>"Sister," said a voice, "you get the hell out of here tomorrow.
We're takin' the horse. You'll find it in three-four days,
somewhere out in the valley."</p>

<p>"Blackie," said one of the farther-stationed riders, "whut's
movin' over there beyond you?"</p>

<p>Blackie grunted as he turned. "Where?"</p>

<p>A gunshot made its dry, flat breach in the night. Aurora pulled
back from the door, seeing the short spurt of that weapon's muzzle.
Blackie ran into the deeper shadows; the other three men were
suddenly fighting their horses. Blackie yelled, "Wait!" The gun
spoke again, a bullet scuffed the earth. Blackie's horse reared
high in the darkness and ran off, leaving him afoot. Blackie was a
thin-bent shadow in the night as he raced toward the other three.
The gun steadily searched the yard. She saw Blackie lift himself
behind one of the riders. There was an answering fire from these
men. Powder smell filled the yard, but the first gun kept on,
patient and unhurried, and Blackie yelled in quick pain and then
the group rushed northward.</p>

<p>A man rose from the earth, walking forward. When he spoke Aurora
recognized Jim Keene's voice. There was amusement in it, as though
this had been an expected thing. "You're all right?"</p>

<p>"I thought you had gone."</p>

<p>He was before her. He was near enough for her to see his face.
He was smiling and pleased. "You see?" he said. "This is how it
will be."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," she said, "I'll send to town for a gun."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," he said, "I believe I'll stake out a claim around
here. It looks like fun."</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, "you're a man. They'll kill you."</p>

<p>The smile remained. She heard the soft, windy excitement in his
voice. "Mighty odd. I've ridden a thousand miles to keep out of
trouble and now that I look back it has been a dreary time. I think
I'll stand pat. Maybe what I want is here."</p>

<p>"What do you want, Jim?"</p>

<p>He said in a slow, half-puzzled way. "I thought it was peace and
quiet. Maybe it isn't that."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>III. &mdash; ON LOST MAN
RIDGE</h2>

<p class="first">THIS hour of the morning&mdash;it was before
five&mdash;contained a silence which picked up the crackling of the
fire and magnified it into minor explosions; the clank of the stove
lid rolled on and on across the valley. To either edge of the
valley the pine ridges, Lost Man Ridge in the east and Skull Ridge
to the west, stood purple-black in a sunless, glass-clear light.
Night's thin chill clung to the earth. Jim Keene, she noticed, had
camped a quarter mile up the creek. As soon as the coffee boiled
she called to him.</p>

<p>He came up on his horse, his hair wet from a swim in the creek.
He had a tremendous vitality. There was no morning sourness in him,
no sleepy irritability. The swim had brightened the blood glow of
his cheeks, the smell of coffee and bacon made him smile.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the coffee and bacon; she wasn't entirely certain
of that, for he watched her with the same awareness and approval
she had noticed the previous day. She was attractive in his eyes.
Those eyes made pictures of her which seemed to please him as he
sat down to eat breakfast.</p>

<p>"You slept well?"</p>

<p>"When I realized you were not far away," she admitted, "I slept
like a log. Today I'm going to town. Among other things, I'll get a
gun."</p>

<p>"I'll be around," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"I can't always be depending on you." Then, because she was more
curious and more hopeful than it was wise to be, she asked a
point-blank question. "What keeps you here?"</p>

<p>He smiled. His eyes had a long-reaching expression in them; even
as he studied her he was seeing things beyond her. His face was
alert and a small swift air of excitement brushed fugitively across
it. "What makes a man travel," he said in his soft voice, "what
makes him stop?" He changed the subject. "I'll be around while
you're gone. The boys might figure to burn the cabin."</p>

<p>"I'd build another one," she answered at once. "I'm going to
stay. Do you see what I see here?"</p>

<p>"Nice valley and fine grass. It is better land than across the
river. But that will help you none. You can't farm alone."</p>

<p>"Here's the road from Prairie City. There's the road running
along the edge of the river from Wells to Argonaut. Everything
meets here where they cross. That's the way towns are made."</p>

<p>"But nothing stops here," he pointed out. "The cattle outfits
will see to that."</p>

<p>"Maybe," she murmured. "But they can't shoot a woman." She rose
and washed the dishes. Afterwards she saddled her horse for a trip
to town. Idle against the house corner, he noticed on her face a
mild expression of stubbornness, as though she foresaw trouble and
was prepared for it. It turned her into a cool self-contained woman
who wanted her own way and meant to have it. Sunlight burst over
Lost Man Ridge, changing valley grass from gray to amber gold in
one dramatic transition; the coolness of night evaporated. He
watched her pull up her shoulders, the way her body changed curves
when she settled on the saddle. Her lips were red and when she
looked down at him an expression formed on them and went away. Her
lips, he had discovered, were the first to show her thought; and
now they didn't match the resolution of her face. She was two
different persons.</p>

<p>She started from the yard. Beyond the house she swung the horse
to look back at him and in her glance then was a woman's inevitable
contradiction&mdash;a worry for him and a pleased awareness of his
presence. She said: "You shouldn't be here, Jim, but I'm glad you
are."</p>

<p>She crossed the ford and let the horse have its morning run;
thereafter she settled to an alternate run and walk through the
streaming sunlight, through late fall's golden haze. The sagebrush
flats ran on and on, broken by the dotted shapes of homestead
houses. In the air was the dry, tickling pungence of cured grass
and sage and the oncoming smell of winter. It was a morning that,
like all desert mornings, held a tonic freshness, buoying her and
making her believe anything was possible. At this precise moment
she needed desperately to believe that.</p>

<p>Yet when she reached Prairie City and racked the horse in front
of Worsham and Ross most of the confidence was gone. She faced the
store's doorway, watching Worsham wait on a customer, and for a
moment the purpose which had brought her here almost died. All that
held it was the memory of those long years in which her father had
run away from every decision and every showdown. She thought in
half panic: "This can't be in me. I must never run, never give up.
I've got to start now. I've got to go forward. I've got to."
Worsham's customer came out of the store. Aurora went in.</p>

<p>It was easier to talk to him when he was alone and his pleasant
manner helped. He said: "I heard about your dad. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>She said: "I wanted to talk to you."</p>

<p>She saw the immediate change, the withdrawal of sympathy and the
onset of reserve. A thousand requests from impoverished
homesteaders had given him a protective intuition. She could see
his mind reaching for the old, ready answer. "Been a hard year," he
offered. "Times bad for all of us."</p>

<p>"I have moved over to the Garratt place, across the Silver Bow
ford."</p>

<p>"I'd heard."</p>

<p>"So soon?"</p>

<p>His answer was dry. "That kind of news travels fast." His hand
moved along the counter, the signal of his desire to be about his
work. It was difficult for her to go on and his manner took all the
conviction from her voice. "It is a long ride for the homesteaders
into town for supplies. They'd be better customers if they had a
store near them. I'd like to start one at the ford. I thought you
might be interested in stocking it on credit for me. A fifty-fifty
partnership."</p>

<p>He said: "Why move across the river to start it?"</p>

<p>She drew a cross on the table with her finger. "Here's the road
up the valley. Here's the road running along the river. They meet
at Garratt's cabin. All travelers meet there."</p>

<p>The skeptic dryness increased. "What travelers?"</p>

<p>"Not long from now," she said, "the valley will be lull of
homesteads. People will be using those roads."</p>

<p>"Not while Broken Bit's there they won't."</p>

<p>"You're not interested?"</p>

<p>"No," said Worsham.</p>

<p>She went into the sunlight and moved along the walk without
conscious direction. Her mouth was dry and she thought quickly back
over the talk and remembered all the things she had forgotten to
say. Her fear of failure increased and she was self-conscious
enough in this new role to believe the town had its eyes on her.
This, she realized, was why her father had always run away. He had
been too sensitive to endure rebuff.</p>

<p>She arrived at the corner of the bank building and stopped and
now found herself looking fixedly at the small bank window. Tim
Sullivan, who ran the Cattleman's Palace, came from the bank with a
canvas sack of silver coins; he tipped his hat and she said
mechanically, "Good morning," and for a moment his bright eyes
studied her. Then he went on.</p>

<p>She thought: "I must not be afraid," and went into the bank. She
had met the banker only once during the year she had lived on the
Silver Bow, and had been impressed by his kindness. He was kind
now. He stood behind the counter and listened to her and she didn't
see Worsham's cold, withdrawing expression on his face. He waited
until she had said everything she wanted to say, but when she had
finished she learned that men had many ways of listening and of
saying no.</p>

<p>"You don't know business very well, Miss Brant," he told her.
"Broken Bit is my big customer. What would it say if I loaned money
to you?"</p>

<p>"Isn't there room for everybody on the desert?"</p>

<p>"If I helped you Grat DePard would be here before sundown." His
voice was sympathetic; it cushioned his refusal. "What would be
your security?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"You see? After all, it isn't my money&mdash;it's the
depositors'." He smiled the sting away as he had learned to do long
ago in his business. Then he added with a touch of fatherliness:
"This is a lonesome country for a woman. There are a hundred good
single men here&mdash;in town or on the desert. Have you thought of
that?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "but thank you," and left the bank at the same
moment Jesse Morspeare came from Worsham's store and moved toward
her. She knew, from his half-satisfied stare, that he had
discovered her errand. He went by her into the bank, the weight of
his body brushing slightly against her shoulder. Presently she
heard him grumbling at the banker. She wasn't afraid any more but a
kind of iron band closed around her head as she tried to think of
other sources, other means; her mind kept circling and coming back,
finding nothing. Dust puffed up from the traveling hoofs of a
passing rider; a swamper slowly swept refuse through the saloon's
doorway and even at this distance the stale smell of whisky and old
tobacco smoke was a rank emanation. Above the saloon four windows
showed half-drawn curtains. A woman looked from one of these, at
Aurora, still-caught by her curiosity or her envy. Aurora lowered
her eyes. Tim Sullivan stood in a patch of sunlight by the saloon
wall, a cloud of cigar smoke covering his face. Aurora knew he was
watching her. It was near noon and hunger turned her toward the
hotel. Moving along the walk, she held her shoulders up, her chin
up. She looked straight ahead and held her lips together. She went
into the hotel's empty dining room.</p>

<p>She sat with both hands in her lap, remembering the banker's
hint of marriage. There were few things a woman could do for
herself in a man's world. She had heard that many times, but now
she knew what it meant. She could marry, she could live on the
bounty of relations or she could do as the woman above the saloon
did. She moved the pewter caster around and around with the tip of
her finger. Her eyes were gray against the inshining sunlight; she
was outwardly composed but her mind kept pounding at the barriers
and found no weak spot. The waitress brought on the meal, family
style, and steps beat along the room. Looking up, she saw Tim
Sullivan paused near her.</p>

<p>His voice was extremely courteous. "My respects to you
concernin' your father," but a moment later the waitress went back
to the kitchen and then Sullivan's bright Irish eyes showed a
worldly, amused wisdom. "You got no help."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And the news is out, like news always is, and Grat will be
havin' his private laugh."</p>

<p>"Is that the reason?"</p>

<p>"'Tis Grat's town, is it not, and his desert?"</p>

<p>"Sit down."</p>

<p>He showed a small surprise; his eyes sobered. "That was a kind
heart speakin'. But I'll stand." He was a stubby man with soft
hands, with an Irishman's rich complexion and a saloon man's
thorough knowledge of the sins of men tucked in the knowing corners
of his face. It was a politician's face. Behind its affability lay
an opportunist's acceptance of the world as he found it. But in
Sullivan, as in every Irishman, was one hot streak of ancient
dissent which occasionally had its way. He said now, softly, for no
other ears than Aurora Brant's: "Now I like to see spunk and it is
born in me to love a fight and see a great man fall. You should not
have asked Worsham, or the bank. Do you not know that money is a
timid thing? Men who have it fear the world, and themselves even.
Have you seen the week's paper?"</p>

<p>He had the paper folded in his pocket. He brought it out and
placed it on the table before her, still folded. He said: "I should
not open it, were I you, till you had the evenin' heavy on your
hands at home."</p>

<p>She put her hand on it and knew its inner folds contained
something. She saw the edge of greenbacks. She looked up at him in
astonishment and found his eyes dancing with the pleasure of his
own intrigue. She said: "I've nothing to give you."</p>

<p>"And did I ask it?" he retorted. "On my poker tables there is a
little slot in the center, down which a man drops a white chip each
deal. That is for the house. If a man plays long enough, no matter
how much he may win, the house will have it all at last. I am
comfortable. But comfort is poor diet for an Irishman. Didn't I
tell you I love a fighter?"</p>

<p>She was so long silent that he at last said with some concern:
"It comes from a saloon man. It is the money of appetite. But you'd
not refuse it for that?"</p>

<p>"No," she said gently, "I am thinking of how long you may have
to wait before I repay you."</p>

<p>"Ah, that," he said, and dropped his voice until the words only
rubbed in his throat. "This will be our private affair. And do your
buying not here but at Argonaut. Now you must find a man who will
drive a wagon for you."</p>

<p>"I will find one."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it will not be like that. By tomorrow Grat will
have word around and 'twill be worth a man's life to touch a horse
for your sake." He looked at the floor, taking her troubles to him
and seeing things to worry about which she couldn't see. The
waitress came out of the kitchen. Tim Sullivan spoke in his
heartiest voice, "I knew you'd like to see a paper from your old
hometown," and left the dining room.</p>

<p>She was no longer hungry but a sense of economy forced her to
eat the meal. As soon as she had finished she returned to the
street and went into Caples' hardware store, buying a secondhand
Winchester and a box of cartridges. It was past one o'clock when
she left Prairie.</p>

<p>Jesse Morspeare came up to the bar and faced Sullivan. "That
girl's after money. Get any from you?" Sullivan laughed in his
face. "Now what would a nice lady be doin' askin' favors from the
notorious Sullivan?" He moved a bottle from the back bar, placed it
before the big man, and suavely changed the thought in Jesse
Morspeare's unwieldy mind. "You've got an imposin' bulk for a star,
Jesse."</p>

<p>That part of Sullivan which was pure cynic despised the
gratitude which the buttered compliment produced; the softer side
of Sullivan pitied what he saw. "You think so?" asked Morspeare,
hungry to hear more. "Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Sullivan. "As sheriff you'll stand like a
rock."</p>

<p>"I'll win," said Morspeare. "Grat's roundin' up the votes. I'll
get the cattle bunch solid." He was a slow and dull-witted creature
who had nothing but great physical strength; that and an abject
respect for Grat DePard. When Jesse got to be sheriff, Sullivan
reasoned, he would be Grat's faithful dog. He had smashed the
homesteader Spackman to the dust not because he had any particular
grudge against Spackman, but to demonstrate his loyalty to cattle;
and never for a moment had he realized the brutality of that act. A
clever man like Grat would hold him by the nose and lead him
without difficulty. Without that guidance Jesse would be a loose
and terrible animal.</p>

<p>Jesse turned from the bar. "I got to tell Grat whut she's
after." The swamper came through the doorway the same moment Jesse
reached it. Jesse's elbow lifted slyly and caught the swamper in
the stomach, slamming him against the doorsill. Jesse grinned at
the swamper and went out. A dismal spasm ran across the swamper's
face; he faced his hands over his belly and a sucking gust of air
rushed into his wide-open mouth. He moved his head at Sullivan,
pale and helpless. Sullivan's teeth bit into his cigar; he didn't
speak until his voice could be soft. "Never mind, Tonk. That little
trick will kill him one of these days."</p>

<p>Keene watched Aurora disappear beyond the opposite rim of the
river bluff, attracted by the shape she made in the sun, in the
golden haze of dust. These were the things, though he didn't know
it, his senses forever awaited in eagerness&mdash;sounds and blends
of fragrance and scenes which took fugitive shape and left their
unforgettable impressions: the single moment when a campfire flame
formed a perfect taper against the heart of night; the echo of one
word spoken by a woman from the depths of her soul; the cold and
immaculate deadliness of a diamond-back coiled at the instant of
striking; the thread of some strange smell in the spring wind
which, caught briefly and by accident, broke every old thread of a
man's career and set him off on strange roads. These were the
fragments of a greater mystery, the revealed pieces of an
unrevealed puzzle whose answer he sought&mdash;yet knew not that he
sought it. All the cold ashes of his campfires made an unerring
line of search. Some duty, some labor, some love.
Somewhere&mdash;</p>

<p>He took the ax and shovel from Aurora Brant's piled possessions
and rode out upon Cloud Valley, aiming at Lost Man Ridge a mile
east. He crossed a shallow sparkling oxbow bend of the creek,
passed through knee-high meadow grass turned amber by the sun and
softly furrowed by the wind. At the foot of the ridge he paused to
scan the dark edge of timber above him. A crow flapped heavily from
a treetop and Keene's glance whipped to that area in the timber, a
never-dead suspicion clawing its way to the surface. But the crow
fled without making its harsh warning cry and presently his
alertness relaxed. The ridge carried him up a hundred feet so that
he saw the long course of the valley and the figure of a single
rider moving along the road in the direction of the ford.</p>

<p>In the timber he hunted up a few thin pines and cut and trimmed
them. During the rest of the morning he dragged them to Aurora's
cabin to furnish a temporary supply of wood. Meanwhile as he rode
he decided upon the location of a cabin site for himself. His
preference was for a small baylike recess in the ridge which made a
shelter from the winds, but if it gave him shelter it was also a
trap in time of trouble, permitting a marksman to come to the near
edge of the pines and wait for a shot. Therefore he chose a spot by
the oxbow bend of the creek in the middle of the valley, half a
mile north of Aurora Brant's.</p>

<p>He cooked his coffee and fried his bacon and ate beside the
creek. He marked out a small room on the ground&mdash;with an
adjoining lean-to extension for his horse&mdash;and fell to cutting
strips of sod two feet square. By the middle of the afternoon,
working steadily along, he had the walls of the soddy begun. Riding
had toughened him but this kind of labor pulled at muscles he
seldom used and brought the fresh salt sweat to his cheeks. All his
life he had handled horses and cattle, looking down upon a
homesteader's endless chores with a horseman's disdain. Now here he
was grubbing at the earth in the manner of the homesteader. He
straightened and laughed outright and then he ceased to laugh. Why
was he staying?</p>

<p>Maybe, he thought hopefully, it was natural for a man to grow
weary of riding and to rest awhile. But he remembered Jesse
Morspeare using his huge hands to club Spackman into the dust and
he remembered Aurora Brant facing the cattle outfits
alone&mdash;and he knew he was lying to himself. These homesteaders
were humble people wishing for peace, knowing nothing about the
ways of the gun. They were the lambs in the field to DePard and
Morspeare and Red John. This was why he stayed.</p>

<p>He was again silently laughing at a man who, deliberately riding
away from trouble, paused deliberately to invite other trouble. In
his amusement was a regret at the passage of an illusion&mdash;the
illusion that he could change himself; in it too were the relief
and the certainty which come to one who, long idle, returns to his
old and familiar trade.</p>

<p>A rider emerged from the timber on the western ridge, quartering
into the valley. Keene moved over to the corner of the soddy and
belted on his gun, and returned to his shovel; presently he saw it
was a girl riding with that rhythm which comes only to those born
and weaned on a saddle. She rounded before him and spoke in
bluntest manner. "This year you dig out the grass and next year it
will be weeds."</p>

<p>He propped himself against the shovel. Sweat ran down his cheek
hollows; his cotton shirt clung to his long chest and when he
smiled at her wrinkles cut a fine-netted pattern around the edge of
his eyes. She appraised him in a single, surprised inspection.</p>

<p>"You're no homesteader. That shovel looks as funny in your hands
as a woman's bonnet would on your head."</p>

<p>He said: "Now that's speaking straight out."</p>

<p>"You're a rider. Stick with your own kind. If you want a job
come up to my father's ranch. The Crews outfit&mdash;Rafter T. Stop
making a fool of yourself with a shovel. Don't you know a cowhand
is a miserable man off a horse? I'm Portia Crews. You want the
job?"</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>Her eyelids crept nearer. She looked down with a slanting,
inquisitive glance and broke the horse from its impatient fiddling
with one competent twist of the reins. She had yellow hair and an
oval face on which sunlight pleasantly fell. There was a faint
high-handedness in her manner, a freedom and an authority. Yet she
was an attractive girl who could change her temper whenever she
wished; having come here to give him hell, she recognized one of
her own kind and was full of interest and friendly motive.</p>

<p>"I heard you were a little bit tough," she reflected. "Thought
I'd find out. Red John told me. You're the fellow who tossed Snap
in Red John's lap last night. Red John didn't care for that. He's a
bad man to make an enemy of."</p>

<p>"So I gathered."</p>

<p>She listened to him with her head aside. Her eyes were hazel.
They opened fully on him to let out a woman's centered personal
interest. "I guess you would gather that. You're one of these quick
ones. You do a lot of figuring. You're figuring me now. What's your
name?"</p>

<p>"Jim Keene."</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, "what's all this&mdash;a bet you made when you
were drunk? You know this is no good. Every time you dig up a
shovel of that ground you feel silly. Can you feature yourself
milking a cow or walking peg-legged behind a plow? No, you
can't."</p>

<p>He said, idly: "I'm saddle-sore and I'm tired of the sight of my
shadow."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said. "Then you haven't been drunk lately. Maybe it's
what you need. I know your kind." Her voice dropped softly on him.
"Running off from something. From trouble." Her question was light
and quick and insistent. "A woman?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"You're probably a smooth liar," she observed, holding his
attention with her glance. She hadn't smiled at him yet but her
eyes lightened as she read him; color ran across her face and her
hands moved on the saddle-horn. She had a firm-rounded body filled
with a vitality that produced its physical reaction in him. There
was an unconscious daring to her personality, a frank aliveness.
When she spoke again he had the impression she had made her
judgment of him and would never change it. "You can't stay here.
Grat will kill you."</p>

<p>"The gentleman has horns? Fur on his knees?"</p>

<p>Listening to his voice, Portia Crews liked the music it made and
the little edge of irony it held. For the first time during the
meeting she took her eyes from him. She thought: He's no fool. He's
used his gun. He knows about those things. He's
dangerous&mdash;he's kind. Which is he the most of? How does he
like his women&mdash;what does he do with them?</p>

<p>She had her glance on the cabin down the creek and then she
remembered something and brought her attention back to Keene.</p>

<p>"I hear that homestead girl has moved to the cabin."</p>

<p>"Last night."</p>

<p>Portia Crews murmured, "So," in a long, speculating breath and
searched his face for a sign. She saw only a poker expression which
told her nothing, and reined her horse about. But she turned to add
as a casual afterthought: "If you ride up our way the door's
open."</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, and watched her fade across the grassland at
a steady run. Everything she did was done without delay. He rolled
a smoke and found himself weary of piling sod. He abandoned the job
and rode over to the trees to cut a ridgepole and rafters. It was
four o'clock then and Aurora Brant had not yet returned. When he
reached the top of the ridge he saw a single rider advancing across
the Silver Bow flats toward the ford, and believed it to be her.
Sunlight, low in the west, threw long reddening waves of light
across the sagelands. All the horizons were filled with a powder
haze.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>IV. &mdash; DESERT AUTOCRAT</h2>

<p class="first">DURING the middle of the afternoon Grat DePard
came down to the Black Bluff ford, twelve miles east of Aurora
Brant's place, with four hundred steers intended for the railroad
stock pens in Prairie. Red John and a crew of five did the moving,
but DePard went along to be sure they were not pushing the beef too
fast, thereby reducing the marketable poundage. For Grat DePard was
an owner who ran his outfit with a hard fist and permitted no
variation from his instructions.</p>

<p>In those hills he was the largest owner and the greatest power.
Rough and illiterate as he was, some bitter brand of ambition drove
him through alternate tempers; he could be cunning and soft, he
could rise to a tremendous rage. In every respect he was the desert
autocrat insisting upon his rights and his authority, suspicious
always, a grasper of pennies and a watcher of potato parings in his
kitchen, a schemer of great schemes, a respecter of one thing
only&mdash;power. He was a sagebrush Prussian general on his horse,
planning his own distant ends.</p>

<p>Jesse Morspeare, riding down the Silver Bow, found him here and
gave him the news.</p>

<p>"Money?" said DePard. "What for?"</p>

<p>"She wants to set up a store in Garret's old cabin," said Jesse
Morspeare, and held himself respectfully still, anxiously wanting
to be important in Grat DePard's eyes.</p>

<p>DePard rode to the ford, talked a moment with the crew, and came
back with Red John. He said: "We'll go see that woman," and turned
his horse. The three rode westward along the rim of the river.</p>

<p>Morspeare said: "Think I'll win, Grat?"</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that."</p>

<p>"Lot of homesteaders against us."</p>

<p>Grat DePard looked at Morespeare. "Be a good idea if you'd keep
your damned dumb hands off those people until the election's
over."</p>

<p>"You mean Spackman?" asked Morspeare anxiously. "I was only
tryin' to show the ranch boys I was on their side."</p>

<p>"They knew that already. You go back to town and keep your feet
where they won't hurt anybody."</p>

<p>Morespeare obediently swung away. Red John grinned. "You'd do
just as well to run an ape for sheriff. Jesse ain't bright."</p>

<p>"I'll furnish the thinking."</p>

<p>Short of sundown they splashed across the shallow ford and came
upon the yard of the Garratt cabin. Aurora had arrived home a few
minutes before and was inside; when she came out and thus
unexpectedly faced them she had an instant of shock which brought
her to a sudden halt at the doorway. Immediately she thought of the
rifle she had bought in town. It lay unloaded on the table behind
her.</p>

<p>Red John first compelled her attention by the attack of an
unmistakably acquisitive glance which went along her body with a
complete interest. He was a full-blooded man, thoroughly sure of
himself and never doubtful of his mastery. She saw the bright
hunting glint flare in his eyes and at once turned her face to Grat
DePard.</p>

<p>DePard spoke in a way that was like the personal pronouncement
of law. He was so certain that he didn't even bother to threaten
her. "You'll get no money and you'll start no store, neither on
this side of the river nor on the other. As for homesteading.
You're plainly not able to do it. Even if you were able. I wouldn't
permit you to break this sod. This is my graze. You knew that when
you moved over. Maybe you believed I'd let you stay, you being a
woman. I'm a businessman first and a gentleman second. You move
back where you came from. Better if you left the country
altogether."</p>

<p>"Is this your land, Mr. DePard?"</p>

<p>"My land."</p>

<p>From the corner of her eyes she noticed Jim Keene coming across
the valley at a steady run. "You are mistaken," she said. "This is
government land. You know that."</p>

<p>DePard waved it aside. "Let's not talk about it. You've been in
this country long enough to know law is one thing and possession
another. I've got possession. Law or no law, I won't let
homesteaders break up my graze. If I did I'd be out of business.
You're a practical woman. You fight for your rights. So do I. If
you were in my place you'd be doing the same thing I'm doing. I
admire your courage, but you ain't staying."</p>

<p>Keene came into the yard. He stopped his pony and leaned back on
the saddle and she noticed the same expression on his face she had
seen in Prairie the previous night&mdash;the alert interest
breaking through idle composure. His arrival produced a change in
the yard at once. Grat DePard threw a swift glance at him and
afterwards ignored him. Bui Red John was no longer self-contented;
he swung his horse to face Keene and he placed a close watch on
him, his own muscles obviously tightened for anything that might
come. His assurance, Aurora thought, seemed to have been jarred,
and for some reason he hated Keene at once.</p>

<p>She spoke to DePard. "Would you shoot a woman, Mr.
DePard&mdash;as you did Garratt?"</p>

<p>Red's glance moved at her. His eyes widened, he stirred his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"I can skin cats in a lot of ways," said DePard. "Think about
that."</p>

<p>"Would you have your men shoot me?" she insisted.</p>

<p>Irritation came to DePard's voice. "Never mind the questions.
There'll be no shooting, but you'll go."</p>

<p>She wondered at Keene's continuing silence. He sat on the horse
and seemed to be lost in pleasant memories. Smoke curled around his
eyes and his hands were folded on the saddlehorn. She turned into
the house and got the Winchester and came to the doorway again.</p>

<p>Red John said, "Now, now," and liked the sudden turn of the
scene not at all. He wheeled his horse to face Aurora and threw a
questioning look at DePard. The situation had gotten out of control
for Red John; he was up against the unknown factor of a woman with
a gun. DePard straightened, immediately pulling his muscles
tight.</p>

<p>"Have you ever had a woman shoot at you, Mr. DePard?" asked
Aurora.</p>

<p>DePard shrugged his shoulders. "I thought you were a practical
girl. Maybe I better point out you can't stand in that door with a
gun twenty-four hours a day."</p>

<p>"You're accustomed to having other men do your dirty chores,"
she observed. "But if they touch me or anything that is mine I'll
know that you ordered it. You've taught me a trick. You ride
through this country a good deal&mdash;through the hills at night.
You can't always be watching the brush, can you?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that to me, girl," said DePard, wounded to the
pith of his vanity. "Try that and I'll put you in jail. There's law
to cover that."</p>

<p>"What law?" she asked him, so gently. "We are practical people.
That is what you said. The law will do you no good if you're shot
from ambush."</p>

<p>DePard said nothing more. Wrenching his horse around he beckoned
at Red and raced away with the foreman behind him.</p>

<p>Keene said: "Fine&mdash;fine."</p>

<p>She was weak, her courage was gone.</p>

<p>"They'll leave me alone, Jim." she murmured and desperately
tried to believe it.</p>

<p>He said: "Can you shoot?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You've made your bluff. Never back up on it. If I'm not around
and a Broken Bit man passes within fifty feet of this cabin throw a
bullet at him. I never saw a man yet who liked that." He had kept
his eyes on the departing pair and now saw them stop a short
distance down the valley. Presently Red John came back, made a wide
sweep of the house and crossed the ford to the Silver Bow flats.
Grat DePard continued up the valley. Keene turned his horse and
moved out on the heels of the Broken Bit owner.</p>

<p>Grat DePard had said to Red John: "Go back to the flats. You
tell those homesteaders if they give that girl any help of any kind
they'll suffer for it. Tell them I don't want to catch any of them
on this side of the river at any time."</p>

<p>Red John went away. Grat DePard moved up the valley, his temper
simmering in him, his mind quick and crafty. He didn't look back
but he knew Keene was following him. He had deliberately ignored
Keene during the talk with Aurora Brant. Recognizing Keene's type
at first glance, he had not quite been able to gauge his
possibilities, and therefore had let him alone; for DePard,
autocratic as he was, never quarreled with a man until he knew the
strength of the man and never picked a fight until he had chosen
his own ground. When he reached the beginnings of Keene's dugout
and realized that Keene was still coming, he turned his horse and
waited.</p>

<p>When Keene came up the first thing DePard said was:</p>

<p>"This yours?"</p>

<p>"Mine. Any comments?"</p>

<p>DePard permitted himself no hard words then for he saw he faced
a bad moment. Keene gave him a glance that startled him to the
bottom of his belly, it was so openly in search of trouble. This
wasn't the same man at all. DePard said guardedly:</p>

<p>"What are you hot about, friend?"</p>

<p>Keene said: "You damned mongrel&mdash;you're yellow."</p>

<p>DePard spoke through his close lips. "In that, friend, you are
mistaken." His left hand held the reins above the horn, never
moving; his right hand was carefully on the pommel; and thus he
held himself together, riding out this terrible moment. He knew his
own ability as a fighter but he could only guess about this other
man's skill; and his guess, when he made it, bothered him
considerably. Keene's readiness came right at his teeth; the man
wanted to fight. So, unsure of his chances, DePard made his own
silent play for survival.</p>

<p>Keene circled his pony completely around DePard. DePard remained
rigid, not venturing to look back. The sun was down and grayness
ran in sheets across the flats, and in this grayness DePard's face
was strained and dark. Keene faced him again. Keene said: "You've
got that girl worried. Don't bother her again." DePard made no move
until Keene gave him a nod; and then he rode northward, sitting
rigid on the saddle and making no extra motion with his hands until
the back of his neck loosened. Then he reached for a cigar and
looked at his fingers when he lighted the match. He was sweating
but his hands were steady. He drew a great breath of smoke into his
lungs, relishing the bite of that smoke; and he had his moment of
triumph in realizing that his ability to be humble had saved him
from disaster.</p>

<p>What puzzled him was Keene's quick change of temper. In the
store yard Keene had rested silent on his saddle; during the next
few minutes he had changed to a fellow plainly ready to kill.
Remembering that recent scene, DePard felt the backlash of its
possibilities. For a fact, something very close to death had jumped
straight out of the twilight at him.</p>

<p>"Mighty proud," reflected DePard. "And mighty foolish unless he
had a scheme in his bonnet. What'd he do it for?"</p>

<p>The memory of his own part in the scene, strangely, did not
humiliate him. For DePard was a man who, despising the human race
in general, held an enormous respect for courage when he saw it. To
DePard a man was top dog or he wasn't; the top dog showed his teeth
and the bottom dog ran away. Whatever was good belonged to the top
dog if he could take it. It occurred to him now that he had met a
man pretty much like himself, a fellow who knew his own strength
and had no scruples about using it. That kind was pretty rare; also
that kind, in competition with his own ambitions, made the valley
too small. "He's here for something," thought DePard, "and I'll
find out. Two of us is too many unless we're on the same side of
the fence. Now there's a thought." Riding up Cloud Valley, Grat
DePard made his plans.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Red John rode into the Spackman yard. "Spackman," he called,
"come here," and enjoyed the cracking tear he saw on Spackman's
face when the latter came to the door. It was growing into dark at
the moment and Spackman made a fine silhouette against the house
light. Red John said: "Keep away from that girl and give her no
help. And don't cross that river. You don't want trouble, do you?"
He left the yard without listening to Spackman's answer.</p>

<p>Seeing Spackman's bravery waver amused Red John, who had no
liking for homesteaders. He dropped his message at Cobb's and at
Lacey's, at Cannon's. Cannon and Cannon's wife and children were in
the soft dusk of the yard, and Jennie came to the kitchen doorway.
For the first time this night Red John put on a friendly air; he
dropped his hint in a neighborly fashion&mdash;as though it were a
favor he asked. Jennie's face showed him a smothered excitement and
he let his glance cling to her, passing a message over the
distance. When he left the yard he thought he had seen an answer.
All women liked to be hunted and differed only in the way they
wished to be caught. This was a girl that liked mystery; that was
the way she wanted to be caught, Red John guessed. Swinging down
the prairie he paused at Hoeffer's shanty and completed his errand
at the Connie place. Heading back to the ford he followed the river
bluff, this bringing him near the Cannon place again. Dusk had
changed to night and presently he saw the shape of Jennie Cannon in
the silver shadows. She had caught his message and she had
answered. He got down from the horse.</p>

<p>Her face was white and vague in the darkness: she remained
still, waiting for him to break the silence. He knew she had
deliberately put herself where he might find her.</p>

<p>He said: "You see, Jennie, I don't have horns."</p>

<p>"I guess you've known a lot of women. I heard that." She was
just a homestead girl but she wanted to try her luck on a man who
knew women. She wanted to see if she had the pull other women had;
she wanted to sharpen her skill on him. Most women were like
that.</p>

<p>"I like pretty girls," he said. "You're the prettiest."</p>

<p>"You're just saying that," she retorted. But the compliment did
something to her voice. Red John, who had experience at this,
touched her carefully on the shoulder and waited to see if she drew
back. She didn't draw back and that was enough for him to know. He
pulled her forward and kissed her. She gave him no encouragement,
but she didn't fight him; she was experimenting with him and with
herself&mdash;half cold and half warm. Red John stepped away. He
had started this with an amused confidence; but she had gotten into
him and had set him afire. His voice revealed the rough, hot
agitation he felt. "Listen, Jennie, you're sweet."</p>

<p>She laughed at him. She was cooler than he; she was surer. "Is
that how you say it to the others?" she murmured. He reached for
her again, unsatisfied with half a capture, outraged by her
laughter and her assurance. She faded from him, running toward the
house, her amusement softly drifting back.</p>

<p>Red John stepped to the saddle, liking this episode not at all.
Somehow, she had beaten him at the game, and she had gotten under
his skin. She knew it, he thought irritably; her laughter said so.
He broke into a steady run, tantalized by the door she had left
half open and thinking already of the next meeting. He'd come back.
She knew that too. A girl like Jennie liked to play with fire, but
pretty soon she got burned. Every dealing he had had with women
told him so.</p>

<p>A rider crossed before him, bound toward the Cannon house, and
in the shadows Red John made out young Joe Spackman, who was
Jennie's steady man. Red John thought in sour amusement: "That's
one kiss he won't get."<br></p>
<br>

<p>The valley was a dull bed of silver under the night: out of it
came the soft ruffle of wind-stirred grasses. In the sky from rim
to rim stars made their cloudy glitter. Keene stood in the yard,
hearing a rider splash across the ford and make a wide circle of
the cabin; he heard the rider go northward at a steady, dying run.
That, he guessed, would be Red John returning to Broken Bit. And
because every move in this game was familiar to him, Keene knew
what Red John had been doing across the river.</p>

<p>Aurora Brant came to the doorway of the cabin, framed against
the light. She had already explained her trip to Prairie City to
him&mdash;and now added: "I stopped by Spackman's on the way home
this afternoon. He's agreed to freight the store stock from
Argonaut."</p>

<p>"You're pretty against the light. Pretty&mdash;but a
target."</p>

<p>She stepped from the doorway and put her shoulders to the cabin
wall. "You know so many things like that. It is the sort of an
education that should have made you very hard. But you aren't."
Then she turned the subject, "I'll never understand what was in
Sullivan's mind when he offered me that money. It was a kindness I
never expected."</p>

<p>"He saw you walking on the street. Next thing he knew the idea
came to him&mdash;and he did it. That's the way it happens to a
man."</p>

<p>"He had no reason for it."</p>

<p>"Reason means nothing. It is just what comes to a man. When it
comes, he's got to do it."</p>

<p>She said: "You haven't said much about my store, Jim. I think
you feel I'm not wise."</p>

<p>"You want to do it, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then that's excuse enough. You don't have to figure if you're
wise. It makes no difference."</p>

<p>"No, Jim. I need to know where I'm going&mdash;and why."</p>

<p>He said gently: "Look up at the stars. Where are they
going?"</p>

<p>The ford's gravel telegraphed the passage of another rider.
Keene's cigarette dropped to the ground and struck with a bright
bombing of sparks: he was wholly still, seizing every sound and
making the story. It was a heavy horse, a homesteader's plow horse.
He thought of Red John and this girl's pilgrimage to town, which
was common news by now, and he built his guess on the pattern of
that. "It will be Spackman," he said, "telling you he can't haul
your freight."</p>

<p>It was Spackman. The big Hollander drifted into the yard and
swayed on the broad back of his horse. He said: "Aurora, the wife
says I don't go. DePard sent that Red John around with threats. If
we help you it is to be trouble. I gave you my promise and I'll
keep it if you want. But maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Fritz," said Aurora, "I don't want you to get in
trouble."</p>

<p>"I have stood against DePard," said Spackman slowly. "I will
stand again. But the old woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fritz," said Keene, "would you lend me your team and
wagon?"</p>

<p>"That is not too much," said Spackman at once. "That I would
do."</p>

<p>"I'll be past your place in half an hour."</p>

<p>"So," said Spackman and went away.</p>

<p>Aurora said: "How did you know he would come and tell me
that?"</p>

<p>When he stepped forward she saw the old silent laughter in him,
the quick flare of pleased humor. Challenge had come out of the
night and he had seized it. This one thing she knew about
him&mdash;he never passed a challenge by. "Nothing," he said, "ever
changes much. I know this game. I guess it is all I do know. I'll
pick up Spackman's team and go on to Argonaut. Be back the third
day."</p>

<p>She went into the house and came out with Sullivan's money,
never thinking that she had met this man only the night before. It
was thoroughly natural for her to give him the money. "The
wholesale house in Argonaut," she said, "will know what I ought to
have." But even then she was thinking, not of the store, but of
him. "Why are you doing it, Jim? It would be so much better if you
just kept on riding."</p>

<p>"Same as Sullivan. One of those things."</p>

<p>She said: "I watched you stop DePard. I think you must have said
terrible things to him. He stood perfectly still when you rode
around him. Why quarrel with him when he has so much brutal
power?"</p>

<p>"The first thing to know," he told her, "is what kind of a man
you've got against you&mdash;if he bluffs, if he comes straight at
you or slides around the back side, if he's got a weak spot. That's
what I wanted to know."</p>

<p>"Be careful, won't you?"</p>

<p>"So long."</p>

<p>"So long, Jim," she murmured, and watched him step to his pony
and swing out of the yard. She listened to him cross the ford, she
heard the last sound die. Not until then did she realize how
completely she had come to depend on him. For now the silence
around her was think and strange and full of menace. She went into
the cabin, barring the door.</p>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>V. &mdash; FIRST BLOOD</h2>

<p class="first">CLEVE STEWART crossed the upper valley and came
upon the ascending grassy chute which was Broken Bit's front
entrance. At the head of the chute, in a bowl-shaped break of Lost
Man Ridge, DePard had his ranch. Pines surrounded it and the rough
foot slopes of Thunderhead Range touched the north edge of its
yard. From this hundred-foot elevation Cloud Valley was a long
amber plain upon which fall's haze beautifully lay.</p>

<p>Stewart found DePard on a top bar of a corral watching Blackie
Naves break a mustard-colored pony; and DePard, who never found
another man's work wholly satisfactory, shouted at Naves: "Don't
scar him up like that with your spurs! Dammit, I want a saleable
horse!" He saw Stewart and came off the corral bar. "Want me to
tell you something?" he said. "You ride too much. Who's doin' any
work when you leave your outfit? You're too easy and your crew
soldiers on you to beat hell."</p>

<p>Stewart flushed. He said: "I'll run my outfit," and showed
stubbornness in the long throw of his chin. "What are you doing
about that girl?"</p>

<p>"I told her to get off. She was a fool and threatened to
bushwhack me. We'll see&mdash;we'll see."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Stewart, "I don't want any rough stuff. I'll talk
to her."</p>

<p>"Talk to her then," said DePard. "It won't do you any good.
She's borrowed some courage from a man down there. From that
rider&mdash;that Keene."</p>

<p>"Let the girl alone."</p>

<p>"Cleve," observed DePard cynically, "you're soft. If that girl
stays there she'll draw other damned fools across the river, which
is the end of the valley for cattle. I won't have it. As soon as I
get Morspeare into office I'm going to scare hell out of those
nesters across the Silver Bow. I grazed there once and I'll graze
there again. You can't let 'em get thicker over there, for pretty
soon they'll stampede over here."</p>

<p>"Pretty tough," commented Stewart.</p>

<p>"Nesters?" said DePard. "Hell, they can't fight. Cut their wire
and throw a few bullets around the shanties at night and their
women will pack up. They'll pull out."</p>

<p>"Might run into a fighter," suggested Stewart.</p>

<p>DePard was thinking of Keene when he answered, "I'll take care
of that, too."</p>

<p>Stewart was troubled. Since he was a cattleman he understood
DePard's point of view. But the thought of crossing the Silver Bow
and driving out homesteaders was hard on his conscience. DePard saw
Stewart's moody hesitation, and assessed it with his sharp voice.
"You think you're an educated man, but if you ain't able to fight
for your rights what the hell's the good of an education? Those
homesteaders come in like grasshoppers. They don't say nothin';
they just chew the grass. Chew and ruin. They act humble but they
keep comin'. That's the way they fight. It ain't my way. I don't
give ground and don't draw the line on the way I fight. I'll do
whatever I got to do to keep what's mine. When I don't like a thing
I buck it and I bust it. I've always found a way and I always will.
That's why I'm big."</p>

<p>Stewart said: "There's more to the world than that."</p>

<p>"You tell me what," grunted DePard.</p>

<p>Stewart swung to his horse, thinking of one other thing. "And
keep that damned foreman of yours away from her. I'll kill him if
he tries his hands on her."</p>

<p>DePard studied Stewart with a half-contempt. "There you go,
askin' for help. Take care of your own private affairs. You always
struck me as a man a little too light on the power. Now here's
something you want and you tell me to keep Red away. Hell, man, you
keep him away yourself. It's your woman, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Stewart climbed from the horse with his solid fists doubled.
"Don't say that to me, Grat."</p>

<p>Grat DePard was unimpressed by the threat. He had formed his
judgment of Stewart long ago after a long period of sly observation
and he saw nothing now to change his belief that Stewart lacked the
killing instinct. Lacking it, he was not a man Grat DePard, who
bowed only to strength, could respect.</p>

<p>"All right," said DePard. "But you take care of Red yourself.
That's not my fight."</p>

<p>Stewart left Broken Bit and traveled steadily down the valley,
feeling the sting of Grat DePard's words. He was proud of his
education and his perceptions. It was his point of
arrogance&mdash;this believed superiority of intellect. What hurt
most now was to admit that Grat DePard, who had no standards, no
civilized qualities, no schooling of any sort, still could look
into him and read him. If Grat could do this, what judgments and
reservations did other men in the valley hold concerning him? Did
they see weakness in him? Was he what DePard had said, an impotent
man afraid to make up his mind, afraid to fight?</p>

<p>Behind that square face lay an extreme sensitiveness; the
toughness of the man was nothing but appearance&mdash;an accident
of bone growth. He had long suspected that about himself and now he
tortured himself with doubts of his own courage.</p>

<p>He arrived at the store yard to see Aurora come from the river
with a bucket of water. He said at once: "That's not the sort of
work you should be doing."</p>

<p>"What should I be doing, Cleve?"</p>

<p>"You should be married to a man who could do everything for you.
You shouldn't be here at all. On this desert alone. Exposed to the
tough men that ride by&mdash;open to the kind of gossip that people
make up about a single girl. You're too much of a woman. You make a
man feel strange. Just like passing a pot of gold and not being
able to take it. You can't possibly stay here. You can't buck
DePard. I can't stand thinking of the risk hanging over you. You
don't know the kind of a man you're up against. Come to my place,
Aurora. I've asked you that before. It's a damned big house and
you'd fill it out for a lonely man."</p>

<p>"Once," she told him, "I thought of that. The night before Dad
died I sat on the steps of the shack and wondered what I'd do. Then
I thought of you and I knew I'd be secure and that you'd always be
kind."</p>

<p>He was stirred tremendously. He said, so quick and so eager:
"Why not? Why not, Aurora?"</p>

<p>"Because I've got to make my own security. It means everything
to know I can do something without asking help."</p>

<p>He said: "If it is because you don't love me, that's all right.
I never asked that. I'd be glad to have what I'd get."</p>

<p>She spoke in complete candor. "It would be that way if I married
you, Cleve. A bargain between us, and no love. I don't trust love
very much. I know how it should be but I never really see it. Half
of the women in this world marry without it and some of the others
lie to themselves when they think they have it. I don't like that.
I'd rather not have any of it than to have a miserable little bit
to dole out here and there over a whole life."</p>

<p>"Why don't we make that bargain, Aurora?"</p>

<p>She smiled at him. She was hiding something from him in her
smile; there was a part of her he couldn't reach. "I've got to try
this first, Cleve. And then&mdash;" and she turned away so that he
couldn't catch her expression&mdash;"maybe that rare thing will
happen and I'll really be in love. If it doesn't I'll make a
bargain with you. I can't forever stay single and I can't always
wait for something that might never come."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I hate things halfway, Cleve. It has to be all of one thing or
all of another."</p>

<p>He turned to the thing worrying him. "You can't stay here."</p>

<p>She faced him with an expression half soft and half stubborn and
then he knew he couldn't reason with her. She had a fixity of
purpose which greatly puzzled him; it seemed to mean the whole
world to her. She was young and in her own fashion she had beauty.
Yet she held it back and would let no man have it. He said as much,
and got her answer. "If you had led my life, Cleve, you'd know why
I won't leave here. I've got to stay here. I will stay."</p>

<p>He remembered Keene and spoke in an altered voice: "Where's that
tall fellow&mdash;the rider? Did he go on?"</p>

<p>For a moment she seemed to be choosing her answer; he caught
that delay and was stabbed by the oldest of emotions. The fineness
went from the day and he felt his road blocked and he hated the man
who had blocked it. When she answered he recognized the caution in
her voice. "He's gone to town."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have him so near," he told her.</p>

<p>She discovered his feelings at a glance and murmured, "Why,
Cleve." He was angry. Blood crawled along the sides of his neck; he
tipped his hat and moved away at a fast gallop.</p>

<p>She stood idle in the yard, considering his jealousy; it was a
mirror in which she saw herself. She had a close, self-revealing
thought and pushed it hurriedly along because she didn't want to
let it say: "I think of him&mdash;of Jim&mdash;rather often." It
was disturbing to realize that she felt his presence in the yard;
he had left a good deal of himself behind. She recalled his smile
and tried to change her thoughts by saying aloud, "I should get
another bucket of water." But the image of Keene remained; it
penetrated her coolness and crossed the fence she had so definitely
built around her inner life.</p>

<p>She filled the water tub and chopped the wood in the yard; she
cleaned the cabin top and bottom. At night she stood in the yard's
shadows, listening to the drum of a rider somewhere on the flats.
Across the river a lantern swung down to the ford and presently
went away. Long after she had gone to bed a group of riders slashed
across the ford and circled by. One of them let out a yell.</p>

<p>Next morning she baked six loaves of bread instead of the two
which would have been enough for her own use. This, she realized,
was her tacit admission that she expected Keene to be around. Near
noon she saw a rider moving down the valley and presently
identified a woman on side-saddle. In a little while Portia Crews
ran her horse into the yard.</p>

<p>Aurora had met the girl a few times during the past year, with
always the inevitable homestead-cattle feeling between them; and it
surprised Aurora now to find Portia inclined to friendliness.
Portia dropped from the horse at Aurora's invitation and began the
talk with her customary energy. "I hear you plan to stick here.
News does get around. I'd wish you luck but that wouldn't do any
good. The truth is Grat DePard's a mean son-of-a-gun and your
coming here doesn't please him. Of course he'll run you out. That's
really what I wanted to tell you."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But he'll find a way. He's sly and he's brutal.
Remember Garratt?" Then she said: "By the way, where's that man who
was around here?"</p>

<p>"In town."</p>

<p>"I thought maybe he'd drifted," observed Portia. She maintained
a nonchalant attitude but her eyes briskly gathered whatever shreds
of reaction were to be seen on Aurora's face. Aurora realized that.
They were two women facing each other with their pleasant surfaces,
both fully aware of what the other thought.</p>

<p>Portia was a handsome girl, made spectacular by her swift energy
and her startling candor. At first her bluntness and the note of
her impetuous will over-shadowed her other gifts; but presently
when she fell into moments of silence Aurora caught the underlying
character of the girl&mdash;the hidden sweetness and, more clearly,
a certain wistful longing. In repose she had a beautiful face, wide
of lip, swift to respond to emotion in its every line. Her body was
firm and strong-outlined and would capture a man's attention at
once. Her hair, so yellow-gold, threw its warmth against her
eyes.</p>

<p>Aurora's fresh-baked bread lay cooling on a bench in front of
the cabin, its fragrance filling the yard. Portia wrinkled her nose
at it. "Makes me hungry."</p>

<p>"Like some?"</p>

<p>"No-o," said Portia, "but thanks." She counted the loaves
mentally and cast another glance at Aurora. "That will last one
person a long while."</p>

<p>"But not very long for two people," said Aurora. She knew that
question or that suspicion was already in Portia's thoughts
therefore she came out with the truth.</p>

<p>Portia abandoned whatever pretense of indifference she may have
had. She faced Aurora Brant directly. "You know it would be better
for him if he left here."</p>

<p>"I've told him that."</p>

<p>"But he wouldn't go," murmured Portia in half a question, half
an answer. "I knew that." She added a phrase that revealed her
completely to Aurora, not only in the words she used but in the
relieved and hopeful tone with which they were spoken. "I'm
glad."</p>

<p>She swung to the saddle, so obviously thinking of Keene; and
because her face was a sensitive mirror of her heart, Aurora
noticed the relief and the hope darken into distress. "But how can
he ever hope to fight DePard? You know that's coming, don't you?
You know DePard's only waiting to get that fool Morspeare into the
sheriff's office. It will be threats, then it will be burn and
kill. It will be anything he has to do. You know that?".</p>

<p>"Yes," said Aurora.</p>

<p>Portia shook her head, and rode away.</p>

<p>Keene drove Spackman's heavy-loaded wagon into the yard at dusk
that evening. He got down and stamped the stiffness out of his
legs, and stood before Aurora, the old soft smile on his face.
Habit made him reach for his cigarette papers; he held his head
down over the forming cigarette a long while. When he lifted his
glance she saw a strong feeling whip across his features and then
it was hard for her to say the casual "Hello" she had planned. The
two-day absence had done something. The truth was he had thought of
her during the trip and she had had him strongly in her mind. That
awareness of each other touched them with its restraint. She was
glad to have him back; he seemed to fall into a certain place in
her heart, to fill an emptiness.</p>

<p>She said: "Supper's ready."</p>

<p>"I'm ready to eat it."</p>

<p>He left the load of merchandise in Spackman's wagon overnight;
and therefore kept Spackman's team. Next morning he said: "Where'll
you put this stuff?"</p>

<p>"The cabin will have to be the store."</p>

<p>"You'll have a better store than that by noon," he told her and
rode away to the ridge. Presently he returned with two long slim
poles in tow.</p>

<p>She said: "What for, Jim?" but he only grinned at her. He
harnessed Spackman's team, hooked on the saplings to the doubletree
and drove over the ford. It was seven o'clock when he left. By nine
she had unloaded all the lighter boxes from the wagon and could do
no more. At ten Blackie Naves of Broken Bit crossed the ford,
coming from town, and circled the house. He stopped out on the
prairie a moment to observe the yard and the wagon in it, and then
ran up the valley. Near eleven she heard Keene at the ford and
walked from the house to meet him.</p>

<p>He had gone to her old tar-paper shanty, had slid the saplings
under it to provide runners; and here he was, hauling the shanty to
her.</p>

<p>She said, "I never thought of that!"</p>

<p>He was pleased by her astonishment. "You want a town, Aurora?
I'll drag it off the desert for you house by house."</p>

<p>He maneuvered the tar-paper shanty beside the log cabin, wall
touching wall, and unhitched Spackman's team. "During the week I'll
break down the horse shed and haul over the lumber," he told her
and fell to unloading the wagon. He had a casual, steady way of
working. Near noon he took back Spackman's team and wagon; when he
returned Aurora had dinner ready. Knowing his hunger, she had gone
into the store supplies to make a good meal.</p>

<p>"You want to be careful about eating up your groceries,
Aurora."</p>

<p>"I feed my men well."</p>

<p>That afternoon she cleaned out the transported shanty and helped
him carry in the supplies. In the twilight following supper he lay
full length in the yard, long silent and at ease. A rider circled
the house at a distance and Aurora, seated in the cooling darkness
near Keene, saw the glow of his cigarette fade as he listened to
that rider's passage of the river. In all things, she thought, he
was acutely attentive, taking in little rumors and stray shreds of
sign, and seeing stories before they happened. His life had
sharpened that gift. She knew nothing of that life, but its tumult
was part of his character, its close and hard risks were visible in
his talk, in his way of turning still, in every reaction.</p>

<p>His silence left her alone but because at this hour her doubts
always rose and made her small and lonesome, she wanted to creep
inside that silence and be sheltered by its comfort. It was hard to
be a woman alone, to hold herself always to the cold resolve of
self-sufficiency. There were moments when the real part of Aurora,
warm and needing warmth, passionately protested this rigid
suppression. And so she said:</p>

<p>"What do you think of, Jim?"</p>

<p>"We'll use those packing boxes to make shelves. Next time I'm in
town I'd better get some big pickle barrels to put at the side of
the store to hold a water supply in case of fire. I'll cut a door
through the cabin to connect with the store. Better get the horse
shed built next. It won't be long until the rain comes. Snow soon
after."</p>

<p>"Does this really interest you that much?"</p>

<p>He was flat on his back, long and boneless, soaking in the
night's comfort. He had the ability to seize whatever goodness the
current moment offered, to enjoy it before it vanished. "I never
helped build a town before," he said. "That's mighty odd, for me. I
like the idea."</p>

<p>"But when all this is over," she pointed out, "you'll tire of
it. The novelty will be gone. Then what is it for you?"</p>

<p>"More hills to cross. Big world."</p>

<p>The light of the cigarette sparkled against his eyes. He rose to
an elbow. His face showed its clear interest in her and for that
moment she was inside the circle of his thinking. He had one
quality that warned her&mdash;the ancient, foot-loose independence
of a man. If she ever permitted herself to like him too well she
knew she would be bound to his restlessness as she had been to her
father's errant impulses. Never again, she told herself, would she
play that part. Yet he was a man watching her out of man's eyes,
with a man's strong call; the smell of him was the smell of sweat
and tobacco and leather. These smells shot home.</p>

<p>She said: "Do you know what it is you really want?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Will you know it when it comes?"</p>

<p>He turned the question slowly in his mind, shaping the phrase
that would match his conviction. He made a motion with his arm.
"There'll be no doubt. It will be&mdash;" he paused to think of
it&mdash;"like the bolt of a gun sliding into the breech. Funny way
to put it. But when you hear that click, when you feel the bolt
close down, it's as close to a perfect fit, as near a perfect
answer, as there is." He sat up. "You happy here?"</p>

<p>"I never think too much about happiness. I want to be here. This
is something I must do. If I don't do it I'll never be able to look
myself in the face."</p>

<p>"Like Sullivan. He had to give you that money. Like me. I've got
to hunt. Even like DePard. He's got to obey what pushes him." He
squeezed the cigarette's brightness between his fingers. "Something
pushes everybody. Nobody knows what's really in the other fellow's
system. Now you were never meant to be what you're trying to
be."</p>

<p>"What am I&mdash;what am I trying to be?"</p>

<p>"You're trying to buck the world alone for some reason. But a
woman is fire and need, half-filled and wanting to be filled.
You're afraid of that and you make a battle out of it."</p>

<p>She rose, watching him lift himself from the ground. All along
the earth the crickets were filling this night with the bell-like
rasp of their intermittent singing. Fall's haze hung on, blending
the odors of fire and dry earth and the hinted smell of storm to
come. Somewhere a sound or a motion or a presence arrested him; he
turned his head.</p>

<p>She said: "There's no need to camp on the ground, Jim. Sleep in
the storehouse."</p>

<p>By the delay of his answer she guessed he had already considered
that. He turned his face to her. Between them, flung there by the
thoughts they both had, was again that man-and-woman awareness, and
its reserve. "No," he said. "It won't rain tonight."</p>

<p>Out of the darkness came the ropy, thinned echo of a distant
shot. She wasn't sure of its origin but Keene wheeled at once,
facing the river, and then he said more to himself than to her: "I
shouldn't have borrowed Spackman's wagon." He ran over the yard,
seized his saddle gear and hurried on to the pony picketed in the
grass; a moment later he had crossed the river.</p>

<p>As soon as he reached the flats, he turned south, guided on by
the outshine of Spackman's lights a mile away. A rider crossed that
beam of light, cutting a brief black nick in it; the rider raced by
at a distance. All Spackman's dogs were hallooing when Keene came
into the yard. He called his own name to protect himself, seeing
Spackman's oldest boy bracketed foolishly against the house light
with a gun in his hand. Mrs. Spackman was on her knees, half crying
and half comforting Spackman, who lay on his side and groaned his
misery. Settling beside Spackman, Keene saw something that cut him
to the very bone and afterwards poured a scalding anger through
him: Spackman's younger children stood hand to hand near their
father, silent and terrified.</p>

<p>Spackman breathed: "I won't die. Who's that, Mama? I can't
see."</p>

<p>Keene said: "Keene."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you dug Brant's grave. Well, you won't dig mine. I
will live to fight that man. It is my arm&mdash;that's all he
hit."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spackman cried: "You should not have lent those
horses."</p>

<p>"Which man?" asked Keene. "Which one came here?"</p>

<p>"All I saw was a shadow before he shot. It was a shadow like a
house."</p>

<p>"Morspeare," said Keene.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>VI. &mdash; THE DESIRES OF
WOMEN</h2>

<p class="first">BY the middle of the week Keene had finished his
soddy and lean-to. On Friday he disappeared across the ford and was
gone all day. That afternoon Sheriff Ben Borders stopped at the
store.</p>

<p>He was really an old man, but age had done nothing to his
spirit. He was stiff-backed on the saddle, his eyes had a biting
keenness; below a long sharp nose a mustache made its silvered,
drooping crescent, to give him an old frontiersman's perfect air.
His past reputation as a fighter protected him now. Seldom did he
use a gun. He displayed an old-fashioned gallantry in front of
Aurora, making a ceremony from the lift of his hat, and he had
age's one great gift, a thorough understanding of people and a
kindness toward them.</p>

<p>"You have been in the country more than six months, Aurora, and
you are eligible to vote next Wednesday. I think you ought to."</p>

<p>"I will. Is it going to be a close election?"</p>

<p>The question made him smile; for he had an old man's memory of
these elections, and a perfect knowledge of Grat DePard's methods.
"As to that I can't say. Where's that man? Keene, I mean."</p>

<p>"Out on the Silver Bow somewhere."</p>

<p>"Liked him," said the sheriff, and went away.</p>

<p>Cannon came into the yard just after dark. "Aurora, you got
kerosene?"</p>

<p>She brought him a can of kerosene, plugged the spout with a
potato, and took his money. This was her first sale. Cannon kept to
his horse. "This would be a mighty handy store for us, Aurora. But
I don't know. Risky to cross the river. You know what DePard's told
everybody. See what he did to Spackman. But it ain't a
homesteader's business to fight with guns. We got to be patient.
Someday we'll win. Don't forget to vote. Where's your man?"</p>

<p>"On the Silver Bow."</p>

<p>Cannon's voice held hope. "I hear he ain't afraid of DePard. You
think he can help any? That's the only way&mdash;some fellow that
can use a gun and ain't afraid. You won't find a homesteader like
that. None of them could use a gun against Red John."</p>

<p>When he left the yard Aurora remembered that he had said:
"Where's your man?" The Silver Bow people, never devious in their
thinking, had already put Keene and herself together. She had
supper long ready and now found herself waiting and at last
worrying. Why should this be? It was the way of a married
woman&mdash;this troubled fretfulness, this growing fear. When she
heard him come down the grade to the ford she turned into the cabin
to set on the supper again.</p>

<p>He had gone away on his saddle horse; he drove into the yard
with a pair of wild buckskins hitched to a wagon, his own horse
tied behind. He was in a fine temper, as he always was when
returning with something unexpected. He dropped from the wagon,
still holding the reins. The off buckskin struck out at him with an
unshod hoof and for a moment he fought this strange wagon team
around the yard; obviously he had fought them all across the
desert, for they were sweat from muzzle to tail.</p>

<p>"Found a bargain for hauling wood," he said, and had a bad
quarter hour getting them out of harness and on picket. "Mostly,"
he said, over the supper, "their feelings are hurt. This is the
first time they've been in harness." Later, lying in the yard with
his cigarette making its fragrance, he added: "You've got to have
wood banked around the store. I know what winter is like here.
There'll be days you won't be able to open your front door."</p>

<p>She said: "You want security for me, but none for yourself."</p>

<p>"Maybe," he told her, "I'm fixing things for you as I'd fix them
for myself&mdash;if I were staying in one place."</p>

<p>"And you never will?"</p>

<p>He thought about that a long while. "Probably never will. You've
got to vote next week, Aurora. It won't help much. Not much chance
of Borders being re-elected. The day Morspeare goes in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That bad, really?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>It took him an hour the following morning to harness and hitch
the buckskins to the wagon. For a while all she saw was Keene's
shadow weaving and ducking through the cloudy dust ripped up by the
violent horses. When he got them hitched he made one jump for the
wagon seat and was carried toward the ridge in a wild runaway. Near
the base of the ridge the exhausted team settled to a walk;
presently Keene vanished in the pines.</p>

<p>She saddled her own pony, carrying water from the ford to fill
the extra barrels he had brought. He was back with a load of wood
at noon, ate dinner, and returned to the ridge. Shortly thereafter
she saw a rider come down the valley at a steady gait and curve
over to the ridge, following Keene into the timber; it was Portia
Crews. Aurora stood at the cabin corner, watching Portia Crews go
into the pines, and as time passed and Portia didn't return a
strained, resentful emotion worked through Aurora.</p>

<p>Portia Crews sat on a log in the pine's shade, watching Keene
work. He was stripped to the waist. At each swing of the ax the
muscles of his back made a sharp V. She had thought him thin, which
was because of his height. But he had big shoulders and his arms
were solid, unlike those of most range men. "Funny to see a rider
do that kind of work. Jim, do you know DePard's left-handed?"</p>

<p>He quit his chopping and she observed how quickly he visualized
DePard. "No," he said, "he's right-handed."</p>

<p>"Ah," she murmured, "so you have been studying him. I wondered.
Let me tell you something. He's the bad one. He's killed at least
one man. Red John is tough, too. Then there's Blackie Naves. He's
treacherous. He's the one who'd get behind a tree, half a mile off,
and spot you with a rifle. Morspeare's very stupid, but cruel. But
don't you ever put your back to Grat. You can't tell about
him."</p>

<p>"All right," said Keene and turned to his chopping.</p>

<p>"You're foolish to come to this timber alone. And listen. If you
ever have to hide, go straight north on this ridge until you hit
the high hills. That's broken country, good to hide in. On your way
you'd pass my place." She dropped her voice. "You could always stop
there."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be on the other side of this scrap."</p>

<p>She sat on the log, straight-shouldered and firm of body; she
had a soft and open and pretty expression on her cheeks if he cared
to see it. Suddenly she spoke in a low voice. "Do you only look at
men?"</p>

<p>He swung back to her. "No," he said.</p>

<p>She held her hands quiet on her lap; she lifted her chin,
presenting herself squarely to him. She was alert to his
expression, anxious to know if she pleased him, ready to smile if
he wanted a smile and ready to rise and meet him halfway if he came
toward her. She had made up her mind about him. She had seen him
and within twenty-four hours she had wanted him. Having no
subterfuge in her, this was her way of going about it, She knew her
own gifts; she knew she could move a man without saying a word and
now she watched him to see what he had in his eyes.</p>

<p>The swinging of the ax in the timber's heat brought a heavy glow
of blood to his cheeks; sweat sparkled on his forehead. His glance
held her and she realized that, like any man the world over, the
suggestion of half a promise stirred him. There was nothing pale
about him; his appetites were sound, his urges very strong.
Presently she knew she had done what she wished to do. She had
penetrated his indifference. He was aware of her.</p>

<p>She got up from the log, her glance leaving him. For she caught
one more truth about Keene: he would not want her to be cheap.
Therefore, in the way of a woman, she retreated from her suggested
promise and became elusive. Looking swiftly at him, she smiled and
turned to her horse. "So long," she said, and rode northward
through the timber. It was four or five minutes later that his ax
resumed its long, smart ringing. That delay made her smile
sweetly.<br></p>
<br>

<p>The election was on a Wednesday. On Tuesday night the adjoining
neighbors met at Spackman's house&mdash;the Cannons, the Cobbs, the
Pattersons, the big Murchison family, Kilrain and his flame-haired
wife, and Comrie the Scotch bachelor. The younger children ran in
and out of the darkness, their feet scurrying furtively from shadow
to shadow, their voices crying and going mysteriously still and
suddenly crying again. The women sat in the house, steadily
talking. The men lounged in the yard, spoke quietly between long
pauses. Young Joe Spackman stood at the corner of the house, a dark
and hard-worked boy made alternately miserable and hopeful by
Jennie Cannon. She was near him. When he grew still she mocked him
with her eyes and lifted him out of his silence, but when he spoke
her attention went away from him and she seemed to listen into the
night. Young Joe, who was no fool, knew where her mind was at those
times. He said now: "Jennie&mdash;don't ever do that again."</p>

<p>"What, Joe?"</p>

<p>"You know what I'm talkin' about."</p>

<p>Spackman sat on a chair in the yard, nursing his bullet-torn
arm.</p>

<p>"Sam Venable said he heard this. Tomorrow when we go in to vote
DePard's goin' to send some men here to cut our fences and drive
our stock. That's what Venable heard."</p>

<p>"A threat to keep us home so we won't vote," murmured
Comrie.</p>

<p>"We got all day to vote," pointed out Spackman. "Half can go in
durin' the mornin' while the other half keep watch. Then switch
durin' the afternoon."</p>

<p>Cannon, an old man and a gentle one, murmured: "What good will
that do, Fritz? If they come to your place or mine&mdash;how could
we fight?"</p>

<p>"I would. I will."</p>

<p>"See what happened to you. We ain't made to fight with men that
use guns. If they come to tear out my fence what could I do? I'd
let them tear it. When they go I'd put it up again."</p>

<p>"And they'd tear it again," pointed out Spackman.</p>

<p>"Someday," said Cannon, "there'll be a lot of us here and Broken
Bit won't dare do things like that. It is a matter of patience.
Take the trouble that comes and wait for it to pass. I do not want
fighting. I do not want my children living in fear of bullets. I do
not want them to see death in my yard."</p>

<p>Comrie, who was a thoughtful Scotchman, added his word. "It will
not be a question waitin' till the Silver Bow is full of farmers.
Whut you think DePard's puttin' Morspeare into office for? He won't
let us wait. He's planning to drive us out."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Spackman. "And then, Cannon, is it fight or
go away?"</p>

<p>"It will not come to that," said Cannon, gently refusing to
believe. "DePard can't be that hard a man."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Spackman impatiently, "you should not trust like
that."</p>

<p>"It is not trust," said Cannon. "It is hope. We got to hope. We
can't do anything else."</p>

<p>"There's twenty or thirty of us on these flats," pointed out
Comrie. "We could take care of Broken Bit if we all got
together."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Cannon, agitated by the thought. "Don't consider
it. A man like Red John would slaughter us. Can you draw a gun
fast, Comrie? No. Can you fire from a horse and hit anything? No.
We have got to wait until we are strong enough to make them mind
the law. That will come."</p>

<p>Spackman moved in the chair but said nothing, for Cannon's views
were the views of a good many homesteaders. They were humble people
with families and they wouldn't hunt for trouble. In a little while
the group made its plans to go to town in relays; and the meeting
broke up.</p>

<p>The families went away, by team and afoot, the children
long-calling to each other through the heavy shadows and across the
increasing space; lanterns on the reach ends of the wagons scoured
yellow channels of brightness through the black.</p>

<p>Jennie, who had her own pony, followed her father's wagon. Young
Joe Spackman got his horse and rode with her. They let the wagon
draw ahead; they were alone in the felt-black night, with Jennie
laughing at young Joe's seriousness. "What's so sad? You're a funny
boy. You take on so."</p>

<p>"Keep with your own kind of people. Nothing good will come for
you&mdash;fooling around."</p>

<p>She said, cool and scornful: "Been spyin' on me?"</p>

<p>"I saw Red John ride away from you that night. Listen, Jennie,
he's no good."</p>

<p>"I don't believe all the stories I hear about him."</p>

<p>"You say that," he cried out, "about a Broken Bit fellow. The
same outfit that shot my dad."</p>

<p>"It wasn't Red John that did it. Remember what happened in town.
Red John didn't cause any trouble with your mother that night when
Morspeare wanted him to take her ax."</p>

<p>Young Joe knew this girl and the knowledge was tragedy to him.
"You don't mean anything by it, Jennie, but you're a flirt. That's
wrong. You'll get a name&mdash;and men will grin when they see
you."</p>

<p>She flung her anger at him. "Don't bother about me if you don't
want to."</p>

<p>"All right," he answered and stopped his horse.</p>

<p>Jennie Cannon immediately rode back to him. This boy loved her
and that was the sweetest thing she had in her life. In her graver
moments she knew she intended to marry him. He was right for her.
He would be a man like her father, kind and dependable and a
thrifty provider. But she was seventeen and wanted her moments of
foolishness, her time of being courted by men, of teasing them and
seeing them grow jealous of each other. She touched young Joe's
arm. "Joe, don't be angry. I'm not bad. A girl's got to have some
fun. After we get married&mdash;" and the coquette in her swiftly
added&mdash;"if we get married, that will be different. Then people
have to work and there's the children. You know that, don't you,
Joe?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't. It ain't right and I don't like
it."</p>

<p>"A man's always got to have his own way," she answered in a
sighing voice.</p>

<p>Usually he ended these meetings with a kiss. She waited for him
to take it, knowing it would dissolve his resentment and make him
awkward and eagerly anxious to set the marriage time. Then she
could tease him again. But he said "Good night" and rode away, and
she realized she had pushed him too far. She wheeled around and
followed in the wake of her father's wagon. She thought: "I'll see
him tomorrow and make it up." The wagon was far ahead and young Joe
had disappeared in the dark. She moved her weight on the saddle,
turning the horse toward the river bluff. Standing in her own yard
earlier during the afternoon she had seen Red John ride along the
edge of the bluff and look once in her direction; and that was a
signal. He would be there tonight.</p>

<p>She pretended it was the pony who wanted to go to the river, not
any desire of her own. The night was soft and warm and her heart
beat faster; the knowledge that Red John, who had known many women,
had singled her out for attention made a stinging sensation through
her body. These secret meetings and these covert signals were for
her, for Jennie Cannon, a little homestead girl who had long
dreamed of a tall dangerous man waiting for her in the
starlight.</p>

<p>He was there, waiting beside his horse. He was smoking a
cigarette and when she dismounted he dropped the cigarette and
ground it beneath his boot. She caught the smell of smoke on his
mouth. He touched her and she saw the strange sparkle of his eyes
and the frowning, excited look on his face. His arms were hard and
impatient as they pulled her against him.</p>

<p>Red John kissed her, feeling the stillness of her body, neither
protesting nor giving. He lifted his head to look at her, made
violent by the nearness of what he wanted. His voice was broken,
rough-edged. "Jennie, that's not the way to treat a man!" He kissed
her again and felt her indifference break. Her arms pulled at him
and her mouth had its own pressure.</p>

<p>He was inwardly laughing. She had been trying an experiment on
him, just holding away and figuring she could quit whenever she
wanted. Now she couldn't; and the rest of this affair was a dead
certainty. Women were all alike.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>VII. &mdash; "AND NOW IT
BEGINS"</h2>

<p class="first">KEENE and Aurora left the store during the middle
of Wednesday afternoon and reached Prairie near supper-time,
entering a street so jammed with wagons and rigs and saddle ponies
that they had to leave their horses in an alley behind the stable.
Reaching the walk, they were caught in the solid crowd, unable to
move faster than it moved; and at last they pushed their way across
the dusty street to the courthouse. This was like a Fourth of July
crowd, except that there was no lift and laughter in the people.
Keene, sensitive to his surroundings, felt fear and suppressed
excitement blow along the street like gusts of dry wind.</p>

<p>They entered the courthouse. Aurora took place in line before
the voting room while Keene rested himself against a wall, building
a smoke. Ben Borders was at the doorway of the voting room checking
from a list in his hand the eligibility of those passing into it.
Now and then he shook his head, sending a man out of line. Jesse
Morspeare stood beside Borders and watched the sheriff with a dull,
constant suspicion. Lifting his glance, he saw one homesteader he
knew.</p>

<p>"You get out of here. I saw you come to town last June."</p>

<p>Borders looked at the homesteader. "Charley Knorr," he said and
studied his list. "No, you're all right, Charley. Eight months
here."</p>

<p>Jesse Morspeare stared at Charley Knorr, his eyes showing the
hot brutality of his threat. It was Charley Knorr's turn to enter
the voting room but nobody pushed him; all these homesteaders knew
what was in Knorr's mind as he dropped his strained face from Jesse
Morspeare's glance. Ben Borders said at last: "Go on in and vote,
Charley."</p>

<p>Knorr shook his head. He lifted his eyes to show the surrounding
group the complete humiliation he felt; he stepped from the line,
leaving the courthouse with the slow, springless step of a man
whose pride had been destroyed. Jesse Morspeare grinned at Ben
Borders. Borders was angry. He said: "Cut that out, Jesse."</p>

<p>"Not doin' a thing," retorted Jesse. "Just standing
here&mdash;which is my right."</p>

<p>Aurora moved to the door. Morspeare said to her, "You sure you
want to vote?"</p>

<p>Keene strolled from the wall, at once becoming the target of
Jesse Morspeare's eyes. The big man, Keene noticed, showed an
off-guard uncertainty, a crafty change. He moved his hands slowly
down across his hips and held them motionless, trying to make out
Keene's intentions. Aurora had stepped into the voting room. Keene
removed the cigarette from his mouth; he held it between his
fingers and he let his fingers drop, the hot tip of the cigarette
falling against Morspeare's hand. Morspeare jerked away; he stepped
back. Keene laughed at him. He was close to Morspeare but he
stepped closer, and fresh blood turned his face ruddy. He had the
big man's mind dead-centered and unable to move; this was something
Morspeare couldn't grasp, this deliberate affront. Keene crowded
him suddenly. He stepped on Morspeare's foot and moved back,
circling Morspeare. He stopped; he threw the cigarette in
Morspeare's face and waited for the big man's answer. Morspeare
dodged with his head. The cigarette dropped against a fold of his
coat and the smell of the burning coat began to penetrate the hall.
Morspeare swept the cigarette away with his huge hand. He was
against the wall, hating Keene with his close-set eyes, frozen by
his uncertainty. Keene stepped slowly backward. The corner of his
eyes caught sight of a cuspidor; he reached down and caught the
cuspidor by its brass flange and threw it against Morspeare's
chest.</p>

<p>It caught Morspeare in the pit of the belly, doubling him over
and driving a great grunt out of him. The water of the cuspidor
dripped along his clothes; the sound of the cuspidor when it struck
the floor was metallic in the hall's complete stillness. Sweat lay
like oil on Morspeare's cheeks, the corners of his lips sagged and
cut two bitter curves against his skin. He was a great savage dog
straining against an invisible leash&mdash;the leash of something
he didn't understand and therefore feared. He moved his head gently
from side to side.</p>

<p>Keene nodded at the back door. The big man looked at the door
and snapped his attention back to Keene; in his slow, dim mind was
a beast's hatred, and a last surge of cunning. Keene took one more
step backward; he put his glance on Morspeare's belly and he drew
his right hand slowly upward until the elbow crooked. Morspeare let
out a sighing wind and turned to the rear door, dragging his feet
heavily on the boards. When he reached it he stepped through
rapidly. One sudden plunge carried him from sight.</p>

<p>Borders, standing witness to this scene, drew a hand across his
mustache. Keene grinned at him and the two men watched each other,
Borders at last nodding. A moment later Aurora came from the voting
room and Keene left the courthouse with her.</p>

<p>She didn't say anything until they got into the crowd. She held
to his arm, pulling him into the crowd's protection. Then she
spoke: "We must leave town right now."</p>

<p>"Supper first."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim! Don't you know what you've done?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said, and turned her to the hotel. "I got him out of
the courthouse so he wouldn't scare those folks." The strong flush
remained on his face and the pleasure was there&mdash;the same
hard-tempered amusement she had seen before. They moved through the
lobby and found a table in the dining room. She started to take a
chair facing the dining-room door but Keene's arm guided her to the
opposite chair. He took the one facing the door. She was upset
enough to be pale. "You quarreled with him&mdash;as you quarreled
with DePard."</p>

<p>"Sure," he said. He had never, in the time she had known him,
spoken a hurried or impolite word to her, but now she heard a
coolness that closed her out. He fought his battles alone and
wanted no advice. It hurt her to know it. He was a different man.
Behind that surface of amusement was the hardest kind of temper.
This was the kind of life he best knew.</p>

<p>She said: "All right, Jim."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "everything's all right," but he was far away
from her, seeing things at this moment she couldn't see.</p>

<p>"When will we know about the election?"</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. "They've started counting now."</p>

<p>The dining room was full. Twilight turned the windows gray and
the waitress went around the room, lighting the lamps. They were
half through supper when Cleve Stewart came to the table. He gave
Keene the briefest nod, his manner resenting Keene's presence.
Aurora said: "Sit down, Cleve." She had a swift moment's glance at
Jim Keene and saw the coolness on him.</p>

<p>Stewart took a chair, ignoring Keene. "Going back tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"My outfit will start home as soon as the election's known.
Better go with us."</p>

<p>"We're all right, Cleve."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't think you are. I don't presume to
interfere with your private affairs, Keene, but when you pick a
fight with Morspeare you get Aurora in trouble. Not thoughtful of
you."</p>

<p>Keene said: "Morspeare's your man. You cattlemen want him in
office. So why don't you trust him?"</p>

<p>Stewart reddened. "That's my affair."</p>

<p>"For a fact," drawled Keene. "But you opened the subject."</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart sat straight, openly angered. His bulldog face
fell into square lines; his pride was up. Everything about Keene
rankled with him. Keene was an outsider, an interloper who had
taken the wrong side. Clinging to all his prejudices, Stewart
showed his feelings openly. Keene, meanwhile, leaned back in the
chair, seemingly disinterested and detached. This was a surface
impression only; at the corners of his eyes Aurora noticed the iron
pressure of temper.</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart said: "It would be a damned sight better for
Aurora if you pulled out alone. You're the man DePard will shoot
at. Don't put your troubles on her."</p>

<p>Keene's answer drifted like a soft summer's wind. "You're
speakin' for DePard?"</p>

<p>Aurora broke in sharply. "Not at this table, please." She rose
and left the room. In the lobby&mdash;back in a quieter corner of
it&mdash;she waited for Keene to come up. "Let's stay until we know
who wins. I'll wait here."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll be back in a little while."</p>

<p>She watched Keene cross the lobby and push his way to the
street; a moment later Cleve Stewart came from the dining room,
walking rapidly. He was obviously angry clear down to the bone.</p>

<p>Keene moved by a group of homestead women standing before the
hotel and went across the dust toward Worsham's store. Half the
town had gathered in front of the courthouse, awaiting the election
returns. The Broken Bit outfit had collected near the Cattleman's
Palace. Red John leaned against the saloon wall, watching the
courthouse. The street now was shadow and lamp-light beneath a dark
sky and fall's wind came in to catch the agitated dust and carry it
onward in slow, thin waves; and in the wind was winter's first
chill. Keene was in the dark pool of Worsham's store and he paused
here, finding young Joe Spackman near him. Young Joe was rooted to
the walk, so intent on whatever he saw that he was unaware of
Keene's presence. At that moment Jennie Cannon came out of the
crowd near the courthouse and gave Red John one long look and
disappeared in the darkness beyond the stable. Red John had a
cigarette in his mouth; with a quick gesture he threw the cigarette
into the dust and walked past the stable.</p>

<p>Young Joe Spackman spoke a quick, groaning word and whirled on
his heels, crashing into Keene. He pushed himself blindly by Keene,
hurrying aimlessly down the street. Keene turned, idly walking
toward the depot; he was at the corner of the feed-store alley when
he heard somebody say "Keene," and turned to find Cleve Stewart
advancing at a swift walk.</p>

<p>Stewart came before him, clearly self-pushed to the edge of
trouble. Like the bulldog he so resembled, he had set his jaws, he
had closed his mind.</p>

<p>"I've got to question your attitude," he broke out. "You made
certain statements I had to ignore while Aurora was around. I'll
take you up on those right now."</p>

<p>Keene shrugged his shoulders. "You're tangled up in your own
harness, Cleve."</p>

<p>"What right have you got to camp around her place?" demanded
Stewart. "The fact is you've got no damned business there. It gives
her a bad name. It makes talk. Who knows anything about you? What
did you come here for anyhow?"</p>

<p>"My business," observed Keene. "Not yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;it's my business."</p>

<p>Keene's answer was dry as the windy-warm night air. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I've known that girl a long time. I feel responsible for her
safety. I don't propose to have a stranger come here and get her in
trouble."</p>

<p>"Then," asked Keene, "why don't you help her when she wants
help?"</p>

<p>"She shouldn't be across the river. You know damned well what
DePard's up to."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it?" asked Keene.</p>

<p>Stewart cried out: "Good God, don't you understand?"</p>

<p>Keene said: "You're straddling, Cleve. I'd guess you never had
much practice in taking the tough side. DePard's got you buffaloed
and you want to duck trouble by asking Aurora to pull out."</p>

<p>He was unprepared for Cleve Stewart's outraged reaction, not
knowing how accurately his words hit Cleve Stewart's tender spot.
Stewart, long uncertain of his own fighting ability and his own
toughness, felt blackness close down on him and knew that this was
the one moment of his life in which thinking would be fatal. He had
to know the quality of his courage, even though it killed him. His
jaws clapped together and he caught Keene on the side of the chin
with a roundhouse swing. Keene, only half braced for it, fell
backward into the alley; and rolled and was up. Stewart ran at him,
using his arms in the awkward manner of a man who had never learned
to fight.</p>

<p>Keene pulled aside. Stewart's rush carried him past Keene, who
caught him in the ribs and slammed him against the nearest building
wall. Beyond that thin partition some object crashed to the floor.
Stewart threw himself from the wall; in this blinding darkness,
Keene saw only the blur of the other man, only the swing of his
shoulders. He missed a punch and took one in the chest. He met
Stewart in the center of the alley, tied up his arms and jabbed him
in the belly, and threw him away. They circled slowly toward the
front of the alley, Stewart's wind sawing the silence. Somewhere
people were calling; that noise grew along the street. Stewart let
out a grunt, pushing himself at Keene again. They stood at arm's
breadth, slashing away, arm fouling arm. Keene caught Stewart's
next rush on the point of his shoulder. He rolled Stewart off his
shoulder, and struck him flush on the chin. Stewart fell like a
log. He groaned&mdash;and killed the groan as soon as he heard it.
They were clear of the alley, in the street again. Voices called
more clearly from the courthouse.</p>

<p>Keene said, between the lift and fall of wind: "Don't be a
damned fool, Cleve."</p>

<p>The crowd at the courthouse grew thicker and thicker. Talk rose
high and quarrelsome. Cleve Stewart pulled himself from the ground.
One ragged track of blood lay across his mouth and for a moment he
let his head drop, as though to throw himself again at Keene. But
this was curious: he lifted his head and all the gray, bitter
feeling passed out of him and he was laughing at Keene. It was a
relieved and free laughter scouring away malice.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "you licked me." And again he laughed. "I
should have learned how to do this a long time ago. This is the
first fight I ever had."</p>

<p>He walked forward, his hand extended, and when Keene took his
hand Stewart said, "Well, it was none of my business." He ran the
flat of a palm across his mouth, staring strangely at the blood
there. "I didn't feel you land that blow. Odd." He wanted to say
something to Keene, but he could not bring himself to admit the
depth of fear that had been in him&mdash;the fear of being afraid.
Nothing but the bitterest torture of soul had driven him to this
fight, nothing but the insufferable agony of a man who had to know
about himself at last. Now he was silently saying: "The worst of it
is thinking of it&mdash;afterwards there is nothing to be afraid
of," and a great load rolled off Cleve Stewart's heart and he was a
bigger man than he had ever been.</p>

<p>Keene put an arm on his shoulder, showing Stewart a penetrating
kindness. "Fine&mdash;fine," he murmured, and that was all they
ever said about it. Next moment both of them were turned by the
sound of a shot and the long cry of a voice, saying: "Broken Bit!"
The crowd fell apart, men running away from the courthouse. Women
screamed and raced for the shelter of the hotel. Keene and Stewart,
going up the street in long strides, heard another voice cry: "We
voted Borders in, by God!"</p>

<p>But the homesteaders kept racing down the street toward their
wagons and Broken Bit men were throwing themselves into this
stream, fighting toward the head of the street. Keene collided with
a homesteader, tripped and went flat down on the dust. Cleve
Stewart was by him shouting: "Trouble up there, Jim!" and gave
Keene a hand up, both of them plowing forward. Another woman
screamed, so near to Keene that his ears rang. Dust thickened.
Through this dust he had one incomplete glimpse of Ben Borders
standing on the courthouse steps&mdash;tall and lonely and
motionless. He saw Borders reach for his gun. That was all he saw,
for a wagon and team, swinging down the street at a dangerous run,
cut off Keene's vision and made him jump aside; and afterwards the
dust shut out everything. Shots beat along the street, those echoes
rattling against Prairie's loose windows. A man shouted loud and
long and more homesteaders were racing out of town, wagons wheel to
wheel. One voice kept shouting: "Broken Bit!"</p>

<p>Keene hugged the wall of Worsham's store, pushing forward with
Cleve Stewart beside him. Tim Sullivan showed up in the dusty,
lurid night; his mouth was wide open and a cigar fell out of it.
"They shot Ben!" Suddenly Broken Bit was in the saddle, out in the
street's middle, and Keene saw DePard wave his arm at his crew.
Broken Bit swung through the mass of wagons and rigs. Red John was
tall and saturnine in the middle and faintly amused. Blackie Naves
turned and shot point-black at the head of the street and Red John
bent in the saddle and knocked up Naves's arm. Jesse Morspeare
cursed at the crowd as he rode, sullen and full of hatred at his
defeat. He charged against a wagon and reached out, pulling a
homesteader from the wagon's seat. The homesteader fell deep in the
tangle, his yell coming wildly up through the dust and the churn of
horses; and presently Broken Bit was gone and to Prairie City, now
half emptied of its crowd, came a semblance of order. Through the
lessening noise Keene heard a small boy's voice crying out
forlornly: "Where's my mother?"</p>

<p>Keene ran on toward the courthouse and the group already
gathered there. He saw Ben Borders half sitting and half lying on
the steps and for an instant he thought the old man merely tired;
but as he came up he noticed the stain on Borders' vest. Tim
Sullivan pushed the crowd aside and caught Borders at the
shoulders, holding him straight. Tim called: "Ellenburg!"</p>

<p>"Tim," said Borders, "I'm a little thirsty."</p>

<p>"Who did it?"</p>

<p>"A short drink of water," said Borders in a voice that was small
and gentle and perfectly unafraid. "Be mighty dry where I'm
going."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" repeated Tim Sullivan.</p>

<p>Borders saw Keene. He raised the back of a hand and brushed it
across his mustache, looking closely at Keene. There was a
freshening of interest in his eyes. "You're still here?" he
murmured. "And stayin'?"</p>

<p>"I'll be staying."</p>

<p>"Pleases me to know it," said the sheriff. His words were fading
and he spoke with a conscious preciseness. "I want to tell you
something. I followed the trail for many years. When you get to the
other side of the hill&mdash;remember this, son&mdash;the only
thing you'll find there is just what you brought with you."</p>

<p>He bowed his head and seemed to be thinking deeply. Sullivan
said, "The old man's dead," and sat down on the steps and held the
sheriff.</p>

<p>Somebody behind Keene spoke. "Now where's the law on the Silver
Bow?"</p>

<p>Turning, Keene saw Cannon and a small group of homesteaders.
Aurora stood in the shadows. Ellenburg came up the street.</p>

<p>"Why," said Tim Sullivan, "there ain't any. If you want any law,
friend, you'll have to make it."</p>

<p>Cannon said sadly: "That's the end of us homesteaders."</p>

<p>Keene swung away. Aurora said: "If you're ready&mdash;" and they
walked through the alley to their horses. When they came out they
found Cleve Stewart and half a dozen of his riders waiting; the
whole group left Prairie at once.</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart said: "I'm sorry you had to see that, Aurora. If
you're upset, come on to my place."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I'll stay."</p>

<p>Very little was said during the rest of the ride. Crossing the
ford, Cleve Stewart broke a long silence. "DePard didn't think he'd
lose. None of us did. The killing, of course, was not
accidental."</p>

<p>Keene said: "Who did it?"</p>

<p>"Naves."</p>

<p>"You're sure?"</p>

<p>"Tim Sullivan told me. He saw the shooting." They had stopped at
the edges of the yard. Cleve moved his horse in until he had a
better view of Keene in the dark. He spoke in a troubled tone. "He
was a fine old man&mdash;Borders. But if I were you, Jim, I
wouldn't entertain any notions regarding Naves. You saw how that
outfit works. The lid's off now."</p>

<p>Keene's mind still ran close to the shooting. "Naves&mdash;the
little one," he mused.</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart looked into the future and had his dark visions
and spoke earnestly to Aurora. "Aurora, I hate to harp on this but
do you think you ought to stay here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Cleve."</p>

<p>"Well," said Cleve, "good luck," and rode away with his
outfit.</p>

<p>Keene and Aurora rode into the yard and for a little while
remained mounted, listening to the steady ringing rasp of the
crickets through the silence. Keene rolled a cigarette and lifted
it to his mouth and drew out a match. But, watching him closely,
Aurora noticed the old, swift caution come to him. There was no
warning in the night for her, but for him something happened. He
held the match unlighted and his head turned, and then he moved his
horse toward the lean-to-stable beyond the cabin. He stopped and
she saw him bend forward and presently urge the horse closer to the
stable. After that he rode back to Aurora. He lighted the match and
cupped it against the cigarette. That glow etched out the bony
squareness of his face and the hardening length of his mouth. The
light died. Keene said:</p>

<p>"My team's gone."</p>

<p>She felt the quick thrill of fear for she knew, as well as he
did, what had happened to those horses. She didn't need to ask.
Somehow in the last week's time she had become aware of the dark
and wild and treacherous undercurrents of this land. Somehow she
had absorbed Keene's point of view. One thing she never forgot: his
voice at that moment, its brevity, its softness, its finality.</p>

<p>"And now it begins, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You'll be going after them?"</p>

<p>"In the morning."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE LIGHT DIES</h2>

<p class="first">HE stood in the yard after breakfast saddled and
ready to go, and as he smoked out his morning cigarette he looked
along the sweep of the valley, across its amber sunless grass to
the clear-black barrier of Lost Man Ridge in the east. Earlier he
had scouted the immediate flats, to find the print of pony tracks
leading straight at the ridge. He was always a man to have his cool
look at the future, Aurora thought. His mind was going on ahead,
visualizing how it would be. The pressure of it, and the cool
expectancy of it, was on his face.</p>

<p>He swung to the saddle and for a moment his eyes admired her.
She showed no fear and she said none of those things that disturbed
a man or tried to take him away from the things that had to be
done. She had will, she had composure. As she lifted her head to
him he saw one quality appear which he had not before seen&mdash;a
kind of iron resolution which suppressed emotion. He said: "I may
be gone a few days."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Remember what I told you about using that gun."</p>

<p>She said: "Do you really have to do this, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good luck," she murmured.</p>

<p>There was nothing hard about the trail before him; it led at the
ridge in a straight pattern of trampled grass, reached the trees
and stamped itself plainly on the dark forest mold. The horse
thieves had neither concealed nor wanted to conceal it. They were
saying to him, every foot of the way: "This is the way your horses
went. Come and find them."</p>

<p>Before he entered the timber he looked back. The store cabin was
a dark square against the sun-yellow grass; his own soddy squatted
under day's new, strong light; the river made its sparkling bend at
the ford. Aurora stood in the yard; he saw her arm lift at him and
he answered it and pushed into the timber.</p>

<p>The twilight of the ridge and the coolness of the trapped night
air came upon him; the hoofs of his horse sank without sound into
the soft mold. One main trail ran northward, veering with the ridge
crest and slowly lifting as the elevation of the ridge grew higher.
Fifteen miles northward the ridge joined Thunderhead Range. Near
that junction Broken Bit had its headquarters.</p>

<p>He had no doubt of his destination. Broken Bit had taken the
horses, therefore to Broken Bit he was bound. As he traveled onward
at no great haste&mdash;and watching all the oncoming alleys of the
timber&mdash;it occurred to him that this trail was the pattern of
his life, leading out of lowlands and sunlight into twisted trails,
through shadows in which the old scent of wilderness forever lay.
He had no illusions about himself. He was glad to be riding, the
expectation of trouble was a flame that warmed him&mdash;and every
old incident of his career now repeated itself. Each man had a life
to lead, each man had to play out one part faithfully: this was his
part, beyond his power to change or modify.</p>

<p>He was in no hurry and had covered less than ten miles by noon.
He came upon a fork of the valleys creek and stopped for a drink.
Coolness had some from the timber: now and then through tree gaps
he saw the bright sun shining. Shortly after noon he pushed on,
coming to a fork of the trail. The main trail continued north along
the spine of Lost Man containing the print of the horses; a lesser
trail curled downgrade toward the east.</p>

<p>They had drawn a line fifteen miles long for him to follow and
every foot of the way was an invitation. DePard, he thought, was a
clever man, for DePard knew he would take up the invitation. Keene
smiled at the thought; the old eagerness buoyed him. But at this
point he abandoned the direct trail and swung to the left,
descending the flank of the hill a mile or more; after that he left
the narrow pathway and took to the pines, Ahead of him a bay of
brightness showed. Reaching the edge of timber, he looked upon a
half-overgrown meadow and the slattern shapes of an abandoned house
and barn. Beyond this meadow was a narrow screen of trees; beyond
the trees he saw a small shallow valley&mdash;with broken country
to its east.</p>

<p>He skirted the meadow and turned back toward the crest of Lost
Man. A buck mule deer stood up suddenly from the brush and looked
at him with a frozen, round-eyed interest and ran away in skimming
bounds, leaving the softest of sounds behind. He had not realized
until then how close and tight were his nerves. They recoiled, they
built tensions in his body. Deep in the lucent eyes of the deer had
been the everlasting wildness, the never-ending vigil of nature; in
the velvet quiet of these hills a steady danger rubbed against
him.</p>

<p>He came to the ridge crest, found the sign of the horses on it
again, and quickly retreated into the timber. Through a vista of
trees later he saw ranch quarters lying below him near the edge of
Cloud Valley; this would be Portia Crews's home. The outer day was
still bright but in these woods twilight settled to its first
violet shades. He reached an east-west road, scouted it and crossed
it. Here the main mass of the Thunderhead Range met him and he rose
through denser timber and more rugged contours; high on the
mountainside, near four o'clock, he came out to a ledge and
discovered DePard's ranch below him.</p>

<p>He had circled the ranch. Now from this elevation the country
unrolled before him like a map. DePard's long low house and the
scatter of outbuildings and corrals lay without pattern at the head
of a chute which dropped into Cloud Valley. Timber pressed against
the ranch on three sides. The east-west road he had recently
crossed came over the ridge and entered the yard; and on that
road&mdash;a few miles east of the ranch&mdash;a file of cattle
moved toward the ranch, driven by three riders. He spotted the
Crews house sitting in its hidden pocket north of Broken Bit. From
this high spot Keene saw Lost Man Ridge as a dark finger pointing
at the distant Silver Bow.</p>

<p>East of the ridge lay a country broken by a hundred short
ravines and pockets&mdash;a silent and empty and mysterious land,
the very sight of which made its imperious demands on his
imagination; and such was his incurable love of wild places that he
would have turned at once, answering the summons of that broken
country, had he been free. He counted five men in the yard below
him and through the time space of a cigarette he watched Broken
Bit, every detail of the yard biting into his mind&mdash;the
arrangement of the house doors, the runway between the corrals, the
closeness of the pines to the big barn. When he turned down the
slope, temporarily within the shelter of the timbered hills, he had
put the men of the yard in their exact places and he had estimated
it would be another hour before the riders on the east-west road
reached the ranch.</p>

<p>The trail dropped in quick switchback loops. Above him the sky
made its spectacular evening shift from bright gold to the sunless
clarity of evening; and so quiet was the world that the sound of a
man's voice in the yard below him, still a quarter mile away, ran
up the slope in magnified resonance. When he came off the last turn
of the trail he faced the back side of the main house and the blank
end of a bunkhouse. A man sat at the base of a corral, hat low on
his face. It was the same man, Keene realized, he had thrown at Red
John in town.</p>

<p>He lifted his head as Keene entered the yard, and dropped it
again; and it was a long moment&mdash;Keene watching him with an
undivided interest&mdash;before the delayed impact of Keene's
presence lifted his head. He was in his thirties, with a face
prematurely old and dried-out and sharp-stitched with its line of
hard living; he was a passive presence in the dust. Looking down at
him, Keene saw the narrowed slot of his eyes. In them was the gray
intentness of a man sighting along a gun barrel and waiting the
proper moment of discharge. Behind the corral bars were Keene's two
buckskin ponies. Keene passed on, cut around the corner of the
house and found DePard on the porch.</p>

<p>DePard said: "Took you all day to get here, friend. What you
been doing since six o'clock this morning?"</p>

<p>He sat in a rocking chair, his two heavy hands idly dropped on
the rocker arms; he had been teetering gently, and now was still.
On the surface of his wide and fleshy neck the pulse of his heart
broke heavy and slow. He wasn't surprised. He had known Keene would
come and on his face was the gray satisfaction of guessing right.
"Naves is out there on the main trail, expectin' you."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be that much of a sucker," drawled Keene.</p>

<p>"No," said DePard, "you wouldn't. But Naves don't rate you as
smart as I do." He came as near laughter as his nature permitted.
Somewhere in this unscrupulous and powerful man a pleased foresight
stirred. "Men are no brighter than they ought to be, friend. Or if
they're bright they've got no guts. Those with guts are almost
always damned fools, like Morspeare. I don't often see a smart man
who ain't afraid. When I see him I admire him. I get lonely
sometimes for a talk with my own kind. Glad you're here. Step
down."</p>

<p>"You're wrong," said Keene. "I'm not your kind."</p>

<p>"In that one respect," answered DePard, "you fool yourself. You
have got a kink, which I have observed. What did you come here
for?"</p>

<p>"Horses."</p>

<p>"You never would have lost any horses if you had minded your own
business. You was just ridin' through. Then you saw a lively game
and dealt yourself in." He put his hands on his solid knees,
leaning forward in the chair. "What'd you do that for, friend?"</p>

<p>"The game," said Keene, "needed a little fresh blood."</p>

<p>"The ridin' got dull and you wanted action," DePard pointed out.
"So you stopped here. But you got a kink, so you had to make out
some sort of a story to please yourself. You made out that these
people were gettin' the worst of it and needed help. The real
reason was you had a bellyful of bein' good."</p>

<p>The man with the burnt, expressionless face stumbled around the
corner of the house, took one brief look at Keene, and moved back
to the corral; when he sat down it was at a position which kept
Keene before him. DePard said: "It's all right, Snap." Two other
men moved from the barn and paused. Elsewhere in this yard the
fourth and fifth hands were hidden; he had counted them from the
hill.</p>

<p>"You're foolin' yourself," said DePard. "I never do. I know what
I'm after. I go for it and I get it. I never had a bad night's
sleep over anything I ever did and I never will. I take what I'm
big enough to get. Let the other fellow cry, if he ain't heavy
enough to stop me from gettin' it. Now, friend, you're a quick man
with a gun and you didn't learn that shootin' the tops off daisies.
When you want a little hell you stop and have it and you don't care
who foots the bill. What's the difference between us?"</p>

<p>The pattern of this yard was in Keene's head; the old coolness
moved in him, the old temper sang through him like wind. The man at
the foot of the corral had dropped his hat over his head but Keene
saw the basilisk gray of his eyes underneath the brim; he noted the
two men near the barn. He said gently: "As for the horses,
Grat&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grat DePard's answer was amused, it was completely confident.
"You ain't answerin', friend. What's a homesteader to you? Nothin'.
I know you like a book. You ride high until you see a man that
casts a big shadow. And then like every tough one in the world you
stop to see if that fellow is as big as you. I'm that fellow,
friend, and that's what's in your craw now."</p>

<p>Back of the house a door banged, its sharp clap running sheer
and flat across the yard. A triangle began to beat steadily,
ringing like a great bell, the echoes rolling on and on through the
hills. Twilight moved through the yard, wave after wave. DePard
stood up.</p>

<p>"I'm as tough as you," he repeated, "and you're as tough as me.
Which makes it kind of interestin'. Light and eat, friend."</p>

<p>Keene had DePard centered before him; he could take his chances
with the three men visible in the yard. But somewhere, like a
breath of air on the back of his neck, was the threat of the other
men he had seen from the heights. This was the thing that held him.
He stepped from the saddle and went into the house. He followed
DePard to a mess hall, took one swift look around him, and moved to
the chair at the foot of the table. One by one the other men walked
in. He counted them in his head, waiting until all five should have
arrived; that was the moment he had chosen&mdash;when all five were
together in front of him. But one man never came and he saw
DePard's heavy lips creased in half-suppressed amusement. DePard
knew what he was thinking. Keene sat back, the drive leaving his
muscles. Nothing showed on his face.</p>

<p>A rider came out of the hill trail, whirled before the house,
and stamped through it; at the doorway of the dining room he
stopped as though a stretched wire had caught him across the chest.
This was Naves, shocked still; his little eyes raced from Keene to
DePard in swift search.</p>

<p>DePard said: "I said you'd be wrong, Blackie."</p>

<p>There was an empty chair on the far side of the table. The
little man moved on, intending to pass Keene's back. Keene looked
at him; he had a coffee cup in his hand and he held it half lifted,
looking over its brim. Naves flashed one more glance at DePard and
turned toward the opposite end of the table. He sat down, saying
nothing, and, as the rest of them did, ate his meal in hurried
silence.</p>

<p>There was one more man in the yard. That man clung to Keene's
mind; it was a weight that tipped the scales gently down, against
action. He watched the group finish eating&mdash;and the urge to
make a play crept into his muscles and turned to a half-formed
impulse. But he sat still. That coolness still was on the back of
his neck. He relaxed on the chair, heavy and inexpressive, watching
the crew go out. DePard remained. DePard rolled a cigarette, his
stout, stubby fingers turning and tapering the paper.</p>

<p>"You threw the hook into me the other day," said DePard. "I
ought to be tough about that. But I ain't. When I meet a man of
your kind I'd like to have him with me. That's why I took your
horses, friend. I wanted to talk. There's a job here for you."</p>

<p>"No," said Keene. "I guess not."</p>

<p>"Friend," pointed out DePard, "you could raise a lot of hell. If
I didn't think so I wouldn't be foolin' with you. There ain't room
for the both of us in the country. Either you ride right on out of
here, or you take this job."</p>

<p>Keene said: "Quit singing that same old tune. Grat."</p>

<p>DePard stared at him through the rolling smoke of his cigarette.
DePard's skin cast a mahogany shine back against the lamplight;
close wrinkles fanned out at the base of his temples. He propped an
elbow on the table and sank low in his chair, animal keen in the
things he knew. There was a chestiness to him, a broad flare to his
nostrils, a stallion's boldness to his eyes. Slouched in the chair,
he showed power and an insensitive vitality.</p>

<p>"I admire you," he repeated. "I could trust you as much as any
man, which is not much. You got the same ideas I've got, which is
to take what you want and do what you want to do and to hell with
what the other fellow says. This is my country. I run it. All that
talk about law and rights&mdash;what good's that if they can't make
it stick?"</p>

<p>"When you trouble those people across the Silver Bow you're
overplayin' your hand."</p>

<p>"Little fellows," said DePard. "They hide in the grass like
crickets and you don't see them until they cover the country. Then
they eat you up. They're going out of here, friend."</p>

<p>"You'll lose."</p>

<p>"Me?" said DePard, really surprised. "Oh, no. They'll run." He
came heavily back to his main subject. "I like smart men. Don't
disappoint me, friend. Don't do something that ain't smart. Hell,
here's a whole thousand square miles for you. Go out there and take
your piece of it. I'll stand you some cows to start on."</p>

<p>Keene gave the thought a long consideration. It engrossed him,
it took his fancy. But he smiled and shook his head. "What would I
want with that?"</p>

<p>DePard displayed his first sign of puzzlement. The hearts of
men, according to his philosophy, answered to fear and to profit.
These were the major compulsions. He had tried them both on Keene,
but this man laughed at him. He was less sure of Keene; he was
curious. "What do you want, friend?"</p>

<p>"As to that," answered Keene, "I do not know."</p>

<p>"Don't spend your time lookin' for nothin'. If it ain't
something you can see or smell or bite between your teeth,&mdash;"
he stretched out a solid arm and closed his fingers
slowly,&mdash;"if it ain't somethin' you can get between your
fingers, it ain't nothin'."</p>

<p>"I knew a man once, down the trail," observed Keene. "He owned
the town. He walked down the middle of the street and folks stepped
aside. He rode high and he cast a pretty big shadow. One day a
little fellow&mdash;just a little fellow scared of his own
skin&mdash;walked up to him and said, 'Hello, Bill,' and shot him
dead."</p>

<p>"Bill," pointed out Grat, "was a fool for bein' careless." Then
he asked in a quick way: "What happened to the other fellow?"</p>

<p>"One of Bill's friends killed him."</p>

<p>"You see?" pointed out Grat DePard, and blew a long breath
through his nostrils. "The little fellow was a fool, too. He's
dead. What good did it do him?"</p>

<p>"Something you don't see and can't bite. You could reach for it
forever and never get it in your hand. How about those horses,
Grat?"</p>

<p>DePard stood up. "Naves was right. You're not as smart as I
figured. Your pony's out there where you left it."</p>

<p>The cook moved around the kitchen. That, Keene decided, was the
extra man he'd been worrying about. Evening's silence hovered over
the ranch, the silence of waiting, the silence of preparation. One
thing alone broke it&mdash;the cry of a coyote somewhere in the
hills. Keene looked down at the table, no longer needing to watch
DePard, for he had already seen the involuntary breakthrough of the
man's purpose. He had observed it before in other men, that dark
emanation which no pair of eyes and no face could ever conceal.
They would let him rise to the saddle; they would never let him
ride from the yard.</p>

<p>He said: "Thanks for the meal. You've got a good cook."</p>

<p>"Chinaman."</p>

<p>Keene thought. The extra man was a Chinaman. No danger in him.
The kitchen was a way of exit, but it left him without his horse.
He moved along the table; he stopped near the doorway which led
into the front room. The front room was still unlighted and the
mess-hall lamp thrust one bright yellow corridor straight across
the living room to the front doorway. To either side of this
corridor shadows clung. He fished out his cigarette papers and
shook up a smoke. He tapered it, he lighted it and pulled his lips
back from his teeth, relishing that first fragrant draw of smoke.
Grat DePard stood at the doorway, his faithless, animal-alert mind
anticipating every possible play in Keene's head. Knowing his man,
Keene started for the doorway. It surprised him when DePard stepped
into the living room ahead of him.</p>

<p>Keene said: "Just stop there&mdash;and keep your voice
down."</p>

<p>DePard's confident answer came back at him. "You damned fool,
you're as good as a mile from that horse. Put up the gun."</p>

<p>"Slide your hands into your pockets. We'll walk to the porch.
We'll stop a minute. We'll move out to the horse and just walk
along."</p>

<p>"And you showin' a gun in your hand, friend?"</p>

<p>"It's still in the holster. Go ahead."</p>

<p>DePard was close to open laughter. "Now you'll see why I like
smart men. See how far Blackie Naves lets you walk."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>DePard stepped to the porch, with Keene behind him. Keene said:
"How far over this ridge to the river, Grat?" In the stillness he
heard his own voice carry&mdash;and wanted it to carry.</p>

<p>DePard made a half-turn to him. "Nineteen miles."</p>

<p>Keene slid a match along his leg, lighting it. He brought it to
his face, holding it steadily against the cigarette. The light
reached out to DePard and caught the round, wide-open surfaces of
the Broken Bit owner's eyes. Keene watched the dark pupils grow
small against the light; he saw the flame of the light dance as
tiny pictures in those pupils. The match died and he heard DePard's
short strong sigh of growing strain. That same strain made hollow
places inside Keene; it dried him up and made all his nerves too
sharp, it stung like sweat on his face. Water fell into a near-by
trough. The smell of the hills moved steadily down the narrow
canyon meadow and the weight of the hills pressed against the
meadow. He noticed one shadow erect against the corral.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, and moved toward the head of his horse. DePard
dropped down the steps, in front of him. Keene caught up the reins.
He had the horse on his left, he had DePard close to his right.
Then he said: "Let's call Naves over."</p>

<p>DePard set himself. He meant to resist. Keene pushed a shoulder
point gently against DePard and held it there; he felt the steady
strike of DePard's heart.</p>

<p>"Blackie," said DePard.</p>

<p>Keene said: "Walk on a piece and I'll tell you about this." He
stepped ahead, DePard's feet keeping time. Keene, looking into the
shadows, saw only that one still shape against the corral wall. He
heard the scull of boots elsewhere to his left. There was also a
man, he presently discovered, hard by the barn. And Naves called
out: "What's up?" He was opposite the house, near the pines; and
now his boots had quit moving. DePard's head turned and Keene saw
satisfaction tighten his mouth. Keene pulled his horse around,
aiming between house and corral, thus putting Naves behind him. He
passed the silent shape at the corral. He reached the kitchen door,
he aimed at the hill trail out of which he had come.</p>

<p>Naves' voice rose again, thin with suspicion. "What's up?" His
boots struck the yard, now at a steady run. Keene slapped his hand
down against the butt of DePard's gun and seized it. DePard moved
against him, hands still in his pocket; he felt DePard's muscles
tighten. He lifted the gun from DePard's holster, murmuring:
"Better take care of that fellow."</p>

<p>"Blackie," called DePard, "what the hell you doin'?"</p>

<p>Naves's boots went scuffing around the far side of the corral;
he was circling it to reach the mouth of the hill trail in advance
of Keene. DePard yelled "Blackie!" and threw all his weight against
Keene. His hands came out of his pockets. Turning, he drove his
knee at Keene's stomach. Keene stepped back and, with DePard's head
a growing shadow in front of him, brought the barrel of the
revolver hard down.</p>

<p>DePard dropped. Another crying voice pursued Keene.
"Grat&mdash;that you?" Keene ducked under the head of his horse and
let go of the reins, running at the corral. He threw a shot back of
him and left the corral's protection. The dark mouth of the trail
was fifty feet in front and as he ran he saw a little shape
suddenly wheel before him and crouch like a cat. Naves had beat him
to the mouth of the trail. He jumped aside, the flash and roar of
the little man's gun in his face. He threw his shot and heard it
tear through that little man; he watched Naves wind half around and
drop.</p>

<p>He was in the trail, with the lead of other Broken Bit men
whipping the earth at his feet and singing against the trees. The
sound of that firing was odd and hollow and increasing. He turned
about, sheltered by the trees but still in the trail, catching the
steady flash of a gun near the corral. But the hollow sound grew
until he knew it was not in the yard. Swinging, he saw blackness
rush at him and rear high above him and one stunning, crashing
force came down on him and the roar of a great waterfall swelled
through his head.</p>

<p>He was down in the dust, bitterly grasping the tail end of
consciousness, rolling beneath the feet of horses. One sharp hoof
struck him in the head and light burst like an explosion in his
brain: and his last thought, struggling with strangled effort
through the smell of dust and of his own blood and the knife stab
of pain, was a cold conviction of death: and then all light faded
and he dropped into a bottomless black.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>IX. &mdash; "YOU ARE NOT
COLD"</h2>

<p class="first">DURING the latter part of that afternoon Cleve
Stewart rode down from Skull Ridge to the store and found Aurora
chopping wood. Cleve was genuinely irritated. He took the ax from
her. "That's something you never should do." He looked at the
woodpile. "There's enough stuff split for a week."</p>

<p>"I have to keep busy."</p>

<p>"Where's Jim?"</p>

<p>"Broken Bit took his horses last night. This morning he went
after them."</p>

<p>He took one swing at the wood on the block and came around. "My
God. Aurora, he didn't go there alone?"</p>

<p>"Is it that bad?"</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart breathed out his astonishment. "I thought he was
far too smart to fall into a trap like that."</p>

<p>She thought back on the morning scene, soberly visualizing
Keene. "I think," she murmured, "he knew what he was doing."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess so." Then he added hopefully, "Of course he did.
The man's proper element is trouble. I believe he even likes
it."</p>

<p>"He said he'd be back in a day or two."</p>

<p>"If he isn't here noon tomorrow," decided Cleve Stewart, "I'll
go to Grat's."</p>

<p>Aurora found herself freshly interested in him. He showed the
world a stubborn bulldog expression: his face, so square and
outthrust, fell into aggressive lines without effort. But she had
long ago noticed that his hardness was more apparent than actual.
He really had a streak of uncertainty in him and his eyes, the
warmest of brown, betrayed him. They were expressive eyes,
sensitive to change. In a way he reminded her of her father, who
had never been able to face pain or cruelty.</p>

<p>"Why are you so concerned?" she asked. "You don't like him."</p>

<p>He gave her an almost embarrassed glance. "Matter of fact I
really do. I got acquainted with him last night."</p>

<p>She said: "I wondered about that. Something happened. You
followed him. You had a fight."</p>

<p>"We had a hell of a brawl. To tell you the truth, Aurora, he
licked me." He shook his head. "I've heard of situations like that
but never expected to participate in one. He licked me and we're
friends." He showed her a kind of sheepish reluctance. "A good
knock-down-and-drag-out seems to be good for the soul."</p>

<p>"Why, Cleve!"</p>

<p>"I know. Silly of a grown man with some pretensions to an
education to get into a brawl. Or is it? Maybe I've been too damned
educated."</p>

<p>She said: "Don't apologize for yourself, Cleve. I think I like
you better for the change."</p>

<p>"I've always heard," he said dryly, "that women liked a dash of
the primitive in their men."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," she said.</p>

<p>"It all boils down to that," insisted Cleve Stewart. "One way or
another we've all got to fight. It took me a long time to learn
that. Your friend taught me something."</p>

<p>"Jim?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's fundamental. He never got tangled up with education.
The current runs straight in him, never muddied up with a lot of
nonsense. Simplicity, I suppose."</p>

<p>No, she thought, not simple. Direct and high-tempered, loving
the fresh, edged sensations of life. But not a simple man. A
thousand images boiled in his mind, his restless heart had its
complexity.</p>

<p>Stewart moved back to his horse. From the saddle he spoke again.
"I'll be by at noon. Aurora, do you have to stay here?"</p>

<p>"I've got to stay."</p>

<p>"All right. I worry about you a lot but I'll back you up."</p>

<p>She came beside his pony and laid a hand on his arm. "I like you
a lot better," she said. He was quite sensitive and this praise and
the touch of her hand got under his skin. He turned out of the yard
at once.</p>

<p>He had shown her a tougher fiber than she had believed he
possessed. Facing raw force and a kind of life he was really
unfitted for, he had made the difficult change. It was a rare kind
of courage; in one respect it was a greater courage than that of
Keene, who, like a gambler in a familiar game, knew the exact odds
against him at all times.</p>

<p>Still it was Keene she thought of during the afternoon. She
changed the picket stake of her pony to give it a new range of
grass. She watched the sun drop behind the western ridge in a brass
flare of light and made her supper in the condensing twilight.
Night brought its distinct coldness. She washed the dishes, brought
up water from the river and put the horse in the shed. Slipping on
a coat, she walked idly into the valley, through a curdled
blackness, hoping for the sound of hoofs in the valley, for a view
of Keene's oncoming shadow.</p>

<p>Fear oppressed her. She was really nervous. Realizing it, she
had a woman's moment of clear intuition. If she ever came to love
Keene, this would be what she must expect&mdash;these hours of
worry and wonder. He would never be different; always he would
answer to his natural instincts. Men like Cleve Stewart, less
forceful and more analytical, saw themselves with some detachment;
they had the power of change, the ability to bend and modify.
Keene, natural a man as breathed, could not.</p>

<p>There was neither sound nor sight of him on the valley floor.
She returned to the house, took up the lamp and went to the store
shanty. Unable to be still, she sorted out the groceries from the
boxes. Her mind kept digging at Keene and at herself. It was
alarming to realize how her thoughts included him. She wanted no
entanglement like that. If a man got into her life it had to be a
man like Stewart; a steady and enlightened man who would not tow
her from pillar to post, who would respect her burnt-child need of
security. All her life she had followed a man who, kind as he was,
had been blind to any needs but his own. To this gentle egocentric
who was her father she had surrendered her own rights as a person
and had concealed her own girlhood dreams because she could not
bear to hurt him. That would never happen again. Assaying herself
realistically, she knew that someday she would need marriage. But
when she married it would be to a man who saw her not only as one
to be loved and possessed, but as one who was his equal, to be
included in all his thoughts and all his needs; to a man who would
delight in watching her grow, to one who would need her strength
and thus make her proud of her own value to him. Cleve Stewart
would be like that. There were parts of him she could fill out;
perhaps she could give him, in return for his love, something as
necessary as love&mdash;a more complete faith in himself. This, she
now realized, was the reason for the troubled thought she had of
Jim Keene; there was a part of him she could never share, one
self-sufficient chamber that he would never open to anybody.</p>

<p>Always her thoughts drifted back to him, which was a sign of
danger. She had to be colder, she had to push her real self farther
into the background so that his interested eyes would not see her
need of warmth. She quit working on the groceries and took up the
lantern, moving out of the storehouse. She faced the door,
padlocking it, and turned to the other cabin; and at that moment
saw the high shadow standing before her&mdash;the shadow and then
the face of Red John.</p>

<p>The complete silence of his approach and the shock of his
presence went through her like terror. She had never known so
complete and paralyzing a fear; she threw herself back against the
storehouse wall, the lamp trembling in her hand. By the lamplight
she saw the gray dilation of his eyes, the self-assured half smile,
the rise of a hunting excitement on his features. She knew why he
had come.</p>

<p>"Sorry if I scared you," he murmured. "Would have made a noise
comin' in, only I figured you'd use your gun."</p>

<p>She had no power to speak at that instant; her mind was moving
too rapidly, she was watching him too closely. She knew why he was
here but she could not yet discern how much of a danger he was. She
was aware of his reputation and she could see the depth of his
boldness. He looked at her now with an insistent, masculine
attention, trying to read her weakness. His eyes had no modesty,
they credited her with none. About him was a soft and knowing
cynicism, as though he believed her to be easy.</p>

<p>"You've got a lot of fire," he said. "When you turned the gun on
Grat I admired your spunk. If it was me I'd never try to get you
out of here."</p>

<p>If she tried to be reasonable with him it would only give him
hope. So she said: "You get out of here."</p>

<p>"I'm not doing anything, am I?"</p>

<p>"I notice you don't come around when there's a man here."</p>

<p>"I'd take my chances on any man. Let me hold that lamp."</p>

<p>"Get on your horse and move along."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that."</p>

<p>"Don't I?" she said. The Winchester stood inside the log cabin's
door and she moved toward it. Red John slid over to the door,
blocking it. He turned still, watching her, reading her.</p>

<p>"If you want a man's help, pick a man that can do something for
you. You've got the wrong one now."</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;get out of here."</p>

<p>"What you so particular about? Keene lives here with you."</p>

<p>She threw the lamp at him, but never quite caught him off
balance. He clucked, taking the lamp on the shoulder. Kerosene
spilled on him; he knocked the lamp away before the flame exploded
on his coat. She pushed at him, trying to get into the cabin. He
reached out and caught her shoulders; he shook her and safighingid
something in a throaty, hard-breathing way. He pulled her in, his
mouth searching her face with a hot anxiety. She hit him on the jaw
and her fingernails dug through his skin and she felt him cringe
away. His hands ripped at her dress and she heard it tear away and
for a moment she fought him with a blind and furious hatred&mdash;a
hatred intensified by fear&mdash;catching his face with her nails
again and again until he had to break clear. She was exhausted and
she had lost her sense of direction. She flung out her arms and
found the door by accident, at once seizing the gun. But by then he
was in the outer darkness, shouting at her.</p>

<p>"You're not cold, sister. If you were you wouldn't be keepin' a
man around here. Why pretend to be something you ain't?"</p>

<p>She lifted the Winchester and let go. He was on his horse,
moving out from the cabin. She ran after him and fired a second
time at his shadow, and missed; and then the shadow vanished and
there was no use of wasting bullets. She was shaking, She was so
weak that the gun pulled her arms down. Her heart throbbed in her
throat, she couldn't pull enough wind into her lungs. She turned to
the cabin, dully remembering the lamp, and got on her hands and
knees to hunt for it; but the desire for light went as quickly as
it had come, and she went into the cabin and dropped the bar
against the door.</p>

<p>She sat on the bed, bent over in the darkness. She rubbed her
hands together, feeling grit between them. She knew that Red John,
believing her to be loose, would come again. He was that kind of
man. And then she thought: "I must not tell Cleve. Cleve would go
after Red John and be killed. Should I tell Jim?" Long afterward,
in bed and still shaking from reaction, she tried to answer that
question.</p>

<p>Sheltered by the darkness, Jennie stood at the river's bluff and
waited until she knew Red John wouldn't come. This was the second
night she had waited in cold, fearful hope. Presently she turned
and walked slowly toward the house. Once she paused, thinking she
heard his horse running through the night, but it was only a
homesteader on the southern flats; she went on, hating Red John and
hating herself. This prairie night which had always been so
beautiful to Jennie thickened around her and wrapped her in its
darkness and now she saw no beauty in it. She waited with her head
down, heavy-bodied and ashamed. She had pity for herself and
nothing but a sick dread of the days to come and that dread grew so
powerful that she thought of the river bluff and its hundred-foot
drop. She thought of it with a kind of sleepwalking fascination,
and morbidly pictured herself floating dead in the river, her hair
floating loose around the marble whiteness of her face. Once as a
child she had seen a woman in a coffin, dead of carbolic acid, with
that waxen whiteness on her cheeks.</p>

<p>She came into the yard and saw young Joe Spackman's horse there.
Joe was in the house with her folks and she thought they were
talking about her; the last few days it seemed that everybody had a
strange way of looking at her, as though they knew. She stepped
through the doorway and dropped her eyes from the strong lamplight.
Her mother gave her a quick glance, and she was afraid of her
mother now for the first time in her life. Young Joe put his hands
in his pockets; he pulled them out. He was ill-at-ease and he was
sorry because of the quarrel they'd had. Jennie met his eyes and
knew that he was ready to forget their quarrel. But she hated him
at that moment. He seemed to see that it was no use for he said,
"So long," and left the room.</p>

<p>As soon as he stepped into the yard she was afraid he wouldn't
come back. She followed him and found him beside his horse. He had
one hand on the saddle but he came around and showed her a fiery,
hopeful expression&mdash;that one expression which always made her
forget he was just young Joe Spackman, slow and steady. She had
nothing to say; she had lost her power to tease him and so she
stood and waited for him to speak. And then, waiting, she noticed
the expression fade. He spoke as a stranger would speak, even his
bitter jealousy gone.</p>

<p>"I guess he didn't show up tonight."</p>

<p>"No," she murmured. "He didn't show up, Joe."</p>

<p>"That's too bad," he said, so distant, so civil, so lost to
her.</p>

<p>He stared down at the dead set of her face and now she thought
he knew; she had to drop her glance from that agony of suspense and
reluctant suspicion showing on him. "I guess," she said in the
humblest voice, "I've spoiled things for us. It wouldn't be much
for you to kiss me anymore. I mean it wouldn't really mean what it
used to mean. Maybe you better not bother any more, Joe."</p>

<p>"Guess that's what you want."</p>

<p>"No, Joe. It isn't what I want. I guess that's all I can say. I
used to tease you a lot. I never meant it, Joe. I never meant to
make you feel bad. I'm awfully sorry."</p>

<p>He got on his horse and turned away. She called after him,
"Joe," and he stopped the horse, listening to her but not looking
back. "Joe," she said, "don't hate me. I hate myself, and that's
hard enough."</p>

<p>He rode out of the yard. She heard her mother coming but she
couldn't stop her crying; she cried without making a sound. Her
mother said: "You quarrel with Joe?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Her mother let out a long sigh and took Jennie's shoulders and
pulled her around. She looked at that little girl's soft face
smeared with its tragedy. Mrs. Cannon took her girl into her arms.
"We will not tell your father, Jennie."</p>

<p>"You don't hate me, Mama?"</p>

<p>"How could I hate my little girl?"<br></p>
<br>

<p>Coming down the valley as though a band of Shoshones were hot on
her trail, Portia Crews met Cleve Stewart at Keene's soddy. Portia
said "Whoaa," and came to a sliding halt before Cleve.</p>

<p>Stewart said: "You'll break your neck someday."</p>

<p>"My friend," observed Portia, "I like things to happen suddenly.
What does that serious look indicate?"</p>

<p>"Keene lost two horses day before yesterday and went after them.
He's not back yet."</p>

<p>"He'll get them. That man will."</p>

<p>"DePard took the horses."</p>

<p>Portia Crews breathed, "Oh, Cleve," and all her gaiety
disappeared. She was a pretty girl in every mood but this one; in
this moment of complete soberness she was beautiful. "So he went to
DePard's? Why did he do that? He knows what DePard&mdash;" She knew
the answer before she had finished asking it. "Of course he knows
DePard. And he wouldn't beat around the bush. Where are you
going?"</p>

<p>"To find out what happened."</p>

<p>She swung with him. They rode up-valley side by side in a
half-cold sunlight overcast by a gray-moving haze. They hit a brisk
clip and not for a half mile did the inevitable thought occur to
her. She turned to Stewart. "Why are you doing this, Cleve? You
don't like Keene."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I kind of do."</p>

<p>Being a woman she made a quick inference. "Or would it be for
the sake of Aurora Brant?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said. "But I said I liked Keene."</p>

<p>She watched the upper valley, her eyelashes touching; she was
soft and thoughtful. "How strange," she murmured. "Yesterday nobody
knew him. Today here we are riding to find him, because we like
him. Tomorrow he'll be gone."</p>

<p>"Will he?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "That's the way he is." Long later
in the day, not far from sundown, they turned into the chute which
rose to Broken Bit's front yard. She said: "What could you do,
Cleve?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"After all, you're a cattleman. That's your side of the
fence."</p>

<p>"Yours, too."</p>

<p>"No-o, Cleve. My side is wherever I want to be."</p>

<p>Stewart couldn't make his adjustment that easily. He had some
trouble explaining himself. "The homesteaders can take care of
themselves. But I draw the line on Grat DePard. That's too rough
for me."</p>

<p>"You've changed somewhat," she observed, and looked at the
nearing ranch with expressive distaste. "That place always gave me
the vapors. I never trusted Grat and I never got very close to any
of his crew. Sun has a hard time shining on Broken Bit."</p>

<p>As they came into the yard Jesse Morspeare moved around the
house to meet them. He stopped in the dust, staring at them out of
his small sullen eyes. Since neither of these two had any power he
was bound to respect he treated them to his dumb, animal-like
silence.</p>

<p>Stewart said: "Where's Grat?"</p>

<p>Morspeare jerked his head at the house.</p>

<p>Portia Crews fired her resentment point-blank at him. "Don't
stand there, you big overgrown ox. Tell him we're here."</p>

<p>Morspeare's face revealed that meanness which lay always so near
the surface.</p>

<p>"If you was a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No you wouldn't," broke in Portia Crews. "You wouldn't do a
thing unless the man was old or crippled. Well, I'll go get Grat
myself." She started to leave the saddle, and noticed watchfulness
spring to Morspeare's eyes. It told her something when he moved
toward the house, grumbling, "I'll get him."</p>

<p>"Cleve," whispered Portia, "he's here. Jim&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was quicker of eye than Cleve Stewart. While he sat still on
the saddle, slowly stiffening himself to a scene he dreaded,
Portia's glance ran around the yard. She knew Keene's horse and
looked for it in the corral. She watched the second-story windows
of the house; she listened for voices from the house. One man sat
near the barn, so posted as to keep an eye on the road leading into
the woods. The rest of the crew was away.</p>

<p>Grat DePard came from the house, Morspeare trudging silently
behind him. Grat, Portia noticed, threw an alert glance at her and
at Stewart. He didn't say: "Step down." That courtesy was missing.
All he said was:</p>

<p>"You're browsing a long way from pasture."</p>

<p>Stewart said: "Keene been here?"</p>

<p>"He was here."</p>

<p>"Here now?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not here now."</p>

<p>Portia, possessing a woman's profound interest in men's
reactions, noted that Stewart was relieved to have it pass off this
easily. It had been difficult for him, she realized, to come here;
he had obviously dreaded the trip. She liked him for the courage he
had shown but she had a quick picture of Keene sitting on that same
saddle, and knew how differently Keene would have spoken.</p>

<p>"Where did he go?" asked Stewart.</p>

<p>"Now how do I know?" answered DePard, becoming irritated.</p>

<p>Portia tried to throw him off balance with her question. "Did he
get the horses?"</p>

<p>But Grat gave her a gray, smart look. "What horses?"</p>

<p>If she had doubted him before, she now knew he was lying. There
was no reason for him to cover up the horses unless he had
something else to hide.</p>

<p>His thoughts, always nimble in this sort of thing, marched
parallel with her thought; he grew rough. "What the hell's the
difference to either of you? You turned homesteaders?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Grat," said Stewart.</p>

<p>"No," responded Grat, "I don't wait." He came forward until he
stood at the head of Stewart's horse. He took the cheek strap in a
hand, staring up. "Quit diddling around, Cleve. You with me or
not?"</p>

<p>Cleve set his jaw forward. He showed the tinge of paleness. His
voice skirted uncertainty and drew away from it. "I'm not with you
on any rough stuff."</p>

<p>"That's good," said Grat DePard, making his voice loud. "That's
fine. You're with me as long as it don't cost anything, but you're
not if it does. Damn a man that crawls on his belly. Where's your
backbone? You want me to do all the fighting while you sit back
reading a book somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Nobody asked you to do any fighting," said Cleve Stewart
reasonably.</p>

<p>"You think I'm just standin' still while these people come up
the valley and push me out."</p>

<p>"There are other ways," said Stewart. But it was a hollow answer
and he knew it to be such and closed his mouth. He was caught
between two factions and even yet could not bring himself to make
his stand. DePard knew that and pushed his question home.</p>

<p>"For the love of God, Stewart, don't straddle all your life. You
with me or not?"</p>

<p>Stewart sighed, long and deep. He spoke in a low voice. "If it's
got to be that way, Grat, I'm not with you."</p>

<p>Grat DePard let go the horse's cheek strap; he slapped it across
the jaw with the full swinging force of his hand. It went up on its
hind feet and around and for a moment it pitched along the yard.
Stewart fought it to a stop.</p>

<p>"It's more nerve than I thought you had," commented DePard. "Now
you get the hell out of my yard and don't come back. And don't
expect anything from me."</p>

<p>"Portia," said Stewart, "come on."</p>

<p>He started down the incline but Portia called to him. "We'll
take the hill trail, Cleve."</p>

<p>"No," contradicted DePard, "you keep going that way. I'm
surprised at you, Portia."</p>

<p>"Grat," announced Portia, "I take whatever trail I please." He
moved toward her horse. He reached for its bridle. Portia's cheeks
were red as dye. She called, "Cut that out," and jabbed her spurs
deep in the pony. The horse surged at DePard, knocking him back.
Morspeare ran forward and Stewart cried: "No, Portia." Portia
followed DePard. She rode him down and slashed him with her crop
and kept on going until she was near the hill trail. She turned to
face him and saw him with his gun out of his holster. He hadn't
pointed it, but she thought his intolerant anger might, in another
moment, drive him to it. Cleve trotted up and cut in front of her.
He called: "Don't do it, Grat!"</p>

<p>"Portia!" yelled DePard.</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Grat," repeated Stewart.</p>

<p>There was a sudden and tremendous change in DePard. One moment
he was out of control; and then he caught himself. "All right,
Portia," he breathed, "all right."</p>

<p>"Come on," said Stewart, and herded Portia around. They went
single file up the steep trail, the view of Broken Bit's yard
fading behind the trees. At the height of the ridge Portia stopped.
"I'll take this short cut home, Cleve."</p>

<p>"You think Keene's back there on Broken Bit?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Then she murmured: "You know something? Grat's
really afraid of women. I just noticed that. He doesn't know what
to do with them."</p>

<p>He said: "I'm going over the pass and see if he went that way.
If he hasn't I'll have to do something about Grat. I don't know
what it will be. Something."</p>

<p>"Cleve," she said, "you don't have to."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Yes, I have to." He looked at her, trying to
smile. "Fighting comes hard with me, Portia. But other things are
harder sometimes."</p>

<p>"You're a strange one, Cleve. You get me all mixed up trying to
follow you."</p>

<p>"That's what an education does to a man," he said.</p>

<p>"I like you, Cleve."</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, and rode around the bend of the trail.</p>

<p>Portia waited until the sound of his horse died in the pines.
Thereafter she moved through the trees, eastward, riding a half
circle around Broken Bit. Close to sunset she came to a ledge on
the north side of the ranch, dismounted and crawled forward until
she had Broken Bit's yard below her. Here at the same vantage point
Jim Keene had used two days before, she waited, not knowing what
she would do yet certain that Keene was in DePard's house. She
added one dismal qualification: He was there&mdash;if alive.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; DULL AND DARK
GIANT</h2>

<p class="first">KEENE struggled up through unconsciousness like a
swimmer fighting toward air. He moved through whirling indefinite
sensations of light and sound and unrelated stabs of feeling. The
first tangible thing was pain. It began to take root in his head,
in his chest, along his left side, setting up its steady attack.
Light was a brilliant flame in front of him; gradually as his sight
focused he looked beyond the light and discovered Snap impassively
near him. Snap crouched now in the corner of the room; he sat
motionless, a cigarette in his lips; his eyes were round and gray
and empty.</p>

<p>Keene moved his legs, at once rousing long runners of pain from
muscles hard battered by whatever had struck him. He rolled a
little and brought a hand over his eyes. Directly above him were
the slats of an upper bed; he was in the bunkhouse. Men's voices
set up an odd clack in the outer night. He distinguished DePard's
voice: "Tuck, you ride for Ellenburg." A few moments later DePard
came into the bunkhouse, followed by Red John.</p>

<p>DePard said: "Friend, you took a fall."</p>

<p>He was cool about it. In a way he was even amused; it was a drab
amusement, without the grace of pity. That was the kind of fighter
he was, Keene realized; one way or another DePard would get what he
wanted, unhindered by any scruples. And always he was cool. Looking
beyond him, Keene noticed the flicker of triumph in Red John's
eyes&mdash;the reviving memory of an old score which remained still
unsettled. It was Red John who came over to the bunk and looked
down on him. "Not so tough now," murmured Broken Bit's foreman.
"Just another sucker who made a bad bet. Know what happened to
you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I rode you down," said Red John. "You went under the horse,
rollin' like a keg." He enjoyed the memory of it, he relished it.
"I heard somethin' break and I thought it was your neck."</p>

<p>DePard spoke. "Naves is up in the house with a bullet hole clean
through him. Maybe he'll pull out of that. But maybe he won't.
Somethin' for you to think about, friend. You put the hole there."
Then he turned to the little man crouched on the floor. "He stays
in that bunk, Snap."</p>

<p>Red John's hazel eyes showed a dancing light: "You don't look so
big any more, Keene. You come in this country like a tall breeze
and folks got the idea you were a terror with rings on your tail.
Just a sucker, kid." His smile stretched wide. "You won't be much
help to that girl." He turned out of the bunkhouse with DePard.</p>

<p>Keene lay on his back, a hand over his eyes. The fear of
increased pain kept him still, yet pain pulsed all through him, so
that he had the sensation of motion. He had never known more brutal
misery. Heat burned at him, drying him out. He murmured: "How about
a drink of water, Snap?" Snap crouched against the wall, making no
answer.</p>

<p>He braced himself against each long wave of pain, like a man
meeting a strong surf head-on: the effort wore him out. He tried to
think of Broken Bit and his own position here, painstakingly
reviewing what had happened and what was yet to happen. That too
was a failure. Pain broke through every ordered thought; it reduced
Keene to the lowest stage of life&mdash;the bottom level of muscle
and nerve screaming for ease, with sensations of agony eating at
his control. At last, exhausted and hard-racked, he closed his eyes
and tried to swing with the recurring pulses, mentally rolling back
with each oncoming shock. That one thing helped; and at
last&mdash;long later&mdash;he fell into a half sleep.</p>

<p>He woke and found the light still burning. He thought Snap was
still in the room, though he was too tired to turn his head. His
senses faded to a kind of half rest, threading in and out of
troubled dreams and strange feelings that were not dreams; he heard
riders coming into the yard, their voices sharp through the night
silence. From the corner of his eyes he saw gray light in the
windows. Not long after that he dropped into real sleep.</p>

<p>When he woke again sunlight showed through the bunkhouse window
and Snap was gone. Riders crossed the yard, inbound. He heard
DePard speaking. For a little while Keene lay still, half afraid of
what he might find when he moved. Pain had left him during the
night, to be replaced by a cement-like stiffness. Moving his arms
he felt his muscles draw slowly. There was a great sore patch along
his chest and as he gradually doubled his knees he felt an instant
ache in his thighs. He had met Red John's horse with his chest and
in falling had turned to the right; most of his soreness was on his
left side. He felt the swollen patch on his left thigh.</p>

<p>He lifted himself with a good deal of effort. He bent over on
the bunk's edge, pulling the wrap from his back. He teetered
carefully up and down, strain biting him at each motion. He put his
teeth together; he was too dried out to sweat but the effect of
sweat worked along his face like nettles. He heard a man moving
toward the bunkhouse; and he was flat on his back when Snap came
in.</p>

<p>Snap waggled a thumb at him. "Over to the kitchen."</p>

<p>Keene swung from the bunk with a deep grunt. He stood up and
rubbed a hand across his face, his fingers catching a bump on the
side of his chin. He stopped in the doorway, putting a shoulder
point to the casing. Snap said: "Go on, go on." Keene stepped down
from the bunkhouse sill, grunting again at the drop. He moved with
a short, stringhalted limp. One ankle began to throb and he walked
on his heel to remove the pressure from it. Horses stood in the
yard and men waited in front of the house for something to happen.
Keene went into the kitchen and sat on a cracker box. He drank
three cups of black coffee before he touched his breakfast: and ate
with a hunger that had no end.</p>

<p>Snap was sleepy. He stood at the doorway, the long night's guard
loosening him. He was irritable. He said. "All right," and waggled
his thumb again. Keene moved back across the yard, seeing Red John
in the saddle. DePard stood near the foreman's horse, talking to
him. Keene watched those two until Snap grumbled.</p>

<p>"Cut it out." As soon as he got inside the bunkhouse, Keene
rolled on the bunk full length and built a cigarette. He took his
long drags on it, watching the smoke break against the slats of the
upper bunk. Snap had stopped at the doorway. He watched Keene a
moment and disappeared, leaving the door open.</p>

<p>Keene heard riders go out of the yard at a fast run. He finished
his smoke and dropped it on the bunkhouse floor. He faced his hands
across his belly, his thoughts moving slowly across his chances. He
thought of Snap, who was ready to fall asleep; his mind came to a
full stop on Snap. Snap was outside but when he came in he would
crouch at the base of the far wall, cross-legged and nursing his
thoughts, whatever they were, in dry silence. It was twelve feet
from this bunk to that wall.</p>

<p>He put Snap aside and reconstructed Broken Bit's yard in his
head. It was a ten-yard run from the bunkhouse to the corrals;
fifty feet more to the pines. A quick run without a horse. The
horse was out of it now. He was tired again and his thoughts were
slower and slower; the night and its misery caught up with him. He
had no knowledge of falling asleep.</p>

<p>DePard's voice said: "Friend, you're in trouble."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. DePard was in the room. Red John stood
beside him and Morspeare blocked the doorway with his immense
shoulders. Morspeare stood with his head ducked, faithfully staring
at DePard. Snap was gone and the sunlight didn't show in the
immediate yard. It was late afternoon, Keene realized. He had slept
through the day.</p>

<p>He pulled himself from the bunk. He forgot about his ankle and
put weight on it fully, and grabbed the upper bunk. He was
wide-awake.</p>

<p>"Naves died," said DePard.</p>

<p>Jesse Morspeare, answering the only impulse he knew, stepped
tentatively forward and showed a red immediate desire in his
eyes&mdash;a desire to use his clublike hands. Left to himself he
would have killed Keene at that instant. Red John's face held the
same gray amusement. He murmured: "Sucker." But DePard was cooler
than the other two, less controlled by either hatred or the need of
satisfaction. His mind had moved ahead. He was seeing things the
others did not see, he had made his own plans. All he said was,
"You should have joined me, friend," and left the bunkhouse. The
other two followed him.</p>

<p>Keene sat on the edge of the bunk, bent over, his hands gripped
together. He stared through the doorway, across the narrow vista of
the yard. The Chinese cook came out of the kitchen, sloshed a
kettle of water across the dust, and went back. It was edging
toward evening then and another set of riders went away. Presently
he heard a man run forward. The man appeared in the doorway and
looked at him a moment, and slammed the door shut. In a few minutes
he caught the voices of Portia Crews and Cleve Stewart.</p>

<p>He heard that talk, the quarrel, and DePard's last phrase.
Later, with Stewart and Portia gone from Broken Bit, Keene got up
and moved toward the bunkhouse window. He stood away from the
window, looking out of it at the farther yard. DePard and Morspeare
were by the front porch. Presently Red John stepped from another
corner of the house and joined them.</p>

<p>Keene cat-walked around the bunkhouse, his glance seizing every
article in it. He moved along the bunks, he ran his hands beneath
the straw ticks in hopeful search. He walked in a steady circle,
the old feeling beginning to sing. There were one table and one
chair in the bunkhouse and a stove in a corner. He lifted the stove
lid, hefting it in his hand; he calculated its possibilities and
laid it back. He paused by the chair, looking down at the lamp on
the table. He gripped the chair's top with his arms, swinging his
weight against it. Then he moved the chair to another side of the
table, within arm's reach of the bunk he had been using. Slowly
circling the room, he noticed one thing he had missed&mdash;a
mirror tacked to the wall. He faced the mirror and saw a blurred
face come back to him. Darkness had begun to settle through the
bunkhouse. He moved nearer the mirror, noting the dark-whiskered
surface of his cheeks, the heavy red scar gouged along the left
jaw. He murmured, "Tight, friend. Tight." The man in the mirror
showed a hard-mouthed grin; that man looked bad enough to scare a
horse. The supper triangle suddenly made a long ringing racket in
the yard. A set of riders came rapidly into home quarters.<br></p>
<br>

<p>DePard sat in the porch rocker, with Red John before him and
Morspeare a great dull shape beside him. Red John said: "If
Ellenburg tells it around that Naves got shot people will know
where Keene is. They'll be lookin' this way."</p>

<p>"Who's goin' to look?"</p>

<p>Red John said: "All right. What you thinkin' about now?"</p>

<p>"Tonight we're cutting every piece of homestead wire on the
Silver Bow."</p>

<p>"You leavin' Keene here?"</p>

<p>"Jesse will stay to watch him."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Morspeare. He was a great dull lump in the
gathering dark, faithfully watching Grat to find what was required
of him. He moved around so that he might catch DePard's
expression.</p>

<p>"Just watch him, Jesse," said DePard.</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>Red John gave out his warning. "Don't fool with that fellow too
long."</p>

<p>"No, not too long," said DePard.</p>

<p>"Then there's that Brant girl. She says she's stayin'."</p>

<p>"She had a man to help her. She ain't got him now."</p>

<p>"Suppose," said Red John, "you don't scare 'em by cuttin' their
wire?"</p>

<p>DePard looked at his foreman. "You afraid of something,
Red?"</p>

<p>"Me?" said Red John and tried to wave it away. "Always got to
think of the other fellow's hole card, Grat."</p>

<p>"If I didn't know this game," said DePard, "you think I'd be
playin' it?"</p>

<p>"I guess not, Grat."</p>

<p>"They don't know me. Nobody knows me, Red. I never make a move
unless I mean it. Sometimes I don't move&mdash;and maybe somebody
thinks I'm bluffing. I never ran a bluff in my life and I never
backed up. Those homesteaders think they can wait me out and eat me
up little by little. I know what they're thinkin'. They figure that
they've got somebody to do the fightin' they ain't able to do.
That's Keene. I hear it said he's the man they're countin' on. If
it ain't enough to cut their wire then I know something that will
clear up the Silver Bow overnight."</p>

<p>"I don't get it, DePard."</p>

<p>DePard rose from the rocker, absorbed by his speculations. Red
John, possessing his weaknesses of flesh and his moment of doubt,
had his uneasy intimations of a trouble he could not name or see.
What he feared was DePard's inhuman faith in himself.</p>

<p>"Keene's the Dutch courage for those homesteaders," said DePard,
"and for the girl. Remember that box-elder tree at the ford, Red?
If those people found their Dutch courage swingin' from that tree
with his neck crooked they wouldn't stay." He stared straight at
Red John. "You don't know me very well, either, Red. I'll do what's
got to be done."<br></p>
<br>

<p>Keene heard Broken Bit leave the yard in one long running
column. Dust drifted across the yard and softly sifted through the
cracks of the bunkhouse wall. It was completely dark. He fished up
a match to light the lamp on the table and then a new thought
arrested him and he held the burning match in his hand, turning the
thought around his head until the flame scorched his fingers. He
dropped the match. Somebody moved over the yard slowly and opened
the door.</p>

<p>Morspeare said: "Go get your supper."</p>

<p>Keene moved through the door, with Morespeare stepping backward
and aside. The man was a massive beast in whose small, cloudy brain
stray thoughts and impulses moved toward blind ends. The whole
night had changed; something had happened and now Morspeare was
watching him like a huge rhino uncertainly waiting for the impulse
to drop his head and charge.</p>

<p>Keene sat down to the kitchen table. Hungry as he was he ate but
little and took a long time at it, steadily searching his mind for
the answer to Morspeare's presence. He heard nothing from the yard.
It lay wholly silent, squeezed by the blackness of the surrounding
hills.</p>

<p>Morespeare said: "Come on."</p>

<p>Keene moved into the yard again. Morspeare backed away and once
more came to a stand in the shadows. Keene stopped. "I need a
smoke, Jesse," he explained and carefully reached for his tobacco.
He rolled up the cigarette, looking to either side of him and
seeing no more Broken Bit men. He lighted the smoke. "I been in
that damned bunkhouse all day. Let me walk around the corral."</p>

<p>Morspeare nursed his ponderous silence. Water dripped steadily
into the corral trough. Wind, freshly risen from the east, ruffled
the tree tops. Morespeare said at last: "All right."</p>

<p>Keene passed the bunkhouse and got into the deeper shadows
clinging to the corral. A horse laid its muzzle against the corral
posts, emitted a trumpeting blast of wind and ran away. Keene moved
to the right, limping on his left heel, keeping the circle of the
corral's side near his left shoulder. Morspeare's boots heavily
scuffed the earth behind him. Morspeare coughed.</p>

<p>Half around the corral, Keene picked up the blocky shadow of the
barn at the edge of the yard and suddenly was convinced that he was
alone with Morspeare&mdash;and the cook. Everybody else had gone.
Continuing, he faced the house again, seeing only one pony before
the porch. That would be Morspeare's.</p>

<p>He had been moving slowly on but now he stopped, the sharpest of
sensations tearing along his nerves. He was for that instant frozen
in his tracks, not knowing why. The shock had come first; now the
reason for the shock followed&mdash;Morspeare had quit moving.
Morspeare was back in the shadows, still as a dead man. Keene had
the cigarette in his mouth. He lifted his arm and expelled a breath
of smoke and made his careful pivot.</p>

<p>Morspeare stood fifteen feet away with his revolver lifted and
pointed straight on Keene's chest.</p>

<p>The arrival of the bullet waited only on the final pressure of a
half-crooked finger. Morspeare, that great and dark-minded animal,
had run true to form. Pulled by sullen loyalty and by his own
unlighted savageness, he had tramped around the corral in vague
anger, to be finally caught by one powerful thought, to be made
deadly by it. The thought was plain. Morspeare, brooding upon his
wrongs and those of his master, to whom he owed a doglike faith,
had decided to shoot Keene in his tracks, and then explain it,
perhaps, by saying Keene had tried to break away.</p>

<p>The impulse to throw himself aside trembled along Keene's legs.
He had to set himself against it; he had to freeze himself in his
tracks. He said: "Afraid?"</p>

<p>Morspeare let the gun muzzle dip. His voice burst through the
night.</p>

<p>"Me? I ain't afraid of nothin' that walks."</p>

<p>"The hell you're not. What's that gun up there for?"</p>

<p>Morspeare slid the gun into its holster. He said: "You go on
back to the bunkhouse."</p>

<p>Keene wheeled about, cutting away from the corral wall. He moved
on, one shoulder lifted by a strain that would not leave. But he
knew now, from what Morspeare had intended to do, that the yard was
empty. He went into the bunkhouse. He sat on the bunk's edge,
watching Morspeare move through the door. The big man lifted the
lamp and stepped back to the wall, placing his vast shoulders to
it. He was still nursing Keene's talk in his slow mind, working it
over and over; his lips came apart and he stood this way, nothing
restraining the overbearing greed of his strength but some thin
tether of uncertainty he now was obviously trying to break.</p>

<p>"Why the hell should I be afraid of you?" he wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Maybe you just wanted to shoot a hole in the dark."</p>

<p>"If I had my way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure. You'd shoot me in the back and tell DePard I tried to
run."</p>

<p>"How'd you know that?" asked Morspeare in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>Keene pulled out his tobacco and creased a paper between his
fingers. He shook tobacco into the paper, caught the pouch string
between his teeth and let it dangle while he rolled the smoke.</p>

<p>"How'd you know that?" insisted Morspeare, the oddness of it
clinging to his mind.</p>

<p>Keene replaced the tobacco sack in his pocket. He sat with the
cigarette in his mouth, crouched on the bunk's edge and looking
straight at the lamp. His eyelids moved nearer. He saw the square
doorway's black mouth, he saw the lamp, he saw Morspeare. Morspeare
was near enough the doorway to block it with one roll of his body
and for an instant Keene debated some phrase or act which might
move the big man deeper into the bunkhouse, away from the door. But
in Morspeare strange streaks of cunning leavened his ignorance and
it was too much of a risk to arouse that cunning. Keene let his
hands dangle over his legs; pressure got into his legs, awaking
half-settled aches and pulling at sore muscle masses. This was as
near the time as he would ever get; thinking that, he watched
yellow light pour through the opening kitchen door across the yard.
The Chinaman came out, threw a pail of water on the dust, and
returned to the kitchen, leaving the door open. Morspeare turned
his head to watch the Chinaman, one great cord in his neck standing
sharp and straight from ear base to throat point. Then, realizing
this error, he whipped his glance back to Keene.</p>

<p>"You answer me," he grumbled, "or I'll bust you."</p>

<p>Keene rose from the bunk. He stood stooped at the table,
bringing his face toward the top of the lamp chimney to light the
cigarette. He brought up the lamp and held it that way until the
cigarette caught fire; and kept on lifting the lamp until it was at
his shoulder. He flung it into the far corner of the room and made
a jump for the door.</p>

<p>He had forgotten his sprained left ankle and he had incorrectly
judged the quickness of Morspeare in action. The weight of his jump
collected on that bad ankle; it gave way and threw him to the
floor&mdash;and the next moment Morspeare's body blocked the door
from side to side.</p>

<p>The lamp broke against the wall and kerosene smell filled the
room, and the guttering blue glare of the wick suddenly flared into
full fire leaping at the stain of kerosene on the pine wall. Flat
on the floor, Keene heard Morspeare's shout, he saw both
Morspeare's feet come forward. Keene rolled. He seized the legs of
the table and flung it over as Morspeare made his jump. Tripped at
the knees by the table, the big man crashed down.</p>

<p>Keene threshed through the tangle of table legs, rolling and
rising. Morspeare was on his feet. He was across the room in one
tremendous rush, his great hands reaching for Keene. He missed the
side-dodging Keene and shook the bunkhouse as he struck the wall.
He was away from the wall, his head down, driving at Keene again.
Keene wheeled, ducking low under Morspeare's reaching hand. He
jumped the capsized table, seized the chair, and whipped himself
around. Fire licked along the wall, the pine boards began to crack.
One runner of flame raced under a bunk and caught hold of a straw
tick. Heat swelled in the room and smoke flowed across it. Keene
had the chair half lifted and Morspeare was a great animal coming
at him once more in a terrible, cursing haste, so bereft of thought
that he had forgotten his gun, so filled and swamped by his one
great greed that no outside thought touched him; he was a
battering, insensitive wall of flesh. Keene caught him with the
chair, driving the point of a leg against his mouth and through his
teeth. Morspeare let out a huge, savage cry and reached for the
chair. He caught one rung and splintered it in his fingers. Keene
dodged behind him; and then Morspeare was around and charging
again, turned mad, his arms out-reached for the chair. Keene felt
the fire breathe at his legs. He brought the chair full down on
Morspeare's head; he saw it fall apart around the big man's
shoulders. Morspeare stopped in the middle of the room, blind and
stunned; he reached up with his hands to draw them oddly down over
his head.</p>

<p>Keene's legs came against the stove, reminding him of the iron
lid. He reached for the lid and missed it, but his hands caught the
stove's front grating and he broke it from its hinges, carrying the
whole stove from its legs. Morspeare jumped again. Keene brought
the iron grating from behind in one circling upward loop and hit
him across the side of the head. The weight of Morspeare went
against him and took him down. Fighting free, he smelled the scorch
of his own hair. He rolled Morspeare back and climbed around him on
his hands and legs. In the middle of the room he faced about,
expecting the big man to be at him again. Morspeare lay still, his
arms touched by flames.</p>

<p>Smoke stung Keene's lungs. Still on his hands and knees, he
caught Morspeare by the legs and dragged him toward the door. He
stood up and got the big fellow by the coat collar, rolling him
into the yard.</p>

<p>The Chinaman was at the kitchen doorway. He was crying in a high
jangled voice and beating the supper triangle. Keene yelled at him,
whereupon the Chinaman jumped inside the kitchen and slammed the
door.</p>

<p>Keene turned Morspeare over and over. He reached down and
unbuckled Morspeare's gun belt and strapped it on&mdash;and ran at
the kitchen door. He knocked it open, to find the Chinaman standing
in the middle of the room with a long knife pointed straight ahead
of him. Keene said:</p>

<p>"You watch him."</p>

<p>He ran out of the kitchen, hugging the house wall until he was
certain no other man remained on Broken Bit. He reached Morspeare's
horse and stepped to the saddle. The bunkhouse doorway and its
window were red-white with flame; sparks circled slowly from the
chimney as he crossed the yard. At the foot of the hill trail he
turned the horse to have a last look. He thought: That house is
going to catch fire. Flame exploded through the bunkhouse roof; the
Chinaman slowly labored Morspeare along the ground toward the north
side of the yard. Keene turned into the hill trail&mdash;and heard
a woman's voice calling:</p>

<p>"Jim."</p>

<p>He saw Portia Crews move from the near-by pines into the
outreaching light of the fire. Distant in the hills somewhere,
above the snore of the fire, he thought he heard a shot. Portia
Crews rode in against him; she was a tall, bending shape in the
saddle. Her hand reached out and her broad lips expressively moved
as she touched his face. All this light made her hair yellower than
he remembered it; it softened her smile. "Jim!"</p>

<p>He sat loose in the saddle, his leg troubling him and a revived
pain hammering his chest. He heard another shot, this time
unmistakably definite, and then saw two riders rush into the yard
from the hills across the way.</p>

<p>Portia said: "Come on, Jim! I saw DePard take part of his crew
into the valley. But there's more of Broken Bit scattered around
here. Follow me!"</p>

<p>"Circle around to the valley&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say anything, Jim! Follow me!"</p>

<p>Looking at her he saw genuine fear on her face; behind its
strength and its willfulness and its beauty he saw fear. Energy
slipped rapidly out of him, the old salt sting of temper went away.
He said: "All right," and obediently turned, following her up the
hill into the darkness and into the bite of a rising east wind.</p>

<p>She called softly back: "Keep close to me, Jim. I saw four
Broken Bit men up here near sundown."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; IN THE CANYON</h2>

<p class="first">KEENE had followed Portia along the black and
winding mountainside trail for a steady ten minutes when he called
a halt, impelled by a warning that was nothing more than a sense of
having trusted chance too far. There was no other reason for
stopping; yet this impalpable threat of uncertainty which somehow
made everything wrong was the oldest and surest of his guides. He
said: "Wait," and drew off the trail. She pushed her horse after
him and the two of them turned thoroughly still, hearing the steady
breathing of the ponies and, above them, the strengthening sweep of
wind in the pine tops. From this height they saw the glare of the
burning ranch. The bunkhouse was a dark-traced skeleton in a yellow
ball of flame; the main house roof had begun to burn. The Broken
Bit yard was day-bright and now they saw men running in and out of
the house.</p>

<p>"We're going the wrong way, Portia. I want to get back to the
valley."</p>

<p>She said as an apparent side thought: "I met Dr. Ellenburg on
the trail yesterday. He was coming back from Broken Bit. What
happened to Naves?"</p>

<p>"He's dead."</p>

<p>She pointed at the fire below them. "And then that. DePard will
never let you spend another day at the ford."</p>

<p>He thought of DePard riding out at twilight and he thought of
Aurora at the ford, and the feeling of things turning wrong nagged
at him. He sat quiet watching the roof of the main house explode
into one tremendous cone of flame. He counted five men down there.
Three of them rode over the yard and disappeared on the trail he
had so recently taken. "They're following," said Portia. "From now
on they'll never quit following. Don't you see that?"</p>

<p>"We could make a wide circle and follow the ridge back to the
Silver Bow," said Keene, thinking aloud. "Wonder where DePard
went?"</p>

<p>She knew what troubled him and what pulled him toward the ford
so strongly. "That's the first place they'll look for you,
Jim."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At the ford."</p>

<p>"Sure," he said. "They'll go straight there."</p>

<p>She realized she had said the wrong thing. Now he would never
rest until he got back to Aurora Brant. That was a bitter thought
for her and brought her close to the worst fear she had&mdash;the
fear that perhaps he loved the homestead girl. Of that she was
still unsure and therefore had her own hopes. But she realized more
clearly than he did how small a chance of survival he had if he
returned to the ford. DePard would storm through these hills night
and day to find Keene; he would lie in wait by the ford, he would
watch every trail. And so Portia, wanting him to be safe, lied.</p>

<p>"That girl," she said in an offhand manner, "is all right. Cleve
Stewart took her up to his place yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>By his quick lift of head she knew it took something from his
conscience; she pressed her talk softly against him. "We're wasting
time, Jim. Those fellows are coming up this trail. There's another
bunch holding beef in a meadow just south of here, not far away.
And DePard will be back pretty soon. We've got to get off this
mountain. I know this country. I know where to go."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>He followed her again. The trail moved upward in bending, unseen
curves and reached a minor crest and kept to it for a mile or more.
Up here the night wind was thin and sharp; winter moved over the
land this night, sweeping out the last summer's warmth. He heard
its crisp singing in the trees. Portia murmured back at him,
"Down," and took another trail. They dropped through layers of
darkness, came to a pine flat and a road lying east and west. Keene
moved abreast Portia Crews, traveling at a steady run along the
road. They had left the wind behind and now only the steady rhythm
of the horses disturbed the night. But he bent on the saddle,
listening, and suddenly said: "Off the road," and charged into the
trees, Portia behind. He stopped in the timber. Portia whispered,
"What?"</p>

<p>Sound murmured forward and grew into a beating rhythm of three
or four riders moving westward toward Broken Bit in haste. Keene
saw their shapes vaguely and impermanently against the night and
heard one voice speak. He sat still, aware of Portia's hand resting
on his arm. It was a light and steady pressure&mdash;a soft,
fugitive offer of her presence. One voice in the distance came
briskly back. "Smell that dust!" And then the party had stopped and
was still. Presently the same voice called into the night: "Broken
Bit!"</p>

<p>Another voice harked thin and brief through the silence. "Shut
up, Len."</p>

<p>"Somebody ridin' around here."</p>

<p>Silence closed down, with that group attentively paused on the
road. Presently one man cruised back. He came abreast Keene and
Portia&mdash;twenty feet distant&mdash;and reined in to again
listen. His horse blubbered and flung up its head, the metal of its
bit jingling like music. This rider murmured: "Somebody around
here."</p>

<p>"Come on, Len."</p>

<p>Portia's fingers clung to the cloth of Keene's sleeve. He heard
her sigh. In another moment the riders on the road went away at a
long run.</p>

<p>"That was close," said Portia. "We might have bumped into them.
Come on."</p>

<p>She didn't immediately return to the road, but found a side
trail that circled into Lost Man Ridge. The country grew rougher
and sharper-sloped. Within half an hour she was on the main road
once more. When she left the road she struck north-east, dropped
into a narrow ravine and crossed a creek. Looking overhead, Keene
saw the broken edges of hills flung carelessly against the metal
sky. They went deeper into this country, through one close defile
and another, across narrow pockets, along sheer cliff faces and on
up through pines. They had been in the saddle, he judged, better
than two hours when they entered a canyon no more than six yards
wide, skirted the stony margin of a creek clashing rapidly
downgrade, and at last stopped.</p>

<p>"This is it," she said, and stepped from the saddle.</p>

<p>Above him he saw the blankness of perpendicular walls. The creek
rattled at his feet. He got stiffly down from the horse, moving
forward through ink-black shadows to a kind of rock gallery cut
into the canyon wall. He turned from the gallery and walked beside
the creek, and presently his exploring hands touched short pines
clinging to the steep walls. Stripping off all the branches he
could reach, he returned to the gallery. The resin blisters of the
branches exploded into sudden light and warmth when he held a match
to them.</p>

<p>He said: "Where is this?"</p>

<p>"East of Broken Bit five or six miles. You're in the Short
Hills, Jim. If you went south you'd come out at the Silver Bow
Canyon, twelve miles from the ford." Her voice lightened and grew
hopeful. She was asking something of him and for a moment he didn't
know what it was; she was really eager to have him say some one
thing. Then he thought he knew.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, "for the help."</p>

<p>"Ah," she answered, and was pleased. She dropped to the ground,
near him. "This is a spot I found, riding one time. I said if I
ever had to hide this would be the place. They'll be a long time
finding you here." Then she slowly added, "Long enough for you to
rest and move on."</p>

<p>He dropped to his shoulders, lying on the hard floor of the
gallery. Firelight reached back another ten feet and came against
the gallery's end; it danced on the rock and dirt ceiling above.
Smoke lifted to the ceiling and drifted outward. Fire's heat made a
half-barrier against the raw damp cold slowly condensing in the
canyon. His ankle ached and the battered muscles of his chest and
left side steadily throbbed. What pressed against him now as a dead
weight was the let-down following hard action; he was emptied of
strength, he had no enthusiasm, no wish to think. Even the
necessity of rising to scout more wood for the fire was a dreary
chore; he lay there, all passive, unresisting, glad to drop his
guard.</p>

<p>Portia said: "What now, Jim?"</p>

<p>"You're sure Aurora went up to Stewart's place?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The ford's the first place DePard will go," he reflected.
"He'll burn that store. Tough for Aurora. Had her heart set on that
spot."</p>

<p>"She can change her heart. Most of us have to do that." She
still wanted to know what Keene's own desire was; it grew
increasingly important to her. "What next, Jim?"</p>

<p>"A night's sleep."</p>

<p>She said: "I think I can guess where DePard went tonight. To
raise trouble with the nesters. That's been in his mind ever since
the nesters came. He'll drive them out, Jim. What's to stop him?
Who can stand up against Broken Bit?"</p>

<p>He said: "We'll see."</p>

<p>She sat near him, holding his eyes with her glance. She was a
woman with a will, with her own daring. Her lips were broad and
softly placed together and firelight flowed over her features and
heightened the yellow shining of her hair. At that moment every
thought she had was of him; those thoughts reached toward him and
touched him intimately. "Don't think of it, Jim. You're a marked
man. If you stay in this country you'll never know which trail
holds your death. You'll never dare show yourself in the valley.
They'll be waiting for that and they'll box you in. Daylight's not
much good for you now." Her voice dropped to a quiet low tone. "Not
easy for me to say this&mdash;but why don't you just ride out, the
same way you rode in?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I guess not."</p>

<p>"Why stay when it means DePard will kill you sometime, somehow?
What is it, Jim? Why?"</p>

<p>"I guess that was settled the night I saw Morspeare slug
Spackman, in town. That was a hard thing to watch."</p>

<p>"It happens every day, all over the world."</p>

<p>"A little man against a big one," he reflected. "I saw
Spackman's eyes when he got up. A little man looking at something
he couldn't lick&mdash;being pushed around by something he couldn't
fight. Everything he dreamed about, for himself and his kids, down
in the dust, busted to pieces. Ashamed of himself in front of his
family. That kind of a look in his eyes."</p>

<p>"Is that your fight, Jim? Or is it that you just have to fight,
because that's the only thing you like?"</p>

<p>He showed her his first smile; it broke self-deprecatory and
gentle across the battered, whisker-dark planes of his face. "How
do I know? A man was put in the world to do something. The only
thing I can do is fight. Maybe that's it."</p>

<p>She steadied her chin on her hand. "You're odd," she murmured,
"and you'll be cold tonight." She got up and went outside and was
gone for a long while, returning at last with an armful of pine
limbs and pieces of wood drifted up from the creek. She freshened
the fire, kneeling before it. She turned perfectly still, her head
dropped and her eyes watching him. "I'll be back in the morning
with something to eat&mdash;and a razor. You look too tough with
whiskers. I like my men smooth-cheeked." An unsettled expression
went across her eyes and left its increasing disturbance on her
face. She was near Keene. She put a hand on his chest and let it
lie there; she seemed to be drawn completely into herself,
listening to an inner voice, to an inner command. Suddenly she bent
down and kissed him, her lips warm and the fragrance of her hair
very strong to his senses.</p>

<p>She pulled herself back. "Did it mean anything to you, Jim?"</p>

<p>He looked up at her, his senses sharp-whipped. She saw the lean
kink of muscles along his cheek, the repression he threw into them;
and she saw the ancient manlike expression in his glance, the gray
and heavy and hungry awareness of her presence. He said: "Don't do
that again, Portia."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, half laughing, and pleased with the feeling she
had produced. "You'll be miserable tonight. I'd stay&mdash;I'd keep
the fire for you."</p>

<p>"You start home."</p>

<p>She rose and left the gallery again. She came back with his
saddle and blanket. She put the saddle under his head and laid the
blanket over him. Her fingers, warm and soft, ran across his mouth.
She murmured, "Good night," and then in an altered and apprehensive
voice, she added: "Don't leave until I see you again, Jim. You
won't, will you?"</p>

<p>"All right," he said, and watched her go.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Nine o'clock that night DePard crossed the Silver Bow at the
Black Bluff ford, twelve miles east of Aurora's store, and came
upon the first homestead fence. This was the fence of Aleck
Comrie&mdash;that angular and reserved pipe-smoking Scotch bachelor
who held his eccentric theories of farming, one of which was that
the Silver Bow was orchard country. He had ordered the young trees
from Missouri, had planted them along the river bluff and had put
his barbwire around them. After a summer in a soil whose riches
could only be unlocked by water, half the orchard was dead, but it
was Comrie's contention that the hardy survivors would adjust
themselves to dry land.</p>

<p>Comrie sat in his doorway and watched DePard's riders move
straight at the yard. He knew then he was in for trouble but his
only reaction was to tap his pipe against the doorsill and refill
it. The group rode up. DePard said: "You're Comrie?"</p>

<p>"That would be so," admitted Comrie and lighted a match on his
thumbnail. The flare of it slanted along the angular jaw, the
frosty gray eyebrows&mdash;along the winter quiet of his eyes; and
went out.</p>

<p>DePard sent his riders into the orchard with a brief, "All
right," himself standing watch in front of Comrie. Comrie leaned
back against the door frame; his lips made little puckering noises
at the pipestem. "We're cutting that fence, Comrie," said
DePard.</p>

<p>"Aye," said Comrie, "it seems like that from here."</p>

<p>"Don't put it up again."</p>

<p>Comrie heard the tight wire snap when cut. He watched the
shadows drift around the orchard; he watched them collect and move
into the yard again, the job done. DePard said in a sharper
voice:</p>

<p>"You hear?"</p>

<p>"My hearin's good," admitted Comrie, the starched, burred
inflections of his voice strong as the smell of heather on a damp
day.</p>

<p>"Fine," said DePard.</p>

<p>But Comrie did not wish to be misunderstood and now added
distinctly: "I did not say I wud not put it up again."</p>

<p>DePard said: "You put it up again and I'll drag this shanty over
the bluff, you in it. Better leave the country, Comrie. I'm running
cattle on these flats next spring and I don't want you around."</p>

<p>He whirled away with his riders, leaving the Scotchman solemnly
sucking his pipestem. Comrie smoked on until nothing but cold ashes
remained; and rose and knocked the pipe against the doorsill. Then
he murmured to himself, "I did not say I wud leave the country,
either."</p>

<p>DePard rode a crisscross pattern over the desert. There was no
wire at Ambler's but he paused to drop his hint.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't stay here long, if I were you people."</p>

<p>The Brighthand family was away. DePard wrecked the door of the
shanty, threw a loop around the stove and dragged it to the yard.
He ran into wire again at Elijah Patterson's place and cut it
before Patterson's anguished eyes. At the Kilrain shanty he faced
an Irishwoman who swore at him steadily as long as he stayed. She
had her children behind her, but still she swore. Mrs. Kilrain kept
saying:</p>

<p>"Kilrain, go get your gun! Don't stand there! Go get your
gun!"</p>

<p>Kilrain shook his head, knowing better. It was Red John who
lassoed the Kilrain rig, towed it on into the prairie and tipped it
over.</p>

<p>Far off to the north other homestead lights winked at
lonely-spaced intervals. DePard traveled steadily west, visiting
those nesters in his path, and as he traveled he grew more
impatient with his own mildness until at last, when he reached the
Cannon yard, he was a harder man than he had been at Comrie's. It
was close to midnight then, with the Cannons silent inside the
lightless shack. DePard called impatiently at Cannon, his men
meanwhile threshing through the yard. Somebody found an ax and
began to break up Cannon's new well frame.</p>

<p>Cannon came to the doorway, a white shape in his nightgown. Mrs.
Cannon cried: "Come back in here, Sam," but Cannon stepped into the
dust with his bare feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. DePard," he said, "what are you after? Let my place
alone."</p>

<p>"You don't want trouble, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Cannon, "I want no trouble."</p>

<p>"Then get out of here."</p>

<p>"Mr. DePard," said Cannon, "I'm an old man and I have seen more
trouble than you have ever seen. I am not bothering you. I'm a man
of peace. This country's big enough for all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," contradicted DePard, "it ain't. Leave the country, old
man, or I'll be here again." He called up his riders and moved out
of the yard. Cannon followed him. Mrs. Cannon kept crying: "Sam,
come back here." But Cannon, his nightgown making a gaunt and gray
apostle of him, followed DePard and spoke on.</p>

<p>"You are not the law. I have seen men like you before and I have
seen them make the same mistake. No man is as great as the law. No
man is almighty. What you are doing is wrong. You have no right to
destroy and I have no right to destroy."</p>

<p>Broken Bit's riders moved around him. He was caught in the
center of the group; he walked rapidly to keep from being stepped
on by the horses. He was pushed aside by the horses, and pushed
back. He breathed harder, he tried to catch DePard's reins and his
voice was the saddened voice of a man seeing evil and pouring his
honest goodness against it. He reached for DePard's hand.</p>

<p>"There are men, Mr. DePard, who will take your example. If you
destroy, they will destroy and we will all be fighting. That is not
the way for men to live."</p>

<p>"Get on," said DePard, and put his boot against Cannon's chest.
The pressure forced the old man against Red John's horse, whereupon
Red John reached down and shoved Cannon away. Cannon reached again
for DePard's arm.</p>

<p>"Don't you see what you're doing, Mr. DePard? The law is your
defense as well as mine. You are strong enough now to have your
way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on, old man."</p>

<p>"&mdash;But someday the homesteaders will be strong and you will
want the protection of the law. If you destroy it, Mr. DePard, you
are signing your own death warrant."</p>

<p>DePard ripped his gun from its holster and spoke one fiery word
and brought the barrel of the gun down on the old man's head. Mrs.
Cannon came from the house, screaming: "Sam&mdash;Sam, what's the
matter?" Broken Bit rushed away and dust shimmered in the dark
night and Cannon, wrapped in his apostle's robe, lay dead on the
ground.</p>

<p>Red John heard Mrs. Cannon's scream, and Red John was afraid. He
pushed his horse beside Grat DePard. "That was a damn-fool thing to
do!"</p>

<p>"Tired of listening to him. Next time he'll keep his mouth
shut."</p>

<p>"Next time, hell. He's an old fellow. Maybe you killed him."</p>

<p>Spackman's lay to the right, a mile off Broken Bit's trail.
DePard drew in, considering the dark distant square of the Spackman
shanty. He listened to Red John's irritated, half-worried
voice.</p>

<p>"He dropped like a dead man. You exposed yourself on that one,
Grat. All these homesteaders know it was us."</p>

<p>"What good does it do 'em?" asked Grat coolly.</p>

<p>"Trouble," grumbled Red John.</p>

<p>"Not for me," answered DePard, confidently. "I'm makin' the
trouble, Red. For the other fellow, not for me." He had put the
Spackman shanty out of his mind and now turned to the ford. Broken
Bit went rattling across the shallowed water, the clack and grind
of their passage rolling brittle echoes on ahead. DePard swept wide
of the store and then Red John, who had studied his boss for many
years, knew that one of his silent observations was true. Grat
DePard, totally unafraid of any man on earth, had a spooky aversion
to women. Not understanding them, unable to forecast their actions,
he lost his sureness when he came to deal with them; and so now he
ran around Aurora Brant's, heading into the valley.</p>

<p>Red John said: "Somebody coming."</p>

<p>The outfit reined in, hearing a single horse rush down the
valley. DePard said: "Red, drift off a bit," and watched the
foreman sink into the dark. He sat still on the saddle, forever
suspicious, his mind grasping at possibilities of chance and error.
The horseman, following the bend of the creek, came impetuously
forward and sighted the blur of the Broken Bit crowd. He was a
hundred feet away when he started calling:</p>

<p>"Grat&mdash;that you? Grat?"</p>

<p>He swept in, the momentum of the pony carrying him half through
the group. "Grat&mdash;the ranch is burnin'! The ranch is goin' to
hell, Grat!"</p>

<p>Red John rushed in. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But the ranch is burnin'. That Keene hit Jesse on
the head and knocked him cold. Then he got away."</p>

<p>Grat DePard swayed in the saddle and in the long silence he
turned slowly old at the thought of his hopes vanishing in
smoke&mdash;at the wreckage of the one thing dear to him; he turned
old and dull and he thought of Keene, and then Keene was the target
of every foiled impulse in Grat DePard's body; he became an
obsession that grew greater and greater to DePard until there was
no other thought that meant anything. When he spoke it was in a
dead, outbreathing sigh: "Red."</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"He'll come back here to the girl. You stay here where you can
watch. When it starts getting daylight, move back to that east
ridge, but keep watchin'. I'm going to the ranch. I'll be back
later." Then he said to the messenger, in faintest hope:
"Everything on fire?"</p>

<p>"She's up in smoke, Grat."</p>

<p>"Ah," groaned DePard. "Be sure you keep watchin', Red. I am
going to get that man. I am going to ride him clear to hell."</p>

<p>He moved on so quickly that he caught the rest of the group
flat-footed. Broken Bit took out after him. Red John stepped from
the saddle and crouched against the earth, prepared for a lonesome
night. He watched the shadowed bulk of Aurora's cabin, a quarter
mile away; and as he watched he began to think of her with a
gradual excitement.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Young Joe Spackman came into the store yard early next morning.
"DePard raided the flats last night. He hit old Cannon on the head.
Cannon's dead."</p>

<p>Aurora had a clear feeling of tragedy, a heart-pulling
compassion for the Cannons; but as she stood in the yard she
realized that the events of the past few weeks had built a fatalism
around her sympathies. She had lost all sense of security, she had
come to expect anything; and nothing&mdash;not even this
news&mdash;shocked her as much as it would have a month before. She
said: "I'll go back with you, Joe," and went to saddle her
pony.</p>

<p>Before she left the yard she locked up the store and the log
cabin. Leaving the store involved a good deal of mental struggle.
Everything she had was here at this spot, every material possession
and every hope, and she had come to feel that if she left it, no
matter for how brief a time, she would lose everything. What
decided her was the call of neighborliness. These homesteaders had
helped her; it was her turn to help them. On the desert it worked
this way. As a sudden afterthought she left a note tacked on the
door for Keene, explaining where she had gone, and then rode over
the lord with young Joe.</p>

<p>"I heard riders come by last night," she said.</p>

<p>"That was them. They cut wire all the way from Comrie's to
here."</p>

<p>"DePard wants to scare us out."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said young Joe, "I guess he does."</p>

<p>He was nineteen, she remembered; an earnest slow-going boy who
would somehow wrest a living from the soil, who would never
complain or grow sour with the hard labor that was his lot, who
would always care for his responsibilities and hope for good to
come. In a way he was typical of the best of these homesteaders in
his patience, in his steadfastness. It took young Joe's kind to
settle the land. Then he looked at her and said: "They got a lot to
answer for&mdash;that Broken Bit outfit," and she realized he had
changed since she had last seen him. He had matured, he had lost
his boyishness.</p>

<p>They rode into the yard and found fifteen or more of the Silver
Bow men gathered there. Comrie, who had Old World manners, stood up
from his seat on the well curb and removed his hat&mdash;an
angular, frosty-browed man with the bluest of eyes. She smiled at
him and went into the house. Homestead women sat around the small
living room, dutifully lending their presence to Mrs. Cannon. Mrs.
Cannon appeared unconscious of them; she swayed steadily back and
forth in a rocker, her hands idle on her lap.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything?" asked Aurora.</p>

<p>"I do guess everything's bein' done for me," said Mrs. Cannon,
but she added, "Aurora, you should come back across the river. You
shouldn't stay there. Nobody can help you, and God knows we'll all
need help enough. What did Cannon ever do to them? DePard did it. I
saw him do it. Don't you stay over there alone anymore."</p>

<p>This room was too crowded. Aurora moved on to the kitchen where
Mrs. Spackman and Mrs. Kilrain were doing the day's cooking. She
talked with them a moment and continued on out to the back yard, to
find Jennie standing alone. "Jennie," she said, "I think young
Joe's looking for you."</p>

<p>"Oh no not me," said Jennie.</p>

<p>That lost and desolate answer puzzled Aurora, for she knew how
close those two had been. Jennie met Aurora's glance and seemed to
shrink away. "I have been a bad girl, and now my daddy is
dead."</p>

<p>Aurora reached forward and pulled Jennie around. "Jennie," she
murmured, shocked and hurt by that blank lifelessness she saw.
Jennie Cannon stood obediently still, her eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>"I would like to die," she said, precise and colorless. "But it
is too late for that now, isn't it? My mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jennie!"</p>

<p>Jennie slipped away from Aurora's arms and walked farther out
from the yard, her hands folded across her breasts; she walked on
and on into the sagebrush obviously not aware of her
surroundings.</p>

<p>Aurora turned around the house and found that another
homesteader, Cal Murchison, had arrived with news. "Broken Bit was
burned last night."</p>

<p>That news stirred the homesteaders and brought half the women
from the house. Spackman said: "How'd it happen?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Murchison, "there was a fight, accordin' to what I
hear. That man Keene went up there and I guess they treated him
pretty rough. He was there when DePard came down here. Jesse
Morspeare was watchin' him and they had a fight. The place
burned."</p>

<p>They were all looking at Aurora. Spackman said: "You know about
that, Aurora?"</p>

<p>"No." The news chilled her. She waited for Murchison to go on
talking and when he didn't add anything she asked: "What happened
to him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Her voice was high in her own ears. "Didn't you hear anything
more?"</p>

<p>Spackman said thoughtfully: "I kind of hoped maybe he would do
something."</p>

<p>Aurora had her moment of irritation, born of worry. "Hasn't he
done something?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Spackman. "Something. But DePard is still against
us." He made a half apology to her. "What should I want him to do?
It is our trouble, not his. But it is natural, I guess, to lean on
a good man. He was. Yet now&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said: "What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>Her voice was still sharp. Spackman rubbed his chin. He reached
for his pipe and nursed it in thought. She saw Kilrain look across
the yard at his wife, and look away. None of the other men had any
desire to speak. Theirs was the indecision of men who, though they
would fight as individuals in ways with which they were familiar,
could not see themselves armed and riding together against DePard.
It went against everything they knew.</p>

<p>Brighthand's wife called: "I'll tell you what we're doing. We're
leaving."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kilrain said, scornfully: "Ah. What a shameful thing to
say!"</p>

<p>Brighthand retorted:&mdash;"What's to be ashamed of? Next time
DePard comes back he'll shoot at the houses. I ain't proud enough
to stand around and see one of my kids get hurt. There's a lot of
land left where a man don't have to take those chances."</p>

<p>Aurora looked at Spackman, knowing him to be more of a fighter.
But now Spackman nursed his pipe in silence. Elijah Patterson said:
"What a shame. No law, no sheriff. Nothing but a man that can do
what he pleases."</p>

<p>"Can he now?" said Kilrain.</p>

<p>"Well, he has."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;he caught us by surprise. But there's a next time.
Or will we be hidin' in the root cellar?"</p>

<p>"Can't be ridin' back and forth all winter, like an army.
There's farmin' or there's fightin'. Can't do both."</p>

<p>"Do one thing first," pointed out Kilrain. "There'll be plenty
of time for farmin' after."</p>

<p>"You think you can face a bunch of gunmen?" asked George
Lacey.</p>

<p>"As for that," said Kilrain, "I'll pick me own spot. When a
man's too heavy for me fists I use a board. There's ways, Lacey.
There's ways."</p>

<p>"We're leavin'," repeated Brighthand.</p>

<p>The hardness of their position was on them all. They sat in
desperate reflection of their injustices, but they were family men
and that responsibility was heavy. All this was going through them,
swaying them and influencing them. Comrie said:</p>

<p>"Aurora, you've got to leave that place. It is the worst spot of
all."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Spackman, "that's right. You want I should take my
team and move you?"</p>

<p>She walked to her pony, stepped to the saddle. "No," she said.
"I'm not leaving."</p>

<p>Comrie cast a sly glance at Spackman; he looked around at the
other men, and at Aurora again. "You're not afraid, Aurora?"</p>

<p>"I can be afraid," she said. "But I'll stay there." She started
from the yard, but turned back. She had something more to say. "If
this man can scare you out here, some other man will scare you out
somewhere else. If you're going to run, you'll always be running.
This is your land, isn't it? These are your houses and fences. All
the work is yours&mdash;a year out of your lives. Where will you go
that's better? What will you say to your children when they want to
know why you don't stay?" She pointed across the river, toward the
hills and toward Broken Bit. "Do you know why that man dares to
raid the flats? Because he believes homesteaders have no courage.
He believes they'll run when he frightens them. And after you're
gone he'll laugh at you and know he's right. Just remember that.
He'll be laughing at you."</p>

<p>She went out of the yard at a run. She hadn't been angry in the
beginning but she was now because she was thinking of Keene, who
had ridden straight at Broken Bit, one man against the outfit. She
remembered the cut of his shoulders against the sunshine and,
riding toward the ford, she had her dark and rising worry. Where
was he now?</p>

<p>Comrie looked around the crowd. He said in a soft, pressing way:
"The girl has got the spunk. Now, for me, I will mend my fence and
I will stay. And if we could find that Keene and he would show us
how to do it properly, for there is a proper method in fighting and
a wrong one, I would do more. I would follow him."</p>

<p>Spackman said: "An idea there, Aleck. Yes, an idea." Mrs.
Kilrain said: "Ye should all be ashamed, waitin' here like geese.
If ye want that man Keene go and find him. And maybe he's needin'
help now, wherever he is."</p>

<p>Elijah Patterson said: "Those are big hills. Who knows here to
look?"</p>

<p>Indecision swayed the group again. Spackman rose, motioning to
his wife and young Joe. "We will see about that," he said, and went
to his rig. He got in the rig and waited for his wife to take her
seat and drove away. Young Joe followed on his horse.</p>

<p>Young Joe let the rig get ahead of him. He rode at a slow walk,
his eyes on the ground and his heart eaten by the despair of
vanished dreams. By turns he was a boy, hating Jennie Cannon for
her unfaithfulness and for the agony she had given him; and by
turns he was a man, catching a faint intimation of a gentler
wisdom. There was need of something in him but he could not
understand the need. The thought of Red John rode with him and it
was that thought which, gouging deeper and deeper into his soul,
hardened him out of his boyhood.</p>

<p>His father was in the shed putting away the buggy horse when
young Joe arrived. Spackman said: "Something is not right with you.
Is it the girl Jennie?"</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>Spackman considered his son, who was half a head taller and
twenty pounds heavier. "A boy makes nice things in his head and
they are just so. But a man knows things are not just so." He
pulled out his pipe and, with his eyes on it, he added: "Mistakes
are mistakes. The hot blood makes many. The cold blood makes none."
He had filled his pipe and he had lighted it. He had a gray
squarecut beard on a ruddy, round beaming face. He was a Hollander
who loved his comfort, who had his convictions and his tolerance.
He said at last: "It comes to me you are a man now," and left the
shed.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE QUARREL</h2>

<p class="first">PORTIA returned to Keene's hideout before
daylight, bringing him food, a frying pan and a coffeepot. She
brought him also one of her father's razors and a cake of soap.
"You're beginning to look like an outlaw with those whiskers," she
remarked, and cooked breakfast while he shaved. It pleased her to
see how much satisfaction he got from the meal; he was a sound man
with no fat on him and his energy compelled an appetite. In
everything he was robust and forward, even in the way he had looked
at her the night before, when she had kissed him. Watching him roll
his after-meal smoke, she realized she was trying in every way she
knew to make herself a part of his life. It troubled her to think
of what might happen to him if he stayed in the country, but it was
unbearably hard to think of his leaving. The truth was, and this
she had decided in the long night hours, she would go with him when
he left, if he asked. If he did not ask&mdash;</p>

<p>He said: "You're a help, Portia."</p>

<p>She was hungry for whatever kindness he could offer. Not that
kindness was enough, but perhaps behind the kindness there was
something else which could be encouraged. She lay back on the
gallery floor, beside the fire. Day had not yet penetrated the
heavy, crystal mists lying in the narrow canyon and a chill
dampness clung to everything so that the fire was a comfort. Keene,
having shaved, looked fresh again. He had slept away his fatigue
and his body once more was controlled by restlessness. For her own
part she was half asleep, having spent most of the night riding to
and from the hideout.</p>

<p>She said: "I guess I've got to get out of here before it is
light. I don't want to give away your hideout. What are you going
to do?"</p>

<p>"Don't know yet."</p>

<p>She sat up. "You might ride over the hill and keep going."</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>She got to her feet, finding it hard to go. Everything moved off
into nothing; she couldn't look ahead. "I'll see you again, Jim?"
She wanted to ask him to stay in this hideout, but she knew his
mind was already alive with his plans. He was the kind of man who
would hate a woman's interference. He was thoroughly independent
and she loved him for it, yet it was hard not to have him need
her.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"Be careful, won't you?" she asked him. Later, because she could
not check her feelings, she added something she really wished she
could have held back. "You know, Jim, it would be tough for me if
anything happened to you."</p>

<p>She went to her horse and got on the saddle. He followed her and
took her hand. She saw the cheerful glint of his eyes, the
half-rash confidence in him. He had a heavy, strong hand and its
pressure passed physically through her. "I'll see you tonight or
tomorrow. Don't come back here, though. I'm moving out."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Just moving around. That's the way
this thing goes. You'd better go to bed. You're just able to keep
your eyes open."</p>

<p>"All right," she said obediently, and had a thought then that
made her secretly embarrassed at herself. She let her hand remain
within his solid grasp, wistfully wishing this moment could be more
than it was and wondering if there ever could be more for her. Then
he pulled his arm away and she rode down the creek.</p>

<p>In the space of the last two nights Indian summer had gone and
winter was here; day broke late somewhere above the cold overcast
of fog. When she came near the mouth of the canyon the dark fog
still covered her but she cut quickly into a right-angle ravine,
crossed it and turned from defile to defile, deliberately confusing
her trail.</p>

<p>Reaching Lost Man Ridge later, she detoured to the edge of
Broken Bit's home quarters and came upon a yard which held no sign
of activity. DePard was out on Keene's trail and never would leave
that trail. Better than most people she knew DePard's capacity for
hatred, his thirst for breaking down opposition. Observing the
charred and still-smoking ruins of the ranch house&mdash;only the
barn remaining&mdash;she knew that this one thing would drag up all
his killing instincts.</p>

<p>She cut back toward her own house, alert to trouble in the half
daylight of the timber. At home she went upstairs and pulled a
quilt over her and slept soundly until the middle of the afternoon.
Her father was somewhere in the hills and most of the crew was
gone; but, eating a quick lunch in the kitchen, she heard the story
of DePard's raid on the homesteaders from the cook. The news had
traveled fast. At once she saddled a fresh horse and started for
Cleve Stewart's ranch; she found him in the middle of the
valley.</p>

<p>He had been beyond the pass, he told her, and had found nothing
and now was headed for Aurora's. "She ought to know something about
him."</p>

<p>"Ah, Cleve," she said, "I'm the one you should ask," and told
him where she had been.</p>

<p>"What's he going to do now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "He'll never get out of this alive. I wish I
knew what I could do to help him."</p>

<p>"I guess we both wish that, Cleve. I guess I wish it more than
you." Then she added the news of the Silver Bow raid. Cleve
Stewart's instant reaction was to throw his horse into a gallop.
"I've got to get Aurora out of that store. DePard will watch it.
He'll expect Keene to go there."</p>

<p>"I told Keene you'd already taken Aurora to your place," she
confessed. When he looked at her in surprise, she added
defensively: "I know it was a lie. But that's why I said it. I
didn't want him to come back into the valley."</p>

<p>They ran down the valley underneath a cold, silver-misted
sunlight. Stewart, she thought, was one of those men who had never
been born to be tough. He had too much sentiment in him, too much
honesty; he wore his feelings on his sleeve. Even though he tried
to play the hard game of the country he lacked that iron core and
that temper which, in self-defense, could be as thoroughly cruel.
Those qualities belonged to Keene and though in some respects Keene
was less fine a character than Stewart, neither as truly civilized
nor as gently considerate, he was far more the whole and natural
man. In this world of dust and action and raw force he fitted
perfectly. She drew one more sharp distinction between those two.
Always Cleve Stewart would possess understanding and would defer to
a woman's wishes. Keene would take what he wanted, but his smile
and his strong man-quality would always justify him in a woman's
eyes.</p>

<p>She said: "You like her a lot, don't you, Cleve?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "A lot."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck," she sighed. In another few moments they were
in Aurora's yard.</p>

<p>Aurora had seen them coming and now stood waiting in the yard.
Portia, prying into this girl's every reaction, saw her black
worry, her shadowed fear. Still, it was odd to Portia that with all
this strain on her Aurora could stand so composed and keep her
voice so calm.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about him? I heard about the fire and the
fight. But do you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's over in the Short Hills," said Portia, close to being
blunt. "I found a hideout for him. I took him breakfast this
morning. He's all right."</p>

<p>Aurora's eyes clung to Portia; they were gray and they held
everything she felt away from Portia and Stewart. She showed no
relief, she showed nothing. All she said was, "I'm glad." It was a
coldness or a repression Portia could not, from her own warm heart,
possibly understand. It built up her resentment; from that moment
onward she disliked Aurora Brant.</p>

<p>Cleve said: "Now, Aurora, you've got to leave here. You've got
to move to my place. You know what's happened across the
river."</p>

<p>"I know," said Aurora. Portia, absorbing every shred of
sentiment on the other girl's cheeks, saw the arrival of
stubbornness. "But I'm not leaving," Aurora added.</p>

<p>Stewart spoke with concerned irritation. "I can't protect you
here."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Cleve."</p>

<p>Portia, who had a will and a tongue of her own, used them now.
"You're not the only one on this desert. If somebody comes here and
hurts you, then Cleve's got to take care of you. Don't make it hard
on him."</p>

<p>"I'm not asking any favors," answered Aurora. She dropped her
eyes and her voice faded to a drawn murmur: "If you knew&mdash;No,
I'll stay. I'm sorry, Cleve."</p>

<p>"Look," said Portia. "This is the first place Jim will ride for.
Because you're here. DePard knows that and he'll watch this place.
You better go with Cleve."</p>

<p>Aurora gave Portia a half-angered look. "Why didn't you say so?
If that's the way it is, I'll go. But how can you tell Jim I'm not
here? How can you tell him to stay away?"</p>

<p>"I can find him."</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart blurted out, "I thought you already told Jim that
Aurora was at my place, Portia."</p>

<p>Portia murmured, "Oh, you fool, Cleve." She faced Aurora. "Now
you won't go."</p>

<p>"No," said Aurora coolly, "it isn't necessary now."</p>

<p>Stewart realized his error too late. He flung up his arms and
turned off. "All right," he said, "if you won't, you won't. Come
on, Portia."</p>

<p>Aurora called after the other girl. "Would you mind staying a
minute?"</p>

<p>Portia swung around. "That," she said with some degree of venom,
"is exactly what I'd like to do. Go on, Cleve. I'll see you
later."</p>

<p>Cleve cast one puzzled backward glance at the two women and
struck out toward Skull Ridge. Portia stepped from her horse. She
moved around it, ready for a quarrel and half disposed to make
one.</p>

<p>"Why did you tell Jim that?" asked Aurora.</p>

<p>"To keep him from riding down here and getting shot. Don't you
know DePard will comb this country clean until he gets Jim? You
don't know DePard. You don't know him at all. Remember, he killed
Garratt, who lived here last. I'd bet a hat he's got somebody over
on the ridge watching us now."</p>

<p>Aurora said, briefly polite: "Thoughtful of you to warn Jim. But
what made you think he'd be so anxious to get back here? After all,
I think he would see the trap and not walk into it."</p>

<p>"The smartest of men are betrayed by their weaknesses."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" murmured Aurora.</p>

<p>"He'd come back to you."</p>

<p>"Is that a weakness?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Portia, "love is everything and anything. To Cleve
Stewart it would be a strength, making him do things he'd never
otherwise have the courage to do. But to Jim it would be a weakness
because, knowing better, he would still come here."</p>

<p>"We are not talking about love," said Aurora, softly speaking
across a distance growing greater and greater between them.</p>

<p>Portia watched this girl whose reserve was like a wall. Her own
impetuous and outgiving nature was increasingly challenged by
Aurora Brant's consistent refusal to reveal what she really felt.
To Portia the rules of conduct were very plain. If she felt a thing
she spoke of it; needing a thing, she sought it. If she could not
capture what she wanted she would surrender to it and possess it
anyhow. Therefore Aurora Brant's unwillingness to display emotion
was to Portia Crews the mirror of a cold nature. Keene deserved a
better woman than that.</p>

<p>"He worried about you," she said. "It was the first thing he
wanted to know&mdash;if you were safe. You mean something to him. A
man never stops halfway. If Keene wants you a little he'll soon
want you a lot."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He's gone from the hideout by now." Then, wanting
to break Aurora Brant's reserve, she added: "I brought him his
breakfast. I cooked it for him."</p>

<p>She saw that it went home. Aurora Brant held herself straight.
Her pride, her willful self-containment, grew more obvious. All she
said was: "It is nice to know he wasn't badly hurt."</p>

<p>"He ought to leave the country entirely," pointed out
Portia.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what he ought to do."</p>

<p>"If you loved him and he wanted you to ride away with him, would
you go?"</p>

<p>"We were not talking of love," repeated Aurora.</p>

<p>"Would you?"</p>

<p>"Why should you keep on talking of that?"</p>

<p>"I'd go, if he asked," said Portia.</p>

<p>She had not expected this to rouse Aurora. It was only something
she had to say. But the dark girl's broad lips forgot their
pressed-in firmness and her eyes showed the release of a temper
long confined. A real feeling showed through her; it quickened her
words. "If you can give up everything you believe in and everything
you have ever wanted to follow a man whenever he wants to
go&mdash;and if that man's star is his star and never
yours&mdash;go ahead. I can't. A man should find contentment in a
woman. She should be enough to hold him still. If she isn't enough,
all talk of love is foolish."</p>

<p>"A man like Jim Keene has his ways. You can't change them."</p>

<p>"And I have mine and will not change."</p>

<p>"Then," said Portia in a swift break of voice, "why don't you
let him go?"</p>

<p>An expression of astonishment showed on Aurora's face. "I'm not
holding him."</p>

<p>"Yes you are!" cried Portia. "A woman can smile at a man and
make him believe anything. You want him but you won't give up your
own wishes. You look at him and he sees a promise there, and that
holds him. But you never mean to keep it. If you're so proud of
yourself, don't cheat by letting him expect something you don't
intend to give. If he's not worth following then you're not worth
having."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Aurora.</p>

<p>"You want a hired hand for husband," retorted Portia. "A man to
fill the woodbox and haul water and sleep in the barn. You're
afraid to be human&mdash;and you don't deserve a man." She turned
to her horse and stepped to the saddle. Her cheeks were richly red,
she was angry clear through. Anger heightened the restless,
gambling spirit she lived by; it made her beautiful.</p>

<p>Aurora said: "I wish you luck, Portia."</p>

<p>"Luck for what?"</p>

<p>"For what you so clearly want," said Aurora, and watched Portia
Crews leave the yard at a sudden run. She kept her eyes on the
ranch girl until the latter had rejoined Cleve Stewart in the
valley. The two of them quartered toward Skull Ridge and at last
disappeared.</p>

<p>Aurora moved slowly across the yard. She picked up an empty
bucket and carried it to the washstand in front of the store; she
stood by the stand, her energy taken out of her by Portia Crews's
flaming honesty. The little world she had so painfully built up
since her father's death, the small hopes she had nourished, the
scattered pieces of courage she had collected, all lay strewn
around her. Portia had done that.</p>

<p>For Portia was right. It was courage she lacked. Perhaps she had
smiled at Keene and permitted him to be encouraged. She moved into
the log cabin and faced the wall. She touched her forehead to the
wall and felt tears run warmly down her face. Portia Crews thought
her cold. How could Portia know what really was in her
heart&mdash;the terrible dread of again living from pillar to post,
the emptiness of owning nothing and having no help? How could
Portia, whose life had been pleasant and prosperous, realize the
depth of her longing for one secure spot on the earth? Portia was a
girl who had always taken what she wanted from life. How could
Portia ever feel the loneliness of being a shadow behind a man, as
she had been with her father&mdash;suppressing every desire to his
will? Aurora cried slowly and steadily, making almost no sound.
Nobody would ever know that, behind her coldness, many dreams lived
in starved hope, that she had her own desperate wish for love. This
was her greatest problem and her greatest fear, this inner war
between the warmth of her heart which wanted so much and could give
so much, and the burnt-child need to be a person with a place in
life. She was not really cold. The coldness was her
defense&mdash;so that she would never surrender her own fresh-won
dignity as a self-sustaining individual.</p>

<p>She took a towel from the wall, dried her face, and walked
around the yard. Suddenly the sun, all day obscured by a sparkling
argent mist, dropped over the western ridge. Darkness moved in. She
cooked her dinner and ate it without appetite and was again uneasy,
thinking of Keene and worried about him. There was nothing for her
to do and not much to plan for as long as the desert remained a
battleground.</p>

<p>The temptation was strong on her to ride to Spackman's. She was
that unbearably lonely. But by now the reaction set in from her
crying and she pulled herself together, rebuilding her resolution.
She would not cry again, she would never ask for help; and when she
saw Keene she would not mislead him with her smile or with her
words. When this affair was done, and if he were alive, the old
spirit would make him restless and he would move down the trail.
She would not follow.</p>

<p>There was the high, sighing sound of a developing east wind in
the sky. On the wings of the wind came a fine, chill rain. Suddenly
all around her the smell of wet dust rose, cloying and wet-pungent
after the long summer's dry spell. The prairie was lost in a
smothering darkness and she had to grope her way across the cabin
to the lamp. She lighted the lamp and filled the stove. The fire
was a comfort, the beat of the rain on the cabin broke the terrible
suspense of the desert silence. She thought of Keene riding through
this dismal weather, she felt the coldness of it for him.</p>

<p>She remembered she had not brought her washing in from the line
by the shed. Taking up a coat, she threw it over her head and
opened the door. She closed the door behind her and for a moment
was motionless, adjusting herself to the intense darkness of the
night. Turning, she moved forward&mdash;into the sudden closing
arms of a man.</p>

<p>She screamed out her shock, hearing the man grit his teeth. He
said,&mdash;and it was DePard's voice,&mdash;"My God, woman, cut
that out!" She fought him, kicking his legs with her feet and
twisting in his grip. She could not get free. DePard called: "Get
her horse, Red. Get her gun from the house."</p>

<p>She threw her weight against him and carried him across the
yard. He tripped himself on the chopping block and went down,
pulling her with him. "Len," he yelled, "come help me! She's
wilder'n hell!"</p>

<p>She struck his face with her head time and again; she threw her
knees into his stomach. A man ran out of the blackness and seized
her around the waist and throat and hauled her upright. She was
half strangled by the pressure of his arm. DePard spoke at her with
an irritated reasonableness:</p>

<p>"Stop it&mdash;stop it. You're safe enough. Not doing a thing to
you&mdash;not going to. Just moving you out of here. Red&mdash;got
that horse?"</p>

<p>Red John moved up with the horse. She saw his face come toward
her, long and inexpressive. DePard called: "Len&mdash;upset the
chair and table in there. Make it look like she had a fight. Keene
will see that when he comes along. What I want is for him to follow
us." Then he said to Aurora: "He'll hunt for you, won't he, sister?
He likes you that much, don't he?"</p>

<p>She didn't answer. Rain came beating down against her face and a
man's arms held her tight-caught. It was Red John who drawled:
"Sure he'll follow."</p>

<p>"That's what I want," said DePard coolly. "Now, sister, you want
to take anything? You got a heavy coat?"</p>

<p>There were five or six shadows moving around the yard. Another
man came up, grumbling: "She dropped this," and handed her coat to
DePard.</p>

<p>She said: "Where do you want me to go?"</p>

<p>"Don't bother yourself about it. We'll take you. It's a line
cabin up on Lost Man. Look now. Get on the horse and don't fight.
What's the use of that? I'm not doing a thing&mdash;don't plan on
it at all. You'll be there a day or a couple days and then you can
ride away. That's the whole thing. You going to get on the
horse?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Let her go, Snap."</p>

<p>The wind came down from the sky in one boisterous, chilling
sweep; great balls of tumbleweed were rolling shadows in the yard.
The darkness was a solid wall all around. When Snap's arms dropped
away she had one wild impulse to run but other riders came in and
surrounded her and she realized they were waiting for just such a
thing. She took the coat from DePard and slid into it. She
breathed, "All right," and went to her pony, climbing to the
saddle. DePard said again: "I'm telling you&mdash;you're as safe
with me as if you was in church."</p>

<p>She pulled the coat collar around her neck, wishing for a hat.
Water began to drip through her hair and the wind, striking that
wetness, set up a quick cold ache in her head. Broken Bit's men had
mounted. DePard moved beside her; they rode out of the yard,
heading east. She heard him say in his close, satisfied voice:
"You're the honey which draws the bear, sister."</p>

<p>They crossed the flat and rose to the timber. She was in a
darkness that had no outer limit, Broken Bit riding a trail that
wound and lifted and seemed to swing north. She tried to keep her
sense of direction sharpened but presently it was as if she had
been whirled around in a lightless chamber, the four quarters of
the world blurring. Above her the wind cried in the branch tops and
occasionally a pine limb snapped like a gunshot and dropped near at
hand. She heard a voice say: "Early for snow, but it'll come
tonight."</p>

<p>It was perhaps an hour later when they made a last turn and
stopped. DePard said: "Get down," and took her arm. A door hinge
squeaked and, under DePard's guidance, she stepped into the cold,
close air of a cabin. She stood still, hearing men move around her.
DePard spoke through the darkness to one of those men. "Get the
fire going. You stay with the girl. I'll be back by early morning.
Keene won't pick up the trail until then&mdash;but keep your eyes
peeled."</p>

<p>He went out and presently Aurora heard horses move away and the
dying murmur of voices. When those sounds fell off there was
nothing left but the gusty rattle of rain on the cabin roof and the
steady slash of wind in the trees. For a moment she thought she was
alone, and then she heard a man's boots scuff around the room and
stop. A match bloomed in the black, traveling down toward a table
and a lantern on it. She watched that man's hands close around the
lantern; she saw the pack of cards on the table; the cribbage board
and an empty tobacco can. Light swelled from the lantern wick and
afterwards she saw Red John.</p>

<p>He stood by the table, tall and redheaded and silently watching
her. The florid coloring of his face deepened and his glance clung
to her with a thoroughly interested expression. Long welts ran
diagonally across one cheek&mdash;the imprint of her
fingers&mdash;and when he saw that she noticed them he brought up
his hand, half covering the scratches, and a recurring excitement
made its smoky fire in his eyes. Wind poured through the open
doorway. He moved around her, kicking the door shut with his boot.
He said: "Starting to sleet already. I'll get that fire goin'."</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; HEART OF NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">YOUNG Joe Spackman that night reached the end of
his painful thoughts and knew there would never be any rest for him
until he met Red John. He was at supper when this occurred to him.
He finished his meal and left the table and the room. Night had
come to the Silver Bow and rain moved out of the crystal mists,
turning from fine dew to solid buckshot pellets driven slantwise by
the rising wind. He saddled his horse and got his Winchester from
the porch rack; and was in the saddle when his father came to the
shed.</p>

<p>His father was in some respects a stranger to Joe&mdash;as every
man is to his son&mdash;and young Joe remained silent, not knowing
how to explain his intentions. But he needed no explanations. Old
Spackman had followed his boy's misery through the week and
perfectly read his mind. It was, for the elder, a hard moment. This
was his only son, still immature in many ways and now riding into
actual danger. Yet if he kept the boy back it would be as bad, for
then young Joe would always have the sense of his own failure in
his mind. So Spackman only said: "Riding?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said young Joe.</p>

<p>"Ride careful then."</p>

<p>"All right," said young Joe and went away. Wind beat out of the
south and east. At the pitch-dark ford he heard the slash of the
rain on the river's surface and the slap of small wind-driven waves
against the bank. He took his way over the ford very carefully,
using Aurora Brant's cabin light as a beacon. He was not more than
two hundred feet from the store when he heard her scream.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to race in, but young as he was Joe
Spackman had absorbed much of the sly sharp reasoning of the
country, much of the instinctive caution. So he moved quietly
forward and saw the vague shapes in the yard and&mdash;arriving at
the back of the store&mdash;he heard men talking. Stationed here he
guessed what was happening and suppressed the impulse to use his
gun; it was impossible to do that with Aurora in the center of the
men. Afterwards he saw all of the group move away to the east; and
when they had disappeared young Joe set out after them, maintaining
his distance.</p>

<p>Sheltered by the noisy beat of the rain and by the darkness, he
followed them toward Lost Man Ridge and up the side of the ridge
into timber. Now he moved closer, no longer seeing the shadows they
made but following the one main trail and still catching the rumor
of their travel. A man's voice drifted back faintly, the wind
boiled through the trees, and the trail seemed to bend and fall
downhill. Knowing nothing of the ridge, he let his horse have its
way until he realized the sound of Broken Bit was gone. He kicked
the horse into a faster pace. At the end of ten minutes he knew he
had lost them completely.</p>

<p>Perhaps if he waited for daylight he might pick up the Broken
Bit trail, though that meant more skill in following tracks than he
possessed. He might cross the valley to Stewart's ranch. But
Stewart was a cattleman and young Joe distrusted him. There was,
then, one other thing left. Turning about, he retraced his path to
the flats and headed for the ford. He knew his own people best. He
would tell them that Aurora was gone&mdash;and they would help. He
would ride to Comrie's first and work back until he reached his
father. At this moment the rain was hardening into sleet.</p>

<p>After Portia Crews left the hideout Keene moved to the edge of
the creek, watching daylight crawl into the canyon's narrow-black
slash. In the upper gorge, to his right, he heard the steady rumble
of a waterfall and realized there was no exit in that direction.
This spot was a trap. Moreover the smoke of his fire drifted upward
and put a scent in the air which some traveling Broken Bit man
would sooner or later catch.</p>

<p>He saddled the pony, watching its warm breath turn to steam in
the raw air. He crouched by the fire, soaking in the heat against
the cold ride to come: and at last mounted and followed the creek
downgrade. As soon as he left the canyon behind he turned back
against the ridge and climbed toward its crest, through brush
discharging its wetness against him and beneath the clinging
blackness of timber. Beyond the timber he came out upon an open
summit and from this point caught incomplete glimpses of the land
around him.</p>

<p>Sunlight still seemed to shine upon the Silver Bow, twenty miles
southward. Elsewhere and all through these hills stormy clouds
steadily moved and a misting rain began to close in like
silver-gray wool. Below him the broken ravines had turned to rivers
of pale fog. To the north stood the main mountain chain; to the
west lay Broken Bit somewhere. In that direction he made out the
Broken Bit wagon road and now saw three riders moving along it,
small-figured by the darkness and the distance.</p>

<p>He slid into the brush, descending the ridge until he struck a
trail that seemed not to have been recently used. This he used,
aiming at the Thunderheads before him, his purpose now being to
reach the highest possible ground and put pursuit below him. DePard
would have his riders out in this sullen day, blocking trails and
watching all the gaps.</p>

<p>This was Morspeare's horse, and Morspeare's slicker was rolled
behind the cantle. He untied the slicker and worked into it. Rain
made crystal bubbles against it; rain dripped off his hat. Wind
grew wilder, pushing great slate-colored clouds over the main
mountain peaks from the south-east; those clouds boiled against the
mountain peaks and broke apart, rain turning steady and solid. Cold
bore against Keene, whipping bright red color into his cheeks.
Steam rose rankly from the pony. He watched the trail with a
centered, nerved-up attention; he raked the side coverts of the
timber. Around the middle of the morning he came upon the Broken
Bit road and stopped a long while to watch it; and then ran across
rapidly.</p>

<p>The massive shoulder of the Thunderheads faced him, too rough
and abrupt to be traveled except by the existing trails. He reached
a trail and saw upon it the clear-cut prints of a horse's hoofs, so
recently made that rain had not yet dulled the crisp edges. That
traveler was not more than ten minutes ahead of him, somewhere
beyond the short and constantly turning bends.</p>

<p>At each bend, Keene hugged the inner edge and drifted cautiously
around. Pines crowded him right and left and in the deeper heart of
the hills was a rain-glittering semidarkness. Five hundred feet
upward he shoved himself into the brush and looked down upon the
Broken Bit road; and saw a pair of riders coming out of the east,
along the road. They went on rapidly toward DePard's ranch and were
soon lost to sight, but it occurred to Keene then that his own
recent passage of that road would have been spotted by any Broken
Bit man posted on the higher hill points.</p>

<p>He turned into the trail again, rapidly climbing, more and more
alert to the side timber. Beyond another bend he saw a long
straightaway climb before him; coming to the summit of this
straightaway he reached a hillside meadow covered by gray, waving
grass. There was a cabin in the meadow; to the far side of the
meadow the mountain slope rose again.</p>

<p>The trail ran across the meadow. Keene refused it, turned right
and skirted the meadow. The timber sheltered him until he reached
the meadow's far end. At that point he faced a short alley of grass
lying between him and yonder trees; this was no more than ten feet
wide and Keene went immediately across.</p>

<p>As he did so Jesse Morspeare, doggedly stationed at the far edge
of the meadow, caught that one fugitive glimpse of him. Morspeare
reached for his Winchester and flung it to his shoulder. Before he
got his sights leveled on Keene the latter was out of sight.
Morspeare lowered the gun across his saddle. He wiped the back of a
wet hand against a wet face, swearing at himself; and he sat still,
his slow mind picturing the country into which Keene had faded, the
trails Keene would have to follow, and at last he moved westward as
fast as the timber would permit him. Reaching a trail he went along
it at a gallop, traveling abreast Keene and intending to get ahead
of him.</p>

<p>It was nearing noon. This bench continued west, the higher peaks
to Keene's left, the lower canyon in which lay Broken Bit to his
right. Wherever trails crossed he made a wide circle through the
trees, stopped to watch the timber around him, and went across the
trail at a fast trot. Above him the sky was a silver-and-black
overcast out of which a thickening rain continued to fall, not far
from sleet. The day's edge grew rougher and sharper and wind
slashed through the pines, drowning out lesser sounds. Beyond noon
Keene sighted Broken Bit below him. Now descending the slope to a
pine thicket he left his horse, crawled forward to a screen of
brush and made a peephole in it.</p>

<p>There were only the barn, a corral, and the blackened square of
the burned houses in the Broken Bit yard. A cookstove sat in the
open area, smoke wheeling crazily around the Chinaman who stolidly
crouched by it. Four riders showed themselves at the barn door; one
more rider came in from the timber a little later, ate dinner and
rode out again. Cramped and uncomfortable and made hungry by the
sight of men eating, Keene waited out the gray, fitful day. Beyond
four o'clock DePard arrived with five of his crew.</p>

<p>They clustered around the stove while they ate. Afterwards
DePard moved his arms in a slow circle, pointing at the hills. Red
John came up talking to DePard and presently Keene saw men mount
and ride separately into the timber. DePard, with Red John and four
other Broken Bit hands, swung down the gap toward the open valley.
They reached the valley floor and turned to the south, growing
vague in the rain mists.</p>

<p>Crouched in the dripping brush, Keene was thinking of what next
should be done. Since early morning he had known how the ending to
all this would be. Hunted by DePard, he had himself turned hunter.
It was the old game again&mdash;its pattern thoroughly familiar to
him. He proposed to keep DePard in sight, to feint and run through
the timber and show himself when necessary, thereby shifting
pursuit until at last he had pulled DePard apart from the rest of
the Broken Bit outfit. Somewhere and sometime in these hills he
would catch DePard on even terms. That was the way the play went.
Cool and without illusions, he foresaw that meeting&mdash;and had
foreseen it since his first meeting with DePard. The course of his
life ran like this; he was this kind of a man, born to trouble.
Peace for him, he reflected, was a dream of gold, beautiful and
unreachable; for he knew himself at last. Wherever he saw women
crying and little men troubled, there he would be. Some fire in him
always flared hot at the sight of cruelty.</p>

<p>He rose to stamp out the stiffness of his legs. The trail from
Broken Bit was twenty yards distant in the timber and now he heard
a pair of riders come upgrade, their horses grunting at the climb
and one man grumbling. In a little while the wind carried these
sounds away. Keene stood by his horse, watching the premature
shadows of night shift through the trees. He was thinking close and
swift of DePard's latest journeying, trying to fathom its reason.
In the direction DePard now traveled would be the homesteaders on
the Silver Bow and Aurora's store. And, he also remembered, Cleve
Stewart's ranch was across that valley in Skull Ridge. DePard would
be thinking of one of those places.</p>

<p>DePard's group, meanwhile, had vanished beyond the rain mists.
It was still too light to follow DePard directly; but by
backtracking to the head of the valley he could cross the pass and
reach timber again and sweep down on the west edge of the valley
under the cover of darkness, parallel to DePard. It was important
to keep on DePard's trail. Climbing to the saddle, he turned
upgrade through the trees and around five o'clock came to the
pass.</p>

<p>He was at the edge of the pass trough, sheltered by timber and
looking down at the hundred-yard open strip. Somewhere, along one
edge or another of the pass, Broken Bit men would be watching; it
was one place they could reasonably expect him to show himself. Yet
now the sleetlike rain and the heavier clouds had brought along a
false night and the trees across the pass were nothing more than a
dark blur; if men were watching they could not see far. With that
in mind he touched a spur to his horse and drove it out of the
timber.</p>

<p>The slope carried him down to the floor of the pass and now for
the first time he felt the tension of his long day; it pulled at
his nerves and made him look behind with the full expectancy of
seeing riders break out of the darkness after him. But he saw
nothing and, squaring himself in the saddle, he ran up the farther
incline and rushed into the trees.</p>

<p>There was some kind of path before him and this he used for a
short distance until the falling darkness made travel too slow;
swinging to the right he came out of the timber at the head of the
valley and saw full night close down. When he dropped into the
valley one round soft snowflake struck his cheek. He was at a
steady run, with the shadow of the Skull Ridge close at his left
elbow, and presently he recognized a road in the darkness and
turned on it, entering the ridge. Half a mile along that road he
picked up the lights of a ranch house&mdash;Stewart's he
believed&mdash;and drifted into the yard. Dogs came out of the yard
in full cry and presently a door opened and he saw Stewart blocked
against the light. Stewart said: "Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Get out of that light," said Keene, and dropped from the
horse.</p>

<p>"My God, Keene&mdash;come in here!"</p>

<p>Keene passed through the doorway and heard Stewart slam it
behind him. He had been cold since morning and now the warmth of
the room began to burn on his ears and cheek points. The light
struck him full in the face, its brightness blinding him. He heard
the gathering storm shoulder against the house.</p>

<p>Stewart said: "You're all right?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Where's Aurora?"</p>

<p>He waited for an answer. Not hearing it he turned about and
discovered the odd look on Stewart's face. Stewart said with the
greatest reluctance, "Down at the store."<br></p>
<br>

<p>Big Jesse Morspeare stood at the east edge of the pass,
patiently waiting. He had his eyes turned toward the summit of the
pass and so it was not until Keene was half across the clearing
that Jesse caught that motion in the corner of his eyes. Jesse
flung up his gun and made another try at the elusive target; and
there was one touch-and-go moment when he thought he had Keene in
the sights. But the distance was bad and the light simply faded
from the earth and then Keene was gone. Big Jesse laid the gun over
his saddle, once more figuring ahead of Keene. "I was right about
him comin' here," he thought. "I think I'll be right next time,
too."</p>

<p>He shoved out from the timber and entered the pass. Instead of
going into the farther trees he moved southward toward the valley.
When he came to its floor he settled to an alternate run and
walk.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Keene said: "Didn't you bring her here?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Stewart, "she wouldn't come." Keene stood in the
middle of the room, water dripping along his slicker and puddling
at his feet. The thawing warmth made a red flame on his cheeks; the
violent flash of temper brightened his eyes. "By God, Stewart," he
said, "I thought you had better sense."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," interposed Stewart, astonished by this kind of
talk. "She wouldn't come."</p>

<p>"That makes no difference. You know what's happening. You know
she's got no business being out there alone."</p>

<p>"I told her that. She wouldn't come."</p>

<p>"Cleve," rapped out Keene, "you should have brought her."</p>

<p>"Oh now," said Cleve Stewart, nettled by the other man's manner,
"I couldn't drag her away against her will."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you? Why the hell couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Stewart, "I guess that's the difference between you
and me."</p>

<p>"Maybe it is," said Keene and turned about to find Portia Crews
standing in the kitchen doorway.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I lied to you, Jim. Otherwise you would have
gone straight to the store. DePard expected you to do it."</p>

<p>"Fine," he murmured. "You left her where DePard would find her.
He's on his way there now."</p>

<p>Stewart said in a kind of groaning misery: "You sure of that,
Jim?"</p>

<p>"I saw them."</p>

<p>Portia turned into the kitchen. Stewart said: "We got to get
down there, Jim. I'm going to the bunkhouse and talk to the crew."
He left the house.</p>

<p>Keene went into the kitchen and stood at the warm range while
Portia poured coffee from a big pot simmering at the back of the
stove. She handed him the cup, her eyes blackened by her thoughts.
"Now," she murmured, "you really hate me."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "but you should have thought."</p>

<p>"I did, Jim. I did. I thought of you."</p>

<p>"You should have thought of her."</p>

<p>She said: "That's never the way. A man thinks of a woman. A
woman always thinks of a man. Nothing will happen to her. You're
the one DePard wants to kill." She turned from him and looked into
the kitchen cupboards. She found a platter of cold meat and got
bread out of a box. "I think you must be hungry."</p>

<p>He made a meal from the bread and meat; and burnt his tongue on
the coffee. It took the chill out of him. Portia saw his haste, his
impatience&mdash;and knew what was in his head. He had a slanting,
angular wickedness on his face. His anger stayed and his worry
increased. She murmured: "You could break almost anybody's heart. I
wish you didn't hate me."</p>

<p>"I don't, Portia."</p>

<p>"Ah, you might just as well." She made an expressive gesture of
resignation with her hands. In the room's lamplight her lips were
soft, her face showed its childlike sadness. "I could never be very
cold. Perhaps it would be better for me if I were. I'm pretty easy
to read, aren't I?"</p>

<p>He said: "You're a hard woman to know."</p>

<p>"Me?" she answered in astonishment. "Why, Jim&mdash;look at me!
What do you see?"</p>

<p>Stewart came into the kitchen from the yard; and now he was
angry and helpless. "I'm going to fire that crew tomorrow. They
won't go along. That," he added bitterly, "is what a man gets for
being considerate. They think I'm soft and they tell me to go to
hell. They won't buck DePard. I'm going with you, Jim. Let's
move."</p>

<p>He caught up his heavy coat from a chair in the front room and
went into the driving dark. Keene moved to the front room, Portia
Crews behind him. He saw an extra Winchester in the room's gunrack
and reached for it; he was at the door when Portia's voice turned
him.</p>

<p>She said: "What do you want me to do, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Stay here," he said. "Don't cross the valley tonight. There's a
real storm coming up."</p>

<p>She came to him and reached out to button his slicker. She
showed one brief flash of hope. "Would it worry you if I were out
there? Would it really?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it would."</p>

<p>"Ah," she sighed and was pleased, with the shine of wetness in
her eyes. "Then you should know why I lied&mdash;because I'm
worried when you are out there. Why should I be hard for you to
know? All you need to do&mdash;" She stopped the explanation. She
held it back and shrugged her shoulders. "Well, be careful. I'll
see you soon."</p>

<p>She stood in the blast of wind and wet snow coming through the
doorway, watching the shadows of the two men dissolve in the
blackness; and closed the door. Wind cut a shrill sound at the
eaves of the house, wind shouldered heavily at the walls. She moved
idly around the room, restless because alone and cast down
immeasurably by Keene's departure. She said aloud. "It would have
done no good to have told him what I felt. If I could only be cold,
if I could only be indifferent, and make him come after me and
break his heart. He wants nothing easy. But how can I be that
way?"</p>

<p>She stopped in the room's center, listening into the steady,
increasing pound of the storm. Great wet flakes splattered against
the windows and slid slowly down; and in a little while, unable to
be alone, she put on her coat and went out to the shed for her
horse. She turned down the road, came upon the valley and headed
westward across the three-mile flat to her own house in Lost Man.
The full sweep of the wind was against her, the thickening smother
of snow. She felt her horse drifting from the wind's pressure and
now and again turned it into the weather. Ordinarily she would have
seen the lights of her house over the valley but tonight there was
no visibility at all. She had no fear; she had lived here all her
life and had never known fear of anything. Traveling steadily
onward, she was swallowed by the night.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Keene said: "Get out in the middle of the valley and catch the
creek. We'll follow it down."</p>

<p>Stewart called: "Go slow, Jim. If DePard's in front of
us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;go on. We're late."</p>

<p>Swinging across the valley, they reached the creek and put their
backs to the biter drive of the storm. Snow packed against Keene's
collar and the heat of his body melted it and water ran along his
shoulders and down his arms. The horses, boosted by the wind, ran
at a steady gait. An hour from Stewart's ranch Cleve said something
that was ripped away by the wind; he lifted his voice to a half
cry: "Should see a light pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Not in this," said Keene.</p>

<p>"Wait!" howled Cleve and hauled in. Keene ran beyond him before
stopping and when he turned back he saw nothing in the mealy
flitter of snow. It was that black, that solid. He held his horse
broadside to the wind until Stewart bumped into him. They swung
together, Keene discovering the faint glint of light ahead. He bent
on the saddle, speaking close to Stewart's ears. "Circle to the
left."</p>

<p>They had the light for a definite guide. They swung around the
light until the corner of Aurora's shed cut it off. They wheeled
back a few feet and caught the light again, and drifted slowly to
the shed. Keene said: "Wait," and got down.</p>

<p>He moved into the shed, expecting to find Aurora's
pony&mdash;and discovered it gone. He moved out of the shed,
crawling along the store wall. Light sparkled through the
snow-fogged window of the main cabin. Keene stood beyond that
outthrown fan of light, distrusting it. He retreated farther from
it, walking deeper into the yard. Twenty feet from the window he
tried to catch a view through it, unsuccessfully. He circled the
yard and closed again on the cabin. Tight against the wall, he put
his ear to the logs; and then, turned impatient, he reached for the
latch and lifted it.</p>

<p>Wind threw back the door. He had one half view of the room
before the lamp blew out. He yelled: "Cleve!" when he stepped into
the room. He ran against an upturned table, against a fallen chair.
Stewart ran in, slamming the door. "What's up?"</p>

<p>Keene scratched a match on the floor and found the lamp, and
lighted it. He made one complete wheeling turn of the room. The
table and chair had been tipped over, but the thing his mind
closely played on was the location of the lamp. It had been placed
on an empty soapbox in the corner. Somebody had taken it from the
table&mdash;where it normally would have been&mdash;and put it on
the soapbox before the table was tipped. The bed was smooth. The
stove held only a little heat. He pulled back a stove lid and saw
the gleam of a single coal in the ashes.</p>

<p>He swung from the stove and Stewart observed then how changed
this man was. He had never seen this consuming fire before in
Keene; he had never seen that complete destructiveness. "There you
are," said Keene, his talk gritting into the noisy night. "God damn
a man&mdash;!" He whipped a hand across the lamp chimney, killing
the light. He was across to the door in a long jump, throwing the
door open. "We get out of here," he said, and moved into the
darkness. Stewart found him on the edge of the log wall. "It may be
a trick," said Keene.</p>

<p>Stewart moved away from Keene, hearing the other man's swift
challenge. "Where you going?"</p>

<p>"Over to Spackman's. She might be there. Wait for me."</p>

<p>Keene paced through the yard's blackness again. He pushed
against the arriving wind; he bent his shoulders to it. A hundred
feet or more from the cabin&mdash;which was now lost in the blur of
the storm&mdash;he cut to the right and crisscrossed the yard. He
came against the woodpile and skirted it. Back at the cabin he made
another wide-angled slant into the desert, circled the store
entirely and reached the shed. None of these trips told him
anything except that the yard was empty. He stood in the shed a
good fifteen minutes before returning to the cabin. Lighting the
lamp he made a thorough search of the cabin and found nothing
informative. Nor was there anything in the storeroom when he passed
into it from the main cabin. Out in the yard again, he heard Cleve
hail him from the deeper darkness. Cleve arrived on the run.</p>

<p>"Joe Spackman came here tonight. He heard Aurora scream. There
was a bunch of men. They took her toward Lost Man. Joe followed. He
got too far away from them and took the wrong trail. He went back
and told his dad. They're getting up a bunch of the homesteaders
now."</p>

<p>Keene said: "What's up in those trees? Any place to stop?"</p>

<p>Stewart searched his memory. "A line cabin would be nearest.
Then there's Bowley's abandoned house. Nothing else until you get
to what's left of the old army post, twelve miles into the Short
Hills."</p>

<p>Keene went to his horse and came back to Stewart. "Try the cabin
first."</p>

<p>When they turned south-east the night was solid with a
slant-driven snow that rattled against Keene's slicker like
buckshot and bitterly stung his cheek flesh. The wind swept down
the long fifteen-mile slot of the valley with a pressure hard to
beat against. The horses yawed from it, they had to be constantly
turned into it. Ten minutes away from the store Keene called:</p>

<p>"More to the right."</p>

<p>"No," shouted Stewart, "the mouth of the trail ought to be right
ahead."</p>

<p>Keene swung the course, shoving Stewart's horse southward. It
was a faith in his own sense of direction which made him do it; in
this blind night that sense was as clear a guide as the bright
north star. He remembered, too, that the east ridge fed a low spur
into the valley quite near the trail, and when the pony lifted
beneath him he knew he was on the edge of that spur. Stewart
complained: "We're south of it!" Keene moved on, feeling the ridge
move against him, hearing the racket of the wind in the nearing
timber. He went steadily upslope and gave his horse its head; this
was Jesse Morspeare's horse and familiar with the country. In
another minute's time Keene had passed into the trail, the enormous
pressure of the wind sheered off by the trees.</p>

<p>"All right," admitted Stewart. "You guessed it. There's a fork
in this trail about a half a mile on. Take the right."</p>

<p>The wind was a wild, smashing racket in the pine tops. Branches
tore away and dropped down. Keene kept a slight rein pressure on
the left side of the horse's neck, so that it would swing to the
right when it reached the fork of the trail. Sometime later he
realized he was being carried due south and knew the horse had
passed the fork.</p>

<p>Stewart called: "That cabin's on the left. Mile beyond the split
in the trail."</p>

<p>Keene had come up this trail once before, on the way to
DePard's. He remembered the cabin and the small clearing in which
it sat&mdash;a low log cabin with a door and no window. He traveled
at a walk through a kind of blackness that had weight; it was a
tangible substance he pushed his shoulders through. The wind came
at him in contradictory crosscurrents, blizzard-cold. Stewart
called up from the rear, the words not penetrating Keene's mind;
for he was thinking now of Aurora with a nerve-breaking anxiety and
his thoughts brought her before him as a bright picture in the
dark&mdash;the curve of her lips, the adopted willfulness which
held her shoulders up, the pride of her eyes burning like a steady
candle flame in a still room. Sometimes he had caught the hint of
warmth and loneliness, of a generosity waiting for a man; sometimes
she had looked at him across the wall of an unbreakable
resolution.</p>

<p>Alone of all people, Aurora Brant had brought to him the only
real doubt he had ever had&mdash;the doubt of his own future. Her
quiet, long-dreaming glance made a mirror for him and in that
mirror he saw himself and was disturbed by what he saw, the
restlessness that drove him, the love of excitement, the wish to
ride on and on, the search that kept him in motion and seemed to
have no end. When all this was over he would ride away as he had
always done; but this time he would be leaving something behind. It
had never happened before. Even now some of the fun had gone.</p>

<p>Wind steadied against him, blowing through one fixed channel in
the hills; he caught the smell of smoke in the turbulent air. He
had reached a clearing; now paused on the trail, he saw the faint
hulk of a cabin in the solid night. Stewart was beside him,
whispering: "Somebody in there. Smell smoke."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Keene, and slid from the horse.</p>

<p>He moved toward the cabin, his feet sinking through a surface of
half snow and half slush. He was at the wall, with his head against
it as he listened for inner sounds, but all he caught was the sing
of the wind against the trees. He moved around the house, looking
for horses. He came back to the front of the line cabin. Stewart
was near the door.</p>

<p>"I'm going in there, Jim."</p>

<p>Keene said: "Stick against the wall." He ran his hand down the
door surface until he caught the latch. He lifted it and kicked
open the door. He was inside, wheeling back to a wall. He said:
"Aurora," and put his shoulders against the wall and waited, his
revolver drawn and half lifted.</p>

<p>All he heard was the gusty wind against the cabin, the rattle of
the stovepipe. One eye of fire showed in the stove, fanned bright
by the fresh air scouring through the doorway. The room was warm.
He held his gun up against the darkness, he stood stiff as iron,
listening until he could no longer wait. He slid a hand into his
pocket and brought out a match. He ripped the match across the wall
and watched its light flare through an empty cabin.</p>

<p>Cleve came in on the jump. Keene said: "Go outside and keep your
eyes peeled. Something wrong here." Cleve Stewart retreated,
pulling the door shut. Keene lighted another match and found the
lantern. The lantern globe was still warm when he touched it, the
smell of coal oil was strong. He swung the lantern slowly around,
noting the puddled water on the floor&mdash;from somebody's feet. A
double-deck bunk frame stood in one corner of the room, both bunks
covered by straw ticks; there was nothing on the ticks. Turning
back, he look at the table again and saw a woman's
handkerchief.</p>

<p>For a moment longer his glance swept this room from wall to
wall, from corner to corner. Then he killed the lantern. Cleve
Stewart opened the door.</p>

<p>"She's been here," said Keene. "She left a handkerchief."</p>

<p>Stewart's strain poured out as a long, ragged sigh. "You know,
Jim, they only had one reason for taking her. To pull you into a
trap. This must have been the trap. Then they changed their minds.
What'd they do that for?"</p>

<p>"Something's wrong."</p>

<p>"Maybe they went on to Broken Bit."</p>

<p>"Too far to go on a night like this."</p>

<p>"Lige Bowley's old house then. Or the abandoned military
post."</p>

<p>"We'll try the house first."</p>

<p>They got back on the trail. Stewart took the lead, calling back,
"I know this pretty well."</p>

<p>The momentary warmth of the cabin had thawed Keene's chilled
bones; now the coldness cut in again, more cruel than before. He
called up, "Get along, Stewart&mdash;get along." The sins of men
were many; in one form or another he had witnessed evil in all its
grades, so that there was in him little capacity for surprise, no
room at all for shock. He was neither surprised nor shocked now;
what grew in him was a bitterness that would never have an ending
until he met DePard. It heated him and boiled away all
compassion.</p>

<p>They rode into a full-blowing blizzard, all the upper world
screaming with it. At every aperture snow whirled down. Keene's
pony sank into forming drifts; the pony's mane collected snow and
slowly froze into solid hanks. Judging from the heat in the line
cabin, Aurora could not have left it long before; therefore she was
somewhere near, she was perhaps now riding ahead of him at no great
distance. He called again, "Get going&mdash;get going."</p>

<p>Stewart said at last: "Here's the turnoff to the Bowley place.
It's downgrade a half mile."</p>

<p>They stopped. Keene said: "What else around here?"</p>

<p>"The military post is six miles over in the rough country."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't try it. Too far tonight."</p>

<p>"Well, there's the Crews ranch. Not so far. But they wouldn't go
there."</p>

<p>"Might if it got too tough." Then he said: "Possible that they'd
try to get on to Broken Bit. That would be foolish but maybe they'd
try it. This is too tough to be out in. If they're on this trail
they're not much ahead of us. I'm going down to that Bowley place.
You go to Crews's. If I don't find anything I'll come along to
Crews. You stay there until I meet you. Don't break in on that
ranch. Slide up and have a look first."</p>

<p>"What would you do if you ran into DePard at Bowley's?"</p>

<p>"Not more than one or two men with Aurora in the line cabin.
Probably no more than that with her now&mdash;if she's at Bowley's.
Meet you at Crews's."</p>

<p>Stewart called after him: "Damned easy to get lost tonight,
Jim."</p>

<p>"I know where the house is," said Keene. "I passed it once."</p>

<p>The main trail had followed the ridge crest: this side trail
dropped quickly, still crowded by pines. Presently the wind reached
at him more forcefully and the racket of the night grew in his
face. He came out of the trail into a flat open meadow which he
felt rather than saw; he cut across the meadow and drifted against
the shadow of a house; and now as before he circled the house and
identified the opaque shadow of a barn.</p>

<p>He left his horse and moved against the back-sloping wall of the
barn and came to a broad doorway. Pieces of the doorway teetered
under his feet as he passed in; and at once he touched the head of
a horse. The horse let out a startled blast and retreated. Keene
stood dead still, baffled by the cell of blackness. He heard the
horse step around and stop; there were no other inner sounds. He
murmured: "Easy&mdash;easy," and moved on touching the horse again.
He ran his hand along the cheek strap and felt the cold glass
surface of the head stall ornament, immediately recognizing this as
Aurora's bridle. He cruised through the darkness from corner to
corner; but this was the only horse. Knowing that, he turned from
the barn, struck broken house steps and reached forward until he
found a door. He tried the door, softly turning a knob and feeling
it give. He lifted his gun, steadied himself on the steps and went
through the doorway at a jump.</p>

<p>The noise of his entry clacked onward into cold emptiness; he
heard the echo die somewhere in distant rooms, he said:
"Aurora."</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, in a faraway, exhausted voice.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THINGS SAID AND
UNSAID</h2>

<p class="first">HE moved over the room and stopped. He said:
"You're alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Yes."</p>

<p>He heard her walking rapidly through a room. She struck a corner
and cried softly to herself and stumbled on. Going forward, he met
her in a narrow hall. He came against her and felt her arms slide
around him, quick and hard. She was shaking. She started to speak
to him but the words stuck in her throat. He spoke&mdash;and was
afraid of what he would hear. "Nothing happened?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He said: "How'd you get here? You were at the line cabin."</p>

<p>"They left me there with Red John. But he changed his mind and
we came here. Then he left."</p>

<p>He said again: "Nothing happened, Aurora?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no. Don't think of that."</p>

<p>"It's all I've been thinking of. How long's Red been gone?"</p>

<p>"Not long. He said something funny to me, and left."</p>

<p>The excitement and the chill had broken into her reserve. She
clung to him, trembling and pulling herself straight, and trembling
again. He said: "Maybe there's a stove."</p>

<p>"I looked. There isn't anything."</p>

<p>He said: "I'll get the blankets from the saddles." Then he
realized how close she was to exhaustion and loss of control. She
tightened her grip on his neck and said, "Don't leave, Jim."</p>

<p>"Just out to the barn."</p>

<p>He stood still, waiting for her to let go and trying to find
some line of reasoning which would explain Red John's departure.
The foreman, he figured, might be somewhere in the neighborhood,
expecting pursuit. He might have ridden for Broken Bit, knowing the
girl could not leave this house in the storm. Wherever he was, he'd
be back by daylight. Meanwhile the blizzard blocked departure. This
was the only shelter.</p>

<p>She said, "All right, Jim," and dropped her arms. But she
followed him to the door and remained there. He went across the
yard, pulling his pony into the barn and unsaddling it. He
unsaddled Aurora's horse as well, took the two blankets and moved
around the barn and stumbled against a small pile of hay in one
corner. He tried a match and caught a glimpse of a loft above;
dropping the blankets he found a piece of a ladder leading to the
loft. He climbed the ladder and tried a second match. There was a
mound of gray, old hay in the loft.</p>

<p>He went down the ladder, returning to the house. She waited for
him at the open door, badly shaken by the wind. She caught his arm,
murmuring: "I'm sorry, Jim. I've had about all I can stand, I
guess."</p>

<p>"Found a bed," he told her and led her across to the stable. He
searched for the ladder, he put her against it. "Climb up," he
said. He went away from the ladder, hunting the blankets he had
dropped; he got them, hearing her call from the loft. "All right. I
made it."</p>

<p>He went up the ladder and tried a match&mdash;catching one short
glimpse of the girl's deadwhite face, the burned blackness of her
eyes. The match went out. Wind cried along the roof and wind went
all through the broken boards of the barn. Keene dug into the heart
of the old hay in the loft and pulled her down. He took off his
slicker and boots. He settled beside her, drawing the blankets and
the slicker over them. He reached up and stirred the hay until they
were buried in it. Her arms closed around him, her face was close
to him, and the first real warmth since leaving the line cabin
loosened him&mdash;the joined warmth of their bodies. Something
went clattering across the roof; all the aged timbers of the barn
swayed slowly, not far from collapse. She had ceased to tremble;
when she spoke her lips brushed his cheek.</p>

<p>"I was deadly afraid of him. He came to the store a couple
nights ago. That was unpleasant. Tonight he came back with DePard
and some others. They took me to the line cabin. DePard said it was
to make you follow me&mdash;he kept saying that. Then he went away
with the other men, leaving me with Red John. DePard was to come
back in the morning. But then a strange thing happened. Red John
started the fire and I saw him get worried. He looked at me and I
think he was more afraid of me than I was of him. That was queer,
because he had always been so sure of himself. But he said
something about he being the man in trouble, not you. Then we left
the cabin and came here. I think he was afraid he might be trapped
here. It was a terrible ride. When we got in the house I heard him
walking around it&mdash;just walking around and talking to himself.
Then he said another strange thing. He told me to remember he
hadn't touched me. He wanted me to be sure to remember that. Then
he left&mdash;and here you are."</p>

<p>He was silent, trying to fathom the foreman's motives. It was
difficult to understand what had swung Red John so quickly, so
definitely.</p>

<p>She said: "You're still in trouble, Jim. Red John will tell
DePard where I am. They'll be back, they'll find you. That's what
DePard meant to do."</p>

<p>"Not tonight," he said. "Nobody goes anywhere tonight."</p>

<p>"But in the morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A long way off."</p>

<p>He heard her long, softening sigh. "How little it takes to be
happy. I was afraid of him, then I was cold&mdash;and then I was
alone in the house. All that wildness. Now I'm warm, and that makes
me happy. It doesn't take much. That's your life, isn't it, Jim? A
lot of trouble&mdash;and little things to make you pleased."</p>

<p>He said: "You've had a hell of a time."</p>

<p>"The harder life is," she murmured, "the less people ask of it.
People who don't know fear or hunger or pain want a lot. Those that
face those things are happy if they have one small break. Terror
makes us all very humble. How quick pride falls."</p>

<p>"Warm now?"</p>

<p>"And content," she said, gently. "Hear that wind. The blackest
and bitterest of worlds is ten feet beyond us. It would kill us.
But we are warm. Perhaps everything is really that simple." Then
she added in a dark, troubled way, "No, not that simple. There's
tomorrow, and DePard."</p>

<p>"A long way off."</p>

<p>"You never worry about the future, do you?"</p>

<p>"No use. All things come in time."</p>

<p>"So, then," she said, "it is today you love. Yesterday's gone
and tomorrow isn't here&mdash;and it is just today that counts.</p>

<p>"Best that way," he answered. "Feels fine to eat when you're
hungry, to watch the ground turn color when the sun goes down.
Maybe to smell water when you're thirsty, or see lights shining
over the flats when you're tired of riding. If you look too far
ahead you miss what goes on now. You never stop to enjoy the
present."</p>

<p>"But pretty soon the present is gone and then you are old and
alone and what do you have?"</p>

<p>"That comes too," he admitted. "For me and for you, for
everybody. Makes no difference, does it? The thing is, what can you
look back on when you're old? What can you remember?"</p>

<p>"You're strange, Jim. You really believe that. But it isn't
so&mdash;for you. You want something and you look for something.
Over the hill. Tomorrow."</p>

<p>After a long silence he said: "I guess I do."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>In his voice was the note of small surprise and odd wonder. "I
don't know," he said.</p>

<p>She had asked him that question before, only a few days after
first meeting him. His answer then had been the same as it was now.
She remembered that he had added one other thing. She spoke of it
now.</p>

<p>"But you'll know, when you find it?"</p>

<p>He lay still, her sweetness and fragrance close upon him, the
weight of her arm on his shoulder. Her breathing blew gently
against his cheeks; her lips moved, very near him. She whispered,
"I'm afraid again. Tomorrow is never as far away as you think. I'm
really afraid." In the beginning he had put his arms around her to
take the chill from her body; now since she lay content and warm
the need of it was gone, and what had been a natural and necessary
act suddenly turned into something else. Within his arms was a
woman and all the disturbance she could bring to a man&mdash;her
beauty, her reliant will, the dreaming and lonely things which lay
beyond her eyes, the impetuous moods suppressed but crying up
through silence.</p>

<p>He drew his arms away. He heard her say: "What is it?" He held
his arms still but he dropped his head forward, his mouth coming
against her lips. Her arms were at his shoulders, still-placed.
They pulled gently at his shoulders until some warning passed
between them, and then she quietly repelled him. Her heartbeat was
against his hands, strong and quick. She turned her head. She said:
"Little pleasures, just for today. If that's a memory to look back
on, Jim, I don't begrudge it. But you mustn't fool yourself. You're
no man to be content with memories. You're going to be lonely after
you cross the last hill."</p>

<p>"So will you, Aurora."</p>

<p>"There's a difference. I am more patient than you are." She
brought her arms away and turned from him. "Good night."</p>

<p>He didn't answer. Presently she said in a gentle curiosity,
"What is it now?"</p>

<p>"Thinking."</p>

<p>She reached back and took his arm, and pulled it over her. She
held his hand. "Don't think," she murmured. "What good is
that?"</p>

<p>One of the horses rubbed along the lower wall, the wind slammed
steadily against the barn. Aurora's hand, holding to his, was warm
and relaxed: she seemed to fall immediately asleep. This girl, he
thought, had taken the heart out of him in more ways than she would
ever realize. She revived old doubts; somehow she had made his life
less important. He put the thought aside, considering DePard and
Red John. He went slowly back over the night, trying to figure Red
John; and at last thought he knew what had been in the man's mind.
There was no other crime in all the frontier category as serious as
that of troubling a woman. If DePard ever lost his battle and
Broken Bit could no longer protect its men, Red John was
finished.</p>

<p>He slept briefly, awakened by the shift of Aurora's body. He
said: "Awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you have to stay at the ford?"</p>

<p>"That's my home. That's my last stand."</p>

<p>"Big world, Aurora."</p>

<p>"I've seen enough of it."</p>

<p>He said thoughtfully: "Sure. I've seen a lot of places I liked
well enough to stay in. Never stayed, though."</p>

<p>"And never will. You're like my father." She put her hand on his
shoulder and held it there; and again he fell asleep.</p>

<p>He had always been a man to wake at the first signal of
daylight. Now when he opened his eyes he found Aurora kneeling
beside him. Light came through all the apertures of the barn,
cold-gray; the wind had slackened. Her cheeks were vivid red and
hair lay loose around her temples. She had been watching him, she
had been waiting for him to rouse; on her face was a sober, sadder
thoughtfulness that vanished at once, to be replaced by a
smile.</p>

<p>"Jim," she murmured, "when you grow old and speak to your
children of your adventures leave this night out."</p>

<p>"Don't seem to see children in the plan."</p>

<p>"There'll be some woman," she said, "who'll gladly follow you
wherever you want to go. But anyhow, I took your advice for one
night. Today's pleasures for today. That's happiness. Now
what?"</p>

<p>They went down the ladder. A long drift had blown through the
barn doorway, crowding the horses into a corner. Outside the world
was still and white, the tree limbs sagging with snow's weight.
There was a half-wind in the air and the sky was gray, as though
the storm had only incompletely blown itself out. Snow still fell.
"Slow traveling," he remarked. "The trails will be two feet
deep."</p>

<p>He saddled and helped her up. "This is the way it is. The Crews
ranch is nearest. If I were certain it was safe for you I'd take
you there, but it is hard to know what we'd find there. That leaves
Stewart's across the valley. Or I'll take you to Spackman's."</p>

<p>"You can't show yourself in the open, Jim."</p>

<p>He moved from the barn doorway, quickly motioning her to pull
aside. Short crisp echoes of a horse treading through drifts came
forward; in a little while he saw Cleve Stewart appear on the
meadow. Keene went into the yard. Stewart said: "You found
her?"</p>

<p>"She's here."</p>

<p>Stewart groaned his relief. "My God. Now we've got to move.
DePard's around here. I saw tracks up on the trail." As soon as
Aurora came from the barn he called: "You all right, Aurora?"</p>

<p>Keene said: "Everything proper at Crews's?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You take her there," said Keene. "Keep off the big trail."</p>

<p>"Where you going?"</p>

<p>"That way," said Keene, pointing indefinitely toward the east.
He was on his horse. "Get going," he said.</p>

<p>Aurora looked at him, troubled and silent. Stewart turned back
into the meadow, calling, "Come on, Aurora. We're in a hurry."</p>

<p>She followed after Stewart. Beyond the house she turned in the
saddle, as though to speak to Keene, and then she pulled the horse
about and rode to him. She said, "Jim, do you have to&mdash;" and
looked down at her hands. "Well," she murmured, "you started this
habit." She lifted her eyes and she swayed in the saddle, offering
her face to him; he bent over to kiss her, feeling the stir of her
lips. She looked at him with the darkest, saddest glance and said:
"I'll be at Crews's, or at the store. I wish&mdash;I wish I knew
where you'd be." She wheeled and ran the pony after Stewart. Just
before she entered the trail she waved at him; and then
disappeared.</p>

<p>The morning was dull and biting and would get no better. He
swung about, heading for the Short Hills country to the
east&mdash;in that general direction where lay the canyon hideout.
He bucked a trail through timber, saying to himself: "Leaving
tracks a yard broad," and fell into an open meadow between rolling
buttes. Aiming toward the slope on the far side of the meadow he
heard a distant echo, thin and flat. He jerked upright in the
saddle, sweeping all the open areas. To his right, near the Broken
Bit road, he saw three men in motion. Two of them came toward him.
The other was racing back into the timber.</p>

<p>Keene swung about into the trees he had so recently left.
DePard, he realized, had him spotted and now would hang to his
plain trail.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; MAN-HUNT</h2>

<p class="first">COMING up from the Bowley house with Aurora,
Stewart reached the crest of the ridge and discovered that some
other rider had meanwhile passed along the main trail, headed in
the direction of Broken Bit. Those tracks were deep-punched in the
snow. "They're all through this country&mdash;DePard's crowd," he
said. "We'll cut through the trees."</p>

<p>He left the trail to break a makeshift path through the pines.
At places snow lay in drifts breast-high to the horses; in other
areas the ground showed black beneath a thin crust. A mile more or
less from the Bowley house both Aurora and Cleve were arrested by
the sound of a single shot clacking along the dismal gray world.
Aurora turned her pony around, crying out in the sharpest voice:
"Do you think&mdash;! Cleve, let's go back there!"</p>

<p>He saw the heart-squeezing fear in her eyes and then took his
glance from her, grumbling, "I've got to get you to Crews's." They
moved on. Five long minutes later he broke the silence with his
irritated observation. "This is his fun, isn't it? He's the fellow
who rode into it. Nobody asked him to. The big man that eats
trouble for breakfast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cleve!" He rode doggedly ahead until she spoke again, and more
gently: "Look at me, Cleve." He turned, showing her the blended
worry and anger on his face. Her soft question took all the sting
from her other words. "What's wrong, Cleve? You don't really mean
that."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I guess I don't." He rode with his head down,
lost within himself, and when she saw that she had her quick
contrast of the two men. Stewart took the world hard, he was at war
with himself, he seemed always to face life with confused
reflections. Keene was so unlike that. Were he riding in Stewart's
place every sense in him would be sharp-focused, he would be alive
to the day and the things it contained.</p>

<p>Cleve said: "What happened to you, Aurora?"</p>

<p>She told him the story of the previous night. He rode steadily
into the timber, bucking the drifts, searching out the passable
alleys. He rode stiffly, with his shoulders flung up; color stained
the back of his neck. He said, more to himself than to her: "Red
John. The world's gone wrong&mdash;and it's Red John."</p>

<p>After an hour's hard riding they came to the lip of a meadow and
found the Crews ranch below them. Snow fell soft and steady; steam
rose from the warm roof of the ranch house. A dog sounded from the
far part of the yard and a man came from the barn with a rifle half
lifted. Cleve wigwagged at him and passed on to the house. Portia
Crews waited at the doorway; a moment later they were inside the
house.</p>

<p>But Cleve Stewart remained by the door. "Well," he said, "I'll
see you later."</p>

<p>Portia Crews asked: "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "I am a damned fool and I'm going back to find
Keene."</p>

<p>"Cleve," said Portia, "do you think you should?"</p>

<p>"What you mean to say," he answered with a touched pride, "is
can I take care of myself? I don't know. It will be interesting to
find out. Things like that get in a man's head. You would suppose a
sound education in the classics might shed some light on human
behavior. I find it sheds no light at all on me. There is an end to
the Socratic dialogue at last. It never was much good. The
important thing, really, is to know if you can stand up and be shot
at without making too much out of it."</p>

<p>"Cleve," said Portia, "don't go."</p>

<p>"Does it make any difference at all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Portia.</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured Stewart with an ironic fragment of a smile on his
mouth, "that's nice to know. Makes a man seem very masculine." He
turned his eyes to Aurora, the smile disappearing. "What would you
say?"</p>

<p>"I had hoped you'd help him," she answered.</p>

<p>It made him thoughtful. He stood tall before the two women, now
again drawn into himself: a man who would always be gentle and
never thoroughly acclimated to this life he had chosen.</p>

<p>"Of course you would," he said, and added. "So long," and left
the room.</p>

<p>"How much he has changed," murmured Portia, as much to herself
as to Aurora. "When he finds he has courage it will please him. But
if he should kill anybody to prove it, that will make him very
sad." Then she said: "You're hungry and you want to clean up. You
can use that room in the corner."</p>

<p>After Aurora had gone into the room Portia called at the
kitchen: "Ed, cook up a breakfast." Standing at a window she
watched Cleve Stewart fade beyond the snow and thought of Keene
with all her mind and felt his troubles with all her heart. As soon
as Aurora came from the bedroom. Portia took her to the kitchen.
She sat across from Aurora, distant and critical and harboring her
resentments. She could never like Aurora.</p>

<p>She said: "How was it?" and listened to Aurora's story. Then she
said, "Red John's chickens have come home to roost. He always was a
lady's man&mdash;but he had to have a sure thing, no danger in it
to him. Now he's in danger and he knows it. Somebody will kill him
for what he's done to you."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose Cleve went back?"</p>

<p>Aurora said: "Oh, I wish I'd known!"</p>

<p>"Why? To stop him? You can always start a man on something.
That's any woman's gift. But you can't stop him. His pride gets up
and there's nothing to be done. Why regret? You ought to be proud
he's doing it for you. I'd be. It's lonesome not to be wanted."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"How can you know?" retorted Portia. She gave Aurora a close,
inquisitive look. "Wasn't it very cold at Bowley's last night?"</p>

<p>"We slept in some old hay in the barn loft."</p>

<p>"I see," murmured Portia and guessed the rest of it with a
fertile, jealous imagination. The picture grew on her until she
rose from the table and walked on to a window; it was an unbearable
picture. For that one night, for that closeness, she would have
given all she possessed. She grew hard and bitter, she was taunted
by her imagination; she hated what she suspected. She said:</p>

<p>"For so cool and unapproachable a woman you have done very
well."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," was Aurora's even answer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps!" cried Portia, coming back from the window. "Why set
yourself up to a man as being too distant and pure to be touched?
No woman's like that. You're not."</p>

<p>"No," said Aurora, "I'm not."</p>

<p>"Then why lie to him?"</p>

<p>Aurora said, very slow with her admission, "He knows what I
am."</p>

<p>That answer tore deep into Portia Crews, it was fresh fuel to
her jealousy. "Does he? Then why didn't you stay with him? All this
trouble comes from you. That's why he's fighting DePard. But you
have left him."</p>

<p>"I'd be in his way. I'd hold him back."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't leave him."</p>

<p>"I know," said Aurora and rose from the table. She went into the
living room, Portia Crews coming after her. Standing by a window,
Aurora saw the Crews meadow dip downgrade to the edge of Cloud
Valley. Snow was a cottony screen shutting out sight of Skull Ridge
three miles across the valley; the wind moved in slow and steady
tempo. She said: "How far is it to the ford?"</p>

<p>"Seven miles."</p>

<p>"I think I'll go."</p>

<p>Portia said: "You've caused trouble enough."</p>

<p>"They won't catch me off-guard again."</p>

<p>"DePard's men are all around."</p>

<p>"If you'll lend me a gun&mdash;"</p>

<p>Portia said: "How can that store mean so much to you?"</p>

<p>Aurora turned about. "Didn't I tell you once? It's all I have.
You don't know about that. You've never had to want anything very
hard. You've always gotten what you wanted. I have lived in a
hundred places, but none of them were mine. I have never known what
it was like to be really safe and secure. The store is
mine&mdash;it means everything."</p>

<p>"How can it mean more than a man?" insisted Portia. Hope
brightened her and revived her interest. "Is it because he won't
stay in one place?"</p>

<p>"He never will. If you want to give up every friend and every
old thing you have lived with, if you want to follow him until you
can't remember what last week's room looked like, if there's never
any end to anything and never any chance of stopping, it you stand
in some room, like now, wondering where he is and when he'll be
back, if that's what you want, go ahead. Follow him."</p>

<p>"I would."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't."</p>

<p>Portia came near Aurora, facing her. She showed Aurora a soft,
excited prettiness. She was anxious eager, aroused by new hope.
"But suppose he stayed here. Would you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"He won't stay," said Aurora in a small, tired tone. "Could I
have my horse? Could you lend me a gun?"</p>

<p>Portia opened the door and yelled over the yard. "Bill, get
Aurora Brant's horse." She walked across the room, into another,
and returned with a Winchester which she handed to Aurora. The two
of them waited in strained silence, full of speech but not
speaking. A man came out of the snow and left Aurora's horse at the
porch; he went back into the snowfall.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Aurora. "I wish we could be friends. But that's
never possible since we are what we are."</p>

<p>"I don't think you like me any more than I like you," stated
Portia. "The truth is you don't love him. Everything he's doing for
you means nothing. Last night&mdash;" the cruel feeling of that
possibility showed in Portia's eyes&mdash;"last night he kept you
warm. And what did you tell him then? Were you truthful with him?
Probably not. You took his warmth and it meant nothing. Of course I
don't like you!"</p>

<p>"Goodbye," said Aurora and left the house. She stepped to the
saddle, put the Winchester across her lap and rode downgrade. At
the edge of the valley she looked back at the house now dim-shaped
in the snow. In another hundred yards she was in a gray-white lost
world, only the vague, black margin of the east ridge guiding her.
As she traveled she thought of many things she wished she had told
Portia; they were hot words rehearsed in her mind, they were angry
and passionate answers. She was near crying, torn by a sudden
uncontrolled rebellion at her own silence. She hated the impression
she had left with Portia and in her mind was the recurring phrase:
"I'm not like that. I'm the kind of a woman she is. But I can't
ever afford to be that kind."</p>

<p>The three Broken Bit men, Long George and Len Teal and Snap,
came out of the timber and sighted Keene in the open ground beyond
the Bowley house. Long George clawed for his rifle and took a
chance shot. Keene faded back into the trees, whereupon Long George
said: "Here we go." Len Teal murmured: "Better be careful how we
chase after that fellow," but obediently followed.</p>

<p>Snap called: "I'll go tell Grat," turning away. He reached the
east-west road and found DePard a mile along it: DePard came on
rapidly, summoned by Long George's shot. He had Red John and all
seven of the other Broken Bit riders with him.</p>

<p>"He just came out of Bowley's old place," called Snap. "He's in
those trees now."</p>

<p>"Alone?" asked Red John.</p>

<p>"Saw nobody with him."</p>

<p>DePard made a quick motion with his hand, slicing his party in
half. Snap wheeled back with four of DePard's men. DePard sat hard
and angry on the saddle. He stared at his foreman, not admiring Red
John at all. "So he rode up the trail last night and got to
Bowley's. You condemned fool, you'd had him if you'd stuck where I
told you."</p>

<p>"Grat." said Red John, turned to pale fury by the words, "don't
talk to me like that."</p>

<p>"You had him. You got cold feet and ran."</p>

<p>"I wasn't afraid of him," yelled Red John. He slapped his hand
hard down on his leg. "Don't tell me that! Not of him and not of
you. Not of any man alive! Don't talk to me like that!"</p>

<p>"You're a woman chaser," said DePard. "Never knew a chaser that
wasn't soft as putty. What'd you run for?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you stay with her?" shouted Red John. "You took her
from the store. I didn't. If we ever get caught you're the man that
dragged a woman into the hills, not me. You think I'm sucker enough
to get stuck with that?"</p>

<p>"First I ever heard of your bein' worried about a woman."</p>

<p>"I know when to stop," said Red John. "I got sense. You don't
catch me getting hung for woman-grabbin'. There's a lot of things a
man can get by with. But that's one thing he don't talk himself out
of if he's caught."</p>

<p>"Red," said DePard, "take these boys and go straight down the
Lost Man trail. Pinch in toward the Bowley house and don't make any
racket about it. You'd better see you get this Keene or maybe
you'll get hung yet."</p>

<p>"I didn't take her," flashed out the foreman.</p>

<p>"Red," DePard warned him, "don't throw off on me. I'm the man
you got to watch out for. Don't worry about anybody else. Get
along."</p>

<p>He watched Red and the two remaining hands swing into the
timber; he listened to the grunting of their horses until the sound
died, and thereafter he followed Snap's trail. One more rifle echo
swelled through the steady fall of snow. He said,
"Fine&mdash;fine," and gritted his big teeth together and plunged
ahead.</p>

<p>Red John led his party up the slope of the ridge to the trail;
he went along this main way until he reached the intersection of
the trail leading west to Crews's. Deep holes showed the passage of
a recent rider outbound from Crews's. Continuing forward, he came
to the trail which slanted downhill to the Bowley place. All this
area was chopped by previous riding and he stopped again, not sure
of what had happened. Aurora, he believed, had gone back to
Crews's; and it looked like somebody had gone with her. Not Keene,
who was somewhere below, but another rider.</p>

<p>He was on the defensive from that moment, realizing other people
now knew of his part in this night's business; it would be a story
all over the flats within eight hours. He thought to himself: "I
told her it wasn't my idea. She knows it." But he was rooted to the
snow, full of fear and not knowing what next to do.</p>

<p>"You fellows go on down there," he said finally. "DePard's
probably reached the Bowley place by now. There's somebody else
floatin' around up here. I got to find out."</p>

<p>They dropped downslope away from him, disappearing around a
bend. In that direction, farther off than the Bowley house and
farther to the left, another small cold thin echo broke. Red John
put his hands on the horn, dead-centered and thoroughly unable to
come to a decision with himself. For when he fully realized how
damning a story Aurora Brant would tell of him, he was seized by
the paralyzing foresight of his own fate. This fear had come on him
in the line cabin the night before. Watching Aurora, he had seen
himself in her eyes, he had at last caught the enormity of his act.
Fear had never left him since. Whether or not DePard won the battle
with Keene and the homesteaders, the answer was still the same.
There would always be somebody on the Silver Bow waiting for him.
He was marked.</p>

<p>When he came to review the reputation he had the picture grew
blacker and blacker. He thought of all the women he had known. They
made a ring around him and they were smiling at him, mocking him
and watching him slowly shrivel. Their laughter was a heartless,
distant chiming. He groaned aloud and a stinging sensation crawled
along his skin and then he knew he had to leave the country at the
earliest moment. He was through here.</p>

<p>Seized by a terrible, unsettling need of haste, he muttered to
himself, "Maybe it's too late," and the loneliest feeling in the
world belonged to him now&mdash;the feeling of being
hunted&mdash;and every corridor in the timber turned black and full
of risk and for the first time in his life he lost confidence. "Got
to get out of here," he sighed. His breathing worked deeper into
his chest; he dragged in air and found it insufficient. He thought
of the pass which, because of its elevation, would now be deep in
snow. He thought of the valley lying westward, too open a stretch
to risk. He kicked his horse into motion, but when he realized he
had done it blindly he pulled up and took a hard grip on himself.
There was really only one way to leave this country now. He would
follow Lost Man, under the timber's shelter, cross the Silver Bow
by dark and make a long run to the railroad. He would catch a train
at Virgil, which was a water-tank stop east of Prairie.</p>

<p>It had to be the train; he had to put a thousand miles behind
him as rapidly as possible. He swayed on the saddle and kicked the
horse with his heels, sliding from the trail into the timber. Each
forward yard tightened his inner suspense until every pine tree
took on the shape of a gallows. If he was caught he would be hung.
He groaned again, momentarily losing his self-control. There was
nothing in him now but a pure dread of capture.</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart came to this cross-trail spot not more than five
minutes after Red John had departed, and stopped to inspect the
scuffed snow. His own tracks and those of Aurora were there; and
others as well. The whole area had been crisscrossed by travel.
Wind was rising again and snow fell slanting and thick, screening
everything beyond twenty yards. Day's light had turned duller. Out
of the broken country to the east came the distant sing of a shot.
This, he thought, was far beyond and below the Bowley house; it
seemed DePard had caught Keene's trail.</p>

<p>Aiming through the pines on a downgrade course which would bring
him to the narrow meadow skirting the Short Hills, he found tracks
printed before him; these he followed with an increased care. A
kind of cold, growling sensation got at his nerves, and now in this
cultivated and unsure man was an emotion which astonished him and
which, because of his analytical mind, he tried to understand. In a
way it was like looking back into the dim beginnings of his
ancestral line and seeing the apparition of a squat and shaggy man
whose little red eyes stared out from beneath deep sockets and a
sloping forehead; a man with matted hair, crouching because he had
not yet learned to stand, with nothing on his face but the feral
instinct to kill for safety or for meat.</p>

<p>Every fragment of conscious philosophy Cleve Stewart owned
denied the existence of that shaggy man behind him. Yet there the
little man was, his sly eyes peering out of a half covert, as
though he had been following Cleve Stewart and would never cease to
follow. Cleve shook the fancy away. Yet he said: "Perhaps we are
all nearer to him than we think," and then he felt better; he felt
prouder and tougher. Following the tracks laid down before him, he
was less unsure: somewhere within him the spirit of the little man
stirred.</p>

<p>These tracks threaded the timber and came to the edge of the
narrow meadow; they made a crisscross pattern on the meadow and
soon came back to the timber. Out in the meadow snow whirled
steadily from the sky and Stewart saw nothing but the half
materialized outline of a broken ridge across the way. Somewhere in
this day Keene traveled and somewhere DePard traveled; but now
Stewart was isolated and at loss. The tracks paralleled the meadow,
keeping within the trees. Following them, Stewart went on a hundred
yards and saw the tracks double back in the direction of the ridge
crest.</p>

<p>By now Stewart was pleased with his own courage. He had tasted
something wild and bitter; the taste was good and a strange
ambition stalked through him. He lifted his revolver from his heavy
coat and held it on his lap; he moved uphill, searching the blind
coverts of timber on either hand. The tracks led him to the height
of the ridge and to the trail running north and south along it; and
once again that unknown rider seemed to be swayed by uncertainty.
Pursuing the trail three or four hundred feet, he had cut downslope
again, aiming at the meadow.</p>

<p>"Like a drunk trying to walk a straight line," thought
Stewart.</p>

<p>It occurred to him to give the tracks a closer inspection. Out
of the saddle and on his knees, he looked into foot-deep prints and
saw the clear stamp of the hoof mark, still uncovered by fresher
snow; the traveler was at no great distance ahead.</p>

<p>Stewart got back on the horse. He drew a long breath, suddenly
needing wind. To this point he had been on a comfortable chase,
playing with the notion of pursuit but seeing nothing too serious
in it. Now the possibilities of this pursuit hit him in the
stomach. His face held a long, indrawn stiffness and he confronted
himself with the old question again: What was he made of and how
deep was his courage? He looked down at the gun on his lap and he
knew he wouldn't rest until he found that out; it was too late to
withdraw.</p>

<p>He thought: "I'll stay off that trail. I'll get on his flank."
He moved forward on the main trail: he came to a long bend and
crouched forward in the saddle. Grayness swept through the trees in
waves, an illusion produced by the steady drive of snow. Half
around the bend, he heard the distinct explosion of a gunshot: that
turned him immediately downgrade to the narrow meadow. Reaching its
edge he looked out into the snow's white scurry, saw nothing at all
in the small area of visibility, and turned to the right. Within
fifty feet he came upon the trail of the unknown rider: that rider
had at last entered the open country.</p>

<p>Another shot beat back through the wind, originating from the
far side of the meadow. Stewart scrubbed an arm over his stiff
face; excitement began to sing in his nerves. Everything came to
this moment and nothing else mattered. He drew a long breath and
was afraid of himself, but the shaggy little man's red eyes were
again watching him from some distant covert of time with a bright
flame of interest. Stewart pushed out of the timber and started
over the valley toward that general spot from which the shot had
seemed to come.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; AT ROPE'S END</h2>

<p class="first">FADING back into the timber near the Bowley house.
Keene ran through the timber, parallel to the meadow, and came into
the open again. The two Broken Bit men were dissolved shadows in
the screening shimmer of snowfall. A shot rang out. He pushed at
the horse with his spurs, sending it forward in labored jumps,
until the gray wall of a ridge broke through the weather. Keene
reached the ridge's first slope and passed into a side gulch; he
followed the gulch a few yards, slid into timber and swung about.
The two Broken Bit men's shadows had vanished.</p>

<p>He held the Winchester on his lap, waiting. Wind, growing
stronger, trembled the pine branches overhead and shook stringers
of snow on him. Somewhere in the meadow he heard a voice calling
and then one Broken Bit man broke from the woolly smother. Keene
flung up his Winchester, aimed low, and fired. The Broken Bit
rider's horse dropped sidewise and the rider, flinging himself
clear of the saddle, rolled on and on. Keene put a second shot near
the man, hearing his wild, high yell. The man reared up, rushing
back into the snow screen.</p>

<p>He heard the other Broken Bit man calling. From the head of the
ravine a gun spoke in quick signal.</p>

<p>Keene dropped back to the side gulch, climbed a short distance
and cut to the east, returning toward the source of the signal
shot. He arrived at a low point of the ridge, with the meadow below
him. Standing against the dark wall of pines, he heard DePard's men
calling but could not see them. Those voices drifted with the
wind.</p>

<p>They came nearer. Keene reined his horse gently into the timber
and stood fast. Below him the shadows of Broken Bit's men began to
emerge. They drifted along the far side of the meadow, never fully
taking shape; and over there they stopped. He heard their voices
again. In a little while the voices faded and the shadows
faded.</p>

<p>He came off the ridge into the meadow and now he had DePard in
front of him, going away. DePard's crew had left a broad set of
tracks on the snow and along these Keene drifted. The tracks
circled gradually toward the east edge of the meadow. When he saw
that, Keene pulled up.</p>

<p>Somewhere on his left a door squealed and a board fell against
another board. Swinging about, Keene faced the unseen edge of
timber to the west. Over there, closer than he had supposed, lay
the Bowley house, and as he paused to consider that he saw a new
set of shadows break the snow screen again in a ragged file. This
was another party. One pace farther away and they would have seen
him. But they moved on and were gone. He heard a voice say:</p>

<p>"Try a shot."</p>

<p>The shot broke against the wind. The same voice said: "Here's
tracks."</p>

<p>Listening closely to further sound from that area, he caught the
brittle scuff of snow whose source seemed to swing with the wind.
Keene shook his head. He bent low in the saddle to get the wind out
of his ears and heard the sound definitely originate behind. What
occurred to him then, even before he looked back, was that DePard
had followed his tracks up the side of the east ridge and around
into the open ground. He had cut back on DePard; now DePard had cut
back on him.</p>

<p>He looked back, to discover at once shapes forming in the
oatmeal thickness of the air. This would be DePard's main bunch
following the tracks he had left behind him. They were moving
slowly, turning more distinct in the day. DePard's voice yelled:
"There!"</p>

<p>Keene clipped the horse with his heels, rushing away. A shot
beat along the wind and DePard's continuing halloo sailed out of
the rear. Keene swung to the right, looked back to find no shadow
near him, and straightened forward once more. This unseen meadow
was all in a moment crisscrossed by the hard-thrown shouting of men
seeking contact and next he heard horses slogging along the snow
not far away, and when he heard that he swung to the left with the
intention of reaching the pines on the Lost Man side of the meadow.
Making the swing, he came through the mists at the same instant
another man raced up from a lower quarter of the meadow.</p>

<p>It was Snap. He saw Snap's red face stretch in surprise, he saw
Snap's gun rise. Keene's pony slammed it shoulders against Snap's
horse and the roar of the Broken Bit man's gun walloped Keene's
face and drove at his eardrums. Keene had his Winchester half
lifted and as Snap rolled back from the collision of the horses,
Keene brought the barrel of the gun down on Snap's head and knocked
him senseless from the saddle.</p>

<p>He was still moving to the left, now watching shadows move in.
He straightened at once, with a great-lunged cry hard at his heels:
"Keep him away from the trees!"</p>

<p>They had him boxed. He moved to the right, the pony plunging up
and down in the drifts and making great labor of it. He lost the
shapes on his left. Still veering to the right he reached the sharp
eastern slope of the meadow wall and found no breach. The meadow,
he guessed, formed a watercourse of the hills and would lead at
last into the open country near the Silver Bow. Meanwhile he heard
DePard's voice from a greater distance and thus knew he had
temporarily escaped Broken Bit's encircling maneuver. Running on,
Keene found a low notch in the ridge wall and swung at it
immediately. The horse broke through a crust of ice into a creek,
stumbled and caught its balance. Then Keene rose steadily into the
ridge.</p>

<p>There was no timber within view. The ground beneath him grew
increasingly rough and the horse, spending out its strength on the
steep slope, began to falter. Keene dropped from the saddle and
went ahead of the horse. He had lost all sound of men behind him:
he had lost as well the general pattern of the country. In these
broken hills there was no way of knowing what was ahead.</p>

<p>He came at last to a level rim and started over it, soon
arriving at thoroughly impassable ground. Timber clung to the sharp
edge of a rock barrier. Turning, he followed a ledge. The ledge
grew narrow and within five minutes he came to a dead stop. The
rock wall, edging in, pinched him off on the left. To his right was
the edge of a canyon whose bottom was lost beneath the gray shadows
and the snowfall.</p>

<p>He realized then DePard's smart maneuvering. The only way to
escape this blind alley was to turn about and retrace his trail.
That, of course, was out of the question. DePard was no doubt now
coming up on his tracks. DePard had him bottled.</p>

<p>Keene kicked away the snow and got down on his knees, digging
into the surface of the ledge. He got a chunk of rock and let it
drop into the canyon. No sound came back to him. He dug out another
rock, heavier than the first, and heaved it over the brink and
thought he heard the answering splash of water. He had guessed that
steady washing echo around him came from the wind; now he believed
it came from a fast-running creek in the bottom of the canyon.</p>

<p>He had fifty feet of rope on the saddlehorn. He made a solid tie
to the off stirrup of the saddle and flung the rest of the rope
into the canyon. Flat on his belly, with his head hooked over the
rim, he saw the yellow rope's end pay out through the snow and
shadow and disappear. He jiggled the rope up and down, feeling it
drag along the side of the canyon but unable to determine whether
or not it touched bottom; and after listening to the creek he had
no better estimate of the distance.</p>

<p>He gripped the Winchester and let himself over the rim,
descending on the rope. Above him the horse stirred and for a
moment he felt himself being dragged sidewise along the canyon's
face as the horse started on the back trail. That motion presently
stopped. Keene sank rapidly down, chest scraping the rocky outcrop
of the canyon's face. His hat fell off, the sound of the creek
reached up to him. At the bitter end of the rope he swung slowly,
like the weight of a pendulum's arm, his feet touching nothing but
air. The horse again moved and the taut rope, catching on the rough
rim above, jerked him violently into the wall. He snagged his cheek
against a stunted pine somehow growing in that impossible
place.</p>

<p>Keene pushed himself far back from the wall with his feet and
let go. Tight-braced for a long fall, he dropped immediately into a
swift water that carried him off his feet and sent him sidewise
against a niggerhead in the current. He gripped the niggerhead and
stood erect, still clinging to the Winchester. The shock of the
water took all wind from him. He opened his mouth wide and a
guttering sound came out of his throat as breath returned; he was
hip-high in a current hitting him like the edge of a board.</p>

<p>Steadying himself against the niggerhead, he gouged his boot
heels into the slick gravel of the creek's bottom, stepped
cautiously forward and found shallows before him. He came up to dry
land. He came up also to the round face of a gallery cut into the
canyon's wall. Looking into the gallery he saw the black ashes of a
dead fire, a coffeepot and a frying pan.</p>

<p>This was the hideout to which Portia Crews had brought him two
nights before.</p>

<p>A shot broke along the canyon, setting up a long and hollow
drumming. Keene ducked back into the gallery. Looking upward, he
saw the end of the lariat move out of sight, drawn away by men
standing on the rim. Cold as ice, with water dripping slowly along
his skin, he remembered there was but one exit from this
gorge.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Passing down the narrow meadow, Cleve Stewart had the wind hard
against his back and the tracks of the unknown traveler before him.
For a while the tracks moved straight into the south, keeping to
the middle of the meadow. Half a mile or more on, those tracks
began to veer errantly, as though the man had been struck again by
the uncertainty he had displayed previously in the pines. The
tracks moved over to the Short Hills edge of the meadow, started up
a slope and got as far as timber; here they doubled back into the
meadow, crossed it and turned.</p>

<p>Cleve had nursed the thought that this might be Keene ahead of
him. The longer he followed the trail the more sure he became that
it was not, for Keene was too certain a man to leave that kind of
print behind him. More likely, Stewart guessed, the fellow ahead
belonged to Broken Bit.</p>

<p>The day was biting cold and this guess made him colder. Still,
he was not afraid; realizing at last where those tracks might lead
him, Cleve Stewart said to himself, as one man talking to another:
"Well, this is it. You're in it now." If he came suddenly upon the
Broken Bit man and if the Broken Bit man moved for his gun he,
Stewart, would draw. There was one ticklish point, though, in all
this reasoning. If he drew, should he fire at once or should he
wait? If he waited the delay might kill him. He had been long
enough in the country to have heard tougher men explain their
philosophy of fighting. There was, they had said, a time for
talking but a man had to judge when that time was past. How was he
to know? He had never drawn a gun on a man. Keene, he thought,
would know all this by heart.</p>

<p>He found more in Keene to admire at this moment than ever
before. It was not a simple thing to fight. It was not easy to move
blindly through snow, playing hide and seek with trouble. It took
courage, but it took something more as well&mdash;it took a sound
knowledge of other men, the ability to read in their eyes the
things they would do; it took a hard-gained experience in all the
clever tricks of living, an ability to listen into the wind, to
read the patterns on the earth, to make a story out of dust and
distant motion. As an educated man, possessing the prejudices of
education, Cleve Stewart always had felt a certain contempt for men
whose lives were confined to action; to him they were half blind,
knowing nothing of the great and gentle philosophies which made
life understandable.</p>

<p>But somewhere in the last twenty-four hours Stewart's world had
come down about him; a complete change had occurred in him. The
wisdom which came from earthy men, the wisdom of survival and
bitter wind beating into a man's bones, of hunger suffered and
thirst endured&mdash;this was the real wisdom, gained not from
books or the tales of other travelers but personally experienced so
that a man got it into his spirit and nerves and blood. A man had
to know of what he was made. Knowing that, he knew everything.</p>

<p>To his rear and to his left one shot trembled in the hidden day.
After a pause other shots broke in tumbling repetition. Stewart
swung around, riding into the wind. He came against the high
shoulder of the ridge on the Short Hills side, finding no easy way
of climbing from the meadow. Plugging upwind, he caught no more
sounds and therefore he stopped and waited out a long five minutes;
and at last turned back to search for the trail he had abandoned.
He moved away from the foot of the east ridge into the middle of
the meadows and went slowly forward. Snow thickened and raced
before the wind, closing about him and narrowing his vision. A
shadow, very vague, showed ahead and he thought he had drifted
against the trees on the Lost Man side of the meadow. He pulled
away to clear those trees, but the shadow seemed to move with him;
and then, out of the driving gray-white wall, a rider came at
him.</p>

<p>He was no more than a double length of a horse from this rider
when he recognized the long, red-whipped face of Red John shadowed
by his hatbrim. He saw the chill shock in Red John's eyes and
without need of thinking, without hesitation of any kind, Cleve
Stewart flung up his Winchester.</p>

<p>Red John howled one formless word and pulled away. Red John's
hand pointed and Stewart, weaving in the saddle, heard the beat of
Red John's gun and thought he felt the breath of the bullet on his
face. Stewart drove a shot at the foreman now sliding off into the
pall; he knew he had missed and pulled the horse to a stop and
fired again, this time at the pure wall of snow before him. Red
John had vanished.</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart yelled, not knowing why, and gripped the
Winchester hard with his hands. He had been shot at and he had
answered with his own gun&mdash;and he was experiencing a feeling
of ease and certainty he had never known; it was a sweet and whole
sensation which changed him and made the world forever different.
He yelled again and kicked his horse into a plunging run, trying to
lift Red John out of the snow curtain.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Red John looked behind him and saw nothing: now he was half mad
from thinking too long of his situation and he wasted one more
bullet before taking control of himself. He moved to the right and
came upon the high shoulder of the east ridge and discovered no
quick way of leaving the meadow. He went along with his body bent
forward in the saddle, exhausting his horse by the steady rake of
his spurs. In his mind he saw himself swinging slowly at the end of
a rope, with women&mdash;those familiar faces coming again before
him&mdash;laughing at his broken neck. He heard that laughter in
the wind, high and heartless and wild.</p>

<p>He slanted off from the ridge, aiming at the timber on the Lost
Man side of the meadow. The trees, he now thought, would be safest.
In them he might squirm and dodge his way to the Silver Bow and
there wait until darkness came before crossing the ford. Behind
him, in faintest echo, was the reverberation of firing. Before him
a streak of darkness materialized in the steady flicker of snow. A
voice said: "Who's that?"</p>

<p>Red John threw his weight about, he jerked the horse hard aside.
Those shadows closed in, they emerged and became full bodies. He
was at a dead stop, his horse confused and shaking; and he looked
across the short space at the half-surprised faces of young Joe
Spackman and the little group of homesteaders.</p>

<p>They had caught him, never expecting it; they were off-guard at
the moment&mdash;the elder Spackman with his round Hollander's face
loose in half-formed wonder, the Scotchman Comrie, Kilrain and
Elijah Patterson, and other men he had never seen. They bulked
before him, they made a half circle around him&mdash;silent and
reflective and slowly pondering him.</p>

<p>Young Joe Spackman said: "Put up your hands, Red. I'm going to
ride around and snatch your gun. Put up your hands."</p>

<p>In the rising wind was that wild, condemning laughter of women.
It screamed against Red John's ears; he thought of their voices
once so soft-whispering in his ears, he thought of warmth never to
touch him again, he thought of Jennie Cannon and saw her face lift
to him under the moonlight, half smiling and half afraid. That was
his last thought except one, and it was his hardest thought.</p>

<p>Young Spackman said: "You're caught, Red. Do what I tell you.
Put up your hands."</p>

<p>Red John had one hand in his coat pocket, gripping the solid
butt of his revolver. He pulled out the hand, with the gun, and
jammed the gun's muzzle into his mouth. He had started to speak,
but those words, whatever they might have been, were blown
everlastingly away when he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The homesteaders sat rooted, watching Red John roll from the
saddle and drop; blood brightened the snow and turned quickly
black. Comrie clenched his teeth together at the sight. Kilrain
grew pale. The elder Spackman said in a sick voice: "Why did he do
that?"</p>

<p>Young Joe, who understood what madness could be like, said: "He
knew what was going to happen to him."</p>

<p>The older Spackman glanced at his son. "Why, I guess he did,"
and continued to watch young Joe.</p>

<p>Comrie called: "Watch out&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shape broke through the thick mists. Young Joe reached for his
Winchester and aimed it full on that shape; and dropped the gun as
Cleve Stewart moved into view.</p>

<p>Comrie said: "You after him?" and pointed to the ground.</p>

<p>Stewart stared down. Day's cold had hardened his face beyond the
ability to change expression. But because he was a reflective man,
he sat long silent, thinking of those things which must have been
last in Red John's mind. The great and wise philosophers, looking
into the hearts of men two thousand years ago, and five thousand
miles from this spot, had spoken of this thing, foretelling Red
John's end. He looked up at the homesteaders and moved his
shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>"Keene's back of us somewhere. DePard's got his crew there,
pretty close to Keene. I've heard firing."</p>

<p>"Time's now to finish this," said Comrie.</p>

<p>"Come on then," said Stewart and led them back into the
wind.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Big Jesse Morspeare, hard on Keene's heels the previous night,
had reached Aurora's store and found it empty. By then the storm
had warned him to take shelter but the store was a spot not to his
liking and therefore he crossed the flats to the line cabin, which
was the closest shelter, unknowingly on the heels of both Keene and
DePard. When he found the warm stove in the line cabin he sat long
in the cabin's darkness, suspicious yet not wanting to risk the
storm, his slow mind meanwhile plucking at the edges of the
puzzle.</p>

<p>When day came he moved doggedly south on the ridge trail with
Keene uppermost in his sullen head. At the Bowley turnoff he saw
tracks and followed them to the house, finding nothing. Returning
to the main trail, he moved south until he reached the east-west
road, snow whirling soft and thick around him and the wind
beginning to take on voice in the timber. A mile from the Broken
Bit ranch he saw a shape rise through the making storm and in a
little while he overtook Red John's horse, which walked slowly in
the direction of the ranch. Blood lay frozen on the riderless
saddle.</p>

<p>He towed the horse into the ranch, finding an empty yard and an
empty barn. The cookstove was buried beneath a mound of snow, the
Chinaman had disappeared. Morspeare sat in the barn, cold and
troubled and useless. He knew nothing of DePard's whereabouts, he
suspected the worst from Red John's saddle. Now alone, a masterless
and unbridled animal, he brooded in sullen silence. Constantly he
thought of Keene and because he was a man capable only of great
loyalty and great hatred&mdash;no lesser emotions lying between
those extremes&mdash;he saw Keene as the cause of all this ruin and
his rage increased and left him with a savage, inarticulate longing
to kill.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; JENNIE</h2>

<p class="first">KEENE stood back in the rock gallery, listening to
echoes beat along the narrow gorge. DePard's men were fifty feet
above him on the rim, out of sight in the snowstorm, blindly firing
down in hope of a chance hit. Wind rolled into the gallery and
built up the ice-chill of his wet clothes. His legs and feet ached
from cold; his muscles began to knot up.</p>

<p>The firing quit. Keene moved to the edge of the creek, knowing
he could not stay here. The only exit was downgrade to his left and
this exit, he realized, DePard would now have blocked. But he had
to move on, warned by the frigid splinters of this weather driving
into his marrow, into his vitals. This was not the smooth and
lulling approach of cold death; this was pain biting at him,
burning through him. He gripped the Winchester and fell into a
spraddled run. His legs were thick and clumsy, his feet were
granite blocks within his wet boots. He tripped over a snow-hidden
boulder and dropped on his belly, sliding forward. He got up,
angered by the fall and pushed by the need of haste, and at last
fully conscious of the danger in his body. He continued to shiver
as he ran; he stamped his feet hard against the snow. Sensations
came up through his legs, in slow, delayed waves. Pain quit, and by
that he knew his feet were freezing.</p>

<p>He watched the canyon wall on his left, he watched the creek to
his right. Presently the creek began to move away from him and the
canyon wall took on a shallow pitch; the mouth of the canyon was
before him, widening into the invisible meadow ahead. He was still
at a steady running gait. Creek and canyon wall vanished; he was
alone in the white-driving smother, the Winchester chest-high and
slanted forward. In this windy, blind area he heard a voice rise
and grow dim, and a shape came up from nothing and wavered in the
snow screen. He ran dead at it, he fired at it and saw the shape
sway aside and vanish. He continued forward at this changeless
gait, with other gray shapes sliding along the edge of visibility
and disappearing. A rider curved up from the right, the grunt of
his horse stiff and deep in the wind. Keene turned the muzzle of
the Winchester at the still unseen target and fired; a voice howled
in full volume against the wind. That sound trembled in the storm
and was blown away.</p>

<p>He pounded his dead feet hard into the snow as he ran. He was
out in the valley flat, feeling nothing at all from toe to knee.
Wind shouldered him, snow spatted against his cheeks and built
ragged awnings on his eyebrows. He heard that same on-pushing voice
come nearer. A rider pushed invisibly past; going on five yards,
Keene saw the tracks of that horse. Men were circling in the storm,
crisscrossing the area in search of him, and once more he heard
them calling. One voice lifted high:</p>

<p>"Here's his trail!"</p>

<p>Beyond this area and beyond the sound of these voices Keene
heard a shot, as though a detached part of DePard's outfit signaled
from another quarter. Close by, a shot answered. He was, he
guessed, three quarters across the valley but the long run and the
pressure of the wind and the snow underfoot had him deadbeat. He
took one long stride, lost balance, and went down. Flat against the
snow he heard a horse grunt by; he resisted the impulse to lie
still, he fought the powerful pull of exhaustion and rose to his
knees and faced his back trail. In the distance another gun
cracked&mdash;and as Keene rose to his feet, still gripping the
Winchester, he saw a shape break from the wild, millrace run of the
storm, head down and shoulders bent.</p>

<p>It was DePard, afoot. DePard had his eyes on the tracks Keene
had left behind him: suddenly DePard lifted his face and discovered
Keene before him. He took one more onward step and jerked to a
complete halt.</p>

<p>He had lost his hat. Snow crusted his black scalp: it was a
white rime on his cheeks, a sleeted braiding along his clothes.
Without an overcoat, without gloves he stood tough and impervious
to the weather, his cotton shirt thrown open at the neck. This
day's cold fanned the rich blood to his face: in his eyes was a
bright self-certain flare. What Keene saw was an expression of
supreme pleasure, a long-lipped grimace of satisfaction; the man's
will was that fixed.</p>

<p>"Friend," said DePard, "you reached the end of the trail on a
damned cold day."</p>

<p>In his mind there was no doubt at all, never a moment's
uncertainty. He held a gun at the extended length of his right
hand. Keene, slowly freezing in his tracks, called to his muscles
and felt them slowly change the tilt of the Winchester. It was the
longest moment of his life as he watched DePard bring up the
revolver. He saw the snout of his own gun tip but he had no control
over it; it moved in slow motion, beyond his power to hurry. He
heard a shot and he felt the Winchester kick against his arm, but
this was a faint feeling that came from a great distance. Across
the interval, DePard's mouth framed a word; a strange anguish broke
in DePard's eyes, an unbelieving shock. DePard bowed his head in
one reluctant, bitter motion; he seemed to be looking at the
revolver slowly pulling his arm down; he seemed to be praying at
it. When he fell he turned aside and dropped with his face deep in
the snow.</p>

<p>A yell slanted through the wind and once again there was the
thump of a horse veering through this blind weather. Keene slung
his gun around, firing at a shadow. The horse moved away. A gun
exploded, quite near. The echo of it came to him as through a
speaking tube:</p>

<p>"Keene!"</p>

<p>"Here," he said, in a small voice. He said again, no louder,
"Here." He retreated a few feet, passing DePard. He looked at
DePard.</p>

<p>"Keene!"</p>

<p>He stiffened in his tracks, he planted his legs&mdash;wooden as
pine poles&mdash;apart and got the Winchester breast-high.</p>

<p>A rider passed within three yards of him, running on. That rider
yelled his name, and then Keene looked up and saw Cleve Stewart
suddenly above him.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you sing out?" shouted Stewart.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>Stewart bent on the saddle, intently staring at Keene. He said,
"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>Stewart noticed DePard for the first time and slid from the
saddle and bent down over the dead man; he came back to Keene. He
lifted a hand and caught Keene's cheek flesh between his fingers.
"Feel that?"</p>

<p>"No." said Keene. "Let's get over to the Bowley house." He spoke
with elaborate distinctness fighting the great weight of weariness.
He was in need of sleep and that need was hard to bear. He had his
chin against his chest and pulled it up with some difficulty to
find that both Spackmans had ridden out of the murk. "To the Bowley
house," said Keene again. He wished to make that clear. "I want to
thaw out."</p>

<p>Cleve said: "Ride behind Joe."</p>

<p>Keene tried to lift a leg to the stirrup. He said, "I guess I've
taken on weight."</p>

<p>Stewart got a shoulder against him. Joe Spackman caught him by
the arm. Keene rolled heavily as he rose; he took young Joe around
the ribs with his hands.</p>

<p>Other homesteaders had drifted in. Stewart called: "Don't waste
any time gettin' there. Joe."</p>

<p>Keene felt motion vaguely as the horse moved across the valley.
They struck timber, young Joe calling back; "Where's that house?"
Stewart rode ahead to lead the way. They came against the side of
the barn and circled it and rode through the broken doorway. The
force of the wind left Keene and a kind of long, velvet silence
surrounded him and the last of physical sensation seemed to leave
him. He sat on the horse's rump, unable to move and not concerned
about it. He had his full weight on young Joe. Sleep was a soft
bottomless hole into which he sank without resistance. From a
distance he heard Stewart rapidly say:</p>

<p>"Get a fire going. Do it quick. Come on. Comrie. We'll get him
down. We'll get his clothes off and slap hell out of him. The man's
halfway turned to marble."<br></p>
<br>

<p>Morspeare heard a call in the Broken Bit yard and walked to the
doorway of the barn. Snap and Len Teal rode through the snowfall
into the barn.</p>

<p>Snap said: "Where's that Chinaman? I want some coffee."</p>

<p>"Chinaman's gone. Dig out the stove and light your own fire.
What the hell you think I am? Grat comin'&mdash;Red John comin'?
Where's everybody?"</p>

<p>Neither man left the saddle. Snap pushed a hand heavily across a
scarred cheek; he had been bleeding at the nose, he had lost a
front tooth. He said to Len Teal: "By God, I hate to buck this
weather again. Can't stop at Crews's&mdash;not now. Or Stewart's.
Nor any of the homesteaders'. Forty miles to town, Len. Hell of a
long ways."</p>

<p>"Better start," said Teal. "They'll be comin' this way."</p>

<p>"Who's comin'?" asked Morspeare.</p>

<p>"I got some blankets over in the straw," said Teal.</p>

<p>"Let 'em alone," answered Snap. "We can buy fresh blankets at
the next ranch we work for. Which will be a hell of a long ways
from here. I don't want no more of this country. Gives me the
shakes to think about it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Teal, "let's go." He looked down at the massive,
slow-witted Morspeare. "You better get out of here. Them
homesteaders will be up here pretty soon. Grat got killed by Keene.
Red shot himself. Better go."</p>

<p>They rode into the weather, leaving big Jesse alone. He watched
them vanish, not yet fully understanding what they had told him. He
said: "How could Grat get killed? What'd Red John shoot himself
for?" He turned it over and over in his mind; it was impossible to
think of Grat being dead&mdash;it left a hole in the big man. It
made him lonely, it destroyed the only solid thing he had ever
known.</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway, scowling at the snow, painfully piecing
together the scraps of information; and when he had the story
gathered in his head he turned back into the barn and saddled his
horse. Sitting up on the leather he looked around him; and then got
down and walked over to a clean stall where Grat kept his
belongings. Grat had left a briar pipe on a box. Morspeare took the
pipe and held it in his enormous palm. He brought the back of the
other hand up across his nose, sniveling like a boy. Afterwards he
put the pipe in his pocket, returned to the horse and left Broken
Bit.</p>

<p>"Grat," he said into the stormy, blank day, "I'll fix that for
you. You was a better man than him. I'll fix it for you. Don't
doubt that."</p>

<p>Later in the day he skirted the edge of the Crews ranch and
watched its yard until he was satisfied Keene was not there. Near
noon he drifted against the side of Stewart's house and crawled to
a window, looking in. Past the middle of the afternoon, a gray
ghost in the steady race of snow, he came quietly upon the lean-to
of Aurora's store, finding only Aurora's horse stabled there. Keene
hadn't reached here either. Big Jesse crossed the ford, moving on
to Prairie City.</p>

<p>He was a lonely, disconsolate dog who had lost his master, but
the devotion to Grat remained&mdash;the only devotion big Jesse
ever had known. He said again in broken-hearted misery: "I'll make
it right, Grat. I'll kill that man for you."<br></p>
<br>

<p>All the homestead men had come into Bowley's barn and now stood
close by the fire built from hay and scrap boards. Wrapped in a
saddle blanket, Keene waited for his clothes to dry. Heat began to
penetrate his muscles and loosen them; heat traveled into him,
thawing out distant recesses. Before they had let him come near the
fire they had pounded circulation painfully back into his legs and
face and that necessary punishment had left its aches. He was
hollow with hunger but life began to run through him&mdash;he was
whole again. His black hair still glittered with wetness, his face
was rough with whiskers, and his eyes sparkled against the
firelight.</p>

<p>"So he shot himself," said Cleve, explaining Red John.</p>

<p>Steam rose from Keene's drying clothes. Everybody crowded around
the fire but the talk died out. Let-down was on these men&mdash;the
reaction of fighting; they were looking back on what they had done
and seeing themselves in a strange light. Watching them, Keene
observed that these homesteaders, all good and faithful and honest
men, were uncomfortably remembering what they had done. It was a
way of living to which they were unaccustomed; that gray business
troubled them and they were trying to forget it.</p>

<p>Comrie said: "We better go up to Broken Bit."</p>

<p>"You'll find nobody there," said Keene.</p>

<p>"Just the same," said Comrie, "we better go. It is a dirty chore
better finished for good. I don't want to do this again."</p>

<p>"Once in one lifetime is enough," agreed the elder Spackman.
Then he looked at Keene and closed his mouth, as though he might
have said something to offend Keene.</p>

<p>"Yes," Keene said, "once is enough. I hope you never have to do
it again."</p>

<p>"You think we might have to do it again?" asked the elder
Spackman.</p>

<p>"No," said Keene. "DePard's dead."</p>

<p>"There's his crew."</p>

<p>Keene spoke out of his experience&mdash;the kind of experience
none of them had, the kind he hoped they'd never have; for the
reaction was on him, too, and he saw himself in that unlovely light
which always came to him when riding was done. "They'll scatter,"
he said. "In a thing like this there's always a kingpin. When he's
gone everything falls apart. There won't be any Broken Bit
anymore."</p>

<p>"You know what I'm going to do?" said Kilrain. "I'm going to
give up my quarter-section and move across the ford to the valley.
That's the place."</p>

<p>"Out of Egypt," murmured Keene, "to the promised land. Ten years
from now that valley will be fences and houses, with trees growing
up. It will be a pretty sight. I'd like to ride back someday and
see it."</p>

<p>"You're not staying here?" asked Cleve, showing
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Me?" said Keene. "What would I be doing with a home? I guess
those clothes are dry enough."</p>

<p>He dropped the blanket to show a long red scar from left hip to
knee, the mark of his fall from the rope in the canyon. He got into
his clothes.</p>

<p>Comrie said: "I think we better ride up to Broken Bit just the
same."</p>

<p>"All right," said Spackman, though not liking the thought. Then
he said to Keene, "Any time you pass my house, now and twenty years
from now, there's a chair at the table."</p>

<p>"Why," said Comrie, "that is the least any of us can say."</p>

<p>The homesteaders moved to the barn doorway. Comrie turned back.
"I am not a man to harbor sinful thoughts. Those men, out there
dead in the valley, they need a Christian burial. We will wait
until the storm breaks and come back for them."</p>

<p>Kilrain mused: "Him that was so proud&mdash;the DePard I
mean&mdash;him that walked the earth and made the ground shake,
'tis hard to think of him cold clay. Wantin' a little less, he
could have had the sweetness of his days and looked upon his cattle
in content. Wantin' too much, it is nothin' now he's got."</p>

<p>"A man," reflected Keene softly, "is what he is. It is written
in the book."</p>

<p>They were thoughtful and attentive but they didn't know what was
in his head; they didn't really understand. He smiled, saying, "I'm
hungry," and moved to the horse they had found for him in the
storm; it was the same horse, it was Morspeare's. He rode up-trail
with the group and came to the crest of the ridge. They turned
south toward Broken Bit. At the Crews's turnoff Keane pulled out,
Cleve joining him. The homesteaders stopped, looking at him; and
Comrie rode back. He said; "You're leaving soon?"</p>

<p>"I expect."</p>

<p>"Well," said Comrie, "it will not be quite the same here," and
put out his hand.</p>

<p>Keene shook it. He said to all of them: "So long," and moved
down the Crews trail with Cleve. A dog charged across the Crews
yard, loudly sounding. A man appeared through the driving snow.</p>

<p>"All over," Stewart told him.</p>

<p>Portia met them at the door. It was Cleve&mdash;always the
reflective man&mdash;who saw the break of feeling in Portia's eyes
as she looked at Keene. She said in an unsteady voice: "You're
hungry, aren't you?" and turned toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>Keene called after her: "Where's Aurora?"</p>

<p>She swung about, the brightness of her eyes dying, the points of
her shoulders dropping. She said: "She went back to the store."</p>

<p>They had a meal; they returned to the front room. Keene stood at
the window, looking into the snow. Now that there was nothing to be
done, he was at loose ends, he was tired and he was restless. That,
he remembered, was the way it always was. He said: "I'll be
riding."</p>

<p>"To the store?" asked Portia.</p>

<p>"I'll stop there on the way to town."</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart stood in a far corner of the room, forgotten by
both of them. Portia came before Keene. She watched him for a long,
deep-searching moment; she read him and, because she loved him, she
knew him. "You're going, aren't you? Riding out as you rode
in?"</p>

<p>"I suppose."</p>

<p>"Are you sure there's nothing here you'll regret leaving?"</p>

<p>He lifted his shoulders and made that do for an answer.</p>

<p>She said: "If it isn't here, Jim, you'll never find it
anywhere."</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "you're right about that."</p>

<p>He turned to her with an expression half ironic and half
regretful. It seemed his most characteristic attitude&mdash;somehow
knowing himself for what he was, yet always touched by further
hope. He gave her a straight glance, he really looked at her with a
full and undivided attention. "So long," he said.</p>

<p>"So long, Jim."</p>

<p>He glanced across the room. "Thanks, Cleve. Thanks a lot."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Cleve.</p>

<p>Keene left the room, stepped to his saddle and turned from the
house. In the space of five yards he had vanished behind the storm.
Standing at the window, her cheek touching the cold glass and her
eyes straining at the spot she had last seen him, Portia spoke in a
dying voice: "How quick everything happens. How short the best
things always are."</p>

<p>Cleve Stewart came across the room. He took her shoulder and
pulled her around. She dropped her head to conceal her face; he put
a finger beneath her chin and lifted it and discovered the glitter
of tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Did he see that, Portia?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I waited until the door was closed, Cleve."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry." He tried to smile. "How long since he came
here? A week&mdash;a month? And the whole damned country's changed.
Mighty queer."</p>

<p>"You've changed, too, Cleve. You know, I never used to like you.
I guess you hid what you really were."</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "I guess I've grown up."</p>

<p>"That's a hard thing to do."</p>

<p>"Everything worth doing is hard."</p>

<p>She gave him a prolonged, interested appraisal. "Aren't you
going down to Aurora's?"</p>

<p>She wished she hadn't said it, for she recognized the quick
passage of hurt in his eyes, the rise of an old feeling and its
dampening. "No, not tonight, Portia." He turned away. "When I was a
youngster and came in wet and bruised my mother used to put me by
the fire and make up a dish of popcorn. Funny how a childhood
memory sticks. Whenever I feel tough I think of that."</p>

<p>"I'll make you some popcorn, Cleve."<br></p>
<br>

<p>It was middle-afternoon when Jim lifted the outline of Aurora's
store and cabin through the storm and saw the light shining from
the window. He shouted into the wind to announce himself; the door
opened at once and he saw Aurora brace herself against the sudden
rush of wind, her clothes pressed tight around her body. Her lips
moved, saying something to him, but her face remained grave. He
left his horse in the shed and went into the house. She closed the
door; she put her back to it. Snow sparkled diamond-bright in her
hair; light struck her eyes, provoking brilliance. She studied him
over the long moments, distantly wise. She said:</p>

<p>"Is it all over?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so. There's an expression on your face. It&mdash;I
think you'd like some coffee."</p>

<p>He sat down at the small table. He put his arms on it, watching
her move about the room. The coffeepot was already on the stove, in
homestead custom. She poured a cup for each of them; she sat
opposite him and now she was smiling.</p>

<p>"Is Cleve all right?"</p>

<p>"Everything's all right," he said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she corrected, "it would be better to say
everything's changed."</p>

<p>"Cleve's a good man. If I were riding with a partner I'd like to
have him along."</p>

<p>"But you don't ride with partners, do you?"</p>

<p>"I never have found anybody going as far along the trail as I
go. Maybe I fall in with somebody but they always turn off along
the line."</p>

<p>She said: "I was one of them. I rode a little way with you. You
kept me warm. That's going to be a happy memory."</p>

<p>She looked down at her cup. She sat idle and still in the chair,
her face softened by inward things that were rich and warm and
beautiful. She had never really shown him what she could be like.
Except for the one moment in the barn loft he had never been
permitted inside her guard. Yet he knew how strong, how deep and
violent her imagination could be, how hot the fire of her spirit
could burn. That glow now and then betrayed itself through the
barrier she kept lifted.</p>

<p>She spoke in a voice that felt and shared his hurts. "They've
bruised you. Somebody hit you on the face. You look very tired. Do
you want me to cook supper now? I have extra blankets. I'll leave
the storeroom door open to let heat in, if you want to sleep
there."</p>

<p>Wind shouldered heavily against the log house and snow flattened
on the window and dissolved. At three o'clock darkness was on the
way.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I'll ride on to town."</p>

<p>She rose from the table, moving back to the stove. She stood by
it, turned from him. Her voice was very even and self-controlled
and almost indifferent. "Riding on over the hill?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said.</p>

<p>"For to see the world&mdash;the big wide world."</p>

<p>He had finished his coffee and got up. "You're all right," he
told her. "Neither Red John nor DePard will be by this way again."
This was as close as he could come to telling her what had
happened. Now that it was done he had no pride in it; it was one
more thing he wanted to forget. The heat of his temper was gone,
the old sense of outrage lay cold and quenched. Everything in him
was quiet. "I think Cleve will ride this way."</p>

<p>"I expect he will, sooner or later."</p>

<p>"So long," he said.</p>

<p>She came around quickly. "Goodbye is a long time, Jim. Is this
the way you leave your women?"</p>

<p>He stepped across the room to her. "How did you know I'd be
thinking of that?" He pulled her forward and kissed her.</p>

<p>She lay quiet and unresisting and steady within his arms. She
had her eyes closed but when he pulled up his head she opened them
and he had the whole weight of what she was&mdash;the single, swift
outpour of what she really could be. All her gifts were as near and
open to him as they would ever be to any man; at that moment it
seemed to him his outstretched fingers touched the one great
opportunity of his life. It was only a momentary revelation, soon
hidden; and then he saw the weighing, waiting light of her glance
search him all through. That too vanished. She stepped back, tall
and darkly beautiful and calm as iron.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said in the driest, briefest tone.</p>

<p>"So long."</p>

<p>He left the cabin, closing the door behind. On his horse, he
came back past the door, seeing the shine of the window. He stopped
a moment but the door remained shut and he couldn't see through the
blur of the window. He moved away, crossed the ford and struck
across the flats toward Prairie.</p>

<p>Behind him was the best of himself. He had left it there in the
cabin. Behind him was all that any man could ever wish for. But
now, weary to the bone and sick of the way of his life, he rode on
in clear disillusion, seeing himself for what he really was: a
drifter, a riding bum, a man who had nothing a woman could find
pride in. This was why he had left the cabin, this was really why.
All the comfort he wanted was back there. For a while it would fill
him and make him forget; but he knew himself too well to think it
would last. The old restlessness would come again; and again he
would ride.<br></p>
<br>

<p>The homesteaders swung down the valley from Broken Bit, having
found nothing there. They looked in briefly at Aurora's and crossed
the ford, going their various directions. Spackman and young Joe
came into their yard. The elder got off his horse with a vast sigh.
"I am old, Joe. I could not do much more of this. No use pretending
to be young when you ain't. Let's get in the house."</p>

<p>"I'll be back," said young Joe, and rode into the weather. He
heard Comrie and Kilrain somewhere ahead but he kept his distance
from them, hard involved in his thoughts. He came, ten minutes
later, into the Cannon yard. Lights sprang through the windows,
warm and cheerful. Young Joe sat in the saddle, fighting down one
last small memory of Red John. Maybe, he thought, he never would
really forget it; but still it was different than it had been a few
days before. The acid-burning hurt of it had lessened. He was an
older man and some things didn't look the same.</p>

<p>The door came open and Jennie showed herself before him. She
said: "I thought I heard something," and looked at him,
half-startled. "Maybe," she murmured, "you would like to come
in."</p>

<p>"I just wanted to say," he announced, "that everything is all
right. That's all I wanted to say. I mean, Jim Keene killed Grat
DePard today. There is nothing more to worry about."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said in a small, lusterless tone. "It was nice
of you to come."</p>

<p>He looked at her, not knowing how to go on. At last, defeated by
lack of words he turned and rode into the snow. But then he swung
back, seeing her vaguely through the storm. "Red John's dead too,"
he called.</p>

<p>She cried after him: "Joe&mdash;Joe!" She ran through the snow.
He was near the Cannon barn; he wheeled against it and got down.
She came to him, her eyes dark with fresh tragedy. "You didn't do
it, Joe? You didn't?"</p>

<p>She was shaking. He opened the small barn door and pulled her
into it. He said: "No, I didn't. He shot himself."</p>

<p>She went loose, her eyes fixed on some black and terrible thing
far beyond him. She thought of it with a far-placed expression. She
said dully: "I feel sorry for him, Joe."</p>

<p>He was angry and hurt again. "You loved him, I guess. That's why
you asked me if I did it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she breathed. "Not that, Joe. I never did love him. I
was&mdash;just&mdash;" She couldn't say more about it. She thrust
it aside with a gesture of her hands. "But I couldn't think of you
making your hands red, Joe. You're not that kind. You mustn't ever
be."</p>

<p>"Jennie," he said, "what I came for was to say I wish it could
be like it was."</p>

<p>"Nothing can be that way. Something's gone."</p>

<p>"Why now," he said, "maybe it is. But maybe not. If it was all
gone I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't think of you. But I do. And
what I think is that I can't help being here."</p>

<p>"Not me," she breathed in a half-crying tone. "How can that be,
Joe? You'd remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>Maybe he would, he thought. But the hurt wasn't as hard to
bear&mdash;and pretty soon it wouldn't bother him at all. He
struggled with it, he gritted his teeth against it, the old longing
to have her as strong as it had ever been. Once it had been very
simple, but now it was not.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I want you, Jennie. That never changed."</p>

<p>She was openly crying. "You don't need to be kind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I ain't kind. I'd of killed Red if I could. But
it don't make any difference, Jennie. I got to have you."</p>

<p>She put up her face to him. She exclaimed in one passionate
breath: "I'll be good, Joe. I'll work so hard, I'll never look at
another man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "maybe you will look at other men, Jennie. I
don't guess you can help that altogether. It is just the way you're
made. But I'll know how to take care of that. I guess I've learned.
That's what I really think."</p>

<p>She waited for him to take her. She trembled a little, her face
lifted and ready for him. He stood back, not quite knowing what to
do; and then Jennie, a spark of coquetry returning, murmured: "You
can kiss me if you'd like to, Joe."</p>

<p>He took her in, awkward in this thing as he was in so many
others; but he felt good about it, he felt powerful and certain of
himself, like a man coming into his own. He held her gently,
because he knew what she had been through and he wanted to tell
her, this way, how he'd always be to her. But in a moment Jennie's
lips and the wild strong flavor of her got the best of him and he
wasn't gentle any more. He was young Joe Spackman, in love.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; "THIS WAY IT MUST
BE"</h2>

<p class="first">KEENE reached town near six o'clock, darkness
whirling in with the snow and the turbulent wind. He put up his
horse at the stable. This was the same
horse&mdash;Morspeare's&mdash;he had seized on his escape from
Broken Bit; the hostler, recognizing it, gave Keene a quick, uneasy
glance. At the doorway, starting into the street, Keene turned
sharp about.</p>

<p>"Anything on your mind?"</p>

<p>"No," said the hostler.</p>

<p>Keene tramped along the walk, snow beating at his back and
cold's bitterness cutting through his clothes. He was half
exhausted from all that he had been through and yet the old
caginess, the quick sense of danger, still moved in him. It made
him swing about to challenge the hostler, it was something which
would never leave him. This was what happened to a man like him,
taking all trust and security out of life. He moved through yellow
beams of lamplight, on through dark areas of shadow. He crossed to
the hotel and registered. The clerk gave him a key and he climbed
the stairs with his muscles bunching against the weight put on
them. His cheek points burned steadily where they had been frosted;
they would be sensitive for a long time.</p>

<p>It was the corner room again, facing the bullet hole in the
wall. That room's mustiness got in his nostrils, reminding him of a
hundred other rooms along the course of his travels. He washed and
rolled a cigarette, weary enough to sleep yet driven by the
constant irritability which would not let him be still. He made one
slow circle of the room and left it. He paused in the lobby,
hearing the clatter of dishes in the dining room and made hungry by
the smell of food. Men passed him, going to the dining room; a
woman came in and her eyes touched him and held him a moment, and
went on. He crossed to the saloon and had a drink. Warmth folded
around him. His body soaked it up steadily, never getting enough.
The whisky loosened him and the grumble of men's voices in the
saloon cradled him with a kind of comfort. He laid his money on the
bar and watched the saloonman, Tim Sullivan, come forward.
Sullivan's cheeks showed crimson in the shining lamplight; bright
feeling danced in his green eyes. He shoved the money back to
Keene. "Not in my place, friend. Your drinks are on the house. The
girl&mdash;she's all right?"</p>

<p>"She's all right."</p>

<p>"And everything else is all right," murmured Sullivan, his eyes
laughing. "That news came in ahead of you, friend. Whenever you
want a drink come to Sullivan's place. But never offer to pay for
it."</p>

<p>Small warning stirred through Keene. "Who brought in the
news?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Sullivan, "some of the Broken Bit boys. But I
wouldn't worry about them, friend. They took the train out of here
awhile back."</p>

<p>Keene rubbed the bar steadily with the ball of a thumb. He was
trying to recollect what troubled him, what one thing lay unsettled
and loose in the edge of his memory. Then he remembered.</p>

<p>"Morspeare&mdash;he's here?"</p>

<p>Sullivan said: "I ain't seen him. Well, friend, the world's
yours. Whut you goin' to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I'll be riding on."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Sullivan and ceased to smile. "I am sorry to hear of
it. That is the second thing which makes me feel bad. The first was
Ben Borders' death. Well, it is a sentiment, maybe, but an
Irishman's heart is like that."</p>

<p>Keene re-crossed the street and had supper in the hotel. There
was no need for hurry and nothing to do; yet he ate rapidly,
oppressed by the very idleness of his mind&mdash;the complete
futility of the things he felt. He left the dining room and stood
in a corner of the lobby, rolling up a cigarette. He watched people
pass in and out, he was a shadow standing alone. If the storm died
by morning he would be riding on; if it continued he faced the kind
of a day he dreaded&mdash;a motionless day in which his thoughts
would turn back to the ford.</p>

<p>He moved into the street and faced the long, solid drive of
snow. Two women passed him, both crying their words against the
wind. He crossed the street, the gush of the saloon lights making a
round yellow stain in the racing wall of snow. He came to the
saloon doors and stood by them, pulled by the warmth and cheer
inside; what he felt was a loneliness that had never troubled him
before. It was like a sense of loss, of something taken out of him
and leaving him hollow. All his thoughts went back to the ford; as
often as he pulled them away they returned arrow-straight to that
cabin standing in the wild heart of night; warm within and holding
all that meant anything to him.</p>

<p>"Well," he said aloud, "that was the way her father was. Pillar
to post and hell to breakfast. That's the way I am, and that is why
I left."</p>

<p>He skirted the saloon, continuing into the wind's strengthening
push; he went nighthawking through the darkness and came to the
entrance of the stable whose doors were three-quarters closed. He
slid through the small opening into the sallow light of a single
lantern swinging from a rafter. He was out of the wind but the
coldness seemed greater because of the quietness here. The hostler
moved uncertainly forward from the stable's black rear end.</p>

<p>"Don't want anything," said Keene and watched the hostler fade
into darkness. Keene walked the length of the stable's runway; and
turned about. The doors, he thought, stood wider than they had a
moment before; and then as he moved toward them he saw the huge
shape of Jesse Morspeare slide from an empty stall.</p>

<p>Back of Keene, in the darkness, the hostler cried: "Watch out!"
The echo of his voice clacked barrenly through the stable and died.
Keene had stopped, all weight on the balls of his feet. Morspeare
was under the down-thrown cone of the lantern's strange glow; the
big man's eyes showed red and hungry, they were the hating eyes of
a deserted dog, expressive of everything and expressive of nothing.
He made only one sound&mdash;a flat murmur in his throat&mdash;and
his shoulders went down as he slapped at the gun in his holster.
His arm came up with a great jerk. He fired at once, and too soon,
the bullet spraying up the old spongy dirt of the runway.</p>

<p>Keene hit him with his shot; he hit the big man in the chest,
the heavy wallop of the forty-five's slug driving Jesse one short
step backward and half around. Big Jesse set himself, he called up
all that massive power of which he was so proud and so sure. He had
never doubted it and his slow-moving mind, fixed on one thing
alone, never doubted it now as he fought himself squarely around to
Keene and tried to lift the gun. It was a dead weight in his hand;
the last of his strength went into the trigger and sound swelled
like a dynamite blast in the stable and dirt slashed Keene across
the knees. Looking across the space, Keene saw the big man's eyes
go dead as they stared. He fell in a vast heavy sweep, never
knowing&mdash;Keene thought&mdash;what had happened to him.</p>

<p>Horses pitched in the stalls. The hostler yelled out his fear.
"Look out&mdash;look out!" Wind shook the stable and men ran
through the doorway's aperture. Keene watched Sullivan bend over
Morspeare and rise up.</p>

<p>"Friend," said Sullivan, "I didn't know he was in town."</p>

<p>Keene shrugged his shoulders. The place got suddenly crowded,
the smell of burnt powder grew heavy; it clung in blued rings to
the air. Somebody murmured: "Never could trust Jesse&mdash;never
knew whether he was behind you or in front of you. He was sly like
that."</p>

<p>Keene heard himself say: "He was DePard's man."</p>

<p>Sullivan, who knew men thoroughly, slowly nodded. "Why, yes,
that's right. He was Grat's man. You got to give him credit. He
never forgot that."</p>

<p>Keene went through the gathering townsmen. He shouldered his way
past them and left the stable. People were still running up through
the snow; they were dark, thin shadows around him in the rising
storm. He cut into the hotel and walked up the stairs, the weight
of his body heavier than before on his legs. In the room he
discovered he still held the gun in his hand. He threw it on the
bed. He turned up the lampwick to erase the dismal shadows of the
room, he looked around at the faded and dirty wallpaper; and he saw
again the bullet hole in the wall, with its inscription:
"Ventilated by Smoky Jules from Medora. 1882. Forty-four barrel on
a forty-five frame. Never bet aces in another man's game."</p>

<p>What made a man write his name in a dingy hotel room? Keene
faced the wall, and knew why. Smoky Jules was a drifter with
nothing behind him and nothing ahead of him. Nobody remembered him
and nobody cared what became of him. So he wrote his name on the
wall because he was lonely and his life empty, hoping that somebody
might see it and remember it. Now Smoky Jules was a ghost walking
the trail somewhere. All he had to show for his life was a name on
a wall.</p>

<p>Keene sat on the edge of the bed. He rolled a cigarette and
smoked it, bent over on the bed with his arms idle across his
knees. He thought of big Jesse Morspeare. That was something in the
cards, that shooting. It was in the book, but Keene pitied the man
and felt no pride for what he had done. He felt small and
sick&mdash;and useless. "That's the way it's going to be. Just like
that. Every place and any place."</p>

<p>All the fun had gone. The trail didn't mean anything anymore.
Once there was a time when he waited for morning, so that he could
ride; once he had been eager to top a ridge and look down at the
next valley green and tawny under sunlight, with farther mists
beckoning him on. It wasn't like that anymore, it never would be
like that anymore. He had ridden too long. From this point on there
wasn't anything to look for. He had left too much behind him at the
ford.</p>

<p>Somebody climbed the stairs and moved slowly along the hall,
past his room; and came back and knocked. He said: "Come right in."
He had his back to the door and he didn't look up. He held his
hands over his knees, smoke curling around his face.</p>

<p>"Well, Jim," said Aurora's voice.</p>

<p>He came off the bed in a single quick lift; and found her at the
doorway. She wore a heavy coat and a muffler was wrapped around her
head; and all he saw was the dark line of her eyes and a red small
spot on each cheek. Snow covered her, slowly turning to water.</p>

<p>He said: "You didn't ride in alone, Aurora?"</p>

<p>She unwrapped the muffler, she unbuttoned the coat. She stood
still, looking across the room at him; and he couldn't tell, from
that ink-black coloring in her eyes, whether she hated him at this
moment or whether she liked him. It was that kind of look,
containing so many things.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I came alone."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't ever do that in this weather."</p>

<p>Her shoulders lifted expressively. "If it is always going to be
like this for us I suppose I had better get used to the worst of it
now. Here I am."</p>

<p>"Aurora," he said, very slowly, "do you know what I am?"</p>

<p>"I know most of you, Jim."</p>

<p>"Then you should have stayed at the ford."</p>

<p>She gave him a half-angered glance. "Don't you suppose I wanted
to stay there? Why did I let you kiss me? That was my last try,
Jim. I thought it might be enough to hold you in one place. But it
wasn't." Her voice dropped lower and lower. "So I guess it has to
be this way."</p>

<p>"I didn't want to spoil the rest of your life, Aurora. That's
the reason I left."</p>

<p>"Was it?" she breathed. "Was it really that?"</p>

<p>"You wanted a steady man."</p>

<p>She looked around the room. "How well I know rooms like this. A
thousand of them. That's why I moved to the ford. The one thing I
wanted above every other thing was to forget what this kind of a
life was like. But here I am. Don't you know now why I came?"</p>

<p>He moved toward her. He took her arm and pulled her with him,
across the room. He pointed at the bullet mark and the inscription
of Smoky Jules. "There's a man like me. That's all he's got to show
for himself. The fun's gone out of riding. Well, a man can keep
going until he runs into something and leaves a big chunk of
himself behind. Then everything after that is a matter of looking
backward. This night's been the worst I've ever had."</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, and looked up at him, her face taking on light,
"do you mean that?"</p>

<p>He was no longer alone. That made all the difference in the
room, in the night, in his own body. He had been weary; he was no
longer weary. He felt once more that old hope, that old flare of
excitement. But without her he would never have experienced it; and
this was how he knew he had ridden his last hill. He turned her
with his arms, feeling the quick pressure of her hands forcing him
back. She said, intent and anxious: "Don't fool yourself again,
Jim. You could never be a homesteader."</p>

<p>"No," he admitted, "I didn't mean that. I was thinking of the
rough country behind Bowley's. I was thinking of the Short Hills."
Then he said: "Is that too far for you to move, Aurora? That's
where I want to stay and make my ranch."</p>

<p>"No, not too far," she answered, and let the pressure die from
her hands.</p>

<p>He stood back, humbled by what he knew about her. She smiled, a
sweet and anxious receptivity on her lips. He looked fully through
her reserve; it had dropped for him and he caught the strong, rich
eagerness inside. So smiling, she waited for him and, growing
impatient of waiting, brought him nearer with the pressure of her
hands.</p>
