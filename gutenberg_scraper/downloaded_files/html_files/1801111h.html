<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="first">A COLLECTION of twenty-one stories which bridge,
in the process of their writing, thirty years of life, might be
expected to offer at least the element of variety. How far the
present volume succeeds or fails in this respect I am not just
now concerned in arguing, but the occasion has reminded me...</p>

<p>When I was very young (how young, the reader may gather from
the context) I was for some time possessed by one definite
ambition: to have to my credit a single example of every kind of
literary exercise. To anticipate repeating any of these facile
achievements would seem to have held no charm, and at this flight
of time I am fax from being certain what the youth who is now so
dim a shadow in memory's background would have included in his
quaint and ingenuous assemblage. But there were to be, I am sure,
an historical romance; a psychological study; a "shilling
shocker" (as it was then called); an intensely pathetic book
<i>(Misunderstood</i> was doubtless still being spoken of); an
epic (or was the thing I meant called a saga, I wondered?);
something quite unlike anything that had ever been written
before; a classic (I have already pleaded infancy); a "best
seller" (but that distressing cliche was as yet uncoined); a
novel showing my intimate knowledge of the world, women, and sin
in general; one of each kind of play; and, if I may drop my voice
a <i>Punch</i> joke, a prize <i>Tit-Bit,</i> and a <i>Family
Herald Supplement.</i></p>

<p>I suppose it is credible that at that age (whatever it may
have been) abnormal reticence should go hand in hand with
appalling candour. We must have talked; otherwise how should I
have known that Batget (since become wealthy as a lard importer)
made a practice of rising an hour before he need each day, solely
to avoid encountering a rejected manuscript at the domestic
breakfast table? I must have talked; otherwise how should Melwish
have known anything of these callow aspirations?</p>

<p>Melwish was the enigma of our genial gatherings. Middle-aged,
successful and clear-cut, he appeared to find some interest in
the society of the young, the impecunious and the half-baked. We
knew that he was a prolific fiction writer; indeed it was usual
to pick up a magazine of a sort that did not contain one of his
unsophisticated little love stories; and we wondered how on earth
he did it&mdash;not in the writing but the marketing thereof. So
simple, so sheerly artless was he both in matter and in manner as
to give rise to the occasional heresy that there really must be
something in them after all or no one would accept his stuff. But
on the whole we classed it as pretty hopeless tripe, although we
did not fail to congratulate Melwish whenever the occasion fitly
offered. Our own efforts lay in the direction of originality and
something better than the editors were used to: Lang's <i>How to
Fail in Literature</i> had obviously reached us then, but Leonard
Merrick's <i>Cynthia</i> certainly had not. Melwish took it all
quietly and easily; he was essentially a listener and gave
nothing in return&mdash;except a rescuing donation when the state
of the society's funds urgently required it.</p>

<p>How it came about I have long ago forgotten, but one night I
found myself walking with Melwish down the Strand. Possibly I had
been speaking of his work; more probably of my own. In any case
he would have been the listener.</p>

<p>At the corner of one of the southward streets he stopped; my
way lay up Chancery Lane, so that we seemed to be on the point of
parting.</p>

<p>"Where do you dig?" he suddenly asked, detaining me. "Are you
in any hurry?"</p>

<p>"Up in Bloomsbury," I replied, with just the discreet touch of
ambiguity. "No, it doesn't matter what time I get there.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Do you care to see my place?" he asked. "You might have a
drop of something to carry you along."</p>

<p>This unexpected offer was rather exciting in its way. Generous
enough after his own fashion, Melwish did not incline towards
private hospitality; even the quarter of London he homed in was a
matter of occasional speculation. He alone among us possessed a
club address.</p>

<p>"I should be delighted if it's not troubling you," I
replied&mdash;we were always rather on our company manners with
this seasoned adult. "I had no idea that you lived anywhere round
here."</p>

<p>"I don't; it's only a workroom that I have...I suppose," he
added thoughtfully, "you really wonder that my particular sort of
sludge should require any particular place to turn it out in? I
expect you youngsters guy it pretty well when I'm not there."</p>

<p>This made matters rather easier, as I could be virtuously
indignant.</p>

<p>"I bet we jolly well wish we could do half as well," I
exclaimed, possibly with a mental reservation that I spoke
financially. "We only wonder that you should ever think it worth
while to come among us."</p>

<p>We had reached Melwish's outer door. He turned in the act of
opening it to face me as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I go," he said dryly, "to hear you fellows talk." A whole
diatribe could not have expressed more.</p>

<p>The workroom proved to be a very comfortably-appointed study,
reached through a little ante-room, furnished as a hall.
Everything proclaimed the occupant's success in life. Melwish lit
the gas-fire and pulled up an easy-chair for me. While he engaged
himself with spirit-lamp and glasses I looked frankly about the
room. An illustrated interview was among the things I meant to
do, and I speculated whether my host's standing would carry it.
At all events there would be no harm in laying a foundation.</p>

<p>"Do you find it necessary to sit on any particular chair or to
adopt any especial position while you write?" I inquired, apropos
of the room at large. These intriguing, details always bulked in
an interview with an author in those days.</p>

<p>"My dear lad," he replied tolerantly, "I haven't the least
doubt that I could write equally well if I stood on my head all
the time."</p>

<p>"Then you have no pet superstition or favourite mascot that
you rely on?" I persisted.</p>

<p>"No," he grunted, conveying the impression that he thought I
was talking hectic nonsense; and then I saw him pause and think,
and turning down the spirit-lamp for a moment he came across to
me.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, by Jupiter," he admitted slowly. "I was
forgetting that. You see the inkstand there? Well, I have the
strongest possible conviction that in order to keep my work what
is termed 'up to magazine standard,' I must write from that.</p>

<p>"This is jolly interesting," I said&mdash;the interview
promised to be fashioning. "May I look at it?" Melwish nodded and
went back to the brew.</p>

<p>Without doubt it was worth inspecting&mdash;in a way. It was
absolutely the ugliest inkpot that I had ever seen, and it was
probably the most inconvenient. Its owner pointed out, later on,
that in order to fill it one had to use a funnel, and that when
filled it was difficult, except by way of a pen, to get the ink
out again; but he was mistaken in this, for I got a considerable
amount out on to my grey trousers quite easily. It was extremely
top-heavy, very liable to catch passing objects, and would be
unusually intricate in cleaning. All this was accounted for by
the fact that it had been fashioned by a "craftsman."</p>

<p>So much for its qualities. In shape it was modelled as a
turnip. It was, in fact, a silver turnip. A few straggling leaves
sprouted from the crown and an attenuated root got into the way
beneath. A hinged lid towards the top disclosed the ink-well and
the whole thing stood on three incongruous feet. Before I had
done with it I discovered an inscription across the front, and
lifting it (hence the contretemps) I read the single line of
inconspicuous script:</p> <br>

<p class="cp"><i>Remember the Man with the Hoe.</i></p> <br>

<p>"Jolly fine thing," I remarked, when I had admired it
sufficiently. "I don't wonder that you are fond of it."</p>

<p>"I'm not," he said. "The damned thing would be an eyesore in a
pig-sty. All the same it has served its purpose. Yes, B., every
ounce of my success I owe to that incredible abortion."</p>

<p>"Go on!" I exclaimed. The interview was positively
creaming.</p>

<p>Melwish added the last touch to the concocting of the drinks
and indicated mine&mdash;possibly one was slightly less potent
than the other.</p>

<p>"I've used that metallurgic atrocity for nearly twenty years
now, four days a week, six hours a day, and not a soul on earth
knows why. But I'm going to tell you, B., because you talk like
a&mdash;well, something in the way I did myself at about your
age."</p>

<p>"Good," I contributed to encourage him; and not to overdo it I
said no more.</p>

<p>"When I was about your age," he continued, "I was doing pretty
much as you are, and with about the same result. Then going along
the Edgeware Road late one starry night, with Swift walking on
one side of me and Defoe upon the other, I suddenly got an
inspiration for a masterpiece. I expect you know how they
come&mdash;all at once clean into your head without any making up
on your part."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I admitted, in some surprise, "but I didn't know
that&mdash;that anyone else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everyone," he retorted bluntly. "This idea involved a full-
length book, such as would take me at least two years to write. I
ruminated on it for the next few months and it grew spontaneously
in the usual way. Then I began the writing, did the opening
chapters, and stuck hopelessly.</p>

<p>"I saw at once what the matter was. Summer had come and I
couldn't get on with the thing here in London. It needed space
and solitude. I had a few pounds to spare; I packed up and went
off into the country, intending to stay at some cottage for a
couple of months and come back with the difficulties surmounted
and the whole line in trim.</p>

<p>"I got my room easily enough and settled down there at once,
but of course I could hardly expect to do anything the first
night&mdash;the light was poor and the place so damn quiet that
you had to listen to it. The next morning I set out to take the
manuscript off into the fields and get it going there. It was a
simple matter to find a field-path, but I had to go a
considerable distance to get the exact spot I fancied. Then I
discovered that it was too hot and brilliant in the sun and not
quite pleasant out of it. There were more distractions of one
sort and another than you would have credited; in the end I fell
asleep, thinking out some detail of the plot, and when I woke it
was about time to get back for dinner.</p>

<p>"On my way in, the path led through a turnip-field where a
venerable labourer was hoeing. In the interests of local colour I
stopped to pass a few words with this ancient and to observe his
system. He walked between two rows of young plants and very
dexterously, considering his archaic tool, he chopped them all
down with the exception of a single turnip every foot or so. He
used judgment too and would let the space be a little more or a
little less in order to select a particularly vigorous growth if
one offered, but I saw that at least twenty young hopes must
wither for the single one that grew&mdash;a saddening thought,
especially at our job, B. Then, just ahead of us, I noticed an
exceptionally well-grown young plant, standing by itself. It was
the finest of any about, and I saw with quite a personal
satisfaction that it would come at the right interval...Without a
pause Old Mortality chopped it down.</p>

<p>"'Why, man alive!' I exclaimed, 'you've sacrificed the most
promising of the lot!'</p>

<p>"'Oh, aye," he replied&mdash;I won't attempt the barbarous
dialect&mdash;'it was a likely enough young turnip, but don't you
see, master, it was out of line with all the rest? Even it it
didn't get cut off by hand sooner or later, the horse-hoe would
be bound to finish it when once it came along.' And then, B., the
hob-nailed philosopher uttered this profound truth: 'An ordinary
plant where it's wanted has a sight more chance of coming to
something than a giant where it isn't.'</p>

<p>"I walked on with my ideas suddenly brought out into the clear
light of day, and perhaps for the first time in my life I really
set before my sober judgment a definition of what I wanted to do
and what were the pros and cons of ever doing it...After dinner I
burned the manuscript of the masterpiece, as much as I had
written, and with it all the notes and jottings I had made. Then
I sat down to write a short story for the magazines.</p>

<p>"Of course I knew well enough what sort of stories the
magazines wanted. Everyone knows and in a general way everyone
can write them. The line of demarcation isn't whether you can or
can't, but whether you do or don't. Outside my cottage window was
an orchard, and I wrote a story about two lovers who met there
for the last time. She thought that she ought to give him up for
some insane reason or other, and he thought that she oughtn't.
They talked all round it and when, finally, he saw how noble she
was and they were parting irrevocably, she suddenly threw herself
into his arms and said that she couldn't, and he saw how much
nobler she was. There was a dog that looked on and expressed
various sympathetic emotions, and so forth. There wasn't a word
in it that a tram conductor couldn't have written, and from
beginning to end it didn't contain a page whose removal would
have made the slightest difference to the sense. It was soothing
in the way that the sound of a distant circular saw, or watching
an endless chain of dredging buckets at work, soothes. A reader
falling asleep over the story (an extremely probable occurrence)
would wake up without the' faintest notion of whether he had read
all of it, some of it, or none of it. I didn't even trouble to
find names for the two imbeciles: they were just 'the Man' and
'the Girl.'</p>

<p>"It took a single afternoon to write that four-thousand-word
story&mdash;of course there was no need to read it over&mdash;and
I addressed it at once to an editor whom I knew slightly. I had
ample time before the mail went to stroll down to the village
office and send it off. Afterwards I wrote a short, light article
with the title, 'Why do Long-nosed Girls Marry Photographers?' It
had to be written in the dark, but that made no difference.</p>

<p>"The next day I wrote the same story over again, giving the
couple names this time, putting them on a romantic Cornish shore
instead of in an orchard, and changing the dog into a sea-gull. I
had no wish to repeat myself literally in any detail, but when
you reflect that it is impossible to remember a story of that
kind ten minutes after you have read it, you will see that it is
unnecessary to take any especial pains to avoid some slight
resemblance. As a matter of fact I have been writing that
particular story at least once a month ever since.</p>

<p>"Three days later I heard from the editor in question. He
congratulated me on having hit off their style so successfully at
last. Would two guineas a thousand suit? And he hoped that I
would let him see anything further in the same pleasant vein. The
article was not so promptly dealt with where it went, but in due
course I received notice of acceptance, subject to a trifling
change of title, which would make it more attractive to the bulk
of their readers. When the proof came along I noticed that it was
headed, 'Why do Photographers Marry Long-nosed Girls?'"</p>

<p>"Well?" I prompted.</p>

<p>"That's all," he replied. "Except, of course,"&mdash;with a
complacent look around the attractive room&mdash;"the et ceteras
of life."</p>

<p>There were several things that I would have liked to know,
especially exactly how much money he was making now, but Melwish
seemed to think that he had told his story, and, after all, there
was always a certain air of detachment about the man in his
attitude towards us.</p>

<p>"Think it over, B.," he concluded, as I rose to go a little
later. "You're only a young beggar yet."</p>

<p>"Jolly decent of you to take the trouble," was my dutiful
reply. "Still," I reminded him, "you did say that you liked to
hear us young beggars talk."</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted, dropping into that caustic tone of his;
"but I doubt if you quite appreciate why."</p>

<p>Certainly I have wondered about that once or twice since.</p>

<p>He came down to the lower door to let me out. It had been
raining in the meanwhile and a forlorn creature who was evidently
sheltering for the time almost fell into our arms. He offered a
box of matches in extenuation of his presence.</p>

<p>"No," said Melwish very sharply, "and remember what I told you
about hanging round this doorway, Thompson. A wretched fellow,"
he explained, as the miserable being shambled off into the night;
"impossible to help that sort. I put him in the way of a nice job
delivering circulars once and he threw it up within a week. You'd
hardly credit it, B., but that wastrel fancies his real forte is
to write&mdash;verse, if you please, at that! Pretty pass we're
coming to. Well, so long."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">THERE is, you will (I hope) notice, a certain
system in the arrangement of this book of stories. It is
not&mdash;if an author may speak more than very casually of his
own work without indelicacy&mdash;intended essentially as a
collection of quite the best stories I might perhaps have chosen,
nor is it, I am more than sure, a collection of anything like the
worst that were available; it consists rather of a suitable
example taken at convenient intervals over the whole time that I
have been engaged in writing stories&mdash;a span of thirty
years. In every case, therefore, the date at which the tale was
written is attached&mdash;the place of writing being added
merely, in the words of Mr. Finch McComas, "to round off the
sentence." Each tale thus becomes a sort of milestone by which,
should you happen to maintain so much interest, you can estimate
your author's progress&mdash;backwards or forwards, as you may
decide.</p>

<p>When the suggestion of this collection first arose there had
already been published two volumes of what are now generally
referred to as "Kai Lung" stories, and another pair of what might
with more propriety be described as "Max Carrados" tales. There
being no lack of other material available it seemed fitting that
in this instance all stories of those two distinctive classes
should be ruled out, and no doubt this would have been the plan
had not, about that time, the Mystery arisen.</p>

<p>It is a little difficult, as the hand holds the pen, to
appreciate a Mystery in relation to oneself. The nearest parallel
that occurs is the case of the dentist (as described in
<i>Punch)</i> who administered gas to himself preparatory to
extracting one of his own teeth. Being intimately concerned, but
quite unconscious of what is going on, I am therefore driven to
contemporary record. So far as I have any evidence, Mr. Edward
Shanks was the first to use the fatal word. Referring to <i>The
Wallet of Kai Lung,</i> he would seem to have written: "Its name
was therefore passed from mouth to mouth in a mysterious way, but
few people had ever seen it or knew what it was like."</p>

<p>If this is indeed the fount and origin of the legend the
historic reference may be proved in the <i>Queen</i> of December
the 2nd, 1922. It sounds harmless enough, and in any case I take
the opportunity of publicly forgiving Mr. Shanks whatever may
result, but Dark Forces were evidently at work, for a few weeks
later Mr. Grant Richards found it necessary (in the <i>Times
Literary Supplement)</i> to declare: "Meanwhile I am asked all
sorts of questions about the book and its author. Is there really
such a person as Ernest Bramah? and so on."</p>

<p>The "so on" has a pleasantly speculative ring&mdash;to me,
that is to say. At all events, whatever Mr. Richards had been
asked, his diplomatic reference answered nothing, so that, later,
he is induced to state without reserve: "Finally, I do assure his
readers that such a person as Ernest Bramah does really and truly
exist. I have seen and touched him." This should settle the
matter, you would say? Not a bit of it. Turn to "N. G. R.-S." in
the <i>Westminster Gazette:</i> "He assures us that there is such
a person as Ernest Bramah. Well, there may be! I myself still
believe..." (This break does not represent omitted matter, but
"N. G. R.-S.'s" too-sinister-for-words private belief.) "Anyway,
you can now buy <i>The Wallet</i> for seven-and-sixpence and form
your own opinion of the reasons which keep the author of such a
book so closely mysterious behind his unusual name."</p>

<p>And then, surely the most astonishing of all, there is Miss
Rose Macaulay: Miss Macaulay the relentless precision, so
flawlessly exact that she must by now hate the phrase "hard
brilliance," author of <i>Potterism</i> (in whose dedication I
have never ceased to cherish an ifinitesimal claim), retailing
"They say" with the cheerful irresponsibility of a village
gossip. "N. G. R.-S.", it will be seen, gilds the pill of
innuendo with a compliment; Miss Macaulay administers a more
salutary dose: "The crude, stilted, Conan Doyleish English of his
detective stories certainly goes far to bear out the common
theory that Mr. Bramah has a literary dual personality"
<i>(Nation and Athenaeum).</i></p>

<p>Finally (perhaps), to my hand as I write this Preface there
comes a letter conveying the excogitation of an American
publisher, representative of a firm which has already issued
three books bearing my name. Casually, quite naturally, among
other mundane business details, he drops the inspiring remark: "I
have always had a feeling that you were a mythical person." So,
in the language of a bygone age, that's that. After all, there is
something not unattractive in the idea of being a mythical
person...though from the heroic point of view one might have
wished that it could have been "a mythological personage."...</p>

<p>Should the reader, still maintaining the intellectual
curiosity which I have credited to him, here exclaim, "What is
all this about and why?" I can only assure him that I have not
the faintest notion. He and I are equally in the dark.</p>

<p>Apparently, there is no simple middle way, no sheltered,
obvious path. Either I am to have no' existence, or I am to have
decidedly too much: on the one hand banished into space as a
mythical creation; on the other regarded askance' as the leader
of a double (literary) life. But there is one retort still left
whereby to confound the non-existers and the dualists
alike&mdash;I can produce both a "Kai Lung" and a "Max Carrados"

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. MING TSEUEN AND THE
EMERGENCY</h2>

<p class="first">IT was the custom of Ming Tseuen to take his
stand at an early hour each day in the open Market of Nang-kau,
partly because he was industrious by nature and also since he had
thereby occasionally found objects of inconspicuous value which
others had carelessly left unprotected over-night. Enterprise
such as this deserved to prosper, but so far, owing to some
apathy on the part of the fostering deities, silver had only come
to Ming Tseuen in dreams and gold in visions. Yet with frugality,
and by acquiring the art of doing without whatever he was unable
to procure, he had supported himself from the earliest time he
could remember up to the age of four short of a score of years.
In mind he was alert and not devoid of courage, the expression of
his face mild and unconcerned, but in stature he lacked the
appearance of his age, doubtless owing to the privations he had
frequently endured.</p>

<p>Next to Ming Tseuen on the one side was the stall of Lieu, the
dog-butcher, on the other that of a person who removed corroding
teeth for the afflicted. This he did with his right hand while at
the same time he beat upon a large iron gong with his left, so
that others in a like plight who might be approaching should not
be distressed by hearing anything of a not absolutely encouraging
strain. About his neck he wore a lengthy string of massive teeth
to indicate his vigour and tenacity, but to Ming he privately
disclosed that these were the fangs of suitable domestic animals
which he had obtained to enlarge himself in the eyes of the
passer-by. Ming in return told him certain things about his own
traffic which were not generally understood.</p>

<p>Across the Way a barber was accustomed to take his stand, his
neighbours being a melon-seller to the east, and to the west a
caster of nativities and lucky day diviner. Also near at hand a
bamboo worker plied his useful trade, an incense vendor extolled
his sacred wares, a money-changer besought men to enrich
themselves at his expense, and a fan-maker sang a song about the
approaching heat and oppression of the day. From time to time the
abrupt explosion of a firework announced the completion of an
important bargain, proclaimed a ceremony, or indicated some
protective rite, while the occasional passage of a high official
whose rank required a chariot wider than the Way it traversed,
afforded an agreeable break in the routine of those who found
themselves involved. At convenient angles beggars pointed out
their unsightliness to' attract the benevolently inclined, story-
tellers and minstrels spread their mats and raised their enticing
chants, the respective merits of contending crickets engaged the
interest of the speculative, and a number of ingenious
contrivances offered chances that could not fail&mdash;so far as
the external appearance went&mdash;to be profitable even to the
inexperienced if they but persisted long enough. It will thus be
seen that almost all the simpler requirements of an ordinary
person could be satisfied about the spot.</p>

<p>Ming Tseuen's venture differed essentially from all these
occupations. In Nang-kau, as elsewhere, there might be found a
variety of persons&mdash;chiefly the aged and infirm&mdash;who
were suddenly inspired by a definite craving to perform a
reasonable number of meritorious actions before they Passed
Beyond. The mode of benevolence most esteemed consisted in
preserving life or in releasing the innocent out of captivity,
down even to the humblest creatures of their kind; for all the
Sages and religious essayists of the past have approved these
deeds of virtue as assured of celestial recognition. As it would
manifestly be unwise for the aged and infirm to engage upon so
ambiguous a quest haphazard&mdash;even if it did not actually
bring them into conflict with the established law&mdash;those who
were of Ming Tseuen's way of commerce had sought to provide an
easy and mutually beneficial system by which so humane an impulse
should be capable of wide and innocuous expression. This took the
form of snaring alive a diversity of birds and lesser beings of
the wild and offering them for sale, with a persuasive placard,
attractively embellished with wise and appropriate sayings from
the lips of the Philosophers, inviting those who were at all
doubtful of their record in the Above World to acquire merit,
while there was still time, by freeing a victim from its bondage;
and so convincing were the arguments employed and so moderate the
outlay involved when compared with the ultimate benefits to be
received, that few who were feeling in any way unwell at the time
were able to resist the allurement.</p>

<p>Owing to the poverty of his circumstances, Ming Tseuen was
only able to furnish his stall with a few small birds of the less
expensive sorts, but, to balance this deficiency, he could always
traffic at a certain profit, for so devoted to his cause were the
little creatures he displayed, as a result of his zealous
attention to their natural wants, that when released they
invariably returned after a judicious interval and took up their
accustomed stations within the cage again. In such a manner the
mornings became evenings and the days passed into moons, but
though Ming sustained existence he could add little or nothing to
his store.</p>

<p>Among the crowd that passed along the Way there were many who
stopped from time to time before Ming Tseuen's stall to admire
the plumage of his company of birds or to read the notice he
exposed without any real intention of benefiting by the prospect
he held out, and by long practice the one concerned could
immediately detect their insincerity and avoid entering into a
conversation which would inevitably be wasted. Thus imperceptibly
the narration leads up to the appearance of Hya, an exceptionally
graceful maiden of the house of Tai, whose willowy charm is only
crudely indicated by the name of Orange Blossom then already
bestowed upon her. Admittedly the part she had to play in this
stage of Ming Tseuen's destiny was neither intricate nor deep,
but by adding to the firmness of his purpose when the emergency
arose she unwittingly supplied a final wedge. No less pointed
than when he first fashioned it is the retort of the shrewd Tso-
yan: "Not what he is but how he became it concerns the
adjudicating gods."</p>

<p>Orange Blossom had more than once passed the stall of Ming
Tseuen before the day when they encountered, and she had paused
to observe the engaging movements of the band of feathered
prisoners there, but for the re son already indicated he had not
turned aside from whatever task he was then engaged on to
importune her. When she spoke it was as though Ming for the first
time then beheld her, and thenceforward his eyes did not forsake
her face while she remained.</p>

<p>"How comes it, keeper of the cage, that your stall is
destitute of custom," she inquired melodiously; "seeing that it
is by far the most delightful of them all, while less than an
arrow's flight away so gross a commerce as the baked extremities
of pigs attracts a clamorous throng?"</p>

<p>"The explanation is twofold, gracious being," answered Ming,
resolving for the future to abstain from the food she thus
disparaged, though it was, indeed, his favourite dish. "In the
first place it is as the destinies ordain; in the second it is
still too early after daybreak for the elderly and weak to
venture forth."</p>

<p>"Yet why should only the venerable and decrepit seek
uprightness?" demanded the maiden, with a sympathetic gesture of
reproach towards so illiberal an outlook. "Cannot the immature
and stalwart equally aspire?"</p>

<p>"Your words are ropes of truth," assented Ming admiringly,
"but none the less has it appropriately been written, 'At
seventeen one may defy demons; at seventy he trembles merely at
the smell of burning sulphur.' Doubtless, then, it is your humane
purpose&mdash;?" and partly from a wish to detain so incomparable
a vision, and also because there was no reason why the encounter
should not at the same time assume a remunerative bend, he
directed her unfathomable eyes towards that detail of the scroll
where the very moderate rates at which merit could be acquired
were prominently displayed.</p>

<p>"Alas," exclaimed Hya no less resourcefully, "she who bears
the purse is by now a distance to the west. Happily some other
time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perchance your venerated father or revered grand-sire might
be rejoiced to grasp the opportunity&mdash;" he urged, but in the
meanwhile the maiden had passed beyond his voice along the
Way.</p>

<p>Ming would have remained in a high-minded contemplation,
somewhat repaid to see, if not her distant outline, at least the
direction in which she would progress, but almost at once the
oleose Lieu was at his elbow.</p>

<p>"If," remarked that earthly-souled person with a cunning look,
"you should happen to possess influence with the one who has just
resumed her path, it might mean an appreciable stream of cash
towards your threadbare sleeve. The amount of meat that she and
her leisurely and opulent connection must require cannot be
slight, and there is no reason why we should not secure the co
tract and divide the actual profit equally among us."</p>

<p>"So far from that being the case," replied Ming, in a markedly
absent voice, "she to whom you quite gratuitously refer cannot
even think of the obscene exhibits of your sordid industry
without a refined shudder of polished loathing, and those of her
house, though necessarily more robust, are' doubtless similarly
inclined. Reserve your carnivorous schemes for the gluttonous and
trite, thou cloven-lipped, opaque-eyed puppy-snatcher."</p>

<p>Instead of directing a stream of like abuse in turn, as he
might logically have done, the artless-minded Lieu flung his arms
about the other's neck, and despite that one's unceasing protests
embraced him repeatedly.</p>

<p>"Thus and thus was it with this person also, in the days of
his own perfervid youth," declared the sympathetic dog-butcher
when he ceased from the exertion. "She was the swan-like daughter
of a lesser underling, and it was my custom to press into her
expectant hand a skewer of meat when we encountered in the stress
around the great door of the Temple...But that was in the days
before a mountain dragon altered the river's course: doubtless by
now she is the mother of a prolific race of grandsons and my name
and bounty are forgotten."</p>

<p>"There is no possible similitude between the two," declared
Ming Tseuen indignantly. "The refinement of this one is so
excessive that she shivers at the very thought of food, and the
offer of a skewer of meat would certainly throw her into a
protracted torpor."</p>

<p>"How can that be maintained unless you have first made the
essay?" demanded Lieu with undiminished confidence. "In these
affairs it is often the least likely that respond phenomenally.
Were it not that a notorious huckster is at this moment turning
over my stock with widespread disparagement, I could astonish you
out of the storehouse of my adventurous past. In the meanwhile,
apply this salutary plaster to your rising ardour: could I have
but shown five taels of silver, she whom I coveted was mine, and
yet in the event she slipped hence from, me; but this one of
thine is by my certain information a daughter of the affluent
house of Tai, and a golden chain and shackle would not bridge the
space between her father's views and your own lowly station."</p>

<p>"Her place is set among the more brilliant stars," agreed Ming
briefly. "Nevertheless," he added with a new-born note of hope,
"is it not written within the Books, 'However far the heaven, the
eye can reach it'?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly," replied Lieu, pausing in his departure to return
a step, "the eye, Ming Tseuen&mdash;but not likewise the hand."
And endeavouring to impart an added meaning to his words by a
rapid movement of the nearer eyelid, the genial-witted dog-
butcher went on his way, leaving Ming with an inward conviction
that he was not a person of delicate perception or one with whom
it would be well to associate' too freely in the future.</p>

<p>It is aptly said, "After the lightning comes the thunder," and
events of a momentous trend were by no means lagging behind
Ming's steps that day. Even while he contended with the self-
opinionated Lieu, in a distant quarter of the city a wealthy
lacquer merchant, Kwok Shen by name, was seeking to shape afresh
this obscure and unknown youth's immediate fate, urged by the
pressing mould of his own insistent need. "It is easier for a
gnat to bend a marble tower than for a man to turn de tiny
aside," pronounced the Venerable, the Sagacious One, in the days
when knowledge was, but how many now, in the moment of their
test, acquiescently kowtow? Be that as it may, having perfected
and rehearsed his crafty plans, Kwok Shen set out.</p>

<p>It was becoming dusk, and Ming Tseuen would shortly erect a
barrier, when Kwok Shen drew near. As he approached the other
glanced round, and seeing close at hand an elderly and not too
vigorous merchant of the richer sort, he bowed obsequiously, for
it was among these that his readiest custom lay. At the same time
he recognised in Kwok Shen a stranger whom he had noticed
observing him from a distance more than once on recent days, and
undoubtedly this incident stirred an element of caution in his
mind.</p>

<p>"May your ever-welcome shadow come to rest upon this ill-made
stall," remarked Ming Tseuen auspiciously, and looking at him
keenly Kwok Shen halted there. "It only remains for my sadly
concave ears to drink in the music of your excessive orders,"
continued Ming. "Seven times seven felicities, esteemed."</p>

<p>"Greeting," replied Kwok Shen more concisely, though as an
afterthought he passed the formal salutation, "Do your in-and-out
taels overlap sufficiently?"</p>

<p>"'A shop can be opened on pretension, but ability alone can
keep it open,'" quoted Ming Tseuen in reply, although, not to
create the impression of negligent prosperity, he added, "Yet the
shrub one waters is ever more attractive than the forest
cedar."</p>

<p>"Admittedly," agreed the merchant politely, for not having
applied the leisure of his youth to an assimilation of the
Classics, he felt himself becoming immersed in a stream beyond
his depth and one that was carrying him away from the not too
straightforward object of his quest. "Your literary versatility
is worthy of all praise, but for the moment let us confine
ourselves to the precise if less resonant terms of commercial
usage," he suggested. "Here is a piece of silver for your
immediate profit. Thus our meeting cannot involve you in loss and
it may quickly tend to your incredible advancement."</p>

<p>"Proceed, munificence, proceed," exclaimed the delighted Ming.
"You speak a tongue that both the scholar and the witless can
grasp at once," and he transferred the money to his inner
sleeve.</p>

<p>"Is there about this spot a tea-house of moderate repute, one
affected neither by the keepers of the stalls nor by the most
successful class of traders, where we can talk unheard and at our
leisure?"</p>

<p>"Almost within sight the tea-house of the Transitory Virtues
offers what you describe. Had the invitation come from me, a
somewhat less pretentious one might have been chosen, but
doubtless to a person of your transparent wealth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lead on," said Kwok Shen consequentially. "The one beside you
is not accustomed to divide a mouse among four guests," and
having thus plainly put beyond all question that the settlement
did not affect himself, Ming was content to show the way.</p>

<p>The conversation that ensued was necessarily a slow and
dignified proceeding. Kwok Shen had so much to conceal, and Ming
Tseuen had so much to learn before he knew what it was prudent to
admit, that for an appreciable period their intercourse was
confined to pressing an interminable succession of cups of tea
upon each other. Ming, however, had the advantage of his literary
abilities, which enabled him to converse for an indefinite time
upon a subject without expressing himself in any way about it,
while Kwok Shen laboured under the necessity of having to achieve
a specific issue.</p>

<p>The position, as presently outlined by the merchant, stood
thus at its essential angles. He' was, as he declared, a trader
in gums and resins, and by a system of the judicious blending of
his several wares at that stage his fortunes were assured. Being
of an easy-going and abstemious nature, one wife alone had
satisfied his needs, and she in turn had lavished all her care
upon an only son, to whom the name of San had been applied.
Stricken by an obscure malady this one had languished, and in
spite of what every healing art could do had lately Passed
Above:</p>

<p>Kwok Shen suitably indicated by means of his facecloth and a
discarded plate that the effect of the blow upon himself had been
calamitous, but when he spoke of the despair of the lesser one of
his inner chamber his voice practically ceased to have any sound
attached to it. Very soon every interest in life forsook her; she
sank into an unnatural langour and not even the cry of a passing
comb vendor or the sound of earthenware being shattered by the
household slaves moved her to action. The investigation of
skilled exorcists, those who had made the malignant humours their
especial lore, all tended to one end: without delay another
should be found to take the lost one's place and thereby restore
the immortal principles of equilibrity whose disturbance had
unbalanced the afflicted mind. To this project she who was most
concerned had at last agreed, stipulating, however, that the
substitute should bear an exact resemblance to the departed
San.</p>

<p>Beyond this point there could be no feasible concealment of
the part that Ming Tseuen would be called upon to play, and that
person's alert mind began to prepare itself for the arrangement.
He had already composed the set terms of his aged father's
anguish and chosen a suitable apophthegm to describe his broken-
down mother's tears when the words of Kwok Shen's persuasive
voice recalled him.</p>

<p>"At the moment of abandoning the search as hopeless, chance
led this one's dejected feet into the market here. When these
misguided eyes first rested on your noble outward form, for a
highly involved moment it was as though some ambiguous Force must
have conveyed there the one we mourned, for his living
presentment seemed to stand revealed. So complicated became the
emotions that this person returned home at once, unable for the
time to arrange his sequences adequately. Since then he has more
than once come secretly and stood apart, observing from a
distance, and each occasion has added a more imperviable lacquer
to the surface of his first impression. In, the meanwhile, not
from any want of confidence let it be freely stated, but solely
in order to enlarge our knowledge of one so precious in our
sight, a series of discreet inquiries have been made. Rest
assured, therefore, Ming Tseuen, that everything connected with
your orphaned life and necessitous circumstances is known. Lo, I
have bared the recesses of my private mind; let your answering
word be likewise free from guile."</p>

<p>"How shall the drooping lotus bargain with the sender of the
rain?" replied Ming Tseuen becomingly. "I put myself implicitly
within your large and open hand...Any slight details of
adjustment can be more suitably proposed after hearing the exact
terms of your princely liberality."</p>

<p>By this sudden and miraculous arisement it came to pass that
Ming Tseuen was at once received into Kwok Shen's Sumptuously
appointed house as his adopted son. No less enchanted than
bewildered by the incredible r semblance was she of the inner
chamber when the moment came, and together the merchant and his
wife sought to mould Ming's habits to an even closer fiction of
the one whose name he now assumed.</p>

<p>"At such a rebuke from menial lips he whom we indicate unnamed
was wont to extend a contumacious tongue," perchance it might on
one occasion be, and, "His manner of pronouncing 'tsze' was
<i>thus,"</i> upon another. All San's toys and possessions
accrued to Ming's unquestioned use and he occupied the sleeping
chamber of the one whose robes he daily wore. While kindly and
indulgent on every other point, Kwok Shen imposed one close
restraint.</p>

<p>"It is not seemly that a merchant having this and that to his
position should be compelled to traffic for an heir among the
garbage of the market stalls, though necessity, as it is said,
can make a blind beggar see," observed the one concerned. "It
would be still more lamentable that this abasement should be
known to those around. For that reason we shall shortly go hence
into another place, where our past will be obscured; meanwhile
let the four outer walls of this not incommodious hovel mark the
limits of your discovering feet and within them hold no word of
converse with any from outside whom you chance to meet. In this
respect I speak along an iron rule that shall measure the
thickness of a single hair of deviation."</p>

<p>"Your richly mellow voice stays with me when your truly
graceful form is absent on a journey," replied Ming submissively.
"As the renowned Hung Wu is stated to have said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He who is wanting from our midst was not prone to express
himself in terms of classical analogy," corrected Kwok Shen
graciously, and Ming dutifully refrained.</p>

<p>It was not long before Ming Tseuen had occasion to recall this
charge, but as he was then in his own chamber with none other by,
its obligation was not so rigorous as it might otherwise have
seemed. He had drawn aside a stool that he might open a small
shutter and look out, but the Way beneath was austere and void of
entertainment, so that he would have retired again, when one
somewhat younger than himself went by, propelling along his path
an empty can.</p>

<p>"Ae ya, image-face!" he exclaimed, seeing Ming there and
stopping to regard him acrimoniously. "So thou art still among us
despite the pursuing demon, art thou? Where is the kite in the
form of a vampire with outstretched wings for which I bargained
with thee?"</p>

<p>"There is no kite such as you describe, nor have I ever
bargained with you for it," retorted Ming, who might require the
kite for his own future use. "Further, it is not permitted that I
should hold converse with another."</p>

<p>"There is the kite, for these deficient hands have held the
cord that stayed it, and touching the bargain we together ate the
bag of dragon's-eyes that were the price of its surrender. Haply
you think, O crafty son of the ever two-faced house of Kwok,
because you are fated shortly to Pass Hence, thus to avoid your
just engagements?"</p>

<p>A breath of mistrust stirred certain doubts that lingered in
Ming's mind. He looked east and west along the Way and saw that
none approached; from the house behind no disturbing sound
arose.</p>

<p>"What air have you lately breathed," he ventured amicably, "in
that for some time past you have been absent from the city?"</p>

<p>"What pungent fish is this that you thus trail?" demanded the
other scornfully. "Never was I beyond Nan kau since the day my
mother had me. Doubtless you hope to lead my mind away from the
matter of the vampire kite&mdash;may the dragon's-eyes lie
cankerous on thy ill-nurtured stomach!"</p>

<p>"Nay, but my heart is clear of any guile," protested Ming
resourcefully, "in token whereof here is a cake of honey, freely
to thy hand. Yet how comes it that you know of the destiny
awaiting this untimely one?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is the great talk among the inner chambers of this
quarter of the city, and there is much concern as to the means by
which the supple paint-peddler within will strive to avert the
doom."</p>

<p>"What do men say?" asked Ming, veiling his misgivings.</p>

<p>"They say little; but their lesser ones industriously supply
that lack."</p>

<p>"And to what end?" demanded Ming more urgently.</p>

<p>"The general trend is that the Fates will in due course
prevail," replied the one outside, speaking with an air of
agreeable anticipation despite the honey cake he fed on, "for it
is recalled that when the wily mastic-monger had you adopted to
the Temple banyan tree, to secure for you a powerful advocate,
the hostile Ones were strong enough by a lightning flash to
cleave it to the ground and leave you shieldless. Glad am I, Kwok
San, that for me the geomancers foretold the threefold
happiness...To whom will go your bow and golden arrows, O
estimable San?"</p>

<p>"To thee, without doubt, out of deep mutual friendship," Ming
made reply in haste. "Touching this fate&mdash;when is the
day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I cannot stay&mdash;one stronger than myself draws nigh and
the fair remnant of this cake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the bow and golden arrows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Another day perchance&mdash;" came back the lessening voice,
and pursuing feet sped by.</p>

<p>Ming Tseuen replaced the shutter and sat down. A variety of
noteworthy sayings from the lips of Sages of the past occurred to
his retentive mind, but although many of these were of gem-like
lustre, none seemed at the moment to offer him the exact solution
that his position called for. What outline that position took he
was now perfectly assured&mdash;the chance encounter with that
one outside had moulded vaporous doubt into a compact certainty.
Kwok Shen had played a double part throughout. His son had not
Passed Hence at all, but the for tellers had divined that he
lived beneath the influence of some malignant spirit and that at
a predicted hour its vengeance would be wrought. Driven from one
protection to another, accident, in the form of his own peculiar
likeness, had given into a distracted father's hand a final and
decisive means to baffle its perceptions. The device was one of
high classical authority and in like case Ming Tseuen would
himself have hastened to adopt it, but, as the adage rightly
says, "What is defence to Ho-ping is to Ping-ho defiance."</p>

<p>There was still time doubtless to turn his knowledge into
flight; the outer door might now be' barred, but he could at a
stress project his body through the shutter. Truly, but what lay
beyond? Everywhere Kwok Shen's bitter vengeance would pursue him
and on a thousand facile pretexts could betray him to the
Torments.</p>

<p>Nor, apart, was the idea of flight congenial to his active
resolution. After a time of penury he' had at length experienced
a course of ease' which he' would willingly prolong up to its
farthest limit. Among these hopes there twined, perchance, the
form of Hya, of the house of Tai. If, ran his most persuasive
thought, by any means he could outwit the invading demon and
preserve himself alive, might not the liberality of Kwok Shen be
deeply stirred and all things wear a brighter face thenceforward?
The deliberate way in which the snare had been exposed to him
revealed that his own protective Forces were even now on the
alert.</p>

<p>These varied facts had held Ming Tseuen for a flight of time
involving hours when an unusual sound, slight but insistent, at
the shutter overhead recalled him to the moment. Scarcely daring
to hope that it was that other now returned again, he drew the
footstool to the wall and cautiously looked out. The cloud of
night had gathered, but the great sky lantern hung above and by
its beams Ming saw another, such as he himself, standing
below.</p>

<p>"Who art thou standing there?" he whispered down, "and
wherefore are you come?"</p>

<p>"I would see you face to face," replied a voice no less well
guarded. "Thrust forth thy arm that I may clamber up."</p>

<p>"Stay while I get a worthier hold," responded Ming, and having
done so complied. The one outside made good his claim, and
twisting through the space adroitly they fell upon the floor
together. As they got up the other laughed, and standing thus
apart regarded Ming.</p>

<p>"Canst thou not guess?" he demanded artlessly. "I am that San,
heir of the one who is lord here, and this is my own chamber. I
know who you are though I must not speak the name. So that is as
I am!" and he continued to regard Ming closely.</p>

<p>"Should he chance to come this way our skins will bear witness
of the meeting to the day when that last measurement is taken,"
observed Ming darkly; then going to the door he pushed home the
wedge above the latch so that none could enter.</p>

<p>"That I well know," admitted San, "but we shall have warning
by his sonorous breathing from afar and you can then speed me
through the shutter."</p>

<p>"True," agreed Ming. "Yet whence are you?"</p>

<p>"For seven days and nearly seven days more I have dwelt at the
elder Kong's, under a very strict injunction that confines me
there. But I may not tell thee why."</p>

<p>"Then how comes it now that you have disobeyed?"</p>

<p>"The way is left unguarded and I adventured down. There came
an irk to see the one who was, I heard him say, the double image
of my living self&mdash;and as I likewise heard it would be to
late to-morrow."</p>

<p>Ming Tseuen did not waver in his listless poise nor did he
vary the unconcerned expression of his features.</p>

<p>"Why should to-morrow be too late?" he asked neglectfully.</p>

<p>"That I could tell also, but I will not lest you should guess
too much," wisely replied the other. "But give heed to this: my
shutter opens on an empty space where none pass by, and beneath
it stands a water-cask on poles by which I scrambled down.
Couldst thou have done as much?"</p>

<p>"If it gives you the foothold to descend, I doubt not that I
could get up again," said Ming consideringly. "What is the place
called where the elder Kong abides?"</p>

<p>"It has the symbol of a leaping goat and stands against the
water-gate, a short space to the east&mdash;but why should you
seek to know?" demanded San.</p>

<p>"I do not seek to know save in the light of converse,"
answered Ming, feeling his cautious path. "There is something to
talk about in this exploit of thine&mdash;few of like age could
have achieved it. And to have learned so much that would only be
spoken of behind barred doors reveals a special aptness."</p>

<p>"As to that," declared the other proudly, "there is a passage
close against the inner room where he and she recline that has a
moving board unknown to them. Hadst thou not found it yet?"</p>

<p>"What need had I, seeing that we two are alike in everything,
so that the one should tell all to the other?"</p>

<p>"That does not rejoice my face entirely," decided San, after
he had thought upon it. "For seven days now and almost seven days
more you have possessed my toys, while I in turn have been bereft
of yours...Where is my phoenix upon wheels whose place was here?
Have you incapably destroyed it?"</p>

<p>"Not I," declared Ming Tseuen, though mildly. "It is laid by.
This person is too old for such immature devices."</p>

<p>"How so?" demanded San indignantly. "My years are twelve,
while among the outside I freely pass for more. How many years
are thine?"</p>

<p>"Mine are somewhat more, though I freely pass for less,"
admitted Ming. "Therein we meet upon a middle ground."</p>

<p>"Further," continued San vaingloriously, "I am affianced to a
virtuous maiden of the worthy house of Tai, whom I shall in due
course marry and have a hundred strong sons of my own. Are
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which one is that&mdash;this maiden?" interposed Ming Tseuen,
more sharply than his wont.</p>

<p>"How should I say&mdash;not having ever seen her? But she has
a sweet-smelling name and all the nine delights. Are you thus
pledged or married?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," admitted Ming, "but I may some day attain it."</p>

<p>"I do not think so&mdash;though more I may not say lest I
should tell too much...Why, when I move my head or hand, do you
do likewise also, and why should you change your voice to follow
mine?"</p>

<p>"Consider the gladness of thy father's eyes when even he fails
to discriminate between us," replied Ming, with an appropriate
gesture such as San would use, and speaking with the counterpart
of that one's voice. "Is it not&mdash;but hasten, one approaches
from the inner hall. Here! Crouch quickly down behind this screen
and eat your breath, or much bamboo awaits us!" Ming Tseuen only
paused for a single beat of time to assure himself that San was
adequately concealed before he sought to unwedge the door. Before
he could reach it the latch was tried and the handle shaken.</p>

<p>"Why is the door barred against this person's coming, seeing
that you have not yet had your nightly cup of wine?" inquired the
one who stood there, a close attendant on Kwok Shen himself.
"This is not apt, O San."</p>

<p>"I had forgot," replied Ming sleepily. "My mind is strange and
dubious to-night. Regard it not, accommodating Tsoi."</p>

<p>"That may well be," assented Tsoi, with a hasty glance around
and fingering a written charm he wore upon his wrist
protectively. "For as I came I seemed to hear resentful voices in
the air, and qualmous rustlings."</p>

<p>"Those also," agreed Ming more wakefully. "And wind-swirls
overhead and beating wings, with sudden shrieks of mirth and
other unclean sounds. What do these things portend, much-
knowing?"</p>

<p>"I may not stay&mdash;he bade me hasten back," replied the
weak-kneed Tsoi, taking a firm grasp upon the handle of the door.
"This cup is from his own preparing hand. May you float tranquil
in the Middle Air t night!"</p>

<p>"May your constituents equalise harmoniously!" responded Ming,
and they heard him bar the door on the outer side and marked his
speedy footsteps down the passage.</p>

<p>"I also would withdraw," exclaimed San, coming forth and in a
sudden tremor. "That matter of the creatures of the air did not
appease my inner organs. I had not thought of that. Nor was the
door barred thus when I slept here."</p>

<p>"Peace," said Ming reassuringly; "I have a new and most
alluring artifice to show you yet. Where is the vampire kite that
has a trusty cord attached? It turns on that."</p>

<p>"I do not care. I will not stay; at least, I will not stay
unless you share with me the wine that Tsoi has brought. I was
wont to have a cup of sweet spiced wine each night, and thou hast
had it here while there I have had none."</p>

<p>"The wine: assuredly. That is but fair," agreed Ming Tseuen.
He had already raised it to his lips to quell a sudden thirst
that parched his throat, but now he turned aside to wipe his
mouth and then held out the cup. "Your engaging moderation fills
me with despair. Put my self-reproach at ease by drinking
all."</p>

<p>"Yea; that is but fair," repeated San approvingly, "seeing how
long you have enjoyed it...It has a bitterish taste that was not
wont to be."</p>

<p>"The rarer kinds of wine are often thus; it indicates a
special sort of excellence."</p>

<p>"But this weighs down my eyes and sways my mind," objected
San, with twitching limbs already. "It begins to burn my
mouth...I will not drink the rest."</p>

<p>"Consider well," urged Ming, "how humiliated would be the one
who sent the wine if any should be left."</p>

<p>"I cannot&mdash;Why does the room thus spin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cannot!" protested Ming, and by a swift and sudden move he
held the other's head and raised the wine until the cup was
empty. "Cannot! But see, thou hast!"</p>

<p>"That was not well," gasped San, turning to bite the hand that
held him, ere he fell senseless to the ground. "To-night thou art
outdone, misgotten dog!"</p>

<p>"Perchance; but the deities ordain," acquiesced Ming
trustfully, "and this works to an end." He continued to regard
the one stretched at his feet, and then he turned to wedge the
door inside and to listen for a moment to the sounds about the
house. San had not stirred nor did he move again.</p>

<p>"Much of this arises from an ordinary person interfering with
the guiding hand of destiny," was the burden of Ming's thoughts,
for in addition to his other qualities the one in question was
both reverent and devout. "Even had he been content to leave
matters at a middle stage there is no telling what the outer end
might not have been, but by so ordering the wine that the demon
should definitely understand that his vengeance was complete, the
too painstaking Kwok Shen has stumbled. Yet with one so
consistently inept it will be well to certify assurance."</p>

<p>Accordingly he took San up and raised him to a couch, and
pressing a cushion down upon his face he held it firmly there.
Meanwhile, as he waited for his self-imposed task to be complete,
his grateful heart rejoiced:</p>

<p>"Plainly the spirits of my hitherto unknown but henceforth
venerated ancestors have been at work and brought this thing to
pass. Henceforth I will sacrifice to their very useful memories
on a really worthy scale, nor will outside and comparatively
second-rate deities be forgotten, so that all who have upheld my
cause will receive something solid in return. Never again let it
impiously be said, 'He who sets out to make his fortune should
leave his gods at home.' Has not this person maintained integrity
throughout and, behold, his poverty is changed to affluence,
affectionate and influential parents are raised up to take the
place of those whom he has never known, and the loadstar of all
earthly desire is automatically reserved to minister to his
future happiness? Assuredly there is more in this than formless
chance."</p>

<p>By this time there could no longer be any reasonable doubt
that Ming Tseuen's task was done. With a seemly regard in the
observance he despoiled San of his robe and all he carried,
wrapping the one that he had worn around him in return, and he
also made certain changes in the room of a consistent nature.
Then he drew himself up to the shutter and cautiously looked out.
The way was clear and the great sky lantern for a moment
auspiciously withheld her light; Ming Tseuen dropped noiselessly
to earth, and again reverently committing himself to the
protection of his necessarily anonymous ancestors, he turned his
trusting footsteps towards the elder Kong's, by the water-gate, a
short distance to the east.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. THE DELICATE CASE OF MLLE.
CÉLESTINE BON</h2>

<p class="first">AMONG the really great problems that Armageddon
called into being, the affair of Mlle. Bon can hold no place. Its
interest is circumscribed, affecting as it merely does one woman
and two men, or even, as you may judge when you have heard, one
woman and about seven-eighths of two men. Yet I feel that it is
not without a certain dramatic poignancy of its own. It might not
have a pealed to the Greek tragedians, because, for that matter,
they would have experienced some difficulty in understanding its
details; but the late W. S. Gilbert could have turned it to good
account, and I can conceive that Mr. Bernard Shaw would have
revelled in its possibilities as a problem play&mdash;had he not
given up writing plays. For myself, I can only tell the plain
unvarnished tale as&mdash;or as nearly as is feasible&mdash;it
was told to me.</p>

<p>Célestine Bon was, as you will have guessed, French, but in
order to understand her difficulty and the entirely proper
vivacious fluency with which she handled its recital you had
better appreciate how exquisitely French she was. She lived with
her parents in a small town at no great distance from Paris, but
on the safe side of the war map, and she had two suitors, Raoul,
whom she adored, and Jean, whom she loathed. As Raoul was rich
and virtuous, while Jean was certainly poor and of doubtful
repute, this disposal of her affection would seem to be quite
satisfactory. A complicating element, however, was the fact that
Raoul and Jean were foster-brothers and quite sincerely attached
to one another. The favoured one, while rejoicing in his own good
fortune, would have had Célestine extend towards Jean at least
some degree of tolerance. He was utterly unable to comprehend so
unbending a dislike on the lady's part, especially as she would
suggest no reason for it; nor, as a matter of fact, do I.</p>

<p>The war took Célestine, Raoul and Jean unaware, but it took
them all, just the same. Raoul and Jean were immediately swept
out of sight and lost to all knowledge of their friends and
apparently of everyone else. Célestine, not a whit less
patriotic, at once flung herself into the crisis, and after duly
qualifying emerged in the not unbecoming uniform of a nurse
probationer and was allotted to a recuperation camp.</p>

<p>Here one day, in the usual course of things, she encountered a
pale and interesting young officer of chasseurs who had just been
sent down from a base hospital to complete the cure that was
already assured.</p>

<p>"Raoul!" she cried, and but for her thorough training would
have fainted into his arms.</p>

<p>"My Célestine!" responded the officer, embracing her
regardless of all regulations. "But this is wonderful! How do you
come here and in this fascinating garb?"</p>

<p>In a few words, interrupted by mutual caresses of endearment,
she told him what had taken place since his departure.</p>

<p>"And you, my poor Raoul," she concluded; "what has happened to
you? You have been wounded? How pale you are, even to your
lips!"</p>

<p>"Célestine," replied Raoul gravely, "it is of this that I
would speak. No longer shalt thou misjudge that brave fellow Jean
Villjean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Célestine, pouting; "it is of him then, even
at this moment, that you speak?"</p>

<p>"Truly," replied Raoul. "For were it not for Jean I should not
at this moment be able to speak at all."</p>

<p>"He saved your life?" faltered Célestine.</p>

<p>"I would not go so far as to say that," admitted Raoul. "But
he certainly enabled me to preserve that appearance which you
have more than once been flattering enough to express approval
of. Listen, Célestine. At the great defence of the village of
Vergt, of which you have doubtless read, my squadron was in the
foremost trenches, acting, of course, as infantry. The hostile
bombardment was at its height when, just in front of us, an
enormous shell burst with terrific force. Although it was fully
fifty metres away, fragments whistled among us as thick as hail.
Men fell to right and left of me. Something whizzed past my head,
so near that it seemed as though it could not fail to inflict a
deadly wound. Instinctively, although I had felt no pain, I
clapped by hand to my face. It came away covered with blood. Then
I discovered that my lips were missing; they had been shorn off
as neatly as though by the surgeon's knife."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Célestine, who had not taken her
enthralled eyes from Raoul's face during the recital of his
story. "You exaggerate, my estimable friend. Cut, yes, I grant
you, but not cut off. Why, there is hardly now a scar
remaining."</p>

<p>"Yet nevertheless it is strictly true," asserted Raoul with
some complacency. "That there is so little disfigurement to be
seen is due to the wonders of our operative surgery, added to the
devotion of the heroic Jean. He also was wounded in the action,
not seriously, but in such a manner, by the loss of two fingers,
as to unfit him for further active service; yet no sooner had
this noble comrade heard of my plight than he insisted on
sacrificing two pieces of his own flesh to replace those that I
had lost."</p>

<p>"You say this?" demanded the agitated Célestine. "And to me,
your affianced?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly," assented Raoul, who was not very bright or
subtle. "And why not? The operation was completely successful, so
that now, as you have said, scarcely a mark remains to be
seen."</p>

<p>"That concerns me not," exclaimed Célestine, springing away
from her lover's arms. "Rather would I have you sliced into the
semblance of a horse-radish were it but your own natural self.
But to have the knowledge every time you embrace me that the lips
which touch mine are those of Jean Villjean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not his lips," began Raoul, and pulled himself
up&mdash;wisely, I think.</p>

<p>"It matters not; I cannot endure the thought," protested
Célestine a little wildly. "It was to Raoul de Montbard that I
gave myself, not to a being composed of several individualities,
least of all Jean Villjean as regards his lips."</p>

<p>"But this is absurd," said Raoul. "That which certainly may
have been Jean Villjean formerly is now thoroughly incorporated
into my existence. Can Jean move my lips or utter words through
them? Why, of course not. But I can, they being part of myself.
Be reasonable, Célestine, and do not any longer harbour this u
healthy thought."</p>

<p>"I cannot help it," replied Célestine. "To me it is frankly
odious. Do not seek to restrain me, amiable one. I must have a
little time in solitude to consider this sudden obstacle to our
happiness."</p>

<p>So Célestine Bon applied for leave of absence and obtained it.
In the quietude of her own home, possibly, also, influenced by
the absence of Raoul, a saner view of the situation gradually
prevailed in her mind. This revulsion delighted her; for, she
argued, "If, after a week, this has become so little of moment,
what will there be after a month? And at the end of a year there
will be, pouf! nothing!" Thus Célestine blew away the last trace
of her lingering doubt, thereby demonstrating the practical
common-sense underlying her more obvious impulsiveness. She at
once re-packed and endeavoured to return to her station, but much
to her disappointment she was then informed that in the meantime
she had been temporarily transferred elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the event it was nearly six months before Célestine got
back to her old forest camp of N&mdash;&mdash;. She liked the
place and had allowed her application for reinstatement to stand,
although the first urgent reason for it had by this time passed
away, of course. Raoul would have returned to his duties long
ago. Yet almost the first person to be encountered on passing the
dear old rickety gate of the recuperation camp was de Montbard,
looking very much the same as before. They embraced. In less than
half-an-hour Célestine had rapidly gone over the groundwork of
her emotions; then she turned to the subject of Raoul
himself.</p>

<p>"But you, my poor warrior, why do you not speak of yourself?
Assuredly your convalescence must have been longer than we
anticipated for me to' find you still here. Did you then suffer a
relapse?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied Raoul. "I was back again at the
front within a month of your departure. Ill luck, however, still
pursued me, for within a short time the accursed Boche deluged
our trench with liquid fire. Thus a second time I was condemned
to the inaction of hospital life."</p>

<p>"The pigs!" hissed Célestine. "Were you very badly
burned?"</p>

<p>"Only my right arm," replied Raoul heroically; "but of that
the skin was destroyed from finger-tip to shoulder."</p>

<p>"That would entail a very serious wound," mused Célestine.
"You must possess a marvellous constitution, my Raoul, for the
arm about my waist is as firm and vigorous as ever."</p>

<p>"That is due to the skill of the doctors who so cleverly
patched me up. But why talk of these trifles? You, my Célestine,
upon the honour of my name, you are looking more bewitching than
ever."</p>

<p>Did Célestine's rapid intuition perceive a cautionary signal
in this reluctance on her lover's part to talk about himself and
his achievements? At all events she said:</p>

<p>"But naturally I am much interested in this latest adventure
of yours. How was so speedy a recovery effected?"</p>

<p>"Um, well," stammered Raoul uneasily; "I suppose as you say,
that my constitution&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have made use of the expression 'patch up,' my friend,"
interposed Célestine with icy firmness. "Did they then, these
skilful surgeons, employ tissue grafting?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; I believe that there was some little detail of the
sort," admitted Raoul. "But you have not yet told me how the old
place was looking and if the new cure&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"All in good time, my poor sufferer; you naturally demand my
first thoughts. Who was the kind friend who so nobly submitted to
the inconvenience of having pieces of his skin removed in order
to supply your need?"</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;er&mdash;unconscious at the time," prevaricated
the unhappy Raoul. His evasion would not have deceived a Siamese
cat, let alone Célestine Bon.</p>

<p>"But assuredly you would have learned his name afterwards,"
she persisted. "It was an obligation, and a de Montbard does not
forget. Was it"&mdash;her eyes met his like the points of two
stilettos&mdash;"was it by any chance Jean Villjean?"</p>

<p>"Why, since you mention him, I remember that it was," assented
Raoul with patent artlessness. "He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Célestine, tearing herself free, "but this
transcends the possible limit! It is not enough that I must
endure Jean Villjean's lips pressed against my face. His arm,
down even to the extremities of the fingers&mdash;admittedly the
most delicate organs of the touch&mdash;may now insinuate
themselves around my waist. What next, I wonder? I refuse to
contemplate the eventuality! The arm from which I tear myself is
not that of Raoul de Montbard, to whose memory I shall remain
faithful for ever, but the arm of Jean Villjean. Adieu, composite
monster!"</p>

<p>With that, Célestine Bon departed from the recuperation camp
yet again. This time she did not even wait for official
permission, so that with unauthorised absence from duty the
incident of her service for the Allied cause regretfully closed.
But on that score Mlle. Bon has no misgivings. It was merely
impossible for her to act otherwise. Any woman&mdash;certainly
any Frenchwoman&mdash;will understand and will tender her a
silent and respectful sympathy.</p>

<p>It is quite true that once more, in the calm atmosphere of her
domestic round, Célestine's heart has begun to soften towards the
absent warrior, but she is practical enough to be warned by
experience. The same sort of thing occurred before, and what
happened then? She could endure&mdash;nay, treasure&mdash;a Raoul
reduced by valour to the mere truncation of a man, his features
battered beyond recognition, but not one who, before her eyes, is
slowly and insidiously passing into the identity of a despised
and rejected suitor.</p>

<p>Besides, and here I am bound to confess Célestine touches on
possibilities too delicate for my insular pen to probe; where,
she demands, is the thing to end? Raoul is brave, rash and
obviously unlucky. Jean is, one must admit even though one admits
it with a shrug, plucky, devoted to his friend, and practically
inexhaustible. The possibilities of operative surgery are, as we
begin to see, illimitable. The war, at this critical point in the
interlaced destinies of these three hapless beings, scarcely
beyond its third year, is declared by the majority to be only
just beginning, and while some predict a seven years' course for
it, others, with just as formidable an artillery of argument,
place its continuance at seventy times seven. Soon there must
come a point at which Raoul will have become rather more Jean
than Raoul and thenceforward he will, after each operation,
become Jeanified with increasing momentum. Heart and brain may
remain Raoulish (though even here Célestine has no actual
guarantee against medical science), but it may be suspected that
these attributes are less prominent in Célestine's fond
remembrance than Raoul's prepossessing exterior.</p>

<p><i>Hastings, 1920.</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. THE DEAD MARCH</h2>

<p class="first">I WOKE very early that morning with the sound of
music in my ears. It was a band, a distant band; evidently, I
thought, some troops are changing camp, and I lay awake listening
until the strains exercised a strange possession over me, for
never, I declare, had I heard a melody so haunting. It was all
things. From the wail of lament it rose to the blazonry of
triumph, from joy passed to sorrow, spoke now of hope and now of
despair, shrilled victory in defeat and relentlessly voiced the
barrenness of conquest. It was of pagan grandeur, of Arcadian
simplicity, of cities and of glades. A mother with her laughing
child; Caesar to his victorious army; a shepherd fluting at a
spring; a dead warrior lying stark by night on a desolate waste.
Sometimes I thought that it was approaching, sometimes receding,
but this I discovered was nothing but the vagarity of the wind,
and presently the music was no more and the night was empty of
sound and cold with the loneliness of bereavement. It was still
very early when I rose and went out. Day was just breaking, like
day at the beginning of time b fore things were. The villages of
Preston and Sutton Poyntz lay beneath me in the valley, but they
were as a picture that is limned and no smoke came from the
chimneys of their hearths, nor was there any sound save that from
the more distant water-meadows beyond; at intervals a sheep-bell
gave a note. About me lay the grave-mounds of the ancient dead
and the wide, open spaces of the wind-shorn heights.</p>

<p>By the time I had reached the cleft of the valley the sun had
risen and what had hitherto been a particle of eternity had
become a day. The earliest mushroom-gatherer was swinging along
the beach on his way to the salted downs, as his daily custom is,
and the melodious confusion of the sheep-bells told that the
flock was being driven' from its nightly harbourage in the
enclosed pasture to the hazardous freedom of the cliffs.
Presently they swung past me in a billowy mass, and leaping at a
gap debouche into a barley stubble. An urchin and a tousled hound
accompanied and controlled them; when they reached the heights
the child dropped a careless word to the wistful dog, and
throwing himself down on the turf by the very edge of the sheer
precipice, drew a volume from a pocket of his ragged coat.</p>

<p>The little bay here has this peculiarity: that at one point
all the lighter kinds of wreckage come ashore, while further
along one may find (especially after a storm) bolts and nails,
cannon balls and parts of strange and obsolete weapons, coins of
all ages, and odd and unexpected things&mdash;all these, I say,
may be found along this stretch, but never by any chance wreckage
that will float. It was here on this morning that I picked up an
ancient bit of silver, a denarius of Rome, lying among the
stones. It was somewhat encrusted with pitch, and as I walked I
rubbed it with a little moist sand to clear the lettering. The
mushroom-gatherer had gone by now, passing me with a word after
the friendly custom of these parts, and I had fancied that I had
the beach to myself, until, happening to look up, my eyes were
attracted by a striking figure. Doubtless I should have noted his
approach had I not been so engrossed in rubbing my find and
trying to decipher its inscription, for he was now standing
directly in front of me. I took him to be a visitor who had come
out for an early bathe, probably a sojourner at one of the old
coastguard cottages just beyond the hills, where people stay in
summer, for he wore sandals and a shapeless dressing-gown or robe
of purple. He was a man well advanced in years and his
expression, without being in anyway distinguished, was dignified
and shrewd. His odd attire might be excused in circumstances
where men relax, but his salutation challenged resentment, until
I remembered that the ground on which we stood and the eternal
hills around were an enduring memorial to those dim ages when our
race was shaping in the mould. Here on every side the landmarks
are the temples or the citadels, the graves or the pleasances of
contending races who achieved their destinies and are no more,
while to this day that ancient leveller, the ploughman, mixes
their bones impartially and lays bare their household gods
without reverence and scarcely with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Hail, Briton!" had been his greeting.</p>

<p>I stared for a moment and then smiled to' myself. "Here," I
thought, "is one of those enthusiasts who lose themselves in the
past. Doubtless he has a theory about some obscure fosse or
vallum, and in the everlasting consideration of it he has become
absent-minded." For the moment, I say, I was taken aback; then,
observing that the lines of his face were not destitute of
humour, I had the impulse to recall him to the present by
responding in like strain.</p>

<p>"Greetings," I accordingly replied with fitting gravity.
"Greeting, Imperial Rome!"</p>

<p>Instead of betraying any confusion or surprise, my new
acquaintance inclined his head slightly, as though receiving
homage that was due.</p>

<p>"This spot pleases me well, as it ever did," he mused aloud.
"It was here that our prows first touched after voyaging across
from Vectis" (his glance indicated the single gleaming shoulder
that the Isle of Wight raised above the thin sea mist), "and in
my tent, pitched in yon meadow just beyond the stream, I composed
at nights the march that was on your lips."</p>

<p>"A march&mdash;on my lips just now?" I stammered.</p>

<p>"Assuredly, or I should not have spoken you. You know the
music of it? Nay, then listen."</p>

<p>I listened, and very faintly in the distance I heard the
refrain of the melody that had so impressed me. Possibly I had
been humming it, as he said, but quite unconsciously.</p>

<p>"It lacks the plaintive quality of flutes," he remarked
critically as we listened. "But that is an instrument for which
our martial bands made no provision."</p>

<p>"You are a musician then?" I said.</p>

<p>"An amateur," he admitted carelessly. "Still, one who as a
mere proconsul turned his back on a despot, rather than endure
his discords, may be allowed to claim an ear."</p>

<p>My knowledge of music&mdash;or of despots&mdash;did not enable
me to identify the particular ruler he alluded to. I sought
enlightenment obliquely.</p>

<p>"Was he indeed so very poor a player?"</p>

<p>"He was not only that. After making due allowance for his
exalted rank, he was, I would assert, the very worst player who
has ever ventured to confront an audience. Moreover, he was
partial to the fiddle, of all instruments, and prone to resort to
it at inopportune moments."</p>

<p>"Your own composition&mdash;" I ventured.</p>

<p>He waved his hand in deprecation.</p>

<p>"I do not seek comparison," he said. "In my opinion the arts
are scarcely the fit attribute of a soldier, except perchance, as
in the case of the first Caesar, to record his victories. But I
was younger then and not long married. Around and before me lay
the doubts and dangers of an arduous campaign in an unknown land;
so that, under the stars at times, and ever to the accompaniment
of the breakers on this rocky shore (it has changed but little),
I felt inspired to voice the hopeless valour of the
Durotriges."</p>

<p>I suppose my look indicated the blankness of my mind on the
subject of the Durotriges.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of this region&mdash;Belgae our historians
deemed them," he explained. "Less capably armed than the similar
tribes of Gaul, they vied with them in desperate courage. For
three days and three nights the tribesmen here withstood the
Second Legion, yielding only foot by foot until they had covered
their retirement to their great hill-fortress, two hours' march
yonder to the north."</p>

<p>"Maiden Castle!" I exclaimed; for, about eight miles distant
from the place we stood on, there exists to this day a stronghold
such as he described, a camp so colossal in its scope, so
ambitious in its scheme of ramparts, that it is scarcely credible
as the achievement of a primitive people, toiling almost
literally with their hands alone. Inferior, neither to the
Pyramids nor the Sphinx in its solitary grandeur, it would
certainly be much visited <i>by</i> our tourists were it but
placed say in China or Peru.</p>

<p>"Dunium we called it. There the entire tribe assembled with
their flocks and herds well secured, and there they might have
held us at bay until we wearied of the siege or until Claudius
recalled us, had it not been for one weakness to which the
inhabitants of this island were ever prone."</p>

<p>"And that was?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"They were too late, being over-sanguine in a false security.
Dunium was feverishly begun, it would appear, under the threat of
Julius Caesar's invasion, but he failed to penetrate these wilds
and, the danger passing, Dunium was never finished. There
existed, we discovered, a weakness in the ramparts to the south.
Between our landing and the investment of their camp there was
not time to repair the deficiency. It proved fatal. Once our
velites had gained the higher plane the most devoted valour,
backed only by flint-heads, availed the defenders nothing. Dunium
was ours. A great fight. We gave them martial honours. <i>Vae
victis!</i> it must ever be, but a conqueror should know how to
be magnanimous in victory. Their dead rest in peace under their
own rites."</p>

<p>Far out at sea a great bird, poised in swift flight aloft,
spied what it sought and flashed its message shoreward. In one of
the hidden forts that stud the coast a single cannot cleared its
throat.</p>

<p>"Thunder of Jove! but that was a shrewd bolt!" exclaimed he of
the purple. "The tribe still follows Mars?"</p>

<p>"There are no young men in the valley now," I made answer.
"They carry their standard on many an alien field."</p>

<p>"It is known to us; we, too, have met the Hun...Yes, this spot
was often in my thoughts in after years, and whenever our arms
encountered outmatched valour I again saw the terraced heights of
Dunium. Oft-time, when a report of some deed of fitting worth
reached my ears, I would have one of our bands perform my
march&mdash;though they knew not it was mine&mdash;to the memory
of the brave. It was set to eighteen instruments of
brass&mdash;six trumpets, six horns&mdash;"</p>

<p>The mist from the land had been stealing down the valley as we
talked. Quite suddenly it enveloped us, shutting out all things
beyond and even each one from the other. I called aloud but there
was no reply; took a few steps blindly forward only to meet the
grey earth of the cliff. Then the wind from off the sea lapped
back the mist and I found that I was again alone on the deserted
shore.</p>

<p>I walked back along the winding stream and past the spot where
once a leisured gentleman of Durnovaria built for himself a
villa. Its tessellated pavement still remains <i>in situ</i>. On
the highway I fell in with a soldier and we walked along
together.</p>

<p>"I suppose a draft of the 4th moved out of Upton Camp about
three o'clock this morning," I remarked when the occasion
offered. "I heard what I took to be their band."</p>

<p>"The 4th left two days ago," he answered. "There's no one in
at Upton now."</p>

<p>"Then the band?" I persisted. "What band was there about?"</p>

<p>He looked at me a little curiously&mdash;or perhaps I fancied
it.</p>

<p>"I heard no band," he said, "and I was out on guard duty up at
Bincombe then. If there had been a band," he decided with the
doggedness of simple conviction, "I reckon I should 'a heard
it."</p>

<p>When I reached home again the morning papers had just arrived.
You will recall that day perhaps. This was what their head-lines
blazed forth:</p> <br>

<p class="headline">HEROIC STAND AT MONS<br>
BRITISH DESPERATELY OUTNUMBERED</p>

<p><br> A little later I took an opportunity to complete the
scouring of my coin. It disclosed the head of an elderly man,
dignified without being distinguished, and wearing a wreath of
laurel. The inscription around it was this:</p> <br>

<p class="headline">IMP. CAESAR VESPASIANVS</p>
<br>

<p>Vespasian? Well, certainly, if any emperor were destined to
become a Slave of the Coin it might&mdash;despite his many
virtues&mdash;well be Vespasian.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV. A VERY BLACK BUSINESS</h2>

<p class="first">MR. BROWN was in the act of looking down the
barrel of a revolver when a noise&mdash;a call&mdash;somewhere in
the stairway of his block of flats arrested his hand. There were
three reasons why at that supreme moment he was susceptible to so
slight an influence; the cry was a curiously melodious one, and
the hearer was by nature and profession a musician; it was, as
well as a melodious call, a strangely old-world one; and it
seemed to speak of coal. Now it was precisely the absence of this
commodity that was driving the musician to his rash act. A
trivial cause for so tremendous a result, it may be urged, and
perhaps it was, but Mr. Brown was of the artistic temperament and
therefore quite outside the ordinary standard of reasonable
conduct.</p>

<p>In this matter of coal he had really very little to complain
of. Warned both by the previous winter's experience and by
certain official recommendations, he had gone to his usual coal
merchant early in the month of May and ordered the full capacity
of his modest cupboard&mdash;a single ton. Delivery was
faithfully promised for that day week&mdash;between nine and ten
in the morning&mdash;and, rejoicing greatly, Mr. Brown returned
with the assurance.</p>

<p>In July Mrs. Brown gave up carpeting the hall with newspapers
on wet days in anticipation of the coal-man's arrival.</p>

<p>In August Mr. Brown called on eleven other coal merchants and
recklessly ordered a ton of coal from each. Seven declined the
business; of the others, one promised delivery that day week at
8.30 in the morning (or, he added, between 8.30 and a quarter to
nine, say), another that day twelvemonth, and the remainder at
various intervening dates.</p>

<p>Later in the month Brown wrote an unwise letter to each of the
dealers, stating that although he had thoughtlessly specified
coal when ordering, he was really prepared to accept whatever
substitute they were then supplying under that name. It was only
his way of reminding them; but as the tone of the communication
was light and flippant, each recipient thought that it must
convey some hidden insult, and the order was accordingly struck
off the books.</p>

<p>In September his original dealer rebuked him for impatience,
pointing out that although he had been faithfully promised coal
in May, there were many others in the same plight who had been
just as faithfully promised for April or even March.</p>

<p>In October Mr. Brown began to contemplate suicide as the
simplest way out of it. For over a month the nights had been
seasonably cold, and even in the daytime it had now become
unpleasantly chilly sitting before an empty grate. To stay in
meant being starved to death; to go out (the servant had been
dispensed with as a war economy) meant missing the coal when it
did arrive. That morning Mrs. Brown had ventured on a well-meant
suggestion. Her husband had feigned to accept it in a vein of
sustained irony. Ultimately the lady had gone out shopping in
tears, and it now seemed to the repentant and unhappy man that
the best thing he could do was to go out in smoke.</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile the unusual call had drawn nearer, floor
by floor (the Brown flat was on the highest), and a vigorous
knock sounded on the door. With an instinctive courtesy, even at
that moment, the musician at once went to answer it, absent-
mindedly still grasping the weapon in his hand. A sturdy little
man in a long blue coat stood outside; skilfully balanced on his
shoulder was a weighty sack.</p>

<p>"You required small coal, sir?"</p>

<p>"This way," replied Mr. Brown, somewhat dazed. He did not care
whether the coal was small or in half-hundredweight blocks. He
led the way and the man followed and shot his burden.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that it's rather a pull, coming up so far,"
apologised Brown. "Are there two of you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that makes no odds," replied the coal-man amiably. "You
see, I take a special interest in musicians, and hearing that you
were desperate like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You knew that I was a musician?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I often hear you playing."</p>

<p>"Really! I had no idea that my violin carried down to the
street. And I don't seem to remember your call before."</p>

<p>"I seldom have occasion to call in the street now. Not that I
am ashamed of my call&mdash;or of my calling. That can never be
said of Tom Britton, sir. Even when I happen to meet, as I
sometimes do, my duchess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your duchess!"</p>

<p>"Her Grace of Queensberry, I mean, sir; she being so regular
at my concerts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Concerts! You give concerts? Really. But how...where...Do you
take the Queen's Hall?"</p>

<p>"Queen's Hall? Oh, no; it's just a loft over my coal-shed
against Clerkenwell&mdash;a few chairs, a platform, a cup of
coffee, and music of a Thursday evening."</p>

<p>"I see...over your coal-shed...and the duchess comes regularly
on Thursday evenings&mdash;early closing, of course...Very
natural...Pray, what instrument do you play, Mr. Britton?"</p>

<p>"Indifferently on most, sir. I have a very fine bass viol by
Norman, and a Rucker virginal scarcely to be matched in Europe.
But for the talent which draws so many of the noble and
discriminating to my loft I am indebted to my friends. Mr.
Banister takes the first violin, Sir Roger L'Estrange the viol,
Mr. Hughes, Mr. Woolaston and Mr. Shuttleworth other instruments
of the band, and for the harpsichord I am generally beholden to
Dr. Pepusch, while frequently the great Mr. George Handel
journeys to Clerkenwell to play my organ."</p>

<p>"Mr. George Handel?...<i>Handel!"</i> Mr. Brown's startled
eyes took in anew the sturdy if unaggressive form of his visitor.
"Yes...yes...of course...it <i>is</i> very warm carrying up these
sacks...a glass...something cooling?"</p>

<p>The coal-man smilingly declined the offer, and, as if reminded
of his duty, made haste to get through the work on hand. In a
shorter time than Mr. Brown had ever known any other load of even
half the amount handled, the full tale of twenty sacks had been
shot in, and the relieved flat-holder saw his "cellar" crammed to
its full capacity. He avoided the subject of music, however, nor
did the harmonious coal-heaver revert to it.</p>

<p>"It looks good coal," commented Brown, as the last sack was
emptied, "though certainly not large."</p>

<p>"Small coal of the best," was the reply. "It may perhaps burn
a little sulphurous, but it's none the worse for that, and it
comes from a very noted Pit."</p>

<p>"Well, when I have any more I hope that your people will send
you with it; for I have never before had it brought up so
easily."</p>

<p>"I will mention it to my Firm, sir," said the little man. "But
the Head isn't always in the best of tempers&mdash;makes these
small attentions difficult sometimes."</p>

<p>It was not until he had gone that Mr. Brown remembered
something. In the strangeness of the whole affair he had
forgotten to pay the bill; nor, for the matter of that, had the
man presented it. The musician hurried to a front window to catch
the name on the cart, for he was not even sure to which firm he
owed the supply. There a fresh surprise awaited him in that day
of wonders. There was no cart in sight. There was no coal-man in
sight. The stairs were empty. Nothing but the coal itself and the
delicious lingering aroma of waxed sacking remained to prove the
reality of the visit.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mr. Brown set out to discharge the account. He
called first on his regular dealer, and found him involved in a
wordy conflict with an acrimonious lady who had been promised
some coal in February. It would appear that it had not yet
arrived, and she was demanding to be told what she was to do, now
that the Government regulated everything.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," the harassed man was saying as Mr. Brown
entered. "I'm not the Government."</p>

<p>"Still, you might as well be," she replied. "They don't seem
to do anything but sit about and make promises."</p>

<p>"What else are they to do," he retorted furiously, "with
people like you about?"</p>

<p>"I should think they might try managing coal depots," was her
parting shot. "Looks as though they are cut out for it."</p>

<p>"And what can I do for <i>you,</i> sir?" demanded the manager
of Mr. Brown, with passionate intentness.</p>

<p>"Some coal was left at my place this morning. I don't know if
it came from you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have the delivery-note, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Curiously enough, one does not seem to have been left, and
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, it's none of ours, for I have your order down for next
week. Thursday morning, early. You have probably been imposed on
by someone."</p>

<p>"I don't quite see how that can be. The man&mdash;a little,
cheerful fellow, who made nothing of the stairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not one of our men," said the manager decisively. "Good-
day."</p>

<p>Mr. Brown left the office and tried the next most likely
place, and then the next. But nowhere was he successful. No
sooner did he essay to describe his obliging visitor than he was
cut short by the positive assurance that there was no such man in
their employ.</p>

<p>At last only one office remained&mdash;the least promising. He
went on to it only as a matter of form, and began the now
familiar tale:</p>

<p>"Some coal was delivered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" prompted the young man in attendance, for the words had
been cut off by a gasp.</p>

<p>"That...you have a picture over there," stammered Mr. Brown in
a shaking voice, and pointing. "Might I look at it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," assented the clerk agreeably. "Rum old thing,
isn't it?" And he lifted the counter-flap for Mr. Brown to pass
within.</p>

<p>It was a print of a stout, little, pleasant-faced man in a
blue smock-frock, displaying in his hand a coal-measure, as
though to assert that he was by no means ashamed of his calling.
Beneath were the words: "Thomas Britton (A.D. 1654-1714). The
Musical Coal Man. From the painting in the National Portrait
Gallery."</p>

<p>"Governor brought it round one day and stuck it up there,"
volunteered the youth. "Sort of patron saint of the business, as
you might say."</p>

<p>"Who is&mdash;was he, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Well, I looked him up at the time, or I shouldn't. Yes; quite
a character in his time. A coal-dealer in a small
way&mdash;delivered the stuff himself. And yet that man, sir, was
one of the foremost musicians of his day. Gave concerts that
attracted all the toffs out of the West End to his coal-hole
somewhere. Absolutely hand-in-glove with the elite in a manner of
speaking, and yet going round with his coal all the time."</p>

<p>"It was true then," murmured Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite true, I assure you. And that wasn't all. He went in
for chemistry and astrology, and things that weren't much
understood then, and, in fact, got the name for having dealings
with the devil! Of course, that's all my eye."</p>

<p>"Quite," assented Mr. Brown feebly. "Good-morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're very welcome," said the clerk hospitably.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. THE BUNCH OF VIOLETS</h2>

<h3>An Episode in the War-time Activities of Max Carrados</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN Mr. J. Beringer Hulse, in the course of one
of his periodical calls at the War Office, had been introduced to
Max Carrados he attached no particular significance to the
meeting. His own business there lay with Mr. Flinders, one of the
quite inconspicuous departmental powers so lavishly produced by a
few years of intensive warfare: business that was more
confidential than exacting at that stage and hitherto carried on
<i>à deux.</i> The presence on this occasion of a third, this
quiet, suave, personable stranger, was not out of line with Mr.
Hulse's open-minded generalities on British methods: "A little
singular, perhaps, but not remarkable," would have been the
extent of his private comment. He favoured Max with a hard,
entirely friendly, American stare, said, "Vurry pleased to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Carrados," as they shook hands, and went
on with his own affair.</p>

<p>Of course Hulse was not to know that Carrados had been brought
in especially to genialise with him. Most of the blind man's
activities during that period came within the "Q-class" order. No
one ever heard of them, very often they would have seemed quite
meaningless under description, and generally they were things
that he alone could do&mdash;or do as effectively at all events.
In the obsolete phraseology of the day, they were his "bit."</p>

<p>"There's this man Hulse," Flinders had proceeded, when it came
to the business on which Carrados had been asked to call at
Whitehall. "Needless to say, he's no fool or Jonathan wouldn't
have sent him on the ticket he carries. If anything, he's too
keen&mdash;wants to see everything, do anything and go
everywhere. In the meanwhile he's kicking up his heels here in
London with endless time on his hands and the Lord only knows who
mayn't have a go at him."</p>

<p>"You mean for information&mdash;or does he carry papers?"
asked Carrados.</p>

<p>"Well, at present, information chiefly. He necessarily knows a
lot of things that would be priceless to the Huns, and a clever
man or woman might find it profitable to nurse him."</p>

<p>"Still, he must be on his guard if, as you say, he is&mdash;No
one imagines that London in 1917 is a snakeless Eden or expects
that German agents to-day are elderly professors who say, 'How
vos you?' and 'Ja, ja!'"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Flinders sapiently, "every American who
came to London before the war was on his guard against a
pleasant-spoken gentleman who would accost him with, 'Say,
stranger, does this happen to be your wallet lying around here on
the sidewalk?' and yet an unending procession of astute, long-
headed citizens met him, exactly as described, year after year,
and handed over their five hundred or five thousand pounds on a
tale that would have made a common or Michaelmas goose blush to
be caught listening to."</p>

<p>"It's a curious fact," admitted Carrados thoughtfully. "And
this Hulse?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's quite an agreeable chap, you'll find. He may know a
trifle more than you and be a little wider awake and see further
through a brick wall and so on, but he won't hurt your feelings
about it. Well, will you do it for us?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Carrados. "What is it, by the way?"</p>

<p>Flinders laughed his apologies and explained more
precisely.</p>

<p>"Hulse has been over here a month now, and it may be another
month before the details come through which he will take on to
Paris. Then he will certainly have documents of very special
importance that he must carry about with him. Well, in the
meanwhile, of course, he is entertained and may pal up with
anyone or get himself into Lord knows what. We can't keep him
here under lock and key or expect him to make a report of every
fellow he has a drink with or every girl he meets."</p>

<p>"Quite so," nodded the blind man.</p>

<p>"Actually, we have been asked to take precautions. It isn't
quite a case for the C.I.D.&mdash;not at this stage, that is to
say. So if I introduce him to you and you fix up an evening for
him or something of the sort and find out where his tastes lie,
and&mdash;and, in fact, keep a general shepherding eye upon
him&mdash;" He broke off abruptly, and Carrados divined that he
had reddened furiously and was kicking himself in spirit. The
blind man raised a deprecating hand.</p>

<p>"Why should you think that so neat a compliment would pain me,
Flinders?" he asked quietly. "Now if you had questioned the
genuineness of some of my favourite tetradrachms I might have had
reason to be annoyed. As it is, yes, I will gladly keep a general
shepherding ear on J. Beringer as long as may be needful."</p>

<p>"That's curious," said Flinders, looking up quickly. "I didn't
think that I had mentioned his front name."</p>

<p>"I don't think that you have," agreed Carrados.</p>

<p>"Then how&mdash;Had you heard of him before?"</p>

<p>"You don't give an amateur conjurer much chance," replied the
other whimsically. "When you brought me to this chair I found a
table by me, and happening to rest a hand on it my fingers had
'read' a line of writing before I realised it&mdash;just as your
glance might as unconsciously do," and he held up an envelope
addressed to Hulse.</p>

<p>"That is about the limit," exclaimed Flinders with some
emphasis. "Do you know, Carrados, if I hadn't always led a very
blameless life I should be afraid to have you around the
place."</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the introduction was made and in due
course the two callers left together.</p>

<p>"You'll see Mr. Carrados down, won't you?" Flinders had asked,
and, slightly puzzled but not disposed to question English ways,
Hulse had assented. In the passage Carrados laid a light hand on
his companion's arm. Through some subtle perception he read
Hulse's mild surprise.</p>

<p>"By the way, I don't think that Flinders mentioned my
infirmity," he remarked. "This part of the building is new to me
and I happen to be quite blind."</p>

<p>"You astonish me," declared Hulse, and he had to be assured
that the statement was literally exact. "You don't seem to miss
much by it, Mr. Carrados. Ever happen to hear of Laura
Bridgman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Carrados. "She was one of your star cases.
But Laura Bridgman's attainments really were wonderful. She was
also deaf and dumb, if you remember."</p>

<p>"That is so," assented Hulse. "My people come from New
Hampshire not far from Laura's home, and my mother had some of
her needlework framed as though it was a picture. That's how I
come to know of her, I reckon."</p>

<p>They had reached the street meanwhile and Carrados heard the
door of his waiting car opened to receive him.</p>

<p>"I'm going on to my club now to lunch," he remarked with his
hand still on his companion's arm. "Of course we only have a
wartime menu, but if you would keep me company you would be
acting the Good Samaritan," and Beringer Hulse, who was out to
see as much as possible of England, France and Berlin within the
time&mdash;perhaps, also, not uninfluenced by the appearance of
the rather sumptuous vehicle&mdash;did not refuse.</p>

<p>"Vurry kind of you to put it in that way, Mr. Carrados," he
said, in his slightly business-like, easy style. "Why, certainly
I will."</p>

<p>During the following weeks Carrados continued to make himself
very useful to the visitor, and Hulse did not find his stay in
London any less agreeably varied thereby. He had a few other
friends&mdash;acquaintances rather&mdash;he had occasion now and
then to mention, but they, one might infer, were either not quite
so expansive in their range of hospitality or so pressing for his
company. The only one for whom he had ever to excuse himself was
a Mr. Darragh, who appeared to have a house in Densham Gardens
(he was a little shrewdly curious as to what might be inferred of
the status of a man who lived in Densham Gardens), and, well,
yes, there was Darragh's sister, Violet. Carrados began to take a
private interest in the Darragh household, but there was little
to be learned beyond the fact that the house was let furnished to
the occupant from month to month. Even during the complexities of
war that fact alone could not be regarded as particularly
incriminating.</p>

<p>There came an evening when Hulse, having an appointment to
dine with Carrados and to escort him to a theatre afterwards,
presented himself in a mixed state of elation and remorse. His
number had come through at last, he explained, and he was to
leave for Paris in the morning. Carrados had been most awfully,
most frightfully&mdash;Hulse became quite touchingly incoherent
in his anxiety to impress upon the blind man the fullness of the
gratitude he felt, but, all the same, he had come to ask whether
he might cry off for the evening. There was no need to inquire
the cause. Carrados raised an accusing finger and pointed to the
little bunch of violets with which the impressionable young man
had adorned his button-hole.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, to some extent," admitted Hulse, with a facile
return to his ingenuous, easy way. "I happened to see Miss
Darragh down town this afternoon. There's a man they know whom
I've been crazy to meet for weeks, a Jap who has the whole ju-
jitsu business at his finger-ends. Best ju-jitsuist out of Japan,
Darragh says. Mighty useful thing, ju-jitsu, nowadays,
Carrados."</p>

<p>"At any time, indeed," conceded Carrados. "And he will be
there to-night?"</p>

<p>"Certain. They've tried to fix it up for me half-a-dozen times
before, but this Kuromi could never fit it in. Of course this
will be the only chance."</p>

<p>"True," agreed the blind man, rather absent-mindedly. "Your
last night here."</p>

<p>"I don't say that in any case I should not have liked to see
Violet&mdash;Miss Darragh&mdash;again before I went, but I
wouldn't have gone back on an arranged thing for that," continued
Hulse virtuously. "Now this ju-jitsu I look on more in the light
of business."</p>

<p>"Rather a rough-and-tumble business one would think,"
suggested Carrados. "Nothing likely to drop out of your pockets
in the process and get lost?"</p>

<p>Hulse's face displayed a rather more superior smile than he
would have permitted himself had his friend been liable to see it
and be snubbed thereby.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean, of course," he replied, getting up and
going to the blind man's chair, "but don't you worry about me,
Father William. Just put your hand to my breast pocket."</p>

<p>"Sewn up," commented Carrados, touching the indicated spot on
his guest's jacket.</p>

<p>"Sewn up: that's it; and since I've had any important papers
on me it always has been sewn up, no matter how often I change.
No fear of anything dropping out now&mdash;or being lifted out,
eh? No, <i>sir;</i> if what I carry there chanced to vanish, I
guess no excuses would be taken and J. B. H. would automatically
drop down to the very bottom of the class. As it is, if it's
missing I shall be missing too, so that won't trouble me."</p>

<p>"What time do you want to get there?"</p>

<p>"Darragh's? Well, I left that open. Of course I couldn't
promise until I had seen you. Anyway, not until after dinner, I
said."</p>

<p>"That makes it quite simple, then," declared Carrados. "Stay
and have dinner here, and afterwards we will go on to Darragh's
together instead of going to the theatre."</p>

<p>"That's most terribly kind of you," replied Hulse. "But won't
it be rather a pity&mdash;the tickets, I mean, and so forth?"</p>

<p>"There are no tickets as it happens," said Carrados. "I left
that over until to-night. And I have always wanted to meet a ju-
jitsu champion. Quite providential, isn't it?"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was nearly nine o'clock, and seated in the
drawing-room of his furnished house in Densham Gardens, affecting
to read an evening paper, Mr. Darragh was plainly ill at ease.
The strokes of the hour, sounded by the little gilt clock on the
mantelpiece, seemed to mark the limit of his patience. A muttered
word escaped him and he looked up with a frown.</p>

<p>"It was nine that Hulse was to be here by, wasn't it, Violet?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Miss Darragh, who had been regarding him for some time in
furtive anxiety, almost jumped at the simple question.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Hugh&mdash;about nine, that is. Of course he had
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Darragh irritably; "we've heard all
that. And Sims," he continued, more for the satisfaction of
voicing his annoyance than to engage in conversation, "swore by
everything that we should have that coat by eight at the very
latest. My God! what rotten tools one has to depend on!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;" began Violet timidly, and stopped at his
deepening scowl.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Darragh, with a deadly smoothness in his voice.
"Yes, Violet; pray continue. You were about to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was really nothing, Hugh," she pleaded. "Nothing at
all."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Violet, I am sure that you have some helpful little
suggestion to make," he went on in the same silky, deliberate
way. Even when he was silent his unspoken thoughts seemed to be
lashing her with bitterness, and she turned painfully away to
pick up the paper he had flung aside. "The situation, Kato,"
resumed Darragh, addressing himself to the third occupant of the
room, "is bluntly this: If Sims isn't here with that coat before
young Hulse arrives, all our carefully-thought-out plan, a
month's patient work, and about the last both of our cash and
credit, simply go to the devil!...and Violet wants to say that
perhaps Mr. Sims forgot to wind his watch last night or poor Mrs.
Sims's cough is worse...Proceed, Violet; don't be diffident."</p>

<p>The man addressed as "Kato" knocked a piece off the chessboard
he was studying and stooped to pick it up again before he
replied. Then he looked from one to the other with a face
singularly devoid of expression.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Who says?" he replied in his quaintly-ordered
phrases. "If it is to be, my friend, it will be."</p>

<p>"Besides, Hugh," put in Violet, with a faint dash of spirit,
"it isn't really quite so touch-and-go as that. If Sims comes
before Hulse has left, Kato can easily slip out and change coats
then."</p>

<p>Darragh was already on his restless way towards the door.
Apparently he did not think it worth while to reply to either of
the speakers, but his expression, especially when his eyes turned
to Violet, was one of active contempt. As the door closed after
him, Kato sprang to his feet and his impassive look gave place to
one almost of menace. His hands clenched unconsciously and with
slow footsteps he seemed to be drawn on in pursuit. A little
laugh, mirthless and bitter, from the couch, where Violet had
seated herself, recalled him.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Katie," she asked idly, "that you are really the
greatest ju-jitsuist outside Japan?"</p>

<p>"Polite other people say so," replied the Japanese, his voice
at once gentle and deprecating.</p>

<p>"And yet you cannot keep down even your little temper!"</p>

<p>Kato thought this over for a moment; then he crossed to the
couch and stood regarding the girl with his usual impenetrable
gravity.</p>

<p>"On contrary, I can keep down my temper very well," he said
seriously. "I can keep it so admirably that I, whose ancestors
were Samurai and very high nobles, have been able to become thief
and swindler and"&mdash;his moving hand seemed to beat the air
for a phrase&mdash;"and lo down dog and still to live. What does
anything it matter that is connected with me alone? But there are
three things that do matter&mdash;three that I do' not allow
myself to be insulted and still to live: my emperor, my country,
and&mdash;you. And so," concluded Kato Kuromi, in a somewhat
lighter vein, "now and then, as you say, my temper gets the
better of me slightly."</p>

<p>"Poor Katie," said Violet, by no means disconcerted at this
delicate avowal. "I really think that I am sorrier for you than I
am for Hugh, or even for myself. But it's no good becoming
romantic at this time of day, my dear man." The lines of her
still quite young and attractive face hardened in keeping with
her thoughts. "I suppose I've' had my chance. We're all of a
pattern and I'm as crooked as any of you now."</p>

<p>"No, no," protested Kato loyally; "not you of yourself. It is
we bad fellows round you. Darragh ought never to have brought you
into these things, and then to despise you for your
troubles&mdash;that is why my temper now and then ju-jitsues me.
This time it is the worst of all&mdash;the young man Hulse, for
whose benefit you pass yourself as the sister of your husband.
How any mortal man possessing you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Another cigarette, Katie, please," interrupted Violet, for
the monotonous voice had become slightly more penetrating than
was prudent. "That's all in the way of business, my friend. We
aren't a firm of family solicitors. Jack Hulse had to be
fascinated and I&mdash;well, if there is any hitch I don't think
that it can be called my fault," and she demonstrated for his
benefit the bewitching smile that had so effectually enslaved the
ardent Beringer.</p>

<p>"Fascinated!" retorted Kato, fixing on the word jealously, and
refusing to be pacified by the bribery of the smile. "Yes, so
infatuated has become this very susceptible young man that you
lead him about like pet lamb at the end of blue ribbon. Business?
Perhaps. But <i>how</i> have you been able to do this, Violet?
And you husband&mdash;Darragh&mdash;to him simply business, very
good business&mdash;and he forces you to do this full of shame
thing and mocks at you for reward."</p>

<p>"Kato, Kato&mdash;" urged Violet, breaking through his
scornful laughter.</p>

<p>"I am what your people call yellow man," continued Kato
relentlessly, "and you are the one white woman of my
dreams&mdash;dreams that I would not lift finger to spoil by
trying to make real. But if I should have been Darragh not ten
thousand times the ten thousand pounds that Hulse carries would
tempt me to lend you to another man's arms."</p>

<p>"Oh, Katie, how horrid you can be!"</p>

<p>"Horrid for me to say, but 'business' for you to do! How have
you discovered so much, Violet&mdash;what Hulse carries, where he
carries it, the size and shape the packet makes, even the way he
so securely keeps it? 'Business' eh? Your husband cares not so
long as we succeed. But I, Kato Kuromi, care." He went nearer so
that his mere: attitude was menacing as he stood over her, and
his usually smooth voice changed to a tone she had never heard
there before. <i>"How</i> have you learned all this? How, unless
you and Hulse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Sssh!" she exclaimed' in sharp dismay as her ear caught a
sound beyond.</p>

<p>"&mdash;oh yes," continued Kato easily, his voice instantly as
soft and unconcerned as ever, "it will be there, you mean. The
views in the valley of Kedu are considered very fine and the
river itself&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Darragh whom Violet had heard approaching, and he
entered the room in a much better temper than he had left it. At
the door he paused a moment to encourage someone forward&mdash;a
seedy, diffident man of more than middle age, who carried a
brown-paper parcel.</p>

<p>"Come on, Sim; hurry up, man!" urged Darragh impatiently, but
without the sting of contempt that had poisoned his speech
before. "And, oh, Phillips"&mdash;looking back and dropping his
voice&mdash;"when Mr. Hulse arrives show him into the morning-
room at first. Not up here, you understand? Now, Sims."</p>

<p>After a rather helpless look round for something suitable on
which to lay his parcel, the woebegone-looking individual was
attempting to untie it on an upraised knee.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he replied, endeavouring to impart a modicum of
briskness into his manner. "I'm sorry to be a bit late, sir; I
was delayed."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, never mind that now," said Darragh magnanimously.
"Thing quite all right?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sims isn't worse?" asked Violet kindly.</p>

<p>Mr. Sims managed to get his back to the group before he
ventured to reply.</p>

<p>"No, miss," he said huskily; "she's better now. She's dead:
died an hour ago. That's why I wasn't quite able to get here by
eight."</p>

<p>From each of his hearers this tragedy drew a characteristic
response. Violet gave a little moan of sympathy and turned away.
Kato regarded Sims, and continued to regard him, with the
tranquil incuriosity of the u pitying East. Darragh&mdash;Darragh
alone spoke, and his tone was almost genial.</p>

<p>"Devilish lucky that you were able to get here by now in the
circumstances, Sims," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Sims practically, "you see, I shall need
the money just as much now&mdash;though not quite for the same
purpose as I had planned." He took the garment from the paper and
shook it out before displaying it for Darragh's approval. "I
think you will find that quite satisfactory, sir."</p>

<p>"Exactly the same as the one your people made for Mr. Hulse a
week ago?" asked Darragh, glancing at the jacket and then passing
it on to Violet for her verdict.</p>

<p>"To a stitch, sir. A friend of mine up at the shop got the
measurements and the cloth is a length from the same piece."</p>

<p>"But the cut, Sims," persisted his patron keenly; "the cut is
the most important thing about it. It makes all the difference in
the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," acquiesced Sims dispassionately; "you can rely on
that. I used to be a first-class cutter myself before I took to
drink. I am yet, when I'm steady. And I machined both coats
myself."</p>

<p>"That should do then," said Darragh complacently. "Now you
were to have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ten guineas and the cost of the cloth you promised, sir. Of
course it's a very big price, and I won't deny that I've been a
bit uneasy about it from time to time when I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right." Darragh had no wish to keep Mr. Sims in
evidence a minute longer than was necessary.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to be doing anything wrong, sir," persisted
the poor creature; "and when you stipulated that it wasn't to be
mentioned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, man; it's a bet, didn't I tell you? I stand to
win a clear hundred if I can fool Hulse over this coat. That's
the long and short of it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I hope it is, sir. I've never been in trouble for
anything yet, and it would break my wife's 'art&mdash;" He
stopped suddenly and his weak face changed to a recollection of
his loss; then without another word he turned and made shakily
for the door.</p>

<p>"See him safely away, Katty, and pay him down below," said
Darragh. "I'll settle with you later," and the Japanese, with a
careless "All right-o," followed.</p>

<p>"Now, Violet, slip into it," continued her husband briskly.
"We don't want to keep Hulse waiting when he comes." From a
drawer in a cabinet near at hand he took a paper packet, prepared
in readiness, and passed it to her. "You have the right
cotton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hugh," said Violet, opening a little work-basket. She
had already satisfied herself that the coat was a replica of the
one the young American would wear, and she now transferred the
dummy package to the corresponding pocket and with a few deft
stitches secured it in the same way as she had already learned
that the real contents were safeguarded. "And, Hugh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well?" responded Darragh, with a return of his old
impatience.</p>

<p>"I don't wish to know all your plans, Hugh," continued Violet
meekly, "but I do want to warn you. You are running a most
tremendous risk with Kato."</p>

<p>"Oh, Kato!"</p>

<p>"It is really serious, Hugh. You don't believe in patriotism,
I know, but Kato happens to. When he learns that it isn't ten
thousand pounds at all, but confidential war plans, that this
scoop consists of, something terrible may happen."</p>

<p>"It might, Violet. Therefore I haven't told him, and I am so
arranging things that he will never know. Cheer up, my girl,
there will be no tragedy. All the same, thanks for the hint. It
shows a proper regard for your husband's welfare."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hugh, Hugh," murmured Violet, "if only you were more
often&mdash;"</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the result&mdash;if indeed there was
yet hope in an appeal to another and a better nature that he
might once have possessed&mdash;it came too late. The words were
interrupted by the sudden reappearance of Kato, his business with
Sims completed. He opened and closed the door quietly but very
quickly, and at a glance both the Darraghs saw that something
unforeseen had happened.</p>

<p>"Here's pretty go," reported the Japanese. "Hulse just come
and brought someone with him!"</p>

<p>For a moment all the conspirators stood aghast at the
unexpected complication. Hugh Darragh was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" he exclaimed, with a terrible look in his wife's
direction; "that may upset everything. What ghastly muddle have
you made now?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," pleaded Violet weakly. "I never dreamt
of such a thing. Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Slow man," amplified Kato with a nod. "Fellow who
walk&mdash;" He made a few steps with studied deliberation.</p>

<p>"Blind! It's Max Carrados," exclaimed Violet, in a flash of
enlightenment. "They have been great friends lately and Jack has
often spoken of him. He's most awfully clever in his way, but
stone blind. Hugh, Kato, don't you see? It's rather unfortunate
his being here, but it can't really make any difference."</p>

<p>"True, if he is quite blind," admitted Kato.</p>

<p>"I'll look into it," said Darragh briskly. "Coat's all ready
for you, Kato."</p>

<p>"I think no, yet," soliloquised the Japanese, critically
examining it. "Keep door, 'alf-a-mo', Violet, if please." His own
contribution to the coat's appearance was simple but
practical&mdash;a gentle tension here and there, a general
rumple, a dust on the floor and a final shake. "One week wear,"
he announced gravely as he changed into it and hid his own
away.</p>

<p>"Take your time, Mr. Carrados," Darragh's voice was heard
insisting on the stairs outside, and the next moment he stood
just inside the room, and before Hulse had quite guided Carrados
into view, drew Violet's attention to the necessity of removing
the button-hole that the Americans still wore by a significant
movement to the lapel of his own coat. It required no great
finesse on the girl's part to effect the transfer of the little
bunch of flowers to her own person within five minutes of the
guests' arrival.</p>

<p>"A new friend to see you, Violet&mdash;Mr. Carrados,"
announced Darragh most graciously. "Mr. Carrados, my sister."</p>

<p>"Not to <i>see</i> you exactly, Miss Darragh," qualified
Carrados. "But none the less to know you as well as if I did, I
hope."</p>

<p>"I wanted you to meet Max before I went, Miss Darragh,"
explained Hulse; "so I took the liberty of bringing him
round."</p>

<p>"You really <i>are</i> going then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. There seems no doubt about it this time. Twelve hours
from now I hope to be in Paris. I should say," amended the
ingenuous young man, "I <i>dread</i> to be in Paris, for it may
mean a long absence. That's where I rely on Carrados to become
what is called a 'connecting file' between us&mdash;to cheer my
solitude by letting me know when he has met you, or heard of you,
or, well, anything in fact."</p>

<p>"Take care, Mr. Hulse," she said. "Gallantry by proxy is a
dangerous game."</p>

<p>"That's just it," retorted Hulse. "Max is the only man I
shouldn't be jealous of&mdash;because he can't see you!"</p>

<p>While these amiable exchanges were being carried on between
the two young people, with Max Carrados standing benignly by,
Darragh found an opportunity to lower his voice for Kato's
benefit.</p>

<p>"It's all right about him," he declared. "We carry on."</p>

<p>"As we arranged?" asked Kato.</p>

<p>"Yes; exactly. Come across now." He raised his voice as he led
Kato towards the other group. "I don't think that either of you
has met Mr. Kuromi yet&mdash;Mr. Hulse, Mr. Carrados."</p>

<p>"I have been pining to meet you for weeks, sir," responded
Hulse with enthusiasm. "Mr. Darragh tells me what a wonderful
master of ju-jitsu you are."</p>

<p>"Oh, well; little knack, you know," replied Kato modestly.
"You are interested?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I regard it as a most useful accomplishment at
any time and particularly now. I only wish I'd taken it up when I
had the leisure."</p>

<p>"Let me find you an easy-chair, Mr. Carrados," said Violet
attentively. "I am sure that <i>you</i> won't be interested in so
strenuous a subject as ju-jitsu."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am, though," protested the blind man. "</p>

<p>I am interested in everything."</p>

<p>"But surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't actually see the ju-jitsuing, you would say? Quite
true, but do you know, Miss Darragh, that makes a great deal less
difference than you might imagine. I have my sense of touch, my
sense of taste, my hearing&mdash;even my unromantic
nose&mdash;and you would hardly believe how they have rallied to
my assistance since sight went. For instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>They had reached the chair to which Miss Darragh had piloted
him. To guide him into it she had taken both his hands, but now
Carrados had gently disengaged himself and was lightly holding
her left hand between both of his.</p>

<p>"For instance, Hulse and I were speaking of you the other
day&mdash;forgive our impertinence&mdash;and he happened to
mention that you disliked rings of any sort and had never worn
one. His eyes, you see, and perhaps a careless remark on your
part. Now I <i>know</i> that until quite recently you continually
wore a ring upon this finger."</p>

<p>Silence had fallen upon the other men as they followed
Carrados's exposition. Into the moment of embarrassment that
succeeded this definite pronouncement Mr. Hulse threw a cheerful
note.</p>

<p>"Oh ho, Max, you've come a cropper this time," he exclaimed.
"Miss Darragh has never worn a ring. Have you?"</p>

<p>"N-o," replied Violet, a little uncertain of her ground, as
the blind man continued to smile benevolently upon her.</p>

<p>"A smooth and rather broad one," he continued persuasively.
"Possibly a wedding ring?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Violet, wait a minute," interposed Darragh,
endeavouring to look judicially wise with head bent to one side.
He was doubtful if Violet could carry the point without incurring
some suspicion, and he decided to give her a lead out of it.
"Didn't I see you wearing some sort of plain ring a little time
ago? You have forgotten, but I really believe Mr. Carrados may be
right. Think again."</p>

<p>"Of course!" responded Violet readily; "how stupid of me! It
was my mother's wedding ring. I found it in an old desk and wore
it to keep it safe. That was really how I found out that I could
not bear the feel of one and I soon gave it up."</p>

<p>"What did I say?" claimed Darragh genially. "I thought that we
should be right."</p>

<p>"This is really much interesting," said Kato. "I very greatly
like your system, Mr. Carrados."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's scarcely a system," deprecated Max good-naturedly;
"it's almost second nature with me now. I don't have to consider,
say, 'Where is the window?' if I want it. I know with certainty
that the window lies over here." He had not yet taken the chair
provided, and suiting the action to the word he now took a few
steps towards the wall where the windows were. "Am I not right?"
And to assure himself he stretched out a hand and encountered the
heavy curtains.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," admitted Violet hurriedly, "but, oh, please do be
careful, Mr. Carrados. They are most awfully particular about the
light here since the last raid. We go in fear and trembling lest
a glimmer should escape."</p>

<p>Carrados smiled and nodded and withdrew from the dangerous
area. He faced the room again.</p>

<p>"Then there is the electric light&mdash;heat at a certain
height of course."</p>

<p>"True," assented Kato, "but why <i>electric</i> light?"</p>

<p>"Because no other is noiseless and entirely without smell;
think&mdash;gas, oil, candles, all betray their composition yards
away. Then"&mdash;indicating the fireplace&mdash;"I suppose you
can only smell soot in damp weather? The
mantelpiece"&mdash;touching it&mdash;"inlaid marble. The
wallpaper"&mdash;brushing his hand over its
surface&mdash;"arrangement of pansies on a criss-cross
background"; lifting one finger to his lips&mdash;"colour scheme
largely green and gold."</p>

<p>Possibly Mr. Hulse thought that his friend had demonstrated
his qualities quite enough. Possibly&mdash;at any rate he now
created a diversion:</p>

<p>"Engraving of Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse, suspended two
feet seven inches from the ceiling on a brass-headed nail
supplied by a one-legged ironmonger whose Aunt Jane&mdash;"</p>

<p>All contributed a sufficiently appreciative
laugh&mdash;Carrados's not the least hearty&mdash;except Kato,
whose Asiatic dignity was proof against the form of jesting.</p>

<p>"You see what contempt familiarity breeds, Miss Darragh,"
remarked the blind man. "I look to you, Mr. Kuromi, to avenge me
by putting Hulse in a variety of undignified attitudes on the
floor."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't mind that if at the same time you put me up to a
trick or two," said Hulse, turning to the Japanese.</p>

<p>"You wish?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do. I've seen the use of it. It's good; it's
scientific. When I was crossing, one of the passengers held up a
bully twice his weight in the neatest way possible. It looked
quite simple, something like this, if I may?" Kato nodded his
grave assent and submitted himself to Mr. Hulse's vigorous grasp.
"'Now,' said the man I'm speaking of, 'struggle and your right
arm's broken.' But I expect you know the grip?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Kato, veiling his private amusement, "and
therefore foolish to struggle. Expert does not struggle; gives
way." He appeared to do so, to be falling helplessly in fact, but
the assailant found himself compelled to follow, and the next
moment he was lying on his back with Kato politely extending a
hand to assist him up again.</p>

<p>"I must remember that," said Hulse thoughtfully. "Let me see,
it goes&mdash;do you mind putting me wise on that again, Mr.
Kuromi? The motion picture just one iota slower this time,
please."</p>

<p>For the next ten or twenty minutes the demonstration went on
in admirable good humour, and could Max Carrados have seen he
would certainly have witnessed his revenge. At the end of the
lesson both men were warm and dusty&mdash;so dusty that Miss
Darragh felt called upon to apologise laughingly for the
condition of the rug. But if clothes were dusty, hands were
positively dirty&mdash;there was no other word for it.</p>

<p>"No, really, the poor mat can't be so awful as that," declared
the girl. "Wherever have you been, Mr. Kuromi? and, oh, Mr. Hulse
you are just as bad."</p>

<p>"I do not know," declared Kato, regarding his grimy fingers
seriously. "Nowhere of myself. Yes, I think it must be your
London atmosphere among the rug after all."'</p>

<p>"At all events you can't&mdash;Oh, Hugh, take them to the
bathroom, will you? And I'll try to entertain Mr. Carrados
meanwhile&mdash;only he will entertain me instead, I know."</p>

<p>It was well and simply done throughout&mdash;nothing forced,
and the sequence of development quite natural. Indeed, it was not
until Hulse saw Kuromi take off his coat in the bathroom that he
even thought of what he carried. "Well, Carrados," he afterwards
pleaded to his friend, "now could I wash my hands before those
fellows like a guy who isn't used to washing? It isn't natural.
It isn't human." So for those few minutes the two coats hung side
by side, and Darragh kindly brushed them. When Hulse put on his
own again his hand instinctively felt for the hidden packet; his
fingers reassured themselves among the familiar objects of his
pockets, and his mind was perfectly at ease.</p>

<p>"You old scoundrel, Max," he said, when he returned to the
drawing room. "You told Kuromi to wipe the floor with me and, by
crumbs, he did! Have a cigarette all the same."</p>

<p>Miss Darragh laughed pleasantly and took the opportunity to
move away to learn from her accomplices if all had gone well.
Carrados was on the point of passing over the proffered olive
branch when he changed his mind. He leaned forward and with slow
deliberation chose a cigarette from the American's case. Exactly
when the first subtle monition of treachery reached him by what
sense it was conveyed&mdash;Hulse never learned, for there were
experiences among the finer perceptions that the blind man did
not willingly discuss. Not by voice or outward manner in that
arresting moment did he betray an inkling of his suspicion, yet
by some responsive telephony Hulse at once, though scarcely
conscious of it then, grew uneasy and alert.</p>

<p>"Thanks; I'll take a light from yours," remarked Carrados,
ignoring the lit match, and he rose to avail himself. His back
was towards the others, who still had a word of instruction to
exchange. With cool precision he handled the cloth on Hulse's
outstretched arm, critically touched the pocket he was already
familiar with, and then deliberately drew the lapel to his
face.</p>

<p>"You wore some violets?" he said beneath his breath.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hulse, "but I&mdash;Miss Darragh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But there never have been any <i>here!</i> By heavens, Hulse,
we're in it! You had your coat off just now?</p>

<p>"Yes, for a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quietly. Keep your cigarette going. You'll have to leave this
to me. Back me up&mdash;discreetly&mdash;whatever I do."</p>

<p>"Can't we challenge it and insist&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not in this world. They have at least one other man
downstairs&mdash;in Cairo, a Turk by the way, before I was blind,
of course. Not up to Mr. Kuromi, I expect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cool again?" asked Miss Darragh sociably. It was her approach
that had sent Carrados off into irrelevances. "Was the experience
up to anticipation?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I may say it was," admitted Hulse guardedly.
"There is certainly a lot to learn here. I expect you've seen it
all before?"</p>

<p>Oh, no. It is a great honour to get Mr. Kuromi to 'show it
off,' as he quaintly calls it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should say so," replied the disillusioned young man
with deadly simplicity. "I quite feel that."</p>

<p>"J. B. H. is getting strung up," thought Carrados. "He may say
something unfortunate presently." So he deftly insinuated himself
into the conversation and for a few minutes the commonplaces of
the topic were rigidly maintained.</p>

<p>"Care for a hand at auction?" suggested Darragh, joining the
group. He had no desire to keep his guests a minute longer than
he need, but at the same time it was his line to behave quite
naturally until they left. "Oh, but I forgot&mdash;Mr.
Carrados&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am well content to sit and listen," Carrados assured him.
"Consider how often I have to do that without the entertainment
of a game to listen to! And you are four without me."</p>

<p>"It really hardly seems&mdash;" began Violet.</p>

<p>"I'm sure Max will feel it if he thinks that he is depriving
us," put in Hulse loyally, so with some more polite protestation
it was arranged and the game began, Carrados remaining where he
was. In the circumstances a very high standard of bridge could
not be looked for; the calling was a little wild; the play more
than a little loose; the laughter rather shrill or rather flat;
the conversation between the hands forced and spasmodic. All were
playing for time in their several interpretations of it; the
blind man alone was thinking beyond the immediate moment.</p>

<p>Presently there was a more genuine burst of laughter than any
hitherto. Kato had revoked, and, confronted with it, had made a
naive excuse. Carrados rose with the intention of going nearer
when a distressing thing occurred. Half-way across the room he
seemed to slip, plunged forward helplessly, and came to the
floor, involved in a light table as he fell. All the players were
on their feet in an instant. Darragh assisted his guest to rise;
Violet took an arm; Kato looked about the floor curiously, and
Hulse&mdash;Hulse stared hard at Max and wondered what the
thunder this portended.</p>

<p>"Clumsy, clumsy," murmured Carrados beneath his breath.
"Forgive me, Miss Darragh."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Carrados!" she exclaimed in genuine distress. "Aren't
you really hurt?</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," he declared lightly. "Or at all events," he
amended, bearing rather more heavily upon her support as he took
a step, "nothing to speak of."</p>

<p>"Here is pencil," said Kuromi, picking one up from the
polished floor. "You must have slipped on this."</p>

<p>"Stepping on a pencil is like that," contributed Hulse wisely.
"It acts as a kind of roller-skate."</p>

<p>"Please don't interrupt the game any more," pleaded the
victim. "At the most, at the very worst, it is
only&mdash;oh!&mdash;a negligible strain."</p>

<p>"I don't know that any strain, especially of the ankle, is
negligible, Mr. Carrados," said Darragh with cunning foresight.
"I think it perhaps ought to be seen to."</p>

<p>"A compress when I get back will be all that is required,"
maintained Carrados. "I should hate to break up the evening.</p>

<p>"Don't consider that for a moment," urged the host hospitably.
"If you really think that it would be wiser in the
end&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps&mdash;" assented the other, weakening in his
resolution.</p>

<p>"Shall I 'phone up a taxi?" asked Violet.</p>

<p>"Thank you, if you would be so kind&mdash;or, no; perhaps my
own car would be rather easier in the circumstances. My man will
be about, so that it will take very little longer."</p>

<p>"I'll get through for you," volunteered Darragh. "What's your
number?"</p>

<p>The telephone was in a corner of the room. The connection was
soon obtained and Darragh turned to his guest for the
message.</p>

<p>"I'd better speak," said Carrados&mdash;he had limped across
on Hulse's arm&mdash;taking over the receiver. "Excellent fellow,
but he'd probably conclude that I'd been killed...That you,
Parkinson?...Yes, at 155 Densham Gardens. I'm held up here by a
slight accident...No, no, nothing serious, but I might have some
difficulty in getting back without assistance. Tell Harris I
shall need him after all, as soon as he can get here&mdash;the
car that's handiest. That's&mdash;oh, and, Parkinson, bring along
a couple of substantial walking-sticks with you. Any time now.
That's all...Yes...yes." He put up the receiver with a thrill of
satisfaction that he had got his message safely through. "Held
up"&mdash;a phrase at once harmless and significant&mdash;was the
arranged shift-key into code. It was easy for a blind man to
receive some hurt that held him up. Once or twice Carrados's
investigations had got him into tight places, but in one way or
another he had invariably got out again.</p>

<p>"How far is your place away?" someone asked, and out of the
reply a time-marking conversation on the subject of getting about
London's darkened streets and locomotion in general arose. Under
cover of this Kato drew Darragh aside to the deserted card-
table.</p>

<p>"Not your pencil, Darragh?" he said quietly, displaying the
one he had picked up.</p>

<p>"No; why?"</p>

<p>"I not altogether like this, is why," replied the Japanese. "I
think it Carrados own pencil. That man have too many ways of
doing things, Darragh. It was mistake to let him 'phone."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense; you heard what he said. Don't get jumpy, man.
The thing has gone like clockwork."</p>

<p>"So far, yes. But I think I better go now and come back in one
hour or so, safer for all much."</p>

<p>Darragh, for very good reasons, had the strongest objections
to allowing his accomplice an opportunity of examining the spoil
alone. "Look here, Katty," he said with decision, "I must have
you in case there does come a scrimmage. I'll tell Phillips to
fasten the front door well, and then we can see that it's all
right before anyone comes in. If it is, there's no need for you
to run away; if there's the least doubt we can knock these two
out and have plenty of time to clear by the back way we've got."
Without giving Kato any chance of raising further objection he
turned to his guests again.</p>

<p>"I think I remember your tastes, Hulse," he said suavely. "I
hope that you have no objection to Scotch whisky, Mr. Carrados?
We still have a few bottles left. Or perhaps you prefer
champagne?"</p>

<p>Carrados had very little intention of drinking anything in
that house, nor did he think that with ordinary procrastination
it would be necessary.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," he replied tentatively. "Should you
permit the invalid either, Miss Darragh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, in moderation," she smiled. "I think I hear your
car," she added, and stepping to the window ventured to peep
out.</p>

<p>It was true. Mr. Darragh had run it a shade too fine for once.
For a moment he hesitated which course to take&mdash;to see who
was arriving or to convey a warning to his henchman down below.
He had turned towards the door when Violet's startled voice
recalled him to the window.</p>

<p>"Hugh!" she called sharply. "Here, Hugh;" and as he reached
her, in a breathless whisper, "There are men inside the
car&mdash;two more at least."</p>

<p>Darragh had to decide very quickly this time. His choice was
not without its element of fineness. "Go down and see about it,
Katty," he said, looking Kato straight in the eyes. "And tell
Phillips about the whisky."</p>

<p>"Door locked," said the Japanese tersely. "Key other
side."</p>

<p>"The key was on this side," exclaimed Darragh fiercely.
"Hulse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hell!" retorted Beringer expressively. "That jacket doesn't
go out of the room without me this journey."</p>

<p>Darragh had him covered before he had finished speaking.</p>

<p>"Quick," he rapped out. "I'll give you up to three, and if the
key isn't out then, by God, I'll plug you, Hulse! One,
two&mdash;"</p>

<p>The little "ping!" that followed was not the automatic but the
release of the electric light switch as Carrados, unmarked among
this climax, pressed it up. In the absolute blackness that
followed Darragh spun round to face the direction of this new
opponent.</p>

<p>"Shoot by all means, Mr. Darragh, if you are used to firing in
the dark," said Carrados's imperturbable voice. "But in any case
remember that I am. As I am a dead shot by sound, perhaps
everyone had better remain exactly where he&mdash;or she, I
regret to have to add, Miss Darragh&mdash;now is."</p>

<p>"You dog!" spat out Darragh.</p>

<p>"I should not even talk," advised the blind man, "I am
listening for my friends and I might easily mistake your motive
among the hum of conversation."</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. In all innocence Phillips had opened
the door to Parkinson, and immeasurably to his surprise two
formidable-looking men of official type had followed in from
somewhere. By a sort of instinct&mdash;or possibly a momentary
ray of light had been their guide&mdash;they came direct to the
locked door.</p>

<p>"Parkinson," called Carrados.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied that model attendant.</p>

<p>"We are all in here; Mr. Hulse and myself, and three&mdash;I
am afraid that I can make no exception&mdash;three unfriendlies.
At the moment the electric light is out of action, the key of the
locked door has been mislaid, and firearms are being
promiscuously flourished in the dark. That is the position. Now
if you have the key, Hulse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have," replied Hulse grimly, "but for a fact I dropped it
down my neck out of harm's way and where the plague it's got
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>As it happened the key was not required. The heavier of the
officers outside, believing in the element of surprise, stood
upon one foot and shot the other forward with the force and
action of an engine piston-rod. The shattered door swung inward
and the three men rushed into the room.</p>

<p>Darragh had made up his mind, and as the door crashed he
raised his hand to fire into the thick. But at that moment the
light flashed on again and almost instantly was gone. Before his
dazzled eyes and startled mind could adjust themselves to this he
was borne down. When he rose again his hands were manacled.</p>

<p>"So," he breathed laboriously, bending a vindictive eye upon
his outwitter. "When next we meet it will be my turn, I
think."</p>

<p>"We shall never meet again," replied Carrados impassively.
"There is no other turn for you, Darragh."</p>

<p>"But where the blazes has Kuromi got to?" demanded Hulse with
sharp concern. "He can't have quit?"</p>

<p>One of the policemen walked to a table in the farthest corner
of the room, looked down beyond it, and silently raised a
beckoning hand. They joined him there.</p>

<p>"Rum way these foreigners have of doing things," remarked the
other disapprovingly. "Now who the Hanover would ever think of a
job like that?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," mused the blind man, as he waited for the
official arrangements to go through, "that presently I shall have
to live up to Hulse's overwhelming bewonderment. And yet if I
pointed out to him that the button-hole of the coat he is now
wearing still has a stitch in it to keep it in shape and could
not by any possibility...Well, well, perhaps better not. It is a
mistake for the conjurer to explain."</p>

<p><i>Preston Beach, 1917.</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. REVOLUTION</h2>

<p class="first">THE night was blusterous with sudden squalls and
gusts of rain, and intervals when the full moon rode serene among
scurrying clouds. It being past midnight, Paris slept, but slept
lightly, for the period was that of the autumn of 1793. Few
wayfarers were to be seen, and those who were about moved both
quickly and warily as though engaged on business of danger and
despatch.</p>

<p>At a corner of the Rue S. Michael two men, coming from
opposite directions, were caught by the full force of an eddying
blast, and in a moment two hats were careering along the street
with their owners in angry pursuit. Each man seized the first
that came to hand, crammed it upon his head more firmly than
before, and sought the nearest doorway to regain breath and
composure before continuing his journey. Then, as they had taken
refuge beneath the same arch, each began to regard the other, as
men mostly did in those days, a little suspiciously at first.</p>

<p>"A stormy night, citizen," remarked the more sociable of the
two.</p>

<p>"Stormy times altogether," replied the other. "But surely,
citizen, your voice is somehow familiar to me."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, it cannot be&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Philippe Buton, citizen. And you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Dumont&mdash;your old friend of the office in the Place du
Temple&mdash;Louis Dumont. Surely you have not forgotten?"</p>

<p>"Forgotten! I should think not. And is it really you, Dumont,
after all these years? A strange chance that brings us thus
together!"</p>

<p>"Strange indeed! And wearing each other's hat, it would
appear. At least, this one feels uncommonly tight to me."</p>

<p>"I believe you are right, Louis. There is an unusual roominess
in the one that I have on&mdash;" They laughed and exchanged
hats, and Buton resumed, "Since we must exchange hats, we may as
well exchange confidences. What brings you here at this
hour?"</p>

<p>"Agreed," responded Dumont. "All the same, you are about the
only man to whom I would care to confide the nature of my errand.
Briefly, it is a matter of the public good and of private
vengeance."</p>

<p>"Vengeance?"</p>

<p>"Just retribution, let us rather say. In the years since we
lost sight of one another, Philippe, I have become
married&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I congratulate you!"</p>

<p>"You have small reason to do so. I do not speak of it more
than is necessary. You understand? The man on whom I would be
avenged is an aristocrat. At his hands I have suffered a wrong
which nothing but his death can satisfy. And I have justice on my
side, Philippe; justice and morality and the public welfare.
Already this beggarly marquis has been condemned by the
Committee, and his execution is only a matter of bringing him to
trial. But he fled, and for six months has been abroad. Now, by
the merest chance, I have heard something from which I gather
that he has secretly returned and at this moment is in
Paris."</p>

<p>"I see," interrupted Buton. "And you would seek out the
scoundrel and settle accounts with him before the guillotine robs
you of that satisfaction."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," replied Dumont dryly. "Why should I take the
risk? And ten to one he would decline to cross swords with me.
No, Buton, so long as he dies it is not a great matter how.
Indeed, an end at the hands of the public executioner is the more
ignominious and therefore the better way. Once I am certain of
his presence I have only to convey a word and the thing is
done."</p>

<p>It was now Buton's turn to explain his errand. He, also, would
have spoken with reserve, but Dumont's confidence and the trust
which he reposed in his former friend encouraged him to be no
less open.</p>

<p>"What you tell me makes our meeting all the more curious," he
remarked, "for I too am on my way to find a proscribed
aristocrat. There is this difference, however, that whereas you
very justly would destroy a worthless libertine, my errand is to
give timely warning to a virtuous nobleman whose chivalrous
protection of my family, even at the risk of his own life, has
placed me under an everlasting obligation."</p>

<p>"A dangerous business in these times," remarked Dumont
significantly.</p>

<p>"Otherwise there would be little merit in it. However, Dumont,
I am as good a citizen as you at heart, and to prove it I will
accompany you and take part in whatever risk your adventure may
entail."</p>

<p>"Good. And to show you that I am no less broad-minded,
Philippe, I will also join forces with you in your enterprise,
and back you up if it should be necessary."</p>

<p>They had walked along as they conversed, and by this time had
reached the end of the street, where they paused, each waiting
for the other to indicate the direction he would take.</p>

<p>"I go by the Rue des Murailles," said Dumont, "but perhaps
you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Buton. "That is my way also."</p>

<p>A little farther on Dumont stopped at the corner of a narrow
by-way.</p>

<p>"This leads through to the Place de Chaumont, where my fox has
gone to earth," he said. "Shall we get on with my affair first as
it lies nearest?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," assented his companion. "But it is to the Place
de Chaumont that my errand also takes us."</p>

<p>"The house opposite the lead fountain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"I mean that that is where the Marquis de Salais hides."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed Buton, with his mind full of his own
affair. "As we are so near we may as well take my business first
and warn him."</p>

<p>"Warn? Damnation! He is the man whom we have come to deliver
up!"</p>

<p>For a moment the two adventurers stared at one another in a
common emotion of dismay.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Buton, "here's a pretty kettle of fish!"</p>

<p>"It's plain that we can't both succeed," assented Dumont.</p>

<p>"And our plan for mutual support would seem to present
difficulties."</p>

<p>"I confess I don't see what we are to do. If de Salais is
capable of the exalted behaviour with which you credit
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, he is really the depraved
voluptuary that you have reason to&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's all the row about?" growled a rough voice from behind.
"Can't you go somewhere else than on a man's own doorstep to
quarrel over him?"</p>

<p>Half unconsciously they had been proceeding on their mutual
way and they now stood, without up to that time being aware of
it, by the house opposite the lead fountain. The door was open
and a citizen of burly aspect lounged within the shadow.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this is where M. le Marquis&mdash;Citizen Salais,
that is to say, lodges then?" stammered Dumont.</p>

<p>"So I am now told. But citizen or marquis he's
flown&mdash;cleared off for le Mans six hours ago."</p>

<p>"Le Mans!" shrieked Dumont. "Why, my wife is at le Mans. I
sent her there for safety!"</p>

<p>"But, good heavens! Mascot, who knows him well by sight, went
to le Mans only yesterday," faltered Buton. "He has walked
straight into the lion's mouth."</p>

<p>"He really has gone?" demanded Dumont of the doorkeeper, with
an excess of suspicion.</p>

<p>The burly individual stood aside.</p>

<p>"Oh, go up and see for yourselves," he suggested caustically.
"First chamber to the front. Don't stand on any ceremony, honest
citizens; everyone in Paris goes in and out everywhere, just as
he pleases, nowadays. Step up, and don't forget to look up the
chimney while you're about it."</p>

<p>Under his sardonic insistence the two friends found themselves
making their way into de Salais's deserted room. Dumont picked up
a lamp from a bracket on the stairs and held it aloft. Plainly
the marquis was gone, and by the evidence around he had left
hurriedly, for many of his gay belongings lay flung about the
room.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, these aristocrats were a set of peacocks,"
exclaimed Dumont, in half-envious contempt. "Look at this pearl
silk waistcoat, and this blue satin coat, and this hat! I fancy
myself in this get-up, Philippe. Let's see how it suits."</p>

<p>He slipped off his own upper garments and drew on those that
had taken his fancy. Not to seem to stand aloof Buton followed
his example, and tried the effect of a canary-coloured coat, with
elaborate lace frillings. As they were thus engaged there was an
irregular tramp of feet in the square outside. Then a "Halt!"</p>

<p>The half-intoxicated officer in charge of the handful of
undisciplined rascality lurched across to the doorway opposite
the lead fountain.</p>

<p>"The so-called Marquis de Salais&mdash;which is his room,
citizen?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"First to the front," replied the doorkeeper stolidly.</p>

<p>"There's something going on out there," said Dumont, as the
"Halt!" reached them. Then he opened the window and stepped out
on to the balcony.</p>

<p>"Prepare&mdash;fire!" commanded the officer.</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Buton. "They're mistaking him&mdash;"
Then he too stepped through the window to shout a warning.</p>

<p>"Diable, another marquis!" exclaimed the officer in vinous
bewilderment. "Squad&mdash;fire again!"</p>

<p>The squad fired again, and Buton fell lifeless across the
figure in the blue satin coat.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII. SMOTHERED IN CORPSES</h2>

<p class="letter">The author of the following story deems it
permissible to himself to explain that the work was projected,
and, indeed, almost completed, as a 120,000 word serial of
feuilleton scope, when a much-advertised competition for stories
of not more than 4000 words in length came under his notice. Not
to be deterred by the conditions, he at once set himself to the
formidable task of reducing his manuscript to one-thirtieth of
its original length. The result must, of course, be regarded
purely on its merits, but in the writer's own opinion the process
of compression has, if anything, keyed up the action to an even
tenser pitch, without in any way detracting from the interest of
the plot or circumscribing the wealth of incident.</p>

<h3>1. THE END OF THE BEGINNING</h3>

<p class="first">WHERE had it come from?</p>

<p>I, John Beveledge Humdrum, general practitioner, of 305A,
Hammersmith Road, Kensington, had come down to breakfast on that
eventful July morning expecting nothing more exciting than the
eggs and bacon with which my excellent man Perkins had regularly
provided me on similar occasions for the past eleven years.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise, therefore, on throwing open the door of
the book-case that contained my sparse collection of medical
works, in order to consult <i>Abernethy on Biscuits</i>, to be
confronted by the doubled-up corpse of a young man of
distinguished appearance, wearing a suit of evening clothes of
the most expensive cut.</p>

<p>My thoughts flew back to the events of the previous evening in
an attempt to unravel the mystery. Had anything remarkable
happened? And then I remembered an incident, trivial enough in
itself, which might supply a clue. At about eight o'clock I had
received a professional summons, notable as being the first in my
career. A heavily-veiled woman wearing a complete set of massive
ermines had descended from a magnificently-appointed motor-car
before my door. In response to her impassioned appeal, delivered
with a marked Castilian accent, I had accompanied her to a
miserable tenement dwelling in a sordid Limehouse slum. Here,
after I had reluctantly given a pledge of secrecy and permitted
myself to be blindfolded (even to this day the mingled aroma of
Enigma Vanishing Cream and frying spaghetti vividly recalls the
scene), I was taken to the bedside of my patient, a fair-haired
boy of three or four. A villainous-looking Chinaman who was in
attendance gave me to understand, partly by signs and partly in
pidgin English, that the child had swallowed a bone button. Being
unacquainted with the exact treatment of such a case I
recommended his removal to the nearest hospital. As there was
nothing more to detain me I left at once, overwhelmed by the
passionate gratitude of my mysterious caller; but as I glanced
back at the corner of the disreputable street, I saw a face
charged with diabolical hatred watching me from the grimy window
of the room I had just quitted. It was the visage of the aged
Chinaman, who but a moment before had been bowing to me with true
Oriental deference. As I looked, rather puzzled to account for
his strange behaviour, a terrible explosion shook the ground, the
front of the house disappeared, and a singed pigtail fell at my
feet.</p>

<p>Recalling all this I was on the point of ringing for Perkins
in order to question him, when something caused me to
hesitate.</p>

<p>It was well that I did so. The next moment the double doors of
the French window that overlooked the bustling turmoil of
Kensington's busiest thoroughfare were flung frantically open and
there sprang into the room a young girl whose dazzling beauty
was, if possible, heightened by the breathless excitement under
which she was labouring.</p>

<p>"Dr. Humdrum," she exclaimed, throwing aside the luxuriant
crimson opera cloak that had hitherto concealed the supple
perfection of her lithe form, "save me! Help me!" and a look of
baffling terror swept across her mobile features.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I stammered, bewildered for the moment by this
strange intrusion into the dull routine of my commonplace
existence, "but first let me have your name and address for
entering into my callers' book."</p>

<p>For reply she dragged from her finger a ring set with a
cluster of diamonds that had once, as I was afterwards to learn,
graced the crown of an Eastern potentate, and with impulsive
generosity flung it into the coal-scuttle.</p>

<p>"Call me Erratica," she murmured, with a slightly different
look of terror contorting her lovely features. (And here, for the
sake of brevity, I would remark that during the first seven weeks
of our strange friendship she either shook with terror or
shivered with apprehension whenever she spoke to me or I to her.)
"Seek to know no more. Only save me!"</p>

<p>I was at my wits' end. She had already, with a gesture of
loathing, hurled out of the window the glass of sal volatile
which I had poured out for her, and that exhausted the first-aid
remedies with which I was familiar.</p>

<p>"Save you from what?"</p>

<p>"From my enemies. I saw them knocking at your door. That is
why I came in by the window."</p>

<p>"Would it not have been more prudent&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered, tapping her exquisitely-modelled
musical comedy teeth with her shapely Italian forefinger. "They
are at hand. Play your part well." Then, with unsuspected
strength and a knowledge of the arrangements of my modest
apartment that me, she tore open the door of the book-case,
corpse that it contained on to my dissecting table, and without a
moment's hesitation took its place and pulled the door to after
her.</p>

<p>"Open in the name of the law!"</p>

<p>Rather perturbed as to what the fair creature required me to
do, I obeyed the summons and was relieved to see before me the
burly form of Inspector Badger of the Detective Service, an
officer with whom I was well acquainted.</p>

<p>"Rum case, that of the murdered prima-donna, Dr. Humdrum," he
remarked affably. As he spoke he took a seat on the corner of the
dissecting table and thus, luckily enough, overlooked its grim
burden in the glance of keen professional scrutiny that he cast
round the room. "I thought that I'd just look you up and see if
you knew anything about it before I ordered any arrests."</p>

<p>"Murdered prima-donna!" I stammered. "I haven't even heard of
it. Surely you don't suspect&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Suspect you?" said the Inspector with a hearty laugh. "Why,
no, sir; but as it happens a bone button, wrapped in a sheet of
paper bearing one of your prescriptions, had been used to gag the
poor creature with. That and the yard of pigtail tied round her
neck are our only clues as yet."</p>

<p>At the mention of these details I could not repress a start,
which would scarcely have escaped Badger's notice had he not been
engaged at the moment in taking a wax impression of my boots.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," I remarked, with all the nonchalance I
could muster. "I have heard nothing. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Señora Rosamunda de Barcelona, the celebrated Spanish
singer," replied the Inspector. "She left Covent Garden at half-
past eleven last night, alone and wearing a crimson opera
cloak."</p>

<p>"Surely that was rather late to be shopping," I interposed,
with the happy inspiration of diverting his attention. "Would not
the market then be closed?"</p>

<p>"I understand that there is a sort of play-house there, where
a lot of these foreigners appear," he replied guardedly. "By the
way now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Possibly the compromising garment lying on the floor between
us would not have caught Badger's eye had I not endeavoured to
kick it beneath the table. However, the thing was done.</p>

<p>"Ah, my old M.D. gown of the University of Plough-handle, Ga.,
U.S.A.," I explained, with a readiness that astonishes me to this
day, as I followed the direction of his glance. "I use it as a
dressing-gown."</p>

<p>"Very natty too," he remarked. "Well, at seven this morning
the Señora was discovered propped up in the vestibule of the
Hotel Majestic, stabbed in eleven places."</p>

<p>"And the opera cloak?" I felt impelled to ask.</p>

<p>The opera cloak had disappeared.</p>

<p>I rose to indicate that the instalment was almost complete.
The Inspector took the hint.</p>

<p>"I'll look you up later in the day if anything really baffling
turns up," he promised as he walked towards the door. Suddenly he
paused and faced the book-case.</p>

<p>"What was that, sir? Didn't you hear a noise in the
cupboard?"</p>

<p>"Search it by all means if you wish, Badger," I replied with
the utmost sangfroid, "but it only contains my zinc ointment,
ammoniated quinine&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;a little bundle of
odds and ends. As for the noise&mdash;they have the chimney-sweep
in next door."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think of doubting your word, sir," said the
Inspector. Then very coolly he locked the cupboard door without
opening it and slipped the key into his pocket. "A mere
formality, but just as well to be on the safe side," he
observed.</p>

<p>When I returned to the room&mdash;I accompanied Badger to the
outer door myself&mdash;I stood for a moment considering the new
complication.</p>

<p>"Deuced awkward!" I muttered, walking towards the book-
case.</p>

<p>"That will be all right, sir," interposed the soft voice of
Perkins behind me. "The key of my wardrobe fits all the locks in
your sitting-room&mdash;except that of the tantalus, I should
say," and he held out the indicated object for me to take. Under
what circumstances my exemplary man had made the discovery I did
not stop to investigate, but I have no doubt that he had
conscientiously listened to every word of one if not of both
conversations that morning.</p>

<p>I did not lose a moment in unlocking the door of the book-case
and throwing it widely open to release my fair visitor.</p>

<p>But the many-clawed hand of improbability had by no means
relaxed its grip on my shoulder.</p>

<p>The cupboard was empty!</p>

<p>In speechless bewilderment my gaze went round the room from
one familiar object to another in a vain attempt to solve the
mystery. There was only one possible place of concealment there.
I snatched away the coverlet that hid the stark outline on the
dissecting table.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise to see before me the corpse of the elderly
Italian anarchist who had offered me a throat pastille on the
grand stand at Hurlingham a month ago!</p> <br>

<h3>2. IN THE THICK OF IT</h3>

<p class="first">In spite of the passionate insistence with which
Sybil (as I had now grown to call her) had reiterated that I
should think of her no more, there were very few hours of the day
or night that she was absent from my thoughts.</p>

<p>The all-too-brief moment that I had held her in my arms when I
rescued her from the burning dope den in Montmorency Square had
settled my fate for ever. The emotion that swept over me when I
found that we had been decoyed together into the abandoned radium
mine in Cornwall had, if anything, deepened the conviction; and
when I discovered that it was she and no other who, at such
tremendous risk to herself, had sent me the anonymous warning
that saved me from being drugged and tattooed beyond recognition
in the Bond Street beauty specialist's salon, I admitted that
something stronger than myself was shaping our destinies.</p>

<p>The baffling enigma of Sybil's identity would alone have been
sufficient to keep her continually in my mind, even if I had been
disposed to forget. One morning, after I had vainly sought for a
week, I discovered her. She was in charge of a novelty counter in
the bargain basement of Harridge's stores, and so perfectly in
harmony with her surroundings that it seemed impossible to
suspect her of playing a part. Yet the same evening I caught her
demure look of recognition across the table of a Cabinet Minister
at a dinner given in honour of a popular Ambassador. And had not
Slavonski, on the memorable occasion of the Incog. Club raid,
referred to her as "our trusty associate Mademoiselle Zero?" but,
on the other hand, Inspector Badger had placed himself
unreservedly under her guidance when she steered the river-police
motor-launch in pursuit of the desperate "Hi-Hi!" gang. It was
all very puzzling to me, plain John Humdrum, M.D., and when I now
look back over that period I see that Sybil's friendship kept me
very busy indeed.</p>

<p>Possibly something of the sort flashed across my mind one
morning when I found on my breakfast table a note addressed in
Sybil's characteristic hand. It was postmarked "Express Aerial
Service. Tokio to Aberdeen," and franked "Urgent and Frantic" in
violet ink. Stamps of the highest possible value were affixed
wherever there was an inch of space in the dear girl's usual
lavish manner. The enclosure, like all her business messages, was
brief but decided.</p>

<p>"A great danger threatens," it ran. "Meet me at twelve to-
night in the Mummy Room, British Museum.&mdash;Sybil."</p>

<p>Unfortunately it was not dated.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, in a rather doubtful frame of mind that I
presented myself, shortly before midnight, at the formidable
closed gates in Great Russell Street. A printed notice, read
uncertainly by an adjacent street lamp, informed me that the
galleries closed at six.</p>

<p>As I stood there in indecision an official emerged stealthily
from the shadow of an angle in the wall, where he had evidently
been awaiting me.</p>

<p>"That's all right, sir," was his welcome assurance, after he
had flashed the light of an electric torch several times all over
me. "The young lady has arranged everything."</p>

<p>Without further explanation he led the way across the broad
moonlit forecourt and then through several lofty galleries.
Pausing before a massive door he unlocked it, pushed me inside,
and I heard the fastening close to again with a soft metallic
click.</p>

<p>Never before had the mysterious gloom of that ghostly
rendezvous of the long-forgotten dead seemed so shadow-laden.</p>

<p>Sybil&mdash;it was she&mdash;came towards me with a glad
cry.</p>

<p>"You are here!" she exclaimed. "How splendid; but I never for
a moment doubted it."</p>

<p>"But why <i>here?</i>" I ventured to inquire, in my obtuse
blundering way. "Would not Moggridge's or the Azalea Court of the
Frangipane have been more up-to-date?"</p>

<p>She gave me a reproachful glance.</p>

<p>"Surely by this time you know that I am the most hunted woman
in Europe, my good man," she answered with a touch of
aristocratic insouciance. "My footsteps are being dogged by
anarchists, vendettaists, Bolsheviks, Czecho-Slovaks, Black
Hands, Hidden Hands, Scotland Yard, the Northcliffe Press and
several of the more ambitious special constables. This is
literally the one spot in London where we are safe from
observation."</p>

<p>"How wonderful you are!" was wrung from me. "But will you not
tell me what it all means?"</p>

<p>In her usual cryptic fashion Sybil answered one question by
another.</p>

<p>"Will you do something for me?"</p>

<p>"Can you doubt it?" I asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I don't," she replied. "But all so far is insignificant
compared with this. It will demand the reticence of a Government
official combined with the resourcefulness of a District
Messenger boy. This packet must be delivered to-night to the
Admiral of the Fleet, stationed at Plyhampton. The fate of the
navy, the army and the air service are all bound up in its safe
arrival."</p>

<p>"I am ready," I said simply.</p>

<p>"A yellow motor-car, with one headlight green and the other
red, will be waiting for you at the corner of Tottenham Court
Road and Oxford Street," she proceeded rapidly. "You will
recognise it by the driver wearing a crimson opera hat&mdash;that
being the secret badge of the male members of our Society. Get in
and the rest is easy."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke a sudden look of terror swept across her
features.</p>

<p>I followed her agonised glance to the nearest mummy case. It
was, the label stated, that of an Egyptian priest of Mut, named
Amen-Phat, but the pair of steely eyes that I encountered looking
out of the painted mask were those of the Hindoo waiter who had
upset the discarded toothpicks into the poisoned dish of caviare
at the Grand Duke's reception.</p>

<p>I turned to convey my suspicions to Sybil, but to my surprise
she had disappeared, and when I looked again the gilt face of
Amen-Phat had resumed its accustomed placid stare.</p>

<p>One thing was clear. In my hand I held the fateful packet
directed to the Admiral of the Fleet, and my duty was to find the
driver of the yellow car and to make a dash for the coast at all
hazard.</p>

<p>As I strode towards the door I recalled the ominous sound of
re-locking that had followed my entrance. Was I in a trap?</p>

<p>Whatever had taken place, however, the door was no longer
locked. It yielded to the pressure of my hand, but only for a few
inches. Something was holding it from the other side. I exerted
my strength and in another moment I had made a sufficient opening
to allow my passage. The nature of the obstruction was then
revealed. At my feet lay the body of a man. A ray of green light
fell upon his features, rendering them ghastly and distorted, but
it needed no second glance to assure me that the corpse was that
of the mysterious Ethiopian "minstrel" who had so inexplicably
greeted me as "Uncle Sam" in the Empire promenade on boat-race
night.</p> <br>

<h3>3. THE BEGINNING OF THE END</h3>

<p class="first">Little more remains to be told.</p>

<p>I changed cars seventeen times between London and the coast.
The loss of time was considerable, but it whiled away the
monotony of the journey, and as a precaution, together with the
badness of the road, it was effectual in throwing our pursuers
off the track. Their overturned car was found the next morning in
a lime quarry below the road near Dorsham. Beneath it was the
body of the Greek curio-dealer with the Scotch accent who had
sold me the cinque-cento dagger with the phial of cholera
microbes concealed in the handle. By his side lay the form of the
old-looking young gallery first-nighter. Even to this day my
frontal bone carries the scar of his well-aimed opera-glasses, on
that occasion when, in the stalls of the Hilaric during the Royal
performance, nothing but Sybil's presence of mind in flinging
open her umbrella had saved me from a fatal blow. Both were
crushed almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Dawn was within an hour of breaking when my seventeenth
car&mdash;a taxi-cab of obsolete pattern&mdash;broke down in the
quaint old High Street of Plyhampton. Leaving it to its fate I
went on alone to make inquiries, and soon learned, to my delight,
that the super-dreadnought <i>Stalactite</i>, the flag-ship of
the Admiral, was lying at that moment moored to the end of the
pier. Truly fate, which had played us many sorry tricks in the
past, was on our side that night.</p>

<p>Despite the earliness of the hour, the Admiral, Sir Sloeombe
Colqumondeley, received me at once in his state-room, a
magnificent apartment upholstered in green and gold. As his eyes
rested on the superscription of the packet I handed him he could
not repress a slight start, but before he had finished the
reading of the message his face had grown strangely tense. For a
few minutes he paced the salon in deep thought, then turning to
an instrument he transmitted a series of commands in quick
succession. I have since learned, though I little suspected it at
the time, that the tenor of these orders was for every ship of
the fleet to clear for action.</p>

<p>Shaking off his preoccupation Sir Sloeombe turned to me with
an engaging smile.</p>

<p>"So you are my daughter Sybil's young man, Dr. Humdrum?" he
exclaimed, with bluff sailor-like heartiness. "Well, well; we
must see what we can arrange after this business is over. How
would Surgeon-Major of the Fleet suit you; eh, what?"</p>

<p>A few minutes later I was leaving the pier, more bewildered by
the turn events had taken than I would care to admit, when a
tall, dignified officer, with grey mutton-chop side-whiskers,
approached me.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but did you enter Plyhampton in a taxi-cab
numbered XYZ 999?" he inquired courteously.</p>

<p>"I did," I replied, referring to the details which I had taken
the precaution to jot down on my cuff.</p>

<p>"Then it is my duty, as Warden of the Port, to put you in
irons," and he beckoned to a master of marines.</p>

<p>"On what charge?" I demanded with some hauteur.</p>

<p>"The driver of the taxi has been found stabbed to death with
his own speed lever," he explained gravely.</p>

<p>"Inside the vehicle was the dead body of the notorious
international spy known to the secret police as 'Mr. A.' He was
disguised as an elderly Chinese seaman, and was wearing, beneath
his tunic, a forged Order of the Crimson Hat of Siam."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Well, frankly, it doesn't sound it," he admitted with
unofficial candour; "but that isn't my affair."</p>

<p>"I am Dr. Humdrum," I said, producing my stethoscope, "and I
live at 305A Hammersmith Road, Kensington. Surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is quite satisfactory," he replied, throwing the
handcuffs into a lee scupper that stood open. "Accept my apology.
Hold an inquest on the bodies as soon as you conveniently can and
you have my assurance that you will hear nothing further of this
unpleasant business."</p>

<hr>

<p>We are seated in the Piazzo d'Esperanto at Mentone. Sybil's
head is nestling on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Had we better not explain to them now, darling, exactly what
it was all about?" I venture to suggest.</p>

<p>"No, dearest; I don't think we better had," replies Sybil,
watching the play of the deep blue against the distant haze.</p>

<p><i>Maidencombe, 1912.</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII. FATE AND A FAMILY
COUNCIL</h2>

<p class="first">"WHERE for?" asked the guard.</p>

<p>"Nymph Amelia," I replied.</p>

<p>"Change at Great Wivelton," he commented. The door was banged,
the whistle sounded, and the important-looking train drew slowly
along the platform.</p>

<p>All that I knew about Nymph Amelia could have been written on
the back of a postage stamp. Five years previously I was living
at Woollambo just clearing expenses. I should perhaps explain
that Woollambo is a rather out-of-the-way spot in the Mount
Valkyria district of Western Australia. I was prospecting one day
when a scrap of paper, blown from heaven knows where, came
skimming along the ground. I secured it and found that it was a
page from an English railway guide; all that the sun and rain had
left on it were the words, "Nymph Amelia (347). See trains to
Great Wivelton and thence twice daily."</p>

<p>Your gold-seeker is necessarily something of a gambler, and
therefore, I take it, more or less a creature of superstition.
Probably I did not expect anything, but I released the paper
again, pegged the exact direction it took, and then made 347
paces down the line. That incident marked the discovery of the
celebrated Golden Nymph mine.</p>

<p>You will understand now why I was making a pilgrimage, as it
were, to Nymph Aurelia. I was curious and not ungrateful. When I
had seen the place I would present it with a free library, a
breakwater, a clock-tower, a motor fire-engine, or anything of
that kind that constituted its most pressing want, provided that
the thing could be done anonymously and without any fuss.</p>

<p>At least that had been my intention when I took a ticket at
Waterloo. But as the train began to find its way round the
undulating Surrey commons, to cross deep shady lanes, and to
explore pine woods that had seemed in the distance to be designed
for the Noah's Ark of some giant's nursery, it suddenly came upon
me that here was the England which I had come nine thousand miles
to see. London, where I had been waited on by a Swiss, valeted by
a Frenchman, served at the bank by a German, and sung to on the
patriotic subject of Motherland by an Italian, had not, to be
frank, struck me as being quite homelike. Nymph Aurelia, for all
I knew, might be equally disappointing; but I felt strangely
drawn to the quiet sunlit country through which I was being
carried.</p>

<p>According to the time-table the first stop was yet fifty miles
away, but the charm and friendliness of the woodland grew
irresistible. A notice in the carriage informed me, as I hastily
assumed, that I could stop the train in return for the payment of
a fine of five pounds. I understood that it was a business offer,
but this I have since learned was not so. However, that is by the
way. I pulled the cord, took down my light portmanteau from the
rack, got five sovereigns in readiness and waited.</p>

<p>Had the train stopped where I wished and where I think it
ought to have done, I should have stepped directly from the line
into the depths of a fern-carpeted dell. As a matter of fact,
however, it drew up along the more commonplace platform of a
country station. An official of some kind came forward as I
alighted. As I wished him a cheerful good-afternoon and dropped
the five coins into his hesitating palm I could not fail to
observe that the proceeding struck him as exceptional in some
way. But he remained speechless, and with a brisk step I passed
over the bridge that spanned the line.</p>

<p>A large private motor-car was waiting in the otherwise
deserted station-yard, the driver in his place, and, as a casual
glance showed me, someone seated inside. I was passing, giving it
no further attention, when my own name, called out by the
occupant of the car, pulled me up.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Staples, here we are," was the greeting. "How the
deuce did you come down?"</p>

<p>Now, as I have indicated, this was my name&mdash;Frank
Staples. But the extraordinary thing was that I did not know a
soul in England, while the man in the motor-car seemed to have
been positively expecting me.</p>

<p>I approached the door to investigate when I became aware of
the presence of a second occupant.</p>

<p>For years I had had in my mind a fairly well-defined portrait
of a woman's face. The features were small and regular, the poise
of the head imperious, the expression wayward and piquant, and
the whole set with a dark and brilliant beauty. I scarcely
expected ever to see in the flesh this image that had
unconsciously formed itself; nor did I until I stood at the door
of the motor-car confronted by a girl whose vivid face was
sufficiently like my ideal to startle me into an astonished
silence.</p>

<p>"Your train isn't due for ten minutes yet," continued the man.
"How did the express come to stop?"</p>

<p>"I stopped it," I replied mechanically, without taking my eyes
off the extraordinarily vivacious face before me. "I wanted to
get out here."</p>

<p>"The deuce you did!" he exclaimed, forcing himself on me
through my preoccupation by the vigour of his personality. "Do
you mean to say you pulled the cord?"</p>

<p>It was scarcely necessary to reply. The platform at the other
side of the station was beginning to hum with official activity.
A porter appeared on the bridge running and gesticulating as he
ran. To me the excitement I had raised seemed ridiculously out of
proportion, but the man in the car took in the situation with a
single glance.</p>

<p>"Jump in, you scamp," he commanded. "I'm not going to pay for
another of your pranks."</p>

<p>"If Frank is going to ride," exclaimed the lady with sudden
decision, "I am going to walk."</p>

<p>"Then why the Harry did you come to meet him?" demanded my new
old friend with considerable warmth.</p>

<p>"It was necessary for me to see him before I could make up my
mind," she replied with dignity. "Now I have seen him."</p>

<p>This did not put me on any better terms with the
situation.</p>

<p>"You had better let me explain," I began.</p>

<p>"Hilda, don't be an idiot. Frank, don't be an ass. John,
home." All these injunctions operating simultaneously, I found
myself sitting down violently opposite the lady as the car leapt
forward.</p>

<p>So far I had been an entirely innocent impostor, if an
impostor at all. A man can have no better excuse for his
presence, I take it, than to be greeted familiarly by name and
pressed into the company. I was Frank Staples, securely conscious
of my identity, and the mistake, whatever it was, rested with
them; but at this point, influenced, need I confess? by the
scornful beauty's presence, and by my increasing desire to make
her further acquaintance, I entered upon a course of active
dissimulation.</p>

<p>We were scarcely clear of the yard when a thought seemed to
strike my friend with sharp surprise.</p>

<p>"Where is Boosey, by the way?" he said, leaning across to
me.</p>

<p>I accepted the inauspicious omen of the gentleman's name as my
only clue.</p>

<p>"Probably drunk by this time," I replied with an indifferent
shrug.</p>

<p>He stared hard at me for a moment and then nodded once or
twice, almost sympathetically it seemed.</p>

<p>"You are prepared to go on without him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Up to a certain point," I replied guardedly.</p>

<p>"Then I know your line as well as you do yourself," he
announced triumphantly.</p>

<p>"That's extremely likely," I admitted, and we relapsed into
silence again.</p>

<p>At the distance of about two miles from the station the car
turned off from the road, passing through a pair of fine old
wrought-iron gates into private grounds of some pretensions.
Another minute brought us to the house, a substantial white
mansion, to my eyes about a couple of centuries old. Here
everything was in readiness for the occasion, whatever it might
be, and without any explanation or introduction we all crossed
the hall and entered a spacious room which proved to be the
library.</p>

<p>I had recognised the unlikelihood of being able to keep up the
deception very long, but the moment I passed inside the room I
saw exposure lurking ahead in every word. The extent of my
ambition was to effect a dignified capitulation; to be allowed to
pass out&mdash;or, better still, to stay in&mdash;with the
honours of war. Seated about the room were nearly a score of
people, and from their manner and attitude I at once understood
that they were assembled for some specific purpose and had been
awaiting our arrival. For the most part they were men of mature
age, but among them were two or three ladies and one quite
venerable couple. I passed round the room, taking my cue from the
greetings I received. With most I shook hands; here and there a
bow sufficed. The aged dame startled me by kissing me
affectionately upon the cheek, but I gathered that on the whole I
was not popular.</p>

<p>"Five years in America seems scarcely to have changed you,
young man," remarked a smug-looking individual with a
significance that at once put him among the unfriendlies.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," I replied cheerfully; and as I had
evidently been in need of change my callousness was
established.</p>

<p>These courtesies took up very little time. A general movement
on the part of the men was made towards the table. Under
someone's indication I took one end, while a legal-looking
gentleman fronted by a deed-box and writing material occupied the
other. The ladies and the grandparental couple remained outside
the conclave.</p>

<p>I thought that matters had gone as far as I could decently let
them.</p>

<p>"Before you begin," I said, "I have to make a personal
explanation. My presence here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A moment, Mr. Staples," interposed the leader of the hostile
section. "Is he entitled"&mdash;turning to the legal
headpiece&mdash;"is he entitled to make a personal statement that
may possibly prejudice the opinions&mdash;or the views&mdash;of
others?"</p>

<p>"It is a debatable point," replied the authority, stroking his
chin thoughtfully. "I think that on the whole, Mr. Staples, we
had perhaps better stick to the exact letter of the
conditions."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," I said. "Only remember that I made the
offer."</p>

<p>"If Frank has anything in the nature of a claim regarding his
immediate position to advance," put in a friendly, "I think that
in view of his isolated situation it ought to be considered."</p>

<p>That gave me a wild idea. The beautiful creature for whose
sake I was more or less making a conspicuous ass of myself and
courting much obloquy had selected a chair exactly behind me, to
my continued discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," I declared recklessly. "I claim to have Hilda
sitting next to me during the proceedings." She would be furious,
of course, but she was that already, and I had a lively
anticipation that she would be even more so shortly.</p>

<p>Very much to my surprise, no one seemed to regard this
outrageous demand as anything exceptional. There was some
laughter, and even a little applause from the friendlies. Another
chair was brought up and the disdainful young lady was persuaded
to occupy a place by my side. She said nothing, but her
expressive eyes left me in no doubt as to the nature of her
feelings.</p>

<p>The lawyer-man rose to address us and we seemed to be getting
to the root of the mystery at last. "Today being the 20th of
August, 1910," he began, "we are met here according to
arrangement to fulfil the conditions of the rather remarkable
agreement entered into by the late Henry Montgomery Staples and
the late Frederick Basset. As that agreement with its many
contingent clauses is a lengthy and elaborate document, and as
you are all perfectly well acquainted with its essential
features, I propose to take it as read, merely remarking that, in
spite of the doubt thrown upon its validity from interested
quarters"&mdash;here most of the unfriendlies wagged their heads
weightily&mdash;"we have the highest authority for believing it
to be a perfectly legal instrument."</p>

<p>"I beg to differ, Mr. Frobisher," rapped out a prominent
unfriendly.</p>

<p>"I shall at once proceed to lodge a caveat," announced another
defiantly.</p>

<p>"I put in a formal protest," declared a third.</p>

<p>"Quite so, gentlemen; I note your objections," continued the
lawyer imperturbably. "Now, Mr. Frank," taking up a paper which
appeared to contain half-a-dozen paragraphs, "are you prepared to
adopt by deed poll the name of Basset?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I replied. "I don't see why on earth I should
adopt the name of Basset. There is nothing particularly
attractive about it. My own is quite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no need for you to disparage my name, Frank,"
exclaimed the girl indignantly. "It is one to which you have been
materially indebted in the past."</p>

<p>That was the worst of my position. On the others also my reply
had a remarkable effect. For some reason every friendly at once
became hostile and every unfriendly adopted a sympathetic
attitude. Numerically I gained, but I preferred the old
allies.</p>

<p>"As Mr. Staples repudiates that condition&mdash;" struck in an
ex-unfriendly.</p>

<p>"We will nevertheless go on," replied the lawyer grimly. "Will
you, Mr. Staples, in the event of your benefiting, continue the
Basset claim to the Thorneywood estate?"</p>

<p>A great deal seemed to hang on that, by the breathless
interest with which my reply was awaited. I had to answer one way
or the other. I took what seemed to be the simplest course.</p>

<p>"No, I won't," I replied. And to cut discussion short I added,
"I decline to state my reasons."</p>

<p>Despair and satisfaction again swept over the contending
forces, but which lot I had pleased and which offended I cannot
say. A ferocious little man, whispering across the table to me in
tones of suppressed passion, took all my attention.</p>

<p>"You decline to give you reasons, Frank Staples, but I can see
through them well enough," he declared. "You think you will be
able to make it right with the Copping-hams, buy out the Priory
mortgagee, and at the same time conciliate Aunt Harriet. Let me
tell you, sir, you are playing a dangerous game!"</p>

<p>"I quite feel that," I admitted.</p>

<p>"For supposing the Brandon boundary decision <i>is</i>
reversed, where will you be then?"</p>

<p>"That's the weak spot," I agreed. "Where, indeed? What would
you advise?</p>

<p>"You can hardly expect <i>me</i> to advise <i>you</i> at this
point," he replied, becoming more amiable, "but mark this: you
will bitterly repent putting any reliance on your Uncle Tapping's
promises. I can see that he is behind you in this, but he is only
using you for his own ends. You will soon find out that he isn't
what you think he is."</p>

<p>"No, no," I replied. "I can't believe that. I am sure old
Uncle Tapping is all right. He is much more likely to find out
soon that I am not what he thinks I am."</p>

<p>Mr. Frobisher's formal voice broke off this agreeable
conversation.</p>

<p>"I now have to put a crucial question to you, Mr. Staples," he
was saying. And then it came: "Do you agree to marry Hilda
Basset?"</p>

<p>I suppose that I might have been prepared for the ridiculous
family agreement leading up to something of this sort, but, as a
matter of fact, I couldn't have been more completely taken by
surprise. In my indignation I clean forgot that I was merely an
involuntary proxy. I was also conscious of going as red as a
lobster and as wild as a scalded cat.</p>

<p>"What the blazes do you mean by asking such a question?" I
demanded hotly. "You don't suppose that I am ass enough to
imagine that Miss Basset would marry <i>me</i>, do you? If you
really want to know, from the first moment I saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>The remarkable effect of my outburst saved me from saying any
more. Hitherto my replies had gained me one party at the expense
of alienating the other. This time I simply succeeded in sheerly
astonishing everyone into speechless, breathless bewilderment. I
don't think I ever witnessed a more curious spectacle than that
of some eighteen dumb, open-mouthed, petrified people. How they
would have come round naturally I don't know, but Hilda broke the
spell. She, with the rest, had been staring point-blank into my
face. What she saw there, or what she missed there, I have yet to
learn, but suddenly she sat back in her chair and went off into
peal after peal of uncontrollable laughter. This was the moment
chosen by a family retainer to open the door, step two paces into
the room, and solemnly announce:</p>

<p>"Mr. Frank Staples; Mr. Boosey."</p>

<p>Hilda&mdash;it is scarcely worth while beginning to call her
Miss Basset now&mdash;has since declared that the resemblance
between the two Frank Stapleses is superficial and illusory.
Nevertheless it was enough to make the eighteen friendlies and
unfriendlies&mdash;who were having a day of shocks&mdash;look
from one to the other of us in amazement, while they opened and
closed their mouths in silent unison.</p>

<p>For the third time that eventful day I offered to make an
explanation, and on this occasion no one objected. They hung on
to my every word indeed.</p>

<p>"This is certainly very remarkable," said the man who had
brought me in the car. "Very remarkable, indeed, but, given one
coincidence, not altogether incredible. The question is: Who are
<i>you</i>? Who <i>are</i> you?"</p>

<p>"I am Frank Armitage Staples, of course," I replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said irritably; "no one is going to doubt that,
with your features. But what Frank Staples? That's the
point."</p>

<p>"So far as I am concerned," I replied modestly, "I have always
been accustomed in Woollambo to regard myself as <i>the</i> Frank
Staples."</p>

<p>I saw a questioning glance pass from face to face among some
who sat at the table.</p>

<p>"Would you inform us as to your father's name?" asked one
politely.</p>

<p>"It was Frank Rupert Staples. He is dead."</p>

<p>"And his father?"</p>

<p>"He possessed the more unusual name of Cedric Oliver."</p>

<p>"Cedric Oliver Staples," slowly and deliberately pronounced
the patriarch from the armchair. "Tried at Guildford in the
spring of 1826 on a charge of forgery. Found guilty and sentenced
to transportation for life. He was my uncle."</p>

<p>"Possibly, sir," I remarked, turning round to face him, "but,
so far as I am aware, he never claimed the kinship, nor referred
to any of his relations. And in Australia it is not considered
etiquette to inquire into the family history of those who come of
the early settler stock."</p>

<p>"Look here, this is all very jolly and convivial," put in the
other Frank restlessly, "but old Boosey says he must get back by
the 5.30, and I'm not keen on staying myself. Frosty sort of
welcome it seems to me offhand. Not even a milk-cart to be had at
the station, and some silly ass had stopped the express, so they
say, and held up our train for ten minutes."</p>

<p>"But you can't run away like that," expostulated the master of
the house. "There is the agreement&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you worry about that, Toppy, old man," said my
namesake in the easiest manner. "I have put in a formal
appearance and Boosey will look into the thing and see if there
is anything coming to me out of the wreck. I'm afraid it will be
rather a back-hander for you, Hilda, but I'm out of the running
for the double now."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;?" exclaimed all the friendlies,
who had begun to pick up hope again.</p>

<p>"Yes, married already," admitted the gentleman complacently.
"Met the lady in Brooklyn three months ago. She is what you might
call flossy&mdash;distinctly flossy. She can put her heels
against a chalked line on the stage, and without moving bend back
till she picks up a nickel with her teeth. You shouldn't always
have been so jolly stiff, Hilda, you know."</p>

<p>"I am delighted that you have found a lady who seems to be
quite the reverse," replied Hilda pleasantly.</p>

<p>Thus had fate, in the shape of Nymph Amelia again, been
pulling benevolently at the reins of my destiny.</p>

<p>"For a practical young man, brought up in a new country, you
seem to be strangely fanciful," remarked Hilda a week later, when
I told her about these things.</p>

<p>"It is true," I admitted. "I am always having visions, seeing
fairies, hearing voices, and touching posts. From the first
moment I saw you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The instant I said the words we both remembered the occasion
when they were last spoken. Hilda turned away with rising colour.
I was struck by a sudden fear that I had spoiled the thing.</p>

<p>"I knew that we should be friends," I concluded lamely.</p>

<p>I caught a glimpse of her face, and across it there swept a
look that reminded me then of the sun leaving a landscape.</p>

<p>"What I just said is utterly false, Hilda, only I was so
horribly afraid," I said facing her. "I have never even thought
of you in friendship. From the first moment I saw you I knew
that, whoever you were, you were the woman who had been growing
in my heart ever since my world began."</p>

<p>The sunshine returned radiantly. That is how we come to be
spending our honeymoon at Nymph Aurelia.</p>

walked two miles in twenty-three minutes along an abnormally
dusty road in order to catch a non-existent train on a toy-gauge
railway I should certainly have seen the impropriety of putting
such a question to the station-master. But the station-master at
Lower Roffey was not in the least disposed to be offended. I do
not think I ever met a railwayman within three grades of his rank
who was less inclined to stand on his dignity. He issued and
collected tickets, looked after the passengers' luggage, when
they had any&mdash;and it was by no means the exception, I
gathered, for there to be no passengers even&mdash;worked the
home signals, cleaned and trimmed the oil lamps, saw to the
flower-beds, and in addition to doing, in fact, all the general
work of the station, delivered the local weekly paper, acted as
agent for an American fountain pen, kept poultry and sold ginger-
beer.</p>

<p>"It's right," he replied sympathetically. "The 4.32 is a
summer train and doesn't run after the end of September: 6.18 is
the next now."</p>

<p>"At all events," I retorted, "the 4.32 is down in the time-
table that I bought at a shop up in the village, less than an
hour ago. It's a pretty nuisance."</p>

<p>The station-master nodded in complete agreement.</p>

<p>"Lukie Marsh ought to have known better," he remarked. "I took
the new time-tables there last week myself. It was Lukie that
served you, of course; not her sister Jane?"</p>

<p>Still smarting under the discomfort of my unnecessary
exertion, I intimated that I was, unhappily, a stranger to the
personalities of both Lukie and her sister Jane.</p>

<p>"That is so, of course," assented the station-master
cheerfully. "Still, you may take it from me that it would be
Lukie. Jane would have had more sense. Not but what Lukie has her
wits about her in general, but ever since she consulted that
horse-doctor that came to Crossgate last autumn she has been
absent-minded at times."</p>

<p>"I suppose consulting a horse-doctor was the first symptom of
it?" I suggested with covert sarcasm.</p>

<p>"No; it wasn't that. He wasn't really a horse-doctor either,
you must understand. That was only what old Doctor Page over at
Crossgate called him.</p>

<p>"'The man has the methods and the knowledge of a common horse-
doctor,' he said in a rage whenever the subject came up; 'and
those who go to see him are asses.'</p>

<p>"Of course that was because he was nettled at the business the
other was doing. However, the word got about and no one used it
oftener than Hankins&mdash;that was the fellow's
name&mdash;himself.</p>

<p>"'I'm not a doctor,' he said every night at the beginning of
his talk; 'I'm Hankins the Medicine Man, known also in every
important town in Great Britain and Ireland as Hankins the Make-
You-Well. In Cross-gate, however, I am called the Horse-Doctor.
Now, my friends, would you rather be made well by a horse-doctor
or kept ill by Doctor Donkey?'</p>

<p>"That was all he said about it; nothing personal, you see, but
it went down wonderfully well among the chaps who stood
round.</p>

<p>"I must say he went to work in what seemed to me a more
reasonable way than Doctor Page did. Page, who was generally ill
with gout or asthma himself, tried to make out to you that you
were pretty well all right when you went to see him and
discouraged you from going on. Hankins claimed to be the only
sound man in Crossgate, and offered to prove scientifically that
everyone else had something wrong and getting worse inside him
and sapping his vitality, even though he might know nothing of
it. Every night he gave a lecture in the market-place opposite
the Goat and people came miles to hear him. He had a platform and
life-sized pictures of your body in colour with the different
inward parts to flap backwards and forwards on hinges, so that he
seemed to take you in on one side of yourself and bring you out
on the other, telling you all about the various diseases,
unbeknown to ordinary professional doctors, that you met with on
the way. Then he went through the symptoms of different fatal
ailments and showed you what you looked like inside when you'd
got them. Before he'd done, pretty nearly everyone felt that they
had most of the things he described and he did a first-rate
business in remedies. Whether it was his medicines&mdash;as he
claimed&mdash;or not I don't know, but he certainly had a
wonderful frame. He'd stand on his platform and bellow like a
bull for five minutes at a time to show what really healthy lungs
were like. I've heard him from this station, three miles away, on
a still evening. I've seen him jump off his platform and leap
over it twelve or fifteen times backwards and forwards without
stopping for breath.</p>

<p>"'There's a heart toughened with Hankins's Vital Elixir,' he'd
say. 'I was a puny thriftless wisp of a boy, and look at me now.
There isn't a man, woman or child over the age of fourteen
standing round who couldn't do the same at this moment if his or
her heart was properly nourished.'"</p>

<p>"If you went up to the platform then, he'd tell you what was
the matter with you for nothing, charging only for the medicine;
but during the day he had a room at Whittle's, the barber, where
it was a shilling for consultations. That was how Lukie Marsh
came to see him."</p>

<p>We hardly seemed to have reached the point of the story yet,
but the station-master gave me the distinct impression of trying
to make me believe that this was all.</p>

<p>"The fact is," he apologised as he met my inquiring eye, "I
have only just remembered that Lukie was dead set against it
getting about. I suppose the only two people who knew all the ins
and outs of it besides Lukie were her sister Jane and myself. I'm
a sort of half-cousin of theirs. Then I send paragraphs of
anything of interest that happens here up to the local paper, and
as a police case came out of this, Lukie was anxious to know what
was going to be printed about it and told me everything."</p>

<p>"Nothing of discredit to the lady, I am sure," I remarked
encouragingly.</p>

<p>"You're right," he agreed warmly. "It was an experience that
many people would boast of, and now that it's a year ago and
Lukie's banns are up, I don't suppose that she'd mind a stranger
knowing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll have a bottle of ginger-beer with me?" I
suggested.</p>

<p>"Thanks, I don't mind if I do," said the station-master. "It's
middling dry talking in this weather." He produced the various
articles from the booking-office, opened the bottles and filled
the glasses with the most businesslike expertness and then
continued the narrative of Miss Marsh's remarkable
experience.</p>

<p>"The thing Lukie was most afraid of was that it might make
trouble with William Hill's people if they heard that she had
been to consult the horse-doctor. The Hills, especially William's
mother, were strict herbalists and regarded all other forms of
medicine as sinful and poisonous. Lukie and William had been more
or less engaged for seventeen years, and, as she said to me, she
could not afford at her age to throw all that time away and begin
again.</p>

<p>"Doubtless it would have been better if she had thought of
that at the beginning and not gone, but she was always one for
gaiety and things had been pretty quiet at Roffey last year. It
was wet for the Flower Show and the black missionary man who was
to lecture on 'Savage Africa' couldn't find the place and never
came. Everyone was talking about this Hankins; so one day Lukie
persuaded Jane to go with her to Cross-gate, picking a time when
the fewest people who might know her were likely to be about.</p>

<p>"Of course she didn't go for mere curiosity. For some time
back she'd had a notion that something that oughtn't to be there
was growing somewhere down her throat. She couldn't see it, and
couldn't feel it, and it didn't exactly hurt, but the idea
worried her whenever she remembered it. As she said, it might be
only fancy, but it was a good opportunity to kill two birds with
one stone.</p>

<p>"Jane stayed outside in the market-place because from what
she'd heard she thought that the sight of Hankins's life-sized
pictures would make her feel queer; and besides they weren't
quite sure but what he would charge double if both of them went
in.</p>

<p>"Hankins listened to what Lukie had to say and then tried most
of his machines on her. Finally he strapped a round looking-glass
on to his forehead, stood her by the window, and shot the
sunlight into her throat.</p>

<p>"'I don't see any growth so far,' he said, when he had done
all that he could with that, 'but as you think that there is
something, there most likely is, because there can't be an effect
without a cause, and it is contrary to nature to think of
anything that doesn't exist. Fortunately I have with me a means
of testing even further.' With that he got out a little electric
light, no bigger than a plum-stone hardly, that was worked by a
pocket battery. 'Now,' he said, 'I am going to press your tongue
down with a spoon-handle, throw the light well into the pharynx,
and then we shall see as far as there is anything to be
seen.'</p>

<p>"Lukie thought half a minute and then made a move towards the
door.</p>

<p>"'I should not think of allowing it,' she said.</p>

<p>"That took back the horse-doctor considerably. 'It won't hurt
you the least bit,' he said.</p>

<p>"'I am not afraid of that. And I daresay that the town ladies
you are accustomed to, do not mind being seen in the way you
speak of, but in the country we are more particular. Good-
afternoon.'</p>

<p>"'Hold hard a minute,' said Hankins, who was well-meaning
enough; 'perhaps I didn't pick my words quite as I might. Haven't
you any discreet lady friend whom you could have here with
you?'</p>

<p>"'There's my sister Jane waiting out in the pig-market. She's
older than me and sees mostly to the shop, but I couldn't say
whether she's discreet or not,' replied Lukie.</p>

<p>"'Jane will do A1,' said Hankins. 'Call her up.'</p>

<p>"They got Jane up and Lukie allowed him to get to work again.
But it seemed as though something was bound to go wrong at every
turn. Just when he had fixed his light in position Lukie screwed
up her face and began to wave her hands frantically. The light
had tickled her nose and she felt that she was going to sneeze
whatever happened. Hankins, not in the least guessing what she
meant, simply stood and stared at her. Then Lukie shut her mouth
with a snap, sneezed, gave a gulp, turned pale, and said, 'What
was that?'</p>

<p>"Hankins pulled up the ends of his wires. 'My Sunday hat!' he
exclaimed, 'the blamed thing has come unhitched. You've swallowed
the bulb, Miss.' So she had.</p>

<p>"How he satisfied them I don't fully know, but it was more
than an hour before they were composed enough to go home.
Whatever he thought, Hankins made out that there was no danger,
and he added, handsomely enough as it seemed certain that Lukie
had bitten through the wire, that he had no intention of charging
for the lamp.</p>

<p>"'It's no use looking on the dark side of things,' said Lukie
when they got back; so she made a hearty meal off tinned salmon,
to which she was very partial, and then, feeling pretty tired
what with one thing and another, went early to bed.</p>

<p>"That night Moses Andrews, a sort of low-down thief from the
lime-quarries over at Shapley, broke into the house, thinking to
make a good haul. The Marshes were supposed to have some money
put away; and the place being old and ramshackle it wasn't
difficult even for Mo to get in, though for that matter he was
really more fitted to be a tramp than a burglar. He went through
the till in the shop and all the drawers in the lower part of the
house without finding much, and then he made his way upstairs.
His idea was to wake one of the sisters quietly, hold a hatchet
over her head, and frighten her into telling him where the money
was hid. As it happened he chanced on Lukie's room.</p>

<p>"When Lukie woke and opened her eyes to see a man in a black
mask standing over her with the wood-chopper she didn't wait to
hear what he had to say. She opened her mouth, and the next
minute there would have been a screech that would have woke all
Roffey if she had got it out. But the instant she opened her
mouth there was no need for Lukie to yell: it was Mo Andrews who
did that, and dropping his sack and tools he lit out in a bee-
line for home, the worst scared burglar that ever picked a lock.
He went through the bedroom window without stopping to think of
opening it, and dropping on to a moderately soft bed of cabbages
he tore down the garden, howling manfully as he went.</p>

<p>"I don't understand much about electricity myself, but it's
tolerably clear now what had happened. Hankins's little bulb had
got wedged up somewhere out of harm's way, and the vinegar and
other things that Lukie had eaten acted as a sort of acid and
started it working at full pressure. Lukie herself got an idea
that the light was accumulating inwardly as long as she was
asleep, and that when she opened her mouth it leapt out like a
gas explosion, but I put that down to a woman's fancy. However it
may be, there is no doubt that coming suddenly in the dark the
sight would have a goodish effect on a mean-spirited sort of
creature like that.</p>

<p>"As for Andrews, he was only beginning his adventures. Half-
way down the garden was a clump of bush fruit trees, gooseberries
and logans and so on. Being troubled with sparrows and finches,
Jane had bought a length of tarred netting early in the season
and stretched it over all the trees to save the fruit. Into the
middle of this net shot Andrews with enough move on him to carry
clean through an ordinary hedge. A man armed with a double-
barrelled duck-gun couldn't have stopped him at that moment, but
the net did. It held good and firm and the more he plunged and
reared the more he wrapped himself up in it. What he did with his
ramping was to pull up a gooseberry bush that was in the net
behind him and to jerk it forward so that it sprang on to his
shoulders and lapped its branches round his neck. Then everything
that he'd ever heard as a boy about the Devil and Hell and the
met spread to catch sinners' came back to him&mdash;and owing to
his parents having been Particular Revivalists and regular at
chapel, it ran mostly on fire and brimstone and claws and such-
like.</p>

<p>"'He's got me!' they heard him wail in a despairing sort of
way, and then he seems to have fainted dead off.</p>

<p>"By this time a good many people were beginning to come round.
Jane hearing an uproar ran into Lukie's room with a light. Lukie
was sitting up in bed and apparently on the point of going off
into hysterics. Jane, whose remedies were simple but practical,
seized her by the arm and thumped her several times soundly on
the back. Lukie coughed twice, put her hand up to her mouth, and
produced Hankins's lamp, none the worse for its travels. That
ended her chief trouble.</p>

<p>"Misgivings about what Mo Andrews might say when he was
brought up began to worry her a little when she thought of it the
next day. Being a sensitive woman, besides the disagreeableness
with William Hill's people she disliked the idea of the low jokes
that would be sure to be made about having electric lights and
such matters. As it happened, she had nothing to fear. It took
three men upwards of half-an-hour with scissors and pocket-knives
to get Mo clear of the net and he came out of it a changed man.
By the time he appeared before the Court he had got religion
solid.</p>

<p>"'Well, Andrews,' said the magistrate, who had seen him there
before. 'What have you to say in answer to the charge?'</p>

<p>"'Nothing,' replied Mo calmly. 'All that business is past and
done with. I stand here a sinner, but on the solid rock at last.
Can you say the same, friend? Is all well with you?'</p>

<p>"'Remanded for the state of the prisoner's mind to be inquired
into,' said the magistrate; and that was the last that Lukie had
to do with it."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. THE WAR HAWKS</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">"THAT is the position," said the War Minister,
folding the sheets of paper from which he had been reading.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a few moments. "The position" related to the
movements of the various fleets, to the strength and disposal of
the available troops and kindred details; the place was an
historic apartment in Downing Street, and the dozen men assembled
were engaged that afternoon in regulating the destiny of the
Empire, and, incidentally, that of the world.</p>

<p>Hallet, the Home Secretary, broke the silence, which had
reached a painful intensity.</p>

<p>"I take the responsibility of proposing that we recognise the
inevitable to-day rather than to-morrow, and signify our
acceptance of the terms of the ultimatum, he said, with slow
deliberation.</p>

<p>"I differ," cried the aged Earl of Trentford sharply. "We
cannot be so desperately placed as Mollineux leads us to believe.
It&mdash;it is so sudden, so unexpected. A great nation cannot be
vanquished and annihilated in a single day. There must be
something we have overlooked. If we are being invaded by air,
where are the dirigibles? We have heard no word of them."</p>

<p>There was a low ruption of laughter, sardonic and half-
heartbroken, from two or three men. The War Minister
dispassionately picked out a sheet in cypher from the litter of
paper before him.</p>

<p>"In response to the War Office inquiry of this morning, the
officer in charge of the section wires from Alder-shot:
'Dirigibles Nos. 3 and 4 temporarily useless as a result of the
malicious damage effected on the night of the nth inst., as
already reported. Nos. 6 and 7 still under, construction; delayed
beyond anticipated date owing to 6-inch counterbalance carrier
shafts having been made and delivered instead of 7-inch as
ordered. No. 5 available&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The vessel popularly known as <i>Quo Vadis the Vth</i>?"
inquired a colleague smoothly.</p>

<p>"I have no knowledge of the name," replied the War Minister,
with unruffled composure. "'No. 5 available, but during the
continuance of S.E. gale registered as fifty-two miles by the
anemometer, and reported by the South Foreland station as
prevalent for the next forty-eight hours, impossible even to meet
enemy's air-fleet from this point. Have been requested to allow
transport of No. 5 by motor-wagons to Maidstone, and after the
passage of enemy's fleet to make ascent by night on the chance of
involving at least one of the enemy in mutual destruction.'"</p>

<p>There were a few cries of "Hear, hear!" from the least
depressed members of the Cabinet. Sir William Mollineux raised a
hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"We all recognise the devotion of such an offer," he said
quietly, "but unless we are prepared with a definite and
continuous plan of resistance, it would be not only useless, but
nationally suicidal."</p>

<p>"And the War Office has no plan to put before us?" demanded
the earl.</p>

<p>"In the exceptional circumstances, none."</p>

<p>"Then I have," retorted Trentford, with a touch of senile
stubbornness. "I propose that the seat of government be
transferred to Oxford; that Gurney shall be instructed to join
fleets with Colenso and force the passage of the Elbe, while
France fulfils her obligations by demonstrating along the
frontier, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir William Mollineux glanced down the table and nodded to a
colleague.</p>

<p>"My lord," interposed the man who had been singled out, "we
have received the most explicit warning that while this
incredible fleet of Krupp-Parsevals is in being, France will be
unable to make any move."</p>

<p>Trentford stared blankly at the speaker. "In the face of the
most definite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mastery of the air overrides all treaties," commented
another.</p>

<p>"It is no use, Trentford," said the Premier, gathering the
decision of the Council at a glance. "All the navies and all the
armies in the world are not worth one Krupplin in the light of
our present information. Let us dismiss armies and navies from
our calculations. There are only two classes of Powers to-day:
Germany, and the rest of the world."</p>

<p>"And if we accept the terms forced on us, and abandon all hope
of building a rival air-fleet, there can never be anything
else."</p>

<p>"Until a new force comes into being," replied the Premier,
with a sudden gleam of kindling enthusiasm "What form it will
take we cannot guess, and perhaps we shall never know; but in the
future I can confidently foresee some undreamt-of bending of the
forces of nature to the use of man's ingenuity by which the
Krupplins of that time will be as impotent as the
<i>Dreadnoughts</i> of to-day, and the nation that relies on
their pre-eminence to usurp the sovereignty of the world will be
trapped and humbled in its false security as we are trapped in
ours."</p>

<p>"I hope that you are right," said one; "and I hope that our
authorities in that day will have sufficient humour to mask their
operations under a frantic construction of Krupplins."</p>

<p>Some smiled sadly, and all caught the bitter jest, remembering
how, a few years previously, Germany had masked her strength,
gained all the time she wanted, and duped the suspicion and the
activity of England by a kindred subterfuge.</p>

<p>"We may be powerless to repel the&mdash;the so-called
Krupplins if what we hear of their capabilities is correct (an
assumption which I venture to doubt very strongly, or surely some
indication of their menace would have reached us before this),
but what beyond that?" demanded the earl, returning to the point
with dull tenacity. "They could not drop explosives from
balloons, navigable or otherwise&mdash;they would not dare. There
is still such a thing as International Law, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"My lord, my lord," exclaimed Hallet, bringing his hand down
upon the table with such a passion of pent-up feeling that the
jewel sprang from the ring he wore and rolled unheeded to the
floor, "do not deceive yourself. There is International
Law&mdash;but there are no nations to enforce it."</p>

<p>"Besides," suggested another, "what is there to prevent them
from using short-range howitzers of some new pattern? They could
open the breeches of their guns and simply roll the shells out of
the muzzles, I suppose. No, no, earl, there is nothing in that, I
am afraid.</p>

<p>"You are all against me?" said Trent ford, looking round
doggedly.</p>

<p>"We dare not do otherwise, my old friend," said his chief
sadly. "The lives of seven million people are in our hands here
in London alone, and if we resort to arms the City will be a
smoking ruin at the end of forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>Trentford rose to his feet with the arresting dignity of age
and isolation.</p>

<p>"I am an old man," he began deliberately, "and whatever course
you adopt will cease to affect me before very long. I have seen
my country involved in three great struggles and in minor wars
innumerable. In every case there were not wanting those who
prophesied disasters and defeat; in every case there were
reverses and serious losses; and in every case there was an
ultimate victory which left England stronger than before. It has
remained for a Cabinet of which I am a member to receive invasion
with bended knee and to ransom their capital without striking a
single blow. I am too old to learn the new way, gentlemen. I will
go into my own country, where I was formerly honorary colonel of
yeomanry, and if I can find a score of men who would rather be
shot as Germany's foes than live as Germany's vassals, by God, I
will lead them!"</p>

<p>Right on his words came a dramatic interruption. The sound of
some confusion on the other side of the door had marked the last
sentence of the tirade. One or two Ministers had looked
inquiringly at the Premier; his hand was already on the bell,
when the sharp report of a pistol strung them all to an acuter
tension. In the moment of startled indecision the door was
opened, a man stepped quickly into the room, closed the door
again and stood with his back against it, while he surveyed the
assembly with keen alertness, still holding the smoking revolver
in his hand.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this outrage?" demanded the Premier,
between wrath and apprehension.</p>

<p>"The meaning of the outrage, sir, is that you apparently gave
your door-keeper instructions to admit no one on any pretext,
while my inflexible determination was to go to any length in
order to reach you."</p>

<p>"You have shot Taylor!"</p>

<p>"What of that?" demanded the intruder coolly. "Do you know
what is happening beyond your cordon of police? There are ten
thousand men in Whitehall, and the most popular suggestion is
that they should hang the Secretary of State for War and your
illustrious self on the nearest lamp-post. In the City and
beyond, the authorities are unable to make the least show of
keeping order, and looting and violence are in progress on every
side. There is a panic-swept exodus from London by all the high-
roads to the north and west, and since five o'clock this morning
more than two hundred women and children have been trampled to
death. What does a door-keeper in addition matter?"</p>

<p>"A madman!" murmured someone warningly to those about him.</p>

<p>"You are a murderer!" cried another.</p>

<p>"No, no," protested the stranger, almost good-humouredly; "I
have only disabled your man with a bullet in the shoulder, after
all. But, believe me, you will be face to face with civil war in
less than seven days, and even the life of a zealous servant is a
small matter in averting that calamity."</p>

<p>"Mad&mdash;quite mad!" repeated the former speaker cautiously.
"Better humour him until someone comes."</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what do you want?" demanded the Premier, who
saw more indication of method than of madness.</p>

<p>"My name," replied the unceremonious being, "is Brampton Reed.
Possibly," he said, turning sharply to the Minister for War, "the
name has a distantly familiar ring, Sir William?"</p>

<p>"Ah," replied Mollineux, enlightened, "the man with a
era&mdash;an idea for individual flying."</p>

<p>"No," corrected Reed in sharp raillery, "the man who
<i>had</i> a craze for individual flying three years ago; the man
who has something very like the perfection of individual flying
to-day. No obligation to your department, Sir William. You saw
nothing in it."</p>

<p>"We were advised that the project of self-propelled flight was
chimerical. The tendency was all towards aeroplanes and
dirigibles. You were out of the movement."</p>

<p>"We shall be in it to-night if we come to terms," said Reed,
with grim humour. "What would you give to be able to plant a
patriotic Englishman, carrying five pounds of thorite, on each of
the Krupplins&mdash;to control a flight of human aerial
torpedoes, eh, Sir William?"</p>

<p>"Can you do this, Mr. Reed?" demanded the Premier, with a
tortured incredulity. Taylor was forgotten. All looked towards
the man who suggested the bare possibility of the miracle of
salvation.</p>

<p>"I will be frank with you," replied Reed, coming up to the
table. "I can&mdash;but at the same time I should have preferred
this to have come in six months' time."</p>

<p>"You can make a flight even in this weather?"</p>

<p>"The wind is nothing&mdash;nothing. On the contrary, it helps
a practised wingman. But there are other details&mdash;technical
details. We have had to do everything in the face of terrible
discouragement. We wanted men, reliable, devoted men, such as you
could have put in our way. We wanted facilities of a dozen kinds.
Most of all, we wanted time. Practice, unending practice, is the
secret of alatics. We even wanted money; money, good lord! and
you are on the point of paying an indemnity of a hundred millions
to save London!"</p>

<p>"We are taking a terrible risk if we permit this forlorn hope,
Mr. Reed," said Mollineux.</p>

<p>"So are we, Sir William," replied Reed caustically. "Strictly
in a personal way you cannot take a greater one than we shall. As
regards permitting the attempt, allow me to point out to you that
you cannot prevent it. At the same time I want official
recognition. I want something in return, and I want information.
Well, there are my terms," and he threw a few sheets of paper on
to the table. "How many Krupps really are there, by the way? The
newspapers are all&mdash;well, as usual."</p>

<p>"Five," replied some one. "They have opened wireless
communication with us from the neighbourhood of the
Goodwins."</p>

<p>"Five! and we have only seven competent men, including
myself," exclaimed Reed. "So be it; we can take no risks. You
know what that means, Mr. Muir?"</p>

<p>"Not absolutely, though I draw a natural inference," replied
the Premier, looking up from the manuscript which Reed had
brought. "What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Every man will have to throw his missile from a distance of
not more than thirty feet. Five pounds of thorite will grind up
everything within a radius of fifty yards. You deduce the element
of risk, Mr. Muir?</p>

<p>"In other words, every man will go to certain death?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. Every man who fails to blow himself into his
constituent elements will have bungled. Well, we all had one eye
on that contingency when we trained. If only we'd had more time
it might have been avoided. Time: practice, practice, practice.
Please remember that for the new aerial department, Mr.
Muir."</p>

<p>"I see that you stipulate for that, Mr. Reed," said the
Minister of War, glancing down the paper. "Two power standard of
air-fleet,' 'aerial stations,' 'corps of wingmen,' and so forth.
I think after this experience you can safely leave that to any
Government in power."</p>

<p>"I could safely accept the personal word of any member of the
Cabinet in a simple straightforward matter of millions," replied
Reed bluntly. "But the collective assurance of a Government on a
matter of national safety and aerial supremacy&mdash;oh no, Sir
William!"</p>

<p>"We shall not differ on that point, Mr. Reed," said the
Premier, taking up a pen to sign the document. "The money will be
found."</p>

<p>"Money!" exclaimed Reed broadly. "I don't think that that
detail will trouble you, Mr. Muir. No more warships after to-day,
you know&mdash;nothing more expensive than a submarine."</p>

<p>"I see that you also require certain provision made in the
case of your associates."</p>

<p>"Yes; some of them have people, and so on," said Reed
carelessly.</p>

<p>"But," continued the Premier, "I fail to see any reference to
yourself."</p>

<p>"I, on the other hand, have none."</p>

<p>"But surely, out of everything that a gratefully indebted
country can offer in return for so colossal a service, there
might be something!</p>

<p>"That is my whim, Mr. Muir&mdash;that there should be
nothing."</p>

<p>For the second time during that momentous Council the
proceedings were interrupted from without. There was a knock, and
close upon it a police-inspector entered.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but there has been a disturbance, and
one of your servants has been shot," he explained. "I thought
that you might require my attendance."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Inspector Holstan. I shall be glad if you will see
that Taylor has the best attention and everything that he can
possibly require," replied the Premier.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." He still lingered, however, and his eye
rested on Brampton Reed suspiciously. "I under-stand," he
ventured, "that this gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is all we require," said the Premier, with suave
decision. "Mr. Reed is&mdash;one of ourselves."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">"Tilbury; Gravesend," indicated one of the alert
looking young men standing on the upper platform of <i>Die
Wasser-jungfer</i>. "Chatham and Rochester there together.
Woolwich? No, you cannot identify it. It is among the glow over
there&mdash;London."</p>

<p>"Really London at last," soliloquised another.
<i>"Ach!"</i></p>

<p>"You may well say 'at last,' Steinetz," struck in an aviator-
engineer. "Ten years ago I myself dated this invasion for
1906."</p>

<p>"Fortunately for you that you were wrong," said the first
speaker, "or you would not have been in it. Late or not, here we
are&mdash;where the great Napoleon never got."</p>

<p>"Ah, he was too much for himself and for conquest, that
Corsican. If he had been inspired by humanity and a love of
fatherland, he would have gone further."</p>

<p>The five great Krupp-Parsevals were lying "anchored" in what
was then known, for the purposes of aerial navigation, as the
fourth atmospheric zone, above the fields and villages of Kent.
The previous day, immediately upon Germany's official
notification to the British Government that Lord Shipley's action
with regard to the Ankori affair was regarded as a hostile move,
the world for the first time learned of the secret works in
Westphalia, and of the existence of an unsuspected fleet of air-
ships. At the same time details were freely published, from which
it became obvious, so far advanced over all other types of rivals
were these incomparable vessels, that the world, if need be, lay
at their mercy.</p>

<p>It was no longer policy to conceal their presence or their
movements, for the panic which their mere approach created was a
valuable factor in enforcing their demands. Proceeding in full
daylight at a leisurely twenty-five miles an hour, therefore,
they crossed the North Sea at a comparatively low altitude,
saluting on their way the <i>Prinz Ludwig</i>, which conveyed the
departing German Ambassador from these shores. Their arrival
above Thanet was timed to be simultaneous with the presentation
of Berlin's demands; upon being informed by wireless that this
had taken place, they sailed in extended line formation very
slowly towards London. At nightfall they rose a few hundred feet
higher in the air, and hung motionless. They were quite secure
from attack. No guns then in use could be trained on them at an
efficient range even if their outlines could have been discerned.
As a matter of fact, ingenious chromatic and mechanical devices
rendered the Krupp-Parsevals practically invisible even in the
dusk. Their engines were absolutely noiseless; and the only
outward lights they displayed were Lietke-ray emanations,
serviceable enough to the pilots and signal-readers of the other
vessels when seen through their sensitised glasses, but non-
existent to everyone else.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Otto," inquired the engineer, "that in England
they allow one to inspect their forts and barracks at will?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," admitted Otto, with a ready smile, "it is quite so.
The defences of the Thames have been my especial work during the
past two years."</p>

<p>"Is it that they are lax, or the system?"</p>

<p>"They are so well satisfied that they are safe: that, no
matter, everything must come right. <i>Ganz
sicher</i>&mdash;'cock-sure,' as they would say. That is why. Now
and then a little subterfuge is necessary, you understand; but it
is quite simple. The barrack arrangement I am thoroughly familiar
with, and I know all the ins and outs of the Bank of England and
the Mint."</p>

<p>"So?" nodded one of the group. "A useful detail."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was very interesting in itself," said Otto modestly.
"I am very fond of London&mdash;and even of the English to some
extent. London has a great charm to me, I confess, and from a
sentimental point of view I should be sorry to see it shelled.
Also, I have many good Cockney friends."</p>

<p>"'Cock-sure,' that is to say?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no," corrected Otto; "this is an idiom denoting one
who hears certain bells&mdash;it is a legend. There is a very
agreeable family among whom I boarded in Kensington. I should
really regret the demolition of that house in Sinclair Road by
any chance."</p>

<p>"There were young ladies, perhaps?" asked another, with
respect.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Otto; "but they were a very pleasant
family and could appreciate Schiller."</p>

<p>"That is very well," said one; "but I certainly think that I
have heard the Fraulein Elisabeth refer to some young English
misses."</p>

<p>"Another house Otto would regret to see demolished,
evidently," suggested the engineer slyly.</p>

<p>"It is quite true, another house," admitted Otto good-
humouredly. "This one was in Highgate, another part of London
altogether. The young ladies were four in number, and although we
did not discuss Schiller we became great friends. Indeed, I think
that Miss Phyllis and I might be considered to be betrothed."</p>

<p>"This is romantic," said another of the group; "the gallant
young soldier and the daughter of the enemy. Shall you return
after peace is made and claim your bride?"</p>

<p>"I do not think so," replied Otto, turning over the subject
seriously. "The father was engaged in the ship-ping business, so
that he will inevitably be ruined by the war, and from a
financial point of view the connection would scarcely be
advantageous. Then Miss Phyllis herself, though a very charming
companion for the theatre or ballroom, does not, I fancy, possess
those house-wifely qualities which&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Otto Kastl died with his English
sweetheart's name almost upon his lips, for this was the
classical moment when the first shock of aerial warfare too
place. How Brampton Reed had disposed his meagre force we are not
told, nor is there record of the name of him who struck the first
blow. From the circumstances Reed must inevitably have decided
upon a simultaneous attack upon the five Krupplins by five of his
wingmen, with two others, of whom he himself, as the most skilful
flier, was properly one, held in reserve. But even with the most
careful preparation, in the darkness of the night, and extending
along a battle-line of nearly two miles, the attack became a
scattered one, whereof it chanced that the man to whose care fell
the pilot <i>Wasser-jungfer</i> launched the signal.</p>

<p>So far as the group on the upper platform of <i>Die Wasser-
jungjer</i> was concerned, it may have been unheralded
extinction, absolute and immediate destruction striking
irresistibly from the unprobed recesses of the night. Or there
may have been a momentary vision of a vast and shadowy spectral
bird sweeping round dexterously on the utilised force of the
gale, and poising for a moment above the deck, where a startled
and irresolute handful of men stood resourceless despite the
thousand ingenious devices of defence possessed by the wonderful
vessel beneath their feet.</p>

<p>That moment closed the life-history of <i>Die Wasser-
jungjer</i>. To her consorts, from the vantage-ground of their
skillfully maintained line towards the south-east, it seemed as
though the pilot-ship had suddenly turned into a tormented thing
of fire, in which all her parts, human and inanimate, strove for
disentanglement. Then darkness closed over the space again, the
fantastic shreds of wreckage fell earthward, and even littered
their own decks, and the scudding constellation of blazing tags
of fabric and cordage was carried beyond their sight.</p>

<p>Under the surprise, the crews of the other vessels at once
fell into their appointed places and duties with disciplined
precision. For a minute there existed a doubt whether <i>Die
Wasser-jungfer</i> had been attacked or become the victim of her
own magazine. So well known and apprised were the insignificant
forces upon which England could call for battle in the air, and
so unequivocal had been the wording of the ultimatum as to the
terrible reprisal that would follow a wanton&mdash;as it was then
deemed it must be&mdash;attack on the Krupplins, that some
desperate mischance was the first thought in every German mind;
but even as the united searchlights of the remaining fleet blazed
out into the night, <i>Der Phönix</i>, the third vessel along the
line, was seen to be struck by the same appalling force, and,
falling apart midway, cleft through envelope, structure and
decks, she pitched headlong into the under-space, exploding and
careening strangely as she fell.</p>

<p>In the face of these disasters a splendid discipline remained,
but much of the elaborately contrived machinery failed to respond
to the emergency. The wireless-telegraph system broke down on
every vessel, and out of this fact arose the curious discovery
that among the obscure gases generated by exploding thorite in
the upper atmosphere was one that arrested the wave action of an
electrical discharge. The signal-readers were unable to take off
the Lietke-ray readings among all the aerial disturbances, so
that each vessel remained isolated, and acted on its own
initiative. Prince Friedrich, who commanded the fleet from the
deck of the flagship <i>Die Schwalbe</i> (the second in line, and
now a mile removed from her nearest support), failing to discover
any sign of open once decided to sail away at full speed from so
disastrous a spot, and to wait until daylight enabled him to
operate prudently. This order was indeed signalled from <i>Die
Schwalbe</i> by means of her searchlight, but in the multiplicity
of lights and cross-lights the significance of the flashes passed
unrecognised. <i>Der Geier</i> and <i>Der Fliegende Fisch</i>
therefore remained, pressing to their service every device for
repelling attack which they possessed, while <i>Die Schwalbe</i>
stole away to the northwest, silently, and with every light
obscured.</p>

<p>From the details supplied by the invaders who survived the
battle of Elmstead Down it is generally surmised that the second
wingman in the line of attack&mdash;the one through whose
defection <i>Die Schwalbe</i> was able to slip away
untouched&mdash;was probably struck by a flying fragment of
<i>Die Wasser-jungfer</i>, and at this point in the fight a
second mishap weakened the successful chance of Reed's desperate
venture.</p>

<p>In the uncertainty of their position <i>Der Geier</i> and
<i>Der Fliegende Fisch</i> had drawn closer together when the
fourth and the fifth wingmen simultaneously swept into the
effective range of their lights and rifles. The changed position
of the air-ships gave them a moment of indecision, and the fifth
man drew off and beat upwards rather than run the risk that they
should both fling themselves upon the same target. The movement
was fatal to himself; for although his companion selected and
successfully wrecked <i>Der Geier</i>, the evenly moving figure
in the clear white light drew a desperate fusillade from the
marksmen on both vessels. It mattered little in that position
whether he was touched by a single bullet or pierced by a
hundred: his wings collapsed, and a flattened, earth-churned
coppice marked the spot where he touched the earth.</p>

<p>The miscarriage must have taken place before Reed's eyes. He
had probably by that time deduced the failure of his second man.
He at once launched his only reserve, keeping himself for the
more arduous and desperate pursuit of the flagship. This man was
a strong flier and resourceful&mdash;there is personal testimony
of that, for all the survivors of Elmstead Down came from <i>Der
Fliegende Fisch</i>. Keeping directly under the body of the
vessel he ascended on the spiral stroke. On the decks above, the
bomb-turning nets had been fixed in position, and every available
man stood ready to act on the first sign of attack. The wingman
gained the height he desired, made a short sharp circle to
acquire the requisite impetus, and dashed himself bodily against
the stern of <i>Der Fliegende Fisch</i>. A third of the structure
of the frail vessel was torn away, but, by a miracle, sufficient
of the comparted envelope remained to sustain what was left, and
the unwieldy wreck swung and careered away before the force of
the gale, to be finally stranded along the coast of Wales.</p>

<p>Had the battle been fought out on any other element, the
reckoning must have pronounced it an unqualified victory, but
that thought brought no satisfaction to Brampton Reed as he
witnessed the destruction of the last visible Krupp-Parseval. He
had undertaken to destroy all, and he had failed. However great
the moral effect of the night's work might be, the one air-ship
that had escaped him&mdash;now morbidly alert, bitter for
revenge, and armed at every point&mdash;still dominated the
situation. Nor was it by any means certain what course offered
the best chance of retrieving the position. The speedy, well-
stocked vessel might press on to London, might seek out the
fleets and annihilate them, destroy the dockyards, go northwards
against the great ports and commercial cities, or adopt any one
of a dozen plausible lines of offence. Pursuit was hopeless;
chance encounter incredible.</p>

<p>Within thirty seconds he had decided to go back to London and
lay everything before the Government. His own motor-car was
waiting in readiness for any service. He found it, threw a single
word to the driver and got in. The driver, himself an even more
taciturn man, merely nodded as he took the wheel.</p>

<p>Reed carefully replaced the charge of thorite in its special
receptacle and began to unbuckle his flying-gear. A sudden flood
of light sweeping across the interior of the car compelled his
attention. He pushed down the window and looked out, just as the
taciturn driver brought the car to a standstill on his own
initiative.</p>

<p>For an appreciable period of time Reed was unable to grasp the
meaning of what he saw, so blank of any hope of the kind had been
his mind. High above, but a very few miles distant on the lateral
plane, two air-ships rode and manoeuvred in the full blaze of
each other's whirling searchlights. His tired brain clogged at
the mystery. He would, in an instant, have leapt to the
astounding surpassing luck of Die Schwalbe revealing
herself&mdash;but <i>two</i>...? The truth slipped into his mind
like a keen-edged ray of light. One indeed was <i>Die
Schwalbe</i>; the other the Army Dirigible No. 5! Forgotten among
the distraction of changed plans, or with an heroic defiance of
orders, the glorious, maligned <i>Quo Vadis?</i> had flown to the
sound of the guns. With a splendid opportuneness that no
mathematical precision could have bettered, she had blundered
across the course of the retreating flagship, and thereby done
the one thing that could save her country. For, be it remembered,
<i>Die Schwalbe</i> knew nothing of wingmen or the real means of
attack. She saw before her the one puny antagonist whose easy
defeat she had anticipated as a possible incident of her
triumphal passage, and it was inevitable that she should connect
this visible and known foe with the destruction&mdash;by some
chain of incredible fortune&mdash;of her consorts. Her
searchlights revealed no other menace, and she bent her energies
to the sure and complete annihilation of the audacious
challenger.</p>

<p>Below, the car turned, and skimmed along the highways and the
lanes in its desperate race, of which the prize was the destiny
of two empires. It could only be a matter of minutes...</p>

<p>Above, the duellists measured their long weapons and turned
warily as they sought each other's vital parts. <i>Quo Vadis?</i>
cherished no illusions about the outcome; only she was garnering
immortelles other than she knew of. She had, among the thousand
odds against her, one slight advantage: she was
willing&mdash;eager&mdash;to meet disaster if she could but
involve her adversary in that fall. It was denied her.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">An exulting cry ran along the decks of <i>Die
Schwalbe</i> when, outmanoeuvred in the exchanges, the gallant
but hopeless <i>Quo Vadis?</i> laid herself at a fatal
disadvantage. Every destructive weapon in her opponent's armoury
concentrated on that opening, and the torn and shattered wreck
plunged downwards with an ever-increasing impetus. A German
cheer, led by Prince Friedrich, greeted the achievement, the
searchlights swung downward to illumine the path of the falling
vessel, and every available man crowded the nearer rail of the
flagship's side.</p>

<p>If any had turned he would have seen a strangely outlined
figure gain their deck. For a moment Brampton Reed stood with
uplifted hand. Nothing could arrest the fall of his arm; nothing
avert the destruction held in the uplifted hand. In that supreme
moment the inspiration of a lifetime seemed to be forming into a
message or a human cry of portentous meaning that he must first
deliver...</p>

<p>The men at the rail talked, leaned forward, laughed, pointed,
and rejoiced in victory...then perished.</p>

<p><i>Sandgate, 1908.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI. THE GREAT HOCKINGTON
FIND</h2>

<p class="first">MR. LESTER, of the firm of Lester and Scott,
antiquarians, picture and bric-a-brac dealers, commission agents,
and general high-class pawnbrokers, stood before the fire in his
private room with the pleasantest expression imaginable upon his
slightly Hebrew features, and all, apparently, because an
insignificant little disc of tin&mdash;as it would certainly have
appeared to the uninterested&mdash;of about the size of a
sixpence had come to him by post that morning, packed clumsily in
an ordinary wooden matchbox, which bore the postmark of an
obscure Midland village.</p>

<p>Mr. Lester took the antique and bijoutry department of the
business, leaving his partner Scott the pictures, stones and
occasionally wine, while both interested themselves equally in
the discreet money-lending transactions that brought them into
profitable connection with certain circles of the aristocracy.
Neither, by the way, had any hereditary claim to the name he
bore, both "Lester" and "Scott" having been adopted as good,
solid, middle-class English cognomens, likely to inspire
confidence and respect.</p>

<p>"Look here, Scotty, my boy," cried Lester boisterously, as his
partner entered in response to his message, "what do you think of
that for a little beauty? Didn't I tell you that those quiet,
gentlemanly ads. in the country papers would bring in
something?"</p>

<p>Mr. Scott took the proffered coin without any show of
enthusiasm. A cold-eyed man, with a projecting lower jaw, that at
once suggested comparison with that of a pike, he carried a
mercilessly depreciating manner even into his most private
life.</p>

<p>"Anglo-Saxon?" he replied shortly. "What's the thing
worth?"</p>

<p>"Beornwulf, King of Mercia; lovely fine condition, too. Fetch
a tenner any time at Sotheby's, even on a wet day."</p>

<p>"Oh, that all?" said Scott dispassionately. "What do they want
for it?" Not that he despised such crumbs of commerce as
"tenners" any more than his prototype the pike neglects the
smaller minnows, but his personal tastes ran in the direction of
high finance and large transactions.</p>

<p>"No, my boy, that isn't all; not by a long, long chalk,"
replied Mr. Lester, with imperturbable good-humour. "That's only
the sample that came along in a chip matchbox, as though it might
be a penn'orth of tin-tacks. Listen to this:</p> <br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap"> "One Tree Cottage,<br>
High Cross,<br> Hockington.</span><br>

<p class="letter"> <span class="smcap">"Respected
Sirs</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"Seeing an advertisement that you buy old and
strange money, and such-like, I take the libberty ('Oh,
patriarchal Moses, Scott, he takes the liberty!' ejaculated Mr.
Lester rapturously) of sending you one which I juge to be such,
and respeckfully enquiring how much you would give by the
hundred, having recently got some.</p>

<p class="letter">"Yours obedient,</p>


<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">James Clay</span>."</p>

<p><br> Mr. Scott's mouth opened and closed unconsciously, until
he resembled a monstrous pike more than ever. "By the hundred!"
he murmured, in an awe-struck voice.</p>

<p>"It's a find, of course&mdash;treasure trove," continued
Lester keenly. "Ever heard of the Beaworth find, my son? Ten
thousand William the Conq. pennies kicked up in a cart-wheel rut.
Or the Hexham case? Eight thousand Saxon stycas fished out of an
old tin bucket. This will be known to history as the great
Hockington find, and Lester and Scott will corner the lot.
Hundreds! Why shouldn't we scoop thousands, tens of
thousands?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why," replied his partner, reverting from
momentary surprise to his habitual business pessimism. "Because
this fellow Clay will promptly get drunk on the strength of his
luck and open his mouth in the village ale-house. By now it will
be all over the place, and the owner of the land, and the tenant,
and the lord of the manor, and the Crown agent will all be there
at this moment, screwing the last denier out of him."</p>

<p>"No, no, no," exclaimed Lester, with a deprecating gesture.
"It won't be like that at all, my dear fellow. You're a good
business man in your own line, I don't deny it; but you've got no
romance, Scott; no imagination. This honest yokel Clay is certain
to be a shrewd, sober, thrifty son of toil of the kind that has
made this England of ours what it is. A little boorish and slow-
witted, perhaps, but none the worse for that. Busied with the
prosaic duty of mangling wurzels, or whatever his occupation may
be, his implement one day happens to go a few inches deeper than
usual, and then, as the poet says, 'The ploughshare turns them
out.' Your town artisan would grovel on his hands and knees at
once, and run about half demented, and give the show away; but
our stolid, cautious friend Clay does nothing of the kind. I see
and know the man from head to foot. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you going to offer him?" interrupted Scott
impatiently. "Silver is 2s. 2d. this morning. Try him with 2s.
6d. the ounce."</p>

<p>"Stop a bit, though," replied Lester, coming down at once to
the realms of pure business. "It's no use being wasteful. If we
tell him that this is very bad silver he may jump at much
less."</p>

<p>"Well, it's your affair," remarked the other, "and one thing
is certain: if there are hundreds or thousands of this particular
coin coming into the market, the price goes all to pieces."</p>

<p>Mr. Lester winked cunningly. "Leave that to me, my boy," he
replied. "If we collar the lot the trade needn't never know
nothing. We can spread it over as many years as we like. Quite a
few can go to New York and Philadelphia with solid pedigrees, and
one or two to Edinburgh. Then the private cabinets will take ever
so many direct, and when they're filled up we can begin to work a
sprinkling discreetly into the London sales. Besides, you don't
imagine that they're all alike, do you? This poor jay Clay don't
know a Saxon sceatta from a trouser-button, of course, but there
are certain to be dozens of types, and most likely from several
reigns."</p>

<p>"Get them first," hinted the material Scott.</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that, Scott. Indeed it was on the tip of my
tongue," protested Lester. "Heavens! What machines of business
this London of ours turns us into. No romance. What do we live
for, after all? My ambition is to make a million, and to be able
to call a duchess 'Dear lady' without being kicked out. Yours is
to make two millions, and to have a medal struck in your honour
as the endower of a national Yiddish theatre. It's all vanity,
Joey. This morning a lark was singing outside my bedroom
window&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In Maida Vale!" said Scott contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Well, it was a tom-tit, or a sparrow, or something. Anyway,
it gave me a taste for fields. I shall go down to this pretty
little Hockington place right away, and finish the business at
once. It's too enticing to risk anything over."</p>

<p>"Just what I should have suggested all along," replied the
partner. "Then if the things are scattered you may be able to
pick up a few. What shall we write the fellow?"</p>

<p>Mr. Lester thought for a moment, considering the matter from
its unromantic side.</p>

<p>"I'll drop him a line by the next post that there's
practically no market for these things, but if he'll send a few
more along as samples we'll see what can be done. That'll keep
him going. Then I'll be on the spot&mdash;not connected with L.
and S., mind you, but just a leisurely passing tourist with a
fishing-rod or a golf-club, see?&mdash;and you may call me a
descendant of Manasseh the Unlucky if I don't bring it off."</p>

<p>Late the following afternoon, as a remarkably pretty and
rustically picturesque maiden was leaning over the gate of One
Tree Cottage, a portly middle-aged gentleman, whose white hat and
fancy waistcoat proclaimed his determination to wear a holiday
air (despite the fact that he looked as little in keeping with a
country lane as a columbine would be at a Quakers' meeting),
stopped before her and inquired the distance to Hockington.</p>

<p>"About a mile, sir," replied the damsel with an artless
curtsy&mdash;a thing Mr. Lester had hitherto believed to be
extinct&mdash;"or rather more. Straight on."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear me," groaned Mr. Lester. He had, indeed, already
walked three times that distance through misdirection. "These
country miles are very long, my dear. Do you think that you could
make me a cup of tea&mdash;for payment, of course?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," she replied brightly. "We were thinking of
putting out a sign, only so few people pass here that it didn't
hardly seem worth while."</p>

<p>She opened the gate with another curtsy, and led the astute
gentleman through a patch of overgrown garden into a tiny
cottage. Nothing could have suited Mr. Lester's purpose better.
In ten minutes he had learned that her name was Rosie Clay, and
that she and her brother Jim lived there alone; that they had
only recently come from another part of the country where work
was scarce, and that Jim had for the time got temporary
employment on a farm a couple of miles away. So pleasantly was
the susceptible gentleman progressing that he was quite annoyed
when his business side insisted upon something being done towards
the real object of his visit.</p>

<p>On leaving town he had put into his pocket a few silver
pennies of the early Edwards, common enough coins but
sufficiently like the Saxon pieces to suggest comparison. With a
word about payment he now took out a handful of money, and,
spreading it on the table before him, carelessly sorted out the
silver pennies from among the current coins.</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed the girl, with sudden interest, "you've got
some of that funny old money too."</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted, without any sign of the excitement he
began to feel. "I'm fond of old things of that sort. Why, have
you got any?"</p>

<p>"Jim has," she replied. "He found a whole crockful, digging in
the little meadow at the back. Hundreds and hundreds of them. But
oh!" she exclaimed with a belated recollection, "I wasn't to say
a word to anyone. He would be dreadfully angry."</p>

<p>"Not in the circumstances, I'll be bound, my dear," he
reassured her. "Your brother very prudently did not want anyone
about here to know, but I'm different. I suppose he don't mind
selling them?"</p>

<p>"He did say something about it," she confessed.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Why shouldn't I buy them? Here I am on the
spot, sent by Providence, so to speak. But one thing at a time;
what shall we say for the tea?"</p>

<p>"Fourpence?" she murmured, with bashful hesitation (he had
consumed quite a substantial repast), and then catching his
expression of momentary surprise, added in confusion,
"Threepence?"</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear," protested Mr. Lester generously.
"Fourpence; not a penny less. It's quite worth it. Now, will you
let me see these rum old things your brother found?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I would," she replied, "but I can't, because he's
hidden them away somewhere."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mr. Lester, a little blankly. "He seems to be a
suspicious sort of cove, this brother of yours. What time will he
be back?"</p>

<p>"Generally about half-past six," she replied. "But I have a
few here that Jim gave me. I'm going to have a bangle made of
them when he says I may."</p>

<p>"A bangle!" exclaimed Mr. Lester, starting violently "Oh,
suffer&mdash;No, no, my dear. You shall have a better bangle than
this old truck for that pretty little arm, or I'll be hanged." He
took the half-dozen coins which she had poured from a little
china ornament, and examined them closely through his magnifying
glass. As he had anticipated, they belonged to three different
Mercian kings, and exhibited six different types. All were
passably rare, and in the most exquisite condition. To the man
who united the enthusiasm of the numismatist with the rapacity of
the dealer, the thought of "hundreds and hundreds" was a dazzling
intoxication.</p>

<p>"I buy such things if they come my way," he remarked
expansively, when he had satisfied himself. "It's a sort of
harmless craze of mine, and it don't cost me anything to speak
of. I gave an old fellow half-a-crown for a handful of these the
other day, and he was well pleased. What do you think your
brother wants for the lot?"</p>

<p>She was sure she did not know, she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," said Mr. Lester, with just a suggestion of
masterful authority. "You've some idea. Out with it."</p>

<p>With downcast eyes, for the subject of money seemed actually
to distress her, she admitted hearing Jim remark that from their
size they must be sixpences, and that, therefore, they could not
be worth less than sixpence each.</p>

<p>"Sixpence each!" exclaimed Mr. Lester appalled. "Sixpence
<i>each!</i> Sixpence of itself may not seem very much, my dear,
but when you come to consider hundreds of sixpences, why it's a
fortune."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," agreed the girl, simply, "and as he said they
couldn't be worth <i>less</i> than sixpence, he may want a
shilling."</p>

<p>Mr. Lester could not restrain a professional gesture of
despair. His faith in James Clay's arcadian simplicity had
received a shock. All hope of acquiring the treasure at the price
of "bad silver" would have to be abandoned. The only grain of
satisfaction he could extract from the situation was that in any
case the coins, from what he had seen, would be worth an average
value of at least five pounds each.</p>

<p>"Here he is," exclaimed Rosie, as a footstep sounded on the
path.</p>

<p>The door was thrown open, and a tall, well-made young labourer
entered. He clattered his tools down in one corner, tossed his
cap on to a chair, nodded unconcernedly to Mr. Lester, and
forthwith demanded to know whether his tea was ready.</p>

<p>"I must plead guilty to wasting your charming sister's time,"
interposed Mr. Lester gallantly. "Quite by accident it has come
out that we are all interested in the subject of this old money
that there's such a lot of about."</p>

<p>Clay bent a look towards his sister that made her tremble.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," expostulated the visitor affably. "No harm
done. You have 'em to sell and I'm willing to buy&mdash;at a
reasonable figure, of course."</p>

<p>"There you're wrong, mister," said Clay stolidly. "I have none
to sell."</p>

<p>Mr. Lester stared at him blankly, and Rosie forgot her
nervousness in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, Jim," she exclaimed, "and I told the gentleman that you
wanted perhaps a shilling each!</p>

<p>"That's like you, babbling," he retorted wrathfully. "Well, I
don't."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" protested the dealer.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Clay brusquely. "They're on offer to some
gen'lemen up at London. Gimme them few that you have, Rose. You
aren't to be trusted with anything; and then go to the shop and
get me a penny stamp."</p>

<p>"This is all very well, my young friend," said Mr. Lester, as
Rosie departed, and her brother proceeded to pack up the coins in
his rough-and-ready fashion, and to copy laboriously upon the
cover an address from a letter, which the observant gentleman
recognised as his own, "very nice and high-flown, but it ain't
business."</p>

<p>Clay answered him with a look of native shrewdness. "I don't
tell Rosie everything," he explained. "But as you seem to know so
much about it, I don't mind you seeing what I come across in the
<i>Herald</i>. What d'ye make of this?"</p>

<p>It was a small newspaper cutting that he passed across, and on
it Mr. Lester read as follows:</p> <br>

<p class="newspaper">"At Messrs. Puttick and Simpson's sale-rooms
last week, an Elizabeth sixpence, described as 'brilliant,'
realised fifteen shillings."</p> <br>

<p>"Now," continued the young man, "why shouldn't these be
Elizabeth sixpences, too? I can read an 'E' and an 'L' and
something that might be a 'Z' here and there. I don't altogether
make out that 'brilliant' because they are mostly blackish, but
I've rubbed one here with a bit of sandpaper, and it comes as
bright as a mirror; it do indeed."</p>

<p>Tears, real tears, stood in Mr. Lester's eyes as he regarded
the shocking wreck of a priceless Beornwulf from which Clay had
succeeded in removing almost every trace of the impression.
Argument was useless, he recognised, and, even worse, delay was
dangerous. The only thing was to buy, to get the coins away at
any reasonable cost&mdash;say as much under a quarter of their
value as possible.</p>

<p>"How many are there?" he inquired mildly.</p>

<p>"Over two thousand. I counted that many, and there were
hundreds more."</p>

<p>"At least you can let me see them?"</p>

<p>"Aye. I don't mind now that it's dark. They're put away in the
garden to be safe, and I don't want any chaps to see me getting
them up."</p>

<p>"That's right," nodded Mr. Lester. "You can't be too careful,
my dear young friend. Two thousand! Two thousand shillings, I may
remind you, represent a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>"At two shillings," he continued, musingly, as he received no
encouragement, "there would, of course, be two hundred pounds.
Now I will give you, not because they are worth it, but because I
think money ought to be more evenly divided, I will give you two
hundred and fifty pounds."</p>

<p>"You'd better see them," replied Clay, rising.</p>

<p>He was back in less than five minutes, carrying a small tin
biscuit-box, to which the crumbs of damp earth still clung. When
the lid was removed the one feeble candle shone on layer upon
layer of coins, all deepened by the action of time into a dull,
obscuring black. What rarities, what hitherto unknown types and
unique examples might not be revealed when, by a safe and proper
process, all this disfigurement was removed?</p>

<p>Mr. Lester ran his hand through the tinkling mass. It was too
bitter. He felt that he really could not leave them.</p>

<p>"I'll take them as they stand," he said. "I'll have all the
risk and uncertainty, and I'll give you&mdash;yes, I'll give you
five hundred pounds! A fortune!"</p>

<p>The sound of someone coming along the road caused Clay hastily
to replace the lid, and as the gate creaked he disappeared
through the back door to re-bury his treasure. It proved to be
Rosie returning.</p>

<p>"Well? Eh?" urged Mr. Lester, as Clay re-entered.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and proceeded to affix the stamp to the
packet.</p>

<p>"I'm going to post this now," he said shortly. "You lock up,
Rose, till I'm back again."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," volunteered Mr. Lester, who had a
pardonable desire to see the packet safely posted. "I like an
evening walk in any direction."</p>

<p>They walked together as far as the wall letter-box at the
crossroads, a quarter of a mile away, Mr. Lester smoking an
aromatic cigar and explaining the beauty of the evening, his
companion taciturn and unresponsive.</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds," remarked the dealer, as they stood at
the cross-roads, and it became perfectly obvious that he would
have to reintroduce the subject himself or leave it as it was.
"It's a gigantic sum. Consider what you could do with it, my dear
young fellow. You could take a farm, get married, put up for the
village council here and doubtless become a churchwarden. The
fact is, I overbid myself, and I'm beginning to repent."</p>

<p>"Well, good-night, then," said Clay.</p>

<p>"Stop a bit," urged Mr. Lester. "I did it and I don't go back
on my word.</p>

<p>"It isn't fifteen shillings each, and that seems to be the
value of these old Queen Elizabeth sixpences," remarked Clay
stolidly.</p>

<p>"Don't mind my saying so, my good chap, but you don't know the
first thing you're talking about," replied Mr. Lester with some
warmth, and it was not the least part of his annoyance that while
Clay certainly did not know what he was talking about, it was
quite impossible to correct him without the risk of putting him
on the track of something even more dangerous. "One article may
be worth a price, but if you go and turn two thousand of them on
the market, they become unsaleable."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," admitted Clay. "I've seen it with
sheep."</p>

<p>"Very well then, be reasonable. Is it a deal?"</p>

<p>"I'll think about it."</p>

<p>That was the utmost that could be got from the unsatisfactory
young man, and they parted on the understanding that the dealer
should come again on the following day for a definite answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Lester spent a tedious evening at the Railway Inn, and, as
it rained, an even duller day. Shortly after six he reached One
Tree Cottage again, determined to clinch the bargain by the
concession of another hundred.</p>

<p>"Rosie's out, but you can go in and sit down," said Clay, who
was already back and working in his garden. "I must finish these
few rows of cabbage while it's light."</p>

<p>Mr. Lester went in, but he did not sit down. The window of the
room commanded a view of Clay, and the visitor utilised his time
by peering into the ornaments and corners to see whether a few
Beornwulfs or a stray Ludeca had not been left about. The survey
brought him to the mantelpiece, where two envelopes instantly
caught his eye. One was that which contained his own letter, but
at the sight of the name embossed on the flap of the other, Mr.
Lester's heart for one crowded moment stood still. It was that of
another London firm, Lester and Scott's particular trade rivals,
and young Clay's procrastinating indifference began to assume
another face.</p>

<p>Mr. Lester's hesitation only lay in the direction of assuring
himself that he was in no danger of being seen. Then he took out
the letter and read as follows:</p> <br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">"Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">"We have received yours accompanying silver
coin. Owing to a slight ambiguity of expression we are in doubt
whether you have only this one coin or several others similar. If
the latter is the case we strongly advise you to bring them up
for our inspection without delay, and will guarantee your
expenses. If, however, this is the only one you possess, we will
make you an offer for it on hearing from you again.</p>

<p class="letter">"Yours truly,</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">J. S. Mercer and
Company.</span>"</p>

<p><br> He replaced the letter, ascertained from the postmark
that it had only been delivered that day, and sat down to think.
He was thus engaged when Rosie entered a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," she exclaimed, as soon as she saw him. What do you
think? Jim says now that he's thinking of going to London. Do, do
stop him!</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, your brother seems to be a person of
well-developed determination, tempered by a rather questionable
commercial morality," he replied testily. "How on earth am I to
stop him?"</p>

<p>"It's all through that wretched old money I know," she
continued wildly. "A letter came this morning and now he says
that he will go, and I know that he will be led astray and ruined
in that wicked place, because he is really so simple. Oh, sir,
buy them and then he needn't go."</p>

<p>"Well, I've done my little best, I must say," exclaimed Mr.
Lester.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she replied quickly. "He must have gone to the
Green Man after leaving you, for he was quite talkative when he
came back. He told me that you had offered him six hundred
pounds."</p>

<p>"Five hundred," corrected the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Was it, sir? He must have got the idea of six hundred
somehow: it seemed quite fixed in his mind. He said that he meant
to have a thousand pounds yet, and he didn't care whether you
gave it or someone else."</p>

<p>"A thousand pounds!" cried Mr. Lester, really much relieved to
know the worst at last. "Oh, ridiculous, preposterous, unheard-
of! No one would give it, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," agreed the maiden. "I don't think that all the
old money in the world would be worth that. It's just a big
number that he has got into his head."</p>

<p>"It's grotesque," fumed the dealer. "I don't mind telling you,
my dear, as it's no good now, that seven-hundred-and-fifty was
the limit I was prepared to go to. And that would have been a
wildly generous offer."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it would be, sir. I wish we could persuade him to
take it."</p>

<p>"But I haven't made it," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"No, and it would be no good," she said dolefully.</p>

<p>"We shall have to give it up then, eh?"</p>

<p>Rosie pondered a minute, deeply.</p>

<p>"I think, sir," she suggested prettily, "that if I could go to
him and say that you had let out to me that you would give eight
hundred pounds, and remind him that last night he had said a
thousand, he would say, as they do hereabouts, 'Well, I don't
mind splitting the difference.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Lester looked at the ingenuous maiden with an admiration
he usually reserved for excessively rare coins in mint
condition.</p>

<p>"Go and see, my dear," he said at length, "and you may earn a
really beautiful bangle. Only, for heaven's sake don't forget and
<i>begin</i> at the nine hundred with him."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">About noon, two days later, Mr. Lester entered
his partner's room, and flinging a suit-case into one armchair
and himself into another, groaned several times as though he was
in acute physical pain.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is the matter?" demanded Mr. Scott sharply.
"Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"At Mercer's, learning the worst," moaned Mr. Lester. "Scott,
if you utter one word of reproach I shall go down and commit
suicide on that five-hundred-guinea Persian carpet."</p>

<p>"Well, well," replied Mr. Scott, "I see. You've lost three
days and not got any of the things. Can't be helped."</p>

<p>So far from being soothed Mr. Lester roared like an agonised
elephant.</p>

<p>"Not got any!" he almost shrieked. "I've wasted three days and
I've got <i>all</i> the damned things. Would to the prophets that
each one was a millstone round the perjured neck of that accursed
young man!"</p>

<p>"You mean?" demanded Scott, with increasing deliberation.</p>

<p>"They're forgeries. All except the Beornwulf and the half-
dozen I examined there in the daylight. Look for yourself."</p>

<p>Mr. Scott opened the case, then the biscuit tin, and took out
a handful of coins.</p>

<p>"Forgeries!" he repeated with cold contempt. "Why, these would
scarcely deceive even <i>me</i>. And you have paid for them the
nine hundred pounds that you wired to be sent down to you in
gold!"</p>

<p>"He insisted on gold," babbled Mr. Lester, reverting to an
almost maudlin retrospective monotone. "When I offered him bills
at three months he said in his bucolic way that bills were what
he had to pay and he didn't want any of <i>them</i>. He said he
had never seen a cheque or possessed a bank-note in his life, and
he didn't understand <i>them</i>. All he understood was
gold."</p>

<p>"You are neither a child nor a dotard in the ordinary way,
Lester," said his partner. "What is at the bottom of this; were
you drunk or was there a woman?"</p>

<p>"Two cups of tea for fourpence, and a simple village maiden,"
replied Lester hysterically. "Scott," he exclaimed, rousing
himself, "the solid, blasting incomprehensible truth is that I
was dazzled. I never examined the bulk; I never had the
opportunity. I had seen the others and they were unimpeachable. I
couldn't in any case examine two thousand five hundred coins in
detail. I saw them for a moment by candle-light the first time. I
saw them again under the same conditions when the bargain was
struck, and I sealed them up. When I went yesterday with young
Walls to pay for them, we both carried loaded revolvers. We had
much better have carried wax candles. An hour late, Clay reeled
in blindly and offensively drunk. What with that, and with having
only just time to catch the last up train, I simply cut the
seals, opened the box&mdash;practically in the dark&mdash;and saw
that they were intact."</p>

<p>"I still fail to understand your exact system of estimating
the value of an important purchase," remarked Mr. Scott
inflexibly.</p>

<p>"Go on; I don't blame you," said the unhappy man bitterly. "I
shan't understand it myself in a month's time. But I do just now.
It was the arcadian simplicity of the scene, the peaceful cottage
interior, the fading light, the confiding rustic damsel, the
toil-stained young labourer's return. If there had been a jarring
note, a breath of suspicion&mdash;crash! But there wasn't."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>Mr. Lester shook his head in miserable ignorance.</p>

<p>"I've been round to see Mercer's," he said. "The genuine coins
were bought there a few weeks ago by a fashionably-dressed lady
and gentleman. Mr. Mercer distinctly remembers the lady
unconcernedly wrapping up the purchase in a sheet of his office
notepaper, and putting it in one of his envelopes, as they sat in
his private room. It's been a plant throughout, of
course&mdash;the whole thing mapped out and worked beautifully to
scale. I expect that she's an actress in real life, and he's
probably someone whom you've let in over something at one time or
another. Scott! in many things we are still as children groaning
in this land of Egypt!"</p>

<p>"At all events," said Scott, rising, "if we have luck and the
police are not more than normally obtuse, we may have the
satisfaction of seeing someone go into the house of bondage over
this."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Scotty, my boy; sit down," said Lester
dispassionately. "It's heart-breaking, but it's got to be. It was
clear treasure trove. We can't afford to make a fuss about
it."</p>

<p>Scott took up a pen with admirable restraint.</p>

<p>"Then we'll regard it as a bad debt," was all he said. "What
crumbs are there?"</p>

<p>"The Beornwulf, say twelve guineas; a hundred ounces of
silver, eleven more; the six coins he sent you, thirty-
five&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop a minute. What are those?"</p>

<p>Mr. Lester gripped the arms of his chair in a new frenzy.</p>

<p>"Sent on Wednesday night. D'ye mean to say you haven't had
them?"</p>

<p>"Had nothing of the sort," said his partner.</p>

<p>"Under my very nose," groaned Mr. Lester, with a flash of
intuition. "I see it all. Took out my letter and then coolly
addressed the genuine bait to himself, to put it out of my way,
right before my silly eyes! Scott, Scott, it's the finest
finishing touch. I forgive them everything!"</p>

<p><i>Hampton Hill, 1907.</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. HAUTEPIERRE'S STAR</h2>

<p class="first">HIS examination&mdash;searching according to the
science of the age&mdash;concluded, the physician did not for the
moment commit himself. There was some pretence in his affectation
of consulting a weighty tome, a suggestion of embarrassment in
his moving hand. Few would have called de la Spina tender-
hearted, but on that summer afternoon he experienced a pang at
the necessity of telling the high-spirited young nobleman, whose
name might have passed as a synonym for the brightest prospects
in the world, that the shadow of death was even now across his
path.</p>

<p>"You have already seen the worthy Malot, I understand?" he
said at length. "Did he express any definite opinion, M. le
Marquis?"</p>

<p>"The worthy Malot did not beat about the bush," replied the
Marquis lightly. "In fewer words than I can compress myself into
he assured me that I should be dead within six months."</p>

<p>Relief possessed de la Spina. Who would have guessed that this
debonair gallant knew already. Truly, beneath all its airs and
fripperies, this aristocracy bred its own peculiar virtues.</p>

<p>"You have had no other opinion?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, in a manner," replied the Marquis slyly. "For then,
at the pressing instance of His Excellency, I went to consult
that great and mysterious man who calls himself Algerbi el
Santo."</p>

<p>"Pest of God!" cried the physician with sudden heat; "is the
city mad? Juggler, charm-trucker, miracle-monger, poison-dabbler!
Does time hang so heavy on your hands, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied the young man languidly, "having
only six months of it left, I thought that I had better begin
making myself acquainted with the sights of which one hears so
much."</p>

<p>De la Spina stared, took snuff, and then vouchsafed a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, and how did the Mouthpiece-of-Light receive you?"</p>

<p>"Very shortly indeed," replied the Marquis. "Prefacing that he
had expected me, he informed me that the stars promised me a long
and untroubled life, and then excused himself further detail on
the plea that a future so devoid of problems was quite destitute
of interest to himself."</p>

<p>A saturnine grin flickered about de la Spina's swart
features.</p>

<p>"A long and untroubled life?" he repeated musingly.</p>

<p>"So he interpreted the stars," said the Marquis gravely.</p>

<p>"Spent doubtless among them?"</p>

<p>It was Hautepierre's turn to smile.</p>

<p>"One may hope so," he replied. "It is a better prospect than
your six months on earth."</p>

<p>"Depends. Not in Paris, I should wager some would say."</p>

<p>"Ah! that might imperil both."</p>

<p>"I can only answer for my department," said the physician,
dropping the jest and leaning forward to give point to his
emphasis. "And meaning by such-and-such&mdash;well, so-and-so,
rest certain that it will. A single deviation from the
straightest conservation of your strength might at any time be
fatal. If you want to make sure, contrive to meet a sudden
shock."</p>

<p>"So even the six months are strictly conditional? How would
<i>you</i> spend them in my place, Spina?"</p>

<p>There was no hesitation about the answer.</p>

<p>"I should devote it to completing my treatise proving that the
fish out of whose mouth St. Peter took the tribute-money was a
gurnet and not a dory, as that mountain of pedantic ignorance,
Gomez, and his trivial school contend."</p>

<p>Hautepierre was unable to suppress an indication of languid
amusement.</p>

<p>"A worthy ambition," he murmured. "Yet might it not perhaps
have been a gudgeon?"</p>

<p>De la Spina, who, as physician and confidant extraordinary to
His Majesty the King, stood upon what ground he pleased, be it
understood, frowned slightly.</p>

<p>"Do not jest with holy subjects, monsieur," he said
reprovingly&mdash;"you, of all men, who are touched most closely.
How, for that matter, will you prepare yourself? If by the
accomplishment of no great work, in prayer at least?"</p>

<p>"Or the next place to it&mdash;in bed, doubtless," yawned the
Marquis. "Must to Flambernard, then, that he finds another Keeper
of the Routes. Within&mdash;six months or six weeks was it, did
we say?"</p>

<p>Now at this point, illogically enough, the physician hesitated
for a moment to confirm the death-sentence. Hautepierre, as both
his friends and enemies well knew, was a gallant gentleman at
heart, his airs and languors nothing but the mint-marks of his
class in a time when all men took a pose. There were less amiable
poses de la Spina's, el Santo's, and that of his most benevolent
Majesty, to exemplify&mdash;than that of disclaiming a virtue
which one did possess.</p>

<p>"We are all in the hands&mdash;" he began, with half a
stammer, but the Marquis cut him short.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid that your knife is too sharp, man," he said
good-humouredly. "Fool, if I must needs hear it twice."</p>

<p>"There is no man more reliable than Malot in such a case. Six
months, you say, was his last word?"</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Would add 'with care.'"</p>

<p>"And not forgetting el Santo?"</p>

<p>"Oh, eternity!"</p>

<p>A subject congenial to the jest, evidently. De la Spina's
half-savage mirth followed Hautepierre down into the narrow
street.</p>

<p>To note the young Marquis a few hours later, as he entered the
playhouse by the Watergate and exchanged elaborate greetings with
his friends, none could have guessed; but a rose-water stoicism
was the mode, and Hautepierre was too correct to show such
originality as a display of natural feeling. By consent, he was
neither quite a talker nor quite a listener, but between the two,
as an irresponsible commenter, he affected to be consumed by
boredom and dropped epigrams that seldom failed to bite a little.
Malot and de la Spina might have their say, but it was not for
Francois Vivian, Marquis d'Hautepierre, to reform his whole
scheme of life for so trifling an incident as death.</p>

<p>The play was <i>The Catalonian Shepherdess</i>, a forgotten
comedy, or only remembered in connection with the appalling
holocaust accompanying its production; for on this night, when
arcadian sentiments were swaying the rose-water sympathies of the
house, and danger, as Hautepierre afterwards plaintively
remarked, seemed as remote as real sheep and real shepherdesses,
the demoralising cry of "Fire!" suddenly rang out upon a startled
pause. Hard upon the word a tracery of flame showed through the
flimsy representation of a sylvan glade, as though the cry had
been the cue for its appearance; and at the sight and the sound
of its ominous crackle the audience rose and swept back under a
single maddened impulse.</p>

<p>There could, from the first moment, be only one ending in such
a death-trap to a panic so sudden and complete. Those who
escaped, escaped in the three minutes of grace. The perfumed
stoicism of the aristocracy and the steady common sense of the
bourgeoisie shared a kindred fate, and before each narrow door it
was a horrid swarm of frenzied animals, robbed of every
resourceful instinct and outside the boundaries even of humanity,
that fought murderously for life. Even when the doors could be
opened a solid phalanx of dead and living wedged the passage
beyond the hope of extrication. Some mercifully lost
consciousness and never woke; others, less happy, endured the
various forms of madness, and by their excesses lent an added
horror to the short and lurid scene.</p>

<p>In all the house there were two persons only who did not join
in the wild stampede. From his place Hautepierre watched the
earlier part of the wholesale tragedy with emotion indeed but
almost in outward calmness. He saw that the situation was
desperate, but he already knew that death was very near to him.
Despite the pose, during the past few hours he had thought
continually of the prospect, and he had come to regard the
inevitable at least without despair. Now death took another and a
sharper form; that was all.</p>

<p>It was thus that he became aware of the other who had
remained. On the stage was a solitary shepherdess, stayed by a
very different reason. It had been the part of this one nymph to
be bound to a tree until released by her favourite swain, but at
the first alarm the stage was cleared in a twinkling, the
faithful shepherd showing a remarkably clean pair of heels as he
led the van. A half-circle of increasing fire now surrounded her;
hot embers and burning tags of gauze and paper began to fill the
air, but it was still possible to reach her, and in a sudden
compassion for her pathetic isolation Hautepierre climbed up to
the stage and gained her side. So far she had been silent, either
through terror or a resolution equal to his own, but seeing him
come towards her she cried out piteously.</p>

<p>"Hush, mademoiselle," he said gently, "do not break down, you
who have been so brave. I cannot save you, but I will stay with
you to the end."</p>

<p>"I cannot die bound," she cried. "Cut this rope with your
sword, for the love of heaven."</p>

<p>His sword was useless: one cannot cut silk thread with a
needle, and to his unaccustomed fingers the simple knots were
formidable, but as he gradually unwound the coils she grew calm
again.</p>

<p>"Is there no escape that way, monsieur?" she demanded,
indicating the reeking auditorium. "But it was noble of you to
come! I do thank you."</p>

<p>"The outlets are all blocked," he replied. "One could not
breathe for ten seconds in that air now." It was true: by one of
the peculiarities that mark great catastrophes, the burning stage
formed the only refuge-ground in the whole theatre, for the
volume of smoke, carried high above their heads, lay in a solid
bank beyond, where it had already obliterated not only every sign
of life but every sound. The shrieks, the prayers and all the
pandemonium of terror that had reigned a few short minutes before
were smothered down, and nothing punctuated the constant bull-
roaring of the flame but the intermittent under note of crackling
wood.</p>

<p>Twice her flimsy garments had caught fire beneath the rain of
sparks, but he had crushed it out. He wrapped his cloak around
her and led her to the very edge of the stage, but it seemed as
though the boards they stood on must burst into flame beneath the
scorching breath that licked across them.</p>

<p>"Why did you come to me, monsieur?" she demanded. "You might
surely have escaped, perhaps."</p>

<p>"There was no escape," he replied; "and&mdash;one does not.
You were alone and I thought it might be less to you if you had
someone."</p>

<p>"You are very brave and strong. I did not know that men were
like that now. Will it be very painful when it comes,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied; "we need not suffer that. One must not throw
away one's life, but when the moment comes I will carry you down
into the smoke beyond, and very soon it will be as though we fell
asleep."</p>

<p>"You will hold me in your arms, monsieur? I fear that I may be
a coward at the last, but I feel braver near you."</p>

<p>"I will hold you to the end, mademoiselle. Do not fear for
yourself; I gather courage from you."</p>

<p>"I thank the kind God for sending you," she said earnestly. "I
made my prayers while I was bound. Have you yet prepared,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;thought of things differently," he replied. "You
shall pray for me, if you will."</p>

<p>"I shall not cease to do so to the end. Farewell upon earth,
dear friend."</p>

<p>The moment of their immolation had arrived. Hautepierre, half-
blind and tottering, bent forward, when suddenly the ground
opened at his feet. He had a confused thought that the stage was
breaking up, but the next moment out of the abyss there rose a
face&mdash;scorched, torn, and soiled beyond
recognition&mdash;while the accompanying voice never ceased or
paused from bellowing stentorianly:</p>

<p>"Berthe! Berthe! Art thou here? Call, littlest one, before I
go mad! Berthe! Berthe! Art thou here? Where art thou, Berthe
Berthette?"</p>

<p><i>"Louis!"</i> shrieked Berthe, rushing to the edge of the
trap-door. "Hast thou come?"</p>

<p>"Mary!" exclaimed the man with a mighty breath; "throw
yourself down, Berthe. Do not hesitate; I catch you. And you too,
monsieur, leap if you love life.</p>

<p>"Quickly," continued their rescuer, as he hurried them along.
"The roof must fall, and then if we are beneath the stage&mdash;"
He turned into what appeared to be a passage as he spoke, though
to Hautepierre, fresh from the glare above, all was blackness. A
rumble ending in a crash sounded behind them. "A near thing!" ex-
claimed their guide. "Ah, littlest, another minute at my
work&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," cried Hautepierre, becoming conscious of an increasing
heat and light in spite of his temporary blindness, "are we not
approaching the fire again? Is there a safe way out?"</p>

<p>"Not that way," replied Louis, stretching out a shaking hand.
"I singed my wings in trying it myself. But it was not for
nothing that I played at brigands in these caves a dozen years
ago. Gently here, monsieur; we go slowly for a little while and
pick our way." He lifted up Berthe as he spoke, and Hautepierre,
stumbling across a spade, found that a mass of fresh loose earth
and rubble-stone was strewn about the path. "Through here," cried
Louis, and seemed to melt away into the wall. The Marquis groped
his way through a rough, low aperture and passed into an
atmosphere of Stygian dark and noisome damp.</p>

<p>"Faugh!" he exclaimed, "but this drama carries us through
sharp contrasts, friend. Where are we now?"</p>

<p>"Among the dead," replied Louis; "and in sight of life once
more."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Marquis, "I remember hearing of these
labyrinths from time to time. So yours, my friend, is a love
which has indeed broken through the grave!"</p>

<p>"Truly, you may say so in a way, monsieur," he replied. "And
there," he continued, as they passed into a larger shaft, "there
before us lies the blessed light of day."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">In the interests of science, de la Spina had
besought the Marquis to give him facilities for following the
course of his disease systematically So clear and well-defined a
case was rare, he had said. The profession would be stirred,
humanity at large would benefit, and, in short, the young man
would be acting selfishly if he kept the good thing to himself.
Hautepierre had amiably concurred, and thus it came about that
two days later he was again ushered into the physician's
room.</p>

<p>Heavy but alert, de la Spina was to-day the iron man of
science, the momentary gleam of sentiment or compassion put
aside. His greeting was business-like; his preparation to the
point; and throwing open his record-book he proceeded to test the
characteristic symptoms of the case&mdash;to test, and then to
re-test, to mutter in his teeth and, fuming, test again.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you are finding me not up to your
expectations," remarked Hautepierre, looking round. "But I can
assure you that I feel no worse."</p>

<p>"It is credible, M. le Marquis," replied de la Spina grimly.
"And the growing pain here, of which you spoke?"</p>

<p>"Why, to tell the truth, I have not thought of it to-day. In
fact, I do not feel it now."</p>

<p>"So one might assume. Then as regards the sense of dying as
you started up from sleep?"</p>

<p>"That has not troubled me the last two nights, as I now recall
it."</p>

<p>"Not unnaturally."</p>

<p>"But I protest to you, monsieur, that I feel much better on
the whole."</p>

<p>"You have every reason to do so."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"In every way. There is nothing the matter with you!</p>

<p>"You jest, surely. The positive symptoms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have all disappeared.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"One cannot say."</p>

<p>"Is it in consequence of anything?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Then I shall not die?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;of old age."</p>

<p>"And the worthy Malot?"</p>

<p>"Can only bear me out in every detail."</p>

<p>"But that scourge of humanity, Algerbi el Santo?"</p>

<p>"May go to the father of all his tribe in Hades!" exclaimed de
la Spina with great heartiness.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. THE GOOSE AND THE GOLDEN
EGG</h2>

<p class="first">I MET Dunford accidentally at Boulogne. I was
struggling home from Chantilly, rather storm-tossed by adverse
circumstances, it may be confessed, but imperturbably cheerful
through all. Dunford, on the contrary, was depressed. I had
struck up acquaintance with the man on the Rugby platform a year
before, and had found him a dull, heavy dog; but coming across
one another in the Rue Victor Hugo on a wet day we greeted each
other cordially.</p>

<p>He had done pretty well on the Westenhanger course, he told
me, and then, having nothing better to do, he had crossed on the
previous day, and in pursuit of a system had lost on the little
horses all that he had won on the big ones. I also have a system,
a much better and simpler one than his, and as Dunford still had
a few pounds left I proposed that we should go back to the rooms
and retrieve his losses. He assented moodily, so we went to the
casino and played the game my way, but not entirely my way, for
at the very worst possible moments Dunford would introduce
variations of his own, with the inevitable consequence that in
half-an-hour he was as penniless as I was.</p>

<p>"I wish to Peter that I had never met you," he remarked ill-
temperedly as we went out. "I had kept back enough to carry me to
Newmarket. What on earth are we going to do now?"</p>

<p>The man was boorish, but I passed it with a glancing jest;
after all, it had been his money. As it was still raining, I
proposed that we should go to his apartment for the time.</p>

<p>He had a modest room in a cottage on the Boulevard Sainte-
Beuve, near at hand. "Even yet," I said, laughing at the conceit,
"we are by no means destitute. I have the half of a five-pound
note, and logically that is two pounds ten, surely."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, staring hard at me, "have you half a five-pound
note, Sissley?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I have," I replied. "I have carried it about with
me for two years."</p>

<p>"That's very strange, because, as a matter of fact, I happen
to have half a five-pound note also."</p>

<p>I don't think that I was ever more surprised in my life,
although it was only a simple coincidence after all.</p>

<p>"Which end is yours?" demanded Dunford as he hunted through
his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"The signature," I replied, producing it. "And yours?"</p>

<p>His was the other end and we laid it down on the table beside
mine. Really, they went very well together, although the numbers
differed, of course, and the dates. His was for the 3rd of June,
1905, and mine for the 5th of June, 1903; it was scarcely
noticeable.</p>

<p>Half mechanically, I took out a pocket-knife, and, placing the
two halves together&mdash;as it happened they overlapped in the
lettering&mdash;I began to cut them down to make a perfect whole.
It was merely the pastime of an idle moment, I assure you.</p>

<p>"How did you get yours?" I asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"There was a rogue of a fellow that I wouldn't trust with a
cracked shilling," he explained. "He must have something on
account, he said, so I gave him the other half of this as a
guarantee. Well, he didn't earn it, so I kept the second half,
see? How did you get yours?"</p>

<p>There was no reason at all why I should not tell him.</p>

<p>"I obtained some valuable information for a degraded creature
some time ago," I replied. "Affecting to profess gratitude, he
asked me as a personal favour to accept the trifling gift of a
five-pound note, but on second thoughts he decided to keep half
of it until he had verified the facts. In the end he became
undignified, and burned the second half before my face."</p>

<p>Dunford laughed outrageously. The good humour of a boor is
always trying.</p>

<p>"What have you made of it?" he said, when he had finished.</p>

<p>I had trimmed the edges until they fitted perfectly. A strip
of stamp paper completed the work.</p>

<p>"It is nothing but a joke," I said, tossing it across to him,
"but if one were among friends who could appreciate the jest, it
might serve as a means for much harmless pleasantry.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing but a joke, of course," he said, examining
it; "but, really, I think that the joke might pass, Sissley."</p>

<p>I deprecated the suggestion with a waggish finger.</p>

<p>"Consider, Dunford," I said warningly. "We are in a foreign
land where Bank of England notes, although reverenced by the
natives almost as much as English gold, are comparatively
uncommon objects of the seashore, and are, therefore, submitted
to a closer scrutiny than they would be at home."</p>

<p>"Let the jockey ride the horse, my lad," he replied pompously.
"Are you going to change it, or am I?"</p>

<p>I gave him the honour gracefully.</p>

<p>"You have the presence, Dunford," I admitted, "and that
particular variety of fatness that never fails to carry to the
public mind the suggestion of prosperity. At the moment you look
in every way more of a five-pound note than I do. It must be
you."</p>

<p>"Very well," he grunted. "Let me; that's all."</p>

<p>"But not here," I suggested. "Don't send out for change. Let
it be to-morrow, in the ordinary way of making a purchase
somewhere. That's half the business."</p>

<p>He nodded. "I'll tell you what, Sissley," he said. "I'll try a
money bureau. Right in the glare of the limelight, my boy! What
if it doesn't come off? I've been had with a wrong 'un, that's
all."</p>

<p>I came nearer admiring him then than ever before&mdash;or
since.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" I cried. "That stamps it as a merry jest
throughout."</p>

<p>"Well, you and your wit can have the armchair for the night,"
he said, half-grudgingly. Had I been host, my guest should have
had the bed; but such was the man.</p>

<p>The next morning Dunford went out after breakfast, and in less
than half-an-hour returned with six gold pieces, three francs and
a half, and the admission that he had expended the other two
francs in a small bottle of Bass.</p>

<p>"It's too easy, my son," he said, swelling with self-
consequence. "Always put your money with the Old Firm. Who gave
Yellow Rambler at a thousand to eight for the Warlaytree Plate?
We are the people. Coming out?"</p>

<p>"Presently," I said, "presently; but, in the meantime, I
should like a few minutes of your serious attention. While you
have been out&mdash;drinking beer, Dunford&mdash;I have been
thinking."</p>

<p>"Let it go at that," he retorted. "Yes; while I have been out
doing the work, you have been snoozing in the easy-chair."</p>

<p>"You scintillate to-day, positively," I laughed. "Well,
touching your adventure&mdash;what sort of a place did you get
to?"</p>

<p>He looked at me out of his pale eyes with dull curiosity.</p>

<p>"An ordinary money-changer's shop," he replied. "The fellow is
a German. I saw him make sure that the secret marks were
right&mdash;'secret marks,' my Peter, when every little josser on
an office-stool knows 'em!&mdash;and he thumbed the top right
corner with guileless faith. What about it?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of a certain goose, Dunford?" I asked
airily&mdash;"a certain goose Dunford?"</p>

<p>I emphasised the point, for it was frequently my humour to
hold up the heavy, unsuspecting man to the shafts of my derision
solely for my own inward amusement.</p>

<p>"What goose?" he demanded, half inclined to be angry without
knowing exactly why.</p>

<p>"It laid a golden egg," I replied. "Until its owner short-
sightedly killed it. If you had a goose that laid a golden egg,
would you kill it, Dunford?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk rot!" he said irritably.</p>

<p>I laughed good-humouredly. He was obviously uneasy at not
being able to follow the delicate play of my mind, but I said no
more.</p>

<p>I waited for a few hours, and then, leaving Dunford with an
excuse, I sought out his German friend. He had a little shop just
off the tram route, and, after the manner of his kind, he
displayed his stock-in-trade behind his well-protected window.
There I saw our note, and saw also that it was the only one of
its sort.</p>

<p>There is a great deal in the air of approach before a word is
spoken. I entered the shop as a typical holiday-making Briton; I
neared the counter with the smile of a friend; and I am sure that
my greeting conveyed to the attending Teuton the suggestion of a
benevolent interest in his welfare. Then I informed him that I
required a five-pound note; and having only the sum of fifty-
three francs in my possession I made some discreet demonstration
with it.</p>

<p>The elderly German reached out his note and placed it before
me, while I passed the time with gay badinage on the subject of
the profits of money-changing and usury at large. I also told him
a funny story about a countess and a runaway flying-machine, and
generally established myself on genial terms with him. Then I
began to count out my francs.</p>

<p>At forty-eight the smile faded from my face, and a startled,
even pained, look took its place. Mechanically I counted out
three more francs&mdash;stopped&mdash;then swept the lot back
into my pocket. I flatter myself that it was delicately led up
to&mdash;first, an almost imperceptible arrest of the bubbling
gaiety of expression, a half-incredulous doubt; then a swift,
hawk-like glance into his face; another sharp examination of the
note, here, there; and with grieved conviction I straightened
myself up and pushed the note away.</p>

<p>But I had no intention of becoming unapproachable. Well, were
we not both men of the world? The attempt&mdash;if attempt it had
been, and not mere accident&mdash;had failed. I had been too
sharp, and I was not a penny the worse off. Gradually my good-
humour returned. I smiled&mdash;I smiled roguishly, and shook my
head sagely from side to side in amiable reproof.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my friend," I said mildly; "not to-day. Oh, by no
means to-day with Mr. Walker, of London!"</p>

<p>I fear that much of the subtle range of emotion was wasted
upon the German, who was a dull, heavy man, something like
Dunford; so like, indeed, that I marvelled afterwards how the one
could impose upon the other.</p>

<p>"What is the madder with it?" he said blankly. "It is a goot
node, is it not? Yes, yes, it is goot."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is good enough logically," I admitted; "but not
commercially. It is composed of two good halves, but the whole is
not good.</p>

<p>"There is no hole," he protested earnestly. "See, it is in its
entirety gomposed of two portions adhesively together emplanked,
which is permissible. Yes, it is a goot node."</p>

<p>I smiled knowingly and pointed first at one number and date,
then at the other. By word and expression I sought to convey the
information that I was astute&mdash;but not unsympathetic.</p>

<p>"They goincide dissimilarly!" he exclaimed, sitting down
helplessly. "Then I have been in-taken!"</p>

<p>"Oh, not necessarily," I said. "Possibly it was a genuine
mistake. But it would never do for a man in <i>your</i> position
to pass it off and then have it traced back to you."</p>

<p>"It is a thing ingomprehensible," he moaned. "Who ever heard
of a node of two goot dissimilar portions gomposed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for that matter I have had one myself," I said
reminiscently; "and after the infernal trouble I had before I
could get anything from the Bank for it, I shall not forget it in
a hurry."</p>

<p>"Ach, then it is remediable?" he asked, brightening up a
little.</p>

<p>"Well, you may call it a remedy," I said with a laugh,
offering him a cigar and lighting one myself, "but as a matter of
fact it's more like an amputation. It took me a month to find it
out, and cost about half the value in fees. You have to advertise
the facts, giving the two numbers and dates, once a week for
three weeks in the <i>Times</i>, the <i>Gazette</i>,
and&mdash;er&mdash;the <i>Pink One</i>. After that you can attend
before the Lord Mayor of London and make a declaration, which has
then to be taken to Doctors' Commons to be sworn, and to Somerset
House to be stamped."</p>

<p>"Any common doctor can swear?" he asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"Possibly, but not in this case," I replied. "It is the King's
Proctor, really."</p>

<p>"I have seen of him in the records," he remarked
intelligently. "He interferes."</p>

<p>"I have known people who made the same complaint," I admitted.
"All this, you understand, has to be done in person; no agents or
intermediaries are allowed. Then you are summoned to attend
before a meeting of the directors of the Bank of England, and,
after you have produced two householders of the City who enter
into bonds that they will be responsible for the money being
returned if it has been wrongfully claimed, you receive the
amount, less twenty per cent, deduction, in the form of a
Treasury Bill payable three months after date upon personal
application at the Board of Works. Our English methods are rather
elaborate, I suppose, but the authorities are thoroughly
safeguarded by the process."</p>

<p>The elderly person groaned in German and sat down and got up
again three times.</p>

<p>"Mine frient," he said at length, "you are returning to London
yourself in short?"</p>

<p>"Yes; 'Back to the old log cabin once again,' I suppose," I
hummed airily.</p>

<p>"Log gabin?" he repeated helplessly; "ach! by steam-bode, to
be sure. Well, you are what you call familiar with the rope. You
shall haf this really goot though of two dissimilar halves
gomposed node sheep. You shall haf him, yes, for sixty-five
francs."</p>

<p>I smiled; I laughed quietly; I shook my head and hemmed and
hawed. I was unwilling; I was not really interested. For I saw
that the thing was practically done, and my part of the haggling
could be carried out in the highest-minded manner possible. The
German advanced my unique knowledge of the procedure, the
commercial stagnation of Boulogne, and his own passionate love of
the Fatherland. I replied with the inviolable dignity of London
business life, Tariff Reform, and the uncertainty of human
affairs. We met at forty-two francs, seventy-five.</p>

<p>I pass over Dunford's exclamation when I laid the note before
him. It would convey little to the reader, as it would of
necessity consist almost entirely of a line of dashes ending with
a note of interrogation.</p>

<p>"This, Dunford," I said, dealing with the interrogation, "this
is the goose that lays the golden egg&mdash;or else the golden
egg that our goose has laid us. I purchased it from a poor German
merchant who had been grossly imposed upon, and its selling price
seems to be about one pound, fourteen shillings."</p>

<p>"Sissley," said Dunford fatly, "I'll take it all back,
whatever I have said. I never thought much of you
before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it's a joke," I insisted. "A mad, merry midsummer freak.
I positively decline to regard it in any other light than that of
a jest. See, I have put down the elderly German's address in my
pocket-book. In the course of time other addresses may be added,
but to whatever length the list extends I shall certainly send to
each the balance and explain our whimsical frolic, at a
convenient season."</p>

<p>"&mdash;or since," concluded Dunford, eyeing the book with
great disfavour.</p>

<p>We left Boulogne the next morning and moved on to Etaples,
where the redemption price rose to thirty-seven shillings and
sixpence, which Dunford said was too much; but at Abbeville it
fell to one pound twelve. Turning back to the coast, we continued
our sentimental journey through quaint old Normandy with no
thought for the morrow. Each day, each new place brought its
little contribution, and I may state that from Cape Griz Nez to
Cherbourg the average value set upon a Bank of England five-pound
note, "of two dissimilar halves gombosed," is one pound eleven
shillings, and ninepence. On the coast it is slightly above that
figure, inland proportionately below: an interesting fact for
which I am quite unable to offer any explanation.</p>

<p>In our leisure&mdash;and business did not occupy more than two
half-hours each day&mdash;I took Dunford to cathedrals and
picture galleries, pointed out the historic associations of each
place, and strove, though unsuccessfully, I fear, to awaken an
interest towards the romantic and the beautiful in the gross
man's breast. In return, he took me to music-halls of the lower
kind and to gambling dens. Yet he was capable in his department.
He acquired a wonderful insight into the characters of money-
changers, and rarely made a mistake. Englishmen and Americans he
passed over, merely changing a piece of money with them, and if a
Greek came forward he left the office at once without even that
formality. Still, we had our rebuffs&mdash;who has not, when life
is full of them? Twice the discrepancy was detected and Dunford
had to extricate himself as feasibly as he could. At Dieppe a
rude person made offensive remarks towards myself, which left me
no alternative but to withdraw; at Rouen an ignorant oaf
maintained to the end that the two halves of a Bank of England
note always varied in number and date, "to make fraud more
difficult"; while at Caen the note had already been passed out
again. But by the time we reached Rouen we were in funds, and
procuring two fresh notes we replenished our supply of golden
geese.</p>

<p>Like all other pleasant things in life this simple idyllic
existence, with its absence of sordid cares, its free, healthy
occupation, and its assured ten pounds a week each, came to an
end all too soon. It happened suddenly, and, I need hardly say,
unexpectedly, at Rennes. Dunford had carried out his part of the
business and retired. In the lightest-hearted manner possible I
had followed him up, and with gay sallies and ingratiating
address had depreciated the note to thirty-eight shillings, when
an offensive-looking agent of the law rose from his lair behind
the counter, and at the same moment a grotesque personage wearing
a sword appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go into the fullest details. Dunford,
of course, like a craven traitor, fled at once, and I had the
greatest possible difficulty in procuring the services of an
advocate. I addressed myself to the representative of my native
country, asking him to explain to the French authorities that if
they persisted in their ludicrous mistake they would become
contemptible in the eyes of the world, and requesting him to
interest himself for my immediate release. His reply was to the
effect that he was not interested. My lawyer advised me to
abandon the plea that the transactions were a huge jest from
beginning to end.</p>

<p>"But there is no other explanation of my innocence," I
cried.</p>

<p>"That is true," he replied, "but you will get off rather
lighter without it."</p>

<p>"The note-book," I reminded him; "it bears witness of my
intention."</p>

<p>"It is being used as evidence against you. The suggestion is
that you kept a list to avoid going to the same place twice."</p>

<p>I fell back speechless at the malignity of fate and the
ingenuity of man. Even my irrepressible fount of gaiety was
almost quenched.</p>

<p>In the end, a ridiculously got-up official, after some
farcical proceedings, sentenced me to six months' incarceration
in an unwholesome den. I have just finished this period, but I
positively decline to consider that the whole burlesque travesty
leaves the slightest reflection upon my character.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. THE MAKING OF MARIANNA</h2>

<p class="first">THE Bartletts led a nomadic existence within
that radius of Charing Cross that business requirements imposed
upon Mr. Bartlett. As a result the Dead Letter Office dealt with
no inconsiderable portion of their correspondence and
comparatively intimate friends had been known to address them
through the "Personal" column of the daily press.</p>

<p>It now being July they had taken up their quarters in a
furnished cottage at Sunbury, migrating thither from Hampstead
apartments, themselves the successors of a bijou flat in Chelsea,
to which they had moved from a Bayswater boarding-house, after
spending Christmas at a Brighton hotel.</p>

<p>"The system has its advantages," Mrs. Bartlett would admit to
her friends, "but I should not advise you to give up your pretty
nouses to try it. Why? Oh, well, during the nine years that we
have been married I have had the experience of twenty-seven
different servants. I was tempted to make a list of them the
other day. Twenty-seven, my dears!"</p>

<p>"In any case that is the nuisance nowadays," one of the
friends replied. "But what a red-cheeked, pleasant-looking
country girl you have now. She did not come to you with the
recommendation of County Council School 'accomplishments,' I
should imagine?"</p>

<p>"Indeed no," agreed Mrs. Bartlett.</p>

<p>"Norfolk?" suggested the friend.</p>

<p>"No. From a place&mdash;a place on the river."</p>

<p>"Not about here, though?" persisted the lady. "One might as
well be on Juan Fernandez for any chance of hearing of a girl
locally. If they don't go into town their ambition centres on
Richmond&mdash;the Terrace, you know," with a shrug and a
glance.</p>

<p>"No, some distance from here," replied Mrs. Bartlett briefly.
"Do you care for croquet?"</p>

<p>It was possible to be discouraging towards the casual friend,
but that same evening Mrs. Bartlett's brother, who was staying at
the cottage, leaned across the table and with an elaborate
affectation of the late visitor's manner, remarked
tentatively:</p>

<p>"Let me see: where did you say she came from, dear?"</p>

<p>"I did not say," replied the lady with a laugh. "But is is
called Tidal Basin, if you wish to know, Flip."</p>

<p>"Good," remarked Philip with an air of appreciation. "This
sister of mine improves since she moved into your family, Tom. 'A
place on the river'; 'Some distance from here'&mdash;true; but
what about the County Council School, She-bee?"</p>

<p>"'Accomplishments,'" corrected Phoebe. "She came with no
accomplishments. Surely a week has shown you that."</p>

<p>"Accomplishments!" said Tom, looking up from his book. "Do you
know, Philip, we actually saw an advertisement in one of the
papers recently, 'General servant would like to meet accomplished
Frenchman in evenings for mutual improvement in scientific
conversation.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," interposed Phoebe. "Only unfortunately for the
instance the advertisement was repeated and the first two words
then appeared as 'German savant.'"</p>

<p>"Worse things happen in Fleet Street," said Philip. "But I
don't know about your Gwendolin Maud having no accomplishments.
She came out into the garden the other day and entertained me for
half-an-hour with light and elegant conversation."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlett gave that ceiling-ward glance that is symbolic
of resignation.</p>

<p>"Her irrepressible friendliness is beyond everything," she
declared. "When anyone calls I really come down in a cold terror,
always imagining that I may find her sitting in the drawing-room
with them. What did she say?"'</p>

<p>"She asked me what time I thought it was, and when I was
taking out my watch she said quickly, 'Oh no; I know, but I want
you to guess.'"</p>

<p>"You only laugh, Tom," exclaimed his wife indignantly, which
was true enough, "but it really is quite too frightful."</p>

<p>"I guessed," continued Philip, displaying an obvious sympathy
towards Tom's standpoint, "and was some half-hour wrong. 'Yes,'
said Euphrosyne brightly, 'I thought that it was about that time
too. Isn't it coming dark soon?</p>

<p>"She saunters down the garden when Tom is doing anything, and
asks him the names of things," said Phoebe dolefully. "He won't
tell her to go away, and I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't either," retorted Tom. "You are afraid of hurting
her feelings."</p>

<p>"I confess that I don't quite know how to bring her to see
matters properly sometimes. You see, Flip, she is not an ordinary
trained girl, and I feel that I ought to make allowances and not
expect too much at first. She's an Unemployed, and a Problem, and
a Submerged Tenth, and so on. But don't let my thoughtless
prattle keep you from going to sleep, Flip!"</p>

<p>"Passionately interested," yawned Philip. "Your beautiful,
fresh, country air. Do go on."</p>

<p>"Tom, did you <i>ever</i> know him interested in any mortal
thing from an entomological specimen to a murder case?"</p>

<p>"Ought to have been a Buddhist monk," murmured Tom.</p>

<p>"It's the privilege of a weak heart," said Philip placidly. "I
have to lounge through life, physically and emotionally, by
doctors' orders. Yes, you were explaining why your Matilda Grace
does her hair differently at least three times a day when she has
so little of it to do."</p>

<p>"You have seen that! I never knew that you noticed anything,"
exclaimed his sister.</p>

<p>"A general delusion: hence my opportunities for noticing,"
replied Philip.</p>

<p>"I had her through Mrs. Barton," continued Phoebe, ignoring
the side issue. "She has a 'Settlement' in the East End, you
know, and does a frightful lot of good there among the most
extraordinary girls, I should imagine. They encourage them to go
into service instead of into mills and workshops. Mrs. Barton
heard that we were taking this cottage for a few months and wrote
me to try one of her girls. She said that she had some quite
presentable-looking, and that one by herself in a very small
house in the country would have a good chance of doing well. So I
went to look at them."</p>

<p>"Like going to the Dogs' Home, your registry offices, aren't
they?" said Philip. "They all sit round, don't they, and you go
in and have the little animals you fancy brought out and put
through their tricks."</p>

<p>"I think it has come to the mistresses being the little
animals and sitting round waiting for the servants to come and
have them, to hear them talk," suggested Mr. Bartlett.</p>

<p>"Well, I was really quite tired of going to ordinary registry
offices, and of having anaemic girls sent up from the country who
looked as if they had worked in a Shoreditch cellar all their
lives. Mrs. Barton said that hers were mostly rough girls who had
had no domestic training and had no clothes. And they all sat
round, as Philip says."</p>

<p>"Only even more so than he imagined, it seems," said that
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Uncommonly like an Eastern slave market&mdash;Royal Academy
style," remarked Tom.</p>

<p>"They had no proper clothes," continued Mrs. Bartlett
distantly, "so they could not go to registry offices or reply to
advertisements. When they get a place the 'Settlement' gives them
caps and aprons arid a few things, and you find them the
rest."</p>

<p>"Good business," commented Tom.</p>

<p>"Out of their wages, of course."</p>

<p>"Poor worms," murmured Philip.</p>

<p>"I really liked Marianna's face from the first, although her
get-up was quite frightful. She had very dilapidated
boots&mdash;her father's, I learned&mdash;an old torn straw hat,
and all her things like that. Her hair was half-way between long
and short and looked&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite frightful?" suggested Philip politely.</p>

<p>"Well, like a row of drowned rats' tails. Of course I expected
her to refer to 'lydies' and 'blokes,' and to say 'Strike me
pink!' and 'Garn!' and I was awfully surprised to find that she
spoke quite nicely. When I was talking to her it came out by
accident that she had not had anything to eat since breakfast on
the day before. In a great state I said, 'Oh, why ever didn't you
tell Mrs. Barton?' and off I rushed to find her. Imagine me when
she took it quite as a matter of course and said that probably
most of the girls had not had anything to eat since breakfast on
the day before! I went out there and then and bought Marianna a
bagful of buns, and she was awfully elegant about it and wouldn't
think of touching them while I was there. She said it would seem
strange eating without a plate. And all the time she was the most
draggle-tailed, starving little scarecrow imaginable."</p>

<p>"Wish she would have the same scruples about my Golden
Pippins," said Mr. Bartlett. "She sits under the tree scrunching
them up by the dozen."</p>

<p>"I think that was partly your own fault, dear," said his wife.
"If you remember, you asked her if she liked apples. I am sure
that she took it as a sort of general invitation."</p>

<p>"She may have taken it general invitation, but when I came
across her helping herself and said it, I meant it as a sort of
specific prohibition."</p>

<p>"Yes," soliloquised Philip, "I have heard that children,
savage tribes, the mentally deficient, and most women require
their sarcasm underlined with a club to catch the drift properly.
Possibly your Marianna comes within one or more of these
categories."</p>

<p>"Oh, then she had a reference," exclaimed Mrs. Bartlett,
reverting to the East End. "I wondered who on earth could have
employed a little ragamuffin like that, but I thought that I had
better see her. Marianna showed me the way; it was like going
through the Ghetto or the Jago or the Bowery or some of those
dreadful places one reads about. The house we went to was in
Cement Street&mdash;a Mrs. Plack. She told me that Marianna's
father and mother and sisters and brothers had all lodged in two
of her rooms for a long time till they got so much in debt for
their rent that she had to send them away. Then they went into
one room somewhere else, and Mrs. Plack let Marianna stay with
her because she did not like to go into the one room. She helped
with things about the house, and Mrs. Plack said that she was a
very nice willing girl, and she would have liked to keep her
herself only her husband, who had something to do with ships, had
been out of work for six months and was ill in bed with sciatica,
so that they could not afford it. She told me all about herself
and called her five children in for me to see. They stood in a
row and all recited little pieces that they had learned at
school, all except one who was deaf and dumb, and he showed me a
castle and cliffs that he had made out of bits of broken oyster-
shells. It was all most frightfully interesting and I gave them
threepenny-bits each, and they seemed so pleased and showed each
other their threepenny-bits all round, though of course they were
all alike. Mrs. Plack said that Cement Street was a very nice
street for those parts, and, although they were rather
unfortunate just then, that she was much better off than most of
the people around because she had rich relations&mdash;a brother,
I think, who kept a public-house. Before I left she showed me
three electro-plated serviette rings which she kept in a cupboard
to be ready when her rich relations came to see her. She had been
married fourteen years and they had not been yet, but, she said,
it was a satisfaction to have things nice in case they ever did
come."</p>

<p>It was some twenty-four hours later that the doings of
Marianna again moved Mrs. Bartlett's utterance, but this time in
a different key.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly too bad," she exclaimed, coming into the
little drawing-room where her husband was reading. "I have just
been into Marianna's room to see that she was keeping it tidy,
and I find that she has scribbled all over the wall with match-
ends and pencils. You know, Tom, it is a pretty, light blue
distemper and you can guess what it is like now. And here is a
nice book that I lent her to read: she has had the&mdash;well, it
isn't really impertinence because she simply doesn't know any
better, but on a blank page she has actually drawn a drunken
sailor trying to dance the hornpipe. That, of all things, in
<i>The Pleasures of Life</i>!</p>

<p>"Another Marianna evening?" said Philip with pleasant
resignation, coming in to hear the burden of his sister's woe.
"May I see the effort?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bartlett handed him the book without any comment. He was
smiling, but on the whole he looked much more puzzled than
amused. The drawing was that of a single figure: as Mrs. Bartlett
had said, that of a drunken sailor trying to dance a hornpipe,
and it produced this simple effect&mdash;that as one looked one
seemed to see not a drawing but a drunken sailor trying to dance
the hornpipe. Philip glanced and looked again. He was smiling
when he took the book: he still smiled and laughed quietly at the
humour of it, but behind it all, in face and attitude, there
seemed to be the arrest of intense surprise. He put down his
cigarette somewhere unconsciously&mdash;upon the rosewood piano,
as it chanced, but people who let their houses furnished are not
supposed to mind trifles such as that&mdash;with his eyes still
fixed upon the page.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Mr. Bartlett at length. He seemed to be
expecting something.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is funny, Flip?" asked his sister. "I
thought it rather good in its way; but frightfully rough, of
course."</p>

<p>"I think that one might safely go to the length of labelling
it funny," replied Philip, looking gravely from face to face,
"and even admitting it to be rather good in its way, as you say.
Now do you think, Phoebe, that we-might penetrate into the
maiden's chaste retreat to see to what extent she has damaged the
elegant blue groundwork of her bower?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Phoebe, leading the way. "But why have you two
become so serious all at once? I don't really mind about the
book, and I daresay that nothing will be said about the
room."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," declared Philip judicially. "I shouldn't wonder
if that room doesn't lead to quite a lot of talk before you hear
the last of it. As for the book, I don't mind taking it off your
hands at the published price myself."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Mrs. Bartlett somewhat impatiently, when they
had returned to the drawing-room, "aren't you going to say
something, Flip? You have succeeded in making me curious, and to
see you sitting there, smiling at a paper-knife, doesn't convey a
great deal."</p>

<p>"My dear child," replied Philip, still playing with the paper-
knife, "I am considering the kindest way to break it to you
gently. The fact is, that as a maid-servant I fear your Marianna
will turn out to be something of a white elephant."</p>

<p>"She is that already, in many things&mdash;dusting china, for
instance," admitted the lady candidly. "But do you mean to say
that the things she does are <i>really</i> good?"</p>

<p>"They are really good," said Philip deliberately. "They are so
marvellously, strikingly, incomprehensively good that if I had
not to repress any symptoms of enthusiasm by the doctor's orders
I should have to get up and walk about the room while I talked of
them."</p>

<p>"Does he know anything at all about it, Tom?" demanded
Phoebe.</p>

<p>"I have heard him described as one of the best judges of
black-and-white work in London," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"I suppose I don't understand it then," she said. "But none of
the things seem at all pretty to me, and they are so
unfinished."</p>

<p>Philip smiled broadly. "Well, don't complain," he said. "You
get plenty of the sort of art you like. Leave us our few
Mariannas."</p>

<p>"I don't quite see how it is going to turn out, though,"
remarked Phoebe thoughtfully. "Of course it is a great honour to
have a genius for a general servant, and to have 'discovered' her
ought to be frightfully exciting and all that. And I don't mind
losing her much, because scrubbing floors is the only work that
she can do really well; and who wants to have the floors scrubbed
in someone else's house? But&mdash;well, you know what she is
like. How will she go about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for that matter, wasn't Millie Myers fiddling at pit-
doors a few years ago, and Ben Corvelli singing as he blacked the
boots at a Bournemouth hotel?" interposed Mr. Bartlett.</p>

<p>"But I don't believe that Marianna has a scrap of ambition for
anything," declared her mistress. "If you start with the idea of
unbounded enthusiasm and heroic purpose on her part you are
probably laying up for yourself quite a store of shocks and
surprises. Mark my words and remember your poor heart, Flip."</p>

<p>Philip looked at his sister with deep but half-amused
interest.</p>

<p>"I am wondering how you will rise to the occasion, She-bee,"
he said presently. "You nave a fascinating experiment before
you..Here is a ragattee little creature with probably the heart
of a coster, a mind like a new slate, and inspired fingers. You
have the chance of a lifetime&mdash;a lifetime! of ten thousand
lifetimes, I should say. It's quite the sort of thing you read
about."</p>

<p>"I am quite content to let it remain the sort of thing I read
about, as far as I am concerned," retorted Mrs. Bartlett. "What
have I to do with it?"</p>

<p>"You? You have everything to do with it. You, and you alone,
can become Marianna's kind patroness. You&mdash;unobtrusively
assisted by Tom and myself&mdash;can take her firmly and
sympathetically in hand and educate her on her weak points."</p>

<p>"Oh, great goodness!" exclaimed the lady, aghast; "spare us,
Flip! I know a great deal more about Marianna's weak points than
you do, or are ever likely to. Send her to school, or to Paris,
or to Rome, if you like, but remember that if you have got a
heart I have got nerves."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of good," said Philip inexorably. "You know
perfectly well that she could not yet mix with educated people
who were strangers. This is probably the one chance of her
lifetime also. If she leaves you she is extinguished. You hold
the balance of her destiny whether you like it or not."</p>

<p>"I don't like it," she declared. "I am frightfully good-
natured, I know, but I do think that it is expecting too much. I
once knew a sort of amateur lady artist, and one used to meet
droves of long hairy things there who talked about nothing but
'wash,' and 'tone,' and 'value,' and seemed more or less
deficient in all three. Why can't Marianna sell her drawings if
they are so wonderful and then make a nice home for her father
and mother and disappear from our immediate horizon in a burst of
splendour?"</p>

<p>"Just because she could not do it," he replied; "any more than
you could engineer a 'corner' in Peruvian bark, for instance.
Then she ought to study hard for at least two years before she
'comes out,' so to speak. She has had no more experience than a
door-knocker. Everything she draws has passed down Cement Street.
Now she needs taking out to see other kinds of things."</p>

<p>"I think it would be simpler to adopt her straight off," said
Phoebe scornfully.</p>

<p>"I daresay that it would be a paying speculation, and would
certainly immortalise you."</p>

<p>"I should think myself fortunate if it did not imbecilise
me...Do you <i>really</i> want me to educate her, Fillipino,
dear?"</p>

<p>"I had visions," confessed Philip, "but I would rather that
she was walled up in Cement Street for ever than have you
worried."</p>

<p>"Don't be bullied into it by that tone of voice," warned her
husband. "Sleep on it, at any rate."</p>

<p>"No, I'll play on it," she declared. "Go into the garden,
please."</p>

<p>For half-an-hour "The Girl in the Chocolate Box" and "Hi,
there!" fought tinkling melodies in her soul in turn with Weber
and Beethoven, while her husband methodically pruned his tomato
plants and repeatedly urged his brother-in-law to take up the
study of aphides or diptera. Then, in the fading light, Philip
suddenly forgot to pace the walks; the hilarious voices of two
lovers in the road beyond sank to a whisper, then ceased;
Bartlett no longer pruned...</p>

<p>"So!" he exclaimed half-crossly, closing his knife and turning
his steps towards the house as the subdued paean died away. "You
have got it your own way again, of course."</p>

<p>Very easy times succeeded for Marianna. Phoebe, who detested
"daily women," got in a daily woman and Marianna's duties
lightened and imperceptibly changed. It was easy to requisition
her services to carry wraps; she was useful to take shopping; it
was inevitable that she should wear prettier things. Marianna saw
a great deal of the river that season; she witnessed a royal
wedding at Windsor, a military funeral at Guildford, and a day's
racing at Esher; she put in an appearance at an occasional
flower-show and cricket-match, and she began to know something of
the landmarks of the West End. To engage her leisure afternoons
and evenings a lavish supply of the finest drawing materials
waited at her elbow, while it became a general thing that
<i>Punch</i>, the art journals, several American magazines and a
few English ones were to be found on the kitchen dresser. The
daily woman, the recipient of Marianna's confidences, thought it
rather remarkable, but reflected that the proceedings ("goings-
on," in daily womanese) at furnished cottages here and there
during the river season lay outside the reasonable explanation of
daily women. To Marianna it did not seem in any way strange; she
accepted it as she had accepted semi-starvation and an occasional
thrashing in Canning Town, as part of the ordinary routine of the
situation; quite dog-like.</p>

<p>"I used to read from <i>Reynold's</i> to my father sometimes
on Sundays," she had once told Mrs. Bartlett; "and whenever I
came to a word that I didn't understand or couldn't pronounce I
had to 'Ahem!' instead." There was a great deal of "Ahem!" taking
place in Marianna's experience during this period.</p>

<p>Philip was not altogether satisfied. The ladies and gentlemen
of the artist's pencil were not the strong, frank creatures of
her earlier efforts. She did not understand them and she could
not interpret what she saw. In a time of fatness and ease the
vividness of impression was dulled; possibly the emotions, or
their expression, were more restrained in her new models. In
turning over her earlier sketches Philip had been struck by a
wild figure&mdash;a Chinaman rushing headlong down a gloomy slum,
a drawn knife in his hand and frenzied, murderous passion in his
eyes. Marianna explained it.</p>

<p>"It was the first time I ever saw one of those," she said. "I
was with another girl in the Dock Road when a lot of them came
by. 'They're all stone deaf,' said the other girl, 'through
firing big guns. That's why they all wear ropes down their backs;
you pull it when you want to stop one instead of calling out to
him, because that's no good. You try one and see. Go on; he'll
only grin and shake hands with you; they're all like that.' I
didn't know, of course, that it was a sort of game that was going
then&mdash;to get you to do it&mdash;until all the Chinks about
the Tidal Basin were nearly bar&mdash;I mean were frightfully
wild, so I pulled the pigtail of the nearest one pretty hard. The
other girl was gone like a flash and when the man jumped round at
me with an awful yell I nearly tumbled backwards among the stalls
there. I crawled through, but I saw him coming after me, so I
flew. I went up one street and down another, and then hearing him
getting nearer I dodged into a archway. He thought I was on in
front and passed me&mdash;like that. I always remembered
him."</p>

<p>The simple, vigorous studies which adorned her wall, framed in
a maze of futile pencillings and inchoate attempts to realise
some half-grasped idea, were generally 'like that'&mdash;memories
sharply stencilled by hunger, pain or fear. As Philip had said,
everything she drew had passed along Cement Street. Her women,
her grim, slatternly, unpleasant, lippy, wisp-haired, real-
looking women, hung round its doorposts; her children rolled in
its gutters or swung behind its dust-carts; her men&mdash;well,
she was not imaginative and so her men were either in the act of
working or the act of drinking. Phoebe picked out an
exception&mdash;a long-stretching queue of dejection marshalled
at the foot of a tall blank wall.</p>

<p>"That?" replied Marianna. "Oh, that's only the men waiting for
work at the docks. My father often stood there all day last
winter. I used to take him his dinner&mdash;when there happened
to be any&mdash;so that he should not lose his place. That's him,
the third from this end."</p>

<p>Phoebe turned away with a slight shudder. The "third from this
end" in the grip of a hard winter when work was scarce did not
present an attractive face.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of September, in the ordinary routine of
their migratory habits, the Bartletts turned their thoughts
towards more urban quarters. Marianna would probably be bound to
be in the way; possibly very much in the way; in scarcely any
contingency useful. Phoebe, however, was pledged to a policy of
"frightful good-nature," and as this vapidly-expressed quality
covered a sublimer heroism (after the manner of people who in
self-defence wear something imitation on their sleeves) than the
little slum-hearted gamin could ever rise to the height of
conceiving, the immediate future was not a matter for any concern
on Marianna's part. Nevertheless, she it was who, at this period,
airily and light-heartedly sprang a mine one morning that sent
Phoebe flying to the wire in despair, to send a message which
involved Philip in no slight perplexity.</p>

<p>"Everyone all right," she wailed from Sunbury to Strand West,
"but do come if you possibly conveniently can." and Philip
came.</p>

<p>"It's Marianna," said Phoebe, taking up her wail at closer
range. "I knew how frightfully disappointed you would be. She
wants to leave."</p>

<p>"Leave!" he exclaimed blankly. "Leave here? Leave&mdash;?" The
possibility had never occurred to him.</p>

<p>"She wants," continued Phoebe, with slow horror,
"<i>to&mdash;go&mdash;into&mdash;a&mdash;laundry</i>&mdash;at
Acton!"</p>

<p>"Go into a laundry! God in heaven! she's mad. Marianna," he
cried, striding into the kitchen, "why is this?"</p>

<p>Marianna stood by the table, engaged, after the manner of her
kind in moments of embarrassment, with a tightly-rolled
handkerchief. She looked distinctly mulish, nor, to drive home
the comparison, would she speak.</p>

<p>"She won't answer you," interpreted Phoebe. "She has become
sullen. She has made friends with a girl whom she met at Hampton
Court and she wants to go to the laundry to be with her."</p>

<p>"And the friend's brother?" suggested Philip with intuition.
"Is he also to be found at the laundry?"</p>

<p>Marianna shot a rapid glance and licked her lips.</p>

<p>"There is a brother," admitted Phoebe. "Possibly.</p>

<p>"But her art&mdash;her future&mdash;her career!"</p>

<p>"She does not think that there is anything much in drawing.
And in the laundry she will be able to do more as she wants, wear
what she likes, and go about the streets with her own friends.
You see, she is growing up."</p>

<p>"If she had stayed she would have been making hundreds, if not
tens of hundreds, a few years hence."</p>

<p>"She does not understand hundreds and tens of hundreds. They
convey nothing to her mind. All she wants is money to buy apples
and purple dresses with, from day to day and week to week...And
she informs me that she will get better wages there than I am
paying her here."</p>

<p>"When does she want to go?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, she says. Of course she could be kept for a month
really, but she knows nothing about giving proper notice."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Philip dispassionately; "then I should
let her go to-morrow."</p>

<p>She went the next day&mdash;to the laundry at Acton. She
became very sunny and pleasant when she understood that she would
be allowed to go, and in return nobody thought it worth while to
underline sentiments less amiable. The same day Philip burned a
portfolio of sketches. Excellent as they were, he felt that it is
necessary to be ordinarily human at times, and at least a
generation must elapse before one can entirely dis-associate the
art from the artist.</p>

<p>"I should certainly take up aphides, if I were you," remarked
Mr. Bartlett on his return.</p>

<p><i>Hampton Hill, 1905.</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. BOBBIE AND POETIC
JUSTICE</h2>

<p class="first">THEY arrived by the 6.15 train as Henry had
suggested&mdash;my brother Henry and his youngest son.
"Suggested" struck me as being a rather inappropriate word to use
for a visit at a bare day's notice, and the conventional phrase
"if quite convenient to you" has a tinge of gratuitous
insincerity when the letter containing it is delivered seven
minutes after their train has left Paddington. But that is Henry
all over. As a boy he was always anxious to share his broken toys
with me and to assume an equal interest in the contents of my
much better kept play-box. At school he was ready to take my part
through thick and thin, but in return he seemed to expect me to
throw myself unquestioningly on his side. On several occasions I
plainly recognised that he was in the wrong, and I had to tell
him so.</p>

<p>"I cannot conscientiously stick up for you in this," I would
say; "but I shall not actively oppose you, because you are my
brother."</p>

<p>There were periods of coldness between us, but no
quarrels.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, don't excite yourself about that; I can't help
being your brother," was his usual retort; but once, I remember,
the boy whose conduct I was actually approving took Henry's arm
and walked off with him, throwing the word "Sneak!" over his
shoulder. When, later in life, I came to my brother's assistance
to the extent of five hundred pounds, at a rate of interest that
was perfectly nominal in comparison with the risk involved, he
never showed&mdash;I don't want to misjudge him, but I certainly
never observed&mdash;by the subtlest shade of deference that the
action had struck him as in any way magnanimous.</p>

<p>I do not ignore the fact that it was chiefly through his
information and advice in the matter of the Great Glory Reefs
that I am now able to devote myself entirely to my private
pursuits, but if a balance of our whole lives was taken, I think
it would be found that Henry has come off very well indeed, and
although I should hesitate to call him ungrateful, he certainly
appears to take a good deal as a matter of course.</p>

<p>"I knew that you wouldn't mind rather short notice, old chap,"
he said at dinner (his extreme heartiness and display of
fraternal affection are becoming rather trying at our ages);
"and, as far as that goes, I did not know myself before
yesterday. Now, how long do you think that I can stay?"</p>

<p>"The week-end at the least," I replied, with as near an
approach to his own geniality as I could summon up. "Perhaps even
a whole week; but I know how busy you are."</p>

<p>"Eighteen hours," he said decidedly. "To-morrow; the twelve-
thirty. Now what do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"It seems hardly worth while coming for," I replied sincerely.
"Can't you possibly make it&mdash;say a full day? There is a very
good night train."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," he said, with quite a despondent air. "You
see, it would cut into the next morning. As you say, it does
hardly seem worth the journey, only I happened to have some
business at Bristol. If it had not been for that I expect I
should have sent Bobbie on alone."</p>

<p>"Bobbie?" I said, not catching his meaning. "Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he continued cheerfully; "there is no particular
hurry in his case, so I thought that I'd ask you to take him over
for a few weeks. Measles, you know."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed. "He has measles? Really,
Henry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," he interrupted with a smile; "only Florrie has.
Consequently Bobbie can't go to school, and we thought that he'd
be all the better out of the way."</p>

<p>"Out of your way?" I suggested, with perhaps just a shade of
emphasis.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed simply; "Mary's in particular. She has enough
to see to just now, dear woman.</p>

<p>"Oh," was all I said, but a moment later, feeling that
something more was required, I added, "So this is Bobbie. It must
be ten years since I saw him last. Now is he the Musical Prodigy
or the Artistic Genius?" Of course I really knew that Bobbie was
neither, but the remark came to my lips. All Henry's children are
wonderful, and the surprising fact is that they seem able to
convince other people of it besides their parents. I have given
up the <i>Trafalgar Magazine</i> because of the frequency with
which Vernon's drawings appeared in its pages, and any day if I
am foolish enough to look down the outside sheet of the
<i>Telegraph</i> I can be annoyed by seeing that Gertrude is
singing "At Camberwell," or "In the City"&mdash;wherever that may
exactly be. Bobbie was sure to be Something.</p>

<p>"No," replied Henry, "neither of those. He is the Scientific
Phenomenon and engages in obscure mysteries in the back-kitchen.
Chemistry, isn't it, Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father," replied the boy, but at the mere word
"chemistry" I saw him flush suddenly and pull nervously at his
collar, before he edged away behind a palm. The action was
Henry's to the life. I could see him then, flushing and pulling
at <i>his</i> collar thirty years ago at the casual mention of
our cousin Mary.</p>

<p>"Chemistry, eh, my fine fellow?" I said encouragingly. "Then
perhaps we shall be able to do one or two little experiments
together and make a Roscoe of you yet." I should explain that
chemistry&mdash;serious investigation I mean, of course, although
I descended to Bobbie's level for the occasion&mdash;is the work
to which I have devoted my life.</p>

<p>"Yes," said his father; "it's rather curious, now that I think
of it. He was called after you, Robert."</p>

<p>Evidently he was already classing us together! And called
after me; one knows what that means in the case of rich
uncles.</p>

<p>"Oh, I had forgotten," I replied ingenuously. "Robert Bar
ridge Troves?"</p>

<p>"No; only Robert," he admitted. "I was only referring to
that."</p>

<p>"Ah! not Barridge, I thought," I said conclusively.</p>

<p>So Bobbie was left on my hands for that delightfully
indefinite period referred to as "a few weeks."</p>

<p>"You won't find him a nuisance, I am sure," his father had
said on leaving. "He has a unique gift of effacing himself
completely; and I daresay that you can make him useful in your
laboratory." I daresay, but the idea of giving a young ruffian
the run of my most expensive instruments did not attract me. Why,
the maid servants are never allowed to pass inside the door, and
when the most careful Willet cleans the room up once a week it is
only under my immediate eye. Nevertheless, I took him up, and
standing with him by the door I pointed out the remarkable
convenience of all the arrangements and the many delicate and
costly instruments. Somewhat to my surprise he knew the names of
most of these, and even had a crude idea of their uses.</p>

<p>He was wonderfully like what Henry used to be at the same age,
as I discovered more and more; also, it struck me next, curiously
like some young animal&mdash;yes, an intelligent young dog. He
had a way of coming quite close to one's side and looking up to
see the expression as though it meant more than spoken words. He
stood like that now at the door of my laboratory, so near that he
pressed unconsciously against me until I moved away a little. As
I spoke he watched my face, the emotions changing his own as
openly as the clouds passing before the sun. It would not have
required a great effort to imagine him whining or pricking up his
ears, and when at last I turned to go he followed me like a
hungry but obedient animal slowly retiring from a butcher's
shop.</p>

<p>"Aren't I to be allowed in there, uncle, to do things?" he
asked in a low voice, a whisper indeed, when I had locked the
door, and as we walked away he took my hand&mdash;or, rather,
tried to take my hand&mdash;in his eagerness.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Bobbie," I replied very decidedly. "It is hardly the
place for little boys to amuse themselves in. Think of the things
I have shown you: the spectroscope and eudiometers, the air-
pumps, Crookes' different apparatuses, and the intricate
balances. A touch, a thoughtless frisk, and before you remember
where you are, pounds and pounds' worth of damage is done. Now if
I give you a little mercuric oxide and a test-tube, wouldn't you
like to make oxygen in the scullery and surprise Jane by burning
iron in it?"</p>

<p>I do not attempt to describe the look with which my young
nephew received this well-meant attempt on my part to enter into
his fancy for playing at chemistry, for I am sure that it would
be beyond the power of a pen usually devoted to the precise and
exact formulae of science. Perhaps had I then known that he had
taken a high South Kensington certificate for practical analysis
I might have framed the offer a little differently, but, after
all, these science and art diplomas are recognised even among
beginners as the brand of mediocre amateurism. I never thought it
worth while competing for one myself, nor do I imagine that that
eminent scientist and neighbour of mine, Sir Walter Bent, ever
sought the questionable distinction; certainly I never heard him
mention the fact ostentatiously if he had, in the way Bobbie has
done more than once.</p>

<p>"What's the good of making oxygen out of mercuric oxide?"
replied Bobbie, when, I suppose, he had looked at me as long as
he wanted. "Why, it's one of the very first experiments, uncle.
Don't you always feel that you want to find out things that have
never been done before? I know that I do."</p>

<p>This, as one may imagine, amused me considerably.</p>

<p>"Why, my lad," I replied tolerantly, "what is there to find
out? Nothing&mdash;practically nothing; certainly nothing that
you will ever do. Of course, from time to time there will
occasionally be some obscure discovery, but rest assured that on
broad lines the limit of knowledge is almost reached."</p>

<p>I ought to be able to speak definitely on this point, because,
as a matter of fact, until I recognised the futility of it, I had
wasted some valuable time in speculative experimenting
myself.</p>

<p>As far as his manner in general went, this nephew of mine was
studiously respectful after he had once understood that I would
have no childish affectation, but on this one subject I
charitably assume that he is not entirely responsible for the
nonsense that he talks.</p>

<p>"Nothing to be found out!" he cried vehemently. "Why, uncle,
there is everything yet. Nothing, nothing <i>has</i> been found
out compared with what there must be. And to be content not to
try is like&mdash;well, like a painter going on copying old
pictures all his life."</p>

<p>I reproved him quietly, for it was out of the question to
enter into an argument. Then I sent him to play in the garden,
and went back to my own work. I only mention the incident now to
show how immature and undisciplined his ideas were.</p>

<p>Some days later Bobbie approached me with a formal request. At
the bottom of the garden he had found a tool-house which no one
seemed to use, but it contained a bench and a fireplace, and was
fitted with gas and water. Could he have this place "to do as he
liked there?" I impressed on his young mind the fact that this
would be a considerable privilege by withholding my decision for
two days, and putting him on a rigorous trial during that period.
But I need hardly say that the prospect of removing him to the
bottom of the garden for the greater part of his visit was
equally attractive to me, so at the end of the two days, after
telling him that I was disappointed in him on the whole, I gave
him permission. Nay, more, having just restocked the shelves and
cupboards of my laboratory, I allowed him to carry away all the
superfluous acids and reagents, and an accumulation of faulty
test-tubes and other unserviceable glass.</p>

<p>I claim no particular merit in this; the liquids would
otherwise have gone down the sink and the glass into the dust-
cart, but the fact remains, and although I have never mentioned
the obligation before, it is obvious that if the boy had really
chanced to stumble upon any insignificant discovery (which I had
never for a moment been disposed to admit), no inconsiderable
share of the performance might be justly apportioned
elsewhere.</p>

<p>How he passed his time I cannot say, for I never had the
curiosity to enter the outhouse while he was there, and
immediately after his return to London I ordered Willet to throw
away everything that it contained, and to whitewash the place
thoroughly. If he had been so careless as to blow himself up or
to drink oxalic acid, I should have regarded the accident as
outside my responsibility after the confidence which his own
father had expressed. I saw very little of him except at
mealtimes, and I have since learned that when I was out he
persuaded the cook (this self-effacing boy who would never be a
nuisance) to let him smuggle down to the tool-house food not only
for himself but also to feed, at my expense, a youth of the
village whom he selected as an associate.</p>

<p>This person, Blithers by name, was the son of the local
chemist, and although I understand that at home he showed a
marked dislike for his father's business, he professed to become
so attracted to Bobbie's society that he willingly and even
enthusiastically accepted the position of honorary assistant in
the tool-house. This, at least, was the view presented by the
invaluable Willet in response to a hint on my part that he might
occasionally find it necessary to loiter about the door of the
shed and to look in at the windows as he passed, but one does not
go through life without learning to become sceptical of these
disinterested friendships, and the importance which a young
person in Blithers's position would receive among his ordinary
companions if he could claim a connection, however remote, with
"The Grange," supplies a much more reasonable explanation.</p>

<p>The incentive on Bobbie's part is even less creditable, for it
is now established beyond all doubt that the unhappy Blithers, in
order to ingratiate himself, pilfered (yes I am sorry that I am
unable to substitute a milder term, but that is the exact
expression)&mdash;<i>pilfered</i> from his father's stock small
but frequent supplies when their united pocket-money had become
exhausted. I am perfectly well aware that no criminal action is
being taken in the matter; that Blithers senior has been so weak-
minded as to declare publicly that for the first time in his life
he is proud of his son; and that a number of ridiculous
comparisons have been made to the tenacity of a Dalton, the
diffidence of a Cavendish, the fortuitous energy of a Priestley,
and so on, but the one reliable fact standing among a mass of
pretension and fulsome adulation is that this so-called new
mineral owes its isolation to <i>theft</i>, and all who
countenance its soi-disant "discoverer" are directly encouraging
a felony.</p>

<p>About this time I finished a series of investigations on which
I had been engaged in connection with our celebrated Campton
chalybeate spring. It is usually referred to here as
"celebrated," though I have never met any living soul ten miles
beyond the Campton market cross who had ever heard of it; and one
has to travel very little farther than that to find a majority
who have even heard of Campton. Yet it has been conclusively
proved that in similar circumstances the Campton water would be
equally efficacious as that of Contrexeville, and competent local
authorities have been unable to detect any inferiority in it to
the products of Spa, Schwalbach, or Pyrmont; while, coming nearer
home, it is frequently admitted that under capable development
Campton might reasonably aspire to usurp the position of
Harrogate as a health resort. In this labour, apart from the
fascination of verifying the results of previous analysts, I
confess that I had a second object.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of our distinguished resident, Sir
Walter Bent. I had long recognised the advantage which would lie
in being associated scientifically with this great man, and in
consequence I had frequently placed myself in such a position
that a meeting under the most favourable auspices might be
reasonably brought about. Unfortunately, Sir Walter did not enter
at all into the social life of the district, and his memory was
so bad, or his pre-occupation so great, that my discreet
advances, which the easy etiquette of the countryside permitted
on our chance encounters led to nothing.</p>

<p>On one occasion, for a period of a week, I spent every day,
beginning at a very early hour indeed, geologising in some
disused lime-pits a couple of miles outside the village on the
Cornwall road. From a monograph which he had recently contributed
to one of the reviews, I knew that Sir Walter was keenly
interested in the Devonian strata, so that when I heard in an
indirect way that he had spoken of spending that week working in
the Cornwall road, the deduction was a very natural one on my
part. The opportunity of being there before him and almost, as it
were, receiving him attracted me.</p>

<p>As I have said, I did actually carry out this idea, and
through a week of very unpleasant weather I resolutely held my
ground, although the early start, the conditions under which I
took my meals, and the uncongenial nature of the occupation (in
which I felt no real interest) tried my patience repeatedly. At
the end of the week as I passed the railway station on my way
home I discerned the object of all my amiable strategy alighting
from the London train. I then learned that he had been up in town
all the time, carrying on some research at the Natural History
Museum, and that his reference had in reality been to
<i>Cromwell</i> Road, which the artless Willet had either
misheard or simple-mindedly confused with the better-known local
highway.</p>

<p>I will not deny that this experience depressed me, and for the
next few months I retained a conviction that independent research
on my part would be the most beneficial to science in the end.
Then, however, it was reported that Sir Walter had been taking
the Campton water, and had derived some benefit from it; the
project for developing the property was again raised, and the
moment seemed an auspicious one for me to identify myself
prominently with the subject. Doubtless I had referred to the
work I had taken in hand to Henry in Bobbie's hearing, for during
the first few days the boy had been persistent in his usual
vein.</p>

<p>"Oh, uncle, you'll let me help you with the analysis, won't
you?" he had cried excitedly, as soon as his father had gone, and
even my reply that the work was of far too delicate a kind to be
entrusted in any detail to the rough-and-ready practice of a
school-boy did not repress him.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you have to be awfully careful about it," he
admitted frankly. "Never mind, uncle; perhaps I can be doing
something else while you are on that."</p>

<p>"You have to be very careful indeed," I said impressively.
"Sometimes it is necessary to make repeated tests for so minute a
quantity as a thousandth part of a grain&mdash;perhaps a mere
speck to the naked eye&mdash;in a gallon of water."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, nodding carelessly. "Jehnsen's gold test
reveals .0004 of a grain to the gallon."</p>

<p>I suppose these smatterings of general information are taught
nowadays in the lower forms as "Nature Study." I dislike the
system, and would have shown Bobbie how little real use a single
superficial fact like that was when he suddenly went off on
another line.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, uncle," he exclaimed, "do you expect to find
anything new in the Campton water? How spiffing if you do! What
shall you call it? <i>Have</i> you got anything yet?"</p>

<p>"My good nephew," I said, "it is necessary to use common-sense
in these matters, and I shall not even look for 'anything new,'
as you so crudely term it. Recollect that the water has been
minutely examined possibly a dozen or more times already."</p>

<p>"Then why do you want to do it again?" he demanded. "I see no
fun in that, if you're satisfied."</p>

<p>"One does not conduct delicate and protracted experiments for
fun," I replied. "The valuable corroboration of what has been
previously arrived at by others is in itself a worthy and
sufficient end, and the possibility of detecting a fractional
variation, in one of the constituents gives an added zest.</p>

<p>"Well," he persisted, "I suppose that the waters at Bath had
been analysed often enough before, but they found radium in them,
for all that."</p>

<p>I could not refrain from smiling at his simplicity.</p>

<p>"Suppose, Bobbie," I said, "assuming the frankly absurd, and
supposing that our spring did contain an unknown matter in
solution, how much do you think that there would be in a gallon
of water? The 'something new' would not be floating about in it
like a duck's egg, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, admitting that it would be so minute that no test could
detect it, and no microscope show it even if it could be
collected, it would only be a thousandth part of what you could
get from a thousand gallons," replied the foolish boy.
"<i>That</i> might be appreciable."</p>

<p>I have seen it stated somewhere recently that no one says,
"Pish!" or "Tush!" nowadays. It is a mistake; I said both to
close the conversation, and sending Bobbie down the garden I went
to my own work.</p>

<p>I was now composing the article embodying the results of my
examination. These, as I have indicated, I had never expected to
be startling, but they were painstaking and sound. I showed that
Perring, who last analysed the water, in 1879, had made a
miscalculation of an appreciable fraction of a grain in the
amount of sulphate of soda.</p>

<p>Dealing with the historical aspect of the spring, I pointed
out that as William of Orange must have passed within twenty
miles of Campton on his march from Torbay, there was nothing
extravagant in surmising that he might possibly have made an
unrecorded detour to enjoy its benefits. This point had never
been brought out before, but when the state of that monarch's
health is considered, the theory becomes more and more feasible,
and it has the advantage that if it came to be generally accepted
it would confer upon Campton the royal patronage which seems to
be essential to the popularity of any modern spa.</p>

<p>The article finished, I sent it to the local newspaper. I
confess that a more classical medium would have pleased me
better, but the pages of the "Transactions" of the various
Societies are not impartially open, nor are those who control
them amenable to social or commercial inducements. To the editor
of the newspaper I explained who I was, and delicately suggested
that I should probably require at least five dozen copies of the
issue containing the article. Needless to say it was inserted,
though not in the type which I myself would have chosen, nor in a
position suitable to its importance. Furthermore, some of the
typographical mistakes were appalling, especially in the matter
of figures. I trust that the unknown readers were intelligent and
discriminating, otherwise a too literal acceptance of the
analysis would convey the impression that a gallon of the water
contained three pounds of iron, half a hundredweight of lime, and
so forth. In my own copies I neatly corrected these glaring
absurdities, and then dispatched them by post to all the local
notabilities.</p>

<p>To Sir Walter Bent I took the precaution of sending three
marked copies. This was chiefly on account of his notorious
absent-mindedness, and to make it more certain of catching his
eye, I had one copy sent from London and another enclosed in a
blue envelope marked "Private." I state these facts openly. I, at
any rate, had nothing to fear from the fullest publicity. It has
been related to me in confidence that my action throughout has
furnished some amusement in certain quarters. Let it, I reply; it
is at least free from the taint of criminality; it has never
stooped to duplicity, belauded theft, nor compounded with felony.
I repeat: Let it. I am not troubled by the opinion of my
neighbours, I trust, and in any case it could not affect me, as I
have accepted an invitation to spend Christmas in London, and am
shutting up "The Grange" for some time.</p>

<p>The critical period, I have learned from Nature, is brief. The
astronomer follows the course of a star for days, it may be, to
note the phenomenon of a momentary contact; in a second the
culmination of a protracted experiment is reached and passed with
failure or success; after weeks of wavering the crisis of a fever
arrives, and then and there the thing is settled. Therefore,
having made my explanation, with no pretence of art but in a
spirit of absolute candour, I will hasten on to what ensued.</p>

<p>Sir Walter would have received the papers on Wednesday
morning. I hoped that Thursday would not pass without a sign of
interest on his part, but the hope was not untempered by a doubt
which rather loomed than lurked. However, on coming down to
breakfast on Thursday, I saw at once that there was only one
letter in my place, and with a thrill of expectation I recognised
the Bent crest. I opened it at once; it ran as follows:</p> <hr>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">"My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">"I have received your communication on the
subject of the Campton water, and read it with the greatest
attention. I do not doubt that your deductions are correct, and I
will submit the matter to a definite proof, as you suggest,
without delay. What you say incidentally about the disadvantage
under which you have carried out the work adds to my interest,
and I hope to have the pleasure of calling at 'The Grange' and
making your acquaintance at an early date.</p>

<p class="letter">"Yours truly,</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Walter Bent</span>."</p>

<p><br> At first I only glanced hurriedly down the lines,
experiencing an almost astonished satisfaction at the extent to
which I had&mdash;to use a term current, I believe, in financial
circles&mdash;"roped in" the great scientist. With a second and
closer reading, an element of indefinable doubt crept into my
mind. It is true that in the course of the article I had found it
necessary to refer to myself (though strictly in the third
person), and even to touch lightly on my qualifications, but I
could recall no expression indicating that I laboured under any
difficulties whatever; it is equally true that I had written of
Sir Walter himself in terms of graceful appreciation, but with no
suggestion that called for his allusion to definite proof. I was
beginning the letter for a third time when my nephew, who had
been in the room all the time, I suppose, although I had not
noticed him before, interrupted me.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, uncle," he said, "but as you seem puzzled, perhaps
that letter is not for you."</p>

<p>I laid it down on the table and looked at him in speech less
astonishment. Then I turned mechanically to the envelope.</p>

<p>"'Robert Troves, Esq., The Grange, Campton,'" I read aloud,
and looked at him again. What on earth could he mean?</p>

<p>"Robert Barridge Troves?" he inquired politely. For two or
three weeks the politeness of his tone whenever he has had
occasion to address me has been overwhelming.</p>

<p>"No, simply 'Robert Troves,'" I said. Still I guessed
nothing.</p>

<p>"Ah, not Barridge, I thought," he replied in the same
courteous tone, but with a gleam in his eye, and I was so
mystified at the time that it was not until several days later
that, reviewing the conversation, I longed to box his ears.</p>

<p>"This letter is from Sir Walter Bent, in reply to an article
which I have recently published," I said, looking from him to the
letter and back again at him in turn, for at the moment I could
do nothing else in my surprise.</p>

<p>"In that case I am sorry I spoke," said Bobbie, resuming his
breakfast. "Seeing that you appeared as though you could not
quite make it out, I thought that it might possibly be for
me."</p>

<p>He went on eating calmly, but I confess that I could not.</p>

<p>"Had you any reason to expect a communication from Sir
Walter?" I said, after a few minutes' silence.</p>

<p>"I thought that there might be," he replied. "I left some
things there the other day, and a letter about them."</p>

<p>I read the note through again, and I felt even less appetite
than before.</p>

<p>"Pray what were the things, Bobbie?" I asked, and my voice was
intended to convey a kindly interest in his pursuits, not mere
curiosity, still less anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh, some salts," he said, with obviously forced unconcern.
"We have been analysing the water here, and I rather imagined
that it contained a new element."</p>

<p>If the "celebrated" spring had suddenly discharged itself upon
my head, the feeling of cold dismay could scarcely have been more
intense. "A new element&mdash;in the chalybeate waters here!" I
gasped&mdash;I am afraid that I must use that expression. "A new
element, and <i>you</i> found it, and sent it to Sir Walter Bent,
and this is his reply to <i>you!</i> How&mdash;how did you do
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we just analysed it," said the hardened young ruffian,
affecting to appear bored. "Being there, of course we found
it."</p>

<p>Drowning men, one reads, see their whole past lives in a
flash. I was drowning, metaphorically, in the Camp-ton water;
certainly I was experiencing most of the actual sensations; and
for the next few minutes I enjoyed the mortification of a
kaleidoscopic view of my future life if only I had stood in my
nephew's shoes. A <i>new element</i>! Not merely undetected
before in the Campton spring, but new to science. What might have
been! I saw long vistas of platforms, myself enthroned on each;
unending crowds of black-coated men eagerly surrounding one
central figure&mdash;myself; interminable streams of professors
in academic robes; countless articles in journals of every
imaginable kind, from the airy, snappy, inaccurate "par" of the
halfpenny daily to the weighty essay of the quarterly&mdash;yes,
in those brief seconds I even <i>read</i> some of the opening
sentences; flocks of honorary degrees. And now that ever-to-be-
execrated treatise in the local sheet&mdash;placid, vacuous,
self-satisfied, with <i>this</i> on its heels&mdash;doomed to
involve me in unending ridicule. Why, why, in heaven's name, had
not <i>I</i> looked for some imperceptible, elusive, unisolated
atom of radioactive matter?</p>

<p>"I suppose that you did not care to tell me of it at the
time," I remarked; and upon my word I did not feel that I could
justly imply a reproach.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did mention it," replied Bobbie, "but I don't think
that you were interested."</p>

<p>He had! I remembered then that a few days before he had spoken
diffidently of "something" which he believed he had found in the
water. I was preoccupied at the moment, and if I gave the matter
a thought it was only to associate the "something" with a lead
soldier or an old shilling. I imagine that I told him not to
bother me but to run out and play.</p>

<p>Another train of possibilities flashed through my mind. If
only I had even then turned a sympathetic ear&mdash;an ear at
all, in fact&mdash;the sequel might have been very different. The
investigation would have been transferred to my laboratory;
Blithers would have been gradually dispensed with; I could, if
necessary, have become Bobbie's assistant; inevitably, after the
little joke had been kept up long enough, Bobbie would have seen
the propriety, in view of our ages, positions, and my unstinted
generosity, of...Again the long vistas of platforms, the crowds,
the articles...</p>

<p>"How much water did you evaporate?" I asked, coming back to
things as they were.</p>

<p>"A thousand gallons, uncle," replied Bobbie. Again history was
repeating itself. A thousand gallons! And all with my best
Silkstone, I suppose. Evidently another detail of Bobbie's
thoughtful self-effacement!</p>

<p>"Mostly in tin kettles," added Bobbie.</p>

<p>Yes! If this new element is to be paraded before the
scientific world, let it be known how it was obtained. Evaporated
in tin kettles, precipitated in the very crudest manner in faulty
test-tubes, sublimated in cracked flasks, fused on discarded
charcoal with home-made blow-pipes. Pounded, washed,
filtered&mdash;a hundred times, a thousand times; painfully,
toilsomely, tirelessly.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked. I could not walk away in dignity now
and ignore the thing; it had got past that. Nor could I now send
Bobbie to play in the garden.</p>

<p>"Chloride of <i>x</i> as yet," he replied. "Of course, it may
all be a mistake really. You see, I had no spectroscope; that is
why I sent to Sir Walter Bent."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can soon settle that," I exclaimed cheerfully. Why
should I not identify myself even at the eleventh hour? "Let us
go up to the laboratory."</p>

<p>Bobbie did not get up.</p>

<p>"Thank you, uncle," he said politely, "but I would rather not.
You see"&mdash;he paused a moment, then decided to go
on&mdash;"you see, a touch, a thoughtless frisk&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish and I turned to leave the room. I had
nothing to say. What was there for me to say? Simply nothing.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am a cad!" cried Bobbie suddenly, before I had reached
the door. "Do forgive me, uncle; please do."</p>

<p>"My dear lad--" I expostulated, looking back.</p>

<p>"I should like to tell you, uncle, please," he went on, a
little wildly for the self-contained youth of the last few weeks.
"When father came back from here, a year ago, he told us what a
splendid laboratory you had built, and as much as he could
remember about the things you had&mdash;everything that one could
possibly need, he said. I got him to tell me over and over again,
and for a year I longed and longed"&mdash;"and prayed," I think
he said, but his voice went very low&mdash;"to be able to come
here. I had the most wonderful dreams often of being here and
helping you in your work, surrounded by millions and millions of
bottles and all illuminated by thousands of bunsen-burners. I
thought that perhaps if you found that I could be useful and
careful you might let me stay&mdash;for a long time, I mean.
Well, suddenly I heard that I was to come, and I was wild with
it. Then&mdash;then, it was quite different, you know. I think it
was because I thought more of coming than of Florrie being
ill."</p>

<p>There were tears in his eyes&mdash;for Florrie I am sure. I
have said before that he was the Henry of old again, but as he
sat there in the uncertain light, shaken by this most un-Bobbie-
like outburst, by my soul it was the living Mary who faced me. I
think I have already declared that I have nothing to conceal
throughout. I may be an ass; doubtless I <i>am</i> a middle-aged,
solitary ass (which concerns that same cousin Mary), but I
certainly did not feel one at the moment. Yet without any
consideration of dignity, or any idea of what I should do next, I
strode back to the table and kissed Bobbie on the top of the
head. There was no need to consider what to do then, for after
one single startled glance Bobbie dropped his face upon his arms
among the breakfast-things and burst into a veritable storm of
sobs.</p>

<p>I went at once. My last impression of the scene was a glimpse
of Sir Walter's letter floating off the table on the crest of a
noble wave of coffee.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Sir Walter Bent came the next day and we
received him together. I said very little at all, which was
doubtless the inspiration for the great man to remark blandly to
me during a pause, "I hope, Mr. Troves, that you will excuse our
talking 'shop'&mdash;'shop,' too, of a kind which I have reason
to think is particularly trying to an outsider, but the
remarkable interest of your nephew's discovery&mdash;" He waved
his hand to indicate the rest.</p>

<p>"Oh!" chimed in Bobbie's clear voice, "my uncle isn't an
outsider, sir. He has the most clinking lab. that there ever
could be, and we have been there all the morning. If it hadn't
been for the things he gave me we shouldn't have been able to do
anything. He is the kindest man in the world, really. Except
father, of course," he added thoughtfully, and then, in sudden
confusion, "and&mdash;oh, I beg your pardon&mdash;perhaps
yourself, sir!"</p>

<p>I was thankful for the mighty roar of laughter from Sir Walter
as he disclaimed any chance in the competition. I felt the ass
then; but not the middle-aged solitary ass.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">There is a deaf old lady, a Miss Mitterdrop, who
lives in the village here. She hears nothing and talks
incessantly.</p>

<p>"They tell me," she said, stopping me in the street yesterday,
"that you used to make your nephew stand all day in a pit of cold
water at the bottom of your garden, and that he found a lot of
valuable minerals there.'" And she peered at me from under her
ancient bonnet like an inquisitorial fowl.</p>

<p>"Madam," I replied, as politely as one could, "the only pit at
the bottom of my garden is a melon pit."</p>

<p>She looked at me shrewdly and nodded twice.</p>

<p>"Yes, on the Day of Judgment," she said, and hobbled on.</p>

<p>I relate the trifling incident to show what I may expect. Of
the fantastic contortion of her next version of the affair and of
our conversation, the reader can form as accurate a forecast as I
can myself. To set the matter at rest I have therefore thought it
well to draw up this plain, unvarnished record.</p>

<p>I am again taking in the <i>Trafalgar Magazine</i>, and each
day I look down the front page of the <i>Telegraph</i> before
anything else. Relations, I conclude, supply one of the interests
in life, and in effect it is immaterial whether the pleasure is
obtained by enlarging their shortcomings and envying their
success or in sharing the success and ignoring the defects.</p>

<p>Vernon and Gertrude are coming to stay with me at Easter.
Bobbie and Florrie wait until the midsummer holidays, because
they can then stay longer. I think I have already mentioned that,
after Bobbie left, I had the tool-house cleared out and done up.
As it stood, the association was not altogether pleasant to me,
and I hit upon a splendid idea of turning it into a rabbit-house
and stocking it, as a surprise. I am rather afraid that my
nephew's enthusiasm will lead him to spend too much time indoors
unless I provide counter-attractions.</p>

<p>As I felt my judgment in boys' tastes to be unreliable I wrote
to Florrie in confidence and asked her advice. She suggests river
picnics, tennis parties, and a motorcar. I shall include these,
but I confess that I still have great faith in rabbits.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. THE HEART OF THE PAGAN</h2>

<p class="first">"AS a matter of fact," said young Holt, "I was
coming up to your place if I had not seen you. We are most
desperately short of men this harvest, and my father thought that
perhaps you could lend him one or two until you started cutting
your oats."</p>

<p>Andrew Garstang, senior, the burly, shrewd, independent yeoman
of Stonecroft Farm, leaning over one of his field gates, looked
at Andrew Garstang, junior, who stood in the road by his horse's
side. Both were amused so much that half a minute passed before
either made reply.</p>

<p>"Why, Harold," said the younger Andrew, "where do you think
I've been to get my horse in this state? Scouring the whole
countryside for five blessed hours trying to pick up a few tramps
or dead-beats to make shift with ourselves."</p>

<p>"And what have you done?" asked Harold with interest.</p>

<p>"Got hungry, that's all. And now I'm going up to have my tea.
You may as well come with us, Harold."</p>

<p>"I should much like to," said Harold, with every appearance of
sincerity, "but I must go somewhere else, if only to make a
decent show."</p>

<p>The two Garstangs had already turned away, when along the road
a strange and unfamiliar figure was seen approaching.</p>

<p>What outlandish kind of foreigner is that, now? demanded the
farmer, staring down the road.</p>

<p>"A gipsy?" suggested his son, as the stranger got nearer. "I
saw some of their vans down Sprostock way."</p>

<p>"Why, I do believe," exclaimed Harold suddenly, "it's an
infernal Chinee! What on earth can one of those reptiles be doing
in Overbury?"</p>

<p>It was a speculation that might well excite curiosity. Yen
Sung himself could have supplied a very meagre outline of his
journeyings, and even that he would have thought it prudent to
withhold in the face of every inducement, not including actual
torture. The beginning of the story would have gone back more
than a single year, and as far as the township of Lien Ning, on
the banks of the Pei-kiang. It would have exhibited a wide range
of Oriental nature and disclosed a little jealousy, some high-
handed official tyranny, bloodshed, a fixed belief in the virtue
of revenge and in the inexorable demands of the spirits of the
dead, more bloodshed, the insidious implication of the Triad
League, and the final outcome of a tribal feud. It involved Yen
Sung&mdash;whose interest in the original cause of the strife was
of the slightest&mdash;and by wave after wave of development it
finally cast him, under a new name and with a highly fictitious
account of himself, among his countrymen in Limehouse. His object
was to lose all association with the past, and doubtless he might
have succeeded had not another family matter requiring adjustment
(not in the remotest degree connected with Yen Sung) called for
the assassination of an amiable Shanghai merchant, in London on
business. The Chinese abroad have the strongest objection to
invoking the assistance of the police, possibly as a result of
their experience of the official classes at home, so that the
remains of the Shanghai gentleman were sent back to his family in
a crate bearing a label "Photographic Accessories. To be opened
only in a ruby light. Perishable," and went through in the most
correct manner. But, as the merchant was a person of some
importance, an informal tribune considered the case, and discreet
inquiries about the new-comer Yen Sung were set afoot with the
object of ascertaining whether he was sufficiently friendless to
be suffocated quietly and sent on in a second crate by the next
boat as a peace offering to the outraged relations at Shanghai. A
casual act of charity towards a poor countryman, on Yen Sung's
part, was the means of saving him. The decision of the committee
went against him, but before anything could be done a little
block of wood, shaped into the semblance of a miniature coffin
and bearing his own name, appeared miraculously in the fold of
his sleeve as he walked along the Causeway. Before the incident
took place Yen Sung's expression was that of a person who gazes
into futurity in a contemplation of the Confucian Analects.
Without varying a single line of his preoccupation, without
apparently withdrawing his eyes and mind from a sublime
engrossment in the Beyond, Yen Sung saw the symbol, read the
name, and perfectly understood the warning. He continued to
saunter on; presently he was out of the district which he knew,
but Confucius and the North-West appeared to draw him on. By
evening he had passed through Watford, and when night fell he
entered a wood and slept there. The next morning he resumed his
journey without a word of inquiry about the route, believing that
in a blind and unreasoning course lay his only hope. But, sparely
as he lived, the little money he had was soon exhausted, and he
found himself face to face with the necessity of seeking some
unfamiliar employment.</p>

<p>The three men stood curiously at the gate as he approached. A
foreigner might have been excused if, in search of authority, he
had addressed the dapper Harold or the man who bestrode a horse;
but it was the elder Garstang whom Yen Sung saluted with grave
courtesy.</p>

<p>"I seek one," he said, with an air of perfect self-possession,
"bearing the illustrious name Ga-tang. A wayfarer, following the
sun, spoke of the rider upon a horse who offered a just reward to
all who would labour in his fields."</p>

<p>Surprise held them for a moment, but it was plain beyond all
mistake that this strange being was offering his services as a
harvester.</p>

<p>"I don't think that it's work you would care about, unless
you've been used to it," said Garstang doubtfully, his
conservative ideas of the fixed order of things not quite at
ease.</p>

<p>"Try," replied Yen Sung laconically. "Not work honourably, not
pay honourably.</p>

<p>"I am giving half-a-crown a day, overtime, and bagging,"
remarked Garstang technically.</p>

<p>"It is sufficient," replied Yen Sung with the dignity of a
Mandarin of the Sapphire Button. Why should he admit to these
barbarians that he had not the remotest idea of what any of the
three inducements comprised?</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Garstang," interposed Harold, "surely you are not
going to engage him?</p>

<p>"Yea," replied Garstang, regarding the young man with his
shrewd, placid gaze. "May as well, Harold. We can't pick and
choose now.</p>

<p>"But just think what sort of a man you are bringing into the
neighbourhood, sir," urged Harold. "One of the most degraded race
on the face of the earth&mdash;a pagan and an idol
worshipper."</p>

<p>Garstang opened his eyes in gentle surprise. He was a staunch
Churchman, but it was not the custom&mdash;to state the case
mildly&mdash;to carry religious tests into the harvest-field.
Nor, unless innuendo missed its mark, did Holt, senior,
invariably regulate his business during the last six days of the
week by the sentiments to which he gave open profession on the
first.</p>

<p>"I mean," continued Harold, "that, being a heathen, he will
have no ideas of right and wrong. A friend who has been in
Australia tells me that they are the most treacherous,
bloodthirsty, and revengeful creatures in existence&mdash;more
like animals, in fact. I hope that you understand me, sir, when I
say that you are really taking very grave risks."</p>

<p>"They eat birds' nests, don't they?" remarked the younger
Andrew with a well-meaning effort to include himself in the
conversation.</p>

<p>"They eat anything that is filthy," said Harold, with elegant
disdain. "Rats and mice and cattle that have died of
disease."</p>

<p>So far this frank exposition of his national qualities had
been carried on within Yen Sung's hearing, despite the fact that
he could probably understand at least the essentials of every
sentence, although nothing animate could have more successfully
preserved an expression of absolute vacuity. But now Harold
stepped nearer to the Garstangs, and in spite of the contemptuous
intensity of his tone nothing could be heard of his words beyond
an occasional disconnected phrase: "...really too horrible
to...dozens of cases...and then murdered...rather commit
suicide...for Miss Edith's sake...You cannot warn..."</p>

<p>"What is that about 'Miss Edith'?"</p>

<p>The three men turned quickly at the voice. A very fair young
girl, not rustic, but wearing the grace and freedom that spring
from the English soil, had approached unseen by the field path
and stood smiling by the gate.</p>

<p>"The proverb has no terrors for you, Miss Edith," said Harold
with easy gallantry. "<i>You</i> need never fear hearing ill of
yourself."</p>

<p>"I was not listening," she replied; "but I did hear my
name."</p>

<p>"The simple fact," volunteered Harold lightly, "is that a very
undesirable alien wanted to be taken on for harvesting, and I was
endeavouring to persuade your father to harden his naturally
benevolent heart. Is her exacting ladyship satisfied?"</p>

<p>"But what have I to do with it?" she persisted.</p>

<p>"I was merely reminding your father of the many valuable
articles lying about which might excite the cupidity of a
covetous stranger."</p>

<p>She laughed, still unsatisfied; but another step brought her
to the gate, and then the patient figure of the awaiting
Celestial fell upon her surprised gaze and drove every other
thought from her mind. With a curiosity quite free from shyness
or alarm she approached Yen Sung with a friendly smile, as one
who seeks to make a strange guest feel more at home.</p>

<p>"Do you speak English?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Most imperfectly, honourable lady," he replied.</p>

<p>She started a little at the quaint form of address, but there
could be no doubting the perfect courtesy of Yen Sung's
manner.</p>

<p>"You have come a very long way," she continued. It was a
strange, new thing for her to stand face to face with this
queerly-clad wanderer. She would have liked to ask him many
things about his far-off home.</p>

<p>"A dead leaf is easily carried by the wind," replied Yen Sung,
who smiled also. It was a very faint smile, scarcely worth the
name, but it was the first sign of the lighter emotion he had
shown for many months.</p>

<p>"But you must have seen a great many wonderful places; and, of
course, to us your own country is the most wonderful of all." His
presence conjured up a thousand bright visions within her eager
mind&mdash;of sun-flashing, burnished temples and graceful
pagodas, rice fields greener than any English meadow in the
spring, palm-dotted deserts, forests of bamboo, and azalea-
covered hills; rivers and canals crowded with junks, sampans, and
motley craft; stockaded towns, their fantastic streets filled
with strange types or full of silent mystery beneath the moon.
Doubtless the picture was quite unreal, but it was none the less
fascinating, and the knowledge of it seemed all to be centred in
Yen Sung.</p>

<p>To her remark, however, he only bowed acquiescently. Limited
as his experience of English custom might be, he possessed both
the quick intuition and the keen observation of his race, and he
divined that the interest of this barbarian maiden would not be
to his immediate advantage.</p>

<p>"I think that you are possibly under a misapprehension, Miss
Garstang," suggested Harold, coming forward with an expression
that was a little awry in its smiling effort. "This fellow is not
an educated traveller who will be able to gratify your thirst for
information, but a common tramp asking your father to take him on
as a harvester&mdash;doubtless some seaman or stoker who has
deserted from his ship and now anxious to keep out of the
way."</p>

<p>"It must be very hard to be friendless in a foreign country
and to have to ask for work among strangers," observed Edith
sympathetically, pointedly addressing herself to Yen Sung; "but I
am sure that you will have no more trouble, because my father
never refuses work to anyone who really wants it. Then if you
like to come up to the farm you can have some tea." She nodded to
Harold quite graciously, reminded her father that it was nearly
six o'clock, and disappeared along the field path.</p>

<p>"Well, Harold, it's no use; we can't help ourselves, you see,"
declared Garstang with an air of amused resignation which only
half disguised an equally amused satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind," said Harold quickly; "only, knowing what I
do, I thought it was my duty to warn you. I suppose you have a
proverb applicable to the occasion, eh, Ah-John?"</p>

<p>"We have a saying, 'When the road bends we cannot see what
lies before us,'" admitted Yen Sung indifferently.</p>

<p>"A very safe assertion to make, too," replied Harold, turning
to resume his way; "but we can often guess, my pagan friend." He
smiled frequently to himself on the journey, but it was not a
pleasant smile, and a good many wayside flowers and overhanging
boughs were prematurely cut off by his vindictive cane.</p>

<p>The following day marked the opening of the oat harvest, and
Yen Sung took his place among the half-dozen men whose task
consisted in tying up the sheaves and throwing them aside out of
the path of the horses before the reaping machine made its round
again. Garstang initiated him into all that there was to learn in
the process&mdash;the peculiar knot by which the band is secured.
"You may find it to be a bit ockard at first, but you'll soon
pick it up," he remarked kindly; but with the fatal imitative
genius of his countrymen Yen Sung had already picked it up and
was reproducing the knot, even down to the minute and accidental
detail of a tuft of broken ends protruding at a certain point.
The farmer was turning away satisfied when a thought occurred to
him. "By the way," he added, taking out his wage-book, "I don't
think I have asked you your name yet."</p>

<p>"Claude!" replied Yen Sung with transparent simplicity. He had
noticed the name over a shop window as he passed through the
village, and he now adopted it as a pleasant little compliment to
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Any other?" asked the farmer, whose knowledge of the ways of
the Central Kingdom was not extensive.</p>

<p>"Of the obscure house of Kiu," replied Yen Sung for no
particular reason, and as Claude Kiu he remained in the annals of
Stonecroft Farm.</p>

<p>The days and weeks passed by; all the harvesting was over, but
Yen Sung still remained. Why, on his part, it might be hard to
say, for he had enough money now to take him safely out of the
country, and had he been a human being instead of a mere yellow
man it would have to be written that at Stonecroft Farm he
suffered much. The men early discovered that he never returned a
blow, so, to confess the shameful truth, to prove their manliness
or to impress their moral superiority, some frequently struck and
kicked him. Dead mice and other carrion were thrown into his food
as he ate, in exquisite drollery. Whenever Harold Holt visited
the farm he never failed to drop upon good ground a few light-
hearted suggestions for turning Yen Sung's eccentricities to
humorous account. Garstang rather liked the impassive pagan, but
there was much taking place that he could not see.</p>

<p>If he might be judged by his works, Yen Sung outshone all his
associates in the Christian virtues. To the blow on the right
cheek he turned the left; he was patient, industrious, long-
suffering; he bore the burdens of others. Only, it should be
recorded that in moments of solitude, especially after suffering
an indignity, Yen Sung sometimes took a very bright knife from
beneath his tunic and proceeded to whet it quietly and
systematically upon his leather belt, although it was always keen
enough to split a hair. This might have given some colour to
Harold's warning were it not that the Oriental mind remains an
insoluble riddle, and it would be as reasonable and more
charitable to assume that Yen Sung's formidable blade was
intended for no more desperate purpose than that of smoothing its
owner's chin. There is even a more amiable possibility, for one
morning about this time Edith Garstang found upon her plate at
the breakfast-table a little box of wood and inlaid straw, which
proved to contain a variety of figures carved with taste and
untiring skill in bone and fruit stones, and one or two in ivory.
There were mandarins in official robes; trees of gnarled,
fantastic growth; tigers, elephants and serpents; a wonderful
street scene, with stalls, merchants, beggars, a procession of
priests, and all the details of a busy thoroughfare; a child-
bride in her ornamental wedding-chair; and a number of fearsome
objects which could only be accounted for as evil demons, though
more probably in Yen Sung's mind they stood as the embodiment of
beneficent spirits. It was a collection which must have occupied
all his spare hours almost from the day of his arrival.</p>

<p>Edith was enchanted with the grace and delicacy of the pretty
things, but Garstang remained thoughtfully silent, and when the
story came to Harold's ears he vowed softly between smiling lips
that Yen Sung should presently suffer somewhat for his
presumption. The immediate settlement arrived at by Garstang was
to take the box in one hand and a sovereign in the other, and to
tell Yen Sung kindly but definitely that he must take back the
toys or be paid with the money. It furnished fresh proof of the
sordid nature of the Chinaman's instincts, for he took the coin
without a word of protest, and when alone cheerfully added it to
his secret store. Thenceforth he carved no more, occupying
himself with the composition of sundry notices in his own
tortuous language, which he afterwards fastened to the branches
of the largest trees, or to buildings, and even cast into the
streams. A local wit affected to regard these documents as Boxer
proclamations; in reality they were invocations addressed to the
tutelary spirit residing within the tree or building or stream
committing "the most honourable sun-haired maiden" to its
unceasing protection; recommending a benevolent interest in the
general affairs of the "large-bodied earth-tiller Ga-tang"; and
requesting as a personal favour to Yen Sung that the tree or
building would fall upon, or the stream engulf, "the rat-lipped
outcast whose polluted ancestral altar lies beyond the hill-
top."</p>

<p>The "most honourable maiden" herself was never without a smile
and a word of greeting for Yen Sung when she passed him at his
work. She cross-examined him out of his polite dissimulation on
the subject of food and obtained some small concessions to
provide a simple fare more suited to his tastes. His oblique eyes
took her up at the earliest possible point of vision, and, still
intent upon his work, he continued to watch her stealthily until
the last glimpse of her white dress was hidden from his sight;
but by no interest or encouragement could he be induced to cease
work during his working hours. Amused, half-piqued, and curious
to learn, she was driven to approach him at a more convenient
time, when, in the monotonous tone and passionless narration of
his race, he told her all she asked. About himself he lied
without the least consciousness of shame or ingratitude, painting
for her benefit a purely imaginary picture of his home, his life,
his kinspeople, and all that pertained to Yen Sung; but the
picture, though individually deceptive, was typically correct, so
that in time Edith Garstang in her remote English home began to
raise a little of the veil of the mysterious land and even to
find some slight foothold among the shifting complexities of the
Celestial mind.</p>

<p>It was a continual matter for self-reproach to her that she
did not bring about Yen Sung's conversion to a better faith; but,
with surprise, she found an increasing difficulty in urging her
own religion upon this courteous, high-minded pagan. She shrank
from the shameful justice of the reproach in case Yen Sung should
indicate the blasphemers, the Commandment-breakers, the thieves
and the persecutors by whom he was surrounded and ask in a voice
requiring no irony of tone, "Are these, too, Christians?"</p>

<p>In his own land Yen Sung burned joss-sticks to many deities,
including one, blind and inexorable, whom we might call Destiny.
Being at so great a distance from home, and therefore almost out
of the sphere of influence of these deities, he had perhaps grown
lax in his observances, or it may be that a supply of the proper
worshipping materials was not obtainable in Overbury. Whatever
the cause, this same Destiny determined to render Yen Sung a
sharp account of her presence, he having no powerful beneficent
deities to intervene, and the spirits of his ancestors presumably
being all engaged in China. The visible outcome was that on a raw
November afternoon two of the labourers returned to the house
assisting Yen Sung, who walked very uncertainly between them.</p>

<p>It then appeared that there had been a very unfortunate
accident. Six men in all were concerned, including Harold, who
had walked across the field on his way up to the house, and there
were five different and occasionally conflicting accounts, Yen
Sung himself contributing nothing. The five Stonecroft men had
been engaged in collecting, carting, and burning the dried
potato-tops when Harold appeared. Someone had playfully thrown a
potato (the accepted version), which Someone else caught and
returned. Then Someone threw another, and in a minute a game was
in progress, with all engaged except Yen Sung, who continued his
duty of replenishing the fires. Unfortunately, Someone threw the
potato in the direction of Yen Sung, and the Someone whose turn
it was to catch it, with no eyes except for the missile, had run
in and precipitated the unfortunate Chinaman into the heart of
the fire. Everyone was sorry.</p>

<p>There chanced to be a decent room over a loose-box empty at
that time, and here, on a pallet, Yen Sung was made as
comfortable as possible. Harold himself rode for a doctor, and
Everyone was much relieved to learn that although severely burned
here and there Yen Sung was in no danger of dying. With the cloud
of a possible inquest lifted a lighter vein prevailed. Harold
declared that they need not have worried, as it was impossible to
kill a Chinee&mdash;they all died natural deaths; and before
night it came to be agreed that it was Yen Sung's own fault and
the result of his persistent habit of getting into people's
way.</p>

<p>He made an ideal patient. He never complained, and seemed to
find no difficulty in remaining quiescent, bodily and mentally,
for days together. He accepted the doctor as "benevolently
intentioned," and did as he was told in spite of a little private
incredulity as to the efficacy of remedies applied without
incantations or even coloured lights.</p>

<p>Yen Sung celebrated the beginning of his third week in the
loft by sitting up for the first time.</p>

<p>"But on no account must he go out yet," reiterated the doctor
for the sixth time to Miss Garstang. "I sometimes wonder most
poignantly whether it's the sublimest philosophy or merely a
lacquered mask over absolute vacuity that the fellow wears. Does
he understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; only he is very patient," replied Edith, who
generally took the instructions. "I am sure he will do as you
say."</p>

<p>"Well, Kiu, my friend," he continued, turning again to Yen
Sung, "let the prosaic but sincere work of the barbarian
medicine-man sink into your retentive Oriental mind. Although you
are on the mend, you are for that reason to take all the more
care. Shun the insidious delight of potato-top burning or any
other outdoor exercise until I give you leave to stir. If you go
out and get cold or wet you will most certainly join the spirits
of your illustrious ancestors."</p>

<p>"It is as the all-seeing Buddha ordains," replied Yen Sung
imperturbably, but he quite accepted the warning.</p>

<p>Edith accompanied the doctor to the yard and then returned to
the loft.</p>

<p>"I am going to Overbury now," she remarked after she had made
up the fire and given a glance round the room. "Is there anything
that you would like; anything that I could get you?"</p>

<p>Yen Sung shook his head. There was nothing that he
required.</p>

<p>"I am going to buy my Christmas cards," she continued,
lingering. "You know what Christmas is, Kiu?"</p>

<p>"The Season of Much Gladness," replied Yen Sung from his
couch.</p>

<p>Two pitiful tears formed suddenly in Edith's eyes. "We say
'Peace on Earth and Goodwill to Men,'" she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Peace on Earth and Goodwill to Men," repeated the pagan.
Fifty years ago, he was remembering, his father's house had been
shelled to the ground by the navies of two most Christian nations
at this same season of "Peace on Earth and Goodwill to Men" in
order that equally Christian merchants might carry on a lucrative
trade in poison with a nation that did not want it.</p>

<p>"You have perhaps read some part of the little book I
brought&mdash;?" she asked timidly after a moment's pause. On a
table within his reach lay a copy of the New Testament.</p>

<p>"I have read somewhat of the words, honourable lady Edith," he
replied, his usual impassiveness cloaking any feeling he might
have either of interest or indifference.</p>

<p>She could venture no further. "I must go now," she announced,
glancing at the window. "It is coming dark already."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, very dark, even for a December afternoon, and
as she spoke a roll of distant thunder told the cause. Yen Sung
glanced through the window also, and into his face there came an
expression more indicative of emotion than anything he had yet
betrayed.</p>

<p>"If it be permitted me to speak unasked, might not the venture
of this journey be put off to a more auspicious day?" he said
earnestly. "Very soon the rain will descend in torrents, the
lightning will tear open the sky, and doubtful powers will then
be able to launch their thunderbolts even against the most
virtuous."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of the thunder and lightning," replied Edith
with a smile; "and as for the rain, see, I am well provided
against it."</p>

<p>"But the omen&mdash;even as you declared your purpose the
thunder spoke," he persisted. "Furthermore, by a most
unpropitious chain of events, the road you must take lies to the
north, while at this season the high heavens are situate directly
in the south." Suddenly a look almost of terror came into his
eyes. "Stay, most honourable," he gasped; "what day of your
twelfth moon do you call this?"</p>

<p>"It is the eleventh day of the twelfth month&mdash;our
December," she replied.</p>

<p>Yen Sung made a rapid calculation in his mind, converting the
date into its equivalent in his own system of time. Twice, three
times, he repeated the process in his anxiety, and then, as the
unevadable fact was driven home to him, he leaned forward in
trembling anxiety.</p>

<p>"You must not go forth to-day, lady Edith; you cannot go," he
whispered fearfully. "It is a day of the blackest omen and the
direst possibilities. It is the one day of an entire cycle of
years when all the diverging lines of evil, from whatever cause
arising, meet in one irresistible concentration. Demons, foul
dragons, and the malevolent shadows of all the unworthy dead are
abroad and supreme to-day, while the benevolent forces stand
powerless. So far back as last New Year's Day a special Imperial
edict went forth warning all that they should give no feast, go
on no journey, nor engage in any new enterprise upon this most
abandoned day. Even I, in the obscurity of this hidden chamber,
would not have ventured to leave my couch to-day had I not most
incapably forgotten. How then, shall you take a journey directly
away from the high heavens and after the portent of the
thunder?"</p>

<p>It was so real to him as he spoke&mdash;one who all his life
had walked with evil spirits on the one side and good spirits on
the other; surrounded by demons whose supposed prejudices had to
be conformed to in every action&mdash;that Edith listened half in
pity and half in despair. It would have seemed cruel to her to
leave him abruptly in his real distress. With an inspiration a
means occurred to her not only of reassuring him but even of
turning the incident to good account.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," she replied serenely, "for I carry a
safeguard against which no power of evil can prevail." A little
gold cross, plain save for the three initials which it bore, hung
by a slender chain about her neck. She touched it as she
spoke.</p>

<p>Here was something that Yen Sung could fully understand; it
appealed, naturally and convincingly, to one whose religion was
steeped in idolatry, witchcraft and geomancy. Suspended about
<i>his</i> neck there also hung a powerful charm, a square of
parchment inscribed with mystic characters, drawn out by one of
the most successful necromancers of the age. It was an infallible
specific against leprosy and shipwreck, and, in token, Yen Sung
had never contracted leprosy or been shipwrecked. If only he had
provided himself with a similar protection against the perils of
fire he would certainly have escaped his present plight; but one
cannot foresee everything. A charm of universal potency excited
his wonder and admiration. It did not occur to him that Edith
might not be speaking quite literally&mdash;that her geometrical
device was a symbol more efficacious when carried in the heart
than when worn among the garments.</p>

<p>"Is there, indeed, no possible contingency against which this
talisman might fail?" he asked, scarcely yet fully reassured.</p>

<p>"If I believe in its power and wear it faithfully there is
nothing in the whole world that can harm me. Are you not
satisfied, Kiu?"</p>

<p>"Your lips are incapable of guile, nor can alloy pass for gold
before the touch of a pure heart," replied Yen Sung.</p>

<p>He watched her cross the yard; he marked the clang of the iron
gate as she turned into the narrow lane beyond; then for five
minutes he sat motionless&mdash;so unbreathingly still that not
one of the grotesque idols in his far-off ancestral temple could
have seemed more devoid of being.</p>

<p>A vivid flash of lightning recalled him from his thoughts and
lit up the room with an electric brilliance for one moment. It
brought out every detail as the sun had never done, and picked up
in that short second, and seemed to fling it back to meet Yen's
staring eyes, one bright object lying by the door. Then
darkness.</p>

<p>In the overwhelming shock of the discovery Yen Sung's mind was
momentarily eclipsed by a blow that stunned&mdash;a feeling of
irreparable disaster that closed round his heart like a grasp of
ice. He shook himself free, and, falling upon hands and knees,
swiftly sought the spot. The half-light had returned after the
darkness, sufficient, with face bent to the floor, for him to
verify the worst. The little magic talisman that the most
gracious lady Edith had wholly and implicitly relied upon to
guard her on her perilous way lay beneath his eyes. And she had
gone!</p>

<p>His mind, freed from its numbness, leapt now. She had gone
forth, unconscious of her loss, into that most evil day when the
unrestrained powers of darkness, loose from ten thousand
unchained hells, would surround her in every form. She had gone
out heralded by the most ill-destined omen from the skies. She
had gone where her very direction cut her off from the slenderest
possibility of relief.</p>

<p>At all cost she must be overtaken and the safeguard restored
to her at once. Every second was precious, every step she took
full of danger. He had no means of communicating with the house;
the yard beneath his window was deserted. In spite of the
honourable doctor's warning, Yen Sung himself must set in motion
the means for her deliverance.</p>

<p>He moved quickly, feverishly, but with due caution, or he
might utterly defeat his end; for who could say but that his
unworthy touch might destroy the virtue of the charm or immediate
death be the fruit of his presumption? A half-burned twig lay on
his hearth; deftly, in spite of his bandaged hands, Yen Sung
wound the chain about it; then, as fast as his weak limbs would
carry him, he sought the house.</p>

<p>"See!" he exclaimed, bursting into the great kitchen where
Edith's mother chanced to be engaged alone; "the fair one of your
house has gone forth on a most perilous journey and the charm
upon which she alone relied for protection has escaped her
unperceived. Let a speedy messenger be sent before harm reaches
her."</p>

<p>"Whatever are you doing out on a day like this?" exclaimed
Mrs. Garstang without paying any attention to his excited words.
She was a woman of sound practical common-sense, and had found it
simpler in her dealings with Yen Sung to regard him as quite
irresponsible. "After what the doctor said, too! Go back this
very minute."</p>

<p>"But the charm?" he protested blankly. "The safeguard upon
which the most kind of heart depends?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Edith's little cross?" she said without concern, noticing
it for the first time. "Yes, I'll give it to her when she comes
back. Now, do make haste, Kiu. Here, I'd better get Andrew to
you."</p>

<p>She left the kitchen to call her husband, and in the impotence
of his position a despair more hideous than before fell on Yen
Sung.</p>

<p>Blind! Mad! He knew they were not cruel; some fatal obliquity
of vision hid his view from them, their view from him; but was
the gentlest and fairest to be sacrificed? He remembered the tone
in which she had spoken of the power of the charm&mdash;the soft
touch by which she had assured herself that it hung about her
neck, and something that was the nearest to a sob that he had
ever know strangled his breath.</p>

<p>Twenty seconds later, from a bank behind the buildings, Yen
Sung dropped stealthily into the narrow lane and began to run.
One possible hope had flashed across his mind. In following the
road to Overbury Edith would have to make a detour of half a mile
in order to cross the River Aish by the bridge at Rockford; there
was, indeed, no other way. By taking to the fields, wading the
Aish, and striking the high-road at its nearest point, Yen Sung
hoped just to intercept her.</p>

<p>He was under no delusion. To the plain warning of the doctor
he added&mdash;or perhaps took them as intermingling in the
scheme of destiny&mdash;the supernatural terrors of the day, and
with dispassionate fatalism he bowed acquiescently. The extent of
his hopes was that he might be permitted to reach his revered one
before the vengeance of the furies caught him or his earthly
powers failed. Under ordinary conditions the race was not a
hopeless one&mdash;three fields, the river, and, beyond, a strip
of meadow, lay between him and the high-road; but his heroic
heart was chained to a slight and crippled frame. Already the
rain, now descending in torrents, had soaked him to the skin and
the sodden clay of the ploughed land hung in great clods about
his feet. He beat his way through the hedges, but the thorns and
brambles tore him through his thin clothes as though with hooks,
and very soon he found with dismay that he could only stumble
blindly forward with half-bent knees. All his life he had
believed in demons, and now to justify his faith, they came in
their legions to mock and thwart him. Some drove barbs into every
tingling joint, tore his unhealed burns with their talons, or
turned the beating rain that fell upon his face into alternate
ice and fire. Others, riding on the wind like drifts of smoke,
surrounded him in their endless circlings shrieking in his ears
as they swept by. They made the earth heavy in his path, directed
the rain into a denser volume where he was, knit the brambles
together before him at each hedge, and impeded him in every way
to an unending accompaniment of swirling, shrieking, riotous
devilry. There were earth spirits, wind spirits, water spirits,
fire spirits, and the outcast band. The accusing shadows of his
ancestors walked by his side, desirous of arguing with him on
many subjects, while the Great Dragon, floating above all, wrote
unmoved with an iron pen upon a marble slate.</p>

<p>At the last hedge before the river he was blinded for the
moment by a branch which slipped from his feeble grasp, and
groping through he fell into a deep and thorny ditch. The myriads
of spirits shrieked their mirth, and in his half-stunned
confusion Yen Sung began painfully to climb back again up to the
hedge through which he had just come. A little precious time was
lost before he discovered his mistake and the fall had crippled
him still further. The most gallant effort he could now call up
was nothing but a shambling walk.</p>

<p>He reached the river, and would have stepped in, when the
chain slipped from the twig upon which he had so far carried it,
and fell into the grass. A few more steps and it would have been
lost beneath the muddy waters of the Aish. At the cost of another
delay he broke a willow branch and with a thread of linen from
his hand he tied the cross to the thin end of the wand. Then
using the butt to feel his way among the rock-strewn icy water,
he stumbled to the other bank.</p>

<p>There was nothing now but the narrow strip of meadow, beyond
which the highway marked his goal. Had his "high deities"
determined to be kind? Perhaps; for suddenly the heavens opened
above his head, the leaping flame caught the glittering emblem
which he held aloft, and, without the knowledge of a
failure&mdash;grotesque but for its climax&mdash;to mock his
eyes, Yen Sung sank straightway to the ground and reached a
farther goal.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">There is very little to add to the story of his
end.</p>

<p>The effect of lightning upon the object which it strikes is
curious and diverse. Yen Sung supplied another instance of this
purely scientific phenomenon, for when his body came to be
unrobed, those who stood by were startled for the moment to see
the perfect outline of a cross charged with three letters
impressed with unmistakable clearness upon his breast.</p>

<p>At first it was intended that he should be buried in a
secluded corner of the old churchyard at Overbury; but to many
influential parishioners the thought of a pagan finding a
resting-place within their hallowed "God's Acre" was repugnant.
In the end a site deemed more suitable was found in a
neighbouring cemetery, where he sleeps in an unconsecrated plot
set apart for suicides and the unbaptised.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII. ONCE IN A BLUE MOON</h2>

<p class="first">WITH the briefest of introductions, inasmuch as
my part is only that of a listener and recorder, I may say that I
had left Tor ford early one morning with the intention of walking
some twenty miles and striking the railway again at Ashbridge.
Provided with flask and sandwich box and trusting rather to the
compass than to the roads, I was reconciled to the possibility of
not meeting a human being from morning till night, but a
darkening of the sky before the afternoon was far advanced warned
me that I should soon be compelled to find a shelter or be
drenched to the skin. Of stunted trees there was no scarcity,
indeed, but the vivid flashes of lightning which now followed one
another with an ever-diminishing interval dashed the thought of
seeking such questionable protection. In despair I ran to the top
of a small knoll near at hand, expecting at the best to discover
a solitary cottage or a cowshed at no great distance. To my
relief from this eminence I saw lying almost at my feet a tiny
moorland hamlet nestling in a little valley and further concealed
by its girdling fringe of oaks. The first house was an inn: I saw
its swinging sign and stayed to see no more, for the next moment
the deluge came and in the slashing pelt of the rain every
vestige of the landscape melted out. I scrambled down the steep
decline, took the lane in a few long bounds, and flung myself
breathless into the welcome shelter of the nearest room.</p>

<p>Sudden thunderstorms may be classed among the
misfortunes&mdash;if misfortune it be&mdash;that bring us strange
companions. The room in which I found myself, for the outer door
opened directly upon it, was apparently the only public apartment
which the inn possessed, and as the inn was in turn the only one
for miles around, the storm had indiscriminately swept into the
limit of a few square yards a chance company which under more
ordinary conditions would have been striking in its
diversity.</p>

<p>On a bench which extended along one side of the room sat three
aged rustics, all wearing the stout and fancifully embroidered
smockfrock of the old-time peasant. In his left hand each held a
staff upon which he leaned forward: a quart mug of cider occupied
each right hand. Their names, I soon learned, were Richard, John
and Jasper, but they called one another Urchid, Jan, and Jaffer.
The only other occupant of the bench was a youth of studious,
melancholy expression and neglected attire. In a city he might
have passed at sight as an unsuccessful poet or an out-of-work
valet grown slovenly in despair. Actually, he proved to be a
harmless enough creature&mdash;the village idiot in fact.</p>

<p>I must also anticipate to describe the other occupants of the
room. At a point farthest from the door sat an escaped convict,
between two warders who had recaptured him on the moor half an
hour previously. From a chair near the window an itinerant
photographer regarded the weather gloomily. The inn-keeper,
standing behind his bar, regarded the weather cheerfully; while
two sportsmen who carried the accessories of a fishing expedition
completed the tale. The face of one struck me from the first
glance with elusive familiarity, but it was not until I heard him
addressed by the other that I recognised the well-known
democratic peer, Lord Twaddlemuch. His companion, who rode his
chair at an uneasy angle, proved to be an American millionaire, a
gentleman known in his native land as the Tinned-rabbit King, I
believe.</p>

<p>"To continue the analogy," the nobleman was saying as I
entered, or rather he had said that much, but with the true
platform instinct he obligingly repeated the remark for my
edification, "To continue the analogy, the various kinds of fish
which we pursue furnish exact parallels to the various
temperaments into which Mr. Mollentrave, for instance, would
classify women."</p>

<p>"Including the kinds of fish that pursue us, Earl?" observed
the American millionaire, who did not appear to be treating the
subject seriously. I knew him to be an American at once by the
painstaking purity of his English accent.</p>

<p>"Urchid," said one of the rustics, delivering himself with an
air of natural placidity that one would look for in an Alderney
cow if it acquired the faculty of speech, "pass they gen'l'men
thickey li'lle barr'l."</p>

<p>Thus instructed, Richard took from a shelf a miniature model
of the ordinary hogshead, a felicitous utensil in which the farm
labourer carries his day's allowance of cider. On it was neatly
painted the following inscription:</p> <br>

<p class="sign">FRATERNITY OF THE ELEVEN STREAMS</p>

<p class="quote">In order to promote harmonious social
intercourse, diminish envy, and eradicate a fruitful source of
contentious exaggeration, know all men that a fine of one penny
is imposed upon any person who shall introduce into his
conversation the word "fish" in any connection whatever within
any place of public entertainment throughout the above limits; or
who shall directly or indirectly refer to any aquatic creature
coming within such designation, or who shall by sign,
illustration, spring-balance, yard measure, word, gesture,
allegory, display of printed or written matter, or innuendo,
convey such a reference or simulate a colourable imitation
thereof; or who shall relate, cause to be related, or in any way
publish, diffuse, or circulate any piscatory adventure,
experience, incident, dream or prophecy or who shall attain such
an end by any means not specifically expressed.</p> <br>

<p>"The proceeds, I observe," remarked the American millionaire,
reading on, "are to be devoted to improving the quality of native
cider, by creating a larger demand. An interesting survival: take
for two," and he dropped a half-crown into the barrel.</p>

<p>"With all deference to your ingenious classification, sir,"
remarked the itinerant photographer, turning to the earl, "my
professional experience ranges me on the side of the aphorist who
contended that a woman could be fitly compared to no other
created thing&mdash;except any other woman."</p>

<p>"A similar remark might be applied with even greater accuracy
to a Manx cat." It was the escaped convict who spoke.</p>

<p>"True," admitted the itinerant photographer: "the inference
holds. Scratch the Woman and you find the Other Woman."</p>

<p>"Iv ee a-scradch my ode ooman," remarked Jasper thoughtfully,
"'twadn't be no huther ode ooman yeu would find but thickey same
ode ooman&mdash;her what hat man auver drexil only two dree days
ago."</p>

<p>"Hat man over drexil?" murmured the American millionaire to
the room at large.</p>

<p>"Precipitated the speaker over his own doorstep," explained
the village idiot courteously. "The 'man' is practically the
equivalent of the colloquial 'one'; as you might say, 'It really
takes one's breath away,' meaning, 'It really takes my breath
away.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied the American millionaire.</p>

<p>"It really does."</p>

<p>The escaped convict laughed softly to himself. "Excuse me,
gentlemen," he said, looking up, "but I was reminded of an
incident connected with a woman and a dialect that struck me as
being amusing at the time. Well, well, twenty years ago! How time
flies&mdash;some time!"</p>

<p>"It is still raining," remarked his lordship. "Perhaps you
would gratify our curiosity by relating the story."</p>

<p>"Story&mdash;hardly," apologised the escaped convict. "The
merest outline of an incident; the gossamer cobweb of a memory.
The heroine was called Amao."</p>

<p>"Christian or surname, might I inquire?" interposed the
American millionaire. "Or perhaps a daisy play-name of your
own?"</p>

<p>"Christian name and surname and all her name," replied the
escaped convict severely. "That is, if a poor creature who was
not a Christian and who probably had no recognisable sire could
have either. As a matter of fact, with the exception of a
delicate confection of nutmegs and sharks' teeth it was all in
the world that she did have. She was a Polynesian and I found her
in Jim Hartleigh's hut on Oahai shore. They told me that there
was a white man down with the fever, and putting professional
etiquette aside in the sacred cause of humanity (for I hadn't
been really sent for), I went. There I found old
Hartleigh&mdash;once something else of the Guards bad, very bad,
indeed. He knew me and lifted an eyelid and tried to wave a
fraternal fin, but only got as far as a shiver. Well, I fixed him
up and dosed him and then looked round. 'Now we must get him to
drop off to sleep,' I said in native to Amao, hoping that she
would take the hint and go, for she dressed so loudly, what there
was of it, that I didn't like to see her about the place. As I
said, I had hoped that she would clear out, but I was surprised
to see how tactfully she took it at once. She looked pensively
doubtful for half a moment as though wondering whether it was
quite right, then smiled acquiescently and picked up a war club
to depart. That was my mistake. This was hers: the language in
that island is very limited and one word has necessarily to carry
several meanings. Thus 'sleep' is the same as 'insensibility,'
both really meaning 'half-dead,' and the verb 'to
drop'&mdash;their verbs have no conjugation, nothing beyond the
bare outline&mdash;is 'to drop' in all cases: 'to sink,' 'to
fall,' 'to fell,' 'to pole-axe,' and so on. You see what
happened? Amao, who really was passionately devoted to Jim,
actually thought that I said, 'Now we must knock him insensible,'
and having a blind faith in my medicineman-ship, and coming of a
race which leans towards drastic remedies, she straightened
herself up and did it as neatly as an arch-druid might have done
before I could raise a finger. You see, very simple and very
natural, but it just shows."</p>

<p>"And Jim Hartleigh?" inquired one. "Did he die?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the escaped convict blandly; "he did not.
He remained insensible for thirty-six hours and then got up
perfectly recovered and married Amao&mdash;Polynesian rites, of
course, but very swell affair. I danced for three days, wearing a
rope of lotus blossom sixteen yards long. Well, well: what blind
gropers we men of science are in the stupendous laboratory of
Nature's infinite possibilities."</p>

<p>"'Tes wonnerful beyond all imagining the power of language he
du have," remarked Jan.</p>

<p>"Ev there be one word 'n dree understandable to us common
fellows it be as much," agreed Jaffer.</p>

<p>"Fvine," assented Urchid, sucking contentedly at his pipe and
speaking with the air of a connoisseur.</p>

<p>"It's a fact," said the itinerant photographer reminiscently,
"that the exact end-up with which an idea will appeal to a woman
is not worth speculating about. On some subjects they have no
focal length, so to speak. In my native town there was a
prepossessing young lady of seventeen called Irene Violet Maud
who suffered extraordinarily from dyspepsia. Her mother took her
to a doctor who talked to her all about the subject, explained to
her what to do and what not to do, and told her as a particular
thing to rest awhile and take it easy after every meal. Now Irene
knew that she had indigestion badly and knew that she felt better
if she did as he had told her, but because the man had red
whiskers and she had wanted to be taken to a certain doctor with
a black silky moustache and liquid eyes, she made a point of
running briskly up and down three flights of stairs seven times
without stopping after breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner and supper.
In consequence she's a bit of an apparition now, but when a
friend reminded her of those skittish times recently, Irene said
that it served Mr. Red Whiskers very well right and she would do
it again if there was any occasion."</p>

<p>"Your country has produced some remarkable types, sir,"
suggested one of the prison warders agreeably, turning to the
Tinned-rabbit King.</p>

<p>"Red Indians and&mdash;well, buffaloes one used to hear talk
of," volunteered the second prison warder with conscious
diffidence.</p>

<p>"Why certainly, sir, we have our share," admitted the American
millionaire with bluff good-humour. "As far as that goes, there
was my own aunt Janet now, as resourceful, matter-of-fact kind of
woman, who would shoot a horse-thief in the morning, darn her
father's socks in the afternoon, and be the belle of the ball in
the evening, as you would meet anywhere. I'm speaking of the
'forties now, when she and my grandfather lived in a bit of
roughish country down Arizona way. However things had happened
Janet had always found that she could make them straight and
tidy, until John Baxter Green began to court her. It wasn't that
she had any objection to Baxter; quite the opposite, in fact, but
the young man was so eternally shy and mistrustful that no amount
of encouragement seemed to help him along. At the end of six
months, after seeing her every other day on an average, he once
ventured to press her hand after bringing her home from a camp
meeting, but he got so scared at his boldness that he stayed away
from chapel for the next two Sundays. In the second year of their
acquaintanceship he accidentally let a 'Janie' slip out and she
never caught sight of him for a whole week in consequence. There
was no reason on either side why they should not make up and get
married within a month, but Janet was mortal sure that if ever he
got so far as to give her a kiss he would leave the States for
Europe the next day. I don't deny that she was a bit huffed
privately at his style, allowed that it did not argue well for
the future, and so forth maybe, but she had settled definitely on
Baxter, and being a plain, sensible girl she knew that she could
not have everything and that there was a quantity of worse
faults. However, her father, who was an old-timer, had other
ideas. Not that he disliked Baxter either, but he had been a
brisk, lively man in his own time and he had notions as to how
things ought to be done.</p>

<p>"'Look here, Janet,' he said one day, 'this has been going on
for a matter of well over a twelvemonth now and I have no mind to
see a daughter of mine trifled with. Is there anything definite
fixed up between you and Baxter yet?'</p>

<p>"'Not exactly definite perhaps, popper,' replied Janet,
combining truth and prudence as she always contrived to do. 'Mr.
Green is like old Rock&mdash;slow but steady.'</p>

<p>"'Well, I'm thinking of having the old horse shot before long,
for that matter,' he replied thoughtfully. 'That's not the point,
however. What I'm going to say is this. Young Matt Henrick has
been talking to me a sight about you lately, and the two ranches
lie mighty convenient. I don't deny that I'm willing to make
considerable allowance for your own feelings, but in reason the
thing can't go on for ever. When do you expect to see Baxter
again?'</p>

<p>"'He talked of dropping in to supper on his way back from
Sweet Spring to-morrow,'" replied the girl.</p>

<p>"Old Saunders nodded. 'That fits in all right,' he said. 'That
new Cantonville minister is coming round to supper to-morrow
night also. I'll tote across and ask Matt as well. We'll chance
in towards eight o'clock. Then if you and Baxter have fixed
things up the minister can say the word; if not, well, the
minister will be here all the same and you must put up with Matt.
Now run and find me my tobacco-pouch; I put the plaguey thing
down somewhere not five minutes ago and it's clean gone.'</p>

<p>"It was rather sudden even for out West in the 'forties, but
although an indulgent parent in general, old Saunders had a way
with him when he meant a thing. Anyhow, the new minister was
coming to supper, so Janet went about seeing that everything
should be ready.</p>

<p>"About seven o'clock the next evening Baxter put in an
appearance. No one was about but Janet and she was busy in the
parlour. Baxter found the room half full of old trunks and boxes,
Janet very industriously covering them with shiny Mack cloth. It
improved their appearance considerably.</p>

<p>"'Sakes, Miss Janet,' he said, 'whatever in the world are you
doing? You're not getting ready for a journey, surely?'</p>

<p>"'Perhaps I may be going one shortly,' replied Janet
ambiguously. 'Anyway I had the idea to do up these old boxes
while I thought of it. I'm sticking on this cloth and then I
shall finish it off with a row of brass nails.'</p>

<p>"'It's the cutest scheme out; makes them look quite new,' he
said admiringly. 'Let me help you.'</p>

<p>"'Certainly you can, if you don't mind stickying your hands,'
she said. 'I have an old recipe for making this gum and it is
better than anything one can buy. The only trouble is that it
dries so quickly that you have to work straight ahead as fast as
you can and never mind about your fingers.'</p>

<p>"Baxter made a suitable reply, to the effect that his hands
were like the school birch-rod&mdash;for use, not for
ornament&mdash;and fell to work.</p>

<p>"Under her directions he used scissors and paste-pot
unremittingly for half-an-hour and then that part of the task was
done. Janet's warning had not been uncalled-for; his hands were
plentifully smeared with gum, his fingers clung together. The
girl herself was in an even worse plight, but half-a-dozen very
respectable-looking travelling boxes were ranged before them.</p>

<p>"'It's a great comfort to have enough room for things when
you're packing,' she remarked. 'Before, I should not have known
what to do for trunks, I'm sure.'</p>

<p>"Janet setting out with all the preparation for a long absence
seemed to take a more concrete form in Baxter's imagination. 'Is
it any particular journey you have in mind?' he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"'Well, Aunt Mary has been asking me to go and stay with her
over the winter for two or three years now,' she replied
reflectively. 'She thinks that it must be dull for a girl here
always and they have pretty lively times over there.'</p>

<p>"Baxter did not doubt it, and the thought made him extremely
uncomfortable. Aunt Mary lived in a town a full week's journey
away. She had sons; inevitably the sons had friends. It was bad
enough to keep away from Janet in an agony of self-torturing
diffidence, but for Janet to be a week's journey off, surrounded
by smart city beaux and forgetting Creek Fall in a continual
round of city gaiety, was unsupportable.</p>

<p>"'Say, Janet&mdash;' But Janet said nothing. On the
gentleman's side it was certainly one of those occasions when
silence is not golden, but Baxter got no further. Nevertheless,
with bold abandonment he seized her hand as it lay irresistibly
near his own, and then, as she manifested no inclination to run
away, he possessed himself of the other and held them fast.</p>

<p>"For perhaps two whole minutes the world stood still. To an
outsider the situation required no words, and certainly none were
spoken; Baxter even at that moment could not key himself up to
the pitch of saying what he wished to say, while Janet sat with
quiet, surrendered hands, and face half turned away.</p>

<p>"At the end of those two minutes Baxter's fatal diffidence
again possessed him. He thought that he had better go home at
once and leave Janet to think things quietly over before they
were both committed to an almost irrevocable step. He would have
gone, and she, with the unconquerable modesty of the true
American maiden, even in a Western State in the 'forties, she
could have spoken no word to hold him though her heart was
breaking. Doubtless he would have kept away for a month; it
little mattered how long if he was away when Matt Henrick and the
minister arrived, as arrive they would in the next few minutes.
She could speak no word if silence killed her, but the genius of
a nation destined to the myriad achievements of ingenuity was
dancing through her eyes. The gum, her gum, was all she claimed
it to be. That two minutes' dalliance on Baxter's part was just
enough to develop its adamantine qualities. Briefly, John Baxter
Green, squeezing her hands in his, <i>could not go!</i></p>

<p>"When this remarkable situation dawned upon the embarrassed
young man he tried gently to disengage himself, of course without
success. Then he tried somewhat harder, then very much harder
until Janet gave a little scream. Finding that these efforts did
not produce the least effect towards his release he looked
helplessly round the room and murmured, 'Well, I swor!' softly
beneath his breath.</p>

<p>"So far Janet had been as patient as mortal woman could be.
'You must release me before father comes in, Mr. Green,' she said
gently at this point. 'He will be back towards eight o'clock with
some neighbours, I expect, and whatever would they think if they
found us like this?'</p>

<p>"Baxter was not really a coward when he had to do with men and
he had a high esteem for old Saunders, but the thought of meeting
him in the circumstances drove him nearly frantic.</p>

<p>"'Release you!' he exclaimed. 'Oh, George Washington! I only
wish I could, Miss Janet. What melts this blame stuff,
anyhow?'</p>

<p>"'I don't think that anything short of half-an-hour in hot
water would do it,' she replied. 'And it would have to be very
hot indeed, pretty near boiling.'</p>

<p>"Baxter was pretty nearly that as it was. 'Come along, then,'
he said heroically. 'I'll put my hands underneathmost and perhaps
it will soak through to yours without hurting you.'</p>

<p>"He had only half grasped the real inwardness of the position.
Two heads may be better than one, but four hands, if inexorably
held together at every point by Janet's special gum, are almost
worse than none. If you are in doubt about this, take a lady's
hands firmly in your own and then without liberating a finger try
to manipulate a rather awkward door-handle. You might as well try
with your head."</p>

<p>No one ventured to dispute this statement as the narrator
paused. Jaffer, indeed, went so far as to corroborate it, for
chancing to meet the American millionaire's eye he nodded sagely
and murmured, "'Tes true," with the air of one who had recently
been in a similar dilemma, while further witness was dutifully
supplied by Jan and Urchid.</p>

<p>"So 'tes," assented Urchid.</p>

<p>"'Tes so," agreed Jan.</p>

<p>"Escape by the window was as impossible as by the door,"
continued the speaker, "and the chimney could not occupy a
serious thought. With a survey of the room the truth dawned on
Baxter; he was as effectually a prisoner as if a chain had bound
him to the floor.</p>

<p>"'However can I meet my father?' exclaimed Janet, and she
threw up her arms in despair; and being what is termed a fine,
strapping young woman she also threw Baxter up somewhat.</p>

<p>"The young man had no suggestion to make. The same speculation
from his own point of view was engrossing his attention also.</p>

<p>"'If I were a man,' said Janet with a great show of scorn,
'I'd do something before I would see a girl made ridiculous in
the way I shall be.'</p>

<p>"'Tell me what you would do,' replied Baxter reasonably, 'and
I'll do it.'</p>

<p>"'I don't know,' said Janet. 'But I would cut off my two hands
rather than do nothing.'</p>

<p>"Baxter was fairly patient and certainly long-suffering, but
he looked at things with the plain horse-sense of the male
creature. 'What the plague good would that do?' he demanded
warmly. 'I should be no sprier at opening doors without hands,
and as far as ridiculous goes you certainly wouldn't be a cent
more dignified with my hands hanging on to yours. Besides, how
are you going to cut them off in the first place?'</p>

<p>"Janet shook her head dumbly. It was pretty nearly the only
thing she could shake without feeling absurd.</p>

<p>"Now if only we were engaged,' continued Baxter with a ghastly
attempt at airiness, 'and the minister was coming to marry us, we
might just stand up as we are and the thing would pass off as
natural as could be.'</p>

<p>"The footsteps of three sounded on the path outside, Janet
turned a bright and affectionate eye on the young man at her
side. 'He <i>is</i> coming,' she said, and stood up."</p>

<p>"Is that the end of it?" demanded the itinerant photographer
as the American millionaire rose to look out of the window.</p>

<p>"It is the artistic end," he replied. "They were married, of
course, and lived happily ever afterwards."</p>

<p>"You don't say how they managed when it came to putting the
ring on," remarked the second prison warder, with some
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"That is one of the many details left to the imagination,"
replied the narrator good-humouredly. "I might add, however, that
they put Janet's gum on the retail market under a fancy name and
made a considerable fortune out of it."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the village idiot, suddenly and
unexpectedly, "I have listened to your various stories with great
interest, recognising in them sincere if unconscious
contributions towards the elucidation of the Eternal Problem. My
own life, as you may imagine, is circumscribed and moves
completely in a groove, so that, like our friend the knife-
grinder, of familiar quotation, 'I have no story.' There is,
however, a trifling reminiscence connected with my very early
days which I will venture to relate, in the hope that he who
otherwise on some future occasion might run, may perhaps,
instead, remain.</p>

<p>"My father was a professor of elocution, my mother the
daughter of a country clergyman. The nature of the man was
romantic, impractical and ambitious; that of the woman narrow and
commonplace. On the eve of their wedding day they stood together
on the shore of one of the most beautiful bays of this richly-
endowed coast, watching the play of the moonlight upon the
rippling water&mdash;a time and a situation well calculated to
bring out, one must admit, all that was stirring and impassioned
even in the most sluggish nature. Under the various influences my
father's characteristics rose to their highest pitch, and casting
all reserve to the winds in the assurance of a responsive
sympathy he thus delivered himself:</p>

<p>"'Christabel,' he said, 'I have a feeling, amounting to a most
inspired conviction, that I am destined to some great future.
Hitherto there has been one thing lacking to fire an ambition
that is as illimitable as the space above us, as sure and
resistless as the tides beneath. That incentive has been supplied
by the magic touch of your proud love, and in that golden future
it is only fitting that you should have an equal part. Say, then,
to what pinnacles of supremacy your fancy turns? Do you covet
power? Then in some new and far-off region a gigantic empire
shall be founded that will hail you queen. Riches? Such profusion
shall be poured into your lap that the name of Croesus shall
wither off the records of the world like a poor and trivial
thing. Fame? Then in poem and romance of unrivalled brilliance
the name of Christabel shall be enshrined to receive the homage
of a thousand generations long after the glories of Petrarch's
Laura and Dante's Beatrice have faded from the memory of the age.
Ask what you will that I may set the seal of an inviolable
promise to your wish.'</p>

<p>"She did not chide him for his reckless flights. She looked
thoughtfully out across the splendour of the restless water,
seeing dimly, he thought, some faint mirage of those purple
visions.</p>

<p>"'Well,' she admitted at length, 'there is one thing certainly
that I have always set my mind upon. Promise me, dear, that when
we do get a house we shall have Venetian blinds&mdash;to the
front windows, at all events.'</p>

<p>"This palpably inopportune request suddenly revealed to my
father, as by a providential flashlight, the utter incongruity of
their minds. What prospect of true happiness could he reasonably
anticipate when every detail of their lives was
antagonistic&mdash;his romances bound to her Venetian blind
cords, his empires brought into line with the restricted vision
from her front windows? The newspapers of that period were
devoting pages to the views of countless well-meaning people who
had discovered marriage to be a failure, who had come to the
conclusion that their partners were thriftless on the one side
and piggish on the other, who had courageously argued to the
conviction that they did not know what they believed in, but
fancied that it was in nothing; the newspapers of that period
were also devoting columns to reports of conscientious husbands
and wives who murdered each other, themselves and their entire
families, in order to prove to the world at large how
passionately and unselfishly attached they were to one another.
These things passed quickly through my father's mind as he stood
with his betrothed on their wedding eve beneath the gracious
moon. A fearful abyss seemed to be instantly revealed about his
feet. If he married her&mdash;? He took a sudden resolution. He
did not marry her."</p>

<p>I imagine that the itinerant photographer dropped some extra
sensitive plates. The first prison warder made an observation
about the weather, the second one another about the time, and
every other person present consulted his watch, looked eagerly
out of the window or removed a quite unimportant speck of dust.
Out of this conventional group stand Jaffer, Jan and Urchid, who
sympathetically remarked:</p>

<p>"'Twan't right."</p>

<p>"'Twasn't."</p>

<p>"'Twadn't."</p>

<p>"It was, perhaps, rather late in the day to draw back, but
doubtless my father applied to the case the specious reasoning of
Tarquin. 'A little harm, done to a great good end,' and really
did convince himself that in the long run less suffering would be
inflicted upon Christabel than if she was tied for life to one
who, he candidly admitted to himself, would develop into a very
objectionable character under her cramping influence. The
marriage was to have been a runaway one: in fact they had already
run away, and the ceremony had only been postponed from day to
day through some mistake in fulfilling one of the necessary
formalities. Acting upon his resolve my father now ran away still
further, leaving behind him a note in which he frankly explained
his position.</p>

<p>"The result of his decision was unfortunate for myself. My
mother introduced an unforeseen influence into the situation by
losing the balance of her mind. Standing with me in her arms upon
the anniversary of that ill-fated day, upon the same haunted spot
on the coast, she flung out her hands with a gesture of
passionate renunciation. I was necessarily included in the
gesture, and chancing to alight head downwards upon a boulder of
Cornish granite I became what I now am."</p>

<p>"My good fellow," exclaimed the well-meaning earl kindly, "you
underrate your capabilities, I am sure. I have some slight
influence in Whitehall; if a minor post in the Reconstruction
Office&mdash;"</p>

<p>The village idiot shook his head with a grateful smile. "I
thank you, but you are mistaken, my lord," he re-plied firmly.
"This coherence is only spasmodic. During storms such as the one
we have just witnessed I am always subject to fits of sanity. The
condition is brought about by the excess of electricity in the
air, I imagine, and would doubtless offer a fascinating field for
experiment to the specialist. But, as I have said, the phenomenon
is only temporary, and already the storm seems to be
over&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was as he said. Looking through the doorway I saw blue sky
among the clouds, though a thin aftermath of rain still drifted
in the air and the gutters by the road still poured like open
sluices. Birds that had roosted at the approach of the unnatural
gloom were again venturing forth and the dripping trees were
sparkling beneath the reappearing sun.</p>

<p>Within the room were the sounds of chairs pushed back and feet
grinding upon the sanded floor. All were engaged upon departure.
I stepped out into the moorland-scented air and without a word to
any&mdash;for was I not but a listener and recorder?&mdash;I
resumed my journey. At the point where the road passed behind the
knoll I turned for a last look back. Before the rustic porch the
itinerant photographer was endeavouring to arrange a group, but
at the critical moment the village idiot persistently wandered
out of focus. It was then I noticed for the first time that the
inn sign was that of "The Blue Moon."</p>

<p><i>West Hampstead, 1902.</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>XVIII. THE MARQUISE RING</h2>

<p class="first">"AFTERNOON, Hink. Give my love to the dear
Duchess of Dontcherknow, not forgetting little Lady Marjorie as
well."</p>

<p>Mr. Hink walked out in dignified silence as no suitable retort
occurred to him. They were a common lot of fellows with whom he
had to associate at the shop, having no soul above the counter,
and jealous of his obvious superiority. Early closing days found
them preferring such plebeian resorts as Epping, or the Oval, to
Hyde Park and the promenades of the West End. Mr. Hink went his
own way, and after one or two unsuccessful attempts he tried no
more to lead their footsteps into selecter paths. On the whole he
was not sorry; such companions would have compromised his own
appearance in the haunts of fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. Hink, it will be seen, had tastes above his station. Fate
had cast him behind the retail counter and given him nothing in
return but the doubtful admiration of the young lady in the
cashier's box and thirty-five shillings a week. The congenial
sphere, his proper place indeed, he felt sure would have been
among the <i>haute monde</i>&mdash;to borrow a phrase frequently
on his lips. He was getting on, too. Only three weeks ago had he
not mingled with the brilliant throng at a hospital bazaar
(closing day), and direct from the jewelled hands of the Countess
of Camberwell received a cup of tea? Had he not, with easy grace,
requested the Lady Sybil to put in another piece of sugar, and
when that astute maiden had complied and coquettishly demanded an
additional sixpence for the same, had he thought the coin ill
spent?</p>

<p>He decided to go into Hyde Park and watch the carriages for an
hour. He was confident of recognising some leaders of society; it
was an occupation in which he had found much satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, governor," said a voice at his elbow, "but could
you kindly tell me what a marquis's ring is like?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hink turned sharply. A very shabby, questionable-looking
individual had taken a seat upon the same form, and was looking
up from a copy of the <i>Morning Post</i> which he held.</p>

<p>Mr. Hink did not like shabbily dressed people, nor was he
disposed to enter into conversation with questionable-looking
men. He had a high idea of his own astuteness and never listened
to the simple wayside tale. But only that morning a workingman,
in asking him the time, had addressed him as "mate," and now to
be called even "governor" by a person who plainly looked up to
him, was some emollient. Further, the clean new copy of the paper
in the ragged man's hands, and the inquiry itself, stirred his
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Marquise, you mean, don't you?" he said. "A marquise
ring."</p>

<p>"Marquise it is, I daresay," replied the other, "but I'm not
much of a reader myself." He passed the newspaper to Mr. Hink,
indicating a certain spot where the following advertisement
appeared:&mdash;</p> <br>

<p class="headline">TWENTY POUNDS REWARD</p>

<p class="quote">Lost between Belgrave Square and Hyde Park or in
the Park, a diamond (10) and ruby (12) marquise ring, with pearl
centre. The above reward will be paid to the finder on returning
the ring to 55, Belgrave Square, S.W.</p> <br>

<p>"Well," remarked Mr. Hink jocularly, after looking at the date
of the paper and seeing that it was that day's, "you may be in
time yet. I should go and have a look for that twenty quid if I
were you."</p>

<p>The shabby man made no reply, but folding the paper looked
away into the distance with a somewhat cryptic expression that
roused Mr. Hink's curiosity all the more. What did it
mean&mdash;the question put to him, the clean new paper in the
hands of a tramp, and that quiet, half-amused little smile?</p>

<p>"Look here," he said sharply; "what are you driving at? You
haven't&mdash;you don't mean to say that you've <i>found</i>
it?"</p>

<p>"Governor," replied the man with simple candour, "whether I've
found it or not I don't know, but I've found something. I shall
have to trust someone, and it may as well be you." With these
words he took a dirty screw of paper out of a pocket, and
unwrapping it placed a marquise ring of dazzling brilliance in
Mr. Hink's hand. "Of course it's it," said that gentleman after a
single glance. "Any cuckoo could see that. Look here; ten
diamonds, there they are; twelve rubies, pearl centre."</p>

<p>"So they are, governor, if you say so," said the tramp,
replacing the ring in its covering and returning it to his
pocket. "But strike me clean if I could tell a ruby from a
radish."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Hink enviously, "you are in luck! My
godfathers, but you are!"</p>

<p>The man in luck favoured him with a half-bitter, half-pitying
smile. "So it seems," he replied; "but when I went to Sunday-
school, a good many years ago, I remember a bit out of a book,
'Things are not always what they seem.' Do you think," he went on
with a sudden passionate vigour, "that if a bloke like me went up
to that toff's house I should ever see the beginning of those
twenty thick uns? Garn!"</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?" demanded Mr. Hink.</p>

<p>"I walked past the house half-an-hour ago and see two of them
bloomin' yellow-'ammers 'oppin' about the 'all door. If I go do
you think that the noble toff what lives there will receive Bill
Humphreys in his front drorin'-room? Rats! Them same yellow-claws
will possess themselves of this bauble and then chuck me out into
the road and call the police if I don't go quiet."</p>

<p>"Well, let them," said Mr. Hink, urging defiance. "You'd be on
the right side. You've got nothing to be afraid of the police
for."</p>

<p>"That I most particularly have," replied Mr. Humphreys
fervently. "It's only a small matter of leaving a wife and family
chargeable to the parish, but if it's a question of calling in
the police I emphatically do not wish to be there."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"It's quite right, governor," said the other pensively, "and
to a gentleman and a man of the world I do not hesitate to admit
the fact. Why, just before I spoke to you I was half on my way to
chuck the bloomin' thing into the Serpentine to save being got
into any trouble through it. Straight I was."</p>

<p>"What, throw twenty pounds away!" exclaimed Mr. Hink, aghast.
"You must be going light-headed through sudden joy. How did you
come to find it?"</p>

<p>"I was walking along there," pointing towards Stanhope Gate,
"this morning, when I chawnst to see something among a swept-up
heap o' dust. I picked it out and it was a glove, what you might
call a young lady's glove by the littleness of it. Then as I held
it&mdash;without ever thinking of looking inside, you
understand&mdash;I felt something 'ard, and there it was, down a
finger. There may be somethin' 'anging to this, I thought to
myself, so I went along to the reading-room down Holborn. Took me
a long time to find that reward, too, for knowing that it must
have been lost yesterday I started with the <i>Star</i> and such
like."</p>

<p>"Shows what a mug you must be," commented Mr. Hink with
condescending familiarity. "You might have known to look first in
the <i>Morning Post</i> for anything connected with society."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> might," agreed the other with simple faith.
"That's where you have the head of me in a business like this,
throughout. Well, I did find it, howsoever, and I bought one, so
as to have it, you see. Then I made my way to that address, and
at the sight of it my 'art felt like four-ale what's been left
out overnight."</p>

<p>"Did you happen to keep that glove?"</p>

<p>Mr. William Humphreys felt leisurely first in one pocket and
then in another. Yes, he had happened to keep it, though
evidently without attaching any importance to it, and finding it
he handed it over for inspection. Plainly it had scarcely been
worn, and, except for the dust still clinging to it, it was yet
clean and dainty. Belgrave Square! Mr. Hink took it almost
reverentially, and felt convinced, in spite of its temporary
contamination, that he could detect a faint aristocratic perfume
lingering even then. "Size six-and-a-half," he remarked. "Made in
Paris. Soft as velvet and fragrant as a rose. Ah! it wouldn't
need any more than this to tell me the class we're dealing
with."</p>

<p>"You're right all along, governor," said the tramp admiringly;
"but it knocks <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Here, what did you say the address was?" exclaimed Mr. Hink,
on another thought. "55, Belgrave Square! Why, that's the Earl of
Saxmundham, the father of the Ladies Irene and Gladys Felix-Toft,
the two great beauties of the season. And this is the glove of
one of them, and the ring! I see exactly how it happened. Driving
in the Park yesterday in their victoria, the Lady Irene or the
Lady Gladys for some purpose takes off her glove and lays it for
a moment on her lap. Then it slips unnoticed among the folds of
the rug. A movement, and it is thrown unseen into the roadway, to
be swept aside by a dustman and picked up by you. Oh, my aunt!
Why is luck parcelled out in slabs to the unworthy?"</p>

<p>"Like a book," murmured Mr. Humphreys with quiet enthusiasm.
"Like a bloomin' book, throughout."</p>

<p>Neither spoke again for a few moments. "What you need," at
length remarked Mr. Hink, looking sideways, "is a reliable
intermediary to carry through the affair for you."</p>

<p>"A smart, upstanding, dressy nob," agreed the one of the two
who certainly was not "dressy."</p>

<p>"A social equal, so to speak, who could go up to the front
door and say, without any this or that, 'My business is with the
earl, forthwith.' Perhaps even produce his card if there was any
hank."</p>

<p>Mr. Hink had cards. He possessed a shilling complete guide to
etiquette, and knew exactly what to do if he attended a levee or
found a member of the Royal Family among his guests at dinner.
The cards were strictly on the lines laid down, with the
exception of a slight economy effected by using imitation copper-
plate. "I'll tell you what," he said. "Make it a deal and I'll go
myself."</p>

<p>"Governor," replied Mr. Humphreys, after a rather awkward
pause, "I won't say that the idea hadn't occurred to me
also."</p>

<p>"Well," urged Mr. Hink, as the other again relapsed into a
tranquil silence. "What's the matter with it?"</p>

<p>"When I found that ring," said the tramp impressively, "I
didn't think much, either one way or the other; but when I read
that in the paper I felt for the moment that there wasn't no
holding myself in. Then I saw the house and so on, and reviewed
my past life and future prospects. 'It's no go, Bill,' I says and
I was clean doused. Now meetin' you has put fresh 'art into me,
but, sooner than act the jay and lose it all, I'd chuck it
straightway into the Serpentine and walk away, hungry and ill-
clad, blind my blinkers if I wouldn't!"</p>

<p>"What's the talk about losing it?" demanded the gentleman
indignantly. "D'ye think I'd run off with it?"</p>

<p>"No, governor, I don't. Because, for that matter, I should
walk with you as far as the door. But how do I know who you are?
How do I know that you aren't 'and in glove with the toff at that
address? You've got all the style of it, and you seem to know who
he is. Where should I be if you went in and didn't come out
again; or, being a friend of his, got him to let you out by the
back door?"</p>

<p>"I don't know him, reely I don't," protested Mr. Hink
earnestly. "I'd act the fair thing."</p>

<p>"No offence, governor," replied the tramp; "but there's no
denying that oncet you go inside with the ring you've got the
whip 'and of me, so to speak, and my little all goes with you.
Share and share alike is my idea&mdash;but no. Without any ill-
will, governor, it'd be too bitter."</p>

<p>The bitterness was already overflowing from Mr. Hink's cup.
Ten pounds, and the Earl of Saxmundham, with, possibly, a
graceful word to the Lady Irene or the Lady Gladys! "Ill tell you
what," he said desperately. "You shall come on and stand in fair
sight of the house all the time, only don't make yourself too
conspicuous. Then I've got a matter of two pounds that you can
have now, in advance."</p>

<p>"It's off," replied the other shortly. "Off without any mutual
offence. I've thought of another way. There's an old Mo. what I
know of, and although he mayn't give more than five or six quid
as the breaking-up value, what it is 'ull be sure."</p>

<p>"Sure!" groaned Hink, "what can be surer than the money I put
right into your hand?" He took out his purse and counted the
contents. There were the thirty-five shillings which he had that
day received, and, being a careful, prudent soul, almost two
sovereigns more. "Here's nearly four pounds, and six more the
minute I come out of the house. Don't stand in your own silly
light."</p>

<p>"I don't like it, straight I don't," said Mr. Humphreys,
frankly; "but you have a trustful face. There's twenty quid on
the one side unless this earl has gone broke in the meanwhile,
and what on the other? Well, throw in your watch and chain and
that pin you're wearing, if it is to be, and remember that we've
both 'ad a mother wonst."</p>

<p>Mr. Hink would have protested strongly against making the
acquaintance of an earl, and possibly other members of the noble
family, in so unadorned a state, but a symptom of restlessness on
his companion's part was sufficient to reduce him to immediate
compliance, and after making the exchange they walked&mdash;the
ragged man, by arrangement, a few yards behind&mdash;to Belgrave
Square.</p>

<p>Mr. Hink had a firm theoretical belief in the policy of
honesty&mdash;nor did it seem probable that a request to be let
out by a back way after he had received the reward would work
very satisfactorily, apart from the indignity of such a
proceeding. But as he walked to Belgrave Square there was one
glorious vision that for a moment tempted him. If only&mdash;but
in view of the fact that all his available money, to say nothing
of the other articles, was sunk in the venture, it was a very
formidable "if only"&mdash;if only he was in a position to hand
over the jewel to the Lady Irene or the Lady Gladys and lightly
brush away the suggestion of a reward, begging her to treat the
incident as the willing service of a gentleman to a lady, to what
might it not lead? A graceful letter of thanks at the very
least&mdash;permission to call?&mdash;an invitation to lunch? The
possibilities were more dazzling than the glitter of the marquise
ring when flashed in the sunlight; but, the empty purse, the
empty coming week. That vision had to fade.</p>

<p>The earl was at home and a footman took the proffered card,
but Mr. Hink did not like his manner. He did not like the way he
looked at him, he did not like the way he looked at the card,
less still did he like the way he told him to wait in the hall,
and when he returned and asked Mr. Hink's exact business, that
gentleman positively disliked him.</p>

<p>"Have the goodness to inform his lordship," he replied with
becoming haughtiness, "that I have called in connection with his
advertisement in the <i>Morning Post</i>, and that I must hand
over the ring to him personally."</p>

<p>This had the desired effect, and it is to be placed on record
that the ring gained for Mr. Hink the happiness of seeing and
conversing with the Right Hon. the Earl of Saxmundham for at
least five minutes, although the expression of felicity can only
be accepted in a courtesy sense. His lordship came into the hall
and invited Mr. Hink to follow him into his study. Furthermore,
to Mr. Hink's way of thinking the noble lord did not look like an
earl, did not speak like an earl, and certainly was not dressed
like an earl.</p>

<p>"What is it you wish to see me about. An advertisement? Some
mistake, surely.</p>

<p>"The ring, you know, my lord," prompted the caller. "The ring
advertised for&mdash;which I have in my possession."</p>

<p>The earl took the newspaper and read the advertisement. "A
mistake, evidently," he said, with no pretence of being
interested, and he actually looked as though he expected the
young man to leave at once.</p>

<p>"But, my lord," protested Mr. Hink, "doubtless the ring is the
property of the Lady Irene or the Lady Gladys, who have not yet
informed you of their loss."</p>

<p>"My daughters do not wear rings of that description," and the
words and the look accompanying them were as coldly aristocratic
as Mr. Hink could wish for even from a duke.</p>

<p>"Then some inferior member of your household," was the hopeful
suggestion, somewhat blankly given. "Surely your lordship will
not object to have inquiry made in so important a matter."</p>

<p>The inquiry was made with no satisfactory result, and the end
of it found the earl and Mr. Hink looking rather awkwardly at one
another, neither quite knowing the terms on which to reopen the
conversation.</p>

<p>"I can only suggest," remarked the earl languidly at last,
"that possibly a printer has made a mistake in the address. It
might be worth your while to go to the office of the paper."</p>

<p>"I will certainly do so," replied the young man, "and I am
grateful to your lordship for the idea. It is highly necessary
for me to find the owner soon, as, unfortunately, I advanced
every penny I had with me to the finder."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the earl, looking at Mr. Hink with a slight access
of interest. "I understood that you had found it yourself. Might
I be permitted to see the ring for a moment?"</p>

<p>It was permitted with alacrity, and anxious to afford a clue
to the Lady Irene or the Lady Gladys even at this eleventh hour,
Mr. Hink launched into a full account of the whole
transaction.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, my good fellow, that you have been imposed
upon," said his lordship, when he had listened patiently. "The
particular operation is, I believe, known as 'telling the tale.'
The ring is merely a flashy imitation and practically
worthless."</p>

<p>"What, 'telling the tale'!" exclaimed the unhappy dupe,
scarcely able to realise the possibility. "To me! D'ye mean to
say that I've been 'ad?" The upheaval of his feelings may be
gathered from the fact that in conversation with a peer of the
realm he actually allowed himself to say "'ad!"</p>

<p>"If you left anything of value with the man it certainly looks
as though you have been had," replied the earl, not without a
sense of placid enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Three pounds seventeen and nine, a watch and chain and a gold
horseshoe pin," enumerated Mr. Hink. "But the whole thing seems
impossible, my lord," he cried, anxious to convince himself. "The
matter came about quite naturally, without any pressing on my
part&mdash;in fact, he did not wish me to come."</p>

<p>"That is the way it is generally worked, I have observed."</p>

<p>"But the glove, you forget the glove." He almost implored the
earl to reconsider his opinion on the strength of the glove.</p>

<p>"What of that? There is no difficulty in buying a pair of
lady's gloves, surely?"</p>

<p>"And the advertisement," continued Mr. Hink, still in a
befogged frenzy. "The ring answers exactly to the
description."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you are rather a dense young man," said the
earl impatiently. "The ring answers to the advertisement, of
course, because the advertisement was written to fit the ring.
For a few shillings it is as easy for anyone to send an
advertisement to a paper as it is to buy a brass ring. But the
glove&mdash;'m, yes; the glove was decidedly neat. I should
prophesy that your friend has a career before him."</p>

<p>If any of "the fellows from the shop" had chanced to be in
Belgrave Square a minute later they would certainly have had to
admit, despite their general scepticism, that Mr. Hink was
walking out of the Earl of Saxmundham's house by the front door.
But on second thoughts Mr. Hink was not sorry to miss them at
that moment, and, fortunately enough that chaste neighbourhood
was quite deserted, for not even a solitary vagrant was then in
sight.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>XIX. THE "DRAGON" OF SWAFTON</h2>

<p class="first">A HUNDRED or more years ago it would have been a
safe remark that no house seemed less likely to flourish than did
the "Dragon" at Swafton. Situated under the southern slope of the
Chiltern Hills it was, by that barrier, cut off from the high-
road prosperity which flowed along the stage-coach routes from
London to the north and the north-west; for the old Roman ways
both to Chester and to York held to the east and all others
avoided it on the west. Such custom as it obtained, therefore,
was at the hands of the casual traveller across the shire and the
chance wayfarer who elected to pass in at its open door.
Nevertheless, the "Dragon" had its traditions of no mean order,
and maintained ideals of hospitality which did not suffer by
comparison with those of even the smartest of its more fortunate
rivals.</p>

<p>At the close of a certain December day, more than a century
ago, a very gay and light-hearted cavalier rode into the "Dragon"
yard, and after giving sundry explicit directions about the care
of his horse walked through the kitchen of the hostelry with the
unhesitating step of one who was thoroughly familiar with the
winding passages he trod. If Will Heron&mdash;to give him the
name by which he was known in that part of the country at all
events&mdash;rode a better mare than the rough work he evidently
put her through and the long hours he kept the saddle called for,
that was entirely his own affair. If the ostlers and stablemen
all along the roads paid him more attention than they would have
given to a royal duke, and stabled his horse better than they
would those of a judge on circuit, that may or may not have been
owing to Will's careless liberality and his own easy personal
qualities; at all events within the "Dragon" he was simply the
unquestioned traveller who on many former occasions had won his
way to their loyal admiration by his graceful courtesy, his
gallant air and his ready and contagious smile.</p>

<p>Never did these amiable qualities seem more necessary than
upon this occasion, for, on turning sharply at a right angle,
Will came suddenly upon the usually placid hostess of the
"Dragon" wringing her hands in a state of abject helplessness,
while before her stood a frightened maid, who was evidently the
bearer of tidings which had led to this unexpected state of
distress.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," she exclaimed, when she caught sight of Will,
speaking in a whisper that the numerous doors around
demanded&mdash;it seemed indeed as though she could have borne
her calamities with fortitude if only she could have given
unrestrained voice to them&mdash;"what a disgrace to happen to
the 'Dragon'! Here is Sir Henry Verney and his lady just arrived
and calling for dinner and there's not a thing in the house."</p>

<p>"What, nothing?" said Will in great concern. "Oh, surely there
must be something that they won't mind putting up with."</p>

<p>"Not a thing," reiterated the lady dismally. "What ever will
they say at the 'Cow' and the 'George' when this gets known?"</p>

<p>"But surely&mdash;" persisted Will.</p>

<p>"Six hours ago Robert started for St. Albans as soon as I knew
Sir Henry would stop here. He must have broken down on the road,
God knows where, for he ought to have been back these two hours.
A brace of chickens would have done, but the fox had the last of
them yesterday. There was still a small shoulder of mutton in the
house, and Sir Henry, none too pleased I thought, consented to
make shift with that, and now, now," continued the unfortunate
woman wringing her hands afresh, "Mary has just told me that the
mutton has disappeared and a strange dog has been seen making out
of the yard with something in its mouth."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's vastly awkward," said Will, hitting his boot with
his riding-whip as though he might thereby drive an inspiration
upwards. "Sir Henry has the reputation of an epicure, one
hears."</p>

<p>"There's something even more unfortunate than that," whispered
the hostess, drawing Will aside. "They say that he has come about
purchasing the Thornsby estate, and the 'Dragon' goes with it.
Just now we&mdash;I&mdash;oh well, everyone will most likely know
soon enough. Things have not been at their best of late&mdash;"
Will nodded gravely&mdash;"fewer people have drawn up at the
'Dragon': you may have seen it"&mdash;again Will mutely
assented&mdash;"and, in short, part of the rent has been left
over for the last year or two. Our present landlord is easy-going
and friendly, but if Sir Henry buys the estate and gets a bad
impression of us from the start&mdash;well, you know how it will
be."</p>

<p>Will pushed back his narrow-brimmed hat over his curls and
pondered sagely. To help if possible in such a case came to him
as naturally as did certain other instincts, less charming, and,
when viewed through five or six score cold years, even
forbidding. Frequently it had been his lot to assist fair ones
out of the difficulties into which cruel fortune or their own
indiscretion had led them, and to him, almost at first sight,
they turned instinctively. Sometimes he fought, occasionally used
diplomacy and his own sweet persuasiveness; once, when both these
means failed, he had even beggared himself for the time of all
but his mare Cassandra. Greatly he preferred the first manner of
settling all difficulties as they arose, but obviously he could
not fight Sir Henry Verney because there was no dinner for
him.</p>

<p>"Take me to the larder," he said after a few moments'
desperate thought, "and let us trust that he may prove more of a
gourmand than an epicure."</p>

<p>Whatever Will's forlorn scheme might be, the contents of the
larder appeared to meet his requirements fully. With a decision
that bore a suspicion of indifference he picked out one hopeless
thing after another: the bones of a boiled fowl, a fragment of
game pasty, the remnant of a mighty sirloin and a noble selection
of condiments composed of every herb and spice which he could lay
his hands upon. Over this unpromising collation he gave the half-
laughing, half-crying but wholly docile landlady certain
instructions in the art of simple cookery, drilled Mary for her
unexacting part, and with a slightly more imposing swagger of hat
and spur than he usually carried, marched into the large room
where Sir Henry Verney and his lady awaited their dinner.</p>

<p>Inside, he swept off his hat and bowed with the courteous
deference of a man who would crave permission to intrude where he
has every right to be. Lady Verney was idly turning over the
pages of a month old <i>Register</i> with no pretence of
interest, and glancing at the gallant figure in the doorway bowed
slightly in response; Sir Henry, who was dozing before the fire,
pulled himself up in his chair and said ungraciously, "I
understood, sir, that we were to enjoy the privilege of a private
sitting-room."</p>

<p>"I am entirely at your command, sir," replied Will, smiling
unabashed and advancing into the room. "It so happens that at
this season it is customary, it appears, to furbish up the
'Dragon' against the busy time which it enjoys in the spring, and
from this cause all the other rooms are now in a state of
uninhabitable confusion. This one is either private or public as
the occasion demands, but if my presence is distasteful there is
doubt-less a fire and a chair in the kitchen where I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" cried the lady impulsively, while Sir Henry mumbled
what passed for an assent, and again settled himself down to his
nap. Bowing again with the ceremony which the occasion required,
Will took his seat at a small table and turned to Mary, who had
followed him into the room and now stood asking what he would be
pleased to require for dinner.</p>

<p>"What should one require?" he replied sharply. "Have I not
come fifteen miles out of my way over the most atrocious
turnpikes south of Oxford to taste another Swafton pie? I gave my
order to your mistress half an hour ago; since when has the
'Dragon' fallen to saving itself the trouble of making them by
putting off its guests with readier fare?"</p>

<p>At these words Sir Henry betrayed signs of interest, and when
the maid had left the room in evident confusion, he turned to
Will with a much more conciliatory manner than he had yet
displayed. "Sir," he remarked after a moment's hesitation, "I
heard you refer just now to a Swafton pie, for which, I gather,
this place is noted?"</p>

<p>"It is, sir," replied Will carelessly. "The Swafton pie of the
'Dragon' is considered by connoisseurs to be unequalled for
delicacy of flavour and for the choice blending of
ingredients."</p>

<p>"But, of course," remarked the lady, who was by no means
desirous of being kept at a country inn so that her husband's
palate might be satisfied, "one can easily obtain it
elsewhere&mdash;in town."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, madam," replied Will, "not the two
proverbial inducements of love and money could procure it even
for you&mdash;so you see how impossible it then is. Not only do
some of the essential flavouring herbs grow in Swafton alone, but
there is a secret in the cooking which has been a 'Dragon'
heirloom for generations.</p>

<p>"Why was this not&mdash;" began Sir Henry.</p>

<p>"It is a perverse and vexatious dish, taking the entire
attention of one," suggested Will.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, sir," cried the baronet, "it is infamous that
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if you would permit me to make a suggestion," continued
Will, "I would venture to offer a solution. I have already
trespassed upon your retirement: if you, sir, and your
lady"&mdash;more elaborate ceremony&mdash;"would do me the honour
of joining me and satisfying your natural curiosity I should be
gratified beyond measure, and assured that I am not thrusting my
company upon you. The Swafton pies, take my word, sir, are all
royal in dimensions and this one will now be well upon its
way."</p>

<p>Sir Henry hemmed once or twice and looked up; his wife smiled
very faintly and looked down.</p>

<p>"Really, sir&mdash;" said the gentleman. "If you are quite
sure, sir," murmured the lady.</p>

<p>Will did not wait for further encouragement; with the butt of
his whip he struck the table soundly.</p>

<p>"Tell your mistress," he said when Mary appeared, "to remove
from the oven everything that might possibly impair the flavour
of the pie; also tell her that this lady and gentleman dine with
me. The occasion demands the most scrupulous care," he added
beamingly, turning to his guests.</p>

<p>It was several hours later when Will lifted himself into the
saddle again after taking a half-mournful farewell of the lady
and receiving a cordial one at the hands of the baronet. The
dinner had been an eminent success, for a December day's drive
across the plains gives a healthy craving to even the most
fastidious, and however remiss the larder of the "Dragon" may
have been, its cellars and garden had proved themselves to be
beyond reproach. Curiously enough, Mr. Heron's political views
happened to coincide exactly with those of Sir Henry, and they
applauded Fox and execrated the Alliance in harmonious unison.
Furthermore, the emotions with which a man sits down to a denied
repast are very different from those with which he would regard a
humbly proffered dish of broken meat flavoured with herbs. Both
Sir Henry and his wife declared enthusiastically that they had
never tasted anything like it (which was more than probable), and
thereat the blushing hostess had to present herself to receive
their congratulations.</p>

<p>As Will cantered back along the road he had come a few hours
earlier he turned half round to catch a glimpse of the lights
behind him at the last point they showed upon his path. "Its own
reward!" he murmured whimsically, repeating to himself the last
gay words with which he had put aside the landlady's heartfelt
thanks. And truly, when he came to reckon it up, his generous
service and resource carried little to a material credit; for his
timely rescue of the "Dragon's" honour cost Will Heron just two
thousand guineas, that sum being the (unset) value of the diamond
necklace which, as his information went, Lady Verney was carrying
back to town with her.</p>

<p>The "Dragon" has long passed away, but before it sank into its
final stage of senile decrepitude it enjoyed an era of prosperity
which overshadowed all its former glories. Gradually it began to
be known that at the "Dragon" of Swafton, and nowhere else, was
to be obtained a certain pie of exquisite flavour and secret con
diments. Sir Henry Verney carried the fame of them round about
town and all the most celebrated cooks went to the "Dragon" in
their spare time, unsuccessfully endeavouring to detect the
wonderful herb to which the dish was said to owe its piquancy.
When, in 1795, Pitt declared in the House of Commons that an
apparently attractive measure brought forward hastily was "like a
Swafton pie, which we are asked to swallow without full knowledge
of its contents," the fame of the "Dragon" may be taken as at its
zenith and its yard became a fashionable meeting-place for coach
parties who had driven over from London and from Oxford.
Tradition of the road asserts that the Prince fell an early
victim to the appetising air from the hills and the flavour of
the pie, and might be seen at least once a month driving Mrs.
Fitzherbert thither in a curricle, but with mere rumour this
narrative has no concern.</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>XX. THE DREAM OF WILLIAM
ELGOOD</h2>

<p class="first">HAD that ubiquitous individual, "the merest
observer," been in Carston Cottage on a certain September
morning, he could not have failed to notice that something
unusual was passing in the mind of its owner, William Elgood,
retired sea captain. It was not wonderful, therefore, that these
signs forced themselves upon the attention of those who were best
acquainted with the habits of Mr. Elgood, and his wife and
daughter exchanged frequent looks of interrogation and surprise,
though they refrained from making any comment, for, to tell the
truth, the ex-captain of the <i>Petrel</i> had not a nature that
invited confidence or sympathy, and had carried not a little of
the manner of the forecastle into his own parlour.</p>

<p>Rousing himself from his reverie, and leaving his scarcely-
touched breakfast, Elgood crossed the room and, after pausing
before a framed chart that hung on the wall, he picked up his hat
and went out, nor did his preoccupied look leave him till he had
covered the mile that lay between Carston Cottage and
Westport.</p>

<p>"Whatever can be the matter with your father this morning,
Letty?" said the elder of the two ladies when they were alone,
"he's scarcely touched his breakfast. He's been a little strange
for the last two or three days. Can it be anything to do with Mr.
Vernon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" cried Letty, jumping up, "it was shameful the way
father behaved the last time Mr. Vernon was sketching the ruins
from the garden. You know he had <i>our</i> permission, at any
rate, and he only came there because the view is better on this
side&mdash;you can see quite a long piece of wall from behind the
laurels, but from the field the ivy half hides it. And, then, to
call Mr. Vernon a&mdash;oh, well, something nautical."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, you know it always irritates William to see anyone
earning a living in an easy way. He has had to work hard
himself."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Vernon doesn't earn a living, mother. He said that
he's never sold a picture yet, although he's always been very
successful at getting them in a lot of exhibitions he told me
about. And to think that father should say that he'd be doing
more good tarring a rope!"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose that William really minded his painting, or
being in the garden so much," sighed Mrs. Elgood,
"but&mdash;well, you know, dear, he has been about here a good
deal lately, and your father naturally thought that it was you,
and not the ruin, that attracted him."</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i>, mother? Oh, mother, however could you imagine
that? Indeed, I'm sure he never thought of me at all. Why should
he? You don't really think that, do you?&mdash;it's only father.
He's so ridiculous. Mr. Vernon cares for nothing but his art, I'm
sure. Why, he even offered to teach me to sketch the other day;
he thinks of nothing else, I believe."</p>

<p>"It is just as well," said her mother consolingly, "for of
course he will not come here again now."</p>

<p>To this Letty made no reply. Perhaps the subject of Mr. Vernon
was of less interest to her than the arrival of the postman, whom
she ran out to intercept.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the dissipator of this artistic idyll had
reached the water-side, and, after a brief search, apparently
found the object of his journey, who rose from the cabin of the
<i>Nymph</i> in response to a stentorian shout from the quay.
Seeing Mr. Elgood, the captain of the <i>Nymph</i> waved a
pleased and surprised greeting, and, after giving a few
instructions, worked his way ashore and reached his friend.</p>

<p>"This is luck, seemingly," said Elwood, after they had shaken
hands; "I was afraid that the <i>Nymph</i> would be out. How's
Mrs. Timms and the family?"</p>

<p>"Very fit," replied Mr. Timms; "I was just thinking of going
up to the house when you came. We got in on Tuesday night, and
have scarcely finished unloading. You'd better come up with me;
the missis was saying only yesterday that we didn't see anything
of you now that you'd dropped anchor and become a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Don't think it, Ned," said the retired captain, hastily.
"There's never any feeling of difference between us, I hope. Pals
we've been, and will be to the end, if it rests with me."</p>

<p>The earnestness of Mr. Elgood's feeling appeared to surprise
his companion a little. He was thinking perhaps, that since a
recent and unexpected legacy, his old companion had not
manifested any overwhelming desire for the company of his humbler
friends.</p>

<p>"There's something I want to talk over with you, Ned,"
continued Elgood, after a pause. "It's better where we can be
alone; come in here."</p>

<p>They turned into a small inn, which at that time of day was
quite deserted. Elgood led the way into the remotest corner, and
after calling for a glass of beer for his companion and a pipe
for himself, began cautiously:</p>

<p>"This is a matter between ourselves, Ned," he said. "Take it
or leave it, it goes no further. I must have your word for
that."</p>

<p>Mr. Timms gave the required promise, and awaited Elgood's
proposal with some curiosity.</p>

<p>"It's a matter that may be worth nothing or it may be worth
thousands," continued the ex-captain, slowly.</p>

<p>"It would be out of the way of some, and others would jump at
the chance. I tell you that beforehand in case you think that I
talked you over afterwards. It's not every man's cargo, and if so
be as how you want to cancel beforehand, why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Timms. He was getting a little excited, and in
any case he did not see why he should not hear all.</p>

<p>"It's a matter of a dream," said Elgood, who was becoming more
and more constrained and emphatic as he neared his climax. "These
three nights it's come to me, always the same. You know the coast
by Sidcombe Point? Well, about two knots beyond the point there's
a bit of a bay. I've often seen my grandfather point it out when
I was a lad, and say that he'd had it from his grandfather that a
Spanish ship had gone down there, full of gold; brought on to the
rocks by wreckers, they did say. Anyhow, some of the crew got
ashore with a lot of the money, and jewels as well. They buried
it near, as deep as they could in the dark, wild night, and then
had to fly for their lives. War broke out soon after that, and
they had no chance of returning for it. The secret died with
them, and to this day no one has ever seen a single piece of
Spanish gold round there."</p>

<p>"I've often heard the same tale myself," said Timms; "it used
to be common talk about here when I was young."</p>

<p>"There must be something in it, or it would never have been
spoken of so much. Well, these three nights this has come to me:
I was standing, leaning on a spade, at the foot of a single oak,
growing by itself just outside a three-cornered wood above the
bay. It was just as if I was going to begin digging, but each
time I've woke then, and with a voice ringing in my ears: <i>Dig
here and the treasure will be found</i>. That's just what there
is of it yet," he concluded, half-defiantly, "and now it's for
you to say."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do in it?" asked Timms cautiously.
"You aren't offering me a share in whatever there may be for
nothing."</p>

<p>"We've been pals, Ned," said Elgood reproachfully, "and you're
the one man I could trust with a thing like this; besides, I
should like to help you. Then, I've thought it over, and it seems
to me that the only way it's to be done is to take a craft and
get there at dark. If two or three men could bury whatever there
is in a few hours, we can dig it up and get it aboard by morning
and no one's likely to be about at that time. The <i>Nymph</i>
will draw light enough without cargo to get a landing there."</p>

<p>"And who's to stay with her while we're away?"</p>

<p>"I never thought of that. Better take your lad with us. He'd
be all right. Well, what do you say?"</p>

<p>"There's something powerful attractive both about dreams and
buried treasure to a sailor-man," replied Timms thoughtfully; "I
had an uncle who ran on to Walston Head following a dream, which
so annoyed him that he never would believe in them again till he
lost his boat through neglecting another. Yes, I'll go if it's
share and share alike."</p>

<p>"Share and share alike it is," replied Elgood, and they shook
hands on it and fell to arranging details.</p>

<p>The following day, at about four o'clock, the <i>Nymph</i>,
with a crew of only two men and a boy, cast off from the quay and
stood down the Channel. At ten o'clock in the evening she
brought-to slowly in a secluded creek, and the two adult members
of her crew waded ashore, each carrying a spade and a mattock. On
reaching the higher land beyond the bay, Timms uttered a word of
disappointment. It was almost dark, but there was still a faint
light-line on the horizon, and against this, as far as the eye
could reach, there was not a sign of a wood or even a solitary
tree; it was all open moorland, with a thick undergrowth of
brushwood. He looked at his companion inquiringly.</p>

<p>"You are the only man I'd trust on an errand like this, Ned,"
said Elgood, "but I thought it better to alter the land a little
in case you didn't come. I don't doubt you, not for a minute, but
you might talk in your sleep."</p>

<p>He struck inland, leading the way as if he had been brought up
on the ground. After ten minutes' walking he began to go slower,
and to peer about anxiously from side to side. Suddenly he gave
an exclamation of relief, and, walking a few paces to one side,
stopped on the brink of a small dry pit in which grew a single
stunted thorn bush. They descended the shallow sloping side and
threw down their tools by the bush; without a word Timms knew by
instinct that this was the place, and that the critical moment
had arrived. "Which side?" he whispered; his voice seemed to have
left him.</p>

<p>Elgood shook his head. "It has the same looks from every
side," he muttered. Now that they were actually on the spot, the
whole quest seemed much more hopeless and ridiculous than it had
even in the full light of day. Without another word they threw
off their coats, and both began to dig a yard from the tree, and
on different sides. The ground was hard, and every now and then
an obstructing root made it necessary to bring the mattocks into
play. For nearly an hour they dug on in silence, so absorbed in
their work that they did not notice the dark figures that
silently approached and stood on the edge of the pit, all round,
watching them, so that when a voice suddenly called out, "You are
surrounded my lads; it's not worth while making a fight for it!"
the shock was horrible, and for a moment they seemed to cease
living. Elgood was the first to recover himself. "Who are you?"
he cried. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I'm Bill Bristow, if you don't know me," replied the voice,
"head keeper for Mrs. Winton, Lady of the f Manor. And where are
you from? You aren't moor men."</p>

<p>It did not take long for the two adventurers to convince the
keeper and his men that they were not poachers, but the
circumstances did not lend themselves to a plausible explanation
of their motives for being on the moor at that time of night.
Still less were they disposed to divulge the secret of the
Spanish treasure. Under? these circumstances, Bristow ordered his
men to march their prisoners to the Lady of the Manor, who was
anxiously awaiting news of the result of the raid that had been
planned on the information that a gang of poachers would be out
that night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winton was in the habit of exercising a somewhat
magisterial authority in all matters connected with her estate.
She stood with folded arms, and wearing an expression of mixed
severity and judicial calm, when the two unfortunate men were
brought into her presence. The sombreness of her costume of dark
dress and black India lace shawl enhanced the frigidness of her
appearance. By this time Elgood had come to the conclusion that
the only possible way out of the predicament was to explain the
true object of the expedition. Mrs. Winton listened to his story
with scorn, but with evident relief.</p>

<p>"I can quite accept your tale," she said, "because I have a
weak-witted fellow in my employ who is forever babbling about a
buried treasure somewhere else. Eh, Land?"</p>

<p>The man addressed looked down sheepishly. "It be common talk
hereabouts, and was so in grandfeyther's time, that there be
hundreds of pounds of gold buried under the ruins of old Carston
House, higher up the Channel," he said.</p>

<p>Elgood started and looked at Timms. The same thought struck
them both: Had they been sent mysteriously down here to learn a
local legend, that would otherwise never have reached them? Was
there really a treasure after all, and that at their very
doors?</p>

<p>The voice of Mrs. Winton recalled them to their surroundings;
she was formally discharging them, with no worse a stain to their
names than the presumption of mental weakness. They were once
more free to pursue their chimera, and just eight hours after
first setting out, they again weighed anchor and beat up the
Channel.</p>

<p>If the affairs of William Elgood were not progressing
altogether satisfactorily abroad, he would have had still more
occasion for annoyance could he have witnessed the sequence of
events that his absence brought about at home. Hardly had the
<i>Nymph</i> cleared the harbour before Eustace Vernon&mdash;how
informed of his opportunity I cannot pretend to know&mdash;walked
openly along the lane that bounds one side of the garden around
Carston Cottage. It happened at that moment that Letty was coming
from the house, wearing her prettiest dress, to get some flowers.
Now the real gist of William Elgood's remarks to Vernon, divested
of much that was superfluous padding&mdash;but not on that
account calculated to break their force&mdash;on that memorable
occasion referred to at the beginning of this narrative, was to
the effect that the artist was never to enter the grounds of
Carson Cottage again. Letty would not have dreamed of disobeying
her father; at the same time she could not wilfully hurt the
feelings of anyone&mdash;she walked out into the lane.</p>

<p>"You haven't your easel," she said, after they had shaken
hands; and then she stopped and wished she had said anything but
that: it was so reminiscent.</p>

<p>Vernon did not appear to notice anything.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "I came just for a last look; I have to go
back to-morrow."</p>

<p>Letty did not say anything. Everything she could think of,
every commonplace that arose in her mind, seemed to lead back to
that last dreadful interview. In silence they walked on, and
presently found themselves standing by the ruins that formed the
ostensible reason of Vernon's visits.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said the artist at length, "there seems to be
very little that one can learn about this place? There is not
enough left to tempt the antiquarians, and the country people
seem to have no traditions at all. Yet it was an important
stronghold two or three hundred years ago, and held out bravely
against Cromwell."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl, "that is all that we know of it, almost.
I believe that our cottage is built from its stones. Nobody seems
to own the place; only a few weeks ago a neighbour of ours took
away whole cartloads of earth and stones to use in his garden and
in making a wall; when they were digging they found a curious old
silver ring; see, here it is."</p>

<p>Vernon took the clumsy silver band, and scrutinised the inner
side closely. "There has been a motto," he said, "but it is all
worn away except the "ing" of the word 'King.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, let me look," said the girl eagerly. "I did not know that
there was anything there."</p>

<p>Vernon handed it back, but his fingers trembled as they
touched hers, and the ring fell to the ground, then it rolled a
little way and disappeared in the crevice between two large flat
stones that lay half buried in the earth.</p>

<p>"How clumsy of me!" said Vernon, apologetically; "wait a
minute, there are some tools here." He brought a crowbar and,
placing it between the stones, raised one a little way, but the
hold was not sufficient, and it fell back again. As it struck the
ground the two looked at one another in astonishment, for the
sound it gave forth was hollow and almost uncanny. Vernon tried
again, and this time raised the stone, completely throwing it
over. He struck the bar into the earth beneath, and the noise was
repeated, while the bar encountered some hard substance at the
depth of only a few inches. "Oh, do dig," cried Letty keenly. "I
am sure there's something there;" she had quite forgotten the
silver ring till Vernon picked it up and restored it to her.</p>

<p>The removal of a few shovelfuls of earth revealed an iron-
studded board, which was obviously the lid of a box. After a
little more digging and work with the bar the chest was raised
from its bed amid breathless excitement. It proved to be small,
but very strong, heavily clamped with iron bands and secured by
three locks. "Do break it open!" said Letty excitedly&mdash;she
was almost dancing round it. "I'm dying to see what's
inside!"</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Vernon, who was inwardly little calmer
than she was, "it's very curious. Under ordinary circumstances, I
suppose that we ought to take it to some authorities, but I
really believe that it's mine."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Letty convincingly; "you found
it."</p>

<p>"Ah, but apart from that. Look here!"&mdash;he pulled an
antique ring from his finger&mdash;"you see that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "a lion on its hind legs, and a&mdash;a sort
of curly thing underneath. What of it?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the metal shield in the centre of the lid. "Oh,"
she cried rapturously, "another just like it! But you," she
demanded, after a moment's reflection, "who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Eustace Vernon," he replied smiling, "and nothing
more."</p>

<p>"And this?" pointing to the crest on the box.</p>

<p>"That was Stephen Vernon, I suppose; my eighth great-
grandfather, and third Baron Carston."</p>

<p>Letty had become quiet again&mdash;her excitement suddenly
gone: "Oh, I thought you were just an artist, and quite poor!"
she almost whispered.</p>

<p>"Dear one," he said, taking her hand, "I am nothing more. When
my ancestor lost his life at Naseby his young children were left
poor and almost friendless. They were brought up by the peasants
as themselves, and became yeoman. The title was dropped, and has
never been used since; as for this box&mdash;why, if you are
afraid of it, let us bury it unopened!"</p>

<p>"No, Eustace," she replied, with a happy smile, "let us open
it first, and then bury it if necessary."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Just as Elgood and the captain of the
<i>Nymph</i> were leaving the quay, some few hours later, they
suddenly encountered Eustace Vernon, who was carrying a hand bag,
and followed by a porter groaning under the weight of an
exceedingly well corded, brown-paper package. Elgood had quite
recovered his spirits, and was looking forward with certainty to
the discovery of the treasure towards which he had been so
fatefully guided. He could afford to be disinterested now that
the artist was obviously leaving the place, and in a burst of
generous forgiveness he shook him by the hand and wished him a
pleasant journey. It was not until the following morning, just as
he was about to commence active digging operations, that the
contents of a letter, in Vernon's handwriting, caused him to
recollect the exceedingly good terms on which that gentleman
seemed to be with himself. For a moment it seemed as though the
emotions of the forecastle would gain the ascendancy, but even
from the first they were tempered by the conviction that there is
a vast difference between an impecunious artist and the
thirteenth Baron Carston and Hereditary Keeper of the Royal
Demesne, especially when the latter has just discovered the
family gold and jewels; so that in the end the paternal feelings
triumphed, and two days later saw Vernon established within the
shadow of his ancestral home.</p>

<p>This happy consummation leaves only one person badly
used&mdash;Mr. Timms, to wit, who is still threatening to "have
the law on" most of the principals of this history.</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>XXI. FROM A LONDON BALCONY</h2>

<p class="first">THE balcony runs the whole length of the
terrace, I and by its several stages of decrepitude serviceably
indicates the prosperity of the occupants. In several places it
is gay with hanging plants and festoons of creepers; in others
neglected, unpainted, and falling to pieces. Years ago fair
ladies and brave men found it a charming vantage-point to sit and
gossip and flirt, or watch their neighbours while "taking the
air." Below, the iron stanchions still remain where hung the
swinging lanthorns which threw an uncertain glimmer over
voluptuous sedans or stately carriages. That was before
civilisation swept further west, and before the people of the
Square were content and even proud to describe their
neighbourhood as "quite respectable."</p>

<p>All the houses are large and uniform, but none who could
afford the rent would ever dream of living there unless, as they
say, "there was something coming back." In most cases this
resolves itself into the letting of apartments; it is the easiest
way.</p>

<p>There is little traffic in the Square, and its quietness is
mentioned as a particular recommendation. As the night deepens,
there are strange sounds to be heard, and strange sights to be
seen from the balcony. The sounds are the weirdest, for often
they are inexplicable and insoluble; just haunting. Lately a
little child lost itself&mdash;so someone said&mdash;and its
incessant cries rang out like the bleating of a strayed lamb. Not
a window was thrown up, not a door opened; it was nothing.
Presently the policeman came his round, and took it away.</p>

<p>My balcony enjoys a happy mean. There are no flowers, nothing
fancy about it, but it is painted, like the rest of the house,
once every three years. The house on the left is dingy and
jealous. The balcony there is latticed all round, and on the
roof, high above, two jagged <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> mark the
boundaries. The house on the right seems ordinary and
commonplace. At certain and regular hours the door opens, and a
white-haired lady, leaning heavily on a gold-headed stick, walks
out and across the road into the garden beyond. She has a kind,
benevolent face; a face that instinctively inspires confidence
and trust. No one else ever seems to leave the house, but on a
sunny afternoon a light-haired girl may occasionally be seen for
a moment, hanging a caged goldfinch out or watering the ferns and
plants.</p>

<p>To the friendless, aimless man there is a humanising
fascination in idly watching the meaningless trivialities of the
little world around him. In piecing together the casual incidents
and building upon the passing commonplaces he loses his
oppressing sense of utter loneliness, and invests his neighbour
with an interest of comedy or tragedy as may seem most
appropriate. A passing word, an intercepted smile, a shrinking
look, each becomes the key to a chapter of, romance and
contributes to the unreal creation of his imagination.</p>

<p>In this way I had come to take an interest in the silver-
haired lady next door, and assigned to her the <i>rôle</i> of
fairy godmother, and pictured her as a benevolent intervener in
the destinies of numerous <i>protégés</i>. One evening this
imaginative conceit was strengthened by a pretty incident. I was
on the balcony, watching the white light of the evening pale into
a faint opal dusk, when a cab rumbled along the road below me,
and stopped at the next house. First of all my fairy godmother
alighted, slowly, as all her actions were, and then followed the
veritable Cinderella of my fancy. Cinderella just from the fields
and monotonous toil, with her eyes shining out to the first mad
glamour of London town; Cinderella, in poor, coarse dress, with
the face of an angel and the form of a perfect woman.</p>

<p>For a few minutes she stood there, watching her corded wood
box being lifted down, while her companion walked slowly into the
house, and&mdash;in my imagination&mdash;stood waiting in the
hall with a welcome when the girl rejoined her.</p>

<p>Whether it was that after the new arrival I began to notice
the house on the right more closely than before, or whether other
people also had gone in, I cannot say, but certainly from that
time I grew conscious of new and unascribable sounds and
incidents. Through the open window came the frequent sounds of
voices in dispute, a voice in tears and entreaty, and a hard,
coarse female voice&mdash;utterly irreconcilable with anyone I
had seen&mdash;raised in threats and anger. I came to the
absolute certainty that the house was occupied by more than one
set of people.</p>

<p>The houses are substantial and the partitions thick, for they
were built at a Georgian period, when ugliness and solidity were
alike aimed at. But one night there came a knocking at the wall
on the right that no amount of brick and mortar could quite
deaden. It was the mad beating of two clenched hands, like the
dashing of the wings of a newly-caged bird against the wires of
its prison. I flung open a window and stepped out. At the same
moment a door in the next room slammed, the light went out, and
all was still. From one balcony to another is only a step; but
what can one do? What but to shrug one's shoulders, and go back
in again.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">With the vibration of a piercing shriek still
ringing through my brain, I jumped out of bed and to the window
at a bound.</p>

<p>Where do the people come from at such moments? I could not
have been more than a couple of seconds, but already there were
half-a-dozen collected round outside.</p>

<p>Ugh! it was too ghastly. There on the horrid spiked railings
twenty feet below&mdash;</p>

<p>I turned sick and faint, and I, at the moment, had not the
nerve even to look at what a desperate woman had dared to do.</p>

<p>They lifted her off, and put her gently down on the cold flags
in the grey, early morning. They reverently straightened her
limbs, and closed her eyes, and drew back her dabbled black hair;
and presently they carried her in.</p>

<p>For weeks after, no matter how muddy the road might be, people
stepped off the path to avoid crossing those stains.</p>

<p>It must have been terribly distressing to the people in the
house. They left almost immediately; but I saw the white-haired
lady only yesterday at Paddington. She was talking to a very
pretty girl, and she looked as nice and sympathetic as ever.</p>

<p>As for the house, it is still empty. Such houses do not
readily let.</p>
