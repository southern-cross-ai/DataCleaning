<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="first">"IN time for the prize distribution," said Denn,
"but too late for the fireworks."<p>

<p>He pointed to the ghastly scene that lay before Houseman and
himself. The agile newspaper man who had supped horrors with a
short spoon during that infernal Cuban business shuddered, as
well he might. Houseman collapsed in the shadow of a wattled hut;
his big limbs were mere frames now.<p>

<p>"Give me the quinine," he gasped. "Lord, how deadly sick I
feel!"<p>

<p>Denn handed out enough dry quinine for a forty-pound head of
steam, and Houseman sucked it down with a gasp and a gurgle. The
dryness of his throat was painful. The skin of both men was hot
and dry, dry as the heat of a Meldrum furnace, and the glass
stood at 120 in the shade.<p>

<p>"You're a fine site to build a man on," Denn said with
tempered admiration. "That's the worst of you brawny chaps; in a
country like this you run to dripping. Now look at me."<p>

<p>"You're an ugly, red-headed beast," Houseman groaned. "If I
could boast an ounce of energy, I'd punch your head. If I could
only have a drink of water!"<p>

<p>"We didn't come here for water; we came here for ivory."<p>

<p>Houseman waved a limp hand generally towards the village. It
was a big affair in its way, with a hundred or two of huts, a
couple of comic opera temples, and a headsman's "palace." A
stockade ran round the village; every hut had its bristling
yellow fringe of piles, gleaming fitfully in a sun born of
Gehenna; even the temples and palace were constructed on frames
formed of the yellow tapering piles.<p>

<p>"Well, there it is," Houseman grumbled. "Every one of those
cursed prongs is a tusk of sound ivory. None of your kagmag, but
the real Simon Pure ivory. Tens of thousands of them, five
hundred tons at the least, and you can have my share for a
mouthful of dirty water."<p>

<p>Houseman chewed more quinine and groaned. For six weeks he and
Denn had come creeping along the fringe of the Congo Free State
in search of this veritable treasure house. So far as they could
gather, no agent of Messrs. King Leopold &amp; Co., telegraphic
address, Brussels, had scented out this yellow village where it
all lay. The truth about it had been extracted from a bushman,
with an eccentric bias towards truth, after two bottles of trade
gin and a patent suet chopper. Ramani had agreed to pilot
Houseman to the village through the bush tracks unknown to
murderous Belgians, and doubtless a bargain could be made.<p>

<p>Denn had jumped at the chance of going along. There was enough
wickedness, he said, alive around Boma to give Tophet a record
summer season, and enough spice with it to shove up the
circulation of his paper, and he had a free hand.<p>

<p>Houseman was not averse from a companion like Denn.<p>

<p>For six weeks they had skirted the big forest of Shaz, keeping
the peak of Uni Uni in sight the whole time. The volcano was
asleep now, had been for years, and the Shaz forest had crept up
to his brisket again. Houseman was for a short cut through this
forest, but Ramani shuddered and refused to explain. Obi and
fabulous beasts, maybe, Houseman thought.<p>

<p>And now they had come at length to the village of ivory. They
had crossed the border with a fine train of mules, a score of
packages of Manchester goods and Birmingham jewellery, a dozen
bushmen and Ramani.<p>

<p>Of all the glittering pageant nought but two white men and two
Winchester rifles and a case of ammunition remained. Still, the
village was reached now, the natives, uncontaminated by hot rum,
and still hotter religion, were presumably friendly. By specious
promises, doubtless the ivory would be gotten to the Congo, and
two fortunes, to say nothing of two reputations, made.<p>

<p>This was all very well on paper, but it sadly failed to tally
with the ghastly truth. The once smiling village of the plain was
deserted. In the streets lay piles of grey bones, horrible
grinning skeletons in every grotesque attitude, men, women, and
children ruthlessly slaughtered. The rattling bones whitened and
calcined under the rays of a pitiless sun. Hundreds of grey
vultures hovered in the air and rose from the ground like flies
from filth when suddenly disturbed. The village was one gigantic
charnel house. There was no smell or reek, for the grey gorged
birds had done their work. A few hours, probably, had only
elapsed since the awful slaughter had taken place, but the
silence of desolation was everywhere. The sun shone down from a
sky like green bronze, the heat smote like waving volleys of
musketry.<p>

<p>"Too late for the fireworks," Denn remarked again.<p>

<p>But Denn would have jested in any peril. He irritated and at
the same time encouraged Houseman. The quinine was getting on
with its work. "Look here." he remarked, "there must be some
cause for this horrid business."<p>

<p>"A family quarrel," Denn suggested. "A little tribal
argument."<p>

<p>"Tribal, no doubt. But why? This looks like something more
than an afternoon call. Go and prospect around, and see if you
can find anything. I'm never any good in this climate till
sunset; then I shall be on hand in full-dress uniform. And if you
can find a gourd or skin of water&mdash;"<p>

<p>Denn set off on his tour of inspection. Man of courage as he
was, he had his nerves set on edge more than once during his
investigation. The slaughter of the villagers had been so
complete that not a dog remained. With a certain morbid curiosity
he examined a grinning skull or two, and as he did so certain
facts were borne in upon him.<p>

<p>"Shot, by the living jingo," he cried. "There's more here than
meets the eye. This looks like a raid led on by some white man
for dark purposes of his own. In this diabolical climate,
personal aggrandisement, doubtless. Now this skull&mdash;"<p>

<p>Denn was scientifically diagnosing a ragged bullet wound in
the skull, when there came a puff, a crack, and the skull went
spinning from his hand. Denn grabbed for his Winchester and
poured a quick fire into the hut from whence the puff of smoke
came. A dozen bullets ripped into the frail cuticle of the hut
like rotten cheese, rendering the cover futile. Then somebody in
passable English called upon Denn to cease.<p>

<p>"Come out and show yourself," Drenton commanded.<p>

<p>A figure on all fours crept from the hut. Denn saw a face
yellow as a spade guinea, a wicked, corrugated, oily face, with a
nose like a hatchet, and a ragged beard like the rusty nap of an
ancient silk hat.<p>

<p>"Throw up your hands," Denn roared.<p>

<p>The figure did so, and then quietly advanced at Denn's
suggestion. The Yankee's quick eye detected the bulge in the
stranger's hip pocket. With gentle persuasiveness he asked for
the revolver. With less grace and courtesy the weapon was handed
over. Denn placed it in his own pocket.<p>

<p>"Now lead the way back to your hut," he said. "You're not my
beau ideal of a hospitable host, but needs must when the devil
drives."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="first"> THE hut was roomy, and by comparison, cool, for
it was dug down like a cellar and the hard floor was wet with
water. There were skins, and gourds, and earthen vessels on the
moist earth, the tiny dewy heads on the outside testifying to the
grateful fact that they were full.<p>

<p>With eyes glistening with a holy joy, Denn proceeded to the
door of the hut and whistled. A moment later, and Houseman crept
into sight. He came languidly, and with the air of a man who
makes quite an unnecessary sacrifice in the cause of friendship.<p>

<p>"What is it?" he said hoarsely.<p>

<p>"Water," Denn yelled, "and plenty of it."<p>

<p>Houseman put on a spurt like a forty-nine-second man finishing
the quarter. He landed on the floor of the hut with eyes aflame
and hands that trembled. Then he took an earthen pitcher and
tilted the sparkling blue-white fluid down his throat very much
as if it had been a drain. Denn followed suit with his lids
closed in ecstacy. It was a moment unrecorded even in the lives
of kings. Houseman grabbed another pitcher, and deliberately
poured the water over the crown of his head. Denn followed suit.
Imagine the chill-stinging bliss of it with a dry shade
temperature of 102 degrees.<p>

<p>"Egad," Houseman cried. "Upon my word I'm a man again."<p>

<p>"A man!" Denn responded. "I'm a battery of artillery and a
fire brigade all in one. What's your name, you murdering thief?"<p>

<p>The yellow image in the hat nap beard was understood to say
that his name was Garcia, also adding as a rider that he was a
free-born Belgian, whose enlightened Administration would see
into this outrage.<p>

<p>Denn was not the man to waste time in idle words. He caught
the jaundiced Garcia by the right hand and twisted his arm behind
his back. The operation was painful, and the Belgian tendered a
free testimonial to the fact.<p>

<p>"I'm not going to have any of your nonsense," Denn remarked.
"But that I hope to hammer some useful information out of you, I
should have punctured your tire a spell back. Is there anybody
else here?"<p>

<p>Garcia smiled. It was a fawning kind of smile, followed by a
nasty drooping of the eyelids. Houseman carelessly touched his
Winchester.<p>

<p>"None but a tribesman who is faithful to me," the Belgian
explained, "and he has gone on for something from the next
village."<p>

<p>"Oh, so you are friendly with the folk in the next village?"<p>

<p>"Yes, yes. My bushman, he come from that tribe."<p>

<p>Denn began to see things with considerable clearness of
Vision.<p>

<p>"Thanks for the information," he said drily. "You came
prospecting here like ourselves in search of considerable ivory.
We've all found it. And what we have found won't be worth much
less than hall a million in market overt. You discovered that the
natives here were averse from parting with the bones. They didn't
know their value, but they had caste prejudices of a short-
sighted nature. It wasn't a bad idea of yours, friend Garcia, to
go further along with your short Enfields and make friends with
the next tribe, because you could stir up strife and arrange for
the next tribe to come down here one summer afternoon and rub out
these unsophisticated children of Nature considerably. Well, you
seem to have been pretty successful."<p>

<p>Garcia protested against the suggestion. Should he be held
responsible for the bloodthirsty nature of the savage? Perish the
thought! Denn waved him aside.<p>

<p>"We'll let it pass," he said. "Anyhow, you're here and we're
here, and what is still more to the point, the ivory is here
also. There's a hundred and fifty thousand apiece waiting for us
if we pull together. I don't particularly yearn to pull with you,
Mr. Garcia, but necessity knows no law. And we've got a
Winchester each."<p>

<p>Garcia expectorated with easy fluency. The stuff was his, he
was arranging to get it down to the coast, and he would be
blessed if he would divide with anybody. Let the Englishmen wait
till his faithful bushman returned, and then they would see what
they would see. Denn's face grew grim.<p>

<p>"A while back you tried to murder me. I ought to have shot you
then. I'm a lasting disgrace and discredit to my mother that I
don't drop you now. I've knocked about the world a bit without
gathering any moss, but I calculate I'm going to roll in it this
time. You grasping yellow tomato, can't you be satisfied with
your share, to say nothing of the assistance of two men who are
worth a whole continent of niggers?"<p>

<p>Garcia's eves gleamed. They could have spelt nothing but
treachery, not even to gain the kingdom of Heaven. Denn looked at
the Belgian thoughtfully.<p>

<p>"Do you agree to our terms?" he asked.<p>

<p>"I've got to," was the sullen reply.<p>

<p>"Very well, then; give us something to eat."<p>

<p>Garcia hustled about as far as the heat would allow. There was
stewed chicken and rice with curry powder, and a bottle or two of
what purported to be beer. The meal was barely despatched when a
tall figure darkened the door, and a native with eyes opened
widely came into the hut. He was tall and gaunt and thin as an
ostrich, yet his spare limbs looked like steel covered with
leather. His lace beamed with joviality; his woolly head was
covered with a cocked hat and feathers; he wore a ragged mess
jacket and a pair of tattered spats. As to the rest, he was Adam
before the fall. Denn was fascinated.<p>

<p>"Say, corner man," he asked, "what's your name?"<p>

<p>"My name Johnny Walker," was the response. "Me Belgian
gentleman. No black fellow. Speakie English same as other white
men."<p>

<p>Johnny Walker proved to be an ally of real merit. In the first
place the heat affected him not at all. He could work remarkably
well, he knew the ways and manners of the country, he had an
unerring nose for water, and he had a wonderful command over his
fellow-bushmen. But despite his joviality and his disposition to
laugh on every available occasion, there was an occasional look
in the corner of his eye that neither Denn nor Houseman liked.<p>

<p>The sun plunged down at length into the sea of darkness beyond
the forest of Shaz, and the hoary, dusty head of Uni Uni faded
away into the purple gloom. And the night wind was blowing still,
hot as the breath of the Pit; but it was a wind, and that was
something.<p>

<p>Denn and Houseman sat outside the hut smoking. Garcia was
their partner in business, but that was no reason why they should
make a friend of him. And, to do him justice, the Belgian
offended no nice taste by indecently thrusting himself upon his
companions.<p>

<p>Houseman lay upon his back facing the coppery flash of the
stars.<p>

<p>"What do you think of him?" he asked.<p>

<p>"Garcia?" said Denn. "I don't think anything of him. A dirtier
and more treacherous rascal never breathed. If he gets a chance
of doing us down, do us down he will. And Mr. Johnny Walker would
cut our throats and roar over the job. If he brings some of his
boys down here, we shall have a warm time of it."<p>

<p>Houseman smoked thoughtfully for a time.<p>

<p>"I've been thinking," he said presently. "To all practical
purposes Garcia is our partner. If he gives us the slip we can
make him disgorge afterwards. And it isn't quite healthy for us
here. Why not get down to Shaz and bring our surplus stores and
followers here? We can depend upon those men, and the Winchesters
will keep Johnny Walker's boys in order. Garcia cannot give us
the slip. His friendly tribe yonder would never dare to carry for
him beyond Shaz, for fear of being made slaves in Congo State.
Now we have once found the way, it will be quite easy for us to
bring our resources up here. It was those weeks of blindly
groping about yonder that did the mischief."<p>

<p>"That's not at all a bad idea of yours," said Denn. "What you
say about Garcia's friendly niggers is quite correct. Whatever
happens, Garcia can only go one way, unless he knows of a track
through the forest."<p>

<p>"The natives wouldn't go. They are afraid of that Obi
nonsense."<p>

<p>"True, but look here. Johnny Walker seems to know the ropes.
And as a shining produce of latter-day civilisation, he appears
to be devoid of superstition. I'd bet money he knows a way
through the forest. Promise him a gun and he'll get us down to
our base on the far side of Shaz in no time. If he can do this,
we shall save at least a fortnight."<p>

<p>Johnny, duly approached, knew a path through the forest. He
was fettered by no clinging prejudices. What did he care for Obi?
And Garcia approved of the business with a grim smile that
puzzled Denn, and made him feel more or less uncomfortable for a
few minutes. Johnny, too, was bubbling over with laughter, which
laughter became more and more exuberant every time his glance
wandered in the direction of the strangers.<p>

<p>"They are up to some game," Houseman muttered.<p>

<p>"I don't care," responded Denn. "Game or not, if Johnny tries
any of his tricks upon me there will be a fine chance for some
Central African swell to pick up a gilt-edged wardrobe cheap.
Don't you worry, because Johnny will get us down to Shaz all
right, the promise of the gun guarantees that. It will be
afterwards that the trouble comes."<p>

<p>Houseman turned over sleepily. He was falling into that placid
state preceding sleep when troubles dwarf and dwindle. Then he
slept. Dunn sat finishing his pipe, and listening to the low
rumble of Garcia and Johnny's conversation. They seemed to be
amused at something. Every now and then there was a queer jar in
the nigger's staccato laughter.<p>

<p>"I don't fancy I'll sleep just yet," Denn muttered. "It might
be dangerous. I'd give a trifle to be in the joke."<p>

<p>A few minutes later and silence reigned supreme.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="first">"We're a fine specimen of a happy family,"
Drenton Denn remarked, as he watched Johnny Walker making his
final preparations for the forest journey. "We are partners in a
big bonanza, and we ought to love one another, but we don't. I
suppose this is what you call an offensive and defensive
alliance&mdash;get all you can out of the other party and cut his
throat after to save him the trouble of cutting yours."<p>

<p>Not that Denn or Houseman had much cause for alarm. There was
only one way down to the road below Shaz, so there was no chance
of Garcia's giving them the slip. Moreover, they held Johnny
Walker as a hostage.<p>

<p>Johnny seemed to be impressed with the importance of his
mission. The Christy Minstrel side of his nature was suppressed
for the moment; he wore a grave and solemn air; he might have
been a Cabinet Minister in the throes of a political crisis.<p>

<p>"We no travel in the daytime," he said. His manner was
complete and final. "Much hot in the forest then, no air comes,
and sun blaze down between the trees. Travel by night and sleep
by day."<p>

<p>"All right, General," Denn responded cheerfully, "it's all the
same to me. Get us down to our base quickly, and you'll be
honourably mentioned in the dispatches."<p>

<p>They set out the next evening a little before sunset, and by
the time darkness came they had plunged into the thick forest.
Whatever might have been Johnny's own opinion of his merits, one
virtue he certainly possessed, and that was a perfect knowledge
of woodcraft.<p>

<p>That he knew the way perfectly was obvious from the first. No
bushman unfamiliar with that dense belt of forest would have
dared to strike into the heart of it otherwise. And Johnny
hesitated not at all. With a careless glance to the left and
right he strode on, never once halting till the first strokes of
dawn appeared.<p>

<p>Then he called a halt and breakfast was partaken of. One thing
struck the two white men as strange. There was practically no
undergrowth, no luxuriant ground vegetation, nothing but huge
forest trees, and underfoot a grey bare floor, as if the greater
trees had sucked up the moisture necessary to plants of smaller
growth. It was a floor smooth and hard and undulating, with
thousands upon thousands of giant boles, like dim cathedral
aisles stretching away, vast, dim, diminishing into gloom.<p>

<p>There was another and equally striking feature. Animal life
there appeared to be none. Occasionally an unseen bird gave out
one long melancholy note like the sound of a cracked bell&mdash;a
horribly suggestive note.<p>

<p>Houseman looked around him and shivered.<p>

<p>"Beastly," he said. "I feel like a man who has been asked to a
funeral where they have mislaid the corpse. I'd like to wring
that infernal bird's neck and stop that passing-bell of his.
John, is there much more of this Dead March in <i>Saul</i>
business?"<p>

<p>Johnny responded with his best manner. He had become grave and
courteous, like a chaplain in the condemned cell, Denn suggested.<p>

<p>"Two hundred miles," he replied, "and all'e same. Cause why,
Shaz he sometimes smoke his pipe, and the dust from the mountain
he come down and down like dense mist on the river and he chokee
everything up 'cept dem big trees."<p>

<p>"He means an eruption from Shaz," Houseman explained. "The
dust and ashes settle down and choke everything but the forest
trees, and as it rains here but once in forty years or so,
everything gets a little thick. Gets worse as we go on, Johnny?"<p>

<p>Johnny smiled, with a curious gleam in his eyes not lost upon
Denn. The time was coming when they were to remember this
conversation. But for the present, the pressing demands of sleep
engaged their attention.<p>

<p>When they awoke again the sun was low, and Johnny had supper
ready. Throughout the whole of the second night they struggled
on, the silence growing more oppressive and the dust becoming
deeper under their feet. It would he impossible to describe the
awful gloom of it all, the dead stillness, as of a world hushed
in a last long sleep, the cracked passing-bell notes of those
ghostly unseen birds, the grey pall of dust lying everywhere.<p>

<p>"God help the man alone here," Denn remarked as he turned from
his breakfast. "This is the haunt of the lost, the valley of
shadow leading to the gates of hell. No wonder the niggers are
afraid of it!"<p>

<p>Houseman made no reply. A heavy melancholy lay upon him. At
every breath, at every motion of the body, dust fine as flour
rose in clouds. Their clothes were saturated with it, the sifted
grey particles covered the skin; hair and moustaches were loaded
with the stuff. Nothing but the constant supply of water
possessed by the party kept throat and lips moistened. A long-
drawn chain of slumber was impossible. The choking dust woke them
to drink greedily and then to slumber fitfully again.<p>

<p>Out of a troubled dream Denn woke at length, with a gasp and a
start. The broad light of day was gleaming through the trees. By
Denn's side, like a corpse under a diaphanous cloth, lay
Houseman. The cloud of dust, falling, dripping, feathering from
the trees, had covered him completely.<p>

<p>"This business is getting on my nerves," Denn muttered. "Fancy
another eight days of this. Get up Houseman, it's breakfast
time."<p>

<p>Stimulated by a vigorous kick, Houseman struggled to his feet.<p>

<p>He blew the dust from his lips and nostrils like a cloud. He
gasped and gurgled for water, which Denn administered. Two grimy
millers stood confronting one another.<p>

<p>"Where's Johnny, and where's breakfast?" Houseman croaked at
length.<p>

<p>Denn looked round him swiftly. There was no sign of Johnny to
be seen. The provisions lay there, and the water bottles were
there, but nothing had been made ready. In a voice that trembled
slightly, Houseman yelled for the dusky retainer. No sound came
in reply, save the echo of the bell bird's note.<p>

<p>Demi tried to light pipe cheerfully. Smoking in that stagnant,
loaded atmosphere was impossible. The Yankee sat down resignedly.<p>

<p>"I confess to being in a mortal funk on a few occasions," he
said. "I was in a mortal funk when those firebug chaps had me at
their mercy. I felt pretty blue when I had the brush with the Red
Speck in Madagascar, but I never felt worse than I do at this
present moment.<p>

<p>"Johnny 'Walker has abandoned us?"<p>

<p>"That's about the size of it. We are over forty miles in the
thick of the most awful forest ever imagined by the mind of man.
We haven't a notion where we are, and our tracks are sifted up
almost as soon as they are made. When our provisions give out we
shall perish miserably. With the greatest care our water can't
last more than another day, and we don't know the spot where dear
Johnny intended to fill the bottles again. Fancy the thirst we
shall have in this atmosphere before long!"<p>

<p>Houseman bent his head and shuddered.<p>

<p>"Don't," he said, "don't think of it. If Garcia had not been a
coward he would have murdered us, and there would have been an
end of it. I suppose a death like this suited his purpose better.
If ever we get out of this!"<p>

<p>Denn laughed bitterly. The fearful gloomy silence depressed
even him.<p>

<p>"My boy," he said solemnly, "if ever there was a case of 'Rock
me to sleep, mother,' this is one."</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="first">THEY were struggling on and on together,
fiercely, desperately, with haggard eyes and gritted teeth, as
the Anglo-Saxon has ever fought in the face of death and danger.
A day and a half had elapsed, and the adventurers were at the
last gasp.<p>

<p>Provisions they had in plenty, but the lack of water was
dreadful. They were doling it out a spoonful at a time, and even
only then when it became absolutely necessary. No words were
spoken, for speech was precious, and saliva was as a black pearl.
Ever and anon one of them would fall hack gasping, with distended
lips and a tongue black as charcoal, and then the other would
pour a dozen drops of the precious liquid between the teeth. They
were spent and faint with hunger, too, for under the black
circumstances eating was almost impossible.<p>

<p>And the further they penetrated into the grey despair of that
maddening gloom, the worse case was theirs. It was a grim world
of silence and dimness under the cloak of trees white with dust;
the same dust was ankle-deep under feet, a thin wiry undergrowth
gave up clouds of it. To the left of the path was a shallow
precipice some five yards down, which gave upon a floor level as
a billiard table, on which nothing, not even a blade of grass,
was growing. On the opposite side of this plain, which might have
been a quarter of a mile wide, the strange bank rose again and
the trees, as if cut out of stone, stood statuesque. It was hard
to believe that these were real trees and that their foliage
lived and breathed. It was more like a stone forest, with a
petrified river running between its cast iron banks.<p>

<p>Houseman dropped his burden at length and sat upon it. There
was a queer flickering gleam on his face that startled Denn. He
had seen that look before once or twice, and he knew what it
meant.<p>

<p>"Come into the garden, Maud," he said, with a quivering laugh.
"Come into the forest and lie on the emerald grass and pick
violets. Nice and bosky, isn't it! Denn, you dog, give me water,
water, lots of it, or I'll strangle you."

<br>

<p>Denn deemed it wise to obey. To have a madman there on his
hands in that awful place would be the last drop in the rank cup
of despair. He poured out a liberal measure and Houseman drank it
greedily. Afterwards his eyes grew more sombre and moody, and he
turned his head away as if ashamed.<p>

<p>"Better if you had shot me," he muttered.<p>

<p>"I know the feeling," Denn replied soothingly. "I had it once
in Cuba. I'll tell you the story some time. But the next time you
want a good old carouse like the last, I shall have to shoot you
as the least cruel way of saying no."<p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't matter. It's only drawing one's cheque in
advance. When I look at those infernal grey trees stretching away
to eternity my mind seems to turn to flame. Let us sit down and
rest a spell."<p>

<p>Houseman suited the action to the word. Denn moved on till he
came to the brink of the bank of the petrified river. He wanted
to think a bit. But, before he had proceeded a rifle shot from
his companion, he saw something that drove the gloom from his
mind and set his heart beating with the fife and drum of hope. At
his feet lay the fresh prints of human feet, a foot from which
the right toe was missing. With the constant dropping and silting
of the dust, that print was the matter of a recent moment.<p>

<p>"Man Friday with a vengeance," said Denn. "Johnny Walker has
followed us. Johnny Walker is not far away. Doubtless he had
instructions not to return until he had seen us across the bar.
IF I can only lay my hands upon Johnny, it seems to me that we
shall be able to receipt the account, after all."<p>

<p>Houseman thrilled at the good news. For the rest of the day
all his vigorous manhood had returned to him. But as evening fell
and no sign of the treacherous guide was discovered, gloom again
claimed him for his own. And as the two flung themselves into a
sleep that gripped them like a plague, they dropped with the
consciousness, that their water was exhausted.<p>

<p>Denn woke with the red flush of the dawn in his eyes and a
misery in his heart, such as he had never known before. The
intense dry heat seemed to burn up the marrow of his bones, the
grey forest trees as they showered their dust down covered him
with a thick, hot, stinging film. He stretched out his hand for
the water bottle, mechanically, and dropped it with a groan. It
was his last day on earth, but what a hell was bound up in the
leaden chain of hours!<p>

<p>Denn was aroused from his meditations by a cry from Houseman.
The latter had stripped himself to the buff, and was dancing
wildly on the shallow cliff overhanging the petrified river. He
was a boy again in lush English meadows standing by the old
millstream, his body bent for a plunge.<p>

<p>"For heaven's sake come back," Denn yelled. "You'll break your
neck."<p>

<p>"Come and bathe," Houseman responded. "Lovely, cold as ice."<p>

<p>Denn ran forward, he made a grab for Houseman, but the madman
eluded him. He raised his hands above his head, bent his body
back, and shot off the cliff on to the grey stone below like an
arrow from a bow. Denn stood waiting for his ill-fated friend to
be dashed to pieces.<p>

<p>"Broken neck for a certainty," he said. "If only I had&mdash;"<p>

<p>Then Denn paused and gasped with an amazement that nearly
suffocated him. For he saw, not a mangled, bleeding corpse below
him, he saw nothing but a movement of the level floor of dust and
the flash of Houseman's vanishing heels. The latter had broken
through a volcanic crust and was plunging down to the bottomless
pit.<p>

<p>Before Denn could formulate this theory, the thin crust
wavered again and Houseman's head shot up again. It was a grimy,
dirty, sooty-looking head, but it was wet, wet, and streaming
with water.<p>

<p>"What on earth does it all mean?" Denn gasped.<p>

<p>Houseman responded with the light of reason in his eyes.<p>

<p>"I've solved the problem," he said. "I went off my head again,
you know. I thought this was a stream of water and I dived for
it. And it <i>is water</i>. We have been walking along this ice
cold river for two days, and have never known it, so thick was
the dust lying on the surface. Man alive, this is snow water from
the hills beyond Shaz. And we took it fora petrified river, asses
that we were."<p>

<p>Houseman dived deep again and ere he came to the surface Denn
had plunged in by his side. Down, down he went in water clean as
crystal and cold as ice. He came to the surface again, he knocked
the black dust from the surface and then he drank deep of the
stream which, indeed, was the stream of life. They were saved.
They had only to follow the course of that silent river and they
must emerge from the forest at length.<p>

<p>"What fools we are," Denn said, as he gazed at the stream now
smooth as a grey floor again. "We might have guessed. Why, when I
come to look at the river again I can see it gently moving."<p>

<p>Houseman pointed to an object far up the stream. It was a
black round object bubbling up and down in the grey scum.<p>

<p>"That's the cause of it," he said excitedly. "And I'll bet my
share of the ivory that that is Johnny Walker having a bathe."<p>

<p>Without waiting tor the rest of his clothing, Denn reached for
his Winchester and set off up stream like a deer. New life
thrilled in every limb now. He ran wide of the stream, making a
detour. Then he crawled to the edge of the cliff and poked the
ugly muzzle of his rifle over. As he did so his eyes met those of
another round frightened pair in a black head, reaching out of
the stream.<p>

<p>"You had better not dive, Johnny," said Denn drily. "If you do
I shall plug you directly you throw up your arms. Please to swim
gently up here, and if you try any of your tricks I shall be
compelled to put an end to your interesting career, because we
can do without you now, Johnny. It means a little more delay, but
the fact remains."

<p class="caption">"You had better not dive, Johnny."</p>

<br>

<p>Johnny came obediently. He was sullen and downcast, as he
stood in considerable awe of the Winchester. For once, the glory
of his wardrobe failed to show off the virile beauty of its
wearer.<p>

<p>"What you do with me?" he asked.<p>

<p>"I don't know yet," Denn responded. "For the present I am
going to chain you to the big baggage, the one you generally
carry, you know. Meanwhile, you are going to get us out of this
infernal region without delay and to Shaz as soon as possible.
Come along, Johnny."<p>

<p>Two hours later the two travellers were beyond the region of
the volcanic dust, and in a part of the forest where the trees
were green and the great fresh-water lake sparkled in the lances
of sunshine. To those accustomed so long to the terrors of the
dust and gloom the change was delightful. A gaiety, unshared by
Johnny, came over the party.<p>

<p>"What you do with me?" Johnny asked anxiously.<p>

<p>Denn smiled grimly.<p>

<p>"Your account comes for second," he said. "Garcia has the
prior claim. When we have settled him, your case will be
considered. As to Garcia, he will never see <i>his</i> happy home
any more."</p>
