<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. THE JURY RETURNS A VERDICT</h2>

<p class="first">FROM the high edge of Mogul to the floor of Powder
Desert was a sheer drop of fourteen hundred and sixty feet; and
even on the quietest day a stream of warm air from the desert
boiled up the face of the rim, so that if a man stood at the
break-off and tossed his hat outward it invariably sailed back to
him. Clay Morgan had shown this to his daughter Janet long ago. It
was a part of their ritual on the trip to town, and as soon as they
reached the rim this afternoon, she reminded him of it again;
whereupon he sailed his hat across the rim, caught it on the
rebound, and witnessed her delighted smile. Afterwards they turned
downgrade on a steep road narrowly cut against the face of the
mountain.</p>

<p>As they descended she began to recite lines of "Hiawatha," in
preparation for a school play. Riding slightly back of her, Clay
Morgan watched, her small arms gesture and her naturally sober face
lighten and grow faintly dramatic. To him, it was a matter of
never-ending astonishment that one nine-year-old girl's head could
hold so much. Now and then when she forgot a line she would turn
quite still, her lips pressed straight while she tried to remember.
Usually she remembered, but sometimes she had to reach for the
small book in the pocket of her overalls. At those times she would
say in a disgusted voice, "Oh, fuzz," and give him a small sweet
smile. "It's a kind of a long old poem, Daddy. I think people in
those days talked too much."</p>

<p>She wasn't much for talking. Silence was a habit she had
acquired from him, and from being so much alone on the ranch. There
were no other children within ten miles of the Long Seven gate. All
her games were played alone, made up from her own imaginative head.
Sometimes, watching her from afar, he had seen her people the ranch
yard with fictitious characters and act out their parts one by one
in pantomime. She rode loose and straight in the deep saddle,
unconscious of the horse yet balanced to anticipate any sudden
swing. Since her first talking days he had taught her
this&mdash;that trouble was something for which she must always be
prepared. She wore a boy's shirt and a pair of tan overalls tucked
into small boots; she had black hair braided between her shoulders
and gray eyes shining from a tanned face which even now
foreshadowed some of her mother's lively, graphic prettiness.</p>

<p>The silence and the slow way she had of judging people came from
him. The vivid imagination and the growing beauty came from her
mother. It was something Clay Morgan had watched for, through the
years&mdash;and yet, much as he had expected it, it still was
strange to see in this girl the image of a woman nine years dead,
to know that the tempestuous Lila who had been his wife now reached
out of the grave to remind him of the one brief and violent and
miserable and beautiful year of their marriage. In the beginning
she had said she loved him; she had died hating him.</p>

<p>Powder Desert began at the bottom of the grade. Sand and
sagebrush hummocks, built by the east wind, lay before them; around
these lumpy barriers, high as a man's shoulders, meandered the deep
twin ruts of the road. This September day's sun was half-down in
the west and heat lay heavy on the flat; and in the near distance,
on the benchland at the head of the desert, the houses of War Pass
made an irregular outline. Toward this cattle town they traveled,
Janet dreaming her nine-year-old dreams in sober stillness, Clay
Morgan holding his clear intimations of trouble ahead.</p>

<p>War Pass lay on the first rise of the Cache Mountains, facing
eastward toward the spectacular desert sunrise. Behind the town,
westward, the hills rose away in irregular steps and broken
contours of pine-timbered passes in the distance. On north and
south, rocky defiles connected with little isolated valleys. All
highways led to this crossroad town. Into it came the ranchers and
cattle hands and homesteaders, and the shadowy drifters of the
land, seeking supplies and cheerfulness after the long loneliness
of the deep hills and the dun-gray desert.</p>

<p>Turning at the corner of Gentry's corral, Clay Morgan faced the
length of Main Street, with its double row of angular wooden
buildings and its deep golden dust. Under the courthouse locusts at
the corner of Main and Stage, a large group of men idly waited; and
he knew then that the trial of the rustler, Ollie Jacks, was still
unfinished.</p>

<p>He dismounted by the stable and permitted both horses to nose
into the water trough before tying them to the rack.</p>

<p>Janet said: "I am going to Ann McGarrah's, Daddy."</p>

<p>She always had a quick smile for him when she mentioned Ann
McGarrah's name, as though there might be some secret involved. "I
think," she added, "we will eat supper there."&mdash;and watched
him a moment with her observant eyes.</p>

<p>"You seem pretty sure of that."</p>

<p>Janet said, with complete conviction, "She always invites us to
supper," and walked on beneath the street's board awnings. Morgan's
glance followed her small, resolute figure and he smiled at the
precise way she bowed toward Jesse Rusey, the town marshal, when
she passed him. At the door of McGarrah's store she turned, waved
at Morgan, and passed inside.</p>

<p>Morgan remained near the stable's hitching-rack to roll up a
quick smoke. But he was never a man to let his eyes be idle; thus
now, while his fingers tapered off the cigarette his glance ran
down the street, past the courthouse and post office and the Long
Grade saloon, past the Mountain House hotel and beyond that to the
little cluster of brick and dobe buildings of Old Town. Two
cross-streets dropped from a higher level of the hillside. Up there
sat the high, square, iron-ornamented houses owned by the wealthier
merchants and the big cattlemen who liked to winter their families
in town. This was four o'clock and already the street was in
shadow, though the far desert burned up its brown- gray glitter.
The smell of dust, the rank odor of Gentry's corral, and the faint
steaming of the water in the trough rose strongly around him.</p>

<p>All these things he saw carefully and completely, as though the
changing shadows and the shift of men and the opening and closing
of doors mattered greatly. At twenty-nine his life had made him,
among other things, close-mouthed and vigilant. He was a
long-legged man, turned dark by the sun and toughened by constant
work, with features so solidly composed that when he smiled the
change of expression was a complete and surprising break. Most of
the men on this street were his deep friends; but some were
not&mdash;and it was this tangled warp and woof of friendship and
enmity in a tough, quick-tempered land which put the expression of
aloof interest in his stone-gray eyes.</p>

<p>Jesse Rusey, the town's marshal, cruised the walk&mdash;short,
broad body swinging a little. He had the shoulders of a wrestler;
above the sweep of his mustaches was a glance as cool as flint.
This man had a kind of rocky solidness, a formidable courtesy. He
said, "How are you, Clay?" and passed by.</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse and Hack Breathitt broke from the courthouse
group and walked toward him, their boots puffing up the street's
dust; but for a moment he remained slackly by the hitching-rack,
his mind picking away at the mystery of Jesse Rusey. This town
marshal had been in War Pass for twenty years, yet nobody knew him,
or knew what he thought, or knew where his sympathies actually lay.
Everything that Jesse Rusey was lay inside a cropped, ball-round
head. His eyes met every man's glance with a straight gray stare.
His voice was soft, in peace or in trouble.</p>

<p>Hillhouse and Breathitt came cheerfully forward and for a moment
these three fast friends stood by the hitching-rack and swapped
gossip, pleased to be together again. All of them had grown up in
the country, they had gone to school together and had worked and
hunted and had their fun together, and in trouble had stood
inseparably side by side. Clay Morgan said: "Nothing new on Ollie
Jacks yet?"</p>

<p>Hillhouse shrugged his shoulders. "They been arguing about it
since noon. I don't see nothin' to argue about. We caught Ollie
dead in his tracks, bendin' over a Three Pines calf with his iron.
But there's a couple townsmen on the jury. They're the ones hanging
this thing up."</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt grinned. "Ben Herendeen's sore enough to shoot
the jury." He gave Charley Hillhouse a slanting, skeptic glance.
"Your boss is gettin' pretty large for his pants, Charley. But then
he always was that way."</p>

<p>Ben Herendeen owned Three Pines, and Charley Hillhouse was
Herendeen's foreman, loyal to the core. Hillhouse said in a mild
voice: "If they don't throw Ollie Jacks in the cooler there ain't
no use for any juries in this country. After all, Hack, it was
Ben's beef."</p>

<p>"Tough on Ben," said Hack, but his smile remained and the other
two knew how he felt toward Ben Herendeen. Hack Breathitt was
small, quick and restless. He couldn't stand still. He was forever
shifting in his tracks, his eyes and his interest always roamed
around. There was a good deal of rebellion in him and a good deal
of laughter. He never stayed long in one place; the mark of his
campfires lay all through the hills and deep in the desert. They
made an aimless, crisscross trail which led nowhere. This was Hack
Breathitt.</p>

<p>Clay said: "You look thin, Charley."</p>

<p>"I been on the go," said Hillhouse. "We're shippin' heavy this
fall."</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt spoke impatiently. "What are we standin' here
for? Let's get a drink."</p>

<p>They moved toward the Long Grade saloon, three abreast.</p>

<p>Clay Morgan walked between his partners, a hand lying on each
man's shoulders. He was a head taller than Hack, half a head taller
than Charley. Directly opposite, under the locust trees, Clay
noticed the crowd grouped around Ben Herendeen&mdash;Gurd Grant and
Lige White, both big cattlemen, and Sheriff Ed Nickum, and a few
smaller ranchers like Hamp Brigham and Vance Ketchell. Herendeen's
riders, with a few townsmen, made up the rest of the crowd. Ben
Herendeen had his huge muscular back shoved against the bole of a
locust tree. He was speaking with a good deal of energy; his sandy
head bobbed up and down and his extremely heavy arms made quick
cuts through the air, throwing some of his physical intolerance
into the talk. His eyes lifted and found Clay Morgan and for a
moment, even as he spoke, his long full stare clung to Morgan. A
moment later the three partners shouldered into the Long Grade.</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt got a bottle, two glasses, and a bunch of cigars.
They went to a corner table and sat down. Hack Breathitt passed the
cigars to Morgan, poured a drink for Hillhouse and for himself and
settled deep in the chair. For that little interval he was as
relaxed as he could ever be, still smiling a little, the sparkle of
secret amusement in his eyes. He said, "To law and order," and
downed the drink.</p>

<p>"You," said Hillhouse, "are an ornery son-of-a-gun."</p>

<p>"I guess," murmured Hack Breathitt, "I never see things like
other people see 'em. Seems like I was born to argue. I'm the man
that puts salt in my coffee instead of sugar. Maybe I ought to
settle down. You think so, Clay?"</p>

<p>Clay Morgan fired up one of the cigars. He was low in the chair,
chin against his breast; his face then was dark and speculative. He
shook his head. "Man has to make his own life, Hack. If you like
yours, why change?"</p>

<p>Breathitt shrugged his shoulders. "Maybe I better change before
it is too late."</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse's question held a degree of sharpness. "What's
that mean?"</p>

<p>"The country ain't the same," murmured Hack. "There's one hell
of a beautiful ruckus comin'. The sheep and the goats. That's it.
The sheep and the goats. Accordin' to Ben Herendeen I'm one of the
goats. Ben's about ready to work on the goats."</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse, who was a quiet workhorse of a man, slowly
nodded. A young rider, wearing boots so high-heeled that he seemed
to walk on stilts, entered the saloon and came straight toward the
table.</p>

<p>"The jury's comin' in, Charley, and Herendeen wants you." Both
Morgan and Breathitt watched Hillhouse, who showed a rare
irritation. He said briefly, "I'll come when I'm through here," and
when the messenger tarried he added: "Go on, Billy, go on," and
watched the young man leave.</p>

<p>"Well," said Breathitt in a more earnest manner, "we sure have
had some fun, us. I guess my trouble is in thinkin' that sort of
thing goes on forever. Which it don't. Here's Charley with a fine
job. Here's you makin' a big ranch for yourself. And here's
me&mdash;still warmin' my fingers over the campfire. Everything
changes. Some men grow up and some don't. I never will."</p>

<p>Neither of the other men answered. Hack gently circled his glass
along the table. "Charley, you remember how Clay used to laugh? I
ain't seen him laugh like that in years." And both men were
watching Clay Morgan with a close, analyzing regard. "You ought to
get married again," said Breathitt very bluntly.</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed Charley.</p>

<p>"Very odd advice from a couple of bachelors," pointed out
Morgan.</p>

<p>"Ain't the same," countered Hillhouse. "Ain't the same at all.
Hack and me can go it single, no harm done. You never was that way.
You feed on a different grass than we do."</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt said, as though it were an idle idea, "Catherine
Grant was in town this mornin'." It was so heavy- footed that
suddenly all three men were amused. Clay Morgan bent back in his
chair and let out a long deep laugh. "You're a butter-fingered
scoundrel, Hack."</p>

<p>Breathitt started to speak but was stopped by quick-rising talk
on the street. A man struck the swinging doors of the saloon with
both fists and rushed in. He said, in a half shout, "They let Ollie
Jacks free," and ran out. The conversation in the saloon rose at
once to a noisy pitch.</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse slapped the palm of his hand on the table. He
was violently and openly angry, a rare thing for him. "The two
townsmen on that jury did it," he said. "It is plain that we can't
convict a rustler in War Pass. There won't be any more monkey
business with juries."</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt grinned. "I'd like to see Ben Herendeen's face
right now."</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse answered irritably. "If it was your beef,
Hack, you wouldn't make a joke of it."</p>

<p>"No," said Hack Breathitt, "I guess I wouldn't. I guess if it
was my beef I'd handle that business myself."</p>

<p>"We'll do that," stated Charley Hillhouse. "Wait and see."</p>

<p>"I'm waitin'&mdash;and I'm seein'," murmured Hack, quite
seriously. He put his elbows on the table, a handsome young man, a
man impatient and unconforming and disbelieving. "And this is what
I'm seein', Charley. Ben Herendeen and Gurd Grant and Lige White
will get tough. They'll figure to clear up the hills, their own
way. You know how that ends, Charley? The sheep and the goats.
Everybody on their side is sheep. Everybody else is goats. No
questions and no answers. Just bang!" He stretched his long finger
outward and cocked his thumb, making an imaginary shot. "They'll
figure to scare hell out of every stray rider. But they won't, my
boy. They'll just make fellows like me damned good and
mad&mdash;and then the trouble starts."</p>

<p>"If it was your beef you'd see it our way," repeated Charley
Hillhouse.</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt had his moments of wisdom; he had his far
thoughts. "There's two kinds of people in this world, Charley.
Those that have got beef&mdash;and those that have got none. People
that stick and people that drift. The Lord made you and me
different. It ain't my fault and it ain't your fault. But I like my
way&mdash;and no man can make me change."</p>

<p>"Ben's got nothing against you," said Charley Hillhouse.</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt showed Hillhouse a smart, dark expression. "When
folks get heated up, Charley, there ain't no halfway. It's one
thing or the other. The sheep or the goats." He poured himself a
second drink. "You know what I'm thinkin', boys? I'm thinkin' that
this is probably the last time us three will sit at the same
table."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that," said Charley Hillhouse.</p>

<p>But both of them were watching Clay Morgan, who sat silent all
this while, buried in his own thinking. He had always been the
silent one, the last one to speak. He said, very quiet with his
words, "I want you to know this, Hack. If you ever get in trouble,
come to me. I'll stand behind you."</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse shook his head, bothered by Morgan's words. "I
knew you'd say that, Clay, but I wish you hadn't. Makes it tough on
me. Long as I work for Three Pines, I'll let nothing get between me
and the ranch. Nothing at all." He met Hack Breathitt's glance and
quietly added: "Don't come to me, Hack."</p>

<p>"See?" murmured Hack, and then was smiling at them with a little
regret and a little of his old malice showing. "Well, we've had
fun."</p>

<p>That was all. These three rose and crossed the room, pushing
through the doors. Ben Herendeen remained under the locust trees,
with Lige White and Gurd Grant and a group of Three Pines riders.
Sheriff Nickum was also there, coat hung loosely to his gaunt
frame. Jesse Rusey, farther down the street, watched this crowd;
and on him Clay Morgan put his glance for a moment. Charley
Hillhouse went across the dust to join Herendeen. Janet turned out
of McGarrah's store, advancing toward Morgan. Her little shoulders
showed straight in the sunless light, her small feet made a quick
tapping on the sidewalk boards. She said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are having supper with Ann McGarrah, Daddy." Her soft smile
held its secret again, her eyes showed it. "Didn't I tell you?"</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt removed his hat. "How, honey."</p>

<p>"How, Hack."</p>

<p>Hack said: "Come along with a gentleman."</p>

<p>Janet put her hand in Hack Breathitt's fist and walked away with
him. Hack Breathitt pushed his hat far back on his head and began
speaking confidentially of a sidehill gouger he had recently
seen.</p>

<p>"Did he have a kink in his tail?" asked Janet, who liked to be
fooled.</p>

<p>Morgan laid his shoulders against the wall of the saloon and
freshened his cigar with a match. The group remained beneath the
locust trees, Herendeen and Lige White now talking together while
the rest remained silent. A good many people had come to the
street, scattered under the board awnings. All of them, he noticed,
were watching the courthouse. Tension crawled up the street, strong
enough to touch Morgan's nerves. Jesse Rusey never moved from his
position as he, too, watched the courthouse door. A stage stood by
the Mountain House hotel, ready to go. At the stable, Parr Gentry
sat on a capsized barrel, lumped over and apparently disinterested,
but Morgan saw the way the man's eyes traveled around. Hack
Breathitt and Janet were crossing the dust to Tanner's drugstore,
and at this moment Ollie Jacks, freed by the jury's verdict,
stepped from the courthouse, looked to either end of the street,
and halted.</p>

<p>There had been some talk along the street. It died out as
quickly as if a gust of wind, rushing between these buildings, drew
all sound away. A pair of men walked from the saloon and stood near
Morgan, one of them whispering, "Watch this, Bill." Herendeen swung
his big body from the locust tree. The crowd around him shifted,
each man wheeling on his heels, until everybody faced Ollie Jacks.
Suddenly, for some reason of his own. Jesse Rusey left his position
at the mouth of Stage Street, passed Herendeen's group and stopped
at the edge of the post office, not far from Ollie Jacks.</p>

<p>This shifting and turning was what Clay Morgan saw, this and the
taut shape of Ollie Jacks before the courthouse. He was a wiry man
with the drawn, blank face of a gambler; he was a man who had been
caught stealing beef and now, by the act of the jury, was free to
ride out. His horse was in Gentry's stable, fifty feet from where
he stood, yet this was as far as he got, this rooted position
before the courthouse with Jesse Rusey on one side of him and
Herendeen's group watching him from the other, and with all the
town looking on. At that moment he knew what Clay Morgan and every
soul in town knew: he knew he was a dead man.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. THE THIN CHANCE</h2>

<p class="first">THIS was the way Ollie Jacks faced the town,
narrow-shaped and thoroughly still, his glance taking in all that
was to be seen. He showed no expression during that small interval,
nothing marred the smooth blankness of his wiry cheeks. Yet Clay
Morgan knew what lay behind that mask&mdash;the shocking fear, the
wild clawing of desperation, the scheming and the hoping, the fatal
insight; and though Morgan had never liked the man he had his stir
of admiration and pity. This was showdown for a fellow who had
gambled his life; now in the showdown, with all his luck running
out, he wasn't breaking.</p>

<p>During this time two other bits of side-play caught Clay
Morgan's attention&mdash;Rusey's change of position and the sudden
appearance of Pete Borders at the corner of the Mountain House
hotel. By all the rules of the book Borders had less security in
this town than Ollie Jacks, for Borders was known as a rustler far
more ambitious than Jacks had ever been. Jacks was a weak man
caught by a daring he wasn't big enough to carry off, whereas
Borders was the kind to make his audacity stick and now to appear
here, contemptuous of them all.</p>

<p>The long silence held on, as though everybody waited for
something to come. Ollie Jacks reached at his shirt pocket and
produced his tobacco. He put his head down while he rolled the
cigarette, the brim of his hat shading his eyes, and he was
thinking, Clay Morgan knew, of each last thin chance he had. Morgan
watched the man's fingers roll the cigarette back and forth until
the paper began to crush and the tobacco to spill. There was a
growing sharpness to Jacks's shoulder-points until at last, when
Jacks could no longer endure it, he dropped the cigarette and
pulled up his head and showed this town the gray bitter color of
his face. His glance struck into the street, point by point; he
looked at Herendeen, at Rusey, at Gentry's stable, and at last he
looked straight to Clay Morgan. His shoulders dropped and he seemed
to let a great breath out of him; and, still staring at Morgan, he
came across the dust.</p>

<p>"Clay," he said, "I never did you no wrong, did I?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>Sweat ran its oil-shine across Ollie Jacks's face; his lips were
small and sharp and his eyes&mdash;not eyes that any man could
trust&mdash;clung to Morgan. "No," he said, "I never did you any
wrong. I never set foot on an inch of your range in my life. That's
something, ain't it? I'm not lyin'. The jury gave me a break, but I
know what all this means. All I want is a chance to ride out of
this town."</p>

<p>Morgan slowly turned the cigar in his mouth. The weight of the
town was on him; all the eyes of Herendeen's crowd had swung to
him. He saw the way Charley Hillhouse slowly shook his head,
signaling him to keep out of it. He watched Jesse Rusey make a
half-turn to more accurately face him. Hack Breathitt came from the
drugstore with Janet, reached the middle of the street, and stopped
at once. He bent down and whispered to her, and sent her on to
McGarrah's. Pete Borders hadn't moved from the corner of the
Mountain House hotel. There was nothing good in Ollie Jacks; never
had been and never would be. If he got away from Herendeen now he
would be back in the hills again, once more rustling. Morgan knew
it, yet said: "Wait here, Ollie," and walked toward Herendeen.</p>

<p>The group around Herendeen gave ground as he came up. Lige White
said in a puzzled voice, "Don't interfere, Clay," and Gurd Grant
shook his head. They were all cattlemen and so was he; but they
felt a difference in him now and didn't like it. Ben Herendeen
remained against the locust tree. His round, long jaw ran back to
flat ears, to a tall forehead and close-cut sandy hair; he was no
older than Morgan, no more than twenty-nine, with a ruddy unlined
face, He was heavy and swell-chested. His chin threw the lower lip
over the upper, adding to the square bulldog cast of his
expression; and he hated Clay Morgan, and had hated him as far back
as boyhood.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "My daughter is in town. I don't want her
scared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Clay," said Lige White, "step over here a moment. I want to
explain something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Later, Lige. Not now."</p>

<p>Herendeen said in his bluntly unanswerable manner: "Everybody's
been talking about things being legal. So we made this legal and
see what happened. We won't make that mistake again. You're wrong,
Clay. Better get right."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Morgan. They saw him now as he seldom was,
the quick angles of his face showing up. The change was instant; he
had no smoothness, no reasonableness. What he said was a
challenge&mdash;he meant it that way and wanted them to know it. No
qualifications, no arguing. "As long as Janet is in town I want no
racket about this. If there is a racket I'll take care of the man
that made it." He swung around, speaking to Ollie Jacks. "You're
all right in town, Ollie. But when you leave, that's your
grief."</p>

<p>"Whoa!" said Herendeen. "I'll make what damned racket I
please."</p>

<p>Morgan came about fast enough to make Lige White jerk his head
aside. Morgan said: "All right, Ben. If you want it, you can have
it now."</p>

<p>It shocked everybody still, this challenge so unexpected and so
deadly in a quick-tempered country. It caught Herendeen with his
guard down. Charley Hillhouse's mouth fell open. Gurd Grant showed
Morgan a stunned wonder; and then everybody was waiting for
Herendeen to say the only thing he could say. Nobody accepted that
kind of talk. Herendeen stepped away from the locust tree, the
bright flame of anger in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll just go along with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jesse Rusey's voice, very soft and very sure, broke in:
"Nothin's goin' to happen to Ollie Jacks inside this town."</p>

<p>Herendeen turned at once. The marshal had come to the edge of
the group. He stood by, short and quite broad, with no change on
his face. Blood rushed to Herendeen's cheeks until they were a
dark-stained red. He gave Rusey a killing glance and looked over to
Ollie Jacks who remained by the saloon. Pete Borders had drifted
forward as far as Gentry's stable; he had the point of a shoulder
against the stable wall and he stared on with a latent, amused
insolence. Herendeen watched him a moment and then looked at Morgan
again. There was this long interval in which he had seen these four
men, Rusey, Ollie Jacks, Peter Borders, and Morgan; and after that
something changed in his head and his eyes showed a gray, heated
smartness. He spoke in a level voice.</p>

<p>"I've got some business to finish during the week, Morgan. When
that's done I'll see you. That is all I care to say."</p>

<p>"Fine," answered Morgan, and walked away. Behind him, the
astonished silence still held.</p>

<p>He passed the courthouse and went into the post office, rapping
at the wicket until Fred Rich came out of the back room.</p>

<p>"No notice yet on Government Valley?"</p>

<p>"No," said the postmaster.</p>

<p>"I want to know when it comes."</p>

<p>"I'll post it on one of the buildings in the valley. That's
regulation."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Morgan and turned to go. He met Lige White and Gurd
Grant at the doorway. They waved him back into the post office
lobby, both of them dead serious. Gurd Grant was a man close to
thirty, red-headed and pretty cool; Lige White was older. These two
operated outfits almost as large as Herendeen's; they were long
friends of Morgan but they were irritated with him now, and told
him so.</p>

<p>Lige White said: "You had no call to talk to Herendeen like
that. Now there's hell to pay. You know very well he'll have to
call you on those words. I want you to take this right, from
me&mdash;you were mighty foolish. Everybody knows you two boys
don't care much for each other, but that gives you no license to
insult him on this matter. What's Ollie Jacks to you, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered Morgan.</p>

<p>Lige White threw up his hands. "Then, why?"</p>

<p>Morgan only shook his head, still smiling. The smile further
irritated Lige White, who said: "You must be crazy. We've all got
to stick together. I don't know how we're going to do this, but
we'll have to patch up this quarrel somehow, Come over to the
saloon with me. We'll have a drink, and then maybe Gurd can get
Herendeen to join us. We can talk about it."</p>

<p>Morgan still held his cigar. He lighted it again, letting these
two wait for his answer. He said: "Ben Herendeen is pretty proud.
Damn a man that brings his outfit down here to scare hell out of
one small-time rustler. Tell him that."</p>

<p>Lige White said: "I never saw you this way before. There must be
something else."</p>

<p>"Maybe there is."</p>

<p>Lige White shrugged his shoulders. "All right, Clay. Your
funeral, not mine. Let's go, Gurd."</p>

<p>He watched them return to the group under the locust trees. Pete
Borders turned back from Gentry's stable and traveled along the
opposite walk. He looked over to Morgan, showing the latter a
deeply interested expression. This scene had puzzled him as much as
the others; he was trying to figure its meaning. Jesse Rusey hadn't
moved. Ollie Jacks still stood against the wall of the saloon, as
though tied hand and foot. The man was waiting out this long,
dangerous stretch of time, fearing the slightest motion. Herendeen
watched him, and the group around Herendeen held tight. Morgan
showed nothing on his face, but the feeling in him ran quick and
hard and restless, made so by the dragging suspense. Suddenly
Herendeen said something to Charley Hillhouse, who walked over to
Jesse Rusey. Hillhouse spoke a quiet word, whereupon Rusey shook
his head. Charley Hillhouse returned to Herendeen, carrying back
the message, and then Herendeen gestured with one arm and crossed
to the Long Grade, going inside. The group dissolved. Herendeen's
riders drifted into the street aimlessly, but Morgan saw that they
were still watching Ollie Jacks. There would be no trouble for a
little while, he guessed; he brought a fresh match to his
cigar.</p>

<p>Janet had gone into McGarrah's store, but all this while Hack
Breathitt remained in the middle of the street, missing none of the
scene. As soon as Herendeen entered the saloon Breathitt came over
to Morgan. Excitement brightened his restless blue eyes; the strain
of all this had kinked his nerves.</p>

<p>"I never saw you do that before, Clay."</p>

<p>"What were you standing out there for?" Morgan asked.</p>

<p>Hack showed a small, embarrassed grin. "What you think?"</p>

<p>"My grief&mdash;not yours, Hack."</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe not." But the small man shook his head. "You're
too smart to spout off like that unless you had it all figured out.
So you got something in your coco. I wish I knew. When you leaving
town?"</p>

<p>"After dinner."</p>

<p>"I'll stick around until then," said Hack dryly, and headed for
the saloon.</p>

<p>The sun was gone from desert and sky, leaving a soft blue-
running light behind. The supper triangle began to beat up its iron
clanging from the porch of the Mountain House hotel. The Red Canyon
stage rolled out of the hills, made a howling swing into Main
Street and stopped before the hotel in smoky eddies of dust. Morgan
left the post office doorway, still interested in the way the Three
Pines riders&mdash;Herendeen's outfit&mdash;scattered themselves
along the street. When he passed the hotel he saw Lige White's wife
standing in the doorway, a repressed expression on her face. He
stopped and removed his hat and spoke pleasantly; she was, he
thought, the most self-contained woman in the country. When she
smiled she became ten years younger, but as always, a shadow
remained in her eyes. Like worry, or like some unhappiness deeply
hidden. Janet had appeared at McGarrah's doorway and was calling
his name.</p>

<p>Mrs. White, who had no children of her own, said gently: "She
has the prettiest hair, Clay. I wish you'd let her stay with me
sometime."</p>

<p>"I'll ask her," said Clay Morgan. He turned over the dust, once
more running the street with his careful glance. A Three Pines man
stood by the post office corner, and one loitered at the arch of
Gentry's corral. Jesse Rusey wasn't to be seen. Ollie Jacks left
his spot by the saloon, crossed the street and walked beneath the
board awnings, as far as the hotel. He put his arm on the porch
rail. His head was lowered but Morgan saw his hat jerk a little.
The man was dead, even as his mind clawed at the thought of escape;
and he knew he was dead. A Three Pines rider walked by Morgan,
going down to the brick and dobe buildings of Old Town. From the
doorway of McGarrah's, Morgan watched that man turn and block the
way for Ollie Jacks. Ollie Jacks's arm slowly fell from the hotel's
porch rail; he swung around and started back for the stable,
walking as though a heavy weight pushed at his shoulders and at his
knees. Morgan caught one good glimpse of his face; it was thin and
old with strain.</p>

<p>Janet took his hand. They went on through the store, into the
back quarters. Yellow lamplight poured on the red-checkered
tablecloth, splintering brilliantly against the glass cruets. Ann
McGarrah was in the kitchen, dishing the meal; he passed on to the
rear porch, took off his coat and scrubbed away the riding dust.
When he returned to the dining room they were waiting for
him&mdash;Janet and Ann.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in his long riding hours, Clay Morgan's thoughts
turned to the puzzle of his future and always, in that pondering,
there came a time when he saw Ann McGarrah's face and heard the
even melody of her voice. Her eyes were deep brown, with stillness,
with depth. Black hair ran smoothly away from forehead and temples.
Her lips, red and expressive, could quickly smile, or could hold
the soft curve of soberness. He was never sure of her thinking,
never certain of what her eyes meant when she watched him, but the
slow gesturing of her hands and the small swing of her shoulders
displayed a grace that never ceased to capture his attention. She
never tired a man, she never asked anything of him. Always, when
she spoke, she held him gently distant.</p>

<p>"Like home," he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him carefully, "What should home be like? Men have
different notions."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Janet, "you would tell Daddy not to cut up my
meat. I'm nine years old now."</p>

<p>"I keep forgetting," said Morgan. "Hard for me to recall you're
practically a lady. Just a little while back, it seems, you were
in, a high chair, spilling milk. That's how time goes." He was
watching Janet and he was smiling, knowing that this reference to
babyhood always teased her. This was how Ann McGarrah best
remembered him, this was the side of him that made her still and
watchful and a little sad&mdash;this sight of this man idle in the
chair, loosened and idle and affectionately amused with his
daughter. He was big-boned and long-armed. There wasn't any fat on
him. The edge of his jaws were sharp against a heavy tanned skin
and his nose had a small break to the bridge. Most people in this
country were his solid friends but he had a few bitter enemies, and
to those he always showed the autocratic side of his heart, as he
had shown it to Ben Herendeen. This was the odd part about him, the
mixture of gentle patience and stiff independence. Few people knew
Clay Morgan as Ann McGarrah knew him, few had seen the
contradiction of his character; for with him, her eyes were patient
and her ears always listened. And she knew what almost nobody else
knew: This man had never forgotten, never would forget, his first
wife.</p>

<p>They ate, idly talking, idly arguing. The druggist's boy, Fred
Tanner, came to the back yard and called Janet's name. Janet moved
restlessly in her seat until Morgan nodded. As soon as she had
gone, Ann McGarrah said: "You'll be riding a lot this week. Let
Janet stay here."</p>

<p>Morgan smiled. "What is it this time, Ann?"</p>

<p>She said candidly: "A new dress, Clay. And her hair."</p>

<p>He said: "I guess there are some things I can't do for her."</p>

<p>"I can do those things for her. I like to. I want to." But when
she said this her manner changed and her eyes were cool and her
voice pushed him away. "I don't mean that the way it sounds. For
her, Clay. Not for you."</p>

<p>His head was lifted and he was listening to the thinned report
of a man's loud voice on the street; he was straight in his chair,
his mind and temper changing back to the world out there. She knew
what he was thinking, for she had been on the porch when he had
challenged Herendeen. She said in a subdued voice:</p>

<p>"I'm not surprised you were willing to quarrel with him. It goes
back a long way. You never forget anything."</p>

<p>He said, politely unrevealing: "What?"</p>

<p>"Clay," she said, "your memory is too long. Someday it will kill
you."</p>

<p>He bowed his head a little, as if in agreement. He had lighted a
cigar, holding it between his fingers while he listened. His
eyelids crept nearer and his lips rolled together in stubborn
fixture. Lamplight, sliding across the surface of his cheeks,
darkened and sharpened the reverse angles. She saw in him then
those things his friends loved&mdash;the tenacity and the
faithfulness that never wavered, and she saw, too, the things that
made his enemies hate him with such fullhearted bitterness. For as
he was a man to stay by his friends for good or bad to the very end
of time, so he was a man who returned dislike with an equal passion
and an equal ruthlessness. Qualities people loved, and qualities
they could hate&mdash;this was what she thought and kept her face
smooth so that he might not see how she felt. She had never dared
to let him see.</p>

<p>He got up, smiling at her. "Don't worry over my affairs."</p>

<p>"Not yours. You will always do as you want to do. Nobody will
ever be able to change your mind."</p>

<p>He said in some surprise, "Am I that unreasonable?"</p>

<p>"Not unreasonable, Clay," she reminded him. "Something different
than that. You just don't change. But there is one
thing&mdash;about Janet. What happens to her if you die?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>She rose and came around the table. She was near enough that she
had to lift her eyes. Her cheeks were colored by the room's heat.
"Clay," she said in a swift urgency, "there are only two people you
could be thinking of, if that happened. Think of me, then. I want
her."</p>

<p>He said, "Thanks for the supper, Ann," and walked on through the
store to the front porch. She followed him; she was beside him when
he paused on the street. Janet ran forward from the store's back
alley, out of breath and laughing. At this moment Morgan's interest
was wholly on the street. Ann McGarrah saw how closely he studied
the roundabout shadows. It was a carefulness that he had always
had, as though the need of it had been burned in him since the
beginning. Darkness rolled tidally down the hills, filling War
Pass. Lights glinted through window and doorway and made yellow
fanwise pools on the walks and the night breeze bore in sage scent
and pine scent from the upper country. The Burnt Ranch stage stood
before the hotel, ready to go. Morgan's attention clung to the dark
area around Gentry's corral a long while. Afterwards he said to
Janet: "You're staying here for a few days. Let's take a walk
before I start home."</p>

<p>Ann McGarrah knew where they were going. Paused by the store's
doorway, she watched these two, the tall shape of the man and the
slender figure of the girl side by side, go down into Old Town,
Janet's small hand gripping her father's. One light illumined them
a moment, then they were lost beyond Old Town as they walked toward
the cemetery. Ann McGarrah stood still; she put her hands together,
turned bitter by what she knew.</p>

<p>Beyond Old Town a creek came out of the hills and crossed under
the road with a liquid lapping. Past the creek the round- topped
wooden headboards of the cemetery glowed vaguely white under the
moonlight. Following the irregular row, Morgan stopped before his
wife's grave. Janet's hand gripped his fingers more tightly and she
stood quite close to him. There was a child's dread of the unknown
in her. He didn't want it to trouble her, so he said casually:
"Next time I come to town, we must cut the grass here and paint the
board again."</p>

<p>She said: "Do I look like her, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"When you are eighteen, Janet, you will look exactly as she
looked. That was the year we were married."</p>

<p>He heard her soft, long sigh. "It would be so nice to have a
mother."</p>

<p>This was the thing that hit him so hard, his daughter's
loneliness for a mother. He stood at the foot of the grave, with
his hat removed, thinking back to that long-gone night when Lila
Durrie, so full of life and laughter and recklessness, had smiled
to him across the dance hall's width, putting everything into her
round black eyes. At eighteen a man was like the blowing wind; he
had gone over, knowing there would be a fight. Ben Herendeen had
brought her to the dance and Ben Herendeen stood by, quietly
raging. When the music started Lila Durrie looked up at the sullen
Herendeen, laughed at him and took Clay Morgan's arm, dancing away.
At the doorway they had stepped out; down by the row of buggies, in
the bland black night, they had stood a moment, no longer cool and
no longer laughing. Even now Morgan remembered the sharpness, the
wild intensity of his feelings as he kissed her and heard her
whisper in his ears. "Clay&mdash;Clay, do you love me?" They had
gone immediately to his rig. At daylight in War Pass, forty miles
away, they were married.</p>

<p>Janet's fingers tugged at him. "Didn't you ever have a picture,
Daddy?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "She never had one taken."</p>

<p>There hadn't been time for a picture or for much of anything
else. At that time he owned a small ranch in the Lost Hills and ran
a few cows on it. This was where they set up housekeeping, a long
way from town, a long way from dances or from her friends. She had
been used to better things and couldn't help remembering it. She
was a stormy girl, so rash in anger, so quick to seek laughter, by
turns so terribly forlorn and so tempestuously happy. Four months
after their marriage Herendeen rode up to the place and stepped
from the saddle. From the far corner of the meadow, Clay had seen
this. When he reached the house Herendeen was laughing and she was
laughing but that laughter stopped soon enough, for Herendeen said:
"Why stick so close to the house, Clay? Don't you trust your
wife?"</p>

<p>Morgan drew the cigar from his mouth, feeling some of the fury
of that fight. He had rushed against Herendeen, hearing his wife's
scream of protest. Herendeen started laughing again, but when they
were finished, both exhausted and drained dry and badly beaten,
there was no amusement in Herendeen. That hurt still came back to
plague Morgan, even now; he remembered how he walked to the corral
and hung his elbows against it to keep from falling, and how
blindly Herendeen staggered toward his horse. He had whipped
Herendeen in that fight and yet he had lost; for, five months
later, shortly after Janet's birth, Lila had looked up from her
bed, white and strengthless, all her love gone, and whispered: "I
should tell you something, Clay. I made a mistake. It was Ben I
wanted to marry. You and I are not at all alike." And so she had
died.</p>

<p>He brought himself out of all this with effort and replaced his
hat. "I think," he told Janet, "we'd better go."</p>

<p>Janet reached down and patted the dust of her mother's grave,
murmuring, "Everybody says you were very beautiful."</p>

<p>He had turned away. But he turned back, holding the warm small
hand of his daughter within his own big fingers, knowing that in
his daughter's head was a wistful and wonderful image of her
mother&mdash;an image made out of a child's longing. Like a fairy
tale, he thought, that had to be bright and always fair. So he
said: "Yes, she was, Janet. There never was a mother like her. She
had black hair. It was very long and sunlight made it shine. Her
eyes were the same color as yours. She was never angry and never
afraid and she loved us both. When you were just three days old she
sang a song to make you sleep. The song was 'Ben Bolt.' She had a
lovely voice. You will be like her and you will always see her when
you look in the mirror."</p>

<p>She remained silent, drinking in his description, storing those
words in her retentive memory. She drew a long, pleased sigh; the
pressure of her hand grew greater on his fingers, and afterwards
they turned through Old Town, walking in silence. He had made her
happy.</p>

<p>He was thinking of this, pleased by her pleasure, when he saw a
low-bent and shadowy shape run from the alley adjoining the
Mountain House hotel and whip across the street toward Mike
Boylan's blacksmith shop. This was in the corner building of Old
Town, and Mike Boylan, late-working, had hung a lantern above the
shop's wide double-door. A saddle horse stood loose before Boylan's
rack, toward which the running man aimed. Farther up the street
somebody shouted a warning and a Three Pines rider rushed forward
from McGarrah's store. Slowly pacing forward toward Mike Boylan's
shop, Morgan identified the runner as soon as the latter entered
the yellow arc of the lantern's light. It was Ollie Jacks.</p>

<p>Ollie Jacks's breath was a lunging, painful sound in the night
as he rushed against the horse, threw himself into the saddle and
clawed at the reins. For a brief moment his face came around and
Morgan saw the constricted desperation on it; then Ollie Jacks
slashed the horse away from the blacksmith shop, turned into the
gap between Old Town and McGarrah's store, and raced downslope into
the desert.</p>

<p>Janet's hand gripped Clay Morgan's fingers. "What's the matter,
Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said, "nothing but Ollie Jacks having some fun."
He quickened his step, coming into the gap and halting there as a
pair of Three Pines men reached it. Herendeen arrived, saying: "Get
your horses," and then these men were facing Clay Morgan. One of
them had drawn his gun to take a shot at the retreating Ollie
Jacks. He held the gun half out of the holster, staring at Morgan,
but Ollie Jacks was gone and it was too late and he let the gun
drop back, shrugging his shoulders. Three Pines men were riding up
behind Herendeen and Herendeen's face was red and round.</p>

<p>The echo of Ollie Jacks's horse made a dying tattoo in the
blackness, out in the desert. Other Three Pines riders were rushing
from town by the stage road. Morgan said, courteous and quiet:
"Maybe Janet and I are in your way. We'll step aside."</p>

<p>"No," said Herendeen, rage running behind his false-cool tone.
"There is nothing to hurry about. There's a time for everything,
Clay. Good evening, Janet."</p>

<p>Janet said in her precise, little-woman's voice: "Good evening."
Morgan pulled her gently on to McGarrah's porch, Ann McGarrah
waited there. Part of the Three Pines crew galloped toward the
desert, after Ollie Jacks. Herendeen walked up the street, his
boots lifting dust.</p>

<p>Morgan said, "I'll ride along, honey. Be back in a few days. You
have a good time." He reached down and kissed her, feeling the
warmth of her hands as she held them at the back of his neck. He
was smiling as he straightened, smiling at Janet, and then at Ann
McGarrah's attentive eyes. Out on the desert a gun sounded, quick
and faint, and was echoed by two other shots. That was all. Ann
McGarrah saw the smile die and saw the flame of temper in his eyes.
They both knew Ollie Jacks was dead. Herendeen had respected
Morgan's challenge; that and nothing more. Morgan lifted his hat,
noting how Ann McGarrah's arm rested on Janet's shoulder. He said,
"Good night," and turned into the street.</p>

<p>Mrs. White was on the porch of the Mountain House, and called to
him in her even-calm voice: "If you see Lige at the Long Grade,
Clay, tell him I'm ready to go home."</p>

<p>"I'll see if I can find him," said Morgan. Walking slowly up the
street, he passed Rusey at the corner of the bank and noticed Pete
Borders in the post office shadows. He stepped into the Long Grade,
seeing most of the men of the town here, but not Lige White,
Charley Hillhouse slouched at a corner of the bar. Charley looked
at him, not moving. Afterwards Morgan went to his horse at Gentry's
and spoke to the hostler in the runway. "Take Janet's horse, Parr.
She's staying in town."</p>

<p>He wanted a word with Hack Breathitt, but Hack wasn't around,
and so he followed the upper road from War Pass, passing into a
brief stand of pine. Two or three houses lay back in these trees.
When he came by one of them&mdash;Mrs. Benson's house&mdash;he saw
the glint of a cigarette on the shadow-blackened porch and heard
Lige White quietly laughing. Mrs. Benson was there, suddenly
suppressing her voice. The road bent away from the pines and
dropped into the Powder Desert and a little wind rolled out of the
south. Clay Morgan rode on, thinking of Mrs. White on the porch of
the Mountain House hotel, a proud woman with old hurt shadowing her
eyes. He knew what the hurt was.</p>

<p>After Morgan had gone Mrs. White went into the stuffy red plush
stillness of the women's parlor of the hotel. She sat straight in a
chair, hands folded, her eyes sightlessly fixed to a far wall.
Across the hall was the hotel's bar, and now and then, though she
was too deep in her own thoughts to give much heed, she heard the
burst of men's laughter. The night stage to Rhett's Station, nine
hours over the hills from War Pass, came to the front of the hotel,
and, a half hour later, went away. This was eight o'clock. At ten
o'clock, still seated in the chair, close-mouthed and proud, she
saw Lige White come to the parlor door. He had been drinking and
his black hair curled down from his forehead, giving him an air of
amused humor. At forty-five he still held his youthful attraction
and at forty-five he still kept his perfect manners toward her. She
went by him, out to the rig, and sat in silence as he trotted the
team from War Pass toward the ranch, fifteen miles away. She had
her hands folded in her lap, she held her head straight, so that he
couldn't see how swiftly her eyes sought Mrs. Benson's house when
they passed it. Once, in that fifteen miles he said, courteously:
"Tired?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Near midnight Hack Breathitt, tiring of the Long Grade, came
down to the bar of the Mountain House for his last drink. Finished
with it, he stepped into the center hall, not yet knowing whether
he would put up here for the night or ride out. A little drunk, he
paused to think of it and at last turned, choosing to ride out. As
he left the Mountain House, Helen Lavalle came to the window of her

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. ROUNDUP FIRES</h2>

<p class="first">CLAY MORGAN ate breakfast by lamplight and was in
the saddle before day crossed the eastern hills. Harry Jump and Cap
Vermilye were at roundup in the Haycreek Hills, leaving only Mose,
too old for such riding, and the Mexican cook, Pancho, on the
ranch. Morgan said to Mose: "I'll probably be back after dark. Put
some new crosspieces on the front gate&mdash;it's coming apart,"
and set forth southward across his range. At this elevation the
night air was sharp enough to bite through his vest and cotton
shirt. The big bay horse shot away on a run. Morgan let him have
his run.</p>

<p>Mogul's rim lay two miles north, behind him. The ranch house and
its corrals and barns sat at the foot of the rising Mogul Hills,
which ran straight south; along the base of these hills, following
the ruts of a casual road, Clay Morgan took his way. To his left, a
half mile, another string of hills lifted up, so creating the long
and narrow valley he followed. This was his range, emerging slowly
from the ink-gray twilight. The bed of a small dry lake began to
show its spotless white glitter ahead. Here and there a streak of
green ran down the hillsides, indicating summit springs. At the
base of these green spots, in the valley, stood square stacks of
cut hay. Elsewhere, the low- growing bunchgrass, dried by the heat
of summer and fall, painted the valley and the hillsides
amber-yellow. A band of antelope, disturbed by the sound of
Morgan's horse, raced down the hillside, crossed before him with
the speed of wind and struck the lake bed in great clouds of
ripped-up dust, the signal patches of their rumps showing whitely.
When first sunlight burst across the eastern peaks Morgan was six
miles down the valley and at the end of his own range. A small
ridge lay in front of him; at the summit he reined in to look at
the round bowl of Government Valley.</p>

<p>Once it had been a reservation for the Piutes and the site of a
military post to guard the trail between California and the Montana
mines. Now the Indians were gone and the military post was an
abandoned row of dobe houses partly destroyed by the intrusion of
wintering cattle. A creek crossed it, flowing through a gap into
Herendeen's Three Pines. Both he and Herendeen grazed their beef on
it, though it was still held by the Government. There had been talk
recently that the land office meant to post auction notices on it,
which was why Clay Morgan had spoken to the postmaster in War Pass.
It was a choice, rich section and a valuable addition to any man's
outfit. Dropping into the valley, be quartered toward the abandoned
buildings to see if a notice of sale might be on them; and finding
nothing, he crossed the amber grassy floor, surmounted another
small ridge and saw the mixed flats and broken hills of Herendeen's
range butting into the distant Potholes. More westerly, in the
mountain country, lay Gurd Grant's Crowfoot. Eastward, out on the
flat glitter of the open desert, was the outline of the windmill on
Lige White's Running W. Morgan saw dust boiling near the Potholes,
which was the roundup crew at work; he turned that way.</p>

<p>Ducking in and out of the small ravines of the land he came upon
cattle and young stuff occasionally grazing, herding these before
him and throwing them back toward the roundup crew. Three men were
working this section&mdash;Charley Hillhouse and two other Three
Pines hands. He drove his small collection of beef into the held
bunch and started on another circle, Hillhouse accompanying him.
Around ten o'clock, having dragged the north end, they started the
held bunch back for the main roundup.</p>

<p>The sun was a copper-red flare in the middle sky and the dust
began to thicken behind the herd. Morgan dropped back to the drag,
throwing his neckpiece over his nose. Charley Hillhouse, on a flank
of the beef, motioned one of the other men to take his place and
joined Morgan and made his first speech in two hours.</p>

<p>"I been thinkin' over last night, Clay. Hard to figure."</p>

<p>"Let it slide, Charley."</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse retorted, "It won't slide," and stared before
him. He was a compact, capable man, not given to much talk; the
type to worry a lot of things around in his head, to reach his own
answers and hold his own conclusions. A Three Pines rider pushed
against the flank of the straying herd, yipping, "Hi-hi-hi!"
Charley Hillhouse's clever horse shot in against the rear of the
beef, checking a bolt, and then Charley came beside Morgan again,
still staring in front of him.</p>

<p>"A man's got to stick with his kind, Clay. Ollie Jacks was a
crook. Why take his side?"</p>

<p>"A break, Charley."</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse had a dry answer for that. "He had his break a
long time ago&mdash;and didn't take it. A crook's always a
crook."</p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed Morgan. "But last night when he came out of the
courthouse I got to thinking&mdash;it might have been me, or
you."</p>

<p>Hillhouse, disgruntled by the unpredictable side of a man who
had been his friend for so many years, took this last remark almost
as an affront. "Don't talk like that. If I ever get on the wrong
side of the line, I hope God strikes me dead. Right's right and
wrong's wrong. You should stay out of the dirty messes men like
Ollie Jacks make for themselves. I don't like to hear you go
soft."</p>

<p>Morgan was smiling behind the bandanna; the reflection of it
showed in his eyes and in the quick crow-track wrinkles at the edge
of his temples. He murmured: "All right, Charley. I'll change the
tune, when I see Herendeen."</p>

<p>"Be a mighty bitter tune," commented Hillhouse, "for one of you.
I will say no more."</p>

<p>They pushed the beef down a ravine and out into a flat plain
upon which lay the dust smoke of cattle approaching from all points
of the compass. A chuck wagon and a string of horses on picket
showed in the foreground. Beyond it men rode through a held bunch
of cattle, neatly cutting out the calves for branding and throwing
the cows of the various outfits into each outfit's separate bunch.
There was a bawling and a bleating through all this boiling dust,
and the smell of scorched hair and hide, and the resounding
firecracker rattle of a man's cursing.</p>

<p>These roundups were always short-handed. Morgan took his place
with Lige White, snaking calves out of the herd, dumping and
dragging them to the brand fire and afterwards shagging them off to
their proper bunches&mdash;Three Pines, Crowfoot, Long Seven, or
Running W; there were, additionally, a couple of reps from ranches
farther away to take care of cattle which had strayed into this
range. Everybody worked. Somewhere around noon men left the dust to
eat a quick meal, and ran back into the dust again. Herendeen, with
two of his crew, rode out of the south and with a fresh batch, ate
his meal and went away; he had not directly looked at Clay Morgan.
Gurd Grant came in from the hill country, driving everything he saw
before him. Lige White's men were combing the desert over by
Fanolango Pass. When the dust got too bad they hit the cook's
coffeepot and dashed back at the job. Every few hours the cutting
men took fresh horses from the picket line.</p>

<p>Lige White's eyes were bloodshot and he didn't feel in the best
of spirits. He said to Morgan: "I'm old enough to know better than
to drink a quart of rye in one night. But, dammit, when a man
starts tapering off it means he's getting old&mdash;and I hate to
admit it. Fat cows, this year. How's Janet?"</p>

<p>"Fine. I left her in town."</p>

<p>"Damned pretty girl. Well, you're lucky, Clay. Mighty nice to
have a youngster to ride the trail with, watchin' him grow and
tellin' him what you know about things. I used to think that if I
had a boy I'd sure show him the world. Hear the old owl hoot and
listen to the cougar scrape his whiskers on the tent wall. Shake
the frost off our blankets and ride the rim to see daylight come. I
wish I had that boy."</p>

<p>It was, Clay Morgan knew, a sore spot in this handsome, likable
Lige White&mdash;that he had no son. It was on his mind a good deal
and he often spoke of it whenever he thought of Janet; any child
drew his attention and his charming smile. He was always praising
Janet and always wanting to buy her candy in his large-handed way.
He was a man who had to put his affections somewhere. Through the
middle of his sweaty, dusty afternoon's work, Morgan thought about
this intensely human streak in Lige White which seemed to find no
outlet; then he remembered Mrs. White's set and calm expression and
her quiet voice&mdash;and the misery of her eyes.</p>

<p>Herendeen and his men cleared the Haycreek Hills of the last
straggling stock; Gurd Grant cleaned up the edge of the Potholes
and came in. Running W had scoured Fanolango Pass, and at twilight
this day the job was done, the brands segregated and held in
separate herds. After supper Morgan started Harry Jump back to the
Mogul range with the Long Seven beef, and the Crowfoot and Running
W cuts went away, lumbering shadows in the moonlight, the scrape of
feet and the click of those long horns and the plaintive "Baw" of
the last calf riding back through the night-still air.</p>

<p>Dust and heat were gone and the campfire's flame, so still was
this air, tapered upward to a blue-yellow, almost stationary point.
Charley Hillhouse, who was wagon boss, said: "We'll move over and
work the Antelope Plains tomorrow."</p>

<p>The cook swore around the shadows, harnessing his team.
Afterwards the mess wagon went bumping away on its four-hour ride,
to be ready on the Antelope Plains by daybreak. Lying on his
blanket, head athwart the seat of his saddle, Clay Morgan listened
to the dry groaning of the wagon wheels fade into this enormous
night. He rolled a cigarette and savored its keen smell. Stars
crowded the sky; they washed that limitless sweep of black with a
diamond-glitter, all down to the black horizon's edge, until they
seemed to fall below the rim of a flat world. Here and there in the
pine summits coyotes began to hark up their mourning plaint,
"Ar-ar-oo-oo." Hillhouse and Clay Morgan and Lige White sat by the
fire, their cheeks sharply, taciturnly graved by light and shadows;
and men lay blanketed in the background, weary and relaxed and
cradled by their inward thinking, Herendeen walked forward from the
shadows to stand high above this sprawled group. He tossed a sage
stem into the fire and watched the pale and heatless flame rise. He
was across from Clay Morgan; his eyes searched the crowd. The edges
of his vest fell away from the rounds of his shoulders and the deep
stretch of his chest; his bigness was all in proportion, legs and
arms and torso; it was a muscular bigness, a bigness of thick
bones.</p>

<p>Cap Vermilye was a Long Seven man, the oldest rider of the lot
and the most prolific storyteller. He said now, from the
background: "Reminds me of a time in the Staked Plains. This was in
Seventy-eight&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ben Herendeen broke in as if Cap Vermilye hadn't spoken.</p>

<p>"Lige," he said, "I hear there's a new homesteader come to the
spring Jim Spackman used to squat on."</p>

<p>"I heard so," said Lige White.</p>

<p>Cap Vermilye said no more and for a moment the silence was deep
and different. A swift spark lighted Clay Morgan's resentment at
Herendeen's intolerant interruption. He sat slowly up; he was near
enough the fire to be seen. Charley Hillhouse turned his head
suddenly to watch Morgan, a small crease of worry showing between
his eyes.</p>

<p>"We'll warn him out of there tomorrow," said Herendeen.</p>

<p>But when he stopped talking Clay Morgan knew he wasn't finished.
Herendeen's thoughts were on his face, for everybody to see. "Or
maybe we've got some great big soul in this crowd whose heart
bleeds for people like that. Seems to be a hell of a lot of charity
around here lately."</p>

<p>Morgan swayed forward to lift a burning sage stem from the fire;
its oil-bright glow flickered against his cheeks, against his eyes.
This silence held its waiting and its reserve. Morgan tossed the
sage stem back into the fire, drawing a sharp glance from Charley
Hillhouse. Lige White uncomfortably crossed his feet. Gurd Grant
crouched by the blaze and revealed nothing on his scrupulously
neutral face. Morgan relaxed gently on his shoulder blades and
pillowed his head against the saddle. He said nothing but he saw
the changing expression of Herendeen's cheeks. Herendeen had braced
himself for trouble, he had maneuvered this talk around to make a
break; but nothing happened and he stood a moment, uncertain and
displeased, and afterwards walked away. He called back. "I'll see
you tomorrow, Lige, You too, Gurd." Presently he left camp at a
dead run.</p>

<p>Rolled in the blanket, Morgan smoked the cigarette to its end.
When he had finished, the fire was a vague glow of ashes and the
night's cold had crept in from the sky.</p>

<p>Instead of turning west to his own ranch, Herendeen traveled due
south toward a low range of hills which separated Running W from
Three Pines. An hour's ride brought him within sight of a
far-shining light, which was the mark of a bomesteader's cabin
against the hills; but when he came upon the homesteader's cabin,
drifting into the heavy shadows at the base of these hills, a dog
began to bark and suddenly the light died. He reined in before the
cabin, feeling his contempt for the evident fear which had caused
the homesteader to kill the light. They were all alike, these
homesteaders, little men crawling as near the range as they dared,
sticking their plows into the unplowed soil and slowly starving
while the sun burnt up their crops and ruined the land ever
afterward for graze. He could not tolerate this breed, or their
sun-blackened wives, or their tow-headed children. They were
aliens. They were no better than Indians. He sent his deep, blunt
call at the shack. "Hey&mdash;come out here."</p>

<p>They were talking, inside. A boy's voice said, "Pa, don't go." A
woman was talking, quickly and with suppressed excitement. The door
squealed open and somebody stood in its black square,
speechless.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" demanded Herendeen. "This place is on
Lige White's range. We drove Jim Spackman away from it last
year."</p>

<p>"You Lige White?" said a man in a dim, drawn voice.</p>

<p>"What the hell is that to you? My name's Herendeen and I asked
you a question."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the man. "I'm Jack Gale. I bought Jim Spackman's
rights to this place."</p>

<p>"He never had any rights to sell."</p>

<p>"He built the house, Mr. Herendeen." Then the man added,
quietly, "It's free land, ain't it? I understood it was. I also
understood Mr. White wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>Herendeen was nettled by the argument. "You damned nesters are
all alike, trying to stand on this free-land business. You stick
your plow into it and ruin it, and starve to death, and steal
cattle to keep your kids alive, and move away. We're not in the
game of providin' meat to nesters."</p>

<p>"I'll make my way," said Gale, peaceably, "and I don't ask for
nobody's beef. I want no trouble."</p>

<p>"You got a fence around that spring?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gale reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Sure," grunted Herendeen. "Now you pull that fence down and you
get out of this country by the end of the week."</p>

<p>For a moment Gale didn't answer. His breath sighed into the
darkness and his feet scraped the doorsill. Spring water, dropping
down the hillside, bubbled across the yard. Then Gale said in a
halting, softening tone: "I don't see why&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herendeen said, "I don't want any argument. You hear?" Gale's
wife called from the interior of the house. "Jack, come in here.
Come in." Herendeen heard her run over the floor. She caught hold
of her husband and these two were gently wrestling around the
doorway with Gale saying, "Now, Allie, stop it&mdash;stop it." But
she pulled him inside and slammed the door: A child, very young,
began to cry in a thin, startled rhythm. Herendeen pushed his horse
over the yard, bound away for his ranch. The foot of the horse
struck a loose pail, and this racket excited the beast and set him
into a quick pitching. Herendeen slashed his spurs into the horse
and fought him around the yard. The horse bucked sidewise, smashed
into the wall of the shack, hard enough to stir it on its flimsy
foundations. Herendeen swung the horse with the pressure of his big
knees. He was angry in his quick, thoroughly destructive manner. He
bawled: "By God, you be out of here by the end of the week or I'll
burn you out!" and plunged his spurs into the horse again, rushing
across the desert. Behind him was absolute silence. The baby had
ceased crying suddenly, as though a hand had reached over its mouth
to stifle it.</p>

<p>Leaving War Pass, Hack Breathitt fell into the Cache Mountains
south of town and went nighthawking along the dimly starlit trails
until he felt the need of sleeping; and so made camp and slept.
Next day, controlled by no particular desire or fancy, he cruised
the hills, as familiar with each gulch and each meadow and ridge as
a man is familiar with the rooms and hallways of his house. These
hills rolled upward to piny, cool crests beyond which, westward,
lay another land of long distances; arrived at the summit he had
his look and turned back, liking his own land too well to stray. In
this timber he passed Three Pines cattle at graze; far southward he
came upon a nester's house, and beyond that arrived at the clearing
of a small two-bit rancher by the name of Vance Ketchell. He had
noon meal here, discussed the weather and traveled on; once, from a
prow of these benchlands, he stood long enough to watch the scatter
of houses, corrals and barns marking Herendeen's ranch, lying
beside a shallow stream, lying between the short walls of a canyon.
From the elevation he was able to look beyond that canyon to
Grant's ranch at the base of the Haycreek Hills, Far up in Mogul,
to the rear of other gray-cut hills, lay Clay Morgan's range. Below
him, in Herendeen's valley, dust rose on the winding road, kicked
up by a team. From this distance it looked like Mike Levi's
storewagon; Mike made the rounds with an unfailing regularity,
selling almost anything, needles and vanilla extract and cheap
stock saddles and veterinary remedies.</p>

<p>It was all a part of a warm-bright summer's day. Hack Breathitt
came down the bench into Herendeen's valley; though at a distance
from the ranch, crossed over and lost himself in the broken,
pine-covered ridges at the base of Mogul. Magpies flashed black and
white ahead of him; at Dell Lake, a miniature pond of water
surrounded by tules, he saw a few ducks bobbing. Still higher on
the edge of Mogul he looked back to see the Burnt Ranch stage wind
upgrade from the southwestern desert, tip over the lip of a low
pass near Dell Lake and go on toward War Pass in funneling clouds
of dust.</p>

<p>As he followed the net of trails leading upward to the Mogul,
Hack Breathitt had no cares and no serious thoughts. This was a
fine, warm day. Ahead of him on the pine-shadowed trail occasional
golden shafts of sunlight slanted through the tree tops. Here and
there a swirl of dust showed where an antelope had been a moment
before. The silence was thick and held its rank scent of resin; and
at intervals Hack sang incomplete bits of such songs as he knew,
the sound of that going out around him in widening waves. Dusk
caught him in this rough land, still without any thought of
discretion; at full dark he turned a bend of the trail and saw
firelight pulse against the side of a near-by ravine. He turned
into the ravine and, being a smart young man, he called ahead of
him to disturb nobody's nerves:
"Hello&mdash;hello&mdash;hello!"</p>

<p>The fire, he found, was at the base of a bare rock wall running
up the side of Mogul. A spring broke out of the mountain here and
trees crowded down from adjacent ridges. There wasn't anybody
within the range of firelight, but Hack reined in and held his
seat, knowing that somebody had stepped into the shadows and was
watching him. A moment later Pete Borders came forward.</p>

<p>"You make enough racket to raise the dead, Hack. Pull off your
saddle if you ain't goin' any place."</p>

<p>Hack said, indolently amused: "Now where would I be goin'?" He
stepped to the ground and relieved the horse of its gear. He
watered it, put it out on picket; he had his own frying pan and
coffeepot and presently was crouched at the fire with Borders,
cooking up his quick meal.</p>

<p>Borders said: "Nothin' new?"</p>

<p>"A man," reflected Breathitt, "that never goes any place never
hears anything."</p>

<p>They ate and lay back from the small blaze, each man alternately
throwing in a small pine branch when the fire burned down. Hack was
sprawled full length, propped on an elbow, nursing his cigarette.
Borders sat crosslegged, a long-limbed man made loosely of wire and
rope. He was red-headed and his eyes were the restless eyes of a
man quick and untrusting and very curious. "Hack," he said, "whut
you ride so much for?"</p>

<p>"Doctor's orders," said Breathitt and softly laughed.</p>

<p>Borders shook his head. "You got a bad doctor. Time's comin'
when fellows like you and me ain't going to be safe sittin' around
a fire this way."</p>

<p>Breathitt said, with a pointed humor: "There's a difference
between you and me, Pete. I just ride."</p>

<p>"It won't make any difference, my boy," argued Pete Borders.
"Good or bad, if Herendeen gets nervous, you ain't going to ride
this country."</p>

<p>That talk set off something familiar in Hack's mind. He said,
gently. "The sheep and the goats. Sure. I guess I'm one of the
goats."</p>

<p>"See?" said Borders. "That's whut I mean."</p>

<p>He tossed a fresh stick into the fire, the flare of it
heightening the rusty shine of his hair. He had a dry, smart face;
double wrinkles crossed his forehead. His eyes, on the edge of
being green, were narrow-bright. He had been watching the livid
heart of the flame, but his head rose and his eyes stared into the
surrounding darkness. He was a tight, close-listening shape; and
presently he rose and stepped into the shadows.</p>

<p>Somebody rode along the near-by trail slowly, and stopped. Hack
Breathitt held his position, too clear of conscience to move. He
poised the cigarette between his fingers, hearing the rider poke up
the ravine. The rider said, "Just me&mdash;just old Parr Gentry
lookin' for horses."</p>

<p>He came to the fire, this owner of the livery stable in War
Pass. He rolled in the saddle, staring down at Hack Breathitt a
long moment before recognizing him. "Why, hello, Hack. Didn't know
I'd find you on this side of the Mogul. Thought you liked the other
side best."</p>

<p>"Any side's all right," drawled Breathitt. Parr Gentry shifted
his weight again, a little heavy to find comfort in his saddle. His
face, by firelight, was round and solid-fleshed and darkly dull.
His eyes rummaged this little clearing and saw Pete Borders' saddle
and blanket on the far edge of the fire&mdash;and the two horses
picketed near the spring. Breathitt realized Gentry knew Borders'
horse. He held his silence, he took a drag on the cigarette. "Late
for you, ain't it, Parr?"</p>

<p>"Been draggin' this section all day, lookin' for horses. You
seen a band around there?"</p>

<p>"Wild ones? They'd be clear to the top of Mogul in this
weather."</p>

<p>"Lookin' for tracks," murmured Gentry. "Thought they might come
down for water. Well, I'll be goin'. Long way to War Pass." He
wheeled about, groaning softly as he went away. Breathitt listened
to the man's horse reach the trail and scuff along it, and at last
fade in the night.</p>

<p>Pete Borders stepped into the light. His face showed its smart
disbelief. "He's been chasin' horses long enough to know why they
ain't down here. And he wasn't pointed for War Pass when he left,
either." Afterwards he added: "Didn't want to show myself. Won't do
you any good to be seen campin' with me, old boy."</p>

<p>"He saw your horse."</p>

<p>Borders shook his head. He settled in his blanket just beyond
the light; the fire died away and a small breeze rolled down the
face of Mogul. Into this heart of quietness the spring dropped
bubbling, crystal echoes. Borders said: "When a man's goin' to be
chased like a wolf, my boy, he ought to get some meat for it.
You're missin' a chance. There's a hell of a lot of cows in this
country."</p>

<p>Breathitt threw the stub of his cigarette into the fire and
settled on his blanket. He lay flat on his shoulder blades, staring
at the ragged patch of sky above him. Not answering, he thought of
a good many things at this moment; and saw no future for
himself.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. CATHERINE</h2>

<p class="first">AT daybreak Clay Morgan rode as far as the
Antelope Plains with the roundup crew and worked with it until
mid-morning. Afterwards he set off to have a look at the grass and
water on the western edge of the Moguls. Gurd Grant, having
business at his own ranch, went along, Gurd was a big and
completely friendly man of Morgan's age with light features and a
consistently pleased expression in his eyes. There was no malice
and no subterfuge of any kind in Gurd, But now, as he rode, he
spoke in a rather troubled, uncertain way of Herendeen.</p>

<p>"You knew, Clay, he ain't such a bad fellow. I hate to see you
two start chewing the same piece of leather. Of course, you never
did like each other. I can remember as far back as school when you
and Ben get in some pretty tough jangles." He gave Clay a
half-embarrassed glance. "I can also remember when you married
Lila." He was on dangerous ground, and realized it, and cut off his
remark with one brief addition. "That's part of your trouble with
Ben, too."</p>

<p>Morgan didn't answer. He traveled with his glance thrown far
ahead and there was nothing on his face for Gurd Grant to see. The
tall fellow had this way of covering up, by silence and by a kind
of indrawn composure, Gurd Grant said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But we've all get to stick together, Clay. You been over to
that Freewater settlement lately?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ride over sometime, You'll see a let of little trails coming
out of the mountains to it. What made these trails? Your beef and
mine and Lige White's and Herendeen's. That's supposed to be a
bunch of homesteaders over there. Hell, they're a bunch of brand
changers. They're living off us, and making a mighty prosperous
thing of it, too. Ben wants to stop that. So do I. So do you,
That's right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not sure," said Morgan, quietly.</p>

<p>"Why, hell," grumbled Gurd Grant, "what's wrong with a cattleman
fighting for his rights?"</p>

<p>Morgan shifted in the leather. "This is what's wrong," he said.
"Ben Herendeen never had any brains and never will."</p>

<p>"Don't let an old quarrel get you off on the wrong foot," argued
Gurd Grant. "The important thing is to stick together. We got to do
that."</p>

<p>"Gurd," said Morgan, turning toward his partner, "I want to warn
you. Ben's the kind of a fellow that gets worse the farther he
goes. Maybe he'll start by chasing a few crooks out of the country.
But he won't stop there. He'll get the idea that nobody has any
rights unless they're riding close to him. When he does that, he'll
start a first-class war&mdash;and you'll be the goat, Stay clear of
it, Gurd."</p>

<p>"We've got to stick together," insisted Gurd,</p>

<p>Riding on through the short hills, they came to Crowfoot's
quarters seated in a small round valley backed against the Haycreek
Hills. A creek, charging out of the pine timber, crossed the meadow
in front of a low, long-galleried white house surrounded by poplar
trees. The two dismounted in this pleasant shade and went back to
the dining room for a late noon meal. They were still at the table
when a single rider came out of the hill trail at a full gallop. A
moment later Catherine Grant appeared.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," she said, "you are both very solemn."</p>

<p>Gurd Grant held his seat with a brother's habitual indifference
but Clay Morgan rose at once before this laughter- loving girl with
the gay and gently blue eyes. This was Catherine Grant, who, with
her brother Gurd, ran Crowfoot. She was dressed in a full dark
riding skirt. A small hat lay atop a mass of hair the color of red
and copper; the run had whipped her cheeks pink, it had lifted her
spirits and turned her vitally alive. She had long, full, firm
lips: she was tall for a woman, with self- reliant shoulders. The
riding skirt pulled tightly at her hips, shewing the depth and the
roundness of her upper body. She had one glance for her brother,
slanting and a little amused; and a show of quick pleasure at Clay
Morgan's presence.</p>

<p>"Once," she reflected, "there was a man named Morgan. He lived
on top of a mountain and never did come down, He grew a beard, so
they say, and get the habit of talking to himself. I wonder
whatever happened to him?"</p>

<p>"Crazy as always," said Gurd. "And quit running your horse down
that trail, you hear?"</p>

<p>She didn't hear. She stood in front of Clay, stripping away her
riding gloves&mdash;smiling and watching his answering smile break
the solid healthy darkness of his face. Gurd Grant sat as an
interested and forgotten spectator to this scene, quick to note his
sister's instant gaiety in front of Clay, and Clay's lightening
expression. There always had been an odd closeness between these
two people. Sometimes, as now, that closeness puzzled him and
sometimes bothered him; he never could get at its meaning. All he
knew was that whenever they met they seemed to share some old
memory which excluded everybody else, as now. He rose and left the
room.</p>

<p>The cook brought Catherine her meal. She sat opposite Clay,
eating a little and talking a little. Clay lighted a smoke. He
braced his elbow on the table, chin propped in his long, heavy
hand. "Your hair," he said, "is getting darker."</p>

<p>"That's gray you see. Gray from worry."</p>

<p>"When you were eighteen it was almost a carrot red."</p>

<p>She said: "I remember you said that once, a long time ago. It
almost made me cry. I came home and wondered if I could dye
it."</p>

<p>"We used to talk pretty straight, didn't we? We had some tall
quarrels."</p>

<p>She gave him a straight, smileless look. "Why did we ever
quarrel, Clay?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said, "it was because we always stuck together and
had so damned much fun." He wasn't sure of what he wished to say.
This girl was a close, deep part of his life. Once, she had been
nearer to him than any other woman. Some of that old feeling
remained, so that when he sat by her now he had a feeling of
pleasant ease; knowing that he had to explain nothing to her,
knowing that she understood. He said: "When a fellow is pretty
young, he's not apt to think of other people's feelings. I'd as
soon cut off a hand as to hurt you, Catherine."</p>

<p>She looked down at the motionless shape of her hands on the
table. "I think I like you better when you're not so polite. The
quarrels were pretty real. We meant what we said." And then she met
his glance. "Well, it is nice to remember that you were once so
angry that you wanted to rough me up."</p>

<p>He couldn't hold back his grin. "Did that once, too."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, so gently, "you did, once."</p>

<p>This room was shaded and cool. Outside the hot drowse of
afternoon lay over the land and Gurd Grant's voice, speaking to
some hand by the corrals, echoed distinctly across the drowsy
quiet. Catherine said: "How's Janet?"</p>

<p>"In good health. I left her in town for a few days with Ann
McGarrah."</p>

<p>Catherine Grant's composed expression didn't change. "You should
let her visit with women as much as you can, Clay. A girl needs
that."</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to notice it."</p>

<p>Catherine said: "She looks enough like Lila to startle me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Clay. "Well, it is still a long ride home." But for
a moment he held his place, finding complete satisfaction in
Catherine Grant's presence. His own life was rather rough, and
rather bare; it helped a good deal to watch the color of
Catherine's hair and the soft lines of her lips, to hear the melody
of her voice. She was a graceful, competent girl, with warmth to
her and strong feelings behind her laughter&mdash;and a pride that
he had often hurt, though she had never told him. He didn't say
anything. He watched her over the width of the table, he held the
steady return glance of her eyes; and this went on until he felt
some of the heat of those earlier days when he had ridden with her
and danced with her and kissed her, and had felt the soft, wild,
half-giving and half-refusing strength of her body.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose and turned away, knowing what was in his mind.
He left the table, following her out to the house porch. He said:
"See you later, Catherine."</p>

<p>"All right, Clay."</p>

<p>She stood on the porch, watching him go. At the far lip of the
meadow he turned and lifted a hand; and afterwards his body swung
with the long rocking chair canter of his horse and the trail
carried him into the timber.</p>

<p>Gurd came around the house. He said to his sister in a teasing
amused voice: "Rakin' up the ashes on an old fire?"</p>

<p>"Hush."</p>

<p>"You two," commented Gurd, "used to be pretty thick. Before Lila
came along. I always wondered how thick?"</p>

<p>She straightened against the porch post and showed him a self-
contained expression. Gurd laughed a little, seeing his sister
close up on him, and ceased to laugh, when he thought of something
else. "I don't like the way he's acting. He won't talk to Ben."</p>

<p>"No," said Catherine. "He never will."</p>

<p>"It was something that had to do with Lila and Ben, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Never mind, Gurd,"</p>

<p>Gurd said irritably: "He came damned near a fight with Ben in
War Pass&mdash;over Ollie Jacks. He just scraped by a quarrel with
Ben last night out on the roundup. It won't do. We've got to stick
together. I don't like the way he hangs off. If it was any other
man I'd say he was too thick with the thieves. Ben's all right.
There's no reason Clay should be so tough about Ben. One of these
days they'll wind up in a hell of a battle."</p>

<p>Catherine murmured: "It has been a long while coming."</p>

<p>Gurd cast a speculative glance at her. "You know a lot about
Clay."</p>

<p>She showed him that old composed expression again. The quick
ruffle of horses' hooves turned her against the porch post and in
this attitude she watched Herendeen and Lige White cross the
meadow. When they reached the porch Lige White lifted his hat with
the gallant flourish he could never escape. Herendeen simply
stepped down, saying: "Want to see you, Gurd."</p>

<p>"Come in and eat," said Gurd hospitably.</p>

<p>Herendeen said, "Had my meal already," and stopped by Catherine.
This was when he thought to remove his hat. He dipped his heavy
cropped head at her. He pulled his tremendous shoulders together;
it was an unconscious gesture that turned him into a solid, huge
shape. He said: "Why don't we go into War Pass some night,
Catherine, and paint the town?"</p>

<p>"Some night."</p>

<p>He extended a hand and caught the sleeve of her riding habit
between his flat balled fingers, rubbing the fabric together; the
pressure swayed her a little from the porch post, light as he meant
it to be. He said in a thoughtful way: "Pretty," and went on into
the house with the other two men.</p>

<p>They sat down in the drowsy shade of the living room.</p>

<p>Lige White looked around, chuckling over a sudden fancy. "I
remember how your mother used to receive visitors here. A very
proper and courteous woman, Gurd."</p>

<p>"Gurd," said Ben Herendeen, blunt and impatient as always,
"we're going to set some men on these hill trails at night. Just to
see who travels 'em after dark. Lige has agreed to take care of the
Antelope Plains. I'm posting one near the west base of the Moguls.
I want you to keep some men up there on the high trail to War Pass.
Be sure they don't talk and be sure they do this after dark."</p>

<p>"All right," said Gurd. "But you're fishin' with a pretty loose
net. What we need is a man to just ride around with his eyes and
ears open, without being suspected."</p>

<p>"Range detective," said Lige White.</p>

<p>Herendeen gave both of them a stolid look. "Already got that
man."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Grant.</p>

<p>Herendeen held his answer for a moment, as though he did not
quite want to reveal the name. Lige White understood this and spoke
with a show of resentment. "Who the hell is running this show, Ben?
We're all in it, or we ain't."</p>

<p>Herendeen bent forward and let the man's name drop softly into
the room. "Now," he added, "say nothing about it. Anybody knew it
was him, his life wouldn't be worth much." He put his hard stare on
Gurd Grant. "I don't want Morgan to know, either."</p>

<p>"Well now," answered Gurd Grant with slow discomfort, "I don't
know about that. He's in this too."</p>

<p>"Is he?" said Herendeen.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Grant.</p>

<p>"What was he playin' along with Ollie Jacks for? Anybody know
where he really stands? Anybody got a square answer out of him? No.
Until we do we'll keep this to ourselves." He had a way of dropping
his closed fist through the air to drive home his talk; he did it
now. Then he added, dryly, "It may be he's on the other side of the
fence."</p>

<p>"That's a damned fool thing to say," flared up Gurd Grant. "I
don't like it."</p>

<p>"He's protecting Hack Breathitt," pointed out Herendeen. "And
what's Hack? Figure it out."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Gurd Grant, "Hack's all right."</p>

<p>"He made camp with Pete Borders last night," said Herendeen.</p>

<p>Grant scowled. "Foolish thing to do," he admitted.</p>

<p>Herendeen rose. "You two fellows meet me at my place about six.
Maybe I can show you something. Maybe, before long, we'll smoke out
Morgan. Far as I'm concerned, it's fish or cut bait. We'll have
this country empty of people that don't belong in it by ninety
days." He slapped his hand sharply against his knee and rose,
leading the other two to the porch.</p>

<p>Catherine remained, by the steps. Herendeen paused and put his
round blue glance on her, cool and appraising; he betrayed himself
to her, in the way he used his eyes. He showed her what he was
thinking. "Friday night then, Catherine," he said and went to his
horse, riding out of the meadow with Lige White.</p>

<p>"Gurd," reflected Catherine, "be a little careful in what you
promise Ben."</p>

<p>Gurd said: "We've all got to stick together," and went back
through the house.</p>

<p>Catherine turned into the house, climbing the stairs to her own
room. She started to remove the riding habit but stopped and sat on
the edge of the bed, closely thinking. All the talk of the men had
come through the front room's open window to her&mdash;all of it,
excepting the name of Herendeen's informer. Herendeen had no idea
of including Morgan in his plans. He had, she realized clearly, a
hatred of Morgan that would stay with him as long as he lived and
he would try to put Morgan in a bad light&mdash;as he had even now
suggested to Gurd. She rose, still wearing the riding clothes, and
went down the stairs to inspect the kitchen.</p>

<p>Leaving Grant's ranch, Clay Morgan rode north through a gentle
up-and-down roll of hills carpeted with bunch grass and loosely
studded by twisted, ancient junipers and jack pine. Later in the
afternoon he passed the valley of Herendeen's ranch at some
distance and entered the footslopes of Mogul, through short ravines
shaded by box elder and alder and cottonwood. On this, the west
side of Mogul, the land rose step by step to the summit plateau,
and as the elevation carried him upward he had his bird's-eye view
of the meadows and cross-cut valleys and dusty trails and little
lakes and silver-streaked creeks below. In many ways it was an
empty land, the few clusters of ranch quarters separated by long
distances. Now and then he saw some solitary rider breaking dust on
the trails, small-shaped and accenting the surrounding loneliness.
This was late fall, with the yellow-blue haze of distant grass and
forest fires filtering into the sky; the smell of it was woody and
faintly acrid. Westward, beyond Herendeen's valley, the Cache
Mountains rose steep and high above the land.</p>

<p>This was his country. He loved it with a hidden intensity few
people realized. He was bound to it by the thousand ties of his
boyhood. Its spaciousness and its freedom, its smells and colors
had formed most of his thinking. In the middle of its burning-hot
days he rode with his eyes narrowed but observant to the tawny
creases of Mogul's ribs, to the metal flash of the stony soil, to
the quiver of heat waves; by night in the black, cool stillness he
listened to the far faint sounds of mystery. The land was, though
of this he was never conscious, like an organ whose notes, from the
faintest cricket murmur to the heavy roll of overhead thunder,
played on his feelings. He was governed by its moods as completely
as a man could be. Away from it, he was restless and incomplete; in
it a feeling of bone-deep comfort returned to him.</p>

<p>Thus he rode upward with the quartering trails of Mogul, toward
its plateau in the late afternoon hours. Cattle made scattered
bunches here and there; they rested by the willows growing around
the waterholes. He passed one meadow and another where the wild hay
had been cut and put up in high, square stacks. This had been a
good year, the hay running a ton and a half to the acre. Cowbirds
swirled before his horse in black, darting clouds and the smell of
the earth was a warm compound of dry-grass scent and the sharp
spicy odor of sage and the pungence of dust. The sun fell behind
the western mountains in a formless red eruption. In another half
hour twilight, cool and tremendously still, whirled about him.
Beyond eight o'clock he sighted the glint of light from his ranch
house, shining across the flats. Reaching home, he had supper and
sat on the porch. Muscular weariness loosened his long frame and
the ease of the darkening night got into him; fed and indolent, he
swayed the rocker across the loose porch boards and breathed the
fragrance of his cigar.</p>

<p>Neither Jump nor Vermilye had returned from roundup. The cook
stirred in the kitchen and old Mose was somewhere by the corrals,
self-wrapped in his customary gloom. Night blackened out the day
and crowded around Morgan until he was thoroughly alone. The
rustling song of the crickets swelled along the dark and a small
steady breeze, cool with coming winter, brushed him. There were two
great hours in life, the hour of first gray morning's light when
all things were fresh and sharp and keen, and this hour with its
softness and its mystery and its time for reflection. Northward in
the sky one great star burned its unwinking white- red light,
somehow reminding him of the constancy of all things, the
changelessness and the fidelity of the outer world. Man was the
only impermanent thing.</p>

<p>These were his thoughts. They were pathways, these thoughts, all
leading back to his early manhood and to Lila who had been his
wife. He remembered how clear and bright that time was how much fun
it had all been; and then the fun had gone, leaving him almost
beyond the power of laughter. The thing he kept remembering was her
eyes, black with anger and black with reproach, looking up to him
at the last, conveying the thought that their unhappiness had been
of his making. She had hated him at the end because of the girlhood
he had taken from her, she had hated him for a marriage she had so
soon found wrong. That was always the clearest thing&mdash;the
memory of her eyes. It had left him with one permanent, impossible
wish&mdash;that he might live over those days, to swing her heart
to him and bring back her first half-wild love of life. Not her
love of him, for that, they had soon known, never had existed. He
had, too, a gray unforgettable rage toward Ben Herendeen who had
made the change in her.</p>

<p>Quietly he smoked his cigar, reliving these old moments, and
heard the far rhythm of a horse coming out of the west, around the
foot of the Mogul Hills. He took the cigar from his mouth, cupping
its glowing tip in his palm, and sat quietly until the rider turned
in at the porch. Catherine Grant called quietly, "Clay," and got
down.</p>

<p>He rose as she stepped to the porch. He said, "A long ride for
you," and caught the fragrance of this girl's hair. It was a
familiar fragrance, it took him far back; it revived old things
better not revived. But she brought all this with her and stood now
before him with her sweetness and her strong spirit touching him,
lifting his impulses. The ride had deepened her breathing, it had
whipped up her gay, alive temper. She said, near to laughter:
"You're not pleased, Clay. I have broken into your sober
thoughts."</p>

<p>"How would you know?"</p>

<p>"I know. So well, so very well!" In a small, light and fugitive
murmur she added, "Too well."</p>

<p>He brought over another rocker. She sat beside him, lying back.
Her arm trailed over the rocker's arm, her face was a round
soft-shining blur in the dark. But he didn't need to see it; he
remembered how her lips would be long and gently pursed, how
half-grave and half-amused her eyes would be. She said in a more
serious voice: "Maybe I'm doing something you won't like. I'm
carrying tales. Ben and Lige White came over to see Gurd directly
after you left. Ben's going to have men out in the hills, looking
for rustlers. He's got somebody in the country pussyfooting for
him. I don't know who it is&mdash;but somebody we're all acquainted
with, I think. Gurd wanted to tell you all this. Ben said he didn't
trust you."</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Sounds natural."</p>

<p>She let the silence go along quite an interval. Her voice was
cool and near. "You hate him more than people realize, Clay. As he
hates you. Nothing ever would bring you together. Is that why you
took Ollie Jacks's part?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered.</p>

<p>She didn't press the point. This was the way they had always
been, close and tolerant, sometimes angered and frank but never
demanding. She had a silent streak of her own, a depth she never
let others see; and she gave him the same respect. She said now:
"Do you know why I came?"</p>

<p>He said cheerfully: "To sit on my porch again."</p>

<p>"Clay," she said, almost as a warning, "let's keep away from
that."</p>

<p>"Why did you come?" he said obediently.</p>

<p>"To tell you I think Ben would do anything to lay a trap for
you. Remember that&mdash;always remember that."</p>

<p>He said, "I'll tell you this," and turned slowly in the rocker,
hearing other horses sweep around the base of the Mogul Hills.
Catherine came to her feet. She murmured: "I don't want to be seen
here," and stepped inside the house.</p>

<p>Morgan went to her horse and led it around to the dark side of
the house. A single rider rushed at the porch, with other riders
pounding more distantly behind him. Clay returned to the porch,
watching the first rider's shape break the blackness and circle
into the yard. His horse was hard-breathing, pushed by a long run;
he said, as he stepped to the ground, "Me, Clay.
Me&mdash;Hack."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt stepped to the porch. He said: "I guess I need a
little help on this." He was a thin, agitated shape in the shadows;
he was swearing softly to himself, full of anger. He listened to
the strengthening rush of the yonder horses. "That will be
Herendeen and Lige White and Gurd Grant. It has come to a hell of a
pass when a man can't ride these hills as he pleases."</p>

<p>Clay Morgan said, rough and sudden: "If they're stepping on your
feet, take a shot at them."</p>

<p>Hack let out a heavy, irritated sigh. "Not yet, Clay. I'm tryin'
to be peaceable. Whut should I kill a man for?"</p>

<p>They said no more, for the three ranchers had reached the yard.
They were stopped, they were keeping to their saddles, and letting
the silence run; they could see Hack and Morgan on the porch,
touched by the outshining lamp light from the living room of the
house. These two were side by side on the porch, the thin and
restless Hack touching elbows with the long-bodied Morgan. Morgan's
shoulders had a high squareness. Every muscle showed the
displeasure he felt. It was in the way he stood and waited. He
said: "Get down and do your talking."</p>

<p>The three left their saddles, slowly coming into the light.
Morgan had his quick sight of their faces, of Gurd's worried
expression and of Lige White's embarrassed dislike at what he was
now doing, and of Ben Herendeen's bony, flat triumph. "It's what I
expected," Herendeen said.</p>

<p>"You're lucky I didn't knock you out of that saddle," grumbled
Hack Breathitt.</p>

<p>"If you had nothin' to worry about, why run?" asked
Herendeen.</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt was a shrewd man and he had no trust of Ben
Herendeen. He said, halfway between outrage and amusement: "Wasn't
runnin', Ben. I was just bein' careful. I just kept rememberin'
Ollie Jacks."</p>

<p>Herendeen, so huge and so willful, stared at Breathitt with an
angered flush of his massive face. Light glinted against his pale
eyes. He could have broken Hack Breathitt's back with his two arms,
as all of them knew; the desire to do it was ground into the
expression around his lips. This was his way&mdash;to hate anything
in front of him.</p>

<p>Gurd Grant said: "We were coming along the trail down by Dell
Lake and saw you and Pete Borders riding together. Pete hit off one
way and you went another. All we wanted to know was why you camped
with him last night. But you made a run of it."</p>

<p>Breathitt murmured: "Seems like you boys are mighty interested
to follow me eight miles on the dead gallop."</p>

<p>Gurd showed some embarrassment. Lige White never said a word.
Morgan tried a fresh match on his cigar. That flare brightened
everything on the porch momentarily; Herendeen's glance came around
to Morgan and then, after the match died, these two were staring at
each other, Morgan so dark and cool and Herendeen with all his
intolerance in his eyes. It was a feeling on the porch. It put
something into the night and turned the rest of them still.</p>

<p>"Clay," said Herendeen, "you propose to shelter every brush-
jumper that comes along?"</p>

<p>"Hack's a friend of mine," stated Morgan, "and he's on my land.
I'll stand behind him."</p>

<p>"Maybe then we'd better wait till he gets off your land."</p>

<p>"No," answered Morgan, as insolently calm as Herendeen had been,
"it makes no difference where he is. I'll still back him up.
Anytime, any place."</p>

<p>Gurd Grant spoke quickly, to avoid a break. "We've got no
quarrel with Hack, Clay. Not if his campin' with Borders was just
accidental."</p>

<p>Clay Morgan still watched Herendeen as he answered Gurd. "Since
when has a man got to explain himself to a self- constituted
committee?"</p>

<p>Lige White put in his soothing remark. "That's not quite right,
Clay. You're puttin' it wrong. You know why we're doing this. It is
for your interest, too. For anybody's interest that owns
cattle."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of my own interests, without help," said
Morgan.</p>

<p>"Don't get your neck bowed like that," complained Gurd, "We all
got to stick together."</p>

<p>Morgan threw his cigar far into the yard. He studied the three
men before him carefully, and went on talking.</p>

<p>"I guess I better explain. I'll never lift a hand to run anybody
out of this country unless I see that fellow stooping over one of
my cows. I don't believe in vigilance committees and I don't
believe in scaring hell out of some poor two-bit homesteader. This
country's big enough for everybody." He turned his attention
directly to Herendeen. He was as tall as Herendeen, but slimmer and
without the massive bony structure, without the heavy roundness of
leg and arm. "And it is too damned small for one man to set himself
up as God in tin pants."</p>

<p>Gurd Grant said with a suppressed impatience, "You're wrong,
Clay, you're wrong." He turned, walking over the porch, his boots
hollowly striking the boards. Morgan heard him stop at the far end.
Lige White shook his head, not speaking. But Ben Herendeen's ruddy
face was unbreakably tight. "Clay," he said, quieter than he had
ever been, "I've taken a couple of remarks from you. I take no
more."</p>

<p>"When you leave my land," said Morgan, soft as the wind, "don't
come back."</p>

<p>Herendeen said, to Breathitt, "If I ever see you around my
country, Hack, I'll open up on you." He swung on his heels and left
the porch.</p>

<p>From his place by the doorway, Morgan noticed Gurd Grant swing
from the porch end with a strange jerk of his shoulders and cross
at once to his horse. He mounted quickly, waiting for Lige White
and Herendeen. Darkness covered this yard but Morgan saw Gurd's
white and vague and staring face in the heavy shadows. A moment
later all three of them trotted from the yard.</p>

<p>As they left, Lige White said something to Grant. Gurd Grant
never heard it. In stepping to the end of the porch he had noticed
his sister's horse in the farther darkness and at that moment all
his long wonder at her relations with Morgan froze into solid
certainty&mdash;and left him, in that one passing interval, no
longer Morgan's friend. For a little while he had the impulse to
rush back and face it out with Clay but soon realized he could not
betray his sister to these other men. So he rode on, suddenly and
violently Clay Morgan's enemy. The change in him was that
sudden.</p>

<p>Hack said: "Well, I'll drift along."</p>

<p>"Put up for the night, Hack."</p>

<p>"No," said Hack. "But I'm obliged for the help." He looked down
at the floor, involved in his own uncertain thoughts. "It is the
last time I'll run from those fellows, Clay. I wanted no shootin'.
Now, I don't give a damn."</p>

<p>"Watch it. Don't let Ben push you into the wrong stall."</p>

<p>Hack drew a long breath. "So far," he said, "I ain't done a
thing to be ashamed of, Clay. I want you to know that. Well, so-
long."</p>

<p>He was soon gone, galloping southward down the narrow valley.
Morgan waited until the sound of all these travelers faded into the
night before going to the living room. Catherine came from the
hallway toward him.</p>

<p>"Clay&mdash;did he see my horse?"</p>

<p>"I took it back of the house."</p>

<p>Relief came to her, though there was a shading of worry that
wouldn't leave. "Gurd's a little touchy about me, I wouldn't
want..." She didn't finish that sentence. She showed him a stronger
coloring, and covered it up with a quick question. "I heard all the
talk. Are you sure you're right, Clay?"</p>

<p>He said: "You think I ought to do it differently?"</p>

<p>"Not if you think you're right." She was a calm, quiet girl.
Light set up its rich shining in her copper hair. Her eyes held him
and her lips were long and pleasantly firm. She had an effect on
him. She colored the room, she put something into it, something
like a faint charge of electricity.</p>

<p>He said: "Do what you can to keep Gurd out of it. Ben's going to
play hell with a lot of people. If it comes to a showdown I'll have
to go against him."</p>

<p>She murmured, "I know," and the color of her eyes turned darker,
turned softer. She put her arms across her breasts, holding them
together. They were round and firm; her fingers were faintly tanned
by all her riding, and long and strong. He had no way of knowing
what she thought at this moment&mdash;this vigorous and gay and
sweet girl; she always had a reserve that held him away. The
silence ran on, with its effect piling up. She saw the length of
his jaw and the tension around his lips and the smoky excitement
rising in his eyes. She said in a small, hurried voice, "Good
night, Clay," and went by him. He walked to the porch and waited
until she rode around the house. She paused a moment and held out
her hand. The pressure of it was strong; and the shock was there
again for him. She said, at once cool and near laughter: "Will I
see you in town, Clay? There's a dance Friday. I think Ben will be
taking me."</p>

<p>"I'll be there," he said.</p>

<p>She went out of the yard in a whirling run. He stood and
listened until there was no sound left in the dark night.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. SURPRISE</h2>

<p class="first">ON Thursday evening just beyond sunset, Ben
Herendeen reached the ridge behind the Gale homestead and came over
it so suddenly that he caught the Gale family eating supper under a
lone juniper tree in the yard. He might have taken the route
straight across Fanolango Desert, but this would have given Gale
notice from afar. Liard Connor and Bones McGeen, both being men who
liked this kind of business, were with him.</p>

<p>It amused Herendeen to see the complete shock his arrival
produced. Gale rose, gaunt and gray-headed and old-faced in the
twilight. Mrs. Gale suddenly reached for the smallest child,
wrapping her apron around him. There were three other children in
the family, a girl near twenty and two younger boys. All of them
remained still and for a moment he could see something pretty close
to terror in the eyes of Gale's wife. In a way it pleased him to
find them still on the ranch. He proposed to make an example of the
family and this made it easy. A nester was a nester, deserving
nothing.</p>

<p>He said: "You had my warning, Gale."</p>

<p>Gale knew he couldn't fight back; he knew he couldn't argue. He
stood with his shoulder-points round and dropped, his arms hanging
useless. There was an expression in his eyes at the moment pretty
hard to read, black and dismal. He shook his head. "You're a hard
man, Mr. Herendeen."</p>

<p>"I gave you time," pointed out Herendeen.</p>

<p>"Time for what?" asked Gale. "To kick a man around like a dog? I
ain't hurting you. This ain't near your range. It should be Mr.
White's say&mdash;and he ain't complained." He didn't speak of his
legal right to be here on free Government land, for he knew how
hopeless it was in front of a cattleman in cattle country.</p>

<p>"That's enough," said Herendeen. "All you nesters are alike. I
give you twenty minutes to clear your junk out of the shack."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gale at once turned and ran for the house, calling over her
shoulder, "Gale, help me. Daisy&mdash;come help me."</p>

<p>Gale didn't move. He had his head down and he stared at the
ground, hard-caught by indecision and futility. The girl, Herendeen
observed, was pretty. He stared at her out of interested eyes and
was irritated by the judgment he discovered on her face. Suddenly
she turned to the shanty. The two young boys seemed rooted in the
dust, silent and soft breathing. The other child, hardly able to
walk, moved toward Herendeen's horse; whereupon one of the older
boys reached out and caught him.</p>

<p>The women were carrying their possessions out of the
house&mdash;their kitchen implements, their clothes, their few
sticks of furniture. Herendeen said, almost laughing, "Old man, if
you expect to save your wagon you better get it out of the
shed."</p>

<p>Gale stirred himself. He walked across the yard with his knees
never quite straightening. He called to the oldest boy, "Give me a
hand, sonny," and both of them seized the tongue of the wagon and
backed it from the shed. Afterwards Gale went into the corral for
his horses. Herendeen watched the family move around the yard. He
looked at his watch, and was a little disappointed that it was so
easy. He said: "That's twenty minutes. Set 'em afire."</p>

<p>Bones McGeen rode to the shed. Liard Connor got down and went
into the house. Herendeen heard him tramping around the place; the
stove crashed down and in a little while smoke began to puff
through the door. Connor came back. McGeen had piled some sage wood
against the corner of the shed, and now this fire began to burn.
Gale stopped harnessing the horses. He put his back against the
wagon, watching the fire catch hold. The women came out of the
house, but Mrs. Gale moaned something to herself and ran into it
again, reappearing with a baby's rocker-bed made of packing boxes.
One of its legs got caught in the door and her face was white and
cramped and intense as she struggled to clear it.</p>

<p>This shanty was bone-dry. The fire, reaching the walls, began to
crack like dynamite caps; the windows were red-shining and the
hollow sound of inrushing air grew stronger. Gale turned from the
wagon to resume harnessing the horses; he put his back to the
burning shanty, stolidly ignoring it, but the rest of the family
crept to the juniper tree, watching in morbid silence. Mrs. Gale
reached down and caught the youngest child in her arms; the girl
put an arm on her mother's shoulder.</p>

<p>One side of the shed turned into a yellow sheet of flame; the
doorway of the shanty showed a solid roll of smoke and fire
inside&mdash;and there was no way now for the Gales to save
anything. Herendeen said to his men: "I guess that's all." But he
looked at the girl, speculating on her. He said: "I'm not as bad as
you'd figure. You want a job? It's one way of keeping your family
alive, anyhow."</p>

<p>Gale left the horses and walked to Herendeen. He said: "Mr.
Herendeen, my daughter would drop dead before she took anything
from you. And if she did take anything I'd kill her. I guess you've
done us all the hurt you can. Go on and leave us alone. Someday,
maybe I can pay you back."</p>

<p>"Hold on there," said Herendeen. He got off his horse and walked
up to Gale, catching the front of Gale's shirt in his fingers. He
shook Gale a little but there wasn't any resistance in the older
man at all; his body swayed to the pressure of Herendeen's arm.
Mrs. Gale's eyes showed a sudden terror. One of the boys reached
down to seize a rock; he would have thrown it at Herendeen if the
girl hadn't caught his arm.</p>

<p>Herendeen said: "You had better keep your damned mouth shut.
Hitch up that team and get out of the country. I don't want to see
you on this range again."</p>

<p>He released Gale and returned to his horse. Connor and McGeen
joined him, the three of them circling the snapping, twisted rush
of fire; flames broke through the shanty's roof and the sky above
this area began to glow. Looking back as a matter of caution,
Herendeen saw the family still standing by the juniper tree. The
girl had taken the youngest child in her arms. Gale had moved over
to his wife. His arm was around her; she had thrown her apron
across her face and was crying. Herendeen hit his horse with his
spurs and settled into a long run across Fanolango Desert. Behind
him was the cherry-red glare of burning buildings.</p>

<p>Late Friday afternoon, just as Clay Morgan was ready to leave
the ranch for War Pass, Vance Ketchell came into the Long Seven
yard and dropped off a tired horse. Vance was a steady-going young
man who once had been a puncher for Herendeen's Three Pines and now
owned a few cows of his own up on the slope of the Cache Mountains.
He didn't say anything for a moment but Morgan saw that he was
under considerable strain&mdash;and waited for Vance to make his
talk. Vance fashioned a cigarette, lighted it and stood with his
feet apart, staring across the narrow valley flats. He said,
"Pretty country," but really didn't see it. When he pushed his hat
back a mop of hair, black as crow, dropped down on his forehead. He
had a blocky, pleasant face at present shadowed by worry.</p>

<p>"Clay," he said at last, "you hear about the Gales?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I saw them over in Freeport yesterday. Pretty
tough&mdash;pretty tough." He smoked on and Morgan knew he had not
yet come to his point. Something on the summit of the Mogul Hills
seemed to interest Vance Ketchell as he added casually: "I like the
family&mdash;I like the girl."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Morgan, and understood part of Vance's trouble
then. Vance drew a long breath on the cigarette. "It does make me
squirm to think of the way Herendeen handled those folks. Whut
affair of Herendeen's was it anyhow? If anybody was bein' hurt it
was Lige White. Whut I want to know is just how far Herendeen
figures to cast his shadow."</p>

<p>"Far as he can," said Morgan.</p>

<p>"Clay, if that can happen to a nester, it can happen to me. I'm
pretty small potatoes and it looks like something's afoot to push
us out." He stared at Morgan, then said in an idle voice, "I heard
the big outfits held a meetin' the other day."</p>

<p>"Wasn't present," said Clay.</p>

<p>He knew what lay in Ketchell's mind. Ketchell was a cow hand at
heart but he had his own interests to worry about now, and the
affair at the Gale homestead hit pretty close. Ketchell was
figuring out the politics of the country, wondering where his,
Morgan's, weight would be. Ketchell was too old a hand to ask the
direct question, but nevertheless he kept circling around, hunting
an answer.</p>

<p>Ketchell said: "I don't think it was right of Herendeen. Can't
blame a big outfit for watchin' its own fences, but I ain't so
ignorant as I used to be. Small folks have got rights, Clay.
There's a lot of them in this world and they got rights!"</p>

<p>"If I were Gale," said Morgan, "I'd cut the price of that
homestead out of Herendeen's hide."</p>

<p>He saw relief change Ketchell's face completely. Vance tossed
away the cigarette; he was grinning beneath the shadow of his hat
brim. "Yeah," he said. "Well, see you in church." He was on the
horse and soon away and somewhere in his mind was a decision formed
in that little space of time.</p>

<p>Turned townward in the last flare of sunlight, Clay Morgan
remembered the worry and the anger in Vance Ketchell's talk. There
was a slow change taking place in Vance's head; the same change was
going on in Hack Breathitt. It was a symbol of a general discontent
spreading through the country. Ketchell and Breathitt were typical
riders, born in the saddle and trained to cattle, and loyal to the
idea of free range and big outfits. Yet they were men full of rough
justice and strong individualism, believing in the policy of Live
and Let Live. This was what Herendeen bumped into with his Rule or
Ruin ideas and this was what would bring on a war.</p>

<p>Coming down the long grade into the sudden sunless clarity of
first evening, he got to thinking of Ketchell's indirect question,
and realized he had given a pretty slim answer. The trouble was
that he too had been born to the saddle, to cattle and the open
range. But if this were so, it was likewise true that he hated
pressure from any source, he despised intolerance, he disliked the
beating down of little men who had their own rights to the sun.
This was why his answer to Ketchell, and to Hack, had been so
noncommittal. He had made his little show against Herendeen's
force. When it came to the inevitable break where would he stand?
He wasn't certain.</p>

<p>He entered War Pass in first darkness, putting up at Gentry's.
There would be supper for him at Ann McGarrah's but for some reason
that wasn't very clear to him, he went to the Long Grade saloon,
found Hack Breathitt, and took him to the hotel for a meal. The
town was filling with people from the roundabout hills and from the
long deep wastes of the sage desert; wagons and buggies came out of
the night and horsemen trotted through town, churning up the
silver-yellow dust. Lige White and Mrs. White came into the hotel's
hall. Mrs. White turned toward her husband and Clay Morgan saw the
momentary girlish lightness of her face when she spoke to Lige.
Lige, always a man of courtesy, removed his hat before her and said
something and left the hotel. Mrs. White stood quite still,
watching him go; later when she entered the dining room Clay Morgan
noticed the old, expressionless calm on her cheeks again.</p>

<p>They had finished eating, but Hack Breathitt remained at the
table a little longer, his quick eyes following the waitress around
the room. She saw his glance and came over, this Helen Lavalle; but
Hack, suddenly embarrassed, murmured, "I guess we didn't want
anything else," and left the table.</p>

<p>Morgan missed none of this. When they had reached the hallway,
Breathitt looked back at the girl, showing excitement in his eyes.
He followed Clay to the porch, into the bland sweet- smelling
night; and was chuckling to himself.</p>

<p>"See you later, Clay."</p>

<p>"Janet's got a piece to speak, at the school."</p>

<p>"I ain't forgot. I'll be there." He sauntered down the street
with his hat shoved back and his boot heels dragging the boardwalk.
He was whistling "Zebra Dun."</p>

<p>Clay Morgan remained on the hotel porch, watching this street
fill, identifying the horses at the racks. Jesse Rusey cruised by
and drawled, "Good evening, Clay," in his even, adamant voice and
passed on to the shadows. Gurd Grant entered town with the Crowfoot
outfit. Behind them followed Herendeen and Catherine Grant in a
rig. Herendeen drove the rig to the hotel porch, handing out
Catherine there. He said, "I will see you in half an hour," threw
his cool glance at Morgan, and drove away. Catherine came up the
steps, laughing at Morgan&mdash;and taking the little ruffle of
antagonism out of Morgan with that laughter. She wore a long maroon
gown whose material rustled as she walked. A lace shawl hid the
corners of her bare shoulders and the light of the hotel began to
burn against her hair. The dress made her tall, it quickened this
girl's deep self-willed beauty. She said: "Will you be there,
Clay?" and went into the hotel without waiting for his answer.</p>

<p>He remembered he had not seen Charley Hillhouse as he crossed to
McGarrah's store and passed through to the rear living quarters.
Ann McGarrah knelt before Janet, adjusting the pleats of Janet's
dress. Janet's glance came across Ann McGarrah's head full of
relief. "I wondered if you'd be late, Daddy."</p>

<p>Ann McGarrah said: "I'll get you a meal, Clay."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I didn't want to bother. I ate at the
hotel,"</p>

<p>She showed him a quick, faintly hurt surprise, but covered it up
at once. "We should be starting for the school in a little
while."</p>

<p>"Am I taking you to the dance?"</p>

<p>She said: "You hadn't asked."</p>

<p>"So now I'll ask."</p>

<p>She was a small, silent and intense girl who held her feelings
away from him. Her eyes remained on him, black and obscure. Then
she murmured: "I'll dress," and left the kitchen.</p>

<p>Morgan and Janet passed through the store and sat on the porch
steps, watching the crowd roll along the street. Jesse Rusey stood
in the shadows near the Mountain House, watching a cluster of
punchers near the Long Grade. Gurd Grant appeared at the corner of
the courthouse and crossed to the Long Grade. Herendeen came from
the adjoining saddleshop and stopped Gurd; then these two talked a
moment and recrossed the street, meeting Sheriff Nickum. There was
an extended discussion, the sheriff slowly nodding his head, as
though he agreed without enthusiasm. Looking back to Rusey, Morgan
saw how carefully the marshal observed that scene.</p>

<p>Janet was murmuring to herself, her small red lips moving over
the lines of her poem. "Little dancing white-fire creature, light
me with your candle." She sighed and cupped her chin between her
two hands. Morgan said quietly, "Never be afraid of anything you
can't see, Janet."</p>

<p>Ann McGarrah presently came out, dressed in a pearl-white gown;
it made her eyes darker, it made her black hair shine by contrast.
Standing before her, marveling at the change, he reflected that she
was different from the women of this town, different in the way she
held herself and in the way she looked out upon the world and
pushed it from her. She was always neat and self-sufficient; she
had a quietness that sometimes seemed brusque. But she was smiling
now at him, pleased by the effect she had created. She saw the
reflection of his thoughts on his face and at once the smile died
and she looked down and drew back into herself again, because of
shyness or embarrassment at the change she had wrought in him.</p>

<p>The gentle flow of the crowd carried them up the hill to the
school. At the door Janet left them. Morgan round two seats near
the front of a newly made platform.</p>

<p>Breathitt stood in the rear of the room, crowded between other
townsmen. He caught Breathitt's eye but Hack only shook his head,
unsmiling and clearly ruffled by something. Solid and still on the
hard bench, Morgan had his look at the families around
him&mdash;the awkward and gentle resignation of the women from the
outlying country, the leathered cheeks of the men and the blackness
of their hands. This was what sun and rain and work and worry did.
Mostly they were people who had few possessions; mostly they
struggled to keep the roof dry and the stove warm. They were slow
to speak, humble in their beliefs and a thousand miles away from
the things Ben Herendeen stood for. He thought about this with a
deeper and deeper attention, for the moment forgetting that Ann
McGarrah was beside him. She whispered: "It's starting," and he
listened to the school's principal make a brief speech of
welcome.</p>

<p>Somebody played the piano and a group of first-graders made a
ring on the stage, singing as they turned a circle; it wasn't the
first-graders Morgan noticed then but a ranch woman across the
aisle, mother of one of those children; she bent forward and her
hands were tight on her lap and her lips moved, and every thought
and every feeling flowed on her face, softening and making it
wistfully pretty. There was applause afterwards but this woman sat
back on the bench closing her eyes; he had never seen that look on
a woman's face before.</p>

<p>It went by grades, some singing, some dancing, some reciting. He
was nervous, not realizing it. When Janet came forward to the edge
of the stage a fine sweat broke across his forehead and he pushed
his legs against the floor, trying to remember what the first line
of her poem was. Afterwards she made a quick curtsy and her voice
came over the room, precise as it always was, and quite sure. When,
she was through he sat still, not looking around at the other
people. Ann, turning to him, said something. She was smiling with
that brightness which comes so close to tears. He murmured "Yes,"
and was thinking of Lila who would have been happy to have seen
this. This was about all he heard of the program, for it was soon
over.</p>

<p>Coming up the aisle, jammed together with the other people,
hearing women compliment other women on their children, hearing the
released and shrill talk of the youngsters, he felt suddenly old
and weary, as though he had gone through a fight. He knew the
feeling and was a little depressed by it. Ann held his arm. Near
the door he saw Catherine Grant. She had been in a corner of the
room, standing by Hack Breathitt. She smiled at him and he had the
feeling that she read him pretty thoroughly at the moment. The
pressure of Ann's hand tightened on his arm. He noticed that she
gave Catherine Grant one quick, smileless look; nothing more. A
little later they found Janet waiting outside the school. Hack
Breathitt came up, grinning from ear to ear. He said, as though he
wanted to make an argument out of it, "None of them did as good as
you, Janey."</p>

<p>They drifted down the hill, to the corner of the courthouse.
Janet went on toward the store, walking with the quick light step
characteristic of her. Breathitt had quit smiling and now he
watched the street in a way that meant trouble. Morgan said:
"What's up, Hack?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," said Breathitt. "Nothin' at all," and crossed to the
Long Grade.</p>

<p>They had already started to dance at the Odd Fellows' Hall.
Going toward it, Morgan heard Parr Gentry's voice call the turns
above the fiddles and guitars. "Grab your partners, don't be
late&mdash;swing 'em wide on the big front gate!" They climbed the
stairs, coming into the heat and the yellow flare of the hall. The
music had stopped but by the time Ann put away her shawl it had
started again. They swung away to a waltz tune. She was small and
light in his arms, she had no weight. Her hair made a soft dark
line at the edge of her temples; a thin-sharp scent of perfume came
to him, heightening his awareness of her.</p>

<p>She said, not looking up: "Are you proud of her, Clay?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>She said: "I watched you, and saw you tighten up. Just the same
way you tighten up in front of Ben Herendeen. What were you
thinking about, Clay?"</p>

<p>"It would have been something swell for Lila to have seen."</p>

<p>She raised her head then. Her lips were almost severe while she
watched him; there wasn't any light in her eyes. She murmured: "You
never forget, do you?"</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt went directly into the Long Grade and saw a solid
line at the bar. Nearest him were a group of Grant's Crowfoot
riders, all of them his friends. Billy McQuire said, "Step in here,
Hack," but Breathitt shook his head and balanced on his heels, his
face cool and smooth and tough. Herendeen's men had gathered at the
far end of the bar, and these he watched solemnly. Liard Connor and
Bones McGeen were side-by-side at the bar, turned from him, but he
knew they had spotted him in the back bar mirror. He pushed up his
hat and walked on, making a turn behind these two. There wasn't any
space between them, but he came against them and shoved them aside
with his shoulders.</p>

<p>He stared straight ahead, into the mirror. Their faces came
around to him, with the reserve he had seen many times before in
moments of trouble. He knew what the expression meant. The barkeep
came down his way, waiting for his choice; Breathitt said gently:
"Not now, Sam. When I drink, it'll be in better company."</p>

<p>It was a sound that traveled around him. The talk in the saloon
faded a little and he saw, still watching the mirror, men's hats
and heads swing. Liard Connor pulled his arm aside. Bones McGeen
suddenly grinned over his whisky glass. He spoke to nobody in
particular. "Hair in his ears and smoke in his nose. Feelin' the
beef in his belly. Whose beef? Now I wonder."</p>

<p>In Hack's voice was the flat melody of a man on edge. "Maybe it
was just an accident when you boys bumped into me down by the
hotel. Maybe. If there's something in your craw, you don't have to
go to that trouble. I can hear English, if you bullheads can talk
it. I don't like my feet stepped on. I'll be out on that street all
evenin'. Try it again. One at a time, or both together. Or bring
along the whole damned bunch, like you did with Ollie Jacks."</p>

<p>He withdrew from the bar and stepped to the door with the solid
silence of the crowd following him. He batted the doors aside with
his shoulders. On the walk, he turned quickly toward his horse,
which was near Gentry's. He seized his gunbelt from the saddle horn
and buckled it around him and pulled the bottom of his coat over
it. One hand resting on the horse, he watched the street, knowing
that the town was no longer safe for him. None of the Herendeen
bunch showed up at the Long Grade door, though he realized they
would be moving his way soon enough. Sheriff Nickum came into the
light of the hotel. People kept crossing to the Odd Fellows' Hall
and the music and the scrape of feet made quite a racket, and
suddenly Jesse Rusey slid from the shadows and was before him. He
had the soft-footedness of a cat, this marshal, and eyes that could
burn through a brick wall. It gave Hack Breathitt a moment's
self-affront to think Rusey had come on him thus unawares, but he
stood fast, not saying anything. The marshal's hand reached out and
hit Hack Breathitt's flank, where the gun was. Afterwards Rusey, no
man to ask questions, made a turning circle on his heels, looking
the whole street through. He said then, "Be careful, Hack," and
stepped back into the shadows. When Hack looked around he saw
nothing of the marshal.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. LONG RIDE</h2>

<p class="first">PARR GENTRY called for a schottische. Lige White
came over to claim Ann McGarrah, leaving his wife with Clay. They
went wheeling and dipping around the floor. Mrs. White very
graceful in his arms, and very pretty; but her glance kept
following her husband with that calm indrawn attention Morgan had
noticed so often. It was as though she did not fully understand
Lige, as though she tried to see him off-guard and catch something
on his face that he never showed her. Once, when she missed a step
she looked up to Clay and smiled, and then she was younger than
before, and no longer reserved. She had the bluest eyes of any
woman in his memory, so blue that the color startled him.</p>

<p>Herendeen had kept Catherine Grant to himself. After the
schottische Morgan returned Mrs. White to Lige and stood awhile,
idly talking. The stag line thickened. Gurd Grant was over there
and Gurd's glance was directly on him, and stayed on him without
recognition. It, was pretty clear; Gurd had cut him cold.</p>

<p>Parr Gentry said, "Pick your partners for a waltz," and the
fiddles began tuning up again. Clay remained in his tracks, head
down, puzzled by Gurd Grant's cut. Something was in the wind. He
could catch it with his mind, but he knew Herendeen had somehow,
gotten at Gurd. He debated it coolly, trying to make up his mind,
until he heard Ann say, "What is it, Clay?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said. "Nothing at all." Herendeen and Catherine
were only a few feet away. Catherine's glance touched him, brief
and interested, and then he forgot Gurd and put his hand to Ann
McGarrah's elbow and moved her toward Herendeen. It amused him to
see Herendeen's ruddy face show instant intolerance. He said to
Catherine, "Should be ours, I think," and moved away with her as
the waltz began.</p>

<p>Catherine said: "I wondered if you would."</p>

<p>"One more week&mdash;one more dance. War Pass, the Burnt Ranch
school, the old hall at Chickman Creek. This goes back a long
way."</p>

<p>"Do you remember so many of those dances, Clay?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I guess I do when I'm dancing with you."</p>

<p>These dance nights were like markers leading into the back
years. He could visualize most of them; he could remember the fun
of most of them. "It is an odd thing," he said, and was puzzled by
his own sentiment in the matter, "but it seems to be a habit I'm
afraid to stop. Like a man that has done one thing so long he can't
quit without breaking something that holds him together."</p>

<p>She murmured: "This dance, Clay&mdash;with me?"</p>

<p>"Ten years of it," he said. "We were pretty young and all of our
friends were young, and we had a fine time. As long as we keep on
we've still got something left of those times. Of everything that
used to be. It is a way of keeping yesterday alive, I guess. When
we stop, yesterday's dead."</p>

<p>"It will die sometime, Clay."</p>

<p>"I hate to think of it."</p>

<p>They were all around the hall before she spoke. "It isn't the
good times you want to remember, Clay. It is one person you never
want to forget. I know. I watched you tonight when Janet spoke. I
knew what you were thinking. Not of Janet, not of anything or
anybody in the hall. It was Lila, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he said, in some surprise. "How would you know
that?" Slowly turning with the swing of the waltz, he saw Harry
Jump come up the stairs and move through the loitering stags at the
edge of the floor. Harry Jump was here when he should have been
forty miles out in the Moguls. Morgan wheeled Catherine around,
losing Harry Jump, and catching him again. Jump saw him and showed
no expression of any kind. It was a signal.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Maybe you'd like a drink of water."</p>

<p>She had been too long in the country not to know. She slipped
her arm through his elbow and they left the floor, passing Harry
Jump without giving him notice. They went down the stairs into the
soft dark shadows. Harry Jump's boots scuffed the stairs,
following. He passed them, saying from the side of his mouth, "Not
here, Clay." They followed him as far as Gentry's and stopped
before him.</p>

<p>"All right," said Morgan.</p>

<p>"You sure?" said Harry Jump, staring at Catherine.</p>

<p>"I'll go," she said.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Morgan. "You know better, Harry."</p>

<p>"Well, then. I rode through Government Valley before dark
tonight. There's a notice posted on the building. The land office
is selling the valley at auction tomorrow afternoon at four
o'clock, in Sage City."</p>

<p>He waited for Morgan to speak and when Morgan kept silent, he
added: "That notice should have been posted a month before the
sale. Somebody's got at somebody to hold off until it was too late
for you. It's nine o'clock now. Eighteen hours until four tomorrow.
Hundred and ninety miles to go."</p>

<p>Morgan said: "I talked to Fred Rich at the post office a few
days ago, and he knew nothing." He drove his hands in his pockets;
he had his head up, he was watching the mouth of the Odd Fellows'
doorway. But he wasn't seeing it, Catherine realized. He was a
long, still shape in the shadows, quietly considering this little
treachery. He had a way of absorbing trouble and punishment without
showing emotion; he had a way of storing these things in his mind.
He said: "All right, Harry."</p>

<p>He turned back with Catherine. She said: "Speculators, Clay. Or
Ben." She knew how he felt about Government Valley.</p>

<p>The music had stopped. Coming up the stairs they saw Herendeen
and Ann standing at the edge of the hall, neither one liking the
other enough to keep up conversation. Herendeen never bothered to
conceal his feelings. He displayed resentment now as they came
forward. He ducked his head at Catherine. "My dance," he said, and
led her away. Out on the floor he looked thoughtfully toward
Morgan.</p>

<p>Ann said: "Don't make me dance with him again."</p>

<p>He said: "I guess I've got to take you home. I'll have to
ride."</p>

<p>She got her wrap at once and they went down the stairs.</p>

<p>The sense of wasting time pushed Morgan along, making Ann
McGarrah walk quite fast. On the store porch he thought to lift his
hat. "Tell Janet I'll be back to take her home on Wednesday," he
said, and swung away.</p>

<p>For Ann McGarrah the evening went flat as she watched him go; he
had not thanked her, he had not even thought of her these last
moments, he had not taken her into his confidence and mentioned the
trouble that now made him disappear at the head of the street.
Still and dark and hurt, she looked down at the smooth front of her
dress, knowing that she was pretty and knowing she had, for a
moment, warmed his heart. And then this had gone. She thought of
Catherine, coolly and critically, and turned into the store. Janet
was asleep. Standing over the bed in the dark room, Ann McGarrah
watched Janet's small sweetly mature face, seeing there so much of
her mother. This was the secure grip Lila held on Clay
Morgan&mdash;this was Lila's power, this was her way of forever
reminding Clay of the past, and this was her way of holding him to
an unreal, unjust obligation. Thinking of all this, Ann McGarrah
hated Lila with a secret, passionate fullness. She turned back the
extra covers from the child and left the room.</p>

<p>Going up Stage Street, Clay Morgan reached Harley Stewart's
house at the top of the hill. When Stewart came to the door, Morgan
said: "Come down to the bank, Harley. I've got to have money inside
of fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt held himself in the thick shadows by the
courthouse corner and saw McGeen and Liard Connor leave the Long
Grade saloon. The two of them immediately separated, McGeen turning
toward Old Town while Connor traveled to Gentry's stable. More
Three Pines riders drifted from the saloon, moving toward the dance
hall. Instead of going up the stairs they turned down the black
alley between the Odd Fellows' Hall and the adjoining saddle shop.
Meanwhile Clay Morgan walked down Stage Street with Harley Stewart,
these two going into the bank. A light flashed on. Jesse Rusey
appeared from the darkness, at once crossing to the bank and
looking through the window. Lige and Mrs. White left the dance hall
and passed Hack, on the way to the hotel. Hack heard Lige say in
his light, courteous voice: "I'll have a drink or two with the
boys, then we'll go home." Presently Lige returned from the hotel,
passed the saloon and followed the Burnt Ranch road, disappearing
toward Mrs. Benson's house. Hack clucked his tongue in disapproval,
saw Morgan come out of the bank, and went at once toward his
partner.</p>

<p>"Stayin' around, Clay?"</p>

<p>"No," said Morgan, "I'm riding out." He saw the glitter of
Hack's gunbelt buckle. "What's up?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'. Nothin' at all."</p>

<p>"You sure? Anything I can do?"</p>

<p>Breathitt's face showed a long, quick grin. "Not a thing."</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Don't let anybody push you into the wrong stall,
Hack," and turned across the street to his horse. Hack watched
Morgan lift the saddle leather and haul up the latigo. Morgan
stepped into the saddle; he kicked his feet into the stirrups, sat
there a moment looking ahead of him, and went out of War Pass at a
long-reaching gallop. Hack thought, "I ought to be with him." Liard
Connor appeared at the bank corner, exactly opposite the point he
had disappeared from a few minutes before; whereupon Hack Breathitt
crossed Stage Street, passed the hotel and ducked down an alley. He
threshed around the broken boxes and tin cans and bottles behind
Shevlin's pool hall, made a wide sweep of this completely black
area and came into the street again near Old Town.</p>

<p>At this same moment McGeen stepped from the shadows of the
blacksmith shop. He had his head turned, watching the up-street
direction, but whipped around when he heard the strike of
Breathitt's boots. The two stood there, face to face with half the
street between them. Hack didn't say anything. He held his ground,
showing McGeen his swift, malicious grin. McGeen pulled up both
hands and caught the lapel of his coat, which was his way of
showing Hack he didn't want to draw, and afterwards he rolled up
the street toward the saloon. Connor was near the door of the Long
Grade; he saw McGeen&mdash;and started down to join him.</p>

<p>Breathitt's laughter was a soft bubble in his throat. He crossed
the street and circled the blacksmith shop at a short, jumpy run.
Behind the Long Grade he heard a man groan; he tripped over a soft
shape and went down, his knees planted on the yielding stomach of a
drunk. The drunk woke blindly and struck out windmill style with
his hands. He caught Hack Breathitt's legs, bringing Breathitt down
again; and these two wrestled around the rank-smelling barroom
sweepings, gritting over broken poker chips and cigar boxes.
Breathitt shook himself free and trotted on around the Odd Fellows'
building into a small vacant lot adjoining Gentry's saloon. The
dance-hall lights fell on the street and, hugging the side of the
wall, Hack saw Liard Connor step from Gentry's. Hack was softly
laughing again, at Connor's back. He said: "Wrong way," and watched
Connor jerk around.</p>

<p>Connor said: "All right&mdash;all right." But he wasn't talking
to Breathitt. Bones McGeen broke out of the shadows near the bank,
and so they had him on the hip. Somebody kicked out a window in the
dance hall, the glass splattering around Breathitt. McGeen had quit
advancing. Liard Connor, no longer in motion, said, "All right,"
and dropped his hands.</p>

<p>They had him hipped. Drawing, he had his one single moment's
choice&mdash;McGeen on his left or Connor in front of him; knowing
Connor to be the tougher man, he threw his shot that way. Connor's
head flew up, and the sound of Hack Breathitt's gun pounded between
the walls of the street and was drowned out by Bones McGeen's
quick-following fire. Connor fell on the walk and pulled himself to
his knees; his gun had dropped on the walk and now he crawled
forward, trying to reach it, and fell again with his arm stretched
out full length, fingers touching the gun's butt.</p>

<p>Hack Breathitt felt McGeen's shots breathe by. He snapped an
answer across the street, meanwhile plunging past the open mouth of
Gentry's toward his horse. The shadows sheltered him and McGeen's
shots crushed through the soft wood of the stable wall, wide of
their mark. Men's boots pounded down the Odd Fellows' stairway;
somewhere a woman screamed, Breathitt was on his horse, racing
along the Burnt Ranch road, when, looking back, he saw four
Herendeen men rush from the side of the courthouse. McGeen was in
front of him, but fading back from Breathitt's fire, into the
shallow alleyway beside the bank. Low-bent, Breathitt went by him,
pounding the pony with his spurs. There was a short following fire
and afterwards, in the safe darkness beyond town, Breathitt's
Indian yell sailed up. He was a fugitive then, and knew it; and
this was his way of telling them so.</p>

<p>All this had died down when Catherine Grant returned to the
hotel to spend the night. Ben Herendeen was in the courthouse with
the dead Liard Connor, and half of the Three Pines outfit had
stormed away from town on Hack Breathitt's heels. The dance was
over. One by one the rigs of the homesteaders and small ranchers
wheeled out of War Pass and lights began to die on the street.
Standing momentarily on the porch of the Mountain House, she saw
Mrs. Lige White waiting in the ladies' sitting room for her
husband. Mrs. White sat straight in the chair, hands tightly
together in her lap and her eyes fixed strangely and staringly at a
wall. Catheririe walked through Old Town to the cemetery. All talk
and all sound from War Pass reached here only as a gentle wave. The
air was soft and cool and the peace of the dead, had its way with
her. She crouched by Lila Morgan's grave, touching the headstone,
and remained this way, long-thinking and wistful. "Lila," she
murmured, "if you want him to be happy, let him go."</p>

<p>Morgan took the desert road as soon as he left War Pass, heading
northeast into the open flats. Twenty-five miles away the Fort
Smith Hills cut a black, cardboard outline against the pale night
sky. His horse was fairly fresh and wanted to go; and so he let it
stretch out. He passed a wagon, inbound; along the desert floor at
occasional intervals the little lights of the small ranchers winked
at him. This night grew cooler and the moon began to throw off a
paler shining. By intervals he pulled the big gelding down to a
walk, then let it single-foot, then sent it forward again at a long
run. An hour out of War Pass found him well into the desert. At
eleven o'clock he had reached the Fort Smith Hills and was climbing
a canyon grade. At midnight, from a summit point he looked down
upon the breaks of the Crooked River, whose rounded peaks and shale
pinnacles and bare ravines lay tinged and disheveled in the
moonlight. From this elevation he saw one lone light buried in a
far pocket, which was the location of Vane Walrad's ranch, and went
downgrade into the river canyon. Crooked River, where he forded it,
was a shallow clatter of water across gravel. He came upon a cliff
at the far side and beat his way along a rising trail, crossed a
ridge, and descended to the river again. So, alternating following
the river and cutting over high points, he pressed deeper and
deeper in this tortured country until at last he felt the gelding
slowly give out.</p>

<p>Beyond one in the morning, at, the bottom of two high ridges,
with the river still flowing between, he sighted a close row of
poplar trees beyond the stream. He passed over a swaying cable
bridge, the gelding's feet booming up enormous echoes from the
planking. Before he saw the house definitely he began calling:
"Hello there&mdash;hello, Walrad!"</p>

<p>There was a yard behind the poplars and the blurred skeletal
outline of corrals and wagons and hayracks, and a house almost
hidden by the trees. A door slammed. He passed through the poplars
to reach a front porch, and held his seat here until Walrad's voice
came at him, sleepy and uncharitable. "Well, who is it?"</p>

<p>"Clay Morgan. I'm riding straight through to Sage City, Vane. My
horse is going bad."</p>

<p>"Morgan?" said the man, and was still. Morgan heard a pair of
horses stirring in the adjoining corral. One of them softly
whinnied, and then the rancher said with a reviving cordiality,
"Sure, Clay." Coming off the gelding at once, Morgan unsaddled and
went into the corral. He caught one of the ponies there and threw
on his gear. Walrad came up, only saying: "Late for you, Clay." The
pony pitched with Morgan and was still. Clay said:</p>

<p>"This road all right? I haven't been over it for ten years."</p>

<p>"Go up the Long Grade when you hit the schoolhouse."</p>

<p>"I'll be back to pick up my horse in two days."</p>

<p>A road&mdash;a better road than he had been
following&mdash;skirted the river. The new horse was light and
restless and inclined to spend itself in a hurry and Morgan knew it
would be worn out before daylight. The schoolhouse was a blur at
the base of the eastern ridge when he reached it; and the Long
Grade cut a yellow-rising streak on the side of the ridge. In the
bottom of the canyon it was fairly warm, but as he rose with the
grade coolness moved increasingly against him. In this heart of
night the moon, so round and so pale that it was unreal, stood
against a sky cloudlessly black and washed by the powdery glitter
of stars. As the grade lifted him in one long, seemingly endless
straightaway course against the hillside, the river sank away into
the canyon's bottomless black, the rustle of its water sounding
like slow wind against trees.</p>

<p>Later the grade leveled out and he put the horse into a run; but
this was only for a brief stretch, for the ridge still showed
against him and above him, and now the grade began to loop from one
switchback to another. The horse settled to a plodding walk.
Morgan, checking his restlessness with effort, felt the priceless
time slipping by. He had covered about three miles on the grade;
and these switchbacks covered another three miles at least. When at
last he saw the black shadow give way to the velvet, undulating
shine of grasslands ahead, he knew he had lost an hour in the
canyon.</p>

<p>He set the pony to a gallop. There was the hulking shadow of a
shanty beside the road, its glassless windows speaking of ruin.
Somebody camped near it, one horse on picket, and a half-shape rose
from blankets as he ran by. Ahead of him, at unknown distance,
another barrier of hills showed a low saddle-shaped outline. He
rose and fell with the swelling contours of the high grasslands.
Moonlight put a silver, phosphorescent glow to the road's dust.
Pulling in for a brief walk, he looked at his watch and found it to
be half-past two; one hour later with the moonlight changing and
day not far away, he knew his horse was done. Nor could he see the
shadow of ranch or house ahead. He let the pony drop to a walk and
in this time-eating way covered the next half-hour. The road
climbed to a long roll of land, tipped over the crest and point
into a shallow meadow, through which a creek ran with a pale
glowing. There was a box elder grove here. Coming to the water he
let his horse drink; and heard a rustling in the low tree branches.
A tall white horse, followed by three others, came out of the
covert and stopped to scent the air.</p>

<p>Morgan reached for his rope, gently shaking it loose. He built
up a loop, holding it down beside his pony. He kept the pony in the
middle of the creek, watching the tall white horse throw up his
head and hearing its outblast of suspecting breath. The white horse
had started to turn when Morgan gave the loop a whirl and made his
throw.</p>

<p>The white horse was on the dead run then, but the touch of rope
stopped it at once. Morgan rode out of the water and dismounted,
holding the rope's free end. He kept a little tension on the white
horse, circled toward the box elders, and made a tie around the
nearest tree. The other free horses had bolted into the night.</p>

<p>Morgan walked along the rope slowly, speaking to the horse. He
came up against its head, running his hand along the beast's jaw,
and down along the neck; rope-wise, it stood still, but he felt the
stiffness of its muscles, its waiting dynamite. Afterwards he ran
back to his used-up pony, took off the saddle and carried it to the
white horse. He slid on the saddle gently, still keeping up his
talk. He got the cinch under its belly and put his head against the
white horse's-side, and waited a moment, and heaved on the latigo
and secured it. The tall animal's back feet minced around, it
tugged against the rope a little and stood still again.</p>

<p>Morgan returned to his pony and slipped off the bridle. It had
stood all this while on dropped reins; with the bridle gone it
moved away into the paling shadows. Morgan went back to the white
horse, bridled it and rolled up his rope. The white horse wound
with him and its back feet began to hit the ground. Morgan tried
for the stirrup, and missed it; he caught the horn, threw the reins
over the white horse's head and made his jump. He was barely in the
saddle when the white horse fell to pitching.</p>

<p>Morgan hit the horn with the flat of his hand to catch his
balance. His right foot missed the flying stirrup. The horse made a
half-dozen long forward pitches, kicking out with his back legs. It
whirled with him and went high up and came down hard enough to jar
Morgan's liver and throw him forward against the horn. Morgan
slashed his right toe around, seeking the stirrup, and was carried
into the air again. The horse weighed better than eleven hundred
and the jar of its landing shook Morgan's teeth and made his nose
run. He was half-off the saddle then, grabbing leather, but his
next right-footed kick caught the stirrup and, thus braced, he set
the horse on its haunches. The animal wheeled, shook itself and
started to run.</p>

<p>The Dipper was in the sky and by it he set his course. The scare
had left this heavy, hard-mouthed animal, but the bottom was still
in it and it swept forward at a long run. Morgan wiped his nose and
turned himself a little to ease the pain of his bruised ribs.</p>

<p>This was the first gray-morning's twilight, cold and empty.</p>

<p>Before him lay the rolling grasslands, bordered in the near
distance by mountains in purple-black outline. When he reached the
foothills he followed the mark of a cattle trail up a canyon; from
the summit of these hills he saw day break bright and cloudless,
out of the east. He had been partly familiar with the Crooked River
country, but this was strange land and he looked down from the
ridge into a pocket country covered with pines and crisscrossed
gulches. Dropping into it, he began to feel the effects of his ride
for the first time. It was, more than anything else, a stiffness in
the front muscles of his legs, a hungry emptiness in his
stomach.</p>

<p>Ten hours out of War Pass found him threading the pine timber.
Here and there a woodcutter's road led away and occasionally he saw
cattle grazing. He was considerably higher now, and through one
vista he viewed a patch of snow nested against the side of a
mountain, at eight o'clock, crossing an upland meadow covered by
the shadow of an iron pointed peak, he came upon a two-forked road,
no sign showing.</p>

<p>He stopped the horse to watch the sun and made his guess and
took the fork bearing northward. It led him higher by gradual
degrees and into heavier timber and brought him by a lake lying
lonely and beautiful in its green cup. He stopped to give the horse
and himself a drink, and pressed on again, shoving the big beast to
a run. The peak was a huge axis around which Morgan slowly turned
while the morning passed and the land reached its crest and fell
away. The trail came beside the churning, white- watered froth of a
river and kept to it for ten miles, thenceforth striking through a
dense stand of jack pines. Into this he went, into its sunless
aromatic twilight, into its thick silence. Dust whipped strong
behind him and the twin ruts of the road kept curving with the
falling slope; the running feet of the horse lifted almost no
report on a carpet of pine needles made by a hundred years of
falling.</p>

<p>At noon the country changed again, the pines dropping behind and
a canyon taking him down a rocky draw. Shortly thereafter a desert
of scab rock and sage smoky with fall's heat and fall's distant
brush fires, unrolled before him. Nowhere did he see a
break&mdash;either the shape of a ranch, or a town, or a moving
object. He had his moment of tremendous disappointment; and then,
completely clearing the canyon, he discovered, on his right, a
chuck wagon and a half-dozen riders seated around it.</p>

<p>He pulled over at once, but remained in the saddle until the
wagon boss said: "Get off and pitch in."</p>

<p>He stepped stiffly from the saddle, found a tin plate and cup at
the tail gate of the chuck-wagon and helped himself to the pan of
short ribs and Dutch-oven bread by the fire. He crouched here,
drinking down two hot strong cups of coffee without delay, before
touching the solid food. The mark of the long ride was on him and
on the big jaded horse, and Morgan knew that the crew, sprawled
idly under the sun, saw all this and were making their guesses. A
man on the run, they would be thinking. He finished his meal and
tapered a cigarette and lay back on the ground, propped up by an
elbow. This food hit him like a shot of whisky. It took the
heaviness out of his muscles, it made him cheerful. But he was
increasingly pushed by the sense of wasting time. He said: "Which
way to Sage City?"</p>

<p>The wagon boss drawled: "There's a trail about five miles
yonder. Keep on it. I hear old man Lowry ain't in good health."</p>

<p>Morgan thought about that. The brand on the big white horse was
Running L. Maybe that was what the puncher was talking about.</p>

<p>He said: "Never met him. I've been on the trail since last night
at nine o'clock, from War Pass. I swapped horses at Crooked River,
and roped this one off the grasslands. What I need is a fresh horse
for the ride into Sage City. I'll be back this way day after
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Not a bad ride," said the wagon boss idly, and let the silence
come on. Morgan dragged the good smoke from his cigarette, waiting
for this crew to figure it out. The smoky haze of fall was a
blue-gray ceiling over the scab-rock desert; the sun was warm but
the smell of winter was in the air, and the coming crispness of
winter was in it. This range was three thousand feet higher than
the War Pass country.</p>

<p>The wagon boss had made up his mind. He said: "No, not a bad
ride at all. Take that strawberry."</p>

<p>Morgan rose at once. His upper legs had gone stiff; he stamped
his feet on the ground and limped over to the white horse. He put
his gear on the strawberry and hit the saddle and let the horse
pitch a little before he hauled it around. "See you day after
tomorrow," he said.</p>

<p>The wagon boss nodded. "We'll be here."</p>

<p>Morgan left camp at a steady run. This horse was small and wiry
and he had a choppy pace but he seemed tough. Five miles across the
unbroken flats he reached the trail and followed it eastward over a
land that had no definite horizon. The smoky atmosphere pressed
down on emptiness. At one o'clock he fell into a ravine well below
the desert line; the road followed it a mile and swung into the
wide sink that held a series of corrals and a natural spring.
Watering the horse, he rose to the desert level again. At two he
was lost in this lonesome sweep of black rock and yellow earth and
curling land smoke, pursuing a trail which led constantly eastward
without apparent destination; running the strawberry, and walking
it, and letting it fancy-foot along, and running it.</p>

<p>At three thirty, with eighteen hours of steady riding behind
him, he came upon a main break in the road. One fork led into the
southeast, the other swung toward the north. It was now within a
half hour of the land office deadline; paused at this junction,
scanning the forward haze with an anxious eye, he made out no kind
of a blur on the horizon. This land ran straight into the cloudy
mists, flat as a board. A few fresh prints showed either road; they
were alike, these roads, as to the wear and tear of usage, and
nothing gave him a hunch except that the northern fork seemed to
head more nearly toward the spot where he thought Sage City ought
to be.</p>

<p>And so he took it, but two miles later this road brought up
before the burnt ruin of a ranch house and a few scraps of metal on
the ground. Beyond was only an unused trail. He wheeled around,
backtracked to the junction and followed the other route. Wagon
tracks came from the desert and dropped into the road, a wavering
wheel-and-hoof pattern coming out of nowhere and leading apparently
nowhere. It was then four o'clock and he thought he had lost his
race. Twenty minutes later the desert marched to a rim that fell
downward three hundred feet into a valley. The road descended a
sharp grade. At the bottom of the grade, straddling the silver
streak of a shallow river, lay Sage City, its gray housetops and
dusty streets making a toy town's pattern from this elevation. He
set the tiring pony into its last run, came down the grade and
crossed a wooden bridge. He saw the half-empty street, the
false-fronted buildings and the once-white spire of a courthouse
sitting athwart the far end of the street. When he reached the
courthouse and stepped down, a pair of men came out of the
doorway.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Land office in there?"</p>

<p>They nodded. He passed into a shadowed hall, heard voices
through a half-closed doorway, and pushed that door before him.
There was a man standing by a desk; this man was saying:
"Seventy-eight hundred. That's the bid. Another bid, gentlemen?
Another bid?"</p>

<p>There were only four other men in the room. One of them,
standing by the room's side-wall with his face turned from Morgan
at the moment, was Charley Hillhouse.</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse said: "Eight thousand," and came about and
discovered Morgan.</p>

<p>What Morgan saw on the face of this man who had so long been his
friend was the swift thin break of unpleasant surprise. Hillhouse
stared, moving gently away from the wall. This was the way he stood
during that small interval, with his feet braced apart and his
round face very shadowed by his thoughts; and then Hillhouse seemed
to close his mind as if something dreaded had at last come to pass
with all its unhappy consequences, pulled the surprise from his
face, and turned from Morgan. He said again, in a steady, stubborn
voice: "Eight thousand."</p>

<p>The other three men were speculators. It was a smell on them. It
was written on their good clothes, their white faces and their soft
hands. One man said reluctantly, "Eighty-two."</p>

<p>"Eighty-three," said Hillhouse.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Ninety-three."</p>

<p>Now the speculators looked around and moved together and one of
them whispered something and shook his head. The land-office agent
looked hopeful. He said: "Ninety-three's the bid."</p>

<p>"Ninety-four," said Charley Hillhouse.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "I didn't ride a hundred and ninety miles to play
around with a piker, Charley. Eleven thousand."</p>

<p>"Eleven is the bid," said the land-office agent. "Another bid,
gentlemen?"</p>

<p>The speculators said nothing. One of them shook his head.</p>

<p>The land-office agent turned to Hillhouse. He said: "Another
bid?" Hillhouse put his hands in his pockets, and slowly brought
them out. "No," he answered, "that's all. I've got to stick to a
limit, and we're past it now."</p>

<p>"Sold at eleven thousand."</p>

<p>Morgan stepped toward the table. "My check all right?"</p>

<p>The land-office agent showed an instant discouragement. "Of
course not."</p>

<p>One of the speculators laughed and Hillhouse made a half-turn.
"Then my bid of ninety-three is good."</p>

<p>Morgan reached into his pocket. "No," he said, dryly, "I just
wanted to know. I've got the cash."</p>

<p>Hillhouse turned from the room without further talk; the
speculators slowly followed. Morgan counted out the money, in
bills. He stood over the desk, propping both hands on its edge to
hold himself up while the land agent took his name and address and
wrote out a receipt.</p>

<p>"You'll get a deed in the next few months."</p>

<p>Morgan said: "When did you mail out notice of that sale?"</p>

<p>The land agent stared at him. "About six weeks ago."</p>

<p>Morgan folded the receipt between his fingers, creasing and
re-creasing it, his head bent down. He murmured, "Thanks," and left
the room. He passed the speculators in the hall.</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse waited for him on the porch. Charley had a
cigarette lighted. He removed the cigarette, choosing his words
very carefully; he had his eyes half closed, and stared ahead of
him into the dust-yellow, sun-brightened street.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you this, Clay. When I work for an outfit, I
stick by the outfit. I'm foreman of Three Pines and long as I am
Three Pines comes first."</p>

<p>"Tell Ben," said Morgan carefully, "that he shouldn't send a
small boy to market when he wants something."</p>

<p>Hillhouse pushed the affront aside. He was a cool-headed man,
with a loyalty that could narrow his mind. "My limit was ten
thousand. It would have been enough if you hadn't come along." He
thought about it, and added: "We should of kept that sign down
another six hours."</p>

<p>"Charley," said Morgan, "that's the first time I ever heard you
nourish a crooked idea."</p>

<p>"Don't get high-minded over a piece of Government land,"
retorted Hillhouse. "You'd of done the same thing." He gave Morgan
a searching glance. "You're figuring I sold you out. Maybe I should
have told you the same thing I told Hack Breathitt: I'm your
friend, but when it comes to a choice between you and Three Pines
I'll stick with my outfit. I'd be a hell of a man if I didn't.
Friendship has got nothing to do with business. Well, let's eat and
forget it."</p>

<p>This man had been one of his oldest companions. There had been
three of them, Hack and Charley and himself. But as he stood there
he knew it was all over. The fine thing that had held them together
was gone, the old days and the old times were gone. He knew it, as
Hack had known it earlier; and now, watching Charley, he knew
Hillhouse, for all his words, knew it too.</p>

<p>"So-long, kid," he said, and went down the street, leading his
horse. He left the horse at a stable and went on to the hotel, his
knees shaking a little as he climbed the steps. He had a meal in
the dining room, went up to a room and rolled into bed. For a
moment he lay on his back. He thought of the ride, and he thought
of Government Valley, and laughed to himself; the sound of it
rubbing the room's stillness. Afterwards, sinking swiftly into
sleep, he heard somebody come up the stairs and knock at his door.
Hillhouse called through the panel: "Clay, I want to talk to
you."</p>

<p>He turned on the bed, mentally saying his good-by to a part of
his life that had been mighty fine. He had lost another friend and
the bad times were closing in. With that thought he dropped into a
drugged, dreamless slumber.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. A WOMAN'S THOUGHTS</h2>

<p class="first">RETURNING from Sage City three days later Clay
Morgan came through a low gap of the Burnt Hills and found somebody
occupying the deserted house on Salt Meadows. It was twenty-five
miles from this point north-westward to his own ranch, and though
the shanty was an old one he had not known of nesters being in it.
A small spiral of smoke rolled from the tin chimney and when he was
halfway down the slope a man came from the house, and walked at a
rapid stride toward a small outhouse, slamming its door. This was
near noon.</p>

<p>Riding into the yard, Morgan gave his name. "You must be new
here. Nobody's tried to make a living on this spot since Yardsley
left, four years ago."</p>

<p>The man was around thirty, long and on the lean side, with the
freckled skin and dry creased lips and the gray-green eyes of a
Southerner. He looked like a worker rather than one of that
shiftless rattletrap breed Morgan had so often seen camping on the
edge of the range. He said, "I'm Fox Willing. Been here four
months." He was pretty brief with his talk, a reserved man with the
mark of a short temper on him, but there was in his eyes at the
moment something Morgan had often noticed in other nesters' eyes
when they faced cattlemen: a half-concealed hatred, a veiled fear.
A woman came to the door, young and still pretty, with pure black
hair. She shaded her eyes at Morgan; he saw fear definitely on her
face.</p>

<p>It was time to eat; in fact Morgan smelled food in the air.</p>

<p>But Willing didn't know much about range etiquette. He simply
stood his ground, waiting for Morgan to speak or ride on. Morgan
said: "Maybe you could put me up to dinner."</p>

<p>Willing was reluctant. "Sure, Mr. Morgan. Step down."</p>

<p>He watched Morgan leave the saddle and he let Morgan enter the
house first. The woman had dropped back and now laid an extra plate
at the table. They were, Morgan noticed, in the midst of their
meal. One boy, about four years old, sat in an improvised high
chair. Morgan took the new place at the table and said to the
woman, by way of breaking the ice, "A long ways from anywhere.
Mighty lonesome for you, I should judge."</p>

<p>"No," she said in a half-breathless voice, "there's enough to
keep busy."</p>

<p>Morgan helped himself to the boiled potatoes and canned
tomatoes&mdash;and to the meat. It was fried steak and when he saw
it he realized it came from one of his own cows. Seeing the man
walk so swiftly out to close the shed door, he had suspected it;
and this was why he had asked for the meal. He had the hunger of
his long ride in him and fell to the food at once, making no fuss
about the meat. He said in a thoroughly agreeable voice: "I've seen
two sets of families starve on this spot. Hate to see anybody else
go through that. What do you propose to raise?"</p>

<p>Willing ate with his eyes downcast; a taciturnity close to
sullenness covered him. The woman didn't touch her food. She sat
with her arms in her lap; a growing strain on her face. She was
about his own age and he could tell she had been through a lot of
misery. She answered for Willing. "Anything to get along, Mr.
Morgan. We've got three cows for milk and a brood sow, and I guess
some kind of a crop will come up. We'll live, if my husband can
find a little work on the ranches." Suddenly he saw the full effect
of her eyes. They were begging at him in a way her husband never
would see. Then she added, "It's not hard to live, Mr. Morgan, if
people try."</p>

<p>It was about the extent of the talk. Morgan appreciated the
meal, but he was glad when, hat in hand, he returned to the yard.
He walked toward his horse, both the Willings behind him. The shed
was only a dozen paces beyond and he had the definite inclination
to go over there, open the door, and have a look at the beef for
himself. He knew it was there and he didn't want Willing to think
Long Seven was run by a fool too blind to see the signs. He rolled
up a cigarette, trying to figure out some way of telling Willing
this without hurting the woman's feelings. There was a lot in her
and she was pretty badly troubled at this minute. Willing was like
most nesters. Cattlemen had pushed them around until they figured
it wasn't any crime to steal beef when they could. It was just
something that grew and got worse on the range. He had to call
Willing on this, but he didn't want to make it too tough on the
woman.</p>

<p>He lighted his cigarette and stepped into the saddle. There was
immediate relief on the nester's face and the woman's shoulders
relaxed; they had braced themselves for the worst. Morgan removed
his hat, smiling at the woman. "I wish both of you good luck.
You'll need it." Then, with the reins half-lifted, he added: "It
occurs to me that you may get pinched for grub this winter. If you
do, I'll be glad to see that you get a quarter of beef
occasionally. When you see any stray cattle of mine up here this
winter in the snowdrifts, just drive them back. We'll consider it a
fair exchange for the meat. But&mdash;" and now he looked at the
blank, gray-green eyes of the man&mdash;"come to me when you want
it. I do not like to think of beef butchered and wasted on the
desert."</p>

<p>The tension left Willing's shoulders. The woman's lips softened
and her eyes grew warm. After that he crossed the yard and came
down at last to the lower edge of Government Valley. Far up the
flats he saw the remnant barracks of the old fort, and for a moment
he paused to have a look at this land which now belonged to
him.</p>

<p>There was a feeling about this hard to uncover, for he was not a
self-analyzing man, never one to dig deeply into the source of his
emotions. Facing this range, its good thick layer of fertility and
its length and breadth, he came as close to it as he ever would
come. It was a strength in his chest and in his muscles. The amber
color of the short, nutritious sun-cured grass, sweeping on like a
tawny and thick-napped carpet, had a meaning; the round green spots
here and there in that tawniness, indicating water, had a meaning.
The sunshine pouring down upon it and the shadows creased into
occasional ridges, the wild, sweet smell of the land, the
stillness, the free sweep, the quick wheel of cowbirds in the
foreground and the faint blot of faraway cattle&mdash;all this had
meaning. Beneath this grass was a generous, fecund earth. A man had
to translate this richness into terms of cattle. But it wasn't only
cattle. Behind the cattle lay something else. Maybe a sense of
personal growth, of pride, of something fought for and won, of
large-handedness. It stiffened a man's backbone and made him look
at the world differently than other men looked at it. In his world
certain things stood out: weather and water and grass and cattle;
and himself against all the odds the range put against a lone
man.</p>

<p>He had his thoughts. They carried him at once into the past and
presently he sent his glance all across the flats to the Lost Hills
where, ten years before, he had started his married life with Lila.
He remembered that one year vividly, as he remembered everything
vividly that had to do with her; and he said to himself, "She
should have lived to see this. Maybe it might have made a
difference to her."</p>

<p>He slanted across the valley and rode up the narrow length of
his older range, reaching home-quarters in the middle of the
afternoon. As soon as he left the saddle old Mose gave him the
latest news: Hack Breathitt had been pulled into a fight at War
Pass, killing Liard Connor. Now Hack was hiding in the hills with
Sheriff Nickum on his trail. Somebody had said, Mose added, that
Herendeen had sent out a party under McGeen also to hunt Breathitt.
Of that, Mose qualified, he wasn't sure, but it sounded in the
nature of the Three Pines beast.</p>

<p>"I'm going to town," decided Morgan at once, "and ought to be
back around eight."</p>

<p>Old Mose said: "The way things are now, I wouldn't skylark on
the trail after dark. I've lived through a couple of shootin' times
and I guess I can smell powder stink as well as any. I smell it
now."</p>

<p>Morgan caught up a fresh horse and headed for War Pass, reaching
there slightly before six. His first errand was to go into the post
office and pay his respects to Fred Rich.</p>

<p>"Fred," he said, "that notice of sale was posted late."</p>

<p>"I took it out myself, the same day it came."</p>

<p>"They mailed it from Sage City last month," said Morgan.</p>

<p>Fred Rich's face showed a whiteness suddenly around the base of
his nose. "I guess it got held up somewhere," he murmured. But he
met Morgan's glance only for a moment, soon looking down. He had
been caught in a lie and knew it. He pushed his hands against the
counter, increasingly troubled, increasingly pale.</p>

<p>"I guess it did," said Morgan dryly, and left the post office.
He heard Rich call out, "Clay, I want no trouble with you," but he
didn't turn, hating to see any man's face show that dead, cheap
guilt. The bank was closed and so he climbed the hill to leave the
unused part of his money with Harley Stewart and went at once to
Ann McGarrah's.</p>

<p>Ann and Janet were eating supper. He sat with them, listening to
Janet's cool voice recite the little things that had happened to
her, watching the way Ann McGarrah's faint smile came and went
away. There was, he thought now, a closeness between those
two&mdash;created by Ann's affection for the girl. It was the
nearest thing to a mother's affection Janet had known; it supplied
something a growing, girl needed, which he could not give. He was
grateful to Ann for it and yet as he watched these two he felt a
doubt, though he could not explain its reason.</p>

<p>Ann said: "If you're through, Janet, run out for a minute. I
want to talk to your daddy."</p>

<p>Janet left the room. Ann McGarrah sat back in her chair.</p>

<p>Her arms were round and firm on the table. She had a way of
looking at him, straight and intent, with a shadow across her eyes.
Her lips were red and pleasant; they had a gentle strength. "What
is on your mind, Clay?"</p>

<p>"Odds and ends, I guess."</p>

<p>"Did you have luck?"</p>

<p>"I bought the piece. How did you know I was on that
business?"</p>

<p>"It was all over town, half an hour after you left." She moved
her fingers around the red cloth. "I wish," she said, "you had told
me about it that night." She quickly smiled away the reproach.
"That was a silly thing to say. You're much like I am. You live
inside yourself. Will you be taking Janet home tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd let her stay another week. She likes it here. She
gets a chance to play with her friends, and I think I'm good for
her. You're raising her like a boy. She gets your habits and your
ways of looking at things, your bluntness and your taciturnity. You
don't want her to be too much that way, too old and quiet for her
age. You want her to be a woman."</p>

<p>"She can come again," said Clay.</p>

<p>Ann gave him a smileless, wise look. "I know. You won't want to
give up anything that's yours." She dropped the thought at once,
turning to another. "I wish you'd consider this, though. When bad
weather comes and you have to board her in town for school let me
take her instead of Mrs. Stewart. I'm younger, Clay. I'm more the
age Janet's mother would be. I can teach her so much." She pointed
to a door leading from the kitchen. "There's her room and her bed
and all her things."</p>

<p>He said, quietly, "Let me think about that, Ann."</p>

<p>She said, "I can see you don't agree," and shrugged her
shoulders. She waited for him to answer, reading his silence as
best she could but not sure of him. He was never a surface man and
sometimes she missed the things he thought. Suddenly she changed
the subject again. "There's one thing I always fear: your way of
looking at Ben Herendeen. It may make you get on the wrong side of
things. I hear all the talk, Clay. I know the cattlemen are
tightening up against the rustlers and the nesters, and I know
you're not with them yet. Ben Herendeen's at the head of it. That's
why you won't join them. But, Clay, why not?"</p>

<p>He said: "Ever see one of these homestead women standing at a
shanty doorway?"</p>

<p>"Sympathy, Clay? Will that do any good? Listen. I've grubstaked
many a family out of this store. They never come back. They starve
out and go. But that's not all of it. Why should you defend Ollie
Jacks? Was it important? You knew it wasn't. And now Hack Breathitt
is in the hills, and what will you do?"</p>

<p>He said: "I'll stick with Hack, Ann."</p>

<p>"Whatever he does?"</p>

<p>He looked at her. "Whatever Hack does, it will be something
Herendeen has made him do. I'll stick with Hack."</p>

<p>"Clay," she said, "do you know where that leads you?" She had a
cool head, a smartly logical mind. "You're a man going up. Your
name means everything&mdash;credit, honesty, work, influence. Hack
is a drifter, never anything else. The law is against him now and
the cattlemen are against him. Do you want all that against you? Do
you want to have all this bitterness on your shoulders? Do you want
to ride forever armed and always listening for the crack of some
other man's gun?"</p>

<p>He said: "Had I been in town the other night there would have
been two men on the ground instead of one." He let the silence
drag, and added without any particular tone: "A man has to play his
own hand, or he shouldn't bother to buy chips. I'll stick with
Hack."</p>

<p>She let out a quick sigh, as though she had been holding her
breath. She murmured, "Herendeen&mdash;Herendeen. It is always
that, with you."</p>

<p>"It may be," he said and rose. He was solid and tall against the
lamplight; his cheeks showed the gauntness of recent riding, the
blackness of uncut whiskers. He was an unruly man with his own
convictions entirely governing him; he was unweakened and
untroubled by fine distinctions. At twenty-nine he had the
endurance and the stamina and the thorough health of a natural man;
and as she looked at him now, so thoughfully and so critically and
so, secretly in love, she saw in his eyes that gray-iron shine of
hard simplicity. In fortune or in trouble he would never be much
different; he could not be different.</p>

<p>"I guess I owe you a lot, Ann. I'm grateful."</p>

<p>She looked at him, dark and cool and quick. One small gust of
that intensity he always felt got out of her: "Gratitude&mdash;I
hate the word!"</p>

<p>He said, "I'll be back for Janet in a minute," and walked to the
store porch. He stood here briefly, watching the street until he
discovered Jesse Rusey paused in the shadows at the corner of the
hotel&mdash;an obscure shape patiently waiting. He crossed to
Rusey, observing the marshal's short solid shape swing around to
him. Rusey's voice was inflexibly courteous, giving Morgan his due,
nothing more and nothing less. "Evenin', Clay."</p>

<p>Children fled from the back alley between hotel and courthouse,
racing for a base across the street. One of them cried:
"One-two-three&mdash;free!" The scurry of these light steps was all
around Morgan in the thick warm shadows; the young laughter and the
breathless whispering was around him. He said: "Who started the
ball Friday night, Jesse?"</p>

<p>The marshal's head tipped. Secret care flowed from him. His
voice, when he spoke, was unsentimental and without favor. "They
was jiggerin' around from point to point&mdash;Breathitt and Connor
and Bones McGeen. Breathitt met Connor once, down by Old Town, but
neither of them was ready. Connor floated up the street, past the
dance hall. McGeen dropped back into the crack by the bank. Hack
showed around the corner of the dance hall, and met Connor." He
paused, weighing his words with an extreme thoughtfulness. "It was
a case of love at first sight, only Breathitt got in the first
kiss. Bones was wastin' his shots all the time, just stinkin' up
the wind. Hack got out of town two jumps ahead of his own funeral.
Tell Hack, if you see him, I'll throw him in the cooler if he does
that again. There's a rule against smokin' up this town."</p>

<p>"Tell it to McGeen," said Morgan.</p>

<p>"He's been told," retorted Rusey. "I'd tell it to
anybody&mdash;even to the Almighty."</p>

<p>A long halloo shrilled through the shadows and a cloud of
children raced down the street. Ann McGarrah waited on the porch,
slim against the store lights. Janet, out of breath and softly
giggling, trotted toward her. Morgan turned toward these two.
Rusey's cautious voice followed.</p>

<p>"There's some numbers turnin' up&mdash;maybe one's yours. If I
were you I would do no sleepin' in the saddle."</p>

<p>Ann had Janet's small bag. Morgan said, "Time to go," and
watched Ann bend down to kiss Janet. There was a good deal of
affection between those two and at this exact moment he understood
the doubt which had been in him. He was silent and solid in the
background, swayed by a resentment he could not control. There was
a need in the girl he could not supply, which was a child's love
for a mother. Ann was supplying it: But this affection belonged to
Lila, not to Ann.</p>

<p>He said again, "Time to go," and watched Ann McGarrah's face
show a darkening at his tone. Janet's hand came obediently to him
and they strolled up the street. At Gentry's he saddled Janet's
horse and boosted her up, and rode from War Pass.</p>

<p>The night was soft and luminous and fragrant. Earth's warmth
rose around them but the wind drifting from the south brought in
sharp, cool eddies of coming winter. The two of them rode in
silence across the rutted desert and took to the steep road up
Mogul.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "You did fine, Janet. I guess I was pretty proud,
sitting there and listening. Don't ever be afraid of anything ahead
of you. Never borrow trouble. Walk right up to it. Listen to the
crickets. They've been singing like that a thousand years, and
they'll be doing it for another thousand. Nothing changes, honey.
Remember that when you feel like running away. Nothing changes and
nothing ever really dies."</p>

<p>Sometimes when he talked to her like this he felt the absorbing
attention she paid him. Sometimes her mind was away on its own
dreams, locking him out&mdash;as Lila had locked him out. She spoke
suddenly and seriously, as though she hadn't heard him:</p>

<p>"Will you ever marry again, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Now why should you think of that?"</p>

<p>She said in her small, still voice: "'I just wondered. Maybe I
could like another mother." But the tone wasn't like her. It was
cautious, it held things away from him. They reached the top of
Mogul and sighted the far-shining light of Long Seven. Coolness
played increasingly out of the south; the smell of winter lay here.
There was something in her mind he couldn't reach, making him
realize she was no longer a child. At nine the world had ceased to
be all colored and wonderful to her and her thoughts were no longer
black and white and utterly faithful to childhood's simplicities;
it came as a shock to realize that she would be, from this time on,
thinking more and more as a woman thought, sometimes obscure,
sometimes with reservations he could not fathom, with always some
secret insight he could not share.</p>

<p>Making up a cigarette; he kept his eyes on the house-light,
affected by a growing loneliness. A boy would grow along with him
in his pattern; but a girl sooner or later reached the end of the
trail and afterwards went along her own. The day would come, he
realized, when she would be closer to Ann McGarrah than to him.
This was the law of life; he had taken her as far as he could with
his knowledge, with such wisdom as he had, Beyond this point she
would grow in ways beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p>He said, gently, "A pretty night. Hear that coyote? He smells
winter. So do I, but winter doesn't mean the same thing to me as to
him. That's the way of it. Not possible for us to know just what
the other fellow sees or thinks or feels. We all travel this trail
pretty much alone. Makes no difference how many million people have
gone ahead of us, it's a new road to you and a new road to me."</p>

<p>From her position at the store's doorway, Ann McGarrah watched
Morgan and Janet leave town. A few riders from Rhett's Station were
cutting up in the Long Grade and Jesse Rusey stood in the shadows
opposite the saloon, taciturnly listening to the racket. The stage
to Burnt Ranch was in front of the hotel. A customer entered the
store, claiming Ann's attention for a moment; later when she was
about to bolt the door for the night she saw the hotel's waitress,
Helen Lavalle, come quickly over the dust toward her. The girl had
been crying; it disturbed her pretty face, it turned the flirting
sauciness into unpleasant lines.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they've done to him&mdash;to Hack?"</p>

<p>Ann murmured, "Does it matter?"</p>

<p>The girl stared. "If it didn't," she answered sullenly, "why'd I
be asking?"</p>

<p>Ann watched the girl carefully. "You won't do what I say," she
said coolly, "but if I were you, I'd forget."</p>

<p>"Me?" breathed the girl, suddenly bitter. "I wish I could."</p>

<p>"I guess most women wish they could," retorted Ann, and closed
the store. She walked back to her living quarters and stood
irresolutely near the center table, irritated by Helen Lavalle's
weakness, by its inevitable cause and by the man who was to blame.
She felt this way about most men. A lone woman in a man's town, she
had too much will to accept their courtesies and their gallantries.
Behind their attitudes was always the assumption of greater wisdom
and strength which was like acid to her. She hated their code of
drink for drink, their unreasoning pride that so often led to
bloodshed, their broad horseplay which always seemed to her so
close to brutality. She hated the prejudice and ignorance they hid
behind their mask of wise gravity. She despised the gallantry by
which they were able to soften women to their desires and the easy
insincerity that enabled them to leave these women when they were
through.</p>

<p>In most things Ann McGarrah was a realist who looked upon War
Pass with eyes that were sometimes cruel and almost always without
respect. She knew she had a better mind and sharper business
judgment than most of the merchants and was contemptuous of them
because of it. It was a man's town and a man's country. One thing
they respected above all other things&mdash;physical courage. Force
was the one thing they obeyed, and had she been a man she would
have made that knowledge serve her. As a woman, somewhat ruthless
in her own fashion, she could only stand back and treat these men
with a kind of insolence that delighted and left them humbled,
uneasy and glad to be out of her sight.</p>

<p>Of them all, she respected only two men. In Jesse Rusey she felt
the same silent, cool contempt for the passing scene, the same
gray, pessimistic realism, the same belief in his own strength. And
in Clay Morgan she saw, because she loved him, all that her eyes
wanted to see in a man. Turning impatiently, she walked to the room
which had been Janet's and stood with her hand supported on the
doorsill, watching the small bed and the little kerosene lamp that
so delighted Janet. Part of her bitterness now came from knowing
she was no different from any other woman. A man&mdash;one
man&mdash;had the power for changing her thoughts and her desires,
of making her over if he chose. The weakness which compelled Helen
Lavalle, and Mrs. Lige White, and Mrs. Benson, was the same
weakness compelling her. Hating it, she could not escape it.</p>

<p>She was thinking at this moment of Clay Morgan with that intense
and single-minded absorption characteristic of her; seeing him for
what he was, the strong beliefs and attachments she could not
touch, and trying to discover in him some unguarded point through
which she might walk. Janet, she had long known, was the greatest
thing in his life. If she could work through Janet, if she could
sway his feelings through Janet...</p>

<p>But she was thinking: He must come to me, of his own will. I
don't want half of him. He's got to forget Lila. I won't take
another woman's leavings. I can't be happy sharing anything with
her. I can't crawl to him like a beggar. He's got to forget
her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. THE SEARCH</h2>

<p class="first">AS soon as he had seen Janet to
bed&mdash;listening to her prayer and to her sleepy recounting of
those happenings in War Pass which she seemed to think important
enough to tell him&mdash;Morgan returned to the front room and
found Harry Jump waiting before the season's first fire on the
hearth.</p>

<p>Harry Jump preferred to squat in front of it, rather than to use
a chair. He poked a stick of wood at the flame, camp style,
squinting at the result. He said: "Now both us and Three Pines has
used that valley and their cows were accustomed to usin' the water
and grass. I guess we'll have to ride line awhile and throw
Herendeen's stuff back."</p>

<p>"Next time I see Charley Hillhouse I'll mention it to him."</p>

<p>Harry Jump said: "Make it clear. I've seen a lot of trouble come
up in regards to cows and water."</p>

<p>"There'll be some strays," said Morgan. "Always are. Outside of
that, Three Pines will have to stay on its own grass."</p>

<p>"Then I'll ride down in the morning and push em off. Grass is
grass&mdash;and it is ours they're fattenin' on." Jump rose; thin
and bowlegged, a hard-looking character at best. His black hair
straggled down the back of his neck in flat sections, like the
ruffled neck-feathers of a crow; his forehead was narrow and broke
off to a long nose and close-set eyes. Standing on his high boot
heels he had to bend somewhat to preserve his balance, thus making
a pretty poor specimen of manhood; but on a horse he was a
different figure entirely. At the door he added as an afterthought,
"I was all along the top of Mogul today, just ridin' line. Saw
nothin' of friend Breathitt. Awful lot of dust smoke on the trails
down by Dell Lake and thataway. Expect I'll be pestered tomorrow by
some of those homemade posses."</p>

<p>"Take your Winchester along."</p>

<p>"As such," drawled Harry Jump and left the room.</p>

<p>Morgan stood by the fire, feeling the silence of the house.</p>

<p>Janet was asleep upstairs, the crew palavered idly out by the
quarters; but there was for him, recurringly, odd moments such as
these when he had the sense of missing something or of needing
something. He went into the kitchen and poured a cup of coffee from
the pot always handy at the back of the stove, and rummaged around
for a piece of pie and stood stooped over the kitchen table while
he ate. Through the window he heard Cap Vermilye drawling out a
story of his youth: "I rode up the trail with Shanghai Pierce one
year. This was '72. We were takin' three thousand longhorns from
the Texas Gulf to Abilene, Kansas&mdash;"</p>

<p>Morgan listened with half an ear, meanwhile thinking of Hack
Breathitt. He refilled his coffee cup, standing with his feet apart
in the middle of the kitchen; light struck the surface of his eyes,
setting up a quick frost-glow. Restlessness turned him out of his
tracks and made him gently circle the room. Breathitt, he thought,
would be sitting somewhere in the hills, laughing at the posses on
his trail and ironically amused at a world which could turn him
into a fugitive overnight. Morgan speculated on Breathitt's
possible hideout. The three of them, Breathitt and Hillhouse and
himself, had ridden this country for years together and knew every
hollow and ravine and windfall pit; he could&mdash;Morgan
thought&mdash;go over the country and just about pick the kind of a
spot Hack would choose.</p>

<p>He pulled the coffee cup from his lips and held it suspended,
suddenly struck by a warning. If he were familiar with Hack's ways,
so was Hillhouse. If he could pick Breathitt's probable hideouts,
so could Charley. And Charley, fast-bound to Three Pines by his
hard and narrow loyalty, would be on Hack's trail now.</p>

<p>Morgan turned to the living room, pausing there only long enough
to get his hat, his gun and belt, and to lift a Winchester from the
rack near the door. He crossed the yard, lugged his saddle gear
from the horse barn and roped a pony out of the corral. Cap
Vermilye and Harry Jump strolled forward. In these moonshot shadows
they watched him thrust the Winchester into its boot beneath the
saddle fender and swing aboard. Harry Jump said, gently: "Nice
night for ducks."</p>

<p>"I'll be riding around, here and there," explained Morgan,
"Don't know when I'll be back."</p>

<p>"Love," mused Vermilye, "is a wonderful thing. I rode ninety
miles once to let a gal slap my face. Well, the cure lasted forty
years, so I guess it was worth the ride."</p>

<p>"I'll be over in the Cache Mountains tomorrow," said Morgan.</p>

<p>Harry Jump said: "There's a lot of dry wells over there a man
can fall into. I've heard of frogs livin' at the bottom of those
things for years. But you ain't no frog."</p>

<p>"See you in church," said Morgan, and rode out of the yard. He
heard Harry Jump's answer: "Last time I was in church it was for a
funeral, so I guess I got a mighty solemn religion. If you see
Hack, love and kisses from Long Seven."</p>

<p>When he turned the prow of the Moguls the lights of Long Seven
were cut off. The moon was at three-quarter stage and so he
traveled through shadows that had the luminous, pearly shine of
fog. Mogul's summits were clear-black against the sky; as he rode
over the meadows be saw the blurred shadow of himself go forward in
lengthening distortion against the yellow grass. At the jump- off
of the meadow lands, where Mogul slid a thousand feet through pine
groves into the narrow valley occupied by Herendeen, he paused to
take his survey. Dell Lake was a silver circle, half- down the
incline. The valley itself, filled with this night's foglike mist,
was, a winding silver ribbon, He followed its course with his
glance, catching the distant glitter of Herendeen's lights, and
then his attention came back to the red- yellow glow of a campfire
in the pines. Probably a posse.</p>

<p>He dropped into the pines, leaving the strong moonlight behind.
Skunk smell, pungent and yet pleasant to a man who lived wholly
out-of-doors, lay along the slope; somewhere an antelope heaved out
of its thicket and scudded away, creating a little racket in the
thickets. This dropping trail fed into other trails, all of them
weaving a tangled, mysterious net to a stranger. To him they were
familiar and had been since childhood; thus he threaded them
without need of thought, gradually quartering toward the campfire
until its glow pulsed and shuttered directly ahead.</p>

<p>The floor of the forest was thick with needle droppings; it
absorbed the footfalls of his horse completely and so, gently
walking the pony, he drifted forward until he reached the margin of
light. Here he halted, amused that none of the five men crouched
and lying by the fire yet knew of his approach. Charley Hillhouse
squatted by the fire, idly feeding in pine branches. Two of the
other men were Herendeen riders, one was Hamp Brigham, a smaller
rancher from the Cache Mountains; and the fifth, lying full length
on the ground was Gurd Grant.</p>

<p>It was Gurd's presence which troubled him and made him
momentarily bitter. One by one Herendeen had pulled his friends
away from him, until he could no longer count on the loyalty of
any. This was the way of it when cattle country caught the smell of
trouble. His father, who long ago had gone through a range war, had
said: "When neighbors get to fighting there is no charity. Indian
torture is nothing like the meanness of friendship gone sour. I
reckon it's a special kind of hate." This was what he faced
now.</p>

<p>He heard Gurd Grant say to Hillhouse, "You got a fire big enough
to set a signal for the angel Gabriel to shoot at."</p>

<p>"'Sall right," Hillhouse answered. "We'll be pullin' out in
another hour, but the fire stays and maybe it will keep somebody's
mind occupied."</p>

<p>"Where you think you'll find him?"</p>

<p>"Not on this side of the valley. I know Hack pretty well. He
likes the Caches better."</p>

<p>Morgan spoke from the protecting shadows. "That's the way I
figure it, Charley."</p>

<p>He had a swift sample of what these men would do under strain or
surprise. Gurd Grant lunged to his feet and Hamp Brigham and the
two men in the background were instantly up, Brigham reaching for
his gun. But Charley Hillhouse, cross-legged by the fire, only
tilted his head and stared over the point of the flames, watching
Morgan drift forward. His face had gone square and hard and his
eyes were cool. Charley Hillhouse, the slow and matter- of-fact
friend of the old days, was the dangerous one of the group now,
nerveless, unrattled and complete master of himself.</p>

<p>He said: "You damned well know better than to walk into a night
camp without givin' a shout."</p>

<p>"That was in the old days, Charley," said Morgan softly, "when a
man knew who his friends were."</p>

<p>"You know who they are right now," replied Hillhouse.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Morgan. "And I see none here."</p>

<p>Hillhouse closed his mouth, lips cutting a crease against the
blocky face. A moment later he dropped his glance to the fire. None
of the others spoke. Gurd Grant stood behind Hillhouse, high
against the light. Now considering this man who was Catherine's
brother, Morgan recognized the pure shine of antagonism in the
other's eyes and had his regretting wonder at its cause. He could
not ask, for Gurd Grant was his own judge and jury and if this was
the way Gurd felt, there was no good in talking. This was the heart
and the core of Morgan's philosophy. A man made his own decisions
and his own mistakes; he made them and abided by them for good or
evil. Just as he, Morgan, wished to have this freedom and this
responsibility, so did he give it to Gurd Grant. At twenty-eight
any man was old enough to be his own keeper.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "About Government Valley, Charley. Your beef is
still in there. Send somebody over to drift it back."</p>

<p>Hillhouse remained humped over the flame. He didn't look up.
"I'll get around to it in time, I guess."</p>

<p>"The time," decided Morgan, at once matching Hillhouse's
unfavorable manner, "will be exactly forty-eight hours. If there's
Three Pines beef in the valley after that limit I'll run the tallow
right off it."</p>

<p>Hillhouse showed Morgan a thoroughly cool face. "You're tough
enough, Clay, but you ain't that tough."</p>

<p>"Another item," added Morgan. "I heard you mention something
about leaving this fire burning. You're on my range and you're old
enough to put out campfires. See that you do so when you
leave."</p>

<p>"My boy," said Charley Hillhouse with a smooth, sliding uptake
of tone, "just keep right on crowdin' Three Pines and you'll get
the fight you're after."</p>

<p>Morgan, under pressure, was a rough-and-tumble fighter.</p>

<p>He said promptly, "I suppose that's so, if you can find a big
enough army. You boys always did like size."</p>

<p>The remark struck home. It pulled Hillhouse to his feet and it
broke the reserve on his face. Facing this one-time friend and
knowing him through and through, with all the years of good times
in his mind, he made his one last grudging concession. "I'd hate to
pull a gun on you, Clay. I hope it never comes to that; but if it
does, I will. You nor any man can make me dodge whut I believe is
right. I think Three Pines is right, clean through to hell, and
I'll go right to hell with it. Don't put your corns where I'll step
on 'em."</p>

<p>Zeal burned its pure flame in his eyes. He had an unchangeable
and narrow and fire-hot faith. Morgan recognized the hard-and- fast
qualities of the man but he could not let the challenge go by.
Everything was changing during these moments, his life and
Charley's life and everything on this range.</p>

<p>"It'll be sooner than later, kid," he told Hillhouse. "Make it
now if you feel like that."</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse sighed and pulled himself together. "No," he
ground out, "I'll wait for that."</p>

<p>"All right," said Morgan carelessly and turned his horse into
the nearest downhill trail. The fire faded behind him and the slope
soon leveled into the valley floor. There was a road going
northward along the base of the Cache Mountains, beside the rattle
and murmur of Cache River; this road he followed at a steady run
until he caught up the lights of Herendeen's houses in the nearing
distance. Turning then, he forded the river at its gravelly
shallows and hit a trail rising along the side of the
mountains.</p>

<p>He was warmed by a quick and robust anger; it made him a little
careless and it made him unforgiving. In his heart was a heavy
regret from knowing Charley Hillhouse had cut away all the old ties
and taken his stand with such finality. In him too was a puzzled
exasperation at Gurd Grant's odd conduct. Yet the time was past
when he might go to them and speak reasonably. A man was his own
keeper, the judge of last resort of his own conduct.</p>

<p>He thought of this all up the trail, having his small moments of
comprehension and sadness, seeing the dark tangle of men's acts
with some wisdom and some tolerance. He knew this country, its
stubbornness, its quick temper, its self-sufficiency. Long after
the quarrel was over men would think back upon their actions and
have their regrets; but this they would never admit. It was the way
of the land; he could not change it nor could he give ground to
them, for if he did give ground he would never survive. Life had
trained him to be exactly what he was, as gentle as the gentleness
shown him, as brutal as the brutality others brought against him.
Men would live as they wanted to live; he could not better their
conduct and he passed no judgment upon them. They were exactly what
they were, for good and evil, and so was he. The land seasoned
them, it toughened them, it warped them, it made some of them
strong and wise and tolerant, it made some of them cruel. Each man
was his own answer, just as each day in this deep and lonely world
was its own answer.</p>

<p>He left it like that, climbing higher on the slope of the Cache
Mountains. Somewhere in the singing rhythm of the night, in the
drift of the breeze, in the deep rich earth or in the distant shine
of the stars, was a meaning no man caught. Now and then, riding
like this in the heart of the night, the faint edge of that meaning
softly brushed him, its chill rushing all through his nerves. This
was the nearness of it and this was its perpetual
distance&mdash;strange and wonderful and unsolvable. No man ever
caught it; all he had were these mysterious intimations to guide
him and humble him.</p>

<p>The slope of the mountain leveled into a small meadow, across
which Vance Ketchell's cabin lights winked. Wood smoke lay in
curled wisps on the still air. Going forward Morgan called:
"Vance&mdash;hey, Vance!"</p>

<p>He heard Vance's boots drag over the shanty's floor and paused.
There was this cautious interval and the dimming of the light
before Vance opened the door. He showed himself vaguely in the
doorway and quickly stepped into the yard, his bulk merging with
the shadows of the cabin wall. "Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Morgan. Did Hack ride this way?"</p>

<p>Vance delayed his answer. Then he said in a lower voice, "Come
closer, Clay."</p>

<p>Morgan went forward until Vance stood at the shoulders of the
horse. Vance murmured: "Herendeen's got somebody watchin' me." His
talk rubbed the shadows with a softness that didn't carry beyond
Morgan. "Hack passed here Friday night. Think he's up in the hills
above Freeport."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>Vance said: "You'll bump into Ben's riders along the trail."</p>

<p>Morgan recrossed the clearing. A quarter-mile southward he
struck the wide trail leading from War Pass to Freeport and settled
into a run. Darkness packed the roundabout trees but at intervals,
as he crossed an occasional small mountain meadow or the charred
area of an old burn, moonlight showed all things pale and soft. In
his mind at the moment there was a picture of the section toward
which Hack Breathitt had apparently gone, and a fairly definite
idea of Hack's possible hideout had occurred to him when the smell
of dust brought him out of his thinking; he had pulled the horse to
a walk, deep in these quilt-thick shadows of the forest, when a
man's voice came from the immediate foreground.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute."</p>

<p>Morgan hauled down. He bent at the hips, lying low enough to see
the ears of his horse against the black. Beyond was nothing but a
moving blur against the night; there was little danger here, for
the man's voice gave away his uncertainty. It was pretty certain he
had a gun lifted.</p>

<p>The man said: "Who is it?"</p>

<p>Morgan said, "You go to hell, Bones."</p>

<p>"Oh, Morgan," grumbled Bones McGeen.</p>

<p>"Get out of the trail."</p>

<p>McGeen thought about that, and didn't like it. For he said: "You
can go around me, I guess."</p>

<p>Morgan matched insolence with insolence. "I guess not, Bones.
Hack saw the color of your tail, and I think I'll see it." He hit
his pony with the spurs, driving it forward at a long jump. It
carried him against McGeen, his knee jamming McGeen's knee.
McGeen's shoulders turned and one arm lifted suddenly&mdash;all
this was a dull, shapeless scene in the black&mdash;and Morgan,
bending in the saddle, knocked that swinging arm down with his hand
and caught McGeen around the waist. Both horses were milling across
the trail. McGeen shouted, "By God&mdash;!" His gun's explosion was
like a dynamite racket in the settled stillness of the hills. The
shot struck somewhere in the high trees. Morgan used his spurs,
still holding McGeen. He dragged McGeen out of the saddle as he
plunged forward; he carried McGeen like this, McGeen slipping lower
and lower in his arms until the man's feet were hitting the ground.
Morgan's pony broke into a run, excited by the bumping of McGeen's
legs, and at last rushed down the trail at a dead bolt. McGeen
strangled up a yell and made a huge effort to get free, which was
the moment Morgan let go, dropping McGeen flat. He was a hundred
yards away before McGeen tried a shot. The bullet slashed into a
pine. Bones's cursing rose to a fever pitch.</p>

<p>Morgan called back, "The ride was free, Bones."</p>

<p>He was pleased with the meeting. It whetted his appetite for
trouble, it released some of the rankling anger, and so he ran on
with the bending and undulating trail until, from a high ledge of
the hills, he saw the lights of Freeport glittering in a canyon
below.</p>

<p>There was no foot of this section he didn't know. Now, making a
quick guess, he began to climb through the hills by one narrow
trace and another. He came to the head of a gulch, fell into it and
rode sightlessly along for a half-mile. A steady current of wind
came against his left side, cold as ice-water. At this point he
swung the pony and scrambled half up the ridge to a kind of stony
shelf. The draft of air poured out of a deep recess here; facing
it, Morgan spoke against the night.</p>

<p>"Hack&mdash;it's me. Morgan."</p>

<p>He had no answer but he sat there a long while, once repeating
the call. There was no smell of smoke and no sound at all except
for the cowlike waunnk of a bullfrog near by. Presently Morgan
dismounted and walked deeper into a natural rock fault, against a
steady play of wind. He dropped to his knees and felt the flooring
with his hands. There had been a fire here but when he lighted a
match he saw that the ashes were old. He had made a bad guess.</p>

<p>He returned to the horse and sat a little while, trying to
figure out Breathitt's probable course. This was a good hideout. If
Hack was too restless to hole up here he might be anywhere in the
hills. "But," he suddenly thought, "he's probably been into
Freeport for grub. Kern Case would know."</p>

<p>He climbed over the ridge and took another trail downgrade until
the lights of Freeport showed again. There was a rutted wood road
at this point which dropped circuitously off the hills into the end
of a narrow street. When he reached this street-end Morgan paused
to have a look, turned cautious by the night's events. For he now
knew there was no longer any safety in riding alone. Thus had the
country changed in the space of a week.</p>

<p>Freeport's street was the bottom of the gulch and its double row
of buildings were backed against the rising gulch walls. There
wasn't much to the town except a barnlike general store, a frame
hotel, a stable and adjoining corral, half a dozen empty buildings
to show the town it once had been, a few shanties, and two saloons
facing each other across the dust. War Pass, thirty miles away, had
drained the vigor out of Freeport and now it stood with its lights
shining through dust-fogged windows, darkly crowded by the
surrounding hills and living by the grace of the restless riders
who cruised these hills. It had once been young and lusty; at
present it was old and shabby and its reputation was poor. Half a
dozen horses stood along the racks. Through the saloon doors
drifted the diminished sound of voices. A man came from one of the
shanties and stood in a short beam of light long enough for Morgan
to identify the old nester Gale.</p>

<p>Morgan reached the general store, left his horse and walked into
the half-gloom, into the stagnant compound of old store smells. A
stove in the middle of the room showed its fire through square
isinglass eyes; a man stood bowed over a counter, his lips silently
framing words as he read a paper. Morgan's presence pulled him from
this chore. He said idly: "Hello, Morgan.'"</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Shank of a busy evenin', Kern."</p>

<p>Kern Case was huge-bellied and high and round-shouldered from
all his weight. He was younger than he looked but he had the
moon-shaped ungiving face of a man to whom silence was important.
"Thin shank," he said.</p>

<p>They knew each other pretty well, yet there was always a reserve
to keep, a roundabout way of talking. Out in the hills were a
hundred men who stayed there for the profit of it; in this town now
were other men who would fade through rear doors at the sound of
swift-coming horses. Kern Case, himself an honest man, held the
secrets of these others in his head. They trusted him; and he kept
his mouth shut. So when Morgan asked his question it was more like
a statement.</p>

<p>"Pretty dark to be chasing through the hills."</p>

<p>"Maybe you went down the wrong canyon," said Case.</p>

<p>"I could ride this country asleep. Maybe I guessed wrong."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said Kern Case, "a man gets tired of sleepin' on
the ground."</p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed Morgan. He turned the remark over in his head;
it meant something but he didn't get it. He backed to the stove and
warmed himself, gently rubbing the seat of his pants. Kern Case
didn't show any change on his face, though his eyes were laughing
at Morgan. "You're a long way from the ranch. Ridin' back
tonight?"</p>

<p>"Never gave it a thought."</p>

<p>Case started to speak and changed his mind. Somebody came
quickly into Freeport, a horse beating out a rhythm on the dust of
the street's far end. Case folded his hands on the table, serenely
incommunicative, listening to the horse haul up. Morgan said, "Hell
of a lot of traffic for a dead burg," and moved idly toward the
door.</p>

<p>"Twenty years ago," said Kern Case, "you'd of got shot for a
remark like that."</p>

<p>Paused by the door, Morgan watched the newcomer swing off his
horse in front of the hotel. He looked around at Case. "Times
change. So do visitors." He stepped into the store, turning to the
stove. He wheeled when he reached it, keeping his eyes on the door.
The newcomer's steps faded from the street and the silence
thickened across the town. Morgan's face was long and still; his
lips were flat, their edges pushing together. A flare of light
showed in his eyes and he stood straighter than before, he stood
balanced and attentive. The newcomer's steps broke the stillness
again, heavy and loud and coming rapidly forward. Case stared at
Morgan, reading what was to be seen. In a way it was information,
for when the storekeeper put his attention to the door and saw Ben
Herendeen there he wasn't greatly surprised. Morgan's expression
had been in the nature of a warning.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. BITTER HOURS</h2>

<p class="first">ON the same day Morgan returned from Sage City,
Charley Hillhouse had pulled into Three Pines and reported his
failure to Herendeen. Both of them had been thoroughly certain of
success and Herendeen sat in astonished silence, the back of his
neck flushing and his hazel eyes freezing on Hillhouse. Charley
felt his bad luck keenly; it was a personal loss to him, so
complete was his loyalty to the ranch, so partisan a man he was. He
rolled a cigarette, laying his shoulders against a porch post.
There was no sweetness in the smoke.</p>

<p>"If we'd kept that damned notice down another twenty-four
hours..."</p>

<p>Herendeen said: "He was at the dance Friday night, He couldn't
of seen it. That's why Harry Jump came to town in such a lather.
What'd he pay?"</p>

<p>"Eleven thousand."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you keep on?" said Herendeen, irritably. "Why didn't
you snow him under? My God, Charley, I send you two hundred miles
for something we had to have, and you buckle up."</p>

<p>"You set the limit," pointed out Hillhouse. "I went to the limit
and that's all I could do."</p>

<p>"You should have figured the limit didn't mean a thing against
Morgan."</p>

<p>Hillhouse defended himself with blunt warmth. "I'm no mind
reader. I can't guess what's in your head, Ben. When you lay out
something for me to do, either give me free rein or else be damned
sure how you tell me to do it." He threw the cigarette away. "Well,
we've lost it."</p>

<p>Herendeen said: "Maybe. Where'd he get that much money? It would
be a loan from the bank. Morgan's not that far ahead of the game."
He walked the length of the porch and back. He said, evenly: "Now
let's see him pay it back."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I don't stand by and lose that valley, Charley. To Morgan or to
anybody."</p>

<p>"Whut we going to do about the beef we got over there?"</p>

<p>"Let him fuss about that."</p>

<p>"He'll fuss, all right. You better make up your mind whut to do
when he tells us to move out."</p>

<p>"Does it worry you?"</p>

<p>Hillhouse had his pride and his own thorough belief in himself.
He showed Herendeen a long, straight stare and spoke his pointed
words. "Ben, you can go to hell."</p>

<p>Herendeen's flush increased. His anger, always near the surface,
flared out at Hillhouse. It was in his bright, bold eyes an
arrogant resentment toward this kind of talk. And yet, as swift as
he was to smash down any show of force against him, he reacted
strangely to the rebuke, accepting it and saying nothing. These two
were in great contrast, Herendeen so willful and
dangerously-tempered, against the small-figured Hillhouse with his
brief speech and his dark reserve. Yet in one respect they were
thoroughly alike, unsentimentally weighing all men and all things
on the same scales. Whatever was good for Three Pines was to be
accepted; whatever was bad for Three Pines had to be fought.
Herendeen knew this about his foreman, and for this reason
tolerated Charley's talk. It secretly amused him to see Charley's
friendship for Morgan fade against a loyalty which, once placed,
would go to any end.</p>

<p>Hillhouse said: "I know Clay better than you do. You can get
along with him, or you can fight him. But you can't straddle.
That's why I say you better make up your mind."</p>

<p>"Charley," said Herendeen, "the country ain't big enough for
both Morgan and me."</p>

<p>"So it's fight," said Hillhouse, and let the long silence fall
while he soberly considered the answer. He sighed a little and
shrugged his shoulders. "Been a long time coming."</p>

<p>Herendeen said to Charley: "Stay clear of it if you feel that
way."</p>

<p>Hillhouse shook his head. "No," he mused, "a man can't be half
of one thing and half of another. He'd be a mighty poor man. I'll
do what I got to do. If it means I lift a gun against Clay Morgan
I'll do it&mdash;and God take pity on me for it." He gave Herendeen
a searching glance. "But don't make no mistakes about Clay. When
you call his hand you better be ready to go right on with it. What
do I say to him when he asks me to move those cows?"</p>

<p>"Let him worry about that."</p>

<p>Hillhouse didn't like the answer and was on the point of saying
as much when Herendeen broke in. "Right now we've got Hack
Breathitt to find. Take out three-four men and beat up the country
around Dell Lake."</p>

<p>Hillhouse hadn't heard about that. He said, "Whut's he done?"
When Herendeen told him, he considered it over a long interval.
Afterwards his shoulders rose and fell, expressively shaking away a
good many memories. "I guess the wild bunch finally got him. Been
teeterin' on the edge of crookedness a long while. Well, I'll find
him."</p>

<p>Long as he had known Charley Hillhouse, it astonished Herendeen
now that his foreman should so calmly accept the dismal chore of
hunting down a man who had been one of his deep friends. Long after
Hillhouse had lined out across the flats, Herendeen puzzled it
around in his head. As for himself, Herendeen had no scruples to
explain why. He was a cattleman protecting his range by whatever
means necessary, with an ambition to extend that range by whatever
means necessary. A man in this land had rights if he was big enough
to hold them; if he wasn't big enough then he had no rights. This
was Herendeen's philosophy entirely.</p>

<p>But Hillhouse had in his long cool head a strange standard of
right and wrong; and a zeal as passionate as that of a fanatic.
This kind of man could do terrible things and feel terrible
emotions. He was, Herendeen thought, like a fellow packing a stick
of dynamite in his pocket&mdash;uncomfortable at times to have
around.</p>

<p>This was the extent of Herendeen's thoughts on the matter.
Turning to his horse, he lined out through the Haycreek Hills,
reaching Crowfoot at suppertime. He stopped here for his meal and
later made a little talk on the porch with Gurd and Catherine.</p>

<p>"Charley pulled out this afternoon to round up a few men and
scout the west side of the Moguls. We're after Breathitt. I've got
Bones McGeen up on the high trail, near Ketchell's."</p>

<p>Gurd said, "I'll go sit in with Charley. Where you going?"</p>

<p>"Toward Freeport."</p>

<p>Gurd said: "Better be careful. That's a tough district."</p>

<p>Herendeen let out a huge laugh as he went to his horse. "Gurd,"
he said, "'I never saw the man I was afraid of or the piece of
brush I couldn't ride through." Late fall's twilight began to
deepen around the yard; it turned the porch gray. From his horse
Herendeen watched Catherine, who had said nothing at all. These
shadows quenched the shining of her copper-red hair. But she was
strong and shapely, the roundness of her upper body having its
effect on him. Her face was a pale oval against the dark
background; her eyes were very black. When she stirred, arms slowly
rising behind her head and changing the shape of her silhouette,
Herendeen had his moment's intense desire to get down from the
horse. Had Gurd not been there he would have done so. He only said,
"See you later," and fell into the Freeport road, never forgetting
how she had looked. As soon as he had gone Catherine said to her
brother, "You don't mean that, Gurd. Stay out of it. Hack has done
nothing to us."</p>

<p>Gurd walked down the steps. "Never mind. We've got to stick
together."</p>

<p>She said: "Do you realize it is Clay's friend you're trying to
kill?"</p>

<p>"Then he had better pick better friends."</p>

<p>"You've changed," she said. "What's happened?"</p>

<p>He came back up the steps and stopped before her. "Sure, I've
changed." His voice was monotonous and odd. "Morgan had his chance
to stick with us and didn't do it. Then let him go to hell. He's
not my friend now."</p>

<p>"Listen," she said, "you'd better understand me. There will
never be a rider of the Crowfoot outfit sent after Hack, or used to
run errands for Herendeen."</p>

<p>He said, "Who's running this outfit?"</p>

<p>"You are, as long as you stick to business. What's the matter
with you lately?"</p>

<p>He seized her arm then, his face drawing near enough for her to
see distrust on it. "Next time you go over to Morgan's don't bother
to come back."</p>

<p>She pulled free of his arm and hit him across the face with her
hand. She said, "You're a small little boy, Gurd. Why don't you try
to be a man?"</p>

<p>He shouted, "We'll see!" and jumped off the porch. A moment
later he raced out of the yard, bound over the Haycreek Hills
toward the west flank of the Moguls.</p>

<p>South of Crowfoot the road to Freeport followed a crooked little
creek at the base of the Cache Mountains for two or three miles,
and subsequently, the valley petering out, took to the tangle of
crosshills, rising and falling from one pine-cluttered pocket to
another. These were the Potholes, and a part of that extremely
rugged section within which Freeport lay.</p>

<p>The clay dust of the road was a ghostly glowing ribbon unrolling
between the shadowy timber banks, and as Herendeen traveled he made
a perfect target for the rustlers and the fugitives and
dispossessed nesters who made camp in the lost hideouts of this
section. They hated all cattlemen. He knew this perfectly well and
watched the black margins of the road with a sharper attention than
usual, but it never occurred to him to turn back. In this man was a
belief, strong as a shield of steel, that no bullet would ever
reach him. This belief completely governed Ben Herendeen's
life.</p>

<p>The road, rising from the timber, reached a small burn on which
the black and gray snags of once living timber showed a stripped
gaunt pattern against the swelling moonglow. Entering this barren
spot Ben Herendeen caught the smell of dust, and at once squared
his heavy body on the saddle, meanwhile dropping a hand to the butt
of his gun. Over by the far margin of the burn he saw a horseman
drift into the pearly, diffused light and halt by the road.
Herendeen let his horse singlefoot forward and so came upon the
waiting shape.</p>

<p>The man said: "Ben?"</p>

<p>Herendeen hauled in. "Nothing wrong with your eyes, Pete."</p>

<p>Pete Borders chuckled. "How could a man miss? You throw a shape
big as the side of a barn."</p>

<p>Herendeen said: "Late for you. Or maybe a little early."</p>

<p>Pete Borders said in his easy, amused way: "Just enjoyin' a
pretty night."</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"Fire away. I guess we have done some talkin' before."</p>

<p>Herendeen said: "I wouldn't trust you out of sight, Pete, and if
I ever caught you with one of my cows I'd hang you higher than a
kite."</p>

<p>"Ain't ever caught me, Ben."</p>

<p>"Remember what I'd do if I did," retorted Herendeen. "Do your
stealin' in other places and we'll get along. I propose to run
every haywire rider out of this country in short order but if you
stay clear of me nothin's going to trouble you at all. I can use a
fellow like you once in a while." He thought about it, letting the
silence settle gently between them. Then he said: "Go up to
Government Valley and work over Morgan's stuff. He's too short-
handed to watch that end of his range."</p>

<p>"Ben," said Borders indulgently, "you sure make me ashamed for
bein' a piker. You're a bigger crook than I ever thought of
bein'."</p>

<p>"You grind your coffee in one mill and I'll grind mine in
another," said Herendeen, taking no offense. "I can make it hard
for you, or let you alone. Just work along like I said."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Borders. "But keep your riders away from that
district at night so I won't be bumpin' into 'em. I got to cross
your range."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Herendeen and ended the interview by putting
his horse into a run. Three miles onward he dropped down the head
of a gulch into Freeport's street and left his horse before the
hotel. He walked over to the Yellow Front saloon, had a drink and a
close look at the four or five men around the room, and left the
place, knowing that his entrance had sent most of the saloon's
crowd out the back way. Traveling up the walk he discovered
Morgan's horse and turned into the store at once.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pete Borders dropped into the Potholes, swinging
through the maze of secret trails and vanishing completely in this
tangled country. As he rode he rehearsed the meeting with
Herendeen, his swift mind playing upon all that had been said and
all that it might mean. He had no illusions, no scruples, no
faithfulness to any man or to any cause; he lived by and for
himself with a wholehearted completeness; he trusted no living
creature. Between Herendeen and himself was an understanding of a
sort, but this arrangement, born of self-interest, was a sketchy
and dubious liaison that would last only as long as Herendeen found
it useful; after that Herendeen would be on his trail.</p>

<p>These things he considered and suddenly, struck by the gray,
tricky humor of it, Pete Borders began to laugh, those loud free
echoes racing all through the Potholes in bounding waves&mdash;as
shocking as the scream of an animal.</p>

<p>Morgan stood with his back to the stove, gently rubbing his
hands along the seat of his pants. Kern Case, grave and unmoved,
murmured: "Evenin', Ben."</p>

<p>For the moment nothing else was said. Herendeen ignored Case,
studying Morgan with his round hazel eyes half-shut. He filled the
doorway with his heavy legs and high, huge shoulders; he touched
the casing of the doorway with his hands. Light deepened the ruddy
color of his face and struck up a frost-thin sparkling in his
narrowing eyes. The silence was deep and ever-thickening, as though
the thoughts of each of the three men slowly filled and charged it
with trouble.</p>

<p>Morgan brought his hands forward, reaching for his tobacco to
make up, a cigarette. This was the length of the silence. When he
struck a match and cupped it to his face he stared over the rim of
his fingers, reading Herendeen with a steady interest. The man had
swung into the room quickly, as though to surprise somebody; and he
stood now with his thoughts pretty much on his face, his glance
rummaging all the dark corners of the room. Morgan thought he knew
the answer to that. Herendeen had expected to find Breathitt
here.</p>

<p>Herendeen abruptly crossed the room, his weight squealing
against the worn floorboards, and walked to a rear door. He turned
the door's knob gently, he kicked the door open.</p>

<p>Kern Case's voice echoed his dislike. "Get out of there, Ben.
That's my room."</p>

<p>Herendeen was in it, moving around slowly; he came out again.
Somewhere above them a board snapped, throwing Herendeen's head
instantly upward. Herendeen stared at the ceiling and back at
Morgan.</p>

<p>"If you're here, he's here."</p>

<p>"You could close that door," murmured Kern Case.</p>

<p>Herendeen stared at Morgan, his lips pressed together. He was
faintly smiling, hard and certain and slowly keyed-up by his
temper. "He's here," he grunted. He walked on to the front door. He
put his back to Morgan, watching the street.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Keep your eyes open, Ben."</p>

<p>Herendeen didn't turn. He said, "I see nothin' to be afraid of,
Clay. As far as you're concerned, I never did." He stepped to the
porch and wheeled around, looking upward at the second-story
windows of the store. He held the hard-creased smile on his lips;
he teetered on the balls of his feet and drew his gun. He fired at
the window, breaking the glass, and walked into the doorway again,
swinging around to watch the street.</p>

<p>During the last ten minutes men had quickly and quietly drifted
out of Freeport until now only a few horses remained at the racks.
A rider ran from the saloon, on the heels of the shot- echoes,
jumped to his pony and raced away. Herendeen lifted the gun and
sighted this man along the barrel casually and deliberately as
though testing his aim. He let the gun drop, wheeled and walked off
the porch. Morgan heard him threshing all around the store, along
the back wall and down the alleyway to the street again; he came
tramping into the room, his bright eyes clouded up.</p>

<p>"Case," he said, "this is a crooked town full of bums. I can
make 'em run. There ain't a white man in the place."</p>

<p>Kern Case said: "That windowpane will cost you six bits."</p>

<p>"Charge it on the account."</p>

<p>"What account?"</p>

<p>"My beef account," said Herendeen. "Your friends keep you pretty
well supplied, don't they? If I had a couple men to block off this
damned joint I'd go through these rattletrap buildings and drag
Breathitt out by the back of the neck. He's here."</p>

<p>Kern Case walked around the counter. He started to speak, but
Morgan waved him back. "Maybe," Morgan said to Herendeen.</p>

<p>"Charity and light again," murmured Herendeen. "A crook's a
crook, Clay. And a man that plays with crooks is the same."</p>

<p>"Large remark," said Morgan.</p>

<p>Herendeen looked down at the gun in his hand. He reholstered it.
His shoulders lifted, tightening the gray cotton shirt he wore. He
was high and thick and unbreakable before them&mdash;and his eyes
laughed at Morgan, hot and insolent and full of memory. "Clay," he
said, driving each word across the silence, "this country is full
of yellow-bellied quitters. I propose to run 'em out of here. I'd
do it alone if they'd stand in front of me instead of slidin' into
the brush. For that matter, I'd go into the brush after any man.
I'd walk up to him if he held a pair of guns at me and I'd smash
the damned things into his teeth. That goes for the crooks and the
nesters, and"&mdash;he drew his long breath, holding Morgan's
attention with his bitter eyes&mdash;"it goes for their
friends."</p>

<p>Kern Case took a backward step and got behind the counter. He
slouched over it, his big hands flattened on the counter's surface.
He watched these two.</p>

<p>Morgan said, "You can say it in shorter time, Ben."</p>

<p>This was a quarrel ten years old and never settled. All the old
memories were like hot coals deep-buried but ready to burn at the
first touch of fresh air. This was a quarrel rooted in their
muscles, in their bones, in their nerves. Behind indifference,
behind their years of grudging tolerance of each other, back of
their smiling and their silence, it had always existed&mdash;this
detestation, this smoldering antagonism, this brutal chemistry of
will and instinct. Herendeen knew it. Morgan knew it. There was
reason for all of it, but had there been no reason it still would
have existed. They were two organisms destined to fight.</p>

<p>Herendeen lashed his answer back at Morgan. "Maybe I can. You
made a statement in War Pass last week. I'll take that up now."</p>

<p>"Take it up," said Morgan, so slurringly soft.</p>

<p>"By God," shouted Herendeen, "I'll drive you out!"</p>

<p>"Ben," said Morgan, "I guess I'd better leave my mark on you as
I did once before."</p>

<p>It was acid dropping on an old sore. Herendeen squirmed at the
memory; Herendeen's eyes yellowed up and lost reason. Herendeen's
hand brushed the top of his gun&mdash;and this was a motion Morgan
watched in that cold critical moment, never believing Herendeen
would draw. It wouldn't be that quick and final way. It would be as
it had been long ago, a drawn-out torture, a slugging, brutal
fist-fight to erase Herendeen's malign recollection of that older
battle. He was still by the stove, glance pinned to the butt of
Herendeen's gun. Immediately afterwards, Herendeen's hand came away
from it and Herendeen's boots seemed to crush into the floor as he
jumped forward.</p>

<p>Bringing up his arms, Morgan realized he had his own chance to
draw&mdash;and refused the chance. Coldness and quick running shock
stabbed through him, and he knew something gray and dismal about
himself then; he knew that this meeting had been a long- waited,
long-wished-for desire in him. He started to move away from the
stove as Herendeen's whole bulk swept at him; and stopped to
smother Herendeen's fists as they drove in. He knocked the blows
aside, no more. Herendeen's onrushing body caught him and drove him
against the stove. He slid along the edge of the stove, falling
backward. Herendeen hit the stove. Both of them dropped behind it,
Morgan bringing up his knees and beating the wind out of
Herendeen's belly. Herendeen sprawled aside. The stove had gone
down and the pipe began to fall in disjointed sections, sifting
warm soot on them. Rolling half around, Morgan saw Herendeen push
himself half erect to come at him; he doubled his legs and shot
them out and caught the big man full in the face with the sharp
heels of his boots. He rolled again and was up.</p>

<p>Herendeen lifted himself from the floor, dashing a hand across
his face to scrub the bright quick blood on his cheeks. Morgan's
sharp heels had chopped the flesh of Herendeen's lips; one raw
strip hung down, redly swaying over his mouth. The impact
momentarily drugged him, it took him off his guard. Morgan moved
in. He punched a fist into the wide, hard pit of Herendeen's
stomach, watched Herendeen's arms fall, and hit him again in the
soft neck flesh. Herendeen's face showed sudden pallor and he
swayed a little, windless and shocked. Morgan drove his aimed blows
at the huge jaw, hooking his punches up against the long shelving
chin. Herendeen dropped his head and Morgan, missing his target,
smashed his knuckles on that rock-hard poll and felt pain knife
along his left arm; it was a sudden agony that made him suck in his
wind. He caught the dulling of Herendeen's eyes; he had this man
half knocked out&mdash;and the old, violent savage instinct rushed
him in until he was at close quarters, trying for the kill.</p>

<p>It was a mistake. Herendeen's great outsweeping arms caught him
in a bear's grip and drew him in, crushing his ribs. Morgan's arms,
thus held, could reach nothing; he pulled himself backward, seeking
to break the grip, but Herendeen held on, weathering through his
punishment, tightening his grip until Mergan felt his skin burn and
seem to burst. There was a swollen tightness in his face and neck,
his breathing came out of him short and insufficient, each spasm
straining his vitals. Herendeen's arms kept tightening, they buried
themselves viselike into Morgan's flanks so that Morgan's kidneys
sent up a tortured signal.</p>

<p>He was using up his strength against the great weight of this
big man, wearing himself down. He fought backward, seeking to carry
Herendeen away from the counter. Herendeen, so huge and heavy,
would not move. Morgan lowered his head and rammed it into
Herendeen's chin, bearing the roar of that impact through his
skull. He pulled one knee behind him, and drove it into Herendeen's
crotch.</p>

<p>Herendeen cried out and his arms let go and caught Morgan afresh
at the front of his shirt and hurled him away, so hard that
Morgan's feet left the floor. He struck half-across the room and
tripped backward and went down on his shoulder blades. His head
cracked the floor and a kind of thunder rolled through his brain,
thunder and bright streaks of fire, followed by numbness.</p>

<p>He lay on his side, pushing his arms against the floor but
finding no strength in them. He could move them but he had no
feeling in them. All this room was gray-black and Herendeen was a
blurred shape across the room, slowly trudging forward. He heard
Herendeen say something, though he couldn't make out the words.
Herendeen, coming nearer, grew taller and broader above him.
Herendeen's foot struck him solidly at the base of the
spine&mdash;and this brutality was a new stream of pain along his
nerves. It moved Morgan around on the floor, loosely as though he
were a straw dummy. He rolled completely over, coming against a
cracker barrel. He was on his hands and knees, looking up with
clearing eyes; Herendeen came on very slowly.</p>

<p>Morgan got behind the cracker barrel. He held to its top rim and
pulled himself up as Herendeen walked against the cracker barrel.
Herendeen swept one fist out, striking air as Morgan jerked back.
Herendeen started around the cracker barrel, flat- footed and
patient. Morgan, still on the defensive, still weak from his
beating, kept circling. Suddenly Herendeen stepped back from the
barrel, took a half-dozen side-steps and seized a chair. He whirled
it ever his head and flung it at Morgan. Morgan dropped behind the
cracker barrel and rose again, seeing Herendeen at once rush
forward. Herendeen seized the cracker barrel with his hands and
swept it aside, diving at Morgan.</p>

<p>They were back in a corner of the store, deep in the harness
racks and leather goods and hardware. They were against the
shelves, trapped here. Morgan saw the brute patience, the dull and
fixed will on Herendeen's bloody cheeks, he saw Herendeen's head go
down, signaling a charge. As for himself, Morgan reached for wind,
and could not find it; his lungs grew shallower and shallower.
Snarled in harness, stepping through fallen boxes, grinding his
boots around a capsized keg of nails, he watched Herendeen set
himself on his huge legs for a rush and knew he could not take the
terrific punishment of being slammed back against the shelves.
Herendeen's motions were slower and slower; exhaustion was working
on him as well. Morgan saw it and made his gamble on it. Shoving
himself forward with his arms folded against his chest, Morgan
caught Herendeen as the latter came out of his low crouch and flung
him backward.</p>

<p>This last huge wrench of muscles was all he could momentarily
manage; it was as if a hole had opened near his heart to gutter
away the last of his energy. He stood with his legs wide apart, his
arms hung full length and dead-still. Dryness froze his throat so
that he could not swallow; his leg muscles were dead and the pit of
his stomach set up a steady trembling. Thus spent, he watched
Herendeen stoop and seize an ax-handle from the floor. Herendeen
lifted it with both hands and stared at it with a kind of exhausted
interest, as though he did not quite know what he had.</p>

<p>This was the interval in which Morgan saw, through blurring
vision, Herendeen for what he was. Battered and ready to drop, the
torn fleshy strip of lip dew-lapped across his mouth and his face
and shirt drenched by his own blood, there was nothing left in him
except the one oxlike instinct to destroy or be destroyed, It was a
fixed, red-shot gleam in his eyes; it was a dull mask on his
face.</p>

<p>Morgan knew what Herendeen meant to do before Herendeen's mind
had recognized the ax-handle; and now Morgan, looking around him,
saw a rack of new Winchesters on the wall. He seized one by the
barrel, kicked his way out of the debris of nails and harness and
circled Herendeen slowly, the butt of the rifle lifted like a club.
Herendeen moved slowly forward, following Morgan's circle.
Somewhere, as from a great distance, Morgan heard the rush of
horses along the street and a voice calling. But this was a dim
sound in the background, drowned by the shuffle and scrape of his
boots and Herendeen's boots as they moved around the floor, and by
the lunging, steamy exhaust of their breathing. Herendeen had the
ax-handle lifted to his shoulder, like a bat. His head was lowered.
Morgan catching only the thin, up-slanted flare of his eyes. They
kept circling the room, too exhausted to waste motion in feinting;
they circled the capsized stove, the sections of tin pipe rolling
around their feet. They drifted into a front corner, and out of it,
Herendeen's boots stepping doggedly in the tracks left by Morgan.
Outside was a fresher, nearer call: "Hey&mdash;Ben&mdash;Ben!" Kern
Case moved away from his counter and stood by the room's swinging
lamp. He held his hand by it, ready to whip out the light; his
fleshy face followed these two fighters with a gray, strained
fascination.</p>

<p>They were drifting back again to the far corner. Morgan stepped
aside from the nails, coming nearer Herendeen, and he moved the
butt of his rifle a little. Herendeen made a small sound in his
throat and swung the ax-handle in a great sweeping circle at
Morgan's head. Morgan jerked back, feeling wind breathe against his
face, and brought the butt of the gun full down on that spot where
Herendeen's left shoulder joined his neck. The ax-handle dropped.
Herendeen's great legs broke at the knees and he fell with his
hands protectively before him, the heaviness of his body shaking
the whole building. There was the clear crack of a shot on the
street and the on-racing pound of a man's feet along the store
porch. Kern Case whipped out the light, throwing this room into a
solid black.</p>

<p>He was saying in a softly rubbing whisper: "Stay there, Clay.
Stay there. Herendeen's crew is in town."</p>

<p>Morgan backed against the hanging harness. He put his shoulders
to this flimsy support; the harness gave way and he sat down, still
gripping the Winchester by the barrel. He could not draw wind into
his lungs; he was starving for air, his heart beat against his ribs
and his head was light. He rolled over, sucking wind through his
teeth, with his face to the floor; and heard a voice at the
doorway, calling into the blackness.</p>

<p>"Who's here?" It was Bones McGeen's voice.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. "YOU WILL LOSE
EYERYTHING!"</h2>

<p class="first">KERN CASE called softly through the blackness,
"Keep out of here, Bones."</p>

<p>"I'm comin' in."</p>

<p>Kern Case's voice was a lower and lower murmur. "Make a step and
I'll blow your chest out."</p>

<p>Bones yelled into the store, "Ben, you there? Hey, Ben!" A shot
broke along the street again, quick and hard, and other men ran
rapidly across the dust. Bones McGeen swung from the door, rushing
down the porch. The shots came in regular method; and the Three
Pines men were beginning to answer, all the racket boiling up the
dead echoes of the town.</p>

<p>Kern Case said, "I hope you've killed the&mdash;," and his easy
voice laid terrible words on the past and present of Herendeen. "If
you ain't I'd like to finish the job. You all right, Clay?"</p>

<p>Clay Morgan said: "Who's shootin'?"</p>

<p>"Breathitt started it. He's up in the hotel. That's what I was
going to tell you when Herendeen came in."</p>

<p>Morgan pulled himself from the harness and found his legs
snarled in it. He sank back to the floor and rolled clear and stood
up. Light flashed red before his eyes, though there was no light in
the room. His head ached in long, solid surges of pain, from the
base of his skull all around to his nose. He tasted his own salty
sweat, his own blood. He drew deeper into his lungs for wind,
catching the throb of his ribs. His left fist began to send up its
steady racket and he knew then he had broken a knuckle. He could
not move the middle finger.</p>

<p>Kern Case said: "That you?"</p>

<p>Herendeen's boots scraped the floor. Morgan bent down, catching
Herendeen's shadow, on all fours against the faint light of the
doorway. He saw Herendeen come up and weave toward the door. He
said to Case: "No."</p>

<p>Kern Case called: "Stop right there, Ben."</p>

<p>Herendeen moved on toward the door. He was out of it before Case
got around the counter. He was on the street, calling through the
spotty racket of the gunfire. "Bones&mdash;come here!"</p>

<p>Kern Case swore in the same, passionless voice. "I should of
shot the&mdash;. Now we're in trouble." He stepped around the
floor. He said: "Duck." The front windows clattered down before the
sudden veering of gunfire. Slugs struck the store shelves. A can of
wet goods, punctured, began to spill out its fluid with a gurgling
irregularity. Another slug, striking metal, went Whanng.</p>

<p>Morgan crawled across the floor. He flattened himself near the
doorway, catching a slanting view of the street-end. His horse,
spooked by the firing, had drifted away from the hitching-rack into
the farther shadows. Meanwhile he heard Herendeen, calling from the
Yellow Front saloon. "Get your horses off the street, Jim&mdash;"
One more bullet struck the shelves. Kern Case said, so smoothly
outraged, "I'll have a little slice of this," and walked back
through the store. Rolling over to the opposite edge of the
doorway, near the counter, Morgan heard Kern Case's fat weight
groan up a back set of stairs and across the second floor. From his
new position Morgan saw a Three Pines hand lead four horses into an
alley. At the moment there was no firing; but, watching the Yellow
Front, Morgan caught a flutter of light on its windows and stared
steadily at it, not immediately understanding the source of that
flash.</p>

<p>Kern Case had reached an upstairs window and now waited for his
chance. Somebody ran along the back of the store and came through a
rear door. Morgan rolled against the base of the counter, listening
to those quick steps advance. He heard Hack Breathitt murmur: "You
there, Kern?"</p>

<p>Morgan said: "How you like our little party, kid?"</p>

<p>"Clay? Whut the hell you doin' here?"</p>

<p>Morgan watched the saloon windows grow brighter, though there
was no fire inside the saloon. The deep roar of another gun began
to plow up the silence on the street. Hack Breathitt came forward
to stand at the edge of the doorway. "That's Gale's buffalo gun.
Old nester's got lots of spunk. Hey, Morgan, you smell smoke?"</p>

<p>"Fire someplace. See the saloon windows?"</p>

<p>Breathitt hooked his body around the doorway and ducked back
again. A bullet breathed through the doorway, landing on the store
wall. He said, "The hotel's burnin'."</p>

<p>"Keep your smeller out of sight if you don't want it carried
away," warned Morgan.</p>

<p>Kern Case came down the stairs with a fat man's slow haste. He
said: "We got to get out of here, Clay."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Hack. "We depart from hence, mighty damned
hence."</p>

<p>"You all right, Clay?" said Case.</p>

<p>Breathitt grew interested. "Why wouldn't he be all right?"</p>

<p>"I tripped on a rug," said Morgan. He followed Case and
Breathitt through the back quartets. The three of them paused by
the back door while Case scouted the roundabout shadows; afterwards
they drifted along the building line and paused halfway between the
street and the down-bearing timber of the hillside. Light began to
brighten at the other end of town; smoke-smell drifted with the
wind. Morgan saw his horse in the shadows ahead of him and went
over for it. When he came back he hard Case say in his even
tone:</p>

<p>"My dad built that store. I was born in it&mdash;and all my
brothers and sisters. But she'll be nothin' but ashes in two hours
from now. There ain't a single way to stop this whole town from
goin' up." He let out his sigh. "Well, it was a good store. I'm
goin' back to get my mother's rocker."</p>

<p>Breathitt said: "Come on, boys, we'll have some fun."</p>

<p>Kern Case murmured: "They'll be pullin' out pretty soon. Let 'em
go." He added in the gentlest tone: "My time will come, Hack, I'll
have my fun." He went back to the store.</p>

<p>Gale's gun had stopped booming. Listening, Morgan heard the
smelling rumble of the fire and felt the air being sucked around
him, toward it. Beyond was the echo of a voice and he thought he
heard horses running in the distance. Breathitt said: "They'll be
headin' home." Light stained the shadows and Breathitt, facing
Morgan, suddenly put his face quite close to him. "My God, you been
shavin' with a hammer?"</p>

<p>"Rug had spikes on it," said Morgan. Kern Case came back, out of
breath, bearing his rocking chair. He sat down in it, teetering it
back and forth.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Let's go."</p>

<p>"No," said Case, "I guess I'll stick around."</p>

<p>"Good idea," said Breathitt. "Maybe we can roast a steak when it
gets warmer. What you doing over this way, Clay?"</p>

<p>Clay got stiffly on his horse. "Where'll you be, Hack?"</p>

<p>"In the Potholes. Around the scrub-oak spring."</p>

<p>"Better come back to Long Seven," said Morgan. "Herendeen won't
get off your trail now, Hack. You've got no business fooling around
here."</p>

<p>Light broke the shadows. He saw Hack's face set in its restless
half-smile and realized his partner found a malicious satisfaction
in this chase. That was Breathitt's way. He had a wild kink in him
and he was tough enough to run his luck out to the bitter end. Hack
murmured: "Later, maybe."</p>

<p>Morgan said, "Get out of this light. If you bump into trouble,
kid, you know where to come."</p>

<p>Hack raised his head. He said, "That's whut you came down here
to say, wasn't it?" He was no longer smiling. His face was in the
shadows, his voice was grave and troubled. "I guess I have brought
a hell of a lot of trouble down on my friends. I'll remember it,
Clay. If I don't see you again soon I want you to know&mdash;" This
was as far as he got. He shrugged his shoulders, only adding,
"So-long."</p>

<p>Morgan turned up the trail, winding with the steep grade until
he had reached the last high point before going into solid timber.
From this elevation he looked down on the white-red tangle of high
leaping flames. The roof and sides of the hotel were eaten away and
what he saw now was the inside skeleton of the building penciled
darkly against the swirling fire. One wall of the store had caught.
All the surrounding gulch was day-bright and he made out Gale and
Gale's family slowly crossing the head of the gulch, toward the
Potholes. Herendeen, apparently, had gone. Some of the adjacent
trees began to catch, fire licking up the resinous trunks and
exploding in the dry branches.</p>

<p>It was beyond midnight when he reached home. Harry Jump,
nighthawking around the yard, followed him into the kitchen and
watched him strip down to the waist and wash. Morgan's cheeks
showed the battering of Herendeen's fists. There was a long welt on
his right flank which astonished him, for he could not remember how
it had happened. Behind his right ear was a hole an inch long and
cut to the bone; his knuckles were slashed. His middle left finger
was broken.</p>

<p>"No," said Harry Jump, taking up where he had left off some
hours before, "I guess it wouldn't be love. Funny I didn't hear any
dynamite explosion tonight."</p>

<p>"Met a man," answered Morgan.</p>

<p>"You took a gun along," pointed out Harry Jump.</p>

<p>"Not for this man," answered Morgan. "We resumed an argument of
long duration. Didn't finish it last time."</p>

<p>"And you ain't finished it this time either," opined Harry Jump,
"if he's still alive."</p>

<p>Morgan went up to his bed and lay there, his brain pulsing
within its skullcap and strong pain traveling through his left arm
from the broken finger. It made him remember the older fight. Both
of them had been younger men, soon recovering from the misery of
that beating. This one would stick, it would be buried physically
in them as long as they lived, and the sting of it would never
leave their minds.</p>

<p>He knew now that he would never be able to ride through the
country in the old free-and-easy style. Herendeen's face and eyes,
near the end of the fight, had shown him a purpose that would not
die. Even in the last stages of exhaustion, when Herendeen was on
the edge of dropping, that resistless thing carried him on. Other
events too had changed the country. The flames of Freeport made a
kind of signal, and Gale's buffalo gun, howling against the Three
Pines men, was a signal. Charley Hillhouse was in the hills hunting
Breathitt&mdash;and Breathitt, with that bitter half-smile on his
face, would not run away.</p>

<p>Herendeen had done this by his fixed rule or ruin policy. The
nesters and the stray crooks in the Potholes, and all the little
ranchers, would be making up their minds. Gurd Grant and Lige
White, and maybe a few smaller cattlemen, had to go with
Herendeen&mdash;they could do nothing else now. It was like the
fire at Freeport. Once started nothing could stop it.</p>

<p>He pushed his palm across his eyes, sleepless and aching and
hard-pressed, slowly thinking his way through the puzzle. He was in
the middle of this, high and dry between Herendeen and the other
side; "the other side" was the crooks, for whom he had no sympathy.
But "the other side," also, was the little men, like Gale and Vance
Ketchell and Hack, and the nester family back on Salt Meadow. Lying
here, he saw his own range clearly. He had spent his ten years
building it, he was a rancher in the class with Herendeen and if he
fought Herendeen now it meant that he stood to lose all that he
had. For he knew Herendeen's strength, and he knew the ways by
which Herendeen could clean him out. They were ways as old as
cattle land was.</p>

<p>At two in the morning, his broken hand on fire, he dressed and
went downstairs; he lighted a lamp in the kitchen and shaved
himself for want of something better to do&mdash;watching the
bruised patches of his face slowly change color. He stoked up the
stove and put on the coffeepot; and sat on the porch in the moon-
shot heart of night. Wind drifted across the flats, cold and sweet.
Harry Jump appeared from the shadows, saying in his sleepy,
irritable voice, "Well, if you're goin' to stay up I'll turn
in."</p>

<p>Morgan got up from the chair, unable to take the punishment of
his hand by sitting still. He went in and drank his coffee, black
and hot, and returned to the yard, pacing out through the long-
thrown shadows of the poplars. The weathered juniper poles of the
corral showed whitely in the moonlight; across the valley the
outline of the hills was very clear. There was nothing to break the
silence; even the night creatures at last grew still. And so he
watched this land, his land, slowly turn through the night from
glowing shapelessness to the first hard shadows of false morning. A
streak showed over the eastern hills and the horses began to stir
in the corral. At four he heard the cook cross the kitchen,
asthmatically coughing; at five, drawn and wire-nerved, Morgan ate
breakfast with the crew.</p>

<p>He said to Jump, "I'll be in town for a couple hours. Stick
close to the house until I get back."</p>

<p>Afterwards, all his muscles sore and strained and ragged, he
climbed the stair's to Janet's room and stood a moment by her bed.
She lay in a curled bundle, both hands drawn near her face. Her
lips were soft, almost on the edge of a smile, as though her dreams
were pleasant; and this way, unconscious of him, she showed Morgan
a childish sweetness that held him there, long- wondering and
strongly moved. It was that little-girl look, full of faith and
belief, which struck him so hard. It would not, he realized, be
with her much longer. He left the room reluctantly, got his horse
and lined out for War Pass, reaching town beyond sunup and going
directly to Charley Padden's house.</p>

<p>Charley was the only doctor in the country, a man turned rough
and blunt by the kind of practice he had, somewhat profane and
apparently calloused to pain in others. When he saw the broken
finger and the bruises on Morgan's face, he said: "The other
customer came in before daylight. I took four stitches in his lip.
This is going to make you squirm, Clay. Want a drink of whisky
first?"</p>

<p>"No," said Clay, "go ahead and don't talk so much."</p>

<p>Half an hour later he left Charley Padden's with his hand
splinted and wound in tape, leading his horse. He stood a moment at
the corner of the post office, dragging in the smoke of a cigarette
Padden had rolled for him. He was damp and cold with his own sweat
and his lips were narrowed down at the corners. Parr Gentry was, at
the moment, opening up the stable doors; a roustabout swept the
sawdust and debris of the previous night's play out of the Long
Grade. On the edge of riding back to the ranch, he saw Ann McGarrah
come to the door of her store. He turned that way.</p>

<p>Her eyes, so large and so dark, went over him swiftly, seeing
the damage of the fight. The story was on him and she was wise
enough to draw her own conclusions. She showed no sympathy and she
said nothing but she put her hand to his elbow and drew him into
the store. She had her back to him for a moment. When she turned,
facing him again, he noticed the dramatic change in her eyes. They
were black, they were alive with old, deep feeling. She touched his
chest swiftly and lightly, and afterwards jerked both hands behind
her, as if startled by that impulsive act.</p>

<p>"Clay," she said, "the Burnt Ranch stage came through here an
hour ago. I know what has happened."</p>

<p>"You're up early. And you look fresh enough to kiss."</p>

<p>She spoke, half in anger and half in appeal. "Don't say that to
me. Not like that. Not so&mdash;not so easy and so casual. Like a
whisky drummer chucking a waitress under the chin."</p>

<p>He was weary to the bone and his nerves had him edgy.</p>

<p>He had never spoken a sharp word to her but he came close to it
now. He held it back until his voice was severe. "I made a pretty
general statement, not poorly meant. You don't need to fly at me
for it. I've observed you carry a chip on your shoulder toward most
men. If you think it necessary to do that to me I won't trouble you
again."</p>

<p>Her breath fell out of her in a small gasp. Completely puzzled,
he saw her eyes show tears. She said: "Clay&mdash;I didn't mean it
that way! Do you have to be brutal?"</p>

<p>"It has been difficult for me to know what you do mean, most
anytime. You never let a man see inside. There is such a thing as
being too proud, Ann, and there's no use despisin' the world
because you don't like the way it is made. You could have this town
eatin' out of your hand, if you wanted."</p>

<p>She said: "I don't want this town, or anybody in it."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean," he told her quietly. "I guess it is
because you've got to have things too perfect&mdash;and what you
see around here isn't like that."</p>

<p>She bowed her head, shutting away his sight of her face.</p>

<p>Her shoulders were small and pulled together. "Is that what you
have thought all this time, then? That I won't smile at things I
hate? That I won't praise things that are cheap and second-rate? Is
that the reason?"</p>

<p>He was still puzzled. "Reason for what?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. I know what is inside me, Clay. If I don't show
those things to everybody in town, as I'd show goods on a counter,
it is because I can't." She looked at him with a strange, dark
intensity; she seemed to be waiting for him to understand. "Good
things and real things don't come often, Clay. They are worth
waiting for, I think. And if they never come, how could anybody be
content with only half of what they dreamed?"</p>

<p>He said in a kinder voice: "I guess it is a question of what you
want."</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, "that's it. To have something you
want&mdash;all of it&mdash;or nothing." She didn't meet his eyes at
the moment. She turned away, her hands running the edges of the
store's counter. She said: "Clay&mdash;don't go on as you are.
Don't fight Herendeen. You will lose everything."</p>

<p>He said, with a dry amusement: "Maybe it is as you say, Ann,
with me, too. I want something, nothing else will do."</p>

<p>She came around quickly, her voice anxiously sharp. "What do you
want, Clay?"</p>

<p>But he shook his head, more and more amused by his own
uncertainty, "I don't know, Ann. I don't know." He smiled at her,
saying in a rare, teasing tone: "What were we arguing about? That
you were pretty enough to kiss. Someday a man will&mdash;and maybe
you'll forget to push him back."</p>

<p>She was in the corner of the room now, her face shaded and her
voice tonelessly low. "Maybe," she answered.</p>

<p>He left the store, reached his horse and rode from War Pass.
This time, instead of taking the desert route, he kept on with the
Burnt Ranch road, passing into the pines and curving along the
narrow-walled canyon whose creek boiled shallow and noisy beside
him. Day brightened overhead but the heat was no longer in the sun
and all things lay still and clear and fresh before him. At the
head of Herendeen's valley, four miles from town, he swung into the
Dell Lake trail and quartered up the slope of Mogul, intending thus
to cut his range on the west side. Beyond the lake, he veered aside
to have a look at the campfire made by Hillhouse the night before
and noticed that it had been carefully put out. Hillhouse had not
left it burning. Satisfied, he entered the pines, constantly
climbing. At the first bench he let the horse breathe, by Stark's
line cabin, and pushed on. Rounding the bend of the trail, a few
minutes later, he saw Catherine Grant dismounted in the trail,
waiting.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. THE INEVITABLE PAST</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Morgan dismounted before Catherine her eyes
showed him something that warmed him through and through: it was a
swift personal interest, a little saddened by what she saw, as
though his injuries hurt her heart. "Bones McGeen came by the ranch
late last night and told us what happened." She watched him quite
closely, one strong line of worry across her forehead. "I was
afraid you were badly hurt. I hope you paid him back. I hope you
smashed the lights out of him!"</p>

<p>He managed a grin. "He'll take no beauty prizes for a
spell."</p>

<p>"If I'd been there I would have shot him, Clay. I swear I
would." Then her smooth, strong face lighted and she answered his
smile. "You're a tough brute. It's good to know."</p>

<p>They had this power to be pleased with each other, to cover up
seriousness with a light, touch-and-go humor. Always when they met,
something got into the day that had not been there before;
something changed them both, lifting them from the slow and
customary channel of their thoughts and their habits. He said, "Sit
down," and settled himself at the base of a tree. She dropped near
him, in front of him, her legs half-folded beneath her symmetrical
upper body, her hands gently touching the earth. He liked to watch
her hands; they were long and square, with fingers that had grace
in the way they gently turned. For a while he forgot the throb of
his knuckles and the swollen stiffness of his cheeks; he was aware
of her presence and its effect on him. The day was better and some
of the trouble went out of his head.</p>

<p>He said: "Glad I crossed your trail. What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"I was coming your way. I wanted to see how you were."</p>

<p>"Did you tell Gurd you were coming?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>She lowered her head and drew patterns on the soft forest soil
with her finger-point. Her hair glowed darkly in the morning's
light, it deepened the color of her cheeks. "I don't know," she
said in a reserved voice. She wouldn't look at him during these
moments. "It is Herendeen's influence, I suppose." But her voice
held no certainty, for she knew the answer and it was hard not to
be honest with him. As long as she could remember, clear back to
the beginning, she had never lied to him, never had failed to be
candid. Yet, if it was difficult to evade his answer now, it was
still more difficult to tell him the truth.</p>

<p>He said: "If a man is old enough to make up his own mind, he's
old enough to know what he wants to do. I have no business trying
to interfere. I won't talk to him but I have done nothing to hurt
him."</p>

<p>She lifted the soft earth in her hand and let it slide between
her fingers. Her face was sweetly sober. Her long and fresh-
colored lips expressively changed shape when she, looked at him.
"No explanations, no apologies. That is the way you've always
been."</p>

<p>"What else can anybody do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I guess. Only it makes it hard for people to
understand you sometimes. To know what is in your head."</p>

<p>"You never had trouble figuring me out," he reflected.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I have a special gift that way. I know you through and
through," They were silently laughing at each other, influenced by
an undercurrent which always buoyed them up when together. She
turned, lying back on the ground, her body full- shaped against the
folds of her riding habit. She was a long, round-contoured girl and
even in this relaxed attitude there was a rhythm, a vitality about
her. It affected him powerfully; it fanned up the close-held
hungers that had been in him so many years. They were alike in many
things, in the way of silence, in the heavy beat of feeling below
this silence.</p>

<p>She pillowed her head with her hands and watched the bright blue
patch of sky showing through the pine tops, speaking in a distant,
dreaming voice: "Nothing ever changes, Clay. The earth, the wind or
the sun. Or the things I want, or you want."</p>

<p>He remembered what Ann McGarrah had so swiftly asked him: What
had he wanted? Now, not knowing what it was, he asked Catherine:
"What do I want?"</p>

<p>She said in a faraway tone: "I wish I knew."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>She turned her head, so close to him now that he saw the gray
flakes of color in her eyes. The dance of laughter was in them, and
an inexpressible gravity was in them, both humors blended. It was
the way she hid herself from him when she chose. "Never ask a
woman's age, never ask what she wants."</p>

<p>He said indolently: "I wish I had a steak, with onions. Maybe
German fried potatoes and a piece of apple pie. Now that's what I
want."</p>

<p>She said: "Do you remember the night we rode to Freeport in the
rain and ate Kern Case's flapjacks and coffee, and played rummy
until he got scandalized at our conduct and sent us away? It was
awfully dark in the Potholes."</p>

<p>"What ever happened to that brown dress?"</p>

<p>She said in a wondering tone, "You still remember it?" Then she
added quite gently: "Somewhere in the attic, Clay. It is up there
with all the other things I outgrew and put away to
forget&mdash;and never quite forgot. Would you want to go back to
those times, Clay?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I guess not."</p>

<p>She said: "There's something else I came up here to tell you.
Herendeen has sent over the mountain for the Ryder boys. They're
gunmen, Clay."</p>

<p>He said, "Time to go," and held out his hand. His fingers were
warm and strong, they had a pressure as she pulled herself half-
upright and for a moment, her shoulder softly touching his chest,
she watched the dust dancing in a shaft of slanting sunlight, her
eyes half-closed. "No," she murmured, "I guess I wouldn't
either."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Go back to old times. We'd do the same things, and make the
same mistakes. Nothing changes."</p>

<p>She turned her head to him, her lips pressed in soft humor. But
the expression on Morgan's face sent the smile away and for this
short heady interval of time they were remembering the same things,
hard-touched by them, dangerously stirred by them. That old
closeness came back, that old reckless, sweet wildness came back
and shook them; and for a moment he was shocked alive by the things
her nearness did to him. The past rushed up and he saw her as he
had once seen her&mdash;a girl holding him away with a gay
insolence even as her eyes pulled him on. He saw now the faint
freckles at the base of her nose and the curve of her eyebrows and
the close texture of her skin, gently browned by the sun&mdash;and
the reflection of himself in her pupils.</p>

<p>She rose and stepped away from him and did something then that
told him of her thoughts, she lifted her chin, her face tightening
against a flare of excitement, and pulled her hands behind her back
as she had done in those old days when she was afraid of what was
to come. "My boy," she said, breathlessness in her throat, "it is
time to go."</p>

<p>"Back home?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I'm riding with you. There's something on
Long Seven I want to find out. You don't mind, Clay?"</p>

<p>He had his awkward moment in mounting with his bad hand. They
traveled single-file up the trail to Mogul's plateau, and afterward
rode abreast across the dun-yellow surface of the high meadows,
beneath a half-warm sun. High on the tawny ribs of the Mogul ridge
cattle grazed; a puff of dust rose from the bounding flight of an
antelope, Catherine said: "It is a beautiful world, Clay."</p>

<p>He didn't answer, for this scene had brought forward a piece of
his life he had relived many times. They had been young and
headstrong and wild and completely absorbed in each other; yet in
the space of a night he had married Lila and changed the course of
his life. He could not look back now, from the distance of ten
years, and unravel the puzzle of the youngster he had been, or
recapture the strange complexity of his thoughts then, or the
wind-wild swaying of his feelings. He could not place his finger
upon the reasons for that sudden act; somehow it was rooted in a
quarrel with Catherine, or in the dark and mysterious and exciting
shadows of the night, or in the eyes and lips of Lila as she had
looked up to him. It was a spark, suddenly struck, taking
unexplainable fire.</p>

<p>There was no answer to the things a man did. That night he had
left his first youth, with its careless and thoughtless love of
life, behind; and he had left Catherine Grant behind; whatever his
feelings for her had been, he had thrown them away. Since that time
they had never spoken of it, nor had he ever seen in her eyes an
emotion to tell him how she had felt.</p>

<p>This was the past that bound him, with its perpetual regret for
having failed. It had been a mistake, as Lila had soon told him;
yet though it was a mistake, he never ceased to think of how, by
some greater effort or some clearer insight into the heart of that
girl whose temper was so swift to change from height to depth, he
might have made her feel differently. His failure bound him fast;
her memory bound him fast. Even in the worst moments of his
recurring loneliness and restlessness, the old reproach of her eyes
came to him to make him feel that his was the fault, for which he
could make no payment except through faithfulness. It was an
endless obligation.</p>

<p>Catherine said: "Clay, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>He broke clear of his thinking to see a worry on her face that
had not been there before. She looked far ahead into the long
yellow flush of the meadow floors, her mind troubled and
distant.</p>

<p>"Of what, Catherine?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, only repeating, "I'm afraid," Turning the
foot of the Mogul Mountains, they came upon the Long Seven yard.
Janet was waiting in the doorway, her hands primly folded in front
of her dress. Harry Jump and Cap Vermilye were near the corral
talking to the nester from Salt Meadow, Fox Willing.</p>

<p>These three moved toward Morgan but he ignored them for this
moment, caught by the scene of Catherine facing his daughter.
Catherine walked forward, tall and pleasant in the sunlight, not
smiling but near to a smile. Janet's small hands remained locked
across her dress. Her face held its precise gravity, its unmoved
reserve; her eyes were quite cool yet Morgan, who knew his daughter
thoroughly&mdash;the shaded meaning in her various degrees of
silence and politeness&mdash;recognized an odd restraint in his
daughter at the moment. It was a mirrored resentment, the cause of
which he understood at once. Somewhere along the last year or two
his daughter had absorbed the viewpoint of Ann McGarrah. Somehow
Ann McGarrah had mysteriously instilled in Janet her own dislike of
Catherine. These were the ways by which women sent their feelings
intuitively across space to other women. Janet was Ann's partisan
and her small clear face, so exactly neutral, could not quite hide
her jealousy. He stood by, quietly angered at Ann McGarrah for what
she had done to Janet, knowing he had no way of changing Janet's
expression; She was no longer a child to listen implicitly to him.
In her own mind, in that shadowland between childhood and wisdom,
were beliefs she held by her own judgment.</p>

<p>All his life Clay Morgan had believed in self-decision. As he
made his own judgments, as he had lived by them and taken the
rewards or the penalties they had brought him, asking no help and
caring little for outside advice, so he gave to others the same
right. Every human being had to stand on his own feet and reach
wisdom by his own errors and tears. Remembering this, he stood
back.</p>

<p>Catherine was at the porch. She said: "I haven't seen you for a
very long while, Janet."</p>

<p>Janet's voice was slow and cool. "Thank you. Would you like a
cup of coffee?"</p>

<p>"No," said Catherine, and settled on the steps of the porch. She
looked at her hands a moment, drawing a deep breath; she was sober
and restrained. "No, but thanks. That's a pretty dress. I had one
once, almost the same color. I wore it to a lot of dances."</p>

<p>"Were you my age then?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"I was older. But at your age I used to dance by myself when
nobody was watching."</p>

<p>"I do, too," said Janet. "How long did you have to wait before
you could go to dances?" She spoke it and then, remembering her
father's presence too late, threw him an embarrassed look.</p>

<p>Catherine noticed it. She said immediately: "It will seem long,
as it did to me, but it really will be so short a time!"</p>

<p>Fox Willing moved around to face Morgan. He said, "Mr. Morgan, I
rode over to tell you something..."</p>

<p>Morgan watched Janet come over the porch to Catherine. She
paused there, the polite disinterest gone from her small face. She
moved her hands across her dress and suddenly sat in front of
Catherine. "Tell me about the time you went to your first
dance."</p>

<p>"It was with your father," said Catherine. "I was sixteen."</p>

<p>Morgan turned his back to them, astonished at the relief he
felt. Willing said:</p>

<p>"I was down at the south edge of Government Valley last night.
Coming up from a gulley I saw a man bunchin' some of your beef. I
got down and watched. It was a pretty bright night but this fellow
was a mile away and I wasn't sure. Might have been one of your
crew. So I waited till I saw him drive the beef over the ridge,
headin' south. I figured to take a shot then, only it looked like
he had some friends farther down toward the Potholes, so I didn't
risk it." He seemed to be troubled about that, and quietly
explained. "I've got a wife, you see."</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Thanks, Fox."</p>

<p>"Well," said Willing, "you gave us a break."</p>

<p>Harry Jump said: "We're wastin' time."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Morgan, "we'll have a look."</p>

<p>Morgan got back on his horse. He interrupted Catherine's talk.
"Janet, we'll be gone awhile. But Mose and Pancho will be
here."</p>

<p>Janet said, "All right." She turned her eyes back to Catherine,
whose face, for the moment, swung to Morgan, all soft and stirred.
Something came across that space from her to him; he wasn't sure
what it meant, but there it was, strong and warm. She said: "I'll
stay here a while, Clay."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Harry Jump said some impatient word under his breath, moving
away with Fox Willing and Cap Vermilye. Morgan followed, and thus
these four headed down the flats in the warm-brisk air of middle
morning.</p>

<p>Breaking a lonely night's camp in the Cache Mountains, Parr
Gentry entered Freeport quite early that morning. Smoke eddied up
from the street, from still-hot piles of rubbish, from brush and
blackened pines adjoining the town, there wasn't anything left
except one log cabin at the head of the gulch. Parr Gentry
sympathetically clucked his tongue at Kern Case.</p>

<p>"Mighty shameful thing to happen. For a fact. Hard on you, too,
Kern. If there's anything I can do for you, just drop the word.
Meanwhile, I been lookin' for a band of horses up this away. Seen
anything of 'em?"</p>

<p>Taciturn from a sleepless night, Case said he hadn't, and walked
away from Gentry. Gentry took the Burnt Ranch road out of Freeport,
riding the up-and-down grades with his soft body loosely shaking,
his toes pointed outward and his moon-face tipped. His whole shape
was idle and seemed without energy but his eyes showed a lively
interest in the tracks on the road and presently, entirely governed
by what he saw, he entered the Potholes.</p>

<p>He talked to his horse, he broke into tuneless pieces of song
and now and then tried his luck at whistling. A dozen trails led
from the main one. At each intersection Parr Gentry paused to read
sign and always took the fresher tracks onward, so reaching deeper
into the tangled maze of pines and gullies and brush- thickets. At
intervals he passed the blackened mark of old fires; once got down
from his horse to smell the dead coals of such a fire. Three or
four miles into the Potholes, crossing a shallow creek, he saw a
rider slide through the yonder trees, making little sound. Parr
Gentry permitted his horse to drink. He dropped his head and his
shoulders sagged down and he whistled without much attempt at
melody&mdash;a thorough picture of disinterest, though his ears
caught every soft footfall of the other man's retreating horse.
Later, Parr Gentry found another trail and left the Potholes by a
circling detour, reaching Herendeen's valley. The ranch quarters
were a mile or more behind him and for a little while he paused
indecisively in the road. While he seemed to debate a course in his
head, his quick- rummaging glance saw a file of riders come down
the slope of Mogul, through the scattered pines. This apparently
determined his direction, for he turned northward on the road,
heading for War Pass and eventually, twenty minutes later, was
abreast the party as it reached the valley. From a distance he
recognized Charley Hillhouse. By arranging the gait of his horse he
met Hillhouse as the latter brought his men toward the river,
apparently bound into the Cache Mountains.</p>

<p>There were four in the party, Hillhouse, two other Herendeen
riders, and Gurd Grant. Parr Gentry's presence stopped the group.
He removed his hat to dash the sweat from his egg-like forehead and
said: "Warm for a man of my bulk, ain't seen any horses, have you?"
His glance touched them all, bland and meaningless, yet shrewd
enough.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen a thing," said Hillhouse. "You seen anything?"</p>

<p>Parr Gentry murmured affably, "Just a couple of jackrabbits.
What would old Parr Gentry, who's gettin' blinder every day, be
seein' that you young fellers couldn't see? It is a compliment,
Charley, fer you to figure I could make out anything at all. Yes
sir, a compliment."</p>

<p>All this was spoken in a windy, wandering way. Gurd Grant said,
somewhat restlessly, "Well, we're wasting time," and started on
with the two extra riders. Hillhouse, studying Parr Gentry, delayed
following the others until he had shaped up a cigarette. The rest
of the party was fifty yards ahead of him and he had a lighted
match against his cigarette when he spoke.</p>

<p>"What's up, Parr?"</p>

<p>"Wastin' your time around here, Charley," said Gentry. "He's in
the Potholes by the little meadow on Frog Creek."</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse said, "Thanks." He rubbed the match between
his fingers, and dropped it. His glance followed that match
downward; solemn and narrow-eyed, he stared at the ground.
"Thanks," he said again, and cantered after the others.</p>

<p>From a viewpoint high on the side of the Cache Mountains, Vance
Ketchell watched the land below with the eyes of a man whose own
fortune was pretty much in balance; and this was how he happened to
see Parr Gentry come along the Freeport road, disappear into the
Potholes, and later emerge from them. At this elevation he had a
complete sweep of the valley below, a sight of the south-running
road halfway to Freeport, and a bird's-eye view of the small
meadows in the Potholes.</p>

<p>All movement in so wide and lonely a stretch of country at once
caught his glance, and though he did not immediately identify Parr
Gentry he followed the man's erratic course. There were other
riders abroad this morning, creeping slowly in and out of sight on
the various trails looping below. He noticed Hillhouse's party come
around Dell Lake, and was pretty certain of their purpose from the
way they scouted the land as they moved. The Burnt Creek stage
passed below his viewpoint and cut over the hills toward the
Fanolango Desert. Somewhere in this vast land a gun's report rolled
faintly out. Somebody seemed to be breaking horses in the corral
behind Herendeen's big house, with a lot of dust smoking up there.
A rider, a woman on sidesaddle, came out of the Crowfoot country,
traveling toward Dell Lake. This, he guessed, was Catherine Grant,
and it amused him to notice how narrowly she missed riding into
Hillhouse. All these shapes, made small and slow by the distance,
seemed to weave a pattern around each other. Catherine Grant
disappeared near Dell Lake; long later he saw her appear on the
side of Mogul, now with a man.</p>

<p>This was when Parr Gentry came along the road below, near enough
to be identified by the formless shape he made on his horse. More
and more interested, Vance Ketchell saw Gentry meet the Hillhouse
group and stop for a word; there was that last delayed conference
between Hillhouse and Gentry, after which Hillhouse rejoined his
party. This was what focused Vance Ketchell's attention. Hillhouse
abruptly led his men away from the river and crossed the valley.
Climbing the ridge, these men struck the Potholes not far from the
place Gentry had left them and disappeared.</p>

<p>Catherine Grant and the man with her had reached the top of the
Mogul rim. There was nothing much left to see, and no particular
activity around Herendeen's, whereupon Vance Ketchell got on his
horse, took the upward trail into timber and reached his own small
ranch less than an hour later. The moment he came into his meadow
he discovered visitors. Herendeen and Bones McGeen were dismounted
by his door.</p>

<p>McGeen said irritably: "Where the hell you been?"</p>

<p>Trouble had crept behind Vance Ketchell. He saw it on the faces
of both these men and heard it in the domineering voice of McGeen.
Vance Ketchell had his shadowed moment of dismal certainty. Before
another word had been spoken he knew he had lost his ranch. Riding
before these two, he stepped from the saddle, a distinct chill
threading his nerves. At that moment he knew what physical fear
was. It came to him and held him still&mdash;and then because he
knew he had already lost, he ceased to be afraid.</p>

<p>He said: "None of your business, Bones."</p>

<p>"No?" said McGeen, rising from the doorstep.</p>

<p>Herendeen shook his head, whereupon McGeen walked to his horse.
He propped his shoulder against the pony's side; he had a sudden
grin on his face, the drawn, squinted, toothy grin of a man angrily
amused. Herendeen, meanwhile, held his bright stare on Ketchell,
showing Ketchell the fresh scars on his face, the stitched section
of his lip. Now he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Morgan was up here last night, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Ketchell. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"You're through around here," said Herendeen.</p>

<p>Facing Herendeen, Vance Ketchell suddenly remembered that Bones
McGeen was behind him and for a moment he thought he was a dead
man; something in Herendeen's voice had been like a sharp signal to
McGeen. And again, at this instant, Ketchell felt that frigid grip
of fear. He was a smart young man and knew better than to make any
sudden gestures, but he took a slow sidestep and a turn in order to
see both these two. They had him flanked and they were watching him
with the steadfast attention of men who had already disposed of
him. Bones McGeen didn't move. He had been grinning; he was sober
now, not thoroughly certain what Herendeen wanted. It was a little
gap in the tightening run of time, and Vance Ketchell took
advantage of it. He stepped on backward, using his voice to keep
them interested. "What's Morgan got to do with me? I never heard a
man had to have a pass from Three Pines to live in this
country."</p>

<p>"You're through," said Herendeen again.</p>

<p>Vance Ketchell had meanwhile backed off a good twenty feet and
now he saw them both before him clearly. They didn't have him
flanked any more.</p>

<p>"All right, boys," he told them, very calm about it, "just fly
right at it. I know damned well I can beat one of you to the
pull."</p>

<p>Bones McGeen drew away from the horse. He set his legs wide
apart in the dust. A crease ran across his forehead and he stood
with his chin lifted, staring at Herendeen as though something had
gone wrong. He called to Herendeen: "You want me to go ahead?"</p>

<p>Herendeen studied Vance Ketchell over the stretching moments; he
had the impulse in his mind&mdash;Ketchell saw that pretty clearly.
McGeen rasped out: "I never saw the time I was afraid to bust into
you, Vance. Say the word, Ben. Hell, he's only got two arms."</p>

<p>"Both good," said Ketchell pointedly.</p>

<p>Herendeen shook his head. "Shut up, Bones. Listen, Vance. You be
out of here by morning."</p>

<p>Vance didn't answer. He watched Herendeen limp over to his horse
and step up, making a second try before he hit the saddle. Bones
McGeen didn't want to leave it like this; he was reckless and sure
of himself and hated to see Herendeen back down: He called to
Vance. "If it was me, I'd see that hole card, sonny. And God damn
you, I'll see it yet, if you stick around."</p>

<p>Ketchell laughed at McGeen. "A couple of tinhorn
pikers&mdash;that fits both of you jaspers. Come on&mdash;come on.
I'm right here. Just have a try. McGeen, you're a yellow- bellied
jackass workin' for a man with putty guts." He let that sink in,
quietly turning wild. He wasn't laughing any more. He settled his
boots in the dust of the yard and spoke again, naming off with
biting precision the things he thought they were; it went like
this, the list lengthening out until he could think of nothing else
suitable. He lifted his right hand, knocking back the brim of his
hat. Black hair fell across his forehead and sunlight glittered on
the quick film of sweat creeping through his skin. He said as a
parting shot, "You're pretty tough on old men and women and babies.
If I'm in hell when you boys come along, you can bet your last
dollar I'll put the blackball on both of you."</p>

<p>"Herendeen," said McGeen, in a begging voice, "just ride along
for a minute."</p>

<p>Herendeen took his tongue-lashing with a smart, unmoved
coolness. He spoke to Ketchell. "Be out of here by daylight," and
turned his horse away, calling up the reluctant McGeen. "Come here,
you damned fool." The two crossed the meadow, McGeen staring behind
him with a dry, thin look of regret. Ketchell moved along the wall
of his shanty to keep them in view. When they passed into timber he
stepped back to shield his body, only his head showing. He saw
McGeen wheel and lift his gun; a bullet ripped the corner of the
cabin, three feet above Ketchell's head, and another shot dropped
Ketchell's horse. Ketchell had to step away from the cabin to clear
his own gun for an answer. He threw a pair of bullets at McGeen and
watched the latter fade back, compelled by Herendeen's yelling
authority.</p>

<p>Ketchell squatted by the shelter of the wall, listening to their
horses fade on the trail. He stared at his own pony, dead in the
sunshine, and softly spoke to himself, "Kind of close, Vance, kind
of close." His arms shook a little bit.</p>

<p>As soon as Charley Hillhouse entered the Potholes he halted the
party to explain what was in his mind.</p>

<p>"Now we'll take up this trail quietly, for echoes run a long way
through this timber and Hack has got mighty sharp ears. There's a
couple places I used to camp with him and it is likely he'll be at
one of them, if he's here at all. If any of you boys see him before
I do, draw right down on him. Do not fire. Just draw down. I want
to talk to him."</p>

<p>Gurd Grant threw Charley a very odd glance. "You two were pretty
close friends once."</p>

<p>"Close as they come, I guess," assented Charley.</p>

<p>Gurd said, "I don't get it at all."</p>

<p>Hillhouse shrugged his shoulders. Gravity pulled his face
together; his expression was matter-of-fact, seeming to hold away
imagination, and his coolness was something that never left him. As
they went on single file, Gurd Grant thought about his own part in
this affair with a growing unease. He had joined Hillhouse much in
the cheerful spirit a man goes out on a hunting party; now, for the
first time on this trip, he began to understand what they were
hunting&mdash;and what might come when they found Hack. It gave him
a distinct chill when he reasoned it out this way. It put a
different light on the affair.</p>

<p>"Charley," he said, "I don't want any rough stuff."</p>

<p>Charley rode in front of him, not turning and not answering.
Gurd Grant got the impression of a will in Hillhouse as hard as
rock. More and more disturbed, he had his fervent wish that he were
out of the whole thing. By disposition a sunny and agreeable man,
he had never in his life lifted a gun at anybody; and though he had
joined this group because of anger toward Morgan&mdash;an anger he
still nursed&mdash;he could not, now that he thought of it
seriously, see himself in the role of Hack Breathitt's captor.
Squirming around in the saddle, he was on the edge of dropping out
of the party, when Charley's voice drifted dryly back at him.</p>

<p>"You don't have to go on, Mr. Grant."</p>

<p>The tone of it affronted Gurd's pride. He said stiffly: "Just do
your own thinking, Charley, and I'll do mine." An instant later he
wished he hadn't said it. Gloomy and extremely troubled, he fell
silent.</p>

<p>The Potholes was a section of land perhaps ten miles square,
composed of gulches and ridges shapelessly twisted, as though in
olden time an upthrust of the earth's lower levels had lifted and
dropped this crust. The trails here, made by wild cattle and
antelope and men secretly riding their own ways, circled
depressions, sank into ravines, followed these ravines, and went
slantwise up stiff grades, to fall again into other pockets. Over
everything was the shade created by a dense stand of jack pine
whose dry needles fell in a dry shower when they brushed the
half-dead branches.</p>

<p>Grant didn't know the region well enough to orient himself, but
Charley Hillhouse was thoroughly at home, selecting the trails
without pause as he came to them. Crossing a creek that rose in the
Potholes and died in them, they reached a meadow and carefully
skirted its edge. Beyond this meadow the land again broke up.
Charley Hillhouse lifted a hand over his head, signaling caution; a
mile forward, coming to the lip of a deep glen, he waved his arm by
way of command. Grant stopped, watching Hillhouse step from his
horse and go forward, drop into the glen and climb the far side of
it on his hands and knees. He had drawn his gun; near the top of
the opposite ridge he flattened a moment, removed his hat, and
thrust his head forward. In a moment he beckoned them to come
up.</p>

<p>Grant dismounted and led the other men down the trail to the
bottom of the glen. He climbed the far side slowly, abreast
Hillhouse, Hillhouse pointed ahead.</p>

<p>Yonder, in a cup-shaped-depression as large as a small corral,
stood Hack Breathitt's horse. There was a dead fire in the middle
of the depression, and Hack's saddle gear. Hack lay beside a log,
sound asleep, with his hat pulled over his head. From this distance
Gurd Grant heard Breathitt's even, healthy snore.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. HACK BREATHITT</h2>

<p class="first">GRANT dropped at the right of Hillhouse, the two
other riders crawled to the foreman's left and thus the four of
them watched the loose-sprawled shape of Hack Breathitt. In this
still moment Gurd Grant became fully aware of what he had committed
himself to do and had his moment of bitter regret. Dreading what
was next to happen he looked to Hillhouse.</p>

<p>The Three Pines foreman had let his gun and arm drop along the
ground and on his face lay shadows darker than the dull light of
the Potholes. Yet on that face was no particular sadness and no
visible eagerness. All Gurd Grant saw was a gray, steadfast
certainty. Then Hillhouse lifted the gun, sighted it on Breathitt
and spoke quietly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's a hell of a time to be poundin' your ear, Hack. Wake
up."</p>

<p>Soft as the call was, Hack Breathitt's awakening was instant.
All in a motion he flung his blanket aside, sprang upright and
wheeled around, reaching for his gun. Hillhouse's flat warning
stopped Breathitt's draw.</p>

<p>"Cut that out. You're covered four ways."</p>

<p>This was a wrong guess on Charley Hillhouse's part, for only
three of them had drawn on Breathitt. Gurd Grant, rising as the
others rose, held his arms beside him, refusing to turn a gun on
Breathitt and fervently wishing he were out of the whole business.
Breathitt's black hair dropped down his forehead, a flash of
wildness raced across his lank, whiskered cheeks and went away. He
stared back with a narrow, gray-eyed interest. The mark of the wild
bunch was on him, Gurd Grant thought. The chase had made him hard
and thin-mouthed; it had put a look on him difficult to explain.
Hack said calmly:</p>

<p>"You're a mighty stubborn brute when you start after something,
Charley. I ought to've remembered that."</p>

<p>"I told you in War Pass, some time ago, I wasn't your friend if
you touched Three Pines."</p>

<p>"Sure," murmured Breathitt. "Sure."</p>

<p>Hillhouse said to one of his riders, "Go get his gun, Riley. And
saddle his horse."</p>

<p>Riley walked into the depression, circling Hack so that he would
not be in the line of fire. He crept behind Breathitt, closely
eyeing Breathitt's arms; he seized Breathitt's gun at one rapid
reach and threw it toward Hillhouse, relief coming to his long
face. He lifted the saddle blanket, folded it across Breathitt's
horse, and tossed on the saddle.</p>

<p>Breathitt's horse grunted when Riley heaved up the latigo strap.
A crow's strident squawking echoed through the timber. Shade
pressed around them and even though the day was half-warm, Gurd
Grant felt a growing chill in his stomach, along his nerves. He
could not help asking his question.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Charley?"</p>

<p>Hillhouse ignored the question, whereupon Breathitt's grin
showed very white against his steel-black stubble. "He's prayin'
for an answer, Gurd. You don't know Charley like I do."</p>

<p>"No," said Hillhouse softly, "I got the answer."</p>

<p>Breathitt reached into his shirt pocket, producing cigarette
material. He rolled a smoke, still showing that thin-lipped
amusement. He lighted the cigarette and dragged in a deep breath of
smoke. "You won't get far with a jury, son. You know that."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hillhouse, "I know it. Riley, bring me his
rope."</p>

<p>Riley released the rope from the thong of Breathitt's saddle. He
came across the depression at a slow, bowlegged straddle and handed
the rope to Hillhouse. Hillhouse hooked it over one arm, keeping
his gun free; he looked upward at the trees a moment, then back to
Breathitt. "Better get on your horse, Hack."</p>

<p>Gurd Grant saw it then. He stepped around in front of Hillhouse,
shoving the gun aside. "No, by God, you don't work that while I'm
in this outfit. If you want to take him into War Pass, fine. But
nothing else."</p>

<p>Hillhouse's eyes showed Gurd a hot flash of intolerance. He
moved in, butted the point of his shoulder into Grant, sending the
latter violently backward. He said, "Keep still. If you've got no
guts you ought to've stayed home."</p>

<p>Grant cried: "Try anything and I'll throw down on you,
Charley!"</p>

<p>Hillhouse spoke to Riley: "If he moves, bat him. Better get on
the horse, Hack."</p>

<p>"No," said Hack, "I guess not."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Hillhouse in a jumpy, hard-pressed tone, "make it
easy for a man. What you think I'm thinkin' about now, Hack? What
you suppose I feel?"</p>

<p>It was entirely between these two. They faced each other,
dismally sober, two tough men who knew each other thoroughly.
Breathitt took his deep pulls on the cigarette, drawing the smoke
into his lungs with a heavy-breathing relish. His cheeks showed
pallor in this shade, his features were thinner, and the look in
his eyes had the round, terrible depth of a gun's muzzle.</p>

<p>"Charley," he said, "there's a streak of Injun in you."</p>

<p>Hillhouse's answer held intensity, a dogged conviction. Yet it
seemed to Grant that Hillhouse was anxiously trying to make Hack
understand.</p>

<p>"I told you in War Pass how it had to be with me. I can't
straddle the fence. God hates a man like that. Look at Ollie Jacks.
Whut's difference between you and Ollie? I'd hang any crook to a
tree if I caught him. Whut other way can I handle you? If I see my
chore, how can I turn back on it, even for a man I know well?
You're a crook, Hack. That's what you turned out to be. And you
wound up killin' a man. One of my men. I said I'd stick by Three
Pines long as I worked for it&mdash;and I will. You see that, Hack?
I got no option in the matter." His voice begged Hack Breathitt for
an answer. "You see that?"</p>

<p>Breathitt showed his old partner an iron insolence, a black
cutting wisdom. There was something in that look which none of
them, long as they lived, could ever answer, or ever forget. Hack
said: "There's a knot in your head and nothin' can change it. But
put this in your book, kid. You've got a damned good memory,
too&mdash;and this is something you won't shake loose. It'll go to
bed with you and it'll kill your sleep and it'll make your grub
taste like sawdust and all the drinkin' in the world won't drown
it. Take a good long look at your peace of mind, Charley. It's the
last you'll see of it."</p>

<p>"Get on the horse," said Hillhouse.</p>

<p>Hack smoked his cigarette to the bitter end, tossed it into the
dust. "Before the week's out you'll wish to God you were in my
place. Never mind the horse, Charley."</p>

<p>Hillhouse pulled his feet together and dropped the rope. His
chin came up and the gun slowly rose in his hand. He fired three
times, shoving the gun toward his target as though he could not get
it done quickly enough. Shocked windless, Gurd Grant saw the
foreman's lips pull back at each shot, saw his face snap into
grotesque and open-mouthed expressions of craziness such as he had
never seen on any man's face before. The shot echoes pounded along
the corridors of the pine forest. Hack bowed his head and bent his
knees as if to kneel. Half-kneeling, he fell forward.</p>

<p>Hillhouse walked toward him, the gun sagging at full arm's
length. He removed his hat and stood this way; staring down at the
dead Breathitt. He said: "Well, he had the last word, like always."
And then his lips framed silent words. The vitality left his face.
When he looked around to the others he seemed faintly dazed. He
said: "We'll take him back to the ranch and get a wagon and run him
into War Pass. His family are all buried in the cemetery, which is
where he should be. These Potholes ain't fit for any white man."
Afterwards, he added in an aimless way: "I wish he'd seen the way I
looked at it. I wish he had."</p>

<p>Gurd Grant swung around, physically sick, and slid down the
ravine. He had to stop here long enough to lose his breakfast and
catch his wind. Climbing out of the ravine, he reached his horse
and turned it back on the trail. This was pretty much a wilderness
to him but he was so absorbed by what he had seen that he let the
horse have its own head, and so eventually he came out of the
Potholes on Herendeen's range. Turning right, he threaded through
the Haycreek Hills and reached his own place. He left the horse in
front of the house. Going up the stairs he heard Catherine call
from the kitchen. She came to the hall and saw his dead-white face
swing around.</p>

<p>"Gurd&mdash;what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said. "Nothing."</p>

<p>"You're lying."</p>

<p>"Let me alone," he rasped out and went up the stairs. He locked
the door of his room, slowly pacing back and forth from corner to
corner. Catherine knocked on the door and called to him. He didn't
answer.</p>

<p>Lige White, who loved hunting as he loved few things, returned
to his ranch that day and turned a fat mule deer over to the cook.
He had been gone from the house since two that morning, riding down
some of the constant physical restlessness which seldom permitted
him to remain long in one spot. He ate a late dinner in the kitchen
and afterwards sat on the front porch to smoke a cigar, meanwhile
listening to the soft step of his wife as she moved around the
second floor of the house, engaged in those endless little
occupations which seemed to fill her day.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant spot; this Running W ranch
headquarters&mdash;a green oasis enclosed by a white picket fence.
Poplars, sixty feet tall, shaded the house on all four sides and a
creek, neatly confined by the rock walls, made an oxbow bend from
front yard to rear, to irrigate the ranch gardens and the peach
orchard. Adjoining this square sat the corrals and sheds and barns
in their own orderly arrangement; atop the barn was a wrought-iron
weathervane bearing the ranch's name&mdash;Running W. All this made
a neat little island in the surrounding flats of Fanolango Desert,
whose brown surface now shimmered under the late summer sun. Some
miles away the rearing bulk of Mogul showed obscurely behind fall's
haze.</p>

<p>Relaxed here with his cigar, Lige White had one of his rare
moments of complete ease. Outwardly a straightforward man with
extremely courteous manners and great personal charm, he had an
inner complexity few people fathomed. This ranch, clean and groomed
in a land where ramshackle conditions were customary, represented
the feeling he had for some kind of method and some kind of beauty
around him. He found deep satisfaction in watching its trimmed
outline cut a mark against the encroaching desert; he found peace
in its shade and in the sweet dry odors drifting with the
impalpable breeze. After his long hot rides abroad, after the sweat
and dust of the day, it was pure solace to sit here, deep- sunk in
the chair, and see the evidences of his own handiwork.</p>

<p>But if he enjoyed it, the enjoyment never lasted long.</p>

<p>Sooner or later his surroundings ceased to be enough and he was
left again with the tantalizing emptiness of his personal life.
There were strong appetites in Lige White, a deep strain of robust
emotion, a love of laughter and affections&mdash;and none of these
things were ever completely consummated. Hearing his wife move
around the house he reflected that it had been a good many years
since she had come to the porch to watch him ride in. Somehow,
early in their marriage, they had been repelled by basic
differences&mdash;his strong wants against her
fastidiousness&mdash;and so he lived in his world and she, aloof
and serene, lived in hers.</p>

<p>He pitched the cigar across the porch and entered the house. She
was on the second floor, moving around from room to room, but when
he went up the stairs he found her seated in her own bedroom with a
pile of darning on her lap. She had heard him come and this was her
way of throwing up a guard against him.</p>

<p>He stood half-across the room, blackhaired and smiling,
favorable enough in the eyes of most women, watching her face come
up from the pretense of work. Her voice, cool as it was, never
failed to stir him.</p>

<p>"Did you have good luck?"</p>

<p>"Nice fat one."</p>

<p>She said: "I'll have Chin smoke one of the quarters. You're
quite fond of jerky."</p>

<p>"Meat's meat," he said and, jingling the silver change in his
pocket, he idly circled the room. It was cool and orderly, as she
was; it had her personality in it, a kind of gentle formality. She
had dropped her eyes to the darning, bowing her head at him. Turned
still, he found a good deal of pleasure in watching this woman who
had been his wife for twenty years. She held her age. There wasn't
a touch of gray in her black-shining hair, there wasn't a mark on
her face. Something kept her young and something of
girlhood&mdash;faithful and unworldly&mdash;was still to be seen in
her eyes. It always affected him.</p>

<p>He said: "Old girl, you're a hell of a good-looking woman, do
you know?"</p>

<p>Her voice wouldn't let the silence remain. It hurried back to
him. "The peaches should be picked. I think I'll turn Joe loose on
them tomorrow. We'll can a lot of them, of course. But it would be
nice if you loaded up a wagon of them and went around to the
neighbors."</p>

<p>"What neighbors?" he said, shaking his head. "It is a poor word
to describe what they are now, to each other. Herendeen and Morgan
are ready to fight at the drop of a hat. Gurd's got it in for
Morgan over something&mdash;I don't know what. We are going to have
a fight and I hate to consider it."</p>

<p>She said: "You should know the reason for it, Lige."</p>

<p>"Why yes," he answered. "Herendeen wants to clean up the range
and Morgan is a little shy on comin' in."</p>

<p>She said: "No, Lige. In the beginning it was over a woman, Lila.
And now it is over another woman, Catherine."</p>

<p>He looked down at her, closely thinking it over.
"Lila&mdash;maybe yes. But Catherine. I doubt that. He's closer to
the McGarrah girl."</p>

<p>"There's one thing you don't know, Lige. Catherine was his first
girl. Even before Lila. She still is. I don't know if he realizes
that. I don't know if he understands why he is so bitter against
Herendeen, or why Herendeen hates him so. It is Catherine,
Lige."</p>

<p>He said: "You're damned pretty, sitting there."</p>

<p>She gathered up the darning and rose, turning to a corner of the
room. "I ought to go down and see what Chin's cooking for
dinner."</p>

<p>He came over the room. Hearing his quick steps she swung nround,
her face dark-set and stiff. Lige White showed her his quick smile,
he showed her the gay, excited and unruly expression she knew so
well. There was that insistence in him, that quick need. He put his
hand on her shoulder, compelling her to come toward him. He said,
voice giving him away, "Don't freeze me out, Grace."</p>

<p>She whirled back from him, retreating until she had reached a
wall. She put her shoulders to the wall and it was this picture
that hurt Lige White, the sight of his wife shrinking away,
actually in fear, with that darkness on her face and that adamant
pride in her eyes, as though she hated the things in his mind then.
It took all the drive out of him, it swung him around. At the door
he turned, once more covering up his feelings, speaking as though
none of this had happened. "I'm going over to see Herendeen, and
maybe Gurd. Probably be gone overnight."</p>

<p>She said: "Will you be going to town?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said coolly, "I probably will."</p>

<p>They watched each other, their eyes steadily matched, silently
exchanging something at this moment. She knew why he was going to
town, and he knew she knew it.</p>

<p>"Grace," he said, "you never get excited about anything and I
guess you can live without a lot of things other people need. I'm
not that way."</p>

<p>She remained by the wall until he had left the room, listening
to the crush of his feet on the stairs. Afterwards, posted at a
corner of the window so that he wouldn't see her, she watched him
ride out of the yard and settle the horse into a singlefooted
dancing across the Fanolango Desert. As long as he was in sight she
stood by the window. When the corrals and barns cut him from view
she dropped the darning material from her hands and crossed to the
bureau mirror. She placed her hands on the bureau top, watching the
way her face remained set and dark. She said, "Why is it always
like that?" and slowly turned from the room. Chin had left a broom
and pan in the hall; she bent to pick up the pan and saw the
uncollected dust along the floor. She went down to the kitchen and
filled a pail with water and got a rag from a closet and lugged the
pail up the stairs, kneeling on the hall.</p>

<p>She had forgotten about her dress, or she didn't care. She
drenched the rag&mdash;and slowly scrubbed the floor, not with very
much method; she kept pushing the rag around and around the same
spot, and her lips were tight-placed and tears showed in her eyes.
She said, "This started long ago. Why do I always push him away? I
always did. Now he goes somewhere else. It is too late."</p>

<p>She moved along the hall, water staining her dress. Her hair
loosened at the edges, coming across her forehead. Chin called,
"Miss Lige White, what you do there?"</p>

<p>She cried, "Get back to the kitchen," and was openly crying.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. ON THE TRAIL</h2>

<p class="first">REACHING Government Valley, Morgan located the
trail of the rustled cattle a quarter-mile from the old agency
buildings. The beef had been milled together and driven southward
toward the Potholes.</p>

<p>Morgan was considerably puzzled at the openhandedness of it. "It
is all branded stock," he said. "They can't keep it anywhere in
this country without my finding it. So that doesn't make sense.
There's but one way, which is to slaughter the stuff and bury the
hides. But if they slaughtered, where'd they sell that much meat?
Only other thing is to drive it completely out of the country."</p>

<p>"Well," said Harry Jump, "they could take it into the Potholes,
kill it and walk away from it."</p>

<p>"I can't see a rustler driving off stock and killing it simply
for fun.'"</p>

<p>"Skip the idea of rustlin' for a minute," suggested Jump.
"Figure that somebody did it to hamstring you&mdash;make a poor man
out of you in a hurry."</p>

<p>"You're talking about Herendeen now," said Morgan.</p>

<p>"As such."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll find out," said Morgan and led the group forward on
the trail. A few hundred yards onward it occurred to him that Fox
Willing was still with them. Harry Jump had thought about that also
and now gave Willing a considering glance. "This ain't the way home
for you," he suggested.</p>

<p>"I'll string along," said Fox Willing, "unless I ain't
wanted."</p>

<p>"No use getting tangled in my troubles," Morgan told him.
"Things are tough enough for you and your family."</p>

<p>"That's all right," returned Fox Willing with a trace of
stubbornness. "You did me a favor. And maybe I'm lookin' at my hole
card, too. If you lose out what happens to me? Herendeen would
drive me off tomorrow if he could."</p>

<p>Harry Jump pointed to Willing's gun. "That thing in workin'
condition?"</p>

<p>Willing said, "It's been used before." He showed a flare of
resentment in his gray-green eyes, he held Harry Jump's glance with
a kind of surly pride. Jump, a rough-and-tumble man himself, seemed
satisfied with what he saw and turned about in the saddle.</p>

<p>They rode along the flat country, with the Haycreek Hills to the
right and the Potholes a matter of four or five miles to the south.
The trail of the beef made a wiggling line in front of them,
pointed for the Potholes.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "If they're driving the beef into that section it
won't be far away."</p>

<p>But, half a mile farther on, Morgan saw that the beef wasn't
intended for the Potholes. The trail cut to the right, going into
the flank of the Haycreek Hills and aiming toward a low pass. More
and more puzzled, Morgan followed. They had been in entirely open
country; now as they rose with the slope of the hills they came to
a gradually thickening stand of pines. Harry Jump pushed forward to
ride with Morgan, dissatisfied and alert.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes peeled, Clay."</p>

<p>They were on the main traveled stage road which, coming out of
Herendeen's valley, cut through Haycreek Hills by the pass above
them and continued on across the Fanolango Desert. The lack of
caution in driving rustled beef on such a road increasingly puzzled
Morgan, and the subsequent indirection also puzzled him. Halfway
toward the pass the rustler&mdash;there was only one set of horse
tracks&mdash;had pushed the beef off the road into a trail skirted
by pines and high mounds of grass-covered slab rock. Morgan was in
the lead, now and then hearing Harry Jump's repeated grumblings of
caution. "Looks to me like this fellow changed his mind a couple of
times."</p>

<p>At this point the Haycreek Hills touched one edge of the
Potholes and the land here began to show the effects of the
geologic upheaval. The trail was narrow and circuitous and worked
upward to the summit of the Haycreek Hills by labored turns.
Through this extremely rough and lonely terrain the unknown rustler
had put the beef, single file. Harry Jump said: "Hell, we must be
right on top of it now. He couldn't make much of a drive through
here in a night's time. Clay, let me get ahead and scout the
land."</p>

<p>"Almost at the top," answered Morgan.</p>

<p>They were. The trail switched back and forth for the last mile
or so, coming to a summit meadow densely surrounded by timber. A
footless creek discharged its slow waters into a pond overgrown
with swamp grass and lily pads; the frogs ceased to croak, all at
once, when the party came by. The cattle had paused here for water,
their tracks deep-dug in the marginal mud. Morgan observed this
shadowed swampy meadow, its green stillness and its surrounding
wall of darkling trees, with a strong interest. The smell of the
rank water blended with the dry piny pungence of the hills and in
the air as well was the odor of a thousand forest influences, sweet
and wild and pervasive. He had, in times past, paused here briefly.
Observing it now, a feeling and a desire were touched off in
him&mdash;to make a camp here and watch moonlight lay its soft
silver streaks on the water and see the heavy black shadows curl
and settle and thicken in the timber, and wait for deer to come
upon the swamp's margin, slim-legged and cautious, with their
fragile heads sharp-poised a moment in the moonglow before they
muzzled the water. This was a man's life; a part of its
fullness&mdash;lying and listening to the loneliness of the hills
break before the voices of the little night travelers, to hear the
abrasive creaking of their feet and the sibilant movement of their
bodies through grass; to see small eyes winklessly shining; to hear
the "thunk" of a beaver's broad tail on the mud, and to see the
V-shaped ripples on the still water where a mink swam silently, or
a water ouzel cruised.</p>

<p>Long after he had passed into the timber, Morgan felt the pull
of his desire, and laid it away in his head as something soon to
do. There were only a few solid things in living and this was one
of them, if a man could stand the inevitable feeling which came
with that dark and silent camping: the feeling of lying hard
against an earth which, born of some flaming collision, now whirled
through space without destination and slowly grew
cold&mdash;carrying with it a mankind too small to matter.</p>

<p>Breaking out of the summit timber, he saw a meadow lying steeply
on the descending hillside, in which Herendeen's cattle grazed, and
his own cattle. There was no doubt of it; at this short distance he
was able to read his brand.</p>

<p>Harry Jump gave voice to his candid opinions. "Why, the brass-
faced biscuit-biter! He don't even give a damn if we find 'em. See,
Clay. It was Herendeen, like I said."</p>

<p>"Well," said Cap Vermilye, breaking a morning's silence, "let's
see about this."</p>

<p>All of them knew what he meant. They were smart enough in the
ways of trouble to look upon the trees surrounding this meadow with
clear suspicion; the cattle had been too easy to find. Without
saying anything at all, they worked away from this common spot,
Morgan and Willing to the left, Vermilye and Harry Jump taking the
opposite half-circle. Beating the edges of the timber quite
carefully, Morgan and Willing reached the bottom of the meadow
without noting anything out of the ordinary. Presently Vermilye and
Harry Jump joined them. Nothing had been discovered, but they sat
silently in their saddles, watching the grazing beef and not able
to shake their grudging suspicions.</p>

<p>Morgan said finally, "Well, let's get at it," and rode out of
the timber. He worked through the stock with Fox Willing while Jump
and Vermilye took stations near the trees. After Morgan and
Vermilye had collected all the Long Seven animals and had driven
them back into the forest trail the other two riders came up, ready
for the trip home. Morgan meanwhile had done some thinking.</p>

<p>"I'm going down to see Herendeen."</p>

<p>"Right with you," said Harry Jump at once.</p>

<p>"One's enough to lay this out pretty clear." Then he added
dryly, "I think I can lay it out so he'll understand."</p>

<p>"You must feel pretty stout," commented Harry Jump.</p>

<p>"Both of us together might bring on a scrap. But he won't turn
loose on one man."</p>

<p>"That's your opinion. It ain't mine."</p>

<p>"'He wouldn't shame himself before his crew by settin' the dogs
loose on me, alone. Drive the beef back. I'll be along."</p>

<p>This time he openly crossed the meadow and rode down-slope
through the thinning timber, to come at last to the rim of
Herendeen's valley. This was about five miles from the meadow and
still another three miles short of the Three Pines houses; dropping
down the shoulder of the hills, Morgan reached the road running
beside Cache River and set off southward at a brisk clip, soon
raising the ranch. From the intermediate distance he saw a pair of
men on the porch and somebody working in the corrals. When he
reached the yard both men on the porch had gone inside and
another&mdash;Bones McGeen&mdash;had come out.</p>

<p>McGeen's face showed its shadowed surprise and its alert
hostility. But he kept quiet until Morgan spoke.</p>

<p>"If Ben's in there, tell him to come out."</p>

<p>"He's here all right," grunted McGeen, and raised his voice:
"Ben&mdash;hey Ben!"</p>

<p>A man walked forward through the house, heavy and deliberate.
There were voices in the rear yard, softly talking and afterwards
ceasing to talk. Morgan looked at the horses standing by the front
yard and didn't recognize them; he was thinking about this when
Herendeen arrived.</p>

<p>"Ben," Morgan said at once, "I followed a pretty broad trail out
of Government Valley this afternoon. When I got to the end of it
there was a jag of Long Seven cows feeding in one of your meadows.
They didn't make the walk alone."</p>

<p>Herendeen's round, fresh-scarred face showed what seemed, to
Morgan, something close to surprise; he threw McGeen a quick look
but McGeen shook his head. Herendeen looked back to Morgan.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of it."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better get acquainted with your crew," suggested
Morgan.</p>

<p>"I'll go up in a day or so and see about it. If you've got any
beef there I'll send it back."</p>

<p>"I saved you the ride. The beef's on the way home now."</p>

<p>Herendeen said: "If there's any cutting to be done on my range
I'll do it. Bones, take a crowd up there and stop that. We'll see
what's going on."</p>

<p>Bones started around the corner of the house at once, to be
halted by Morgan's down-slapping answer. "Hold on. I'm going to
recite chapter and verse to you boys. The beef goes home and if you
figure to stop it, you better figure to stop the boys with it."</p>

<p>"If necessary, we'll do that, too," said Herendeen. "Bones, just
bring the crowd around here a minute." He came on to the edge of
the porch, his thick legs spreading and taking root. Bones moved
only as far as the house's corner; he raised his arm and moved back
toward the porch. Watching the corner, Morgan saw Chill Purdy and
Jim Burden and Slim John show up. These were old Three Pines men.
But there were four other men behind these three, unfamiliar to
him. They stopped by the corner. McGeen, throwing a look at them,
said in a voice that grated the words together, "Don't be bashful
in front of the great Clay Morgan." It seemed to be a signal. Two
of the strangers, both dark men with the same sharp, long-slanted
noses, stepped out from the corner and moved on until Morgan, now
watching Herendeen, lost them out of the corner of his eyes. They
were somewhere at his left rear; throwing a glance that way he saw
them halt fifty feet behind him.</p>

<p>Herendeen said: "Take a good look before you finish your speech,
Clay."</p>

<p>"I see nothing new," answered Morgan. "You always liked a big
crowd to stand behind."</p>

<p>McGeen said: "If it was me, Ben, I'd stop that talk."</p>

<p>Herendeen, so vast and heavy and big-boned, showed a thicker
flush on his light-skinned face. He was a man without much
quickness of tongue or mind. He lived on his feelings and on his
strength; and with one exception his strength had always been
enough. The exception was Morgan. He was affected by Morgan's cool
answer but he brushed it aside with a quick down-jerk of his fist
and went on.</p>

<p>"You hang around with crooks and you stick up for them. It will
be a damned cold day when you move anything off my range, no matter
what the brand reads. Take a look at these men. I have cleared out
Freeport and I have shaken some of the nesters loose. That's just a
beginning. I'm going to drive everything out of this country that
don't agree with me. That includes you. I didn't take your beef,
but if it is on my land it will stay there until I get ready to
move it off. The truth is, Clay, I propose to gut you down to your
last calf. If you're on Mogul come spring I'll be mighty
surprised."</p>

<p>Morgan said: "You always talked too much, Ben."</p>

<p>"That so?" cried Herendeen, his temper letting go. "McGeen, get
on your horse and do what I said."</p>

<p>McGeen walked toward the line of horses. Reaching them, he
turned back and his eyes swept the yard&mdash;to Morgan, to the two
dark men behind Morgan, and to Herendeen. There was a heavy
suggestion on his face for Herendeen to see, and Herendeen saw
it&mdash;and stood bright-eyed and hulking, thinking about it.
Morgan had this as a clear picture. Bones McGeen had put the thing
in Herendeen's head by that single glance.</p>

<p>Morgan's answer was to swing his horse partly around to get some
sight of the two behind him. He didn't know them, but he knew their
kind&mdash;he read the signals of character in the trustless
shadowing of their eyes, in the whipped thin length of their faces.
They were men out of the brush, nerved-up and edgy, without
scruples and thoroughly dangerous if given any kind of a chance.
Herendeen remained still and these men waited and the pile-up of
time got pretty bad; it was a weight on Morgan, an actual heaviness
on him. He had his bad moment, his gray foresight of the trap he
was in, he had his intuitive knowledge of how this might end; it
hit him in the stomach and turned him cold and fear ran all through
him, destructive and freezing; and afterwards, silently admitting
that he had nothing left him but the gamble of facing it out, he
put his hope aside, and as he did that, fear also left him. This,
he thought in one small side- thought, was a queer thing: Fear and
Hope were things that seemed to go together, and seemed to die
together.</p>

<p>"All right," McGeen said, "what'll it be?"</p>

<p>Herendeen repeated, "Do what I tell you, Bones. Get on up there
with the boys and head for the hills. Stop Morgan's crew."</p>

<p>Bones shook his head and one of the dark men at Morgan's rear
spoke for the first time. "What the hell, Herendeen? You got what
you want here. Whut you worryin' about?"</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Herendeen. "Do what I told you."</p>

<p>"Take care of this first," said Bones McGeen reluctantly.</p>

<p>Herendeen blew up. "God damn it, mind me!" He came off the porch
in long strides, crossing toward McGeen. McGeen stood near his
horse, his arms hanging down. A startled look showed on him and he
backed up until his shoulders touched the horse. He said, "Listen,
Ben, I don't take no talk like&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herendeen, a faster man than his bulk indicated, moved against
McGeen. He hit him once, knuckles slashing McGeen's cheek terribly.
McGeen, blinded and knocked thoughtless, hit the ground and made an
automatic gesture toward his gun, whereupon Herendeen jammed a foot
down on McGeen's arm, hard enough to make McGeen yell. Herendeen
ripped the gun from McGeen's holster and stepped back; the whole
thing had turned him white and half-crazy. He said, between
long-pulled breaths, "Get up on that horse before I break your
damned neck. You been talkin' back too much lately."</p>

<p>McGeen squirmed around the dirt and, got to his feet. He rubbed
a hand across the bruised side of his face; he started to open his
mouth and cringed a little from the pain it caused. His nose began
to drip blood; it struck his lips and rolled on down across his
chin in bright, ragged streaks, dropping from chin to shirt-front.
The dullness in his eyes showed how vitally that one blow had hurt
him.</p>

<p>"Get on the horse," said Herendeen, "and do what I say."</p>

<p>McGeen turned and reached for the reins. He missed them and
swept his hand out a second time, blindly. When he had them in his
fingers he put his head against the side of the horse, stupidly
still.</p>

<p>Herendeen said: "Go on or I'll bat you again."</p>

<p>McGeen made no attempt to throw the reins over the horse's head.
He seized the horn, pulling himself into his seat. He stiffened his
arms against the horn, bracing himself in this manner and closing
his eyes. He said, "Damned world is going around," and fell out of
the saddle suddenly; he hit on his face and belly, one arm doubled
beneath him, and did not move.</p>

<p>The two long-faced strangers came away from their spot behind
Morgan and paused to stare at McGeen. Herendeen bent over and
rolled McGeen on his back. McGeen's eyes were open but his muscles
had no life in them. Herendeen nudged McGeen's body with his toe,
saying, "Come out of it, Bones."</p>

<p>One of the strangers said in a disgusted voice: "That's no way
to treat a man."</p>

<p>Herendeen motioned toward a pair of his own crew. They came up
and seized McGeen, shoulders and feet, and lugged him over the
porch into the house. The two strangers went on toward the corner
of the house. They turned, no longer interested; something, Morgan
saw, had happened here pretty definitely. Herendeen saw it too, and
his talk jumped at them. "I'll do the talking around here. We're
riding up the hill. I'll see about this beef business." He turned
his attention to Morgan. "Get down from there."</p>

<p>"No," said Morgan, "I guess not."</p>

<p>Herendeen had his mind fixed; he drove his roused talk at
Morgan. "Times change. I'm through foolin' with you."</p>

<p>Morgan said, "Let 'er flicker then, Ben."</p>

<p>Behind Morgan, suddenly, was the sound of an advancing rider.
Everybody looked down the valley toward the newcomer except
Herendeen, who was caught in the grip of his own slow, flat- footed
will. He pointed a finger at Morgan and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You get down."</p>

<p>The rider came in behind Morgan, calling at once:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's up here?"</p>

<p>It was Lige White's voice. Herendeen turned his head,
reluctantly recognizing White. White came on until he was beside
Morgan, reining in there with a certain deliberateness. His glance
swept the yard and saw everything at once; and seeing it, he came
to a rapid decision. This charming, easy-mannered man was
deceptive. He could, when he chose, move fast.</p>

<p>"I'm on the way to War Pass. Better come along, Clay, if you're
through here."</p>

<p>"I'm through," drawled Morgan, "if Ben is."</p>

<p>Lige White said briskly: "No objections, Ben?"</p>

<p>Herendeen showed a black and sullen and on-driving temper.
"Lige," he called out, "you're interfering. What side you on?"</p>

<p>"On the side of my friends," said White. "You're my friend, and
so is Morgan."</p>

<p>"Then you're no friend of mine."</p>

<p>White said coolly: "That's your business, naturally. I think I
understand what's in the wind here and of course I could not stand
by and see a shooting. The odds are a little strong. I'm surprised
at you, Ben." He stared at the new men in the yard. He ducked his
head at them. "News to me that you were short-handed on this ranch.
When did you find it necessary to bring in the Ryder boys? I don't
like that kind of business and I will not be a party to a general
ruckus. If we've got to hire outside men, the situation is getting
completely out of hand."</p>

<p>Herendeen listened to this frank talk with a flat-jawed
unreason. He said: "If you're not with me, then you're against me,
Lige. Don't come around here for help&mdash;and keep out of my
business."</p>

<p>"Both very easy to do," retorted White. "I will give you the
same advice. Ready, Clay?"</p>

<p>It was still close and risky, as they both knew. Morgan swapped
a short glance with the smiling White, seeing a thorough
understanding in the latter's eyes. Morgan made the decision for
both of them at this moment, turning his horse squarely on
Herendeen. The movement pulled White around and thus the two of
them, holding their horses to a walk, passed down the yard in a
silence that had no bottom. It was the longest stretch of time
Morgan had ever known, for he realized that Herendeen, caught
between desire and caution, swayed on a dangerous edge. The man had
changed. Some saving grace had gone out of him in the recent weeks,
leaving him ungovernably set in his course, leaving him brutal and
overbearing. He had always used his physical strength to get his
way but until now some restraint of decency had held him in a
fairly civilized pattern. That was gone; and so these moments while
Morgan rode on down the yard were fatally heavy.</p>

<p>White rode with his head down, his eyes narrowly set; the
knuckles of his rein hand were white from pressure. A hundred yards
away Morgan murmured, "It's all right, Lige."</p>

<p>Lige White let a tremendous breath out of him, saying nothing
until they had doubled the distance. "My God, Clay, what did you
come here alone for?"</p>

<p>The river road bent around a point. Reaching this point, ready
to turn it and shut the Three Pines ranch house from sight, Morgan
had his backward glance. Herendeen and his men were in the saddle,
heading for the Haycreek Hills. They were going after the beef,
Morgan knew. He faced front again and set his horse into a canter,
realizing he had a fast ride ahead.</p>

<p>Lige White came abreast. "Clay, I'm ashamed to say it, but I've
strung along with Ben, not liking what's been going on around me. I
still do not like it, but I cannot tolerate this kind of a war.
Keep away from him. The man's gone crazy."</p>

<p>"A little late now," said Morgan. "There's a fight coming. Ben's
made up his mind, and so have I. Stay out of it, Lige. And see if
you can get Gurd to do the same." He stopped, pointing up the
slope. "That's my way. Tell Gurd to stay out of it."</p>

<p>Lige White said with the greatest reluctance: "I have hated to
see this day come."</p>

<p>"A long time coming," said Morgan, and put his horse to the
slope.</p>

<p>Lige White watched him climb, excitement mirroring brightly in
his eyes; afterwards he continued along the road, bound for Gurd
Grant's.</p>

<p>Pete Borders, who had driven the Long Seven beef across the
Haycreek Hills to Herendeen's range, lay on a peak of the ridge
throughout the middle of the day. He saw Morgan arrive at the
meadow&mdash;and grinned to himself at what was no doubt in
Morgan's mind. It looked like an open steal on Herendeen's part,
which was the way Borders wanted it to look. There was this sly and
malicious forethought in Borders' head, this intent to bring on a
fight that had been long brewing. Deep in his mind, behind this
trickery, were purposes of his own&mdash;to help ruin Herendeen
who, sooner or later, would betray him.</p>

<p>Later when he saw Morgan headed for Herendeen's alone, Pete
Borders grew serious and a little restless. It was, he concluded,
bad tactics on Morgan's part; and so, taking to his horse, he went
along the Haycreek Hills until he was able to sight the Three Pines
ranch from the heights. He made out the crowd in the yard and
watched the parley; later he saw a new rider come along&mdash;which
was Lige White&mdash;and saw two of them ride away. Morgan had got
out of it with a whole skin, which relieved Borders immeasurably.
From this same vantage point Borders later watched the Three Pines
crew come into the hills. He was pretty certain then how it would
be. Getting to his horse, he rode back into the timber, once more
laughing to himself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. THE RUN OF HOURS</h2>

<p class="first">AS soon as Morgan left Lige White, he turned his
horse to the slope of the Haycreek Hills and presently, from a high
point, he saw Herendeen leave the valley with his crew. Morgan
calculated his margin of advantage to be about twenty minutes and
entered the timber at a fast clip. He crossed the meadow wherein
they had found the Long Seven beef and took to the dark trail
beyond. The smell of dust still clung to the air from the passage
of the cattle; it was in the middle of the afternoon, the sun
half-down in the west sky, and when he came to the swampy clearing
the shadows had begun to reach out over the water.</p>

<p>He caught up with his outfit a mile or two beyond the swamp. The
cattle were single file, going very slowly on the crooked trail and
stretched out for three or four hundred yards. Cap Vermilye was in
front of them, beyond sight. Fox Willing held the rear, with Harry
Jump still farther back to cover whatever might come up. Harry Jump
was a little edgy with the strain of this thing; he showed relief
at Morgan's presence.</p>

<p>"I been on the verge of ridin' back after you."</p>

<p>"They're half an hour behind me. We're apt to have a scrap."</p>

<p>"Hell with 'em," said Harry Jump at once. "Let's stop and have
it out."</p>

<p>"Keep right on going. Fox, cut ahead and ride with Cap. If you
hear any ruckus back here, join us. If you meet anything in front,
let out a yell and we'll be right with you."</p>

<p>Fox, unable to crowd by the beef on so narrow a way, cut through
the timber and rough slab rock with considerable difficulty. Harry
Jump began to grumble at the lagging cattle, crowding them with his
pony. Morgan dropped back a distance to watch the trail; there was
no great danger of Herendeen boxing them on the flanks, the country
being far too rough for that. Either Herendeen would follow
directly, or sweep wide through the Potholes and meet them out on
the flats.</p>

<p>They came at last to the stage road and turned into it. From the
swamp meadow to this point had been more than an hour's drive and
Herendeen was long overdue, leading Morgan to believe that
Herendeen had circled them. The trouble, then, would come when they
reached the open country. He joined Harry Jump, both of them hazing
the stragglers forward until the beef was in a compact bunch.
Vermilye and Willing were fifty yards forward; now and then a cow
wandered toward the jack-pine forest surrounding them and had to be
cut back. At five o'clock they reached the bottom of the stage
road, left the pines and swung toward Government Valley, three
miles distant.</p>

<p>Herendeen was nowhere to be seen, whereupon Harry Jump came to
his suspecting conclusions. "He didn't want to try it in timber.
He's waitin' for us to get in the middle of the flats. My idea is
that he's watchin' us from the Potholes right now."</p>

<p>A similar thought had occurred to Vermilye. He trotted back to
Morgan. "Now in case he comes a-bustin' out of the brush, Clay, we
better just let this beef go and hit for them agency
buildings."</p>

<p>"No," said Jump at once. "It's our beef, by God."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Morgan.</p>

<p>Vermilye joined Harry Jump, both of them urging the cattle along
at a quicker gait. Morgan closely watched the back trail, not quite
able to understand Herendeen's continued delay. The suspense worked
on his nerves. Once, thinking he saw movement at the edge of the
Potholes, he turned and made a stand, searching the black margin of
that country quite carefully. He had been mistaken, however, and
presently turned to catch up with the beef. Near six o'clock, with
the sun down below the Cache Mountains, they threw the beef on
their own grass near the shattered dobe buildings of the old
agency.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Hold this jag in a bunch. We're not through yet. I
want Herendeen to see what we took. Fox, if I were you I think I'd
pull freight. Thanks for comin' along."</p>

<p>Willing said, idly: "Might as well stick around."</p>

<p>Cap Vermilye, always a forehanded man, got a few sage stems and
a piece of old board from the nearest building to make up a fire.
He had a frying pan and coffeepot in his saddle roll and some bacon
and a can of beans. He boiled up the coffee, fried the bacon and
heated the beans in the frying pan's grease. Having no other
utensils, they took turns at the frying pan, using their pocket
knives, and drank the coffee straight from the pot. At seven
o'clock, with shadows sweeping across Mogul's plateau, a single
horseman appeared on the high edge of Mogul Mountain and quartered
down. This was in the west, from which Morgan expected no trouble.
Harry Jump walked deliberately to his horse and pulled out his
Winchester. Morgan said, "Hold on, Harry." Rider and the horse
plodded unhurriedly through the blue swirl of dusk&mdash;a long
stooped shape on a raw-boned animal; at a distance he waved his arm
overhead and a little later Morgan recognized the nester Gale.</p>

<p>Gale came up but did not dismount until Morgan gave him the
proper invitation. When the invitation came he dropped to the
ground with an old man's stiffness; he poised both his hands over
the muzzle of his ancient gun and looked out from beneath twisted
awning-shaped eyebrows.</p>

<p>"There's some coffee left in the pot," said Morgan.</p>

<p>"Just whut I need," Gale answered. He slouched over the fire and
tipped the pot against his mouth, drinking with an acute thirst.
Coffee ran down the seams of his jaws. He said, "Ah," in great
relish and sponged the liquid from the tips of his mustache with
sidewise motions of his tongue.</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Don't mean to be unfriendly, but maybe you ought
to move on."</p>

<p>Gale didn't smile. He was past the point of finding amusement in
the world, but in his eyes was a light like the last glow of coals
of a dying fire. "Don't you worry about me. If I didn't know whut I
wanted to do, I wouldn't be here."</p>

<p>Morgan shrugged his shoulders. "Your funeral."</p>

<p>"It may be," agreed Gale composedly. "But if so, it will be a
double one. At my age I'm too old to worry about dyin', for it is
pretty close to me at any event, and I guess I'm poor enough not to
fret about losin' anything. Most of my life I have spent tryin' to
be agreeable to people, in order to make a livin'. A common man has
to swallow a lot of dust and a lot of pride. It goes kinda hard at
times. By and by he gets to thinkin' that maybe someday, before he
shuffles off, his chance will come to take one shot at those
high-and-mighty ones before which he has bowed and eaten his humble
bread. You're a young man, Mr. Morgan, and you're free and you
ain't ever had that happen to you. You ain't ever watched your wife
or your kids cringe when a shot comes whinin' around the house. You
ain't seen your wife look into an empty breadbox. That's a look it
ain't good for any man to see. So you don't know whut it is like,
or just how I might be feelin' about it now. I ain't in no hurry. I
got a lot of time. That's all I ever had&mdash;just time."</p>

<p>He rummaged his pockets, producing pipe and tobacco. Morgan
watched him fill the pipe and light it and settle on his heels,
comfort coming to him as his lips chuffed on the pipestem. Faded
and weatherbeaten and now silent, he was a picture of gristle- worn
endurance, of infinite patience. His eyes still held that alive
glow; they showed the one vital thing in him.</p>

<p>This was late September and suddenly, slightly beyond seven
o'clock, the blue-running shadows turned to gunmetal gray and
afterwards to full night. The haze of autumn lay over the land.
Through this filtered a strong moonlight creating the effect of
woolly clouds banked against the earth. Morgan led his horse to the
remnant wall of the nearest dobe building and walked on until he
stood alone, facing the open south. Fox Willing was in the saddle,
circling the held bunch of beeves. The job was done and, as far as
the cattle were concerned, there wasn't any need of staying here.
Yet Morgan knew that this waiting was necessary. Herendeen was
somewhere in the yonder night. The big man had avoided a meeting in
the timber, be had delayed his pursuit; but he was out there and he
would come. Nothing changed much, Morgan realized. Herendeen had
faced him for ten years, never giving ground, never able to forget.
It was something that would not dim or die, it was a force that
drove Herendeen. Thinking about that, Morgan admitted the same
force drove him. Whatever the outward reasons, whatever the open
quarrels and excuses, there was a deeper reason still&mdash;the
native, chemical animosities of two men born to be opposite in all
things, born to collide and to destroy. It was past
explanation.</p>

<p>Stationed like this, apart from the group and facing southward,
he heard Herendeen at last approach, hidden by the pulsing fog. Off
there a steady rhythm rose, of horses moving at a slow run and
presently slowing to a walk. Shadows appeared in the fog, and
shapeless outlines. Fox Willing came in from the herd, dismounting
and putting his horse near the dobe wall. He walked over to Morgan.
Vermilye and Jump had risen and had taken position not far from the
wall. Gale was out of sight.</p>

<p>Herendeen's party showed as a wide scatter of shadows on the
desert. They were halted, two hundred feet away. Herendeen
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Morgan, I'm coming in to cut that bunch of stock and look it
over for my brand."</p>

<p>Morgan said: "None of your cows in it, Ben."</p>

<p>"I'll see for myself."</p>

<p>Those shadows were too vague to be counted but Morgan knew
Herendeen had at least eight men around him; and he also knew
Herendeen's intention&mdash;which was to build up a fight on any
grounds. He said: "Charley Hillhouse there?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm coming in."</p>

<p>Morgan said: "Nothing here for you, Ben. Stay back."</p>

<p>Herendeen's voice boomed out. "You know the rules of the
country. It's my privilege to cut any man's range for my stock. I
claim there's Three Pines cows in that bunch."</p>

<p>"If there are," said Morgan coolly, "I'll send them back
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I want 'em now."</p>

<p>"You're in a hurry all of a sudden," pointed out Morgan
ironically. "I sent word to you some time ago to clean your stuff
out of this valley and you didn't seem to figure it worth your
time. So you can wait another day. You won't cut this bunch
tonight, or any time. Get off my grass."</p>

<p>"You goin' against the rules?"</p>

<p>"You been making the rules a long time, Ben. Now I'll make
'em."</p>

<p>Herendeen said: "I've listened to you long enough. We'll settle
this now."</p>

<p>Morgan's reply was soft and flat in the night. "Let 'er flicker,
Ben. When you move in we start shootin'."</p>

<p>He heard Herendeen say: "Come on, boys."</p>

<p>Lige White, considerably disturbed by his interview with Morgan
and pretty much at sea in his own mind, traveled over the lower
spur at the Haycreek Hills and came down on the Grant house at a
fast clip, the sound of his arrival bringing Catherine to the door.
He said: "There's hell to pay around here. Where's Gurd?"</p>

<p>"Upstairs. What's the trouble, Lige?"</p>

<p>White called: "Hey, Gurd, come down right now." He rolled
himself a cigarette while he waited and made a sketchy explanation
to Catherine, nervousness catching at his words. "I ran into Clay
at Herendeen's. They were jawing over something and Herendeen had a
bunch of tough hands around the place. Clay was there alone. It
looked like trouble for a minute but I dragged Clay away." Gurd
appeared in the doorway of the house, strained and attentive.
"Clay," went on Lige White, "said he thought there'd be a fight. He
went back to the hills."</p>

<p>Catherine said: "Whereabouts in the hills?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Lige White considered these two people gravely.
"I always led Ben to believe I'd string with him in any showdown
over rustlers. And I guess I have given him reason to believe I
approved his way of getting nesters out of the country. But I can't
see him tie into Clay. Gurd, don't you give him any help. Stay out
of it. That's what Clay told me to say. I'd say it anyhow."</p>

<p>Catherine said at once: "If there's any help needed from
Crowfoot Clay will get it, not Ben Herendeen."</p>

<p>Gurd Grant looked sick and desperate. He put his shoulder
against the doorway. He said: "Lige, how did we get into this mess?
I'd give a thousand dollars&mdash;"</p>

<p>Catherine turned on her brother. "What's bothering you,
Gurd?"</p>

<p>Gurd dropped his eyes. His face, normally so light and cheerful,
held a sallow unhealth. It was hard for him to talk and he pulled
himself together with an effort. His hands shook; he noticed that
and shoved them into his pockets. "I was over with Charley
Hillhouse, on Breathitt's trail. We trailed Breathitt all morning
and found him asleep in the Potholes. Of course I thought Charley
meant to take him into town, to jail. What else would a man think?
How was it possible for me to figure that Hillhouse, who had been
Hack's friend for fifteen years, would&mdash;"</p>

<p>Catherine breathed out: "Gurd!"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Gurd Grant, sullen and full of self-hatred.</p>

<p>"Hillhouse simply lifted his gun and killed Breathitt. I tried
to stop it. It didn't do any good. Charley would have killed me if
I'd gone any farther. What kind of a heart is in a man like
Hillhouse? My God, how could he think of it?"</p>

<p>Lige White threw away his cigarette, finding the flavor gone out
of it. He looked away from Gurd, suddenly unable to meet the
expression in the other's eyes. Thus silent and indrawn, repulsed
by the information and hardened indescribably by it, his liking for
Gurd Grant slowly shriveled. Gurd Grant saw this withdrawal; he saw
the change on Lige White's face very clearly, and he said in a
quietly weary, terribly discouraged voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What could I do, Lige?"</p>

<p>"Why nothing, I guess," said Lige briefly.</p>

<p>"No;" answered Gurd, shaking his head, "you think I ought to
have done something. That's what everybody will think. I guess
that's what I think, too. God knows I won't ever forget it. But I
don't know what I could have done." His voice trailed pointlessly
away. "I don't know..."</p>

<p>Catherine said: "You never should have gone with Charley
Hillhouse. There was your mistake."</p>

<p>Lige White said: "What did you go for? I don't understand that.
You had nothing against Hack. He was Morgan's best friend. You knew
that. Why?"</p>

<p>Gurd shook his head, not answering. He stood with his face
tipped down, the grisly memory of all this on his features.
Catherine suddenly stepped over to her brother and put her arm
around him. "I know why, Gurd, Let's try to forget it."</p>

<p>"Why?" insisted Lige.</p>

<p>But Catherine's eyes told Lige to be still. She was a tall and
resolute girl, firm-shaped and attractive to look upon, and very
loyal to her brother. She stood with her chin up and her shoulders
squared, as though to resist anything that might hurt Gurd. Lige
White, who had an eye for beauty wherever he saw it, silently
admired her. She had a steadfast quality lacking in Gurd; she had a
sober willfulness and an imagination that caught the color and
melody of life around her. These qualities enriched Catherine
Grant, they made her a full girl, placing a shadowing and a shining
on her features, giving her a dreaming depth.</p>

<p>Lige said: "Stay out of what's coming. That's the best you can
do for Clay now. We all got caught in Ben's net. I was a fool not
to have known what he'd try to do. Now we wiggle out. I'm going to
town."</p>

<p>Catherine watched him go. When he passed the far rim of the
meadow she dropped her arm from Gurd and faced him. "This is hard
enough on you, Gurd, without my making it worse. I'll never say
anything more about it."</p>

<p>He said in a lackluster voice: "I don't admire myself right now,
Catherine. It is hell for a man to find out he's a tinhorn sport. I
always figured I could stand up when the showdown came. But I
didn't."</p>

<p>Her tone was soft and cool. "You went after Hack because you
wanted to hurt Clay. I know that. You thought Clay and I..."</p>

<p>He showed a reviving flash of anger: "The night Ben and Lige and
I went up to Clay's place you were there. I walked to the end of
the porch and saw your horse around the house. You were hiding
inside. If you had nothing to be ashamed of, why hide?"</p>

<p>She said: "Because I had gone up there to tell Clay what you and
Lige and Herendeen had said that night. You were leaving Clay out
of it, and I couldn't stand that. Ben had both of you convinced.
But I didn't want Ben to know I was taking Clay the
information."</p>

<p>Gurd said: "You can't blame me for thinking different. Ever
since you have known Clay, there's been something between you. When
you two are together I can see it in your eyes."</p>

<p>She murmured: "Am I that transparent?"</p>

<p>He stared at her as though all his suspicions had been
confirmed. "Then," he said in dull reproach, "I'm right."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that, Gurd. What I mean was that I didn't know I
wore my feelings on my sleeve."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't show it," he pointed out, "if there wasn't
something pretty strong between the two of you. I'm not the
brightest man in the world but when Clay comes up I see you change.
It's the way you look at him, it's the way your voice lifts. It is
something the both of you know and don't have to talk about.
Like..." He paused to think of it and added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Like a man and wife looking at each other."</p>

<p>That brought color to her cheeks. She faced Gurd, her shoulders
pulled up and with her chin lifted. They were exceptionally close
for brother and sister and yet at times this girl had a way of
retreating from him; at times her silence was a wall hiding her
completely. He was proud of her in a way that she couldn't realize,
proud of her beauty and her fine laughter and of her freedom, and
because of this he was inordinately jealous of her reputation. This
explained Gurd Grant's anger now&mdash;this burning resentment
toward a man who claimed more of her than any man had a right to
claim. It was a bitter thing to stand here and know the kind of
memories she had. Something in her expression made him drop his
glance. Her voice was soft, it was long-remembering. "Whatever it
may be, it is part of my life and part of Clay's. It belongs to
nobody else. There is no day or hour or moment of the past I regret
or am ashamed of. Remember, Gurd, I have known Clay many years."
Then she added, quite gently, "I knew him before Lila did."</p>

<p>"And after he threw you over," pointed out Gurd, "you still
stood around, waiting."</p>

<p>She said in a swift, sighing voice: "Not waiting, Gurd. Women
don't wait for things they can't have. They're more practical than
that. They take the best they can get and go on with it."</p>

<p>He said: "Which doesn't make sense, for you could have had a
dozen men&mdash;and you could have Ben now."</p>

<p>"If I could have found any man I really liked I would have
married him&mdash;to hurt Clay as much as he hurt me. You don't
know how bad it was for me. You never will know. But..." She
shrugged her shoulders. "There never was a man. Not one to fill
Clay's place."</p>

<p>"Hurt him?" said Gurd, finding all this strange and
unfathomable.</p>

<p>She gave him a small, wise smile. "Of course. He knows how much
he hurt me. That is one of the things you see in his eyes, Gurd,
when he looks at me. He knows. And he knows how much I could hurt
him, even now."</p>

<p>"If it is that way between you," said Gurd unbelievingly, "what
keeps you apart?"</p>

<p>"More memories," said Catherine. Her lips came softly together
and the old dreaming was in her eyes again, past his understanding.
Gurd shook his head with impatience.</p>

<p>"You're contradictin' yourself, Sis. You're still waiting."</p>

<p>He had never seen her cry. Now, meeting her eyes, he thought he
saw tears in them. For the briefest of moment her pride dropped and
he noticed something in her that was warm and wild and shocking. He
had never known that her laughter and her cool pride had covered
this intensity of emotion or this whole-bodied surrender to desire.
She was saying: "Gurd, don't be stupid! Don't pry into me."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said. "I guess I've done something else wrong.
God knows what I can do now."</p>

<p>She said: "If I knew where Clay was..."</p>

<p>Gurd, stung by his mistakes, still remembered he had given his
word to Herendeen. It was the one thing to which he could cling. So
he said: "We can't go against him. I'll do nothing, one way or the
other."</p>

<p>She went on, as though not hearing him. "They have quarreled too
often. They'll meet." She stared at her brother, cold as ice. "If
Clay should die, I think I'd kill Ben. Is it so horrible to say?
Perhaps it is. But I can't help it. All that I know of Clay, all
that we have been&mdash;all the things said and the things
unsaid...There is too much of him in me. If he should die, what
would be left of me? Not very much, Gurd."</p>

<p>She walked from the porch to her horse standing by. Gurd said,
"Wait a minute&mdash;where you going?" She didn't answer. Swinging
up a hand she left the yard, bound toward Mogul's rim.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. THE SMALL STILL VOICE</h2>

<p class="first">CHARLEY HILLHOUSE brought up Breathitt's horse and
lashed the dead man to the saddle and took him back to Three Pines.
When he came to describe the affair to Herendeen the words seemed
to stick in his dry throat. It puzzled him, that it should be so
hard to make a simple story of it. Too, there was an odd look in
Herendeen's eyes and something queer in his voice. Herendeen said
slowly: "All right, Charley." Nothing more.</p>

<p>Hillhouse said: "I'm takin' him into War Pass. That's where his
people are buried."</p>

<p>Herendeen gave Hillhouse a wondering stare and went into the
house. Hillhouse hitched a team to the flatbed wagon, covered
Breathitt with a tarp and drove to town. It was a long trip and he
found himself returning constantly to one wish. In fact, along that
journey, he spoke his wish aloud. "Wish you'd seen it my way, Hack.
I couldn't do nothing else." This seemed important to him. He could
have done nothing else. A crook was a crook. He had shot Ollie
Jacks; how could he, being a just man, do differently with
Breathitt? All the old times were as nothing against a man's
righteous regard for his principles.</p>

<p>He found himself going into the past, remembering when Hack and
he had gotten into difficulties at the Long Grade saloon. The two
of them against the town. Hack, he recalled, stood against the
street wall, covering the room, while he, Charley, backed out; and
both of them, out in the desert, had stopped to laugh about it.
Hack always found something funny in the day, he could always
laugh. He had even smiled when he knew he was to be shot. Hillhouse
stirred on the wagon seat; he rubbed the reins between his fingers
and lowered his hat against the late-slanting sun. He drove through
War Pass. When he backed against the office door of Doctor Padden,
who was also coroner, Jesse Rusey came by. Hillhouse said: "Give me
a hand, Jesse," and the two of them carried Breathitt into Padden's
office. Padden wasn't around but there was a side room with a long
table in it; they left Breathitt here. Rusey said: "A little
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>Rusey said, "Too bad," and went out. The marshal's province was
War Pass, not anything beyond; and he had seen too much death to
show much curiosity about one more dead man. Hillhouse delayed his
departure, both hands lying on the table beside Breathitt.
Breathitt's face was gray and dirty, but it was still the face of a
man who had looked on life as a game to be taken as lightly as
possible. This was the thing which bothered Hillhouse most at the
moment. Hack's eyes were open; they were light and clear and when
Hillhouse bent forward they seemed to look straight at him, with
the same ironic disbelief, as though he knew some secret about life
Hillhouse didn't know. Hillhouse suddenly removed his own hat,
placed it over Hack's face and turned from the room.</p>

<p>He drove the wagon as far as the Long Grade, here stopping for a
drink. The barkeep made some casual remark about the weather which
Hillhouse accepted in dour silence; thereafter the barkeep held his
own council. Hillhouse paid for the drink, went out and climbed
into the wagon. He held the reins in his hand, a foot poised on the
brake. The afternoon was pretty much gone, with sunlight striking
high on the east walls of the street. A stage rolled in from the
desert. Jesse Rusey had his body tilted against the corner of the
post office; his hat came down over his eyes and he seemed
disinterested in everything, but Hillhouse knew Rusey watched him
closely. It irritated Hillhouse, it got on his nerves. Ann McGarrah
came from the general store, gave him a smileless look, and walked
on; two small boys passed him, kicking up the dust with their
heels. Suddenly Hillhouse wrapped the reins around the brake-handle
and re-entered the saloon. He said: "I'll take along a quart of
rye," paid for it and returned to the wagon. Once more ready to go,
he called to Rusey: "Morgan ought to know about this. He'd want to
see Hack buried."</p>

<p>Rusey neither spoke nor nodded. Hillhouse, going out of town,
thought to himself: "Somebody's going to make that man give a civil
answer one of these days." Mrs. Benson stood on her porch at the
end of the town road&mdash;buxom and attractive and looking out at
the road with a certain sober loneliness. Hillhouse was a courteous
man toward women but he had his hard and fast distinctions as to
quality, and looked at her and looked away, not lifting his
hat.</p>

<p>There was no travel on the road. It wound with the foothills, it
looped beside a creek, passed over a small divide and entered a
scattered belt of timber. By the Dell Lake trail, he observed that
three or four horsemen had recently come off Mogul; far up near
Mogul's rim he caught the transitory motion of a rider. All these
things he automatically noted, missing nothing of the signs or
shapes or color of the land. Four miles from town he broke the neck
of the bottle of rye over the brake-handle and took a long drink.
At the foot of the gentle grade leading to Herendeen's valley he
saw Lige White come out of Crowfoot way, and at once pulled in,
awaiting the Running W owner's arrival. It was not particularly
characteristic of Hillhouse to waste time on the road but there was
in him now a need for talk. His own company wasn't very good, and
so he had a feeling of actual relief when Lige White reached the
main road and trotted forward.</p>

<p>Hillhouse said: "What's new?"</p>

<p>Lige White reined in, staring at him with a stiff-set
expression. He didn't answer at the moment. Hillhouse had enough
liquor in him to speak with a conscious distinctness. "No," he
said, "I ain't drunk, Lige. Can't say I'm far from it, though. Been
a funny day. Any news?"</p>

<p>"Charley," said Lige White, "don't ever come around my range,
and don't ever try to make any talk with me."</p>

<p>Hillhouse held himself rigidly on the seat. "What," he asked in
a singsong voice, "have I done to trouble you?"</p>

<p>"You're a dirty damned dog," said Lige White, his anger a
precise and distant and biting thing. "There are things white men
don't do. If I were Morgan I'd follow you all the way to hell.
Don't ever cross my tracks." That was all. He went on at a brisk
trot.</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse stared ahead of him but saw nothing at the
moment; his mind struggled with Lige White's talk. He scrubbed a
palm across his face and covered his eyes a moment, and looked
again at the fading day. At this hour, with the sun hidden by the
Cache Mountains, the sharp edges of the land began to blur, and for
a moment Charley thought his eyesight was going bad. He reached for
the bottle, took another stout drink, and drove on.</p>

<p>A mile beyond this point Cache River cut nearer the road and a
small grove of cottonwood lay hard by the stream.</p>

<p>Charley turned through the grove and let his horses water at the
margin of the river. He wrapped the reins around the brake- handle
and got down, holding the whisky bottle. Slouched against the high
wheel, he drank again and waited for the liquor to drop its hood
over the things in his mind. But this surcease from thinking never
came; drunk as he was, heavy as his body was and thick as his
tongue felt, one small piece of his brain was a bright island of
memory, holding its clear pictures of Hack Breathitt, of Hack's
smile and Hack's eyes staring at him. He heard Hack saying again:
"You won't sleep any more, kid, and your grub will taste like
sawdust. Remember that."</p>

<p>Charley Hillhouse spoke aloud: "I wish you'd seen it my way,
Hack. I wish you had." He walked steadily forward until he faced a
cottonwood. He drew his gun, holding it only a foot from the tree,
and fired at it. Afterwards, stooping a little he studied the hole
made by the bullet with a strange care. He held the bottle of rye
in his left hand and now, knowing it would do him no good ever, he
gave it a long overhand heave into the river. As long as he was
alive, nothing would cover up his thinking.</p>

<p>He murmured: "Smart man, Hack. Smarter'n hell. How'd you know
those things?"</p>

<p>A mile away, Lige White heard Charley's shot and stopped his
horse. The road had turned a bend so that he could not see the
valley; but he waited, listening for the shot's repetition, and
while waiting he saw Vance Ketchell come down the slope of Cache
Mountain and reach the river. Vance crossed over and came up, he
said:</p>

<p>"Know where Morgan is?"</p>

<p>"Beyond Haycreek somewhere. Maybe near the Potholes. He was
headed that way an hour or more ago."</p>

<p>Vance Ketchell said: "Lige, I'm kickin' over the bucket. I
better tell you that&mdash;in case you're stringin' along with Ben
Herendeen." That was all. Turning, he shot into the pines toward
Dell Lake, and toward the rim of Mogul. Lige White pushed back the
brim of his hat, scratching the edges of his jet hair. His
expressive and handsome face was quite serious, quite still.
Suddenly he said, "Oh, dammit to hell! Vance&mdash;wait a minute,
wait for me," and rushed after Ketchell.</p>

<p>Excitement whetted Morgan's nerves to a sharp edge as he stood
there and heard Ben Herendeen say: "Come on, boys!" Their horses
were moving slowly through a night whose thick fog haze smothered
everything. All shapes were mealy and vague. The campfire showed a
round dull spot of red on the earth nearby. Moving to it quickly he
stamped the embers beneath his feet&mdash;and then heard the rapid
run of riders coming out of the west. A voice, long and imperative,
sailed on&mdash;Vance Ketchell's voice: "Clay!"</p>

<p>Harry Jump called back at once. "Right by the dobe houses."</p>

<p>Herendeen's outfit meanwhile drifted in and a man yelled, "Bust
'em up!" That whole group broke into a run. Jump bumped into
Morgan. He murmured: "Don't move around in this soup, Clay, or
we're lost." The beef, bunched between the buildings and
Herendeen's oncoming party, drifted aside. Herendeen's group came
nearer and nearer, and at this moment Gale's buffalo gun began to
boom out its massive echoes. Harry Jump grumbled, "Ah"&mdash;and
fired and moved away from Morgan.</p>

<p>A man yelled, "To hell with this!" Morgan, awaiting a more
definite target, saw one rider swing wide and rush in. Suddenly all
of Herendeen's men were wheeling around the beef, running for the
dobe building near by, as though to circle it. Vance Ketchell
called again to announce himself: "It's me, Ketchell&mdash;and Lige
White." They raced down on Morgan. He had to step aside, barely
avoiding a collision. Vance was out of the saddle, beside him and
grumbling, "Damned near too late!" Lige White, still mounted,
turned away. He called: "Herendeen&mdash;cut this out!" One of
Herendeen's riders plunged straight on and fired once at Lige
White's high-placed shape, Morgan and Ketchell laid their shots on
this man. They caught his horse and watched it sink, they saw the
rider free himself and seem to flatten against the earth. Morgan
ran forward, trying to keep that man's shadow within his vision as
it drifted along the ground. A shot exploded in his face, but he
had the man spotted then and hit him with his first bullet. A horse
came by him, riderless and confused and he knew at once Lige White
had been knocked down. He turned back to locate White. He said,
"Lige&mdash; Lige," and felt lead wither by him. Herendeen had
reached the dobe and was charging forward. Everybody seemed to be
over there in a quick, wicked dog-fight. The shadows made everybody
reckless, the shadows covered everything and Gale's heavy gun
boomed at clocklike intervals, reminding Morgan, even at this hot
moment, of the old nester's relentless patience.</p>

<p>Morgan, throwing himself into the confused heart of the fight,
put Lige White out of his mind. All his men were close to the
ground, whereas Herendeen's party, so headlong in attack, clung to
their saddles and crisscrossed the area around the dobe buildings,
circling and charging and vanishing. A horse rushed at him in these
close quarters. Morgan backed against the dobe wall and watched the
brute's shape blacken and grow tall against him. The horse, sensing
the wall, whipped around and Morgan took a snap aim on the rider,
who wheeled low, avoided the bullet meant for him, and slid around
the dobe.</p>

<p>The rest of Herendeen's men had veered off. Harry Jump ran
forward, calmly swearing at them. He said: "Come on and get a
bellyful!" Gale's gun went Whung! Over by the second dobe, forty
yards distant, Herendeen's voice spilled its anger on his own
crowd. Morgan said in a soft voice: "Stay here&mdash;don't follow."
Jump and Vermilye were here. Fox Wilting moved around the wall to
join them. Gale still clung to his own isolated position, wherever
it was, and Vance Ketchell was lost somewhere in the yonder
dark.</p>

<p>Jump murmured: "They're going to try something."</p>

<p>Powder smell settled around Morgan. A small, definitely cold
thread of wind hit his face and there was a telltale smearing of
the shadows in the open area by the far building. They were running
wide, Herendeen's men, and now they were on foot, firing as they
moved away from the dobe. Jump said: "I'm goin' after those
horses," and scurried forward.</p>

<p>Bullets squashed into the dobe wall beside Morgan, causing him
to shift slowly. Vermilye and Fox Willing had faded again, but
suddenly they were all answering Herendeen's fire and suddenly,
too, Harry Jump had stepped into a hot little fight over by the
Three Pines horses, colliding with one man left behind to hold
them. Morgan raced that way immediately, hearing Herendeen's crew
rush back to the horses. He was against the wall of the dobe when
they came in, and for a minute he was caught in the middle of it,
no man knowing who the other man was and no man daring to fire.</p>

<p>Horses plunged around him, knocking him backward; somebody's
shoulder hit him and then he saw Herendeen's men rise out of the
earth's massed darkness, into their saddles. For a moment he had
these targets to fire upon. A horse went down and a man cried with
a strong, fearful voice: "Hey, wait&mdash;wait&mdash;" The rest of
Three Pines had rushed out into the distant haze. Somebody groaned
at Morgan's feet. Gale's buffalo gun boomed again and in the desert
another gun began to speak up unexpectedly from an unknown source.
Harry Jump stepped around the dobe, saying: "Who's that on the
ground?"</p>

<p>The ruffle of Herendeen's horses diminished on the desert and,
standing slack and tired in the open, Morgan knew this night's
fight was done. He knew something else, as well. It was Herendeen's
crew which had given way, not Herendeen. The big man's mind, once
fixed, would never change. Harry Jump had gone over to the man on
the ground; he struck a match and killed it quickly. He murmured:
"Who the hell is he, Clay?"</p>

<p>Vance Ketchell called: "Lige's been hit."</p>

<p>Morgan went over at once. Ketchell knelt on the ground, his knee
propping Lige at the shoulders. Morgan said: "Whereabouts,
Lige?"</p>

<p>"Damned if I know. Ain't my belly and it ain't my lungs. I'm
just paralyzed from the hips down. What a hell of a turn. I never
got unlimbered. I made a run for that fellow and he cut me down
like a cornstalk."</p>

<p>Harry Jump called back from the near distance. "That was McGeen.
But he won't cut nobody else down. He's right here, dead."</p>

<p>Morgan stood loose on his feet, more and more discouraged.
Nothing was settled, and everything had to be settled. It went back
ten years and it had come to this night&mdash;and now it would go
on. He had his bad moment then, thinking of it; he had his savage
wish that Herendeen would come back to try again. Afterwards he
said: "Let's get Lige on a saddle. We'll go home."</p>

<p>Harry Jump returned, still puzzled. "Whut was that shootin' away
out yonder? Gale?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gale, making his first appearance since the beginning
of the fight. "I just climbed to the top of that wall and stayed
there."</p>

<p>"Funny," commented Jump. There was little talk left in any of
them, no feeling of triumph, and not much of regret; this was the
aftermath, dulling them. They lifted Lige White to his saddle and
waited to find if he could hang on. He answered that by starting
out under his own power, the others following.</p>

<p>Morgan drew back from the party, quietly calling Fox Willing.
"Fox," he said, "I wish you'd ride over and bring Mrs. White to the
ranch."</p>

<p>Fox cut away at once. The rest turned north, reaching Long Seven
an hour later. Coming into the yard Morgan saw Catherine in the
doorway. When he got down to help Lige White from the saddle he
turned to look at her again, framed as she was in the light, tall
and still and straight-shouldered; and he felt the tug of strange,
old excitement. Lige could use one leg only and had to brace
himself between Ketchell and Morgan. Catherine stepped aside to let
them pass, saying: "Put him on a bed, Clay," and followed the men
upstairs into an extra bedroom.</p>

<p>The room was dark and they had a moment's trouble getting Lige
on the bed. Morgan heard Lige grit his teeth together as they laid
him down. Catherine found a lamp and lighted it and by this yellow
glow all of them saw the whiteness of Lige's face. His hair came
down on his forehead and sweat oiled his skin; his lips crawled
back, forming a smile. "I sure as hell broke something. You know,
Clay, if it wasn't too much trouble, I wish you'd send for
Grace."</p>

<p>"Already have. I'm going into town for Padden. Vance, you better
get his clothes off."</p>

<p>Lige White said: "I guess you don't know the whole story yet,
Clay. Hillhouse cornered Hack and killed him. The man's a fanatic.
I'm warning you about that, if you should see him in town."</p>

<p>Morgan's eyes dropped. He stood like this, quiet and cold and
too weary to feel the full shock of the news. He said, after a
while, "I'll meet him, sooner or later," and left the room.</p>

<p>Catherine followed him, closing the door behind. They stood on
the landing, the girl's glance holding him there. He said: "We met
Herendeen and his crowd down by Government Valley. It was after
dark, or I guess things might have been different."</p>

<p>She knew what lay in his mind, she knew his temper and his
desires. She said: "Where is Ben now?"</p>

<p>"On the road home, I suppose."</p>

<p>She said: "I didn't think he'd run. But I hope he has."</p>

<p>"You know he won't."</p>

<p>"I suppose he won't."</p>

<p>He said: "Janet asleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Then she added, as though it might mean something to him,
"She asked me to fix her hair, Clay."</p>

<p>He turned to Janet's room. When he came beside the bed and
looked down through the shadows he found she wasn't asleep. She
reached for his hand, saying: "Who's hurt, Daddy?"</p>

<p>He sat on the edge of the bed, affected by the strange blend of
little-girl simplicity and worldly wisdom in his daughter. She had
a poise and a simplicity which frequently astonished him. Faced
with it now, he knew there was no wisdom in softening the
truth.</p>

<p>"We had a fight with Herendeen's ranch, Janey. Lige White was
hurt. I'm going after a doctor."</p>

<p>"Was anybody else hurt?"</p>

<p>He said: "Yes, Janey&mdash;but not our men."</p>

<p>She murmured: "It is too bad. But I'm glad it isn't you."</p>

<p>The pressure of her hand was warm and confident. She was pleased
to have him sit here and talk with her; it made her expand and grow
confidential. "I wish I had been here, Daddy, when you were young
and danced with Catherine. I bet you were the best dancer of all.
She is pretty."</p>

<p>"Wait till you get old enough to dance. I'll stand by and
remember when you were so small you walked under the table."</p>

<p>She was silent, seeing the picture of herself dancing&mdash;and
pleased by it; her lips softened and there was a glow in her eyes.
Afterwards, in a faintly reserved tone, she said: "She isn't like I
thought she was, Daddy."</p>

<p>"What did you think?"</p>

<p>"She likes me, Daddy. I didn't think she would."</p>

<p>He was, he realized, on the trail of something, and he knew he
had to be careful. "Whatever gave you that idea, Janey?"</p>

<p>In the following silence he at once sensed the fact that she was
struggling with her loyalty to Ann McGarrah. It was Ann who had
somehow put that antagonism toward Catherine in Janet's head. He
did not know why, but he recognized the fact, and waited for
Janet's answer. Thin and invisible thread though loyalty was, it
had the strength of steel; but somehow another invisible thing,
which was Catherine's soft, sweet personality, had broken that
antagonism, leaving Janet shy and unsure. She said: "I don't know,
Daddy. Do you like her a lot? As much as you like Ann?"</p>

<p>He said: "Maybe I do, Janey. I'm going to town now. Better
sleep."</p>

<p>Rising from the bed he heard her long sigh. "Will she stay here
tonight?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Maybe, if you want her to."</p>

<p>"I wish she would. I wish she'd come and fix my blankets again,
Daddy. It makes me feel nice. She's going to give me one of her old
dolls. I'm not too old for dolls at all. She kissed me&mdash;you
don't care if she does, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't mind at all."</p>

<p>She turned in the bed, her small body curled beneath the
blankets and her head sinking into the pillow. She murmured: "It is
like having a mother. It really is."</p>

<p>He went out of her room. There was a difference in women nobody
could explain, an understanding, or a touch, or some mysterious
fragrance of personality some had and some did not have. Catherine
had roused a warm dreaming in Janet, pleasing and comforting her;
she had revived in Janet childhood's abiding faith.</p>

<p>Fox Willing was in the room with Lige White; the rest of the
crew had left the house. Catherine waited for him downstairs, He
was thinking of Janet at the moment, more deeply moved by her day's
happiness than he realized. It showed on his face, for Catherine to
see. He stopped before her and once again these two were caught by
the strong undercurrent of things long ago said and done. They had
a way of covering up, by smiling, by showing sudden streaks of
gaiety. She said: "My boy, you are nothing to quicken the beat of a
woman's heart at this moment. You need a shave, and apparently
something to eat, and no doubt some sleep. You always get cranky
when you're hungry."</p>

<p>"Janet wants you to stay on tonight."</p>

<p>She moved around the table. She put this distance between them
deliberately, no longer smiling. "I can't do that, Clay. Not
now."</p>

<p>He said: "I keep forgetting it wouldn't look right to you. Well,
I don't know what you've done to Janet, but you did it."</p>

<p>She said with some concern: "You don't mind, Clay? I wanted her
to like me&mdash;and that's why I came. At first something in her
eyes scared me. Just for a moment I seemed to see Lila looking at
me and I almost turned back to go home. It is all right now. We're
friends and I'm quite happy about it. It was something I had to do,
and have wanted to do a long time, it's been that important, to me,
for my own reasons. Let it go like that."</p>

<p>He said, still in wonder: "How did you do it?"</p>

<p>Her eyes showed him a warm, deep shining. "She's still a girl,
Clay, wanting to believe little-girl things and live in the land of
make-believe. She knows those things aren't so, but she wants the
comfort of them a little while longer. And I talked to her as
though those things were good things, I told her I had been that
way&mdash;and that there were times when I was still that way.
She's been trying to grow up too fast, and I think I made her world
a little more simple."</p>

<p>"Wait until I get back from town and I'll ride home with
you."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of the ride, Clay." But she closed her lips,
color rising on her cheeks. She came around the table, giving him a
straight and swift glance; reading the tell-tale signs of this man
she knew so well&mdash;the tightness at the edges of his mouth, the
way his eyes showed darkness below the straight black line of his
brows, the stirring of emotions below the surface. She knew his
humors and his temper, she knew the things that moved through his
heart and mind&mdash;and the one faithful memory that never left
him and never permitted him to speak to her as he once had spoken.
For an instant she had the illusion that somewhere along the hours
the barrier had broken, but, closely studying him, she saw that it
had not. She shrugged her shoulders as she turned away and her
voice was indifferently colorless. "You don't need to."</p>

<p>"Hate to have you go alone."</p>

<p>"Then I'll wait."</p>

<p>Harry Jump joined him in the yard, but Morgan shook his head. "I
won't be long, and you've got to watch this place. Keep everything
close to the house. I do not know what Herendeen will do."</p>

<p>Jump had saddled a fresh horse for him; and now he lined out for
town along a road smothered by a deep moonshot fog whose thickness
touched him and seemed to break as he went through it. The lights
of War Pass didn't show until he had turned into the main street.
He went at once to Doc Padden's house, hailing him out. "Lige
White's in a bad way, at my place. I'll go back with you."</p>

<p>Padden said, in rough regret, "Everything happens. Wait a
minute." He went into the house for his hat and bag and walked down
Custer Street with Morgan. "You heard the latest? Hillhouse killed
Breathitt. He brought Breathitt into town and went out again."</p>

<p>They were near the stable when Morgan stopped. "In town?" he
said. "Go ahead, Padden, I'll catch up with you."</p>

<p>Padden said: "Hillhouse bought a quart of whisky and started
back to Three Pines. I guess it was on his soul, as God knows it
should have been. Billy Wells came in a few minutes ago. He saw a
team and wagon standing at the edge of Cache River near the
Cottonwood ford, so he went over to look. Hillhouse sat against one
of the trees. Guess he finished the bottle first. There was one
bullet hole through the tree and another through his head. He
killed himself."</p>

<p>Padden was a rough-handed man, made so by the kind of gunshot
medicine he practiced; but he had his moments of insight and now
walked to the stable without looking around. Morgan stood in the
street's dust until he saw Padden ride away, then he turned down
the street, left his horse by the hotel, and entered Padden's
office. A night lamp burned here, wick turned low. He screwed up
the light and took it with him into the adjoining room.</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was Charley's hat placed over Hack
Breathitt's face, and when he saw it he knew at once the hell that
had been in Charley Hillhouse's mind&mdash;his relentless zeal and
his memories of olden times confusedly mixing and torturing him.
This last small act of grace, the placing of the hat across Hack's
eyes, told the whole story of Charley's suicide. The wild and
bitter winds governing Charley had blown him at last out of
life.</p>

<p>Living or dead, the essential things of a man seemed to remain
on his face. It was so with Hack. The disbelieving, cheerful
insolence was still present, Born restless and full of scornful
courage, he had carried these qualities with him; wherever he was
now, Morgan thought, he'd be showing hell or heaven the same
half-gay and half-ironic expression. Maybe, Morgan added, it was
the best way out. For during these latter days he had seen a faint
disillusionment in Hack, as though the youthful freshness and the
strong appetites were wearing thin. Well, it was a new trail for
Hack now; he could travel it with the same gusty pleasure that once
had been his.</p>

<p>Morgan replaced the hat and returned the lamp to the other room.
On the street he felt the brush of air on his cheek, and stood a
moment in thought. These men had been close to him. Their passing
left an empty place, reminding him that his wish to keep his youth
alive was a futile wish. Suddenly, this part of the past was gone,
leaving him high and dry, and presently other parts would go. It
was a mistake to look behind, to try to hang on to what was over
and done with. For him it was a strange thought and a powerful one;
it pulled at his very roots and made him feel insecure.</p>

<p>He turned toward his horse. Jesse Rusey came from the shadows
near the hotel. He said, "One moment; Clay..." But at the same
time, looking across the street, Morgan found Ann McGarrah on the
store's porch. Her eyes were on him and, silent as she was, he felt
the pull of her will or of her wish, and so he walked toward
her.</p>

<p>Rusey held his position by the hotel, watching Morgan and Ann
McGarrah go into the store and close the door behind them. A light
came through the window, reflected from the back room of the store;
in a moment another door closed and this light died. Rusey rubbed a
hand across his chin. Distant in him was a faint envy at Clay
Morgan's opportunities, and a worldly man's curiosity. For Rusey's
philosophy was a gray philosophy, wrung out of his cool, perpetual
watchfulness. All people had wants. Some wants were little and some
were big; some came cheap and some came high&mdash;but to all
people sooner or later came a time when they placed their pride and
all that they believed in against the one thing they most wanted,
and made their decision. Usually they sold out. For in the world
Jesse Rusey so closely watched, wants always came first. He knew
what Ann McGarrah wanted. He knew her pride and her scorn of the
ordinary follies and appetites. Now he stood, rubbing his chin,
faintly amused that all these qualities had brought her nothing,
and knowing she realized it; knowing too she was close to her own
decision. He had his curiosity and shrugged his shoulders and
turned up the street. But he stopped again, still in the
shadows.</p>

<p>At that moment Herendeen entered town with the Ryder brothers.
Parr Gentry came from the stable and for a little while there was
talk between these men. Later, Herendeen went up the hill to Doc
Padden's house. A few minutes afterwards he returned to the group,
shaking his head. Parr Gentry pointed down the street and all of
them turned to stare at Clay Morgan's horse still standing by the
hotel.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>16. SOMETHING DIES, SOMETHING
LIVES</h2>

<p class="first">ANN MCGARRAH followed Morgan into the store's
living room. She came about and paused in front of him, quick to
see the rough usage he had been through. Always, in action or in
trouble, his eyes had a smoky coloring and this was present
now.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Clay. If you're hungry, if you want
anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, not right now. I've got to get back to the ranch. I sent
Padden ahead. Lige White's been shot. We had a brush with Ben in
Government Valley."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We drove him back. But nothing's settled."</p>

<p>She said: "You know about Hack? Of course&mdash;you came from
there."</p>

<p>He sank into the chair, his long legs pushed forward. She stood
near him, looking down. She put her hands before her, locked
together, and for a moment she had the expression of a little girl
on her face, half-wistful and half-stormy. She said: "You
shouldn't&mdash;you shouldn't. Suppose it had been you instead of
Hack? And when you meet Herendeen, which one will it be? You are
sure to meet. Everybody knows that. It is as certain and as brutal
as death. Well, it is death. Clay, is there anything I can say to
stop you?"</p>

<p>"No, not now, Ann."</p>

<p>"Not now, and not at any time," she added quietly. "I have never
been able to change you. Never. In any way at all."</p>

<p>He said: "Why worry about it? You know me pretty well. I know
you pretty well. Let's be satisfied with that."</p>

<p>She walked away from him. At a corner of the room she turned,
facing him oyer the distance. "What do you know about me? What do
you really know?"</p>

<p>"I told you once, and you didn't like it."</p>

<p>"When you said it, Clay, you never meant it. It was a
joke&mdash;and I hated you."</p>

<p>He shook his head, puzzled and gently amused at her. "There is
fire enough in you to burn up the town. You swing like the
weather&mdash;never still. You could be the kind of a woman, I
think, to throw furniture at a man when you got mad. You could
crucify him&mdash;if you loved him. And be sorry afterwards, I
guess."</p>

<p>"Oh, Clay," she said, "not a scold&mdash;not a spitfire."</p>

<p>"No," he admitted. "Just Ann McGarrah who wants things
perfect."</p>

<p>Her eyes grew darker and darker. "Clay," she said, near to a
whisper, "you don't mean to be cruel, but you are. If&mdash;" She
shrugged her shoulders, quickly changing the subject. "How's
Janet?"</p>

<p>"All right. Catherine came up to see her today." He watched
stillness come to her face, a listening intentness, a coolness
holding away her dislike. Then he said: "They seem to get along
mighty well."</p>

<p>She said: "Don't you want coffee?"</p>

<p>"Better get back and see how Lige is making out," he said,
coming to his feet.</p>

<p>She walked toward him. She stood in front of him, quite
near&mdash;this small, supple girl so intense and so crowded with
willful pride. She was dark, she was vivid; her lips were red and
firm across her oval face and he caught the fragrance of her hair
and was affected by it. Looking up, she drew a long, long breath.
He never was able to define the look he saw in her eyes that
night&mdash;it was like fear or shame, or like a woman forcing
herself over some obstacle she dreaded. Her voice was taut and very
slow. "It is hard to learn some things, Clay. Hard to learn that
sometimes nothing comes by waiting, or by praying. And very hard to
find out that a woman has to change as she swore she could never
change. All that I am is right here in front of you, but it never
has been enough&mdash;just to be in front of you. Is it something
cold about me, or something of an old maid in me? I don't know. But
only once did I ever see anything in your eyes that I put there.
That was when I wore a dress which left my shoulders bare. I was a
woman to you that night. Clay&mdash;I am not barren&mdash;not
ice!"</p>

<p>She lifted her arms. They touched his shoulders and lay there,
with the smallest pressure in them, pulling him. He saw her lips
lengthen and part, he saw her eyes widen, as though she opened
herself to him completely. Reaching forward he kissed her, catching
the force of her sudden-giving body. But even then there was a
difference, a strain, a lack. When he stepped back they both knew
it. She caught her breath sharply, turning away, And said in a
dulling voice: "No, not for me. Well, good-by."</p>

<p>He had nothing to say. Reaching for his hat he left the room,
crossing the darkened store and letting himself out to the porch.
Habit made him reach into his pockets for his cigarette-paper; he
rolled up a smoke without giving it any thought. He was like this,
sorry and confused and still stirred by her kiss when he heard
Jesse Rusey call out sharply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Heads up&mdash;heads up!"</p>

<p>That tone, from the silent Rusey, was a warning that made him
drop his smoke and jerk around. He saw, first, the two Ryder
brothers backed against the saloon wall, as though pushed against
it; and then, his glance racing on, he found Rusey in the thick
shadows by the hotel. Rusey had drawn his gun on the Ryders; he was
holding them there. Morgan knew at once how it was, and backed
against the store wall, sharply scanning all the roundabout
shadows, his nerves quickening and his pulse striking hard in his
neck. Swinging his head through a full half-circle he looked into
the gray deserted Shadows of Old Town and saw Herendeen slowly drop
back around the corner of the blacksmith shop into darkness.</p>

<p>He remained in his tracks, knowing what lay before him yet
puzzled that Herendeen should slide away as though avoiding him. He
knew Herendeen thoroughly&mdash;the raw physical courage, the
sullen will that drove him forward, the contempt he had for
weakness, the hatred which for these ten years had governed his
life and his actions. Thus this backward step into darkness seemed
out of character. Thinking about it, Morgan looked along the street
again and now noticed the shape of somebody outlined in a dark
second-story window of the hotel. He didn't know who it was but he
realized Herendeen had noticed the man and was protecting himself
in the fight to come.</p>

<p>For Herendeen knew the fight would come. This, Morgan thought,
was the way it had to be; it was something long foreshadowed,
long-awaited, and at last arrived. All his ambitions and all his
dreams of the future came this far and perhaps ended here forever.
He didn't know. The only clear thing was that he had to walk toward
Herendeen and carry out the pattern so long established. As he
stepped from the patch he had one great and final regret, which was
that if this affair turned out wrong Janet would be left alone. The
impact of the thought stopped him and he went down into his own
private hell, caught between his pride and his love. It passed away
in a moment, leaving him without alternative; this was how
hard-caught he was in the pattern, this was its inevitability.
Going on again, everything left his mind but the meeting which lay
before him and he felt a compensating coldness flow through his
body in quick successive waves. All images in the night were sharp,
all smells were keen and fresh, all sounds seemed loud. At the
corner of Ann McGarrah's store he made a short half-turn and passed
into the shadows. The main street was behind him with its lights.
He saw Herendeen waiting at the back edges of the blacksmith
shop.</p>

<p>Seventy-five feet separated them. Halted, he watched Herendeen
stir from the corner of the blacksmith shop, take a step forward
and halt again. The big man was a massive target even in the dark;
he was wide and tall, and now still. He said nothing and Morgan
said nothing. There was nothing to say. They had never talked much,
they had only stood against each other, through the years,
controlled by a dislike that came from something beyond their
knowledge, and the years had deepened that animosity until this
meeting was as natural as the drawing of breath. Waiting out the
moments, waiting for a telltale motion from Herendeen, Morgan
remembered one thing which took away whatever scruples or
compunctions he might have had; he remembered Herendeen standing in
the yard, ten years back, smiling at Lila. This was all. The
silence and the weight of the slow moments at last broke through
the thick insulation of this big man's heavy nerves, and he took a
sidewise step&mdash;which sent a small flash of wonder through
Morgan&mdash;and drew his gun.</p>

<p>Morgan, hanging to his tracks, drew and fired. He saw
Herendeen's gun kick up from its first shot; he saw the barrel
steady again. The roar of the shots cracked along the street and
somewhere men ran the walks recklessly. These were sensations that
reached him all at once, these and the crash of a bullet into the
wall behind him and the smell of powder. He had fired twice, still
watching Herendeen's gun settle to a level pointing. But he fired
no more, for he heard his shot strike home, releasing a quick small
cough from Herendeen. The big man's gun dropped; he fired as it
went down, the slug breaking up dust from the street. His shoulders
fell back against the wall of the blacksmith shop and scrubbed
along the boards. Morgan's bullet had knocked him back, and when he
fell it was this way, slowly to a sitting position and then
sidewise, as though wearily going to sleep. The shadows at the base
of the building smothered him; all Morgan saw was the vague stain
of his face.</p>

<p>The echoes of the firing had not yet died when men ran into the
street, toward Morgan. Someone called: "Clay&mdash;that you?" He
didn't answer, for he was paying his respects to Ben
Herendeen&mdash;a man who had never known what fear was, a man who
had waited for him, without trickery, to come up and end this
quarrel. That, Morgan believed, had been the single great force in
Ben Herendeen's life&mdash;his will to push aside, to destroy the
one person who had ever taken from him anything he had wanted. He
turned from the gathering crowd, walking back to the main street,
fatigue beginning to spread through him. It was deep in his bones,
it ran shallowly beneath his skin. Parr Gentry walked from the
shadows of the hotel and confronted him. Parr said, in a smooth
fatherly voice: "Well, Clay, I'm sure glad it wasn't you."</p>

<p>"Parr," said Morgan, "Vance Ketchell watched you go into the
Potholes yesterday and he watched you come out. You met Hillhouse
and spoke to him. After that Hillhouse went into the Potholes, and
found Hack." He had no feeling in his voice. The words were slow
and flat. "If you are still in this country tomorrow night you'll
be dead."</p>

<p>Parr Gentry brought a hand up across his mouth as though to
sweep something away from him; his eyes at the moment were small
and heavy-lidded, hiding whatever he felt. Then he murmured: "All
right, Clay, all right," and turned back on the street.</p>

<p>Ann McGarrah was at the doorway of her store, watching Morgan.
He paused in the dust, most of the energy and purpose out of him;
it was the faint push of an old habit which swung him around,
carried him through the Old Town to the cemetery, and took him to
the foot of Lila's grave.</p>

<p>In this dark silence she was close to him, she was very real.
Some things faded and some did not; her image was quite
clear&mdash;that dark, dramatic face with the light of laughter
veering so swiftly to the heavy shadows of despair and anger and
tears. Childlike and womanlike by turns; hating herself and hating
him for the mistake of a runaway marriage, and bearing it
tragically while the short year went on, and dying with no love for
him, no soft word.</p>

<p>The memory of this&mdash;the mistake and its
consequences&mdash;had bound him fast. Through these years he had
lived in the past, as though the past were alive, with always a
lonely man's wish that someday he might stand here at the foot of
her grave and see, in his mind, her face smile out an
understanding. This was his fancy, his wish; somehow to have her
understand that he had tried to make the mistake good.</p>

<p>But he remembered now a thought which had occurred to him
earlier in the night. A man could not live forever in the past. One
by one the links connecting him to it gave way. Hillhouse and
Breathitt, who had ridden beside him through these earlier years,
were dead. The sound of their voices was gone, their common
memories were broken. Now Ben Herendeen was dead in the dust and at
last, as he paused here in the wholly silver-shot fog, he felt
adrift and free. There was nothing left of the old quarrel, the old
fine times, the old adventures, the old songs. The last link of the
past had broken and he realized that he was, at twenty- nine, a man
looking ahead because there was no other way to look.</p>

<p>It affected him powerfully; it spilled something into his blood,
like a chemical absorbing the virus of an old fever. Looking down
at Lila's headboard he said, to her and to himself in a gentle
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I guess that's all. What's gone is gone."</p>

<p>He crouched a moment in the night's unreal glow, one hand
touching the headboard; and remembered her face then as he wanted
to carry it in his memory&mdash;vivid and young and full of
childlike pleasure&mdash;and rose and left the cemetery. He got to
his horse, unmindful of the small crowd gathered at the mouth of
the side street. Ann McGarrah still stood on the porch; she watched
him pass by. Lifting his hat he said, "Good night, Ann," and heard
her say: "Good-by."</p>

<p>He had been gone from the ranch nearly two hours. When he came
into the living room he found Padden ready to leave, Padden said:
"That wasn't as bad as it looked. Lige is all right. Mrs. Lige just
came."</p>

<p>"Where's Catherine?"</p>

<p>"Started home about fifteen minutes ago."</p>

<p>Jump came in. "I got the boys riding circle on the place. Fox
Willing's out on the flats, behind the rocks."</p>

<p>"You can pull them in. It's all over."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I met Ben in town," said Morgan, and left the room at once.
Jump followed him to the porch, calling: "For God's sake, Morgan,
tell a man..." Morgan curved around the yard and was lost in the
fog.</p>

<p>Lige White's wife stood beside the bed, looking down at her
husband. Padden closed the door definitely behind him as he left
the room. Now she said: "You were on the way to town, weren't you,
Lige? And then you changed your mind and started into a fight."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it was a way of passing the time."</p>

<p>"I know. Time's been heavy on your hands these last years. And
your house has been empty, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>He could smile, weak as he was. He still had his old flash of
gallantry. "No house is empty with you in it, Grace."</p>

<p>"You're lying, Lige. I know why you were going to War Pass. I've
known for a long time."</p>

<p>He laid a hand over his eyes. "I am not proud of that, Grace.
God knows I hate dirt. But there are things..." He didn't go on
with it; he had no way of explaining and so lay still.</p>

<p>She said: "This is the first time I ever saw you weak, the first
time you have been helpless. Most always you have been so well, so
full&mdash;and I've kept away from you. Sometimes you have
frightened me, Lige. Sometimes you have made me feel ashamed. I
have been a strange wife."</p>

<p>He said: "I saw a vase one time in a museum. It was a beautiful
thing. The sort of a thing that gives a man a wallop to look
at&mdash;to make him feel maybe there's a side of life he can't
reach. I didn't touch it. Was afraid I'd break it if I did. That's
you, Grace. I'm not complaining. I'm glad I've got as much of you
as I do have." Then he said, slowly: "If I stay off the path, it is
because a man like me belongs on the street, not in a museum.
Looking at beautiful things ain't enough. I've got to have
something to touch and use."</p>

<p>She showed the effect of his talk. It colored her cheeks; it put
something close to tears in her eyes. She was a graceful,
firm-bodied woman and even as he looked at her Lige White was
stirred. She saw it. She saw the things it put in his face, and
suddenly looked away. But a moment later she looked back, smiling.
She pulled her shoulders expressively up, the color deepening on
her face. "Always, Lige, you have come to me and always I've drawn
back. That's our trouble, isn't it? Well, Lige..."</p>

<p>She made a gesture with her arms, as though pushing something
away from her. She turned, dropping to the bed beside him. She
lifted his head and slid her arm around his shoulders and, this
close to him, showed him the long, straight glance of a wife who
was desired, and desiring. "I've been afraid of too many things, I
guess. Here I am, Lige, if it isn't too late."</p>

<p>Traveling westward on the trail to Dell Lake, which was also the
trail to Crowfoot, Morgan came suddenly upon Catherine's horse
standing riderless in the heavy-shining fog. This was at the edge
of the Mogul plateau, with the line of timber directly beyond. For
a moment he had his deep fear of accident; then, coming up to the
horse, he saw Catherine's shape against the trees. She had
dismounted and sat now on the yellow-dry grass, looking toward him.
He came before her, watching her face swing up. A moment later she
rose, walking to him. She said nothing at the moment but her hand
touched his arm and her face, pale and round in this light, showed
its intent, drawn interest.</p>

<p>He said: "Why didn't you wait?"</p>

<p>"I thought that perhaps something held you in town."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "something did. I met Ben."</p>

<p>She came nearer, watching the familiar marks on his face,
studying all the little signs she knew so well. So she knew what he
had done, and said: "It's over then. That has been my prayer for so
long&mdash;that it would be soon over. Go on back. There's nothing
on this trail I'm afraid of."</p>

<p>He said: "Why do you suppose I came?"</p>

<p>She seemed to hold her breath. He saw her long lips tremble. Her
shoulders straightened away from him. "Clay," she murmured, "say
nothing you don't mean. I can't go through that again. To be as
close as we were, and to lose it&mdash;I can't go through that
again."</p>

<p>He said: "There is nothing between us now. Nothing except the
things you remember against me, Catherine."</p>

<p>A long breathing sigh came from her. She was smiling, this tall
and robust and gay girl; she was near him, her body still. She
said: "Old times&mdash;new times. You have been a faithful man,
Clay. I have never ceased to love you for it&mdash;even when there
seemed nothing for me. Well, haven't I been faithful, too?"</p>

<p>She was there for him, she was waiting for him. When he put his
arms around her and saw her head lift to him, swift and expectant,
he felt the long rush of his youth again. When he kissed her it was
as she had said: Something old, something new. Nothing had changed.
The old wild sweetness was here, the same immense shock, the same
feeling of a deep need satisfied. It passed between them and took
the last loneliness, the incompleteness, the emptiness out of him.
The ten years of waiting were finished; they were together.</p>
