<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; ESCAPE</h2>

<p class="first">ONE moment he was a cool man who viewed his
chances for escape and found them full of risk; and then a night
wind moved over the river with its odors of dark soil warmed by
summer rain and the resin scent of firs and the acrid taint of
brush fires, and when these rank flavors came to him he knew at
once he was done with caution. He belonged to the land and the
land summoned him. Before midnight came he would go over the
ship's side, no longer caring whether it would be as a living man
or a dead one. He stood on the foredeck and laid a hand on a
capstan's bar, and excitement rushed all through him and sweat
made a dry nettle-stinging on his face.</p>

<p>The Bos'n was a short black shadow hard by the foremast
pinrail. The Bos'n said: "Pierce, come down from there."</p>

<p>This square-rigged ship, the <i>Panama Chief</i>, wound slowly
at midstream anchor, bowsprit pointed on the streaky glow of
Portland's waterfront lights two hundred feet removed. One street
lay against a ragged backdrop of buildings, beyond which the dark
main hulk of town ran back into a mass of firs rising blackly to
rear hills. All sounds travelled resonantly over the
water&mdash;the crack of a teamster's whip, the scrape of feet on
the boardwalks, the revel of a near-by saloon.</p>

<p>"Come down," repeated the Bos'n.</p>

<p>The ship's bell struck five short ringing notes. The moon's
quarter-full face dimmed behind a bank of clouds and the color of
night at once deepened so that the surface of the river became a
vague-moving oil surface into which a man might quickly drop and
quickly vanish. Pierce bent and unlaced his shoes. He kicked them
quietly off, moved to the break of the deck and descended the
ladder.</p>

<p>He went by the Bos'n, passed the galley and paused near the
mainmast shrouds. Mister Sitgreaves, the First Mate, stood
against the starboard rail and Canrinus, the Second Officer, was
in the same sentry position on the port side. The Captain was
above them on the aft deck, his cigar bright-burning in the
shadows. "Mister Sitgreaves," called the Captain, "come
here."</p>

<p>There were two named Sitgreaves on this ship, the Mate and his
brother the Captain. The Mate retreated and went scuffing up the
aft deck's ladder. On the amidships hatch cover the rest of the
<i>Panama Chief</i>'s crew silently and sullenly waited for a
break to come, hating the ship and its master and its
officers.</p>

<p>The Captain said in his bold, steady voice: "If any man tries
to jump ship, Mister Sitgreaves, knock him down. This crew is
signed from San Francisco to Canton and return. I'm no hand to
lose my men."</p>

<p>The Captain was afraid of losing his men, as well he might.
All of them, excepting the two Mates and the Bos'n, had been
shanghaied aboard at San Francisco by force and knockout drops.
There had been, Pierce remembered, an amiable man beside him in
the Bella Union saloon. The amiable man had suggested a drink and
presently he, Pierce, had died on his feet, to awaken on the
<i>Panama Chief</i> at sea.</p>

<p>"Bully boy," said a murmuring voice from the amidships hatch
cover.</p>

<p>The Captain moved to the head of the ladder and he stared
below him and gave the crew his hard, short laugh. "You'd like me
down there, no doubt, to start a confusion whereby you could make
your escape. I'll not please you till we put to sea. Then, by
God, I'll give you confusion."</p>

<p>On the hatch cover men softly and bitterly murmured. The First
Mate, Mister Sitgreaves, clanked down the ladder and took his
station again at the starboard rail. The Second Officer hadn't
moved from the port side, the Bos'n remained deep in the
foremast's shadows. All these men were armed, and it was six
months to Canton and back, by which time this year of 1863 would
be gone. The <i>Panama Chief</i> was no better than the
Confederate's prison at Richmond, of which Pierce had his
undescribable memories.</p>

<p>He closed his fingers around the rail and his body, lank in
the shadows, bent backward until all weight rested on the balls
of his feet. Mister Sitgreaves saw this and smoothly said: "I
wouldn't do that."</p>

<p>The men on the hatch cover stirred and rose up. Brought aboard
by violence, starved and bruised by iron discipline, they caught
the clear wild smell of freedom and suddenly all of them were
shifting softly along the deck. The Captain issued a sharp
call:</p>

<p>"Who's that by the rail, Mister Sitgreaves?"</p>

<p>The Mate said: "Pierce, sir."</p>

<p>"Knock him down, Mister Sitgreaves."</p>

<p>The Mate moved forward, his boots sibilantly chafing the deck.
Pierce let his arm drop to the cool round top of a belaying pin,
seized it from the bitts and took one quick side step. A sound at
his rear warned him that the Bos'n now was moving forward to slug
him and a man in the crew called out, "Watch back!"</p>

<p>The Captain roared, "By God, don't you know who's master on
this boat?" and came down the ladder in long jumps.</p>

<p>Pierce gave ground and retreated to the hatch cover, thereby
avoiding the Mate and the Bos'n who now joined shoulder to
shoulder and moved slowly at him. The crew shifted toward Pierce,
making a cover for him; faced with this unexpected resistance,
Mate and Bos'n paused.</p>

<p>The Captain said, "I'll show you how to handle mutiny, Mister
Sitgreaves," and came on, bold and black in the night. Some man
groaned, "You're done in, Pierce!"</p>

<p>Pierce gave ground as Bos'n and Mate moved at him, backing
toward the port rail. The Captain wheeled to block Pierce's way.
"You're a sea-lawyer," he said. "I am going to make you cry like
a dog."</p>

<p>These three, Captain and Mate and Bos'n, were pinching him in
against the galley wall. He wheeled and ran around the galley,
circling it to the starboard side, and reached the mainmast
stays. He had shaken Mate and Bos'n but the Captain had
outguessed him; the Captain was before him, softly laughing in
his throat. Pierce saw the Captain pluck a pistol out of his
pocket and lift it for aim, and all this while the steps of the
Mate and Bos'n pounded behind him. Pierce, never wholly stopped,
wheeled aside. He caught the flat explosion in his face and felt
the violent pain of his eardrums, and brought the belaying pin
down on the Captain's head in one sweeping blow. The next instant
he took his tumbling dive over the ship's rail, with a second
shot from another gun following. Deep under the water he heard
its echo.</p>

<p>He stayed under and drifted with the current until his heart
began to strike its hammer blows on his ribs, and came up to see
the dark hull of the ship slipping by. The water was half warm
from spring rain and bore the silt of a hundred valleys and hills
far away. He heard Mister Sitgreaves calling: "Lower the
boat!"</p>

<p>"There's his head!"</p>

<p>A bullet whacked the near-by water and sent him down. He swam
breast stroke until he thought he had cleared the boat
completely, and rose again. The stern of the <i>Panama Chief</i>
was an edgeless shape upstream. Mister Sitgreaves issued his
orders, very cold and very even, and the blocks of the davit
falls were squeaking. He heard the bottom of the lifeboat hit the
water. Mister Sitgreaves said, "Let go," in a softer and softer
voice. This man, Pierce remembered, was the Captain's
brother.</p>

<p>The current carried him downstream. Somewhere on the water
another rowboat traveled and a lantern bobbed close by the
water's surface. Pierce angled shoreward, feeling the down-
dragging weight of his clothes. He swam overhand, putting his
strength into his long arms, and as he swam he had a very strange
recollection of a shallow Virginia creek he had crossed two years
before under the fire of Confederate sharpshooters. All around
him the creek had run red.</p>

<p>Mister Sitgreaves had lost him. It was so quiet aboard that he
heard Mister Sitgreaves say conversationally: "Hold it, while I
listen." The pilings of a wharf stood before Pierce and water
splashed steadily from it to the river. He had the thick odor of
sewage around him as he cleared the wharf's end and put his feet
down upon yielding mud. A voice called from wharf to ship.
"What's the trouble out there?"</p>

<p>He faced a low crumbling bank and dropped into the wet silt to
fight for wind. The Mate's answer rode over the water from the
<i>Panama Chief</i>. "Man jumped ship. Where's your police?"</p>

<p>Pierce drew in a mouthful of water and spewed it out. He came
against the bank and climbed it, to face the played-out end of a
street on the ragged edge of town. Sheds and barns loomed before
him. The wharf was to his left and in that direction the main
part of Portland seemed to lie; a wagon rolled by, two men idly
arguing on the seat.</p>

<p>There was no more sound from Mister Sitgreaves and no further
inquiry from the watchman on the wharf. But as he lay flat on the
edge of the river bluff with water draining from his clothes,
Pierce realized the town was no more safe for him than the ship
had been. Sitgreaves would notify the police and the town would
be searched. What he needed was dry clothes, a meal and a quick
means of leaving Portland.</p>

<p>He moved away from the bluff, past the wharf and through
broken piles of lumber; he crossed the pure mud surface of a
street entirely dark and empty, pursued an alley not much wider
than wagon's length and found himself at a small, triangular
square. Across the square a saloon shed light from every window,
and beyond this saloon the main part of the town apparently lay,
hard by the river, its stores open even at this late hour. Along
this street supply wagons steadily moved. The name of the saloon
was the Oro Fino.</p>

<p>He left the alley and walked directly over the small square
toward the flaring lights of the saloon. A string of freight
wagons crawled out of the darkness and passed between him and the
saloon and somewhere a river boat whistled. Paused at the edge of
the square while the freighters rolled by, he observed a man ride
up and come to a halt before the string of wagons. He was in high
boots and rough clothes, he wore a shaggy beard and he had the
stain and the smell of a miner about him.</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Where's gold country around here?"</p>

<p>The man gave him a look and a moment's study. "Up-river. Away
up. In Ideeho."</p>

<p>"Just came from the California diggings myself."</p>

<p>"Hear they're played out. You look damp to me. You could stand
a drink."</p>

<p>"I am a little shy of company," said Pierce.</p>

<p>He had judged his man rightly. The miner's lawless spirit
instantly arose and prompted him to say: "Stay here and I'll get
you a drink." The string of freighters had now gone on; the miner
crossed the mud, dismounted before the Oro Fino, and rolled the
swinging doors aside with his shoulders.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a sharp dividing line in town. Before him
light glowed and warmth moved, regardless of the hour, while
behind him in Portland's quieter quarter the solid and
respectable citizens slept the sleep of the righteous. At that
moment Pierce heard a quick call and turned to find Sitgreaves
pointing at him. Behind Sitgreaves was the Bos'n and two citizens
who were undoubtedly police.</p>

<p>"That's him," said Sitgreaves.</p>

<p>Pierce wheeled across the square to the alley's mouth. There
was perfect darkness here for the length of a full block. Running
down the loose mud, he heard the halloo of voices and a command
from one of the police, "Hold up or I'll fire!" The alley played
out in the middle of the block, dissipating itself into a series
of between-building pathways and Pierce took one of these in full
flight, to arrive at a street all dark except for a corner house
whose lights shimmered on wet pools in the street's mud. He swung
close to the face of the buildings with the racket of the
pursuing gentlemen steady-continuing to his rear. He cut across
the mud to the far side of the street; he ran through the beam of
light from the corner house, and curved into another
street&mdash;and heard a woman's voice say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait!"</p>

<p>He came to a dead stop, he whirled half around to face the
dark side of the house. The woman was a shadow against the house
and he saw only the motion of her shoulders in these shadows.
"No," he said impatiently. "No, I'm sorry."</p>

<p>She came nearer. "I had a look at you when you came across the
light. You're wet." She put a hand against his chest and drew it
away. Back on the other street Sitgreaves' dead calm voice was
very distinct: "He went that way."</p>

<p>The woman said: "Come with me."</p>

<p>She went ahead of him at a light run, so that he had to
stretch his legs to keep up with her. Half a block onward she
darted behind a building and paused to catch his hand. "Careful
with your feet," she said, and led him on. Somewhere in the heart
of this complete darkness she stopped again, threw open a door
and pushed him into a lighted room. She came in after him,
closing the door.</p>

<p>It was a bare and worn and unlovely room with a stove in its
center, a counter in the corner, a clock on the wall, and a huge
man-shaped woman sitting unsurprised in a rocking chair. She had
iron gray hair and a tremendous figure and her eyes were
thoroughly unsympathetic as she looked at Pierce and read his
story. "Jumped ship, didn't you?" she said. Then she turned her
attention to the other woman and her expression changed, as
though she saw something she didn't understand. "What are you
doing in this end of town, Miss Castle?"</p>

<p>Pierce wheeled to have a look at this Miss Castle and met a
pair of gray-green eyes dead on. She had black hair covered by a
kind of shawl that women sometimes seized on the spur of the
moment for both hat and cloak. It sat like a cowl on her head and
came down about straight shoulders and a strong, rounded bosom.
The night had brought color to her cheeks and her glance made a
good job of investigating him. For a common woman she was well
gotten out in a maroon dress which came snug to her throat. A
cameo pendant hung from a fine gold chain about her neck.</p>

<p>The big woman in the rocker said: "Ladies never come here.
What kind of menfolk have you got to let you be such an elegant
fool? If you were seen you would be compromised."</p>

<p>Miss Castle shrugged her shoulders. "You have two fugitives
instead of one, Madame Bessie."</p>

<p>"How would a lady like you know my name?" demanded Madame
Bessie in clear displeasure. "And how did you know my door?"</p>

<p>"From my menfolk, of course. You're talked about over
Portland's supper tables."</p>

<p>"Is that what the best part of town talks about?" asked Madame
Bessie. "In mixed company?" She got up from the rocker and took a
lamp from the counter, and trimmed and lighted it. She was, when
she faced Pierce, both taller and heavier than he; she was a
formidable creature with a square jowled face and a bit of a
mustache. "Your menfolk ought to keep such things out of their
houses."</p>

<p>She led them down a dismal hall scarcely wider than her
shoulders and flung open a room's door. She put the lamp on a
marble-topped dresser and stepped back, again watching Miss
Castle with resentment. "I don't understand this. I shouldn't
permit it. You're a fool for being something you shouldn't be.
Usually it is money or a man that turns a girl. Your people have
got money enough. So it must be a man."</p>

<p>"We won't be spending the whole night here," said the
girl.</p>

<p>"That makes no difference," said Madame Bessie. "You are
compromised now. But I suppose it is the same falling from a high
place as from a low place." Thus far ignoring Pierce, she now
turned to him. "Be quiet if you hear trouble outside. Get out of
those clothes and I'll find some dry ones. All these ship jumpers
land here wet to the skin. You'll be getting the last one's
clothes. The next one will get yours. I'll take four dollars
now."</p>

<p>"Two," said Pierce, "is my stake."</p>

<p>"You think I do this for the fun of it?" asked Madame Bessie
sharply. "You can get out now. I won't be cheated."</p>

<p>"It's all right," said the girl. She produced a little purse
from somewhere and laid a half-eagle into Madame Bessie's waiting
palm. Madame Bessie gave the girl one look of scorn. "To go with
him is bad enough. To pay his way is worse. He'll use you and lay
you aside. Don't you know you can't buy a man for very long?" She
closed the door behind her with a harsh jar; her heavy body went
audibly down the narrow hall.</p>

<p>"Fugitives," murmured the girl, "can't be particular."</p>

<p>"Don't spend your money on me," said Pierce. "I have no way of
paying you back."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she answered, "a way will present itself. What is
your name?"</p>

<p>"Jeff Pierce."</p>

<p>"Mine is Diana Castle. You were shanghaied aboard ship at San
Francisco, I suppose, and made a break tonight."</p>

<p>"That's it," he said. "How would you know?"</p>

<p>"I saw the <i>Panama Chief</i> drop anchor in the middle of
the river. When a boat stays out from the dock it usually means
she's got a shanghaied crew. Men escape frequently from these
boats. It is an old story to us. You can hide here until your
ship sails and then walk abroad a free man. Our authorities are
not much interested in recapturing seamen for bully
shipmasters."</p>

<p>"For a lady," he said, "you have uncommon knowledge of the
hard side."</p>

<p>"I told you I was a fugitive also, didn't I?" Then she lifted
her hand to keep him silent; for there was the sound of men
suddenly arrived in Madame Bessie's office, and uncivil talk.
Pierce looked carefully around the room, saw a window and went to
it. He raised the window and put his head and shoulders through
the opening. There was an alley black as a tunnel running beside
this building; he drew back but left the window open. Out in
Madame Bessie's office a first class quarrel raged with Madame
Bessie laying her voice around like a club. "If they come down
the hall," said Pierce, "we go out this way."</p>

<p>It was her lack of excitement that puzzled him more than
anything else. She was, as Madame Bessie had said, a lady from
the proper quarter of town and had no business being here; this
cheap lodging house was for the other kind of woman. There were
only two kinds. This was the thing that unsettled his judgment of
her and made him resent her steadiness, as Madame Bessie had
resented it. Either she was too ignorant of this muddy side of
life to feel shame or she was a woman turning bad. He could not
really tell. She was a strong shapely girl with full red lips
firmly controlled and with a cool expression in her eyes. She was
sober, yet he had the idea there was a laughter in her which she
deliberately hid from him. On her left hand a diamond burned its
single spot of white fire.</p>

<p>The sound of bitter brawling died and the searchers apparently
departed. The girl said as an idle thought: "Madame is outraged
by my conduct. I have noticed that her kind of woman always has
the strictest sense of propriety. Why is that?"</p>

<p>"She knows what good and bad is."</p>

<p>"What is good and bad?" asked the girl. "Do you know?" She
gave him a sharp glance, she shook her head. "You do not approve
of me," she murmured and shrugged her shoulders. "I'm afraid it
will do you no good."</p>

<p>Madame Bessie came into the room. She closed the door behind
her and stood with her great shoulders against it, more
formidable than before. "They're gone," she said. "Now you both
get out of here."</p>

<p>"How about that change of clothes?" asked Pierce.</p>

<p>"No," retorted Madame Bessie. "I'll call no trouble down on
myself." She put both large arms across her bosom and locked them
together, and a clever thought came gray and sly to her eyes. She
turned on Diana Castle. "You're paying for this man's trouble,
ain't you? It will just cost you a hundred dollars to keep my
mouth shut. I could always call the police back."</p>

<p>Diana Castle said: "What has happened?"</p>

<p>"This man," said Madame Bessie, nodding at Pierce, "killed the
Captain in the fracas."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE SECOND
FUGITIVE</h2>

<p class="first">DIANA CASTLE stood before Madame Bessie and
watched the woman. She matched Madame Bessie's stare. She was
cool and she was very thoughtful. Madame Bessie said: "You can
get that hundred dollars for me, Miss Castle."</p>

<p>"You want to keep out of trouble, don't you?" asked the girl.
"What if I were to step out on the street and start screaming?
Suppose I said you had dragged me into your place? I think you'd
be in the penitentiary a long while."</p>

<p>Madame Bessie watched her a considerable interval, not so much
with anger as with a reluctant admiration. And she said finally:
"All right, Miss Castle. I guess you know what you want."</p>

<p>"Now," added Diana Castle, "could you get him some clothes?
And he needs a drink, Madame, and we are both hungry, aren't
we?"</p>

<p>Madame opened the door and cruised through it and turned.
"Miss Castle," she said, "you are too calculating for a proper
lady. Wherever did you learn to be smart?" With this, she
departed.</p>

<p>The girl walked to the open window, her back to Pierce, and
placed her hands on the window's sash. Her shoulders dropped and
became round at the points and then she came slowly about and he
saw that her face had a shadow on it. Her confidence was
momentarily broken, leaving her tired or weak or a little afraid.
He liked her better for seeing it. It took the calculation and
the chill out of her.</p>

<p>"Did you have to do that?" she asked in a small voice.</p>

<p>"When I made for the rail he came against me and fired a shot.
I knocked him down with a belaying pin and went over the side."
He shook his head; he made an odd motion with his hand. "Not to
be helped."</p>

<p>She was watching him and he discovered that she was afraid of
him for the first time. "What?" she asked in a distant voice,
"would you like me to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. You'd better go out of that window now."</p>

<p>She let out a sigh and moved toward him. She was almost
smiling, her fear vanished. "For a moment I thought I had made a
mistake in you. But I have not. You are not one of those
murderous Sydney ducks coming off a ship with your teeth broken
in, cunning and half inhuman." She paused, not quite through with
her thoughts about him, and added in a softer way, "I can still
hope."</p>

<p>He said: "Why should you hope?"</p>

<p>"Because I need a man. That is why I stopped you on the
street. You are to help me get out of this town. There are four
thousand people in Portland. I can't appear on the street or get
on the California stage, or take a boat, without being
recognized, A woman traveling alone in this country is under
handicaps."</p>

<p>"I do not know about that," he said.</p>

<p>She checked him in with a gesture. "You're in trouble and you
know nothing of this region. You cannot take any road from
Portland without being spotted in the back country. But I know
how you can drop from sight."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Do I go with you?"</p>

<p>"How do you go with me?" he asked.</p>

<p>She drew a breath and her pleasant lips came momentarily
together. She looked down at the floor and so avoided his eyes.
"As your wife."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not as my wife."</p>

<p>She said: "There will of course be no marriage. We must make
the best of it before people's eyes until we get to the place
we're going. Is it so much to ask? Are you already married?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. He moved back to the window and he stood there
watching the yellow lamplight shine in her eyes. She had a fair,
smooth skin and a round face pointed by a firm chin; she had an
enormous certainty in her, she had a positive will. What confused
him was that light in her eyes which seemed to hold back some
kind of laughter from him. In a way she liked this touch-and-go
business; it had an exciting effect on her. Madame Bessie stirred
heavily in the hall and time went fast on and he looked at her
and made this decision. "All right," he said.</p>

<p>Madame Bessie came in with a suit of clothes and a pair of
boots over one arm. She had a whisky bottle under the clothes,
and carried a pitcher of coffee and a loaf of bread in her other
hand. She threw the clothes on the bed and deposited the rest of
her burden on the washstand. "There's a miner from the Owyhee
dead drunk in one of my rooms," she said. "This is his suit."</p>

<p>"Give him mine in the morning," said Pierce, "and tell him he
fell in the river."</p>

<p>Madame Bessie nested both fists against her ample hip line and
scanned these people with her dismal experience of the world's
worst side. "You're a cool lot," she said, "the both of you, and
you want your way and mean to get it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Diana Castle, "we mean to get it, Madame."</p>

<p>"Mark me," said the Madame, "you'll get something else. You
will get hurt." She turned out and lifted her shaggy eyebrows in
faint surprise when Diana Castle followed her into the hall and
closed the door. "You start with modesty," Madame commented in
her tart, disbelieving voice. "You will end with something else.
You will never keep him."</p>

<p>"I don't want him, Madame. Not for long."</p>

<p>"So you think," retorted the Madame. "Cool as you are, you are
still a fool. The game you play will make you cry soon or late.
He will break your heart and you might break his."</p>

<p>"What game, Madame?"</p>

<p>"For a woman there's only two&mdash;money or a man. You have
money, so it must be a man."</p>

<p>"There's still another game, Madame."</p>

<p>"Is there?" countered Madame Bessie. She moved her massive
shoulders forward and laid her gray chilled stare on Diana
Castle. "I've seen a lot of girls start as you start. You know
where they are now? Up on the second floor of places like mine,
waiting for trade." She put her face quite close to Diana Castle,
darkly murmured, "Women are weaker than they think," and moved
heavily down the hall.</p>

<p>Pierce removed the cheap sweater and pants that had come out
of the <i>Panama Chief</i>'s slop chest and stood stripped in the
room's center, drying himself with a towel. He was lank-bodied
top and bottom, with long flat muscles; his ribs showed when he
lifted his arms and two bullet scars made white nipples above his
left hip. He had sandy red hair and a heavy-boned face, and his
eyes sat broad and deep in their sockets. His mouth was full at
the center, and habitually held steady. When he had gotten into
the miner's clothes&mdash;trousers and double-breasted blue shirt
and high boots&mdash;he said: "You can come in," and took time to
wash up at the stand.</p>

<p>She came in; she stood against the wall, waiting. When he
turned to her she noticed that he had the bluest and darkest eyes
a man could possibly own. They were penetrating and reserved
rather than friendly, and he had an alertness to his body motion,
as though keyed and cocked for the unexpected. He was thinner
than he should be and she had not yet seen him smile. She
supposed he was around twenty-eight.</p>

<p>He put on the miner's coat and took a water glass from the
washstand. He filled it half with coffee and half with whisky; he
tipped his glass to Diana Castle and waited a moment. She had
that smile somewhere behind her eyes when she said: "Luck." He
drank his coffee and whisky straight down.</p>

<p>He had been cold, and presently was warm. He broke the bread
with his hands and offered her half the loaf. She shook her head
and watched him eat. He had a ring on his small left-hand finger
that interested her, since it seemed to be a woman's ring, but
she pushed the obvious question away. He put his hands in the
miner's coat and pulled out a pipe, a letter, a small bullet
mold, and a buckskin pouch. The pouch, when he loosened the
pucker string, held three or four ounces of coarse gold
nuggets.</p>

<p>She watched him now with complete troubled interest. He looked
down at the pouch and hefted it between his hands, and laid it on
the washstand beside the other articles. "What's left of a large
bust," he commented. "Madame Bessie will probably see that he
never gets it." He went to his wet clothes in the corner,
retrieved his two dollars and put them in the pocket of the
borrowed coat. The girl released a held breath. "You're honest,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Up to thirty dollars," he answered, dryly. "What now?"</p>

<p>"The steamboat <i>Carrie Ladd</i> leaves the foot of
Washington Street at five in the morning for Lewiston. A thousand
miners come through here every month bound for the mines upriver.
When you get there you'll be out of sight."</p>

<p>"Neither you nor I," he pointed out, "will walk up that boat's
gangplank at five in the morning without being stopped. The
police will watch it."</p>

<p>"I know," she said, "but we have to get on that boat."</p>

<p>"Where's Washington Street?"</p>

<p>"Two blocks south of here. Then turn left and go two blocks to
Front."</p>

<p>"I'll go take a look."</p>

<p>She came toward him. She had her small purse in her hand. "As
long as we're together," she said, "this is yours."</p>

<p>He let the purse lie in his palm, feeling its heaviness.</p>

<p>"Maybe my honesty doesn't go beyond thirty dollars."</p>

<p>"I've got to take that chance, haven't I? When I left the
house tonight, I left for good. There's six hundred dollars gold
in the purse."</p>

<p>He turned to the window and had one leg through it when a
thought arrested him. He looked back to her. "You married?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Not that it would have made much difference," he said in the
same dry way. "But I have never run off with a married
woman."</p>

<p>"Otherwise?" she asked.</p>

<p>He gave her a good and sudden smile. "Or any woman," he
said.</p>

<p>The window let him into a pitch-black alley which he pursued
to a street bordered by little frame shops long since locked up
for the night. He halted on the sidewalk, listening to the
thinned-out voices of men drift over housetops from the
waterfront; and presently crossed the mud and advanced another
block and saw the flare of lights on Front. Keeping to the
shadowed walls, he moved toward the river and now began to pass
late-closing establishments whose lights made successive yellow
pools out upon the loose mud. There had been a driving rain
recently hereabouts, turning the air damp and sweet. Coming to
Front he put his back to a saloon for a moment's observation.</p>

<p>Directly across from him stood the Pioneer Hotel, and beyond
that was a dock to which a steamboat lay tied, pilothouse and
single stack showing against the night sky. Men trotted from boat
to dock, loading freight, and a barrel of tar burned on the
dock's end, its smoky yellow light darkly dancing on the river. A
line of waiting wagons bent around the corner of the Pioneer
House as far as the dock.</p>

<p>He was in poor position here, with men moving past him, in and
out of the saloon; and so he crossed through the line of wagons
and took position on the shadowed side of the hotel. A runway
tilted downgrade to the lower deck of the boat, and at the foot
of the runway a big canvas-topped wagon stood, its driver half
asleep inside a blue army overcoat.</p>

<p>"Hard sleeping," said Pierce.</p>

<p>The driver pulled himself awake. "Been here three days. Damned
boat is booked solid. I'll get on tonight, though."</p>

<p>"Coat looks familiar."</p>

<p>"Third Ohio," said the driver.</p>

<p>"First Michigan myself," offered Pierce.</p>

<p>"Ah," observed the driver, "it is a hard war, and a long one.
Buy your way out?"</p>

<p>"Wounded and discharged," said Pierce. "My wife and I are
trying to get upriver. There isn't any space."</p>

<p>"Be lucky if you get away inside of a week."</p>

<p>"That would be too late," said Pierce. "It is damned serious."
He came forward and stood close by the wagon. A heavy piece of
machinery crashed on the deck of the <i>Carrie Ladd</i> and four
men rounded the corner of the Pioneer and came to a stand behind
Pierce. He was in the shadow cast by the wagon, with his back to
them, but he recognized Sitgreaves' voice at once.</p>

<p>"We will watch this boat until it sails."</p>

<p>"Hard man to give up, ain't you?" said one of the others.</p>

<p>"Why yes," stated Sitgreaves in a steady voice, "I reckon I
am. I will get him tonight, or in the morning, or next week, or
next year. Let's try the alleys again."</p>

<p>The four departed. "Somebody killed," commented the driver
with disinterest. "Well, I guess we seen a lot of boys killed,
ain't we brother?"</p>

<p>"You've got a cover on your wagon," said Pierce. "If my wife
and I hid inside they couldn't see us."</p>

<p>The driver revived himself sufficiently to pack and light his
pipe. He lowered the match until he caught a clear view of
Pierce's face. He laughed easily to himself. "That's one way," he
said. But he gave Pierce one more sharp appraisal before he said,
"Come later when some of these lights go out."</p>

<p>Sitgreaves and his three partners were fading into the
darkness up Washington. Pierce moved back into the first
available shadows beyond the saloon and took station there,
watching the driver of the canvas-topped wagon with a degree of
suspicion; the man's gesture with the match was on his mind. The
driver settled down inside his big coat for a chilly rest and,
half an hour later, Pierce made his way cross town to Madame
Bessie's, let himself through the window to the lodging-house
room, and found Diana Castle sound asleep on the bed.</p>

<p>The strain of the evening had been greater on her than she
suspected. She lay curled on the bed's gray top-blanket, her arms
around her chest and with both fists doubled, and her face had a
softened expression, as though she dreamed of pleasant things.
Pierce pulled out the edge of the blanket and brought it over her
and stood back, and suddenly he was displeased both with himself
and with her. She had no right to want the things she seemed to
want. She was laying the false light of romance over her night's
adventure, she was touching the borders of an existence meaner
and harder and dirtier than she could conceive. She did not even
realize her present danger, asleep and unguarded in the shabby
room of an ill-reputationed rooming house, in the presence of man
she knew nothing about. She had too much faith.</p>

<p>He took a helping from Madame Bessie's bottle and stood with
his back to her, feeling the damp night air move through the
window. Far past midnight, the town had fallen asleep at last.
Deep silence lay on Portland, broken at long intervals by a
distant voice or the hollow knock of some lone traveler's' boots
on the near-by boardwalks. A plank squeaked in the upper part of
the house; he heard a body shift on the dry springs of a bed. He
ate the rest of the bread and drank the cold coffee and tilted
himself on the room's only chair. He thought of the dead Captain
with a slow pity but without regret, much as he had once thought
of those butternut-clad Confederate infantry who came running out
of the summer wheat fields in. Virginia and dropped at the crack
of his gun. Pity was something he remembered in a far-off
boyhood, never since recaptured; it was just a memory.</p>

<p>Long later he got up from the chair, observing that the black
night's square at the window began to tremble slightly with gray,
and touched the girl on the shoulder. "Time to go," he said.</p>

<p>She was up at once, frightened. She stared at him and her arms
came up in a quick pushing gesture; and then the shock passed and
relief softened her and for the first time he saw her smile. "I
would have been asleep in another moment. You weren't gone
long."</p>

<p>"You have been asleep for three hours," he said irritably.</p>

<p>She said in a little voice: "I don't ever mean to cause you
trouble."</p>

<p>"You have a good home. You have people. You have friends and
money and nothing much to worry about. You don't know what you're
getting into. It is like leaving a warm room and going out into
the rain. You'll never get dry again."</p>

<p>"So you have a conscience," she murmured. "But let's not
argue. If you hadn't turned the corner of this house a few hours
ago some other man would have. I would have taken him."</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "We go out through the window." He gave
her a hand through the window, seized the gray blanket from the
bed and followed her. It was still black in the heart of this
block but overhead the stars had lost some of their electric
brightness, and a thin river mist moved against them. Diana
Castle took the lead, reaching back for his arm, and in this
manner they reached the nearest street and went along it, their
footfalls running sharply ahead.</p>

<p>The remnant of a tar-barrel fire guttered crimson and black on
the dock&mdash;and the superstructure of the <i>Carrie Ladd</i>
traced a skeleton shape against the night mists. The girl
suddenly pulled him to a stop before a building's door. She had,
be saw, a letter in her hand and now bent and slipped it beneath
the door. Looking up, he noticed a sign that said: "Castle and
Tipton, Wholesalers." Diana Castle faced the door, and her voice
contained the first regret he had so far heard from her. "I am
telling my father not to worry. I am telling him that this is my
own doing."</p>

<p>Somewhere footsteps made a breach in the town's stillness. The
girl whispered, "That will be them," and seized his hand and led
him down a between-building gap. Fifty feet from the street, once
more in the sightless heart of a block, be pulled her to a stop.
Back of them, at the mouth of the opening, a lantern made its
diamond-bright flash, and men were talking.</p>

<p>"There was a racket up this way."</p>

<p>"She'd not be walking the street at this hour, Harry. It makes
no sense."</p>

<p>The first man's voice came back, hard-used and very tired.
"None of it makes sense. I'm going to knock on the door of every
house in town."</p>

<p>A third man added his word: "You have seen all her friends.
Now I should not like to offend you, Mr. Castle, or you, Mr.
Wyatt. But we must be practical about this. Was she fond of any
other man?"</p>

<p>"If you suggest that again I'll be forced to knock you down,"
said the tired voice.</p>

<p>They moved on, their steps long echoing back from distant
quarters, Light made a first thin pulse in the sky and the river
mists began to show clearer. "One was the marshal," whispered
Diana Castle. She had his hand again, leading him on through
quarters she seemed to know well. "One was my father. I am sorry
for my father."</p>

<p>"That leaves Mr. Wyatt," suggested Pierce.</p>

<p>"I'm not sorry for him," she answered. They came presently to
another street along which low-burning night lights showed out of
glassed shop-windows. The square edge of the Pioneer Hotel stood
directly to their right, and a man lay on the boardwalk wrapped
in a tarp, and the line of wagons waiting for the boat made a
black curve around the hotel's corner. The girl moved over the
mud to the farther walk. They passed along a building's side,
thus coming to the dock at which the <i>Carrie Ladd</i> lay and
softly groaned against the piling. A light burned in the purser's
cabin.</p>

<p>"What do we do now?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>The foot of the runway was near them and the teamster who had
been in the Third Ohio slept soundly on the seat of his wagon.
Deep in the hull of the <i>Carrie Ladd</i> iron fire doors
slammed and woodsmoke drifted in the heavy river air. Light
appeared from a window of the Pioneer and steam curled from dew-
damp housetops and back of town the Oregon fir forest began to
break through, silvered by mist. There was nobody at this moment
visible on Washington except the sleeping teamster. Taking the
girl's arm, he moved toward the Ohio man's wagon, pulled the
canvas open at the rear and gave Diana Castle a hand up.
Following, he found himself sprawled on a load of sacked
potatoes, with scarcely more than breathing room between the
potatoes and the canvas top.</p>

<p>The teamster, wakened by the motion of their entrance, put his
head through the front apron and withdrew it. Pierce heard the
girl say, "You are resourceful," and saw her face dimly near.
This situation would be uncomfortable and in some degree risky,
for although the canvas lay tight-lashed against the bows, all
down to the wagon box, there was an opening at the rear into
which anyone might look. He thought about this, and settled
himself half on his knees, shifting the potato sacks to block off
that view and also to create a space in which they might better
lie. He spread down Madame Bessie's gray blanket. "Yours," he
said, and watched her slide into it.</p>

<p>It was light enough so that he now saw her face. She wasn't
smiling but the effect of excitement was in her eyes, as though
she had far pleasanter thoughts than she wanted to show. "Thank
you," she whispered, "for being thoughtful."</p>

<p>"It is Mr. Wyatt I'm wondering about," he said.</p>

<p>The teamster left the wagon. Daylight came and the odor of
coffee drifted out of some near-by door and people began to stir
around the corner of the Pioneer Hotel toward the <i>Carrie
Ladd</i>; and presently the boat's whistle sent a great warning
blast bounding back through Portland. People tramped steadily
along the gangplank, and a woman said, half in tears, "Write,
won't you?" And over and above the growing confusion he caught a
voice that belonged to Sitgreaves. "You've gone through the boat,
cabin by cabin?"</p>

<p>"He's not on board."</p>

<p>"We will watch."</p>

<p>The girl touched Pierce's arm. She looked up and her lips
moved and he saw the steady brightness of her eyes; and once more
he got the idea that this was all something which pleased her in
a way that no other thing could. The Ohio man stirred on the
wagon seat and kicked off the brake; the wagon moved downgrade
and struck the <i>Carrie Ladd</i>'s deck. A boat's officer
shouted his constant orders and all round there was the rising
clash of voices on dock and on board, and other wagons groaned
across the deck. "Plank's in, sir!"</p>

<p>"Cast off bow and spring!"</p>

<p>The whistle flung out a second warning and bells jingled in
the <i>Carrie Ladd</i>'s engine room. "Cast off stern!"</p>

<p>"All clear astern!"</p>

<p>The deck trembled to the thrust of the <i>Carrie Ladd</i>'s
big Pittmans. The paddles slowly threshed and the nose of the
ship swayed as it turned into the channel, and out from the dock
floated a woman's voice, now openly crying: "Write&mdash;write
from Lewiston!" and a cheer went up from the passengers of the
<i>Carrie Ladd</i> and the whistle let out a final long hark of
farewell.</p>

<p>The girl's hand still rested on his arm; he felt the pressure
of her fingers and he looked at her and saw she wanted to cry.
She gave him a glance then he never understood, wide open and
crowded with strangeness and sadness and wonder. This was the one
moment when her self-control wavered, for she said: "Be tolerant
of me won't you, until we reach Lewiston? It is my father I'm
thinking of."</p>

<p>She was warm under the blanket, and the steady steaming sound
of the bow cutting water soothed her. She lay with her face
toward the canvas top, listening to voices on deck and to the
restless march of feet round and round the deck. It would be a
crowded boat, as all upriver boats had been since the discovery
of gold in Idaho and Eastern Oregon. Portland, which had been a
raw village crowded between the fir hills and the river, suddenly
woke to find the restless men of America moving in from their
mysterious origins and departing to the distant recesses of the
Blue Mountains, the Salmon River gorges, to the Bitterroots. They
came and had their day on Front Street and were gone, scarcely
more than shadows. This man beside her was one of them.</p>

<p>She said: "Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer. Turning, she found him asleep, his head
cushioned on an arm and his body awkwardly adjusted to the lumpy
potato sacks. After his flight from the <i>Panama Chief</i> and
his all-night wakefulness he simply dropped away from the world,
giving it no more thought. He was a clean-shaven man, now with a
day's stubble giving him a dark cast; but asleep he lost the
guarded alertness which was so noticeable on him. His life, she
guessed, had not been easy; but once he had been a boy, and
somewhere he had learned what manners and morals should be. His
convictions were very definite and very strong. Now he slept
dreamlessly and had no care at all.</p>

<p>She saw nothing of the outside world, but was familiar enough
with it to picture the great and high and black walls of the
gorge through which the <i>Carrie Ladd</i> moved; five hours from
Portland the boat nosed ashore and the wagon moved off to a
rutty, piecemeal road. Jeff Pierce stirred and said in a half-
asleep voice: "Where are we now?"</p>

<p>"We've left the <i>Carrie</i>. We're driving around the
Cascade Portage to the middle river boat&mdash;the
<i>Oneonta</i>. We'll be in The Dalles tonight."</p>

<p>He fell asleep again. The wagon turned down an incline and
struck the middle river boat's deck; and in a little while they
were under way, steaming through the great Cascade Gorge. During
the afternoon sun beat on the canvas top so that she grew warm
and felt the gritty dust of the potato sacks. But it didn't
matter. She was away from Portland, she had made the great break
of her life, and had long ago decided that whatever this new life
would be she would never complain. She thought again of her
father and sadness came back to her and for want of support she
put out her arm and let it lie on Pierce's chest, comforted by
the knowledge of his nearness. He had walked out of the night and
she had stopped him and had gone with him because she would do
nothing else. And then he had laid the gold pouch on the
washstand and after that she had been reassured. He disapproved
of her now for what she was doing, being in that respect as
strait-laced as her father; and because he was that kind of man,
he distrusted. He shared Madame Bessie's beliefs concerning
women&mdash;Madame Bessie who placed all women in two classes.
Madame Bessie was a sinful one, but she knew what goodness was;
so did this man know, and in him was one streak of tenderness
which had made him think of the gray blanket.</p>

<p>Dusk came and with it the smell of food; and darkness fell.
Pierce was awake and lay silent beside her, and somewhere in the
early night the <i>Oneonta</i> whistled and turned into The
Dalles landing. The wagon moved up a long grade and town lights
streaked the side of the canvas and there was music from a saloon
and rough voices cheerfully calling. Then the wagon stopped and
the Ohio man rapped on the canvas. Pierce moved the potato sacks
and crawled out, assisting her to the ground. They were, she
discovered, on a quiet back street.</p>

<p>The Ohio man said in a rather shrewd voice: "Both you folks
seemed a little shy, so I thought I'd unload you privately."</p>

<p>"I am grateful," said the girl.</p>

<p>The teamster nodded, and gave his attention to Pierce. "I
could make a good guess as to your bein' on my wagon," he said.
"But army men stick together, don't they?" He got on the wagon,
lifted a hand to them and rolled away.</p>

<p>Pierce moved to the street's corner and looked toward the
heart of this river town, He said: "What's next?"</p>

<p>"The Umatilla House is on that corner, We are halfway to
Lewiston, The upper river boat leaves in the morning."</p>

<p>He gave her a long, straight look. "I'll have to see about
space on that boat, Meanwhile we'll need a room and something to
eat. I expect we register as man and wife."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Yes&mdash;if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"It is too late to mind now, isn't it?" There was no
particular inflection to his words but as she took his arm and
moved with him toward the Umatilla House she had an unexpectedly
painful thought: His judgment of her character was unsure. She
wished it were not.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE WICKED AND THE
BOLD</h2>

<p class="first">THE Dalles' principal street paralleled a river
whose lava rock margins lay jagged and black in the quarter-
moon's light; and a soft wind brought in the balsam scent of a
thousand miles of pine hills and sagebrush desert, giving the air
a thin and vigorous pungency. Coming up to the Umatilla House
with Diana, Pierce observed the freight outfits loading for their
long slow run into the back country, and the shaggy shapes of men
who prospected the hills, and the sharp-eyed and half-wild
cowhands in from distant ranches. Indians&mdash;these of the
proud and intractable Plains tribe, so different from the
slovenly fish-eaters of the Coast&mdash;stood by the hotel wall,
and army men roamed by in their dusty blues. Pierce and Diana
Castle made way to the desk through a crowd of citizens and boat
passengers. Pierce said: "A room for myself and wife." A neat,
grave man dressed in black broadcloth and white shirt turned from
the desk and slightly collided with Diana, and was quick to lift
his hat in apology.</p>

<p>"There's been some confusion," Pierce said as he signed the
register. "We have lost our luggage and my wife is considerably
fatigued. Could you bring up a meal?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the clerk, and handed Pierce a key. "Four, Up the
stairs."</p>

<p>Pierce walked as far as the stairway, there handing the key to
Diana. "I'll see about passage," he said, and turned back through
the crowd to the street. Rain had dropped here recently but there
was no mud underfoot; the fine powdered soil of the street
glittered by lamplight and would make, in another dry day, a
steady pall of dust. An auctioneer stood on a box beside a tar
flare calling up customers in a tireless voice and a woman came
against him and looked at him with a laughing face. He stepped
into the office of the navigation company, near the hotel, took
place in line and eventually found himself at the counter, Beside
him was the grave and neat man who had lifted his hat to
Diana.</p>

<p>"Passage to Lewiston for two," said Pierce to the clerk,</p>

<p>"Thirty dollars," said the clerk.</p>

<p>"My wife is in poor health," added Pierce. "This includes a
decent stateroom?"</p>

<p>"All gone," said the clerk. "You are buying deck space, and
not much of that. It will be a full list inside of half an
hour."</p>

<p>The neat man had been listening. Now he said: "If your wife
does not mind sharing a stateroom with my daughter, I should be
happy to accommodate you."</p>

<p>"That is handsome," said Pierce. "We will see you in the
morning. Pierce is my name."</p>

<p>"Temperton," offered the man. "Will Temperton." He was
courteous but he did not extend his hand. Pierce paid for two
passages upriver and moved aside, hearing a woman's voice attack
the clerk with a good-natured malice. "One up-river. I wouldn't
consider it much of a treat to sit in one of your ratty little
staterooms. Your bosses are making too much money for their own
good. They're greedy, Neall."</p>

<p>"Hello, Lil Shannon," said the clerk. "Still, what other way
could you get to Lewiston?"</p>

<p>"I can walk or I can ride," retorted the woman. "I can do both
better than your stuffed Portland capitalists, my friend."</p>

<p>She was a woman with a rose-complexioned face, smiling and a
little bold, and dressed on the high side of taste. She was his
own age, Pierce judged, and knew as much of the world as he did.
She turned her head with a rather swift gesture and met his
attention. Her eyes were hazel and ready to be amused and he saw
that she was accustomed to meeting the glances of men. She looked
at him with a moment's steady interest; he bent his head slightly
and left the office. The ticket line had lengthened and now
stretched halfway back to the corner of the Umatilla House; and a
man in line said: "That Lil Shannon in there?"</p>

<p>Pierce returned to the barroom of the Umatilla House and
pressed through the thick crowd. All the talk about him concerned
the mining camps of Burnt River, the Blue Mountains and the
Owyhee, and Elk City and Florence; the smell of gold was in the
smoke and whisky reek of the room. He got to the bar and bought a
drink. He stood idle and solitary with the crowd moving around
him and had hot beef and beans and bread off the steam table and
he bought a cigar and got it properly burning, meanwhile watching
the gold scales on the bar tip to the dust poured out of miners
pokes.</p>

<p>"Nothing down Powder River. Elk City's playin' out. There's a
new strike on over beyond the Grasshopper diggin's, in Alder
Gulch."</p>

<p>"Where's that, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Up the Clearwater, beyond the Bitterroots, other side of
Bannack."</p>

<p>He heard this talk but paid little attention to it, for his
mind went back to Portland to review the scene aboard the
<i>Panama Chief</i>. The Captain had meant to kill him and the
Captain's voice had betrayed a tone of pleasure. He remembered
the sound of the belaying pin on the Captain's skull and the way
the Captain's mouth sprung wide open, and all during that time
the smell of land had rolled over the water, rich and thick and
racy with the freedom he had to have. There had been a black
streak in the Captain.</p>

<p>Somebody said "You're in my way," and drove a shoulder point
hard against his arm. The cigar, lightly held between his teeth,
flew from his mouth and hot ashes sifted back to his face. He
made a complete turn and came about and saw a man's square, sun-
black face stare up from beneath the flat brim of a hat. He
looked straight into a pair of mud-gray eyes and noticed temper
move in spongelike contractions across this man's full-centered
lips.</p>

<p>He waited a moment. He said, almost gentle with his words: "An
accident?"</p>

<p>"You can do your sleeping somewhere else, can't you?" said the
man.</p>

<p>Men crowded behind Pierce. He pushed his shoulders backward to
relieve that pressure and he pulled up both arms and batted the
man with his open left palm and hit him on the chest with his
right fist. The man went backward into the crowd, into the arms
of a tall fellow wearing a mustache and goatee. The tall one
clenched and showed his big white teeth in a smile as he caught
the falling man. He said, wickedly easy with his words: "There's
your meat, Rube, go after him."</p>

<p>Rube struggled out of the arms of the tall one. He was short
and broad and sweat rushed a thin glistening film over his sun-
blackened cheeks. He was speaking to himself as he moved forward;
and he lifted the point of one shoulder, as though to cock his
fist. Pierce shoved himself clear of the bar. He hit this
muscular, slow Rube in the belly and drove the wind out of him.
He waited until Rube's head dropped and thereafter caught him
fully on the temple. Rube went down to the floor.</p>

<p>Pierce said: "I don't like to be crowded. Keep your hands out
of your pocket." Then he looked up to the tall fellow with the
goatee who still smiled. He said nothing but he watched that
smile as wickedness honed it thin. The tall one had a fresh,
light skin and a set of agate eyes in which brightness danced;
and small wrinkles deepened at the corners of his temples, and he
seemed to be laughing deep in his chest.</p>

<p>Rube rolled and stood up. He shook his head and he looked at
the tall fellow with the goatee. "What'll I do, George?"</p>

<p>"Why," said the tall George, "nothing more along that line, I
guess." He inclined his head at Pierce. "You're handy with your
fighting, brother. If I wasn't full of supper I'd take you on for
a set."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Pierce.</p>

<p>"Just for fun," answered the tall one. "I think I could do you
in." His smile was constant and winter-chilly. Light kept dancing
oddly on the gray-green surfaces of his eyes. He had a streak in
him, Pierce saw&mdash;a pure wild streak which registered at the
down-slanted corners of his lips.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," said Pierce. "I'm going upriver."</p>

<p>"My name is Ives," said the man, "George Ives"&mdash;and he
waited, as though the name might remind Pierce of something. When
he saw it did not, he added: "I'll talk with you on the
boat."</p>

<p>"If you bring a fight," said Pierce, "bring a good reason with
it."</p>

<p>"Fighting's reason enough," said George Ives, "Just the fun of
it, friend."</p>

<p>"Not the way I fight," answered Pierce. "There's no fun in
it."</p>

<p>"All right," murmured Ives, and touched his short, dull
partner on the shoulder. These two left the barroom.</p>

<p>Pierce returned to the bar and bought a fresh cigar, and took
time to light it; and strolled to the lobby. The night turned
better though he did not know why; he felt clean and at ease.</p>

<p>He crossed the lobby to the stairs, noting that Rube and Ives
had disappeared. At the foot of the stairs, he found a redheaded
young man idly waiting for him. The redhead smiled. "Ketchum and
Ives usually stick together. Those names don't mean anything to
you? Well, if you go to Lewiston, don't consider this deal
closed." He was high and robust and indolent, he was a character
who seemed delighted simply to be alive and a spectator to the
odd maneuverings of the world. "One other thing," he added,
"close up your guard when you scrap. A trained pug would have
knocked your head off whilst you were pullin' that punch forty
miles up from your socks." He strolled away, whistling between
his teeth.</p>

<p>Pierce climbed the stairs and went down a hall to Number Four
and knocked; and entered the room on hearing Diana Castle's
voice. She stood at the room's window and had apparently been
looking into the street. When she came around he saw loneliness
on her face. She gave him a glance that he had come to expect
from her, long and thoughtful and deeply interested, as though
she tried to reassure her faith in him. For his part, he was ill
at ease.</p>

<p>"I have the tickets. The boat leaves at five-thirty." He moved
around the room, noting the narrow bed and the four walls, and
growing more irritated with himself. "I'll stand out in the hall.
When you're in bed&mdash;and the light's out&mdash;I'll come in
and sleep on the floor."</p>

<p>She said: "You don't like it, though."</p>

<p>"No," he agreed instantly, "I don't. I keep thinking of where
you came from and of what you're throwing away. I keep thinking
of your dad." He turned full at her and he walked forward, and he
did a thing so wholly unlike him that he had his own great marvel
at it. Her soft fragrance slid through the armor of his self-
sufficiency and he reached out and lifted her chin with his hand.
He saw a quick flare of fear answer him and dropped his hand at
once, once more embarrassed and irritated. "When a good man comes
to you, what will you tell him about Madame Bessie's house, and
this room tonight?"</p>

<p>"A good man would understand, wouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"There is no man that good."</p>

<p>"What have I done wrong?"</p>

<p>It was&mdash;and he struggled with the thought and could find
no simple answer&mdash;the rebellion which made her break old
ties and old standards and surrender security and gamble with
man's respect. It was the willingness to do this that made the
wrong. But he could not properly say it, and so stood still,
shaking his head. Diana Castle said it for him with her brief,
quick words.</p>

<p>"It is a man's world. You lay down the rules. You make our
places for us, in which we are supposed to stay. You have the fun
and then you come home to us and we are your audience, properly
grateful for the secondhand warming of what the outside world
looks like. Don't you suppose a woman can be hungry for the ugly
and raw and dangerous part of living&mdash;the real part? You're
not afraid of discomfort or misery, you don't feel that the mean
and evil things through which you pass leave a stain on you. Why
should they leave a stain on me?"</p>

<p>He said "I do not know," and left the room. He stood outside
until he heard her call, and went back into the room. The light
was out and night's thin wind blew through the opened window. She
had put a blanket on the floor for him. He rolled himself into it
and lay long awake, hearing the soft rise and fall of her
breathing and unable to make up his mind about her. "Good night,
Jeff," she said.</p>

<p><br> They ate in the dining room of the Umatilla House at
four, with daylight gray at the windows and soon after were in
the small train which ran fifteen miles around the unnavigable
rapids to the landing at Celilo where the upper river boat
<i>Tenino</i> waited. Going aboard, Pierce and Diana Castle stood
on the cabin deck and watched the crowd distribute itself. Lil
Shannon walked aft with her free and easy manner; she bracketed
Pierce and Diana with a glance and moved in a rustle of silks
toward the lady's parlor. In a moment Will Temperton came forward
with a little girl of about ten. He lifted his hat at once to
Diana and bowed when Pierce said: "My wife, Mr. Temperton."</p>

<p>Will Temperton had a grave, soft voice and he made a ceremony
of introducing his daughter. "Lily Beth, may I present Mrs.
Pierce. And Mr. Pierce. The cabin is at your disposal, of
course." He led, them aft along the narrow passageway between
rail and deck structure until he reached the proper stateroom and
opened the door.</p>

<p>Diana said: "Lily Beth, do you mind too much?"</p>

<p>Lily Beth lifted a guarded glance. "I don't mind," she said
passively. Will Temperton watched his daughter with a degree of
helplessness. The man, Pierce thought, was somebow at once
outside all this, powerless to step in. But Diana Castle's voice
came pleasantly into the strain of the silence. "Perhaps I could
help you with your hair and your clothes. Men don't know a great
deal about those things."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lily Beth. "Yes, thank you."</p>

<p>These two went into the stateroom and Pierce turned to notice
that Temperton appeared immeasurably relieved. "Your wife," said
Temperton, "is kind."</p>

<p>"Some things a man can't do," suggested Pierce.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Temperton. Then he added with an irritable
frankness: "It is a fiction that a man has less affection for his
daughter than his mother. A damned fiction trumped up by&mdash;"
He checked himself, gave Pierce a curt bow and went down the
deck, disappearing into the saloon.</p>

<p>There was some wrangling at the landing and Pierce bent over
the rail to find a middle-sized freckled individual of his own
age arguing calmly with the purser who blocked his forward
progress on the gangplank.</p>

<p>"The boat is full up. You must wait until Thursday."</p>

<p>"No," said the man, "that is too late. I mean to take this
boat. It don't look full up to me."</p>

<p>"You're questioning my word, sir?" said the purser.</p>

<p>"Why not at all," replied the freckle-faced one. "Accordin' to
your lights the boat is full. Accordin' to mine it ain't. I see
space where a man could stand."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the purser. "Step ashore."</p>

<p>But the freckle-faced one stuck to his position. "A boat's
never full. Why, I could sit on top of that wagon. Room for six
people on it."</p>

<p>"Step ashore," insisted the purser. "You are delaying
departure."</p>

<p>"Another passenger is another fifteen dollars, ain't it? Your
company is in business to make money, I'd guess. What would the
agent in Portland think of a purser that didn't look to the
company interests?"</p>

<p>The Captain put his head through the pilothouse window high on
the ship and let forth a blast of language. "By God, Mr. Wynkoop,
haul up that windy debate! Let him on or knock him
overboard."</p>

<p>The young man stood fast, resisting both refusal and a
quarrel. He was single-minded on the subject. He would not grow
angry and he would not back up and so he stood doggedly still and
cheerfully eyed the purser. He pointed a finger at the ship's
upper deck. "Lots of space up there. Just look around and see for
yourself."</p>

<p>The purser meanwhile had reached his own conclusions and now
shrugged his shoulders and retired to the boat, the young man
following him aboard. Deckhands hauled in the gangplank, the
Captain vented a whistle blast into the brightening morning and
the <i>Tenino</i> sheered out to midstream.</p>

<p>Pierce took position under the pilothouse wall. Sunlight moved
low from the east and the day grew moderately warm. Left and
right the black walls of the Cascade Range sank into dun-colored
grasslands; and far ahead the silver surface of the river moved
between the emptiness of a sagebrush plain. Here and there on the
shore line an Indian camp occasionally lay. Blue haze slowly
threaded the horizons. Near midmorning the <i>Tenino</i> rounded
a bend to sight a cavalry detachment moving along a ridge, the
shapes of men and horses silvered by a rising, sun-shot dust. At
noon Diana Castle joined him. "It is time to eat&mdash;and now
we're free." Then she gave him a quick look. "But you wouldn't
understand that because you have always been free." They moved
aft toward the dining room. She looked up to him as if to see how
he received her remark, and changed the subject. "Lily Beth is a
nice child. But some kind of trouble has locked her tongue. She
looks at me as though she dared not be herself."</p>

<p>After noon meal they moved to the forward end of the cabin
deck and watched the river turn through shallow rapids and
straighten again to straight calm channels. The pulse of the
engine was a hard, constant heartbeat through the ship. Far-
distant hills showed blue behind the haze. "Over there," said
Diana, "is Idaho, and the mines. Will you be prospecting?"</p>

<p>"I expect. I put in a year in the California mother-lode
country."</p>

<p>"I don't seem able to picture you bending beside a creek with
a pan. Your star is a troubled one. You have little faith in the
world and almost no trust in any person." She looked up to him.
"People are all better than you think."</p>

<p>"Not where you are heading for," he said.</p>

<p>She said: "I guess I owe you an explanation. It was the third
man, Jeff."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyatt?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyatt, who someday will be a very powerful man. In his
own way he is harder than you, for he wouldn't lend himself to
the weakness of picking a strange woman off the street as you
did. He would have said: 'Move on, girl, or I'll have you run
in.'" But she immediately added in a distant voice: "Of course he
would first have looked to see if she was pretty. Had she been
quite pretty&mdash;"</p>

<p>Temperton and Lily Beth rounded the forward wall of the cabin
deck. Temperton would have continued on with Lily Beth, but she
paused of her own motion and stood at the rail beside Diana. It
was only a small gesture yet Pierce noted a veiled expression of
defeat come to Temperton. He said in his grave voice: "You'd like
to stay with Mrs. Pierce, Lily Beth?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Temperton moved away and in a moment Pierce strolled aft and
ducked into the saloon for a cigar. The bar was crowded three-
deep and smoke boiled from wall to wall and all the gaming tables
were surrounded. Pierce got his cigar, meanwhile noticing both
Ketchum and George Ives in another corner of the saloon; and
through a temporary gap in the crowd he discovered Tempertonat
one of the tables. When he saw that grave face and that
immaculate figure thus engaged he knew at once the man's
occupation. Ternperton was a gambler.</p>

<p>He stepped out of the saloon's reek and fell in step with a
giant of a young lad who smiled on him and seemed anxious to
talk. "I hear there's plenty of gold," said the young fellow. "I
never mined before. Some particular way of going about it, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"There's a matter of luck in it," said Pierce. "If you know
nothing about it, day labor work will make you rich a good deal
faster."</p>

<p>"Anna said that," agreed the young man. "She said I wasn't the
fellow to be lucky. I was the one, she said, to take a sure job.
I guess she hated to see me leave Buffalo."</p>

<p>"Who's Anna?"</p>

<p>"The girl I'm going back to marry when I make my stake. I'm
Nick Tibault."</p>

<p>"Don't stay away from Anna too long," said Pierce, and drifted
on. A crowd stood on the afterdeck, watching a very old man
methodically put three shots into a piece of driftwood near the
shore. The redhead lay on the deck, soaking up sunlight, and
grinned as Pierce arrived. Pierce squatted on his heels and
swapped talk for half an hour or more while the paddles churned
out a steady roar and the boat ceaselessly swung with the
channel, like a hunting dog scenting out a trail. The redhead had
an amused flow of conversation, a wry and skeptical view of life.
His name, it developed, was Ollie Rounds. Other than that bit of
information, he revealed nothing of himself. His words made a
screen.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on and sunset flung a bitter brilliance
along the water. At supper Pierce met Diana and ate with her, and
stood awhile in the twilight. Temperton presently arrived with
Lily Beth and Pierce left her and found a place to sleep behind
the bulwark of the pilothouse. He did not see her again until
late dusk the following day when, with the journey almost
through, they took place at the forward railing of the upper deck
and watched lonely settlers' lights wink along the shore.</p>

<p>"What will you do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But you're through with me when we step ashore.
It was luck to find you. I won't forget. What are your plans? Or
maybe I shouldn't ask. That's the rule, isn't it, on the
frontier? Never ask questions."</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>There was the briefest of twilights, so that one moment it was
half dark and one moment thereafter full dark. He heard her soft
laugh. "Well; we're footloose. You will not starve. You will
always find something and so will I."</p>

<p>"You can pick your ticket. Women are scarce in this country.
Whenever you speak there'll be a dozen men to jump."</p>

<p>She said: "I wish you wouldn't be harsh." She gave him a
steady look through the darkness. "Why should it matter to you at
all?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it shouldn't matter at all. Everybody's got a
life to live. Root hog or die. Take care of yourself and watch
the other fellow to see he doesn't trick you. That's about all of
it. I wish you luck."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you really don't. You think I have thrown
everything over. You have your idea of what a good woman should
be and you dislike me for spoiling the idea."</p>

<p>Far upriver a cluster of lights broke the black. He was
thinking of her with a disappointment that astonished him. It was
feeling that had no proper place in him. She should mean nothing
to him, yet she did.</p>

<p>She faced him and touched his arm. "I didn't tell you about
George Wyatt. I was to have married him. That's why I ran away.
Do you understand now?"</p>

<p>"You could have refused him easily enough, couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I guess you don't understand. My father wished it, and all
the relatives wished it. It would have joined two families and
two firms. I liked him, but not enough. And still, I wondered if
it wouldn't be sensible to put all strange things out of my head
and be what everybody wanted me to be. It was very easy to be
agreeable, Jeff. That's what frightened me. It was easier to
marry him and be a pleasant lady than to run out in the rain and
wait by Madame Bessie's house for help to come along." She fell
silent, watching the outline of his face in the river dark. She
held his arm, making him look at her; and he felt the swirl and
rush of her feelings, the tempest which was having its way with
her. "When a woman does the agreeable thing, half-heartedly for
the sake of propriety and comfort, she is no better than Madame
Bessie," she said. "There's such a thing as feeling that the
years are going by, leaving you lost behind. I have never watched
a boat go upriver without thinking I should be on it. And so I
got on the boat. That's all."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "not all. What will you do?"</p>

<p>She dropped her hand and turned from him; and her hand made a
little dismissing gesture and her voice was cooler than the
night, and far away. "We're almost in." She turned from the rail
and as he followed he had the sense that he had failed her.</p>

<p>They moved to the main deck and stood by as the <i>Tenino</i>
blew for Lewiston and drifted half-speed to the landing. Rows of
lights lay along a bluff and tar barrels burned at the landing
and people came down Lewiston's main street to stand in groups;
and voices carried across the water from ship to land and from
land to ship, and bells jingled in the <i>Tenino</i>'s engine
room. The boat jarred softly against the landing piles.</p>

<p>"Where's gold?"</p>

<p>"New one over the Bitterroots! Alder Gulch! You got a long way
to go, brother!"</p>

<p>The gangplank bridged the gap to shore. Pushed by the crowd,
Pierce and Diana Castle crossed the landing and moved up an
inclined road, passing touts who cried out the names of saloons
and dance halls.</p>

<p>"The Luna House should be somewhere near," said Diana.</p>

<p>They went along the glitter and racket of Lewiston's long
irregular street between tents and boarded buildings and rough
log huts. This town was lusty, its saloons standing door to door
as far as they might see. A sharp, wind blew out of the
Bitterroots eastward and the boat passengers, stung by the
thought of gold, rushed ahead. Pierce and Diana passed a dance
hall at whose doorway women stood and beckoned trade, and arrived
presently before the Luna House, which was a square two-story
building without paint. She stopped here and gave him a smile
which, real and generous as it was, still held its shadow.</p>

<p>He said: "Here's your purse."</p>

<p>"You're broke, Jeff. Take what you need."</p>

<p>"I'll get along." He was troubled by another thought. "Those
people on the boat will know you as Mrs. Pierce. I don't see how
you'll get around that."</p>

<p>"They'll soon be gone to one place or another. It won't
matter."</p>

<p>"We're in a different country. News travels from camp to camp.
Wherever you go somebody will recognize you and wonder&mdash;and
maybe make some guesses about your being with me."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "It was something we had to
do."</p>

<p>"So-long," he said.</p>

<p>One quick crease came to her forehead, She bent nearer to look
at him. "Will I ever see you again? Will you be around here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered. "But I wish you all the luck. I
really do."</p>

<p>Temperton and Lily Beth arrived. Lily Beth said with pleased
relief, "Are you going to stay here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Diana. But she had her eyes still on Pierce as he
stepped away and raised his hat and said again: "So-long."</p>

<p>She lifted her shoulders and made a gesture with her hands and
gave him a swift-vanishing smile. Pierce moved down the street,
solid against the dance of shadow and saloon light. Diana came
about and put her hand on Lily Beth's arm. "Time for bed, isn't
it?" She had forgotten about Temperton at the moment and didn't
notice the manner in which he looked at her, then to the
departing Pierce, and back to her.</p>

<p><br> Pierce slept in the hayloft of a livery barn and had
breakfast in a tent restaurant on Lewiston's rambling main
street. Later he bought a razor and a cake of soap, returned to
the livery to shave, and presently faced the day.</p>

<p>Like all boom camps, this one had been hurriedly thrown
together of cheap lumber, canvas and logs. Fully three quarters
of the town consisted of saloons and dance halls; the rest of it
was made up of stores, miners' supply houses, livery barns,
restaurants, these being surrounded by irregular rows of tents
and cabins. At this hour the tide of traffic was at a peak,
wagons rolling into Lewiston with supplies and freight teams
moving out toward the mines along the Salmon and Clearwater.</p>

<p>"This town," said the stable hostler, "used to take in a lot
of money supplying the mines. It will be three-quarters empty by
fall. Everybody's going on to the Grasshopper and Alder Gulch
diggin's in Montana. That's where the boom is now."</p>

<p>"How d'you get there?"</p>

<p>"Most of the crowd's goin' the north route by way of the Coeur
d'Alene and the St. Regis, through Hell Gate, down the Deer Lodge
to the Beaverhead."</p>

<p>"How long a trip?"</p>

<p>"With a good horse maybe twelve days." Then the hostler said:
"I can set you up with an outfit for a hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Lil Shannon stepped from the Luna House and stopped when she
came abreast Pierce. She gave him a smile. "You're staying
here?"</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>"Never stick to a downgrade camp." She was not so much bold as
straightforward. There was no doubt of her trade, but still she
was an attractive woman, energetic and brisk and self-confident.
She had brown hair, and soft hazel eyes and a frank manner of
looking at a man. "You're no farmer. You've been in places like
this before."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She seemed very careful in her appraisal of him; she held her
interested smile. "Takes money for an outfit. Got a stake?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Alder Gulch is your place, Jeff. I'll stake you."</p>

<p>He had no idea where she had learned his name but her use of
it warmed him. "No," he said, "but you're all right."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm all right," she said and shrugged her shoulders.
"I'm leaving for Alder Gulch today." She dropped her eyes and
studied the walk, and suddenly added: "Ketchum's not to be
trusted, but Ives is the one to watch. You've left your wife
rather alone, haven't you?" When he failed to speak, she murmured
"Good luck," and moved on.</p>

<p>He idled along the street and looked back toward the Luna in
the half-expectation of seeing Diana Castle. More wagons rolled
out of Lewiston. A single rider came tearing into the street and
dropped from his horse in, front of a building that had a small
stage office sign extending from it. Ollie Rounds stood half
asleep in front of the Gem saloon; and grinned amiably.</p>

<p>At noon Jeff ate and, being restless, toured the town
again.</p>

<p>Over on the back side he saw men unloading lumber from a long
line of freighters and was hailed as he strolled by. "You want a
job? Pay's five dollars."</p>

<p>Pierce shucked his coat and moved to a wagon. A length of
lumber slid down from the wagon and somebody said "I'll take the
other end," and he looked around and saw before him the blond-
headed young man, who had argued his way aboard the
<i>Tenino</i>, "Name's Ben Scoggins," said he. "You're Pierce. I
heard about your run-in with Ives and Ketchum." They moved back
and forth between wagon and lumber pile, gently sweating under
the sun. Other wagons came up to be loaded, and moved away on the
long trip to the mines. Half-through the afternoon Scoggins spoke
again, as though there had been no gap in the talk. "None of
these miners keep what they get. It is the trader that makes the
money. That's what I got my eye on tradin'. But there ain't no
use wastin' time. Five dollars is five dollars. I can do my
lookin' for the main chance at night. Ain't thrifty to be
idle."</p>

<p>The boss came around at six to pay off. Pierce returned to
wash up at the livery barn, had his supper and sauntered along
the street. Night dropped&mdash;and lights moved out of saloon
and dance hall, and glowed yellow through tent sides; and the
outbound tide of men suddenly seemed to reverse itself and come
back in doubled volume, filling Lewison brim-ful. Coming past the
Luna House, he saw Diana Castle on the porch.</p>

<p>He stopped at once and showed his pleasure. She watched him
without speaking for a moment and it occurred to him that
loneliness had its way with her. She had been listening to the
full-rounded echoes of the street with a thoughtful expression
and now as her glance turned to him he noticed the softening of
expression. Her smile, delayed as it was, turned her pleasant and
pretty.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing, Jeff?"</p>

<p>"Getting information, Also did a half a day's work. Everybody,
it seems, is headed for Alder Gulch."</p>

<p>"Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Better see what's here first."</p>

<p>He hunted in his pocket for a cigar and took time lighting it;
and out of impulse he held up a hand to her. She came down the
steps at once and they turned toward the river, slowly walking.
"Anything happen for you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>At the landing men worked at the <i>Tenino</i>'s heavy cargo
by the light of tar flares and wind came in from the eastern
hills, brisk-cold. They swung aside, following a road away from
town, silent as they walked. The fragrance of her clothes came
powerfully to him, and he felt the swing of her body and even the
warm tone of her personality. The read followed up a slight grade
so that presently they came to a place from which they saw
Lewiston lying a little below them, all its lights winking in the
night.</p>

<p>"Why, Jeff," she said. "You're lonely."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I suppose I am."</p>

<p>Her voice was gentle for him. "You always seemed very composed
and self-sufficient to me."</p>

<p>"Always have been a lone wolf," he reflected. "I never see a
lighted house at night but what I think of the people inside.
They've get everything."</p>

<p>She spoke in a low, tentative voice: "Would you be thinking of
some woman somewhere?"</p>

<p>"I left home when I was twelve. A woman has been something I
never knew about. I'm speaking of your kind of a woman. Your kind
has been to me something like the light of a star a long, long
way off."</p>

<p>She caught her breath. "Then that is why you distrust me. The
star fell and when it came near you it wasn't what you thought,
You built a woman into something that never was. You are
disillusioned."</p>

<p>He shook his head and turned down the hill with her, the
softness gene; and the moment's undercurrent of nearness was
gone. At the hotel he lifted his hat. "Luck," he said. She only
nodded, and watched him go down toward the glowing heart of town.
In a moment he entered a tent saloon. Turning, she discovered
Will Temperton waiting. He lifted his hat. "May I have a word?"
he asked.</p>

<p>She knew, of course, that he was a gambler; for his was a type
of man that showed its professional signals always&mdash;the
neatness, the soft, steel-like courtesy, the gentle and dead
tone, the undercurrent of complete fatalism. He was one of
these.</p>

<p>"I would," he murmured, "say nothing to offend you. If I am
wrong I must ask your complete pardon. I would not presume to
make any comment on your affairs except that I have a daughter
and I need some help."</p>

<p>"You have a lovely daughter, Mr. Temperton,"</p>

<p>"She has no mother. And I believe you've observed that there
are times when I cannot help her. Not so much in the matter of
dress. In other things. In being able to make her see that I
would do anything on this earth for her. I can't tell her. It
must be done another way." He hesitated before adding the next
phrase. "She must know that I love her and would give my life for
her. I do not mean that idly."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"I believe you do. But she needs a woman to draw her out and
to take the place of a mother for at least a while. She's too
much alone. Probably you know my trade."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He was long still, struggling with his choice of words, and
with his own feelings. "It is the only trade I know," he said at
last. "Now you know why I take the liberty of being frank. The
gentleman is not your husband is he?"</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>"Thank you for not taking offense. I had to know. Lily Beth
and I are starting for Alder Gulch tomorrow, I have arranged for
the carriage and pack. I should like you to go along as her
companion, It is worth two hundred dollars a month to me, or any
other sum you'd care to set. As her companion, I mean nothing
else by the offer."</p>

<p>"Is her mother dead, Mr. Temperton?"</p>

<p>He delayed his answer and seemed hard put. "No," he said at
last. "She is not dead."</p>

<p>She had her quick start of feeling for the girl, and for the
woman who had lost Lily Beth. This was what came to her and
clung; and afterwards she discovered that she watched the big
tent saloon into which Pierce had gone. "You were nice to offer
this chance, but I can't accept it."</p>

<p>She expected him to argue. He did not. He took her decision
much as he took the turn of an unfavorable card. When the card
fell there was never a back-turning of it, no question and no
argument. "I'm sorry," he said, and turned into the Luna
House.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; "TAKE ME WITH
YOU"</h2>

<p class="first">THE following night Pierce stepped into the Gem
with two days' pay in his pocket and found elbow-room at the
hundred-foot bar. Ten barkeeps sweated at their work and housemen
scurried and ducked through the restless crowd to serve the
packed poker tables, the roulette wheel, the faro layouts, the
blackjack games. Inside this huge tent was a gold mine greater
than any gold mine to be found in the back hills; for out of
those hills men came with their dust, hungry and lonesome and
eager to spend. As the shrewd Ben Scoggins had said, the money
was in trading and not in digging.</p>

<p>Pierce got his drink, meanwhile noting here and there some of
his companions on the boat. Rounds patronized a blackjack table,
casually testing his luck. Ketchum stood near the doorway and
stared at the crowd with his dead, wicked eyes. Ives, Pierce
observed, was at the far end of the bar with a group of men he
seemed to know.</p>

<p>He paid for his drink and slowly ruffied his remaining nine
silver dollars betweeen his fingers, now considering the cost of
an outfit. A month's work at the lumberyard would turn the trick,
but a month was a long time and the tide of the gold rush was in
full swing. If a man stepped out of the tide he was in the
shallows and all his luck went bad. Everything was luck unless,
as Ben Scoggins intended, a man got into trade. Pierce thought
about that too, but not for long. He was no trader. He had
freighted on the long Santa Fe trail, he had tended stage station
up, the Platte, he had ridden Pony Express out of Julesburg, he
had taken his year of action in the war and, being wounded, had
drifted to the California gold-fields. He had been many things,
but never a trader.</p>

<p>He moved to the blackjack table where Ollie Rounds was, laid
his nine silver dollars before him and signaled the dealer for
cards. He looked at his cards and said: "Stand on these." The
dealer went around the circle and looked at his own hand, and
debated and took a card. He broke himself and paid off, doubling
Pierce's stake. "Play eighteen dollars," said Pierce.</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds said: "Luck."</p>

<p>The cards came around again. Pierce studied his pair and stood
pat. Somebody stirred the crowd behind him and pressure pushed
Pierce against the blackjack table. The dealer said: "Pay
twenty."</p>

<p>"Pay me," said Pierce and turned to have a look at the cause
of the confusion. George Ives had made a hole in the crowd with
his shoulders and George Ives's face was ruddy red and his green
eyes danced. "Friend," he said, "I just remembered we had a
conversation."</p>

<p>The blackjack dealer cut in, speaking to Pierce. "What're you
playing?"</p>

<p>Pierce turned to Ollie. "Play my stack. Play it straight
through." He turned from the table again, watching the crowd give
George Ives room. This Ives, Pierce considered, cut a figure in
his clothes. He had a tremendous diamond ring and when he lifted
his hand to adjust the flowing black tie at his throat, the gem
flashed like an engine's headlight. But if he was a fop he also
had a straight-grained nerve. He wanted trouble; he laughed at
the thought of trouble and now stood inviting it.</p>

<p>"I guess we did," admitted Pierce. "You bring a good
reason?"</p>

<p>"A fight's a fight," said Ives. "I think I can do you in." The
crowd had backed against the tent walls, sensing violence. The
dealer said, "I'll pay eighteen," and Ollie Rounds answered, "Pay
here then."</p>

<p>Pierce saw Ketchum posed like a sullen dog near the door, and
then his glance returned to Ives's full-blooded face, to the
man's high smile and to the dancing deviltry of his eyes. "All
right," said Pierce, "here's your fun," and caught him across the
mouth with a short, smashing blow. Ives, making his stand for the
crowd's benefit, had not been quite prepared. He fell backward
and down, striking the packed dirt floor with his head; he rolled
like a cat and leaped up and his smile came broad and brilliant
through a sudden-bleeding cut in his lips. He hallooed a great
shout and dropped his head a little and ran in.</p>

<p>He was a faster man than Pierce; he had his skill and his
complete assurance. He struck Pierce twice on the head as Pierce
slid sidewise and his eyes, now small and cool, measured Pierce
and he struck again, catching Pierce on the neck. Pierce lifted
his forearm to block these swift light blows, but they broke
through his defense&mdash;and cut and stung and all this while
George Ives danced away and circled and jumped forward and his
light eyes were half closed and very bright, and filling with
cool pleasure.</p>

<p>Pierce stood on his heels, neither retreating nor advancing;
he pivoted to face his constantly swinging, never-still opponent.
His hat had dropped and his head was a motionless target and his
big hands lifted and lowered to screen himself. He waited out
that feinting, shifting, dancing attack and as he wafted he
watched George Ives's lip corners pull in and his nostrils begin
to spring wider from need of air. Ives darted forward, his feet
making a sandpaper sound on the packed dirt floor and he caught
Pierce under the belt and followed it with two rapid jabs to face
and temple.</p>

<p>Back in the crowd a voice called: "Cut him to ribbons, George!
Stand off and slice him down!" The blackjack player's voice came
through the half-sound of the saloon: "Pay eighteen," and after
that Ollie Rounds answered: "Pay here&mdash;and ride the stack."
Rube Ketchum, still by the door, let his big shoulders fall until
he was in half a crouch, watching Pierce with his empty, morose
eyes.</p>

<p>And at that moment George Ives ceased to smile. He came to a
full stop, with his breath racking in and out of his chest and he
flung up his head and cried, "Damn you&mdash;come on! What are
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>This was the moment for which Pierce waited and now with
George Ives stopped he jumped forward, struck him a single,
sweeping blow on the cheekbone and stunned the man in his tracks.
Ives brought up his arms to cover himself. Pierce tore them down.
He moved on step by step, beating Ives backward. He made a second
jump and seized Ives at the chest and he lifted Ives from his
feet and threw him against the tent wall. Ives stumbled and
fought for balance, half bent over. Pierce, caught him again and
at these close quarters he pounded at Ives's face with his left
hand until he saw light turn gray in the man's eyes; and he
lifted him from his feet and flung him to the hard dirt
floor&mdash;and stepped back.</p>

<p>Ives was hurt. He lay on his side without wind. His leg kept
pushing forward in a kind of steady jerk and he put his free hand
to his face and held it. Pierce murmured: "I told you there, was
no fun in this business."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds cried out: "Stand still, Rube!"</p>

<p>Pierce now remembered the doglike Ketchum and wheeled and
found Ketchum frozen in his crouch, one hand gripping the gun at
his belt. Ollie Rounds had stopped that draw before completion;
he had turned from the blackjack table to fling the muzzle of his
revolver dead down on Ketchum. "Stand still, Rube," he
repeated.</p>

<p>Ives came up from the floor and braced himself on spread legs.
He scrubbed sweat and dirt and blood from his face with a slow
pull of his palm. He lifted his chin and found Pierce. The smile
was gone and the assurance was gone, so that for a moment he was
dull and voiceless and not in command of himself.</p>

<p>The blackjack dealer said: "How about this stack?"</p>

<p>"Cash in," Pierce said. "We've had fun enough." He never let
his eyes leave George Ives, and now watched remembrance come to
the man. The dash and daring, Pierce observed, was a thin cover
stretched over Ives's character; for what he saw now&mdash;coming
out through the breaks of that cover&mdash;was a ruined pride and
a cruel, conscienceless greed to repair it. Yet Ives was a
dissembling man; now he searched for his smile and found one
ragged streak of it, and said: "I thought I might do you in,
friend. You're better than I figured. But you're slow. Next
time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What next time?" asked Pierce.</p>

<p>"Always a next time," said George Ives and made a sharp turn
on his heel and left the saloon. Ketchum followed like an
obedient dog.</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds murmured, "Here's your velvet," and slid the
blackjack stake into Pierce's pocket. He caught Pierce by the arm
and his tone got rougher. "Come on&mdash;come on," and he moved
with Pierce to the saloon's door. Out in the street Pierce
stopped and felt the weight of his pocket. "What's there?"</p>

<p>"I ran it through the deal four times straight. Five hundred
dollars. Let's get out of this. I don't like it."</p>

<p>They moved over the street, hearing the hum and boil of talk
rise again in the Gem. Ketchum and Ives had vanished and Ollie
Rounds seemed in a greater and greater haste. At the stable
wherein Pierce had made his lodging, Rounds retreated into the
runway's darkness and called Pierce after him. "Where's your
gun?"</p>

<p>"Haven't got one."</p>

<p>"Man&mdash;man," grumbled Ollie Rounds, "what's the matter
with you? Take mine. I'll get another."</p>

<p>"Ollie," said Pierce, "thanks."</p>

<p>But Ollie Rounds was already on his way to the rear entrance
of the stable and his voice came back with its overriding
urgency. "Think fast. They'll be back." With that final warning
he disappeared.</p>

<p>Pierce lifted the gun given to him; he sighted it against the
stable's single lantern to check its loads. The hostler, smelling
trouble, had drawn away from him and the hostler called from the
blackness of a stall. "I don't want a fight in here. Move on,
friend. Move on."</p>

<p>Pierce advanced to the edge of the archway, thus commanding a
view of the street. Men trafficked steadily in and out of the Gem
and the other saloons and dance halls sitting side by side; and
freighters rolled out of town, and more men came in from the
hills to leave their dust on Lewiston's bars. His teeth ached
from the beating he had taken around the face and his scarred
knuckles steadily throbbed. Another upriver boat had landed and
the passengers marched up from the landing and barkers ran out of
the saloons and began to call, and a solitary figure paused in
front of the Luna House briefly and afterwards walked forward. He
was for a little while in the shadows but even then the manner of
his trudging gait and the swing of his bulky shoulders arrested
Pierce's interest; a moment later he crossed a beam of store
light and turned over to the Gem and at that instant Pierce
identified him. This was Mister Sitgreaves, plodding doggedly
upon his errand of retribution.</p>

<p>Pierce had been holding the gun in his hand. Now he tucked it
inside his belt and as soon as Sitgreaves entered the saloon
Pierce left the stable and walked to the Luna House. He got
Diana's room number from the clerk, climbed the stairs and
knocked at her door.</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed, when she opened the door, was the
quick look of fear that came to her face; and the first thing she
said was, "What's wrong, Jeff? What happened?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said, and wondered at the impulse which had
brought him here. "I thought I'd say good-by. I'm leaving for
Alder Gulch."</p>

<p>She wore a long woollen robe which she had evidently purchased
since her arrival; and her hair had been done high on her head
for the night. She faced him, holding the lapels of the robe
together and for a brief moment she showed him a lost and lonely
expression. "I thought you meant to stay."</p>

<p>"No," he said. Then he smiled. "I met you in the middle of the
night. Now I'm saying good-by in the middle of the night." When
he smiled the bitter-alum of his spirit vanished and left him
cheerful. He had, she thought quickly, two complete sides to him,
one on which the world had laid its marks of distrust and
hardness, and one which remained buoyant and free. It made her
say with some vehemence: "Why did you bother to come here at
all?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said, "just to say thanks." Then, he gave her a
keen glance. "Or maybe not. I don't really know."</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes. Her hair blackly glistened under the
lamplight, her skin was fair and smooth and rose-colored; she had
a woman's good and wide and clean-edged lips. She lifted her head
and then he saw the flare of the same alert spirit which had been
with her in Madame Bessie's. The same half-hidden sense of
enjoyment was there. "There's nothing here for me, Jeff. Take me
with you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>She made expressive turns with her two hands. "Everybody's
going on to Alder Gulch. I don't want to be caught in another
back eddy as I was in Portland."</p>

<p>"It is a hard trip,"</p>

<p>"I won't complain." She watched him and saw his smile go. The
change that went through him was clear enough, turning her heart
heavy. "I know," she softly added, "what you are thinking. I
shall be alone with you again. I am making myself cheaper." She
sighed and she shrugged her shoulders, "We must make the best of
it. Take me."</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Meet me in the lobby in half an hour.
I'll get an outfit together."</p>

<p>"You'll need my purse again."</p>

<p>"I had a little luck at blackjack," he said. He turned down
the hall at once, crossed the street and ducked into the livery
barn. Forty-five minutes afterwards he brought a hastily acquired
outfit&mdash;a horse for each of them and a third for a pack
animal&mdash;into a dark alley near the Luna House. She was on
the hotel's porch waiting and came at once to him. He gave her a
hand to the sidesaddle of her horse and immediately turned
northwest in the direction of Walla Walla. He said: "This will be
a rough trip. I want to push along fast."</p>

<p>"I don't mind."</p>

<p>"Here we go for Alder Gulch."</p>

<p><br> They camped that night in a stage station on the old Fort
Walla Walla road and next day reached the junction of the Palouse
and turned northeast along a route heavily marked by travel. Two
days later they were at the Spokane and here swung east, curling
around the Coeur d'Alene Lake. A driving day's ride brought them
into the Coeur d'Alene Mission. So far they had been in open,
rolling land, and so far they had found shelter in toll-ferry
houses or lone horse camps and rough taverns sprung up on the
trail. Beyond the mission lay the rough and timbered heights of
the Bitterroots into which the trail plunged and lifted and
dodged from canyon to canyon. They forded creeks swollen by
spring rain and slipped through deep mud-mire. Five days from
Lewiston they arrived at the summit of the Bitterroots and came
beside the St. Regis River, which moved east into a mountain
valley skirted by high hills. They camped here in a slashing
rain, covered by dark pines weeping dismally on them. Diana
cooked supper over a fire which Pierce nursed into a roaring
blaze; they made their beds on the sodden ground, wrapped in the
tarps Pierce had thought to buy in Lewiston.</p>

<p>A great rain wind whirled over the mountains and cried and
crashed through the trees. The fire soon died. The river moved
through its rocky glen with a battering roar. Pierce watched the
near-by shape of Diana beneath her tarp, wondering if she slept.
Then he heard her say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You haven't told me why you left Lewiston in such a
hurry."</p>

<p>"I saw Sitgreaves come into town. He was the Captain's
brother."</p>

<p>She was a yard away from him and she turned beneath the tarp
so that he saw her face as a pale image in the tempestuous night.
"You're not afraid. Why did you run?" He lay still and carefully
brought up those reasons which had been so clear to him in
Lewiston. On sight of Sitgreaves he had known he could do one of
two things&mdash;he could run or he could kill the man; and he
had at once known he would run.</p>

<p>"Those two men were drivers. That's the way they ran the ship.
But that's the way all ships are operated. According to their
lights they were good officers. They figured they had to be
brutal or else lose control of the crew. That's the system at
sea. The Captain had to settle me or watch his whole crew go
overside, for the rest of the men were the same as I was,
prisoners shanghaied aboard. He missed me with his shot and I hit
him. It might have been the other way around just as easily. I
had luck and he didn't. I don't blame the skipper. I feel sorry
for what happened to him. There isn't any mercy in the
world."</p>

<p>Wind howled and slashed through the pines and the river beat
up its cannonading roar; and the world's raw force sang its
terrible hallelujah through the dark.</p>

<p>"This mate Sitgreaves was the same. He saw his brother die. He
liked his brother and so he told himself he'd come after me. You
see what's in the man's mind? He thinks right and justice are on
his side. He's not a crook. If he were I would have shot him out
of his saddle in Lewiston. His conscience is clear and his law is
clear to him&mdash;tooth for tooth, claw for claw. He's the
avenging angel of the Lord&mdash;and it seems so right to him
he'll wear himself out to do what he's got to do. I can see his
point. Well, I had to shoot him or run. I ran. I do not want him
on my conscience."</p>

<p>"What a strange mixture of things I see and hear in you," she
murmured.</p>

<p>"Are you warm?"</p>

<p>"Listen to the wind tell us how great it is to be alive. Never
be content with little things. The world is wide and all things
are wonderful and somewhere, for every living soul, there is
adventure to make his life sweet and his days good."</p>

<p>"The wind," he said, "is laying down the only law. The weak
shall perish, just and unjust alike. Christian charity is a
golden dream. The meek and mild will rule when the sun is shining
and there are no wars. But when men grow flabby, and the fear of
death makes them flinch back, and if the love of comfort holds
them indoors, they die. You are hearing trumpets blowing, Diana.
We are to arise and march. It doesn't make any difference where
we're going. Nobody knows. It is the doer who alone counts, the
fellow who sweats and is not afraid. The others do not count. Are
you warm, Diana?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What is that sound?"</p>

<p>"A big gray lobo wolf answering the wind."</p>

<p>They followed the St. Regis, through little valleys and
between great dark gorges. They passed Hellgate and Cantonment
Wright and pursued the crooked turnings of the Hellgate River.
Peaks showed white high above them in the early summer's sun and
creeks whirled past them, foam-white between great boulder banks.
They traveled rapidly by a steady stream of traffic moving toward
the new gold strike, past wagon trains and solitary riders, past
lumbering lines of supply outfits, past graves fresh-cut in the
yellow clay soil; down long mountain grades thick with mud and
through little valleys turning green and between the lanes of
pine and early spring flowers red and yellow and white. The smell
of everything around them was thin and wild, and everything was
new and empty and vast. At the mouth of the Deer Lodge they swung
south, here coming upon three women who traveled with a freight
outfit. One of the women was Lil Shannon. She gave them a wave of
her hand as they ran on. Ten days from Lewiston they labored over
a rough spur of the Rockies and saw the country undulate before
them in long, heavy and barren stringers. "Over there," said
Pierce, "is Alder Gulch." That night they stopped in a miner's
settlement and a miner's squaw wife took Diana into a house while
Pierce pitched camp beside a creek.</p>

<p>They were not far from journey's end now, and the sense of
ending was with them again, bringing its uncertainty and its
strangeness. During the evening Diana came out and joined Pierce
over the campfire, to match his silence with her own. When he did
speak up it was to ask a question he had asked her before.</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>She shrugged it aside, not thinking of it. All along the route
they had dropped little pieces of their individual stories so
that now they knew each other better. It was of this that Diana
spoke.</p>

<p>"How did you ever come to leave home, Jeff? You never told
me."</p>

<p>"Six of us in the family. Four boys and two girls. My father
died and my mother moved to Boston to get work. There never was
enough work. One day she called my oldest brother into the house
and handed him a dollar. That was about all the money we had. She
just said, You'll have to go out and make your way. I can't keep
you. He was fifteen at the time. I remember she kissed him and
pushed him out and closed the door. We never saw him again. Work
was scarce and all of us were starving most of the time. My
mother had nothing else she could do. When my next oldest brother
was fourteen she sent him away. It went like that until there
were my two sisters and myself left. One day when I was twelve I
came home from school and found her waiting for me at the door.
She had tied my clothes in a bundle. She had a loaf of bread and
some apples in a sack. There wasn't any dollar. She just said,
'It is your turn.' She had kissed my other brothers when they
left. She didn't kiss me. I was the youngest boy. She didn't even
take my hand. She just said, 'Good-by.' I went down the road
about two hundred yards. When I looked back I saw her in the
doorway. That was the hardest moment in my life, nothing like it
before or since. I wanted to cry, but she wasn't crying&mdash;she
had been through so much she couldn't cry any more&mdash;and so I
couldn't cry. I waved at her. She didn't wave back. She just
closed the door and I went down the road."</p>

<p>He bent forward to poke up the fire and she saw the flame of
the fire in his eyes, the bitterness on his face, the bare and
depthless hurt leaping through him. "I got a job as breaker boy
in a mine, and one thing and another, drifting from place to
place. Just before the war broke out I came back from St. Louis
to find her. I had written a few times but the letters never got
to her. She had been moving around from one shack to another.
Well, I went back. She was dead. My sisters were married. Never
heard from my brothers." He dropped a piece of brush into the
fire and added, "It took me ten years to understand why she
didn't kiss me when she pushed me out of the house. She couldn't
stand to do it. It would have made things that much harder. I
have since never been able to feel the troubles of other people
very much. When I think of her everything else looks pretty
small."</p>

<p>She had said nothing. Turning, he saw that she had tears in
her eyes, that she had her fingers tightly together and tried to
keep from making a sound. He put a hand on her shoulder.
"Shouldn't have mentioned it. It is my life, not yours."</p>

<p>She stood up. She pressed the tears from her eyes with the end
of a finger. He rose, again speaking. "Never mind. I have gotten
along, and so will you. Just remember that the hand of man is
raised against the hand of man wherever you go. It will save you
a lot of misery."</p>

<p>"I wish you didn't think that," she said. "Everything else
about you is good. But you will always be like that until someday
you'll see that people are kinder than you think. How lonely you
are!"</p>

<p>He smiled in a fashion that was for him rather gentle and
apologetic, as though he realized what he was and could not help
it and wished it otherwise. And his smile was sorry for her
tears. "Never let a man make you cry, Diana."</p>

<p>"I can't be like that. I must trust people. I can never lock
myself away from them. What is the use of living if you have
nothing or nobody to live for?"</p>

<p>She remained before him, watching his face in the close and
deeply personal way she had; and the warm light of her eyes grew
and her face changed in a manner he could not describe, but
suddenly she was a shape and a substance before him and a
fragrance and a melody all around him, so that the loneliness
that always lived in him grew insupportable. The wall he held up
against the world went down; the standards he held concerning
women dropped away. She was before him and there was nothing
between them&mdash;no barrier of his own making and none that he
felt from her. He moved ahead and put his long arms around her
and, watching her lips lift, he saw that she was smiling; and so
he kissed her.</p>

<p>There was never any completion to a kiss, never the full
giving of those things in him and never the whole receiving of
that mystery which lay in a woman. He pulled back, angered at
himself and on the point of apologizing. But the apology faded
when he saw her smile die. She was fully open to him and silently
saying it. In her a great tide moved and washed away her reserve,
so that she faced him and read confidently what was in him and
waited without embarrassment for him to read what was in her. She
touched him with her hand and said, "Jeff," and she was waiting;
and that hidden sense of excitement moved into view, as though
this moment was a high point of her life for which she had so
long prayed.</p>

<p>He dropped his head, he shook his head. He stepped clear and
at once the fineness of the moment went away and his earliest
doubt of her came back. For a little while she had carried him
beyond anything he had experienced; now that was gone and his
stubborn and familiar standards moved forward. By these he judged
her.</p>

<p>"We have been together too long," he said. "The fault was
mine."</p>

<p>She was stone still and then the change of her expression
shocked him. She looked as though he had hit her across the face.
She was cold and stunned, the great fine blaze of light dying
from her eyes and leaving her dull. She caught her breath and
turned away, half running back to the miner's cabin.</p>

<p>He kicked out the fire and walked over its coals until the
heat scorched his boots. He was in the sharp-winded darkness, let
down and bitter. She had offered too much to a man she had known
only ten days; looking at him she had made no reservations.</p>

<p>They were on the trail at daybreak, saying nothing. They
camped that night on the Beaverhead and next day reached the
Stinkingwater at the mouth of Alder Gulch. This was the
fourteenth and last day. Turning up the Gulch they passed stage
stations, filed through a rocky narrow chasm choked by teams and
riders and men afoot, and came upon a settlement. The road
straggled upgrade with the Gulch, along whose edges were the
potholes of prospectors one upon another. Camps clung to the edge
of the Gulch, strung together like beads. They came to Nevada
City, followed the road over a hill and fell into Virginia City,
its streets and cross-streets ephemerally marked out by tents and
brush wickiups and a few board houses; they made their way to the
center of town and here halted.</p>

<p>Pierce lifted his hat. "This is it," he said.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jeff."</p>

<p>"If there is anything you wish me to do&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were two strangers face to face across an unbridged
canyon; and even as she thanked him her expressive hazel eyes
were cool and showed him a reserve that seemed unchangeable.
"No," she said. "There is nothing more."</p>

<p>He bowed, replaced his hat, and moved away through the crowd.
Hammers flatted steadily against the day and voices lifted and
fell, and wagons made a ceaseless parade in and out, of town.
Alder Creek sparkled under a fresh sun and four thousand
prospectors stood along it with their sluices and pans and long
toms and gutted the hillside where once an old river's channel
had dropped its gold treasure. Somewhere a gun went off, making a
nasal complaint but drawing no notice whatever. This was Virginia
City in Montana, June of 1863. Near by the Ruby Mountains and the
Tobacco Roots lifted burly shoulders to the sky and civilization
and law were a thousand miles away, and men of all kinds and
qualities poured as a steady stream from the corners of America.
Here Diana Castle and Jeff Pierce now found themselves. He turned
a corner and saw a saloon's sign on a wall: JACK TANNER'S. Music
from a hurdy-gurdy house adjoining came out with the shouts of
customers and the calculated laughter of the dance-hall
girls.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; EVIL PROMPTS A MAN</h2>

<p class="first">BARNEY MORRIS came into The Pantheon during the
shank of the evening and placed himself at the bar. Barney, once
a merchant in Ohio, was a chunky man whose ruby face was framed
in fatherly muttonchop whiskers. Barney was one of the
redoubtables of the Gulch, early-arrived on the scene and the
possessor of a claim straddling Alder Creek half a mile above
discovery.</p>

<p>The Pantheon stood on Wallace Street, newly thrown together
from alder logs and brush and mud. A bar skirted the edge of a
dance floor on which miners broke the day's work by whirling
their favorite girls at a dollar a throw. On a raised platform at
the far end of the room the fiddles and guitars pitched into a
quadrille with the announcer sing-songing the figures through his
nose.</p>

<p>Barney weighed out his dollar's dust on the bar scales and got
his ticket. The music came to a dead halt, the announcer cried,
"Promenade!" and the ladies led their gentlemen promptly toward
the refreshments which, at fifty cents a glass, ended every dance
set. The miners took their whisky straight while the ladies, to
whom this was a routine part of the night's business, drank
ginger beer and moved back to the floor to await the next partner
and the next set. Barney at once sought out Lil Shannon, gave her
his ticket and squared himself away like a wrestler.</p>

<p>"You've been away," said Barney. "I've missed you."</p>

<p>"I took a trip to Portland," said Lil. "How's things?"</p>

<p>"Fair," said Barney.</p>

<p>"You've got a fortune out of that claim, Barney. Don't tell
me."</p>

<p>But Barney was close-mouthed about his affairs and although
Lil Shannon was an old friend he only grinned.</p>

<p>Lil said: "Written to your wife lately?"</p>

<p>"Sure. She sent me a tintype of Bill the other day. Tall as I
am now."</p>

<p>"Barney," said Lil, now completely serious, "you've made your
stake. Don't stay here too long or the toughs will knock you over
the head some night."</p>

<p>"Going home," said Barney, "in a couple months. Been away from
Ohio two years. Kind of feel the need of my people."</p>

<p>The announcer yelled: "Gentlemen, claim your partners!" The
music moved into a waltz time and Barney, grim as death about
this business, seized Lil Shannon and whirled her around,
stamping his boots at every second swing. The room grew warm as
all these black-burned men, stained with the yellow clay of the
diggings, shaggy-haired and short-tempered, wheeled and collided
and wheeled. The ladies were all accustomed to twenty dances a
night and deftly maneuvered beyond the heavy feet of their
partners. Lil Shannon laughed at Barney's dead-set expression and
the steady motion of his lips as he counted the waltz rhythm. She
wore a red gown laced with gold and her cheeks were rose and her
brown eyes sparkled; and, turning around and around, she saw Jeff
Pierce standing as an onlooker near the door.</p>

<p>"Barney," she said. "See the tall man with the poker face? His
name is Pierce and he's new. I came up the river on the same boat
with him. He had a quarrel with Ketchum and Ives at the Umatilla
House."</p>

<p>"That pair came in yesterday. All the roughs are comin' in.
This will be a mean camp, Lil. Your tall man's got nerve."</p>

<p>"Bump into him tomorrow and help him locate a claim,"
suggested Lil. "If he waits another week there won't be a yard of
unstaked ground left."</p>

<p>"What you helping greenhorns for?"</p>

<p>"When I like a man," said Lil, "I like him a lot."</p>

<p>"That's right. You're a big nugget in the creek, Lil."</p>

<p>"He knocked Rube down. That makes him all right."</p>

<p>The music quit and the announcer yelled: "Promenade!" Barney
escorted Lil to the bar, paid for the drinks, and made his
answer. "I'll do it for you."</p>

<p>"And you pack up and go back east. Everybody knows you've got
a heavy stake. It is getting tough for a man to ride from here to
Bannack without being held up."</p>

<p>"Don't let any man make a soft touch out of you, Lil," said
Barney.</p>

<p>"When I like somebody," said Lil, "I'm all for him." Pierce,
she discovered, had gone, whereupon she turned to the dance floor
and smiled at a small, young prospector who marched toward her
with his ticket. A second miner moved in at the same time and
brushed the small one aside with a straight-armed jab. "I'll
dance with Lil," he said. The small man caught his balance and
swung with a white, wicked smile. The big man had even then
turned his shoulder to the little one. The little man brought up
an arm and smashed it across the back of the big man's neck and
dropped him to the floor. He gave his ticket to Lil and softly
said: "Mine, I think."</p>

<p>"You're pretty fast," said Lil.</p>

<p>The young man said: "A runt like me learns that first off.
Fast or dead."</p>

<p><br> Having spent a year in the California diggings, Pierce
took time to study this new camp, and on the second day he left
Virginia City and walked up the Gulch in the direction of Summit
Camp. The trail followed the creek's edge, around piles of gravel
and shaft holes and tents and brush shacks. All along this way
men crouched with their pans, slowly dipping and slowly rocking.
Back from the creek other men had staked the dry bars, here
shoveling up the soil in buckets and carrying it to the water;
farther up the hill, men scraped away topsoil to reach gold-
bearing gravel deposited by some earlier riverbed. On every hand
were to be seen the various contrivances for extracting gold from
rock and dirt&mdash;the pan, the rocker, the sluice box with its
riffles, the long tom. At one tent a string of washing hung on a
line; before a brush hut somebody had tacked up his particular
whimsy: "Mountain Home." A lone man walked down the Gulch,
selling single sheets of a month-old paper at a dollar a
sheet.</p>

<p>Half a mile from Virginia City, Pierce came before a signboard
containing the rules of the district, and stopped to
read:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="sign" style="font-size: 1.5em">FAIRWEATHER DISTRICT</p>

<p class="sign">
* THE OFFICERS OF THIS DISTRICT SHALL BE<br>
PRESIDENT, RECORDER, JUDGE AND SHERIFF.<br>
<br>
* THE CENTER OF THE STREAM SHALL BE THE LINE.<br>
<br>
* EVERY PERSON MAY HOLD, BY PRE-EMPTION OR PURCHASE,<br>
TWO CREEK, BAR HILL AND LODE CLAIMS, AND NO MORE,<br>
BUT NO PERSON CAN PRE-EMPT MORE THAN ONE KIND.<br>
<br>
* CREEK CLAIMS SHALL BE FIFTY FEET ON THE CREEK,<br>

THE GULCH, AND EXTEND ONE FOOT OVER ON EACH SIDE.<br>
<br>* LODE CLAIMS SHALL BE 100 FEET ON THE LODE<br>
AND TWENTY-FIVE FEET EACH SIDE.</p>

<p><br>
He was in this attitude when a voice turned him about, and a
muscular, middle-aged man with a ruby face stood by: "You're the
one that knocked Rube Ketchum down?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All this creek's staked, clear up to Bald Knob. There's a
little canyon next to my claim, though, that ain't been claimed.
Everybody rushes by, lookin' for gold to pop out like
sunshine."</p>

<p>Pierce said: "You make a living locating claims for
greenhorns?"</p>

<p>"Why to hell with you. I'm Barney Morris and I'm doin' you a
turn. You knocked Rube Ketchum down."</p>

<p>Pierce smiled at that. "Thanks," he said, and walked away from
the creek with Barney Morris. A hundred yards onward the Gulch
wall opened into a small dry draw. Morris said: "That's it."</p>

<p>"No water."</p>

<p>"You lug your pay dirt down to the creek. If it shows good
color you can bring a flume down from the head of the creek."</p>

<p>The draw lay narrow between yellow-gray walls with a few dead
alders standing fire-blackened on the low side. Pierce said:
"Looks like a canyon I ran across down near Hangtown. I found a
skeleton in that one."</p>

<p>"None here yet," said Barney Morris. "This is a young camp."
He pointed to his own stakes at the edge of the canyon's mouth.
"Start from here. You get a hundred feet. You go up both slopes
to one foot over each ridge." He was aware of Pierce's thoughtful
study, and so said: "You're a disbelieving young man. You don't
know about this."</p>

<p>"Something for nothing is a bad bargain," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"You braced Rube Ketchum. That counts."</p>

<p>"Thanks again. I'll stake it."</p>

<p>"One more thing," added Barney. "Keep your mouth shut about
what you got in your dust pouch. Always play poor."</p>

<p>Pierce paced a hundred feet up the draw. He built a pile of
rocks at this point; climbed the side of the draw and made
another rock pile under which he put a slip of paper with his
name. After that he established the other corners of the claim
and scanned the general lay of the ground without much
excitement. Gravel was beneath a shallow layer of soil; and that
gravel had to be taken bucket by bucket to the creek for panning.
He would put some kind of shelter at the head of the draw but he
would dig his first test hole at the foot of it. What he needed
was a shovel and ax, a pick and a pan and a supply of grub.</p>

<p>Then, always aware of the sudden accidents and treacheries of
life, he looked again at the spot he had picked for his cabin and
observed that it was fully exposed to a man who might lie on the
canyon ridge with a gun. This kind of thought always came clear
and quick to him, born of his own particularly hard struggle for
survival. He shrugged this reflection aside and returned to
Virginia City, his first chore being to register his claim.</p>

<p>Afterwards he had a meal in a tent restaurant and moved to a
store for his supplies. Everything in this camp had come by
freight team through difficult country, from distant Salt Lake,
or from faraway Fort Benton, or from Lewiston, which was a
thirty-day haul. A shovel and ax, a pick, a pan, a lantern and a
gallon of kerosene, and enough staple food for a week cost him
sixty-five dollars. He paid fifty cents for three small apples,
slung his supplies over a shoulder and lugged them down to a
stable where he kept his horses.</p>

<p>There was no let-up in the steady stream of men pouring over
the small hill into Virginia. Ox-teams and freight strings choked
the half-formed streets and goods lay piled everywhere and
carpenters flung together boards and two-by-fours and lifted
building fronts in the space of an hour. A string of cattle,
herded in from across the mountains, milled in half stampede
through the congested, cursing traffic, and the owner of the tent
restaurant ran out to the street with a rifle, to shout at a
passing herder: "A hundred dollars for the first cow that runs in
front of me."</p>

<p>The herder wheeled around. "Sold," he said. The restaurant man
pulled up his rifle and took sight on a leggy beast careering
around the corner of the Pantheon; he dropped it at his feet with
one shot.</p>

<p>Pierce moved on, eating the last of his three apples, and met
Ollie Rounds in front of Tanner's saloon. The redhead had a
cheerful smile for him. "Wondered what happened to you. What are
you doing?"</p>

<p>"Up the creek on a claim."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds was amused. "You work too fast. Stop once in a
while, my friend, and just loaf."</p>

<p>"Luck," said Jeff Pierce, and moved back to Wallace in time to
see Diana Castle cross to the tent restaurant. The sun had
dropped beyond the hills and the mountain country's quick
twilight rolled blue and thin through the Gulch. When he came
near the restaurant she discovered him and stopped. She had,
Pierce thought, a pleased expression, as though all this was what
she had hoped to find. She gave him a moment's attention, turning
serious. "Have you had luck?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I staked a claim."</p>

<p>She nodded and entered the restaurant. Pierce got his supplies
from the stable and returned up the Gulch.</p>

<p><br> The tent restaurant was nothing but a series of planks
set on wooden horses, with drygoods boxes for chairs. One man
served and one other man, sweating and cranky, worked over a
stove at the rear. The meal was beans and bacon and bread and
coffee, and the price was a dollar. Dessert was stewed prunes
dipped out of a stone crock. Being hungry, Diana ate without
complaint. There was never enough of anything in a camp like
this. These men, hungry from work and with gold in their pouches,
took anything and everything offered, but there was never
enough.</p>

<p>Rising from the table she remembered what her father had once
said: "Back East, where everything is settled and hardened into a
pattern, people have forgotten how to be resourceful. Out here
that's the main thing&mdash;to keep a sharp eye for a chance, and
to seize that chance at once."</p>

<p>On impulse she turned to the rear of the tent and stood by the
cook. "Why don't you make pies? Men like pie."</p>

<p>"Because," said the cook, never ceasing his rapid moving
between stove and serving table, "I ain't got eight arms. I never
was much good on pie anyhow."</p>

<p>"You've got flour and dried fruits."</p>

<p>He said: "Can you make pies?"</p>

<p>Her father's remark seemed right in her ear, freshly spoken.
She said: "I'll come here in the morning after the breakfast
rush. I'll make your pies for a dollar apiece."</p>

<p>"Stove's not big enough. I cook all day."</p>

<p>"I'll get another stove and put it outside the tent."</p>

<p>He said: "That's a bargain. You do it."</p>

<p>She left the restaurant happier than she had been for days.
This was something she could put her hands to and this was a part
answer to the question Jeff Pierce had repeatedly asked her:
"What will you do?" She would do this. She would do anything that
was within her ability to do. There was a place in this camp for
a woman as well as for a man. For a straight woman. Going down
the street, now a black lane through which the lights of saloon
and dance hall and store made yellow flickering stripes. She
smiled to herself and felt the goodness of the curt night air.
Turning the corner of Wallace she came against Will Temperton.
"Where's Lily Beth?"</p>

<p>"In bed. We made a long drive to get here today and she's
tired. We're camped outside of town." He gave her a thoughtful
appraisal. "You seem contented."</p>

<p>"I have found something to do. Tomorrow I begin making pies
for the restaurant."</p>

<p>"You are pleased with that?"</p>

<p>"I'm pleased with anything I can do."</p>

<p>He nodded and seemed to understand. "I had thought to find
better quarters. A tent is not much good for a young girl. The
town is crowded."</p>

<p>She said: "I have a log house near the foot of the hill. I
simply talked a miner out of it. If you propose to stay here let
me have Lily Beth for a while."</p>

<p>"You have changed your mind?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "But it will not be quite the same as you
suggested. I want nothing for this. We'll see how Lily Beth and I
make out together. Perhaps I can teach her to make pies." She was
smiling at the thought, and again the deep sense of pleasure
showed in her eyes.</p>

<p>Temperton watched her with his grave, restrained glance. "She
would like it a good deal," he said. "I'll bring her to you in
the morning." He lifted his hat and added: "I must find some way
of making this right with you."</p>

<p><br> Ollie Rounds stepped into The Pantheon, paused to locate
the prettiest woman and bought his ticket. When the new set began
he moved to the floor and claimed Lil Shannon. Most of these
miners danced with a kind of grim fury but this man, smiling with
his detached amusement, took her fashionably through the waltz.
Somewhere he had seen better company than this. But, although she
recognized background and breeding, she made no remark concerning
it, for in this camp were a thousand men whose pasts were made up
of sin and error and broken ties from which they fled and of
which they wanted no reminding. It was the first thing a woman in
a dance hall learned.</p>

<p>He said: "I might tell you how greatly you are wasting your
talents here, but I think I won't."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Lil Shannon.</p>

<p>"There's too much sober advice in the world. I was brought up
on duty and steady inculcations of usefulness and virtue. So now
I find the world well lost for frivolity. I have no desire to
leave monuments behind me. A fine day to live in, a meal to
enjoy, a little drink and the pleasure of a pretty woman. What
else is to be asked for?"</p>

<p>He was an engaging man, she conceded to herself, but these
ready talkers and these smiling men hid much; mostly they hid
from themselves. When the dance ended he escorted her to the bar
and paid for drinks. "That's a handsome dress," he said. "If I
were owner of a well-filled poke I'd scatter dust on it. It would
make a pretty glow."</p>

<p>"Don't let it trouble you. I have made fifty cents from the
dance. We're even."</p>

<p>He gave her a sudden intent look. "You don't like me, do
you?"</p>

<p>She was a diplomat. She smiled at him and turned away. "I
thought you didn't believe in being serious."</p>

<p>He left the dance hall and stood awhile with one shoulder
against the wall of Jack Tanner's saloon. He lighted a cigar and
savored its fragrance, at the same time realizing she hadn't
liked him at all. She had seen through him, as he so constantly
saw through himself. He moved the cigar between his teeth,
summoning back his air of detached amusement, and turned into
Tanner's. He ordered up a drink, remembering that he was close to
the end of his money; and he watched the game tables and plunged
a hand into his pocket and found a five-dollar gold piece. He
found a spot at the blackjack table and put his money into play.
The big, lean man had turned this trick at Lewiston; maybe he too
could turn it. He took his two cards and scanned them. He said:
"Hit," and watched a king fall, which broke his hand. He shrugged
his shoulders as he stepped away. Luck was a crazy thing which a
man had to endure without comment.</p>

<p>Rube Ketchum came into the saloon and paused against a wall
and at once Ollie Rounds pressed himself inconspicuously into the
crowd and laid his glance on the man. Rube was clearly on the
hunt and presently Rube's roving eyes settled on a small miner
half drunk at the end of the bar. The miner was at the moment
shaking dust out of his pouch to the bar scales; and when he had
done that he rolled through the crowd and left Tanner's.</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds slipped out of the saloon, knowing that Ketchum
would soon be following the miner to waylay and slug him. He saw
the miner turn from Wallace Street and fade into a part of town
scattered with tents. Rounds quickened his stride, crossed
Wallace's dust and skirted the tent restaurant's back side. Now
running on his toes, he made a quick circle of the nearest tents
and paused. Rube Ketchum would be soon coming up, and time got
short. He touched the small gun in his pocket, but he did not,
draw it; and he placed himself close to the edge of a tent,
hearing the miner thresh uncertainly forward. The man was talking
to himself in a reasoning way, he was saying: "Now Tom, turn here
and you're all right."</p>

<p>As he passed the corner of the tent, Ollie Rounds stepped
behind him, threw a forearm around his throat and flung a knee
against his back. The miner made a short cry and began to twist,
but by then Ollie had pulled the poke from the miner's pocket. He
gave the man a long shove and whipped about, racing between the
tents and at last coming behind a stable on Van Buren Street.</p>

<p>Here he stopped until his breathing had settled. He pulled his
coat together and stepped into Van Buren Street, entering the
nearest saloon. He took his drink quickly, and as he raised his
head he saw himself in the back bar mirror, and at once turned
his head away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; TEST OF STRENGTH</h2>

<p class="first">PIERCE cut alders from the top of the draw and
rolled them downhill to make his hut walls. He laid brush over
the walls, layer on layer interlaced, and stretched a tarp across
the brush for roof. He made a bunk frame with a pole bottom, used
grass and sage stems for a mattress, and tacked an empty box on
the wall for his groceries, adding a door to it to keep the
packrats away.</p>

<p>This was the work of one long day, first dawn to late dark.
Sitting in front of the cabin after supper, he faced the Gulch
with its lamp and lantern light aglitter and aglow from Virginia
City to the farther bend near Summit. Sound came out of the town
like the steady simmer of a boiler fire and even by night the
tide of travel never completely stopped. Wagons went by, and
single travelers; and there were men calling out the names of
other men. The mountain air, soft by day, now grew keen as wind
drifted down from the Tobacco Roots.</p>

<p>Next day he moved to the bottom of his claim and dug aside a
small section of top earth. He filled a bucket with coarser
subsoil and moved to the creek. Squatting in the water, he swung
and spilled the gravel from the edges of his pan, working the
residue down to black sand. In that first Pan he had one pea-
sized nugget and a scatter of colors. Barney Morris came over and
helped pan the rest of the bucket. "About a dollar," Barney said.
"When you get a little deeper you'll find it runs better."</p>

<p>"I'm going up the side of the ridge and cut in," Pierce said.
"Looks like the river might have banged up against the rocks and
laid down a deposit."</p>

<p>"Might have been," agreed Barney Morris. "You'll find pockets
in this country sometimes. Maybe a patch a foot square just as
yellow as the bottom side of a hound."</p>

<p>Pierce dug his holes in a line across the Gulch and up the
side of the hill. He made little dumps beside each hole and
worked the dumps one at a time and that day made four dollars.
After dark he went into town, bought a gold pouch, a wheel for a
barrow and a twenty-foot plank. He worked until midnight to rig
up a wheelbarrow. One wheelbarrow of dirt was, the same as eight
buckets and saved him that many trips back and forth to the
creek.</p>

<p>The next day he wheeled his load to the creek and panned
throughout the morning. Men came by in continual file, a
freighter passed with a load of lumber for Summit Camp. He struck
a good streak and made, eight dollars in three pans, and
remembered that this came from a hole halfway up the gulch wall.
The rest of the barrow didn't hold much. It went like that, fat
streaks and lean streaks. In the middle of the afternoon a
horseman pounded through the Gulch on the dead gallop, shouting
out his news:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dillingham's dead! They caught Hayes Lyons and Buck Stinson
and Charley Forbes! They're going to be tried right away! Go on
down there!" He batted his hat across the horse's ears and rushed
on.</p>

<p>It produced a general rush in the gulch. Miners left their
rockers and long toms and sluice boxes, and headed at once for
town. Barney Morris came by Pierce, who kept at his panning.
Pierce said: "Who's Dillingham?"</p>

<p>"One of Sheriff Plummer's deputies," said Barney Morris. "And
a square lad, too."</p>

<p>"Who're these other three fellows?"</p>

<p>"Charley Forbes is a loafer. Hayes Lyons is a damned
scoundrel. Buck Stinson is one of Plummer's four deputy sheriffs,
and a crook. You going down?"</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce. "Didn't Plummer know Stinson was a crook
when he made him deputy?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Morris, "I suppose he did. But it is kind of hard
to get a man to carry a star around here. Except for young
Dillingham, none of the honest ones cared to risk it. So I guess
Plummer appointed these hard eggs&mdash;the other deputies,
Gallegher and Ned Ray, are crooked too&mdash;on the idea it was
the best he could get."</p>

<p>He moved away with the crowd. Pierce resumed his work and was
for the rest of the afternoon almost alone in the Gulch. He had
finished his supper when the miners returned from Virginia City.
He sat in front of his shack, watching cook fires spring up and
shine on the creek. There was, he thought, less talk than usual
among the men. Barney Morris came out of the darkness to squat
and make his report.</p>

<p>"Young Dillingham was in the recorder's tent, helping Doc
Steele write out some mining records. Doc Steele's President of
the District. Forbes and Stinson and Hayes Lyons rode over from
Bannack. They came up to the tent and Lyons hollered out they
wanted to see Dillingham. Soon as he left the tent they opened
up." Barney Morris scowled as he recollected it. "Then Jack
Gallegher popped up from somewhere&mdash;he's one of Plummer's
deputies, like I told you, and no damned good either&mdash;and
took these three fellows into custody. I don't doubt he was on
their side but he had to make a show to the Gulch like he was
doin' his duty."</p>

<p>"What was it all about, Barney?"</p>

<p>"Dillingham was a square deputy, like I said. The other
three&mdash;Gallegher and Stinson and Ray&mdash;ain't. They got
him for some reason." He had a short pipe. He clenched it between
his teeth and sucked vigorously on it; he slapped a heavy hand on
his knee. "We'll go hang 'em for it. Trial started today. Doc
Steele and Doc Bissell and Sam Rutar are judges. You be there
tomorrow to vote on the right side. Those scoundrels have got a
lot of friends."</p>

<p>"I'll be there," said Pierce. He was still thinking of
Plummer, though, and made mention of it. "Strange that a sheriff
would pin stars on fellows like that."</p>

<p>Barney Morris rose. "Far as I know, Plummer is an honest man,
but if I was you, son, I don't believe I'd air my opinions much.
This is a tough gulch and it may get tougher. You be there in the
mornin'."</p>

<p>Pierce was. At nine o'clock he found himself in Virginia City,
surrounded by a thousand men from the other towns strung along
the Gulch&mdash;Summit and Virginia and Nevada and Central. They
filled Main Street, they moved to the hillside above the street
and sat like gallery fans on the rocky points. The three doctors,
Steele, Bissell and Rutar, were on a dais made by a wagon hauled
crosswise of the street. Stinson and Hayes Lyons were being tried
together, and at present their advocate was harking his
impassioned plea into the warm day. Barney Morris nudged Pierce.
"Two sheets in the wind now. Used to be a lawyer somewhere in the
East."</p>

<p>When the defense attorney rested, Ed Cutler, a blacksmith
appointed prosecutor for the occasion, got up and spoke less than
a minute. They were, he said, guilty beyond the shadow of any
reasonable man's doubt. It was cool murder, nothing less. They
should be convicted and they should be hung. That was all.
Steele, spokesman for the judges, rose on the wagon seat and had
some trouble speaking because of the sudden ripple of yelling and
hard-called defiance from the friends of Stinson and Lyons. Guns
flourished here and there. Steele waved his hands. "You've heard
the testimony, You're the jury. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>The discontent of the accused men's partisans was swamped by a
prolonged roar from the crowd. "Hang 'em!"</p>

<p>"Get the rope ready!"</p>

<p>"Where's Forbes&mdash;put him up for trial now!"</p>

<p>"Guilty!"</p>

<p>There was obviously no need of a more formal means of
determining the verdict. Steele turned to the men nearest the
wagon box. "Biedler, get a party to set up a gallows and to dig
two graves. Keep these prisoners under guard. Bring up Charley
Forbes for trial."</p>

<p>Appointed deputies led Stinson and Hayes Lyons away. Stinson
shouted his passionate curses at the crowd. Hayes Lyons was
laughing. Barney Morris noted that and spoke of it. "He don't
figure we've got the nerve to go through with it. These toughs
have gall."</p>

<p>The defense attorney now rose to make a long plea for Charley
Forbes, bearing down on the fact that Forbes had cried, "Don't
shoot," at the very moment the firing had started. It showed his
will in the matter, the defense attorney said. As a point of
fact, he went on, Charley Forbes hadn't fired. His gun, reclaimed
by the court, had all its loads intact.</p>

<p>"Sure," grumbled Barney Morris. "Some friend of Forbes sneaked
in and reloaded it after the shootin', An old stunt."</p>

<p>But the crowd, having gone through a morning of drama, grew
better-natured. The toughs and sympathizers in the street began
to set up a cry for pity and fair play, against which Ed Cutler
talked with less effect. Afterwards young Forbes stepped to the
edge of the wagon box and made his own appeal. He had a good
voice and he had a frank air. He spoke of his family, he admitted
minor sins and was ready to admit his waywardness, but he denied
the murder and spoke for mercy. When Doc Steele got up and
said:</p>

<p>"What's your verdict, gentlemen?" the crowd was clearly for
acquittal and shouted it. Forbes lifted a hand at the crowd, slid
down from the wagon and at once vanished. Within three minutes
Jeff Pierce saw Forbes, mounted on a horse, swing into Daylight
Grade and ride over the hill.</p>

<p>Meanwhile X. Biedler had returned with his work party, having
erected a gallows and dug the two graves. Doc Steele silenced the
crowd with his hand and said in a deep, slow voice: "I sentence
you, Hayes Lyons, and you, Buck Stinson, to be hanged," and
descended from the wagon. He made his way into the crowd, visibly
moved by the responsibility he had been through. The crowd was
restive again, shifting and turning and unsettled. Men began to
move through it, loudly calling for; "Fair play," and for a new
trial. One man broke a trail with his shoulders, swinging his gun
in the air. "They won't hang Hayes and Buck while I've got
breath!" Somewhere else a sudden commotion sprang up. Pierce
stood up on a pile of lumber in time to see Rube Ketchum make a
dive at a miner and swing with his fists. Surrounding men moved
in, throwing Ketchum back. Ketchum drew his gun and swept a clean
circle with it until he stood alone. "Don't touch me, anybody,"
he said. "Don't touch me. I'm a friend of those fellows. To hell
with you yellow ditch-diggers!"</p>

<p>"Rube," called an even voice. "Rube, put up the gun." Lifting
his eyes, Pierce found a man lying flat on the scaffolding of an
incompleted house with a rifle centered on Ketchum. "Rube," he
repeated, "put it down and be civilized or I'll fumigate
you."</p>

<p>A party of miners drove a team and wagon forward.</p>

<p>Biedler and some others boosted the two sentenced men aboard
and made a rank around them. "All right&mdash;all right," called
Biedler, "clear the way. No use talking all day on this." The
miners spread and the wagon pitched slowly down the slope toward
the gallows constructed at the foot of the street.</p>

<p>Silence moved into the town, through which rose the steady
beat of a hammer operated by some industrious man who ignored
this high drama. Stinson grasped the side of the wagon, shutting
his jaws together so tightly that the hard bone ridges turned
white. Women from the dance halls scrambled up the hillside for a
fairer view and one man's voice called: "So-long, boys. It's a
damned shame!"</p>

<p>Hayes Lyons, who had laughed at them all, now let out a great,
choked cry that went up through the silence like a strangled
gasp, and suddenly a woman on the hillside began to scream. "Let
them live! Don't hang the poor boys! Don't kill them!"</p>

<p>It set off a tremendous crying and moaning among the women.
Men began to grumble. A tall, lithe figure leaped to a wagon
wheel and wrenched at it; he threw himself into the wagon and
seized the reins, bringing the team to a halt. He waved a piece
of paper at the crowd. "Let me read this letter Hayes wrote to
his mother!"</p>

<p>"Go ahead!"</p>

<p>"Read it&mdash;read it!"</p>

<p>Watching this man closely&mdash;for it was George
Ives&mdash;Pierce saw him show deep emotion as he lifted the
letter, and cleared his throat:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dearest Mother:</span></p>

<p class="letter">I am writing you on my last day on earth. I
have been condemned to be hung for a shooting scrape
here&mdash;something that God knows I repent with all my heart. I
guess I went blind crazy. I know I am causing you the greatest
grief of your life and if I have not broken your heart before
this with my wild ways I expect this will break it now. Tell my
sisters that I love them dearly. Tell my brothers to stay away
from cards and liquor. I wish I had it to do over again so that I
could follow your dear teachings...</p>

<p><br>
The dance-hall girls were crying in steady, increasing
volume. One of them raced down the slope and fell and got up
again and pushed through the crowd. She dropped in the dust by
the wagon. "Hayes," she cried, "I'll give my life for you!
Hayes&mdash;"

<p>The crowd, slowly flooded by this cataract of tears, found a
shamed and half-hearted voice. "Hell," said a man, "let 'em
live."</p>

<p>"Give him a horse and let him go to his mother!"</p>

<p>"Let's have another trial!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! Don't waste no more time. Let's take another
vote."</p>

<p>"Another vote!"</p>

<p>Biedler stood grim and formidable on the wagon tongue. "You
voted already!"</p>

<p>"Take another vote!"</p>

<p>Biedler tried to speak, but the gathering sentiment swept him
away. All he could do was stand and stare. A man got up on the
wagon and asked for silence. "All in favor of hanging, walk up
the hill. All in favor of letting them go, walk down the
road."</p>

<p>"What the hell's the use of walking up a hill?" The cries of
the women continued on, wild and passionate, and hard on the
nerves. Men screwed up their faces at the sound of it; and men
openly cried. Confusion increased around the wagon. George Ives
still faced the crowd, gravely holding up his hands in appeal. A
self-appointed committee drew another wagon beside the first and
a spokesman stepped before the crowd. "Everybody that wants a
hanging, go past the outside wagon to be counted! Those against
will go past the inside wagon!"</p>

<p>The crowd found this a simple procedure and moved in mass
toward the wagons. Barney Morris pushed his way toward the
outside wagon and wigwagged at Pierce to follow. But Pierce stood
fast. From his place on the lumber pile he saw the crowd swing
heavily past the inside wagon and knew that these two toughs
would be free. Men, having voted once, slipped through to be
counted a second time. A few minutes later Jack Gallegher,
Plummer's deputy in the Gulch, sprang up to a wagon seat and
yelled: "They're free! Let 'em go!"</p>

<p>Lyons and Stinson jumped from the wagon and were immediately
surrounded by their supporters. The woman who had groveled in the
dust now laughingly arose and seized Stinson's arm and the dance-
hall girls on the hill ceased their wailing and composedly
marched toward town. The play was over. Pierce smiled one dark
short smile and joined Barney Morris. George Ives made his way
through the crowd, grinning to himself. He winked at Barney and
said cheerfully, "We skinned that cat, old man," and afterwards
he caught sight of Pierce and instantly the cheerfulness turned
cold. The memory of a defeat came to this arrogant man and the
memory stung him. He put his long stare on Pierce; he said,
"You're here," and abruptly he wheeled away to join Stinson and
Hayes and Gallegher. These four now marched loosely toward
Tanner's saloon, surrounded by their partisans. Meanwhile the
crowd, surfeited with drama, slowly moved away.</p>

<p>Biedler came up to Pierce and Barney Morris. Biedler was a
stocky Dutchman with a bulldog face and a capacity for black
anger. He was full of it now, and savagely exclaimed: "They cried
for a pair of scoundrels! I wonder if any of them remembered to
cry for Dillingham?" He had a shotgun in his hand. He banged the
butt of it on the ground and he pointed to the gallows at the
foot of the street and ground out his observation. "There stands
a monument to defeated justice."</p>

<p>Other men gradually joined this group. A tall fellow with a
dense black beard arrived and Barney introduced him to Pierce.
"This is A. J. Oliver, Jeff. This is Jeff Pierce."</p>

<p>"The gentleman," commented Oliver, "who knocked down Rube. I
heard of that."</p>

<p>Presently W. B. Dance came forward with a man of lesser
height. This one wore a short set of chin whiskers on a dark,
dreaming, melancholy face; and he had a kind of silence that was
as effective as speech. He stood by, carefully listening, and now
and then when other men turned the talk his way he only nodded or
shook his head. Pierce observed that the group seemed to value
his presence. In a little while this meeting broke apart and
Pierce strolled through Wallace with Barney. Barney was in a
thoughtful and depressed mood and from time to time shook his
head. "An honest man can't expect much from now on. The toughs
are in the saddle. They know it, too."</p>

<p>"It was a touching scene," Pierce dryly observed. "They're
smart people, Barney, and it is the smart people who run the
world."</p>

<p>"Too bad&mdash;too bad," said Barney.</p>

<p>Tanner's, when they passed it, was in full swing. Pierce
murmured: "The victors are celebrating." Neither of them said
anything more during the half-mile walk up-Gulch. Pierce went on
to his cabin, cooked supper, and sat outside the doorway in the
dark, enjoying a cigar. Riders traveled the Gulch and all the
sounds of men drifted clear and full through the bland summer
night's air. Long later, around ten o'clock, he heard the
advancing scrape of a man's feet and he rose and stood back
against the cabin wall until he identified Barney Morris. Barney
said in a dropped voice: "Let's go inside, Jeff."</p>

<p>Jeff followed him into the cabin and closed the door. He
lighted a lantern and turned on Barney, now observing Barney's
extreme gravity. "Ketchum passed my cabin a little while ago,"
said Barney. "I know what that means. They think I've got money,
and now they're bold. I've got to leave."</p>

<p>"Bunk here," said Jeff.</p>

<p>"If they're of a notion to get me, they'll do it sooner or
later. No, I've got to leave." He took out his pipe and made a
business of filling and lighting it. The match was steady in his
hand but he was, nevertheless, in the grip of fear. It showed on
him. "I'm a marked man, Jeff. I can't ride from here to Bannack
without being held up. I can't get on a horse and pull out
tonight, either. They're watching. I'll have to sneak off afoot.
Maybe I can reach Bannack. Maybe I can get beyond Bannack, Then
I'd fall in with some freight outfit on the way to Salt Lake and
I'd be tolerably safe."</p>

<p>"Want help, Barney?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Barney Morris, "I do. Whether I make it through or
not, I want my dust to get through. The family can be comfortable
on what I've dug out of this country. I'll give you a hundred
dollars to carry it to Bannack for me. Nobody's watching you yet.
You haven't been here long enough to have any money. So you can
ride as you please. Take the dust to Bannack and leave it at
Oliver's stage office. I'll start walking tonight. I'll pick the
dust up at Bannack, if I have the luck to get there."</p>

<p>"All right, Barney. But I don't want your hundred
dollars."</p>

<p>"Why, son, I thought you disbelieved in sentiment."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in anything very much, Barney. But you did me
a favor."</p>

<p>"That's more sentiment than you figure," said Barney Morris.
He moved to the lantern and turned the wick until the room was
half dark. He reached into his coat pockets and hefted out six
gold pokes and tossed them on Pierce's bunk. "That's my stake,
Jeff. Forty pounds, more or less, of sweat and trouble&mdash;and
not as much fun as I thought it would be. I been away from my
family too long. Now listen to me. You tell Oliver's agent that
if I don't show up in Bannack three days from now to send it on
to Mary Morris, Centerville, Ohio."</p>

<p>"I'll think of you under your fig tree in Centerville," jaid
Jeff.</p>

<p>"I like people around me," said Barney Morris. "I don't like
to be alone. If I had it to do over again I'd never have left my
family. The money ain't worth it. Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Luck," said Jeff.</p>

<p>The older man nodded. He watched Pierce a moment, hiding his
sentiment, then turned back to his own tent. He lighted his
lantern in his tent and hunted up a pencil and paper and composed
two letters. One was for his wife, which he sealed and put in his
pocket. The other was a will, upon which he spent considerable
time. Afterwards he gathered his belongings, though he took
nothing that could not be comfortably carried in his pockets.</p>

<p>He wished, as he trudged down the Gulch, that he knew more
about Pierce. Out in a country like this a man depended almost
entirely upon himself, and so took little trouble to study
others; therefore when a man really needed help he had to make a
quick guess and trust in faith. It always came back to a matter
of faith. No man was sufficient unto himself, but out here nobody
knew that. The strong were proud and didn't understand. It was
the weak and the needy who understood. It was too bad he could
not pass on to Jeff Pierce his own wisdom in the matter; for the
young man was sound and needed only something to soften his
hardness.</p>

<p>He struck the back side of Virginia, circled to the camp to
Doc Steele's tent and scratched on it. The judge's light was
burning, and the judge called out: "Come in."</p>

<p>"Sorry to trouble you," said Barney. "Here's my will. If I
show up missing the next few months this is what I want done with
my claim."</p>

<p>The Doctor looked grave. "What's up, Barney?"</p>

<p>He had known Doc Steele as long as he had known any man in the
Gulch but he could not break his attitude of secrecy, and now
only smiled. "Just a matter of forethought. The toughs feel
mighty strong. Those two fellows ought to have been hung."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Steele, "they should have been."</p>

<p>"Good night, Doc," said Barney. He left the tent, turned
between the rows of brush wickiups and tents along the margin of
town, and so arrived at the road which climbed Daylight Grade.
Later at the top of the grade he stopped to take his bearings.
Central City was a quarter mile forward, through which this road
ran, but he struck into the hills to avoid the town and at last
left the Gulch entirely. As he climbed the rough slopes he had
certain inexpressibly regretful thoughts. He was an old, played-
out man longing for his people, whom he might never again see.
The sense of adventure had gone sour, the game had turned
bitter.</p>



<p><br> There was a man in Virginia City known as Clubfoot George
Lane, a shoemaker who set up a bench in whatever niche the town
afforded and did his work and took his rather low spot in the
community without comment; and this man, nighthawking through the
town, saw Barney Morris go into Doc Steele's tent and later come
out. Clubfoot followed until the latter faded beyond Daylight
Grade, then went limping toward Tanner's saloon as rapidly as he
could. He found Ketchum and passed on his information; ten
minutes later Ketchum, Steve Marshland and George Ives moved over
Daylight to the crest, and rode the Gulch steadily downgrade
toward the Stinkingwater. This was the route to Bannack, and no
matter what detours Barney Morris made he would eventually have
to come out of the hills beyond the Stinkingwater or the
Beaverhead.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; ON THE BANNACK
ROAD</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER early breakfast, Pierce saddled his horse
and turned down the Gulch with the six heavy gold pouches tight-
rolled in a slicker lashed behind the saddle. A brilliant sun
rose from behind the Tobacco Root Mountains, turning the land to
first gray-gold; and early as it was the road held the steady-
risen dust of travel. He passed horsemen and single men hiking,
and strings of freighters drawing high-piled merchandise, and now
and then a fancy woman driving a light rig through morning's
cool. From Central onward the road was a continuous noisy street
connecting all the towns as far as Junction, where Alder and
Granite Creeks met. Beyond Junction the canyon grew narrow and
rugged to Daly's Roadhouse on Ramshorn Creek. Here, fourteen
miles from Virginia, the road passed from the Gulch, into the
Stinkingwater's small valley, ran past Cold Springs Ranch and
reached Baker's Ranch. At Baker's he found Ben Scoggins resting
in the shade of a wagon and four-horse team.</p>

<p>"Why, now," said Scoggins, "I'm pleased to see you again.
Where you at?"</p>

<p>"Up the Gulch, near Virginia."</p>

<p>"Virginia's where I'm going," said Scoggins, equably. "After
you left I did some trading around. Got this wagon and these
horses. Knew I could sell anything in this country. It was just a
matter of what kind of goods I could make the best turn on. I got
sardines."</p>

<p>"Whole wagonload?"</p>

<p>"Four thousand cans. Sort of a tasty article a hungry miner
would buy any time. No waste space&mdash;you can crowd a lot of
sardines in a wagon. I'll start up the Gulch and I'll just holler
as I go. Dollar a can."</p>

<p>"Luck," said Pierce, preparing to go.</p>

<p>"I never bank much on luck," answered Ben Scoggins.</p>

<p>He lifted his gray-blue eyes, his shrewd and humorous eyes.
"Your wife&mdash;she's here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pierce, and went on.</p>

<p>Beyond Baker's he forded the Stinkingwater and arrived at
Dempsey's, which was a stage relay point. The road, nothing more
than a pair of ruts in the hard earth, lifted from the
Stinkingwater to low bluffs and ran westward over a series of
barren undulating hills. North of him at a distance stood the
McCarty Mountains, across which he had come with Diana Castle a
few days before. Southward the Rubys lay high against a brilliant
sky. The air was thin and rich with grass smell. Fourteen miles
from Stinkingwater he skirted Copeland's Ranch on the Beaverhead,
and continued to Stone's. Here he stopped and ate noon meal in
the roadhouse bar, loafed a comfortable half-hour, and forded the
Beaverhead. At three o'clock he came into Bill Bunton's ranch,
another relay point for the stages. This was on the Rattlesnake;
and Bunton, a long and slack man, came out of a corral to give
Pierce a careful sizing-up.</p>

<p>"How's the color at Virginia?" asked Bunton. "I hear it is
rich dirt."</p>

<p>"Fair, I guess," answered Pierce. "Just came in myself. This
the road to Bannack?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Bunton. "Ten miles down that way." The man's eyes
inquisitively rummaged Pierce, his horse, and his gear. "Business
in Bannack?"</p>

<p>"Just looking around," offered Pierce and moved on. A quarter-
mile down the road he swung in the saddle to observe that Bunton
was still watching him. The road, moving southwest, took the easy
way through a bare dry country of shallow gulches and dry
streambeds, through sage, and short grass and scattered rock.
Pierce struck a creek marked with prospect holes and gravel pile,
and turned with it, so coming into Bannack around five that
evening. This town had been a year or more established and once
had held a considerable population. Born overnight of a gold
strike on Grasshopper Creek, it had recently surrendered its
vitality to the newer camps in Alder Gulch.</p>

<p>A sign identified Oliver's stage office, but Pierce, not
wishing to make his mission too obvious, drew up before Durand's
saloon and went in for a drink. A hotel stood next door. Going to
it&mdash;with eight thousand dollars standing at the curb on the
back of the horse&mdash;he washed, had supper and came to the
street to light and idly nourish a cigar while twilight arrived
and the citizens of the town sat along the walks and Durand's
saloon began to grow noisy. One gentleman, nicely dressed and
with a round face marked by a well-kept mustache, came past him
and looked at him, half sharp and half pleasant, and strolled
on.</p>

<p>He finished his smoke and rode to the stage office, which
still remained open. He unfastened the thongs holding the
slicker, carried it inside and rolled the six heavy gold pouches
on the counter before a clerk.</p>

<p>The clerk's reaction was somewhat odd. First glancing at the
open doorway, he quickly hauled the gold pouches from the counter
and carried them to a safe.</p>

<p>"I'll take a receipt," said Pierce. "That belongs to Barney
Morris. He is to claim it as soon as it arrives. If he doesn't
arrive within three days you're to ship it to Mary Morris,
Centerville, Ohio. You got that?"</p>

<p>The clerk wrote out a receipt in a flourishing, upright hand.
"Barney's on the way now?"</p>

<p>"Started last night."</p>

<p>The clerk gave Pierce the receipt. "You're leaving town
soon?"</p>

<p>"I'll wait for Barney. He should be along."</p>

<p>"If I were you&mdash;" said the clerk, and closed his mouth
upon the rest of his advice. Somebody strolled down the walk and
turned in; and the neat, round-faced man who had earlier passed
Pierce now came forward. He had black clothes and a white shirt
and a string tie carefully put together, and he drew out a cigar
and smiled on both men, pleasantly. "Nice evening, Harry."</p>

<p>"That's right," said the clerk.</p>

<p>The man turned to Pierce. "I don't think I have met you. My
name's Henry Plummer. I'm Sheriff of Bannack and
Fairweather."</p>

<p>"Pierce," said Jeff, and offered his hand. The Sheriff's grip
was light and quick. He found another cigar and presented it to
Pierce. "I have been giving these out rather freely the last few
days, having just been married. From Alder Gulch?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"Hear you had trouble over there. Dillingham was a fine boy.
Makes it difficult for me to know what to do about Stinson. One
of my deputies, you know. Hard to believe he'd do a thing like
that unless his hand was forced. Boys over there released him, so
I guess they figured he had something on his side."</p>

<p>"Suppose so," agreed Pierce, adding nothing, offering nothing.
The Sheriff's hazel eyes scanned Pierce with a light and
searching attention. He was smiling and he was cordial. "If
there's ever anything I can help you at, let me know," he said,
and left the stage office.</p>

<p>The clerk took up his pad and fell to writing in the same
steady, up-and-down hand. He seemed busy. Pierce lighted the
Sheriff's gift cigar and looked down at that traveling pen. The
clerk was writing, over and over: "Montana-Montana-Montana."
Pierce pulled smoke into his lungs and blew it out. The pen made
a steady scratching echo, in the silent room; outer sounds moved
in. The clerk looked up with a brief irritation. "Something
else?"</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce, and left the office.</p>

<p>He was on the dark side of Bannack's street. He moved through
these shadows, leaving a wake of cigar smoke behind. Durand's
saloon, directly across the way, was an eruption of light and
confusion. Men came steadily into town. The Sheriff was ahead of
Pierce and now he crossed the street and came back with every
mark of indolence; he stopped at the saloon and looked through
the doorway awhile and seemed to debate with himself, and at last
went in. Pierce halted and leaned a shoulder to a wall. A woman
and a small girl passed him and swung into a store; three riders
entered town, rounded before Durand's, and dismounted. When they
faced the light from the saloon's doorway, Pierce recognized
Ketchum and Ives. He didn't know the third one.</p>

<p>He remembered that his horse was still standing by the stage
office; and he had forgotten his slicker. He grunted to himself
and moved back. When he stepped into the stage office the clerk
pulled up his head and for that one slim interval Pierce saw fear
unsteady the man. A wagon came clacking into the street. Pierce
got the slicker and turned out with it; when he reached the
sidewalk he noticed the wagon had stopped near by. Two men got
off the seat and came to the tail gate and other men moved
forward from the night. Somebody said: "What you got,
George?"</p>

<p>"Dead man."</p>

<p>"Where'd you find him?"</p>

<p>"Four-five miles out in the brush, shortcutting over from the
Rattlesnake."</p>

<p>The two lifted the dead man from the wagon and brought him to
the walk. Pierce found himself on the outer edge of the crowd,
and used his shoulders to push through; looking down, he saw
Barney Morris lying there, a bullet hole passing through his
head, temple to temple.</p>

<p>One of the men said: "Better call Plummer."</p>

<p>"Why," said one of the men who had brought Barney Morris in,
"a dead man's just a dead man. You call Plummer."</p>

<p>Another figure pushed into the circle. "Hell, that's Barney
Morris. He used to work a claim next to mine, down
Grasshopper."</p>

<p>Plummer was at this moment coming out of Durand's saloon.
Pierce withdrew from the crowd and stood at the sidewalk's edge
with his head pulled down by his quick and angered thoughts. He
moved to his horse, got to the saddle, and rode to the street's
end, here pausing. Plummer had come into the circle. Pierce heard
him say: "That's Barney Morris, one of my best friends!" The
crowd grew. Looking beyond it, Pierce noticed Ketchum and Ives
and the third man paused at the doorway of Durand's. He touched
his spurs to the horse and went on out of Bannack at a trot. The
horse was stiff with his day's work and had little run left in
him and kept falling back to a walk, and had to be spurred, He
passed Bunton's and near midnight came to the Beaverhead. Here he
made a dry camp well away from the road.</p>



<p><br> Ives patronized Durand's bar with Steve Marshland and
Ketchum until the crowd came back. Some miner said:</p>

<p>"Old Barney had a lot of money and never spent any. He had a
good claim on Alder. I heard once he had fifty thousand
buried."</p>

<p>"Not a dime on him now."</p>

<p>Ives looked wryly at his empty glass and put it aside. He said
to Marshland and Ketchum: "Come on." The three of them left the
saloon and walked as far as the corner of the hotel. They turned
down a side street, saying nothing. Half a dozen houses fronted
this side street; beyond that was a corral and a shed and the
slope of a bold hill. The three stopped at the shed and leaned
against it. "This the place?" asked Marshland.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Ives.</p>

<p>Boots cracked against loose rocks on the other side of the
shed and a shape circled the shed's corner, lightly advancing.
The shape stood before them, medium and slim&mdash;and Henry
Plummer's voice said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"All right?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ives. "He had nothing on him but a single
eagle."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't leave the country without his dust."</p>

<p>"Maybe he sent it out by express."</p>

<p>"No," said Plummer. "Clubfoot's watched Barney all the time.
Barney didn't send it that way." He remained still, doing his own
calculating. "But there was a man in here tonight who stopped off
at the stage office. He carried a slicker into the stage office.
It appeared to be heavy. When I went in the slicker was open on
the counter."</p>

<p>"Tall man?" said Ives.</p>

<p>"Name was Pierce. You know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ives, "I know him."</p>

<p>"It is probably in the stage office then," said Plummer
calmly. "But we can't afford to touch it there. We'll wait and
watch. I'll handle that. You boys go back to the Gulch."</p>

<p>"Where's Pierce now?" asked Ives.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen him around," said Plummer. He turned away. A few
feet off, he paused to say, softly. "About Pierce&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll take care of him," said Ives.</p>

<p>Rising before daylight, Pierce made the long run into Virginia
City by three o'clock. When he reached Wallace Street he saw
Steele. The Doctor hailed him.</p>

<p>"Where's Barney? I saw him last night and he seemed in
trouble."</p>

<p>"Killed on the Bannack Road last night."</p>

<p>The Doctor showed some amount of shock. "He knew it was
coming. Come to my wickiup. I've got something for you."</p>

<p>Pierce left the horse and returned to Steele's tent. Steele
got a huge Bible from a box and opened it, producing a single
sheet of paper. "This is what Barney left with me last night," he
said.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">I, Barney Morris, sound of mind but uncertain
of the future, am about to leave the Gulch and go to my home in
Ohio. I ought to be in Bannack tomorrow night. If I am not I can
be considered dead. In which event I empower the judge of
Fairweather District to make the following disposition of my
claim, Number Fourteen above Discovery. This claim is to be given
to one Jeff Pierce, he to have it entirely, to work it fitly and
in proper season; he to send half of what he pans out to my wife,
Mary Morris, Centerville, Ohio.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE WILD BUNCH</h2>

<p class="first">THE first shacks and tents in the Gulch began
near the junction of Granite and Alder creek. As soon as Ben
Scoggins reached this spot he stood up in the wagon and began to
sing out: "Somethin' fancy to go with beans and bacon! Sardines
straight from the Coast! Dollar a throw! Come and get it!"</p>

<p>As he had shrewdly judged, there was never enough of anything
in a new camp. Men came out of the creek at him; they ran down
the hillslopes. Tying down the reins to the brake
handle&mdash;the horses moving and stopping and moving&mdash;Ben
disbursed sardines from the tail gate all the way up from
Junction settlement. He was sold out by the time he topped
Daylight's ridge and looked down upon Virginia City. In his
pocket and in his pouch he had four thousand dollars more or less
in gold and coin and dust. This was the middle of the afternoon
with sunlight making a pretty sight of Virginia and the upper
Gulch. He was a blond young man standing in the wagon with his
hat brim jiggling as the wagon took the grade, smiling a rawboned
smile at a good and just world; and even in smiling, not
forgetting to cast a competent glance at the possibilities around
him. Coming into Wallace, driving his outfit through the
congestion of other wagons and lumber piles and loose horses, he
paused by the scaffolding of an incomplete structure. There was a
man standing by with the attitude of business about him,
whereupon Ben Scoggins, always with a mind to business, hailed
him.</p>

<p>"Need any haulin' done?"</p>

<p>The man turned as though struck. "Yes," he said. "There's a
whipsaw outfit working over near Bannack. What'll you charge to
freight lumber here?"</p>

<p>"How far's Bannack?"</p>

<p>"Seventy miles."</p>

<p>"Two days each way. Four days around trip." He gave the man a
swift size-up. "Hundred and fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"Good God," said the man, then shrugged his shoulders.
"Everybody's so damned crazy about digging they got no time for
day work. All right."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ben Scoggins, and drove on. To himself he
added: "Might as well be workin' while I'm lookin' and listenin'.
Never hurts to keep busy."</p>

<p>He had turned into Wallace Street and now saw Diana Castle
coming out of the tent restaurant. He lifted a strong whoop into
the day. "Well, you're here!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Diana, smiling because he smiled.</p>

<p>Scoggins reached under the wagon seat and pulled out four cans
of sardines. "You got a birthday coming?"</p>

<p>"Next December," she said.</p>

<p>He said, "Happy birthday," and presented her with the
sardines. "Where's the tall, hungry-looking fellow?"</p>

<p>"Up the Gulch on a claim."</p>

<p>He noticed she left off smiling when Pierce was mentioned.
There was something out of order here; whereupon he covered up
the awkwardness by going easily on to other things.</p>

<p>"Nice day&mdash;nice year. Well, nice. See you again." He cut
around Wallace into another street of tents, heading back toward
Bannack. Near the edge of town he passed a blacksmith shop and
got a call from a man there.</p>

<p>"Want to sell that outfit?"</p>

<p>"Whoa," said Ben Scoggins. "Whoa." He braked the wagon and
settled on the seat. "I'll sell anything, any time. Buyin' and
sellin's my trade. What you offerin'?"</p>

<p>"What you want?"</p>

<p>"No," said Scoggins, idle and innocent, "you set a
figure."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later he had concluded a deal. By this time
the open-air transaction had attracted half a dozen idle men, one
of which was Ollie Rounds. Going inside the stable&mdash;which
was a log house with a brush roof&mdash;to consummate the sale,
young Scoggins gravely winked at Ollie Rounds. In a little while
he came out of the stable. Rounds joined him and they walked on
alone. "You're here, too," commented Scoggins. "Got a claim?"</p>

<p>"Never liked to shovel," said Ollie Rounds. "Every time I see
you, you're dickering."</p>

<p>"The idea," said Ben Scoggins, "is to pass a dollar back and
forth a lot of times. Each time, of course, gettin' a little bit
of the dollar to stick. Business is mighty simple if a man
remembers that. If he don't remember it, everything's
complicated."</p>

<p>"Trouble with that idea," said Rounds, "is that if a piece
sticks to everybody pretty soon the dollar is all gone."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Scoggins, "that's where you're wrong. A dollar is
like a shovel or a machine. A man uses it to make something. Then
he passes it on and the next man makes something. By the time it
gets around the circle it has left a lot of new things behind it.
And it is still a dollar. That is all you got to remember. But
some folks don't have the knack of usin' a dollar to make things
with."</p>

<p>Both of them laughed. "Bound to get rich, ain't you?" said
Ollie Rounds.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds quit smiling. He gave Ben Scoggins a direct look.
"Then don't pack your money in your hip pocket, Ben. This is a
tough camp."</p>

<p>Scoggins searched and weighed Ollie with his candid glance.
"You always got an ear out for that sort of thing, Ollie. I thank
you for the warnin'. But," and he added this in a careful way,
"it would be better for you not to take such an interest in the
shady side. Someday it might sort of draw you down."</p>

<p>"Always liked to see what goes on beneath the
surface&mdash;the things other people do not see."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," gently reflected Ben Scoggins, "it is better not
to look in that direction." He went on down the road and up over
Daylight grade. Striking through the sinuous and lusty course of
the Gulch, he reached Junction at twilight and, as he had
expected, found a line of newcomers camped beside the creek. He
picked out a wagon and found its owner. "Want to sell?" he
asked.</p>

<p>At full dark he had made his deal. Possessed of a new wagon
and team he continued down the Gulch, not really remembering he
had no supper. The day had been good and profitable. Now he
struck out for Bannack, his cheerful whistle making an uneven
bouncing echo on the narrow rock walls of the lower Gulch.</p>



<p><br> Ollie Rounds returned to Tanner's saloon and stood at the
bar to enjoy his before-supper drink. The big tent now began to
fill and the poker tables were all operating. Marshland loitered
near the door. Ketchum and George Ives sat in a game, and Will
Temperton dealt at another; and it was on Temperton's unbreakable
front that Ollie placed his interest. Everything struck that
grave, steel-smooth face and slid aside without making
impression. He was a sad man whose sadness, Ollie thought, came
from his own defects of temper. Somewhere in Temperton, as in
himself, there was a wire down, so that all his life was out of
rhyme and badness and goodness warred. Men were like this. Only
once in a rare while did Rounds find someone in whom the purposes
of living were clear and uncomplicated and sweet. Those men he
envied because they had something he did not have, never would
have.</p>

<p>Ketchum and Ives came to the bar for a drink. Ollie Rounds
took his second whisky and shook out dust from his gold pouch to
pay for it; and left the saloon. He went down to the tent
restaurant and had supper. Corning out, he saw Diana Castle
leaving the back side of the restaurant with Lily Beth. Lily Beth
had on an apron and there was a streak of flour in her hair; she
looked tired but she looked contented. Ollie Rounds, who had a
way with people, drew a smile from her and fell in step beside
Diana.</p>

<p>"That was good apple pie I had tonight," he said.</p>

<p>"I made fifty-three today. Forty apple, ten apricot, three
prune."</p>

<p>"Get a little tired of wrestling over that stove?"</p>

<p>"Why should I be tired?"</p>

<p>He smiled without his usual irony. "I guess it is the way you
look at the world. Whenever I do something I keep asking myself,
'Why should I be doing this? What's the good of it?' And then I
quit working." He gave her a quick glance. "Why are you
working?"</p>

<p>"It's nice to be alive, Ollie. Nice to be free and able to
make your own way. And it is wonderful to feel you're in the
place where things are happening, and you're part of all that's
happening."</p>

<p>"What's happening?" he said. "Just people going around and
around."</p>

<p>"No, Ollie. Here are people who have rushed from the ends of
the earth. They're working and cursing and fighting, swimming
rivers and being lost in storms, and laughing, and being killed;
and writing letters at night to their people back home. Some of
them are lonely, sometimes they're afraid, sometimes ashamed of
the things they do, but still they grit their teeth and take
their punishment and go on. People who sit still in their houses
grow stale and weak. These men, bad as some of them may be, are
really alive. Why, you can hear the stamp of their feet all the
way back to the Atlantic."</p>

<p>He slowly shook his head. "Wish I could feel like that. And I
hope you always feel like that."</p>

<p>They had come to her log hut at the edge of the camp. Lily
Beth reached out and took Diana's hand, and these two stood at
the hut's doorway, grave and silent and together. Diana said:
"Now we've got to put the washtub on the stove. It is bath
night."</p>

<p>"Hear about Jeff?"</p>

<p>There was a lessening of the warmth of her eyes, a tightening
at the edge of her mouth. She seemed to harden herself to what he
might say. "No," she said, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"The road agents didn't find any money on Barney Morris
because Jeff carried it through to Bannack. The road agents have
got Jeff marked for that."</p>

<p>She said in clipped words. "I'm sorry. He deserves to be let
alone. He wants to be let alone."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds lifted his hat and moved back toward the
sparkling, confused heart of camp. He slid through a line of
freight wagons, cut around a blacksmith shop and reached the
lower end of Van Buren Street. A pair of men stepped out of a
space between tents, and one of them said: "Hold on, Rounds," and
he jerked around and saw Ives and Ketchum before him.</p>

<p>Ives said, "Walk along with us, friend."</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;maybe not," Ollie Rounds answered. He was rooted
in his tracks. His eyes turned blacker and his face grew thin; he
held his stiff smile against them. "What for?"</p>

<p>"No harm," said Ives and stepped beside him. Ketchum was
already at Ollie Rounds' other elbow; and the pressure of these
two men moved him forward along the walk. They passed through the
shuttered lights, they moved out of the heavy crowd. At the foot
of Van Buren, in the shadows, Ives turned.</p>

<p>"You been flashing a poke in Tanner's, friend. You're no
miner. I'd like to see that poke."</p>

<p>"No," answered Ollie Rounds, "I guess not."</p>

<p>George Ives said: "Don't be tough. You recall what happened to
Barney Morris?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," retorted Ollie Rounds. "Use your gun. You'll have
a crowd on your neck."</p>

<p>"What crowd?" asked George Ives. "What crowd came when
Dillingham fell? What crowd tried to stop Lyons and Stinson when
they rode out of town? You're wrong. This town is ours and nobody
touches us. Let's see that poke."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds looked carefully at these men. George Ives had an
expression of lazy, idle interest on him; he was pleased with
himself and he was amused at Rounds's resistance. But Rube
Ketchum, savage and brutal to the core, without scruples or
conscience, instinctively a hater of everything, showed greedy
desire. Rounds recognized that glance and knew he was in great,
immediate danger. He lifted the poke from his pocket and weighed
it in his hand. His thoughts then were swift and calculating; he
balanced his life in his mind and suddenly made his choice and
gave the poke to Ketchum. As he did so he took a slow, easy step
backward. It went unnoticed. Ketchum dropped his head to look at
the pouch, and George Ives turned half around, also to look.</p>

<p>"That's the pouch, George. The fellow had it in Tanner's other
night."</p>

<p>Ives said, "How'd you come by this&mdash;" and turned, and
quit speaking. Ollie Rounds had his gun lifted on both men.</p>

<p>Surprise and irritation went in ruffled waves across George
Ives's face, and afterwards it smoothed carefully out. Ketchum's
eyes flared wild instantly and he seemed to strain against his
caution.</p>

<p>"I saw Rube watching him in the saloon," said Rounds. "When he
went out, Rube started after him. I got there first. Hand the
poke back."</p>

<p>Rube stretched his arm, half length, and his body dropped
perceptibly, in the attitude of tension. Rounds murmured: "Pull
out of that, Rube. Nobody'd be sorry to see you dead. I'd be glad
of the chance to drop you. I'm no easy miner. I haven't got a
drop of pity in me and when it comes to rough-and-tumble I know
as many tricks as you. Maybe"&mdash;and his voice had a dry,
swinging tune&mdash;"I'd better do it now. I think I'm going to
have to watch you. You damned cannibal."</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Ives, now interested.</p>

<p>"You don't know about Rube?" said Rounds. "The man got caught
in a blizzard up on the Snake and ate his partner."</p>

<p>Ketchum's eyes glowed and grew dark, and glowed again. He was
a black, burly man with no good in him. The smell of blood was
about him, like the bad odor of a beast. His rage remained,
furious and inhuman and inburning. He never spoke. It was Ives
who said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He means what he says, Rube."</p>

<p>Ketchum straightened and extended his arm full length with the
poke. Rounds took the poke and put it in his pocket. "All right,"
he said. "All right."</p>

<p>"Now I'll say my piece," put in Ives, still the calm master of
himself. "You've cut in on our game. You're an outsider."</p>

<p>"Always liked it that way," said Ollie Rounds.</p>

<p>"It won't work here," said Ives. "This Gulch is for our crowd
to work. A man that ain't in our crowd just can't operate."</p>

<p>"So far I'm doing well enough."</p>

<p>Ives held his attitude of amusement. "Listen, friend. There's
forty men up and down this Gulch I can drop a word to. You don't
know who they are and you can't watch 'em. When I say the word,
you're dead before breakfast."</p>

<p>"You're the boss, then?" said Rounds.</p>

<p>"I'm the boss in this Gulch," answered Ives.</p>

<p>"All right," said Ollie Rounds.</p>

<p>George Ives gave Rounds a prolonged stare. "You're cool,
friend. You might do well with us."</p>

<p>"I'd do well wherever I find myself," said Ollie Rounds.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you might do well. Keep the poke. It is chicken
feed."</p>

<p>"I'll keep it. I'll keep whatever I take."</p>

<p>"That's all right, too," said George Ives. "A man must look
out for himself. But when we move as a bunch you'll do as you're
told."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said Ollie Rounds.</p>

<p>"Then it is settled," said George Ives. "There's a little
meeting tonight down the Gulch. We'll all ride down."</p>

<p>"My horse is around on that side street," said Rounds, and
turned with Ives. For a moment he had his back to Rube Ketchum,
and a stark, chill raced up his back, and he turned at one jump
and saw Ketchum in the act of drawing. He had not yet put away
his own gun, and now brought it down on Ketchum's head in a rapid
side blow. Ketchum dropped into the dust, and rolled. Rounds took
a full jump toward a building wall, and whirled again, laying the
muzzle against George Ives. Ives hadn't moved, had made no
gesture of offense.</p>

<p>These two exchanged long, steady stares until at last Ives
spoke, showing his first anger. "What the hell are you
about?"</p>

<p>"Watching my hole card, George."</p>

<p>"I said it was all right, didn't I?" flashed out Ives. "If I
say it, I mean it. You don't have to watch me, or any of us. I
will pass the word along."</p>

<p>"Him?" said Rounds, nodding at Ketchum.</p>

<p>"Rube," said Ives, as he would have spoken to a dog, "cut it
out. You hear me&mdash;cut it out." He swung back to Ollie. "Now
don't let me catch you pointing that thing at me any more. I'll
meet you down Daylight."</p>

<p>Rounds turned through the tents and got his horse from the
stable. He moved rapidly to the bottom of Daylight Gulch and he
left the road and watched it closely until he saw Ives and
Ketchum come along. When he was certain of them he moved out of
the dark. Ives laughed softly at the maneuvering. "You're sure
ticklish, friend."</p>

<p>The three of them rode to the summit of Daylight, looking down
upon the sinuous glitter of Alder's continuous lights. Ives said:
"We'll split and ride on, one by one. Pete Daly's roadhouse is
the place. Come right on&mdash;we're going to be late." Then he
looked at Ketchum, who was a silent lump in the saddle. "Rube,"
he said patiently, "behave yourself." Then he rode away. Five
minutes later Ketchum moved after him. A short time later Ollie
Rounds followed.</p>

<p>He had been in the Gulch three days and in that time he had
seen the constant tide of miners and camp followers roll up the
course of Alder Creek and crowd along the dry walls. It went on
without the least slackening, hour after hour, by day and by
night. Going down the Gulch now, he pressed through this
continuing wave of advancing men, on foot, on horse, by wagon and
packtrain and freight outfit. From Daylight, on through Central,
Nevada, Adobetown and Junction, there was scarcely a gap in the
steady procession. The stores and saloons of the settlements were
wide open and crowded, the sound of voices never faded, the
lights of camp and tent and hillside fire burned endlessly on. In
the soft wind and in the thin Montana air was a slugging pulse of
excitement.</p>

<p>Past Junction he fell into the narrows of the Gulch. Now and
then a fast-moving horse struck up sparks from the stony footing;
and now and then some man's voice hailed him through the black.
Fourteen miles from Virginia he came out of the Gulch at Ramshorn
Creek and reached Daly's Roadhouse, a two-story building built of
riven logs and chinked with mud mortar. Twenty or more horses
stood in the shadows before the place; the door was closed and
three men seemed to guard it. He came up to find Ives and Rube
Ketchum waiting for him, and Ives introduced him to the third
man. "This is Red Yeager. Everything's all right, Red. This is
Ollie Rounds."</p>

<p>They stepped into a barroom which took up most of the lower
floor and faced a considerable crowd. Some of them he recognized
at once. Tanner&mdash;the saloon man from Virginia City&mdash;was
in a corner. Clubfoot Lane was here, and Jack Gallegher who was
Henry Plummer's Deputy Sheriff in Virginia. He identified Hayes
Lyons and Buck Stinson, and he nodded at Steve Marshland. A few
others he also knew by name, having had them pointed out to him
in Tanner's saloon&mdash;Alec Carter and Bob Zachary, and Frank
Parrish, and the surly one who was Boone Helm. There wasn't, he
thought in idle amusement, an honest man in the crowd. In three
days he had absorbed a good deal of camp gossip. They seemed to
have no fear of surprise or recognition. They had all the
confidence in the world. George Ives moved around the room with
Rounds, introducing him here and there. Ives, Rounds gathered,
was one of the chiefs, for he had his unmistakable way with them.
He was a slim man, clean-shaven in a group that went heavily
bearded or mustached. He had quick eyes and he had a brain that
was fertile, and he had a bold self-confidence.</p>

<p>Daly, the owner of the roadhouse, seemed not to be one of the
crowd, for presently Ives told him to leave; and the Irishman
went at once, as though relieved. Then Ives called: "All
right&mdash;all right."</p>

<p>A back door had opened, and silence came to the crowd.
Swinging about, Rounds discovered the Sheriff, Henry Plummer, at
that door. The Sheriff came in, closed the door, and gave the
room a short and thorough glance; and his eyes stopped on Ollie
Rounds and stayed there, civil and speculative and very alert.
Ives said: "It's all right, Henry. This is Ollie Rounds."</p>

<p>Plummer had apparently ridden over from Bannack in
considerable haste. Dust was on his clothes and at the edges of
his dark hair. He wore a fine black suit and white shirt; he had
the manners of a gentleman and his voice was very smooth. He had
a small, trimmed mustache and his face was round and on the soft
side. Nothing about him revealed the mark of a desperado, and
Rounds, never a man to be surprised at the turnings of life,
found himself mildly surprised at Plummer.</p>

<p>Plummer said: "I can't stay long. I want you to listen to
me."</p>

<p>George Ives tapped the bottom of a whisky bottle on the table.
"Order here. Bunton&mdash;Sam Bunton&mdash;shut up."</p>

<p>Sam Bunton was at the bar, both arms clinging to it; he was
drunk and he was angry, and he slowly cursed the bare wall behind
the room. Ives moved over to him. Ives dug a thumb in Bunton's
ribs. "Shut up, Sam."</p>

<p>Bunton reared and swung. He said: "Where's my brother? He'll
stand by me. Where's Bill?"</p>

<p>Bill Bunton came out of a corner, lank and sour and close-
eyed. "Sam," he said, "cut it out or I'll break your damned
neck."</p>

<p>"All right," said Sam Bunton, and stopped talking at once.</p>

<p>Plummer was cool and smooth in the middle of the room. He
studied Sam Bunton and then gently said: "You get drunk too much,
Sam. I want you out of this country inside of twenty-four hours.
You hear me, Sam?"</p>

<p>"I've got a good claim up the Gulch, Henry. Why should I leave
it?"</p>

<p>Plummer intended to speak again, but Ives spoke for him. Ives
turned on Sam Bunton with a swift flash of violence. "You heard
it. Twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sam Bunton. "All right, George."</p>

<p>The other Bunton&mdash;Bill&mdash;stepped away from his
brother. Plummer turned to face all these men. "Dance and Stuart
will be starting a store in Virginia City pretty soon. It will be
a place where most of the miners come at one time or another.
Probably the express office will have space there, too. It will
be a fine place to overhear what's going on, who's got money to
be shipped out, who's flush and who's not. Clubfoot, as soon as
that store is up you ask Dance for a little corner in it to put
up your shoe shop. You can keep your ears open and hear a lot. By
the way, I understand you're spending a lot of time in Tanner's
saloon. Keep out of it. It pegs you."</p>

<p>"All right," said Clubfoot.</p>

<p>"I don't want you boys to gang up in one spot too much. It
makes things too plain to the Gulch. Jack Gallegher will stay in
Virginia City, of course. Ned Ray and Stinson will work out of
Bannack. Bill Bunton sticks with his ranch on the Rattlesnake.
Now we will split our crowd. Ives, Steve Marshland, Johnny
Wagner, Alec Carter, Whisky Bill Graves, and Rube Ketchum will
headquarter in the Gulch." He pointed a finger at Rounds. "You
will be there too. The rest of you men are roadsters, working
between the Gulch and Bannack."</p>

<p>He watched these men with his calculating far-off thoughts.
"The Gulch is rich, Men will be coming out of it with dust all
summer, all year. Keep your ears open, all of you. No doubt some
of these people will try to get their dust through by fooling us.
It has been tried already. We have got to know what's going on.
Any man that talks against us we must take care of at once.
Little things make big things. Destroy the little things and
that's the end of the big ones. One more thought. I won't be
around the Gulch much. I'll spend my time in Bannack. You boys in
the Gulch take your orders from George Ives."</p>

<p>He was obviously in a hurry. Now he came over to Ives and said
a short word, and turned to Rounds. He offered his hand&mdash;a
light and swift grip and a quick withdrawal&mdash;and he put the
full power of his hazel eyes on Rounds. He said in his courteous
way: "I hear you're all right." And then he dropped his light
warning. "We all work together. And we don't back out. Glad to
see you." He turned over the room and left Daly's, his horse soon
drumming the road. Somebody called for Daly to come back and the
bar grew busy and men filled the tables and began to play poker.
Red Yeager, doorkeeper, came in. Rounds walked to the door with
Ives, and stopped there. Ives pointed to the knot in his own
neckpiece. "See that. It is a square knot. All the boys make that
tie. It is a sign among us. If you should ever get in trouble you
have only to say, 'I am Innocent.' That is a sign, too."</p>

<p>Rounds shrugged his shoulders. "Very bold. Suppose I should
talk? I'm a stranger to you."</p>

<p>"No," said George Ives, "you won't talk. We'd find it out.
Nothing happens in the Gulch we don't find out. Anyhow, you're in
this for what you can make, ain't you?" Then he slapped Rounds on
the back and gave out a long ringing laugh. "Suppose you did
talk. Who would believe you?"</p>

<p>"You remember I gave Pierce a hand in Lewiston. That makes no
difference to you?"</p>

<p>He thought he saw the memory of that affair slice through
Ives. But the man had a wonderful front and carried himself well.
"I remember it. But I don't mind. You play your game your way.
You've got your tricks and your connections. So have I. That is
the way it is done. You make a grandstand and it puts you solid.
Nobody knows you're in this. That's what you want, isn't it?" He
gave Ollie a steady, extremely close inspection. "You're thinking
it is funny I trust you. I do not trust you. I trust nobody. But
it doesn't matter. The more the merrier and you won't stray. I
like smart people. I think you're smart." And now, coming closer
to tap Ollie lightly on the chest with a finger, he significantly
added: "You might be a friend of this Pierce, but first of all
I've got you sized up as a crook. In a pinch you'll turn down
Pierce for a profitable deal. It is all right, Ollie."</p>

<p>Somebody kept calling for Ives and he turned away, again
laughing. Rounds went out to his horse and moved homeward.</p>

<p>As he rode he turned over in his mind all that he had seen and
heard, and marveled at it; and for a moment a thread of fear drew
through him as he thought of his own position. There were times
when, in common with all fatalists, he had his strange dark-
lighted intimations of the future, and foresaw a grisly ending.
This came now, and went away, and his natural carelessness made
him once more confident. He began to whistle, and heard the
echoes come wavering back from the narrow-placed walls of the
canyon.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE JUNGLE BEASTS
GROWL</h2>

<p class="first">BY night the revels of Virginia City rolled up-
Gulch in warm waves of sound; yet for two weeks Pierce never left
the boundaries of his claims.</p>

<p>At times he was his own great puzzle, troubled by the lack of
order in him and the lack of meaning in the world around him; and
when these times came a black cape seemed to envelop him in blind
bitter solitude, to make him feel as though he were the only
living thing on the planet, with all the forces of the earth,
impersonal and relentless, seeking to destroy him. It was a game
of survival&mdash;one man against the gods. Survival was the one
hard and fast law.</p>

<p>Now and then, in his unguarded moments, he caught the vague
intimations of other patterns of life and when that happened he
put his whole mind to the search, reaching out and out to capture
those elusive things that might be. For a moment he heard the
sound of them and caught the shadowed color of them; afterwards
they vanished, to leave him more thoroughly alone with his
dominating memory of the destruction of his mother and the
scattering of his people by the brute savagery of the world.</p>

<p>It was this memory which made him hate the forces pushing
against him and, hating them, resist and defy them. To
survive.</p>

<p>He threw himself into his work single-mindedly, rising before
light came to the Gulch and falling asleep long after night
dropped down. This was the only way he knew by which to dissipate
an energy which drove him so hard. Some of the prospectors along
the wall of the gulch got together to build a flume which would
carry water from the upper creek along the face of the Gulch
shoulder and thereby do away with the hard job of packing pay
dirt to the creek. He joined them and built the flume to his own
side-canyon; he rigged up a sluice box, shoveling pay dirt into
the sluice and tuming water from flume to sluice. At the end of
the week, when he cleaned out the riffles of the sluice box, he
had five hundred and forty dollars of dust.</p>

<p>During the second week he moved over to work Barney Morris'
claim. This was an obligation. The dead man's hand held him and
the dead man's instructions bound him. Half of the gold from that
claim went to him, and the other half to Mary Morris,
Centerville, Ohio. Sometimes at night, just before falling into
dreamless sleep, he thought about Barney Morris' widow two
thousand miles away who depended on a man she had never
met&mdash;and at that moment the hint of a better reason for life
touched him with its softness, and went away.</p>

<p>During the middle of the first week A. J. Oliver came up to
see him. "That eight thousand dollars you brought into the
Bannack office is still there. The toughs know about it, of
course. They won't try to lift it out of the safe but the moment
I start it to Salt Lake they'll stage a hold-up on the road."</p>

<p>"How'd they find out?"</p>

<p>Oliver gave him a gray side-glance. "They hear everything. It
leaks out from places you wouldn't expect. You don't know with
whom you're talking in this camp. I thought I'd wait until a good
strong caravan of freighters started from Bannack and send the
gold with them."</p>

<p>"Probably they're waiting for that," said Pierce. "Eight
thousand is worth waiting for. I wouldn't do it, Oliver. I'd let
it stay in the safe. About a month from now let's drop the news
around that you've already smuggled it out. Might throw them off
guard. Then we'll figure a way."</p>

<p>"You can't be the man to do it," said Oliver. "If you show up
in Bannack the toughs will catch on."</p>

<p>"We'll do it through somebody else."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Oliver. As he turned down the Gulch he
stopped to add: "You know they've got you on the black list don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jeff. "I know."</p>

<p>There were no secrets in the Gulch. News traveled from Summit
to Junction with the wind, seeming to need no human carrier.
Everybody knew the toughs had him on the list. But it was strange
how this same news brought him friends. There was, it appeared,
an underground wire for the honest ones. During the latter part
of the first week Parris Pfouts, one of the new merchants in the
Gulch, came up along the diggings. All he said in the beginning
was, "You're Pierce, aren't you? I'm Parris Pfouts." Then he
stood by, idle in the sun and not making much out of the visit;
yet Pierce felt the survey of the man and the following judgment.
Presently Pfouts added: "Barney Morris was a particular friend of
mine. I hated to see him go. Any ideas on who did that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pierce, "I know who did it." He kept on working.
Pfouts remained indolent under the warming sun, not pressing the
subject. He was, Pierce realized, wise enough to know that a
direct question would be out of order. In this country men were
close-mouthed before strangers, and so far he and Pfouts were
still strangers. Pfouts simply said: "There will come a time of
reckoning."</p>

<p>"There was a time of reckoning," answered Pierce, "when you
had Lyons and Stinson and Forbes cold with the goods. But the
boys were washed out on a flood of tears. It is too late now. The
toughs have the whip."</p>

<p>Pfouts said: "I have seen toughs before who had the whip. But
they always used it too hard. And then they got wiped out."</p>

<p>"Not until this Gulch quits voting on tears. The strong and
the smart always run things, Pfouts."</p>

<p>"I agree. The strong and the smart&mdash;and the honest."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>Pfouts smiled. "I heard you were considerable of a hard one.
Don't believe in much, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not too much."</p>

<p>Pfouts moved upgrade to drop a word with Archie Caples on the
adjoining claim; and later returned to Virginia City. This was on
Thursday. On Friday, moving in much the same casual manner, Jim
Williams appeared on a beautiful bay gelding and paused at the
sluice box. Williams was near Pierce's age, a broad-chested and
muscular young man with a dark and gentle face. His ragged
mustache ran down around his mouth and fell into equally ragged
chin whiskers and his eyes were a melancholy brown. He rested his
arms on the saddle horn and, as Pfouts had done, took his time to
estimate Pierce. "That flume," he observed, "saves a lot of
work."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"I heard a piece of talk in town this morning," went on Jim
Williams. "Ketchum opened his mouth in Tanner's and some brave
words fell out. Your name was with the words. It is none of my
business, of course."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Pierce. He stopped his work and met Jim
Williams' glance, and for a little while they frankly swapped
inspections. This Williams was no talker. Pierce had met him
before in Virginia City and had observed that he always kept in
the background of a group, and yet he had also observed that
Oliver and Pfouts and the substantial men of the district always
liked to have Jim Williams' opinion. He was that kind of man,
reserved and thoughtful; with an underlying sadness or pessimism
strongly influencing his character. Pierce said: "Pfouts came up
to drop a hint yesterday. He is too optimistic about law and
order."</p>

<p>"There will be no law and order," said Jim Williams in a half-
asleep manner, "until things get a good deal worse."</p>

<p>"The pack," said Pierce, "always follows the strong side."</p>

<p>"How many men does it take to make a strong side?" murmured
Jim Williams.</p>

<p>"One man is enough," said Pierce. "One man against the whole
damned world&mdash;if he's not afraid of dying."</p>

<p>Williams made a brief nod of his head and then he smiled.
Pierce answered that smile and at that instant these two knew
each other well, and trusted each other completely, Williams
reined around and trotted down the Gulch.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, near twilight, Pierce noticed Rube
Ketchum move up the Gulch on the opposite side of the creek and
pass by, neither looking toward him nor showing curiosity. Yet
that lack of curiosity was itself a warning and after he had
finished supper Pierce took his shotgun and blankets and climbed
the ridge of the side-canyon and made camp in the brush. He
repeated this the following nights. On Friday of the second week,
again near dusk, Ollie Rounds and Ben Scoggins appeared before
his small supper fire.</p>

<p>"We were having a drink in The Senate," said Scoggins
cheerfully, "and we thought of you. Seemed natural to pay a
visit. Ain't seen you for ten days or so."</p>

<p>Day after day with himself, dawn to dark, he had begun to turn
sour. There was a limit to a man's loneliness, a time when cabin
fever, or its Gulch equivalent, began to turn his nerves ragged
and to canker his disposition. He was genuinely pleased to see
them and threw an extra chunk of alder on the fire. Scoggins and
Rounds dismounted and settled by the blaze. Rounds said: "You
smoke these things," and offered Pierce a cigar. The three men
lounged back and let the silence run. All up and down the Gulch
firelights burned from claim to claim, and traffic went
scratching and gritting along the gravel bars and voices kept
calling. The hum of Virginia moved at them, the steady muted
mixture of music and man-noise; and now and then a shot broke
sharp-edged through and above this racket. Day's heat slowly
lifted from the Gulch, replaced by coolness.</p>

<p>Pierce said: "I heard about that sardine venture, Ben. You're
a damned Yankee trader. What's next?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Ben Scoggins, "I hauled lumber from Bannack for
couple three days until I got my bearings. Met a fellow over by
Bannack last week who was busted down with a load of flour he'd
freighted in from Salt Lake. So I made a dicker and brought the
flour up the Gulch."</p>

<p>"Sell it?"</p>

<p>Ben Scoggins laughed aloud. "Buyin' and sellin's my business.
I sold out before I got to Central. There ain't enough of
anything in this country."</p>

<p>Rounds pointed out a possibility: "Population around here
doubles every week. If you'd held that flour a month, Ben, you'd
gotten more for it."</p>

<p>Scoggins shook his head. "Always take a profit when you see
it. Keep turnin', keep goin'. The fellow that holds is a
speculator, and speculators always go busted. Buy and sell."</p>

<p>Pierce remarked: "You were in the flour business. Now you're
out of it. What's next?"</p>

<p>"I bought a corner on Jackson Street. Puttin' up a store
building. Sent to Salt Lake for a stock of general merchandise.
Should be open by late July."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds, never a restful man, seized a stick and worried
the coals of the fire around and around. "You have found your
spot. Fifty years from now you'll be on Fourth of July platforms,
talking about the old days of Alder Gulch."</p>

<p>"No-o," said Scoggins, coolly making his forecast. "I will
ride this wave until I see it about to break. Then I will sell
and go. You never saw a mining camp live very long. All these
fellows in the Gulch are travelers. They don't make a country.
They don't stick. If you're bankin' on the future go to a country
where men bring their families and take up land and start
stringin' fence lines. Where they put up schools and go to
tradin'. Traders make towns. Farmers make towns. Grist mills.
Boats stoppin' at a landing make towns. This country ain't meant
for big towns. It is grass and gold country. Gold will go. Grass
will stay&mdash;and then the cattle will come." He looked at the
other two men with his thoughtful eyes. "Maybe that's what I'll
do. Take up land for a ranch."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds grinned. "You leave that life to the tough
fellows, like Jeff here. You stick to your last."</p>

<p>"A man can have his hankerings," said Ben Scoggins.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ollie Rounds, and lost his humor, "a man can have
his hankerings. But if he follows them they'll lead him to the
swamps. Don't make pretty pictures, Ben. Let fools like me do
that."</p>

<p>Pierce lifted his eyes to thoughtfully appraise Ollie
Rounds.</p>

<p>Horsemen slashed through the creek's gravel, bound toward
Virginia City in haste. A hundred feet beyond this spot another
fire burned large and bright, whereby Archie Caples did his
laundry in a half-barrel his knuckles drumming on the corrugated
washboard. Virginia's music came clearer, and died away, and came
again. Pierce said: "What are you doing, Ollie?"</p>

<p>"I never do more than I can help."</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Don't let the world make a sucker out of you,
Ollie. It tries. That's the only game worth playing&mdash;to buck
the big tiger trying to destroy all of us. Well, buck it. Don't
let it push you along."</p>

<p>"Now, now," said Ollie Rounds, half surprised and half
resentful, "no use giving me a lot of fatherly advice. Don't tell
me to be useful and thrifty. That's Ben's game, not mine."</p>

<p>Ben Scoggins spoke in his amiable way: "Funny how three
fellows like us&mdash;not the same kind of men in any
respect&mdash;got thrown together. Does seem a long time ago,
too, since we got on the <i>Tenino</i>, bound upriver."</p>

<p>"Willy-nilly," said Ollie Rounds. "The cards fall, nobody
knows where. We're the cards. It is all one damned big joke on
us."</p>

<p>"Don't rightly believe that," said Ben quietly. But, true to
his manner, he swung the subject to keep the talk pleasant. "I
have got no complaint. I have made ten thousand dollars in
tradin' around."</p>

<p>Ollie blurted out an immediate warning. "Don't ever say it
aloud."</p>

<p>Pierce's glance lifted again and struck across the flame. He
watched Ollie Rounds with his lids half shut, with his face
pulled together. Ben Scoggins saw this, looked at Ollie, and
broke the silence. "Pretty night."</p>

<p>"All nights are pretty," said Ollie. "That's my
belief&mdash;that's what I live for." He was once more his old
casual self. He said to Pierce: "You can't work like a horse
without getting ornery. How long since you've had a drink?" He
reached into his pocket and pulled out a pint flask. "Ben and I
thought this might be a good idea."</p>

<p>He passed it to Pierce, who removed the cap and held the
bottle to the light. "Valley Tan," he said.</p>

<p>"Two dollars the bottle&mdash;cheapest thing in camp," said
Ben Scoggins, "and the most plentiful."</p>

<p>"Surcease from sorrow," said Ollie.</p>

<p>Pierce watched the bottle turn amber and brown under the
firelight. He had something to say, and framed it in his mind
carefully, and said it. "It just occurs to me that both you boys,
or either of you, may someday need help. I never offer my help,
as a rule. But if you need help, just give a shout and I'll be
with you." Then he said, "How," and took his drink.</p>

<p>A single horse came up the Gulch and turned against Archie
Caples' campfire. The rider got down and spoke in a short tone at
Caples. Caples reared back on his heels. He looked up at the
rider and shook his head; and then the rider moved at him and hit
him across the face and knocked him against the gravel.</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds looked on, neither moving nor changing
expression; it was a scene to him, nothing more. Ben Scoggins
grumbled, "What the hell's that for?" and was genuinely troubled.
It was Pierce who acted. Reaching behind him, he seized up his
water bucket and flung the full contents on the fire, killing the
flame at once. He was on his feet, and he said: "That's for me,
Ben, not for him." Then, the water bucket still in his hand, he
ran toward the creek.</p>

<p>"What the hell?" grumbled Ben, and lifted to his feet. Ollie
Rounds's hand came out and seized Ben's leg. "Drop down, you
fool!"</p>

<p>Ben kicked Rounds's hand away. "He's in trouble, ain't
he?"</p>

<p>"You're big as a barn up there! Get down and crawl!"</p>

<p>The stranger at Archie Caples' fire slowly circled Caples as
the other struggled up from the ground. Caples tried to turn and
keep his eyes on the stranger, but the stranger side-stepped
steadily and when Caples got to his feet the stranger jumped in
again, hit Caples a great blow on the back of the neck with his
forearm, and dropped him. Ben Scoggins growled in his throat and
began to crawl ahead on his hands and knees, Ollie Rounds
following behind. Rounds kept murmuring: "Watch it&mdash;watch
it, Ben."</p>

<p>Pierce suddenly appeared up on the edge of the other campfire
and threw a fresh bucket of water on it, immediately quenching
the blaze. A gun yelled from the near-by Gulch wall and the
bullet scutted on the gravel and sang away. Both Rounds and
Scoggins, now running on, heard the sudden crush of Pierce's body
against the stranger. The stranger let out a harking shout and
the gravel reported the stamp of Pierce's feet as he rushed
toward the Gulch wall, toward the unseen gun. Briefly he was a
blur in the dark; afterwards he faded. Both Rounds and Scoggins
moved after him, guided by the sound of his feet. Ben Scoggins
called out, "Hey, Jeff!" And Ollie quietly cursed Ben for it. The
gun on the ridge emitted its dry round voice into the dark,
leaving a flickered bloom of light behind. Pierce fired at once
in reply and then the hidden man's gun flared again from a
different angle of the hill and steps rattled up the side of the
ridge.</p>

<p>Pierce came back, his breath lifting and falling. He found
Scoggins and Ollie Rounds and he said, "Let's see," and moved on
to Archie Caples' water-damped fire. A few coals still glowed and
by that light they saw Caples standing spraddle-legged and
uncertain, both hands clasped around his head. "Fellow got away
before my senses came back."</p>

<p>Miners were running in from all corners of the Gulch; and a
lantern swung forward. Pierce stood lank in the growing light,
water shining on his coat. "It wasn't for you, Archie. It was for
me."</p>

<p>The oncoming lantern touched these four; and then Ollie Rounds
turned and stepped back into the dark and waited until Ben
Scoggins joined him. The two returned to their horses and started
down-Gulch for Virginia City.</p>

<p>"A funny thing," said Scoggins.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not funny. They won't let him alone."</p>

<p>"Who you talking about?" asked Ben Scoggins.</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds made no answer to that. Later, on the edge of
Virginia, he mentioned something else. "He knew what was up the
minute the fellow hit Archie Caples. He knew it all&mdash;and he
knew what to do. He's cut out for it. You and I are not. You
stick to your trade and let Jeff handle the beasts in the
jungle." At Wallace Street Ollie turned from Ben. He said again:
"But they'll never leave him alone. Too much for one man, no
matter how good he is."</p>



<p><br> That was Friday of the second week of his steady labor;
on Saturday he worked steadily through the day, cooked his supper
and sat back from his fire and slowly smoked his cigar; and as he
smoked it the two weeks of unremitting work caught up with him
and he felt the staleness in him, and the taste of the cigar grew
unpalatable. This was always the penalty of solitariness. A man
fed upon himself until his fat was gone and then he had to have
another kind of nourishment. Rising, he killed the fire and
struck for town.</p>

<p>Virginia, in two weeks, was a different camp. It crowded
against the Gulch walls, it stretched up the Gulch and it spilled
down the Gulch. Wagons and travelers moved forward from the
Daylight Grade in full stream to choke the streets and to stir a
dust that made fine yellow smoke against the light beams of store
and saloon and dance hall. Cruising forward he came upon new
streets which fourteen days before had not existed and, pushed to
the edge of the walk by the crowd, he found himself facing a
small single-story frame building across the way on which a newly
painted sign said: "Diana Castle's Bakery." He threaded the
tight-jammed wagon traffic to the bakery door and as he came to a
pause before it he heard Diana's voice at his side. "How are you,
Jeff?"</p>

<p>He didn't at this first moment turn to look at her. He kept
his eyes on the shop's doorway, and he spoke in a tone as
indifferent as her own: "This is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is just finished. The stove was set up today. It was
supposed to be for a restaurant down in Central but Ben Scoggins
dickered the man out of it."</p>

<p>She went into the shop and came about. He stood fast, seeing
the lovely shine of her hair against the lamplight and the
roundness of her shoulder points and the straight line of her
body. Her eyes were cool. She wasn't smiling and in a way she
seemed still to be judging him and finding him wanting. But she
said: "Come in."</p>

<p>He entered the shop and then he did a thing which, when she
came to think of it, was typical of him: he reached out and
closed the door so that he would not be exposed to sudden attack.
That kind of suspicion and self-defense never left him; his life
had been violent for so long that it was an unconscious reaction.
He was very tall in the room and he had recently shaved and his
face had a thick tan compounded of all his outdoor years and his
eyes were dense blue and his cheekbones stood high and pronounced
against his skin. He had on a pair of gray trousers and a blue
double-breasted miner's shirt. Suddenly he reached up and removed
his hat and he unexpectedly smiled, so that now the lean
formidableness left him and he was a man she liked&mdash;and
wished she could continue to like forever.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "this is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I found my place."</p>

<p>"You're doing all this by yourself?"</p>

<p>"No. I have a baker to help me. You see my stove?" It was a
long, black restaurant range, scarred by its travels through this
country, but she was obviously very proud of it. A coffeepot
simmered on it, reminder of a hospitable gesture. She went to a
cupboard and brought out a cup, and poured coffee for him; and
got him a piece of pie. "You're thinner than when I saw you
last."</p>

<p>He tried the pie. He said: "You're a good cook, Diana."</p>

<p>"I learned to cook when I was a little girl." Some thought
came to him, its keen reaction showing on his face; when she was
aware of it she dropped her eyes, not sure of how she should feel
toward this man who had so desperately hurt her. But a moment
later she brought her eyes back to him and this was the way they
stood over a long moment, no longer smiling, but reading each
other until at last memory darkened her expression. She was
thinking&mdash;as he was thinking of the night he had kissed her;
that moment became too real for her and she turned and moved away
from him. At the far corner of the room she swung about.</p>

<p>"You're happy here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I'm useful. I'm alive. I am doing something.
But you're not particularly happy."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I be?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "You never will be. You remember too many
bitter things. You judge all people by the pain they might cause
you or by the cruelty some of them used on you. You have no
faith."</p>

<p>"Why should I have? I ask nobody for anything. I need
nobody."</p>

<p>"That's it. Everything to you is a matter of not needing
anybody, of hating to need anybody." She stepped toward him until
the fragrance of her clothes and hair&mdash;the fragrance of a
woman&mdash;enveloped him like warmth. "You won't change until
someday you are very badly hurt and need help. But there won't be
anybody you can turn to because you have closed everybody out.
Then you'll know that there isn't any living soul who can travel
alone. Then you'll find out you've got to trust people."</p>

<p>"And be sold out," he said.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and changed the subject. "I suppose
you know I have taken Lily Beth for awhile. We have a cabin on
Wallace Street."</p>

<p>"Where's her mother?"</p>

<p>"I haven't asked. But I suspect Mr. Temperton took Lily Beth
away from her."</p>

<p>He moved restlessly around the room. She watched him, knowing
him better than he knew himself. He was a man out of joint with
himself, with great feeling and great wants imprisoned within the
walls of his own black discipline. He was like a boiler with no
outlet; one day the boiler would burst and he would destroy
himself. The thought of it brought a trace of pity to her face,
and then she was startled to hear him speak her name in an odd
way. "Diana," he said, and looked as though he wished to crush
her, or kiss her. He had his hands behind him and he was so near
to her that she saw her own reflection in his eyes. She stood
fast, remembering that she had once offered this man everything
and that he had misjudged her, yet almost ready to forgive him
for all the hurt he had caused her.</p>

<p>Somebody lightly tapped on the door, and Will Temperton pushed
it before him, He saw them and he said in his cool voice: "Sorry.
Hadn't meant to intrude."</p>

<p>Pierce turned about. "No intrusion," he said as short and hard
as he could speak the words.</p>

<p>Temperton inclined his head. He said: "I only wondered if
there was anything you wished me to get for Lily Beth,
Diana."</p>

<p>"No," said Diana. "There's nothing in town for her. We'll wait
until Dance and Stuart's wagons come over from Salt Lake."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Temperton, "I suppose. Be sure and buy whatever
you need." He gave Pierce the straight and sharp look of one who
had his judgments but held them back; and turned out of the
shop.</p>

<p>Pierce wheeled to Diana and then she saw everything had
changed between them and her hope of goodness to come went away.
It was in the new way he looked at her. He smiled a little, but
it was a smile that came through the risen clouds of that old
mistrust. For a moment he had forgotten; now he remembered and
she was clearly aware of what he thought and what he felt about
her. She waited for him to speak and then had her great shock. He
took a step to her and closed her into his long arms and kissed
her.</p>

<p>She held herself still until she knew from what terrible frame
of mind he had acted; thereafter, more outraged than she had ever
known herself to be, more deeply hurt and inexpressibly ashamed,
she pushed him away, She lifted both hands and struck his chest
and forced him across the room until his shoulders hit the door,
and she flung her full anger at him: "Don't come back&mdash;don't
ever come back!"</p>

<p>Had she been less angry she would have pitied him again for
the self-hatred he showed at the moment. He said in a completely
dead tone "I am sorry," and left the room.</p>

<p>He went along Wallace Street with his head lowered, a man
furious at his own folly; he used his arms to push a way through
the crowd. The Pantheon was across the street and he turned over
and entered the dance hall. There was no vacant space at the bar
but he made a place by driving his shoulder between a pair of
men, sliding them aside. He put both arms on the bar and waited
for the bottle to come; and he took his drink. The music stopped
and partners promenaded and he heard the laughter of the girls
beside him.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Jeff?"</p>

<p>Lil stood by, smiling at him. She had a partner but she turned
her back to the partner and watched Pierce with her wisdom. She
had seen men before like him&mdash;inwardly burning and outwardly
frozen&mdash;and because she had seen them she knew what power of
breakage lay now in Pierce. Nothing but wildness came out of a
man when he was in a mood like that. She put her hand over his
glass and she let her soft laugh fall on him and she took his arm
and pulled him from the bar. "Our dance, Jeff," she said. The
floorman called, "Choose your partners for the waltz," and the
music swung down on the first long beat. She led him away,
turning and turning, and she was light in his arms, a soft weight
near him but always moving away from him, with her face flushed
by the heat of the hall and her hazel eyes searching him. "What's
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said, "is everything. How long have you been up
the creek working?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks."</p>

<p>"That's what's wrong."</p>

<p>"Why?" he said, and for the first time seemed to take interest
in her.</p>

<p>She said: "If men could live alone do you suppose there would
be women like me in places like this?"</p>

<p>"Why should you be here, Lil? I always wondered."</p>

<p>"Don't ask foolish questions."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I won't." But her manner drew a grin from him.
"You seem to know the kind of medicine a man needs."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I do." She ceased to smile and some of the
liveliness went out of her. She was smaller and heavier in his
arms and her glance dropped. "Yes," she added in a short, sad
way, "I suppose I do."</p>

<p>He led her to the bar after the dance. She watched him take
his whisky and she watched its effect on him. "But don't drink
too much, will you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I won't," and watched her go away with another
miner. The music started again. He helped himself to a final
drink and paid for it; as he turned from the bar he discovered
Rube Ketchum at the hall's doorway, looking in&mdash;looking at
him.</p>

<p>Ketchum immediately turned back into the street. Pierce
started toward the door and came against a man directly in his
path. He pushed the man aside, walked straight through the
dancing couples and shoved his way to the door. When he got
outside he saw Ketchum at that moment passing into Tanner's,
whereupon he left the walk, ducked around a six-horse team and
reached Tanner's.</p>

<p>Lil, moving through a quadrille, had observed Pierce's quick
pursuit of Ketchum and she instantly abandoned the set and her
partner, ran out the back way and circled through a space between
the dance hall and the Globe store. Here, with Tanner's directly
across the way, she stopped and waited.</p>

<p>When in Virginia City, George Ives usually held out at
Tanner's, invariably standing at the far end of the bar wherefrom
he commanded a view of the crowd and the doors. Ketchum, hurrying
into the saloon, spotted Ives and shoved through the crowd. "He's
on my trail, George. He's coming."</p>

<p>Ives's mind was of the sort that seized upon chance like a
trap. He said at once: "Go halfway down the bar. Just stand
there. Don't look at him." He pushed Ketchum away with a hand and
thereafter wheeled on Steve Marshland and George Parrish who were
near him. "Move around the room." Then he looked through the
crowd until he caught Jack Gallegher's attention, and nodded.
Gallegher stepped back against the far wall.</p>

<p>Pierce came into Tanner's and immediately located Ketchum. The
man was at the bar, drinking, but he faced the back bar mirror
and so had a view of his rear. Pushing forward, Pierce found a
spot near Ketchum and signaled for a bottle and glass and
meanwhile took time to consider his surroundings, He located Ives
and he spotted both Gallegher and Steve Marshland, but at the
moment he thought nothing of them. Ollie Rounds, he discovered,
was bucking a faro game, and Temperton dealt at a middle table.
Ben Scoggins was just then entering the saloon; he discovered
Pierce and moved over.</p>

<p>He said, cheerfully: "Shook yourself loose from the diggin's,
I notice."</p>

<p>A pair of men left the bar, so that now Pierce and Ketchum
were side by side. Ollie turned to occupy the vacant space and
showed a small surprise when Pierce cut in front of him, crowding
against Ketchum. His shoulder rammed Ketchum's shoulder,
whereupon Ketchum spread his legs and braced himself against the
pressure. Still, he did not look directly at Pierce. He raised
his whisky glass and when he did so Pierce gave him a full shove
which spilled the liquor; that aggression forced Ketchum against
the tight rank of men at the bar and someone down the line said
irritably: "What the hell's the matter up there?"</p>

<p>Scoggins murmured: "What's up, Jeff?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Pierce. "Just pushing a&mdash;," and he used
one unmentionable phrase on Ketchum, "out of the way."</p>

<p>Ketchum slid beyond the reach of Pierce's shoulders. He held
both arms on the bar and he continued to watch the big man
through the back bar mirror with a cautious and wooden
expression. This seemed strange to Ben Scoggins, but as he looked
around the room and noticed Ives and certain other toughs now
watching the play he thought he knew how things moved. He came
near Pierce, murmuring: "You're in a pocket."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds had turned from the faro game to observe,
whereupon Ben Scoggins made a signal with his hand which Ollie
acknowledged by the briefest dip of his head. Jack Gallegher now
strolled over the room to Ketchum's side. "How's things going,
Rube?" he said. "Everything all right?"</p>

<p>Pierce idly turned and caught Ketchum in the ribs with the
point of his elbow. Ketchum flinched and backed away, at last
directly facing Pierce. "Cut it out," he said.</p>

<p>"When you come to see me," stated Pierce, "come during the
day."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Ketchum.</p>

<p>Gallegher remained to the rear of Ketchum, silently backing up
the dull, black-witted man. He watched Pierce quite closely but
at times his glance lifted to the far end of the bar. Ben
Scoggins turned his attention to see what lay there and when he
discovered Ives at the bar's end he grew increasingly troubled.
He put his glance on Gallegher and he stepped around Ketchum and
stood beside Gallegher, at once drawing the Deputy's aroused
stare. "What the hell you doing here?" he grunted.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing at all," murmured Ben. "But I've got a
forty-four in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Take your dime out of this game and go back to your store.
You'll get hurt."</p>

<p>Scoggins grinned at the Deputy; it was not a full grin and not
an entirely easy one but it covered, he hoped, the cool and
trembling excitement in him. He stuck to his position. Ollie
Rounds, he noticed from the corner of his eyes, hadn't moved from
the faro table. Ollie closely watched Pierce, and the crowd in
the saloon was also watching. The quarrel by now was clear to
everyone.</p>

<p>Ketchum meanwhile seemed to find an answer to his problem for
he scowled at Pierce and said: "You go to hell, Pierce."</p>

<p>He had not quite finished before Pierce batted him across the
face with his open palms. Ketchum bared his teeth, shut his eyes
and lunged forward with both arms wide-flung like a wrestler's.
Pierce seized one arm and wheeled close against Ketchum; he
pulled Ketchum's arm over his shoulder and he ducked and gave a
sharp twist. Ketchum yelled and came off his feet and plunged
headlong out into the center fioor, rolling against the edge of
the crowd, and falling. Players at the near-by poker tables
scrambled away, kicking their chairs aside. Ketchum started to
rise and got as far as his knees when Pierce ran in, seized a
poker table and smashed it into Ketchum, sending the man down
again. The rim of the table struck Ketchum on the head and when
he dropped he lay without motion.</p>

<p>Gallegher called: "Pierce, I've got to take your
gun&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ben Scoggins, who had never moved away from the Deputy, now
murmured: "Shut up and stay out of this." Gallegher swung on him,
furious at the check. Ben's smile was a smaller and smaller
crease on his freckled face but he kept a hand in his pocket,
snugged against the forty-four he said he carried there, and he
met Gallegher's blistering glance and held the Deputy out of the
play.</p>

<p>It was all he could do and he feared it wasn't enough, for
Steve Marshland moved across to the main door and stood by it,
and Frank Parrish sifted through the crowd, and Ives called
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let him alone, Pierce."</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Don't send him after me again, George."</p>

<p>"Who sent him after you?" challenged Ives. "What would I do
that for?"</p>

<p>Now Ben Scoggins saw how it was meant to be. Ives and Ives's
friends had neatly pulled Pierce into Tanner's and presently the
trap would close. Meanwhile Ollie Rounds stood alone by the
abandoned faro rig, all other players having retreated to the
wall, and Ollie listened and watched and showed no feeling.
Ives's entrance into the scene had changed the atmosphere for the
crowd, so that men began to drift toward Tanner's back door and
leave the saloon; and Dutch John Wagner appeared from somewhere
and took stand, narrowly watching Pierce. Ben Scoggins, feeling
the increase of pressure, risked removing his glance from
Gallegher long enough to cast a questioning look at Pierce,
wondering if Pierce knew the thorough danger he faced. The big
man continued to watch Ives with complete attention, seeming not
to know he was under fire from Wagner, from Marshland, from
Parrish.</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Don't lie, George."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds, standing at the faro rig, abruptly reached down
and lifted the cased cards and threw them on the floor. He kicked
at them with his feet and he stepped across the room until he was
behind Pierce, between Pierce and Parrish. He kept going until he
had gotten beside Parrish. Here he stopped.</p>

<p>The crowd watched this, now fully silent while Ives and Pierce
faced each other across the room. Sweat cracked through Ben
Scoggins' skin and the muscles at the back of his neck began to
ache. Ives laughed in a hard, short way; his fair skin turned
florid and his eyes had bright dancing points in them. "You're
calling me names, you damned counterfeit fourflusher. Come on,
we'll see how thin your liver is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He made a gesture with his shoulder and Scoggins, now
forgetting Gallegher, saw Dutch John Wagner stiffen and make his
pull. Scoggins yelled: "Look aside, Jeff!" But Pierce had seen
this and flung up his gun and fired and knocked Dutch John off
his feet. The echo smashed the four walls of Tanner's; men here
and there dropped flat on the floor. Pierce ran at Ives, flat-
footed. Ives, never moving from the bar's end, watched Pierce and
ceased to smile, and never moved. Dutch John started to shout and
thresh on the floor. "My shoulder's bleedin'! Where's
Steele&mdash;get Steele!" Nobody seemed to hear him. Pierce
stopped within arm's reach of Ives. Scoggins, hard-pressed to
keep up with the swift onrush of this scene, got to wondering why
it was that Ives had not tried to draw, and why it was that Steve
Marshland, unguarded at the door, had not entered the play. Again
taking his attention from Jack Gallegher, he looked back at the
door and saw Jim Williams standing in it, quiet and bulky and
very watchful, and freezing Marshland out of action by his
presence.</p>

<p>Scoggins heard Pierce say: "You still think this is fun,
George? I told you to let me alone." Then he did something that
made Scoggins wince. He lifted his gun so rapidly that Ives had
no time for defense and he smashed the barrel down on Ives's head
and dropped the man senseless to the floor. Immediately he
whirled around to face Parrish and Marshland. He saw Gallegher,
and called: "What did you start to say, Jack?"</p>

<p>"We've got no quarrel," Gallegher immediately answered.</p>

<p>"Get the hell out of my sight."</p>

<p>Gallegher wheeled in quick obedience toward the door,</p>

<p>Scoggins now joined Pierce and Jim Williams turned, so that
these three followed Gallegher out; they watched Gallegher fade
into Van Buren. Williams said: "You pushed that hard, Jeff."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pierce. Sound began to rise from Tanner's and
Dutch John Wagner shouted: "Get Steele, somebody&mdash;"</p>

<p>Williams murmured: "Ives will bear it in mind."</p>

<p>"I expect so," agreed Pierce. He said, to both of them:
"Thanks," and turned down Wallace. He crossed the street, moving
past The Pantheon, and he stopped dead when he saw Lil Shannon's
shadow come out of the small alley; he was on wire edge and he
would have drawn had not her voice checked him.</p>

<p>"Jeff&mdash;what did you do?"</p>

<p>"A fight," he said.</p>

<p>She caught his arm and pulled him down the alley.</p>

<p>"There were half a dozen men in Tanner's who'd have shot you.
You fool!" She held his arm, pulling him through the alley and
between the tents at the lower quarter of town. She went across
Van Buren With him, and drew him into her log house. She closed
the door and moved around in the dark, softly repeating, "You
were a fool, Jeff." A lamp took light under her hand and she
faced him with her expressive eyes. The dance-hall dress hung
from her shoulder points and lay rounded and tight across the
fullness of her breasts, and breathing stirred them, and she
spoke again in a voice that pulled at him and asked him for his
eyes. "Jeff&mdash;Jeff."</p>

<p>This cabin had a board floor and a boarded wall. There was a
dresser and a stove and a bed in it, and the small things that a
woman would gather about her; and a trunk with the initials L. S.
R. on it. Those, he guessed, bad once been her initials. He sat
on the edge of the bed and he bent over with both hands across
his knees. The sound of Virginia, the march of feet and the
murmur of voices and the groan of wagons, never ceased.</p>

<p>"We are all fools," he said. "The damned world is full of
beasts. All the prayers for happiness, all the little hopes, all
the things people believe&mdash;those are lies. What is the use
of lying?"</p>

<p>She came to him. She sat beside him and she said again, so
softly and humbly, "Jeff, is there anything I can do?"</p>

<p>"No. There's never anything one human being can do for
another."</p>

<p>She murmured: "Isn't there anything in me at all that you
like?" Then she put her hand around his shoulders and pulled him
into her lap. She put her arms around him, she held him tightly
to her.</p>

<p>"I wish," she murmured, "I wish . . ."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; IVES SETS A TRAP</h2>

<p class="first">VIRGINIA CITY, lying in one small fold of the
thousandfold Montana hills, grew by day and glittered by night;
the noise of its sluice boxes, the stamp and shuffle of its many
thousand feet, made a reverberation throughout the land. To a
restless America which ever cast a longing eye westward, this
town was the new Mecca, so that the impatient ones, the
dispossessed ones, the misfits and the daring, the seekers of
swift riches and the men who forever sought greener valleys came
by the slow routes from the East to crowd Virginia and Virginia's
sisters scattered elbow to elbow along Alder. They came up the
Missouri to Benton and across the wild Rocky passes, or from
Lewiston through the Bitterroots, or over the Oregon Trail to
Fort Hall and thence north. By these routes they came in headlong
rush.</p>

<p>In July there were seven thousand people in Alder Gulch. By
September there were twelve thousand, of all kinds and classes,
of all purposes and trades; veterans from the Civil War and
renegades from that war, Frontiersmen from the Platte and the
Purgatoire, trappers out of Ogden's Hole, Maine men and Ohio men
and Tennessee men, doctors who turned from medicine to mining and
doctors who stayed by their profession, lawyers like Edgerton and
Sanders and lawyers who, standing in Tanner's or the Pony or the
Senate, recited Shakespeare and afterwards begged the price of
another drink, black sheep fleeing from good families and
youngsters in search of fortune whereby they might return East to
their people, gamblers deserting older fields for this fairer
one, desperadoes guided by an unerring scent, dancehall girls and
ladies no longer ladies and good women standing above this flood
like white lights in the black.</p>

<p>This was Virginia City, pocketed in the loneliness of the
hills, encircled by Blackfoot and Ute and Bannack, dependent on
wagon train and express messenger for every article of life,
enclosed by high mountain ranges over which the thin mud roads
precariously pitched and twisted, blocked by wild white streams
in which many a man and many a team was lost.</p>

<p>By September the Gulch was staked out solidly and the steady
stream of newly arrived were pushing into adjoining gulches and
deeper into the Rocky Chain. A. J. Oliver and Peabody and
Caldwell had their stage lines established from Virginia City
through Bannack and on to Salt Lake. Bummer Dan McFadden, living
on handouts, was one day ejected from a saloon. Aimlessly
wandering, Bummer Dan struck a borrowed pick into a discarded
claim and discovered the richest bar in the Gulch. Flour went up
to seventy dollars a sack. In the hill cemetery slept a growing
company of men violently come to death. Idaho Street appeared in
town and the camp jumped Daylight Creek. The Virginia Hotel went
up, and Pfouts and Russell's store, Dance and Stuart's store, the
Planter's Hotel and the Peoples' Theatre. Wood replaced log and
canvas here and there.</p>

<p>A man named Fields was killed back of Tanner's for nothing
more valuable than a two-dollar nugget on his watch chain. Harry
Morphy, a miner with a thousand-dollar stake, set out from
Virginia City to Salt Lake and vanished entirely. Two roughs
killed a third rough in broad daylight between Daly's and
Dempsey's, under view of twenty people, and rode slowly away.
Late summer's heat struck the Tobacco Root Mountains and poured
into the Gulch and tempers grew hotter all along Alder, and the
roughs more openly predatory, and Virginia City went into its
full swing so that it had its man for breakfast every
morning.</p>

<p>A tough stood up two miners at dusk on Daylight Grade and
relieved them of a joint thirty dollars. "Gentlemen," said the
tough, "next time I brace you, have more money in your possession
or I will kill you."</p>

<p>A. J. Oliver came up the Gulch one morning in the middle of
September to talk to Pierce.</p>

<p>"I need a driver on tomorrow's run. Harry German's sick,
You've handled the ribbons I understand."</p>

<p>"All right," said Pierce.</p>

<p>Oliver said: "Cap Boyd is booked to ride the stage. He's
carrying' $2500 in dust. Nobody knows of it, but it might leak
out. Freight outfit left Bannack two days ago for Salt Lake. I
had intended sending Barney Morris' money by them but I got word
that the Innocents were watching, so I didn't. That wagon train
was held up last night."</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Then it won't be held up again. If I drive the
stage through tomorrow I'll hit Bannack after dark. I'll eat
supper. Now if I could have a horse waiting somewhere on the edge
of town, and if I could get that money, I'd ride after the
freight outfit, hand them the dust&mdash;and it would be safe
enough."</p>

<p>Oliver said: "I'll go to Bannack tonight. Your horse will be
waiting in a shed at the end of the street, that last shed on the
road to Horse Prairie. I'll get Barney Morris' money and carry it
to the shed. There's some two-by-four joists that hold the shed
rafters together, and some planks thrown on top of the two-by-
fours. You get into the shed and reach up and you'll find the
bags in a leather cantina on the planks."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Oliver said: "Joe Gallup is head man in that freight outfit.
Give the money to him."</p>

<p>Oliver had remained outside the range of Pierce's fire and had
kept his voice down. Now he looked around him, closely eyeing the
shadows and long listening. "Stage pulls out from the hotel at
five," he said and went away.</p>

<p>Pierce let his fire die and sat in the darkness, engaged in
his practical thoughts; and in a short while he went over to
Archie Caples' fire. "Archie," he said, "I'm weary of working and
I'm going to take a trip in the Tobacco Roots. If I don't show up
on the third day, maybe you'd work my claims."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Caples. But he grinned a little at Pierce, by
which Pierce understood Caples' skepticism. In these hills and in
this camp nothing was what it seemed to be. Caution was on them
all. Pierce returned to his cabin in the side-canyon, dug his
gold pouches out of a sack of beans, and moved down the Gulch. He
slipped between Virginia's tent rows, skirted the black wall of
The Pantheon and so came to Dance and Stuart's store. At this
hour it was crowded, but he caught W. B. Dance's eye and led him
back toward the office. "Like to leave my dust in your safe," he
said.</p>

<p>Dance took Pierce's poke, wrote Pierce's name on a slip of
paper and stuffed it into the neck of the poke. The safe stood in
a corner, its door ajar. When Dance pulled the door back Pierce
saw the layers of other pouches on the safe's bottom. "Young
fortune there," he said.</p>

<p>"That gives you the idea," said Dance wryly. "Someday we'll
have to run the scoundrels out."</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Who's going to start that?"</p>

<p>"There's enough honest men to do it any time."</p>

<p>"Takes something better than honesty," Pierce answered. "The
meek will never inherit Alder." He made his way back through the
crowd, through the aisles of sacked goods and kerosene and canned
peaches, past the shelves of shirts and trousers and supplies.
Clubfoot George sat in one corner, stooped over his shoemaker's
last, He looked at Pierce and showed his sharp curiosity. He
said, "Evenin', Pierce," and got Pierce's nod.</p>

<p>Pierce had a drink at the Senate, and loitered a little while
watching a poker game&mdash;and turned down Wallace Street. He
met Ollie and stopped for a chat. He said, "I'm going to have a
little fun tomorrow and drive stage," and moved on. The lights of
Diana's bakery fanned through an open door. He saw her standing
behind a counter and he stood at the edge of the walk, hard in
thought, with the rankling memory of their last scene reviving,
with some of its suspicion and its wonder coming back. Then, head
down, he plowed his way through the crowd and returned up the
Gulch.</p>

<p>Cap Boyd was a jolly man who, having made his stake in the
Gulch, now prepared to depart from the scenes of his adventure.
He had imposed strict secrecy upon himself and upon his friends,
well knowing that any man who rode the stage to Bannack with
twenty-five hundred dollars of gold dust in his belt was powerful
bait for the Innocents. But still he was a jolly man and
accordingly gathered his few chosen friends around him in the
Senate for a last round of drinks. That last round became an
endless circle which, begun in the Senate, moved on to the Pony,
thence to the Alcazar and at last near midnight ended in
Tanner's. By that time the group of friends had grown into a
young crowd and somewhere near the shank of the evening Gallegher
joined him for the inevitable "Just one more drink, boys, before
I leave." Cap shook hands warmly with Gallegher and mentioned the
sorrow he felt upon departing from the Gulch which had been so
good to him; and the last thing he remembered was his friends
supporting him through the doorway of the Virginia Hotel, all of
them singing one of the less respectable versions of "John
Brown."</p>

<p>Gallegher detached himself from Cap's party at Tanner's and
sauntered to the back room, to be presently joined by Ives and
Marshland. Clubfoot George later came in. Clubfoot said: "Pierce
left his dust in Dance's safe."</p>

<p>Ives drew a long breath of smoke from his cigar. "That's a
give-away, I think. Harry German's sick, so he won't be driving,
I happen to know Oliver once asked Pierce to drive relief."</p>

<p>"Might be," said Gallegher. "I just found out Cap Boyd's going
out on that stage. He's got his dust in a money belt. It'll be
around his belly."</p>

<p>"Should be sizeable," said Ives, and began to make his plans.
"Steve and I will ride down tonight. We'll be camped somewhere
beyond the Beaverhead. In a draw, about halfway to Bunton's.
We'll stop the stage there." But, being a careful man, and one
who also liked to spike all chances, he improved upon the idea.
"I'll have Bob Zachary go to Daly's Roadhouse. He'll get on there
as a passenger and ride with the driver. When Steve and I show up
from the gulch Zachary can throw a fit of being scared and put on
a nice show for us. If the driver tries to draw, Zachary can
nudge against him, pretending to be scared, and spoil his
aim."</p>

<p>"Might be a crowd inside the coach to put up a fight,"
suggested Marshland.</p>

<p>"We need another man riding inside as passenger. I'll find
somebody for that." He looked at Clubfoot. "You hear who else is
booked on the stage?"</p>

<p>"Pfouts is going through. Don't know who else."</p>

<p>"Pfouts could be tough," said Ives. "But I think he's too old
a hand to start a fight with the odds against him. If he does the
other fellow we plant in the coach can act scared, too, and sort
of talk Pfouts out of it. All right."</p>

<p>He returned to the main room, met Ollie Rounds, and walked to
the street with him. "Steve and I are tackling the stage beyond
the Beaverhead tomorrow. Need a man to go down to Adobetown
tonight and go on as passenger when it comes through. If the
passengers get tough, you're to play scared. Or to be practical
about it and talk them out of shooting. Bob Zachary will get on
at Daly's and ride beside the driver&mdash;doing same thing."</p>

<p>Ollie said, idly: "Don't want to leave Virginia tonight,
George."</p>

<p>Ives, who was a lady's man, came to quick conclusions. He
grinned. "Woman?"</p>

<p>Rounds smiled. "I never talk about the ladies, George."</p>

<p>"One of those ex-gentlemen, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Ollie quit smiling. "That's my business."</p>

<p>"Don't get sore," said Ives. He had lost the light on his
cigar and now took time to ignite it. He moved on to Baker's
stable and later reappeared, riding to Van Buren and
disappearing. Ollie Rounds stood fast, still outwardly
indifferent. Rube Ketchum was on the other side of the
street&mdash;and Rube was watching him out of dull, never-
trusting eyes. Presently Marshland and Gallegher came from the
saloon. Both men spoke to him, Gallegher stopping. Gallegher
said, "Good luck, Steve," and Marshland nodded and went away.</p>

<p>"You know what's up?" asked Gallagher.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Gallegher laughed, short and unamused, finding pleasure in the
retribution to come&mdash;"If Pierce is driving, he'll be a dead
man by tomorrow night,"&mdash;and strolled on.</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds lighted a cigar and, as he cupped the match to
the cigar's point, he took this opportunity to scan the far walk,
where Rube Ketchum had been. Rube was out of sight, but Rube
would still be watching. The man had that constant suspicion,
that never-forgetting streak of brutal patience. Rounds crushed
the match between his fingers and he tipped his head and watched
the black night sky. Nick Tibault came by and said, "Hello, Mr.
Rounds," and stopped to look in at Tanner's.</p>

<p>"Go in and have some fun," suggested Ollie. "You work too
hard."</p>

<p>Young Tibault shook his head. "Anna wouldn't like it," he said
and turned from temptation.</p>

<p>Somewhere Rube Ketchum hid himself and watched with his small
red-rimmed eyes. Rounds left his place by the saloon wall and
moved along Wallace in pacing slowness. He came to Van Buren,
teetered on the walk's edge for a full three minutes as a wholly
idle man might, crossed over and returned on the opposite walk of
the street, turning into Diana Oastle's bakery.</p>

<p>Diana was at the moment waiting on a miner. Rounds waited
until the miner had gone, and looked into the rear of the shop to
be sure the baker was gone. "I'm in need of a couple doughnuts,
Diana," he said.</p>

<p>"How would you like a cup of coffee to go with them?"</p>

<p>She had always liked him, he thought; she had never seen
through him. "Just the doughnuts," he said. He brought out a
half-dollar but Diana shook her head. "We came upriver together,
Ollie. So this is on the house."</p>

<p>"Stick by your friends, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He said quietly: "Jeff's driving Oliver's stage to Bannack in
the morning. It will be held up beyond the Beaverhead. They're
laying for him particularly. I can't go to Jeff&mdash;I'm being
spotted. But I'll find Ben Scoggins. I'll tell him to come here.
Have him warn Jeff not to make that trip." He put the doughnuts
into his pocket, noticing the flare of real fear in her eyes. As
he went out he thought of this. There was something wrong between
Diana and Jeff, and it was now odd to find that she had any
feeling for the long-legged tough man up the Gulch.</p>

<p>It was near midnight then, with the crowd thinning out and the
stores closing one by one. Rounds had meant to cut in behind
Scoggins' store and take the rear door, but when he got to Idaho
Street he saw Scoggins come out, lock up his store, and walk
away. Rounds crossed the street and so moved up behind Scoggins.
He murmured: "Go see Diana," and turned across the street,
circling back to Tanner's. He put himself at the bar and took a
pair of whiskies straight, afterwards joining a late game at Will
Temperton's table.</p>

<p>Scoggins had a drink and a bite of lunch in the Senate and
then went to Diana's, there waiting for her to close shop. The
two walked along Wallace Street, toward her cabin. "Where's Lily
Beth?"</p>

<p>"Sleeping."</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "the only time I ever saw her smile was
when she saw you. That little girl was scared of something."</p>

<p>"And starved for something. She's just a little girl. She has
needed a lot of love."</p>

<p>"Wonder," he said, "what her mother was like. This fellow
Temperton loves her, but he never seems to show it. Mighty
strange."</p>

<p>"There are a lot of strange things in the world, Ben."</p>

<p>He was an observant young man and he had a big heart. Now he
offered her a piece of advice. "Someday you'll have to give up
Lily Beth. That will hurt. Don't get too fond of her."</p>

<p>They were at her cabin. She turned to him, saying: "You're
rather wise. But how can you stop being fond of anyone?"</p>

<p>"I guess," he said, "that's right," and looked at her with a
great deal of thought. "You get tied up, and that's it. Maybe in
Lily Beth, maybe in someone else."</p>

<p>"Ben," she said, her voice going away from him, "don't make
too many guesses."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, and grinned. He was a big bland-tempered man
with a shock of blond hair; nothing appeared to trouble him too
much. He had a way of hanging on without seeming to hang on. He
was a man with always a soft answer; but behind the soft answer
was a bulldog tenacity. "What was it you were to tell me? Ollie
was mighty secret about it."</p>

<p>"Tell Jeff not to drive the stage tomorrow. It is to be held
up beyond the Beaverhead."</p>

<p>"Didn't know he was driving for Oliver," said Scoggins. He had
a kind of a mind which took first things first, so that now it
was the fact of Pierce's driving the stage which interested him.
"Must have gotten weary of working like a horse and living like a
hermit. Jeff can't do anything by halves. All of everything or
nothing of nothing. So he digs until he's sick of it, then he's
ready for a bust." He spoke this in his easy, idle way and
meanwhile watched her with his shrewd eyes, interested in her
expression. She saw it and gently rebuffed him. "Ben&mdash;you're
not subtle."</p>

<p>"I can try to be, can't I?" he said. "Can't stop a man from
wondering how tough it would be if he tried his own luck."</p>

<p>"It's Jeff we're talking about."</p>

<p>"Not much danger for a driver in a holdup, Diana. It is a kind
of road agent rule&mdash;to let the driver alone." But now his
mind, marching methodically from point to point, reached a more
important fact. "But he isn't just a driver. The toughs have
marked his number. They'll knock him over."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Diana, "that's it."</p>

<p>He gave her another of his close glances and he saw the way
her thoughts leaped ahead to that possible scene of Jeff's
destruction. She stood silently worried. He said: "It will do no
good to warn him. I couldn't stop him from making the ride. You
know that, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I know. He would listen to you. He would smile and thank
you&mdash;and nothing in the world would stop him from going to
Bannack."</p>

<p>"That's a streak in him. I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "the thing he really hates is force. As far
as Jeff is concerned the world is a brute trying to break him. It
is a challenge he has to meet."</p>

<p>"Why should a man be so tough about it?"</p>

<p>"If you knew his past you'd understand."</p>

<p>Having patiently plodded his way through the problem, Scoggins
now reached the last strange part of it. He stood with his chin
dropped, a fair and easy and honest man exploring the dark alleys
of human behavior. "Ever occur to you, Diana, that it is mighty
funny how Ollie should know about this holdup?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid for Ollie," she said, and said nothing more.</p>

<p>Lifting his head he caught her expression; and between the two
was a common thought at this moment. They both had their
suspicions and shared them, so that now they both knew that their
suspicions were true. Ben's reaction was to say, "Be better if
Jeff didn't know it was Ollie that told us. He likes Ollie. Hate
to spoil that."</p>

<p>"We all like Ollie," said Diana. "That is what makes it so
sad."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Scoggins, who was at bottom very kind, "I ought
to talk with Ollie."</p>

<p>"Nothing you say would help. He's like Jeff in that respect.
He'll make his own hell and his own heaven. I guess we all do,
Ben."</p>

<p>"I guess," murmured Ben, "I'll just get my gun and ride down
to Daly's tonight."</p>

<p>"Why, Ben?"</p>

<p>"I'll be a passenger on that stage in the mornin'," said Ben.
As he said it the motion of excitement went over his face. He
could, Diana realized, fight in his own way for the things he
knew about; but this was a new game and he wasn't sure of
himself. She admired his courage, and she had her own fears for
him. But she offered no advice. Men lived by the light of their
own consciences and though a woman had the power to sway and
change them&mdash;to turn them reasonable when they were
unreasonable, or to turn them mad when they were sane&mdash;it
was not a wise thing to do. For afterwards a man would hate a
woman for the change she had made in him. All she said was, "Be
careful, Ben."</p>

<p>He liked the way she said it. He smiled at her and then the
smile faded and he looked at her with a good deal of wistfulness.
She was a beautiful and robust woman, with woman's soft depth and
woman's spirit and woman's fire so clear to him. He wondered if
these were revealed for him in the way of a signal, or if it was
his own desires that made them so plain. He wasn't sure and,
being unsure, he only said, "Good night, Diana," and turned
about. Ten minutes later he was on the road to Daly's.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; DEATH AT
BANNACK</h2>

<p class="first">AT five in the morning Pierce stepped up to the
coach seat and took the reins from the hostler. He had three
passengers inside the coach, Parris Pfouts, a gambler by the name
of Dustin bound for Salt Lake, and Ed Poe who ran a whipsaw mill
outside of Bannack; and he had Cap Boyd on the seat beside him.
After the large night of celebration Boyd was a shrunken and
pallid man nursing a monstrous headache. The express agent tossed
up the strongbox and the usual crowd collected and Jack Gallegher
passed by. Pierce turned the coach and its four horses around on
Wallace Street and remembered the way Gallegher stared at the
strongbox.</p>

<p>The horses dropped into Daylight and labored up the hill to
the summit. Pierce threw on the brakes for the descent into
Central City, Cap Boyd groaning at every jar and lurch. "My God,
Jeff, I am going to die before we reach Daly's and I'm glad of
it."</p>

<p>The air was crystal clear and high-mountain thin and contained
the sharp essence of the bare brown hills. The sun stood half
below the line of the Tobacco Roots so that the Gulch itself
remained gray-tan while brightness rushed across the upper sky.
The coach ran through Central, wound and bounced along the ruts
and the gravel beside the creek, stopped at Nevada for one
passenger, and continued on.</p>

<p>Smoke lifted from the thousand breakfast fires of the Gulch.
They passed Adobetown and forded Junction's shallow creek, at
this point entering the narrow gorge wherein night's chill and
night's last shadows remained. The horses kept a steady trot and
half-run, the heavy coach-top swayed side to side and the wood
panels rattled and chains clanked and steel hoofs struck sharp
against the rocky undercrop of the road. Boyd gripped the seat
with both hands, turned white and wan. "I can see you have driven
before."</p>

<p>"This used to be my game."</p>

<p>"All drivers," groaned Boyd, "are crazy."</p>

<p>Fourteen miles from Virginia City the Gulch played out into
the valley of the Stinkingwater, crossed Ramshorn Creek and came
upon Daly's, where two passengers waited&mdash;Bob Zachary and
Ben Scoggins. "My horse," said Scoggins, "is lame and I guess
I've got to pay good money to get to Bannack. When did you take
up drivin', Jeff?"</p>

<p>"Relief for Harry German," said Pierce. But he was puzzled.
Scoggins had a shotgun with him, which was unusual, and Scoggins
watched him in a particular manner. Meanwhile Cap Boyd looked
down on Zachary and showed trouble. He climbed from the coach to
stamp his feet around the yard. He said: "I'm too damned sick to
go any farther."</p>

<p>Bob Zachary was a young man with mustache and goatee. He had a
wide mouth and a heavy chest. He stood by, eying Cap Boyd all
this while and saying nothing. Boyd looked at Zachary and shook
his head. "I'm laying over until the next coach," he said, and
started for Daly's Roadhouse. But he pulled up and gave Daly's a
sudden glance and reconsidered his decision. "No," he added,
"might as well go on," and climbed inside the coach. Scoggins
started for the near coach-wheel, intending to sit beside Pierce,
but Zachary was before him. "I'll ride up," he said, and jumped
to the seat.</p>

<p>"All right," Scoggins said, "I don't care. By the way, Jeff,
I've got a new shotgun. If you hear me blazin' away at jack-
rabbits think nothing of it. Want to try this thing out."</p>

<p>He got into the coach and closed the door and Pierce set the
horses into a run, now skirting the Stinkingwater and meanwhile
wondering why Scoggins, who had never to his knowledge cared much
about guns, should be packing the weapon. It was out of the way
and accordingly caught Pierce's full interest. He thought about
it from Daly's to Cold Springs Ranch. One mile beyond Cold
Springs Ranch he paused at Baker's and sat on the box while the
relay man changed horses. He forded the Stinkingwater, came upon
Dempsey's Ranch and halted for a passenger&mdash;a very long and
loose-jointed man with a tobacco-stained beard and a pair of
bright, close-set eyes. Cap Boyd groaned when the new man crowded
into the coach.</p>

<p>The road climbed the yellow ruts from the Stinkingwater
valley, arrived at the summit and undulated forward through long
barren miles of Tolling country. Southward the Rubys stood black;
the McCarty Mountains were bold to the north. Day's sun burned
down and the thin air fanned dryly against the skin; and the
brake handle, when Pierce touched it, was uncomfortably hot.
Scoggins, he thought, was not a man for extra conversation and
Scoggins had gone out of his way to explain that he wanted to
fire the gun from the coach. Scoggins was also sufficiently
experienced with the half-tamed brand of horses in the country to
know that a gunshot would bolt the team. It was a foolish thing
to do; and Scoggins was not a fool.</p>

<p>Suspicion, never at any time fully asleep in him, now freely
fed upon the small things that would not make a reasonable
answer. The land before him pitched up and down in bare brown
swells, and from his place on the seat he was able to look far
out into the trough of those swells, wherein road agents might
wait. The man beside him&mdash;this Bob Zachary whom he only
casually knew&mdash;seemed nervous, and kept sliding on the seat,
crowding into his, Pierce's, side.</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Where's your horse?"</p>

<p>"Lame," said Zachary.</p>

<p>"Everybody's got a lame horse this morning. Get over on your
own side of the seat."</p>

<p>Zachary moved over. After a while he said. "Well, the horse
wasn't lame. Tell you the truth, I'm carrying a little money on
me and I was afraid to ride through alone. The damned country is
full of road agents." The sun was straight overhead but this
Zachary pulled the brim of his hat over his eyes and half rose
from his seat to scan the forward country. "What would you do if
this thing was held up?"</p>

<p>"Haven't thought about it."</p>

<p>Zachary turned on him. "You wouldn't tough it out, would
you?"</p>

<p>"Depends on how the play came up. I've done it before."</p>

<p>Zachary said: "Don't do it. You're up here broad as a barn. So
am I."</p>

<p>They came to the rim of Beaverhead valley, at the bottom of
which the silvered ribbon of river made its lazy loops. Pierce
took the stage down in a rocketing run and stopped before
Copeland's, halfway between Virginia City and Bannack. This being
nooning place he threw the reins to the hostler, went in to eat
and came out to squat under the sun while the hostler brought up
fresh horses. He rested with his eyes half shut. Zachary came out
and walked to the hostler. "Any trouble around here lately?"</p>

<p>"Guess not," said the hostler.</p>

<p>"Glad when I get to Bannack," said Zachary.</p>

<p>Pierce pulled his lids nearer together against the bright sun.
Scoggins strolled along the yard, using his shotgun like a
crutch. He stopped in the center of the yard and teetered on his
heels and cast a short glance at Pierce. Pierce said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we're on a grade when you let go with that gun the horses
will jump right over the rim."</p>

<p>"Won't be on a grade," said Ben. "Just somewhere between here
and Bunton's." Then he added an afterthought: "Simply want to
make a big noise."</p>

<p>Pierce lighted a cigar and bit his teeth into it. The long-
legged passenger came from Copeland's house and moved to the
stage. He stood by the door and he looked at Zachary until the
latter shook his head and climbed to the top seat. Pierce dragged
a deep draught of smoke into his lungs and expelled it. He said:
"All in," and moved to the coach. Climbing up, he kicked off the
brake and moved away from Copeland's, following the east bank of
the Beaverhead. Twelve miles onward the road took a gravel ford
over the river, left the valley and pointed west for Bannack
across a dry and broken area. Suddenly Ben Scoggins' shotgun sent
its hard noise into the hot day.</p>

<p>The horses sprang to a full run. Pierce wrestled them back to
a trot, saying nothing, but Zachary let go with a genuine display
of anger&mdash;"What's that damn fool doing?"</p>

<p>"Trying out his gun," said Pierce. Zachary was again crowded
against him; he straightened his shoulders and gave Zachary a
boost that almost flung the man off the coach. "Dammit, stay on
your own side." He turned his head as he said it and caught the
full flare of a temper that belonged in no timid man's system.
Zachary at once turned his head away. "All right," he said. "I'm
just nervous, I guess."</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Pierce. He had a Colt in his holster and he had
a carbine lying along the footboards; and he watched the broken
land before him with a constant attention. They slammed into
coulees, labored out of them, ran on and dropped again. Bunton's
Ranch, sixty miles from Virginia City and ten out of Bannack, lay
somewhere to the front and the afternoon was well on; the sun
streamed from the low west against his eyes, making it difficult
to sweep the distance. At this point he reached down, put the
carbine between his knees, and spoke to Zachary.</p>

<p>"If we're jumped," he said, "I'll throw the reins to you. You
keep those horses at a dead run."</p>

<p>"You're a damned fool if you do," said Zachary. "You want to
live, don't you? So do I. You play peaceable and we won't lose
anything but money. Look here, friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep those horses at a run or I'll lay you out with the
barrel of this gun."</p>

<p>He saw, then, something for which he had long looked. Off to
the right a pair of hat peaks showed from a deep coulee; and dust
lifted from the coulee in signal of horses coming on the gallop.
Ben Scoggins had also seen it, for the shotgun began to issue its
spanging echoes into the hot and dusty air. Zachary yelled:
"We're jumped! Pull in&mdash;pull in!" And at the same time he
drove his shoulders hard into Pierce's flank and grabbed the
reins.</p>

<p>The sound of the gun had bolted the horses again. Pierce
surrendered the reins to Zachary and then he reached out with his
hand and slapped Zachary twice across the face. He knocked off
Zachary's hat and he brought the muzzle of the gun around. "Keep
going or I'll kill you!"</p>

<p>The hat peaks rose up from the coulee and a pair of riders
rushed headlong at the coach. Scoggins' gun flung its full charge
at them and Pierce pulled up his gun, took aim from the pitching
deck of the coach and began to spot his shots. He saw dust fly
from the strike of the lead. Along the sights of the gun he made
out the two men, both dark-dressed and with neckpieces lifted.
One of the men had a hat with a brim that broke down in the rear;
he noticed that as he fired.</p>

<p>Both men wheeled wide and pounded slantingly back toward the
coulee. One shot reached them, his or Scoggins', and a horse
floundered to its knees and sent its rider out of the saddle. The
man struck the ground, rolled on and on and disappeared beneath
the coulee's rim. The second rider reached the coulee and
vanished in it; and afterwards his gun began to speak back at the
coach. But his revolver was a poor weapon at the distance and the
coach rushed ahead at full speed and in a little while got beyond
range. The firing quit.</p>

<p>Pierce put down the gun and took the reins from Zachary.
Zachary said in a short voice: "Might have gotten us killed."</p>

<p>That was all, but Pierce now had his man spotted. And he also
knew that Scoggins had been forewarned of the holdup. He coaxed
the team out of its run, and, at a steadier trot, brought them
into Bunton's for the last change of horses. It was six, with the
sun ready to slide behind the Bitterroots. Bunton stood before
his corral, no relief horses ready.</p>

<p>"Trouble?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce. "No trouble."</p>

<p>"We got jumped," said Zachary, "but we outran em." He
descended and stared at Bunton a moment and shrugged his
shoulders. The inside passengers got out. "Where's the horses?"
asked Pierce.</p>

<p>"Didn't expect you so soon," said Bunton.</p>

<p>"What did you think might hold us back?" Pierce wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Bunton turned to the corral without answering. Coming down
from the seat, Pierce unhitched and slapped the weary horses away
and waited for Bunton to harness up the new pairs. "You sure have
made it tough on other drivers," Bunton commented. "Those road
agents will knock 'em out of the box from now on."</p>

<p>"That's too bad," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Bunton. "I'm workin' for Oliver's line and I hate
to see anybody hurt."</p>

<p>Pierce said, "All in," and climbed to the seat, waiting for
his passengers to get aboard. The long-legged man had disappeared
into Bunton's shanty and Zachary shook his head. "I've had
enough. I'll make it through after dark." Ben Scoggins suddenly
got out of the coach and took place beside Pierce. He grinned
down at Zachary. "Hard life, friend."</p>

<p>Pierce slapped the horses forward. Sunlight dropped behind the
Bitterroots and the sky turned red and twilight began to run over
the flats. "You knew this was coming," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"I knew it," admitted Scoggins, chuckling.</p>

<p>"Not saying where you heard it?"</p>

<p>"No, not saying. That Zachary was planted on you. So was Long
John Franck."</p>

<p>"Who's Long John Franck?"</p>

<p>"The greasy one that stayed back at Bunton's with Zachary."
Scoggins began to laugh. "Cap Boyd was feeling low until the fun
started. This Long John began to yell for us not to fight back.
He pushed up my arm and spoiled my aim. Cap quit being sick and
got Long John around the throat and damned near choked him to
death."</p>

<p>In full dark Pierce drove the stage before Bannack's hotel,
tossed down the reins and stepped to the walk. Cap Boyd came out
of the stage. "Come on," he said, "the drinks are on me. We'll
have some fun&mdash;"</p>

<p>A cool voice said, "Trouble?" and Henry Plummer moved forward
from the shadows of the hotel, slight and unimpressive and
neat.</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce, "no trouble."</p>

<p>Cap Boyd said: "We were jumped but we got the drop on those
fellows. They never got inside shootin' distance. We drove 'em
right back to the Gulch and we knocked one of 'em off his
horse."</p>

<p>Plummer's pleasant and courteous voice was only half
interested. "That so? You're lucky. I have been expecting
trouble. Been a lot of talk going around. These road agents are
pretty cocky. How big a bunch tackled you?"</p>

<p>"Two," said Boyd. "And I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Let's get that drink," and jiggled Cap's
elbow.</p>

<p>Henry Plummer said: "Any of them look familiar to you, Cap?
Maybe I could get some idea. I'll have to break that stuff
up."</p>

<p>"One was George Ives," said Cap positively. "I'd know him,
mask or no mask."</p>

<p>"George Ives?" said Plummer with surprise. "I wouldn't have
thought it of George. You're sure?" He came nearer Cap and his
mild face remained unchanged. Still, his eyes were large and
round on Cap Boyd&mdash;they were luminously intent.</p>

<p>"Let's get that drink," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"You damned right it was Ives," said Cap positively.</p>

<p>Plummer nodded. "You're lucky, Cap. Be careful where you walk.
They might be sore and hunt you up. Going to Salt Lake?"</p>

<p>"In the morning," said Cap. Then caution came to him for the
first time and he lowered his voice. "Say nothing about that,
Henry."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Plummer, "I won't say a word," and strolled easy-
footed into the dark.</p>

<p>Cap Boyd said, "Well, let's get at our drinkin'." But he
caught the expression on Pierce's face and he drew himself
together and said, "What's wrong, Jeff?" Then doubt came to him,
and a sense of fear damped his jolly spirits. "I guess I talk too
much."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pierce. "Ives will hear what you said."</p>

<p>"Plummer won't mention it."</p>

<p>"Ives will hear of it," repeated Pierce. "You'll have to get
out of town, Cap."</p>

<p>The three of them entered the saloon and got their bottle and
glasses and moved to the free lunch. Cap Boyd had lost his
appetite entirely; he took three whiskies straight.</p>

<p>"I have got to get a horse," said Cap. "But if I show up at a
livery stable they'll catch on. Jeff, get me a horse."</p>

<p>"Who'll catch on?" asked Scoggins. "Who's in town you're
afraid of, Cap?"</p>

<p>Cap shook his head. Pierce paid for the drinks and murmured,
"Follow me," and walked to the hotel. He signed for a room and
went up the stairs with the two men still following. They
threaded a hall to its end and entered a back room. Pierce
lighted a lamp and stepped to the room's open window and looked
through it thoughtfully. He turned back. "Ben, go back to the
saloon. Buy a bottle of whisky, a deck of cards and get some
poker chips. Just drop the remark we're booked for an all-night
game up here." Scoggins didn't understand but he went down the
hall.</p>

<p>Cap Boyd said: "Jeff, we're wasting time. Get me a horse. I'll
start for Salt Lake tonight."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Pierce. He opened the room's door and scanned the
hall; he stepped across the hall to the opposite room, and
knocked softly on its door, receiving no answer. He opened the
door, fading into the black. He Was still inside this other room
when Scoggins returned with the whisky and cards and poker chips.
Scoggins said: "What's up?" Cap Boyd shook his head, and both men
stood in the hall waiting.</p>

<p>Pierce came back. Cap said, "Open that bottle. I need a
drink."</p>

<p>Scoggins said: "Give me an idea what this is all about,
Jeff."</p>

<p>Pierce turned up the lamp wick and pulled down the window
shade. He murmured, "Easy now," and led them into the second
room. At the window he said, "Here we go," climbed through, and
dropped from sight.</p>

<p>Scoggins and Cap Boyd came after him, made a twelve-foot drop
through darkness, and found themselves in a narrow, black
passageway between the hotel wall and an adjoining empty
building.</p>

<p>"The horse idea is out," Pierce said. "No way of going to a
stable without being spotted. If we stole a horse and got caught
it would be a legitimate hanging."</p>

<p>The sound of rapid-traveling riders moved in from the edge of
town. Pierce led the way through back alleys, skirted several
houses, crossed a dark rear road and at last came out upon the
empty land south of Bannack. The three paused here. A dog crept
through the shadows and began a steady barking. Pierce said:
"Start walking for Salt Lake, Cap. Walk by night and hole up by
day until you strike a freight outfit. You'll maybe starve for a
couple days but don't drop into any of the relay stations until
you're fifty miles from this place. Ben, you light out for Alder
and don't show yourself until you reach your horse at
Daly's."</p>

<p>"Where you going?" asked Scoggins.</p>

<p>"Something else." He trusted these men yet his sense of
solitariness and his faith in himself would not let him share his
plans. He put out his arm and took Cap's hand. "Good luck,
Cap."</p>

<p>Starlight threw its frost-gleam down upon the blackness of the
land. Cap Boyd's shape was small in the dark and his shoulders
were round. He stood entirely silent a long while, thinking ahead
and finding no pleasure in his thoughts. He said: "Always liked
to have people around me&mdash;always liked to hear the boys
laughin' with me. This is goin' to be all alone, Jeff."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Pierce, and his voice touched a note of sympathy
and understanding that Ben Scoggins had not thought lived in this
hard man. "You're thinking of a lot of campfires you sat around,
with a lot of men to share the heat. You're thinking of the
Senate and the crowd. But you're always alone when you take the
road. Every man is. And every man, sooner or later, has to take
it. Your friends fall away and the sun goes down and there's
nothing but a black trail moving through a damned brutal world."
He fell momentarily silent, and when he again spoke it was to
share with Cap some of his own bitter rebellion, some of his keen
hatred of the world's injustice. "Don't buckle up. To hell with
anything that tries to stop you. You fight back. You duck and
dodge and hide and you push on. When you get to Salt Lake you can
laugh because you beat the game that tried to beat you. So-long,
Cap."</p>

<p>"So-long," said Cap. For an instant he stood irresolutely
before Pierce and Scoggins. Then he turned and moved west and
disappeared in the dark.</p>

<p>Scoggins said: "My God, Jeff, you really believe that? Ain't
there anything hopeful in your scheme of things?"</p>

<p>"Hope?" said Pierce. "Hope and warmth and a happy end for us
all? Is that what you're talking about? A place where we can fall
asleep and have no trouble? A place for music, and women
laughing, and sunlight always coming over the hill?" He drew his
long breath, and he said, "No, I guess not. I'll see you later,
Ben. Be careful."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Scoggins and then, unmindful of their touchy
position, he laughed aloud. The stray dog kept up its steady
barking; and somebody came to the door of the nearest house, a
hundred yards away, and called at it. "I am a peaceful man," said
Scoggins, "and here I am up to my ears in trouble and likin' it."
Still chuckling, he moved away and was lost.</p>

<p>Pierce turned west on the heels of the vanished Cap Boyd. He
circled the main hulk of Bannack, aiming toward the end of the
main street as it straggled into the open lots and sheds at the
margin of town. From this position he had a decent view of
Bannack's heart and saw the crowd drifting in and out of the
stores and the saloons, A rider came from the west, passing him.
He skirted a barn and aimed at the shadow of a shed&mdash;the
last one on this road&mdash;and moved to it. He went around the
four sides, located the door and stepped in. He heard the
fiddling steps of a horse before him and he murmured,
"Easy&mdash;easy," and struck a match. The horse was a long-
legged bay, saddled and standing on dropped reins. He spotted the
two-by-four stringers and the planks loosely thrown across them.
The light went out. In the succeeding darkness he moved his hand
along the planks, found the cantina which contained Barney
Morris' gold and brought it down. Five minutes later he left the
barn and took to the road, pointed west.</p>



<p><br> Ives and Marshland rode into Bannack a half-hour after
the stage arrived. It was Marshland's horse which had been shot
in the holdup, whereupon he had ridden double with Ives as far as
Bunton's, there picking up a fresh animal. Now, bruised by the
fall, he made for the saloon for a drink and something to eat
while Ives located Henry Plummer. Plummer stood in front of a
store, in deep conversation with Sydney Edgerton, Federal Judge
of the territory, and never looked at Ives as the latter passed
by. It was Edgerton, a very resolute citizen, who gave Ives the
benefit of his sharp glance. Ives moved on into the back part of
town and placed himself beside a shed. It was a good ten minutes
before Plummer came along.</p>

<p>"What went wrong?" asked Plummer.</p>

<p>"Something leaked out. They had the bulge on us."</p>

<p>Plummer said: "Pierce and Cap Boyd and that other fellow are
at the hotel in a poker game. Cap Boyd named you to me on the
street."</p>

<p>"Did he?" said Ives and fell into a soft and wicked cursing.
"By God, I'll stop Cap's mouth." He turned back instantly, found
Marshland in the saloon and drew him out. These two moved up the
hotel stairs and crept soft-footed along the hall toward the
strip of light flushing beneath the room's doorway. There was no
sound from the room. Ives, the cooler and the tougher of the two,
stepped against the door and drew his gun&mdash;and flung himself
into the empty room. A bottle, a pack of cards and a case of
chips stood unused on the table. Ives whipped about at once.
"We've been sold, Steve. Come on."</p>

<p>Plummer was then moving along the main street's walk. He saw
Ives and Marshland reach their horses and trot out of town; and
with instant perception he crossed the street, got behind the
south row of buildings and ran to the rear end of the stable
wherein he kept his horse. He went out the back way and circled
town, coming upon Ives and Marshland half a mile along the
road.</p>

<p>"They slipped out on us," said Ives.</p>

<p>"They had no horses," said Plummer. "Where would they go
afoot?"</p>

<p>"They knew they had to get out on the quiet," said Ives. "That
would be Pierce's idea."</p>

<p>"Cap wouldn't go back to the Gulch. My bet is he's on his way
toward Salt Lake."</p>

<p>"Means nothing," said Ives.</p>

<p>Marshland said: "I keep smelling dust ahead of us."</p>

<p>"I didn't see anybody leave town within the last half-hour,"
said Plummer.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Marshland.</p>

<p>Marshland and Ives immediately retreated from the road.</p>

<p>Plummer seized the bridle of his horse and backed away. Down
the road, in the direction of Bannack, was a small, ragged tattoo
of sound, stopping and starting, and at last becoming the echo of
a man on the run. The man's labored breathing came forward and
presently the man's shadow appeared. When it arrived abreast of
Plummer the Sheriff called: "Who's that?"</p>

<p>The man stopped and his frightened wind lunged out.</p>

<p>He turned as though to run away, and then he said in a
disgusted voice, "Oh, hell," and turned again. "You on the way to
Horse Prairie?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Plummer.</p>

<p>"Give me a leg on your horse," said the man. "I'm damned weary
of walkin'."</p>

<p>"What makes you walk?" asked the Sheriff, and reached for his
matches.</p>

<p>"Lost my horse in the brush. Threw me and ran."</p>

<p>Plummer scratched his sulphur and held it out; and by it he
saw the weary, owl-like face of Cap Boyd. At the same time Cap
Boyd saw him and a loosening wave of relief went over his face.
He drew in his breath. "By God, Sheriff, I'm glad to see you.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, George," said Plummer.</p>

<p>Cap Boyd turned his head, for the first time noticing Ives and
Marshland. Both men had their guns on him, and then Cap Boyd knew
that he was dead. Knowing it he turned his face on Plummer, at
last aware of Plummer's evil and condemning him with a single
terrible glance in which fright and courage and hatred struggled.
Ives and Marshland fired together. Their bullets shook Cap Boyd
off his feet and tore through him. He fell with a small sound and
was dead.</p>

<p>It was Plummer who stepped forward and knelt over Boyd. The
match went out but he didn't take time to light another. He said:
"Four pouches in his belt."</p>

<p>Marshland said: "Still wonder who's ahead of us."</p>

<p>Plummer went to his horse and climbed to the saddle. The three
men remained silent until at last the Sheriff said: "It was
Pierce who brought Barney Morris' money to Bannack in the first
place. You suppose he could have got it tonight and gone on
toward Salt Lake?"</p>

<p>"Let's follow."</p>

<p>"No," said Plummer. "I want to go back to Bannack and find out
if the money's still in Oliver's safe."</p>



<p><br> Pierce caught up with the wagon team fifty miles out from
Bannack, turned Barney Morris' money over to the wagon master and
started back for Alder Gulch by a roundabout route through the
hills. He arrived at Junction four days after his departure from
the Gulch; and at this place met a miner who told him of Cap
Boyd's death. When he reached Virginia City he looked up Oliver.
Oliver told him something else:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That freight outfit was held up night before last. They
killed the wagon master and they got Barney's dust."</p>

<p>"A clean sweep," said Pierce, and said nothing more. He stood
before Oliver and let no expression, no emotion out of him.</p>

<p>"One other thing," said Oliver. "The toughs have made it a
point to get you."</p>



<p><br> On Thursday afternoon, as was his invariable custom,
Temperton called at the bakery for his daughter and took her on
an idle walk through town. Sometimes they explored the Gulch,
pausing to watch the rockers and long toms at work; and sometimes
he hired a rig and drove Lily Beth down to Junction and back. At
six they usually ate at the Virginia Hotel, after which he would
return her to Diana, gravely lift his hat to them and depart for
his evening at Tanner's.</p>

<p>They were a sober, silent pair. Now and then Temperton started
a politely casual conversation and at these times Lily Beth would
dutifully listen and add her brief word when the occasion called
for it. Once in a while he would take her hand and they would
swing along this way; but sooner or later, under some reasonable
pretext or other, she would withdraw her arm. He never appeared
to notice this; yet always at that point the talk would stop for
an interval and he would walk with his eyes affixed to some
object before him.</p>

<p>On this particular Thursday he took her to his room at the
hotel. He said, "I have a small present for you," and got a small
white pasteboard box from the bureau. She took it and thanked him
but didn't open it until he suggested doing so. The inside of the
box had a satin cover and nested against the satin was a rope of
jade beads with a jade pendant.</p>

<p>"I sent to San Francisco for it," he said. "The green should
go well with your new dress."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "It will look very nice. Thank you."</p>

<p>He looked at her intently. "Everything's all right here?" he
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm fine."</p>

<p>"Is there anything you wish me to do for you or for Miss
Castle?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "we're both fine."</p>

<p>The expression of defeat made it brief appearance on his face
and quickly went away. He moved to the window, long watching the
street below him; and he waited there a considerable while,
hoping that his daughter might offer some straightforward and
natural bit of talk that would break the wall between them. It
had to come from her, for he had no way of dropping his own
reserve, he had no knowledge at all of the mind or the heart of
Lily Beth. But she was, as always, silently waiting for him; and
so he turned and said: "I suppose we should go eat. It's getting
on."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lily Beth.</p>

<p>They ate at the Virginia Hotel and returned to the bakery. He
stood a moment, noting that Lily Beth smiled when she was with
Diana and smiled at no other time, and presently he lifted his
hat to them and said "Good evening," and left the shop.</p>

<p>Diana had watched him and she had watched Lily Beth, and she
knew the afternoon had gone no better than before. "Were you kind
to your father, Lily Beth?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I remembered that you said I should talk to him," said Lily
Beth, "and I tried. But there wasn't anything to say."</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE BLACK HAT</h2>

<p class="first">OVERNIGHT winter laid its whiteness on hillslope
and bar. Water buckets froze to the bottom and barrels burst
their staves and ice formed in the creek and the gravel in mine
shafts turned stone-hard. Wind hauled around to the east,
sweeping from the Tobacco Roots down the Gulch, cutting through
clothes and sliding between the warped spaces of building and
cabin.</p>

<p>This was the first warning of long winter to come, therefore
the hardy ones sealed their cabins with old newspapers, banked
dirt around flimsy tents and prepared for the long siege, while
the discouraged ones and the lonely ones prepared for departure.
The stages leaving Virginia City were filled and other miners,
troubled by the road agents, began to organize large parties,
whereby to make the outbound trip with some assurance of
safety.</p>

<p>All prices jumped. Virginia's human driftwood, which ate
Virginia's scraps and slept in the open, now began to crawl
tentatively into the back end of livery barns. Cold weather
shortened the work day, so that miners spent more time in the
saloons and at the card tables and tempers heated and sudden
quarrels raged up and the hill cemetery showed its fresh mounds
of dirt. Each day the toughs grew bolder and a feeling of terror
spread like a smell up and down the Gulch. Each night the creek
gold poured over the bars of Tanner's, the Senate, the Pony and
the other thirty saloons and dance halls and hurdy-gurdy
joints.</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds left Tanner's in the twilight of one afternoon
and stopped at the bakeshop to pass the time with Diana. He wore
a heavy buffalo coat with a fur collar, which drew Diana's
admiration. "Where'd you get it, Ollie?"</p>

<p>"Bought it from a fellow down on his luck."</p>

<p>"You're warm&mdash;and he's cold," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't be so kind." He was well-fed and momentarily at peace
with himself and in this mood could be as attractive as any man.
"If everybody in this world started out warm, with money and food
and jobs, half of the world would be cold again inside of a year.
Some are foolish, some lazy, some blind. And some are unlucky."
He helped himself to one of her doughnuts. "Which is why I've
never permitted ambition to eat out my heart. Wanting little,
I've never been much disappointed."</p>

<p>She gave him a critical study. "You have a good deal of
talent. None of it you use. Is it because you're afraid of
failure that you never have tried to get on?"</p>

<p>"I don't like to be cold, I don't like to fail and I don't
like to be hurt."</p>

<p>"So," she murmured, "you'd rather not try anything." Then she
grew angry with him. "Men were not meant to be like that. Men
were meant to fight."</p>

<p>"But for what?" he asked and ceased to smile.</p>

<p>"To remain men with pride and self-respect. To work, because
we must all work. To do something about the cruelty and meanness
around us."</p>

<p>"Like Jeff," he idly commented. "He fights. Look what it has
done to him."</p>

<p>"What," she asked swiftly, "has it done to him?"</p>

<p>"Made him unhappy. Made him a man surrounded by toughs who
mean to kill him."</p>

<p>She said, thoughtful and deliberate, "I doubt if he asks
happiness. I doubt if he asks for anything at all. I think he's
proud to have the toughs hate him."</p>

<p>He regained his cheerful manner. "Let him take my share of the
struggle. I'd still rather be warm." He passed out of the bakery
into the steady sweep of cold wind. Darkness lay on the land and
lights sparkled through Virginia City's window panes. He turned
up Wallace Street and for a few minutes visited with Scoggins.
After that he returned to a stable, got his horse and galloped
down the Gulch. At Daly's Roadhouse he ate supper and stood at
the bar, drinking steadily and alone, and went to bed. Rising at
five, he moved on toward Bannack. A few miles beyond the
Beaverhead he dipped into a coulee and found Ives and Buck
Stinson and Rube Ketchum waiting.</p>

<p>This day was bitter-cold. Ketchum nursed his sullen temper and
Stinson was irritable. These three had been talking about him,
Ollie Rounds guessed; it was to be seen in the manner they
watched him. Ives said: "A little bit late, Ollie."</p>

<p>"Daly's was warm," said Rounds. "Anyhow, we've got an
hour."</p>

<p>"No," said Ives, who had been standing at the edge of the
gulch, looking eastward, "it is coming now."</p>

<p>The four men turned their neckpieces up around their eyes.
Ives said: "Buck and I will head in the horses; Rube will roust
'em out of the coach. Ollie, you take the other side of the
coach. After everybody gets out you go inside and see that
nothing's been hidden under the seats. Look into the luggage
too."</p>

<p>"Anybody in particular coming through?" asked Stinson.</p>

<p>"Fellow by the name of Jack Hilton. Clubfoot George says he's
got couple thousand in dust." He put his bare head over the gulch
rim and brought it back. "Buck and I'll go out first. You two
stay back a few seconds, in case there's trouble. If so, you open
up from here." He got on his horse and signaled Stinson. "All
right," he said. The two rushed along the gulch toward the road
and suddenly flung themselves at the coach. The rattle and slam
of the coach was a clear sound; and over this sound lifted Ives'
abrupt shout. "Pull up!"</p>

<p>The coach halted at once. There was no echo of trouble,
whereupon Rounds and Ketchum rode from the gulch and galloped
forward, Ketchum taking the coach's near side. Rounds circled to
the off side. The driver sat still, holding tight reins on his
horses and showing more irritation than fear. Ives said:
"Everybody out. Get down from the box, Bill."</p>

<p>"What the hell?" grumbled the driver. "You want these horses
to run away?"</p>

<p>Ives moved to the off leader and took grip on the rein. "Get
down. No damned foolishness either."</p>

<p>The driver jumped to the ground and the passengers stepped
from the coach one by one, prompted by Ketchum. Ollie Rounds came
forward and now entered the coach to inspect it. He heard Ives
say: "Get back up, Billy, and throw down the box and the
luggage." Rounds left the coach and kicked open the blanket rolls
and the suitcases as the driver threw them; he found one filled
poke in a bedding roll. Ives was now sharply speaking to the
passengers lined up beyond the coach. "Stand tight. It is too
damned cold to be fooling." Then, coming toward Ives, Ollie
Rounds had his first sight of the six passengers standing with
their hands lifted. One of them was Ben Scoggins.</p>

<p>He whirled at once and stepped behind the coach so that he
would be out of sight. But Scoggins' glance had caught him. He
stood fast, now hearing Ketchum growl: "Hilton, what'd you do
with it?"</p>

<p>"What?" said Hilton.</p>

<p>"Cut that out," said Ketchum. "You're salted with dust. Where
is it?"</p>

<p>"Think I'd bring dust on the stage?" said Hilton. "I'm no
damned fool."</p>

<p>"Ain't you?" asked Ketchum. There was, suddenly, some sort of
scuffle. Rounds stepped ahead so that he might see it and as he
came around the horses he caught sight of Ketchum pacing backward
from the row of passengers. Ketchum aimed deliberately at Hilton
and fired twice, tearing life out of the man before he fell.</p>

<p>Ives shouted in a gritty voice. "Stop that, Rube! All
right&mdash;get aboard!"</p>

<p>Hilton lay curled on the hard ground, dead. The passengers,
shocked silent, walked around Hilton and climbed inside the
coach. But Scoggins remained where he had been, looking at the
dead man, and presently his glance rose to Ives, and moved to
Ketchum, to Stinson, and at last to Rounds. There wasn't much on
his face, Rounds thought. But Scoggins' eyes were a pale,
squeezed-out color and feeling violently came from them. Ben was
giving himself away, Ollie thought; there was so much fury and
hatred in the look that Ives or Stinson or Ketchum, seeing it,
might shoot him down. He turned immediately, speaking to Ives.
"Let's get out of here."</p>

<p>Scoggins was the last man in the coach. The driver had
returned to his seat and called down, "I'm reaching for my
tobacco," and slowly dug a hand into his pocket. He took a
massive bite on the plug and settled himself.</p>

<p>"All right," said Ives. "Go on."</p>

<p>The driver released the brake, The coach rolled on, its panels
clattering and its big wheels bumping the ruts. The driver
shouted the horses into a steady run.</p>

<p>"Rube," said Ives. "What'd you do that for?"</p>

<p>Rube said in his surly monotone: "He didn't bring his
money."</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here," repeated Rounds; and at his word the
four men trotted eastward. Wind pushed steadily at them. Around
noon they arrived at Daly's. Ives and Stinson and Ketchum stopped
here but Rounds pushed up the Gulch. Somewhere beyond Daly's,
cold as it was, he removed his buffalo coat and tossed it into
the brush. When he reached Virginia City, chilled to the marrow,
he went directly to Dance and Stuart's, there purchasing a new
cloth coat. "Some son-of-a-gun held me up last night," he said to
W. B. Dance, "took my money and my watch and my coat."</p>

<p>He went to his room in the Planter's Hotel, ordered a jug of
hot water and shaved. As he shaved he met his own eyes in the
mirror and he saw the signs of weakness at the corners of his
mouth, so that at last the face in the mirror disgusted him. He
finished his shave and lighted a cigar, and he began a steady
pacing around the room. He'd had his neckpiece over his lower
face but he remembered how intently Ben Scoggins had watched him.
He remembered, too, the sound of Hilton's broken wind and the
deadness on Hilton's face as he fell. Rounds stopped his pacing
and stood still, knowing it would be better for him if he left
the Gulch at once. There was always a time when a man's errors
caught up, when some sign or signal gave him away, That warning
came to him now as a premonition; and as he walked back to
Tanner's the idea of escape was strongly in his mind. But after
he drank three whiskies in a row the old carelessness and the old
sense of futility took possession again and he shrugged his fears
away. He moved to Temperton's table and joined the game.</p>



<p><br> Hilton was a man well known in Virginia City and the news
of his death caused a strong reaction in the Gulch. Somebody, in
the heart of night, put a sign on Tanner's which read: "The men
who killed Jack Hilton probably hang out here. Maybe, before long
they will <i>hang out</i> somewhere else."</p>

<p>There were rumors as to the road agents. None of them were
definitely known, yet the Gulch had its guesses concerning the
fancy idleness of Virginia's men who toiled not and did no
spinning; it had its evidence of careless words dropped by some
of the toughs, and it had its suspicions. Twelve thousand men,
all watching, reached a certain community thought regarding the
identity of some of the toughs. And so if was that Gallegher fell
under the cloud and knew it and grew defiant and contemptuous of
it; and George Ives was suspected, and Rube Ketchum definitely
pegged. There were others on whom a more nebulous suspicion was
pinned as well&mdash;and Tanner's was generally regarded to be
their rendezvous. Yet, knowing or suspecting, the Gulch did
nothing. The miners did not cohere. Half-knowing their enemies
and half-realizing their power over them, they were yet too
unsure to strike or too indifferent. And meanwhile, as they stood
indecisive, the toughs grew bolder and words were openly passed
in Tanner's.</p>

<p>There was an undercurrent running, though, unknown to the
toughs or to the bulk of the men in the Gulch. Parris Pfouts came
up the Gulch and stopped one night to speak to Pierce. "A little
rough," he said. "If we could just get a few good men together .
. ."</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce. "Not yet."</p>

<p>"How long, are we to stand around and watch this?"</p>

<p>"Till the Gulch forgets to cry for sinners," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"Some of us," said Pfouts, "are beyond crying. Seems to me
you'd be glad to throw in. They're after you."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that," said Pierce. "I wouldn't ask a
committee to do it."</p>

<p>"You're not doing anything yet," pointed out Pfouts.</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce, "not yet." He gave Pfouts a long look. "Why
should you care?"</p>

<p>"A man wants to see his neighborhood clean," said Pfouts.
"People have got a right to live in peace."</p>

<p>Pierce pointed to the cook-fires along the Gulch, to the
lights shining through tent walls and cabin windows. "They cry
for sinners, or they're afraid, or they don't care. If they won't
clean house, let them live in a dirty house."</p>

<p>"No," said Pfouts, quietly stubborn, "it is up to us to make
them see. If they do not see and will not act then the good and
just must act for them."</p>

<p>"The good and the just will get no thanks for it, Parris."</p>

<p>"Why," admitted Parris, "that is perfectly true. The good and
the just always stand alone, in the beginning. They always suffer
for it, in the beginning. But then, when they show the way,
people follow. That is the obligation of the good and just."</p>

<p>"You believe in being your neighbor's keeper?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Pfouts. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce bluntly. "I am my own keeper. Nobody cries
for me, and I will cry for no other man."</p>

<p>Pfouts smiled a very gentle smile. "My boy, you are too hard.
You do not know about weakness. Some men are strong. Some see the
truth, some do not. The strong must lend their strength to the
weak or there will be no justice, and those that see the truth
must make the blind ones see it or there will be no truth."</p>

<p>Pierce stood fast, disbelieving and yet closely listening; not
to the words so much as to the way Pfouts spoke them, with a ring
and a conviction. Pfouts smiled and Pfouts seemed to
understand.</p>

<p>"No man," said Pierce, "ever defended me in need. No law ever
went out of its way to protect me. There's only one law I ever
knew about, and I had to make it for myself. You know what that
one is? Protect yourself and survive."</p>

<p>"But," said Pfouts, "you will not survive under that law. You
may live to be a thousand, but under that law you will
nevertheless die another way in short order, and the rest of your
years will be no good." He got on his horse, looking down through
the dark at Pierce. "Injustice usually makes men bitter. Now I
will say something which seems to make no sense. You will have to
be hurt again before you cease to be bitter. When a man gets hurt
and grows weak he sees what weakness is like&mdash;and then he
comes to have pity for others who are weak, instead of despising
them as he formerly did. And when he is weak he discovers that he
needs help&mdash;and then he knows that nobody can stand alone in
this world."</p>

<p>He went down the Gulch toward Virginia City, disappearing soon
in the shadows. Two days later, the hard and sharp wind remaining
steady through the Gulch, Jim Williams came before Jeff's cabin.
Weather had whipped his dark face red and increased the
expression of melancholy on it. He wore a plaid muffler tight-
wrapped around his neck.</p>

<p>"Scoggins said one of that road agent outfit wore a buffalo
coat."</p>

<p>"Lot of buffalo coats around," Pierce suggested.</p>

<p>"That's right." He was about to add something, but studied
Pierce awhile and apparently forebore. Then he said: "From the
descriptions, though, I think I know two of those fellows. It's
Ives that wears a hat with a brim flopped down in back. The other
one was Ketchum. No mask could cover his dog growl."</p>

<p>"Why didn't Ives think to change his hat?" said Pierce. "I
guess they're getting pretty bold. They don't care much."</p>

<p>"No," said Jim Williams, "they don't care much."</p>

<p>This was supper hour again and fires burned along the Gulch
floor, whipped bright by an unrelenting wind. Williams watched
this sight. "Funny thing. They know&mdash;all those
boys&mdash;what's wrong. And they know how to fix what's
wrong."</p>

<p>"They're not ready yet," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Williams, "they're not ready yet." He gave Pierce
his rather gentle smile, behind which the coolest kind of a
temper lay. There was steel in him, there was darkness and
wildness in him, covered by his softly melancholy manner. This
was the quality which drew Pierce to the man; and in turn it was
that quality which drew Williams to Pierce. They were both alike.
Williams said, "So-long," and drifted away.</p>

<p>Pierce cooked his supper and did up his dishes. He stoked the
cabin stove and drew a burlap curtain across the window. The wind
had risen and the cabin corners were shrilly singing. Somebody
pounded on the door and Archie Caples announced himself and came
in with George Noon and Mack Sturgis who had adjoining claims.
Sturgis brought a bottle of Valley Tan, whereupon Pierce got out
his tin cup. They had a drink, after which Caples said, "I'm
bound for town. Got to pick up a hundred pounds of spuds." He
pulled the collar of his coat around his ears and settled his hat
solidly on his head. "We're going to be snowed in fast one of
these days. You fellows better be forehanded and lay in plenty of
grub, like me." He opened the door, slid quickly through, and
slammed it behind him.</p>

<p>Noon said, "How about a poker game?"</p>

<p>Pierce dragged an army blanket off his bunk and spread it over
the cabin's small table. He brought out a deck of cards and a
pile of chips. Wash McMurtry knocked and came in. "Cold outside,"
he said and opened his heavy coat. Noon said, "Have a drink,
Wash," and pushed the bottle at him. There was only one chair in
the cabin so that when they settled around the table Pierce sat
on the bunk, Noon used the chair while McMurtry and Mack Sturgis
used stove-wood for seats. They fell to the game, idly
talking.</p>

<p>Noon said: "Hard winter coming. Leaves dropped early, antelope
came out of the high hills sooner than usual." Noon was an old-
time mountain man who had trapped his beaver with Bridger and
Carson and Sublette. He was here now, digging for gold, making
the last stand of an aging man who had never known anything but
the plains and hills and never wanted to know anything else. He
had a long beard and untrimmed hair falling to his shoulders; he
had a set of restless eyes and a hawk nose and he wore old-
fashioned fringed buckskin still. "Have a drink, Jeff," he said.
"Whut's life fer if not to have some fun?"</p>

<p>McMurtry said: "You'll get your fun. Camp's turning
rotten."</p>

<p>"All camps," said George Noon, "get rotten. You crowd men
together and they spoil. Natural way of man is to be alone a long
time, then to come to settlement just to git the sulphur and hell
outen him, then to go back and be alone again."</p>

<p>McMurtry looked at his cards and said, "Can't open. That's all
right for a hermit like you. But I'm a town man. So're most of
the rest of the Gulch folks. Not right to see crooks flourish and
good men die off."</p>

<p>Noon gave him the benefit of an old Indian fighter's
eyes&mdash;sharp and sun-faded and showing the ice and iron of a
complete individualist. "Dyin's natural too. Whut difference does
it make how a man dies? You fellers are all too tender."</p>

<p>McMurtry said: "Jeff's not tender."</p>

<p>"Why now," said Noon, "I wouldn't mind havin' him at my elbow
in case we was jumped by twenty Rapahoes. But he's a town man,
too. Ain't no town man really tough. In towns you got to live
next to somebody. Then you got to think of that feller's rights.
When you get to thinkin' of the other feller's rights you're
tender. I don't think of noboly but me. My skin and my meat. Jeff
looks tough, but in a pinch he'd risk his skin to get somebody
else out of a hole. That ain't bein' tough. I have seen him get
mad at somethin' somebody did to somebody else. If he was tough
he wouldn't give a damn."</p>

<p>Pierce grinned. "You talk too much, George."</p>

<p>"That's whut camp does to a feller. I ought to be in the hills
lookin' fer sign and listenin' to the owl hoot. When you hear an
owl hoot in the hills chances are it ain't an owl but a Ute
givin' signal. Sure I talk too much. I'm gettin' old and mighty
soft. I should be dead."</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to continue speaking; and closed it. One
sharp, short sound whipped along the wind. George Noon lifted his
head, an old horse smelling fire. The sound came again, flatting
through the rumble and racket of the night's rising storm. Pierce
put down his cards. He reached out and dimmed the lamp's light
and took his gun and belt from the bed. The other men had risen.
Noon was at the door. "Not far off." A third shot broke on the
heels of his words.</p>

<p>George Noon had opened the door. Pierce, moving rapidly over
the room, went through it with the other men following. Cabin
lights sparkled through the black and windy night and cabin doors
came open to show their yellow squares. Men were calling and
lanterns began to bob up and down. There was a light still
burning in Archie Caples' cabin. Since Caples was a thrifty man
and now had gone to Virginia City, this struck Pierce as odd.
Ahead of him another man stirred, quite near Caples' cabin.
Pierce called:</p>

<p>"Archie&mdash;that you?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. The man faded into the dark and then
Pierce caught the sudden crush of his boots against the frozen
creek gravel. Pierce had been at a walk. Now he broke into a run,
rounded Caples' cabin and saw the door open. He put both hands on
the door's frame and looked in. What he saw made him turn about
so swiftly that he struck the following George Noon head on. He
pushed Noon aside and rushed downgrade, still hearing the scut-
scut of the fleeing man. Cabins stood all the way along the
creek, so that he had sight of the running man from time to time
in the light beams, but dared not fire. He reached the creek's
edge, hearing the splash of water ahead. The fugitive had crossed
over, whereupon Pierce forded the creek and ran against the
pitted, gravel-strewn edge of the Gulch. He heard the man fall
and let out a yell a hundred feet before him. This was near
another cabin; and now the owner of the cabin opened his door and
came cut and flung a call at Pierce.</p>

<p>"Hold up there!" he shouted. "Hold up or I'll blaze away!"</p>

<p>Pierce pulled in. "You damned fool!"</p>

<p>"Pierce? I thought somebody was fooling with my sluice."</p>

<p>The fugitive was now lost. Pierce swung and walked back to
Caples' cabin and pushed through the gathering crowd of miners,
into the small room. Archie Caples lay face down on the floor,
dead in his own blood, both hands thrown ahead of him and both
hands tight-clenched. George Noon and McMurtry were kneeling over
Caples and McMurtry said: "He's got a shoelace in his left hand.
Must of grabbed at the other fellow's foot as he dropped."</p>

<p>"Been a hell of a fight around here."</p>

<p>Everything in the cabin had been ripped loose or broken or
torn apart. The stove stood undisturbed but its chimney had been
knocked down, so that smoke rolled up through the place and made
the crowding miners weep. Caples' blankets were on the floor and
his bed tick had been opened and its straw scattered. The flour
barrel had been emptied, the woodbox tipped over. Somebody had
made a rapid search for Caples' hidden dust.</p>

<p>There was a voice outside, saying: "Let me in there,
boys."</p>

<p>Over in one corner lay a black, dirty hat. Pierce, moving
through the small room, saw it and was arrested by it. He stood
over it, knowing that it was not Archie Caples' hat. He bent down
and picked it up; and turned to see Jack Gallegher shouldering
through the door. Gallegher stared at the dead Caples. "Another
shootin'?"</p>

<p>George Noon said: "Damned fool question."</p>

<p>"Looks like a holdup," said Gallegher. "Anybody see the
fellow?"</p>

<p>Eight men crowded in this small ten-by-twelve room and half a
dozen more looked in at the doorway and a hundred men stood out
in the dark. But nobody answered Gallegher. Everybody looked at
Gallegher, distrusting him and offering him no information.
Gallegher shrugged his shoulders. "Hell of a note," he said, and
then noticed the hat in Pierce's hand. "You find that here?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Caples'?"</p>

<p>"Not Caples' hat."</p>

<p>"Then," said Gallegher, "I'll take it," and moved his arm
confidently forward. "Maybe I can get an idea."</p>

<p>"I'll keep this hat," said Pierce.</p>

<p>He saw&mdash;and all of them saw&mdash;the streaky hardening
of muscles on Gallegher's jaw. He stared at Pierce with his black
and insolent and close-guarded eyes. Trouble went through the
place like a bad smell, rank and stifling. Pierce met it better
than halfway.</p>

<p>"I can find this fellow as quick as you can, Jack. Maybe
quicker."</p>

<p>Gallegher shrugged his shoulders. "I don't care," he said, and
left the cabin.</p>

<p>Noon said: "The hell he don't care. Know whose hat that is,
Jeff?"</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce, "but I can find out."</p>

<p>George Noon grumbled. "It ain't none of your business."</p>

<p>"I liked Archie Caples."</p>

<p>Noon turned to McMurtry and Sturgis. "You see? He's
tender."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE CAPTAIN'S
GHOST</h2>

<p class="first">THE call started in the Gulch on the morning
following Archie Caples' death and by afternoon three hundred
miners whose claims lay around Virginia City had gathered about a
roaring fire near Archie's cabin.</p>

<p>There was no particular leadership to the crowd, for the habit
of live and let live was very strong. But men grouped up and
talked the matter over and the mass feeling was clearer than it
had ever been. Those who had been indifferent were now shocked
into violent anger, and many of those who had been afraid now
found comfort in the general sentiment. Archie Caples had been
well known and well liked, the killing had been brutal and near
at hand. If lightning struck this close it was only a matter of
time before it came still closer. That was the tone of the talk.
Now and then some man, growing bolder, mentioned the one concrete
way by which the Gulch could be cleansed.</p>

<p>A miner from Summit way first openly said it. "Well get
nowhere at all by talking. Everybody knows it, too. Get your men
and hang 'em."</p>

<p>George Noon remained a skeptic. "Hang who?"</p>

<p>"We can pick some damned good candidates on short order," said
the Summit man.</p>

<p>"Who'll kick the box from anunder 'em?" asked George Noon, and
found no immediate takers. He said then: "Talkin's one thing,
doin' is another. You boys are just lettin' off steam."</p>

<p>Pierce moved through the crowd, listening to the slow bubble
and rumble of the various conversations; and saw the same defect
George Noon had noted. Three hundred miners, if they wished,
could sweep the Gulch clean from Summit to Junction. But these
men were still individuals; they were not yet pulled together.
Occasionally somebody stopped him to ask about the hat, whereupon
he would answer: "Haven't found out about it yet," and move
on.</p>

<p>Jim Williams arrived, carefully assaying the temper of the
meeting but not adding any particular remark of his own. Parris
Pfouts appeared with Neil Howie. John Lott, from Nevada City,
came by, as did half a dozen other townsmen definitely on the
right side of the fence. Gradually as the afternoon wore on
sentiment began to weld the crowd; everything had been talked
over and convictions were pretty well arrived at. Somebody again
asked Pierce about the hat.</p>

<p>"Haven't been to town yet to look into it," he answered.</p>

<p>The crowd waited for him to continue, and he observed that
Williams and the townsmen waited. These townsmen, long biding
their time, now felt the opportune moment had arrived. The miners
were ready to act and needed only the voice of one man who would
shape their sentiments, who would step out in front and take
control. Understanding this, the townsmen waited for Pierce to do
the logical thing. But he did not rise to the opportunity. He
remained silent, not trusting this crowd which once had washed
away its convictions in a flood of tears. What had to be done for
Archie Caples, he would do himself.</p>

<p>Wash McMurtry said: "The stage has been braced three times in
a week. A man with any money on him is a sure mark for a holdup
or for a killing. We're fat cows for the toughs. Every once in a
while when the toughs want meat, they just lead out another fat
cow and slaughter it. What the hell's the matter with spunk? We
could roll down this Gulch and tear every hurdy-gurdy and joint
to the ground in half an hour. We could run every tough out of
town before dark came."</p>

<p>Someone deep in the crowd called: "Well, let's do it."</p>

<p>McMurtry said at once: "Come right out here and say it louder.
Then maybe we can do it."</p>

<p>The man stayed where he was. The crowd agreed with McMurtry,
but it would not follow him. He lacked, somehow, the magic of
authority; and so the crowd, angry yet indecisive, waited for a
surer voice and a better man to follow. Williams, coolly gauging
all this, now spoke for the first time, presenting the
opportunity once more to Pierce.</p>

<p>"What're you going to do, Jeff?"</p>

<p>"I'll find out about the hat," said Pierce. It was all he
said, and he said it short and quick. The crowd was before him
and around him; he was in the center of it. He had a feeling then
that if he raised an arm and pointed it at Virginia City all
these men would turn and go with him. The faith of men came out
and touched him with its warmth. It was strange how that warmth,
that faith and confidence, penetrated to those deep places in him
which were lonely and empty. It unsettled him and brought up
queer promptings and for a little while he was close to these
men, and liked them, and had a moment's pride and a moment's
quick response. But it was not enough. The old ways came back,
the old hard belief in himself alone, the old thought of survival
and solitary duties done without favor and without help.</p>

<p>"What happens if you find whose hat it is?" asked Williams,
still pressing the chance.</p>

<p>"I'll take care of Archie Caples," he said.</p>

<p>He noted the look of disappointment on Williams' face, and
John Lott showed irritation, and Parris Pfouts regretfully shook
his head. McMurtry once more tried his hand. "We know about Ives.
We know about Ketchum. All we got to do&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jack Gallegher had arrived at the edge of the crowd and called
for a way through. He rode into the circle and called out
cheerfully: "Anything you fellows want me to do?"</p>

<p>McMurtry, who had been so brave, looked at Gallegher and met
Gallegher's steady stare, and suddenly turned away into the
crowd. That, Pierce thought, was the way this crowd was and would
always be. Before Gallegher its bravery died. Knowing Gallegher
for a tough these men were suddenly afraid for themselves and
fell still.</p>

<p>"What's on the bill?" said Gallegher, still affable. "You boys
want action?"</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Not from you, Jack."</p>

<p>Gallegher flashed back his quick answer. "You speakin' for
everybody?" His show of easy friendliness dropped away. The crowd
so clearly distrusted him that he felt it and understood it and
was angered by it and recklessly abandoned the part he had been
playing. "Pierce," he said, "you're a damned troublemaker. You've
run into me once before. I let it go. I'm gettin' tired of
letting it go."</p>

<p>Maybe, Pierce thought, this man was working himself up to the
point of shooting. Bitter as the day was, Gallegher wore no
overcoat. He held his reins in his left hand, his right hand free
to drop and seize the near-by butt of his gun. Pierce himself
wore his big navy revolver beneath his overcoat and this bit of
carelessness, he knew, Gallegher had instantly noted. This was
the moment of advantage and Gallegher's eyes mirrored the forming
thought, the gathering impulse. Pierce said, "I thought you were
the man that was my friend," and took an idle step forward. He
was at the horse's head. Gallegher, weighing each second of time,
saw his chance grow narrower and made his decision and reached
for his gun.</p>

<p>Pierce batted the horse across the head, unsettling the beast.
At the same time he caught Gallegher by the arm and dragged him
out of the saddle, seized the Deputy on the point of his
shoulder, and flung him through the air.</p>

<p>The Deputy hit the frozen gravel, let out a sharp yell, and
tried to pull himself up. Pierce jumped at him, dropped both
knees full on the Deputy's belly. He seized Gallegher's gun and
threw it back under the feet of the crowd&mdash;and stood up and
waited.</p>

<p>Gallegher lay breathless on the ground and slowly kicked his
feet into the gravel, pumping back his wind. The noise of his
throat, like an empty vomiting, turned one man in the crowd sick,
for he murmured, "This is none of my affair," and moved away. He
was afraid as well and that fear caught on at once&mdash;the fear
of Gallegher's vengeance and the vengeance of the toughs. The
crowd began to drift until at last only half the miners
remained.</p>

<p>Gallegher rose to his feet, ash-white and struggling so hard
with the pain of his fall that he clenched his teeth into his
lower lip. Pierce said: "I told you to let me alone, Jack.
There's no fun in the way I fight."</p>

<p>Gallegher looked around and failed to see his gun. "All
right," he said, made cautious by his helplessness, and went to
his horse. He climbed to the saddle and bent over in it, and for
a moment laced his hands across his belly. He got hold of the
reins and lifted them. He gave Pierce a full-burning glance and
murmured again, "All right," and rode off.</p>

<p>George Noon spoke up. "You did wrong. Should of killed him.
Whut stopped you?"</p>

<p>Pierce said irritably, "I don't know." Williams and Lott and
Pfouts and the other townsmen remained, and a few miners. But the
bulk of the crowd had gone. He said to Williams: "There's your
crowd. That's what they'll do."</p>

<p>"No," said Parris Pfouts, "they were ready to go with you. It
was just a word they waited for. You didn't say it."</p>

<p>"I'm not the keeper of their morals," answered Pierce. "I wave
no flags and I lead no parades. I'll take care of Archie
Caples."</p>

<p>"Alone?" said John Lott. "You're a little too proud of your
ability."</p>

<p>Pierce shot an affronted glance at John Lott. "I will let you
merchants make speeches concerning law and order. Why didn't you
make your pretty speech here? I don't ask your opinion as to what
I can or cannot do."</p>

<p>Lott was a redoubtable citizen and his feathers went ruffling
up. "I'll pass judgment as I please."</p>

<p>Pierce bluntly said: "You're another talker. I don't like
talkers."</p>

<p>Lott would have shot back his instant challenge had not Jim
Williams made a gesture at him. "Never mind, John," he said.
"This hand's been played."</p>

<p>Parris Pfouts added his reasonable voice. "All Lott meant was
that Gallegher will gather the toughs and come after you, Pierce.
It is a challenge they can't let pass."</p>

<p>"Just talk," said Pierce, still unyielding. "There's too
damned much talk."</p>

<p>"Not this time," said Pfouts, still soft of voice. "This time
they've got to take you out or lose their authority. You're
marked."</p>

<p>Jim Williams put a hand on Pierce's shoulder. "There must be
no misunderstanding between us. We must stick together. You and
Lott have no disagreement."</p>

<p>He was a gentle-voiced, melancholy soul, a sharp judge of men;
and he possessed a temper which when roused was a deadly thing.
But he liked Pierce and now he was the peacemaker. Pierce
shrugged his shoulders and smiled at Lott. "Forget it, John," he
said.</p>

<p>Lott nodded. "Of course."</p>

<p>Gray dusk began to settle along the Gulch. Pierce returned to
his shack, cooked up supper and made a quick meal. It was full
dark then. He stoked the stove, shrugged into his overcoat and
turned down the lampwick He shoved the revolver into an overcoat
pocket, took the hat which he had found at Archie Caples', and
left the shack. Wind bit at his ears and sliced along his cheeks.
He put a foot in the water bucket and found the water again
frozen solid.</p>



<p><br> Reaching Virginia City he went directly to Dance and
Stuart's store. "Dance," he said, "has anybody been in here
buying hats last night or today?"</p>

<p>Dance said: "I'd have to ask the boys," and went along the
counters of his store, questioning his clerks. Pierce meanwhile
watched Clubfoot Lane work at his shoemaker's last in the corner
of the store. Lane was a large man with his alternate moments of
smiling and dark silence; this was the end of a day and now he
worked in silence. He gave Pierce a single look, noticed the hat,
and went on with his labors. Dance came back. "No," he said. "I
guess everybody's got a hat."</p>

<p>Pierce went to Pfouts and Russell's, and from there to each of
the mercantile stores. He found one place where a sale of a hat
had been made. But it had been a hat for Nathaniel Langford, and
there was no question of Langford at all. He came into Scoggins'
and asked the same question.</p>

<p>"Let's see the hat," Scoggins asked. He took it and tried it
on his head. "Yes," he said, "I sold a hat. Seven and a quarter
size. That's what this is."</p>

<p>"Who was the man, Ben?"</p>

<p>Scoggins looked shrewd. "A small-time bum in Tanner's bought
it. But it wasn't for him. I know that because he just ordered
the hat and didn't try it on. Somebody sent him after it."</p>

<p>"What kind of a hat?"</p>

<p>"A black hat, stiff brim, dented on four sides, not creased
down the middle." He said: "How you been?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Look thinner than you was. Going to the ball?"</p>

<p>"What ball?"</p>

<p>"Why, hell," said Scoggins, "it's been talked about for a
week. At the Virginia Hotel tomorrow night. All the good folks in
the Gulch will be there. All the nice ladies." Scoggins looked
down at his hands, and added: "I'm taking Diana." Then he looked
up to catch whatever might be on Pierce's face. Pierce, naturally
a tall man, straightened and what Scoggins saw was a confused and
surprised expression. A ruftle of feeling moved plainly through
Pierce; a thought stirred in him, and left its uncertain track.
But he covered it immediately and only added: "Good for you,
Ben," and started from the store. He had reached the doorway when
he called suddenly back, "That the hat, Ben?"</p>

<p>Scoggins came forward in time to see Rube Ketchum idly move
along the wall of the Senate. Rube Ketchum was a huge, clumsy
shape inside a heavy overcoat; a muffler covered his ears and he
wore a new stiff-brimmed black hat.</p>

<p>"That's the hat," said Scoggins.</p>

<p>"I had the idea it would be," Pierce said dryly.</p>

<p>"What's next?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows what's next, do they?" said Pierce, and left the
store. He was thinking of Archie Caples and of Caples' big hands
drumming the Sunday washboard. He was thinking as well of Barney
Morris now five months dead on the hill and of Mary
Morris&mdash;somewhere in Ohio. He did not mean to be bound to
these people. Their lives were not his lives; and still their
lives had turned to tragedy because of a brute world. It was the
brute world against which all his anger rose.</p>

<p>Ketchum had walked on around the corner of the Senate,
apparently unaware of being watched; he bowed his head against
the knife-thin wind. Pierce turned the Senate's corner and kept
Ketchum's heavy and bulky shape before him. The street crowd was
pretty small on this cold black night. The saloon doors, as he
passed them, sent out steady currents of warmth. Ketchum, now at
the corner of Van Buren, hooked around it.</p>

<p>The Virginia Hotel was at that corner; and coming forward
Pierce saw a man ride out of the windy night and stop at the
hotel's porch. The man got down, his back to Pierce, and he tied
the reins to the ring post by the hotel, and for a short moment
he faced the hotel and stared at it; afterwards the scrape of
Pierce's feet drew his attention and he turned&mdash;and as he
turned he showed the square and blocky-bearded face of Mister
Sitgreaves.</p>

<p>Pierce had not forgotten about Sitgreaves. Sitgreaves was part
of his past and his past always remained with him, like the slow-
burning coals of an old fire. But he had not recently been
thinking of Sitgreaves and this now was a shock that set him
back. Sitgreaves' somber eyes grew round in recognition and he
seemed to settle and take on weight, He had, Pierce thought,
judged Sitgreaves properly in the beginning; this man was a
bloodhound who would never give up until death came.</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Five months is a long time."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Sitgreaves, "I lost your trail. After Lewiston
there was no trace&mdash;until I met a man who had seen you, But
I went the wrong way. I went to Utah."</p>

<p>"The subject seems firm enough in your mind."</p>

<p>"Why," agreed Sitgreaves, "I am a firm man and my people have
all been firm."</p>

<p>"Step around the corner to the Senate. We will keep warm at
least."</p>

<p>"There is no object in talk," stated Sitgreaves. "No object at
all."</p>

<p>"I have a gun in this pocket. Just step into the Senate."</p>

<p>Sitgreaves shrugged his shoulders; but obeyed. The two of them
turned into the saloon's smoky warmth and moved at the bar,
Pierce wiggled a finger for bottle and glasses. He waited for
Sitgreaves to pour a drink, afterwards pouring his own.</p>

<p>"It is devilish cold weather," offered Sitgreaves, "The
Bitterroot passes will be closed soon, I think. The drink will
help. But,"&mdash;he gave Pierce the full benefit of his black,
zealous eyes,&mdash;"I cannot drink with you in any sense. I will
not tie any sentiment of mine to any sentiment of yours. You
understand?"</p>

<p>Pierce nodded and downed his drink. He stood by, watching
Sitgreaves take a pair of whiskies straight. Sitgreaves pressed
the back of a hand across the damp ends of his mustaches.
"Bully," said Pierce, "I don't want to fight you."</p>

<p>"If that is the extent of this visit," said Sitgreaves, "let
us end it. The affair is out of your hands. The both of us cannot
live."</p>

<p>Pierce spoke in a reasoning way: "I was trapped aboard that
ship, Bully. I did not come aboard a free man."</p>

<p>"True enough," agreed Sitgreaves. "Otherwise we would have had
no crew out of San Francisco. It is a custom of the sea. It may
not be a rightful custom." He dipped his head in a moment's
contemplation. "I have thought somewhat of that lately. The sea
is hard. Still, that changes nothing. You killed my brother."</p>

<p>"He tried to kill me."</p>

<p>"Of course. You were ordered not to jump ship. Let us admit
you were shanghaied. But you were on board nevertheless, under
the Captain's law. That is the only law on a ship. Makes no
difference how you get there. You were there. There is just that
one law."</p>

<p>"But this is land," Pierce pointed out. "And the law is
different."</p>

<p>"So it is," agreed Sitgreaves. "I have thought of that too
somewhat, I would not know if there is a law to bring you to
book. But that does not matter greatly. I will take care of
brother Neal."</p>

<p>"I expect you'll try," said Pierce.</p>

<p>Sitgreaves gave him a surprised glance. "I have no recourse.
It is a long way back to Portland. I will not bother to find an
officer in this camp to arrest you and take you back. Maybe it
would be impossible to convict you in a land court if I got you
back there. Landsmen do not understand. You see what that leaves
me?" He spoke evenly and fairly, with a heatless conviction.</p>

<p>"That is your side of it," said Pierce. "Listen to mine. I
have never lifted a hand at any man unless he lifted a hand at
me. I let people alone. I wish to be let alone. Your brother
tried to kill me. Now here you are. It is a little different with
you. You feel you are right, and I give a man credit when he
feels he is right. If you were a road agent I'd have no
hesitation about you at all. But it is your brother you are
thinking about, which I can understand. I would hate to draw a
gun on you, Bully. Better think again."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Sitgreaves politely.</p>

<p>"All right," said Pierce. "It must be your way."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Sitgreaves. "Let's not talk about it any
more."</p>

<p>"I have got a few things to do," said Pierce. "I'd like not to
have to think about you for a day or two. Is that agreeable?"</p>

<p>"I can make no bargain with you," announced Sitgreaves.
"Understand me. I am a patient man, and a just one. My people
have been patient and just. I have come a long way and I am not
in a hurry. But I will make no bargain or truce with you." He
nodded at the bulk of the gun in Pierce's overcoat pocket. "You
have your opportunity now. You had better take it."</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce, "go on. Get out of my sight."</p>

<p>But Sitgreaves was not satisfied. "I can accept no favor from
you. I do not accept this as a favor. I want you to know that. I
will hunt you, fairly or any way. I will shoot you in whatever
situation that seems best. You might see me when I fire. But you
might not. My mind is clear on that point."</p>

<p>"You're a fool," said Pierce. "If I shot you now you'd be
dead."</p>

<p>"No," said Sitgreaves, "you are wrong. If you shot at me now,
you'd miss. Justice is entirely on my side and I cannot be hurt.
I have no fear. The bullet is not in your possession which will
kill me. But I have the bullet which will kill you."</p>

<p>He had the dark, long and in-brooding face of a Yankee witch-
burner; an intense and colorless flame burned in him. He wore the
armor of impregnable faith, double-buckled by righteousness. He
was the judge and the executioner and his own gods were clear
before him. Pierce shook his head. "Go on, Bully. Go on."
Standing at the bar, he watched Sitgreaves leave the saloon.</p>

<p>He poured himself a second whisky but he never drank it; for
then he remembered Rube Ketchum and he turned and left the Senate
at once. Sitgreaves was at the moment going around the corner of
the hotel. In the other direction, toward Van Buren, Pierce saw
Rube Ketchum in front of Jarman's big freight stables. He crossed
the street diagonally, moving at Ketchum and at once drawing
Ketchum's attention. Ketchum shifted, crossed the street and
entered Van Buren. When Pierce reached the corner he saw
Ketchum's heavy body pass in and out of the store lights.</p>

<p>Two hundred feet separated them. Pierce quickened his steps,
bucked the hard wind and had closed half the distance by the time
Ketchum reached Wallace Street. Coming around that corner Pierce
found Ketchum stopped near Tanner's. Ketchum, knowing that he was
followed, seemed at last to decide upon a stand. He had his back
to Tanner's wall and he had his revolver lifted and pointed in
the general direction of Van Buren Street&mdash;waiting a fair
shot. As soon as he saw Pierce he steadied his aim and fired.</p>

<p>A team and wagon was at this moment coming down Wallace
Street. The teamster stopped the horses, wrapped the reins around
the brake handle and made a broad jump from the wagon and rushed
toward the shelter of a wall. Two men near Tanner's retreated to
an alley. Somebody inside Tanner's pushed open the swinging doors
to study the scene, and vanished. The music in The Pantheon
stopped. A man tried to lift the window of his second-story room
in the Planter's Hotel, failed, and smashed the glass with his
gun.</p>

<p>That first shot went wide and short of Pierce. He came
forward, with his navy out of its coat pocket, until he was
abreast the outshining lights of Diana Castle's Bakery, and he
had a thought about her as he moved across the light, into the
street's half darkness, there taking a short side-step and
pausing. Rube Ketchum fired again over the long distance; and
then, having missed twice, Ketchum's courage faltered and he
started to turn at Tanner's door. This was the way Pierce's
bullet caught him, tore into him and knocked him against Tanner's
wall. Ketchum dropped his gun and his new hat fell off and went
rolling with the wind. He put both hands flat against the wall
and his knees touched it and he collapsed reluctantly to the
walk. The teamster started for his wagon, got halfway to it, and
wheeled back for shelter again. Jack Gallegher ran out of
Tanner's with George Ives behind him. The crowd in The Pantheon
moved to the street and women stood shivering in the cruel wind,
hands crossed against their bare shoulders. Ives bent down and
put a hand on Ketchum, and straightened to speak to Gallegher.
Then both Gallegher and Ives looked toward Pierce.</p>

<p>Diana came to the door of her bakery at the sound of the
firing and saw Ketchum fall. Pierce was not more than ten feet
from her door, reared straight in the windy night, his revolver
balanced, the expression on his face solemn and cool. It was hard
for her to describe the effect it had on her. He was one single
man standing thoroughly alone in the heart of a brutal town; and
he knew it and even then she felt that he was looking into
closing shadows and finding no future way for him, but that he no
longer cared. He held fast, she thought, to the only thing that
had ever meant anything to him, to his belief that the world was
a savage thing seeking to destroy man, and that man's sole
purpose was to fight back and survive. He stood there, defying
all that the world might do to him, a man born to resist and to
be alone. And yet this one quality crowded all gentleness out of
him and made impossible the deep friendships a man needed. He
knew that as well as she knew it.</p>

<p>For, watching him with care and anxiety, she felt that for all
his resistance and for all his courage, he was near the end of
his rope. The joy of battle was gone for him, his horizons slowly
closed down and he really no longer cared if he survived. He was
tired and without hope and a little sick at heart over a life
whose vigilance and distrust had slowly squeezed the fun out of
him. And he had at last realized it, she thought. Somehow it was
on his shoulders and in the very way he held the gun half
lifted.</p>

<p>Gallegher stepped to the street's middle. Ives stood by the
fallen Ketchum. Both men closely watched him, and Marshland moved
from Tanner's, and Scoggins came around the corner of Wallace
Street rapidly, and Ollie Rounds stepped from the Planter's and
stopped dead in his tracks when he saw this scene. Diana noticed
the way his face lost its easy calm, and for her it seemed to
show terrible things in the half-shadows and half-light&mdash;the
head-on clash of his loyalty with the other black secrets of his
life. She had long had her suspicions about Ollie. She was
entirely certain now. Ollie, looking on at a man he greatly
liked, was held fast by the associations he had with Ives and
Gallegher. He could not move.</p>

<p>Pierce called to Gallegher, to Ives. "There's your man. Send a
better one next time."</p>

<p>"Pierce," said Gallegher, "throw down the gun. I've got to
take you in."</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce, "I won't fall for it, Jack. You're a
mongrel dog, eating scraps somebody else throws at you."</p>

<p>Terror squeezed Diana's heart, terror chilled her. Pierce's
voice gave Gallegher no quarter, he made it almost impossible for
Gallegher to draw back. Here he paused and built his own fate
word by word. Gallegher stood quite still, but his head turned
and he looked at Ives and Marshland who stood together. Far down
the street she saw Boone Helm, watching. It was Ives who said,
calmly enough:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're damned rough. What could you expect Gallegher to do
after that talk?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Pierce, "to crawl away unless you backed him
up."</p>

<p>Ives gave a short, reckless laugh. "You want me in on
this?"</p>

<p>"Come in," said Pierce. "This time you've got no coulee to run
for."</p>

<p>Ives laughed again, loud and sharp. He threw a small, careful
gesture at Gallegher; he moved away from Tanner's door and away
from Marshland and he called through the driving wind: "Never
would turn any man's invitation down, Jeff."</p>

<p>Scoggins moved in until he was at Tanner's doorway, behind
Marshland. Marshland turned and said something at Scoggins.
Scoggins grinned and held his ground. George Ives kept waving
Gallegher aside and as Gallegher retreated to the farther walk
Ives paced forward until he stood in the street's middle, facing
Pierce. He stopped here. He flung his head aside and saw
Scoggins, and he frowned at Scoggins. "What the hell you want?"
he asked. Then caution came back to him and he made a half-turn,
and at once the bravado and nerve went out of him. Behind him,
idle against the wall of Dance and Stuart's store, Jim Williams
waited and listened. Near Williams was the stocky, indomitable X.
Biedler.</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Well, George?"</p>

<p>Ives shook his head. "Not now, Jeff. Not now." Diana drew a
deep, relieved breath, and then stopped breathing. Pierce said in
a long and taunting tone: "Brave man, George."</p>

<p>Ives shook his head and moved toward the saloon. Pierce
suddenly laughed at him, and wheeled away. He saw Diana and he
halted and seemed about to speak to her, the black humor now out
of him and a kind of despair on his face.</p>

<p>One distant voice spoke through the wind and a gun shouted and
Pierce's body wavered as though hard hit by a weight and a look
of wonder came to him, He pulled himself around, drawing his gun.
Gallegher stood rooted. Marshland and Ives had not moved. It was
none of these. Williams and Scoggins were turning rapidly to
search the street and Rounds ran forward, pointing at an alley
near Dance and Stuart's. "In there!" he yelled. Then the gun
shouted again and Diana saw a little tongue of light leap from
that alleyway.</p>

<p>Pierce doubled over but he didn't fall. He knelt and braced a
hand against the ground, his other hand pushing into his right
side. That hand turned red and his lips flattened against his
teeth and the muscles of his jaws hardened against the pain he
felt. Other people were on the far walks afraid to move because
of additional gunfire that might come. Ollie Rounds had done a
strange thing. He had walked out into the street until his body
was between Ives and Pierce. He put his back to Pierce, facing
Ives; saying nothing and doing nothing, but forming that shield.
Scoggins remained by Marshland. Jim Williams stood still by the
Planter's. Parris Pfouts came from Wallace Street on the run and,
joined by Biedler, moved toward that aperture which had held the
unseen marksman.</p>

<p>So, for this moment, Pierce was alone on the street, going
through his private hell while cold wind tried to shove him over.
Diana was nearest him, but she didn't move. He turned his head
toward her and then she remembered all the humiliation she had
known at his hands, all the fineness he had swept aside, all the
glory they had lost. She remembered it and knew its cause was
that indescribable iron spirit in him which made him suspect and
resist and treasure nothing but his own strength. And this made
her say to him now:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you needed help, Jeff, I'd be there. But you don't need
help, do you? You don't believe in kindness or pity. You stand
alone, and you fall alone&mdash;and there you are. That's what
you have always said. How does it feel?" She didn't realize how
her voice rose with long-pent-up feeling. Ollie Rounds swung and
looked at her, and now ran toward Pierce, Scoggins came on from
Tanner's. But before either of them reached Pierce, Lil Shannon
rushed from The Pantheon, dropped on her knees and put her arms
around him. Standing stone-still in the bakery doorway, Diana
watched men come forward and lift Pierce and carry him into the
dance hall.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; LIL ASKS HER
QUESTION</h2>

<p class="first">THE bullet had struck Pierce in the pit of the
stomach and, except for a bone button on his overcoat, would have
torn its way through him. The heavy button had deflected the slug
around his right side where, striking a rib, it had gouged out a
chunk of flesh and nothing more. When they stripped off his shirt
they found the slug, flattened by the impact, lodged against his
trouser belt.</p>

<p>Doc Bissell, called into The Pantheon, improvised a bandage
while Pierce stood stripped to the waist before a hundred men and
women and was embarrassed enough to blush. He got hurriedly into
his shirt. Lil helped him put on his coat and said: "You come
with me."</p>

<p>"No, I'll go back home."</p>

<p>She got a bottle of whisky from the bar and took Pierce's arm.
"I want to talk to you," she said, and led him across the dance-
hall floor to a little rear room. She closed the door. She said,
"Sit down," and put the bottle on the table. There was only the
one chair, so she stood against the door. She said, "You need a
drink, Jeff," and watched him tip the bottle. He had a wide
chest, he had black eyebrows, he had the smoothest and most
stubborn and, at this particular moment, the most inexpressive
face a man could own. He ran a hand across his face, as though to
wipe away the fog before him, and then he put his hands before
him and looked at them. He glanced at her, troubled by a thought.
"Did I yell when I dropped down?"</p>

<p>"No, Jeff."</p>

<p>"Somebody yelled. I felt a little mortified about that.
Thought it was me. But what would I yell about?"</p>

<p>The fall had shaken his pride. What really mattered was the
fact that he had been physically knocked off his feet and for a
little while had lost his grasp on the world. He was going back
through the scene now, painstakingly filling in the blank spots.
"Two bullets were fired. That's right, isn't it? I went down.
Scoggins and Ollie came up. And you were there." He stopped and
seemed to be puzzled. "Wasn't somebody else there?"</p>

<p>She knew then what was in his mind. She said: "She was
standing in the bakeshop doorway. But she didn't come to
you."</p>

<p>He stared at the bottle. "What did you want to tell me,
Lil?"</p>

<p>"I was the one that came to you. Not Diana."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"Take another drink."</p>

<p>"I don't need that big a crutch to walk on."</p>

<p>She walked to his chair and stood behind him. She put her
hands on his shoulders. She laid the warmth of her hands against
his neck and pulled his head gently back until it rested against
her. "I wish you'd get drunk enough to forget all the queer
things in your head."</p>

<p>"Not enough whisky in town to make me forget very much,
Lil."</p>

<p>"You're a man, the same as any other man. You've known women
like me. Why don't you take me just as I am?"</p>

<p>"I like you too well."</p>

<p>"Like? That's a thin word. Why do you have to put me up on a
pedestal? I don't want to be there. Not with you. I never asked
you to put me there." She moved around the table so that she
might see him. She shrugged her shoulders and made a little
gesture of defeat. She moved the tip of a finger swiftly across
her eyes. Other women could afford tears but for her they were a
luxury. Nobody wanted tears from her. "Men," she said, managing a
smile, "take what they want from a woman, and beat her down to
get it. That's the part of them always hunting. And yet when they
have done that to a woman they hate her for what she has
permitted them to do. Bad as they are, they have got a streak of
goodness in them. I guess it never dies, not even in the worst of
men."</p>

<p>"You're a wise girl, Lil."</p>

<p>"I wish," she said, still smiling, "I were not that wise." She
gave him a keen look, this woman who knew men so thoroughly. "The
kind of a woman you will want will not love you as you are now.
It is strange how clear you are to me and how much a puzzle to
everyone else. You don't want anyone to be sorry for you."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't ask anybody for anything."</p>

<p>"You don't understand people. People want to be asked for
things. They want to feel they're needed. Here I am. I would give
you anything you asked of me, because I know you need me or a
woman like me. It would do you good to get drunk and wake up and
find yourself in a woman's arms. It would do you good to feel
ashamed of that, and know that you're not as strong as you think.
Nobody can live cold and friendless. Nobody can live alone."</p>

<p>He got up from the chair. He stood near her, smiling down.</p>

<p>And then she said, answering his smile, "I am a little sad,
Jeff. It would be so nice if I could have the one thing you want
a woman to have. George Ives will kill you. Or if he doesn't
succeed, one of the crowd will."</p>

<p>"They'll try," he agreed and turned into the big dance hall.
Rounds and Scoggins waited for him. The three went on into the
street, finding Jim Williams there. Williams said: "You got an
idea about that fellow who potted you?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't one of the old crowd, Jim." He moved down Wallace
Street with Scoggins and Rounds. The bakeshop door was closed
when they passed it. He gave the lighted window a swift glance
and saw Diana inside, and turned his head away. He said: "You
don't have to walk up the Gulch with me."</p>

<p>Rounds murmured: "I always take a stroll about this time.
Reminds me of blossomtime in a little ivy-clad cottage at
Concord."</p>

<p>"Massachusetts man?" asked Scoggins with a Yankee's
interest.</p>

<p>"No," said Rounds, "there was no ivy around my home."</p>

<p>When they reached the cabin, Pierce fired up the stove and
filled the coffeepot. Scoggins stretched full length on Pierce's
bunk, well-pleased with himself. "That Marshland curls at the
edges in any sort of trouble. Not tough at all. Ives is the tough
lad but he didn't have a good hole card, so he folded."</p>

<p>"Just for that deal," countered Rounds. "He'll be in the next
one."</p>

<p>Pierce found two tin cups and filled them, and kept the pot
for himself. He hoisted the pot at Ollie and Ben. "Both you lads
moved in on that scrap. I appreciate it."</p>

<p>"Why," said Scoggins, still amused at himself, "I'm damned if
I wasn't surprised to find myself where I was. I must be getting
good."</p>

<p>"Ollie," commented Pierce, "never stand out in the middle of
nothing like that again. You made too big a target."</p>

<p>Scoggins looked at Ollie, his eyelids pulled half together,
and Rounds met that glance and after awhile turned away,
buttoning his coat. "See you later," he said, and left the
cabin.</p>

<p>Pierce stood by the door with his back to Scoggins. "Ben," he
said, "have you asked Diana to marry you?"</p>

<p>Scoggins squinted at the tin cup. He moved the cup in a slow
circle, watching coffee creep up to its edge and spill over. He
took one more drink and got up from the bunk. He placed the tin
cup on the table. "No," he said, "not yet."</p>

<p>Pierce said, "Don't let anything hold you back," and turned
from the door. He passed Scoggins without looking at him. He took
up another stick of wood and chucked it into the stove. He
slammed the stove door shut with his foot, shaking the stove on
its flimsy legs. Scoggins cleared his throat. He adjusted the
collar of his coat and turned to the door. "Well, sentiment
maybe."</p>

<p>"To hell with sentiment," said Pierce. "You're your own
man."</p>

<p>"Then what was I doin' out on the street tonight?"</p>

<p>"I said I appreciated it," retorted Pierce.</p>

<p>"Why," drawled Scoggins, smiling in a broad, unamused way, "it
doesn't matter a damn whether you do or don't. Ollie and I were
there because we had to be. No man's his own man entirely.
Everybody owes somebody else something."</p>

<p>"You paid off tonight," said Pierce. "Now you're your own
man."</p>

<p>"Wrong again," said Scoggins. "It goes deeper than one debt or
one payment. Those sort of books never come to a balance. If a
man owes something to somebody, he just keeps on owing it. Never
any such thing as scratching it off the slate."</p>

<p>"What do you figure you owe me?"</p>

<p>"Why, I like you. So does Ollie. I guess that makes an
obligation. You like us. There's your obligation. People live
that way. Be a damned cold, unfriendly world if they didn't, As
for this other thing you mentioned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Pierce. "No use talking about it. You don't
need advice from me. Go ahead. That's what you'll do anyhow. It
is what you should do."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Scoggins. He gave Pierce a look in which
doubt and irritation were mixed. He wanted to say more but
presently shrugged his shoulders and left the cabin.</p>

<p>Wind shouldered against the log walls. Cold wind knifed
through the door's bottom and through the cracks of the eaves.
Pierce put the coffeepot back on the stove and sat in the chair,
crouched near the stove with his hands idle across his heavy
legs. Sitgreaves had disclaimed any hurry and then Sitgreaves had
improved his first opportunity and had taken those two shots at
him.</p>

<p>He was surprised at himself. He should have turned from The
Pantheon and hunted out Sitgreaves and had this thing over with,
fired up by the old black resentment at an unjust world. But he
now sat still and didn't care. He found a cigar and lighted it
and crouched forward in the chair. There was a crack in the
stove's grate, through which he saw the dance of pale red flame.
Now and then the flame turned to a kind of coral rose, which was
the color of Diana's cheeks when the strong wind flushed
them.</p>

<p>He had seen little of her during the last five months and yet
she had never been out of his head on any day. Somewhere during
each day's hours, and particularly at hours like this one, she
moved before him as an actual presence and he heard the tone of
her voice, sometimes deep and very gentle, sometimes lifted to a
moving anger. What he remembered now was the way she had looked
at him on the street, a foreign soul hating him for something he
had done to her. What had he done to her?</p>

<p>He bent lower in the chair, the cigar clenched between his
teeth and his hands locked together and a steady heartbeat of
pain on his right side where the bullet had chewed its way. This
night, for the first time, he had disliked Ben Scoggins' cheerful
smile; it had irritated him. His thoughts slid away from that
irritation, but he brought them back, as hard on himself as he
was on any other man, and he made a painful search for the
reason, and found it. Then he asked himself, "What kind of a
claim have I got to her or to any living soul?"</p>

<p>He had no claim. When he realized that he took the cigar from
his mouth and straightened in the chair. Lately the words of men
had begun to sing a common tune at him, as though they had gotten
together to talk about him, and to make it a point to warn him.
These men were somehow now facing him in the room. He saw their
faces, Ben's and Ollie's, and Archie Caples' who was dead, and
Barney Morris, also dead&mdash;and the faces of Parris Pfouts and
of Jim Williams. More or less they had all said the same thing,
as Lil had said it this very night: "Nobody can live alone." Why
not? He had always lived alone. He got up from the chair again,
moved by the restlessness which always came of thoughts like
these. He thought of Mary Morris reading the letter he had
written her concerning Barney, and he thought of Lil who was a
woman, fragrant and soft and willing, and and he remembered how
Archie Caples used to speak of his family; and then he was once
more seeing Diana before him. It invariably came to that.</p>

<p>He put on his overcoat and wound a heavy muffler around his
neck and ears. He got his wool gloves and his shotgun, turned
down the lamp to a faint glow, and left the cabin. Wind nailed
him to the wall for a moment. He had to slip the edge of his
shoulder into the wind to move on and so circled the cabin and
walked on back to the lee edge of the canyon where he had stacked
a pile of wood. He settled against the woodpile, sheltered from
the straight drive of the weather. The world was ink-black,
tortured by a wind that had not lessened for a week. Here and
there on the Gulch floor miners' cabin lights made frosty points
and a small glow hung over Virginia, half a mile away. All these
lights were feeble man-made points of rebellion against the stark
and ancient and endless emptiness of the universe. Those lights
would die and the emptiness would be complete. He had been alone
too long to expect anything else, or to nourish any hope.</p>



<p><br> He came into the Virginia Hotel around nine o'clock and
found the ball in progress. They had gotten the musicians from
The Pantheon but otherwise this was strictly for the genteel. The
chandelier was decorated with pine boughs and the bracket lamps
were draped with green gauze, on which wax flakes had been
scattered to imitate snow. All the available proper ladies of the
Gulch, from Junction to Summit were here, their gowns looking
sedate in contrast to eyes accustomed to the color and flash of
the hurdy-gurdy girls. Some of the men, like John Lott and W. B.
Dance and Wilbur Sanders, wore broadcloth, white shirts and
collars. Otherwise it was straight Gulch costume and trimmed
whiskers. The music was a waltz, the fiddles and guitars bearing
down heavily on the accent. Stags lined the walls, waiting their
turn. One of the dance committee, Neil Howie, moved around the
couples, sprinkling more wax on the floor, and at this same
moment A. J. Oliver and X. Biedler were escorting a gentleman to
the door, he having started his evening too early at the Senate.
Oliver shrugged his shoulders, not liking the display, but the
short and powerful Biedler seemed to enjoy this physical contact.
He stood by the door to make sure the drunken one did not return.
He said to Pierce: "Shouldn't be walking through town alone,
Jeff."</p>

<p>Wilbur Sanders wheeled by with a lady. He was a slight, cool
Eastern man short of thirty with brown hair and beard; he
practiced law in Bannack. Pierce talked a moment with Biedler,
meanwhile noticing that a long lunch bar had been set up in the
adjoining dining room. He moved that way, sliding through the
steady crowd of men. In the dining room's doorway he looked back
and caught sight of Scoggins. Scoggins danced with Diana and both
of them were laughing at something said, and the picture of the
girl's face, so free and pleased, struck Pierce hard. He remained
in the door, blocking it, and stopping the drift of the men
around him. Somebody touched his back, but he didn't move. Then
Diana, wheeling nearer, saw him and the smile left her face and
her chin rose and over that distance he caught the half surprised
look of her eyes. Scoggins, now discovering Pierce, also ceased
smiling.</p>

<p>Pierce stopped at the big bar and got a cup of coffee; and
made a sandwich from bread and a huge elk roast. Rounds arrived
and stood with him, not saying much. Oliver drifted in with W. B.
Dance. Presently Sanders came along and Stuart introduced him to
Pierce. This group grew. Pfouts moved out of the ballroom. Pfouts
put a hand on Pierce's shoulder as he talked and Pfouts looked
around at the men near him until his eyes touched Ollie Rounds.
Pierce, forever watchful, saw then a little change on Pfouts's
face and he turned his attention to Ollie and noticed a sudden
shadow come to Rounds's cheeks. In another moment Rounds drifted
from the group. There wasn't anything more than this, yet it left
its impress on Pierce. After a while he broke from the circle,
had another cup of coffee and strolled from the dining room on
through another door to the hotel's parlor. As he came into the
parlor he saw Ollie and Ben and Diana before him; they were
talking and all laughing and then, as before, Diana noticed him
and grew serious. Pierce moved forward.</p>

<p>Scoggins said: "For an invalid you do a lot of spookin' around
on bad nights." He grinned, and yet it lacked the old Scoggins'
cheerfulness. There was a little embarrassment on him, so that he
was no longer easy. The music began again, a square dance tune,
and men moved toward the ballroom. Diana made a part turn to
Ollie, as though to be his partner, but now Scoggins did a
strange thing. He touched Ollie's arm and murmured: "Want to see
you a minute, Ollie," thus taking Rounds away.</p>

<p>Diana gave Pierce one steady glance and turned from him to
watch Scoggins and Ollie move on toward the end of the parlor.
She had been surprised at this, she didn't understand, it and she
didn't want to be thus left alone with Pierce. Pierce said: "If
you'll turn back&mdash;"</p>

<p>She wheeled on him, her glance direct and cold. It was the
same way she had looked at him the night before when, down in the
dust of Wallace, he had heard her strange poured-out bitterness.
She hated him. Then he thought of their long trip together across
the Bitterroots to this camp, and of the one evening when she
stood before him with tears in her eyes, so full of compassion
for him. The memory made an ache in his bones.</p>

<p>"Somewhere along the line," he said, putting one distinct word
after another, "I must have hurt you." He watched her quite
closely, his face showing the puzzle she made for him. "I
remember how your smile was. I have not seen it lately. That is,
you have not used it on me."</p>

<p>"You're the man," she told him, "that never asks for anything.
Are you asking for sympathy now?"</p>

<p>He flushed, by which she knew his extremely strict sense of
pride had been touched. "No," he said, "I'm not. I had my chance
once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't remind me of it," she said, as proud and as severe as
he was. "Maybe it was just my way of trying to be nice to you for
your trouble in helping me out of Portland. I like to pay my
debts."</p>

<p>He went on as though he had not heard her. "I have been
thinking about it lately. A woman who has been friendly to a man,
and then turns against him&mdash;" He shrugged his shoulders, he
shook his head. "The man's done something to make the
change."</p>

<p>"I suppose," she countered, "you would know."</p>

<p>"I'd know. Hate is something I know a lot about. I've seen
enough of it to recognize it anywhere. I regret seeing it in
you."</p>

<p>"It is a little late to talk of that, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He closed his mouth, he set his jaw against her constant tone
of disbelief and chill anger. He bowed his head, taking a steady
control of himself. It was one thing he had in greater quality
than most men&mdash;that power of self-discipline. Looking at him
over the wide gulf which separated them, she admitted his
possession of the quality, and could admire it; but as she
admired it she could at the same time understand how terribly it
had come between them. It was his strength to stand fast. It was
his weakness as well.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he said. "I am not trying to bring up
old ghosts."</p>

<p>"Then why should we talk about it?"</p>

<p>"Diana," he said, "be quiet. I came here tonight to say this,
and I will say it if I've got to tear this damned building
down."</p>

<p>"Yes," she countered, "that would be your manner. You will do
a thing even though you must destroy and wreck and make sinners
of us all to get it done. Go ahead, Jeff."</p>

<p>He drew in his breath, holding back so much that he felt, his
will was a dam behind which the weight of all this grew. "You may
be right. A man can be only what he is. If I have hurt you or
destroyed any good thought you may have had about this world, I
deeply regret it. That is all I came to say."</p>

<p>"Did you ever stop to think how it was destroyed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I have. But nobody can go back over the trail
and make things different. For that matter, I wouldn't want to.
Maybe I'd correct one mistake, and make another that was worse.
It doesn't matter, except that I wish you had met a better man in
Portland. I am the wrong man for any woman to meet."</p>

<p>"Last night when you fell on the street&mdash;"</p>

<p>He showed his one stubborn reaction. "No," he said, "I didn't
fall."</p>

<p>She made an impatient gesture. "You were on your knees and you
looked at me, and for a moment I thought you were going to ask my
help. You've been too proud to do that while you were strong. But
last night you were weak and I thought you were going to go back
on that terrible philosophy of yours and ask me for help. I would
have hated you if you had. The one thing I can honestly admire
you for is your consistency. I think you'll die the same man as
you are now. I don't think you'll cry."</p>

<p>"I did my crying a long time ago."</p>

<p>"I know. It is too bad. . . ." She gave him a long, suddenly
aroused glance, as though wondering now what feelings he hid from
her. She had a new thought about him, so strong that it made her
forget her answer for a moment. "Could it be," she murmured,
"that you are beginning to reap your thistles?"</p>

<p>He said, "Good night," and turned on his heels, going back to
the lunchroom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Scoggins and Rounds tarried at the far end of the
parlor, discreetly observing the scene. "Both look sore as hell
to me," said Rounds. "He's picking a fight, or she is. Why did
you drag me away?"</p>

<p>"They wanted to talk."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"Well," admitted Scoggins, "I didn't. But it seems likely,
doesn't it? Why else would he want to come here tonight, with a
pound of hide out of his ribs? He comes in and looks at her and
she stops smiling like she's been hit in the face. It occurred to
me right at that moment they had something to talk about."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds considered Scoggins, and murmured, "I see."</p>

<p>"What do you see?" demanded Scoggins.</p>

<p>"You're thinking it will get worse between them, or it will
get better. You'd like to know. You've got your own interests in
the matter."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Scoggins, "I have."</p>

<p>Ollie shook his head. "I like you three people as well as I
like anybody alive. I wish you all luck."</p>

<p>"The luck has got to go bad for Jeff, or for me. We can't both
win."</p>

<p>Ollie smiled in a manner that had its shadow of regret.
"That's the hell of living."</p>

<p>Scoggins now showed a degree of anxiety. "I would hate to lose
his friendship, Ollie. But I have got to make my own try. You
think I'm the kind of a man she'd like?"</p>

<p>Rounds shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Scoggins, "you don't want to say. I'd really like
to know."</p>

<p>"Look at her," said Ollie. "She's trying to hurt him clean
down to the marrow. There's your answer, Ben."</p>

<p>"Too bad she's turned against him like that. Makes me feel
sorry for him."</p>

<p>"That," said Ollie, "is the wrong answer. A woman wouldn't go
to that trouble with a man unless she had some other feeling
about him."</p>

<p>Scoggins shook his head. "I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I do," said Ollie Rounds. "I have been through that scene. I
can put myself in Jeff's boots and feel the holes she's tearing
through him."</p>

<p>"He looks just sore to me."</p>

<p>"A mask," said Ollie. "We're all wearing masks, Ben."</p>

<p>Suddenly Scoggins turned to Rounds. He laid a hand an Ollie's
shoulder and he spoke with a tremendous gravity. "Ollie," he
said, "this camp's no good for you. Why don't you leave?"</p>

<p>Rounds stared back, his eyes completely alert. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me that question."</p>

<p>"In the middle of winter?" said Round's. "It would be a hell
of a trip."</p>

<p>"I can think of a trip that might be worse."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be talking to me like this," responded Rounds
irritably.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Scoggins, "I should keep my mouth shut and let
the chips fall."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Rounds, more and more intent.</p>

<p>"Things are happening, Ollie. I'm your friend. The time may
come when I won't be." Rounds had taken a backward step, so that
Scoggins' arm fell from his shoulder. His face was dark and sharp
as he tried to read Ben Scoggins' expression. Scoggins met his
steady stare and added, "I'd hate to think of a time&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now Diana moved over to the two men. The fire and fury of her
talk with Pierce still remained; she was actually still facing
Pierce, and seeing him. Both Scoggins and Rounds waited for it to
pass and it was Scoggins who said, easy and humorous: "We're two
different fellows, Diana."</p>

<p>Ollie Rounds excused himself, walking toward the lunchroom. As
soon as he had gone Diana gave Scoggins a smileless glance. "Why
did you leave me with him?"</p>

<p>"Was it that clear?" complained Scoggins. "I thought I was
being sly about it." He dropped his head, long studying the
floor; he was at the moment a big and blond-headed boy caught in
his musings and so transparent in what he thought that he
furnished her with an answer before he spoke. He said: "I wanted
to know something."</p>

<p>"Did you find out?"</p>

<p>"I thought I did, but Ollie said I guessed wrong." He looked
at her with deep care, and anxiously added, "Maybe he's right.
Ollie's a pretty smart fellow."</p>

<p>He wanted her to answer that. She saw that he waited on edge;
to him it was a moment full of importance. But she didn't answer.
She took his arm and walked with him to the main room. As they
came to it she looked toward the door and saw Pierce and Rounds
leaving, and some of the old stormy expression came back to her.
She said: "Ben, it wasn't one of the gang that shot him last
night. I want you to tell him. Tell him I saw Sitgreaves in town
today. He'll know."</p>

<p>"I guess he already knows. He said he knew it wasn't one of
Ives's crowd."</p>

<p>As they swung into the dance she said one more thing in a
deeply troubled voice. "This is different. I wish I
knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>Scoggins put his question suddenly at her. "Diana, you still
like that fellow?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for him, Ben. His world is falling down. He just
reached up and pulled it down on himself."</p>



<p><br> Pierce and Rounds moved to the Senate's bar and waited
for the bottle and glasses to come. Pierce poured the glasses
brimful and lifted his own glass and made his salute:&mdash;"A
warm cabin and a full meal, Ollie."</p>

<p>"I'm warm," said Ollie, "and I always eat well."</p>

<p>Pierce downed his drink and stood with one arm thrown on the
bar, watching Rounds and remembering that Rounds was one of the
few friends left him. Archie Caples and Barney Morris were both
dead. Diana was a woman who watched him out of strange eyes.
Scoggins too had changed, in the way any man must change who
turns to a woman. Scoggins wanted Diana. Ollie was the only one
left who was as he had always been.</p>

<p>"Ollie," he said, "stay as you are. Don't change."</p>

<p>"What would I change for?" questioned Ollie. He grinned at
Pierce. "You are a damned odd fellow."</p>

<p>"Let's have another drink on that," said Pierce. "Everybody's
odd."</p>

<p>"Like the Quaker who said to his wife, 'Everybody's queer but
thee and me, Deborah, and sometimes I have my doubts of thee.'
The dingbat birds have got you, Jeff. I know. I see 'em flying
around once in a while."</p>

<p>"We'll drink 'em out of the place," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"I've tried it," said Rounds. "When you're drunk you don't
hear 'em yell quite so much but their damned eyes just get bigger
and bigger. What makes you think I'd change?"</p>

<p>"Everybody does."</p>

<p>Ollie considered his partner at long length. Pierce filled the
glasses again. The saloon grew warmer and noisier and miners
crowded to the bar: "You know, Jeff, the fellow who travels alone
always travels the fastest. But it's no good. Better to be sold
out by a friend than to have no friends, A preacher once left me
an idea I never forgot. Man, he said, had to have the touch of
other men all the way down the trail. Now look at this saloon.
We'd be more comfortable at home but we wouldn't like it. Got to
come here and listen to other men howl. If we propose to get
drunk we're wasting time."</p>

<p>"Never change, Ollie," repeated Pierce, and filled the glasses
again.</p>

<p>Jim Williams entered the Senate, looked around until he saw
Pierce and made a clean track through the crowd. "Bill Palmer,"
he said, "just drove into town with Nick Tibault lyin' on the
wagon bed. Nick's got a bullet right through the middle of his
head. Turner found him in the brush. Been there a few days."</p>

<p>"Nick?" said Pierce and put his glass down. "Young Nick?"</p>

<p>"Palmer went over to that shack Charley Hildebrand and Long
John Franck live in and asked them to help load Nick into the
wagon. They told him to go to hell. Palmer said Long John looked
mighty funny about it."</p>

<p>"Now," said Pierce, "somebody's got to write Anna." He turned
around, a half-sick expression on his face. "That's too much,
Jim. This damned miserable human race . . ." He shook his head.
"You're going down there to see Long John?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Pierce walked toward the door with Jim Williams. Near it he
stopped to look back at Ollie Rounds. "Coming?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jim Williams in a flat tone, "he's not coming."</p>

<p>Rounds shook his head.</p>

<p>Pierce shrugged his shoulders and left the saloon with
Williams, turning to Kasebeer's stables where Parris Pfouts and
Neil Howie and John Lott and eight or nine others were waiting.
The group left the stable at once. At the top of Daylight Grade
the bitter wind cried against them and all before them; along the
winding Gulch, cabin lights sparkled with a frosty brilliance.
Williams had taken the head, and now said: "We'll move right
along. Say nothing to anybody you pass on the road."</p>



<p><br> Rounds stood a full half-hour longer at the Senate bar,
steadily drinking; and then left the place and went into
Tanner's. He made his way to Will Temperton's table and bent over
to speak into the gambler's ear. "Lend me a hundred, Will."</p>

<p>Temperton lifted five gold coins from his stack and passed
them back to Rounds. He stared at Rounds a moment, then said,
"So-long," and returned his attention to the game.</p>

<p>It wasn't until Ollie reached the door that Temperton's remark
struck him as being odd and so he turned. Temperton was watching
him and Temperton made a short gesture that might have meant
"Good-by." That too was odd. Rounds, now feeling a small chill,
moved down Wallace to the Planter's and up to his room. He stood
in the room a considerable while, reviewing what he knew.
Scoggins had dropped a warning, and so had Temperton. These men
seemed both to be trying to tell him something, and now a posse
moved down the Gulch on the heels of Tibault's murder and from it
the long-whispered break might come. He thought of finding Ives
to tell him about it, but then remembered that Pierce was in the
posse, and when he came to think of Pierce he buttoned his coat
around him and left the room, taking nothing with him. He went
directly to the stable and got his horse and rode around before
the Virginia Hotel a moment to listen to the music. The door was
closed and the bitter cold had frosted the windowpanes. A smell
of coffee came out of the Virginia. He heard a woman laugh and he
heard the steady shuffle and stamp of feet, and this man who
loved to laugh and to be warm listened to that music with a
sudden forlorn remembrance of all the soft and kind voices of the
past, with a memory of all the other places from which in haste
or in shame he had fled. He wished to say good-by to Ben and to
Diana, but he knew there was nothing he might say to either of
them which would help. This was an old ending for him, a swift
and furtive departure. Jack Gallegher passed by, hailing him.
Ollie moved on without answering.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; TEMPERTON'S
PAST</h2>

<p class="first">THE posse skirted Daly's and came upon Wisconsin
Creek beyond two o'clock of a sub-zero night. Dismounting to
cross over the ice sheeting of the creek afoot, the party took a
wetting to the knees. George Baume began to swear and was
immediately stopped by Jim Williams. "Cut that out, George. No
racket."</p>

<p>"Got to yell or freeze to death."</p>

<p>"Freeze to death but don't yell," said Williams
laconically.</p>

<p>This was the other side of gentle Jim Williams, the iron-
tempered side. He turned up the Stinkingwater and as he rode he
talked quietly with Pierce. "I guess the time's coming for us
now. Everybody liked Nick."</p>

<p>At three-thirty he halted the party in a black world. "Cabin's
up there ahead. I'm going to scout around." He left his horse and
moved forward afoot, soon disappearing. The rest of the group
dismounted and stood miserably shifting in a wind that whipped
over the open land and turned their wet feet and clothes frost-
hard. George Baume softly groaned, "Anybody got a drink?" Burtchy
turned his horse over to Pierce and tramped a steady circle to
keep warm. It was a half-hour later, with some gray beginning to
dilute the sky, when Williams came back.</p>

<p>"We've stumbled on to something," he said. "There's eight or
nine men sleeping outside the cabin in the snow. That means
another four or five inside the cabin&mdash;it is too small to
hold more than that. So there's maybe fourteen men up there."</p>

<p>"Hell of a cold night to be camping out," said Burtchy. "They
wouldn't be there unless something is in the wind. Somebody
called a meeting. My guess is we'll find they're all Innocents
from the Gulch."</p>

<p>"Well, by God," groaned George Baume, "we'll find out what
brought 'em here. Let's get going. I am about to the end of my
rope."</p>

<p>But Williams waited for the light to increase. He stood by
Pierce, watching the outline of the cabin rise in vague shape
through the sullen, wind-ripped night. He was patient in the way
a man will be who has frozen his mind beyond change; and yet even
then he had his sad reflections.</p>

<p>"You would think," he murmured, "those fellows would be
content with the gold they could get out of the Gulch. Sometimes
I do not understand men. When I think I do understand them, I'm
ashamed."</p>

<p>"Let's go," insisted George Baume.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Williams. "We'll close in. You fellows
circle the crowd on the ground. Watch sharp. Pierce and I will go
to the cabin. Franck will be inside the cabin, since it belongs
to him. Henry, you stay back with the horses."</p>

<p>The group moved forward, their feet making some sound in the
brittle snow. The cabin was a growing shape ahead of them and as
Pierce stepped on with Williams he made out horses on picket near
by and the shapes of men sleeping tight-rolled in their blankets.
The posse spread out, circling the sleepers. Pierce followed
Williams to the cabin's door and stopped while Williams lifted
his gun, quietly opened the door, and called in.
"Franck&mdash;Long John Franck!"</p>

<p>The figures on the ground began to stir; and one man sat bolt
upright. Pierce turned his revolver on that man, softly saying:
"Sit still." The man's face turned to him, blurred by the heavy
shadows. Meanwhile there was some commotion inside the cabin and
when Williams again called Franck's name a voice growled sleepily
back:</p>

<p>"Whut the hell's up?"</p>

<p>"Come out here,"</p>

<p>"Wait'll I git my hat."</p>

<p>"Never mind your hat. Come out."</p>

<p>All the men lying on the earth now were rising and the posse
closed in and made a tight ring around them. "What the hell goes
on here?" asked somebody.</p>

<p>A figure showed at the cabin's doorway, ducked and came out.
The relentless wind drove an indistinct daylight over the barren
flats and Williams stepped forward, staring at the tall shape
before him until he recognized Long John. "You come with us," he
said, and afterwards called at the posse. "Pierce&mdash;Biedler,
walk with me. Rest of you hold these lads right where they
are."</p>

<p>He led Long John Franck a hundred feet from the cabin, Pierce
and X. Biedler following. Long John Franck, all this while, was
asking his steady question: "What's the matter&mdash;what you
here for, Jim?"</p>

<p>Williams finally paused and turned. "Bill Palmer asked you to
help him to get Nick Tibault in the wagon. You refused."</p>

<p>"Know nothin' about it," said Franck.</p>

<p>Pierce, meanwhile, saw a shape move up from the night and he
kept his eyes carefully on it while Williams talked. "Tibault lay
out here dead for a matter of days. You knew that yet you said
nothing about it. What were you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"I didn't kill him," said Franck in a rapid, rushing way. The
shape on which Pierce had pinned his glance now drifted into
fairly distinct view, and turned out to be a straying mule.
Pierce said: "Whose mule's that?"</p>

<p>Franck looked around, still involved in his fears. He said
indifferently, "Tibault's."</p>

<p>"So?" softly murmured Williams.</p>

<p>Franck suddenly realized what he had said, and knew he had
betrayed himself. His voice lifted to a half-cry. "I didn't have
anything to do with it!"</p>

<p>"What'd you keep still about it for?" pressed Williams.</p>

<p>"I was afraid," said Long John, and looked at Williams and at
Pierce in a close, black way. The gravity of his situation had
penetrated his slow mind and at last broke his taciturnity. "I
won't take the blame to save anybody's neck&mdash;not me. The
fellow that killed him is sleepin' back there on the ground.
George Ives did it. I saw it. Tibault had two hundred dollars. He
came down here to get a couple mules he had sold to Burtchy and
Clark; Ives got wind of the money. Ives shot him. Didn't
immediately kill him, but dragged him through the brush on a rope
till Tibault died."</p>

<p>"What's Ives doing here? What's the crowd here for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. They just drifted in last night."</p>

<p>Williams motioned for Franck to turn and move, and the four
stepped back to the cabin. It was now half-daylight and one of
the campers had gotten a fire started in the cabin, the smoke of
which fled with the wind in thin streaks. Ives was at the door,
closely watching Williams and Pierce. He was a careless, quick-
witted man, and showed no concern at all. Williams
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you doing around here? What's this crowd here
for?"</p>

<p>Ives smiled and shrugged his shoulders. "No particular
reason."</p>

<p>"Just like to sleep out in the snow on a windy night, I
suppose," suggested Burtchy with some sarcasm.</p>

<p>"That's as good an answer as any," replied Ives coolly.</p>

<p>"And while we're asking questions, what the hell are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"We want you, George," said Williams.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"For killing Tibault."</p>

<p>"A fine pipe-dream, Jim," said Ives, betraying no concern. "Go
ahead and try to prove it."</p>

<p>"Which we'll do," said X. Biedler. "The sooner the better.
Let's hold court right here, Jim."</p>

<p>But Williams, who had so nourished his burning sense of
retribution that he would have tracked Ives across a thousand
miles, still had an impartial mind. Whatever was to be done would
be properly done. "No," he said, "there will be no short shrift
in this. Ives and Franck will go back to Nevada City and they
will stand trial in the usual manner. It will never be said that
we hang a man for fun."</p>

<p>"Hang?" asked Ives, and let out a short, ringing laugh.
"You're away ahead of yourself, Jim." Then he turned his glance
on Pierce and the false laughter ceased and Pierce felt the full
and terrible force of the man's in-burning rage. "You won't be so
brave in another day or two," he promised Pierce.</p>



<p><br> That afternoon the group reached Nevada City with Ives,
Long John Franck, and with George Hildebrand who, suspected as an
accomplice, was picked up along the road.</p>

<p>The three were put under guard. Pierce afterwards continued on
to Virginia, to find that the story of the capture had preceded
him. It was then near suppertime and instead of going on to his
cabin he took a meal at the Virginia Hotel. Scoggins came in to
join him and presently Williams showed up for a moment. He said,
"The toughs have already got all the lawyers in the Gulch
retained to defend Ives. But Wilbur Sanders is still here. He had
planned to take the stage back to Bannack. He will prosecute for
us. Don Byam, at Nevada City, will be the judge. Tomorrow we'll
settle the question of a jury." He sat by, closely thinking it
out, and added, "I should not be surprised if the toughs try to
take control, as they did with Stinson and Lyons." He slapped his
palm on the table. "They shall not do it," he stated and looked
at Pierce. "The right time has come."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"No," insisted Williams, "it has come. We shall smash them
once and for all."</p>

<p>"Who," said Pierce in his indifferent voice, "will write to
Anna?"</p>

<p>"I know. Those things happen. But we'll smash them and drive
them out of this country forever. We start it properly by sending
George Ives to the rope."</p>

<p>"Jim," said Pierce, "why didn't you want Ollie along?"</p>

<p>Williams rose from his chair. "I have got to be going back to
Nevada. We're going to watch Ives. There will be no foolishness
this time." He tarried, he gave Pierce a straight glance. "I
didn't want him, Jeff," he said, and left the Virginia Hotel.</p>

<p>Pierce grumbled. "What's the matter with Williams?"</p>

<p>Scoggins sat loose sprawled at the table, using his thumb nail
to make idle tracks across it, writing in heavy letters, "Ollie."
Pierce watched this blond man's hand slowly inscribe that name
over and over again; and then he saw Ben betray his change of
thought, for Ben's thumbnail printed, "Diana," and stopped.
Suddenly he looked up and laid his hand over the name. He wasn't
smiling and he wasn't at ease any more.</p>

<p>"I'll walk up the Gulch with you," he offered.</p>

<p>"Think I'll stay here tonight."</p>

<p>"Good idea," approved Scoggins. "The four walls of a cabin get
damned tiresome when a man's alone." He changed the subject.
"Diana wanted me to tell you she saw Sitgreaves in town. Who's
he?"</p>

<p>"Retribution," said Pierce.</p>

<p>Scoggins shrugged his shoulders. He gave Pierce a smile that
showed none of the old spirit. These two had lost the one fine
thing which had brought and held them together.</p>

<p>They were, Pierce realized, just two men sitting on opposite
sides of the table, not the company for each other they had once
been. Scoggins got up, said, "See you later," and moved out of
the dining room.</p>

<p>Pierce signed for a room and went up to it, and stood at the
window to watch men move along Wallace Street, trafficking in and
out of the Senate, the California Exchange, the Pony, and other
saloons and shops. It was a little early yet for the hurdy-gurdys
to go into full swing. The Pantheon showed only a few lights.
Scoggins was then entering Diana's bakery. A little later he came
out with Diana and Lily Beth, the three bucking the wind toward
Diana's cabin. Lily Beth held Scoggins' hand, and dark as it was
Pierce saw Diana turn and laugh at Scoggins. Pierce swung away
from the window. He sat on the edge of the bed with his arms over
his knees, a black expression crawling across his face. He got up
and moved to the door. The single chair of the room was in his
road; he lifted it and threw it aside and went out.</p>

<p>He crossed to the Senate, now in search of Ollie Rounds.</p>

<p>The Senate, unlike Tanner's, had some pretensions of elegance
and drew the genteel trade. Parris Pfouts stood at the bar with a
group of Virginia City's merchants, and Parris at once drew
Pierce into the circle. "The toughs will want an open
jury&mdash;the whole Gulch doing the voting on Ives. That will
give them a chance to swing sentiment, as they did with Stinson
and Lyons. We must stick to a small jury."</p>

<p>Henry Touche, who ran a supply store, expressed doubt of
Ives's guilt. "Ives always impressed me as a decent fellow. I
think you fellows have got the wrong man."</p>

<p>Pfouts said: "You'll see some names brought into this you
never dreamed of."</p>

<p>George Burtchy said: "One thing's certain. We must convict
Ives, else every man who has any part with the right side of this
trial will be shot down. Convict or die&mdash;that is the literal
truth. Otherwise you'll see a reign of terror that will knock
your eyes out."</p>

<p>W. B. Dance murmured, "Will the miners stand tight this
time?"</p>

<p>X. Biedler now put in his thought. "I dug two graves to take
care of Stinson and Lyons. I had my labor for nothing. This
time," and he patted the shotgun he always carried, "there will
be no tears to wash justice down, the creek."</p>

<p>"It depends on the miners," repeated Dance.</p>

<p>Pierce saw nothing of Ollie Rounds. He tried the California
Exchange, and he tried the Pony. At both places the talk of
Ives's capture displaced all other talk. The general anger had
grown a good deal stronger against the toughs, and men were
bolder than they had been in denouncing mass lawlessness; and yet
there were other men equally bold in defending Ives. Leaving the
Pony he noted that Jack Gallegher came from Tanner's with
Marshland and Bob Zachary, and with them also was George Brown,
who ordinarily tended bar at Dempsey's, eighteen miles down the
Gulch. Brown was a long way from home. Pierce stepped back into
the dark wall and watched these men move toward Henly's stable on
Jackson, and go into it. A little later Tanner left his saloon,
following; and a few moments afterwards Clubfoot George Lane
appeared from the lower quarter of town and went into the stable.
These men were closeted in Henly's for a good quarter-hour; then
Clubfoot rode from the stable and galloped toward Daylight,
disappearing.</p>

<p>Pierce entered Tanner's and stopped at Will Temperton's table.
"Seen Ollie?"</p>

<p>"No," said Temperton. "And you shouldn't be coming here,
Jeff."</p>

<p>Gallegher, Pierce discovered, now was at the doorway watching
him. Gallegher immediately moved aside, placing his back to the
wall. Tanner came in and moved to the other side of the doorway.
Tanner said angrily: "I don't want you in my place."</p>

<p>It was Gallegher Pierce watched. This Deputy was a sly man, a
man who had dissembled and smiled and carried his tricky
intentions close to his heart. But Pierce had handled him before
and knew the limits of Gallegher's courage. He said now: "Move
over, Jack. Move over toward Tanner."</p>

<p>"What are you worried about?" asked Gallegher.</p>

<p>"A bullet in the back."</p>

<p>"Pierce," cried out Gallegher, "I never was afraid of
you!"</p>

<p>"Move over," said Pierce. He stepped on, straight at
Gallegher. Long ago he had learned that this was the kind of
pressure Gallegher could not stand; the man's nerve had its
breaking point, and as he closed in he saw the desire in
Gallegher's eyes grow cold. Gallegher's face screwed up and his
lips pulled back from his teeth and closed again as he stepped
over against Tanner. Pierce laughed at him and went through the
doorway. He wheeled against the wall and waited but Gallegher
didn't follow, and afterward Pierce circled town and returned to
his room in the Virginia Hotel and went to bed.</p>

<p>By mid-morning the upper part of the Gulch was half-emptied,
the miners moving down to Nevada City for the trial. Pierce spent
the day on his claim, returning to Virginia for supper in the
hotel. The tide had turned back from Nevada and Jim Williams came
in for his meal to give out the day's proceedings as he ate. "We
had a hell of a wrangle over the jury but we got it the way we
wanted. We found another lawyer to help Sanders, a fellow by the
name of Bagg, Sanders started his case this morning. He'll nail
Ives to the cross." Then he added, "Unless the toughs stampede
the crowd. They're drifting through the Gulch, talking about fair
play. They're using a lot of threats on the jury."</p>

<p>"Maybe the crowd will stand fast, Maybe it won't."</p>

<p>Williams finished his meal. "We have got to make it stick this
time, Jeff. Crowd or no crowd." He gave Pierce a searching look.
"Forty or fifty toughs have been running this Gulch. Forty or
fifty men on the other side of the fence can do likewise. How do
you feel about that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pierce. "You can do it. And I'm in on it."</p>

<p>Williams said: "You've changed. Was a time when you played it
strictly alone."</p>

<p>"Still do," said Pierce. "The crowd can do its crying&mdash;I
don't care. But I have been thinking of Barney and Archie Caples
a lot and I've been thinking of Nick Tibault."</p>

<p>Williams rose. "Come with me," he said, and left the hotel.
The two walked down Wallace. Parris Pfouts came along, not saying
anything, and fell in step. The three turned into Kinna and Nye's
store and moved on to a back room. Sanders was there with Biedler
and Lott and John Nye, and Alvin Brockie and Nick Wall. Nye got
up and shut the door behind the new entrants. Jim Williams
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We've talked this over today. We're going to organize. It is
the only way we can fight the toughs. San Francisco was cleaned
out by a few Vigilantes who didn't give a damn for the
consequences. That is the way it has got to be with us."</p>

<p>Parris Pfouts said, "Wait," and looked at Pierce. "If you do
not agree to the idea it would be better if you left now. This
has to be quickly done, and without anything being let out."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pierce, "it's all right."</p>

<p>Sanders said: "The trial will take all of tomorrow and part of
the next day. The danger point is when the jury turns in the
verdict. If they convict Ives the toughs will make a play. We
must be prepared for that."</p>

<p>Pfouts said: "Some of the boys at Nevada City are holding such
a meeting as this. We must get together as soon as possible and
complete the organization. Each of you gentlemen consider an
honest and thoroughly dependable man. Bring him to the next
meeting."</p>

<p>The group broke up, Williams and Pfouts and Pierce walking
together as far as the Senate. Here Williams stopped. "I have got
to see Neil Howie. We must throw a ring of guns around Ives to
see he's not taken and set free by the toughs."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Pierce, "the jury will set him free for
you."</p>

<p>"No, by God," said Williams. "It is in the book. He's guilty
and they'll send him to the rope. I want you down there. Day
after tomorrow."</p>

<p>Pierce moved away, bound up the Gulch. He paused in front of
Scoggins' store, oppressed by a loneliness which grew like a
disease. But there was no longer the old tie between himself and
Scoggins; that easy friendship had gone and so he turned on his
heels and moved into Wallace again and stood in front of the
Senate, growing slowly irritated at his own indecision, and then
went along Wallace Street, passing Diana's bakeshop. The smell of
bread came strongly out and light sparkled on the window's frost.
Afterwards he walked home against the rough wind.</p>



<p><br> Peabody and Caldwell's coach came in from Bannack the
following night at supper time and deposited its passengers
before the Virginia Hotel&mdash;a miner, two women destined for
The Pantheon, a Bannack merchant and a fashionably dressed lady
with a round face and a grave mouth and a pair of blue, half-sad
eyes. A roustabout came from the hotel to take her luggage and
showed her into the lobby. She signed the register and stood by,
watching the clerk as he reversed the book and looked at the
name; and said:</p>

<p>"Where would I find Mr. Temperton?"</p>

<p>"In Tanner's, I'd guess."</p>

<p>"That would be a saloon, and I presume Mr. Temperton is
dealing a table there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Should I send a runner for him?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Where is his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Expect you'd find her in Diana Castle's bakery. That's on
Wallace&mdash;straight ahead, middle of the block, left-hand
side."</p>

<p>She was, thought the clerk, a handsome woman on the cool and
deliberate side, with considerable grit in her. She said to the
handy man, "Take the luggage to my room, if you please," and
moved from the hotel.</p>

<p>She crossed the frozen mud, reached the walk and moved down
Wallace. Wind shouted around the building corners and slammed
against her and bits of hard dirt lifted and stung her face. She
walked steadily, undisturbed by all this, fixed and resolute, and
paused at the bakery's door, drawing a deep breath as she touched
the knob. At that moment her resolution seemed to waver but she
gathered herself, opened the door and stepped in to face
Diana.</p>

<p>"You're Diana Castle?" she said in a voice soft and immensely
determined.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Diana.</p>

<p>The woman held her gloved hands before her, the tips touching.
Wind had brought color to her cheeks but it had not loosened the
frozen gravity. Her eyes were dark blue, like the cold blue of
high-mountain lake-water. She held her lips together, placing
upon Diana the steadfast and rather cruel glance of a woman
reading another woman's character, and said: "I'm Lily Beth's
mother."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE TRIAL</h2>

<p class="first">"I GUESSED that," replied Diana calmly. "Lily
Beth looks much like you."</p>

<p>"Where is she now?"</p>

<p>"In my cabin. In bed, reading. She likes to read."</p>

<p>"Is the cabin warm?" asked Mrs. Temperton. "You leave her
alone with a lamp on the table that might upset? With all these
men, drunk and greedy, roaming the town?"</p>

<p>"You don't know a great deal about the men in a camp, do you?"
said Diana gently.</p>

<p>"My knowledge of men," said Mrs. Temperton, "comes largely
from one man." She was, in her smooth and soft way, incredibly
hard. All her warmth and sympathy, all her feelings seemed
frozen, or emptied out of her, or destroyed. Clearly, she hated
Temperton. But there was no heat in the hatred; it was a passion
turned bloodless by long torment.</p>

<p>"Shall I get Lily Beth for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Temperton. "When does the next stage leave
Virginia?"</p>

<p>"In the morning."</p>

<p>"I wish it were sooner," said Mrs. Temperton. Then she shook
her head. "No, not yet. Would you have somebody call Mr.
Temperton here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Diana, and turned to the back room. But again Mrs.
Temperton changed her mind. "Not for a moment, please. How is it
she is in your care? Are you...?"</p>

<p>"No," said Diana. "I have my own cabin. Mr. Temperton lives at
the Virginia. He asked me if I would take care of her. I have
done so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Temperton grew visibly harder at the thought, murmuring:
"How many strange hands she has passed through."</p>

<p>She gave Diana that same prolonged inspection again and her
voice grew faintly hurried. "Are you in love with him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Diana.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temperton searched Diana's face, weighing the answer and
at last seeming to accept it. She dropped her eyes. "Tell me,
truthfully, has he made her forget me?"</p>

<p>"No," said Diana. "Was that what he wished to do?"</p>

<p>"He took her away to break my heart."</p>

<p>"Then," said Diana, "he has broken his own. He has really
tried to have Lily Beth love him. But she does not."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Mrs. Temperton, "he may suffer for it every day
of his life." She tried to put live anger into her talk, she
tried to put into those words the venom and fresh heat of her
loss, her long torture, her blind search. But she could not. The
words remained cold and therefore more terrible than fresh anger
could ever make them.</p>

<p>"He will," said Diana. "You, see, Mrs. Temperton, he loves her
as much as he loves his life. But he has failed, and he knows it.
You could do nothing more to hurt him."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Temperton, "I can do one thing more. I can
face him and tell him he has lost. That will hurt worse than you
think. Please call him."</p>

<p>Diana moved to the inside room and spoke to her baker, and
returned. She put on her coat. "I'll bring Lily Beth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Temperton's face showed its first uncertainty. "Don't say
I'm here," she said. "Just bring her. Let her see me first."</p>

<p>"Why should you be worried?"</p>

<p>"It has been a year," said Mrs. Temperton. "A year is one
tenth of her life."</p>

<p>After Diana had gone, Mrs. Temperton remained still.</p>

<p>She let her hands drop beside her coat and then she brought
them together again, fingers tightly interlaced. Men tramped
along the walk, each nearing footstep bringing a swift, haunted
expression to her eyes, each departing footstep taking the
expression away. Long before Temperton opened the door she knew
he was approaching, recognizing the tempo of his pacing from the
past years of life with him; there was never a doubt about those
steady, even steps and as they came closer and momentarily
stepped at the door Mrs. Temperton sighed and lifted her
shoulders and erased all vestige of expression from her face, and
then he had opened the door and had stepped through.</p>

<p>She knew he would show no surprise. It was a matter of
professional pride with him to hold hurt or misfortune or triumph
or ordinary human emotion behind a fixed calm. His lips made a
slight change, growing narrower, and he seemed to settle within
himself. He closed the door, pushing a hand back against it
without taking his eyes from her And then, because there was one
gentle-born streak in him, he removed his hat before her. In all
the years of their marriage, she remembered, he had never failed
to do that. That courtesy had remained even after love had
gone.</p>

<p>"I knew," he said at last, "you would of course find me in
time. You were always a steadfast woman."</p>

<p>"It was Lily Beth," she said.</p>

<p>"Even beyond Lily Beth. Had you determined to hunt me down for
any other reason you would have done so, and continued until you
found me. It is your character, Judith. You have a very fixed
will."</p>

<p>"For which you have always hated me," she said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he answered, "a weak man envies those who possess
the strength he does not have. Now you are happy. You have found
Lily Beth."</p>

<p>"Happy?" she said. "Every meaning of that word was squeezed
out of me long age. But I am content."</p>

<p>"You should be," he said, so inflexibly polite. "You have won.
Lily Beth is your daughter. There is no power on earth which
could ever draw her to me."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "there is. But you do not have it."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "we have talked about that many times before,
haven't we? Affection and laughter and softness. I know. But men
must be what they are and if grace is not in them they can expect
no grace from others."</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;" she said, "was it simply to hurt me that you
took her away? Or do you love her so much you could not share her
with me? I have long wondered."</p>

<p>"If a man is not permitted to love his wife," he said, "then
he must put his love somewhere."</p>

<p>"That," she said, and shewed her first warmth, "is a lie you
told yourself long age. You loved pretty rooms and pretty
furniture and a pretty wife, all to shed warmth on you, but you
never cared to shed warmth back."</p>

<p>He made a weary gesture with his arm. "We resume the same old
argument. I took you from your people, for which they have hated
you and me since. I led you through shabby ways and I would not
change, and I ceased to be the gallant adventurer you thought me
to be and became a card sharp, nothing more."</p>

<p>"All of that."</p>

<p>"Yes, all of that. Your judgment is quite correct. You find me
a year later dealing in a saloon two cuts lower than a year
before. There is no regeneration, as you once thought there might
be. We are two different people and God was unkind when he
permitted me to touch you."</p>

<p>"Long ago," she said, "you found irony was the easiest way to
hurt me."</p>

<p>"Irony," he said, "is a knife used only by scoundrels. I am a
scoundrel. How different it might have been if I had used the
proper words, the words you seemed to want, but which I never
had."</p>

<p>"You didn't need words," she said. "Had you only put your hand
out to me I would have seen and felt all that you could not say.
That is, if these things had been truly in you, They never
were."</p>

<p>He used a gesture that was completely like him; he raised his
hands and shoulders, expressing everything and nothing.</p>

<p>She said: "I'm leaving on tomorrow's stage with Lily Beth.
Will you try to stop me?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, and permitted his first bitterness to show in
his tightening words. "The hand is played. I have lost."</p>

<p>She said in her distant, bell-clear voice: "You always lost
easily and shrugged the loss away. You never tried very hard to
win back."</p>

<p>"I never argue with chance."</p>

<p>"Love is not chance," she said.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "I'm only what I am."</p>

<p>She started to answer him and ceased. An expression of real
fright crossed her face and she started to turn away, and checked
herself, and slowly brought her hands up before her.</p>

<p>The door came open and Diana said, "Go in, Lily Beth." Lily
Beth came into the bakeshop, her face red and her eyes sparkling
above the heavy bundling of her coat and muffier.</p>

<p>She saw her mother and her mouth opened and she cried:
"Mother," in a thin, rapid voice and ran forward with her hands
outreached. Mrs. Temperton fell to her knees and took her
daughter to her. There was no kiss. Mrs. Temperton put her face
against Lily Beth's coat, her face white in the lamplight. Lily
Beth's hands crept around Mrs. Temperton's neck and she said in a
precise, clear tone: "I have waited a very long time for you to
come."</p>

<p>Diana walked on until she was in the rear room, away from this
scene. Temperton looked down at his wife, his face stiffened into
sharpest lines. He saw the warmth that filled and changed his
wife's face, he saw Lily Beth's hands tightly caught around her
mother's neck; whereupon he turned to the door. "I wish you
luck," he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temperton stood up. "You see the answer for yourself,
Will."</p>

<p>"I saw it long before this," he said.</p>

<p>"Lily Beth," said Mrs. Temperton, "we are leaving
tomorrow."</p>

<p>Lily Beth looked at her father. "Are we all going
together?"</p>

<p>"No," said Temperton, "I am staying here."</p>

<p>A shadow crossed Lily Beth's face and, caught in the undertone
of the terrible and unsaid things passing between these two
people, she made the kind of answer which cut through a thousand
words of explanation. She turned and reached for her mother's
hand.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Temperton.</p>

<p>"Won't you be at the stage in the morning?" said Lily
Beth.</p>

<p>Temperton, who had his enormous pride of making his decisions
clear and final, stepped out of character before his daughter.
"Yes, I think so," he answered, and went into the street.</p>

<p>Diana entered the front room. "Lily Beth, take your mother to
our cabin. She'll pack your things."</p>

<p>"You'll be at the stage, too, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Diana.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temperton moved to the door and there paused. "We should
hurry, Lily Beth, or we'll miss supper at the hotel." But, as she
went through the door, she looked back at Diana a long moment,
and said: "I know."</p>

<p>Diana remained alone in the room, openly crying.</p>

<p>Temperton stood at the window of his room next morning and
watched the stage in front of the hotel. His wife and Lily Beth
stood by the coach with Diana, and presently Scoggins appeared
and handed Mrs. Temperton a package. The package contained a
small gold locket and chain in which Lily Beth's daguerreotype
rested. This had been his wife's present to Temperton on Lily
Beth's second birthday, and his one treasure. But he had wrapped
it and had given it to Scoggins, with instructions, and now
Scoggins handed it over. Temperton saw his wife open the package
and afterwards lift her head and look along the street, as if in
search of him. Diana bent to kiss Lily Beth and a group of
merchants, all old friends of Lily Beth's arrived to pay their
compliments. Pierce came forward and now Temperton saw this big
man's face break into one of its rare smiles as he said good-by
to the girl. Afterwards Lily Beth and his wife got in to the
coach and the door closed, and the coach moved on and turned the
corner of Wallace Street.</p>

<p>Everything that had been his life, important and gentle and
possessing hope, moved around the corner with the coach. He
remained by the window and in a little while caught one more view
of the coach as it reached the summit of Daylight, paused against
winter's sunlight and thereafter vanished.</p>

<p>He moved back from the window, a grave and thoughtful man; he
removed his coat and shirt and shaved, taking considerable care
with the chore. He replaced his shirt and coat and brushed his
hair and he lighted a cigar and sat down before the room's table
with a pack of cards and dealt out a game of solitaire: The game,
presently, went bad. He let the cards lay and put both arms on
the table and went back over his career and thought of Lily Beth
and then of his wife, and remembered, in a slow and searching
way, every incident between them through the years.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock the clerk in the hotel heard a small report
and judged it to be a board somewhere falling. A little
afterwards the chamber girl came down and called the clerk. Going
upstairs he found Will Temperton still seated in the chair, with
his arms and head on the table.</p>

<p>The unbeatable solitaire game remained as he had played it and
had left it; and he lay dead with a bullet hole through his
heart.</p>

<p>The clerk made an observation about that. "Man usually shoots
himself in the region he considers most important. He was a cool
one but I never knew he considered himself to have a heart."</p>

<p>Pierce walked down the Gulch to Nevada City a little beyond
noon and found five hundred or more men standing in a street
churned to deep greasy mud. Don Byam sat as judge on a wagon
drawn up in front of Lott Brothers' store; and as the lawyers for
defense or prosecution rose to speak they mounted to the wagon to
command the crowd. A space had been roped off in front of the
wagons for prisoners' dock, jury box and witness stand. Bob
Hereford and Adriel Davis, sheriffs of Nevada and Junction
respectively, acted together as bailiffs.</p>

<p>Going through the crowd Pierce met many men he knew and
exchanged words with them; and other men he did not know called
his name, they remembering him for his part in the stage holdup
as well as for his carrying Barney Morris' gold to Bannack, and
for his fight with Gallegher. News like this traveled swiftly in
the Gulch and marked a man overnight. It warmed him, it thawed
the increasingly lonesome spot in him. At the roped circle he
found X. Biedler and Jim Williams standing together. Williams
leaned over to whisper to him.</p>

<p>"We've got twenty men standing by this rope. If there's a rush
to set Ives free they'll turn and make a stand against the crowd.
That's your job, too."</p>

<p>The trial was about over, with Sanders, a slight and polished
man in these robustly rough surroundings, now on the wagon making
his final argument. He had a strong voice and he controlled it
effectively as he spoke of the murdered Tibault, of the young
man's likeable ways, of his honesty and his simplicity, of the
way he saved his money and stayed away from the honky-tonks in
order to go back to the girl he planned to marry&mdash;to Anna.
It was a telling point, for many men in the Gulch had heard
Tibault speak of Anna.</p>

<p>Then Sanders, warming to his task, summoned anger to his side
and called the roll of the dead&mdash;Hilton murdered in cold
blood during the stage holdup, Barney Morris shot down on the
Bannack-Horse Prairie road, Archie Caples assassinated in his
cabin. There were many other men now sleeping in the Gulch
cemeteries who had come to the same kind of end and he named them
with a monotone relentlessness which left a visible effect with
the crowd. Pierce saw men shift under the strain, he saw them
grow restless. Perhaps, went on Sanders, it was not Ives who had
held the gun on all these. He was not debating that proposition.
But Ives was a brainy, conscienceless killer. Ives was a leader
of organized banditry in this Gulch. Ives was a star example of a
system of brutal rapine and pillage which, unless stopped now and
forever, would carry the Gulch to ruin. Human beasts prowled by
day and by night and times grew worse and there was no safety for
any honest man with a grain of gold in his poke, and there would
never be any safety until all honest men rose and smashed this
villainy to the ground. It was time for law to come.</p>

<p>"There is," he said to the jury and to the crowd, "no shred of
defense for George Ives. We have torn down the deliberate lies of
his witnesses. We have seen them contradict each other. We have
had Long John Franck's stated testimony that Ives, knowing
Tibault had $200 in his pocket, went out and met Tibault in the
brush, Tibault being unarmed, and called to Tibault to turn
around and then put a bullet in Tibault's head. He was not
instantly killed. As further torture Ives roped him and dragged
him through the brush, God only knowing what beast savagery
prompting Ives to do this, and left him at last a victim. There
are no words in our language to describe the full infamy, the
degraded and unspeakably vile character of a man who piles that
kind of torture upon that kind of a crime. You should find him
guilty, and he should be hung."</p>

<p>He was through, to be replaced by the defense lawyer.</p>

<p>This man had defended Stinson and Lyons previously and by his
subsequent associations had lost the confidence of the Gulch's
thoughtful ones. He seemed to be laboring under deep emotion, or
under the spell of whisky, so that his words were labored and
thick-spoken and deeply sentimental. It was too bad that Tibault
was dead. Tibault was a fine lad. Nobody loved Tibault more than
he. But Tibault was dead and nothing could bring him back to
life. And who could be sure George Ives had done it? All the
evidence was flimsy. The testimony of Long John Franck could
scarcely be believed. Franck was supposed to be a friend of Ives.
What kind of man would squeal on a friend? George Ives was
reckless, but he was not a bad one. He had done many good things
and if he lived he would do many more good things. George Ives
deserved a chance to prove it. "Gentlemen," said the defense
lawyer, "don't let passion sway you. Be fair, be just, be gentle.
Remember the injunction of the Good Book, which is to judge not
that ye be not judged."</p>

<p>He came down from the wagon, sweating and unsteady.</p>

<p>Here and there in the crowd a single voice called: "Never mind
that cryin'!"</p>

<p>"Give Ives another chance!"</p>

<p>Judge Byam said only a few words to the jury. "You will retire
to Lott Brothers' store, arrive at your verdict and return."</p>

<p>Suppertime had come and daylight was gone from the Gulch, with
a moon rising above the Bitterroots wan-white in the dustless
winter air. Men broke away from the crowd to cook supper and
campfires sprang up along the creek. Ives sat on a keg inside the
roped circle, as calm as any man in the group. His supporters
came near him and he laughed and carried on his low, cheerful
conversation. Byam remained on the wagon and Sanders walked
slowly back and forth, his head dropped in thought. Williams and
X. Biedler watched the crowd with a vigilant attention.</p>

<p>"Where's Franck and Hildebrand?" asked Pierce.</p>

<p>"In that cabin," said Williams, "under guard. They'll be tried
separately. Probably they'll be let off. Not much real stuff
against them."</p>

<p>The jury, out less than a half-hour, came from Lotts' store
and re-entered the circle. With their appearance men ran from
their cook fires and a murmur, running like a low long swell of
water, moved through all this waiting mass; and the pressure of
the crowd pushed Pierce into the rope which marked off the center
area. George Ives lifted his head to stare at the jury with a
drawn brightness.</p>

<p>Don Byam said: "Reached it, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>The jury foreman knew his answer meant something and he took
his time making it. Every set of eyes in the Gulch was on him and
the silence grew heavier and heavier until it seemed to flow like
a soft-thick substance. This was the moment. Ives knew it, and
all his kind. Looking over the heads of the nearest men, Pierce
discovered Jack Gallegher. Gallegher's head was pushed forward a
little and on his face was a solemn, rapt expression, Sanders had
come to a stand in the middle of the roped-off place and here he
waited without showing anything of his feelings. Yet Pierce
understood what was in the slight, indomitable man's mind. If the
jury set George Ives free, then Sanders and all these others with
him would go down in a flood of vengeance. It was George Ives's
life against Sanders' life. It was the toughs against the little,
resolute group. Everything locked into the answer. The foreman
stepped forward and handed a slip up to Byam. "We signed this
verdict all except one man. Guilty."</p>

<p>Sound started small, and rustled and murmured and swelled back
through the crowd; and then men were crying out their private
beliefs. Sanders wheeled swiftly and went up to the wagon. He
lifted his hand, his voice resonant:</p>

<p>"The trial has been fair, the judgment duly returned. I now
move that the verdict of the jury be approved by the miners here
assembled!"</p>

<p>"Second!" yelled X. Biedler.</p>

<p>Byam's voice came in at once. "All in favor...!"</p>

<p>A roar erupted through the pale dark. Sanders listened to its
sustained reverberation until he was sure of its meaning, then
waved his arm for silence. "I further move that George Ives be
hanged!"</p>

<p>A dozen men called, "Second!" Byam started to put the motion
but his voice was drowned by the tumultuous shouting all arond
him. He nodded his bead and he waited until the sound fell away.
"I direct Adriel Davis and Bob Hereford to make the arrangements.
Court will stay in session until they report back."</p>

<p>Davis and Hereford shoved themselves out through the edges of
the crowd and disappeared The steady, hollow tone of talk kept
on, but here and there single voices began to cry. "What's the
hurry? Give a man decent time...!"</p>

<p>"Bring up Long John Franck! Hang him too! He peached!"</p>

<p>"Let's hear from that jury! Let each one of 'em get up and
vote out loud!"</p>

<p>These voices came from different parts of the crowd. The
toughs had placed themselves this way, to bring fear to the men
around them, to raise doubt, to harry and to change.</p>

<p>Pierce turned to the crowd and Biedler and Williams were both
alert. Pfouts and some of the rest of the trustworthies had moved
in to the rope. This was the second tight moment, as they all
realized. The crowd had made its decision, but it was a formless
mass to be swayed either by terror or pity; and now the voices of
the toughs grew greater and more arrogant and men hurled
themselves through the tight-packed ranks, colliding and cursing.
Biedler nursed his shotgun and spoke at Pierce and Williams.
"Watch for the tears! This time, by God, we will not be
cheated."</p>

<p>Ives, who had sat like stone through the verdict and through
the subsequent confusion, now mounted the wagon to face Sanders.
The miners, arrested by this byplay, quit talking. Biedler
suddenly moved out of the open area and disappeared behind a
small log house near by.</p>

<p>"Colonel Sanders," said Ives, formal and polite, "I should
like to ask a favor, one gentleman to another. This is pretty
rough on me. I will not ask for sympathy but I've got a mother
and some sisters back East and I'd like time to write them. I
give you my word of honor to make no attempt to escape if you'll
put this business off until tomorrow." Sanders showed feeling. He
dropped his head, deeply thinking. There was scarcely a sound in
the packed audience, for this was a strange and dangerous and
dramatic moment and the crowd, sensing it, let him have his
silence. He lifted his head to look at Ives. Against Ives he was
a slighter and less colorful man, educated and civilized and
therefore at a handicap before the wild, half-sinister yet
intensely attractive Ives. "I am not insensible to your position,
Ives," he said. "I&mdash;".</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice said, "Wait," and all eyes turned to find X.
Biedler mounted on the roof of the nearby cabin. X. Biedler stood
up on the roof peak, short and heavy in the shadows, the shotgun
cradled. "Sanders," he spoke in a voice that boomed up and down
the Gulch, "ask Ives how much time he gave Tibault."</p>

<p>He had said the one right thing. That taunt, that practical
and vengeful reminder, broke the tension. Somebody called:</p>

<p>"Damned right!"</p>

<p>Sanders was obviously telieved. "Get down and write your
letter," he said. "You'll have time enough before the rope is
rigged."</p>

<p>He stepped from the wagon. The defense attorney came at him,
swearing. "It is a damned outrage to cut short a man's most
sacred moments&mdash;"</p>

<p>Davis and Hereford pushed through the crowd and Hereford
called at Byam: "Can't find a suitable place."</p>

<p>One of the miners near by called: "There's a place good
enough," and pointed to a log house under construction hard by
the wagons. The walls were up but the roof not yet constructed.
The miner pulled himself to the top of the wall, unseated a log
and threw one end of it down inside the house. Other men now
assisting, the log's high end was placed over the rim of the
house wall, making an out-thrown arm on the street. Somebody,
long prepared for the hanging, brought up a rope and tossed it
over the extended log. This same man laid nine turns around the
standing end and formed the hangman's knot.</p>

<p>"There's your rope!"</p>

<p>Judge Byam made a motion to Davis and Hereford. These two took
Ives by the arms, moving him forward to the rope. It was X.
Biedler, with the unflagging memory of the earlier trial, who
found a box for Ives to stand on. Adriel Davis tied Ives's hands
behind while Hereford slipped the noose around Ives's neck. Both
men helped him up to the box. Hereford suddenly turned to speak
to Byam. "Who's going to knock the box from under him?" This
particular duty, for some reason of his own, displeased him.</p>

<p>The crowd now found voice again. The toughs, Pierce noticed,
were making their last and desperate effort. He watched Gallegher
push through the miners with his gun raised. Gallegher had lost
his hat and he was cursing and shoving his elbows into men. All
through the crowd other toughs kept shouting:</p>

<p>"You can't railroad a man like that! Let him go!"</p>

<p>"The man that kills Ives will never live out the night!"</p>

<p>"Let him write to his mother!"</p>

<p>"Shoot the fellow that touches the box! Pull down that rope
somebody!"</p>

<p>Hereford was still undecided about the box and Byam had not
spoken. There was this delay, with the cries of the toughs
growing louder and louder. Ives stood on the small top of the
box, holding himself rigid for fear of falling. Davis had taken
the slack from the rope and had tied its free end to the cabin,
its pressure holding Ives straight. He was marble pale and his
eyes stared out before him, wild and full open. He seemed to
search the crowd for help, glancing from man to man; and in a
moment he saw Pierce directly below him and the wildness turned
to pure hate. "I wish to God," he ground out, "I'd settled with
you!" Then he lifted his voice so that everybody might hear him.
"I am Innocent!"</p>

<p>Jim Williams, hard by Pierce, muttered: "That's the road-agent
password!"</p>

<p>The toughs were in full yell; and, gaining courage, they were
pushing forward. Pierce swung on them, and Williams. This was the
last moment of danger, this was the final gamble.</p>

<p>It was Sanders, watching from the background who, having
sensed the turning of the tide before, now sensed it again, He
said in his clear, cold voice. "Men&mdash;do your duty!"</p>

<p>There was a stir in the front ranks and at once all the men
stationed around the rope's circle wheeled against the crowd and
flung up their guns. This blue steel gleamed in the deepening
night and iron clicked on iron, and these muzzles made a barrier
against the crowd. Suddenly a pair of men rushed forward and
knocked the box from under George Ives's teetering feet. Pierce,
his back turned to the outlaw, heard that strange whining thump
of the sudden-strained rope, and he heard Ives's gasp. Every
sound stopped in the crowd and every body ceased to move. Then
Hereford said: "He's dead." Far back in the crowd a woman set up
a piercing blood-chilling scream.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; VIGILANTES</h2>

<p class="first">THE Gulch awoke Christmas Day to find two feet
of snow on the ground. The creek was frozen hard enough to
support a wagon; the shop windows had half an inch of rippled ice
adhering to the panes. Smoke rose straight from chimney tops
through a windless air and in this wintry atmosphere all sounds
carried far. Sunlight came down through a crystal-wool fog,
bringing no heat.</p>

<p>These people were, for the most part, two thousand miles or
better from family firesides. Yet this was Christmas Day with its
old memories and its old, strong and undying customs, so that the
shops put up pine greens at their doors and the Virginia Hotel
advertised, by word of mouth, a steak and oyster dinner with
sweet potatoes, canned tomatoes, brandy pudding and "French bon-
bons especially freighted in for this occasion," at ten dollars
the plate. Beginning at noon the Virginia's dining room did a
land-office business.</p>

<p>Men moved from cabin to cabin exchanging the ancient phrase,
"Merry Christmas," and miners snow-bound in the upper reaches of
the Gulch tracked into town on snowshoes to break a cabin-
confined monotony. On this morning a town loafer was found frozen
in the hay pile of Nolan's stable, whereupon Nolan, who knew
something of the man's past, walked down Wallace to take up a
collection for the man's wife in the East and raised five hundred
dollars before he got farther than the Senate. This day old
grudges were absolved and old debts paid over eggnogs and Tom and
Jerries at one saloon or another; and as early dusk came to the
Gulch and lights gleamed through doorway apertures and windows
and tent walls, four heavy-cloaked miners moved from saloon to
saloon with the fiddlers and guitar players from The Pantheon,
singing carols. This was the day of sentiment and regret and
tears, and strong recollections bearing everybody in the Gulch
back through time.</p>

<p>Pierce came into town after dark and stopped at Scoggins'.
Finding Ben gone, Pierce made a search of the saloons for Ollie.
When he reached Tanner's he noticed that the chairs at
Temperton's poker table had been reversed; and a pine bough lay
on the table. Tomorrow another dealer would sit in Temperton's
chair and the table would again be in use, but on this Christmas
day Will Temperton had his tribute. Pierce found no trace of
Ollie. Going along Wallace, he felt as much alone as he ever had;
he had no part in any of this holiday.</p>

<p>He moved on to the Virginia Hotel and ate his meal. A little
later Scoggins came in with Diana and took a table at the far end
of the room. When Pierce finished he rose and moved over to them.
Scoggins showed a small surprise, and then the surprise faded but
his smile lacked the old warmth, the old closeness; and once
again Pierce had the sensation of being closed out. He said:
"Merry Christmas."</p>

<p>"Why," said Scoggins, "the same to you."</p>

<p>Diana looked up at Pierce, her face dark, her eyes suddenly
reserved. He had expected nothing else from her but his memory
this day was very clear and made him recall how different it once
had been. He said gravely, "I'm sorry about Lily Beth. Leaves you
a little lonesome, I'd imagine."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and continued to watch him. Somewhere in her
was a lasting judgment of him, like a scar burned in; and so she
sat, still unmoved&mdash;but hating him deeply.</p>

<p>He said, "Merry Christmas again," and moved to the lobby. He
stood in the lobby, lighting up a cigar. He found his coat and
slid into it. He stood irresolute and tall and bulky and taciturn
as people stirred steadily around him. From her place in the
dining room Diana observed him, noticing again how little he
seemed to need anything from other people. He was alone and
seemed to wish for no other thing. Yet she had her suspicion. He
had gone out of his way to come to this table and wish Scoggins
and herself a Merry Christmas; and he had expressed his regret to
her concerning Lily Beth. He had understood her feelings. Below
the iron crust of this man, as she had long known, was a capacity
for understanding. He had always had it but had never permitted
himself to show it. Hardness and distrust were his faith. And
now, she told herself, he was reaping the barren crop; this day
he was really lonely.</p>

<p>She was still watching him when Lil Shannon entered the lobby
with a huge, tawny-bearded miner. Lil at once came over to Pierce
and smiled and placed a hand on his arm. Diana marveled at the
long, easy smile Pierce showed back. These two talked a moment,
the big miner forgotten by them. Lil laughed at Pierce and a rose
color showed on her face and she was then an attractive woman,
eager and anxious to please this one man alone. Pierce said
something to her, and afterwards Diana noticed the little
answering shrug of regret from the dance-hall girl. The miner at
last grew weary of his neglect and claimed Lil, who walked into
the dining room with him; but as Lil took her place at a table
she lifted her head and smiled across the room at Pierce. None of
this did Diana miss. She watched Pierce straighten himself and
leave the hotel; afterwards she turned her attention to Lil and
gave the woman a long, close study.</p>

<p>"Here's your steak, Diana," said Scoggins.</p>

<p>She put Pierce out of her mind; she closed a door on him, but
when she did so she was smaller than she had been, for it was not
only Pierce she put beyond the wall but a part of her life which
bad once been so eager and so gay.</p>

<p>Scoggins said again gently: "Better eat, Diana."</p>

<p>She settled to her meal. "Ohristmas is a time for memories,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Nice things ahead&mdash;and mistakes behind."</p>

<p>She cast a swift glance at him. "Now and then you strike deep,
Ben."</p>

<p>"Don't think too long of what's behind. Tomorrow's the way to
look."</p>

<p>"You can't cross out the past. Who would really want to do it,
anyway? All the nice things and bitter things are mixed together
in the past. The times we cried and the times we laughed go
together. To look ahead is to be young, and that is right for us.
But it is the things we did yesterday, or didn't do, which make
us wise."</p>

<p>They talked idly through the meal; and afterwards left the
hotel, walking along through Wallace. Somewhere past the bakery
Diana caught Scoggins' arm and drew him against a house wall.
"Wait," she said and looked at something diagonally over the
street. When he stared that way he saw a man, heavy-bundled in
his coat, standing in the shadows beyond The Pantheon.
"Sitgreaves," she murmured.</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "This is something that happened before I
knew you, Ben."</p>

<p>She hadn't meant to close him out but nevertheless she had
lifted a fence on part of her life. He was outside that part,
well knowing that her own thoughts were all of Pierce, either
remembering him with hatred, or with some kind of love, or
perhaps simply tied by some obligation of old companionship. He
didn't know, and he wanted to know; and he felt his keen
jealousy.</p>

<p>Sitgreaves was watching something on Van Buren. Diana said,
"All right, Ben," and walked toward Van Buren Street rapidly.
There was nothing to be seen either way and Diana, after scanning
the street carefully and anxiously, shrugged her shoulders and
crossed with Scoggins to her cabin. Scoggins followed in and
waited until she had lighted a lamp.</p>

<p>"A little lonesome without Lily Beth," he said.</p>

<p>He was sorry he had said it. She had taken the parting hard
and now he observed that she could easily cry. "Well," he said,
"things like that happen."</p>

<p>"I remember you warned me, Ben. You told me not to love her
too much."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better put your heart on something else."</p>

<p>"You can't just trade your love around."</p>

<p>"Why, I suppose that's so," he answered. She wasn't a woman to
surrender things at the drop of a hat. She never would quit
loving Lily Beth. Then the rest of that thought moved in on him.
Nor would she ever quit loving Pierce, if she had ever loved him.
He didn't know about that, and now he realized he had to know;
and since he had no other way of going about it he simply dropped
his question flatly at her.</p>

<p>"How about me, Diana?"</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes at him, those expressive eyes of an
expressive woman. She could knock a man down with her eyes, as
she had done with Pierce; or she could be tender and soft. She
seemed to feel that way now, giving Scoggins a sudden thrust of
hope.</p>

<p>"You've been quite a while coming to that, Ben."</p>

<p>"Didn't want to rush in on another man's ground. I wasn't
certain about it. I'm still not. But if it means the end of
friendship between me and Jeff, that's how it will have to be. I
can't help it. I'll ask for myself."</p>

<p>"I remember how you came aboard the boat at Celilo. You didn't
fight. You just argued the purser down. You get what you're after
without making a fuss."</p>

<p>"I can fight, too, if I have to fight."</p>

<p>She still watched him, but he felt that he no longer had her
full attention. She had an expression which mirrored other
thoughts, she looked at him and saw other faces. It made him say
with his gentle stubbornness: "Diana, how about me?"</p>

<p>Her voice ran along wistful notes. "I ran away from safety and
comfort. I said I'd never go back to those things. I'd feel
ashamed of myself now if I did."</p>

<p>He spoke in a tremendously fallen voice: "Is that all I
mean?"</p>

<p>She answered him with a swift kindness. "I don't think so.
Yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Diana," he said, and put aside his loyalty to Jeff Pierce
with a painful, stinging effort, "You'll get no happiness from
Pierce."</p>

<p>"Why did you say that? He wouldn't have said it of you."</p>

<p>"I fought for that man once. I'd fight for him again. But I
know him well. Things have got to be his way. He'll break
anything that's against him&mdash;even a woman. That's what I'd
tell you, regardless of what you thought about me."</p>

<p>She asked a question which seemed beside the point to him.</p>

<p>"Where's Ollie?"</p>

<p>"I think he skipped."</p>

<p>"Then he has no friends left, has he? Jeff, I mean."</p>

<p>"I'm his friend. But I am your friend first."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "he has no close friends left. Now he knows
what it is to be quite alone. That had to come to him."</p>

<p>"He always was that way. There's no difference."</p>

<p>"Now he's feeling it. He didn't before. As long as he never
knew anything else it didn't matter. It couldn't hurt him. But he
found out there was something else, and now it hurts."</p>

<p>"Where'd he learn about something else?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"From me," she said and turned her face to him. What he saw
shocked him. Her expression was close to being cruel and her eyes
held that stirring anger he had witnessed only once before. "From
me. He knows how different his life could be. Now," and her voice
fell in full, hard weight on Ben Scoggins, "let him learn."</p>

<p>The scene had gotten away from Scoggins. Once he had her
interest. He no longer had it. The bitter and passionate
relations between these two people&mdash;of which he knew nothing
definite&mdash;simply swamped every other thing. He could not
have been more completely out of Diana's mind had Jeff Pierce
been in the room before her. There was in Scoggins a certain
amount of pride and a certain amount of jealousy, now making him
stiffly say: "I will let you alone with your quarrel."</p>

<p>She put a hand on his arm. "It is a good deal different than
you think, Ben. Jeff and I will never be nearer to each other
than we are now."</p>

<p>"Of course not," he said. "You ain't the same kind of
people."</p>

<p>"You're wrong. We're exactly the same kind of people. It is
all or nothing with each of us." She saw that, keen mind as he
was, he could not follow her reasoning and so, she added, "I want
to be honest with you, Ben. I don't know what I feel about you.
Let's not talk of this again for a while."</p>

<p>He said, "Good night," and left the cabin. Sitgreaves, he
noticed, had crossed over and stood in another shadowed area on
Wallace Street; he gave it no particular thought, his mind being
full upon the girl. She was full of unfathomed contradictions,
possessing all the sweetness and kindness a woman could have, yet
how swift her anger had risen and how resonant her voice had
become upon mention of Pierce! She was controlled by a deeply
passionate temper that would never grow less until it had been
satisfied. Scoggins, being a calm and temperate man with his own
standards of womanhood, looked upon this astonishing revelation
of Diana Castle's nature with an increasing thoughtfulness. The
fire he had seen made him uncomfortable.</p>



<p><br> Next day Pierce moved around the cabin half-heartedly
planning an addition to accommodate his horse which he had been
keeping in town. There was little else to do, the ground being
too solidly frozen for mining; and idleness increasingly bored
him. Later in the day he moved up-Gulch to borrow a pair of
snowshoes, returned to his cabin and made up a small pack of
grub, and thereafter struck into the hills with his gun. The
taint of town was on him, as old George Noon had prophesied it
would be, and the staleness and the increasing restlessness of a
cabin-bound man came upon him. That night, high back in the
Tobacco Roots, he made camp and watched the distant lights of the
Gulch, and felt grateful for the release which seemed to come to
him. The physical weariness of the climb into the hills dulled
the steady irritation he had been feeling, it diminished the
thoughts that circled endlessly through his head. Half-asleep and
half-awake before his fire, he had his old feeling of cleansed
and simplified aloneness; crouched in his blankets and attentive
to all the small sounds in the starkly bitter night, he reached
out and caught at the edges of his old content. A frozen moon
stood in the sky and the tree shadows lay black against the
surrounding snow; once four elk passed him in file. It was always
better to be this way, braced against the natural world and
listening to it, than to be any other way. And yet even then,
grasping for that simplicity of his earlier years, and feeling
its relief, he knew it was not enough. Once it had been; but now
it was not.</p>

<p>On that same night Sanders and Jim Williams and Lott and
Pfouts and eight or nine other men met in Fox's house in Virginia
City and signed the Vigilante oath. Pfouts was to be president,
Lott the treasurer, Sanders the counsel, Jim Williams the
executive officer. There were to be companies, with a captain for
each company. Each company, out on the trail, had complete
judgment and authority to pass sentence. The only sentence was to
be death, although it was within their power to banish a man if
they saw fit. Upon them all was pressed the inviolable oath of
secrecy.</p>

<p>Sanders stressed that. "We are working largely in the dark. We
know, or suspect, certain of the Innocents. Others we do not
know. They are all around us and they will be watching. Anything
we let drop will be picked up, either resulting in their escape
or in our own assassination. The hanging of Ives has not seemed
to impress them much. Gallegher and Tanner and Marshland are
talking big."</p>

<p>"There must be no delay," said Lott. "Speed is the essence of
this thing."</p>

<p>Jim Williams had an answer for that. "Ives was not alone in
the Tibault matter. Long John Franck mentioned Alec Carter. We'll
find him and put him to question."</p>

<p>"Include Dutch John Wagner and Steve Marshland, Jim. They were
involved in the last robbery on Moody's pack train. Some of the
boys recognized them."</p>

<p>"Marshland's left town, so's Carter," said Williams. "I hear
they went over to the Deer Lodge Valley. I'll get a group and go
after them."</p>

<p>It was nearing New Year's and Williams delayed until after the
first, meanwhile building up the Vigilante organization with
members from Nevada City and the other Gulch settlements. When he
was ready to leave for his scout he sent word up to Pierce's
cabin but found Pierce still gone; and so the group, consisting
of about twenty men, moved down the Gulch, passed Daly's, crossed
the Beaverhead and moved through the McCarty Mountains. Coming
down the Deer Lodge Valley they met Red Yeager riding the
opposite direction. Red was known by most of them as a man of
various occupations in the Gulch&mdash;and was liked by the
Gulch.</p>

<p>"Seen Alec Carter?" questioned Williams.</p>

<p>"Whole gang up at Deer Lodge on a New Year's drunk," said
Yeager, anxious to please. "Billy Bunton's there, too, and Whisky
Bill Graves." He traveled on, throwing casual advice to other men
in the column.</p>

<p>"Seems like we'll bag our game," said Jim Williams. But when
at dusk two days later the group came into Reilly's Ranch at
Cottonwood they found their game gone. Reilly said: "Red Yeager
came in here on the gallop with a letter warning the crowd to get
out of sight. Bill Bunton threw that letter somewhere around
here." Reilly moved around the ranch house and finally discovered
the note under a corner chair. He brought it back. When Williams
saw it he said: "That's George Brown's writing&mdash;George Brown
who tends bar for Dempsey."</p>

<p>"Bunton said it was from Brown," agreed Reilly.</p>

<p>"Yeager," said Biedler, "was returning from that chore when he
passed us."</p>

<p>The group fought its way back through a bitter three-day
blizzard. At the Beaverhead Ranch they heard the Yeager was
twenty miles farther up the river at a cabin. Williams set out
with five men, raced on through the snow and caught Yeager in the
act of rolling his blanket roll for further travel. When he saw
Williams' gun leveled on him he shook his head and all the spirit
went out of him. Stripped of his gun he returned with Williams to
the main crowd at the Beaverhead. Williams said: "We'll pick up
Brown at Dempsey's," and put his group immediately into motion.
Frostbitten, hungry and red-eyed for want of sleep, the posse
came into Dempsey's and nailed Brown.</p>

<p>Brown was a man without sand. When Williams passed him the
letter, he showed the group one pale, agonized expression and
bowed his head. "Yes," he said, "I wrote it."</p>

<p>Williams turned to Biedler: "Few of you fellows take Brown
ever in that corner and question him. Red, you come with us." He
took Yeager into another room of Dempsey's house, the rest of the
posse following. "Red," he said, "you carried the letter that
warned Alec Carter. That puts you in it. You know what we are,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"I've heard," said Yeager, calmly. He stared at the floor,
dismally contemplating his past and his future. "I had an idea of
leavin' the Gulch a week ago. Wish to God I had. I'm done for and
I knew it." He hit one hand against the other, crying out: "Bill
Bunton got me into this! I wish he was dead!"</p>

<p>"May get your wish," said Williams tersely, and moved back
into the main room. He left Brown and Yeager under guard, calling
the rest of the party outside. They stood around in the crackling
cold, comparing the stories of Yeager and Brown, until Williams
said: "That's the case. Vote your convictions just as you see
them. All for hanging step this way. All against, step the other
way." There was no dissent. The entire party moved over to the
hanging side.</p>

<p>"So be it," said Williams. But he considered his new duties
with some gravity and at last came to a decision. "I'd rather
know what Sanders and Pfouts think of this. We'll move on to
Laurin's Ranch for the night. I'll stay there with six or seven
men. The rest of you go on home. One of you see Sanders and
Pfouts and bring back what they say."</p>

<p>They put up at Laurin's. The next morning before daybreak,
Neil Howie returned from Virginia City and aroused Williams from
a sound sleep. "They say you're on the right track. Go
ahead."</p>

<p>Williams woke the rest of the party. Yeager and Brown stood
backed against Laurin's fireplace, both men drawn and silent.
"Guess you know what's comin'," said Williams. "I'm sorry for it.
Some of you boys go out and fix the ropes to those
cottonwoods."</p>

<p>Brown suddenly dropped to his knees and began to cry. "Just
give me a chance to get out that door! Let me get on a horse!
You'll never see me in this country...!"</p>

<p>Yeager reached over and kicked his partner in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Buck up!" He dropped his head and went through his terrible
thoughts and when he looked up he spoke Bill Bunton's name again.
"If you never do anything else, get him. He's not the only one,
but get him."</p>

<p>"Who's the others, Red?" asked Williams. "It won't help you
any but it would be doing the Gulch a favor. It would be on the
credit side of your book."</p>

<p>Yeager, as steady as any of the posse, shrugged his shoulders.
"I could stand a little credit where I'm going. Well&mdash;" he
looked at Williams intently, and dropped his first name into the
complete silence. "The leader is Henry Plummer."</p>

<p>"Don't start lying, Red!" warned Biedler.</p>

<p>"I know what I'm talking about. He pulled the wool over
everybody's eyes, but he's the reddest dog in the lot. He came
into this country with half a dozen killings on his hands. He
married a fine woman and he fooled Sanders and all the
respectable ones. But his woman left him, didn't she? He's the
brains. He organized this whole thing."</p>

<p>Williams slowly shook his head, saying nothing. The rest of
the posse stood in complete stillness. "Well," went on Yeager,
"here they are. You can take 'em down. There ain't a man that's
got a clean spot in his soul. I ought to know."</p>

<p>Williams found a pencil and rummaged up a piece of paper and
noted the names as Red Yeager intoned them one by one. Plummer
and Bunton and Ives. Ives had been second in command, as smart as
Plummer and as crafty. Cy Skinner and Steve Marshland, Dutch John
Wagner, Alec Carter and Whisky Bill Graves. Stinson and Gallegher
and Ned Ray, all Deputies. George Shears and Johnny Cooper and
Mex Grant and Bob Zachary. Boon Helm. Hayes Lyons. Clubfoot
George Lane. . .</p>

<p>"Him?" said John Fetherstone in surprise.</p>

<p>"Him," said Yeager. "Then there's Rube Ketchum, who's dead,
and George Lowry, Billy Page, Doc Howard, Jem Romaine, Billy
Terwilliger, Gad Moore. The country's shot with them, boys. And
there's another fellow nobody trusted much, but he was in on the
stage holdup when Hilton was killed. That's Ollie Rounds."</p>

<p>Williams looked at his list. "That's all, Red?"</p>

<p>"There it is," said Yeager. "I did my good turn, didn't
I?"</p>

<p>"All right," Said Williams. "Let's get this done."</p>

<p>Yeager turned through the doorway but Brown fell on his knees,
making it necessary for some of the posse to drag him by the
arms. They crossed the yard to the cottonwoods; here Yeager
turned and poured his contempt on Brown. "Damned shame I've got
to go to hell beside a yellowback like you."</p>

<p>Biedler had brought out a pair of chairs; on these the two men
were placed and the loops thrown about their necks. The Vigilante
affixing the noose to Yeager suddenly lost footing in the snow
and fell, carrying Yeager with him. He rose, angry at himself and
apologizing to Yeager. "We've got to do better than that,
Red."</p>

<p>There was, then, the last long silence. Brown trembled so
greatly that a Vigilante had to hold him by the coat. Yeager
looked down on the crowd, thinking his way slowly up to this
moment, framing some last thought in his head. Then he said: "Get
the rest of them, Jim. I'll feel better."</p>

<p>"We'll try," said Williams.</p>

<p>Suddenly two men rushed at the chairs and knocked them aside.
Williams took off his hat and he looked down. He was an
indomitable man, truly savage when aroused, and he would have
followed Red Yeager a thousand miles to satisfy his own deep
sense of justice. Yet he held his head down while the two men
died at the ropes' ends. Not until Biedler said: "They're dead,"
did he look up, and then it was to turn his eyes on the stocky
Dutchman. Biedler had watched the two drop with his gray face
showing its seamy pleasure; there was that strain of barbarism in
Biedler, honest as he was.</p>

<p>"I liked Red," said Williams. "He has some good in him."</p>

<p>He turned back to the house, and he stood inside by the fire
with his eyes fastened to the list Yeager had furnished him. It
was the last name, the name of Ollie Rounds, that held his
attention. Laurin had cooked up some coffee. Williams drank two
cups of it while he pondered. He had known a long time ago that
this clean-up would come and he had known it would be a dirty
chore; but he was a man who would flinch no part of it until it
was at last done&mdash;no single part from beginning to end. And
there was still another moment to come which he knew, would be
more brutal than what had gone before.</p>

<p>Biedler said: "Home now?"</p>

<p>"No," said Williams, "we have got something more to do. I'm
going to Virginia City. I'll be back. You fellows stay here and
catch up on your sleep." He left the house. White frost stood on
the whiskers of his horse and its breath turned to shallow white
steam in the air. The saddle leather, when he sat upon it, was
cold as ice.</p>



<p><br> He changed horses at Virginia and rode directly on to
Pierce's cabin, and found Pierce splitting wood. He said: "We've
been on a hunt and had some luck. We're going on another hunt.
Come along."</p>

<p>It was a command rather than an invitation. They had all
subscribed to the Vigilante oath&mdash;Pierce tacitly at the
first meeting&mdash;and they were all obligated to serve when
called. Pierce accepted it as such and stopped in his cabin only
long enough to put away the shotgun which had been leaning
outside the cabin wall and to buckle on his revolver. He followed
on foot behind Williams, reached town and saddled his horse.
Together the two moved southward through foot-deep snow churned
and scarred and flecked with the frozen mud of traffic.</p>

<p>"We hung Yeager and Brown this morning," said Williams.
"Yeager did some talking and left a list."</p>

<p>"Who's on it?"</p>

<p>"Plummer for one. He's the chief. That surprise you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Pierce, "not much. I never liked the way he scouted
around me in Bannack. Something wrong in the feel of the man." He
looked down the trail, half-closing his eyes: "I have met men
like Plummer before, smooth outside and rotten inside."</p>

<p>"Occurs to me," commented Williams, "you have met many kinds
of men."</p>

<p>"Most kinds. I am not much of a hand to be surprised at
whatever turns up."</p>

<p>Williams murmured: "Good way to be."</p>

<p>Williams stopped in Nevada City to pick up John Lott; the
three rode on without conversation. Down by Junction Parris
Pfouts came by on his horse. He turned about and joined them at
Williams' signal. Williams explained what had already taken
place, and mentioned the list. He went about halfway through the
list; then he said in a noncommittal way, "a few others," and
that was all he said between Junction and Laurin's Ranch. At the
ranch he called out the waiting crowd.</p>

<p>"Where we going?" asked Biedler.</p>

<p>"Past the Beaverhead. Up to that cabin beyond where Bain's
horse ranch was."</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"I don't really know," said Williams. "Billy Southmayd's
reported a man holing up there the last five-six days. We'll
look."</p>

<p>When they left the mouth of the Gulch the wind began to sweep
steadily at them. They reached the Cold Springs' Ranch and noted
a horse standing there; and Williams, who had a retentive memory,
suddenly said, "Pull up," and got down. The crowd followed suit
and part of the men came behind him as he moved on the door and
flung it open. Bill Hughes, who ran the ranch, was in the room
with one other man. That other man was Sitgreaves.</p>

<p>Williams said: "Where'd you get that horse?"</p>

<p>Sitgreaves said: "Bought it at Virginia City. From a fellow
named Marshland."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Williams. "That's Marshland's extra horse. He must
have needed money. When I saw the horse I figured maybe Steve was
in here. We're looking for him."</p>

<p>"Come on," said Pfouts. "It'll be dark before we get to the
Beaverhead."</p>

<p>But Williams watched Sitgreaves coolly. "What brings you
here?"</p>

<p>"Scouting the country," said Sitgreaves,</p>

<p>"Come on," said Pfouts again.</p>

<p>Williams gave Pfouts a half-irritated glance. "We've got
business here, Parris." He swung to Pierce. "This man took two
shots at you in Virginia, didn't he?"</p>

<p>The crowd, so far disinterested, now centered full attention
on Sitgreaves, who stood with his back to the fireplace, both
hands laced behind. He had a full square beard above which his
eyes showed a black-bright glint. He said nothing and showed no
fear.</p>

<p>"I was on the street that night," commented Williams. "The
fellow was in the crack between the Pony and Pete Recken's tent
store. He were a blue coat with brass buttons. I saw the brass
buttons shinin'. Those are the same buttons."</p>

<p>Sitgreaves gravely listened to Williams and thereafter passed
his attention to Pierce. He remained close-mouthed and outwardly
disturbed. Looking at this man's weathered face with its Yankee
tenacity and its fixed zeal, Pierce doubted if any power on earth
could bend Sitgreaves from his purpose save the sudden burst of a
bullet or the swift closure of a rope around his neck. This man
was a bloodhound who knew no other purpose than pursuit and
vengeance.</p>

<p>Williams was a patient man but he now turned impatient. The
crowd also grew restive. Pfouts said: "That the man, Jeff?" Yet
none of these people counted; and it were as if they had not been
in the room. Pierce faced Sitgreaves, thinking of the thousand
miles or more over which Sitgreaves had followed him, and he was
also thinking of the master of the <i>Panama Chief</i> as the
latter roared and rushed at him, and his mind jumped and stopped
at scenes along the succeeding way, at the wagon on which he had
smuggled himself and Diana, at Lewiston and on the long road over
the Bitterroots, at the miners' camp near the McCarty Mountains
when, near tears, she had stood before him with her whole heart
open. There his thinking ceased. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, not the man."</p>

<p>Williams gave him a sharp stare. "How would you know?"</p>

<p>"I know who the man was."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" pressed Williams.</p>

<p>Pierce said, "That's altogether my business, Jim, and I will
take care of it."</p>

<p>He watched Sitgreaves as he said it. He was saving this man
from a hanging, as Sitgreaves should be realizing. He was
avoiding a showdown with Sitgreaves as he had done before,
wanting none of the man's blood upon his hands. Sitgreaves,
staring so steadily back, showed no expression. There was no
break, no recognition, no silent admission of the charity
given.</p>

<p>Williams was wholly unsatisfied but Pfouts said, "That should
settle it. Now let's get on the way," and led the crowd out of
the ranch house. They were soon in the saddle, fording the
Stinkingwater and rising from the valley to the barren land lying
between this river and the Beaverhead. Even then grayness had
come upon the country and the wind drove at them with its needle-
keen cold. At full dark they swung from the stage road, moved two
miles north and picked up a light in a shallow coulee ahead.
Williams stopped here.</p>

<p>"Some of you circle behind. Some of you stick in front. Pierce
and Biedler and Howie and I will tackle the door."</p>

<p>These four dismounted and walked straight on, their feet
slipping and squealing in the snow. Biedler fell and rose with a
disgusted curse. There was a window covered over by an oiled
hide, through which light yellowly seeped, and flakes of fire
whipped up from a tin chimney and fled in the wind. Pierce and
Williams came upon the door together, and it was Pierce who
reached for the latch and held it a moment. He looked behind him,
seeing the crowd shift in the snow. Williams gave Pierce a short
stare and nodded, whereupon Pierce softly lifted the latch,
pushed open the door and stepped into the cabin.</p>

<p>A single man occupied the room, his back turned from the door;
at the first sound of entry he flung himself around and threw out
a hand toward a revolver lying on the table. But before he
completed the motion he checked himself and looked at Pierce, and
then a half-smile replaced the first visible shock of fear.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jeff."</p>

<p>Pierce said: "What are you doing down here, Ollie?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; "LET ME
LIVE!"</h2>

<p class="first">OTHER men crowded into the small cabin.</p>

<p>Rounds looked at them with keenest speculation, but that first
show of fear had vanished and now he displayed a careless
grin.</p>

<p>"Waiting for the wind to die down," he said. "I never did like
to be cold."</p>

<p>Pierce said: "What's the matter with Virginia City? This is a
hell of a place to spend the winter. I wondered about you. Been
looking for you."</p>

<p>Ollie said: "Got restless. I never stay in one place long. You
know that."</p>

<p>Pierce shook his head, neither understanding Ollie nor the
reason for Williams' leading the Vigilantes here. He turned to
Williams and observed the leader's steady stare to be on him.
"Water-haul, Jim. Who'd you think you'd find here?"</p>

<p>Williams said: "Ollie Rounds."</p>

<p>"All right," grumbled Pierce, "he's here, What of it?"</p>

<p>"You're slow on the catch, Jeff. Red Yeager gave us a list.
This man's name is on it."</p>

<p>"Don't be a damned fool," said Pierce. "I know Ollie."</p>

<p>"So do other men," said Williams.</p>

<p>"Ollie," said Pierce, "speak up."</p>

<p>"Let Williams talk," said Rounds, maintaining his self-
assurance. "What do you think I've done?"</p>

<p>"You were with Ives and Ketchum and Marshland when Hilton was
killed at the stage holdup."</p>

<p>"I was in Virginia City," said Rounds. "How could I have been
across the Beaverhead?"</p>

<p>"You're quick on the answer," commented Williams. "Most
innocent men couldn't be so sure of where they were four or five
months ago."</p>

<p>"That's easy," said Rounds. "I haven't left Virginia half a
dozen times in that many months."</p>

<p>Williams spoke over his shoulder. "Southmayd." Billy Southmayd
moved through the door and came abreast Pierce and Williams.</p>

<p>"Billy," said Williams, "what do you know? You drove that
stage."</p>

<p>"There were four of them," said Southmayd. "Ives and Ketchum
and this man&mdash;and one I never recognized. I knew Rounds
right off. He wore a big buffalo coat that had the fur partly
worn from the lapel. Yellow hair, blue eyes. His horse was a
solid bay with big ears and a callus just above the off rear
fetlock."</p>

<p>Pierce turned on Southmayd. He gave the man a black stare. "Be
careful, Billy."</p>

<p>"I'm apt to be careful when I'm helping hang a man, Jeff. It
was Ollie."</p>

<p>Williams said: "Where's the buffalo coat, Ollie?"</p>

<p>"Somebody held me up and took it, on Daylight Grade."</p>

<p>Biedler, planted in a corner of the room now added his bit of
information. "Tack McGuire found that coat, day after the holdup,
chucked behind a couple boulders near the mouth of Alder, beyond
Laurin's. Why would a man steal your coat on Daylight, then carry
it clean beyond Laurin's and throw it away?"</p>

<p>Williams said: "Red named you on the list, Ollie."</p>

<p>The silence fell. Pierce watched Ollie's face take its dark
and fatal stain. Light went out of Ollie's eyes and hope went out
of him. He faced the crowd and betrayed a fear too deep to hide.
His lip corners tightened and his nostrils swelled to deeper
breathing. Little by little the irony and rashness and the
smiling humor&mdash;all those things which gave Ollie his
flavor&mdash;died away and left him colorless.</p>

<p>"Ollie," said Pierce, "speak up!"</p>

<p>"Why did you come along?" asked Ollie Rounds sullenly.</p>

<p>Pierce shook his head. "I didn't know." He turned to Jim
Williams, as dangerous to Williams then as a man might be. "Why
did you bring me along?"</p>

<p>"I knew this was coming," said Williams. "I wanted you to see
for yourself, so you'd get it first hand and not second hand.
He's one of the Innocents, but he's got his right to have
somebody talk for him. Go ahead, talk for him."</p>

<p>"Red," said Pierce, "was a scoundrel. You believe what he told
you?"</p>

<p>Williams said in his unstirred voice: "Cross out Red's
testimony then. But Billy Southmayd's testimony still remains.
You know Billy to be a square man."</p>

<p>Pierce said: "Billy, how sure could you be in a situation like
that? Other men have got blue eyes and light hair and buffalo
overcoats."</p>

<p>Southmayd said: "Maybe. You know Ollie's horse?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Got a scar on its off rear fetlock?"</p>

<p>Pierce fell silent as he remembered back. There were gaps in
Ollie's Virginia City career which, now that he recalled them,
were bad. How had the man lived, flush enough to play poker at
Temperton's, to eat and sleep well? He remembered the overcoat
and the rubbed lapel. And he remembered the horse. "Yes," he
said.</p>

<p>"There you are," said Southmayd. "I might be mistaken in one
thing. I couldn't be mistaken in three or four things."</p>

<p>Pierce put his eyes on Ollie. "What were you doing down here,
Ollie?"</p>

<p>"I meant to pull out," said Ollie Rounds, and then he shrugged
his shoulders. "I always stay a little too long."</p>

<p>"This man," said Pierce, "is a friend of mine, Jim."</p>

<p>"Not enough," said Williams. "There'll be others of us with
friends like that, before this thing is done. And they'll hang.
It is not enough, Jeff."</p>

<p>"You will recall," said Pierce, "that he stepped out from the
walk and put himself between me and Ives and Marshland, when I
was down on my knees in the middle of the street. He stood so
they couldn't shoot."</p>

<p>"There's some good in every man," said Williams. "But it is
still not enough. He rode with Ives and he spent other men's
money at Tanner's bar. But go ahead, Jeff. He's your friend."</p>

<p>"He took my part against Ives and Ketchum in Lewiston," said
Pierce.</p>

<p>"The devil was an angel once," said Williams.</p>

<p>Pierce stepped forward and circled the table so that he was
beside Ollie Rounds. He looked at the dozen men packed into this
small room. "I suppose&mdash;" he said in a soft voice, and gave
his intentions away by the expression that ran over his face.
Suddenly Williams murmured a word and all these men flung up
their guns on him and blue light danced along those barrels.
"No," said Williams, "don't do it, Jeff."</p>

<p>"All right," Pierce said, grinding the answer between his
teeth. "All right."</p>

<p>Williams spoke to Biedler and Fetherstone. "Stay here," and
led the rest of the crowd outside. They went a short distance
from the cabin, their talk coming back in murmured spurts of
sound through the chill air. Ollie Rounds said, "If you don't
mind, gentlemen; I'd like to put on my coat. It is cold."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Biedler.</p>

<p>Rounds moved to the corner of the cabin and slid into his
coat. He buttoned the collar around his neck. "Sorry, Jeff," he
said.</p>

<p>Pierce listened to the rise and fall of talk in the yard; and
he heard the talk quit. Moonlight was strong enough for him to
notice a pair of men move away and by that he knew how the
decision went. Rounds knew it too. He paled and a little wincing
sound came from him as his fertile mind ran ahead to embrace the
last blow of pain and the last agony. He pulled his lips together
and moistened them and he thrust one mutely terrible appeal at
Pierce. Pierce shook his head. "I guess that's all, Ollie."</p>

<p>Rounds stiffened his shoulders. "What the hell?" he whispered.
"It happens sometime."</p>

<p>Pierce said: "What do you want me to do, Ollie?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Rounds. "No letters East, lying about my brave
end against the Indians. I've got nothing to leave except a few
bad memories. There was another time or two, Jeff, when I helped
you against Ives. Just want you to know that. I would help you
again. It really doesn't matter. There is only one thing on my
mind. I set out a long time ago to be the sort of a fellow you
are&mdash;just tough and not giving a damn. I never quite made
it, because I never had enough leather in me. But I found out one
thing which you should know, Tough or not tough, no man's got a
hole card big enough to play this damned funny game of living
alone. You'll find that out."</p>

<p>Williams came in. "Sorry, Ollie. I guess we're ready."</p>

<p>The agony of fear went through Ollie Rounds again, shrinking
him and chilling him; cursed with a vivid mind, he saw too
clearly the picture of his own end. He opened his mouth and a
strange sigh came out. He put his hand on the table and for a
moment stared at his feet. From some deep source he seemed to be
calling on his last remnant of pride, and succeeded and
straightened. "I have got to do this in proper shape," he said.
"I'd be damned ashamed to make a poor show." He had then, one
final flare of irony as he looked at the crowd half inside and
half outside the cabin. "I'm on the receiving end of this
business. You're not. Just pause a moment once in awhile and
consider if you could do it any better."</p>

<p>"All right, Ollie," said Williams and pointed to the door.</p>

<p>Ollie tried to smile at Pierce. "My love to Ben&mdash;my love
to Diana."</p>

<p>Pierce nodded. He said, "Luck, Ollie," and watched Rounds move
through the doorway. On the threshold Rounds turned, even then
his face turning indistinct to Pierce. "Jeff," he said hurriedly,
"don't let me hang out there in the wind too long. I can't stand
the thought."</p>

<p>"All right," said Pierce, and watched him march on with the
crowd. Biedler ran back and took the cabin's only chair, which
was a canned-goods box. Pierce moved to the stove. He put his
hands over it, and he held his head down, watching the color of
the fire flicker through the warped lid. Presently he moved from
the stove and stood with his back to the door. Time dragged on
and there was no sound; but he beat his hand slowly against the
wall, making a noise that would drown out the outer noise he
didn't want to hear.</p>

<p>Part of the crowd returned. Biedler came in with Williams, who
said, "All over."</p>

<p>Biedler, always practical, said: "I brought along a pick and
shovel. This ground's hard as rock."</p>

<p>"Bring him in here," asked Pierce. "We'll bury him under this
floor."</p>

<p>"No use spoiling a good cabin," objected Biedler.</p>

<p>Pierce stared at Biedler. "God damn you, shut up!"</p>

<p>Biedler's gray jaws set and he would have started a quarrel
had not Williams immediately checked it. "All right, Jeff. We'll
bring him in here."</p>

<p>Pierce threw the table to a corner of the room. He kicked at
the loose floor puncheons with his boot and reached down and
dislodged them and tossed them aside. Biedler disappeared, to
return with the pick and shovel. A pair of men brought Ollie
Rounds in and laid him on the floor.</p>

<p>"Now," said Pierce, "get the hell out of here."</p>

<p>Williams nodded at the others, sending them out. He paused in
the doorway. "Too bad," he said, "but that's how it goes."</p>

<p>"Shut the door," said Pierce.</p>

<p>When they had gone he took up the pick and broke the soil, and
thereafter began to shovel out the grave. The room grew warm. He
removed his coat and shirt and, stripped to his heavy undershirt,
continued the digging. Sweat ran down his face and dropped into
the deepening hole.</p>



<p><br> The hanging of Ives and the banishment of Hildebrand and
Franck had sharpened the attention of the toughs, but it had not
shaken their confidence. Gallegher and Marshland and Zachary and
those others who headquartered in Virginia City continued to
gather at Tanner's and to make their open boasts. The capture and
execution of Brown and Yeager and Rounds stirred them, though it
did not awaken them to their danger. Long triumphant in the Gulch
they remained blind to the signs about them until it became known
that Yeager had revealed the roster of the Innocents.</p>

<p>By that time it was too late. Acting in swiftest secrecy, the
Vigilantes now struck their hammer blows one after another. In
the first half of January Lott and Sanders led a party to
Bannack, rounded up Stinson, Ray and Sheriff Plummer and hung
them side by side to a shed rafter on the edge of town, with
Plummer&mdash;the chief and the symbol of all that was
lawless&mdash;falling to his knees and crying out his abject
terror: "cut off my arms, cut off my ears&mdash;but let me
live!"</p>

<p>Scarcely had the news of this traveled to Virginia City when
Jim Williams threw a ring of Vigilantes around the town and took
into custody Gallegher, Skinner, Clubfoot Lane, Boone Helm and
Frank Parrish. There was no formal trial, for these men had long
since convicted themselves by their record. Each had his moment
to confess or deny, to curse and beg, and thereafter was led to
the ceiling joist of a new building on Wallace Street. Gallegher,
who, as Plummer's Deputy, had made a travesty and a joke of the
star he wore, maintained his character to the last. His final
request was for a drink and when he received it he laid the full
bitter venom of his soul upon the world and died defiantly.</p>

<p>Fear left the Gulch and sentimental pity vanished. All the
accumulated memories of injustice, all the thwarted
righteousness, all the recollections of good men murdered
gathered in terrible momentum. The Vigilantes rode through
January's storms, hunting down their men one by one in the
canyons and remote settlements and isolated cabins, and pulled
them out and passed sentence upon them, by day or by late night,
and hung them at whatever tree or corral arch happened to be
handy. In this fashion passed Steve Marshland, Bunton, Alec
Carter, Zachary, Johnny Cooper. Ranging far over to the Gallatin
Valley, to Fort Owen, and to the Bitterroot Valley, the
Vigilantes also caught George Shears, Whisky Bill Graves and Bill
Hunter. Jim Williams carried a list of these men in his pocket
and scratched them out one at a time until at last late in
February he drew a line through the last name. All those who had
been active Innocents were accounted for and disposed of. In this
corner of Montana gray-yellow mounds of earth, unmarked for the
most part, testified to a terror and to an evil power come to an
end. That same month Oliver's stage left Virginia City with forty
thousand dollars of gold dust and reached Bannack without
incident. In little more than twenty days the malignant thing of
six months' growth had been completely removed in clean, cruel
excisions.</p>

<p>Watching that stage roll down Wallace Street with its
treasure, W. B. Dance spoke regretfully to his partner Stuart of
other treasures unrecovered: "Too bad to think of all the money
Ives and his crowd got away with."</p>

<p>"It brought 'em nothing," said Stuart. "Liquor took it, and
women, and the poker tables. All they got was a grave."</p>



<p><br> Pierce came into Dance and Stuart's during late afternoon
to take his dust from the safe and walk over to Oliver's express
office, there consigning it to Mary Morris. Afterwards he dropped
in at the Virginia Hotel and spent the best part of a half-hour
writing a letter to her, explaining his stewardship.</p>

<p>He had never met this woman, and never would. Yet the
obligation laid down by Barney was cemented not only by one man's
faith in another but by the memory of a woman at the entire mercy
of someone two thousand miles removed. His own mother, long ago,
had been thus left alone to suffer in a thoughtless, unmerciful
world. He remembered that as he wrote to Mary Morris. Mary Morris
was the receiver of a fidelity his own mother had never had from
any living soul.</p>

<p>In full dark the sound of wind drummed Virginia's walls and
snow began to race by. He left his letter with the clerk and
moved down to Doc Steele's cabin. He sat with Steele awhile,
discussing the claim he now shared with Mary Morris.</p>

<p>"If it were entirely mine," he said, "I'd feel free to dispose
of it as I saw fit. It is her half-interest that bothers me. She
could be bilked by a dishonest man."</p>

<p>"What does this lead up to?" asked Steele.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving the Gulch."</p>

<p>"Winter's a hell of a time to be traveling," said Steele. That
was his first, practical reaction. Then he added: "Why leave?
Spring's coming, the toughs are wiped out and you'll see the
biggest camp in the West."</p>

<p>"It may be," agreed Pierce, not interested.</p>

<p>"Not many times in a century," reflected Steele, "when a man
can start at scratch with a country that's starting at scratch. I
wish I were as young as you. Like to think that maybe fifty years
from now I could stand on this street and look back to everything
that happened, knowing I saw it start." He remembered his
classics and drew out an appropriate phrase. "'All of it I saw
and some of it I was.' That's a rare thing. Gives a man a feeling
having lived a full and useful life."</p>

<p>Knowing Pierce's skeptical streak he expected to hear some
half amused and half bitter retort on the general nonsense of a
man's hoping to leave any permanent mark behind him. But Pierce
only shrugged his shoulders. "Perhaps," he said. The old bubble
of vinegar and alum was missing. Pierce had turned quiet. And,
the doctor reflected, when a man in the full prime of an
exceptional vigor turned quiet it augured a pretty deep
disturbance. Perhaps it was the death of Ollie Rounds, perhaps it
had something to do with Diana Castle. The talk around town was
that she was marrying Scoggins. Virginia was like that, a
labyrinth of gossip; everybody knew everybody else's affairs.</p>

<p>"You know of a good man we could trust with the claim?" asked
Pierce.</p>

<p>"What you want for your half?"</p>

<p>"I'll just turn it over, same way it was turned over to
me."</p>

<p>"Hell," said Steele, "it is worth five thousand dollars any
day."</p>

<p>"Don't need five thousand dollars very much. How about Mark
Tyson?"</p>

<p>"He'd do," agreed Steele.</p>

<p>"I'll talk to Mark," said Pierce and rose.</p>

<p>"Have supper. Those are damned good elk steaks in the fryin'
pan."</p>

<p>"Not tonight, Will," said Pierce and went out. He took a quick
tour of the saloons and saw nothing of Tyson, and afterwards
dropped into Pfouts and Russell's and spent a good deal of time
on a pair of snowshoes and a light pack sack. He owned both a
shotgun and revolver, neither of which would be the best weapon
on a long trail, and so he bought a second-hand Spencer. That was
all. The lighter a man traveled the better it went. One man, one
campfire, one set of blankets&mdash;and no obligations. He stood
at the counter, more or less looking ahead at the trail while the
clerk patiently waited. The clerk was a small man. Pierce stared
over his head, eyes narrowed into the future, receiving the
impressions of the fore-ordained trail, the smell of wet wood
burning, the white hillsides and the pine boughs whose snow
dropped as he touched them, and the ghostly glow of moonlight and
the thin crack of a creek coursing between its ice and margins,
with the print of game tracks leading down to it; and the black,
ragged edge of mountains breaking against the skyline, and the
wild drums of the wind.</p>

<p>"That's all?" asked the clerk.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pierce. Usually there was a feeling about breaking
camp and moving on to new country. Usually everything went off
his shoulders, all the old cares and memories, so that for a
little while a man got back to simplicity and was content to ride
and sleep, and ride again. It wasn't quite that clear or that
fresh this time. The old anticipation didn't stir alive. A man
was like a wagon which, starting empty, accumulated freight as it
traveled, the burden getting greater and the hills seeming
tougher to climb. Nor could a man stop and dump out the load. He
came to this camp empty-handed but he left it with heavy things
and couldn't dump them.</p>

<p>He tucked his new possessions under an arm and moved to the
Senate for a drink. Lott and Pfouts and Williams were at a corner
table, heads together. They got up and joined Pierce at the bar.
Percy Fadden, who ran the Senate, set up a bottle and glasses. He
said, "On the house, gentlemen." Scoggins arrived and they drank
a round. They talked a little, but nothing said was important;
they were like men relaxed after a hard chore, saying little
about it but content with it.</p>

<p>Pierce said: "What's the trail over to Deer Lodge look like
now?"</p>

<p>"Lot of snow," said Williams.</p>

<p>"Have another," said Pierce, "on me."</p>

<p>"Celebration?" asked Pfouts.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Pierce. He lifted his glass at Williams. "It's
all right, Jim."</p>

<p>"That makes it better," said Williams.</p>

<p>They drank on it. Then Williams said, "Well, supper," and
moved away with Lott and Pfouts. Scoggins scanned Pierce with a
dry, thorough glance.</p>

<p>Pierce said: "You're putting on weight, Ben. Country agrees
with you."</p>

<p>"I guess it does. I'm always a hand to take things as they
come. My people all settled down and got fat with good living.
Joined the church and the town council. New England is full of
Scogginses who have got to be eighty years old. What you want to
know about the Deer Lodge trail for?"</p>

<p>"Going out that way."</p>

<p>Scoggins looked down at his feet. He had a fair and ruddy
face, an easy-going, steady face. Thought made a flurry across it
and he said: "Have one on me, Jeff," and poured from the bottle.
"How far you going?"</p>

<p>"Until something stops me."</p>

<p>Scoggins leaned on the bar with both elbows. He took a finger
WId traced out a pattern on it. He said in a mild, slow way:
"Sorry you couldn't stay on long enough to see Diana and me
married."</p>

<p>"A fact?" murmured Pierce.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That deserves another," said Pierce and reached for the
bottle.</p>

<p>Scoggins said, "Well, wait. I had to talk against you with
her. I said you would bust anything that was in your way. You
couldn't help it. That's what I said. I like you both; but I'd
have to tell her that."</p>

<p>"You may be right," said Pierce. "Here's your drink."</p>

<p>Scoggins pushed the glass away. "Things don't seem right.
What's happened&mdash;what's happened?"</p>

<p>Pierce said: "You knew about Ollie a long time back, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"I knew he was on the crooked side two months ago. I warned
him to get out of town before this happened. Well, he started,
but he didn't get far enough."</p>

<p>"I didn't know about him," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"I guess most people knew&mdash;except you. That is the hell
of it. You liked Ollie a lot. So nobody said anything." He sighed
again. "Something is wrong as hell."</p>

<p>"Sun's gone down," said Pierce.</p>

<p>"It'll come up tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Not on the same things," said Pierce and turned from the bar.
"See you sometime."</p>

<p>Scoggins didn't answer at all. At the door Pierce turned to
find his partner scowling across the room at him. He went out
with his snowshoes and pack and rifle under an arm. He moved down
Wallace until he got opposite the bakeshop, and here he stopped,
long looking at the light shining through its window, A miner
went in, and later came out. Presently Pierce crossed the street,
pushed the door open and entered.</p>

<p>When she saw him the color of her eyes changed; they filled
with the shadow he always brought, they were hardened by the
memory of what lay so solidly between them.</p>

<p>He stood at the door; he closed it and put his back to it. "My
best wishes," he said. "Ben just told me."</p>

<p>Ben, she thought, had been right about Jeff. He wished her
well, but he hated the thought with all his tremendous power of
feeling. He could not be mild, he could not stand defeat. He was
a tall black-shaped man in the room, half threatening. Against
him her softness had never helped. In another moment, she
realized, they would be openly quarreling.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that's all. I'm leaving in the morning. Good-
by."</p>

<p>"Leaving?" she said and watched him with a full wide glance.
"For where?"</p>

<p>"Some place. Maybe another town with another woman I can take
on another boat."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wish another woman that experience," she said.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he said, and seemed then anxious to know.</p>

<p>He shifted the things under his ann and she noticed the break
of trouble and one gray, empty glimpse of inner perplexity. "Why
not? What have I done that's wrong?"</p>

<p>"According to your lights, nothing."</p>

<p>"I am not as proud as you might think. I am more humble than
you think."</p>

<p>She threw her strong cry at him: "You have needed a beating!
You have needed to be knocked in the dust and bruised, and left
with the life half out of youl That never came to you. But
someday it will!"</p>

<p>"That's happened to me," he said.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>He started to tell her, and changed his mind. He thought of
Ollie and he thought of her, and of the feeling of emptiness that
came to him now. He was so much muscle and bone wrapped around
hollowness, But if he spoke he would seem to her to be crying
over failure, asking for a pity he had no reason to ask for.
Before her he had stood for certain things. Maybe he no longer
stood for them, but he could not admit that now. She hated
weakness no less than he; and her scorn would grew. So he pushed
all the explanations aside. "I remember how you smiled at me in
that Portland rooming house."</p>

<p>She cried out: "If you remember so well, remember when I
stopped smiling at you!"</p>

<p>"For that," he said, "I have nothing but regret. I told you
so, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"But you never really understood, Jeff. When I&mdash;" She
ceased talking, the memory of that one scene returning, so tragic
for her, so unbearably humiliating. She had opened her arms and
she had offered him everything, trusting him to understand how
full her heart was, how faithful and everlasting the offer was.
He had not understood. By one cool glance he had shamed her and
scorched away the moment's fineness; and had left her bare and
full of hate. "Good-by," she said.</p>

<p>He nodded and left the room. She stood at the counter,
listening to his steps strike the walk and afterwards grow silent
on the snow-packed ground. Wind shouldered against the cabin and
her baker stepped in from the back room. "Bread's done."</p>

<p>"Go on home, Max."</p>

<p>There was a shout and a shot in the wind, and the wind flung
these sounds against the wall of the shop. She said, "Oh, my
God!" and rushed at the door and wrenched it open. The freezing
wind roughed against her; snow made a thickly flittering screen
all along the street, through which the shop lights spread vague
and round-yellow stains. Beyond her, near Van Buren, Pierce
slowly turned and dropped his snowshoes and his carbine and pack
and called down Wallace: "Sitgreaves&mdash;I don't want to touch
you!"</p>

<p>Sitgreaves, having come out of an alley near the Senate, now
lifted his revolver, took aim and fired again. Wind shook him,
the gun's explosion swayed him. Then Diana's glance raced back to
Pierce and she watched him draw and call again: "Go on
away&mdash;damn you!" Agony got into her, so that she silently
cried out to him: "Fire!" He was not firing. He held the gun
half-poised while he faced Sitgreaves in the mealy shadows at the
other end of the street. Having poor sight of his target,
Sitgreaves now paced forward with his nerveless patience, aiming
as he marched. Pierce shouted once more: "Put down the gun!"
Sitgreaves fired, and stopped long enough to stare at Pierce
still on his feet and still untouched. Sitgreaves shook his head,
again advancing.</p>

<p>Diana could no longer look toward Pierce. She listened for his
voice to come and, waiting, she watched Sitgreaves deliberately
steady his revolver for another careful shot. This, Diana
thought, engrossed in her terror, would be the fourth bullet.
Sitgreaves braced his feet in the snow, he brought up his free
arm to support the gun. People stood along the building walls in
the ice-blast and Scoggins was at the Senate's door, his hand
half lifted. One round echo raced with the wind, louder to her
than the others. It was not Sitgreaves' gun. Sitgreaves' gun
became a weight too heavy for his hand and dropped to the ground
and the man tipped his face, shocked and unbelieving, to the sky
and fell into the street's muddy snow.</p>

<p>Pierce came by her, reached Sitgreaves and fell to his knees.
She heard him say: "I'm sorry. I didn't want to do this. Lift up
your head."</p>

<p>But Sitgreaves was dead and Scoggins and Williams and X.
Biedler moved forward and stood around Pierce, and Biedler patted
Pierce on the back. Pierce threw Biedler's hand away; he rose and
swung on his heels. This was only twenty feet from her so that
she saw then the futile remorse, the deep despair he revealed. He
had forgotten to be hard, he had forgotten to be strong&mdash;and
it was this loss in him that shattered her reserve. When he
arrived abreast the bakeshop she stepped out to him. "Jeff," she
said, "Jeff&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "this should please you, Diana."</p>

<p>She gave him a thorough and penetrating glance. She witnessed
the break of his spirit, she heard in his voice the cry of
emptiness and the misery of emptiness. "Now you know," she
murmured and caught his arm and firmly held him.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "the joke is on me. I saw all this coming and
I could do nothing about it."</p>

<p>She never ceased to watch him with her stern composure. "So
now you'll run away from it, and you'll keep on running and
hating and you'll wear yourself out fighting the world you think
is so blind and unjust, and the world will have you as its victim
after all."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "there's no hate left in me. I have seen too
much of it. And I am not running. I'm just leaving some bad
mistakes and some damned painful recollections behind me."</p>

<p>"One of them," she said, making it as hard for him as she knew
how, "is the recollection of what you did to me."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "That's one of them."</p>

<p>"How far do you think you must go to forget me? How many hills
will you have to put between us, how many rivers, how many miles?
I'm in your head and I'm in your body. I put myself there and
I'll be a misery in your bones as long as you live. That's paying
you back for what you did to me. I'm a lot like you. I can wreck
your dreams as much as you have wrecked mine."</p>

<p>"Sure," he said, and drew beyond the touch of her arm.</p>

<p>"Good-by&mdash;and I wish you luck. You and Ben."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I don't want it that way. We have hurt each
other too much to be enemies or friends. It is more than that. If
you've got to go, take me along."</p>

<p>He straightened before her and he looked at her with his
powerful and disturbing thoughts. "Another chance, Diana?"</p>

<p>"We could never live apart. Everything would be so dull, so
empty."</p>

<p>"Yes," he told her, "damned empty," and moved back to her. She
was not quite smiling but he saw on her face the expression which
had first puzzled him in Portland&mdash;the flurry of excitement
and laughter and the inexhaustible capacity for living. She was a
woman who could not fold her hands and be placid; she would
always hunger, as he hungered, for inexpressible things. When he
drew her forward in this night's colder and colder wind and
kissed her, some part of that hunger had appeasement, and he knew
then what real wonders the world held.</p>

<p>She drew away, now laughing and showing him the old gay streak
of temper. She caught his arm and drew him toward the bakeshop.
She said: "This is why I left Portland, Jeff. I was born for this
and every moment of my life I have been waiting for it. Come
inside."</p>

<p>Scoggins, still at Tanner's doorway, watched the door close
upon those two; and thereafter he shrugged his shoulders and
dismissed his own hopes. Now that he came to think of it he
realized he had never been very sure of Diana. The big
fellow&mdash;the big fellow's shadow&mdash;had always been
present whenever he and Diana had been together. Maybe it was
something written in the book; if so there was no use nursing
sorrow, and perhaps the old friendship and the old strong
loyalties would bloom again. That, he thought, would be mighty
nice. Upon this note he turned into Tanner's for another drink,
being the kind of man to adjust himself reasonably to misfortune.
It was, though, odd about those two people: How could a man like
Jeff, capable of such fury and destruction, make his peace with a
woman with so passionate a temper? How did love come out of
brimstone and sulphur? It confused him. But then, he thought, he
was a different kind of a man and liked life to be simple. They
did not.</p>

<p>One other person on this street bad been a spectator to the
scene, and when the bakeshop door closed upon Diana and Jeff, Lil
Shannon returned to The Pantheon. The music was in full swing and
a miner waited with a ticket. He claimed her and moved with her
to the floor. "And whut's so serious?" he asked. "Smile for me,
Lil."</p>

<p>That was her profession&mdash;to smile and please. She put the
tip of a finger to her eyes and drew it swiftly across them, and
lifted her face to the miner and smiled.</p>
