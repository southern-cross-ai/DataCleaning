<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER 1. &mdash; HUGH TRACY RETURNS</h2>

<p class="first">HUGH TRACY passed Indian Flat around seven of
the morning, traveling fast and feeling only a slight pucker in
his right flank where the bullet hole had been three months
healing. High desert sunlight lay in stippled patches along the
low pine-belted ridges, and the intervening gulch walls seemed a
rawer red than he remembered them to be. Long absence had done
this, had begotten a consuming hunger for home soil; thus when
Dead Axle grade reached its summit and let him out upon a
thousand-foot ledge, the scene rolling off yonder struck him
straight between the eyes. Impatient as he was, he stopped to
realize the picture that had been in his mind through so many
weary days.</p>

<p>It was unchanged, changeless; and one cotton-white cloud fluff
stood overhead in seemingly the same spot such a cloud had been
the day of his ambush. The grand old scarps of Mogul and Powder
rims&mdash;sheer and black faces confronting each other across
nine miles of distance&mdash;took up a northern march, slimming
into the far-off heat haze. Below and between ran the girted
Powder desert, turned tawny by summer's ceaseless sun. Halfway up
the valiey and covered by Mogul's shadow, the buildings of
Antelope town created indistinct outlines. Beyond that a lesser
spur flanged out from Mogul, only a blue and blurred suggestion;
but his eyes rested there longest.</p>

<p>"Well," he mused, "it is still there," and some nameless,
clinging fear left him. He reached for his tobacco and curled a
cigarette with fingers bleached a hospital white. Then, the smoke
drawing well, he pressed down the trail somewhat recklessly. It
was a full, fine feeling&mdash;to return erect and sound when he
had never expected to return at all. Ninety days ago he had come
up to this grade in the bottom of a flat-bed wagon, lying on a
bloody mattress and deep in the fathomless pit whither a bullet
had sent him. All he remembered of it now was insubstantial, like
the misty phantasms of a bad dream&mdash;kerosene stench from a
lantern, the jolt of the wagon, Bill Vivian's cursed-out rage.
Once his open eyes had recognized the polar star's timeless
shining.</p>

<p>"But I'm back," he told himself, and felt the good heat
loosening long-closed partitions in his body; this land was his
medicine. At the bottom of the grade he swung into a road
coursing diagonally across the Powder desert toward Antelope town
in the distance. Alkali smell rose off the earth, and the miles
of sage and mahogany bush and tumbleweed swept away. Dust devils
swirled vagrant against the strengthening flare; the Vigilante
tree stood alone as it always had. Nothing was changed.</p>

<p>Yet even as he said it his eyes&mdash;gray in humor, dull
slate when angered&mdash;found change. The forward casting glance
touched that point on the road where a plank bridge should have
crossed Fetterman's dry creek bed, and found no bridge; nothing
but charred fragments. Coming up, Hugh Tracy wheeled beside the
depression and looked down. First inspection showed him something
other than plain fire. In the rubbish was part of a double-tree,
some bits of scorched harness, and the skeletal iron remnants of
a wagon. He studied it with furrowed thoughtfulness until he had
the story. And when he had the story, he dipped across the gully
and went on. "Recent and plain enough," he muttered. "Harness
means horses. Horses means somebody was pullin' a load across the
bridge, and got stopped. Forcibly stopped."</p>

<p>That first scent of trouble perceptibly changed him. He
pressed on, scanning the surrounding country with a sharper eye,
sitting a little stiffer in the saddle, face more drawn together.
He knew the Powder desert too well to be astonished, yet he had
been away from it just long enough to let its antagonisms and
flurries of violence soften in his mind. Now, less than a half-
hour after entering the valley, he was bluntly reminded that he
had to put up his guard again, and again travel with his senses
whetted for the unexpected. His holiday was over, and he was back
where he had been before the ambusher's bullet felled him.</p>

<p>At thought of it he grinned slightly, that slow shift of
muscles pulling his naturally dark cheeks into a rather skeptical
cast. The lines of his face were square and came to definite
endings at chin, mouth, and neck. Black-haired, big-boned, he had
a manner of tipping his head forward to study whatever stood in
front of him with a long, slow inspection; and the deep gray of
his eyes was apt to be expressive only when the combustible
elements of his temper fused to produce a rough humor or an anger
that flashed out hard and rebellious. The Powder desert knew him
thoroughly and followed him with close interest. He never
smoothed his words for policy, and his enemies, suffering from
the slashing roughshod manner of those words or from the effect
of his big, ready fists, hated him thoroughly&mdash;as the bullet
mark in his body testified. Yet Bill Vivian had cried openly at
sight of Hugh Tracy lying half dead in the flat-bed wagon. He was
twenty-five; physically powerful, always restless and
unconforming; nor had anybody yet penetrated the widely varying
and deeply accented tempers of this man to discover what made
them so.</p>

<p>"You bet I'm back," he observed quietly, "and somebody will be
interested to know that. Mighty interested."</p>

<p>Thus around high noon Antelope saw him come racking down the
dusty street as of old. He sat straight in the saddle, both fists
locked in front of him, elbows up; underneath a cream Stetson
were features not quite as bronzed as the town remembered, but
the gray eyes were as quick and direct and penetrating as
ever.</p>

<p>For his part he was surprised at the quiet in Antelope on
this, a Saturday afternoon. The hitch racks were mostly
unoccupied, the walks deserted. One man slept in a chair beneath
the stable arch, a pair idled at the hotel corner; and half a
dozen sat on Lou Burkey's saloon porch. Reining beside the porch,
he found himself wondering. He knew none of them, which was
strange enough in a country where every rider could describe
every other rider from memory; and as he stepped to the ground,
he found himself carefully considered by all in that peculiar
range manner which is level-eyed and without apology. Casually
nodding, he spoke:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, how."</p>

<p>A studied stillness held them. One man tipped his head,
another poked back his Stetson with a thumb; and that was the sum
of their answer. Hugh Tracy's mouth corners sagged a little, his
stare hardened. If it wasn't hostility they displayed it was bad
manners, and at no time was he disposed to ignore either
condition. But there was an increase of puzzlement in him, and so
he placed those six faces in a corner of his mind for future
consideration and pushed through, to the saloon's darkened
interior. Here was more quiet emptiness. Lou Burkey stood alone
behind his own bar and played solitaire, not looking up until he
had shifted one card and tallied another on its ace.</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy grinned. "Good customer of yours has returned,
Lou."</p>

<p>Lou Burkey's face was moon-round and olive, masked by a heavy
mustache. At all times it was a good poker face, but Hugh, slowly
ceasing to smile, saw some powerful thought shift the saloon-man
into a heavy, self-conscious reserve. Burkey's lids slowly
squeezed up into the light of enigmatic, copper-shaded eyes. Both
pudgy palms turned downward on the bar. Nor could anything have
been more lackluster than his greeting.</p>

<p>"Hello, Hugh."</p>

<p>"Hard to revive me, after tallyin' me for dead?"</p>

<p>Lou Burkey said: "You're twenty pounds short of what you
was."</p>

<p>Tracy shrugged his shoulders. "I'll get that back. Push me
over a drink."</p>

<p>"Where you goin' now?"</p>

<p>"Hell of a question! Home, of course. Where would you
think?"</p>

<p>"Never do another man's thinkin' for him," said Burkey
calmly.</p>

<p>"Do I have to write you a note about that drink?"</p>

<p>Burkey reached around, sent a glass spinning over the bar,
placed a bottle carefully beside it. Tracy stared at the single
glass, half offended. "What's the matter with you, man? Drink
with me. It ain't every day a dead man returns to Antelope."</p>

<p>"No offense. My stomach is poorly." The saloonman turned to
the cards and piled them together, beginning a haymow shuffle.
The calculated indifference was too obvious to miss. Tracy downed
his whiskey neat with an increase of irritation.</p>

<p>"What's happened to the usual Saturday gang around here?".</p>

<p>"Busy in the hills this year. Shiftin' cattle. It's been
dry."</p>

<p>"Where's Bill Vivian?"</p>

<p>Burkey shook his head. "Ain't heard. Guess he got a sack of
grub and took a long <i>pasear</i> for himself."</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy laid a quarter beside his glass, bringing Burkey's
eyes right back to him. "Antelope," said he, deliberate enough,
"is so dead it stinks and ought to be buried. And who are those
tongue-tied gentlemen sunnin' their moccasins on your porch?"</p>

<p>"Shadrow's men."</p>

<p>Tracy's glance whipped back from the saloon windows and
centered on Lou Burkey's moon cheeks. "Look here, is he importing
hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm all out of answers," said Lou Burkey. "Hughey, no hard
feelin's, if you please. But I'm not your friend. Not these
days."</p>

<p>Tracy grunted, suddenly catching on. The rebuff left him
without anger. This was Powder desert, and this was what he
returned to; schemings and contrivings, threats and some form of
vengeance by day or night&mdash;all this heavy current of
intrigue beneath the apparent calm of the land. He ceased to be
puzzled. For, without knowing what this game might be, he
realized it was a part of an older game never played out. A small
contempt of Lou Burkey, of whom he once had thought better, took
hold of him. Bone and blood an individualist, there was nothing
in life Hugh Tracy hated more than pressure. He fought it
savagely, instinctively, without bothering to furnish a reason
for his fighting. Another man's buckling under roused only his
scorn. His words went flat.</p>

<p>"I told you something was dead around here."</p>

<p>"Careful," said Burkey, so rapidly that Tracy straightened,
half thinking the saloonman meant to make a quarrel of it. But he
was mistaken. Burkey's head twitched slightly toward the porch.
Out there the murmur of talk had ceased. Tracy grinned and walked
casually from the place. The six were postured as they had been
before, excepting one man who stood now near the door. Gathering
up his reins, Tracy made a general observation at them.</p>

<p>"If you boys work for Tade, don't let him find you wearin' the
seat off your britches. Tade's peculiar in that respect."</p>

<p>The man nearest the saloon door struck instantly back. "Who in
hell was talkin' to you?"</p>

<p>"And you're not dumb, like I thought!" marveled Tracy,
ironically. The grin returned, hard and sharp. "Now that you
mention it, nobody's talkin' to me. But I'm talkin' to you.
Objections?"</p>

<p>The man stared, flashed a sudden side glance at his partners,
and pulled his thin lips together. When he spoke again it was
with considerable less hostility. "Go sleep it off."</p>

<p>"The crushing answer of a bright mind," applauded Tracy.</p>

<p>"Look here," snapped the other. "Who stepped on your
corn?"</p>

<p>"I was taught as a little boy," said Tracy, "that it was just
politeness to answer a man's greetin'. I hate to have a howdy
bounce back in my face."</p>

<p>The other stood fast, more and more watchful, apparently
warned by Tracy's ready sarcasm. Tracy gathered the reins.
"Better go tell Tade I'm back&mdash;that Hugh Tracy is back.
He'll love to hear it." And he walked the pony over to the stable
trough. The fellow under the arch still slumbered, or seemed to,
and after a short survey, Tracy cantered on down the street. He
passed a row of poplars, skirted the picket fence of Antelope's
graveyard. Looking in, he caught the mark of change once more in
the form of a fresh mound of broken dirt; instantly
apprehensive&mdash;for he was thinking now of Bill
Vivian&mdash;he rode in and looked down at the new headboard. It read:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">Charley Sullivan. ?&mdash;1893.</p>

<p><br>
The hocks of Hugh Tracy's horse had no more than beat up
Antelope's dust when Lou Burkey came out of his saloon and
interrupted the talk passing between the six hands.</p>

<p>"Get this right," said he. "You follow Tracy's advice. Go tell
Tade Shadrow he came back&mdash;that Tracy came back."</p>

<p>The one who had absorbed Hugh Tracy's sarcasm showed the
rankling resentment in him by snapping up the saloonman's words.
"Get what right? Who the hell is Tracy?"</p>

<p>"Was you longer in this country," said Burkey, "you'd know
without doubt. I'm telling you. Tade never put you boys here to
pick daisies. Let him know about Tracy or he'll take a hack outa
your hide."</p>

<p>"Tracy," said the other man, repeating the name slowly. "Seems
like I heard of him over in the Dog Rib country."</p>

<p>"He's made enough noise in Powder durin' his time to be heard
of farther off than that," answered Burkey. "Ain't anybody on the
ranch give you the McCoy about Hugh Tracy?"</p>

<p>"No," said the man. "Nobody has. We only went to work for
Shadrow a week ago. And he camped us here. All we know is to
stand around and wait for orders."</p>

<p>"Well," grunted Burkey, "you didn't hire to punch cows, did
you?"</p>

<p>The man gave him a quick, alert glance. "What we hired for is
entirely our business."</p>

<p>"You're not foolin' anybody. Antelope, knows more about this
than you do. We grew up in this grief. You only been lugged into
it as paid gulls. Don't essay any mystery."</p>

<p>"I was askin' about Tracy," grumbled the man. "What's he got
to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Right at this minute he's got everything to do with it," said
Burkey and looked down the road at Tracy's subsiding dust. "That
fellow's been gone from here the last three months. He's been
outside, in a hospital. He got a bullet right in his side one day
on account of ridin' too close to the rim."</p>

<p>"Dry-gulched?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Burkey ironically, "you do your guessin'. Anyhow,
he never knew who picked him off. Anybody but Tracy it'd killed.
So he's back, lookin' for the gun that matches the slug that hit
him&mdash;and the fellow behind it. Like I say, you better go
tell Shadrow he's here."</p>

<p>"Oh," grunted the man, lifting his eyebrows. "That's it, uh?
What's he got Shadrow wants?"</p>

<p>Burkey's answer was swift enough. "Who said anything about
that? You blamed fool, keep your thoughts inside that coco of
yours."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" said the man, and added a grinning, "Well, we're glad
to know the two is old-time friends. Still, what's this lad Tracy
got which anybody else might want?"</p>

<p>"He lives," said Burkey idly, "on a spur off Mogul down
yonder. I've heard it told the only piece of water in ten miles
is in Tracy's front yard."</p>

<p>"And how long's this been goin' on?"</p>

<p>Burkey turned into his saloon. "Well, Tracy was shot three
months ago, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>The Shadrow hand swung on his partners. "Now maybe this Tracy
sport don't know who hit him, but he sure had all the earmarks of
a fella pointed the right way. I guess I better ride along to the
ranch."</p>

<p>One of the others said: "The hell of walkin' cold into a
country, like us, is we don't never know what the rest of the
misery may be. I always heard Powder was damned full of peculiar
angles. I'd say there's more to this than so far published."</p>

<p>"You're paid well, ain't you?" asked the first hand, and went
off to his horse.</p>

<p>Tracy came out of the graveyard and followed the desert road
northward, overshadowed by Mogul's rearing face. Heat fog
deepened out on the flat, and refracting layers of hot air
trembled up from the baking earth. A small bunch of cattle lay
widely scattered.</p>

<p>"So it's good-bye Charley," he muttered. "A fine fellow and
too healthy to die of natural causes. It was a horse that piled
him or a man that piled him. And it is mighty, odd he should be
buried over on the Testervis side of that grave lot. He never'd
been a Testervis hand up till three months ago. What's happened
in this damned scope of country?"</p>

<p>He had come forty miles since daylight and was a little weary.
The gunshot scar now and then knotted the muscles of his flank,
and he found it harder to swing with the horse. Irritated by this
feeling of physical inefficiency, he remembered the time he had
racked sixty miles to Red Bridge School, danced all night, and
had ridden the same distance home. Yet as the road passed under
his feet he kept the pony to a steady lope, drawn on by the sight
of that foothill flanging out from Mogul ahead. At Twenty Mile
Rock he stopped to water at a small spring encased in a
bottomless galvanized tub; an hour afterwards he flanked the
TS&mdash; Tade Shadrow's brand&mdash;rim road climbing a fault in
Mogul's face.</p>

<p>"Better than odd," he reflected, still thinking of Charley
Sullivan, "to find him among the Testervis dead ones. Never knew
it to fail&mdash;one death in this country is sign of another.
Got to find Bill Vivian and get the news."</p>

<p>Mogul's parapet and that of Powder across the desert began to
descend gently and spread farther apart, creating a vast bay to
the yonder north. Off there the haze was gradually penetrated by
the outline of rolling hills; and directly ahead the spur toward
which he had been urging the horse all this day flung out its
foot slopes to meet him. He passed up the incline eagerly,
identifying every depression and mark. A considerable stand of
pine studded the spine of the spur. Narrow fingers of verdant
growth ran down against the sere, puma-colored bunch grass and
hardpan&mdash;unvarying sign of water in a dry land. Three
hundred feet off the desert floor, and some twelve miles from
Antelope, he entered the shade and followed a beaten trail, more
eager than he thought he ever could be. Around a bend and within
a rimming edge stood a meadow whose surface was occupied by a
frame house, a small barn, and lesser outbuildings.</p>

<p>"Home is home, in anybody's language." Then a short circle of
the path brought him full upon the yard&mdash;and all his sense
of pleasure died.</p>

<p>Around him was the mark of malicious intrusion. Of the fence
which he had so painstakingly put up one winter's month there was
now no sign except an occasional pole. The wire had been stripped
off, carried away, and the wood piled and burnt. He saw the
charred areas where the fire had been made. Prints of cattle
hoofs stood throughout the yard, and as he went forward to the
watering trough he found the surrounding ground churned to loose
mud. Something had happened in the barn, too, but his immediate
thought was for the house. Dismounting, he walked to the porch
and faced a wide open doorway, the door itself wrenched from its
hinges and standing awry against the wall. Inside, where all
things had been kept with a bachelor's neatness, was ruin. His
furniture lay overturned, the wall paper hung down in slashed
strips, marauding stock had broken his floor boards. The spoor of
cattle was all through the place. Not a single glass pane
remained undestroyed, his bunk frame was torn out of the wall. In
the kitchen he found his stove on its side, bedded in soot and
broken dishes. All the cupboard doors were open and the shelves
bare.</p>

<p>He stood in the midst of this wreckage, filled with violent
fury, big fists clenched and swinging helpless at his sides. And
it was a long interval before he stirred from his tracks, to
reach down and rescue the only thing in the place that had
apparently escaped destruction&mdash;a single white cup.
Unconsciously methodical, he righted a capsized table, laid the
cup on it, and walked slowly back to the porch. Halted there, the
lassitude of weariness and discouragement creeping like a disease
through him in spite of his actual rage, he made his
conclusions.</p>

<p>"Man that shot me came to finish the job."</p>

<p>He crossed to the west end of the porch and stared toward the
higher elevation of land where the spur made jointure with
Mogul's plateau. In that direction the glare of the down-plunging
sun rose like the red guttering of a mountain fire, and broad
bands of gold swept overhead. Thinking to himself, "In the
morning I'll trace these cattle tracks," he turned back to
unsaddle his horse; and it was then, hard on the heels of the
thought, that the still, hot peace of the ridge was broken by the
spanging echo of a rifle shot. The bullet went through the house
wall a good ten feet from him with a quick and small and crushing
sound.</p>

<p>His reaction was immediate; He dropped to the porch, rolled
rapidly, and fell off the edge. From that protecting angie he
raised his head and swept the pines and the lifted ground beyond
the rim of Mogul, over where the repercussions of the shot still
rolled out. Closely watching, he caught the quick flash of a
metal bit hidden somewhere in the rock litter, perhaps six
hundred yards removed.</p>

<p>"Won't have to wait for morning," grunted Tracy. Rising, he
made a run for his horse.</p>

<p class="first">BETWEEN porch and horse was a space of forty
yards within the marksman's direct range. Charging across the
yard, he expected a following shot to reach out after him; but
none came, and he threw himself into the saddle with a small
sense of relief. He aimed at the trees, reached this safety, and
spurred up a trail. Day's brightness slowly subsided, and the
first purple tints of twilight were filtering between the pines,
deceptively shading the thin underbrush and each hoisting fold of
the slope. He was badly stung; and when so, always reckless. Thus
he went full tilt up the trail, relying on his first judgment as
to the other man's whereabouts, not stopping until the pines
petered out into an extraordinary rocky area encircled by a wall
rising sharply some thirty feet&mdash;the topographical limit of
Mogul proper.</p>

<p>At this point he reined behind a buckbrush clump and studied
the parapet closely. The rail he now occupied reached that high
ground via a fissure, but he rejected the approach, knowing the
marksman was somewhere within shouting distance of the spot. The
only other way of getting on top of the rim was by a fan-shaped
causeway of rubble about a hundred yards ahead. Swinging his
horse, he raced for it.</p>

<p>It exposed him again. Riding well over in the saddle, he
watched the parapet jealously, and when he hit the foot of the
causeway it was with spurs biting in, to reach the rim's top at a
rush. Nothing stood in front of him. Mogul's sweep of plateau was
bare as far as he could see; yet the next moment he fell from the
saddle and started off on the run, revolver lifted. The ambushing
party, he thought savagely, was waiting for another try, and
should be accommodated. Throwing himself into a gully, he
followed it quite a distance and rose behind a rock cone. Powder
desert lay far below, and his own house was in sight. Halted, he
thought he heard the stir of a body beyond the cone.</p>

<p>His answer was to reach for a small rock, throw it to the
right of the cone and himself lunge around the left side,
revolver risen again. What he saw so shocked him that the weapon
sagged in his fist. A woman stood there&mdash;a woman not long
out of girlhood. She had a rifle in her arms, a rifle swinging
around to cover him. Behind the lined sights were the most alive
and interesting gray-blue eyes Hugh Tracy had ever
seen&mdash;crowded now by an enormous anger. She said nothing at
all, but he knew purpose when he met it, and he guessed that the
small white finger resting on the trigger had squeezed out most
of the slack. Motionless, he drawled a quiet phrase:</p>

<p>"If you can't find horns on the beast, it ain't legal to shoot
him."</p>

<p>Her reply was a quick shift of her head. She lifted her eyes
from the sights, caught his face. Next moment the rifle fell
away. A queer rush of breath came from her throat, a faint and
startled, "Oh!" A widening glance swept him head and foot. "Were
you down at that house when&mdash;when I fired?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"Exactly. Now, do you locate any antlers on me?"</p>

<p>She shook her head with the air of not hearing him. Color went
from her clear cheeks and came back again to stain them more
deeply. Her eyes, remarkably direct and honest, met his return
inspection.</p>

<p>"Would you believe me," she asked swiftly, "if I said I had no
intention of hitting you?"</p>

<p>"I have been shot at before," said Hugh cheerfully, "but not
by women, as a rule. Certainly I believe you. What's this all
about?"</p>

<p>"No," she broke in, holding steadily to her point. "You don't
understand yet what I mean. Supposing you were the man I thought
was down there. Would you believe I hadn't shot to kill
you&mdash;but only to warn?"</p>

<p>"The bullet hit ten feet to one side," said Tracy. "Are you a
good enough shot to miss deliberately?"</p>

<p>"The bullet struck where I wanted it to," retorted the
girl.</p>

<p>"But I wasn't the right man?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Tracy said: "That's different."</p>

<p>"What are you thinking?"</p>

<p>"That the rest of this affair is entirely none of my
business."</p>

<p>Her lips tightened, and he saw a quicker breathing disturb her
breasts. "You are wrong," said she, throwing the contradiction at
him.</p>

<p>"About it being none of my business?"</p>

<p>"No. About the reason why you thought it was none of your
business."</p>

<p>That frankness astonished him. The grave, weighing glance
clung to him without confusion; and in the interval Hugh Tracy
was warmed by an agreeable discovery. This girl was close to
being a beauty. He had at first, misled by the rough commonness
of the man's clothing she wore, thought her unprepossessing. With
the leisure to observe, he was aware of a fine and rounded
modeling of body, a lithe strength apparent in her carriage. She
was straight and slim and poised. A shaggy man's shirt, open, at
the throat, showed the graceful swell of shoulder and breasts.
The coloring of her eyes, accented by the low-slung brim of her
hat, created one long shadow across a face slightly triangular.
All the feminine softness was there, but made oddly striking by
small, high cheekbones, and by the further symmetrical contour of
neck and temple. Edges of ash-blonde hair showed beneath the hat.
So much for physical outlines; yet beyond these swiftly
registered impressions was a far stronger one of alertness and
vitality.</p>

<p>She disturbed him with another short, direct question:</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do next?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Hugh, "except go home and forget it."</p>

<p>She shook her head, faint humor in her lip corners.</p>

<p>"You won't. You'll never quit wondering. Well, you've got
something coming to you by way of amend. Go ahead&mdash;ask
it."</p>

<p>"No. I still insist it is your business. But look here. I have
lived around the Powder a considerable number of years without
noticing anybody of your description. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Lynn Isherwood. Do you know any more about me now?"</p>

<p>He thought about it, shook his head. "Closest Isherwoods I
know live away over in Malheur country."</p>

<p>"No relation. My branch lived in Nevada."</p>

<p>"Visiting here?"</p>

<p>"Staying here," said the girl, with a sort of breathless
emphasis.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>She didn't answer immediately, but slowly pivoted on her heels
and looked down at his ranch lying beneath the gathered twilight.
Powder desert shifted to a blue, limitless gulf, and Powder rim
across the flat stood in this brief hour with every gigantic
embattlement dripping cobalt color. First evening's cool came
gently out of the west; the jagged edges of the broken ground
around them slowly took on the shape of night. The girl swung
back, definite features marred by a faint erasure of
wistfulness.</p>

<p>"I think I had better not tell you where I live."</p>

<p>He lifted his palms in a gesture of resignation, and the girl
spoke again.</p>

<p>"That's the second time you haven't pressed the point. Thank
you."</p>

<p>"In this case," drawled Hugh, "I will not suppress the
curiosity as a gentleman should. If you are staying in the
Powder, my secret agents will find out where."</p>

<p>"Better if you didn't," she warned him. "Isn't it my turn now?
Who are you?"</p>

<p>"To wit: Hugh Tracy, owner of that yonder piece of land on
which you plunked a shot."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;!" exclaimed the girl, jerking up her chin. It was
half dark now, and he thought that was her reason for stepping a
pace closer. But the light of her glance was so quick and alive
that he guessed another reason. He drawled:</p>

<p>"I'm the wolf with the long teeth that folks tell the little
girl about, to be certain she stays in bed."</p>

<p>"I have heard of you," admitted Lynn Isherwood.</p>

<p>"But not from folks who would know much good of me."</p>

<p>"I have heard about you from almost every man or woman I know
or have met since I came here," said she. After a short pause,
she went on: "Disregarding the weather, I guess you are the
staple of conversation in this country."</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy's chuckle was dry, ironic. "I just aggravate some
people."</p>

<p>"Yes? I think I know why&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"No. But do you know how I had you pictured, hearing all these
things said?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I'm a fellow with a granite face&mdash;a black,
beetling mug. When I laugh, it's like a file goin' the wrong way
across a saw. I possess neither charity, faith, nor hope, and I
have wrecked more barrooms than Carrie Nation, for different
cause. The things I do make no sense to the citizens, and they
have ceased to figure why any more. I fight for the pleasure of
it. I'm too restless to stay on a job any given length of time.
If there is ever any trouble around Powder, the first thing folks
want to know is, where was Hugh Tracy? That's the picture you
had."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes," said Lynn Isherwood, showing surprise. "How
could you know?"</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"That is half of the picture. What is the other half?"</p>

<p>"Isn't any."</p>

<p>She watched him for a long while, and he saw her lips purse. A
piece of a smile came to her face. "Just as well, then, that you
think so."</p>

<p>"It's dark," said Hugh. "You'd better get on the road to
home."</p>

<p>She turned away and climbed out of the depression,
disappearing in another. When she reappeared she was asaddle, and
she halted some fifty feet from him with a small, gay laugh
falling across the dark. "If I came nearer, you'd read this
pony's brand and know where I belonged."</p>

<p>"I will know soon enough."</p>

<p>"Hugh Tracy&mdash;don't find me. Please don't."</p>

<p>This time he refused to let the statement ride. "Is there any
good reason why I shouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Trouble."</p>

<p>"Who for?"</p>

<p>"You," said she, reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Good-night," said Hugh. "And if you are crossin' this Mogul
plateau, don't leave the beaten road at any time. You'd get lost
in a minute. Not only that but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You've heard enough wolf stories," said he.</p>

<p>"All right," answered Lynn Isherwood. "I know what you mean.
Remember, I have lived in this sort of country all my
life&mdash;in Nevada. Thanks again, for not asking me what you
wanted to ask. And, by the way, there is another side of the Hugh
Tracy controversy. I have heard all of it, and I know. Good-
night."</p>

<p>He watched her until she vanished behind the screen of
darkness. Long after, when the last clacking echo of her pony
dimmed in the south, he went to his own horse and rode homeward.
Making a quiet survey of the yard, he spread his blankets in the
wrecked house. He had not eaten since breakfast, and his bones
ached with that weariness which fights off sleep. Lying face
upward to the black ceiling, he realized he would never be able
to light a lamp inside his house until Powder country had changed
its appointed ways&mdash;and until he had met a man.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3. &mdash; REACH OF THE
OCTOPUS</h2>

<p class="first">ON MOGUL'S vast plateau, eleven miles southwest
of Hugh Tracy's place as the road runs, lay Tade Shadrow's home
ranch&mdash;nerve center of eighty thousand owned acres and of
twice as much government free range. That most of the TS had been
fraudulently acquired was common knowledge; that the threat of
Shadrow's power kept others from grazing their cattle on the free
range within his orbit of influence was always crystal clear.
This sort of ruthless and efficient acquisition was too generally
accepted in the West to be considered a sin, except by the
injured parties. These, Shadrow had ample means of hushing. It
was a land of big outfits&mdash;being too dry for the small
nester&mdash; and all of them played the same jealous, watchful
game, asking only that the law let them alone in their
fighting.</p>

<p>TS home quarters was a depressing place, without a tree to
shade it and without a single grace to redeem the squat ugliness
of its sunbeaten, paintless, frowsy buildings. During the
beginning and end of seasons enough men passed through it to vote
the county any given way, as Shadrow very shrewdly understood,
but otherwise TS riders roamed far out and headquarters huddled
somnolent and dreary under the sun. One dusty road led along a
tangle of corrals and barns to a plaza, around which stood the
sheds, the shops, the store, the bunkhouses, the mess hall.
Exactly at such an angle in this plaza as to command every point
of activity sat the main house&mdash;a long, low structure
galleried on three sides. Tade Shadrow's office ran the length of
the house of the front side, and here he sat at present, doing
what he had often done before and doing it very well&mdash;firing
a hand.</p>

<p>The hand stood in the middle of the room, hat crushed in one
hand; a lank young man with agate-green eyes and a raw red face
flushed to deeper crimson by a stubborn anger not altogether
unmixed with worry. Shadrow was in a chair behind his desk, badly
aged at sixty. Worth a fortune, he showed the unkempt condition
of a twenty-dollar hand. His suit was shabby, wrinkled; his white
shirt looked to have been slept in. He was smallish and scrawny,
and his head, the only well-developed part of him, hung forward
on a thin neck. Beneath an utterly hairless crown was a face
infinitely lined&mdash;shrewd with an animal shrewdness. A
straggling sorrel mustache guarded thin lips made thinner by
pressure; a nose, narrow and long, swooped out from between
close-placed eyes. In those eyes was the only visible sign of
remaining vigor. Dark and half-lidded, they burned with an
intense energy. And it was evident that, as much as the hand
disliked the scene, old Tade Shadrow enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"When I hire a man," said he in a grumbling, singsong voice,
"I hire him to do like I say."</p>

<p>"I rode that line," said the hand, doggedly. "I was there all
the time."</p>

<p>"Looky here, Bones, don't contradict <i>me!</i> You was seen
two nights ago way to hell and gone over in Testervis country.
Ain't that right, Tolbert? Wasn't he seen?"</p>

<p>Bones shifted and looked around at the third man in the room,
who was the TS foreman. Inordinately tall and shackle-jointed,
Tolbert's face was hard and smooth and expressionless. All he did
now was slightly nod.</p>

<p>"You bet he was," said Tade Shadrow.</p>

<p>"Never denied it, did I?" retorted Bones. "I was chasin'
strays like I told you."</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;strays thirteen miles north of you!" ridiculed
Shadrow. "It won't work."</p>

<p>Bones flared up. "You and your damned job can go take a
runnin' leap in the ocean. Pay me off and I'm glad to shake the
dust of this penny-pinchin', haywire, louse-bound outfit from my
feet! I wouldn't work no more for an old scoundrel like you if I
starved!"</p>

<p>Shadrow looked over to his foreman, slyly amused. "Hard, ain't
he? Well, Bones, I've seen harder mugs and I've fired 'em, too.
You know what I think? I think you're too crooked for me, that's
what. Any hand that takes TS money and goes driftin' towards the
Testervis boys will bear watchin'. It's lucky for you I don't
ride you out of my yard on a pole."</p>

<p>"Give me my pay," muttered Bones.</p>

<p>"You'll get it," grurnbled Shadrow, and reached for his work
ledger. When he turned the pages, his face assumed a pinched
expression. "You been here," he said reluctantly, "six
months."</p>

<p>"Seven," contradicted Bones, wary-eyed.</p>

<p>"Dammit!" shouted Shadrow, slamming the flat of his hand on
the table. "I said six! Here it is in the books! Stand there and
try to beat me out of a month's pay, will you?"</p>

<p>Bones stirred, looked again at the foreman so quiet and still
behind him. "All right," he said, wearily, "let it ride as
six."</p>

<p>"Store bill," mused Shadrow, following his tracing finger, "is
a hundred and eight dollars and ninety-seven cents."</p>

<p>Bones walked forward, holding out his hand. "Something wrong
there. Let me see that book."</p>

<p>Shadrow closed the ledger and put his hand across it, erupting
again. "Bones, by the forked tail of old Billy, I'll stand no
more from you! It looks to me like you're huntin' trouble, and
I'm tellin' you this is a mighty good place to get it!"</p>

<p>Bones halted. "That store of yours is so rotten it stinks.
Three prices for everything and none of it fit to carry off. I
never bought that much, I'm tellin' you."</p>

<p>"And thirty dollars you borrowed a couple months ago," said
Shadrow rapidly, "which leaves forty-one, naught three." He
reached for a slip of paper and held it toward Bones. "There's
your check for forty-one dollars even. The three cents ain't of
any account to you."</p>

<p>Bones seized the check, stared at it. He put it in his pocket,
big fist having trouble getting out again. Without a word&mdash;
Tolbert and Shadrow watching him closely&mdash;he went to the
door. In the opening he swung swiftly about.</p>

<p>"Shadrow, you never did an honest lick in your life," he
yelled, bitterly outraged. "And you've done cheated me by a good
eighty dollars! You miserable skinflint, that'll come floatin'
home to you one day! Mark my word!" He threw himself backward,
and a little later the two men heard him drum out of the
yard.</p>

<p>Shadrow emitted a dry, pleased chuckle and settled in the
chair. "Hey, Tolbert? Ain't that the way to do it? They holler,
but it don't help 'em none. Saved the price of two good steers on
that fellow."</p>

<p>Lake Tolbert moved away from the wall and sat down, long legs
folding up in front of him. He shifted his chew to let out a
taciturn phrase. "He'll go to the Testervis side."</p>

<p>"No, he won't," contradicted Shadrow. "The Testervis boys
wouldn't hire a man who had worked for me."</p>

<p>The foreman only said: "He'll essay to get his eighty dollars
somehow."</p>

<p>"Of course he will," agreed Shadrow. "That's why I sent for
Sid Maunders. Ain't he here yet?"</p>

<p>Tolbert shook his head, whereat Shadrow drummed his knuckles
impatiently on the desk top and fell to grumbling. "There's
another gentleman getting mighty fancy. He takes his own good
time comin' on my call. Independent as a hog on ice. One of these
bright days I'll have to knock his ears back and run him
off."</p>

<p>"You won't," was the foreman's impassive answer.</p>

<p>"No?" growled Shadrow, irritable again. He stared at Tolbert,
sly and knowing glance sliding over the other's blank cheeks.
"Why won't I?"</p>

<p>Tolbert said nothing, and Shadrow's lip corners went downward.
"I know men. He'd cut my throat if he could. For that matter
there ain't a hand on this ranch who wouldn't steal from me. Not
a one, Tolbert."</p>

<p>"Leave me out of that," murmured Tolbert.</p>

<p>Shadrow's glance sharpened. "I wonder. I'd give a lot to know
what's goin' on inside that head of yours. Nobody can read your
face."</p>

<p>"Do what you want, don't I? Fetch and carry. Back you up. Keep
my mouth shut about what I know."</p>

<p>The cataloguing of these virtues seemed to bother Shadrow.
"Never mind," he grunted. "I ain't quarrelin' with you."</p>

<p>The clatter of a pony's hoofs beat across the hard-packed
yard, and a deep, surly voice said: "Stop fiddlin' or I'll saw
your confounded jaws apart. I don't like this starvation stop no
more'n you do." Lake Tolbert's steady stare met Shadrow's eyes
and appeared to indicate something. The light coming through the
doorway was blocked off by a body almost square from shoulder to
hip. Two heavy, hair-felted wrists clung to a blackened belt. A
columnar neck rose straight to small, flat ears, and beneath the
flare of a low-crowned hat was a broad face studded by two dull
and insolent eyes.</p>

<p>"Broke both legs gettin' here," grumbled Shadrow, sarcasm
edging the words.</p>

<p>"If I don't suit, hire another man," retorted Maunders, as
acid as his chief.</p>

<p>Shadrow's big head shot forward. Across the usually petulant
countenance sprang a cold, feral expression. It changed him so
much that both other men turned alert. "This," said Shadrow, "may
be a desolation stop to you, Mister Maunders, and your good time
may be too important to waste on a ranch which pays you wages
nowise in keeping with your undoubted worth. Nevertheless, when I
call you, come. There is no wall-eyed, jug-headed son of a
biscuit around here as can teach me to suck eggs. That applies to
you, Mister Maunders."</p>

<p>The tongue-lashing took Maunders aback. He threw an astonished
side glance at the foreman, then said, less boldly: "Well, I'm
here, ain't I?"</p>

<p>Shadrow moved around in his chair, fell to rapping out a
rhythm on the desk with his fingers. "But not for long. I fired
Willy Bones a minute ago."</p>

<p>Maunders looked a question.</p>

<p>"He considers himself grieved," Shadrow went on, "and like all
other damn fools he'll essay to steal beef off me. There's too
much of that among the riders of this ranch, and it is high time
they had an example set."</p>

<p>Silence came, broken only by Shadrow's drumming on the desk.
All the hatchet sharpness of his face appeared in strong relief,
and his eyes burned brilliantly. Maunders stood still, not
shifting his attention. Tolbert tipped his head to the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"Bones will go right for the piece of country he knows
best&mdash; back of Antelope, where Mogul feeds off towards Two
Spot Butte. Ride now so you can get planted when he gets there.
If he don't do anything, follow him till he does."</p>

<p>Lake Tolbert brought his head down to Shadrow, small hard
lines springing around the noncommittal eyes; and as the three
confronted one another, Willy Bones's fate was sealed beyond a
doubt. Once more it was Shadrow who broke the spell, lifting an
impatient hand. "Get goin', Sid."</p>

<p>"Write me out a requisition on the store for grub."</p>

<p>Instantly Shadrow turned querulous. "Can't you turn around
without wantin' somethin'? You left here last time with ten days'
provisions and you was only gone a week. Where's the other three
days' stuff?"</p>

<p>"Gave it to a Testervis hand I found hungry," said Maunders,
ironically. "Listen, Shadrow, I don't see why in thunder you got
me and Tolbert on your payroll at all, considerin' how you pick
at us."</p>

<p>It seemed to strike Shadrow as being funny, for he grinned and
let out a squeaky "he-he." He looked at the big gunman. "Don't
you know? Tolbert's to keep you honest and you're to see Tolbert
don't double-cross me." Still chuckling, he reached for his
pencil and a slip of paper. The other two swapped quick glances,
and then Maunders said, "Add a couple boxes of shells to that
requisition."</p>

<p>"Another dollar fifty," muttered Shadrow, bowed over his
pencil. "What in nation do you do with all that lead?"</p>

<p>"Use it on company business."</p>

<p>Shadrow reared back. "That reminds me. Hugh Tracy come home
yesterday."</p>

<p>The effect on Maunders was to drag him out of his imbedded
stolidity. Brighter light quickened the dull eyes, the flat-
featured face lengthened in astonishment. He hauled himself
erect, shot a swift question at Shadrow. "Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. At his ranch, maybe."</p>

<p>"And you send me sashayin' off after Willy Bones when this
Tracy is around?" demanded Maunders. "What's the matter with your
head?"</p>

<p>"If you had my head," snapped Shadrow, "you'd be rich."</p>

<p>"Well," insisted Maunders, "what are you goin' to do about it?
Leave him run loose?"</p>

<p>"That's best, for now."</p>

<p>"Not to my mind," countered Maunders. "I'm the fellow
who&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Who takes orders," finished Shadrow. "Here's your
requisition. And on second thought maybe you had ought to
practise hittin' somethin' for a change. Tolbert, where you
goin'?"</p>

<p>The foreman had risen and turned to the door. "Ain't you
finished?"</p>

<p>"No," said Shadrow. "I've got something serious to say to the
both of you. We've been snoozin' long enough. I ain't had a word
for three days as to what the Testervis boys are doin'. Can't
seem to find out. If it was only Bat in charge I wouldn't worry a
minute, for he ain't got brains to do anything but fight. But
Morgan's so condemned pious he might think of any sort of trick.
I don't propose to be caught with my suspenders droopin', you
hear me? So listen. We shift a crew of men northward. Take care
of it, Tolbert. About thirty men. Do it tonight, after dark. See
that the outfit floats pretty close to the Testervis
line&mdash;back of Tracy's five or six miles. And stay there. You
may not know it, but this business is about ready for
boilin'."</p>

<p>Tolbert said, "All right," without inflection and swung into
the doorway again. But Maunders stood fast, shaking his head. "I
don't see&mdash;" he began, and was stopped by the foreman who,
swinging sharply back from the porch, motioned rapidly with one
arm.</p>

<p>"Speakin' of Tracy, he's comin' down the road." Maunders
wheeled completely around, ripped out an oath. Shadrow rose from
his chair and for the first time showed concern. "Who's with
him?"</p>

<p>"Nobody."</p>

<p>"Here," said Shadrow, snapping his fingers anxiously at the
foreman, "you stand where you was when Bones come in. Maunders,
go to that far corner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not now," contradicted Maunders. "I don't want to meet him in
here. Too close quarters. I'll go out back and wait in the
yard."</p>

<p>"He's a damned fool for comin' to TS alone," grunted Shadrow.
"Tolbert, if you see him make any move, stop it."</p>

<p>The tall foreman stood against the wall, coldly quiet, looking
at the two others with the faintest expression or contempt
visible in the veiled eyes. Shadrow sat down again and took to
twisting his pencil between his fingers; Maunders, sullen
hostility written over his flat face, slowly backed to an inner
door and opened it. All of them heard Tracy drum across the yard
and dismount on the porch. "I'll do all the talkin'," said
Shadrow in a sibilant undertone.</p>

<p>"Do that," drawled Tolbert, so queerly that Shadrow's glance
whipped back to the foreman and clung there a long moment. But he
had no chance to speak, for as Sid Maunders retreated through the
inner door and softly closed it, Hugh Tracy entered from the
porch.</p>

<p>Halted there, Hugh instantly understood that he walked into an
arranged scene. The click of the inner door warned him, Lake
Tolbert was rigid against the wall, and Shadrow's position behind
the table showed strain. The eyes of the TS owner, full of sly
calculation, gave the lie to his friendly greeting.</p>

<p>"Hugh, it's like old times to see you here. Sit down."</p>

<p>"I'll stand," was Hugh's dry answer, and he walked across the
room and turned to better command these two men posted on his
flanks. He inclined his head at Tolbert, realizing clearly the
purpose of the foreman's presence. A floor board in an adjoining
room squealed under pressure; Shadrow broke into sudden talk.</p>

<p>"So the old hell-raisin' Hugh is among us again! I'll say,
though, that you appear a little peaked to me."</p>

<p>"Such personal interest moves me deeply," drawled Hugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, go on! Can't you never take a man's word for what it's
worth? You make a heap of enemies thataway, Hugh. Too confounded
skeptical. Always lookin' at the teeth of the horse."</p>

<p>"And so do you."</p>

<p>Shadrow grinned his wry, knowing grin. "Havin' money,
everybody tries to make a sucker outa me. But I guess I've sold
as many bum critters as I've bought." Tracy nodded, reaching for
his cigarette articles, The black head went thoughtfully downward
during the manufacturing of the smoke, and the broad, blunt
fighter's features remained inscrutably grave. Shadrow, never
liking these deadlocked silences, fiddled a little and winked at
Tolbert. "Well, Hugh, what's on your mind?"</p>

<p>Tracy held the completed smoke in one hand and stared at
Shadrow. "Tade, what do you know about the wreckin' of my
place?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing," said Shadrow, promptly. "Not a blessed thing.
Some of the boys passed that way and saw it, and told me. I'm
mighty sorry, Hugh. It don't seem right to hit a man when he's
down."</p>

<p>"I observe cattle tracks leadin' back from my water trough
this way."</p>

<p>"That's another story," said Shadrow. "I won't deny some of my
stock might've drifted yonder and used your water, the fence
being down. But I will say that I figured you wouldn't like it,
so I had the boys move such critters as was over there farther
west."</p>

<p>"That was kind," murmured Hugh. He lighted his cigarette,
studying Shadrow over the burning match tip.</p>

<p>Shadrow grunted, tapping on the table again.</p>

<p>"Hugh, now that you're back what's up? Can't make any money on
that ranch. You never did use it for anything but a place to
sleep on occasionally. Want a job?"</p>

<p>"Doin' what?"</p>

<p>Shadrow's seamed cheeks displayed a little eagerness. "Write
your own ticket. I'd rather have you on my payroll than any other
man."</p>

<p>Hugh looked at Tolbert and said, amused, "That's no compliment
to you, Lake."</p>

<p>Tolbert shifted his tobacco. "Accustomed to it by now."</p>

<p>"Leave Lake out of it," broke in the TS owner. "He's my
shadow. Write your own ticket."</p>

<p>Hugh spoke straight from the shoulder. "You know damned well I
never would work for you. And you know exactly why. So what's the
reason for this mealy-mouthed offer?"</p>

<p>Shadrow's visage turned ironic and shrewd. "You never heard me
ask any man to believe I did anything out of charity. I got my
reasons for everything. Your privilege to figure there's a nigger
in the woodpile. But you've got some chores to take care of,
ain't you? That bein' so, you'll find it easier to do them
wearin' a TS brand&mdash;with TS support behind you."</p>

<p>"What chores?"</p>

<p>"Don't make a dummy out of me," grunted Shadrow. "You ain't
goin' to have no luck startin' a private war. Throw in with me
and I'll back you up on every play."</p>

<p>"Which means you figure I'm after somebody on the Testervis
side."</p>

<p>"I didn't strip your place," said Shadrow.</p>

<p>"The offer is no good."</p>

<p>Shadrow squirmed in his chair and scowled. After a period of
fretful silence he threw up his head. "All right. I make you
another proposition. I'll buy your place."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Wish you'd quit turnin' over boards to find the bugs
underneath," grumbled Shadrow. "Don't you know why?"</p>

<p>"I've been away three months."</p>

<p>"Well, a lot's happened since then, Hugh. Right out, I'll tell
you I could use the water you got."</p>

<p>"Sorry, not selling."</p>

<p>"That makes you out a fool," stated Shadrow, rising. "You
won't be able to hold on. Somebody's going to get that water,
whether you like it or not&mdash;and it might as well be me."</p>

<p>"Threat?"</p>

<p>"Hell, ain't I offerin' to pay for it?"</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy dropped the cigarette and ground it beneath a heel.
He spoke coolly: "You're sayin' either you get it or the
Testervis boys get it. I thought something like that, but I
wanted to hear it straight. As far as you are concerned, you know
what you can do."</p>

<p>"You're mad about it, not me," said Shadrow. "I made two
straight propositions. Now I'll say this: There is going to be a
fight in the Powder before thirty days is up. You've got to be on
one side or the other&mdash;no straddlin'. And if you don't pick
the right side, you ain't goin' to have any water. That is no
threat. That's fact."</p>

<p>"You must want it pretty bad to offer to pay for it."</p>

<p>"I do," said Shadrow. "Cheapest way to get a thing is the way
I want to get it. In this case it is cheaper to buy than to
fight."</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy's square face chilled. "There is nothing I despise
more than being told what I've got to do. I won't stand for it,
Shadrow. Somebody tried to knock me over and didn't. Maybe it was
a private affair and maybe it was just a part of this water
business. I don't know, but I came back to find out. I'll find
out, too. Nobody can hide his hand forever. And when I do, I'll
do some shootin' on my own account."</p>

<p>"I didn't strip your place," Shadrow said again.</p>

<p>"For the time bein', we'll let it stand like that," replied
Hugh.</p>

<p>"Nothin' stands as is," observed Shadrow sententiously. "But
don't overestimate your strength. You're a white chip in a no-
limit game."</p>

<p>Tracy didn't answer. Crossing the room, he walked to the
porch. Shadrow made a surreptitious gesture at Tolbert and
followed; and as Tracy reached his horse, the foreman also left
the office and started slowly across the yard.</p>

<p>"My propositions stand&mdash;for a while," said Shadrow.</p>

<p>"You're talking to the wrong man," answered Hugh Tracy; and
observing the foreman's move, he added quietly: "You know I can
fight, Shadrow." Then he reined around and aimed into the mouth
of the plaza. But he hadn't done a dozen yards before his wrist
snapped a quick pressure on the reins. The blackness of sudden
storm swept along his face, and the big body reared stiff in the
saddle. Sid Maunders, lounging against a tool shed, faced him.
Without looking around, he knew how completely he was cross-
trapped. Shadrow was directly behind, Tolbert on his flank,
Maunders in front.</p>

<p>"Come back, if you change your mind," called Shadrow, plain
mockery in his words.</p>

<p>Maunders's fun, flat-planed face glistened in the sunlight,
and the opaque eyes clung steadily to Tracy: He was set, on a
trigger tension, ready to react to the slightest warning.
Expelling a breath, Tracy loosened the reins and rode by the
gunman&mdash;out of the plaza and down the dusty road.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER 4. &mdash; TURN OF THE SCREW</h2>

<p class="first">HUGH TRACY'S anger was of the slow-burning sort.
Restless, skeptical, perplexed by a world in which he saw no
plan, he clung the more rigidly to those few convictions he had.
More than anybody else he understood that force was the universal
instrument in this country, the court of first instance and last
resort. Born and raised between the shadows of the two rearing
rims, no man more clearly understood the dominating philosophy of
the Powder desert. Yet the least hint of force applied in his
direction was a chemical that produced explosion. And now,
turning off the road and heading northerly homeward, his
rebellious, unyielding temper reached a torch heat. Tade Shadrow
had made a threat. Strip aside the vague blind of friendliness,
the sly and evasive advice&mdash;it was nothing but a threat.</p>

<p>Nor was it spiritual balm to realize that maneuvering him into
a strategically weak location in the yard, those three men had
thrown a fight in his face which he had been forced to
refuse.</p>

<p>He was almost to his own ranch line before the full
significance of that situation dawned on him. Obviously they were
prepared to find him full of trouble. Preparedness meant,
stripped down to the bare fact, fear. Fear of what, if not
retaliation on his part for something they had done? According to
that reasoning it was Tade Shadrow who had ordered the wrecking
of his place; and since the act was but an after effect of his
ambush, it followed Shadrow must have ordered the ambush too.</p>

<p>He struck his palm against the saddle so hard that the pony
jumped. "But I will never be sure," he muttered. "It's done and
over, covered up. All I can do is wait for a second try. It will
come, sure enough. It's a game of waiting, with me on the wrong
end."</p>

<p>One thing was certain: Powder desert, cockpit of dark
antagonisms, was humming with the invisible warnings of another
storm on the make. The days of surety and idle riding were gone.
Once the sharp cleavage of faction was established, not one
living soul in the country might say he was safe. So it had
always been. That was feud. Thus thinking, he passed down the
alley between pines and came out into his yard. Lynn Isherwood
stood on the porch, waiting for him. "Had you stayed away another
hour or so," she called, "I might have gotten something
done."</p>

<p>Hugh chuckled, serenity unexpectedly returning to him.
"Where's your rifle?"</p>

<p>"Hanging on the saddle of my horse."</p>

<p>He looked around. "So? Well, where's the horse?"</p>

<p>"In your barn, where it won't attract the inquisitive
eye."</p>

<p>"Good girl!" he approved. "You know things."</p>

<p>"I was raised in the sagebrush. Should know something."</p>

<p>She was without a jacket this day, and the sleeves of her
man's shirt were rolled up, exposing strong white arms in keeping
with the slim, supple fingers. The ash-blonde hair was pulled
back on her hatless head and up from her ears, disciplined by a
tight knot in the rear. One smudge lay on a face flushed deeper
than usual. The sober shadow he had noticed across her eyes the
previous night was gone.</p>

<p>"Come inside and have a look. No matter what I did, I couldn't
make it worse than it was."</p>

<p>He stepped to the porch and followed her through, stopping in
surprise. He had not bothered, on rising that morning, to put
things in shape. So all the orderliness confronting him was of
her making. She had swept out the rooms, straightened the
furniture; she had even pasted up the ripped wall paper and
nailed back the frame of his bunk, upon which his blankets had
been tucked and folded. Following her into the kitchen, the first
thing he saw was the righted stove. That moved him to immediate
question:</p>

<p>"How in thunder did you manage that?"</p>

<p>"Me and a two by four. And a piece of wood for a fulcrum.
That's a good oven. I made a mess of biscuits in it."</p>

<p>"What with? All I could find around here this morning was a
slab of bacon buried in the soot, and half a can of coffee."</p>

<p>He had never seen her laugh before. It changed the light of
her eyes completely, made the clear and sharp face boyishly
frank. "There's a story in that I won't mention now. It's noon,
isn't it? I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Hugh.</p>

<p>She turned back to him and sat on the table's edge, one leg
swinging; sobered again and watching his face.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"My manner of making apologies for shooting at you," she
said.</p>

<p>"Trouble for you."</p>

<p>"If I like to do it, why complain?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. And it was entirely natural for him to say:
"Lynn, don't let yourself in for anything."</p>

<p>The features of this girl were adaptable, quick-changing. She
studied him, the straight glance clouded and touched by a half-
startled expression. Sliding off the table, she swung toward the
stove, answering over her slim shoulders, "Whatever I do, I don't
regret. Perhaps I have also lived a little rough-and-tumble,
Hugh. I can take care of myself. You saw me do it once, didn't
you? Anyhow, we're going to have bacon and biscuits."</p>

<p>He turned and strolled outside, feeling some queer shift in
himself. Whoever she was, wherever she came from, she colored her
surroundings unmistakably. The challenge of her personality was
direct and disturbing. Puzzled why this should be so, he heard
her calling him back, and when he reached the kitchen he found
she had in that short space of time produced a dinner of bacon
and eggs, biscuits and coffee. The eggs brought him to a full
halt.</p>

<p>"More mystery," said Lynn. "The less you ask about those eggs
the better you'll like 'em."</p>

<p>There was no more talk for a time. They were both hungry and
not ashamed to show it. But when the edge was off his appetite,
he leaned back. "Resuming from where we stopped," said he, very
slowly, "I'll have to say you are doing yourself no good being
seen with me. From now on nobody in this country can afford to be
a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>He looked curiously at her. "I doubt if you do."</p>

<p>She leaned forward, putting her elbows on the table and
cupping her chin between raised palms. "But I do. I could tell
you something this minute, Hugh, that would make you flaming
angry."</p>

<p>"Know about my temper, do you?"</p>

<p>"In the Antelope Hotel I saw the door you flung Bart Neal
through."</p>

<p>"The worst of a man lives longest. All right. Then you know.
Why risk coming here?"</p>

<p>"I gave you one reason&mdash;to make my apologies. Never press
a woman for the literal truth."</p>

<p>He chuckled, big shoulders rising and squaring; amused lines
formed around his mouth. "I'm not a good influence on little
girls, Lynn. I don't believe in Santy Claus any more."</p>

<p>"You believe in many other things."</p>

<p>"Not enough. Not nearly enough. I've had a lot knocked out of
me, and some pretty hard wisdom driven into me. If you fished
around you wouldn't find such a lot."</p>

<p>"Troubled waters," said she, gray-blue eyes narrowing
speculatively, "always make good fishing." They were finished and
she got up, clearing the table. Slack in the chair, heavy fists
lying loose before him, he watched her move gracefully and
efficiently about the room. Thoughtfully silent, he curled a
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Lynn, I'd like sometime to see you dressed as a woman."</p>

<p>She turned completely about, hands wet from dish water, and he
thought it strange to find somberness deepening the light of her
glance. "Must you think of me that way?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Hugh Tracy, almost rough with the words. "No
other way. And you'd be the last to want it any other way."</p>

<p>She dried her hands across her shirt front; her small square
shoulders lifted in a slight shrug. "Maybe not." She moved by
him, out to the porch. Following, he found her watching Mogul's
rim with a troubled brow. "I was afraid of that, Hugh," she said.
"I debated it before coming&mdash;and took the chance. But we'll
swear off right here."</p>

<p>"What are you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"Not of you. I'd never be afraid of you. It's something else.
Will you get my horse?"</p>

<p>He walked to the barn, led back a small paint pony; and when
he turned it in front of her he was broadly grinning, "So you
picked a horse that didn't have a Powder country brand on
it?"</p>

<p>She reached the saddle and smiled down at him. "I told you
once I didn't want you to know where I live. I am practised in
deceit, So-long, Hugh. It was nice here&mdash;but I won't be
coming back."</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy shook his head. "That sounds like an ending. But of
the few hard lessons I have learned, this is one: Nothing ever
ends."</p>

<p>"A fighter and a philosopher," mused the girl.</p>

<p>"Buckshot philosophy."</p>

<p>She leaned over, troubled and grave; one slim hand touched his
shoulder. "They say you never avoid a fight&mdash;that you are
too lucky to kill. For the next few weeks I hope with all my
heart the first thing is wrong and the second right."</p>

<p>"So-long till next time."</p>

<p>Gathering the reins, she murmured, "There must not be a next
time," and spurred toward the trees, Slouched against the porch
wall, he watched her straight, fine torso sway to the rhythm of
the horse and at last vanish behind the pines. He dropped his
cigarette in the dust and, climbing to his own saddle, turned up
the slope to the north-west, bound for the Testervis ranch to ask
the same question he had asked of Tade Shadrow. As he traveled,
he had a premonition that suspended events were about to come
crashing down around him. The very air held that surcharged
feeling inevitably preceding storm.</p>

<p>Lynn Isherwood surmounted Mogul's plateau and wheeled to catch
a last glance of Hugh Tracy. But the yard was empty and, slightly
disappointed, she resumed her course. Pitching into one of the
innumerable gullies that during wet season flung a lacework of
water over the sheer rim walls, she rose and instantly halted,
right hand reaching for the rifle butt swung upward from the
saddle horn. In front of her, no more than thirty feet away, a
man spurred from an adjoining gully to bar her path.</p>

<p>Quick, flashing anger fired her face, pointed it more sharply.
"I told you to keep out of my way," said the girl.</p>

<p>He was tall, with a loose and easy handsomeness of feature.
Bold eyes laughed at her. "I risk my neck every time I come over
this far," he drawled, "and this is all I get for it. Look here,
honey, be reasonable with a man."</p>

<p>She swung the rifle around on its swivel, and the man revealed
a sudden gust of irritation. "Yes, I know you'd shoot that damned
thing. But don't try it. You tried last night&mdash;and I wasn't
there, was I?"</p>

<p>She sat still, frowning at him; imperious, stormy-eyed.</p>

<p>The man laughed again. "I saw the whole business. You thought
I was down there and I wasn't. It was Tracy. You and him had
quite a spell of conversation up here in the rimrock. I saw that,
too."</p>

<p>"I thought I knew your kind pretty well," retorted the girl,
"but spying on people makes a worse picture of it."</p>

<p>"You seem to get on with Hugh in fine style. That's goin' some
for a stubborn fool like him."</p>

<p>"I notice that you didn't go to meet him."</p>

<p>"Why should I?" growled the man, passing back to anger. His
moods played close to the surface. "I don't want anything of
Tracy."</p>

<p>"Go on, ride away."</p>

<p>"You're not going to turn me off that easy," he said.</p>

<p>"You've tried your luck and it's no good," parried Lynn. "Now
run."</p>

<p>He sat still, grinning at her. "I'm usually lucky in love,
honey. What's the matter with my style? It ain't that you're
modest about bein' alone with a man&mdash;not after makin' up
Tracy's house for him."</p>

<p>She threw the gun muzzle on him, turned the safety. "You've
stepped a little too far over the line, Bat Testervis. I will
listen to no more of that talk!"</p>

<p>He folded his arms on the saddle and said slowly: "How would
you like your uncle to know you came over to Tracy's ranch?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't risk facing him."</p>

<p>"I can write, can't I?"</p>

<p>"Anonymous," said the girl, full of scorn. "Is there nothing
in the whole catalogue of spite and meanness you won't try?"</p>

<p>A red tide went across his loose, blond features. "You've got
a knack," he grumbled, "of getting me on the worst side. I'm not
so bad. Put down that confounded gun and let me ride a little
with you."</p>

<p>"Not a yard. Mosey along. I'm tired of going over this
again."</p>

<p>His mouth snapped shut. Angry clear through, he jerked the
horse around. "All right, you win another trick. But you can't
get rid of me so easy. I'll keep ridin' across your trail till
you give me a fair hearing."</p>

<p>She held the gun on him till he was a full two hundred yards
away. Then, weariness showing through her eyes, she went on.
Darkly she considered her situation. There was neither peace nor
security in this land. Predatory and deceitful, Powder desert
offered her no shelter, even in her own home. She could trust
nobody. Nobody&mdash;and an odd current of mixed hope and despair
ran through her as she thought of him&mdash;Hugh Tracy, a man she
had met only twice in her life.</p>

<p>"I could trust him absolutely," she murmured. "Yet I have no
business asking him for help. He is fighting for his own life
now."</p>

<p>On Mogul's plateau, north of his house, Hugh Tracy crossed a
rather deep arroyo at the edge of which stood a rock cairn
marking the line between Shadrow's outfit and the Testervis
Double-O-on-a-Rail. The flat sweep of the rim began to break into
low rolling ridges, isolated box buttes, and stands of pines.
Incomparably the better cattle country, better grassed and better
sheltered, it took a gently descending pitch, at last falling
many miles beyond into that great flat bay of the prairie of
which Powder was but an indented finger. Accepting a well-defined
road running easy gradients from one contour to another, Tracy
settled to a steady lope, skirted the chrome face of a butte, and
entered timber. A quarter-hour of this let him into the open
again, between small bare ridges.</p>

<p>Certain things surprised him, made him more watchful.</p>

<p>There was no stock grazing here where usually the Testervis
boys ran heavy herds&mdash;that was one thing. And he was being
watched. His first warning of this came in the shape of pony
tracks cutting freshly into the dusty strip of road, preceding
him a distance, and cutting out again. Closely attentive to the
left-hand ridge, he thought he saw a peak of a hat slide behind a
boulder. It was good rifle distance, and the memory of ambush
still rankled; so without stopping, he reached for his own booted
gun and laid it over the saddle. That act was immediately
spotted. The yonder man rose from behind the rock and crossed
both arms above his head, waving Hugh Tracy onward.</p>

<p>Tracy waved back. The two ridges joined ahead of him, and he
pressed over this small summit, at once entering a country more
broken and wooded. "Testervis scout," he reflected. If the game
had come to this pass&mdash;stationed sentries, patrols, the
whole preliminary skirmishing of uneasy truce&mdash;open war
could not be far off. He met no more interruption in the
succeeding five miles; but when a sharp circling road between the
trees let him out upon a green, creek-sundered meadow in which
the Testervis quarters pleasantly sat, two punchers appeared
simultaneously from different angles and walked toward him. He
crossed a flat plank bridge and faced these men, smiling
slightly.</p>

<p>"Tracy," grunted one, deeply astonished. "Damn me, Hugh, I
never thought y' would cut the mustard."</p>

<p>"Only way to kill me, Happy, is by throwin' me bodily over the
rim."</p>

<p>"You'd only sprout wings and fly down," said the designated
Happy.</p>

<p>"Don't make the angels mad. Where's brothers Morgan and
Bat?"</p>

<p>Happy motioned to the porch, and Hugh rode forward. A middle-
sized man dressed in neat black came through the door. Sober and
quiet-speaking, he yet conveyed a sense of pleasure at seeing
Hugh.</p>

<p>"I heard yesterday you'd come back. Light and rest. By Joe,
I'm pleased."</p>

<p>Hugh slid from the saddle and went forward to seize the
outstretched hand Morgan Testervis offered him. "You're the first
one that's said so. I'd sort of gathered I was bringing cholera
into this country."</p>

<p>"Powder's changed," said Testervis. "Sit down."</p>

<p>He was a thoughtful man, this Morgan Testervis, around forty
and quiet in manner and speech. As far removed from the average
rawboned, decisive type of Westerner as it is possible to get, he
would never have impressed any casual observer. He had a chubby
face, slightly freckled; his eyes were brown and readily kind.
The only dominating feature about him was a mouth that made one
strong line across his face.</p>

<p>"I'd observed some difference," agreed Hugh.</p>

<p>"You're here," said Morgan Testervis, "to find out who wrecked
your place."</p>

<p>"Good guess."</p>

<p>"First things first," observed Testervis, slowly. "You put
most of your spare time on that ranch. Naturally it hurts to see
the ruin. Good thing you wasn't runnin' any stock."</p>

<p>Hugh maintained silence, and after a while Testervis went
quietly on: "I never lied to any man in my life. That miserable
job is not of my doing."</p>

<p>"Your word is good with me, Morgan," said Hugh, looking
around. The yard presented a different appearance than when he
had last seen it. The changes were significant. A rack of rifles
stood on the porch. Out by the creek two separate lines of
cordwood, breast high, had been laid with some thought of
presenting a barrier to the road. Lanes were cut through the
surrounding trees at three different points, creating observation
alleys to the hills beyond.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Testervis, seeing Tracy's glance go around the
yard. "It's come to that. We're in a state of siege&mdash;or will
be. I've got twenty men now who do nothing but stay around this
house, waitin', Maybe you've noticed already, but there's damned
few riders to be seen in Antelope or on the desert."</p>

<p>Tracy nodded. Testervis went on: "One of three things has
happened to 'em. They've pulled clear of the country, like wise
men should. They've joined Shadrow, or they've enlisted with
me."</p>

<p>"Morgan," asked Hugh, "where's Bill Vivian?"</p>

<p>Testervis shook his head. "Ain't seen him a long time. Not
since you got hit."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't run," said Hugh, shaking his head. "He never knew
how. I don't get this sudden blow-up. Things are no different now
than three months ago. What ticked off the grief?"</p>

<p>Testervis swung in his chair. "Take it for what it's worth.
You're not listenin' to an impartial judge."</p>

<p>"Go ahead. Normally, you're peaceful. I don't think you
started it."</p>

<p>"All right. The ball opened when you damned near got killed.
That was no accident, Hugh. I will not essay to say who did it. I
only say that two nights later your wire was cut and that a batch
of cattle, not wearin' my brand, went into your water. Charley
Sullivan, couple days after that, came to me and said he wanted a
job. I gave it to him. He was sore about something. He rode line
toward the boundary a week later&mdash;and that's where we found
him. Dead. Not a hundred yards from your house."</p>

<p>"Tryin' to protect my place," said Hugh, invaded by a still
rage. "Very well. That's the surface story. But it don't explain
anything."</p>

<p>"Do you stop to realize that to either side of that rock
boundary mark there's a good ten thousand acres not worth a
nickel for grazin'&mdash;because it's got no water? Half is
Shadrow's, half is mine. That is, we claim it for range when it
really belongs to the government. But we don't use it because
there ain't a single spring on it. Now think a minute. Where is
closest water?"</p>

<p>"Mine."</p>

<p>"Sure." Testervis leaned forward and tapped Hugh's knee to
emphasize his words. "And whoever gets your water has control of
all that dry range. It's good for him&mdash;and nobody else. If I
get your water, I've got ten thousand acres. My own plus the
scope Shadrow claims. If he gets your water, he's winner. Figure
it out for yourself&mdash;I didn't order you shot. I don't like
range wars."</p>

<p>"If he wanted my water so bad, why didn't he offer to buy,
long time ago?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever know of Shadrow payin' money for anything he
could steal?" grunted Testervis. "He buried his own mother as a
pauper to save a fifty-dollar casket."</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head. "I had that all figured out a long while
back. But nothing ever happened my way, and I figured Shadrow
wouldn't try it."</p>

<p>"Shadrow's one obsession is land," stated Testervis. "He'd
wear his life away schemin' to get one bleak acre not fit to feed
a horned toad. The reason he's let you alone till now is he's
been busy consolidating himself south of Antelope. Well, that job
is done. Shadrow owns all of Mogul from the Mica Buttes to my
line. He owns three quarters of the desert&mdash;up to your spur.
He's marched to that point. Now he's ready to march farther.
Never forget, you're just one item&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was called a white chip in a no-limit game by the gentleman
this morning," interrupted Hugh.</p>

<p>"You saw him?" asked Testervis, a little surprised. "Well, he
told you the truth. He wants your water for a foothold. He'll
bring his cattle right down against me. He'll use your ridge as a
convenient pass out of Mogul to the desert. He'll crowd my free
range with stock until I'm starved out. At the first show of
trouble on my part, he'll open up a fight, drive me clean off
Mogul. And then he's got it all."</p>

<p>"He's not got it yet."</p>

<p>"You see me forted up, don't you?" commented Testervis, and
raised his eyes across the creek to the high ground rolling down
from the pines. A rider galloped full tilt into sight, rousing
both the Testervis hands at the creek to sudden life; but when
they saw him they wheeled into the shade again&mdash;and Morgan
Testervis muttered some dissatisfied phrase under his breath.</p>

<p>Hugh grinned. "Bat travels like a shot out of a gun."</p>

<p>"No more sense than a louse on a hot brick," muttered
Morgan.</p>

<p>Bat Testervis cantered across the yard, curiosity written
across his loose, good-looking features. Identifying Hugh, his
easy manner was replaced by a studied indifference. He wheeled,
dismounted, squatted on the earth. "See you're back, Tracy."</p>

<p>Hugh only nodded, not particularly astonished at the younger
brother's lack of enthusiasm. Strong as iron, showy, jealous of
his varied abilities, and loving popularity, Bat Testervis held a
sort of arrogant resentment against Hugh Tracy for the latter's
rough-and-tumble record in the Powder; once challenging Tracy's
physical ability, he had met him at Indian wrestling and had been
thrown severely on the flat of his back three times in
succession. Never at any subsequent time had he been more than
civil. At present, rolling a cigarette, he ignored Tracy.</p>

<p>"Where you been?" demanded Morgan.</p>

<p>"Oh, ridin' the south end."</p>

<p>"Just full of business that way lately," said the older man,
glumly.</p>

<p>"What of it?" snapped Bat.</p>

<p>"One day you'll run into the Shadrow bunch and there'll be
hell to pay. Mayhe you're willing to start something, but you
won't finish it. Use your head once in a while."</p>

<p>Bat blew smoke through his mouth and stared at his brother.
"Stay home and knit socks, uh? I don't think much of your spunk.
I've said before, and I'll repeat, there's no way out of this
except to get every damned man together, go over there, and smash
TS off the plateau."</p>

<p>"Or be smashed off."</p>

<p>"My God, where's your sand? Catch 'em when they ain't
lookin'."</p>

<p>"I don't fight that way,'" said Morgan slowly:</p>

<p>"No. You'll sit here twiddlin' your thumbs till they come on
the shoot."</p>

<p>"As long as I run this outfit," added Morgan, flattening each
word, "I will handle things my style. A lot of men are going to
get killed. I will not have the responsibility for that on my
conscience."</p>

<p>Bat rose with an emphasized gesture of disgust, walking around
the house. Morgan sat staring out into the lessening light of the
late afternoon, glance slowly screwing up on some remote object.
Tracy remained quiet, a little off ease at overhearing the
disagreement, even though he knew this to be a common thing, and
one of the weak points of the Testervis outfit. Morgan roused
himself. "What are you going to do, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"He offered to buy," drawled Tracy. "I told him to forget
it."</p>

<p>"What was his answer?"</p>

<p>"Plain enough. His declaration was that when trouble started
I'd have to get on one side or the other, and that if I guessed
the wrong side I was out of luck."</p>

<p>"And you will be."</p>

<p>"I know it," agreed Hugh. "But I will not buckle under to Tade
Shadrow, Morgan. Not now, or ever."</p>

<p>Morgan Testervis stirred. "Listen. It's mighty disagreeable to
say this&mdash;and I ain't forcin' your hand at all. You better
sell out to me. You can't hold against him. I think I can. At any
rate, singlehanded, you'll lose and I'll lose too&mdash;that
water. Sounds cold-blooded, but it's war."</p>

<p>"In the morning I'm going to Antelope for a new bunch of wire.
I'll string it. Next time Shadrow tries to cut it, we'll see. No,
I won't sell."</p>

<p>"Didn't think you would," said Morgan regretfully.</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy rose, turned on Testervis. "But I'm in with you,
Morgan."</p>

<p>Testervis jumped to his feet, moved by deep pleasure.</p>

<p>"You are! Good&mdash;good! I wouldn't ask it, but I hoped
mighty hard to hear you say it. Now, if there is anything you
want, say so. Money, men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're in it that strong?" said Tracy, mildly surprised at
the other man's show of sudden energy.</p>

<p>"Tracy, I'm no fighter. But nobody knows how much sweat and
sorrow went into the making of this ranch. If Shadrow has his
way, it's all wiped out and the Testervis family goes down. I
will not let him do it. By God, I will not!"</p>

<p>"Lend me half a sack of grub," said Hugh. "I've got to get
back before it's too dark. I don't care as much for starlight
riding as I used to."</p>

<p>Morgan Testervis nodded, passing inside the house. The sun was
down, and twilight's transparency etched tree and slope in a bold
relief. Through that evening hush the ranch sounds echoed,
increasingly resonant. Men rose from odd angles and collected in
the yard; the cook's triangle woke, its brassy "clang-clang"
rolling out and up, shattering each far vista's huddled peace.
Bat walked into sight again. "You're stickin' it out, Tracy?" he
asked, bluntly curious.</p>

<p>"Why not?" countered Hugh, roiled by the man's half
insolence.</p>

<p>Bat shrugged his shoulders. "You'll find most of your good
friends have busted the breeze."</p>

<p>"They'll be back."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," contradicted Bat. He stared at Tracy, on the
verge of saying something more. Instead, he turned off and stood
on a porch step.</p>

<p>"You've got your fight," observed Tracy. "It'll be right under
your nose."</p>

<p>Bat laughed, short and sardonic. "My fight? Morgan's you mean.
My way doesn't suit him. And if he gets us into a jam, he can
struggle along by himself."</p>

<p>Morgan came out, handing a half-filled gunnysack to Tracy.
"Anything else?"</p>

<p>Hugh swung the sack over the saddle horn, mounted. "Not now.
Listen, Morgan, you'd better keep a line of men strung out relay
style toward my place."</p>

<p>"Already done. You'll see them now and then."</p>

<p>"So-long," said Tracy and cantered off. Across the bridge he
looked back to find Morgan Testervis poised in the yard, a small
and quiet figure full of worry.</p>

<p>The pines were aswirl with powder-colored shadows when Hugh
entered them. Beyond, between the low ridges, full night caught
him&mdash;a moonless night, broken by a crusted crystal
starlight. Dimly, very dimly, he caught the moving bulk of a
rider against the lesser darkness above the western ridge top;
and the metal click of a horse's shoe flashed on rock. He guessed
it to be the Testervis patrol keeping pace with him, and
presently he lost the man altogether as he came upon the pitch
gloom of another timbered mass. The sound of his travel ran
ahead, full and free, breaking into the whorls and layers of
separate echoes. But the velvet opacity around him was shelter.
Merged with it, he made no target, and for a spell he let himself
be swayed by that sense of wild, isolated freedom that was as
much a part of him as the blood in his veins. This was his world,
complete and satisfying. The beat of his pony was melody, the
mingled dust and pine smell made a fine fragrance. In the deeps
of the forest a bobwhite launched his questioning, subdued
whistle&mdash;human in accent.</p>

<p>But the mood passed when the trees dropped away and he entered
the barrens. As distinctly as the broken lines of Mogul plateau
stood out, so the joined silhouette of himself and the horse
stood out. Alert now, unwinking, raking each deceptive pattern of
darkness, he followed the bending road as it led away to his own
place. The cairn stood somewhere on his right, westward. Solid
objects seemed to move; and actually a whole strip of shadow
shifted across his vision. Warned, nerves singing, he drew to a
dead halt.</p>

<p>A line of riders appeared from a gully, not more than two
hundred yards in advance, crossed the road, and continued on to
the right. Swiftly estimating, he judged the party to be better
than thirty strong; and while he watched, it faded into the
broken area, beyond his view.</p>

<p>Sitting still, he debated his course rapidly. Without doubt
those men were Shadrow's, for they came from TS soil; and Morgan
Testervis had not spoken of putting one of his own parties out.
The odd silence meant something more than a scout; the numbers
indicated possible attack. Testervis had to be warned. There was
no question of that; but it was a long ride back, and he faced
the prospect of being treated as an intruder by the roaming
Testervis sentries, one of which could not be far removed. The
better idea was to break the quiet, put these men on guard. So,
riding from the road into an adjacent ravine, he lifted his gun
and fired once at the sky.</p>

<p>The immediate blast was like an explosion in the earth; and
the succeeding echoes rolled on and on, flattening, swelling, and
at last fainting into the far rim of the night. A deeper, more
utter silence followed&mdash;that unnatural stillness in which
even the night creatures cease to speak. But out of it presently
rose the rush and pound of horsemen on the return. He saw their
silhouettes again streaming across the black; and, crouched at
the gully's lip, he felt the nearing tremble in the earth. They
raced along the road&mdash;a smaller body of the main one,
obviously&mdash; and swept by. Northward a good distance he heard
them swing off on a circle to rejoin the larger group.</p>

<p>He waited until the silence had drawn out. Then he pushed the
horse from gully to gully and came to the spur off Mogul. That
encounter had roused all of his suspicions, and he threaded the
trees near his meadow some distance from the main trail. Reaching
the clearing, he slipped to the ground and started forward. He
had made some noise coming off Mogul and he knew that his own
presence was advertised, if an ambush had been established. Not
at all certain, but a little comforted by a lack of any intuitive
warning&mdash;on which he strongly depended&mdash;he wheeled
around the barn, explored it, and came to the house by the back
side. He had a well-used trick for the occasion, which was to
place one ear flat to the wall. Not the slightest sound indicated
intrusion; and finally, dissatisfied by the creeping process, he
crawled to the porch and threw himself into the doorway. Wheeling
instantly aside and stiffening, he was met only by a further
silence. Yet there had been somehody in the place, for the smell
of cigarette smoke clung to the air. It took him half an hour to
satisfy himself; afterwards he stabled the pony and rolled into
his blankets for another night's half sleep and half watch.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER 5. &mdash; THE BAITED MAN</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER breakfast, the flame of another hot August
day spreading fanwise across the low east, Hugh Tracy cantered
down the spur, Antelope-bound. All the way to the TS rim road it
was an empty world; but at that point the mark of many pony hoofs
lay on the earth and a fresh-disturbed dust still unsettled the
crisp air; around a bend he viewed a compact body of horsemen
preceding him some two miles at a fast clip.</p>

<p>In the wake of these, TS men undoubtedly, he thoughtfully
revolved his chances through his mind. Never adept at fooling
himself, and too long a citizen of the Powder to trust in the
charity of his enemies, he definitely felt the danger of
appearing in town. All it took now to produce an explosion was a
chance word, a too-swift gesture of arm, some casual brush of
shoulder against shoulder. Twenty-four hours previously he had
thoroughly read Tade Shadrow, and he knew the added time would
not have softened the man's purpose. Shadrow schemed too far
ahead and too widely in extent to let the opposition of a single
individual bother him greatly. His whole ruthless, contemptuous
philosophy was expressed in that phrase clinging like a burr to
Tracy's memory: "You're a white chip in a no-limit game."</p>

<p>The word was undoubtedly out amongst all the TS hands by now
that it was open season on him. Given a chance, some one of that
crew would try for him. Such was the blindly jealous spirit of
paid partisans. There never had been much compunction of mercy in
a Powder war; never would be. And if he was not prepared for the
ultimate showdown, he had better turn back to the spur.</p>

<p>This was his reasoning as he racked along; carefully, thought
out to the issue&mdash;and then swept away. He would not go
back.</p>

<p>There was never any ultimate sense avoiding a fight for the
sake of a few days' preparation. His own headlong impulses
disliked preparation, and this natural instinct to plunge on was
fortified by the long knowledge of the country's way. Nothing
ever reached climax by slow stages. Uneasy peace held awhile,
suppressing the underneath intrigues and deceits; the storm broke
in full violence, sweeping aside all compacts and labored
safeguards; peace came again for a while. The only thing that
counted was an alertness, an instant readiness to ride the
tempests. His own relaxed safeguards had brought ambush upon him.
That mistake he meant never to repeat. And with this formed
conviction, he rode into Antelope's northern end.</p>

<p>As he had suspected, Antelope was well-filled, strangely so
for a Monday morning; and slowing to a walk, he ran a narrowed
glance along the street. The weight of activity seemed to be at
the other end, around the saloon and the courthouse adjoining.
Most of the horses were racked there, and most of the crowd
lounged or sauntered from one place to the other. His entry, he
immediately discovered, created a quick shift of attention, and
with deliberate forethought he rode to the mouth of the stable
and left his horse at the rack there. It placed him more or less
opposite the bulk of the TS men. But he halted only long enough
to throw the reins over the pole, afterwards going directly to
the hardware store.</p>

<p>He had known Til MacGruder, the owner of that store, most of
his life. Yet the reluctant "Hello, Hugh," had the distant
civility of a stranger. In addition, there seemed to be a kind of
appeal in MacGruder's eyes, possibly explained by a pair of
punchers lounging near by as silent witnesses. Tracy nodded,
playing the game MacGruder wanted because he understood the man's
precarious position in this TS town.</p>

<p>"Two boxes of .45 shells," he said. When he got them and paid
for them, he added: "Mac, I want about twenty spindles of barb-
wire."</p>

<p>MacGruder showed surprise that turned rapidly to reluctance.
Tracy saw his eyes flick over to the punchers and jerk back.
"Bobwire? I don't know, Hugh. Don't think I got any."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have, Mac. Don't play freeze-out on me. Put 'em to
the porch while I go hire a team and wagon off Jinks Bailey."</p>

<p>For some reason MacGruder's face relaxed and showed relief.
"All right, Hugh. Get the wagon around and I'll roll the spindles
out for you."</p>

<p>Tracy departed, catching the swift undertone of something said
by the two TS hands. Across at the stable again he met the
roustabout. "Where's Jinks?"</p>

<p>"Do' know."</p>

<p>"I want a team and wagon for today and tomorrow. Those two
bays will do."</p>

<p>"Not on my say-so," said the roustabout slowly. "You'll have
to see Jinks. I think I seed him go into Burkey's."</p>

<p>Tracy stared at the roustabout's evasive cheeks and pivoted
about. The two hands in MacGruder's place were just now emerging,
heading for the saloon. At that point the crowd had thinned
during the short minutes since his arrival and he saw half a
dozen hands casually scattered along the walks at the north end.
Silently he said to himself: "It's here&mdash;right here," and
the old, uncaring anger began to pump through him. He had no
business going into Burkey's saloon, yet every man in this
oppressive town understood the moves of the game as well as he
did, and if he turned away from Antelope now it would be
recognized instantly that he was retreating. So, squaring
himself, he started out.</p>

<p>What stopped him, in the stable's archway, was the rapid
approach of a man he knew&mdash;the sorrel Willy Bones. Bones saw
him at the same time and checked back on his heels, raising a
face stamped with worry.</p>

<p>"Tracy&mdash;hello, Tracy."</p>

<p>"Howdy, Bones."</p>

<p>Bones's lips went thin with pressure. He whipped a glance
around him, pulled his shoulders together. "Tracy&mdash;you seen
my horse?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;just came in."</p>

<p>"It was here," muttered Bones. "By God, they got it!"</p>

<p>"Who got it?"</p>

<p>"It was right here," said Bones hurriedly, "when I went in for
a drink. They got it. They don't want me to leave town!"</p>

<p>A fine, glistening film of sweat stood across his upper lip,
and he pulled the lower one between his teeth. Both palms ran
nervously up and down his coat. Hugh Tracy only half saw him, for
the slow deploying of men along the street kept drawing his close
attention. The in-and-out traffic at Burkey's door increased. One
puncher left that porch and walked with an exaggerated straddle
toward the stable, cool eyes pinned on Willy Bones's back. Up by
the courthouse Tracy recognized Tade Shadrow's white saddle horse
for the first time. "If you're a TS man," grunted Hugh, "why
sweat about it?"</p>

<p>"I never ought to of come here," groaned Willy Bones. "Tracy,
I went&mdash;"</p>

<p>The oncoming puncher called sharply, "Bones, let's go have a
drink."</p>

<p>Willy Bones perked himself around, growing rigid. "Don't want
a drink," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Sure you do," urged the puncher. "Sure you want a drink."</p>

<p>"Listen," snapped Bones, at once irritable and alarmed, "leave
me alone."</p>

<p>The puncher came to a stand; pushed back his hat, and laid
both palms on his hips. The cool, direct stare clung to Bones.
"Look here, ain't I good enough to drink with? Don't come that
proud stuff on me, Willy. You drinkin' or not?"</p>

<p>Bones stood very still, his back to Tracy. By and by his
glance went creeping to either side of him. Afterwards he looked
behind, and Tracy got the outright fear in the boy's eyes. It
lasted only a moment. Bones said quietly, "All right, I'll come
along."</p>

<p>"Fine," applauded the puncher in a casual, ironic voice. Never
at any time during the interview had he glanced toward Tracy; and
now he hooked his arm through Bones's elbow and led the youth
across the street. Tracy let out a long breath. He didn't know
what this was about, yet it was clear enough that TS was
punishing one of its own members. Bones's expression of absolute
fear was sufficient indication of it. Posted in the archway,
Tracy's hardening inspection raked the idle groups of men
situated here and there in the rising blaze of light. This grim
play going on had suddenly assumed complexity. He wondered if
Bones was bait dangled under his nose; and still wondering, he
walked through the deep dust to the saloon side, brushed the body
of a hand who stood in his path with an obvious arrogance, and
entered Burkey's.</p>

<p>There was half a room of them, and they saw him the moment he
pushed the doors aside. Bones, standing at the bar, drew back a
little, a strong relief rushing across the set features. But it
was of a moment's duration. Tracy could almost see this sorrel
rider's thoughts go reasoning from hope to despair; and it was a
plain gesture of defeat when the youth turned stolidly, blank-
faced to the bar again, and swiftly reached for his whisky. If a
man was afraid of the bullet's brief agony, Tracy thought a
little contemptuously, drink was as good a drug as any. He stood
in the middle of the room, the black lees of his temper staining
the gray eyes to slate. One man's curse struck above the general
confusion, to accent a slowly subsiding tone of talk. His
traveling inspection reached behind the poker tables and stopped
on the tall frame of Lake Tolbert.</p>

<p>Tolbert stood where he usually did, behind the crowd, off at a
point of observation. His back was to a wall, the shackling body
a little slouched. Wrapped in deep taciturnity as always, the
impassive face registered no emotion, and the drooping lids
closed out most of the expression of his eyes. Obviously he had
watched Tracy from the moment of entry, for Tracy's glance
instantly looked into the tall fellow's steady survey. Tolbert
shifted his tobacco, swayed away from the wall.</p>

<p>"Mornin'."</p>

<p>Tracy nodded. "Hello, Lake."</p>

<p>"Drink?"</p>

<p>"Ain't that against your orders?" observed Hugh.</p>

<p>Tolbert let the phrase settle before answering. "It will make
no difference in my fortunes&mdash;or yours," said he.</p>

<p>Tracy stared at the TS foreman. "At least that's an honest
answer. I despise beatin' around the bush."</p>

<p>"Drink?" repeated Tolbert, and when he caught Tracy's slight
nod he raised one slow arm and snapped his fingers. Tracy watched
soberly, reading the foreman.</p>

<p>This man had power, the power of silence and immovability and
thoughtfulness. In that neat round head were ideas never
unlocked; across those thin lips no unnecessary phrase had ever
passed. An enigma to all, there was a touch of the sinister about
him; and he was utterly obeyed. Lou Burkey hurried from the bar
with a bottle and a pair of glasses, dividing a surreptitious
glance between the two men. He lingered a moment, to be sent away
by Tolbert's curt gesture. Tolbert filled the glasses, raised his
own.</p>

<p>"I admire a stubborn man," said he, and drank. Twirling the
empty glass around and around between his long, thin-ligamented
fingers, he held the weight of his eyes on Tracy, and presently
said: "Looking for somebody?"</p>

<p>"Jinks Bailey."</p>

<p>Tolbert nodded slightly. "To hire a team," he added. "You
won't find Jinks. If you did, he wouldn't be rentin' teams."</p>

<p>"You know all the answers," grunted Tracy.</p>

<p>Tolbert's glance lifted against the gradually forming circle
of men around him; and though there was no change on that
angular, high-boned face, the circle dissolved. He returned his
attention to Tracy. "You are a fool for bein' here today," he
said, cool and remote.</p>

<p>"That's all you have to say?"</p>

<p>Tolbert ducked his head for a reply.</p>

<p>Hugh set down his glass. "Thanks for the drink," he murmured,
and turned to the door. His mind seemed split into two separate
cells, the one grasping every surface impression, the other
slowly threshing at the edges of an increased question. Where,
along the dragging, flat-footed march of the moments, would the
break come? Impatience gripped him, made a further rest in
Burkey's impossible; the very air was surcharged with mass
tension, with the unspoken expectancy of every man around the
room. He felt Tolbert's few words to be a part of the inevitable
play, that they had served as a delay while other instruments of
deceit came into line. Willy Bones clung to the bar, hat gone and
his youthful face haggard. All this drove Tracy to the street.
There were only three men on the porch now. Elsewhere the
sentries were further scattered and lounging. One stood beneath
the stable arch where none had been before. Looking that way, the
set and rebellious cast of his face deepened. His horse was
gone.</p>

<p>Poised, expecting anything in the space of a drawn breath, he
felt the effect of some signal hidden from him. The nearest man
on the porch wheeled, walked into Burkey's. A voice cut crisply
through that inside silence.</p>

<p>"Willy, let's go see if we can find that pony you been cryin'
about."</p>

<p>The whole thing was a lie. Not yet knowing why, he understood
TS was about to exercise its grisly vengefulness on Willy Bones.
Willy knew it; every man in Antelope knew it. Willy had made no
answer, but Hugh Tracy's ears got a deep, half-strangled intake
of breath which could come only from the sorrel-faced puncher.
The other man's voice broke more sharply into the singing
silence. "All right. Let's go now." And presently there was the
slow march of boots over Burkey's floor. A feel of extreme
urgency knotted his nerves, pushed him across the street to the
stable's entrance. His horse, he instantly saw, stood at the back
end of the place. But as he discovered it, the TS hand posted in
the archway slowly pivoted to face him, deeply watchful, and he
understood the man was there to block any chance of his reaching
the animal. Tracy stopped, came about. On the street nobody
moved; even the group at the courthouse ceased its shifting, and
the hot sun flooded a town seemingly gripped by paralysis. Willy
Bones stumbled out of Burkey's and turned indecisively from side
to side. The escorting puncher came through, gripped his arm, led
him toward the porch steps. Halfway across the dusty strip, a
dull, strident voice stopped them both: "Bones, I want to see
you."</p>

<p>What had been obscure was clear now; that familiar voice swept
away all doubt. Sid Maunders walked into the edge of Tracy's
vision from some hidden angle and advanced. Willy Bones wrenched
free from the other puncher's retaining arm and took one long
stride toward the stable. But only one, for he caught himself
there; and as before, the intently watching Tracy could read very
clearly the tumbling, despairing thoughts rioting through Willy
Bones's head and arriving at the plank wall of futility. Making
his stand, Bones straightened around and faced the oncoming
Maunders. The other puncher, his part played out, slowly backed
off.</p>

<p>Rage swelled in Tracy's throat. They were putting the kid
under pressure&mdash;that cruel force so common in the
Powder&mdash;and Willy Bones was showing the straight, fine grain
of courage all the way through. This was TS business and so far
none of his affair, yet his own position was bad, for what
happened next would be as abrupt and immediate as a clap of
thunder. Letting his big fists fall beside him, he turned on the
TS sentry across the archway who so ceaselessly watched him.
"Move out in the street."</p>

<p>The man showed surprise by the slight widening of his eyes. He
shook his head.</p>

<p>"You'll have your turn later," snapped Hugh. "Get out of this
stable."</p>

<p>The man's reply was a slow crooking of his elbows, a slight
parting of his lips. Tracy, shrewdly guessing he could crack this
fellow's nerves, ripped out another sentence: "The ball's about
to open, and I'd as soon open it now. If anybody gets hurt it'll
be you."</p>

<p>The other let out a breath, cursed slowly. "I'll go down the
walk a few steps&mdash;not another inch."</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>He walked toward the sentry. The latter, hamstrung by sudden
doubt, grudgingly slid around the wall of the stable and backed
away along the sidewalk. Tracy stopped where the other had been,
his one flank at last safe. Sid Maunders marched on through the
dust and finally halted at arm's length from Willy Bones, the
enormous box-square torso dwarfing the youngster. His head tipped
down a little, and across the flat-featured face lay the only
expression he wore&mdash;that swart and unimaginative sullenness
of one who lived in a starkly shadowed world. He thrust his hand
outward.</p>

<p>"Shake, Willy."</p>

<p>As cold and blunt as that the trick was to be done. Tracy saw
the trap open before him. Willy Bones remained rigid, nothing
showing on his cheeks. Yet the strain of it corded his neck
ligaments against the sorrel skin, and every muscle seemed to
lock Tracy balanced the alternatives in his head, just as he knew
Willy Bones was doing. If the kid refused to shake, the quarrel
was made and Maunders would snap at the chance; if the kid
accepted that bruising paw, he would be tricked and killed. As
cold and blunt as that it was to be done.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Bones.</p>

<p>"I ain't seen you for a while," jeered Maunders.</p>

<p>"You been on my trail since I left TS," protested Bones. "And
I been mindin' my own business strictly."</p>

<p>"Sure you have. You're a bright lad."</p>

<p>"Damn you," cried Bones, "leave me alone! It was a sorry day
for me when I went to work for Tade Shadrow! I been cheated out
of my wages, dogged around the hills and tracked like a wolf! All
I want to do is to get out of this country!"</p>

<p>"Shake hands, Willy."</p>

<p>Tracy laid an iron grip on his impulses, yet even as he told
himself to keep out of it and guard his own fortunes he rapidly
checked his position. On his left he was safe&mdash;being
slightly inside the arch. Maunders was the only man directly in
front, To his right a raking fire could reach him; and throwing a
glance that way, he found Lake Tolbert lounging against a
building wall across the street. Each part of the machine had
slipped quietly into its place.</p>

<p>"My arm's gettin' tired, Bones," growled Maunders.
"Shake."</p>

<p>Willy Bones swayed on his heels. Tracy, all at once proud of
the kid, thought he had decided to refuse the hand and go down
trying; and at that an overmastering impulse snapped the last
fetter of caution.</p>

<p>"Take his hand, Willy," he snapped.</p>

<p>Willy Bones was at the breaking point, oscillating between
purposes; the words drove into him and released the trigger set
of his mind. Instantly, blindly, he seized the black fist
stretched toward him. Maunders cursed out an enraged "Damn you!"
and knocked the hand aside, throwing himself around at Tracy.
Bracketed in the archway, Tracy knew then he had stepped into the
trap prepared for him. But he was past caring, ridden by a savage
desire to have the cards laid out for whatever they were
worth.</p>

<p>"Tracy," cried Maunders, "are you takin' up this quarrel?"</p>

<p>"It's what you wanted. Go ahead&mdash;make your try."</p>

<p>"Try? Damn you, I never try&mdash;I finish!"</p>

<p>"You didn't last time, Sid," said Tracy, the very calm of his
manner biting into the deep, deep quiet.</p>

<p>"You lie, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shrill coyote yell burst like an alarm through the street,
went wailing between the building walls. Maunders's teeth clamped
down on an unspoken phrase. He threw back his head, and across
the brutal pattern of his cheeks&mdash;never daring to leave
Tracy&mdash; ran a straining attention. Every man within Tracy's
vision went wheeling about to the northward. One puncher broke
out of his tracks, ran a yard, and halted, uncertain. Somebody
shouted: "No&mdash;not that way!" And Lake Tolbert's rearing body
stood where it had been before, motionless.</p>

<p>"Vivian!" roared Tracy. Unnoticed, Willy Bones slowly edged
into the stable and flattened himself behind a false angle of the
arch, across from Tracy. Tracy yelled again. "Bill, stay where
you are!"</p>

<p>"Ain't I?" cried an ironic voice. "Hell, ain't I? Tolbert, I
got a bead on that bone rack of yours!"</p>

<p>"He's behind Overholt's!"</p>

<p>The uneasy puncher started to run again and was brought up by
a command from Tolbert that was like the slash of a whip. "Stay
put, you fool!"</p>

<p>A slack, sullen petulance deepened around Maunders's full
lips; the hunting glint faded out of his eyes. Tracy, feeling the
sway of fortune in each passing moment, knew that one climax had
come and gone. The sure chance was lost&mdash;and Maunders was
recoiling from pure gamble. The thing had been in this gunman's
hands, safe and certain. Now that it no longer was so he was too
cagey to let the responsibility remain with him. Both his arms
relaxed, and quite slowly he turned his body toward Lake Tolbert.
Nothing was said between them, but nothing could have been
clearer than the unspoken question passed across to the TS
foreman. Tolbert pushed himself away from the building wall. "All
right," he said. "Show's over."</p>

<p>"Back up, Sid," ordered Tracy. "If you're all through, back
up."</p>

<p>Tolbert's level, inscrutable glance came over to Tracy.</p>

<p>"You're a lucky man, Hugh."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" grunted Tracy.</p>

<p>"I'm a poker player, too," replied Tolbert, "One of these days
you'll draw to an inside straight&mdash;and lose."</p>

<p>A rider galloped through the line of poplars at a dead heat,
out of the north, sending a call ahead: "Shadrow&mdash;where's
Shadrow!" Then he saw Tolbert and bent down from the saddle.
Something was said. Tolbert pointed toward the courthouse,
smashed his palm against the pony's rump and sent it on. The
tremendous calm of this TS foreman deserted him for once. Already
on the run for his pony by the saloon, he rapped out a bomb-like
order. "Stirrups&mdash;all of you!" Nothing more, but enough. The
stationed punchers broke, dodging over the street. Maunders alone
stood still, and Tolbert looked back and hailed him with a more
incisive command. "Let that matter drop, Sid!" The messenger
reached the head of the street, yelling for Shadrow again, and
the turmoil increased. Maunders plunged into the confusion,
thrusting others aside with his burly fists. Dust rose like
smoke, and through it men's faces were a staring yellow. Riders
and beasts fought for head room. Tolbert's agitated command
faintly penetrated the melee. "Everybody up! I mean everybody.
Maunders! Where are you?" Rail-straight in his saddle; Lake
Tolbert reined to the middle of the street and laid his words
about him as he would have used a quirt. "Get on&mdash;get on!
Head north! Get on, damn you all!" One wing and another of the
party streamed raggedly by. Maunders wheeled beside the foreman,
speaking to a deaf ear&mdash;for Tolbert was in cold rage and
cursing at the laggards. Tade Shadrow spurred up, his thin,
shrewd countenance full of excited energy: The others fell beside
him and went away at dead tilt.</p>

<p>But Tracy, rooted in the archway, suddenly swore round and
full. For another rider had come from the courthouse with Tade
Shadrow and now rode abreast the three. It was Lynn Isherwood,
and in passing Tracy she flashed a glance at him out of a dead
white face; dark fear was in her eyes, but no recognition.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER 6. &mdash; TRACY GUESSES
WRONG</h2>

<p class="first">THE after-vacuum of their passage sucked the
last dregs of vitality from Antelope. The town was empty,
collapsed. High whorls of dust stretched all the way from
courthouse to poplars, the sun burned down, water dripped
monotonously into the stable trough&mdash;that was all. Tracy
expelled a deep breath and stepped from the stable, his first
move in ten long minutes.</p>

<p>"Crawl out, Bill."</p>

<p>An exultant whoop startled the uneasy echoes. Bill Vivian
appeared from a between-buildings alleyway; not deliberately but
in quick, cat-like strides, knees springing and his head turning
from side to side as his glance went foraging about. He wore no
hat, and a mop of unbelievably raw red hair tumbled about his
skull. He was homely beyond the power to portray, all his
features jarring with each other, and the whole effect was one of
striking disharmony. Sun and wind had burned his face to mottled
brick coloring; his eyes were a light and vivid green. Across an
angular face deeply and vertically lined struck an exaggerated
streak of a mouth. Small and thin, his movements were controlled
by surges of impetuous nerves; and thus he came forward, yipping
like an Indian. "That time I paid for my keep, you son-of-a-
gun!"</p>

<p>"It's a habit of yours to show up at the right minute,"
drawled Hugh. He gripped Vivian's hand, and they stood measuring
each other over a prolonged silence. Vivian's mouth was stretched
in a grotesque semicircular grin.</p>

<p>"Damn, you're a sight for sore eyes, Mister Tracy. But
thin."</p>

<p>"And so he appears like a comet," reflected Hugh, "for a pop-
eyed world to gaze upon."</p>

<p>"It took me an awful half-hour crawlin' up to this town."</p>

<p>"Looks to me like you been sleepin' in the trees ever since I
left."</p>

<p>"That's truth. I left this country on the lope."</p>

<p>"As how?"</p>

<p>"After I took you to the hospital, I started back with the
idea of findin' out where that shot came from. Never made it.
Couldn't get into the Powder with a box of dynamite. The beagles
have been on my trail practically since the flood."</p>

<p>"TS?"</p>

<p>"You'd better believe it. Dogged me all over hell's acre and a
half. Guess I've left empty shells in every dog hollow on Powder
rim. A little birdie told me you was back, and I made a run
acrost the desert. Got to your place last night and found you'd
gone."</p>

<p>"So it was your tobacco smoke I smelled?"</p>

<p>"Ahuh. But I couldn't stay. Was somebody on my trail, and I
figured if I didn't haul out sudden and draw this shadow with me
you'd walk into him. Was on Mogul this mornin' and saw you slope
for town. So I come."</p>

<p>"Where's the shadow?"</p>

<p>"I just got weary of bein' chaperoned. So I backtracked, slung
down on the laddie, and tied him to a tree so hard he's
practically part of the bark. Hope the ants bite him."</p>

<p>"And here we are," mused Tracy.</p>

<p>"Ain't we?" drawled Bill Vivian. "Hugh, you can't no more keep
out of trouble than a magpie can keep from pickin' up strings.
What in thunder ever possessed you to hit Antelope when it was
full of Shadrow sports?"</p>

<p>"Came for barb-wire," said Tracy; staring past the poplars.
"Bill, what made those mugs haul out of here so sudden?"</p>

<p>"Bobwire? You're goin' to refence and hold on?"</p>

<p>"The barb-wire is out. Changed my mind. But I'm holdin' on.
Listen, there's only one thing that could put TS in such an awful
sweat."</p>

<p>"Sure. Trouble with Testervis."</p>

<p>Tracy swung about. "We've got to get goin'. Bring your horse
down here."</p>

<p>He went directly to the general store, bought a supply of grub
and split it into two gunnysacks. Returning to the stable, he
found not only Vivian ready for him but young Willy Bones also.
Handing one of the sacks to the redhead, he shot a curious glance
at the kid. "What for?"</p>

<p>Willy Bones spread his palms upward. "Where else could I
go?"</p>

<p>"Hell-bent out of this country, which would be wise."</p>

<p>"No," said Willy doggedly. "That won't do. Shadrow owes me
eighty dollars."</p>

<p>Hugh and Vivian swapped glances, and Vivian drawled an amused
question: "Is that very damned important?"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I'm ridin' with you fellows," said Willy, stubbornly
insistent.</p>

<p>"Willy," broke in Hugh, "you'll be lucky to get out of it
alive."</p>

<p>"Thunder, I was dead when I walked from Burkey's saloon. You
can't kill a man more'n once."</p>

<p>"Better not," pressed Hugh.</p>

<p>Bones lifted a pair of concerned, begging eyes on Tracy. "I
just got to. Doggone it, I just got to."</p>

<p>"Bill," said Hugh, "we've got an army. Let's go."</p>

<p>"You won't never regret it," cried Willy Bones; and, three
abreast, they galloped out of Antelope. TS hoof dust strung a
banner all along the foot of Mogul.</p>

<p>"I'm the only man in this party," said Bill Vivian, "that's
got a lick of sense. You're pokin' your snoozer into bad
medicine."</p>

<p>"I told Testervis I was throwin' in with him."</p>

<p>"With troubles of your own, you do that?" marveled Vivian.</p>

<p>"No way out of it."</p>

<p>"You can't cut the mustard this time, Hugh. They're too
many."</p>

<p>"Counsel of caution from a man who never knew how to spell the
word." This amiable bickering was like old times, and Hugh
grinned, rolling his big shoulders forward. "All right, if we
don't fight, what do we do?"</p>

<p>"We-ell," murmured Vivian, "from a judgmatical standpoint I'd
say run. But I've tried runnin', and blast me it's awful hard
work. So maybe you're right."</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>Vivian covered his inconsistency with a bland expression, and
the talk dropped. Twenty-Mile Rock was just ahead. Spurring off
the road toward it, Tracy looked down at the surrounding dust and
rejoined the others with a more sober face. "They didn't stop to
water. That means hurry. Bill, somebody tipped over the apple
cart up yonder on the plateau."</p>

<p>"Apple cart's always gettin' tipped over in this infernal
country," growled Vivian.</p>

<p>Farther on, at the point where TS rim road climbed Mogul's
fault, Hugh detoured again, seeking the story on the earth. But
the risen dust was like a signal arrow along the desert road;
Shadrow's men hadn't gone up the sharp climb. "Headin' through my
place," observed Tracy shortly, and increased the pace. A change
came over the party; there was no more talk. Willy Bones raked
the foreground with his sharp, blue-eyed face, and Tracy, once
casting an appraising glance at the youth, found no sign of
apprehension. The kid had grit. Somewhere in a short life he had
been seasoned. As for Bill Vivian, that red-headed stormy petrel
was a tower of strength. He was a fighter through and through;
rash of talk and often impetuous in action, he yet understood
when to play a cool, heady game. And there was no man in the
Powder who so clearly knew all the devious devices and stratagems
of sagebrush warfare.</p>

<p>The long road fled straightaway toward the foot slopes of the
spur. Nothing breaking his thoughts, Tracy had time to wonder
again about Lynn Isherwood. Her appearance with Shadrow had been
a shock; and there followed now a whole train of puzzling
queries. Considering her plain warning to him, he could see that
she had never meant to deceive him. Whatever her position in the
Shadrow scheme was, she thoroughly understood it. But the thing
that kept returning to him, wherever his reasoning led, was the
stamped fear visible on her cheeks as she had gone galloping out
of Antelope. Deeper and deeper the mystery became, and of one
thing he became increasingly sure: she was not happy in her
place. Powder's arrogant force pressed on her too.</p>

<p>Bill Vivian spoke quietly&mdash;always a sign of that bantam's
focused interest. "Hugh, they went through your place, all
right."</p>

<p>"Straight on to the Testervis range, then," said Hugh. "Last
night I saw around thirty men ridin' mighty quiet into the broken
country."</p>

<p>"So that's what I heard," grunted Vivian. "There was a
shot."</p>

<p>"Mine. I figured to warn the patrols Morgan Testervis had out.
I believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, canting his head aside. Out of the high distance a
dwindling echo ran. One, spreading and vanishing. Vivian stared
at Hugh, green eyes alive. "The ball opens," he murmured.</p>

<p>There was then a long lull in which the steady pound of their
horses' hoofs and the squeal of their saddle leather
strengthened. They reached the first climb of the spur, and as
they did so, a long and ragged burst of firing rose from the
higher horizon. "Not so far off;" muttered Hugh and led the
others into the pines.</p>

<p>"A little due care," warned Vivian.</p>

<p>Hugh charged around the last bend of the trail and reached the
back of his house. Vivian promptly swung left to hit the other
side, too old a hand at this sort of game to need prompting.
Willy Bones, taking his cue, jumped from the saddle and went
ducking and dodging toward the barn. Already on the ground, Hugh
took a quick glance through the side window of the house and
found it empty. Thereupon he ran for the porch, to meet Vivian in
full charge from the other side.</p>

<p>"They went on."</p>

<p>"Right through the yard," agreed Hugh.</p>

<p>Willy Bones trotted back from the barn. "She's empty."</p>

<p>Vivian winked at Hugh. "You'd think he done this all his born
days."</p>

<p>Hugh lifted his head. The yonder firing had settled to a
steady, detonating roll&mdash;somehow indicating a deadlocked
affair. Weighing the sound, he guessed the point of trouble to be
around the rock cairn, along the broken gullies where shelter was
to be so easily had; fifty men, by the least reckoning, dug in
and sniping away. Accustomed as he was to Powder's stormy
history, the significance of what went on up there sobered him.
The last pretense at legal method, the last vestigial remnant of
orderliness, had been thrust aside. What happened now was open,
bold. It was anarchy, the grimmest kind of survival by force.</p>

<p>Bill Vivian suddenly said: "Grass dies if you stand on it too
long."</p>

<p>"We're going up there."</p>

<p>"I knew that. But why ponder at length?"</p>

<p>"Gettin' my conscience squared, maybe. Bill, you realize
what's happening?"</p>

<p>Vivian's answer was a full and complete echo of himself.
"Black's black. It's right or it's wrong. Don't clutter up your
head with doubt or consideration. What's goin' to happen is goin'
to happen. You're dead or you're alive."</p>

<p>"Willy," said Hugh, "you're sure you want to proceed? Nine
miles straight across to the Powder rim and you're out of
it."</p>

<p>"To live to a green old age and tell your grandchildren about
a couple of tough mugs you once knew," drawled Vivian.</p>

<p>"Back up, Bill," grunted Hugh. "This ain't half so funny.
Well, Willy?"</p>

<p>"What did I do that wasn't right?" complained Willy.</p>

<p>"Catamount's cub!" applauded Vivian, on the run for his horse;
and Hugh made an accepting gesture of his arm. "I'm sorry, Willy.
Come on."</p>

<p>The firing meanwhile had risen in pitch, vibrations crackling
through the intense heat of the day. When they reached the trees
and passed up the trail there was a momentary muffling of volume.
But that was only the interim calm, the prelude to a fresh fury
leaping into their faces once they arrived at the upper limit of
the pines and stood in that arena-like space below the rim of the
plateau. Each echo sailed over them flat and crisp. Beyond them,
out of sight, roiling currents of sound eddied and reverberated.
Even Vivian, casual and canny a fighter as he was, drew up his
pony, to stare at Tracy with a face wholly absorbed by
thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>"That's close," he muttered. "An' damn bitter."</p>

<p>Hugh paused only a moment, calculating the routes open. Then,
pointing his pony at the rubble causeway&mdash;up which he had
gone two nights before to find Lynn Isherwood&mdash;he raced
forward.</p>

<p>"Watch out!" yelled Vivian. "Come back here!"</p>

<p>Tracy saw nothing above; but the urgency in his partner's
voice was so great that he sheered off from the causeway and
galloped into the pines, where the other two had gone. Vivian was
on the ground. Rifle steadied beside a tree trunk, he watched the
rim ahead. "Somebody's racin' for the trail, Hugh."</p>

<p>No sooner said than verified. Half a dozen horsemen swooped
into sight, riding the very margin of the rim. At the causeway's
upper end they came to a piled-up stop, studying the natural
arena below; one of the group pointed. A rapped-out exclamation
reached down.</p>

<p>"Shadrow's men all right," muttered Hugh. "Lookin' for trouble
in this direction."</p>

<p>Vivian kicked over the rifle safety with his thumb. The
fiddling restlessness so much a part of him had gone out, and he
stood with his feet apart, bantam body relaxed against the tree,
absolutely sure and confident. Willy Bones had picked another
tree and watched Tracy in solemn attention. Hugh shook his head,
studying the group above and listening to a fight that seemed now
to fall away to a farther distance. It had lessened perceptibly
in the passing moments, softened its tone. The shots came spaced
and deliberate. Hearing all this, Tracy shook his head again with
a profound and bitter sadness. He knew what the end was to be.
Those clapping echoes of the fight were receding into Testervis
country.</p>

<p>There was another indistinguishable murmur from the group
above, and all of them wheeled and galloped away. Willy Bones,
eager to do his part, started out of the timber and was next
moment pinned in his tracks by Bill Vivian's swift negative.</p>

<p>"Why, ain't we&mdash;" stuttered the kid.</p>

<p>"You wait for the general's orders," reproved Bill. "They's
two-three tricks in this game you ain't learned yet."</p>

<p>One long, reaching echo rolled over the rim; and afterwards a
queer silence pulsed through the dead, air layers. Hugh Tracy
turned and stared at Vivian. "It's over, Bill."</p>

<p>Vivian had been reading the sounds, too, "Goodbye,
Testervis."</p>

<p>"Yeah," muttered Hugh. "I bet on the wrong horse. Now we
better go back to the house and wait for our spankin'.
No&mdash;wait! Willy, pull your horse deeper into the bushes.
Watch out, Bill!"</p>

<p>A single rider appeared on the rim and tipped down the
causeway, hatless, flinging his quirt at every other jump. Hugh
suddenly ran into the cleared area and waved his arm. "Happy,
slow down!"</p>

<p>The rider flinched back in his saddle; then, recognizing Hugh,
he rushed forward and literally threw the pony on its haunches.
Sweat ran down his face like tears, and the thick dust lay in
mottled patches on his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Happy, where's your outfit?" snapped Hugh.</p>

<p>"Gone!" yelled Happy. "Scattered to hell and gone! We got
licked, Hugh!" The high breathing of the man turned to a choked
spasm. There could be no doubt of it, this Happy was crying.
"Watch for yourself, boys! We're through! Morgan Testervis is a-
layin dead up there with a bullet in his chest!" And he charged
past them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER 7. &mdash; APPLIED FORCE</h2>

<p class="first">IT WAS one of the repeated ironies of Tollgate
John Isherwood's rather sorry life that he should, the week
before a not unexpected death in Nevada, consign his daughter,
Lynn, to Tade Shadrow's "kindly and influential care" along with
certain properties to be held by Tade in trusteeship until the
girl was twenty-three years old. Having no faith at all in a
woman's ability, Tollgate John had exercised the privilege of
relationship and called on Shadrow, who was Lynn's uncle and only
kin in the West. He never knew Shadrow's character, for it was in
his lifetime a matter of pride that over in the vast reaches of
southeast Oregon there lived one of the clan who controlled the
resources of a small empire. He thought he had made admirable
provisions; and so thinking, he turned his face to the wall with
the first actual peace of his lifetime. Directly after his
passing, not long following Hugh Tracy's ambush, Lynn Isherwood,
with her roped trunk and her pleasant expectations, arrived at
TS.</p>

<p>The first interview with this dissembling, avaricious man in
the ramshackle desolation of that ranch house dispelled the
pleasantness. She knew instantly there could be nothing kindly
here. Within forty-eight hours she knew, too, that her life was
pitched in a rough and violent and broadmouthed company: She was
the only woman in a household through which hard, unscrupulous
men tramped at any hour of the day or night. The treacheries, the
whispered arguments, the whole round of Tade Shadrow's restless
and conspiring activities came to her, even through the thin
partitions of her room. A fighter herself, she had no weapons.
All she could do was use a woman's patience and wait for some
turn of events shadowed in the uncertain future. Soon enough
realizing there was trouble afoot, it was the more strongly
brought home to her when Shadrow one day peremptorily ordered her
never to ride more than five miles from the quarters. This was
oppressive, deadening, and there was no escape. Only once did she
rebel. Shadrow, never a man to waste money, gave her the
storeroom keys and in effect told her she was to be housekeeper,
cook, and general chatelaine, Under any other condition, she
would have embraced the chance. Here, she knew what drudgery
meant, and so she threw the keys in his face and rode her coal-
black horse furiously out across the plateau, leaving her
astonished uncle with a resentful knowledge that for once he was
balked and could not enforce the law he laid down. Thus the
situation stood.</p>

<p>She rode into Antelope that morning with the outfit, unaware
of the developing trouble. Being in the courthouse, she missed
the keyed-up scene developing around Tracy. But the call to arms
brought her out and down the street, and she saw him then, at
once comprehending his risk. Swept along by the party, she heard
enough pass between her uncle and his two lieutenants to know
what was ahead. At the rim road Shadrow curtly commanded her to
go home; and accordingly she swung up the grade, watched the
cavalcade race on, and in time reached the empty house.</p>

<p>Unpleasant enough when occupied, it seemed even more dismal
empty. A sweltering heat invaded every room, powdered dust lay
over everything. Contemplating flight often, she thought of it
again, but rejected the idea quickly enough. Shadrow's long arm
reached far out. Not a soul within fifty miles dared offer her
shelter, and she knew too little of the land to risk a run-and-
hide game.</p>

<p>Beyond dusk they came back, cantering easy style across the
flats. Framed in the doorway, she watched them swing around the
yard and dismount. Rough humor ran along the twilight. They
seemed in high spirits, and she knew they had won. Even so, they
had paid a price, for one hand led seven empty-saddled ponies
toward the great barn. The group split toward the bunkhouses.
Shadrow, the foreman, and Maunders came to the house, followed by
another pair. Slipping back, Lynn went to her own room and closed
the door, leaning against it. All her fear of this black place
returned, and she felt indescribably alone, helpless. The men
stamped into the office. Shadrow's grumbling seeped through the
partition, and something fell to the floor.</p>

<p>Placed by the door, body rigid, it suddenly occurred to her
that what they had done was only a part of what they would do;
inevitably Hugh Tracy's fortunes came to her mind. And perhaps
tonight her uncle might reveal his plans toward a man of whom he
never bothered to conceal his dislike, Thinking of that, Lynn
doubled one white fist and moved to the inner wall of the
bedroom. They were speaking now, but the words were blurred, All
that came through the partition distinctly was a quick harsh
laugh. For a while she stood there; then, the risk of it leaving
her a little breathless, she slipped to the door, opened and
passed through it. The dark hall led out to a living room and
thence to the porch. The other way it went toward an offset
kitchen; and a little short of that was a right-angled corridor
reaching another entry to the office. A sliver of light gushed
through the bottom of the closed kitchen door, and she heard the
cook banging pans on the stove; moving to the lesser corridor,
she took three quick steps and crouched against the office door.
Shadrow's desk was directly beyond it. She heard him talking.</p>

<p>"That's wrong, Sid. They're scattered all to hell, but they'll
collect again."</p>

<p>Maunders's answering voice displayed impatience. "Then why
didn't we follow and bust 'em up? Either you stop on what you've
got or else you go do the job a second time."</p>

<p>"You're a fool at any sort of thinkin'," said Shadrow calmly.
"Have a drink, boys."</p>

<p>They moved about, glasses tinkling against a bottle. A long
pause followed, interrupted by Shadrow. "I never stop on what
I've got. I never get enough and never will. You should know me
better."</p>

<p>"Then we have to make another pitched fight of it?"</p>

<p>"One thing you need to learn, Sid. Let the other man move
first and make his mistake. I was always mighty careful of Morgan
Testervis, for he was a damned watchful fellow. But he's dead,
see? And the rules we used on him ain't good any more."</p>

<p>Silence settled. Lynn heard her uncle breathing heavily. He
moved around, chair squealing; and he resumed the thread of his
thought, "They'll collect at the Testervis place. Of course they
will. But it won't ever be the same ranch, don't forget that.
About half of those duffers will skip the country. We've put the
fear of God in 'em, you bet we have. So it's a weak ranch now.
And it won't have Morgan to keep it goin'. He was the only one
that counted. Put this in your hat. We can run our cattle five
miles south of the cairn and never provoke a fight. They won't
dare. We got that job done."</p>

<p>"And that's the extent of it?" asked one of the other punchers
Lynn didn't know.</p>

<p>"I pay you thirty dollars a month," said Shadrow
contemptuously, "and that's all you're worth. We're not finished
with the job. We keep on goin'. But we wait to see what Bat
Testervis does first. Ain't I said, wait out the other fellow?
Well, we won't have to wait long. Bat's a fool. Either he gets
reckless and busts into a fight without any figurin' beforehand,
or else he quits cold. You can't tell about him except to say
whatever he does will be premature and flighty. Never was a lick
of sense in him."</p>

<p>Lake Tolbert's dead drawl came into the conversation for the
first time. "You ain't completed this chore yet. There's Hugh
Tracy."</p>

<p>Maunders cursed. "The man's shot with luck! We had him and we
lost him! Next time&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tolbert said: "I tell you something. Tracy's a bigger problem
than the Testervis outfit right now."</p>

<p>"Don't speak such damn nonsense!" yelled Shadrow, suddenly
touched on a sore spot.</p>

<p>"Tell you something more," went on Tolbert with that same
down-pressing calm. "Miss him a third time and you'll never get
him. Hugh's got no fear of any man that walks in pants. Be
careful, Tade. He's your immediate business and will be till you
salt him down. Leave him loose and you'll wake up one mornin'
shot to pieces."</p>

<p>"One man?" scoffed Shadrow. "What's the matter with you,
Tolbert?"</p>

<p>"A hunch. He's one man, sure. But he can get more scrappers
together in a minute to fight you than anybody else could. This
country takes Hugh for a winner."</p>

<p>Lynn's heart leaped: Shadrow's chair banged violently against
the door, and she heard him tramping back and forth, directly
beyond it. Yet she clung to her place, waiting for something to
come.</p>

<p>"If he had sense he'd be out of the valley now," growled
Shadrow. "He ain't a fool. I told him what to expect."</p>

<p>"And he laughed in your face," said Maunders, taking up
Tolbert's line of thought. "There sure has been a mistake made,
and I'm the man that is going to suffer for it. He's pointed at
me. That misplay in Antelope was your fault, Tolbert. I had it
worked right until you refused to give the high sign."</p>

<p>"With Vivian layin' his sights on me? I like my skin."</p>

<p>"And there's another trouble-maker," grunted Maunders.
"Dammit, this business gets worse."</p>

<p>"Where's Tracy apt to be now, Tolbert?" demanded Shadrow.</p>

<p>"Unless I'm wrong," drawled Tolbert, "you'll find him on his
place, forted up and waitin', That's why I said you wasn't
finished with this particular business yet."</p>

<p>Shadrow's boots stamped into the wooden floor. Apparently the
chair was in his way, for it struck the door again so hard that
the latch jumped out of its seat. Light gushed instantly through
the widening aperture. Lynn's hand checked the door, and she
wheeled silently back from certain discovery. So near had it been
that she caught a momentary glance of her uncle's
face&mdash;deeply lined and a fire-glow of anger in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Maunders," said he, "this is your fight. You've made a hash
of it too many times. Get a dozen men and go back. If he's there,
take care of him right. Burn the condemned place."</p>

<p>"Me again?" muttered the gunman. "How about Tolbert takin' a
crack at it?"</p>

<p>"What do I pay <i>you</i> for?" challenged Shadrow.</p>

<p>The venom in the question stung the big-bodied lieutenant. He
snapped back: "All right! I'll show you monkeys! But I'll stand
for no more advice! Every time I been told how to do it. Now I'm
goin' to go at it my way!"</p>

<p>"Fine," said Tolbert dryly.</p>

<p>The girl had enough. She backed down the short corridor and
ran through the black hall as far as the living room. For a
moment she stopped, exploring the dark shadows with her glance.
Seeing nothing, she ran out a rear doorway and around the corner
of the house. Maunders's square torso moved ahead of her,
diagonally over the yard, and he was calling out the names of
certain men in a fuming, arrogant voice.</p>

<p>Maunders she hated enough to shoot; but it was Lake Tolbert
who inspired in her something far deeper&mdash;a dread, an actual
creeping of the flesh. The man's eyes were blank. They denied
light; they repulsed warmth or feeling. Yet this very impassivity
spoke of inner emotions avariciously hoarded. And as she slowly
crossed toward the small barn where Shadrow kept his own saddle
horses, it was Tolbert she feared more than the dull,
unimaginative Maunders. The foreman seemed to see everything, to
have in his utter silence a comprehension of all that passed on
TS. Thus it was with half relief and half apprehension that she
reached the stable, groped in the dark for her pegged gear, and
hastily saddled her favored coal-black. Leading him out a far
end, she walked a good hundred yards onto the plateau before
mounting After that she drifted it like distance before clipping
the animal with her heels. At this prompting the black went
breasting away to the northwest, toward Hugh Tracy's place. The
last thing she heard from the ranch was Maunders's heavy summons
to his men.</p>

<p>The moment she entered the stable, Tolbert moved from an
obscure angle of the porch and lifted a cupped cigarette to his
mouth, turning his attention to Maunders out in the middle of the
yard. He had seen the girl cross to the stable&mdash;the rest was
obvious. Such was the mind of this foreman, grinding exceedingly
small the acts and the words of those about him. One thing led to
another, and all things answered to plan; there was no such
phenomenon in the world as a meaningless act. He knew what others
did or were likely to do because, long before the players fell to
their parts, he had weighed them in the cold balance of his mind.
Daily seeing them react, he understood what lures attracted them
most surely, what impulses dominated their natures, what passions
rode them hardest. Others spoke and revealed themselves. Tolbert
locked himself in rigid silence and looked on. This night in the
office he had stood at his usual place by the wall as a spectator
rather than a performer; and, so placed, he saw Shadrow kick the
chair into that near-by door, and he saw the door, flying open,
suddenly recoil from a gentle pressure on the other side. Full of
argument, none of the others caught that, but he did, and the
gears of his brain instantly meshed and began a relentless
revolving.</p>

<p>He guessed the girl might be hidden there to listen.</p>

<p>She was the lone outlander on the ranch, the one rebel.
Therefore, she would be the one person to do such a thing.
Naturally, a desire to know what Shadrow was about had brought
her to the risky position. But what fed that desire? No idle
emotion, certainly. Profoundly shrewd as to people, Tolbert made
another long guess. She had ridden the plateau considerably. She
possibly had met Hugh Tracy. Indeed, he believed she had. Well,
Tracy was a rebel, too; and these two people were young and
healthy and attractive. The rest was simple. If she had spunk
enough to listen in, she had spunk enough to convey what she
heard. Tolbert never underestimated the fiber of Lynn Isherwood.
All this pieced together, he stepped to the porch and drew back,
placing his eyes on that spot where she was likely to appear if
his reasoning was sound. She appeared there. It was that
elementary.</p>

<p>What was not so elementary was the foreman's subsequent act.
He remained on the porch until Maunders had gotten his men
roused. Then, seeing the gunman tramp back to his horse by the
main house, Tolbert shifted ahead and immediately caught the
other's attention. Maunders motioned to the office and asked a
subdued question. "Where's the old man?"</p>

<p>"Eatin'."</p>

<p>Maunders expelled a sharp blast of breath. "He's foolin'
himself, Lake. He thinks we're goin' right ahead steamroller
style. But I'm damned if we are. We've hit a snag. When thirty
men can't handle three, it's time to do some thinkin'. I don't
like it. They's a smell in the breeze. Call it a hunch, call it
anything, but we've missed Hugh Tracy too many times.
That&mdash;" and Maunders rolled out a guttural, descriptive
oath. "He's pretty near bullet-proof. And I'm the man that's
going to be hunted like a jackrabbit if he starts a snipin'
contest."</p>

<p>Tolbert let the silence drag out. It was a trick of his, to
build up suspense into which his words would fall with good
effect. "Listen. Tracy's at his place."</p>

<p>"How in thunder do you know?" challenged Maunders.</p>

<p>"Figure it out. Ever hear of Tracy runnin'? No. He'll scrap.
Where will he scrap? At his ranch. So he's there."</p>

<p>"You're a long-headed cuss," said Maunders, grudging the
approval.</p>

<p>"He's there. But if you try to sneak up from shelter you won't
do anything but warn him. He won't be expectin' you to
come&mdash;not after the hard day we've had. He'll be off guard.
Go to the trees and bust out into his clearin' fast. Catch him
sleepin'."</p>

<p>Maunders's suspicion, always half roused, came strongly to the
fore. "Why this kindly advice, Lake?"</p>

<p>Tolbert drew a slow breath of smoke, expelled it. "Boggle this
time, Sid, and Shadrow will land on you with both feet. He's
pretty sore about Tracy."</p>

<p>It was Maunders's turn to remain silent. He came a little
closer, peering up at the foreman's obscure cheeks, trying to
catch some telltale expression. But it was futile, and he fell to
surreptitious talk.</p>

<p>"You don't fool me, Tolbert. You ain't workin' here for
love&mdash; no more than me. What's up your sleeve?"</p>

<p>"What would be?" parried Tolbert, expressionless.</p>

<p>"I dunno. Can't see the cards you're playin'. But, brother, I
know damn well you're playin' 'em. Let a man in the game,
Lake."</p>

<p>"Poppycock."</p>

<p>"Lone hand, uh?" muttered Maunders. "Well, I didn't think
you'd be that foolish. Don't you know it's what Shadrow
wants&mdash; you and me pullin' apart? He never lied when he said
you was to watch me and I was to watch you. Get wise to it."</p>

<p>"Don't try to cross him, Sid. Can't be done."</p>

<p>"You're a fool," said Maunders.</p>

<p>"Wiser than you. I know my limits, and I know Shadrow. He's
got us both watched all the time."</p>

<p>Maunders pivoted his big body, staring into the shadows. After
that he climbed to his horse and reined around. Tolbert emitted a
soft warning. "Don't creep up. Bust down there&mdash;and you
better not make a foozle of it this time."</p>

<p>Maunders galloped away, drawing his men behind.</p>

<p>Tolbert had detained him a good ten minutes behind Lynn
Isherwood. Tolbert had lied to him about Tracy's
unpreparedness&mdash; for Tracy would be prepared. In that small
round head of the foreman a thought flipped over and found its
place. Pinching out his smoke, he went to the mess hall, thawing
to a reserved affability during the meal.</p>

<p>Lynn knew the road well, and the coal-black went along it at
an unchecked pace. Once the never-quite-absent fear of Shadrow's
vengeful power so startled her that she stopped dead and
listened. But nothing came out of the long sweep of night save
the far-off ululating chant of a coyote; and after it died there
was only the gentle run of the western wind. Of the darkness
itself she had no apprehensions. This was her kind of country,
and she loved it. The isolation, the long distances, the raw
flame of day, and the mystery of the star-swept heavens
overhead&mdash;these bold contrasts and this generous amplitude
made up a world of supreme wonders. Born into it, she could
conceive no other as satisfying. It was a splendid
world&mdash;out-flung, majestic, beautiful in its own barbaric
style; and even in the league upon league of utterly barren
range, where water was not and life could not exist, and upon
which the full swelter of the sun lifted mirage after mirage, she
saw the mark of prodigal beauty. Another might come here and
stand oppressed by the actual desolation; it never occurred to
her that this was desolation. There was a deep, profound rhythm
to the land, and she felt it.</p>

<p>For a while she half forgot the trouble that had put her on
the road. But it came back to her as she drew into the rough
surfaces of Mogul near the spur. She found the trail leading down
toward Tracy's after slow exploration, and at the tree line she
pulled the pony to a slow drift. No sound came from behind; no
light winked out of the house ahead, and a heavy sensation of
discouragement passed through her. To see Hugh, if only for a
moment, meant some lightening of her load, some break in the long
monotony; it was compensation for the risk of Tade Shadrow's evil
temper when she returned to face him. Considerably let down, she
halted at the edge of the meadow and dropped a soft, call into
the stillness:</p>

<p>"Hugh." The answer was immediate, enormously heartening.
Hugh's voice struck out of an angle by the barn. "Easy, boys.
Lynn, what in thunder&mdash;" She heard him running across the
yard. Going on, she saw the solid outline of the man appear
beside her horse. A hand reached up, gripped her arm. She stepped
down.</p>

<p>"What did you come for?" said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Maunders is on the way with some men&mdash;about a dozen, I
think."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I overheard Tade tell him."</p>

<p>"And you risked it?" muttered Hugh. The concern and anger of
his words furnished her with an odd sense of happiness. "Lynn,
I've got enough on my conscience without adding any more. Don't
you know what Shadrow will do to you?"</p>

<p>"He'll only think I've been roaming. He's used to it."</p>

<p>"But if he finds out&mdash;" muttered Tracy and stopped. After
a while he called back: "Bill, did you hear that?"</p>

<p>"Ahuh."</p>

<p>"Everybody I touch gets into grief," rumbled Tracy. "You can't
stay, but if you go back you're not safe."</p>

<p>She had made her own decisions for so long, and she had been
friendless for so long, that it was like luxury to stand idle and
hear Tracy shoulder her problems. Yet it was a forbidden luxury,
and she recalled herself with a small sense of guilt. "No, I'm
going back. He won't find out. He could do nothing if he
did."</p>

<p>"In the first place, how did you get on that ranch?" She told
him in swift, brief phrases. Tracy said: "He's your trustee? That
wolf? What kind of a world is it when such things are allowed to
be? Lynn, is there no other place you can go?"</p>

<p>"None, Hugh."</p>

<p>"Foolish question on my part. You couldn't get away now
anyhow."</p>

<p>She caught the upthrust of his glowering rebellion, and once
more that little sense of guilty happiness came to color the
night and its trickeries.</p>

<p>"I can't do a thing;" muttered Tracy. "Not a thing! Lynn, it's
a damnable pass! There is no shelter here for you. Not a bit of
safety anywhere around me."</p>

<p>"I'm going back. Don't worry about it, Hugh. He will discover
nothing."</p>

<p>"That wolf," grunted Tracy. "He's a bloody man, Lynn. Today:
he killed off Morgan Testervis, who was a thousand times better
than Tade ever will be. He's broken down all opposition."</p>

<p>"Except us," came a dry voice from the darkness.</p>

<p>"Except us," repeated Hugh slowly.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" demanded Lynn. "Not stay? Oh, no!
You aren't able to do that. Tade fears you. Tolbert told him
nothing was settled until you were out of the way. You see? He
won't stop until he has you. It's impossible to hold against
him."</p>

<p>"Impossible," came Bill Vivian's casual voice, "is a funny
word. Come to study it close and what do you find? Why, that most
of the darned thing is 'possible.'"</p>

<p>"Time's goin'," said Hugh. "When you get to the top of the
trees, Lynn, take the causeway and swing wide of the trail."</p>

<p>"Hugh," said the girl wistfully. All their meetings came to
such abrupt ends. Never was there a promise of a next time, least
of all now. She wanted to say something and didn't know what it
was to be. But Tracy, pressed by anxiety, took her arm, urged her
back to the saddle. Sitting there, she caught the black mass of
his hair and the square lines of the tilted features.</p>

<p>"If you've got to run away," said Hugh quickly, "remember
this. Follow the Testervis road beyond the rock cairn. As far as
the first heavy stand of pines. Swing off the road when you hit
the trees&mdash;swing to your left and keep going until you come
to a quarried-out clearing. I'll try to make it every few days.
You've got to hustle now, Lynn."</p>

<p>She wanted to make it a cheerful good-bye. But what she said
was, "I don't see anything but defeat for us, Hugh! Oh, be so
careful!" The grip of his palm increased and fell away, and she
spurred into the timber. All the buoying power of his presence
ended, the trees were abysmally black. Suddenly and
overwhelmingly afraid, she lashed the black and pounded up to the
arena. The horse swung toward the fissure trail, resisting her
rein pressure. When she fought him to the causeway, the charge of
his hoofs lifted great eddies of sound, and it seemed as if all
the world could hear. Half in panic, she arrived at Mogul's
surface and plunged into the dark emptiness. A quarter-mile
beyond the road she halted.</p>

<p>Maunders was out there, passing by. Soft repercussions crossed
the flat and faded. There was, afterwards, no sound at all. Lynn
gripped the reins and listened with a straining attention, every
impulse holding her to the spot until some inkling of Tracy's
fortune was borne back. But TS and the inevitable scene with
Shadrow was something she dared not longer postpone. So, curling
to the road, she set out at a gallop. Long afterwards there was
some firing behind, damped by the distance. She counted two
distinct bursts and a ragged after-volley. Then silence came, and
she urged the horse to a faster gait, afraid new that Maunders
might return and overtake her.</p>

<p>The girl gone, Hugh strode into the house and lighted alamp,
placing it before a window. After that, he returned to the yard
and paused a moment by Bill Vivian, whose station was behind a
porch end. Willy Bones, troubled about something, called from the
barn: "Anything up?"</p>

<p>"Wait it out, Willy. And no more talkin'. Don't leave your
place, no matter what happens."</p>

<p>Bill Vivian rose from a crouch and stamped his feet on the
dirt. "Women," said he, softly, "constitute a large portion of
the globe. But what of it? So does sagebrush. Ain't we got enough
to unscramble as is?"</p>

<p>"He's a wolf," muttered Tracy, thinking of Shadrow.</p>

<p>"It's a rotten universe and no order in it when a thing like
that can happen. A trustee for that girl&mdash;imagine it,
Bill."</p>

<p>Vivian never troubled himself with reflection. "Never mind the
universe, Hugh. It's the bow-legged ants which are men so-called
that make all the grief."</p>

<p>Hugh whirled and headed for the water trough on the run, some
faint alarm in the trees coming to him. He reached the trough and
seized the rifle standing beside it.</p>

<p>Vivian's gun lock clicked through a dead stillness that was
the next moment burst apart by a slashing of brush and the
rolling stampede of hoofs. They came out of the trees in a
breasting line, their shadows cleaving the mass of night; and
they came in full voice. Maunders yelled, that strident and
arrogant tone recognizable anywhere. Two streaming points wedged
into the clearing, one racing for the house, the other swinging
wide of the water trough. Hugh Tracy, throwing up his rifle,
smashed a bullet into a down-bearing figure and saw the man
flinch. The yelling ceased instantly, and all the yard shuddered
with a concerted firing. His target fell, the horse raced
riderless by. Another target came on, boiling up the water of the
trough with one shot and another. Utterly cold, Tracy caught the
man no more than ten feet away, caught him solidly in the body.
Willy Bones was shouting from the barn, and over there a
recoiling fringe of Maunders's riders drummed the boards with a
hot volleying. Worried&mdash;and free of attack at that
moment&mdash;Tracy swung about and raked the agitated darkness by
that structure. Something smashed against the house behind him,
but Vivian was holding fast and he had no concern. A horseman
galloped out of the mass by the barn, wheeled and charged
straight for Tracy. A jet of muzzle fire bloomed in his face and
the wash of the bullet stung his cheek in passing by. Willy Bones
cried again, openly defiant. But as suddenly as it had started,
it was over; no more rush and pound behind him, no more weaving
bodies ahead. Turning a complete circle, he saw nothing upon
which to pin a shot. There were a whipping and a crushing of
brush and a final retort from one gun; then the beat of hoofs
died into the upper slopes, and silence rushed in.</p>

<p>"Bill," snapped Hugh. "Willy."</p>

<p>He heard Willy swearing in a pleased way; and Vivian's drawl
reached him&mdash;relieving a quick apprehension. "How about it,
Mister Tracy?" said Bill. "Ever know of the time when a good
little man couldn't lick a good big one?"</p>

<p>Tracy paced slowly toward the house. "It's the first open
fight, Bill. And we were lucky, breakin' even."</p>

<p>"Even?" protested Bill Vivian. "We drove 'em off, didn't
we?"</p>

<p>"We drove 'em off, but they win the place. That's even."</p>

<p>"What kind of arithmetic you usin'?" grumbled Vivian.</p>

<p>"They'll come again. Next time all of TS will be here. Next
time they can have it. From now on, Bill, this is a run-and-jump
affair. Come on&mdash;we move out."</p>

<p>Vivian grumbled but said nothing. He had always accepted
Hugh's leadership without question, and he did so now. Five
minutes later the three of them were riding single file through
the trees. Scouting the arena carefully, they pulled to the top
of Mogul's rim, and at that point Hugh curved to the northeast,
passed the rock cairn, and led away into the hidden reaches of
the night; saying nothing, full of heavy and rebellious
thoughts.</p>

<p>Bill said: "What's life but a lease on somethin' which ain't
permanent nohow? Me, I'm so far behind in my rent that any time I
cash in now I win."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER 8. &mdash; LOOSE ENDS</h2>

<p class="first">BILL VIVIAN drank a little cold coffee out of
the common can and wiped the beaded sweat from his face.
"Somebody," he grumbled, "says an empty stomach makes a clear
head for thinkin'. But what fool would bother about thinkin' in a
dumb country like this?"</p>

<p>From the ridge on which they were hidden, Mogul's tawny floor
lay visible east and west, throwing up heat whorls all the day
through. South, a bay of pines shut out whatever went on around
the spur; and to the north, where lay the Testervis ranch, the
low hills closed the horizon. Flat on his stomach, Hugh Tracy
watched the edges of distance. Throughout the morning nothing
happened; shortly afterwards the slow, fugitive shift of some
developing play began to make appearance. About one o'clock a
long banner of dust appeared over on TS territory, rolled
heavily, and subsided. For a long while the burning glare yonder
remained unbroken; but around three a steady point showed upon
the TS road, throwing a still thicker dust fog above, and
presently Tracy recognized the advance of a considerable body of
cattle. In another hour the driven herd swung to the east and the
intervening trees shut it from sight; but he knew Shadrow's
occupation of the spur had at last taken place.</p>

<p>Vivian, looking on, made his irritated observations. "And all
our bustin' around the landscape don't help us none. Cattle,
travelin' about three miles an hour, is the most permanent thing
I know of. The steam roller bears down, Hugh."</p>

<p>Tracy only nodded, for his ranging glance, not satisfied,
passed to the west. Something went on there as well. One rider
struck out of an arroyo and took up a rising and falling advance,
utilizing each low area he came upon. Still farther westward a
thin blur broke the brassy shield of light, stood suspended
against it a moment, and vanished. Meanwhile, the nearer rider
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Shadrow," opined Bill Vivian, "is goin' to take another hack
at the Testervis bunch."</p>

<p>Willy Bones said, "Look here," from the opposite side of the
depression&mdash;almost the only words he had spoken during the
day. Tracy and Vivian walked across the bowl together and lifted
themselves to the edge. Half a dozen riders came along the
Testervis road, appeared directly beneath the watchers, and
plunged into the southerly trees.</p>

<p>"On the scout," guessed Vivian. "And they'll come back twice
as fast when they see that herd."</p>

<p>He was mistaken. A long, dragging hour passed, and beyond six
the sun plunged from sight with all the smoky fury of a molten
body striking water. Twilight arrived, washing across the land in
long runnels of gray and steel-blue color. The distance was empty
of movement&mdash;and the Testervis hands made no reappearance.
Tracy turned from the edge of the depression.</p>

<p>"You waited all day," said Vivian, "and what for?"</p>

<p>"For a break we might use," answered Tracy.</p>

<p>"None came."</p>

<p>"None came," agreed Tracy. "You know what sort of a fight we
have to make, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Bite 'em on the tail and run like the devil."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Providin'," amended Vivian, "we ever get close enough to do
any bitin'. Shadrow knows what we're up against. He'll see we
don't get any chance to operate."</p>

<p>"He's got a young army," said Tracy, eyes half closed. "All of
them just paid hands. Ever hear of a paid hand riskin' his hide
when he couldn't see the profit in it?"</p>

<p>Vivian's eyes lighted, and he chuckled. "Snipe 'em&mdash;scare
'em&mdash;make 'em wonder where the next shot's comin' from. Now
you're talkin'. Move around. Do somethin'."</p>

<p>"That's half of it. Shadrow's no man to make his crew fight
out of loyalty. If we could put the fear of ambush, day and night
and any time at all, into the heads of those mugs, they'd start
runnin'."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Vivian heartily. "So we will, says old man
Vivian's little boy Bill."</p>

<p>"Back up," grunted Hugh. "You forget something."</p>

<p>"Listen. Don't lay any mature and deliberate plans, Mister
Tracy. It won't work. Nothin' in this condemned scope of alkali
and loco-weed stays put long enough to hook a plan on. You figure
somethin' out and blooey the next minute your figgerin' is all
wrong. You, stick your thumb on a situation, and by gosh it ain't
there when you look second time. No. Any sort of a plan's no
good. Best thing to do is take what comes and hack at it. Then
run and wait for somethin' else."</p>

<p>Tracy shook his head. "There's another side to the story.
Three men on that ranch we can't scare. Take all the pot shots we
want, do all the ridin' we want&mdash;Shadrow and his two
blackjacks are still squattin' right where they always squatted.
Nothing changes till they change."</p>

<p>"All right," said Vivian, impatient at such logic.</p>

<p>"What's the answer?"</p>

<p>"Wait for a break."</p>

<p>"We done it all day long. See a break yet? I don't."</p>

<p>"Or make one," added Hugh quietly.</p>

<p>Vivian turned a squint-eyed regard on Tracy. "You got some
stunt in your coco," he accused. "What is it?"</p>

<p>Tracy shrugged his big shoulders. "Don't know. But right now
I'm going over to see what the Testervis layout is. You boys stay
here: We can't afford to put all our eggs in one basket."</p>

<p>Vivian grinned again. "The eggs wouldn't bust. They're hard-
boiled." When Hugh got his horse and started out of the
depression, he added: "Bring back half a cow barbecued. I grunt
much better on a full stomach."</p>

<p>Tracy went through the last of the twilight and into an
enveloping nightfall. A half-mile farther along the ridge he
quartered down to the road, breasted a slight summit, and
proceeded through a darkling alley between pines. Testervis ranch
quarters were not much more than half an hour's quick run ahead,
and he let the pony stretch after the tedium of a day's waiting.
As for himself, the freedom of the saddle was a tonic for the
dammed-up restlessness in him. Like Vivian, he could not help
chafing at delay. He was not a man blessed by much patience, and
when, as at present, the tide of luck ran out it was nothing less
than punishment to withdraw from the only sure course of action
he understood, which was to strike back&mdash;risk his fortunes
and strike back Yet, unsettled and mordant as his temper was, he
knew Shadrow to be a shrewd and unforgiving enemy; an enemy with
patience and cunning and enormous power. He could not throw
himself against this unyielding wall; he had to find a breach in
it.</p>

<p>He could see no breach now, nor reason his way through to a
situation where one might logically exist. It seemed to him, in
fact, that the game had come to a deadlock. Shadrow could not
find him; he could not touch Shadrow. And as time passed, he,
Tracy, lost ground.</p>

<p>"Even now," concluded Tracy, "with nothing much to fear and
almost everything won, he will take no chances. Each advance he
makes will be supported, well defended."</p>

<p>The road curved out of the trees and ran along a straight
stretch before reaching another pine stand. Directly beyond that
was the Testervis place, and Hugh, knowing it would be guarded,
swung from the road and picked a careful route roundabout. He
watched for the glimmer of house lights, but he saw none; not
even when he drifted down a slope and halted at the margin of the
yard. Nothing moved, nor was there any rumor of activity. Always
ready to ride, the Testervis bunch usually kept a string of
saddled stock by the porch or by the corral, but as his eyes
adjusted themselves and reached to either location he found no
sign of horses.</p>

<p>For a long while he rested there, puzzled and
alert&mdash;waiting for some telltale signal to cross the
stillness. After a full ten minutes had passed fruitlessly by, he
chanced a soft challenge:</p>

<p>"Hello, house."</p>

<p>The echoes came back into his face, and he realized then that
as surely as Morgan Testervis was dead, so was the Double-O-on-a-
Rail. Headquarters had been abandoned.</p>

<p>He had no further curiosity. Turning, he retreated to the road
and went away at a steady gallop. What happened to the Testervis
hands he didn't know. What Bat's plan might be he couldn't
fathom, nor would he attempt to. It was sufficient knowledge that
the blond brother, throwing aside Morgan's entrenched
determination never to let the fight go back of home quarters,
had abandoned the place, It was a certain augury, and one small
article of hope in Hugh's head ceased to be important. The TS
tide would come rolling down, pause here, and sweep on to the
very limit of the Mogul plateau. If that house, symbol of
ownership, wasn't worth fighting for, then nothing was. Around no
other point would Bat ever be able to rally his men.</p>

<p>The road was in deeper darkness when Hugh left it and climbed
the bald ridge. A little uncertain of the footing, he sidled
across the spine of the high ground and about fifty yards from
the depression sent out a subdued hail. Evoking no reply, he
pressed on and entered the hideout.</p>

<p>"Bill."</p>

<p>The word sank like a plummet into the stillness. Suddenly
alarmed, he stepped to the ground and walked the whole length of
the depression. It was quite empty.</p>

<p>For a while he stood in his tracks, puzzling out this added
change. Need of water might have taken the men down the slope to
a spring near the pines; Testervis men passing by might have
drawn them from concealment; or the proximity of TS parties might
either have alarmed them or suggested the chance of a coup. But
if it had been water, one would have remained behind while the
other went away. There remained, then, the possibility of TS men
in the neighborhood. Turning, he crouched against the earth,
listening for whatever chance rumors might come over the rim.</p>

<p>It was a futile wait. But it was also a switching point in all
his calculations. During this long day there had been a great and
growing uneasiness that now, given the chance to crystallize,
usurped every other consideration. Once having thought to do
something, Hugh never dallied. Reaching into his pocket for a
scrap of paper and a pencil, he wrote a message there in the
sightless dark:</p>

<p><i>"Tomorrow morning."</i> </p>

<p>He made it no plainer, afraid of some alien eye discovering
it; and he laid it beneath a rock, one edge in view as nearly as
he could make out, Returning to his horse, he rode from the
depression.</p>

<p>"This scattering process," he said to himself, "has about
reached its conclusion. I'm left by myself."</p>

<p>Angling down the ridge, he quietly entered the trees, and made
a detour through them to that quarried-out place he had described
to Lynn Isherwood. But he found nothing there&mdash;had hoped for
nothing as a matter of fact; and he left it, satisfied that his
back trail was clear. More or less, he was squaring his
conscience for what lay ahead. Beyond the trees, he pointed into
the due south and went rapidly on. Once, at the very edge of
Mogul's rim, he looked down and saw the lights of his house
burning and a lantern bobbing across the yard.</p>

<p>Lynn Isherwood had reached TS quarters the previous night
without discovery and, supperless, went to bed. At any moment
expecting to have Shadrow call her out, she at last fell into so
deep a sleep that she never heard Maunders storm back, never
heard the wild echoes coming from Shadrow's office. Next morning
she woke late, eating after the others had finished; Shadrow was
gone, with his lieutenants and his crew. But a man sat idly by
the small barn, casting loose loops at two prongs of wood stuck
in a hay bale, and she knew, without testing her knowledge, what
he was for. The day dragged. There was nothing to do but turn up
the old thoughts and suppress the old apprehensions. In front of
a window she stared across Mogul's barren flat toward Hugh
Tracy's, wondering what had happened to him. Supper was late that
night, for it was beyond dusk when Shadrow and the outfit
returned; and though she sat at table with them, she heard no
news. They were far more silent than usual. Shadrow said nothing
at all, but from time to time she felt his eyes on her. It was a
long-drawn-out ordeal, short as that meal was. Afterwards she
went to her room, suddenly and profoundly fearful.</p>

<p>Shadrow had gone to his office. Through the partition she
caught the mingling of voices and the swift, angered
interjections. One man, one particular man, kept breaking in,
speaking louder and louder until the passionate, furious yell of
Shadrow made sense even where she stood:</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth!"</p>

<p>The bickering ceased; a long hush came. Then a man walked
across the room and out of it. She heard approaching steps in the
hall, a brief warning on the door. When, heart racing, she opened
it, Lake Tolbert confronted her, smooth face bleaker than usual.
"Your uncle," said he, "wants to see you."</p>

<p>She hated this man, nor could she ever meet his eyes without
instinctively thinking of a reptile's blinkless, unfathomable
glance: It made no difference that he presented toward her always
the outer indications of courtesy, that he never failed to lift
his hat or step aside at her passage; rather it only accented the
feeling she had of illicit, secretive emotions burning in him.
And it was odd to hear him follow her with a soft suggestion as
she stepped down the hallway.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't allow the presence of a few men to disturb your
peace of mind."</p>

<p>It meant nothing, yet she knew it meant something. Lake
Tolbert never said an idle phrase; and so, wondering, she walked
into Shadrow's office. Shadrow was there, with Maunders and three
other hands. The light of bracket lamps on either wall bit into
the turned faces, hardened and darkened them as they pointed at
her. Tolbert quietly closed the door, stepping toward a corner.
Shadrow's sagged cheeks were heavily flushed, and his narrowed
eyes held a telltale gleam Lynn had come to know and to fear more
than any other expression he wore.</p>

<p>"Lynn," he snapped, "where was you last night?"</p>

<p>She knew it had come. All that day the foreboding thought of
it had been hanging over her head. She knew she had to
lie&mdash;yet to speak as much truth as she could and to lie as
little as she dared, Shadrow was uncanny at catching the false
note.</p>

<p>"Here," said she.</p>

<p>"All evenin'?"</p>

<p>"Most of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you went out? Where to?"</p>

<p>She watched her uncle steadily. The other men were weighing
every expression on her face, judging every word she spoke. There
was no friendliness in the room, no charity, no allowance for the
fact that she was a woman. This was a man's ranch, and she had
felt the antagonism of its members ever since her arrival on it;
tonight all that antagonism seemed to burn into her. But she
watched her uncle, wondering what knowledge in the hard, scheming
brain of his was to trap her.</p>

<p>"I took the black and rode out to the south a ways."</p>

<p>"How far south?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Two-three miles, I suppose."</p>

<p>"You rode out of the ranch, hey? After dark. Knowin' all the
time this country is dangerous for ridin' alone?"</p>

<p>"Not for me," said Lynn quickly. "Why should it be?"</p>

<p>"You're a part of TS, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"No. I only live here."</p>

<p>"Bright answer," snorted Shadrow and pushed a pencil around
the desk with his restless fingers. "You never went north,
towards Hugh Tracy's?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Shadrow leaned forward, and at sight of his face Lynn turned
cold. "How was it," he demanded, "that you went away without
tellin' me? And how was it you got a horse so quiet that nobody
seen you go?"</p>

<p>"I made no particular effort to hide what I was doing," said
the girl. "You men were busy with your own troubles."</p>

<p>Shadrow snapped out another question: "Did you keep to the
road or strike across country?"</p>

<p>"I kept to the road, of course," said the girl, knowing that
he could never check her mark of travel in all the tangle of pony
tracks lying on the roadway.</p>

<p>"What time was it?"</p>

<p>"I never looked at my watch."</p>

<p>Shadrow said, with a deceptive unconcern: "Was it after we got
through talkin' in my office?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the girl, "how long you were in your
office."</p>

<p>Shadrow fell back against his chair with an air of being
balked and turned his hard old eyes on Maunders. The gunman
ripped an angry sentence at the room in general.</p>

<p>"Somebody's lyin'! Somebody put a bug in Tracy's ear! I rammed
right into a set trap and I lost three men!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Shadrow, a little uncertain, "he might have been
waitin' for some such play. It's natural he wouldn't sleep on the
job, ain't it? Not after you boys ribbed him in Antelope."</p>

<p>Maunders was not to be soothed. "It won't go. When I come back
I smelled dust ahead of me, all the way home. Somebody beat me to
this yard just by a few minutes. I tell you, Tade, there's a
nigger in the woodpile!"</p>

<p>All eyes turned on the girl again, raking her with a cruel
suspicion. Shadrow leaned forward, returning to his harshly
peremptory manner. "Lynn, you'd do a trick like that if you
could. You got no love for TS. If I thought you went out there to
put a bug in Tracy's ear I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lake Tolbert cleared his throat and spoke for the first time.
"She's right, Tade. I saw her get the black from the barn and
mosey south on the road. Saw her come back, too. About half an
hour afterwards."</p>

<p>Everybody in the room swung on the foreman except the girl.
Shadrow's restless, calculating eyes clung to Tolbert's face a
long moment. Maunders's stare freshened with bitterness.</p>

<p>"You was the man that told me to bust right down there and
take 'em by surprise," he challenged.</p>

<p>"It's the way I would have done it," said Tolbert quietly.</p>

<p>Shadrow rapped out an irritated question: "Why didn't you
speak up before, Lake?"</p>

<p>"She was tellin' her story," said the foreman. "I'm no hand to
butt in."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Then why say anything now?"</p>

<p>"There seems to be some doubt in the room," was Tolbert's
imperturbable answer.</p>

<p>The girl kept her face on Shadrow, not daring to look around
at the foreman. The shock of his words had struck clear through
her, and for a moment the room, its flittering light and its
sullen occupants, became an indistinguishable blur. She knew she
must have shown surprise, but the foreman's preliminary clearing
of his throat had turned attention away from her; and after that
she pulled herself together. Here was an ally. Yet it brought her
no sense of relief. She dreaded him all the more.</p>

<p>"What time was all this?" grunted Shadrow.</p>

<p>"After I left the office," said Tolbert. "After Maunders
pulled out."</p>

<p>Shadrow's eyes glinted; the lines of his face deepened: "Look
here. You say it was half an hour before she came back. How do
you know that? How could you see her come back? You was eatin'
with me."</p>

<p>"Wasn't there more than twenty minutes," said Tolbert. "When I
came out again she was just crossin' the yard from the barn."</p>

<p>"Something's rotten," grumbled Maunders. "And I'm the man
that's going to take it in the belly. Shadrow, your damned ranch
is out of kilter. Somebody's betrayin' you!"</p>

<p>"Me?" asked Tolbert, so toneless that Maunders hauled his big
body around and let his felted wrists fall loose beside him. "Be
careful what you hang on me," added Tolbert.</p>

<p>Shadrow's glance went prying into Tolbert's impassive face.
But there was nothing to be found on that unrevealing visage,
never was anything to be found on it. Shadrow rose from his
chair. "Lynn, get back to your room. And don't leave this yard
again unless I say so."</p>

<p>The girl turned, careful to avoid Tolbert's face, and opened
the door in front of her. When she closed it she heard talk rise
like a gust of wind. The living room was quite black, and some
small squealing sliver of sound in one corner sent another
current of fear through her. Hurried and full of apprehension,
she went to her room.</p>

<p>It was Maunders who broke into angry talk after she left. "You
might think everything is goin' fine, Shadrow, but it ain't!
Tracy's still loose."</p>

<p>"He's botherin' your peace of mind?" asked Tolbert, putting an
ironic slur in the words.</p>

<p>"There's no man that lives who bothers me!" shouted
Maunders.</p>

<p>Tolbert showed an unusual vigor. "Then quit squawkin'. And
don't lay that tongue of yours around so free."</p>

<p>Strained quiet came to the office. Maunders's flat features
swelled with inner rage, and his nostrils flared. Yet he said
nothing to the gangling foreman who confronted him with a stone-
cold attention; and it was Shadrow who broke the deadlock:</p>

<p>"Place gettin' too small for both of you boys? Dammit, stop
quarrelin'. I won't have it."</p>

<p>"I don't propose to be a sucker," growled Maunders.</p>

<p>Shadrow had a ready sarcasm for that: "Never tamper with the
Lord's disposition. What's bitin' you so much? I consider we're
doing well."</p>

<p>"Tracy's loose," repeated Maunders, unable to get that out of
his head. "And where's Bat Testervis? Just where is he?"</p>

<p>"Don't give him a second thought," said Shadrow. "He's doin'
what I knew he'd do. Instead of stickin' to his quarters he's
started some fool cavalry parade around the landscape. Inside of
two days he won't have a dozen men left. Nobody would fight
behind a plain fool like him. He's through. In the mornin' we're
swingin' into his place. This plateau's mine right now&mdash;and
what's the matter with that, Sid? For a big lump of nothing you
show an all-fired funny streak of fidgets."</p>

<p>"If I don't get him, he'll get me," grumbled Maunders.</p>

<p>"Tracy? You, bet he will." Shadrow's temper began to rise
again. "I never knew a man to ruin more chances than you have,
Sid. You either get him or pass out of the country. Anyhow, with
the Testervis bunch gone, it's time to cut the crew. I'm payin'
out too much wages. Your usefulness with me is about done, Sid.
Make your play and make it in a hurry."</p>

<p>Unimaginative as this man was, Sid Maunders possessed some
dark and obscure channels of intuition. He shook his head. "I
won't be able to ride away. Tracy's a damned Indian. It's gone
too far. He'd follow till I fell off the edge of creation. No, I
got to cramp him some place or he'll cramp me. And, by God,
Shadrow, that girl has brought nothin' but bad luck to this
joint. You better do somethin' about her."</p>

<p>Shadrow lifted his head, lip corners full of sly malice. "I
aim to."</p>

<p>"What's that?" broke in Tolbert.</p>

<p>"Marry her," said Shadrow with a tittering "he-he."</p>

<p>Both men showed such a plain disbelief that Shadrow slammed
his hand on the table top. "You think she won't agree? By Joseph,
she will&mdash;and be glad to. There's more than one way of
skinnin' a cat."</p>

<p>Tolbert walked slowly out to the porch. In the darkness his
face gave way to a wild expression of rage.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER 9. &mdash; THE UNEXPECTED</h2>

<p class="first">A MILE from TS, Hugh Tracy broke out of a long-
maintained gallop and drifted quietly on, listening for the echo
of Shadrow's outriders. Ranch lights cut a series of glowing
yellow loopholes in the night, and along the windless air lay the
smell of woodsmoke. Sighting nothing against the line of
lights&mdash; and wondering about that&mdash;he cleared the road,
curling around deep banks of shadows enfolding a string of
corrals. The maneuver placed him on the east edge of the outfit
and put him as well into an arroyo of some depth. Leaving the
horse here, he walked back across the road. Shadrow's small
saddle-stock barn laid its square pattern against the dim ranch
glow; on all fours, he reached the structure and crawled as far
as the plaza edge.</p>

<p>He knew the ranch well and could name the use of each
building. Casting his glance from one point to another with a
fisherman's patience, it occurred to him that the lights made a
deceptive show. Very little noise came from the bunkhouses, and
nobody seemed to be abroad. A calm pervaded these TS quarters, a
calm arising from semi-emptiness. Shadrow, then, had his crews
out on Mogul to consolidate the victories he had won.</p>

<p>"He feels sure and safe," reflected Hugh.</p>

<p>Across the plaza on the left-hand side sat the main house with
its office door wide open. Shadrow he could see rather plainly
behind a desk, and he could hear other men talking. Somebody
moved through the room, momentarily blanking out the light.
Settling on his haunches, Tracy let the minutes ride by while he
felt out the situation into which he had placed himself,
calculating his own next move.</p>

<p>There was nothing precipitate in his advance on the TS
citadel. It was not, actually, the reckless back slap he was
quite capable of making. During the hot day on the ridge his
thoughts had been split between his own particular problem and
the extremely dangerous position of the girl. He realized that,
as much as she knew of Shadrow, she didn't understand the full
hazards of being in the same house with him, under his power. All
his life this baron had done as he willed. There never had been a
bridle on his desires: Cautious and crafty and
scheming&mdash;these qualities only veneered Shadrow's intrinsic
ruthlessness. At heart the man was a buccaneer with a buccaneer's
contempt for tribal morals. Lynn Isherwood could not
know&mdash;for there was nobody in the Powder who dared tell
her&mdash;of all those surreptitious stories which were household
legends in the country concerning Shadrow's basic character.
Whatever this man touched, ruin also touched.</p>

<p>So, through the grudging hours, Tracy had slowly turned this
over and over in his head, increasingly oppressed by Lynn's
untenable position; and he had at last come to realize that her
fortune had to be his fortune. There was no way out of it. The
dark weavers responsible for the affairs of humans had placed the
thread of Lynn Isherwood's career across his own. The two were
joined. That fact had brought him out of the ridge and placed him
now beside the barn. As little as he could offer the girl in the
way of security, it was better than what she had.</p>

<p>There was more to it, of course, than that bare and
unsentimental analysis. There was a deep and stirring ferment in
the very thought of this girl, and he could not shake out of his
mind the picture of her&mdash;straight and inexorably honest,
full of grace and vital fire. But it was like Tracy to suppress
all that in his reasoning. It could have no part in the plans of
a virtual bankrupt. The only thing that counted now was to get
her away. And, considering his fruitless position by the plaza's
edge, he realized he had to take a still more dangerous step.
Coming to his knees, he rose; next moment he flattened against
the barn wall.</p>

<p>A man came aimlessly from the direction of the main house and
passed behind the barn, out of sight. A whispering undertone rose
over there, and a little later Tracy saw two figures cross in
front of him and head for the bunkhouse. Unknowing, he had waited
out a break. Instantly accepting the chance, he slid behind the
barn, paralleled it to that point where the yard narrowed into
the outgoing road. The corner of the main house stood a hundred
feet straight ahead, and a settling darkness hovered over
everything. Walking casually into that area, he looked back at
the plaza and found the two hands gone. Halfway to the house he
discovered a horse standing at the porch end, and beyond that,
nearer the office door, a string of six all saddled to go. Still
throttling down the urge to break into a run, he swung in at the
porch, stepped to it, and made the black aperture of the living-
room doorway in three long strides. The house was familiar to
him, and inside, edging across an absolute darkness, his
stretching hands touched and identified a couch. It made a little
shelter. Kneeling behind it, he listened to a gusty argument boil
out from the office; Maunders's voice, recognizable anywhere,
grumbled along a string of words. Shadrow spoke back, swift and
crackling. And he heard Lynn Isherwood's low reply.</p>

<p>From where he crouched he could see the suggestion of that
hallway leading back from the living quarters, into which the
guest rooms opened. They were all dark save one, and beneath the
door of that one a penciled strip of light emerged. At the far
end was another such thin glow from the kitchen. Shadrow spoke
once more, answered by somebody whose tones were definite but so
slurred that he could not distinguish them; immediately
afterwards bodies shifted, and Tracy pulled himself below the
couch a moment before the office door was thrown wide. Somebody
came through, breathing fast. The door closed. Lifting his head,
Hugh saw Lynn pass to the lighted bedroom and shut herself in.
What was to be done had to be done rapidly, for the conference in
the office seemed to be dissolving in a quarrel. Rising from the
couch, Hugh went over the living-room floor on his toes and down
the hall. In front of the girl's room he drummed his fingertips
softly against the panel and, without waiting for answer, pushed
himself through. She came wheeling around, both hands defensively
lifting. By the radiance of the half-dimmed lamp he saw that
there was no color at all in her cheeks. A small gasp ran from
her throat, yet as quick as he was to motion for silence she
passed him, closed the door, and put her body against it.</p>

<p>"Hugh," she whispered, "do you know what you're doing? Oh, my
dear, they would tear you apart!"</p>

<p>He bent near, murmuring against the shining surface of her
ash-yellow hair: "You'll have to get out of here tonight."</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I don't dare&mdash;where would I go?"</p>

<p>"Think of that later. No time to argue about it, Lynn. If you
don't slip out of here now, you never will. Understand what I
mean? Now&mdash;or you never will."</p>

<p>She looked up, trembling; one slim hand reached out and
gripped his sleeve for support. The pressure of it pulled him
nearer to her almost inaudible words. "I know. But we can't! We
could never get out of here! Hugh, for heaven's sake, go
away!"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "You go down the hall first. Slip out the
back livin'-room door. Wait there until&mdash;"</p>

<p>She let go of his arm and whirled around, both hands pressing
against the door. Hugh, turned rigid, let one arm fall against
his gun and remain there. Outside was the slow creep of feet.
Then that sound died, and across the silence&mdash;faintly broken
by the bickering from the office&mdash;a body shifted cautiously.
Something scraped the wood. Looking down, Tracy saw a slip of
paper appear through the bottom aperture of the door. As softly
as he had come into the hallway, the unknown retreated.</p>

<p>Lynn swept up the paper at a single gesture and unfolded it.
Watching, Hugh saw her eyes race along the writing and actually
change color. She held the slip out to him. It read:</p>

<p><i>"Your horse was lathered last night. Don't do that again or
they'll catch you."</i> </p>

<p>He looked up, puzzled. Leaning forward, she framed an almost
inaudible name: "Tolbert."</p>

<p>The quarreling in the office had dwindled to one man's steady
talk, and Hugh, astonished by the sudden swing of things, knew
his tenure here was increasingly debatable. He could risk no
further delay. Motioning at the door, he whispered, "Go ahead. If
Tolbert's in the livin' room, speak to him so I'll know. And draw
him to the back door with you. Otherwise wait out there."</p>

<p>She threw a strained protesting glance at him. But he shook
his head, again motioning. Stepping back, he turned the lamp wick
down until a cloudy flicker of light remained. Lynn swung the
door open and passed through, leaving it ajar. Hugh crossed the
room and reached the hall. In this black tunnel he could see
nothing at all, but he heard her moving ahead and, revolver
gripped in his fist, he followed on the balls of his feet. She
had stopped somewhere along the living room; and after a dragging
interval, with all his nerves cold and every shred of sound
magnified, he heard her expel another breath. Then he saw her cut
a vague silhouette in the living-room's back doorway. Rapidly and
less cautiously he went toward her.</p>

<p>Her throaty murmur came up beside him: "Where now? Tolbert
must be around."</p>

<p>He caught her elbow and pulled her as far as the corner of the
house, into shadows so thick as to have the motion of pooled
water. From here he could command a part of the plaza, apparently
empty; in any event, empty or holding men, he could no longer
wait to watch. Warning her with a slight pressure on her arm, he
walked straight outward from the house. Fifty yards onward he
crossed the road, swerved, and went on as far as the gully. Down
that a few paces he located the pony.</p>

<p>"Climb up."</p>

<p>She obeyed, but swung over, holding to him. "You are not
thinking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go straight ahead at a walk, Lynn. Straight ahead till you
hit the road that leads to the rim. I'll catch up."</p>

<p>"But you are not thinking of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lynn, never mind. A gambler never looks his luck in the face.
Go at a walk and keep in the road so I won't miss you."</p>

<p>He stepped back and waited until she had faded down the
ravine, southbound. There was the small clipping echo of the
pony's hoof striking some pebble, and a faint groan of leather.
It was all he dared assure himself of. Turning out of the
depression, he went back toward the house and gained the dark
corner where he had been so shortly before. This time he skirted
the side wall and came to the porch. That saddled pony on which
he had pinned so much hope still stood near by. Over at the
bunkhouse a hand idled in the doorway, and the argument in
Shadrow's office continued on. But neither of these things
bothered him so much as the threat of Lake Tolbert somewhere in
the obscurity. All the rest of them might be lumped together and
still fall short of the danger this one gaunt Texan contained in
his single head and body. That note to Lynn, presenting a warning
and a reassurance, meant nothing in the face of the foreman's
record and his cold killer's instinct. If he had in any sense
detected an off taint to the air this night, he would be
watching. Thinking so, Hugh hooked his head around the corner and
studied the porch closely. It was, so far as he could make out,
clear. In the other direction&mdash;out through the throat of the
yard where he must go&mdash;he could determine nothing.</p>

<p>Pulling himself away from the wall, Tracy walked around the
end of the porch and reached the horse. He knew he had to carry
it out with the lazy motions of a man doing only the natural and
expected thing. The only gesture that would betray him to any
covert eye in this shadow-swathed night was a motion of undue
haste. Yet when he untied the racked reins and climbed into the
leather there was a coat of sweat over his face, and he jammed
his feet into the stirrups stiffly to keep from raking the beast
out of the yard at a dead run.</p>

<p>The man at the bunkhouse appeared to catch the blurred shift
of Tracy's body and to see in it some signal for ranch activity,
for he moved into the plaza at long strides. That woke hidden
figures all around the yard. A shadow detached itself from the
small barn and came diagonally towards Hugh. Ten yards away, this
shadow resolved to form and voice: "What's it goin' to be
now?"</p>

<p>"Go to the office," grunted Hugh and drifted abreast the
fellow.</p>

<p>"Who's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shadrow's tones sailed out of the office into the pooled
darkness. "Tolbert, I want you."</p>

<p>"Get over there," said Hugh to the stopped hand. And then he
was past, clear of the plaza, into the road.</p>

<p>"Tolbert!" shouted Shadrow. "Come here!"</p>

<p>The poised hand shot a suddenly curious challenge at Hugh:
"Who're you?"</p>

<p>"If you'd stuck by the barn," muttered Hugh, "instead of
roamin' all around this yard, you'd know."</p>

<p>"Tolbert!" yelled Shadrow. "Maunders, come out here and see
what the hell's goin' on yonder. Tolbert!"</p>

<p>No reply came from Tolbert&mdash;an ominous hint to Hugh. A
man ran along the plaza side of the small barn and joined the
inquisitive hand, who still stood uncertain in his tracks. Swift,
suppressed spurts of half-angered conversation ran between them;
Maunders's blundering progress came increasingly clear to Hugh,
who gripped the reins with a heavy pressure. This whole situation
was about to blow up violently, yet he dared not make a break for
it until the two hands in his rear had lost sight of his outline
and until he himself had picked up the shadow of the girl ahead.
Somewhere on the dark road lay a proper deadline. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>He never finished the thought. There was a quick rush of a
pony directly in front. A roughened voice rapped out, "Stop that!
Come here, you little fool, or I'll shake the wind out of you!"
Lynn Isherwood screamed, "Hugh&mdash;Hugh!" Then her appeal died
abruptly and the pony drummed off into blackness. Ripping his
spurs across the borrowed horse's flanks, Hugh threw himself
forward. Maunders was yelling, Shadrow lifted a voice so full of
rage as to sound like the screeching of a woman; and all the
hands were shouting. Somebody fired a single shot. Out in front
the girl cried again, and again was silenced.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10. &mdash; INDIFFERENT GODS LOOK ON</h2>

<p class="first">SLASHED by the spurs, Tracy's pony flung itself
forward in great and lunging strides. Out of the ink-black
foreground a solid shadow appeared, moving from left to right
uncertainly, and for one wild moment Tracy thought he was lost.
Bending down, he threw the whole weight of his body into an
avoiding turn and, half successful, struck the shadow&mdash;Lynn
Isherwood's abandoned mount&mdash;a slanting blow. His right leg
scraped the beast's yielding side; stirrup and stirrup got
entangled and then the free pony bucked away. The shock of that
sudden strain upon the locked saddle furniture nearly unseated
Tracy, All that saved him was the abrupt breaking of the empty
stirrup from its holding ring. Clear then, he applied his spurs
again while Lynn's horse galloped back toward TS.</p>

<p>The flurry checked him, put the fugitives so much farther
ahead in the unseen foreground, and brought the swarming Shadrow
riders so much nearer. Divided of attention, he heard Maunders's
strident voice ride furiously across the night. They were in full
halloo back there&mdash;all of them&mdash;and strung out along
the earth. A nearer hand sent up a shouted cry: "Watch
out&mdash;on the road!" A gun's echo followed closely,
detonations cracking the gloom. That signal appeared to shake the
TS group, to collect it, and to bring on an abrupt snarl of
riders. Bedlam burst out. Distinctly he caught the dull, grunting
"thwack" of a collision and its consequent cursing. One man
yelled. And then there was a clear faltering of stride. Maunders
was bearing away on another tangent, each pace marked by a black
oath dropped; but Shadrow's half-screamed command went after the
gunman imperatively and without respect or nicety. All this
happened in the turn of the moments, with Tracy rushing on while
a sense of needed haste prodded and nagged him. By degrees he
drew clear. The sound of all that riot diminished, dwindled, and
at last became only a few faint threads of murmur. The last
definite thing he picked up was the backlash of a thundering
quarrel between Maunders and the TS owner.</p>

<p>It was the first breathing spell, a respite from trouble
behind. Listening now for what lay ahead, he got the rapid
drumming of hoofs&mdash;of a single horse breasting the night and
actually drawing away. It puzzled him, for he knew the animal to
be carrying double burden&mdash;the weight of the rider and of
Lynn who had been lifted from her own saddle and taken aboard the
captor's; Yet the fact was so, and no more than five minutes
later the last vestige of that flight fainted into the steady
pound of his own pony's shoes rising rhythmically from the baked
earth, to leave no guiding rumor that he might follow. As much as
he wished to stop and listen, he throttled the inclination. In
this touch-and-go interval he dared waste no time. So he pressed
on, keeping the faintly visible strip of yellow roadway beneath
him. The man ahead would, he knew, also keep to it as long as the
need for fast travel was paramount.</p>

<p>From the moment of Lynn's warning cry, there had been no doubt
in his mind as to the man's identity. All signs pointed to
Tolbert. The ranch foreman's message, slipped under the door, was
certainly the mark of special interest; the foreman's
disappearance from the yard, so complete that Shadrow's summons
raised no answer, was a clinching of the fact. Shadrow, working
out his secretive purposes within a cold and aloof brain, had at
last struck. As crowded with outrage as he was, Tracy could not
shake the deepening puzzlement. Abduction was a dangerous game, a
reckless game&mdash;the one act certain to bring down instant
pursuit. The whole county would be after Tolbert&mdash;all of
Shadrow's men and some who were not. And it seemed far beside
Tolbert's character thus to embark on the one act surest of
evoking retaliation. The man was too canny, too certain of his
ends to fly off into momentary, errant passion. What then was the
answer?</p>

<p>Tracy couldn't see it. Galloping along the road, he couldn't
see it. All that he could make out with any degree of clarity was
that he rounded into another showdown. Bill Vivian's words
returned to him with an especial fitness. It was of no use to lay
plans in the Powder. Nothing remained still long enough to
provide any base of calculation. The only sure fact was that the
dark gods attending his destiny looked on now and cared not at
all. Apparently they never had. Never had any comfort come to him
except by his own bitter struggle for it, and such comfort had
been as transitory as the morning fog along the sand dunes. There
was no end, no promise of eventual tranquillity or profit. What
goodness and what order could there be in a world allowing this
sequence of events to continue?</p>

<p>As before, there was no answer. It seemed to Tracy there never
was an answer and that his life was full of dark alleys blind at
the endings. Certainly nothing clear, nothing definite came of
the day except only those brief moments when all the pagan
splendors of the raw land stirred in him an ancient, primeval
response. Such things as the crystal pathway of stars stretching
across infinity, the sweep of Powder desert all golden in the
morning, or some feeling of supreme fitness and unity that passed
before the glow of it was quite established. Everything else was
rebellion, struggle, and mischance. "Whatever I touch turns to
trouble," he mused. "Whoever touches me is daubed with it."</p>

<p>The pony was deeply drawing, running on at a steady pace.
Nothing came from the foreground. Behind, the long silence was
broken by a series of out-rolling detonations that died into
silence again. He had come four miles along the road, or to where
it bent down into the desert via the rim's fault. Considering the
route briefly, he could see no advantage in it for Tolbert.
Almost certainly a TS guard stood somewhere along the fault to
spot the foreman's passage and later report it to the following
ranch outfit. Moreover, once the foreman reached the desert he
was in a vast corral with few exits, these soon enough closed by
Shadrow. In addition, Tolbert's horse could never stand the long
run across the flats. It had to have a rest; and the closest
hide-out would be somewhere on top of Mogul in the broken country
rising sharply behind and above Antelope.</p>

<p>A surer test presented itself. Halted, no sound reached him.
But there was a clinging dust in the air, plain indication of
Tolbert's passage; and onward a hundred feet or so, where the
trail forked left and right, the scent of dust bore away on the
latter course into the rugged southern heights of the plateau.
Tracy accepted this route and galloped half a mile before reining
in, again catching the taint of the risen dust. It was as he had
figured. Tolbert elected to reach quick shelter.</p>

<p>It was strange that the TS riders had quit, or seemed to have
quit. He could make out nothing back there. For that matter, he
stopped worrying about them as the packed blackness of the night
increased around him and the road pitched from ravine to ridge.
The dust held on, his single guide; at one point the trail crept
to the very margin of Mogul's precipice, and he saw the lights of
Antelope glimmer two thousand feet below. Afterwards the trail
advanced boldly into the tangle of the high summits, hoisted from
one increasing slope to another. The flatness of Mogul ceased to
be, replaced by vague and rearing silhouettes jagged against the
sky. Presently the trail lessened to a mere footway alongside the
upthrust shoulders of land; a cooler, keener air washed around
him, and he arrived after a while at an elevated meadow park
surrounded by dense shadow. Here he stopped, defeated. The dust
smell was gone.</p>

<p>Either he had overshot Tolbert's turn-off, or he stood now on
the threshold of the foreman's new course. Whatever the case, the
rocky underfooting would provide him with no more scent; nor
could he hope for a sound signal, considering Tolbert's advantage
of distance. That much, he reflected, was certain. It was also
certain that the man's horse could not be pushed a great deal
farther without rest. It thus became an even bet that Tolbert
would accept the first good hide-out he reached.</p>

<p>There, in the dark, Tracy blocked out the surrounding country
in his mind. Obviously the man was running south&mdash;the one
sure way of getting out of the Powder. Still, in the south stood
a stiff and immediate climb that would be difficult for a jaded
beast, while onward a mile there was another trail leading in the
desired direction by gentler grades. And off there lay a hundred
by-passes Tolbert might take, each adjacent to isolated ravines
and commanding viewpoints such as a fugitive might well use to
survey the back trail when light came. More important, in that
region were three line cabins.</p>

<p>Tracy went slowly forward. A small breeze scoured the slopes,
setting up thin waterfalls of sound; and the click of the pony's
shoes made little javelin echoes. It was a dull and straining
business to cruise at this speed. As so many times before, there
was a violent discord in him between the patience he never
sufficiently possessed and his natural desire to break forward
impetuously. What held him was a clear and increasing realization
of Lake Tolbert's essential power. The man knew all the tricks
and would use them. He was, Tracy summed up, an Apache in
temperament.</p>

<p>Somewhere beyond, Tracy angled up the slope of a small ridge,
cut across its spine, and dismounted, to descend, the other side
a good hundred yards before halting. Here he crouched, seeing
nothing in the dense blackness below, but knowing a deserted
cabin to be there. Listening with a collected and profound
attention, he wondered again what Tolbert could hope for, what
remote advantage he could be foreseeing. There was no answer save
one&mdash;and that too brutal to be probable. Nothing moved
yonder&mdash; the cabin was empty. Swinging back to the horse, he
sidled into a gulch, rode it out, and thereafter tackled the
stiffly pitched slopes. It was a blind man's game, to be played
against one who never would allow himself the error of
underestimating pursuit. Long afterwards Tracy came to another
hidden hollow and again repeated his silent skirting of a log hut
invisible in the depths. As before, the guess was wrong; and as
before, he pressed on.</p>

<p>Threading the black defiles, he lost all sense of time. It
might have been an hour or it might have been four hours since he
had left TS. His only gauge of the night was the varying
thickness of fog layers as he rode through them. Around what he
believed to be midnight he finally came out upon a dominating
peak of the Moguls and stopped to consider. Any way from this
point he might command a view of the hills when day arrived; and
as much as he despised the logic of the thought, it seemed best
to wait out the day. Further groping was entirely futile. Tolbert
was halted&mdash;that he knew; and halted within striking
distance of this peak.</p>

<p>"I'll learn a little patience before I die," grunted Tracy,
and unsaddled in a slight bowl below the cone of the peak.
Rolling in the blanket, he fell into an intermittent sleeping and
rousing. From another angle of the dark world came the abysmally
melancholy wail of a coyote.</p>

<p>What woke him, just when the first pale wedge of light broke
the eastern black, was the faintest reverberation of sound
passing along the utter quiet of the morning. Rising instantly,
he made his way to the top parapet of rock and stationed himself
behind it. In every direction, at this hour, he viewed only low-
lying layers of fog banked in the depressions like deep drifts of
snow. Gradually, as the glow strengthened out of the east, the
top mists broke, and one after another the higher promontories
pierced the thinning blankets; then all at once the fog in the
ravines began to eddy and run as water might, exposing the whole
southern distance in its gaunt and broken outline. Yonder a mile,
he sighted one of the cabins he had in mind and, looking at it
with a concentrated attention, he thought he made out the shift
of a body in the doorway. It was a slim enough chance, yet he
moved directly back to the horse. He saddled and led it down the
blind side of the peak a full three hundred yards before
mounting; then he cut a circle across the lower ground and struck
into a gulch. It led south. It brought him by changing degrees
around the peak. It went descendingly on, side walls effectually
hiding him. Keeping the peak's spire as a compass point, Tracy
arrived at timber and here rose from the gulch to begin another
curling foray. Night damp was on the ground, and the green pine
needles glistened in the fresh and sunless light. One faint shred
of activity twined through the trees. Stopped dead, he jumped
from the horse, crawled up an incline, and found himself staring
at the back side of the cabin through a narrow aperture in the
timber mass. He had made a complete half-circle from the back of
the peak.</p>

<p>The cabin was two hundred feet forward and without a window on
this side. A saddled horse stood there grazing. Alert now and
expecting anything, Tracy flattened against the earth mold and
placed one quick glance after another along the vistas presented
to him. Tolbert was not to be caught thus easily off balance, and
the very air of quiet held a warning. Yet his free running
inspection could locate no direct evidence of such; and urged on
by a lack of faith in his position, he crawled through the pines,
a yard at a time, until he reached a place abreast the cabin's
front and perhaps sixty feet away from it. From this point clear
ground swept onward to the peak. Lynn Isherwood sat on a log by
the doorway with her face lifted to that commanding summit.</p>

<p>He saw her profile to be clear and calm, almost without
strain, and instantly one great fear left him. She was exactly as
she had been at TS the previous night&mdash;ash hair smoothed
back from her temples, rough gray shirt open at the throat. All
her body was in repose, and her hands were quiet in her lap; she
had courage&mdash;that fine quality of courage which was steady
and dominating and never needed the false stimulant of anger to
buoy it up. A moment later her head came around to reveal the
long shadows across those gray-blue eyes. Puzzlement made quick,
deep creases on her brow.</p>

<p>Tracy went rigid in his place, and his breathing turned small
and slow. There was no sound inside the cabin, no trace of
Tolbert. The man was outside somewhere, hidden and hunting;
venturing a slight sidewise roll, he searched the roundabout
trees with a roused sense of catastrophe. He had gained this
shelter too easily. Tolbert had let him pocket himself. Thinking
so, he was on the verge of crawling to better shelter when he saw
Lynn rise from the log and turn slowly away. That and the
rustling of brush on the far side of the cabin arrested him, made
him reach for the holstered gun. A man called and came out of the
trees on a trot, smiling; and at sight of him Tracy was
astonished out of all his set convictions. For that figure
stepping into the clear and facing Lynn with a half-hunted, half-
sardonic expression on his ruddy cheeks was not Tolbert. It was
Bat Testervis&mdash;Bat Testervis unshaven and unhandsome.</p>

<p>Testervis spoke to the girl with a quick, overbearing
insolence. "You had a chance to make a run for it. Why didn't you
try?"</p>

<p>She said nothing, and he fell to impatient anger. "I'm getting
pretty sick of this freeze-out manner. Look here, Lynn, I'll
break that unnecessary pride or I'll break your neck."</p>

<p>"I can't follow all your quick changes," said she calmly.
"First you'll sweep up the earth for me, then you'll break my
neck. What can I depend on, Mr. Testervis?"</p>

<p>"Be reasonable," said Bat, of a sudden persuasive.</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>Testervis shrugged his wide shoulders. "You told me once I
didn't have nerve. I figured maybe that was why you never liked
me. Well, I set out to show you I had it. Did, didn't I? I took
you right out from under Tade Shadrow's nose."</p>

<p>"What for?" challenged the girl. "Are you big enough fool to
think I can be persuaded that way?"</p>

<p>"If," argued Bat, wholly in earnest, "you saw me as I really
was&mdash;not as you've made up your mind I must be&mdash;you
wouldn't be as chilly. What's a woman want if not a man that can
take care of her?"</p>

<p>"And you thought I might be made to like you by force?"
retorted the girl.</p>

<p>There was a biting irony in it, but Testervis, normally thin-
skinned enough to feel the faintest hint of affront, seemed not
to be aware of it now. He was involved in his own thought,
endeavoring to get it across. "Never mind how I did it, Lynn.
There wasn't any other way left open to me. My outfit is
through&mdash;all gone. I figured I might hit back, but the crew
left me flat. I'll never ride this country any more. All I can do
is run. What else could I do but watch my chance to catch you
alone?"</p>

<p>"What for?" challenged the girl, insistently abrupt.</p>

<p>"Why," said the man, very slowly choosing his words, "I've
told you already. You had the wrong idea of me. I knew if I could
get you on even ground it would be different. Forget what Tade's
told you. Forget what anybody's told you about Bat Testervis. I'm
no wolf. I'm a human bein'. I can make my way anywhere. I'm not
afraid of anything that breathes."</p>

<p>"What for?" repeated Lynn Isherwood.</p>

<p>Testervis stared, the ruddy complexion taking on a deeper
flush. "I want an even chance&mdash;same as you'd give any man
you met for the first time, Drop all the nonsense that's been
loaded onto you."</p>

<p>"You're a fool," stated the girl. "An arrogant, bumptious
fool, What you really had in your mind was that no woman could
possibly resist your charm once she saw it. Well, you've made the
best of the chance you had&mdash;and it hasn't worked. I'm sorry,
but I don't see you. My first impression was right. You haven't
succeeded in changing it. You strut and you brag. Down in your
heart you're a bully&mdash;otherwise you wouldn't be thinking
plain strength pleased any woman who had sense."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Bat, a sullen anger showing out of his
big eyes. "Don't get me wrong again. I had no wild ideas about
abductin' you at all. I made that play to show you I wasn't
afraid of TS. Also to have a few uninterrupted hours to explain
myself&mdash;which you always refused to let me have."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll agree you've proved your great courage."
Tracy's admiration for the girl deepened enormously, She was
jabbing Bat's pride, rubbing salt into his egotism with a wicked
deliberation, surely knowing the danger, she thereby ran. Bat
Testervis visibly swelled with rage, and thick color ran solidly
up his columnar neck. The cigarette in his hand shook; and the
staring surfaces of his eyes assumed a sultry glare visible even
across the distance. When he spoke again, Tracy heard the man's
temper beat harder against the restraining calm.</p>

<p>"After I'd made that clear, I never had the least intention of
carrying you farther off&mdash;unless you wished to go. I meant
to let you do as you pleased. That was the extent of it. I'm not
crazy. I know what comes to a man that tries a kidnappin' stunt.
It would be playin' right into Tade Shadrow's hands. So I figured
to let you go, or to help you get out of the country if you
wished."</p>

<p>"I'll settle your doubt," said Lynn coolly. "Leave me right
here."</p>

<p>"You'll never get the chance to decide now!" cried Testervis,
all at once overwhelmed by madness. "I have changed my mind!
You'll string along with me till I get some humbleness into your
system!"</p>

<p>"Better let me go now," answered Lynn, unshaken. "You know
what will happen to you if you're caught."</p>

<p>"I don't propose to be caught! By God, I hope Shadrow and his
pack keep comin'! I'll do some long-distance damage on my own
account for what they've done to me! As for you and your fine
airs, you'll sure start regrettin' all that sarcasm and contempt
you've laid onto me!"</p>

<p>"And now you're mad," said Lynn Isherwood.</p>

<p>"You're worth kissin'," muttered Testervis and suddenly walked
toward her. Lynn's hand struck him so sharply across the face
that the report was like a muffled gunshot. Testervis seized the
arm before it fell and twisted it toward him. Then he let it
drop, staggering back, sullen emotions congealing on his cheeks.
Hugh Tracy stood upright in the clearing, cold and soundless,
revolver pinned on the other's broad chest.</p>

<p>"Step aside, Lynn," said Tracy in the flattest speech a man
could ever make. The girl, startled, wheeled about with a breath
rushing through her throat. As soon as she saw him, saw the
incredible fire of his eyes, she cried out:</p>

<p>"No&mdash;Hugh&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"Lynn," droned Hugh Tracy, "he's dirt beneath your feet. You
ought to realize it by now. Step aside."</p>

<p>"Don't do it&mdash;don't do it, Hugh!"</p>

<p>"He was a spoiled and coddled kid," said Hugh, unrelentingly
stolid. "He never knew how to lose his marbles without cryin'. He
was a tricky, mean, short-tailed little rat. And he grew up
worse. As long as he gets his own way, he's a lion. When the
goin' turns a little tough, he's a yellow-bellied squealer."</p>

<p>"Don't," repeated Lynn Isherwood rapidly. "Never mind what he
is. You can't afford to be cruel, Hugh!"</p>

<p>"I told you," grunted Hugh, "I didn't believe in Santy
Claus."</p>

<p>Testervis stood dumb, flat in his tracks, motionless since
that first surprise of Tracy's appearance. His breathing came
labored and fast. Both big fists hung to his hip line, and either
through fear or that madness which destroys, the ruddiness of his
skin vanished entirely, to leave a strained white mask in which
the two bold eyes gleamed with utter malevolence. He had his head
back, and those eyes, winkless, never left Hugh Tracy's gripping
inspection.</p>

<p>"He's lost," said Lynn Isherwood. "Isn't that enough,
Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Not for me. All his miserable life he's got out of scrapes
without payin'. This time he's got to take his medicine. Turn
around, Bat."</p>

<p>Into the other man's congested, hating glance appeared a
distinct break of alarm. "You're not goin' to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I was able to shoot you from behind I would," said Hugh.
"But it ain't in me. Turn around. Lift your hands high."</p>

<p>Testervis swung reluctantly, obeying. Hugh walked forward and
reached out to get the man's gun from its holster, and to throw
it far into the trees. He retreated then and dropped his own gun
to the earth. "All right," said he. "Come on at me."</p>

<p>Testervis wheeled, fury exploding. He yelled savagely.</p>

<p>"You sucker, that's what I hoped you'd do! I'll bust your back
in the middle!" Lynn Isherwood, half swinging toward him, cried
out. But Testervis suddenly grinned in a manner that pulled his
lips apart, drew himself to his full height and leaped
forward.</p>

<p>Against that swelling spread of shoulder and that thickness of
torso, Hugh Tracy's own rugged body seemed slender and
ineffectual by comparison&mdash;without a chance of stopping the
rushing attack. For Testervis came on as if the savage momentum
of his heavy body would beat Hugh Tracy to earth and leave him
there senseless; his blond head, lowered like a battering ram,
shone in the first morning sun, and he emitted a strangled cry
that blasted the still air as his two club-like arms stretched
outward. Hugh, cold and clear of mind, took a single pace to the
rear, balanced himself, and shot ahead. Between those destructive
arms was an opening into which he drove a sledging blow, straight
for the pit of Bat's stomach. The wind spilled out of Testervis.
He lost control of his assaulting bulk and hit Hugh as so much
dead weight, the point of a shoulder crushing Hugh's chest. Yet,
even bereft of the full driving power, it was a numbing impact
and Hugh went staggering away from it, shivered to the bone.
Bat's face lifted in contorted satisfaction; he sucked in air
with a retching effort, and he lunged on once more to land a blow
against Hugh's temple. Hugh, all the world gone black, ran in and
gripped the big fellow desperately about the chest. He could see
nothing, hear nothing. Bat's hot breath burned his neck, and he
felt himself being lifted and whirled and shaken ferociously
while something kept grinding on his instep and hammering at his
groin. Yet he hung on for what seemed an interminable length of
time, and was dimly surprised when the dense mists cleared and he
found himself still weathering through, still pinning Bat's arms.
The big man was vomiting out his rage, making great and
staggering lunges across the dirt with this leech-like
burden.</p>

<p>Hugh let go abruptly and struck for the broad shelving of
Bat's chin&mdash;a direct exploding hit that sent the man back on
his heels. It threw Bat off guard as well, spread his arms apart,
unbalanced him for a moment; and in that moment Hugh smashed the
bold face left and right and stood idle while Testervis went
spinning to earth. Sweat streamed down Hugh's jaws and worked
like fire on a bruise made by some blow he didn't remember. He
was reaching deeply for wind, starved for it, unable to get
enough, and all the while standing over Testervis, who lifted
himself on one elbow and glared out of eyes gone pale violet.</p>

<p>"You're not through!" cried Testervis. "You'll fight till your
damned heart breaks! I'll smash you to pulp!"</p>

<p>"Come on&mdash;come on up," said Tracy.</p>

<p>Testervis rolled away, got on all fours, crouching. He flashed
a glance slyly back; he sprang up and away like a runner, and
wheeled instantly afterwards, defenses risen. But Hugh Tracy, the
rank taste of blood in his mouth, was ridden relentlessly by the
black, smoldering lust to destroy. Whatever he normally was,
mercy was out of him now and all sense of pain or danger or
caution. He threw himself at the swinging Testervis and was
checked by stiff-armed jabs that went wild and sank into his neck
and chest. He never felt them. His own blows beat down those
barrier-like assaults until Bat's face was a clear target in
front of him, round and swollen and white. He smashed it, he
ripped it side and side; he flung one blasting jab after another
at it until he saw nothing there. And when the tempest cleared
from his brain he looked down and saw Testervis silent on the
ground. The big prone shoulders shook as if Testervis were
crying.</p>

<p>"Get up and come at me," said Tracy.</p>

<p>Testervis slowly put his hands beneath him and fell back.</p>

<p>"Get up," snapped Tracy. "You're not through."</p>

<p>But Testervis rolled his head from side to side on the earth
and brought his palms up to cover it as might a sick man shutting
out the world. Hugh Tracy stared, speechless. The wild temper
subsided, and the bruises on his own body began to throb. He was
finished. The fury that had carried him so far went
away&mdash;and left him filled with disgust, as always. Turning
toward the girl standing by the cabin, he spoke slowly:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you had to see it. You've seen me as Powder sees
me&mdash;and it is not a pretty sight. I'm no better a savage
than they say."</p>

<p>She watched him, wide-eyed, whispering: "Nothing&mdash;nothing
could stand against you, Hugh. Not when you're roused."</p>

<p>"Bat," grunted Hugh, "you're licked all ways. Best you can do
now is get up and travel till the sun finds you in another
country. I'm keepin' your horse for Lynn. I'm keepin your gun. If
I gave it to you, you'd shoot me in the back&mdash;and I don't
blame you for wantin' to do it. Get up and go."</p>

<p>Testervis reared back on his knees, shaking his head stupidly.
He got to his feet and pressed his fingers across his eyes. When
he cleared them and looked at Tracy once more, they were blank of
feeling.</p>

<p>"You're settin' me afoot and harmless&mdash;in the Powder?
Look here, Tracy, Shadrow's got me marked."</p>

<p>"Then stay out of sight and travel by dark," returned
Tracy.</p>

<p>"I may get clear at that," said Testervis, displaying no heat.
"But you and the girl won't. They'll hound you and they'll catch
you. I only wish I could be around to see them do it. It's me
that put them on the scent, and it's you they'll find. I've been
sick of this mighty-man-Tracy stuff for years. Wherever I went I
bumped into it. Well, let's see the mighty man get clear of this.
You're finished."</p>

<p>"Travel," ordered Tracy. "You never did learn to lose without
cryin'."</p>

<p>"You're finished!" cried out Testervis wildly, and started
off. Standing in his tracks, Tracy watched the man go limping
across the flat ground and up the side of the ridge. He
disappeared in timber and, came to view once more on the ridge's
crest; then, without looking back, he passed down the other
side.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for him," said Hugh.</p>

<p>Lynn Isherwood lifted her chin, shadows disappearing from her
face. Quick pleasure appeared there on the clear, steady
features. "I knew you'd say that, Hugh."</p>

<p>"He's got a long course to the south," mused Tracy. "But he
loves his skin and he'll make it."</p>

<p>He was mistaken in Testervis. Well as he knew the man, he had
no conception of the subterranean fires that worked through Bat.
Once over the hill, Testervis turned north, back around the peak,
instead of south. He traveled steadily up the long grade and out
to a slight promontory from which he could view part of that
broken land falling into TS range; and pausing there, he saw a
single rider curling around the trail something more than a mile
distant. Thoughtful and taciturn, he stood still a long interval,
then at last went ahead, fashioning his own route to fall
eventually into that trail. The rider came steadily on, growing
to definite shape in the saddle&mdash;long-legged, abnormally
tall of upper parts, and strangely immobile. It was, Testervis
presently saw, Lake Tolbert. Testervis came to a full stop and
let his hand drop to the empty holster. Swearing softly, he
scanned the farther landscape for men to follow up the TS
foreman. But there were none in view. "Always one trick left in
the deck," he muttered, and held his ground.</p>

<p>Tolbert, he realized, must have identified him before now. But
the foreman neither checked in nor displayed any particular sign
of increased wariness, Sure and unbending, he arrived at within
ten yards before he halted and stared at the battered figure
blocking the trail.</p>

<p>"A surprise to you?" asked Testervis.</p>

<p>"Nothin' ever surprises me," said the foreman laconically.
"Where's the girl?"</p>

<p>"How do you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Tolbert.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm through," muttered Testervis. "I'm licked and I
realize it. But I've got a dicker to make with Shadrow."</p>

<p>"Dicker?"</p>

<p>"He wants the girl, don't he? He wants Tracy?"</p>

<p>Tolbert's narrowed eyes remained inscrutably on the man. "How
is it," he mused, "that a Testervis would come about like
this?"</p>

<p>"That's my business," retorted Bat. "But if I'm licked, I'm
licked. Willing to admit it. Shadrow will find his hand
considerably strengthened by a little legality in this mess. I'll
sign over the ranch for any sort of figure, and I'll do him some
good to boot. More's the point right now, I can take him direct
to Hugh Tracy."</p>

<p>"Seems odd," reflected Tolbert with a faint singsong in the
words.</p>

<p>Testervis moved uneasily. "Never mind. You're no hand to
inquire into a man's reasons."</p>

<p>"Not inquirin'," said Tolbert. "Already know."</p>

<p>"You don't know a damned thing," snapped Testervis.</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Behind me, not far off. Is Shadrow around?"</p>

<p>Tolbert elected to say nothing, but Testervis found his answer
in the lower distance. Over on the flats of the Mogul a long gray
column advanced beneath a rolling cloud of dust. Seeing that,
something happened to the man's face. Distinctly it sharpened
with excitement and uncertainty. Tolbert's seizing glance
absorbed the fact: Shifting in the saddle, he spoke with the same
colorless inflection:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't be too sure of Tade's friendliness. Keep away from
him. Leave the country. Don't you know what sort of a reception
you'll get from the man?"</p>

<p>"I ain't worryin'," countered Bat, irritably. "So why should
you?"</p>

<p>"Friendly suggestion."</p>

<p>"Friendly hell!"</p>

<p>"Tracy ran into you," reflected Tolbert. "And like to addled
your brains. That's why you're sellin' out."</p>

<p>Testervis glared at the motionless man above him, big eyes
suffusing with anger. Tolbert went on, relentless.</p>

<p>"And took your gun and told you to scatter. To get even with
him, you'd risk your neck. You'd traffic with the outfit that
killed your brother and ruined your own fortune. It's more than
odd, Testervis. It's a weaselly shift. Some things, friend, no
man can afford to do."</p>

<p>"Why, you damn scoundrel!" yelled Testervis. "What kind of a
fellow are you to preach at me?"</p>

<p>Tolbert's gimlet eyes bored into the other, and the flat words
fell one by one: "Supposin' that girl might want to get away from
TS? Make any difference in your style?"</p>

<p>"She had her chance with me," muttered Testervis. "She turned
it down. Why should I care what happens to her?"</p>

<p>Tolbert was silent, turning back for a short look at the
cavalcade swinging up through the lower draws. Again facing
Testervis, he said: "Better not try it. Tade's won his battle and
he'll need no help, from you. You're liable to get in a jam."</p>

<p>"I'll see Shadrow about that," growled Testervis.</p>

<p>"Nothing will change your mind?"</p>

<p>"I'll see Shadrow," insisted Testervis. "Look here, I don't
savvy what you're trying to do. You work for TS, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I see," said Tolbert. "Nothing will change your mind."</p>

<p>The stiffness of his body increased, and the thin mouth became
bloodless. "Some things, Testervis, are plumb unnatural in a man.
Even in a weak and bad one. You fool." The long arm whipped down
against the blackened gun butt exposed. Testervis cried out his
alarm.</p>

<p>"Tolbert&mdash;!"</p>

<p>There was one sharp and rolling explosion. The snout of the
gun kicked in Tolbert's fist. Bat Testervis, horrified
astonishment on his cheeks, pitched to the earth and died face
down.</p>

<p>"Never had a lick of sense in him," said Tolbert. For one
considerable interval he stared at the ground, little eyes
guiltless of any feeling, rigidly controlled by the aloofness
always abiding with him. Afterwards he holstered his piece and
turned around. Looping along the mountain side, he met the
cavalcade some twenty minutes later on a lower level. Shadrow was
leading.</p>

<p>"What was that shot?" asked the TS boss.</p>

<p>Tolbert silently pointed in the general direction of
southeast&mdash;a good forty-five degrees aside from that peak
behind which Tracy and the girl were hidden. Then, when Shadrow's
inspection grew insistent, the foreman said laconically: "I saw
nothing over toward the west. We better follow that echo."</p>

<p>"Seemed to come more out of the due south to me," objected
Shadrow.</p>

<p>"I was nearest it," replied Tolbert impatiently.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, then. Aim for it."</p>

<p>Accepting the lead, Tolbert led the party on into the deeper
ruggedness of Mogul, but wide of the peak.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11. &mdash; FLIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">HUGH TRACY watched Testervis until the latter
disappeared from the ridge. Then he swung abruptly on the girl.
"Lynn&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him. "No. Nothing happened." A fine color
crept across her cheeks, but her eyes clung to him without
embarrassment. "You are a direct man, Hugh."</p>

<p>"I know Bat," said Tracy. "Sooner or later he'd crossed the
line."</p>

<p>She nodded slowly. "I realized that."</p>

<p>"Where," drawled Hugh, "did you learn to be so cool under
fire?"</p>

<p>"I grew up amongst all kinds of men, Hugh. My father ran a
ferry, a hotel, and a saloon. I could swear before I could
read."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I'm here," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"My dear man," said the girl with a gentle gayety, "you don't
know how glad <i>I</i> am."</p>

<p>"Now we've got to dust along."</p>

<p>"Hugh, I'm not so sure about that."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Shadrow and his boys will be somewhere
right over that peak. This is broken country and good shelter,
but it is dangerous to be in. If he works it right he can bottle
us up. Sooner we're out of it, the better."</p>

<p>She was watching the first broad yellow hands of sunlight
break across the peak's sharp tip. A frown lay lightly penciled
on her forehead, and her lips were thoughtfully pursed. Yet
somehow this show of concern had little effect on the resiliency
and freshness of spirit showing through the expressive features.
Even now he caught the hint of slight recklessness, of a gambling
instinct; this and a serene poise hard to shake. "Wait a minute,
Hugh. What Bat Testervis said was really true. He brought my
uncle on the trail. And you'll be the one to suffer for it. If it
is as risky as you say, I'd better ride back while you ride
on."</p>

<p>"What in thunder do you suppose I came to TS last night
for?"</p>

<p>"I know. But isn't there always another day and another
chance? I can't allow the thought of you being caught by Tade. I
know even better than you do what would happen."</p>

<p>"Further, deponent sayeth not," drawled Hugh. "You have spoken
your piece. Now we'll get out of here."</p>

<p>The lurking smile broke through, "At least I had the chance to
say what I should say, Hugh. Now I'll say no more. You don't
realize how wonderful it is to put the burden on your shoulders."
The smile disappeared before a deep, deep gravity. "You don't
really know. I ought to despise myself for being so wishy-
washy."</p>

<p>"I guess I can take the burden with no great hurt," said Hugh,
equably.</p>

<p>"That's just the trouble," she retorted. "Don't you suppose I
have heard enough about you to draw my own conclusions? Actually,
you have been so willing to assume other people's burdens that
they impose on you. That's how you've gotten such a reputation
for fighting. You'd take my troubles to yourself if they broke
your back. Hugh, my idea is really best."</p>

<p>"Return to Tade?" grunted Tracy. "Some day let me tell you
about that relation of yours. There is no going back now. Wait
here."</p>

<p>"It is a very faint and very distant relationship," said the
girl. "His branch of the family is so far from mine that he's
actually not a true uncle."</p>

<p>He went around the house, got his horse and led it by Bat's
tethered mount. When he brought them both into the clearing, the
girl was coming out of the cabin with her coat. "Which way,
Hugh?"</p>

<p>"South&mdash;due south." He held his own horse while she
stepped into the saddle.</p>

<p>"Where does it lead?"</p>

<p>"Out of Powder," said Hugh, mounting and swinging about. "Out
of the country just as far as we can get out."</p>

<p>"And then where?" murmured the girl, more to herself than to
him. Of a sudden the cloud was across her eyes again.</p>

<p>"Time enough to consider it when we are clear," answered Hugh.
"First things first."</p>

<p>"First things first," repeated the girl. "Yes&mdash;that would
be your way. It is strange. I have heard so much of you that I
can almost tell what you'll do when something comes up&mdash;tell
it before you act. You believe in having a hard chore over with,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"If I stopped to do any serious thinking," said Tracy, "I'd be
in bad shape. Some men get fat on study. All I get out of it is a
feeling that there ain't anything worth fighting for. So I quit
studyin'."</p>

<p>"There is a reason for that, too," mused the girl.</p>

<p>"What's the reason?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Not now, Hugh. But you wouldn't be
running, would you, if I hadn't gotten in your road? No, I'm
pretty sure of it. You'd be circling the edges, waiting to hit
back."</p>

<p>"Presently occupied doing just that," said Tracy.</p>

<p>"See what trouble a woman can make?" Lynn murmured. "Yet all I
can say is that I am in your hands&mdash;and glad of it."</p>

<p>"Forward."</p>

<p>Out of the distance lifted the thin echo of a shot. Only one,
fading down the sides of the peak. It brought the startled look
back into the girl's eyes, but Hugh, alert, nodded his head
slowly. "That places part of the bunch. Right behind us. Here we
go, Lynn."</p>

<p>He led through the pines and into a small ravine. Abreast,
they went along this at a trot, feeling the freshness of the
morning slowly evaporate into the strengthening heat. Ahead lay
the banked ridges, each feeding into the other and all timbered.
It was a secretive land, alike protective and deceptive; for it
offered searching TS crew the same shelter it offered him. Now
regarding his surrounding quarters with a roving eye, he pulled
out of the ravine, passed across a small bare knob, and plunged
into timber again. A thin, sunless trail led upward by looping
stages. It was single file once more, the girl silent behind.</p>

<p>Going along with his attention fixed outward, he reflected
that this girl whose perceptions were so direct and to the point
had laid the situation clear enough; but for her presence in his
affairs he would not now be pointed southward out of the fight.
In effect, he was running away&mdash;and would continue to run as
long as she had need of him. It was puzzling to understand by
just what joining of events and at just what stage of time Lynn's
life had come so definitely between him and his business. But it
was so&mdash;the shift had been made. Now that he gave it more
than a moment's consideration, it astonished him enormously to
note how casual and inevitable was the complete change of weight
from his own fortunes to the girl's. He who always clung to the
main issue through principle was far afield. In a degree this
retreat meant a collapse of his resistance, for his luck depended
entirely on staying within striking distance of Shadrow and
waiting for a break. This was the only kind of a fight he could
wage; and he was too old a hand in trouble not to understand that
once he ceased to hit back he was through. Some sort of queer
destiny arranged these things. No man's luck held when the
chances went cold. He had staged one return; he could not
successfully stage another. Next time Powder country would be
closed to him. The struggle over, Shadrow would arrange all the
safeguards and barriers.</p>

<p>Yet with this fact definitely established, Hugh Tracy felt
neither regret nor resentment. The aimless wheel of chance had
pitched him into this&mdash;that was the sum of it. He knew that
he would go on with the girl, see her to safety. First things
first. Turning, he found her eyes fixed on him with an oddly
level, steady light. When he resumed his frontwise survey it was
to feel a sweeping access of energy and anger.</p>

<p>Her voice came ahead with a small musical lift. "Was that
scowl for me or for the universe, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Was I?"</p>

<p>"Didn't know you were? That means some long-range thinking.
What about, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Better not say."</p>

<p>"Good or bad thoughts?"</p>

<p>"Sort of like a mirage&mdash;mighty nice but not
permanent."</p>

<p>There was no answer for a long while. But, deeper in the
shaded silence, she said wistfully: "Usually some foundation for
a mirage, Hugh. That water floating in the sky comes from a river
somewhere actually running."</p>

<p>"Too far off for a thirsty fellow."</p>

<p>"Hugh," she said, peremptorily, "there's a streak of
unhappiness in you. Why?"</p>

<p>It was some little time before he answered that, and then very
slowly. "I should like to believe in many good things and can't
see my way clear to do it. Ever notice a horse barred from a
green field, looking at it with his under lip drooping?"</p>

<p>"You've had to fight fire with fire too long," said the girl
thoughtfully. "And I wonder it hasn't made you more bitter than
you are. Listen, Hugh, if you believe in the Powder philosophy of
strong hand winning, and if there is something you want real bad,
why don't you reach out and take it?"</p>

<p>"Things, worth having don't come that way," replied Hugh
promptly.</p>

<p>"Then," said Lynn, voice quickening, "you are not the savage
you think you are."</p>

<p>"Which leaves us right where we started."</p>

<p>"No," said the girl, "it doesn't."</p>

<p>"About this being a savage. What if I were?"</p>

<p>Lynn Isherwood said quietly, "It would make no
difference&mdash;to me."</p>

<p>"Wait here."</p>

<p>The trail pitched up to a square clearing not more than an
acre in extent. Halted on the margin of it, Tracy studied its
edges cautiously, glance digging into the farther alleyways of
pine. After a moment he went across it, saw nothing, and motioned
for the girl to come along. She arrived on the gallop, and at
this pace they pressed forward, still higher and still sheltered.
It was soft underfoot, but now and then one of the dropping hoofs
struck rock, and the muted echo of it rose accented in the
pervading hush of thisisolated country. By degrees the trail fell
off from the south to the southwest; and ahead of them, masked by
the timber but nevertheless indicated by the contour of the
earth, was the beginning of a pass that struck directly into the
up-thrust terrain. By ten o'clock they had arrived in the
heaviest of the Mogul country; at noon, going at no more than a
walk, they came to the lower stages of the pass. Tracy turned off
and led the way up a stringer of land that ended in a shelf. The
district through which they had traveled all that morning ran
away below them, gulch crisscrossing gulch. Out of the depths
came a swift and passing beam of light. Instantly Tracy focused
his attention on the spot.</p>

<p>"Sun hit some bright metal," he muttered. "Now look yonder at
that little meadow."</p>

<p>She saw them, following his outstretched arm; a column of
them, single-file, going without haste over the open. "Hugh," she
said, "it doesn't look to be such a big party."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble," answered Tracy. "Tade's split his men.
He knows he's on the right track, and he suspects what I'm aiming
to do. Unless I'm wide of the mark, he's figuring to get around
us."</p>

<p>Meanwhile his running glance passed slowly off to the
westward&mdash;to the heaving summits in the yonder distance.
Here and there some small burn or park broke the spired ranks of
pine. Far away a bare ridge creased the emerald green. Along
these breaks Tracy kept his attention, looking at one and the
other.</p>

<p>"What does Tade think you're going to do, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Cross over the summit to the west and fade into that
country," replied the man, eyes narrowed against the down-
plunging sun shafts. "Over there the timber runs on for better
than fifty miles, clear to the state line. If we make it, we're
out of the Powder complete and Tade can't afford to follow. We're
clear. Otherwise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Otherwise we're going to run into something different on to
the south?"</p>

<p>Suddenly he lifted his long arm to the west. "Away ahead.
Above this snag. Follow past it to that patch of yellow you can
just see."</p>

<p>But she shook her head after a prolonged inspection. "Don't
see anything."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, there's a party filing into Fremont Basin,
which is where this pass lets out. If we tackled the pass we'd
run right into them."</p>

<p>"You've got the eyes of an eagle."</p>

<p>Tracy turned downgrade, the girl falling behind; and the man
chuckled a little as he talked over his shoulder. "If it's a
compliment, Lynn; you better use a different bird. It's the
turkey vulture that sees well. He can leave an eagle flat-footed
on the perch. Well, we've got to continue due south, which is not
so good."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"There's a stretch of open flat desert away ahead of us. If we
can't cross this peak country and go west, we'll have to cross
the desert. That's what Tade is working for right now."</p>

<p>The girl was silent, and Hugh looked around, shaking his head.
"Now I shouldn't have said anything about it."</p>

<p>"I am in your hands," smiled the girl. "And glad of it."</p>

<p>A long riding silence fell between them as they traveled
through the afternoon, on and on into the sustained quiet of the
trees. All that broke it was the slow stamp of hoofs, the slight
squeak of leather, and the little jingle of bridle chains. Once,
around what might have been two o'clock, they arrived at a
bubbling spring and stopped for a drink; and for a few short
minutes they rested, wordless. Afterwards resuming the flight,
Tracy left what seemed the fairest trail and began a venture
along one half-obliterated runway and another. The throat of the
pass was high-water mark for them, and now they were tending
steadily downward, into the heavier heat that cushioned the
rugged earth; by degrees the underbrush lessened and they passed
into an unending prospect of senna-red pine trunks shooting up
from a thick carpet of forest mold, which received and made
soundless the pacing of the horses.</p>

<p>Any other day this virgin wilderness would have been splendid
adventure. But the girl, watching Tracy's head swing from side to
side with an increased vigilance and seeing his face more deeply
trenched by his characteristic half-scowl, was stirred with the
imparted feeling of approaching danger. The very quiet bred it.
Drawn into herself, and not wishing to disturb him, she tried to
fathom his strategy from watching their course. And finally she
understood the meaning of the apparent zigzag advance. Along a
vista she viewed the up-slanting sides of a butte. Tracy motioned
her to stay in place and spurred forward to quick slopes that
achieved a bare and broken top partially in sight. Leaving the
saddle, she rested on the earth, grateful for the chance. Time
dragged out, and the persistent hush actually oppressed her to
the point where she began studying the corridors of this forest
for hostile life. The curt, low call of a bobwhite startled her
as the boom of a cannon might have done.</p>

<p>Tracy came back a good quarter-hour later, fine sweat cropping
out on his forehead and heavy angles around the lip corners.
"Onward, Christian soldiers. By any chance do you happen to miss
breakfast and dinner?"</p>

<p>"Hadn't given them a thought," lied Lynn.</p>

<p>"Good girl, it's a long time between drinks and we're going to
move a little faster."</p>

<p>"Trouble in sight?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to speak of," said Hugh.</p>

<p>But she was not deceived, for when they got into motion again
she saw the direction change. Hugh veered off from the east and
pointed directly south once more. Passing by the butte, they went
between the walls of a rocky gulch and on into a changed terrain.
Nothing could have been more abrupt than this remarkable
transformation from the comparatively undulating belt of pines to
the jagged and grotesque area ahead. It was such a country to
which the West often applies the label "devil's garden" with
ample fitness. There was no apparent open trail through this maze
of strewn slabs and great barriers of basaltic rock cliffs
lifting from thirty to a hundred feet above them. One narrow
chasm after another marched to an obvious blind end; yet at each
such end Tracy always swung into some sort of avenue or tunnel
that led forward. Hot sunlight passed overhead; half-twilight
remained below. Stunted jack pines clung to these sharp slopes
with a dogged tenacity. And it was cool here, cool with the
promise of hidden water.</p>

<p>In spite of the tortuous route, Tracy kept the ponies at a
trot, charging down the straightaways, idling around the bends
until Lynn's head grew dizzy with the constant strain of
anticipated trouble; and so wrapped up in it was she that sundown
came unawares and dusk followed the blue-shot summer's twilight.
Tracy left her again to climb a more accessible promontory. After
a while he returned, his body only a faint silhouette above the
horse. "Tired?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lynn.</p>

<p>"You're not deceiving me any," said Tracy gently. "But we'll
have to go on for a while yet. Follow me a little closer. We're
soon out of this gorge&mdash;and into another one."</p>

<p>Full dark dropped without warning, and there was only a faint
strip of starlight above&mdash;a crooked strip cut out by the
narrow gorge rims. For a space she tried to rein the pony after
Tracy, but it only seemed to make the animal stumble, so she gave
up the attempt and let it have free head. Weariness arrived soon
enough, leaving her spine numb and her arms heavy. Once she
thought she slept, for Tracy's words came to her with a sort of
continued effect, as if he had been speaking before. They reached
an open area where the color of the night turned gray and a piece
of wind struck them slantwise: But it was of short duration, and
afterwards they appeared to descend into still greater depths of
this tortured land. A rolling, spraying sound came from ahead,
and Tracy said, "Duck." Immediately afterwards the fine film of a
waterfall covered her, shocked her out of the lethargy into which
she had fallen.</p>

<p>They were stopping a great deal and in each pause she vaguely
saw Tracy's body bending forward in the saddle as if to penetrate
the pall ahead. And each time they pressed on, his voice would
run gently behind him. She knew he was reassuring her, buoying
her up&mdash;the thoughtful act of a kindly man. Once, before she
had known him, all his reported acts had made a different
impression upon her. She had thought of him as wild and uncaring
and a little ruthless. A supreme individualist, moved only by his
own transient emotions. But it had been a false estimate. Beneath
the hardness and the skepticism of Hugh Tracy was a fine
gentility. It was an odd blending. In one day's time he could
pound a man with his fists, intent on destruction; and in that
same day he could speak to her as one who guarded something
fragile. As brief as was her acquaintance with him, she had seen
him act in the extremes of temper where the bottommost character
of the man had stood naked; and so she thought she knew him as
well as anybody ever would. The outward face of him was full of
contradictions, cross-purposes, dark reflections; beneath lay an
unerrant simplicity. It was her privilege to see this, not his.
He never would know himself, for his type showed best in action
and loved introspection not at all. One thing was as certain as
the gleaming stars: he would never change, and the full-blooded
energy in him would drive him relentlessly on to the end.</p>

<p>These thoughts rose in her slowly over the long interval, to
provide a kind of anesthesia against the strain of the flight.
Thrown back upon herself, she lost all sense of the passing
hours, and thus at last woke with a start to find the forward
motion stopped. Her pony stood jaded on the sightless trail;
Tracy was gone. It was with some effort that she repressed the
quick desire to call out and dispel the feeling of being utterly
alone; yet she did, at last catching a sound of Tracy roving
somewhere ahead. When he returned, it was to drift beside her,
his shape quite blurred in the black.</p>

<p>"We camp here," he said.</p>

<p>Plainly there was a disappointment in his voice, and she
fought back her weariness to answer him: "If you're worrying
about me, don't. I can go on."</p>

<p>"Not now. We've traveled as far as we dare without sight of
something. Follow me."</p>

<p>He went ahead slowly for perhaps a hundred yards and Lynn,
close behind, felt some great shape envelop her. If anything, the
density of the night increased. Tracy was down. His helping hand
reached up to her and guided her to the uncertain ground. "Stay
here," he murmured. He was away again, this time with the horses.
Cold wind poured like water along some natural crevice to cut
through the clothing; looking above, she saw a wider patch of
sky, and from that judged they had reached a more open area.
Tracy's murmured talk arrived ahead of him. He touched her and
drew her with him. The bite of the wind suddenly ceased, and his
words rang back with a hollow, dampered effect:</p>

<p>"Natural room in the side of the cliff; Duck your head,
Lynn."</p>

<p>Her shoulder points scraped the jaws of a narrow aperture.
Inside, she somehow felt that the ceiling of this vault swept
away from her. Tracy led her on, placed her against a wall. "We
can afford to have a little fire in here. I'll only be gone a
moment."</p>

<p>But the moment stretched out dismally. The oddest of sounds
filled this cavern, a subdued muttering and bubbling and groaning
that appeared to rise from beneath her feet. Suppressing the
instinctive fears such as every human feels in the presence of
the unknown, Lynn put both hands against the wall and, slowly
swung her head from side to side. Then suddenly she got the
meaning of that weird uneasiness and laughed silently at herself.
It was nothing more than the wind currents playing across the
mouth of the cavern and making a sort of vast musical jug out of
it. Tracy tramped noisily along the corridor and entered the
vault, dropping something on the floor.</p>

<p>"What I most dislike about passing up a few meals," said he,
conversationally, "is the fact that you just miss that many times
to enjoy one of the simple pleasures of a highly complicated
life. I wouldn't swear to it, but I think we'll probably eat
around tomorrow noon."</p>

<p>Matchlight burst the black, and a little raveling flame shot
upward from an arranged pile of sage stems and pine branches. But
the incipient fire immediately dropped to a sulky glow, finding
no draught of air to fan it. Tracy tried again, grumbling to
himself. Presently the pitch particles on the pine branches
caught and sputtered, and the girl saw Tracy's face outlined in
the thin blaze with a sort of saturnine thoughtfulness on it.
Going over, she dropped to her knees and watched his fingers
feeding in the more inflammable twigs.</p>

<p>"The Good Lord," went on Tracy, squinting at his chore,
"provided a natural line rider's cabin here. But I doubt if
there's anybody beside myself that knows of it, I ran into it one
winter, badly needing some shelter."</p>

<p>"Won't the fire show, outside?"</p>

<p>"No. The passageway is crooked enough to block the light."</p>

<p>The blaze grew by fitful assaults on the wood. Tracy laid on
half a dozen substantial broken jack-pine branches and went out
agairi, presently returning with the saddles and saddle blankets.
He laid both blankets neatly on the floor. "Your bed," said he.
"And I'm sorry I forgot about the springs and mattress."</p>

<p>"One blanket for you," answered Lynn.</p>

<p>"I'll be outside, keeping an eye peeled," said Hugh after a
studied silence.</p>

<p>Lynn rose suddenly and went around him. She took up one of the
blankets, came back, and laid it on the floor, thus making two
beds, one on either side of the fire. "Hugh," she said quietly,
"you are not being as direct as I expect you to be. There's no
need of a guard and you know it. The subterfuge isn't really
necessary."</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy looked up to her. "There's only the fire between
those two blankets, Lynn."</p>

<p>"Even that isn't necessary."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," muttered Tracy, staring into the heart of
the flames. Oddly brusque, he went on. "It is better than
midnight. And we'll have to be on our way by four o'clock. Better
rest."</p>

<p>She sank down with a small amused sound of discomfort and
slowly pulled off her boots. "You'll sleep in here, Hugh, and
I'll be the more comfortable for knowing it. Wouldn't it be silly
of me to send you outside? I'm not an old maid."</p>

<p>Cross-legged by the heat, he rolled a cigarette and sorted out
a glowing twig to light it. The girl struggled free from her
coat, folded it for a pillow; she loosened the leg lacings of her
riding breeches, pulled the blanket around her Indian fashion,
and clasped her hands about her knees. Blood-red shadows danced
shutter-like on the suggestion of walls to either side of them;
yet seemingly they were in the core of a sphere that had no
definite circumference. All that was tangible was the fire and
these two people about it.</p>

<p>The girl watched Tracy's face, finding the rugged bronze of
its surface overlaid by troubled imprints. Leaning forward, she
spoke gently at him. "Never worry. What happens will happen. We
have had the day together&mdash;and that is something, to
me."</p>

<p>"Ahead of us," said Tracy reflectively, "is a bad piece. We've
got within shouting distance of the desert. In the morning we'll
have to cross&mdash;before clear daylight comes. It's only about
a mile wide, and there's plenty of shelter on the farther edge.
But we wasted a lot of time coming along the rough country, and
it's likely Shadrow will have men posted out there now. That's
why I didn't go on tonight. Couldn't afford to run into his crew
on the trail."</p>

<p>"It's up to you. But will daylight be any better?"</p>

<p>"There's an old Apache trick of waiting till just before first
light comes in the morning. Most Indians attacked at that hour,
figuring the other side to be worn down to sleep. That's when
we'll try. The TS crowd will be asleep&mdash;I hope."</p>

<p>"Otherwise we run and pray?"</p>

<p>"It's certain we'll run," drawled Hugh.</p>

<p>Silence came between them, and there was no sound save the
wind plucking away at the mouth of the cavern and the slight hiss
of the burning sticks. Tracy tossed his cigarette into the blaze,
laid on the rest of the pine fragments. Light flashed against the
gray surfaces of his eyes and turned all the squarish fighting
features more indomitably stubborn. But the watching girl,
etching all this picture of him into her memory, saw something
she had not seen before&mdash;a hint of patience, a painstaking,
hard-held patience created out of the unruly spirit that so
habitually turned against this manner of mildness.</p>

<p>Tracy took to poking the ashes with a stem of sage. "Lynn, you
have no relatives left, outside of Tade?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He has all your money?"</p>

<p>"Until I am twenty-three. Why?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, scowling at the flames. After a while the
girl went on: "That's not your worry, Hugh. It is mine. I am
perfectly capable of making my own way in the world. Who do you
suppose ran my father's hotel and his business affairs? He
didn't. He spent the days dreaming. I have worked hard. I can
again. Now quit thinking of it."</p>

<p>A little show of amusement appeared on his face. "Tade's got
no kin except you. Ever stop to think, Lynn, that unless he wills
it formally otherwise, you're the inheritor of that ranch?"</p>

<p>"What an encouraging thought!" said the girl. "Have you a
pencil and such a thing as a paper?"</p>

<p>He produced the pencil readily, but searched himself at length
for the paper, finally producing a rectangular slip which he
passed over with an accompanying explanation. "Long time ago I
took that blank check and started for Antelope to buy some cows,
which was to be the beginning of my own ranchin' ventures. I
never reached Antelope. They nailed me with a .30-.30 from the
rim, and Bill Vivian found me six hours later, same as dead. That
was the shot which set off all this. And the check's still blank.
Always will be now."</p>

<p>She made a few stray lines on the clear side and suddenly gave
over the attempt. Unconsciously she put these things beside her
blanket instead of giving them back to him. "Good-night,
Hugh."</p>

<p>For the first time this last hour, he allowed himself a full
and free glance at her. The ash hair lay loosely beautiful on her
head, and she sat with her small, definite shoulders a little
forward while the firelight brought out the robust, alluring
symmetry of her throat and breast. The languor of physical
weariness softened her face. Heavy-lidded, her eyes met his
squarely with the oddest of lights in them, enigmatic and warm;
and her lips were drawn half apart, smiling.</p>

<p>"Good-night," said Tracy.</p>

<p>Suddenly she held out her hand and he took it, gripped it and
leaned forward, seeing the pulse in the hollow of her throat beat
more swiftly.</p>

<p>"Lynn&mdash;" he muttered, and bore down on himself with all
the iron pressure of his will. "I warned you," he said,
roughly.</p>

<p>Her hand remained still; all her body was quiet.</p>

<p>"There's something in your mind," said Tracy and waited for an
answer, black head bent toward her, doggedly trying to read what
was in her face. Yet what he found was elusive, smilingly hidden.
And finally he drew back his hand. Her own dropped to the
blanket. She said, gravely:</p>

<p>"I was wondering if I could believe you when you said that you
took nothing by force&mdash;that nothing gained by force was
permanent. Well, Hugh, I do believe you&mdash;now." Lying back,
she pulled the folded coat under her head, wrapped the blanket
around her. Hugh leaned forward to fold it across her feet. The
gray-blue regard reached up to him slantwise, almost closed out
by her heavy lids.</p>

<p>"Lynn," he muttered, "never do that again. It might have
turned out another way."</p>

<p>"So? Yet it didn't, Hugh, and this is the happy end of an
unhappy day. You've a right to spank me. But I'll sleep soundly,
knowing you're here. Wake me when you want."</p>

<p>She was asleep as soon as the words were spoken, half curled
in the blanket and one hand stretched toward him. Over the dying
fire, Tracy watched the faintly smiling face until the light grew
dim: Afterwards he reached for his own blanket and put it over
her. Bolt upright, he waited out the laggard day.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12. &mdash; THE FILLED
CHECK</h2>

<p class="first">THAT last hour before dawn, when the courage and
vitality of man ebb furthest out and the banked fires of life
sink lowest, was perhaps the most miserable experience Hugh Tracy
ever had endured. It was his third night of sleeplessness, save
for an intermittent catnap or so; it was the fifth since he had
set himself against the outgoing tide of fortune. Like most
riding men, he had little surplus tissue to use. Strong as he
was, the intense activity of his body immediately broke up the
energy supplied it by food; and without food the physical engines
swiftly fell to idling speed. So now he suffered the inevitable
consequences of his fasting. Worn ragged, along with his
responsibilities, he was bitterly assailed by the hosts of defeat
and futility; and in this hour they were hard to shake off. All
he could do was bite his teeth together and wait, summon up that
patience of which he possessed so little and stare into the
blackness like some East Indian fanatic undergoing scarification
of the flesh. Nor was anything in all his career as enormously
relieving as the sight of the first faint light breaking through
the vault's aperture.</p>

<p>Instantly he rose, stiff and sore from his cold vigil, and
went out. Actually there was no daylight yet but only a graying
of the densely packed shadows. Great clouds of mist rolled
sluggishly through the canyon, faintly to be seen, striking him
with a perceptible impact and leaving a film of dampness on his
face. Rolling a cigarette, he tried three matches before one
would stay lighted in the emulsified rain. Gradually, very
gradually at first, the rims of the canyon began to shape up,
rather low and comparatively far apart. Above the mists was an
expanding brightness.</p>

<p>This last fact warned him to be on the move. Once the morning
started to break, it would come with a rush, summer's full rose
dawn pouring out of the east. Turning down to another part of the
canyon, he got his tethered ponies&mdash;blanketed with
dew&mdash;and brought them back; and going into the vault, he
woke the girl.</p>

<p>"Another day, Lynn. Starlight's soon gone."</p>

<p>It mildly astonished him to see how swiftly she woke, and how
alertly. Those brief hours of repose seemed enough to fill that
slim, splendid body with force again. She came upright in the
blankets, face a luminous and blurred oval before him, and her
talk broke along the dismal cavern with a brisk gayety. "Hugh,"
she said, "did you ever give our poor cave ancestors a thought?
No wonder the men went out and slew the saber-tooth with clubs
and stones. After this sort of a bed, I feel half a savage
myself."</p>

<p>"Bad night?"</p>

<p>"No. Wonderful night. I went down and down and down to the
bottom of creation and never stirred. Even dreamed of wonderful
things."</p>

<p>"As how?"</p>

<p>"That all was to be well. There was an ending, a fine ending.
I was standing in a peach orchard, eating like a pig. I guess
that's why it seemed such a good dream. I never did, in all my
life, have enough peaches to eat."</p>

<p>"I can appreciate the fruit," he drawled, "but a black pot
full of coffee would hit me better."</p>

<p>"What do you expect of a dream?" asked Lynn, rising. "You want
these blankets, don't you?"</p>

<p>He took them, caught up the gear, and went out to saddle the
horses. In that short space of time the curling mists were
beginning to show cotton edges and had perceptibly thinned. Long
as he had been in the country, he never ceased to be surprised at
the sudden march of day; and now he realized that it would be a
toss-up whether or not he reached the desert strip while the dusk
remained. When the girl came out, he said as much. "We'll just
make it&mdash;barely make it."</p>

<p>Mounted, she bent forward to see him more clearly. "You didn't
sleep, Hugh."</p>

<p>"Afraid to. Ordinarily I can set my mind at any hour and wake
within ten minutes of the time. But not unless I've had the
normal amount of sleep under my belt. In that respect I'm a
little short-weighted to date. Here we go."</p>

<p>He struck southward again. There was the beginning of a long
grade, and to left and right the canyon walls ran increasingly
lower. Water boiled out of a rock spring; a four-foot rattler lay
full length on the trail, touching off the ponies.</p>

<p>"An omen, if you're looking for one," murmured Hugh. They came
to the top of the grade, out of the long canyon at last. A belt
of timber was to the fore, and the trail struck directly into it.
Beyond the tree tops was the promise of a sweeping open. But to
the west the trees ran up another small butte, a vantage point of
some consequence. Hugh led that way, finding the ground clear
enough to advance on the trot until the incline grew sharply
severe. Within a hundred yards they were above the fog wreaths.
The girl, looking eastward through a break in the pines, spoke
quietly: "Another clear, hot day coming, Hugh, there's always a
promise in the morning."</p>

<p>Tracy looked around, smiling slightly, and then drove ahead,
up the last fold of the butte. They made slow time through a
dense growth of brush and were wet to the skin when they finally
halted on the butte's bald top. Anyway but westward they had a
clear view of the world; and here for the first time Lynn saw the
southern desert strip which began at the very foot of the butte.
Perhaps a mile beyond that flat surface the looming sides of
another hill series stood half concealed in the shadows. To the
east&mdash;all along the rim of the far-flung Powder&mdash;was a
widening crack of clear violet light.</p>

<p>Tracy had crossed the open and now stood facing the northern
sweep of timber&mdash;that area out of which they had come.
"Lynn," he called.</p>

<p>The girl swung about and cantered to where he was.</p>

<p>He lifted a pointing arm, and she saw without further
explanation what he meant. Over there in a clearing the crimson
wedge of a morning fire split the twilight.</p>

<p>"It's Shadrow&mdash;twenty minutes behind us and in no
hurry."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I said he was in no hurry. If he was he'd be on the rustle by
now. But he's made a point of lighting that fire for us to see.
We won't go that way, will we? We'll head for the desert. He
knows that. He's all ready for it."</p>

<p>"You really believe he has men out in the desert?"</p>

<p>"Certain of it. Either on this edge in the trees, or else on
the far edge."</p>

<p>"No other way we can go?"</p>

<p>"Not now," said Hugh.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him a long while, a certain quiet
concentration in her eyes. "It is you they'll shoot at, Hugh. Not
me."</p>

<p>"The last run," he reflected, "is out there. Not so much of a
run and soon over. Beyond, we're safe. Shadrow can't drag his men
any farther from TS without leaving his headquarters unguarded.
It's a guessing game, and our guess is as good as his. He can't
tell at just what point we leave this line of timber. So if he's
posted some of the crew it's more likely they'll be on the
opposite side, watching us come. I'm going to walk down the slope
and have a look before we start."</p>

<p>The girl nodded, clouded thoughtfulness across her brow. Tracy
looked up at her quickly. "Afraid of it, Lynn?"</p>

<p>"For you."</p>

<p>"That's out. They've tried for me too many times. Their luck's
gone. Wait right here."</p>

<p>He walked away in long strides and soon fell down the slope,
losing sight of her as the trees took him. The trail dropped
sharply, dipped into a ravine and out again. Four hundred yards
brought him to the sandy margin of the desert floor; and, paused
there beside a tree trunk, he made his survey of the roundabout
area. It was, he realized, not much of a reconnaissance and
reassured him only to the extent of the immediate vicinity.
Backed up by his hunch in the matter, he decided that Shadrow had
not placed any of the hands at this initial point of departure.
Out on the desert he could find nothing suggestive. "No," he
mused, "it's the way I figured. He'll have his dogs crawlin'
yonder at the foot of that ridge&mdash;watching me come." There
was nothing to be done about it, and no more calculation could
help; so thinking, he turned back at the half-run.</p>

<p>He had wasted a good quarter-hour, and the pale eastern glow
was gradually coming upon the land. On the edge of the butte's
bald space he halted dead.</p>

<p>Only his horse stood there. The girl and her horse had
gone.</p>

<p>"Lynn."</p>

<p>The echo beat back from the glistening green margin of the
timber of the clearing and warned him to be still. Waiting a
moment&mdash;a quick alarm spreading through him&mdash;he
listened into that deep silence for some other rumor of sound,
some disturbance of brush. Yet the moments fled and nothing
materialized. Then his turning glance reached as far as the pony
to discover Lynn's felt hat hanging on the saddle horn. That put
him to instant motion. Rushing forward, he seized the hat; as he
did so a dislodged slip of paper eddied gently to the earth.</p>

<p>He knew then what had happened. Even as he reached down he
understood that this act of the girl's had been thought over last
night in the vault, thought over and prepared for. That slip was
the blank check he had given her; on the reverse side of it this
was written:</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">You should have seen this last night. It was
what I was trying to tell you. All of my love and all of
me&mdash;as long as you ever shall want me. No matter what
happens, you have a right to know that. But there is no other
way&mdash;and this seems the only decent thing for me to do.
Should anything happen to you I could never, never smile
again.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Lynn</span>.</p>

<p><br>
He was instantly in the saddle, racing for the northern edge
of the butte. But on the point of dipping down its far slope, he
reined in. From this eminence he could see three or four trails
winding through the trees, and on none of them did Lynn appear.
She had gone on, into the deeper timber; and by now must be
halfway to Shadrow's campfire. "Lord love her," he muttered, "she
has done the wrong thing, trying to help me."</p>

<p>For it was all very clear to him. She would go to Shadrow to
check the pursuit, to argue with her uncle, to take away at least
half of the man's reason for being on the trail. These were her
aims&mdash;and she would fail in them. Inevitably she would fail,
not knowing Shadrow's basic character. The TS owner would never
stop, once having come this near to success. Moreover, Lynn's
appearance would be a sure sign of how near at hand the game was.
It would not stop Shadrow. It would put him in motion so much the
sooner.</p>

<p>"And she was thinking I could ride away, to come and fight
another day," said Tracy, staring up to the brightening sky. "No.
There is no new deal. Can't be and won't be. He's got her again,
for whatever he pleases to do. Now I've got to hit back&mdash;
quick."</p>

<p>Across the still air rolled a report that went flattening away
along the corridors of this rough land; and as if it were a
signal for him instead of for others&mdash;which he knew it to
be&mdash;he swung across the butte's top and quartered down in
the direction of that canyon out of which he had earlier brought
Lynn. "Tade," he muttered, "is notifying the surrounding scouts
to be up and hunting." Then, twenty feet forward on his course,
he sharply checked, once more arrested by the long reach of two
rifle echoes. One seemed to rise out of the canyon below; the
other came from the opposite side of the butte, more remotely
placed. Whatever his improvised plan, he discarded it now; no
clearer signal could have told him that he was boxed in on at
least three sides of the butte. His original thinking had been
right&mdash;there was but one way out, and that ahead, across the
desert. Wheeling, he descended to the very margin of the desert.
All the overlying shadows were breaking, and the farther hills
were suddenly and blackly definite against the horizon. Glancing
to left and to right, Hugh rode from the protecting trees and
aimed for a fissure in those hills a mile away.</p>

<p>Even as he left shelter behind he understood clearly what was
to come about. This was sound sagebrush hunting. Having driven
him from cover, which was the culmination of their long campaign,
they could now crack down. But for the moment, this general
conviction was split into sections of worry; and his strongest
worry was for his exposed rear. Along the near edge of timber
just left behind, an ambushed gun might well enough reach him.
Crouched in the saddle, he played the horse for all that it would
give, instantly feeling that the beast was beaten before it
started. Being a TS animal&mdash;the one he had taken from the
ranch porch&mdash;it suffered the usual Shadrow practice of
underfeeding and had further been punished by the last thirty
hours of hard usage. There was no freshness in the pony, its
stride was ragged, and already it began to draw deeply for wind.
Meanwhile, Tracy's screwed-up attention failed to catch the half-
expected detonation out of the rear. Looking about, he saw only
the unbroken fringes of the trees, some three or four hundred
yards away by now; and a little reassured, he pulled up to a
canter, nursing what little reserve there was in his mount for a
contingency he expected to develop before much more time elapsed.
At this pace, he gained the long furrow of a small arroyo, dipped
into it, and rose out again.</p>

<p>Beyond it, halfway over the flat, he saw them coming at
him.</p>

<p>It was exactly as he believed and feared. Considerably to the
rightward of that fissure toward which he bent his flight, and
perhaps a thousand yards distant, six riders spilled from shelter
and drove diagonally across the desert for him. Directly across
his path rose a sudden-ripped jet of dust and afterwards a
rifle's laggard report reached out. That was long-distance
shooting&mdash;and from behind. Twisting, he discovered a pair of
horsemen following from the canyon country at a dead tilt. Thus
his position was, bracketed and unsheltered, cut off from
protection either way. It was, he thought again with the old
heedless anger drumming up in him, exactly as he had believed and
feared. The men of Powder, versed in all the shrewd tricks of
warfare, had performed the logical surround of quarry.</p>

<p>A second puff of dust streaked the desert, more off-target
than the first had been, and again the echo came from behind.
Those following two were trying for the odd chance of a hit at a
moving bull's-eye better than nine hundred yards distant. But
these men he ruled out of his mind immediately. Reaching forward
to the saddle boot, he drew up his rifle. At the same time he
roweled the pony to a full run, shifting to a more easterly
course. The oncoming six saw the maneuver and adjusted themselves
accordingly; and for a space of time it became a parallel running
fight that forced him deeper and deeper into the desert's open
strip and put those hills he was trying to reach the farther
away. Compactly stated; they had him entirely in their hands.
Meanwhile he detected a slight inward shift on their part, and
this he could not match without being thrown back on the rear two
who potted away, regardless of luck. He thought once of facing
about and charging that pair, taking his chances on getting back
to the canyon country again. But it was only a brief thought and
soon discarded. Behind the pair, he realized, all of Shadrow's
group somewhere advanced.</p>

<p>"I'll follow my nose," he muttered and hooked the reins about
the saddle horn. Lifting his rifle, he began a raking attack on
the outstretched party of six. His first shot fell useless and
unseen in the distance. The second appeared to land directly
beneath a horse, for the animal pitched high and bucked crazily,
jamming up the following riders. Tracy pumped a third shell into
the chamber and held his fire, at once realizing he played the
part of a sucker. That group closed on him yard by yard, his own
horse was beginning to tremble with exhaustion, and the bullets
smacked out of the rear with a closer effect. They were fooling
with him, and all he actually did now was spar against the sure
finish. The thought went through him like fire, and his swelling
temper exploded. "By God," he swore, "I never win playin'
patient! Now we'll see who caves in first!" He brought the pony
sharply out of its paralleling course and aimed straight for the
bunch.</p>

<p>At the most it was a narrow six hundred yards, and they hadn't
yet gone for their rifles. Wondering about that, he opened up,
savagely trying for the hit. His last bullet found one. A harse
buckled at the knees and went plunging down, throwing its rider
in a high and whirling arc through the air. It checked the
others. The whole line whipped around, swept back to the fallen
man and screened him for a passing moment. Thumbing fresh
cartridges into the gun, he saw them bunch up. A yelling talk
crossed the prairie and a quick-flung curse came after. Two men
spurred up to the prone figure and dismounted, dropping flat to
the earth. The other three wheeled and charged. Gone stone-cold,
nothing left in his mind but the overmastering desire to destroy,
Hugh dragged his pony back on its haunches and jumped down.
Prone, he leveled the sights full on the most advanced of those
three and held the aim a long second. The two who had dug in by
the fallen man were opening up a steady fire. Dust banners made a
powdered fog beside him; his horse grunted, struggled away, and
fell. And his squeezing finger drove a bullet into the yonder
rider. That rider pitched out of the saddle without a sound. The
others bent low and curved to get around Tracy, who tried again,
missed his mark, and then aimed for a horse. It was a good shot.
The horse fell; the unsaddled hand lay as if stunned.</p>

<p>It left the remaining rider alone against the skyline, and
that fact appeared to dishearten him. His reaction was to wheel
away, throw himself Indian fashion far over to one side of the
mount, and race back. Meanwhile the dumped fellow lay flattened
and took up the argument with his revolver futilely. Tracy,
thinking of the two hands who followed him out of the canyon
country, turned to see where they were, and caught only the tops
of their ponies showing above the small arroyo some distance
behind.</p>

<p>Steadying himself to the frontal attack again, he was
astonished by a series of spanging echoes crossing the flat from
the southern hills&mdash;from that shelter he was strrving to
reach. It was a heavy and increasing fire, and he saw its effect
instantly, the dropping lead beating up dust whorls about the
riflemen who had elected to fortify themselves by the one who had
first been pitched from his saddle. At that, the lone fellow left
mounted made a complete circle as if essaying to catch the
direction of this new attack. He cried out something to the
others and then fled&mdash;cutting a detour around Tracy and
striking out for the canyon country behind. Tracy hugged his gun
butt and riveted his attention on the TS riflemen, whose attack
abruptly fell off. He saw them crouched half on their knees.</p>

<p>"Running," he muttered. "All right, that's fair." He held his
bullet, giving them the chance. Both sprang up at the same time
and raced for the waiting ponies. They were asaddle the next
moment, following the lead of the first retreating hand. Those
far guns in the hills bore down with a malicious purpose, all the
dust whorls jetting up short of the fugitives.</p>

<p>Out of this furious melee had come a break of luck. The horse
of that rider he had fairly hit stood now directly to the fore,
reins down. Casting up his accounts rapidly, Tracy decided to run
for the animal. Beforehand, however, he looked behind again and
saw that those two in the arroyo were swiftly departing from it,
bound back to the canyon country. So, save for the unhorsed
fellow now banging away with the revolver, he was in the clear.
Tracy bellowed out: "You'll never reach me with that! Go
on&mdash;leg it! I'll hold my fire!" But the man's hat made a
stubborn wagging from side to side. He refused to move.</p>

<p>"He's thinking," reflected Tracy, "that I'll do a Spanish on
him. That's what he'd do, in my shoes. Well&mdash;" He bit off
the remark and cursed at himself. "No. He's figuring Shadrow's
bunch will be here in a minute."</p>

<p>He looked around once more and discovered the guess was right.
Over beneath the outline of the same butte from which he had
earlier departed, a long line of riders broke into the clear and
came dusting on. Tracy lifted himself to his feet and made a rush
for the idle pony.</p>

<p>The lone TS hand turned on the earth and aimed at the horse
with his revolver, clearly meaning to kill it. Tracy yelled
violently at him: "Stop that, you fool!" and came to a stand,
whipping up the rifle. The man saw that gesture from the corner
of his eyes and abruptly switched his aim again; trying for
Tracy. It was two hundred yards and no distance for a short
piece; yet he tried. Deliberately aiming, he took up the trigger
slack. But he never let the bullet go. The man suddenly put both
elbows on the sand, throwing his gun away. At that, Tracy wheeled
and renewed his rush for the horse. One rear glance found
Shadrow's party half across the desert.</p>

<p>The firing from the hills had stopped, leaving a strange
silence after all the rolling echoes had played through the
brightening morning. Running, to within fifty feet of the
riderless pony, Tracy dropped to a walk and went on with a
murmured reassurance. He expected a bolt, but the pony, trained
to stand on dropped reins, only fiddled about those two hanging
bits of leather. Tracy strode on, seized them. He was in the
leather and away. Suddenly a long firing beat out of the hills
again. Behind was a ragged shouting and a fusillade from
Shadrow's crew. Tracy bent down and aimed the pony's ears for
that fissure he had been so stubbornly trying to reach. Flanking
a pile of rock rubble, he struck up a short incline. Jack pines
flashed by, and then the green tall timber of the ridge came down
to meet him. There was a clear trail leading on to the heights.
In that trail stood Bill Vivian. Tracy pulled up.</p>

<p>"Well," said Vivian with a deceptive, conversational calm,
"it's me that always pulls you out of a jackpot. Don't you never
learn, Mister Tracy?"</p>

<p>"So you're here?" grunted Hugh.</p>

<p>"Who in thunder did you expect?" retorted Vivian. "Where else
ought I be?"</p>

<p>Tracy scowled at the little man out of his heavy, red-rimmed
eyes. "Off pickin' daisies, you mug. That's where I usually find
you."</p>

<p>Bill Vivian gave voice to a short and disparaging phrase and
looked across the desert. "If that bunch means to come this way,
we've got to get on the boat. Follow me, Hugh. The boys are up in
the brush."</p>

<p>"Hold on," said Tracy; watching the yonder space closely.
Shadrow's crew spread into the shallow arroyo which marked the
middle of the desert strip and halted there. The unhorsed rider
went running back, waving his arms. Eastward, a long flare of
sunlight burst over the rim, and the world began to assume a
still and harsh and burning aspect. Shadow and brightness
alternately cut the distant rugged country into jagged sections;
all the desert turned to a white glare. The unhorsed rider
reached Shadrow's main party, stood beside a mounted figure, and
talked with a continued gesturing. Then the mounted figure
spurred forward, alone. Presently he halted and turned back. One
fist shook skyward.</p>

<p>"Something," mused Vivian, "seems to be wrong with his
army."</p>

<p>A long pause followed, after which the whole line of hands
came out of the arroyo and cantered ahead: Then, from the
timbered section directly above Tracy, a blast of concerted
firing rushed out and shattered the pervading stillness.
Attention still pinned to Shadrow's party, Hugh saw the sudden
dust whorls dappling the desert around that deploying line. The
effect of the firing was instant. The foremost man wheeled and
threw his arm overhead, at which the whole line reversed itself
and surged back for the canyon country. Nobody paid any attention
to the TS fellow afoot. All the riders swept by him and he
followed on the trot.</p>

<p>"The rewards of faithfulness," muttered Tracy, watching the
man stumble through the shot-sprayed dust.</p>

<p>Bill Vivian struck out a disappointed oath. "There goes the
chance I figured was ours. Hell's pit!"</p>

<p>"Now just how was it you knew I might be this far south?"
demanded Hugh.</p>

<p>"We was on the high point by Dead Axle grade and we saw a fire
burnin over by the butte early this morning. So, havin' picked up
part of Shadrow's trail yesterday&mdash;we been scoutin' steady
since you left TS on the run&mdash;we made the good guess you was
bein' chased, over here. Well, we made it down from Dead Axle in
forty minutes and got here in time to see you come into the flat.
You sure tipped our hand. We figured you'd make it here with the
hounds on your heels. That would've been fine. We could of
pinched them in on the trail here. But it was sure news to us
that some more TS hog heads were hidin' on this side. When they
came out to cramp you down we had to take steps."</p>

<p>"How did you know Shadrow was on my heels or that I'd left TS
on the run?"</p>

<p>"One of Tade's men deserted him yesterday and rode to Antelope
to spread the news. We had a fellow in Antelope listenin' for
dope. He came right on and told us."</p>

<p>Hugh grumbled. "Who in thunder is 'we'?"</p>

<p>"Follow me," grinned Bill Vivian, and scrambled up the stiff
side of the trail. Hugh followed slowly, leading his horse.
Through a fringe of pines, he came upon a semi-circular clearing
that faced the desert. And on the edges of the clearing,
flattened on the dirt and faced out in the direction of the now
disappearing Shadrow bunch, lay ten dusty figures.</p>

<p>"Here's the pilgrim," said Vivian laconically.</p>

<p>They turned then and Hugh, looking along that row of slim and
reckless cheeks, felt a deep stirring of emotion, a quick
lightness of heart. These were men he knew. They were his
friends, his riding partners of old. They were his kind. He
cleared his throat and looked away from them.</p>

<p>"You're a tough-looking set of sand fleas," he muttered.
"Where've you been for three months?"</p>

<p>"Gaze upon 'em," gloated Bill. "When I left you on the spur
the other night I proceeded to all the hide-outs in this country.
I got 'em. You bet I got 'em. Morally, they ain't worth a damn. A
more sinful collection of monkeys you never laid eyes on. But
here they are, Hugh&mdash;the best of a bad lot. Sabe Venner's
lost flesh since you seen him last."</p>

<p>One slender giant rose up with a broad grin. "What big teeth
you got, Grammaw. Hugh, Lord bless your homely self.
Welcome&mdash;and now that we're duly assembled and constituted,
what's next in this giddy whirl?"</p>

<p>Bill Vivian made a vulgar sound with his lips. "It's always
like this, dammit. I ain't general no more when Hugh comes
around."</p>

<p>"Shadrow," said Hugh, watching the far hills, "is going home.
That's certain. He's finished with this chase. He'll be back at
TS by noon, cooking up another mess of hell."</p>

<p>"Say," put in Bill Vivian, "where's the girl you was supposed
to've kidnapped?"</p>

<p>"How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"It's all over the Powder."</p>

<p>"She went back to Shadrow," said Tracy slowly. "To help
me."</p>

<p>"Trust a woman to gum up the works."</p>

<p>Tracy, weary and irritable, said gruffly: "Shut up, Bill. Your
knowledge of human nature is only exceeded by your Christian
benevolence. But does Powder know anything about Bat Testervis
being in that kidnapping?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," answered Bill, full of interest. "Was he?"</p>

<p>"That's odd," murmured Hugh. "Is there anything to eat in this
outfit?"</p>

<p>Sabe Venner moved forward. "Eatin' breakfast is next up.
Somebody start a fire while I hack off the bacon."</p>

<p>"By God," grunted Hugh, slowly settling full length on the
ground, "I'm tired. Have to get an hour's sleep. Punch me when
that bacon's ready."</p>

<p>"This will interest you," said Bill Vivian. "We've found out
that things ain't going so well on TS. This man that left 'em
went on to say that there wasn't no more than forty
hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sabe Venner bent over Hugh and looked curiously into the
latter's face. "He's asleep, Bill. Dead as a doorknob."</p>

<p>All those grave-eyed hands walked up and stared at the
prostrate Hugh. "I've seen him plenty," reflected Sabe, "but, by
Jodey, I never seen him like that. Never thought he had a
limit."</p>

<p>Bill Vivian unsaddled a horse swiftly and got the blanket. He
laid it over Hugh and looked around him with a slant-eyed
severity. "You lousebound eggs, be quiet. We stick here till
noon, see? He sleeps till noon."</p>

<p>"Well," Sabe Venner wanted to know, "what'll we do then?"</p>

<p>"He'll have a damned good idea when he wakes up," prophesied
Bill. "He always does. Meanwhile I guess I'm still general.
There's got to be a scout put out on top of Dead Axle grade. And
somebody's got to slide over Mogul, and look down into Antelope.
You, Sabe. And Willy Bones. Willy for the Antelope business. He
knows Shadrow soil best."</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13. &mdash; FIRE BURNS FROM THE
CENTER</h2>

<p class="first">AT NOONING Shadrow returned to TS with his crew
and Lynn Isherwood. The girl immediately dismounted and
disappeared inside the house; as for the men, they halted there
in the sultry baking heat of that ugly plaza and waited Shadrow's
word. Hungry, caked with trail dust, they stared at the owner
sullenly. The cook of the outfit came from the kitchen, saw the
arrivals, and returned to his pots, muttering. A hand&mdash;one
of the guards left to protect the quarters&mdash;walked slowly
from the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>Shadrow's face was the color of clay and putty. Deep, lines
slashed his slack skin, his lip corners curved cruelly downward,
and when he stepped to the ground it was with an air of physical
infirmity quite noticeable to the group. But presently he drew up
his rickety shoulders and pushed his odd head forward to return
the massed inspection. A blaze of insolent temper poured out of
the red-flecked eyes; and suddenly the heat of that wrath hit
them. "You're a sick-lookin' bunch of whelps! Don't stand there
and gawk! Get the hell out of my sight! Leave your horses
saddled!"</p>

<p>The members of the crew shifted toward the racks, dismounted,
and ambled off to the bunkhouses. Tolbert and Maunders remained
with the old man, who threw his gaunt glare at them. "A
miserable, yellow pack of hounds! Not worth the powder to blow
'em to hell! I'd give half my fortune to be thirty years younger.
By God, I'd take Hugh Tracy's trail alone&mdash;and I'd knock him
down!"</p>

<p>"You been pushin' the boys pretty hard, with blamed little
consideration," observed Maunders.</p>

<p>"Bah," snorted Shadrow. "They're sick sheep!"</p>

<p>"Sure. You'd like to have us walk right into Tracy and get the
lead," grumbled Maunders. "Well, some of the lads did exactly
that. And they'll ride no more. When a man's workin' for thirty
dollars a month, it don't seem so swell to butt into a gun."</p>

<p>Shadrow lashed out at him: "Shut up! You're the worst bungler
in the lot! I ain't got a man I can put trust in! Ain't a one of
them with his heart in my affairs! It's a hell of a situation to
consider every blasted one of you'd cut my throat!" Wheeling, he
stamped into the office. Maunders looked slyly at Tolbert, and
together they slowly followed through the doorway. Shadrow was in
the act of pouring himself a drink, "It ain't natural, it ain't
reasonable," he burst out. "I'm the strongest man in this
country. I can whip any other outfit. I can do exactly as I
damned well please. I've got the biggest crew and the most money.
And still, by thunder, I can't nail Hugh Tracy in his tracks!
What's the matter with us?"</p>

<p>Maunders took up a slow pacing the the room, his dull
blackened face stolidly set. The slate eyes flashed over to
Shadrow, who downed his drink and looked ominously at his
lieutenants. "I can give, you two pretty good reasons," muttered
Maunders.</p>

<p>"Can, hey?" snapped Shadrow, heavy with sarcasm. "Well, let's
have the due fruit of your massive intellect. Go on, tell
me."</p>

<p>"For one thing," said Maunders stubbornly, "Tracy's got your
ticket."</p>

<p>"What in the name of creation does that mean?" yelled Shadrow.
Outraged beyond measure, he swept all the accumulated papers off
his desk with one hand.</p>

<p>"It's in the book," insisted Maunders. "He's got your ticket.
You never will get him because you wasn't borned to get him.
That's what I mean. The deck don't cut that way. The bullet ain't
in your gun that's goin' to hit him. Maybe you think you're the
biggest bull buffalo on the prairie. You ain't. Tracy is."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Shadrow, with the same taunting, malign temper.
"What else?"</p>

<p>Maunders's own throttled anger began to rise into his talk.
"Confound you, Shadrow. You talk of the crew bein' yellow and of
wantin' to cut your throat! Well, half of that's true enough.
You've got no loyalty comin' to you anyhow. Why should you have?
You treat all of us like dung under your feet. You suppose a man
is going to take a bust in the nose from you and then go out and
lay himself open to a killin' because you want him to? Sure, you
got money. What of it? There ain't a ranch in the West that feeds
as lousy, drives as hard, pays as little, or is as downright
gloomy to work for as this one."</p>

<p>"You lost your nerve a week ago," gibed Shadrow. "You're
through."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me when I'm through!" shouted Maunders. "You
better sing humble! You've lost a lot of men at Tracy's hands,
and you'll lose more. Don't make any mistake about that. There
ain't so many of us standin' between Tracy and you. I'm one of
the few&mdash;and you've got little license to tell me where I
head in!"</p>

<p>"We run him out of the country," growled Shadrow, filling up
his glass again. "He'll never dare to show around Powder
again."</p>

<p>Lake Tolbert stood as always, in a corner, lank frame slouched
against the wall. He broke his inscrutable silence for the first
time:</p>

<p>"You're wrong, Tade. He'll be back."</p>

<p>Shadrow jerked his head about as if stung. "Another county
heard from! You're supposed to be the best tracker in the state.
Well, I'll say you're overrated. You lost Tracy's trail half a
dozen times." Bending forward, the slack and caviling face fixed
on the foreman, he said slowly: "What's the matter, Lake? You
losin' your nerve too?"</p>

<p>"What would you think?" droned Tolbert.</p>

<p>The air of the room was packed with hostility, the threat of
eruption. Maunders backed away and glanced over at Tolbert with a
concentrating interest. Ready enough to talk, he held his tongue
now. This was something new&mdash;this recrimination and
accusation and bickering between the owner and the foreman.
Shadrow's lewdly evil eyes sharpened&mdash;dangerous
sign&mdash;and his lips turned bloodlessly thin. Tolbert's
returning stare was fixed in an unchanged, unmoved blankness. All
this held on for a matter of moments, and was broken by Shadrow,
who reached down to his filled glass and drank the liquor at a
gulp.</p>

<p>"He never will dare to put his foot inside of Powder again,"
repeated Shadrow.</p>

<p>"He'll be knocking at your door soon enough," replied
Tolbert.</p>

<p>"My sentiments exactly," added Maunders.</p>

<p>"Why?" cried the badgered Shadrow. "How can he? What with?
How? Answer me that!"</p>

<p>Maunders almost smiled. With an evident sarcasm he prompted
Tolbert: "You tell him, Lake."</p>

<p>"Because he's a fighter," said Tolbert slowly. "Because, when
he gets his mind made up, he's like a bull on the charge. Never
considerin' whether he'll stand or fall." And after a moment's
thought he added: "Pretty hard to stop a man that won't be
stopped."</p>

<p>"He'll never get far," said Shadrow. "He's alone."</p>

<p>"He'll have help," said Tolbert with the same calm.</p>

<p>Shadrow's aggravation increased; he cursed passionately. "Not
enough help to amount to a tinker's dam! Look here, Lake, I've
got this country under my little finger. Nobody dares to buck
me."</p>

<p>But Tolbert shook his head slowly. "And that's why he'll have
help. You've run your power high, wide, and handsome and never
given anybody a break. A lot of people hate you, Tade. All that
keeps 'em from workin' on you is fear. When they see a man like
Tracy come fighting back, they'll join him. And he'll be knocking
at your door. Make up your mind to it."</p>

<p>"A fight, uh?" growled Shadrow. "All right. I'll see Mister
Tracy accommodated. I'll lick him so bad and I'll lick this
country so bad no man will ever dare look me in the face again.
Fine! It's what I want!"</p>

<p>The other two said nothing. Shadrow sat down, eyes like rubies
against the sagging, dead-colored skin. Suddenly he raised his
voice: "Lynn!" And after a moment he shouted her name again:
"Lynn&mdash;come in here!"</p>

<p>"And that's another reason Hugh Tracy will be back," said
Tolbert, the words tightening curiously.</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Shadrow.</p>

<p>"You fool," said Tolbert, almost roughly, "those two
people&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Oh," said Shadrow and fell silent, devouring the new thought.
"So that's it? That's why she came back and made such a play to
have me draw off. I didn't quite see it then. Fond of him, uh?"
Slowly the cast of the man's face changed to a sly and malicious
humor. A chuckle spilled out of his spindling chest; the lips
pursed themselves on a grim, smirking smile. "Well, I know the
answer to that."</p>

<p>The door opened from the living room, and Lynn Isherwood came
reluctantly in. Shadrow said: "Get out of here, boys. I'm talkin'
to this fine lady that eats TS chuck and still tries to do it
hurt. Go on&mdash;get out of here!"</p>

<p>Maunders went out with a rolling swagger of his burly
shoulders; but Tolbert clung to his place, more and more reserved
of expression, until Shadrow's brittle words bit him again:
"What's the matter, Lake? Understand American, don't you?"</p>

<p>At that Tolbert crossed the place quite slowly and went
through the door. Just beyond, he turned to look at the girl
standing straight and calm in her place. Maunders grumbled, "Come
on, Lake." Over by the bunkhouse all the crew stood in a thick
circle. Talk rose in heated gusts; the two men walked that way,
both preoccupied.</p>

<p>Shadrow sat, hunched over his desk, heavy satisfaction still
playing over the thin countenance; he stared at Lynn a long
moment, one hand tapping restlessly on the desk top. When he
finally broke the silence, it was with a snapping abruptness:
"What made you break away from Tracy and come back to me?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the girl. "It didn't help me to come
back."</p>

<p>"You bet it didn't. I was wonderin' if Tracy sent you back to
ease the blow."</p>

<p>"You know better."</p>

<p>"So you wanted to help him pretty bad? Fond of the man, hey?
Lost your fool head on him."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lynn. "Yes."</p>

<p>"It will do no good," said Shadrow. "He's gone from here, and
he won't be comin' back."</p>

<p>She made no answer to that. Prying at her face with his
jealous, brilliant eyes, Shadrow beat another question against
her: "Was that getaway arranged between you two beforehand? You
planned to skip this ranch with him deliberate?"</p>

<p>Lynn's attention seemed to sharpen on the man. A knitted frown
appeared above her eyes. "Whatever way it happened&mdash;it makes
no difference to you."</p>

<p>"Look here, girl, there's something damned funny about it
all," scolded Shadrow. "I never knew you was acquainted with
Tracy. Was you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then," cried Shadrow, "you been stealin' off to his place
unbeknowst to me! That's where you been ridin' lately, hey?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Nice&mdash;very nice!" muttered Shadrow, and the ever-
changing expression revealed something that turned Lynn's face to
sudden scarlet.</p>

<p>"You," she said rapidly, "are rotten all the way through. I've
seen a lot of scoundrels in my life, Tade, but none as mean, as
contemptible as you."</p>

<p>"I see what I see," answered Shadrow, sardonically amused.
"You're a woman and no different from any other woman. Nor you
ain't the first girl that's thrown herself at Tracy. But it will
do you no good. He ain't comin' back."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be too sure of that," retorted Lynn.</p>

<p>The man bent forward, fully alert again. "What makes you so
sure about it?"</p>

<p>"I know Hugh."</p>

<p>"Do, hey? Well, if he comes he'll get knocked over or taken.
I'm seeing to that. If he's taken he'll get life for murder or
kidnappin'."</p>

<p>"You couldn't make the charges stick!" flamed the girl.</p>

<p>"This is my country, you little fool," Shadrow answered
contemptuously. "Antelope is my town. It is my court, my sheriff,
my judge and my jury."</p>

<p>Lynn turned silent. Shadrow moved restlessly around in his
chair, squinting upward at her with the same sly, worldly wisdom.
"Still something funny about this. You made a powerful lot of
noise getting out of here with Tracy the other night. You
screamed. What for?"</p>

<p>The girl's air of puzzlement came back to her. She drew a
breath, started to speak, and checked the impulse. Then, again
changing her mind, she said: "Didn't you know?&mdash;Bat
Testervis was hiding out there beyond the yard. Hugh and I didn't
know it. Bat caught me and got away. Hugh didn't catch up till
the next morning."</p>

<p>Shadrow's eyes narrowed. "Then what happened?"</p>

<p>"Hugh fought him and drove him away."</p>

<p>"Early yesterday morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And there was a shot?"</p>

<p>"No," said the girl.</p>

<p>Shadrow fell to drumming the desk with his fingers, scowling.
"Where?"</p>

<p>"By the cabin&mdash;just beyond the tall peak."</p>

<p>"Still funny," grunted Shadrow. "There was a shot somewhere
around that country about then. Well"&mdash;and he squared
himself toward her&mdash;"it makes no difference. You might as
well put Tracy out of your head. He's through with the Powder
whether he knows it or not. Now you listen to me. You've ate my
bread and turned around to bite me. If you was a man I'd hide you
proper. I would. But you're a woman&mdash;not to be trusted
farther'n my little finger reaches. Never was a woman you could
trust. I've had 'em trick me before."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," said Lynn.</p>

<p>"How's that?" challenged Shadrow.</p>

<p>159</p>

<p>"Trickery brings trickery. It's all you know. You haven't got
a friend in this world."</p>

<p>"A plain-spoken packet," said Shadrow, maliciously approving.
"Full of fire and lyin' smiles. Never mind. You can't play double
with me any more. Want to go away?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl, so eagerly that Shadrow sat back in his
chair and laughed.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you ain't gettin' the chance."</p>

<p>"Tade, there's a limit to this thing!"</p>

<p>"You bet," said the man. "Weve just about come to it. Lynn,
you're my ward and I've got to take care of you. It's settled.
You'll marry me."</p>

<p>The girl straightened, and a long, wild flash of anger poured
out of her eyes. "You're not frightening me, Tade!"</p>

<p>"Of course, not," said Shadrow, oddly quiet. "But the
statement goes."</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;" breathed Lynn, and struggled for some
adequate word. A deep, furious contempt swept over the expressive
face. "So the cattle baron thinks to command a marriage, does he?
The great Tade Shadrow! Listen. You are sixty years old, and
there isn't a kind act in all those years to your credit. You're
a coward and a bully; it cheat and a liar and a ruffian. There's
not a soul in all this land that doesn't hate and despise you.
All that you are worth you have stolen from weaker people.
Perhaps you think yourself an iron character. Well, don't be
deceived. You're cold enough to order a man killed&mdash;as you
have ordered Hugh Tracy killed. But you hired it done, Tade. If
you had to stand up and do your own fighting you'd squeal like a
rat! I'd sooner marry a&mdash;a savage with filed teeth in the
South Seas."</p>

<p>Shadrow took this verbal lashing in silence. His sagging
features paled as the girl went on, and the burning brilliance of
his eyes strengthened to raw flame. When she was through, he
tried to beat down her glance with that infuriated
stare&mdash;and failed. Suddenly he wrenched himself upright, one
hand striking the table. He was breathing heavily, and the
violent speech tumbled out of him.</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;I'll show you who's master of this place!
I'll break your back, girl! It was in my mind to make a kindly
husband. It ain't so many years before I'll be dead. You'd had
the property&mdash;to marry a younger and more pleasin' man if
you chose! All right! I'll show you just how it feels to be hurt!
You'll marry me and you'll never leave this ranch!"</p>

<p>"Force?" cried Lynn.</p>

<p>Shadrow's aged countenance filled with that malice always so
near the surface. "There is no livin' man to contradict what I
do, or to interfere. I am sendin' to town this afternoon for
Judge Beakes and a license. He'll be here by supper time. You've
got till then to think it over. If you can't see light, make up
your mind to accept anything that might happen. That should be
clear enough for you."</p>

<p>She stared incredulously at him, whispering: "I
believe&mdash;I actually believe you'd do it."</p>

<p>"I can't force you to marry me in front of witnesses. But
you'll be livin' here quite a while&mdash;"</p>

<p>She watched the petulant, womanish lips of this man press a
grin into shapelessness. Then, turning away with a quick, pushing
gesture, she walked out to the porch as if the air behind were
too stifling to endure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maunders and Tolbert walked toward the grouped crew.
The circle opened to let them in. A man in the center&mdash;one
of the ranch guards&mdash;suddenly stopped talking and fell to
scuffling up the dirt with a boot toe, but another said: "Tell
Lake about this, Doby."</p>

<p>Doby looked at Tolbert. "I ain't got around to tellin' the
boss yet. You better do it for me, Tolbert. There ain't any boys
left down on Tracy's spur with the beef."</p>

<p>"What happened?" broke in Maunders.</p>

<p>Doby kept his eyes on Tolbert. "Well, Luke Gann came up from
there night before last, right after all you fellows had gone
after Tracy and the girl. Luke said the boys had just got squared
around at Tracy's place when a couple of guns begin bangin' away
from the top of the rim. It just raised hell. Nobody was hit, but
the beef stampeded all over the desert. They tried to round up
these jaspers, who just faded. Well, Luke said it was yes or no
when the ball would start again from some other angle of the rim,
and it was kind of discouragin'. Everybody decided it was too
tough to be pot-shotted. So the bunch pulled stakes and hit for
grass clean to the other side of nowhere. Luke said he was
through, too. Nobody lookin' after the beef now."</p>

<p>Maunders turned on Tolbert. "There," he muttered, "is the
beginnin' of the crack-up. I knew it would come. We've tried too
hard to get Tracy&mdash;and we ain't got him. He's played it
right&mdash; nibbled away at us."</p>

<p>"I don't mind sayin'," broke in Doby, "that I was in a hell of
a sweat while you fellows was gone. Just three of us left behind
to hold these quarters. We could've been burnt out easy
enough."</p>

<p>"You can shake hands with yourself that you wasn't," grumbled
Maunders.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" said Doby. "Well, I'm beginnin' to entertain a few
doubts about this job. You fellows ever stop to think how many
boys are smashed up on account of this ruetion? And I'll tell you
something else: TS is mighty unpopular. There's goin' to be a lot
of lads belly-flat in the brush waitin' to drop a shot on any
Shadrow hand so foolish as to be ridin' solitary: It's kinda
tough."</p>

<p>"For thirty dollars a month," said Maunders, ironically, "you
ought to be willin' to die."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" grunted Doby, "Yeah?"</p>

<p>That was the last talk for quite an interval. These
men&mdash;there were better than forty in the circle&mdash;were
studying their own fortunes with a scowling attention. Lake
Tolbert looked coolly around, watching the dark faces crease up
and show all the ranges of doubt and dissatisfaction. He knew
them thoroughly. There was no loyalty in them, and little enough
of goodness. A Shadrow hand was a picked hand. It took hard,
unscrupulous men to stand the gaff. And now that their own skins
were endangered, now that they felt the Shadrow power to be no
longer unbreakable, they looked closely at their hole cards. Most
of them, he realized, would bunch the job if it came to hard,
even-matched fighting. What had so far held them was the
tremendous power of Shadrow's reputation.</p>

<p>All this time his attention was half placed on the main house;
and now he saw Lynn Isherwood come out of the door with a
rapidity that meant trouble yonder. He saw her face to be pale,
moved by agitation.</p>

<p>"What I want to know," said another hand, "is if Tracy figures
he can come&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shadrow's yell sailed toward the group. "Tolbert&mdash;send me
a man!"</p>

<p>The owner stood on the porch, clinging to one of the posts.
Tolbert silently indicated a hand near by, who walked reluctantly
over the plaza. The interrupted speaker went on: "&mdash;if Tracy
figures he can come back?"</p>

<p>"You ain't seen the last of him," prophesied Maunders. "Damned
right he'll be back. Look here. He had help up in that timber. A
bunch of 'em, waiting for us to charge. And when he does come
back he'll have more."</p>

<p>"He'll come here?"</p>

<p>Maunders slowly nodded, looking again at Tolbert. All the eyes
of the group veered on this foreman who so far had said nothing.
Tall and taciturn, a master of men, he swayed them through fear
mostly, through respect to a lesser degree. It was his iron rule
that had governed TS, the half-military discipline was of his
making. And though there was no affection possible for such a
man, these rough and unruly TS riders instinctively turned to him
for judgment. It was long in coming. Locked still in his rigid
calm, he watched the despatched hand come ambling back from
Shadrow. The fellow said slowly to the group: "I been sent to
Antelope for Judge Beakes. He's to bring out a marriage license."
Turning, he went for his horse.</p>

<p>"He must be gettin' childish," growled Maunders.</p>

<p>"Him and the girl?" grunted Doby and stared all around him.
"Hell, she ain't doin' that by her own will."</p>

<p>"Never mind how it's done," warned somebody else. "It is none
of your business, Doby."</p>

<p>"No skin off'n my nose," agreed Doby. "But it looks raw. Even
to me it looks raw."</p>

<p>"Well," broke in another hand cynically, "she's old enough to
know her book."</p>

<p>But Doby had another idea. "It's pretty rank, boys. And here's
what will happen: it'll make a lot more people in the country
want to wipe out Shadrow. If it is bad with us now, it'll be
worse."</p>

<p>Tolbert pulled up his head. Instantly he got the full
attention of the outfit. Into the waiting silence he dropped his
sparing words one by one. It was a trick, a deliberate building
up of suspense; and it heightened everything he said.</p>

<p>"Tracy will come back. He'll have help. You boys better think
twice whether you want to get in another fight which will make
any other fight look like a picnic."</p>

<p>"You're pullin' out?" demanded Doby.</p>

<p>"No," said Tolbert. "I'm stayin' for a spell longer. But don't
let that influence you none. Think twice before you sleep here
tonight."</p>

<p>That much curtly, flatly stated, he swung on his heels and
walked away. Lynn Isherwood stood over at the throat of the
plaza, staring down the Antelope road. The concealing shadows
across his eyes again, he went toward her. She came slowly around
and looked at him and the man, never ceasing to pry into the
faces and acts of others, saw somewhere in that glance a
suppressed fear. Removing his hat, he halted before her.</p>

<p>"Shadrow asked to marry you, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl.</p>

<p>"You agreed?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"And so," went on Tolbert in that quietly relentless probing
manner, "he said something about makin' you marry him?"</p>

<p>"Tolbert," parried the girl, "you are paid by Tade Shadrow.
You work for him. You are no friend of mine. Why should I tell
you?"</p>

<p>Tolbert's long, supple fingers slowly creased the edges of his
hat. "I can readily see you trust me none."</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>He nodded slightly. "You're right. A man such as me knows
nothing about women and never has a chance to learn&mdash;not
about your kind of a woman. But it has been my observation that
you judge on sort of first guess and seldom make a serious
error."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Lynn, on the defensive.</p>

<p>"You made your judgment of me the first day you came to TS.
You never changed that judgment. I am not askin' you to change
it, for it was correct. I make no bones about it. Nor have I ever
held a deceivin' opinion of my past or present life."</p>

<p>"Well?" repeated Lynn, uncertain and alarmed. There was always
some purpose in this inexplicable man's mind and heart, There was
one now, and she waited for it to come out with a species of
dread.</p>

<p>"Yet," he went on, "I did you one favor you know about."</p>

<p>"Lied to Tade for me? Yes. I never understood it. Why did
you?"</p>

<p>"I did you another favor which you don't know about. I led our
crew off your trail and Tracy's trail as long as I could, hopin'
for your escape."</p>

<p>"Why?" insisted the girl.</p>

<p>A rider loped into the plaza and dismounted at the porch,
going directly to Shadrow's office. Heavy dust clouds folded and
raveled through the motionless, burning air. Tolbert's eyes
followed the rider as far as the office door, watchful&mdash;and
reflective. Afterwards he turned back to Lynn.</p>

<p>"I seldom explain," he said. "A man's acts should speak for
him&mdash;and always do. My life has been a hard life, ma'am, and
worth nobody's sympathy. I was early taught to give no favors and
to ask none. I never have."</p>

<p>"Which is brutal," interrupted Lynn.</p>

<p>He inclined his head slowly. "Perhaps. Still, there is no
mercy in the kind of men you see in this plaza. They are old
enough to know what they're doing. With them it's dog eat dog.
It's been so with me. The strong dog lives and the weak one dies.
I am alive. That's the sum of the proposition. You can't go
behind it. In order to live I've been as fast as the fastest,
hard as the hardest, I expected I always would be that way. The
favor I did you was about the first I ever did for anybody."</p>

<p>"But why?" repeated the girl.</p>

<p>Shadrow was yelling from his office: "Maunders&mdash;Maunders,
come here!" And once again Tolbert's glance pinned itself to the
doorway and remained there until Maunders went rolling in.
Looking again at the girl, he seemed to find the right words with
difficulty: "The worst man in the world has got some deadline.
Otherwise, he'd have no pride. And a man without pride is a dog.
Never mind what I've done. Some things I never did. I don't ask
you to believe me, and there's no reason why you should. But,
ma'am, I never ruined a woman. Nor will I let any other man. I
shall be on this ranch till Tracy comes back."</p>

<p>"You think&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shadrow was calling again, more angrily: "Tolbert, I want
you!"</p>

<p>The foreman bowed stiffly at Lynn. "Tracy will show up," he
muttered and climbed to the porch. Cruising along it with an
exaggerated deliberateness, he halted at the doorway and swayed
slightly forward. Shadrow stood visible against a wall; Maunders
was somewhere beyond sight. Ducking his head beneath the
doorway's top member, Tolbert entered, instantly seeking out
Maunders, who had stationed himself in a far corner. Tolbert
paused, watchfully placed between these two.</p>

<p>"Lake," grunted Shadrow, full of suppressed fury, "you've
played me double!"</p>

<p>Tolbert's attention was on Maunders now, and he said with a
quiet sibilance: "Come a little forward, Sid. I don't want you
over there."</p>

<p>Maunders's black face was at once aroused and attentive.
Saying nothing, he walked on until he no longer covered the
foreman's left flank.</p>

<p>"A mighty careful man!" observed Shadrow. "A mighty careful
man, Mister Tolbert!"</p>

<p>Tolbert's inscrutable eyes clung to Shadrow. "What is it to
be, Tade?"</p>

<p>"A rider," said Tade, between his teeth, "just found Bat
Testervis dead up along the trail."</p>

<p>"You ought to be glad of it."</p>

<p>"Should, hey? Looky here, Lake. You came back to meet me
yesterday mornin' from that trail. You said there wasn't anything
over that way. You lied. Bat was over that way. The shot I heard
was your shot. You dropped him and said nothing of it to me."</p>

<p>Tolbert held his tongue, glance reverting to Maunders.</p>

<p>Increasing strain showed on the burly gunman's broad and blunt
visage; in the smoky slate eyes centered on Tolbert was a
broadening light.</p>

<p>"Deny it?" snapped Shadrow, impatient of the lagging
silence.</p>

<p>"No," said Tolbert.</p>

<p>"Open up&mdash;open up!" yelled Shadrow. "You've got something
to explain here and now!"</p>

<p>"Nothing," denied Tolbert. "I never explain. Make out your own
ticket."</p>

<p>It plainly astonished Shadrow. Starting forward from the wall,
he reached his desk and supported himself on it with the flats of
his hands, half crouched in the position, and his overgrown head
tipped oddly on the skinny neck. "I have had," said he, more
composedly, "about enough of your ingrown, pussyfoot ways. No man
grinds his own coffee in my mill, Lake. No man, ever. You may
think you're big enough to buck me, but you ain't. Before your
time foremen have made that fatal mistake. Now you open up!"</p>

<p>Tolbert never moved, never relaxed the pressure of his thin
lips. It was Maunders who broke in speaking to Tolbert as if
Shadrow didn't exist. "I get this now," said the heavy-set
gunman. "I make you now, Lake. It's that girl you're lookin'
after. By God, that's the game you been playin' all the time. And
you tried to tell me you wasn't playin' any game."</p>

<p>Shadrow rapped out: "What's between you two mugs?"</p>

<p>Maunders went on, brushing aside the owner's question.</p>

<p>Clearly he was holding a tight bridle on himself. "And that
sort of clears up your kindly advice to me when I went for Tracy
that night at his cabin. I was to bust right in and not delay,
was I? You knew right then the girl was on her way to tell Tracy
he'd be visited. And you wanted me to get my vest punctured. Good
boy, Lake! You figure fast."</p>

<p>"You men," said Shadrow, "better go outside and settle if
there's blood between you."</p>

<p>Maunders threw himself about as if he meant to charge Shadrow.
"That's what you want, ain't it? Damn you, Shadrow, you've put
your dirty chores on me long enough! I'll do no more. Right now
Hugh Tracy's prowlin' for me, and there ain't room enough in all
the Powder for the both of us to live! Who started that? You did,
you fox-faced, shysterin', belly-crawlin' Digger! Well, from this
point on you'll be shy one rider. I'm gone. I've got a chore to
do. If I do it, I'll stay in this country&mdash;and you can be
damned well sure I'll take my commission out of you!"</p>

<p>He swung for the door, smoldering. On the threshold he pulled
himself around and stared at Tolbert. "It's all right, Lake. You
and me been playin' this scoundrel's game too long, and I ain't
holdin' the trick against you. You better clear out before he
ribs you another way."</p>

<p>Tolbert listened to the big man's boots scuff across the porch
and strike the packed dirt of the plaza. But even as he listened,
he watched Shadrow's wolf-shrewd face betray the presence of
another thought. He had read this man's changing moods for years,
and now, detecting that: feral expression, he recognized in it a
meaning for him. Not so many days ago it had been on Shadrow's
face when the owner had issued Willy Bones's death warrant.</p>

<p>Shadrow said abruptly: "Quit starin' at me, Lake. And you're
through. Roll up your war bag and light out."</p>

<p>"No," said Tolbert. "I'm stayin'."</p>

<p>"Lake," said Shadrow, and suddenly sat down in his
chair&mdash; "Lake, get out of my office."</p>

<p>The foreman's cheeks had been unchangingly set for too many
years to break out of the habitual mask now. But there was in his
eyes that faint light of contempt as he stared at the older man.
"Don't telegraph your desire so plain, Tade, You want to kill me,
sure. I always knew that would be the way of it when we split up.
I know too much about your business to get away free. But your
house is crumblin'. Roof and wall, it's crumblin'. And I'll stick
awhile to see it fall!"</p>

<p>He went through the door with a sudden alert twist of his body
and stepped aside. He heard Shadrow rise and run across the
floor, he heard the office door slam shut behind. Dropping to the
yard, he went deliberately along the line of buildings that
closed the western edge of the plaza. Ahead of him the crew still
formed a circle by the bunkhouse. And toward the crew he walked,
taking his roundabout way that placed the tool shed and the
blacksmith shop on his immediate flank.</p>

<p>Sid Maunders came out of a bunkhouse and went through the
gathered hands, saying something. He came past the men and struck
over toward the small barn, two hundred feet opposite Tolbert.
Reaching it, he went inside. Tolbert kept his stride, arrived at
the open arch of the blacksmith shop&mdash;and whirled into it
with a rapid, gliding twist of his body. Somebody in the crowd
shouted, "Watch out!" The sultry air of the compound was smashed
asunder by the full-throated roar of a gun. Daylight appeared in
a board beside Tolbert, who stood unmoved, arms idle. Maunders
cried out from the small barn:</p>

<p>"Come on, Lake! I'm here waitin' for you!"</p>

<p>"I'm not drawin'," called Tolbert, emotionlessly.</p>

<p>"Come on!" raged Maunders.</p>

<p>"Not today, Sid. There's bigger fish in the ocean than
suckers."</p>

<p>"Tolbert!" shouted the hidden gunman, "Tolbert, I'll step out
of here shootin' if you will!"</p>

<p>"You dumb ox," said Tolbert, "get on a horse and go before
you're hurt."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and the oppressive heat seemed to
increase throughout the dreary yard. The TS riders stood
motionless by the bunkhouses, swarthy faces glistening under the
slanting rays of the sun; and in one cool, detached survey Lake
Tolbert saw the bold avidness for a killing as plain as the
written word on them. Nowhere was a sign of pity, of generosity.
Yet this lack had on him no effect, for these were qualities he
little understood and never had expected. Maunders shouted again,
meaninglessly; and directly thereafter the big gunman spurred out
of the end of the small barn and raced down the Antelope
road.</p>

<p>It was like the break of a long-held vacuum. Air and sound
rushed in. Stepping out of the bunkhouse, Tolbert saw the crew
swirl into groups and these groups collect into definite parties.
There were two such parties, one drifting for the bunkhouses
while the other held fast. Tolbert knew then what it was to be.
The first party presently came out with war bags packed to go,
and in compact formation marched over to the tethered horses. All
these men swung to the saddle and wheeled in front of Shadrow's
office.</p>

<p>"Shadrow."</p>

<p>Shadrow never appeared. A coyote howl rose up from the seated
men. Somebody fired once to the sky, and then in unison the
dissenters wheeled and charged down the road. A long cloud of
dust obscured them. Tolbert slowly reached for his cigarette
papers and turned to face the remaining group.
There&mdash;twenty-some hands out of all that young army once
Shadrow's&mdash;were left to fight; and these were the oldest in
point of service on the ranch, dating beyond his own tenure.
Watching that sullen, silent cluster, Tolbert understood that
from this moment on he had no authority over them. These men
stayed because of the ranch itself, because of the threatened
fight in the offing, or because of some obscure loyalty or pride
they themselves knew little about. But they would answer to
Shadrow; not to him. More exactly&mdash;and Tolbert's narrow
inspection hardened as he decided it&mdash;he was no longer one
of them. They regarded him with a covert hostility. The old
discipline had fallen, he himself was now an alien on this ranch
he had ruled for so long; he was amongst enemies&mdash;quite
alone. Standing there in this strange new isolation, it came to
him that he should have killed Maunders, who would never quit the
Powder without finding and settling with Hugh Tracy. And it came
to him also that for the first time in his hard, unforgiving
career he was violating the first article of his faith&mdash;he
was forgetting his own safety in the effort to protect another
human being. Over the trailing cigarette smoke he observed
audibly: "I must be gettin' along in years. I must be gettin'
old."</p>

<p>When the cook's triangle clanged out the belated dinner
signal, he walked to the dining room and took his accustomed
place with an iron impassivity that locked the rest of the world
away from his aloof and lonely thoughts.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER 14. &mdash; JERKED DOWN</h2>

<p class="first">"IT'S RISKY," reflected Bill Vivian.</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Hugh and drank the coffee pot dry. An overhead
sun bombed the glade with one blazing shaft and another,
destroying the last bit of forest cool; all the surrounding
greenery had lost its dew-coated brilliance and was now a dully
dusted jade. Cross-legged on the earth, the heaviness of sleep
not yet worn off, Hugh watched the gravely attentive faces around
him. It was exactly half-past one by his watch. "What in thunder
did you let me snooze so long for?" he grumbled.</p>

<p>"You needed it," stated Bill</p>

<p>"The morning's lost."</p>

<p>"What of it? Trouble won't spoil for a little keepin'. Well,
it's risky. They's just the twelve of us."</p>

<p>"I'll go ahead, alone."</p>

<p>Bill Vivian gave his partner a severe glance. "The hell you
will. We stick together."</p>

<p>"I'm putting it up to you boys," said Hugh. "I am through
running. I'm turning the other direction. But it doesn't obligate
a single one of you to come along."</p>

<p>Bill swelled visibly and turned toward the others with an
ironic regard. "Listen to him. Why, you cockeyed horse thief,
what did I get these mugs for?"</p>

<p>Hugh grinned. "Well, then, quit stalling."</p>

<p>"I only said we could lay over another day and drag these
hills. I can find half a dozen more lads itchin' to be in the
future developments."</p>

<p>"Day's too much," contradicted Hugh. "Bill, I'm about finished
with caution. It always leads me astray. The time to do a thing
is when you feel it can be done."</p>

<p>"Yeah," drawled Bill, "I've, heard that song before. Enough
times to say it in my sleep. Keep hittin' until somethin' drops.
Press your luck while it lasts. Never mind the consequences. I
know. Same tune sung by the same big bass voice of Hugh Tracy,
Esquire. Go on, tell me something new."</p>

<p>"If we wait," added Hugh imperturbably, "we give Shadrow that
much time to get organized. Meanwhile, we're on the outside
looking in. We're too far away. No, it won't do."</p>

<p>"What's to be gained by going to Antelope?"</p>

<p>Tracy leaned forward, stabbing his finger at Bill. "Twelve men
can hold Antelope against a regiment of cavalry, my boy. It's
Shadrow's town. He needs it. He gets his supplies from there and
he transacts his business from there. We'll ease in, seal
Antelope up, and wait. Sooner or later he'll get aggravated
enough to make a move against us. After that&mdash;" and Hugh
spread his palms upward.</p>

<p>"A thought," said Bill reluctantly. "Only, if he ever put a
ring of guns around Antelope and settled down to one of these
all-summer affairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're inside, he's out," suggested Hugh. "You can't starve a
man who's using a grocery store as a fort."</p>

<p>Suddenly Bill slapped his knee, and the homely visage cracked
wide open with a grin. "Somehow it sort of looks like a dirty
joke on Shadrow. Good! I'm for it."</p>

<p>"Willy," said one of the others, "is coming across the
flat."</p>

<p>"But supposin' he lets us strictly alone," pondered Bill.
"Then we're in a town and what of it?"</p>

<p>"He won't," said Hugh quickly. "I won't let him."</p>

<p>"I thought so. You've got another idea in your noggin. Don't
hold out on me, mister."</p>

<p>"The rest is my personal affair."</p>

<p>"More ridin' off alone, huh? You might as well make up your
mind I'll be along."</p>

<p>Willy Bones spurred into the glade, a crust of sweat on his
horse. But he dismounted casually and reached for his cigarettes
before speaking.</p>

<p>"I'm right on top of the rim above Antelope. Shadrow ain't
over there"&mdash;waving his hand toward the canyon
country&mdash;"any more. I find him on the road home. This is
three hours ago."</p>

<p>"What's it look like in Antelope?"</p>

<p>"Which is why I come back," said Willy and paused to crimp and
light his smoke. Bill Vivian said impatiently:</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know you're one of these big, strong-handed fellows
with a close mouth. You've made it clear. Now go on."</p>

<p>"Pretty close to twenty-twenty-five hands ride down the rim
road from TS and pile into Antelope."</p>

<p>"Shadrow's hands?"</p>

<p>"I don't make out. But who else would they be?"</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed Hugh. "Foolish question, Bill."</p>

<p>"This cub," grumbled Bill, "has been eatin' too much raw
meat."</p>

<p>Willy flushed and grew embarrassed beneath the concerted
scrutiny of all those older eyes. "Well," he said uncertainly, "I
ain't tryin' to throw my weight about. I only mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stick to your guns, Willy," drawled Hugh. "You're head high
to anybody in this company, not exceptin' a shriveled little
weasel named Vivian. Go on. They went into Antelope."</p>

<p>"Yeah. And out again. They don't stop for more'n a drink. I
see 'em go right straight across Powder, towards the long hill up
Dead Axle grade."</p>

<p>"Then," cried Bill Vivian, "they're through with Shadrow!
They're jumpin' the herd! I told you TS was bustin' up."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," interposed one of the other men. "It may be
Shadrow's sent 'em out to circle these parts. Don't be too
previous."</p>

<p>But Hugh, rising to his feet, slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, Bill's got the answer. That bunch is leaving Powder.
Times are gettin' a little tough, and the thirty dollars and
board won't hold a fellow who's wondering about his own skin.
We've shook some of the strength out of TS."</p>

<p>"Lessee," murmured Vivian. "You said twenty-five, Willy? I'd
judge Shadrow had that many or more left. He's already lost or
fired most of the outlyin' crews. But make no mistake about
it&mdash; those remainin' on the premises represent the boilin'
of a tough mess."</p>

<p>A long halloo struck out of the trees, and presently Sabe
Venner, rolling his big body low in the saddle to avoid being
brushed by the branches, came into the clearing. "I tell
you&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>Bill Vivian interrupted him smoothly: "The TS boys passed you.
Up Dead Axle grade."</p>

<p>Sabe Venner stared. "Who's tellin' this story, you or me?"</p>

<p>"Which way did they go?"</p>

<p>"Straight on with the road. Looked to me 'sif it was a case of
long dust and no stops. I made a high peak and got a last sight
of them just a little while back. They was clear over on the
Burnt Creek ridge."</p>

<p>A silence came to the group. Hugh Tracy stared out upon the
flats with a shadowed thoughtfulness, and his eyes ran all along
the far edge of timber. Bill Vivian, never able to be entirely
still, rocked on his heels and watched Tracy until the monotony
of it oppressed his nerves. "Well," he said finally, "grass won't
grow if you stand on it."</p>

<p>"We'll go across the flat and hit a course for Antelope."</p>

<p>"Might be somebody planted yonder waitin' for a good
shot."</p>

<p>But Tracy walked back to his horse and mounted. "No, don't
think so now. This part of the game is all played out. If
Shadrow's having trouble with his men he won't scatter them.
He'll draw everything back to the ranch."</p>

<p>"We're talked dry," said Vivian. "Let's do something for a
change."</p>

<p>Tracy led the group out of the glade and down the slope to the
trail. Turning into the desert, he struck straight across. Bill
Vivian forged abreast; the others, taking a cue from the recent
skirmish, deployed and presented a broad front. "Better avoid
that canyon," advised Bill, and his pale green eyes went skipping
along the line of timber ahead. Willy Bones drew his gun and held
it in his lap.</p>

<p>But there was no question. Tracy reached the rocky margin of
timber, passed by swinging arcs up the broken incline, and
attained the beginning of the canyon trail. A little farther on
he left it abruptly and headed toward the right. Over there the
terrain swelled and hollowed away like a rolling sea, gulch and
ridge alternating in endless succession. For a brief while Hugh
had a good view of it as it swept higher into the peaks of the
middle Mogul reaches; then, descending into the half-light and
the long solitude of the great pines, he lost the horizon
altogether. Trail ran into trail each small and vague; following
these at an easy pace, he kept bearing off to the eastward. In
that direction the general rim of the plateau reared itself from
the desert. Single-file, the other men came silently behind. But
presently Bill Vivian, directly to the rear of Hugh, began a
casual talk:</p>

<p>"You know, Hugh, there's more women in the world than
men."</p>

<p>"What of it?" grunted Hugh.</p>

<p>"Maybe," reflected Bill, "that's why there's so much trouble.
One of these days I think I'll take a vacation and follow that
idea to some sort of a conclusion."</p>

<p>"Don't use your head for something it wasn't built to
stand."</p>

<p>Bill's chuckle was softly infectious. "Remember the night in
Antelope when Sam Lafferty's boys figured you for an easy mark?
It was a swell-Iookin' barroom when we got through with it." And
after a short spell of quiet he added wistfully: "Wonder if
there'll ever be any old times like that again?"</p>

<p>"Don't look backward," said Hugh. "Dou't ever make that
mistake. Look ahead. For what it's worth, which is little; and
for what you can see, which is almost nothing, look ahead. If you
start sorting out the relics of the past, you blamed fool, you'll
get nothing but a headache."</p>

<p>"Still," insisted Bill, "we used to have a wallopin' good
time."</p>

<p>"Sure. Too young to know any better. We figured there wasn't
any day but the one in hand. We never had a dime, never worried,
never cared. It's only when a man gets ambitious and begins to
lay up possessions that he runs into grief."</p>

<p>"Moral&mdash;don't get ambitious."</p>

<p>"A fine moral," growled Hugh, "for vegetables."</p>

<p>That exasperated Bill, who made nothing of these sudden
contradictions of his partner. "Well, what in thunder is it all
about then?"</p>

<p>"There is no answer," said Hugh, with a return of the old
rebellious bitterness. Then directly afterwards he added: "But if
a man was meant for anything, I guess it is to keep ramming ahead
till he finds something that will do for an answer."</p>

<p>"Sort of a joke on him then," observed Bill shrewdly, "if he
reaches the end of his picket rope and don't find none."</p>

<p>"Well, he's anyhow put in the time trying. That's probably as
good as the answer itself."</p>

<p>Bill vented a disgusted, horsy snort. "What the hell are we
mumbling about? This palaver goes around in circles like a dog
reachin' for its tail. Yeah, I've heard it before from you and it
don't mean a thing. You talk one way, then you talk another. It's
yes and then it's no. You make wild passes about nothing bein'
worth nothin' and I get to thinkin' you're slippin'. Then you go
out and smack down six hands and the cook and I say to myself,
'Here's old Hughey back home again.' Sometimes you just defeat
me. Your old thinker don't track with your muscles at all. To
hear you say so, we're licked before we start and there ain't no
use startin'. But I have lived with you goin' on twelve years,
and I never saw you delay startin' anything you wanted to start,
regardless of how you figured it would turn out."</p>

<p>"Pass the plate, parson," drawled Hugh, "and I'll give you a
lead nickel."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," grumbled Bill, "I miss the old neighborly brawls we
don't have no more."</p>

<p>That was all. Once again they reached a clear crest and
sighted Mogul's slanting slopes and broken tiers; descending
immediately afterwards to the forest, they went steadily on while
the twilight grew heavy with lavender and the golden bars of the
late sun broke more infrequently through the matted branch tops.
Dusk came to them twice. It came softly to them here; half an
hour later Hugh made a sharp swing rightward, rode to the very
margin of Mogul's rim and saw dusk falling again, over the
prairie in rolling purple waves. The lights of Antelope lay
below, winking up with a fractured brilliance.</p>

<p>"I'll go down and scout," murmured Hugh. "If it looks all
right I'll come right back."</p>

<p>"No," objected Bill. "We got in a jackpot once before doing
this split act."</p>

<p>"The trouble last time," said Hugh, pointedly, "was that you
couldn't hold your fiddlin' feet in one place. Try to curb that
herd-jumpin' instinct for once."</p>

<p>"Rats!" grumbled Bill.</p>

<p>"A crushing reply," gibed Hugh and went forward. Within a
dozen paces the pony's head and shoulders dropped down a severe
grade that had the vague appearance of being blasted from the
sheer wall. It descended in one long, unbroken pitch&mdash;a mere
ledge without wagon width at any point. When he reached the
bottom, Antelope was the farther away by a good three quarters of
a mile. Swinging back, he put the pony to a gentle rack and
gradually drew toward the southern end of the town.</p>

<p>This was the brighter side; the last building against the
desert was the courthouse, whose dimmed lights crossed the street
mouth and made a kind of hurdle for him to pass. Curling off, he
halted at a point from which he could survey the walks. There
was, as far as he could make out, little life tonight in this
Antelope that ran the extreme of flood and ebb. A cowbell
tinkled, a hammer fell, one man's talk drifted on into the
darkness. That was about all. He discovered but three horses
standing at the racks, these in front of Lou Burkey's saloon.
Nobody appeared on the street.</p>

<p>But the barrier of light troubled him, and so he cut a circle
into the desert and passed around the town, to arrive at the
northern margin where the line of poplars condensed the quality
of the dark and precipitated it toward the earth in a ghostly
rain. Dust smell clung strongly to the air, the mark of a recent
traveler. But all the near half of town was lightless, and
utilizing this advantage he passed in between the silhouetted
building fronts at a casual walk. One man's cigarette tip glowed
and died and glowed again in the runway of the stable&mdash;Jinks
Bailey's stable. Behind the man was an ineffectual plaque of
dimmed lantern light. Hugh veered toward the runway, head tilted
down until the sweep of his hat concealed his face.</p>

<p>"Evenin'."</p>

<p>"Evenin'," said the other slowly.</p>

<p>"Jinks?"</p>

<p>"Me."</p>

<p>"How's things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so-so," said Jinks Bailey and lowered his cigarette. His
body shifted in casual deliberateness. "I can't see you. Who is
it?"</p>

<p>"Where's everybody?"</p>

<p>Bailey let out a small grunt. "If you don't know that you
musta come out of a deep grave."</p>

<p>"Nobody much in town?"</p>

<p>"No-o."</p>

<p>Hugh pressed the pony on into the stable, rode the length of
the runway and back again.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" challenged Bailey.</p>

<p>"Curiosity," said Hugh and angled across the street to
Burkey's high porch. He left the horse and stepped toward the
swinging doors. Against them, he changed his mind and moved on to
the window. Through this dull, dust-grained surface he saw Burkey
fairly definitely. Two other men, unrecognizable, sat farther
back in the room. Once more coming to the doors, he pushed them
open sufficiently to have some prior knowledge of what he stepped
into, and then walked through. The men in the rear of the place
were known to him by little more than name&mdash;being oldish
hands who had prospected the hills. Reassured, he laid his
attention on Burkey.</p>

<p>The saloonman's palms lifted slowly and fell flat on the bar,
and across his noncommittal face streaked a momentary
astonishment. Knowing there was no greeting called for, Hugh
offered none. Peremptorily, he asked:</p>

<p>"Anybody in town, Lou?"</p>

<p>Burkey shook his head with a slow, exaggerated side-to-side
gesture. There was a show of brilliance in the black eyes&mdash;a
quick and uncontrolled brilliance that evaded the otherwise
studied gravity. Seeing it, Hugh spoke again: "Nobody that I
should know&mdash;or shouldn't know, Lou?"</p>

<p>Burkey's lips compressed as his head moved once more in
denial. Reaching beneath the counter, he brought up a piece of
cloth and began casually to mop a bar that needed no mopping. The
gesture was innocent, but it brought Tracy's eyes directly down
to that bar's shining surface, and he noticed for the first time
a filled whisky glass sitting there and a cigar beside it. From
the tip of that cigar, half consumed, a faint spiral of smoke
curled. Lou Burkey stared past Tracy to one of the old
fellows.</p>

<p>"Sam, step up and finish your drink and take your stogy off
here before it burns a hole in the counter."</p>

<p>There was something wrong here. Tracy wheeled about and
watched the indicated Sam rise in reluctance and advance. The man
dropped his closed fist into a coat pocket with a gesture of
uncertainty. Tracy's prying glance caught the stem of a pipe
projecting from that fist. Yet he maintained his outward manner
of calm and turned back to Burkey.</p>

<p>"I won't disturb you by askin' for a drink," he said briefly
and turned to go out. Alert, strongly warned, he kicked the doors
wide before him and slid through. A long sidewise pace put him
away from the reflected lights, flat against the saloon wall.
Stationed there, all his nerves went cold and tight. One of those
three horses standing by the porch was Tade Shadrow's solid
sorrel, recognizable anywhere along the Powder. Next moment he
hurried on, reached the porch end, and dropped into the solid
dark thereabouts. Sharply reviewing the stable, he saw nothing of
Jinks Bailey's cigarette glow; but farther down the street,
toward the poplars, a body moved from walk to walk with a cat-
footed switfness.</p>

<p>Hugh thought rapidly: "Shadrow wouldn't be here without his
men. So it's somebody else riding Shadrow's horse. It wouldn't be
Lynn. It's either Tolbert or Maunders. Whichever one, he went out
the back way of Burkey's leaving that whisky and cigar." Then,
all his faculties whetted by this threat stalking the dripping
black, he went on with his reasoning, each thought framed in his
mind as clear and brief and swift as talk: "I never saw Tolbert
smoke a cigar. So it's Maunders. He went out the back way of the
saloon. That was him crossing to the east side. He'll be trying
for a fair shot."</p>

<p>Retreating from the porch end, he paused on the balls of his
feet, momentarily uncertain. Some faint thread of sound straggled
out of that area behind the stable&mdash;to make his decision for
him. He passed along the side wall of Burkey's building, reached
the abysmal gloom of its rear, and groped between back porches
and rubbish piles until he arrived at the alley separating the
general store and the saddle shop. This he took, drifting forward
to the street again. The stable was almost directly opposite.
Watching its runway, he saw Jinks Bailey's lantern go out.</p>

<p>"He won't be running," thought Hugh, mind on Sid Maunders.
"He's tried for me too long. He's too stubborn to quit. Why
didn't he make his stand in the saloon?"</p>

<p>It was odd enough. Yet this was a game of blood, motivated by
surreptitious and fragmentary impulses, in which man reverted to
animal cunning. Logic had nothing to do with it; there was never
much logic in the mind of one about to kill or be killed. A faint
rattle emerged from the stable and died, and Hugh wondered if
Bailey, the turncoat Bailey, had a part in this. The thought
brought along a small heat of anger, the only personal emotion he
felt. Toward Maunders he now experienced none of the fulminating
rage of past times. The episode had gone too far; it had begun so
long ago that at present it was in the nature of an inevitable
happening, advancing move by move, as certain as the stars above.
It was a fixed condition of his life and of Maunders's
life&mdash;the burning man-to-man animosities quite gone.
Impersonally reviewing that sentiment so utterly dominating him,
he saw himself and the big gunman propelled willy-nilly by the
fiat of those indifferent gods who ruled. And standing there, his
pulse slow and steady, his head clear as a bell, bereft of
nerves, he caught the quick tapping of footfalls on his
left&mdash;down by the town's dark end again. Maunders had passed
back to this side of the street.</p>

<p>"He's trying to place me against the courthouse lights,"
decided Hugh and ran softly over the dust to the stable. Between
the stable and the adjoining rooming house he swung and made his
stand, having parried Maunders's move and once more put the
gunman opposite. Time dragged out. An indistinct-rasping echo
floated from the stable runway, and a bit of glow fell out of it,
to die the next moment. Bailey was signaling.</p>

<p>Maunders's bulky body struck something over behind the saddle
shop. The minor report of that collision made an actual
reverberation in the singing stillness; and as if it were the
break in a tension impossible to hold longer, other things
immediately came to Hugh's ears. Above him, directly above him, a
second-story window of the rooming house grated against a tight
casing; up there a man whispered hoarsely. Straining the import
of it through that exceedingly fine mesh of suspicion, he tossed
the rumor aside. It was, he believed, some spectator more
agitated than himself. Water dripped melodiously out of the
stable trough, and through the stable wall seeped the patient
stamp of stalled ponies and the rub of their halters against the
feed boxes. There was a suspiration of an easy night wind through
the poplars over by the graveyard. A deep voice&mdash;Maunders's
lowering, breath-clotted voice&mdash;said:</p>

<p>"Come out, Tracy."</p>

<p>The maneuvering was over. Maunders had weakened and turned
reckless.</p>

<p>Rigid along the wall, Tracy raked the dense shadow whence the
challenge had come. He studied all those shadows opposite as far
as the saloon, saw nothing. Maunders said again, "Come out,
Tracy," with a terrific calm&mdash;and Hugh's attention fell upon
the man's dim bulk lodged at the near corner of the saloon, aside
the street glow. Tracy estimated that distance at ninety feet. He
thought of Jinks Bailey and of the man whispering above&mdash;and
then he closed his mind to thinking. Walking forward from the
alley, he passed beyond the sidewalk and halted in the
street.</p>

<p>"All right, Sid."</p>

<p>Hugh saw the man swing about, and he knew then Maunders had
expected him to be in the other direction&mdash;over by the
courthouse and against those lights. Maunders's breath poured out
in heavily expelled gusts. "Tracy," he cried, "I could of run but
I didn't! This has gone on too long! I'm goin' to find out about
that cursed luck of yours now and here! One of us don't ride any
more!"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Sid," called out Tracy. His fist came from behind
at a sweep, touched the gun butt and carried it up. Maunders was
moving, but the man's great bulk cast a denser shadow because of
that movement, and on the spreading outline Tracy pinned a still,
deliberate muzzle. One rushing, exploding crack of sound
overwhelmed Antelope's dark street and raced away in spinning,
lesser fragments. Behind Tracy a board set up a screeching
protest as the spent bullet struck. That was Maunders, speaking
first. Tracy's own gun kicked back, and all the furious
reverberations beat up afresh. Powder smoke drifted into his
face. Maunders came strangely out of his position, staggering
across the walk into the light. He was hit, but his gun rose
again, and Tracy, pressing his will doggedly and brutally into
the shot, fired once more on the fairer target. Maunders's head
rolled back, then it tipped down&mdash;raggedly down&mdash;and
all his joints buckled. He fell soundless and died without
moving.</p>

<p>Tracy said, droning out the words, "Bailey, you bet on the
wrong horse. Come away from the stable."</p>

<p>Bailey's voice traveled sullenly through the deep and dismal
quiet: "I had nothing to do with this, Hugh."</p>

<p>"Come out," commanded Tracy. "I want to see you."</p>

<p>The saloon doors swung. Lou Burkey stood framed in the light,
saying nothing at all. A man ran from the courthouse, calling;
"What's happened? Who's that&mdash;who's down?" There was a
rattling of windows from the darkened houses all along the
street. Tracy's talk hit Lou Burkey like the curling end of a
whip.</p>

<p>"I knew you in better days, Lou, and considered you had some
grain. Shadrow's made putty out of you. If you couldn't be for
me, why couldn't you keep your damned hand off me?"</p>

<p>"I never made a move your way, now or at any time."</p>

<p>"You lie, the same as Jinks Bailey lies. That glass and cigar
belonged to Sid. He went out your back door when I came in. You
tried to cover him."</p>

<p>The saloonman's voice broke a little. "Damn you, Hugh! You
ain't the one that lives with the fear of God hangin' over your
head day and night!"</p>

<p>"No?" said Hugh, coolly. "No?"</p>

<p>"No!" shouted Burkey. "And you've done nothing to help us by
killin' Sid Maunders! It's us in Antelope that will get all hell
hazed out of us when you're gone!"</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;" began Hugh and stopped. Bill Vivian and the
other men drove into Antelope's street with a rush and a yell.
Vivian lifted an arresting arm, brought his pony to a grinding
halt, and shouted at the shadows: "Hugh!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Hugh, quietly. "I didn't take the bullet,
Bill."</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Maunders. He's dead. But nobody can accuse him of not
tryin'." And a contemptuous anger stained his words. "The man was
a scoundrel, a rascal and a trickster. But he never hid behind
small words. He had guts. That's for your information, Burkey,
and it goes for the lick-spittle gentlemen of this town that
crossed their fingers and prayed for the profits to continue.
There is no place in hell deep enough or hot enough for a man
that swallows his pride and plays a game he don't believe
in."</p>

<p>"Fine&mdash;fine!" said Burkey and clipped the words between
his teeth. "You're drunk with luck, but the jag won't last.
Shadrow runs this country and will continue to do so. You're
through. And the gentlemen of Antelope will play the winning
side, as it is their right to do."</p>

<p>"Hughey," said Bill Vivian with a false gentleness, "he's
speaking out of turn. Shall I belt him?"</p>

<p>"You're through!" yelled Burkey, losing his head. "And here's
something that will put you back a notch! Judge Beakes left for
TS this afternoon with a marryin' license. If it's the girl
you're putting on the entertainment for, never mind. She'll be
tied to Shadrow by now!"</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy sprang across the porch and caught the saloonman at
the neck. "If you're lying to me, Lou, I'll break your back!"</p>

<p>Burkey strangled out a curse. "You wild fool! I have waited a
long time to see some of the pride knocked out of your bully
head! She's married now! Pull off your hands or I'll kill
you!"</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy's mind went dim. He lifted Burkey and shook him
like a loose sack. He whirled the man about and threw him out to
the street; and then he ran to the pony racked at the porch. In
the saddle, he shouted madly at the waiting riders: "Come
on&mdash;or stay behind!" And his roweling spurs fell deep into
the pony's flanks, sending ir off down the street in great
lunges. Bill Vivian emitted a rebel shout and leaned low in the
saddle, pursuing. The whole line stretched out; beating through
the dark, leaving a high curtain of dust behind, leaving Lou
Burkey in the street to spit out his rage. One high call came
back to Antelope&mdash;Bill Vivian sounding his shrill, eerie war
cry at the bright and eternal stars.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15. &mdash; END AND
BEGINNING</h2>

<p class="first">HUGH raced on past the poplars and down the
desert road overshadowed by the scowling face of Mogul. Fury
rioted in his head, and only one clear thought rose through
it&mdash; the thought that he must reach and destroy Shadrow.
Rather, it was not a thought, but an enraged, furnace-hot desire.
Such sane impulses as he had brought to Antelope town this night
were gone&mdash;swept up in the smoke of consuming temper. All
the considered plans were so much ruin. There could not now be
any waiting, and planning. Nothing was left but to smash
ahead&mdash;destroy. Moved by this conviction, he hurled his body
into the labored run of the horse, timing himself to the forward
surges, bending far aside as the beast rounded curves.</p>

<p>"She played into his hands," he told himself, and wondered why
the passing moments went so swiftly and the dim miles were so
long. It was a bitter fact&mdash;Lynn had played into Tade
Shadrow's hands. Now reviewing what had gone before, he wished he
had taken the time to explain to the girl Shadrow's intrinsic
character. With that knowledge, she never would have returned to
Shadrow&mdash;no matter how desperate their situation might have
seemed on the bald-topped butte. It was starkly clear to him.
Shadrow certainly knew by now what his, Hugh's, feelings for the
girl were. And balked in his one long-sought act of vengefulness,
he would turn to this other piece of mad deviltry with an
increased stubbornness, understanding surely that nothing could
so hurt, so irretrievably wreck.</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," said Hugh, aloud to the night, "he's
done all his life." No man knew what amount of pure ruin lay
behind Shadrow, how much there was of grim and conscienceless
injustice in that cruel career. When Shadrow was done with a
victim nothing remained but misery. "By God, I'll see he never
strikes again!"</p>

<p>Judge Beakes, so Burkey had said, had gone on to TS in the
afternoon&mdash;another crawling, double-faced henchman who would
obey Shadrow implicitly. It was utterly inconceivable that Lynn
would give her consent to the marriage. Yet that made little
difference. The marriage would be performed and its illegality
would never be published. Or if the marriage were not made this
day, Shadrow would use the brutal power in his hands to break
Lynn's spirit. Hugh Tracy had no need to enlarge the thought. It
was as bald and blunt as all the rest of Shadrow's tactics. Nor
was there any hope of a softer treatment.</p>

<p>For as he rode, he knew Shadrow would carry out such a plan
without compunction or scruple. There was actually no chance of a
last-moment relenting. Not from Shadrow. This cattleman whose
desires had never known a curb would force the girl, one way or
another, into the ceremony&mdash;and make it valid by the threat
of his power. Somewhere in the TS owner's make-up was a streak of
primitive violence, a savagery that considered no law.</p>

<p>The TS side road was invisible in the dark, but Hugh knew the
district too well to grope for it. At the same unchecked speed,
he veered, hit the incline, and let the pony have its own way
about going up. At the top the beast was deeply drawing, needing
a blow; the rest of the boys were quite a distance behind. But he
could not stop, and so he forged northward over the flat
heights.</p>

<p>Bill Vivian meanwhile had made the effort to draw abreast; but
the effort took too much out of his pony. So he contented himself
with keeping the pace. At the side road he called ahead and got
no answer. Reaching the summit, he called again and only saw Hugh
dimly beating away. Knowing Hugh as well as he did, a deep
apprehension overtook him, and he checked in until the rest of
the outfit drew abreast.</p>

<p>"Sabe!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said the young giant, cutting out of the line.</p>

<p>"That fool won't listen to anything!" bawled Bill. "He'll walk
right in! I don't know what we're up against, but you and me have
got to keep by him! Makes no difference what happens&mdash;we've
got to keep right by him!"</p>

<p>"Better ketch him first," grunted Sabe Venner.</p>

<p>They took the road side by side, quirts snapping down; and by
degrees they drew clear of the others. Yet twenty minutes later,
when the first TS light winked through the night, they had not
overtaken Hugh. Bill Vivian began to swear. "They'll pick us up
sure as little green apples&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hauled back violently. Hugh said curtly: "Slow down. We'll
walk the next half-mile."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd gone clean out of your noodle," growled Bill
Vivian. "And still think so."</p>

<p>"At a walk," warned Hugh. The rest of the group piled up and
spilled out of the road. Hugh went on, overreaching his own
admonition and traveling at a light canter. That single light
ahead brightened; dimmer lights began to stud the horizon. And
they were suddenly startled by the echo of a single shot rushing
out of the TS compound.</p>

<p>"Now who's quarrelin'?" muttered Bill.</p>

<p>Hard on his phrase followed a short burst of firing, a
concerted explosion of three or four guns, the sound rolling
deeper into the night. Hugh said something indistinctly. The
shadowed outline of all the TS buildings broke through the pall;
silence settled inside the plaza.</p>

<p>Hugh stopped, stepped to the ground, whispering:</p>

<p>"Follow behind."</p>

<p>He advanced at a dogtrot, pitched into an arroyo, rose from
it. Bill Vivian, right at his elbow, put in a quick warning:
"Careful&mdash;careful! Something's up."</p>

<p>Hugh paused while the others spread abreast. Directly ahead
was the bulk of the little barn, to the left of it a corner of
the main house. The road ran between, into the plaza; and from
this point of view they could see the bunkhouses aglow and men
hurrying back and forth across the open without much order. Hugh
whispered rapidly: "You boys crawl along the small barn and flank
those bunkhouses. The crew's all over there. I'm going to the
back of the big house and look in."</p>

<p>He advanced immediately at a cat-footed run, Bill Vivian
shadowing him all the way. At the house corner he wheeled, rushed
to the rear side, ran along it, and got as far as that same back
door out of which he had taken Lynn Isherwood two nights before.
It stood open, a mellow lane of lamp glow flushing over the
threshold.</p>

<p>Hugh broke out of the run and crawled to the very edge of the
opening, the murmur of talk in his ears; and when he put his head
around, into the light, he commanded the living room completely.
The girl&mdash;he saw her first&mdash;stood away, in the darkest
corner; Judge Beakes slowly tramped the floor from one side of
the room to another, agitation written all over his face; and
Tade Shadrow crouched by the inner door leading to his office.
That door was shut. Shadrow's body moved away from it, and his
one hand reached for the knob, while his other slowly lifted a
gun. Hugh Tracy lunged through the back doorway, throwing a
warning at Judge Beakes, now frozen in his shoes. "You're out of
this! Tade&mdash; !"</p>

<p>But Shadrow was caught up in his own maneuver. Back turned to
Hugh, he had twisted the knob of the office door, kicked it open;
and Hugh's call caught him exactly at that juncture. Instantly he
wheeled, the move pulling his body across the opening just made
and framing it there. He saw Hugh, recognized him; and all his
loose features seemed to contract until the bones showed through
and there was nothing alive on that death's mask but the burning
flare of the eyes. His shoulders lifted, and he brought his gun
around. Lynn Isherwood screamed, "Look out, Hugh! Look out!" Bill
Vivian, following Hugh into the room, threw his whole weight
against Hugh and drove him off balance. Vivian's revolver was
whipping up when the whole frame of the ancient building was
lifted and shaken by a double blast of shots, the sound flooding
out of Shadrow's office. Shadrow shrieked, "My God&mdash;don't,
Lake! Lake&mdash;don't do it!"</p>

<p>Beakes was speaking incoherently. "I swear I'm not in this,
Vivian!" And Vivian's green eyes glittered on the man with a
feline hunger. Somewhere&mdash;it was from the office&mdash;a
low, raveling voice said: "I'm happy to see you die." Shadrow
said once more, faintly, "Lake, don't do it."</p>

<p>Then he slid to the floor, sat there uncertainly, and toppled
over.</p>

<p>In the yard a deeply echoing yell touched off the explosion,
and one crash of firing beat into another. Lead drove through the
living-room windows, glass fell jangling on the bare floor. Tracy
ran across to the table, whipped out the lamp with his palm, and
rushed on to the office door. Looking, he saw Lake Tolbert at
Shadrow's desk, head pillowed on his hands. "Tolbert!" said
Hugh.</p>

<p>The girl spoke from her corner: "He's dying, Hugh. They shot
him from the plaza."</p>

<p>Bill Vivian walked past Hugh, touched the foreman's shoulder.
"He's through dyin'. He's dead."</p>

<p>"Blow out that lamp," said Hugh and swung back. With the
office light extinguished, the rooms were deeply dark; Bill
Vivian called calmly across the room: "Thirty dollars and board
ain't enough. Not when the boss don't live to pay it. They're
quittin', Hughey."</p>

<p>Hugh kicked back the door leading to the porch and plaza, of a
sudden conscious that the fusillade had diminished and died. One
single shot came belatedly; afterwards a man spoke somewhere from
the bunkhouses, morosely defiant: "Where's Shadrow?"</p>

<p>Bill Vivian cut in before Hugh could answer. "Lyin' on the
floor," called Bill. "You're on a dead man's ranch."</p>

<p>"Shadrow!" called the voice.</p>

<p>Someone breathed heavily into the ensuing silence. The far
spokesman asked: "Who's bore down on us?"</p>

<p>"Tracy!" bawled Bill Vivian. And then the silence settled
again, threaded by a yonder murmuring.</p>

<p>"All we want to do is pull out," said the spokesman. "How
about that?"</p>

<p>"Where are your horses?" asked Tracy.</p>

<p>"By God, Tracy," said the spokesman, "don't anything stop yuh?
You've wrecked something that couldn't be wrecked!"</p>

<p>"Where are your horses?" repeated Tracy stolidly.</p>

<p>"Behind the bunkhouses, saddled to go."</p>

<p>"Get on and go."</p>

<p>"No firing?" questioned the spokesman.</p>

<p>"Which way are you headed?" pressed Tracy.</p>

<p>"Antelope and on out."</p>

<p>"No," said Tracy. "You're going north. By daylight you've got
to be off Mogul and out of Powder."</p>

<p>"And how will you make us?" growled the spokesman.</p>

<p>"Do you want to open the scrap again?" asked Tracy.</p>

<p>"We're gone, then," said the spokesman, and added a slow,
defeated, "<i>Adios</i>, TS."</p>

<p>The figures of these men cut, shuttering silhouettes across
the bunkhouse lights, and there was a scraping of feet along the
floors. A door slammed, and some wild, reluctant rider sent back
an Indian cry that quavered shrilly and mournfully over the
settled peace. Then the drum of their departing ponies echoed
crisply into the night and gradully fell to a troubled murmur.
Hugh broke the spell by scratching a match. He lighted the lamp,
going immediately toward the girl. "Lynn&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lynn Isherwood's little military shoulders rose with her chin;
and she matched that deep intensity of glance that he fastened on
her with an even soberness. "No, Hugh, no. Nothing happened."</p>

<p>Bill Vivian walked from the office, profoundly puzzled. "Where
did Tolbert stack up in this thing?"</p>

<p>"Tolbert," said the girl, very slowly, "stayed when half the
crew went away. He stayed because he knew Shadrow meant to marry
me. When those men left, he was alone. All alone, Hugh&mdash;and
I think there must be some decent place for a man with courage
like that, bad as he was. He made his stand. They drove him to
the office and shot him. Shadrow called to them to do it. Shadrow
was standing at that door with his gun trained on it. Tolbert was
trying to crawl out here&mdash;and Shadrow was waiting for him
when you came in."</p>

<p>"Tolbert, tryin' to help you?" Hugh was amazed.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Lynn. "Yes, he was. He said you'd come back,
Hugh. He said nothing could keep you away!"</p>

<p>"And here I am," muttered Hugh Tracy. "Lynn&mdash;what's to
become of you?"</p>

<p>Bill Vivian swung on Beakes savagely. "Come out of here, you
long-necked monkey!" And he shoved the judge ahead of him to the
porch. Hugh's partners walked slowly across the yard, calling
from point to point, slowly rummaging the dark angles for
trouble. Lynn stepped away from the wall, came near Hugh, and
looked up with a queer blend of earnestness and suppressed pride.
She started to say something, checked it; and then cried out
swiftly: "Don't you know, Hugh?"</p>

<p>Hugh took her hand, rough with his words. "Lynn&mdash;if this
is the sort of an answer a man gets after the weary days, then
the world is all right!"</p>

<p>"I am in your hands. And glad of it, Hugh."</p>

<p>"Everything ends here on this ranch," said Hugh slowly.
"Nothing begins. The beginning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;is to be as I always wished it to be. In the morning
we shall go to Antelope. And drive back from there, married
people, in a flat-bed wagon loaded with supplies. And we shall go
straight to your house. And I shall go on with the caring of it
and of you, world without end. Amen."</p>

<p>Hugh Tracy's rugged face was ascowl with thought. "Lynn," said
he, "that is about all any man could want in one lifetime."</p>

<p>"Or a woman, Hugh."</p>

<p>Outside, Bill Vivian was swearing mildly at one of the boys.
"Keep out of that house, you blamed idiot. Him and her is in the
parlor, and it is none of our business what happens next."</p>
