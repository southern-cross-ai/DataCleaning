<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p class="first">TWO weeks from San Francisco the <i>Newbern</i>
dropped anchor in the tangle of sandbars and willow banks at the
mouth of the Colorado, transferring its freight and its sole
passenger, Eleanor Warren, to the steamer <i>Cocopah</i>, Captain
Jack Mellon commanding. Three days later, under a brass-colored
midsummer's sun, they reached Fort Yuma, tarried briefly and went
on.</p>

<p>"Ordinarily," Captain Mellon told her, "a military escort
would have met you at Yuma. The direct way to Camp Grant is down
the Gila, past the Pima villages and over the desert to the San
Pedro. But there ain't any military posts along the route and the
Indians are very bad, so you'll follow the supply line."</p>

<p>She stood in the useless shade of the <i>Cocopah</i>'s texas,
with a parasol tilted against the beating glare of white earth
and metal-yellow sky, and watched the low adobe outline of Fort
Yuma fade behind a pulsing, iridescent haze. A little hat made
its rakish angle on her auburn head and a dove-gray dress, meant
for more modish travel than this, fitted itself tightly at neck
and shoulders and waist. She was a slim girl and a straight one
and carried the unmistakable army mark&mdash;for she had been
born in a wagon bed ten miles short of Fort Snelling, Minnesota,
army regulations and the laws of nature not concurring, and had
spent all her twenty-one years, save the last three, following
the guidon. Now with the genteel training of Mrs. De Launcey's
Boston School for Young Ladies behind her, she was rejoining the
regiment at its most recent frontier. Twenty years ago that
frontier was Minnesota and Kansas. Ten years ago it had been the
Civil War and Texas; now it was Arizona.</p>

<p>Beneath her brows was the inquiring line of direct gray eyes.
She had a long composed mouth and a temper that could at once
charm a man or chill him to his bones; this was the competence a
girl acquired on the frontier, this was the manner of a girl
raised by men and taught by them. She was a little better than
average woman in height, with the bony structure of her face
making definite strong and pleasant contours. Two jade eardrops
stirred when she turned her head and a cameo brooch, once her
mother's, was clipped to her dress at the curve of her breast
line. Her skin was smooth and fair and flushed now by the
constant heat.</p>

<p>"For a fact," Captain Mellon admitted, "it is average warm. A
hundred and nineteen in the wheelhouse. It will be hotter up the
canyon but by then you will not mind it."</p>

<p>The canyon walls grew high and narrow as they chugged on. The
river was the exact color of chocolate and, since this was late
summer, at quite low stage. At night they tied up to any
convenient boulder and by day had their troubles bumping over the
tricky gravel bars. "One time," said Captain Mellon, "I was hung
up fifty-seven days on a bar." Yuma squaws now and then pushed
their short, copper-colored shapes out of the shore willows and
stared at the boat through the disheveled fall of their hair.
Sleeping, in such weather, was impossible. At mealtime the butter
was an oily liquid on the plate and neither the beans nor boiled
potatoes were palatable. On the eleventh day the <i>Cocopah</i>
whistled for Ehrenburg and pushed its nose against the
gravel.</p>

<p>"Captain," said Eleanor Warren, "it has really been a nice
trip."</p>

<p>Captain Mellon was young enough to pull at his mustaches and
old enough to feel worried about her. She was a tall, fashionable
girl who had made no single complaint on the trip and now was
obviously eager to rejoin her regiment. But Mellon thought of the
desert beyond, its scarifying heat, its stinging clouds of alkali
powder, its discomfort and its danger, She was leaving the last
semblance of comfort behind. "There's always something about an
army girl," he told her. "Damned if there ain't. Would there be a
young lieutenant in that outfit you're so anxious to reach?"</p>

<p>Her smile was long and soft, "Captain," she said, "you have a
sharp eye."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck," he said, reversed the <i>Cocopah</i> from
the gravel bar and steamed upriver. His farewell whistle blast
slammed back and forth between the canyon walls.</p>

<p>Ehrenburg was a scatter of miserable dobe homes on a treeless
bluff, one general store and the government warehouse which
received army supplies from the river boats and shipped them out
by freighting teams to the military posts scattered deep in the
Territory. A young lieutenant with cheeks broiled lobster-red,
and the lieutenant's exceedingly lonesome wife, welcomed Eleanor
Warren.</p>

<p>"You are," said the lieutenant's wife, "the only white woman
I've set eyes upon for eight weeks. Stay awhile. A more cheerless
camp does not exist and I think sometimes I shall lose my
mind."</p>

<p>But a detachment of the Sixth was waiting to escort her on.
She had hoped to see the men of the Third, her own beloved
outfit, so that she might sooner get the common gossip so dear to
her; nevertheless she was extraordinarily happy when, next
morning, she set out westward in an army ambulance drawn by four
service mules, flanked by eight sun-blackened raw-boned Irish
troopers and a lieutenant with blue eyes and a tawny yellow
mustache like Custer's. She was with her own kind once more and
nothing else mattered; there was no feeling in the world like
that of an army woman returning to her outfit.</p>

<p>Westward was the pure flare of the desert, broken by
silhouetted cacti and the blue blur of Arizona mountains rising
suddenly from the plain. The ambulance bounced along the stony
soil and fine alkali dust rolled up solid as flour, stinging her
eyes and skin. Within her small wall tent at night she listened
to the drowsy talk of the troopers around the camp fire, hearing
the names of Geronimo and Casadora and Antone, of Crook, of
massacred wagon trains and ranch houses in ruins. The edge of San
Francisco peak was a constant lodestar in the deep East. On the
third day they passed Date Creek, on the fourth they pulled into
Fort Whipple, hard by the little mining town of Prescott. This,
the headquarters of the military district, was in the cooler
hills. Two days later she crossed the hills to Camp Verde, and
there was whirled away by still another escort, high up to the
timbered Mogollon range, from the rim of which she had her views
of the Tonto Basin, wild and dark and rugged. This was slower
travel and the elevation brought a breath of sweet wind at
evening; but she noticed the escort rode with an aroused
vigilance, throwing out flankers by day and guards by night. Five
days from Verde the escort crossed Camp Apache's parade ground.
Dropping out of the ambulance she confronted Major McClure's
wife, the first familiar face of the old Third Cavalry.</p>

<p>"Why," said the major's wife, "you're a grown lady," and cried
shamelessly as she embraced Eleanor Warren. "Has it been that
long since I packed your trunk at Fort Stanton and watched you
go? Three years! I guess I'm just another dried up, leather-
skinned old army woman. What a pretty dress. Is that the Eastern
style now? How long have you been from Ehrenburg?"</p>

<p>"Twelve days."</p>

<p>"Well, it is three more to your father at Grant. If you think
the road so far is bad, wait till you see what lies ahead. The
detail from Grant hasn't come yet. Meanwhile we'll have a party
tonight and talk about the East. It's been three years since I
last saw lace curtains or a hotel room. I hope you can stay a
week."</p>

<p>But that night, sometime short of tattoo, a party of horsemen
crossed the hard-baked parade with a sudden clatter of hoofs and
a man's voice spoke from the porch of the McClure quarters. "Has
Miss Warren arrived?"</p>

<p>The officers and ladies of the post were all in this room;
suddenly they were smiling at Eleanor Warren as she rose and half
turned from the door, There was a quick step in the hall and
Major McClure drawled, "She's here, Phil," and then Eleanor
Warren swung about, soberly disturbed and afraid of the things
that might at this moment be on her face. She said in a small
uneven voice: "How are you, Phil?"</p>

<p>He stood before her, this Philip Castleton, his trousers and
shirt turned gray from riding and his naturally dark face further
colored by the intense Arizona sun. He was a big, black-eyed man,
quick and solid, with a driving energy that came out of him even
though he stood wholly still. He was straight-backed, physically
hard. There was a blaze of feeling in his eyes, and change came
to his face. He had presence enough to bow to the group of
ladies, but he said "Eleanor," as he stepped toward her. Her
soberness went away and regardless of propriety she walked into
his arms. This was the man she had loved as a girl of eighteen at
Fort Stanton. Now she returned to him as a woman, and all her
intervening fears faded and she knew nothing had changed. At this
moment she was happier than she could remember ever being.</p>

<p>The trumpets were blowing morning fatigue call, sunlight
rushed yellow and hard over the world, and the ambulance and ten
troopers of old K were waiting on the parade when she stepped
from Major McClure's quartets. They waited at the heads of their
horses, these bronzed rough men of her father's outfit. Most of
them were old friends&mdash;Sergeant Tim Hanna, whose tough Irish
lips were broadly asmile, and the Dutch sergeant, Conrad
Reichert, and Corporal Oldbuck who had carried her on his saddle
when, as a girl, she had visited behind the lines at Bull Run.
She went along the rank, shaking hands. "Hanna," she said, "what
happened to that Mexican girl at Stanton?"</p>

<p>Hanna brought a gauntlet up across the sweeping tips of his
dragoon mustaches: "Ah, now, you remember her still? So do I, but
I must be tellin' you about it in private someday. Nawt all the
men in old K troop are the gentlemen they look." There was a low
run of amusement along the line, and pleased approval. One last
private of the detail cantered across the parade and joined the
line. Lieutenant Castleton's voice hit him with a severity that
surprised Eleanor. "Jackson, report to me as soon as we reach
Grant. Eleanor, if you are ready&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eleanor Warren paid her respects to the gathered officers and
ladies and accepted Castleton's hand into the ambulance. Major
McClure's wife called, "Give my love to Harriet Mixler&mdash;and
tell her to come up here as soon as she can!" Castleton spoke a
quick command, the troopers mounted and wheeled as twos, the
ambulance rolled over the parade, took something less than a road
down a ravine, and soon left Apache behind.</p>

<p>Eastward lay the high rock rampart of the White mountains; in
all other directions the domes and spires and ragged edges of
hill country lay below the brilliant flash of sunlight. The
ambulance rattled along the road, traversed a narrow valley and
entered the rough ravines again. A cavalry detail passed them,
homeward bound; the officer in command lifted his hat, showing
Eleanor a face dull for want of sleep. Her own detail swung loose
and straight-backed in saddle leather, each man dressed in blue
pants, high boots and gray shirt opened against sunburned skin.
Tim Hanna, K's top sergeant, rode at the column's head, his
slouched hat turning constantly left and right in search for
trouble that might lie in these roundabout piney peaks. Low
cactus and sage and catclaw and amber forage grass scattered the
slopes. The way was windingly downward into a rougher country
than she had ever seen, leading southwest through the smoky heat
to Camp Grant on the San Pedro, a hundred and ten miles away.</p>

<p>Phil Castleton rode beside the ambulance wagon, now and then
speaking to her, but always breaking off to watch the trail. This
was a part of that same alertness she had noticed in previous
escorts. Everybody in the command rode heads up; every man swept
the rough contours and parapets of the surrounding hills, and
some of this tight, uncertain feeling got into her until she too,
found herself eyeing the catclaw clumps and the scattered
rocks.</p>

<p>Phil Castleton said, "The detail we passed was from A Troop,
out on night scout. Up this way the Coyotero Apaches are pretty
tricky. But we've got it worse at Grant. The Chiricahuas drift up
from the Dragoons and part of the Aravaipas are disaffected. We
have been chasing a subchief by the name of Antone for six
months."</p>

<p>"Phil," she said, "thanks for your letters. They were a
comfort."</p>

<p>He said: "Sometimes I hoped they'd make you lonely enough to
come back. Three years is a long time to wait, Eleanor."</p>

<p>She sat with her hands gripping the seat of the ambulance as
it pitched over the rough road, watching him with a solemn
sweetness: He was a man who seldom smiled, who was hard with
himself because of ambition, and sometimes hard with others
because of the wilful energy that drove him. It showed in the
uncompromising blackness of his eyes and in the set lines about
his mouth. All the way westward on the new Pacific railroad, and
on the boat and all across the wastes of Arizona she had been
afraid of this meeting, afraid of what the three years'
separation might have done to her as well as to him. But now,
seeing him, she was no longer afraid and small excitement lifted
her heart. Nothing was changed from that day when, as a girl of
seventeen she had first seen him ride up to Fort Stanton, fresh
from West Point and assigned to her father's troop, K.</p>

<p>"Phil," she murmured, "I wondered if it would be the same."
and looked down at her gloved hands.</p>

<p>He said, swift and certain. "I could never change, Eleanor.
But you have changed."</p>

<p>She was startled by his tone. "How, Phil?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Hanna called back: "Lieutenant." Castleton cantered
ahead and for a while both men rode side by side, studying the
trace of prior travel on the trail. They fell out of a low ravine
into a level, narrow valley and pursued it briskly, through
silver-gray clouds of fine-rising dust. Heat closed in strongly
and the smell of arid earth and of sweaty horseflesh condensed
around her. At noon they halted in the shadow of another narrow
canyon for bacon sandwiches and cold water from a spring, and
pressed forward into the black tangle of mountains. That night
they made camp beside the shallow trickle of the San Carlos deep
in the rugged wilderness of hills, near Natane's Butte.</p>

<p>Sitting before her little wall tent, Eleanor watched the
blackness of an Arizona night close down, thick and solid and
mysterious. Against it the yellow point of the campfire burned
with a motionless glow and the peaks of the range made faint
silhouettes high up, and the sky was a cloudy wash of stars.
Somewhere in this darkness part of the troopers lay on guard: in
the shadows beyond the fire the rest were rolled in blankets,
talking in drowsy, tired tones. Phil Castleton sat near her.</p>

<p>"Phil," she said, "how have I changed?"</p>

<p>He spoke with a dry, reluctant voice. "It is hard for me to
explain. I never was very sentimental, was I? But you've grown
up. I knew you would&mdash;and was afraid you'd not be the same.
When I came into Major McClure's quarters last night and saw you
standing there, it hit me very hard, You were tall and composed.
You were a lady, Eleanor. Better than that, you were a woman a
man gets to thinking about when he's out alone at night in these
hills. For me it has been a difficult wait."</p>

<p>"Phil," she whispered, "here I am, and very glad."</p>

<p>She stood up and watched him rise and remain still before her;
and was remotely disappointed that he let the distance remain
between them. His voice was short, holding many things back, She
heard the strain in him and wondered why he should seem to be
fighting this moment, with all that it could mean, away from him;
He had always been a man to hold himself in severe check, yet it
was odd that he should let it be so now when her own answer had
been clear enough.</p>

<p>He said: "Well, it changes a pretty drab world into a pretty
pleasant one for me, Though I ought to tell you that Camp Grant
is a hellhole for a white woman. Harriet Mixler has been the only
one there for six months and I think it has aged her five years.
I don't believe you know her. She came out from Baltimore a year
ago to marry George Mixler. She never did like the country, and
now she's about to have a baby, and if you weren't coming along
to keep her company I think she'd go crazy."</p>

<p>"Nothing could be that bad, Phil. I'm happier in an army post,
no matter how drab it is, than anywhere else in the
world&mdash;It gets in your blood, Phil!"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "Grant is pretty bad," Then he was silent.
She thought he was listening to the abrasive sounds running
through the blanketing black. A coyote howled high on the ridge
and nearer at hand an owl hooted and was still. Sergeant Hanna
came into the firelight, listening to that sound; and later
retreated from the fire.</p>

<p>"Might be an Apache's signal," Castleton said. "It's one of
their favorite ways of calling." Then he added at once, "Nothing
to fear. They don't attack at night." But the stillness of the
camp was deep and indrawn and she knew every man was awake in his
blankets, waiting for the call to repeat. "Eleanor," Castleton
said, very abrupt, "I hope we do not have to wait too long."</p>

<p>She knew what he meant. But the abruptness of it surprised
her, as other signs of his changeable temper had surprised her.
He went on in the same strained and half-awkward voice. "I have
never asked you. I thought it was something understood. Let's not
make it too long, Eleanor. I'd be a happy man if we could be
married within the month."</p>

<p>She was half listening and half controlled by the race of her
own thoughts. Then she said, "Yes, Phil. Yes."</p>

<p>He came forward and brought her shoulders forward with his
hands and kissed her and stepped back at once. "I'll apologize
for that. I shouldn't have presumed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her question was thoroughly puzzled, and a little forlorn; the
sweetness of this moment was all lost. "But why not, Phil?"</p>

<p>"You're alone here. I should have waited until you reached
Camp. Good night, Eleanor."</p>

<p>Lying on her cot later, she thought of him with a happiness
broken only by faint wonder at the unbending streak he had
displayed. He was a man with close-guarded emotions but it was
strange that at the one moment when he must have felt the same
upwhirl of tumultuous happiness she had experienced, he still
could not break through his reserve. She thought about it through
the long, still minutes. Nothing broke the camp silence, yet
gradually as she lay there the intimations of this land's
savageness and wildness and uncertainty began to color her
thoughts until it was a relief to remember the troopers crouched
out in that blackness, waiting and listening. This was the moment
she realised that the security of the last three years was
forever gone and that the deep safe sleep of those years was also
gone. As long as she remained on this frontier she would be
forever listening into the night mysteries. By day she would be
watching the trail as the troopers watched, alert and never
sure.</p>

<p><br> <br> In the middle of the following morning Castleton
dropped back to the ambulance and pointed to a high, black cone
in the near distance. Above the cone little wisps of smoke rose,
one following another. "Indians signaling. They know we're on
this road. Probably Antone's band."</p>

<p>They continued southward through the hills, the growing heat
indicating descent. Now and then they reached a dry creek bed and
rattled along it until some ravine closed about them and the sun
disappeared and the sound of their progress bounced from wall to
wall. This way they traveled, by steady marches and brief halts,
leaving a gray wake behind. Once, on the high rim of one such
narrow canyon a rock dislodged and fell and she heard it strike
and fall and strike again until the sound of it was lost, though
it still fell. That afternoon they rounded into a mountain-
cramped meadow and came upon a dobe whose doors and oil-papered
windows were ripped open. A horse lay warm-dead in the yard and
the smell of smoke still clung to the air. Castleton and Hanna
went into the dobe, soon reappearing. Castleton's eyes were quite
black; he showed his anger this way. "God knows what happened to
Bill Lay. This happened less than two hours ago. Hanna, throw
flankers on that bluff." Short of dusk he came to the ambulance
again, pointing to the tall column of a sahuaro cactus higher on
the slope. An Indian arrow stuck there, imbedded as far as its
feathered end.</p>

<p>They camped on a high roll of ground that evening; and in the
blue last dusk of evening horses' feet slashed through the gravel
of an adjoining ravine and a man called forward. The troopers
suddenly rose to stand by their guns, remaining this way until a
line of cavalrymen broke out of the canyon. Castleton walked out
to meet the detachment a few yards from the fire. She heard him
say in a half-curt voice: "What luck, Benteen?"</p>

<p>He sat in the saddle with a weary looseness, this tall thin-
flanked officer Castleton had called Benteen, He had no shoulder
bar, which marked him as a second lieutenant; the insignia on the
crossed swords of his campaign hat indicated I troop of her
regiment. Being a thorough army girl, Eleanor noticed these
details first and was afterwards compelled by a rising interest
to study the man himself. Riding dust covered his blue uniform
and sweat had caked this dust on cheeks deep-tanned by the sun.
He had extraordinarily long legs and his hair showed a sandy red
when he lifted his hat to release the sweat collected beneath it.
His hands, quite large-knuckled, lay on the saddle swell, and a
pair of gray, sleepy eyes lifted from Castleton and sent one
direct glance toward her. Afterwards he spoke with a voice that
was quite even, quite soft: "So far, just the ride. Antone's band
came down this way and scattered."</p>

<p>"They fired Bill Lay's ranch not long ago," said Castleton.
Eleanor, listening to Castleton's voice, believed she heard
something unfriendly and condemning in it.</p>

<p>"We'll have a look," Benteen answered. He turned in the saddle
and considered the half-dozen jaded troopers with him, and
Eleanor knew he was calculating their endurance, as a good
officer should. He raised his hand in signal, broke into a canter
and came on with a loose swing of his shoulders, passing within a
few yards of her. As he went by he raised his hat, gave her a
direct, unsmiling glance, and was soon lost in the dusk.</p>

<p>When Castleton came back she said: "Who was that?" and watched
the way his face remained in its set position.</p>

<p>"Tom Benteen, second lieutenant of I troop. He came to the
outfit about a year ago." Castleton let the information stand a
moment, later adding with some reluctance, "You'll meet him at
Grant when he returns from scout."</p>

<p>It was quite clear to Eleanor Warren that he had no liking for
Tom Benteen and since she was a wise girl in the ways of army
jealousies she put the information back in her head, remaining
silent. Darkness fell at once, black and complete beneath the
cloudy glitter of the Arizona skies. The fire bombed its yellow
brightness against the solid dark. Young trooper Jackson came
into the light and stood there with his head down until Castleton
called:</p>

<p>"Get away from that light."</p>

<p>The boy faded. Castleton said in a shorter, smaller voice:
"He's mooning about a girl that lives down the San Pedro. Not
much of a soldier. I think you must be tired. It has been a long
ride, and tomorrow will be just as rough. Good night."</p>

<p>Lying in the tent, Eleanor Warren listened to the long, far
wail of coyotes on the ridges until she found herself tense in
the blankets, half waiting for the unexpected to strike. There
was a picture before her, which was of Lieutenant Benteen
swinging like an old trooper in his saddle, as though he were
part of the saddle, lifting his hat as he ran by; not smiling,
yet with his smoky gray eyes alive to her.</p>

<p>This was all she remembered before sleeping. At gray dawn they
were on the road again, turning through one canyon and another on
the last descent. They struck the San Pedro and followed its
bone-dry bed down a flat, cramped valley asmoke with the tinder
heat, and at near dusk came to the junction of waterless Aravaipa
Creek where Camp Grant's dobehouses and tents made a kind of
square on the baked earth. Lights were shining through the blue
fog of evening and men moved from quarters as the detail arrived.
Paused by the brush-covered porch&mdash;the ramada&mdash;of the
longest dobe, Phil Castleton saluted and said:</p>

<p>"Sir, Lieutenant Castleton reports back from Fort Apache. Your
daughter is here."</p>

<p>Eleanor dropped from the ambulance seat, too eager to wait for
assistance, and saw the heavy shape of her father in the thick
shadows beneath the ramada. He didn't move and he didn't speak.
As she walked toward him she saw the lines running across his
plump cheeks, beneath the sweep of his white mustaches. He had
removed his hat and she observed that he had turned completely
gray in the three years of her absence. All he said was "Well,
daughter&mdash;" and raised his arms.</p>

<p>She wasn't quite crying when she kissed him; but an emotion,
so strong and so full, wouldn't let her speak; it was the feeling
that she had once had long ago as a little girl running to him
for shelter and comfort when her own resources failed her. This
was what was in her now, its memory carrying her the long
distance back to childhood. It lasted a moment, then left her
completely, and she stepped away to smile at him through tears,
sadly knowing her girlhood and her girlhood's sweet,
irresponsible happiness was forever gone. She could never again
go to him and be sheltered from trouble.</p>

<p>She said in a tone that had to be swift to be steady, "You
haven't changed, Dad."</p>

<p>He was a plump elderly man watching her with a soft-smiling
gentleness. "You look uncommonly like your mother did at twenty-
one. I must say you've turned into a damned pretty woman,
Eleanor."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p class="first">A WOMAN came slowly forward beneath the black
shadows cast by the ramada. Major Warren spoke with a quick
courtesy. "Eleanor, this is Harriet, Mr. Mixler's wife. She has
been the only white woman at the post."</p>

<p>Harriet Mixler's eyes were wide and round and unhappiness lay
tightly across her face. She said in a low voice: "It is nice to
have you here, Eleanor."</p>

<p>"If you will show Eleanor her quarters," said Major Warren
and, by old habit, he stepped out to inspect the returned detail.
The two women turned through the low door of the major's quarters
into a room's stale, dense heat. Lamplight showed a rammed-earth
floor and the flimsy partitions separating other small rooms.
Harriet Mixler led the way into one of these and stood still. Her
hand described a weary gesture toward an iron cot, a chair and a
wardrobe made of packing-box boards. Two pieces of fresh chintz
hung beside a single narrow window. "Your father wished me to
make this presentable, Eleanor. It is the best I could
contrive."</p>

<p>"You must remember," said Eleanor Warren, "I was born and
raised in places like this one. I love it."</p>

<p>"I hate it," said Harriet Mixler. Her accent was softly
Southern. She had been a slim and black-haired girl with sharp,
responsive features, obviously the daughter of some old-line
plantation owner; once lively and very gay and very quick-
tempered. All this, Eleanor Warren saw, in profound pity, was
gone. "George is out on a scout detail. I think you know
him."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eleanor. "He was at Stanton before I left, and
quite an eligible bachelor." She smiled at Harriet. "I think he
was one of my first secret attachments."</p>

<p>Harriet Mixler touched Eleanor's traveling dress. Her mouth
sagged at the corners. Her expression displayed bitterness. "That
is such lovely material. In Norfolk I used to dance all night.
We'd ride home by first daylight and eat johnnycake and oyster
fries. Didn't you just die when you had to leave the East?"</p>

<p>"No. I counted every day until I could come. You'll like it
here. You really will."</p>

<p>"Never," said Harriet Mixler, doggedly resisting the thought.
"I hate everything about the army. I shall be an old woman with a
leather skin and a ruined complexion in one more year. I sit in
that unbearable hovel down the line and hate the sight of myself.
I should have left here. Now it is too late. It is fifty-five
miles to Tucson, and nothing there but mud huts. It is more than
a hundred miles to Fort Apache, which is no better than here. It
is like being buried alive." She stared at Eleanor Warren with
those great, dark eyes so full of unhappiness. "Do you know what
I fear most? Doctor Shiraz is gone three quarters of the time
with the troops. When my baby's time comes he will be gone again.
I shall die without him. My mother died with me. Even the Indians
treat their women better than the Government treats its officers'
ladies." Suddenly she put both her arms against Eleanor Warren
and dropped her head. Her body trembled and she cried in a choked
whisper, "It's a blessed thing to have you here. I'm so
afraid&mdash;so afraid."</p>

<p>Eleanor Warren placed her arms around this girl. She murmured,
"Nothing will happen, Harriet." Men's voices ran through the
still, deep night and boots tramped the hard earth. Harriet
Mixler pulled back, smoothing her hair. She said in despair, "I'm
such a sight," and turned into the main room with Eleanor. Major
Warren came in with Captain Harrison of I troop. Harrison was a
raw-boned man with a long red nose and a black beard cropped
close. His taciturn eyes lighted up, which was rare for him. He
said: "Dammit, Eleanor, maybe we'll have some fun around here
now."</p>

<p>A voice in the other corner of the room spoke up. "We got beef
croquettes, Miss Eleanor."</p>

<p>"Cowen!"</p>

<p>Cowen wore a black broadcloth suit and a white starched shirt.
On his vest the huge links of his watch chain gently moved. His
hair was carefully greased down against his head, his mustaches
were shined and his face showed the nearest approach to pleasure
its grave woodenness permitted. Cowen, the Warren's cook since
'63, took unto himself most of the credit for raising Eleanor
through the stage of long legs and bad grammar. Cowen shook her
hand with the precise formality which was his idea of good
manners in public. "I have things to tell you about this
regiment," he said under his breath and left the room. The other
officers of the two companies were coming in, Ray Lankerwell,
Howell Ford, and Doctor Shiraz, who wore a set of flame-red
burnsides. Shiraz said, "You're still an army child, Eleanor,"
and claimed his kiss. He turned at once to Harriet Mixler, gently
pulling her to a chair. "Harriet, I want you to take some wine
tonight."</p>

<p>She held to the cloth of his coat sleeve. "Are you sure to be
here during the next two or three weeks?"</p>

<p>He had a deep, patient voice. "I'll be here. Right here."
Cowen brought in the supper and the group sat up to the table.
Major Warren's face was round and ruddy and cheerful as he raised
his wine glass, and for a moment all of them felt the emotion
lying behind his silence. He tipped the glass at his daughter and
said, "To a lady."</p>

<p>"To a lady," repeated Shiraz.</p>

<p>"And," said Major Warren with a gentler tone, "to
Harriet."</p>

<p>They drank on that and suddenly the conversation was strong
and pleasant even though dull heat smothered the room. Shiraz
rapped on the table and pointed a finger at Eleanor.</p>

<p>"Let's see now how much you remember. The column is in fours,
approaching a narrow defile. What do you do?"</p>

<p>"The command is by twos, march. Numbers one and two of first
fours continue on. Number three and four oblique to right and
follow in. Other sets repeat."</p>

<p>"Who carries the guidon?"</p>

<p>"Ranking corporal, sir. His place is left file of first
platoon."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Shiraz. "Tomorrow I shall try you on a
horse."</p>

<p>"Docter," said Eleanor sweetly, "do you remember falling off
the big roan, at Stanton?"</p>

<p>The other officers except Castleton let out a tremendous hoot
and even Harriet Mixler smiled. Eleanor noticed that Castleton
watched her and seemed untouched by the burst of amusement. He
sat to the table with his shoulders straight, though the other
men were slouched and easy, as though even then he could not
quite let go, as though his fiery energy held him in a strict and
dark and impatient mood. The campaign had thinned him and
blackened him but it had made no change on the sharp, half-
handsome detail of his features. He was as he had been at
Stanton, a strict and ambitious officer who drove his men hard
and himself harder.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Shiraz, "you don't learn the subsequent
catastrophes I've had with horses."</p>

<p>"Cowen," said Eleanor, "will tell me all about it
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Ah," groaned Shiraz, "you always knew more about the regiment
than anybody else."</p>

<p>She said: "Will you ride the hills with me in the
morning?"</p>

<p>Major Warren put down his knife and spoke plainly. "This is
not Stanton, Eleanor. That's the first thing you must know.
Nobody leaves this post at any time except under escort. There
are Apaches within ten feet of the sentries this minute. Tomorrow
when you look beyond the picket line and see a clump of yucca it
is exactly an even chance that there's an Apache's head
underneath it. We lost a teamster two days ago. He only went
forty yards beyond the stables. We found him with an arrow
through his chest. No riding, Eleanor."</p>

<p>Castleton's searching glance brought Eleanor Warren's
attention to him. There was a question on his face, plain and
demanding. The yellow lamplight showed strong, sudden color on
her cheeks. She dropped her eyes, hearing him say in a voice
brushed by excitement: "Major Warren, I should like&mdash;"</p>

<p>Out in the darkness a sentry's challenge rode the night and a
slow sleepy answer came forward. The sentry called: "Corpr'l of
the guard, post number one!" Major Warren excused himself and
left the room, and on the parade was the arrival scuff of horses.
There was a little silence, with the other officers curiously
watching Phil Castleton. "What was that?" asked Captain Harrison
in his blunt way.</p>

<p>"I think I should wait for Major Warren's return," said
Castleton.</p>

<p>Quiet and quick-eyed, Eleanor Warren noticed the way they
watched Castleton. With interest, but with reserve, as though
something held them off. He had so little of their loose-muscled
comfort, he had so strong a will to get on in his profession. It
was an impetuous quality, it was his strength. Yet&mdash;and this
she thought slowly and with a certain reluctant
admission&mdash;it was a weakness too. Garrison life was a close-
knit society; there had to be a good deal of give and take. She
thought, "I shall have to warn him of that."</p>

<p>Her father's voice was hearty and cheerful in the yonder dark.
Somebody spoke to him in soft-sprawling words; the dismissed
troopers moved across the parade. Major Warren returned to the
room with the long-legged lieutenant she had seen the previous
night in the hills.</p>

<p>"Eleanor," said Warren, "I present Mr. Benteen of I troop. My
daughter Eleanor, Mr. Benteen."</p>

<p>Benteen pulled his hat from a head of sandy-red hair. He was
taller than any officer in the room. A day's growth of red-
glinting whiskers covered his face, chalked with alkali dust and
the dry stain of sweat tracks. His eyes showed weariness clear
down to the gray depths and his shoulders showed it, lying slack
beneath the gray campaign shirt. He had heavy cheekbones, with a
small scar making its white cut on the right side, and long lips
that came definitely together.</p>

<p>Eleanor Warren put out her hand. "I'm glad you're in the
regiment. Mr. Benteen."</p>

<p>Shiraz said to Benteen: "I give you warning, Tom. She's been
in this army a long time and knows the regulations better than
most officers."</p>

<p>His hand was extremely wide and heavy at the knuckles. There
was a deliberateness about him and she knew, as the silence ran,
on that he took his time about all things. This was the way he
stood, steadily considering her, as though he meant to have his
good look and find out what she was like; and for some odd reason
she had the feeling that, behind those gray and indolent eyes, he
was placing her against other women he had known and making
comparison. In a way it put her on the defensive, it disturbed
her. When he smiled, his lips spread back from heavy white teeth.
His voice was effortlessly slow.</p>

<p>"You have been mentioned many times. I wish I had been at
Stanton. As it is, I'm getting a late start."</p>

<p>It was a polite man's reply and yet the casual inflections of
his voice stirred her strong curiosity.</p>

<p>Captain Harrison said: "Did you cut Antone's tracks?"</p>

<p>"He's eighty miles back in the Pinal Range by now. But I know
something about his habits which will be useful on the next
chase." He moved over to Harriet Mixler, his long body bending a
little. Eleanor saw his expression turn gentle. There was a
definite affection in his voice. "I passed George's detail
yesterday. He'll be back tomorrow."</p>

<p>She noticed the little glow of pleasure this man brought to
Harriet Mixler's face. It was a way he had, it was some knowledge
he possessed of women. Phil Castleton, she noticed at once, was
seemingly disinterested in this scene. His glance touched Benteen
and came away; and she realized again that he didn't like
Benteen. It was a knowledge that strangely troubled her. Phil
Castleton turned to her, the question again in his eyes; he moved
beside her.</p>

<p>"Major Warren," he said with a kind of curt nervousness in his
talk, "Eleanor and I wish your consent."</p>

<p>Warren had a black Mexican cigar in his mouth. The tip of it
flew upward and he reached for it and withdrew it, sincerely
astonished. Doctor Shiraz breathed a long "Well, I'm damned." and
then this silence grew quite strange. Eleanor Warren took
Castleton's arm, embarrassed by the combined scrutiny of these
people. She felt the rigidness of Castleton's body, as though it
resisted the room, as though he were prepared for trouble.
Something here was very odd, something in the silence. Benteen
moved around the group, his head riding over all of them. His
glance drew her attention and again, as before, she knew he took
her somewhere into his deep-lying thoughts.</p>

<p>Her father said in reflective tone: "It is a nice thing to
know. Of course you have my consent." He offered his hand to
Castleton and he looked at the younger officer in a way she never
forgot&mdash;in a way she was never able to describe to herself.
Harriet Mixler came over. "Eleanor," she said. "Eleanor."</p>

<p>A sentry challenged across the darkness and a call ran back
along the line for the corporal of the guard; boots trotted over
the parade. She didn't realize until that moment how highly keyed
this post was to the black mystery crowding down from the hills.
All the men stirred, as though catching the scent of trouble.
Howell Ford slipped from the door, but was soon back. "Nachee is
here with something."</p>

<p>Warren turned out, followed at once by the other officers.
Eleanor Warren started to go along, to be held back by Harriet
Mixler's sudden-reaching arm. She was visibly shaking. "Don't
go!" she said. "Stay here!"</p>

<p>From the doorway both women watched the forming scene on the
parade ground. A man ran up with a lantern, holding it high. By
this light Eleanor saw the Apache Indian half surrounded by
officers. He was small and wiry, dressed in a shirt, breechclout
and moccasins whose leggings were folded down. A headband held
back jet hair, and his eyes, struck by the lantern light, had a
distinct gleaming. He carried a sack over his back.</p>

<p>Her father called: "Where's Manuel Dura?"</p>

<p>A civilian brushed through the shadows of the parade and came
to the group. Her father said: "Find out what he wants,
Manuel."</p>

<p>Manuel Dura spoke in a soft, sliding, twisted tone, moving a
finger back and forth in front of the Apache. The Apache's face
was impassive, unstirred. He answered swiftly.</p>

<p>Manuel Dura said: "He won't talk unless Nantan with the Long
Legs comes. He knows Mr. Benteen best."</p>

<p>Eleanor hadn't noticed until now that Benteen was at the
corner of the house, well away from the parley. He stepped
forward.</p>

<p>The Indian talked, Manuel Dura interpreting. "Major, he say
you want the Indian that keel the teamster. Nachee is good Indian
but the other wan was bad. So Nachee bring you the bad wan."</p>

<p>Benteen said something in the Apache tongue. The Apache lifted
his chin and grunted "Enju," and threw the bag from his shoulder.
Some object dully struck the earth, whereupon Castleton swiftly
stepped forward, to hide it from the women, But he had not been
quite quick enough. Eleanor wheeled against Harriet Mixler,
turned cold and sick, trying to block Harriet's view. Out of the
sack had rolled the severed head of an Apache.</p>

<p>"Dammit," grunted Warren, an involuntary break in his
voice.</p>

<p>"What was it?" whispered Harriet Mixler.</p>

<p>"I didn't see," answered Eleanor. The Indian slipped into the
darkness without another sound. Doctor Shiraz reached down,
pushed the head into the sack and took up the sack. He said,
coolly, "Very good specimen," and went along the parade toward
his quarters. The other officers broke away. Major Warren
returned with a most wry expression on his lips. He looked at
Harriet Mixler and at once lied: "Brought me a broken jug. That's
the Indian sign for punishment to one of its people." He went on
into the room and poured a drink of wine. Castleton stood at the
doorway, watching Eleanor a moment, He said, "I'll see you
tomorrow," and cut across the parade.</p>

<p>"Walk back to my dobe with me," said Harriet Mixler,</p>

<p>They turned along the officers' row. Tattoo call broke the
heated dark, each note cutting a clear long echo over the parade,
over the adjoining valley. Sentries were passing the hour call
from post to post, that ritual running from number one at the
guardhouse all the way out to lonely number ten in the tangle of
sage brush at the mouth of Aravaipa Creek. Along the right side
of the walk, on the parade, lay the silhouette of officers' iron
cots. Lights winked from the windows of the irregular quadrangle,
and somebody in the barracks sang out:
"Canreen&mdash;Canreen."</p>

<p>Harriet Mixler stopped by her door, supporting herself against
the frame with an arm. She said: "I wish George would come back.
It is such a cruel country. When the baby is born&mdash;as soon
as it is able to stand traveling&mdash;I'm going East. I'll never
return to the army."</p>

<p>"How long have you been in the army, Harriet?"</p>

<p>"A year."</p>

<p>"Wait another year, and you'll never like another kind of
life."</p>

<p>"Not me," said Harriet Mixler in that same dead, resisting
voice. "I won't stay. Goodnight."</p>

<p>She walked uncertainly into the house. Eleanor strolled on,
her shoes striking quick echoes through the increasing quiet.
Directly in the east lay the black bulk of the Galiuro Mountains,
their summits high and vague against the sky's grayer black.
There was no wind and scarcely any lessening in the heat of this
smoldering air. Lights died here and there along the quadrangle.
The smell of dust and nearby stables, of sage and of newly baked
bread, or leather, of canvas&mdash;all these old familiar odors
of an army post were here, comforting to her, sinking into her
consciousness, welcoming her home.</p>

<p>She had turned the corner of officers' row when she heard
Captain Harrison's disgusted voice drift through the doorway of
the last dobe house. "Three aces&mdash;and you catch a flush.
Someday, Benteen, you'll break your neck trying to fill those
damned things."</p>

<p>Benteen's tone was as it had been earlier in the evening,
drowsy and let down: "An agreeable way to die."</p>

<p>She turned and watched them a moment, through the doorway.
Harrison and Shiraz and Benteen and Howell Ford and a civilian
sat around a small table, half obscured by the heavy drift of
tobacco smoke. It was Benteen she found herself watching, with a
definite curiosity again rising. He lay back in his chair with a
complete looseness, as though no single muscle were alive. His
feet sprawled beneath the table and his long arms lay on it, one
hand touching a glass of whisky. A black Mexican cigar slanted
from a corner of his long mouth. She had a partial view of his
face, again noting that though he wasn't smiling, the hint of
some smiling knowledge lay below. She guessed that he was not
more than twenty-five or twenty-six, which made it odd that he
should have a kind of seasoned completeness about him, and the
suggestion of so much mature feeling behind the faint skepticism
of his solid features.</p>

<p>Captain Harrison said: "What are you going to do with that
damned grisly head, Shiraz?"</p>

<p>Doctor Shiraz spoke: "Let the dry air mummify it. I think I
shall send it to the Smithsonian. It's a rare piece."</p>

<p>"Only an army doctor would have such a hellish interest,"
commented Harrison. "I'll take three cards."</p>

<p>Eleanor turned back, walking faster, and saw a dark shape
waiting near her father's quarters. Her heart quickened a little
when Castleton spoke.</p>

<p>"Eleanor," he said and came to her. There was a swiftness in
his words sweet to hear, sweet and yet strange. "Eleanor, God
knows I'm glad you're here. I've been lonely." In this darkness
his constraint was gone. He took her and kissed her and for a
little while she thought of nothing else; after three years of
waiting this was the way she had wanted it, this was the way it
ought to be.</p>

<p>She stepped back from him, breathless and close to laughter.
"Why should you be lonely, Phil?"</p>

<p>He said: "I'm not the poker-playing kind, Eleanor."</p>

<p>She recognized the indirect comment on the game at the end of
officers' row. Some of this man's opinions, she admitted, were
shaded by an envy or a narrowness which sprang from the intense
pride she so much admired. He had never permitted himself the
luxury of being idle or foolish in the manner of the average
officer. She was an army girl, completely understanding these
vigorous and open-handed and extremely simple men who rode
through the desert dust; and she knew the solace they found in a
cigar, in a drink of whisky, in a game of poker after the routine
and the hard work was done. It was, she thought to herself,
something she would have to make Phil Castleton see before the
unrelieved tension of frontier garrison life turned him sour. She
said gently: "It would be good for you, Phil. Why don't you join
them?"</p>

<p>In one short phrase, he told her why&mdash;though he didn't
realize it: "I have not been asked to join them."</p>

<p>She said, "Oh, my dear man!" But she said it under her breath,
It was a revelation that shocked her and roused her
protectiveness and drew her nearer him. Some act or some phrase
or some manner of his had created their quiet dislike, and this
was a terribly serious thing in so compact a family as the
regiment, Men could be cruel in their judgment of other men;
cruel and realistic and sometimes unforgiving. Whatever he had
done to turn them against him had to be undone. She had to find
the cause and make it clear to him. "You must put it in their way
to ask you," she said.</p>

<p>His short answer showed his freshening resentment. "I have no
time to learn post politics, Eleanor."</p>

<p>"You will be handling men all your life. It isn't politics. It
is your career." But she was thinking, "I shall have to manage it
better than this." He was a square, tense shape in the darkness;
he was silent, involved in his own grievances. She put her hand
on his shoulder, lightly reassuring him. "Wait until we're
married, Mr. Castleton. I've been in the army a long time and I
know the fine print at the bottom of the regulations."</p>

<p>He said, "It has been a long wait, Eleanor," and pulled her to
him again, This was when all trouble dissolved, leaving her
hopeful and excited. Yet it was strange that one part of her mind
remained cool and critical. Even as he held her he was not, she
felt, thinking of her. He was locked up in himself, involved in
his own reasoning. She stepped back, murmuring, "Good night,
Phil," and watched him swing down officers' row to his own
boxlike dobe, She went directly to her father's quarters and
found him waiting.</p>

<p>He had something on his mind. "It occurs to me," he said,
quite carefully "that perhaps I didn't express myself very well
when Castleton broke the news. It took the wind out of an old
man, daughter. But you know how I feel. It is a damned nice thing
to know you'll be in the regiment&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said: "How did Mr. Benteen come to us?"</p>

<p>He looked at her a puzzled moment, trying to fathom the
question. "Well," he said, "Benteen worked up as a private in the
Civil War and took a presidential appointment to West Point. He
had quite a war record. They assigned him to the engineer corps
but he liked our arm best and got a transfer. The man's a soldier
down to the marrow."</p>

<p>"Does he rank Phil?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She said, "Why do the officers&mdash;" and killed the
question, knowing she would never get help from her father. He
wasn't the man to favor one officer over another, or to express
opinions about them. So she turned into her own room, hearing him
say, "Up to your neck in post gossip already."</p>

<p>She undressed, threw on a robe and pattered out to her bed on
the parade. Lying there with her face turned to the far, cloudy
starlight she listened to the fading sounds of the camp.
Presently her father moved through the darkness and dropped on
his cot with a long, contented sigh. Coolness at last faintly cut
the edge of the heat, tremendously relieving. In the distant
corner of the parade a trumpeter tentatively breathed sound into
his instrument and then blew taps, those sad strong notes
carrying far through the shadows. Lights died around the
quadrangle and the muffled tramping of the sentries ran around
her. Lying there, buoyed up by her return to all these familiar
things, Eleanor thought, "I shall have to find out why they
dislike him," and then was remembering the manner in which
Benteen's steady eyes had watched her and absorbed her into his
memory. Thus she fell asleep.</p>

<p>A voice said "Major Warren!" in hard-breathing excitement and
she woke, bolt upright. Shadows raced over the parade. Someone
called: "The Summerton wagon train&mdash;down in the canyon!" A
trumpet blasted out its call To Horse and lights broke the
shadows and men were shouting all along the barrack and picket
line. "I got through," said the exhausted voice. "The
rest&mdash;I do not know&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could not mistake Lieutenant Benteen's long, solid voice.
It called: "McSween, rout out the men."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<p class="first">HER father's long white nightshirt swayed
through the curdled shadows. Benteen crossed the parade on the
trot. Her father said, "Take the first twenty men you find ready
and go out. You know the place?"</p>

<p>Benteen said, "Yes, sir. In the canyon," and wheeled around.
His voice ran down the night, strong-toned against the rush of
men along the parade. "Sergeant McSween&mdash;twenty men, either
troop. Oldbuck, fill up some extra canteens."</p>

<p>Major Warren called: "Dr. Shiraz, you will accompany the
detail."</p>

<p>Troopers were already forming in the center of the parade,
hustled to it by McSween's bronze-throated urging. Phil Castleton
came up to Warren. Eleanor heard excitement sing in his words,
"May I be permitted to go, Major?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;certainly," said Warren. He walked toward
quarters and swore one passionate oath when his bare feet snagged
the porch boards. Howell Ford ran by, He said to nobody in
particular, "That's Antone again!" Sitting upright on her cot,
cold in spite of the night's heat, she saw the troopers forming
line. They were mounting off.</p>

<p>"Prepare to mount! Mount!"</p>

<p>She heard them hit their saddles. Dust rose along the parade.
"Right by twos, march!" The line moved by her. Benteen's voice
was long and cool. "Gallop!" The detail swept out of the parade,
hoofs solidly pounding the parade. Harriet Mixler was calling,
"Eleanor&mdash;Eleanor," but Eleanor Warren waited another
moment, following the detail with her ears as it reached the bed
of the San Pedro, rushed over the gravel and struck into the
southwest. Presently, when the clatter and rumble was quite gone,
she went to Harriet Mixler's cot and bent down. Harriet's body
shook. She seized Eleanor's arms. She breathed: "Don't leave.
Stay here&mdash;right here."</p>

<p>Benteen led his detail southward up the dry course of the San
Pedro, following the rutted freight road to Tucson. As long as
the way was open he kept on at a gallop past the lights of Valley
ranch and onward through this solid night, against which the
tracery of paloverde and high-stalked pitahaya made a ghostly
show. They dipped over the gravelly bottom of a wash and dropped
to a walk. Dr. Shiraz rode at the column's rear. Castleton drew
abreast Benteen.</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Two wagons freighting supplies to Summerton's ranch. It was
after dark. There were four men. The wagons were burned and the
mules killed. I don't know about the men."</p>

<p>"Don't understand how old-timers would ride into ambush," said
Castleton, unfavorably. "These people grow too careless. It would
be Antone again, of course. I thought you said you tracked him
into the Pinals."</p>

<p>"Maybe I was mistaken," said Benteen.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Castleton answered. This was the way Benteen's
presence always affected him, rousing a resentment he could not
wholly conceal. The tall sandy-haired man's manner, casual to the
point of indolence, affronted his own conception of an officer's
demeanor. To him Benteen was loose and slipshod, neither a
student nor a disciplinarian, possessing none of that hard and
lonely detachment, none of that driving sense of duty Phil
Castleton had set his life by. Yet this man was considered the
best Indian campaigner in the regiment.</p>

<p>The lights of the fort died behind and the little valley swung
west, sidling against the edge of the Tortillas. Eight miles
onward the party entered a defile between the Santa Catalinas and
the Tortillas, and sank into deeper darkness:</p>

<p>Benteen broke from his long riding silence to ask Castleton a
question that stirred the latter's surprise. "You like this
country, Phil?"</p>

<p>Castleton said: "I take my tour of duty at any post, like or
dislike."</p>

<p>"No," said Benteen softly, "that wasn't what I meant."</p>

<p>"It is a little late at night for philosophy."</p>

<p>"The later the night the better the philosophy," said Benteen.
"The stronger the cigar, the deeper the drink, the more beautiful
the women&mdash;the better the thoughts that come. There are no
nights like Arizona nights, no sound or smells or colors as sharp
as these. It is a land that does everything full tilt, it burns a
man black, it dries him as brittle as a bleached bone, it puts
him closer to heaven than he's ever likely to get."</p>

<p>"Poetic fancy," said Castleton.</p>

<p>Benteen's chuckle was deep and loose and free. "You're missing
something, Phil. You will not find it in Cooke's Cavalry
Tactics."</p>

<p>The rooting was rocky and rough, against which the shod hoofs
of the horses rattled, those sharp reports running ahead. Every
sound grew larger&mdash;the squeal of leather, the faint jingle
and clack of metal. When they stopped for a brief rest, silence
pushed down like a weight. The canyon closed in to twice a
wagon's width, its walls were smooth faces reaching five hundred
feet above. Above them the sky was a glitter of distant
stars.</p>

<p>Sergeant McSween murmured: "The Mexican said 'twould be at the
first open spot. 'Tis a half a mile ahead, sor."</p>

<p>They went on. Benteen said, over his shoulder, "Close up."
This was the heart of night, this dense two o'clock hour that
blindfolded a man with the thickness of its shadows. Somewhere
water spattered out of a rocky fissure and a sluggish current of
air blew faint coolness against the detail; and in the air was
the smell of smoke. The walls, as they progressed, fell back a
little. Castleton, riding as second man in the single-file
column, saw Benteen's shoulders weave and seem to rise. Benteen
halted without command, the rest of the men gently bumped
together. Ahead of them a fire's red eye showed dully; the smell
of burnt wood and of cloth and coffee was very strong. Benteen
called forward: "Hello, wagons."</p>

<p>The call rolled over the small clearing and re-echoed against
the canyon walls. The smell of powder still clung to the air.
When Benteen moved forward again, Castleton pulled out his
holster flap and lifted the revolver; he came abreast Bentsen,
Both of them rode toward the solitary eye of fire. Benteen
murmured, "McSween," and dismounted, stumbling at his first
forward step. Castleton saw his shadow sink against the earth and
he heard Benteen's grumbling curse. "This is one of
them&mdash;dead as sin."</p>

<p>Troopers moved around the clearing. Going forward, Castleton
brought up against some kind of a solid box dumped from the wagon
train. Supplies had been scattered around. Heat from the recent
fire moved against his face and, closer to the single red eye of
light, he touched a still hot metal of a wagon tire.</p>

<p>McSween's voice came from the far side of the clearing.
"Nawthing over here, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>Benteen waded the warm ashes of the burnt wagons, exploring
the area thoroughly. He returned to the dead man and struck a
sulphur match. It was a Mexican, face upward and his arms flung
out. The match struck an orange glitter across Benteen's long jaw
and died, and the blackness was greater than before.</p>

<p>McSween said, deeper in the canyon: "The mewels are in a
bunch. The damned savages led 'em here and kilt 'em."</p>

<p>Benteen said: "One dead. The other three got away in the dark.
They were very lucky. McSween, leave five men here. We'll send an
ambulance out in the morning to pick up this fellow."</p>

<p>"Benteen," said Castleton, "it is two hours until daylight. I
should like permission to stay here and pick up the tracks of the
Indians. It will save a good deal of time."</p>

<p>"This," said Benteen, "happened sometime after dusk. Six hours
ago. By now the Indians are forty miles away."</p>

<p>"Do I have your permission?" insisted Castleton.</p>

<p>"No," said Benteen.</p>

<p>Castleton stamped back to his horse, boots grinding deep in
the loose gravel. Benteen said, "McSween&mdash;" and quit. A
voice&mdash;a woman's voice&mdash;came coolly from a corner of
the night. "Will you take me to Camp Grant, Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>Benteen muttered an astonished, "In God's good name," and ran
rapidly toward the source of that sound. "Where are you?" He
lighted another match, throwing its first bright flare out from
him against the suddenly rising figure of a girl in a gray dress.
She had been lying on the ground, motionless and still through
all this, controlled by some sort of caution that had kept her
from speaking until the last moment. She had a round, dark face.
Her black hair showed the streaking of dust. Her lips were tight
together but, in that last sputter of matchlight, he saw no fear
visible. He walked on through the dropping blackness and caught
her arm.</p>

<p>"That Mexican said nothing of a woman in this wagon."</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>"Were you in the wagon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did you escape the Indians?"</p>

<p>She said: "I crawled out and ran." Her voice had no lift, no
excitement in it; it was passive, completely indifferent, He held
her arm, returning across the gravel. She didn't seem to need his
help, walking as surely as he could walk. He said: "I'll take a
horse from one of the men staying behind." McSween said, "Noreen,
your horse." Then Noreen came up with his mount and stood by. The
girl moved away from Benteen and before he could assist her she
was in the saddle, her voice coming calmly to him. "I can
manage."</p>

<p>Benteen mounted and turned back through the canyon. The rest
of the detail silently followed.</p>

<p>She was beside him. She bent until he felt her arm touch his
shoulder; and her voice was a faint stage above a whisper, her
words carrying only to him. "There was $3000 in gold in that
wagon, Lieutenant. They got it."</p>

<p>"Antone?"</p>

<p>Her arm dropped from his shoulder; she didn't answer.</p>

<p><br> <br> Beyond sunup Eleanor Warren stood in the doorway of
commanding officer's house and watched the detail come across the
bed of Aravaipa creek. Men gathered from the four corners of the
post and Major Warren, emerging from the house, said, "Godfrey's
bells, a woman!" The detail halted, Benteen left his saddle and
gave the woman an arm to the ground. She stood a moment in the
powerful sunlight, looking around the quadrangle with a calm
indifference&mdash;and afterwards put her attention on Benteen,
She was around twenty-five, Eleanor judged, with a strong body
showing through the tight dress material and a smooth, dark skin
and deep black hair pulled severely away from a middle part. It
was her eyes that attracted Eleanor's attention. They were
shadowed and obscure and reserved&mdash;as if the hardness of the
land lay in them and would let nothing through. But she kept
watching Benteen, this robust girl with the dust-stained dress;
and Eleanor; sharp in her observations, witnessed the way Benteen
looked at her and found her interesting.</p>

<p>Benteen said to Warren: "One man&mdash;a Mexican&mdash;is
dead, sir. The others got away. The wagons were burned and the
mules killed. I found this lady. I left a detail there."</p>

<p>Warren spoke to Howell Ford. "Take an ambulance and six men
out there, Mr. Ford."</p>

<p>Benteen brought the girl to the ramada, He sara to her, "I do
not know your name."</p>

<p>She seemed to think about the question a moment; and
afterwards shrugged, as though it didn't matter. "Lily Marr."</p>

<p>"This is Miss Warren. This is Major Warren."</p>

<p>Eleanor took the girl's arm and led her into the commanding
officer's quarters, Warren and Benteen following. There was a
difference between the two women&mdash;the difference of poise,
of this Lily Marr's close-mouthed silence against Eleanor
Warren's light and pleasant voice.</p>

<p>"You will want to clean up and rest. Probably you're starved.
Was it very terrible?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lily Marr. "It wasn't that bad. Nothing's bad, if
you don't think about it."</p>

<p>"How can you help thinking about it?" said Eleanor Warren in
an astonished voice.</p>

<p>The girl considered Eleanor, her eyes watchful, her expression
still reserved. "You can help anything."</p>

<p>Benteen said: "The Mexican who brought in the alarm last night
didn't mention a woman being in the wagon."</p>

<p>Lily Marr lifted her shoulders and let them fall. "He didn't
know I was on it. Nobody knew, except Summerton. I crawled into
the wagon at Tucson and hid underneath the tarpaulin, Summerton
thought it safer, When the attack came it was pretty dark. The
men walked out into the night, keeping up their fire. That gave
me a chance to run. It didn't last long."</p>

<p>Major Warren said: "How did you happen to be along?"</p>

<p>The girl, as before, considered the question over a
considerable interval. Her answer was dry and brief. "I was going
to Summerton's ranch to be cook and housekeeper."</p>

<p>Eleanor Warren said: "Don't answer any more questions, Lily.
These men are too curious. I shall get Cowen to make up breakfast
for you." She went into the kitchen. Major Warren walked out of
the room, saying: "Meet me at the office, Mr. Benteen."</p>

<p>Benteen put his back against the casing of the dobe's door.
His head was dropped and his eyes held this girl's face with a
considering attention. She stood in the middle of the room,
meeting his glance. Her lips faintly parted and some of her
gravity gently went away; suddenly she came over to him and
looked up with a warm expression in her eyes. "Lieutenant," she
murmured, "could I stay here awhile?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Was it Antone, last night?"</p>

<p>She let him wait for his answer, until Eleanor's returning
steps sounded beyond the kitchen door. Then she came quite near
him, her voice dropped: "It wasn't Antone. It wasn't Indians.
Indians don't care anything for gold."</p>

<p>Coming into the room, Eleanor Warren saw them this close
together, with the girl's head tipped up and an expression on her
face easy to define. Benteen drawled, "Thanks," and left the
room, ducking his head to avoid the top of the doorway.</p>

<p>He found Major Warren and the other officers gathered at post
headquarters. Manuel Dura and Al Hazel, two of the post guides,
were in the room. Al Hazel squatted on the floor, drawing a quick
map across the rammed earth with the point of a stick. He was a
middle-aged man with a heavy clipped beard and a pair of eyes,
never fully opened, that went restlessly from point to point. He
wore a faded black serge suit, a loose vest and a narrow-brimmed
black hat; and he had a reputation as the best scout in
Arizona.</p>

<p>"You go up the creek to here. Pools of water standin' in the
rocks and some grass for horses, You go north by a little west,
between the Pinals and the White Mountains, cross the Salt here
and make a dead point on the Sierra Anchas. That's Antone's
favorite country."</p>

<p>Benteen settled on his heels and watched the map grow. Phil
Castleton said: "Antone was in the Pinals night before last. How
could he get from there to Summerton's wagons so fast? My belief
is that if we follow his tracks away from those wagons we'll
discover him back in the Galiuros now."</p>

<p>The group let that remark go unanswered for the moment. Al
Hazel lifted his head and gave Castleton a blank, polite survey.
"It may be," he said softly. "And it may not be. An Injun's
tracks don't mean nothin'. Where he was don't mean nothin' and
where he will be don't mean nothin'. Only one thing means
anythin' regardin' Apaches&mdash;which is where he is when you
see him."</p>

<p>"Those tracks lead somewhere," insisted Castleton.</p>

<p>Al Hazel said: "I never got to the end of a breeze by
followin' it, and I never caught an Apache by chasin' his tracks
back from the spot he made his raid."</p>

<p>"Well, then," suggested Castleton, in somewhat of a temper,
"how do you find them?"</p>

<p>Hazel rose from his haunches. He reached for his knife and
plug tobacco and sheared off a comfortable chew. The snap of the
knife blade, when he closed it, was sharp in the silence. "Maybe
I talk too much," he snggested with a smoothness that fooled
nobody. "Guess I better just listen." But his dislike for
Castleton's question was apparent.</p>

<p>Captain Harrison said: "It might have been some of the
Chiricahuas up from the South, not Antone."</p>

<p>"Possibly," agreed Major Warren. "But the fact remains that
Antone's the source of most of these raids and the cause of most
Apache disaffection in this district. I conceive it my duty to
bring him in, or kill him off. When that is done I think the job
of pacifying the rest of the tribes hereabouts will be a good
deal easier. Nachee can command most of his people and could
command more if it were not for Antone's renegade bunch."</p>

<p>Castleton said: "Permit me to say, sir, I do not trust these
so-called peaceful Indians around the post. Nachee is an Apache
and all Apaches are born to deception."</p>

<p>Benteen drawled from his squatted position on the floor.
"Don't agree."</p>

<p>Castleton's voice jumped at Benteen. "Then how is it that
whenever we take a detail out on the heels of Antone the news of
it seems to spread before us? We never find Antone. His camps are
always deserted when we come up. It is my belief that Nachee
watches our details leave the post and immediately sends runners
out to warn Antone."</p>

<p>"What would you do then?" asked Major Warren.</p>

<p>"A harsher remedy," said Castleton. "I should bundle up Nachee
and his people and put them in a stockade, or move them
completely away from this post. I should treat any Indian who
shows himself around this post as a hostile. Bullet for
bullet&mdash;trick for trick."</p>

<p>Major Warren touched the white ends of his mustache carefully.
"In the last three years seventy-five pecple, more or less, have
been killed by Apaches in this section of Arizona. Most of the
cattle stock has been butchered, practically all of the ranches
have been attacked and burned. There is no safe road in this
quarter of the Territory. A man setting out alone from Tucson has
no prospect at all of arriving here alive. Two weeks ago a herder
was killed within sound of the Tucson church bells. The mines are
deserted. For all purposes it is worse than during Mexican
occupation."</p>

<p>"Just two ranches left in the whole length of the San Pedro,"
said Harrison.</p>

<p>"So far," continued Warren, "I have sent you gentlemen out on
scout primarily to learn the country and break in the men to the
kind of campaigning necessary. I propose now to set to work. We
shall throw details after Antone steadily, keeping him on the
move, breaking up his rancherias, pushing him out of his choice
camp spots. I want him pushed so hard that he'll have no time to
stop to bake mescal, no time to rest up. I expect we shall take
our losses but I also expect we shall learn the game as the
Apache plays it. We cannot hope to move as lightly or as fast as
he does; but we can hope to maneuver him eventually into a bad
position, and then close in. I hope somehow, during this time, to
capture some of his people and gain information that will betray
him. One other thing. When we set traps we must also expect to
have traps set for us. That is the constant danger. We are
dealing with the craftiest fighters in the world. These are the
things I want you all to remember. So far this has been a
schooling period. The men are toughened up, our horses are in
good shape. Now we shall go to work."</p>

<p>Castleton stepped from the corner of the room. He said in his
quick, suppressed voice: "Major, I should like permission to take
a detail out on the trail from the Summerton wagons."</p>

<p>"Your turn will come," said Warren. "Mr. Benteen, take out a
detail of twenty men with rations for three days. Hazel goes with
you. You are to cut Antone's trail and follow."</p>

<p>Benteen said: "If the major will let me, I'd like to let that
trail go and try another. I learned something of Antone's habits
on the last chase."</p>

<p>Major Warren studied Benteen through a considerable silence
and afterwards put his glance on Al Hazel. He was a round, ruddy
and easy-going man, this Warren, and deceivingly smart in his
judgment of other men. Now, considering Hazel and Benteen, he
formed his conclusions largely from Hazel's attitude toward
Benteen. The civilian scout gave Benteen a full and grave
attention. It was an interest that the guide, with his slight
intolerance toward young officers, had not bothered to show
Castleton.</p>

<p>Benteen added: "I don't believe the trail of last night's
raiding party will lead toward Antone."</p>

<p>Al Hazel's eyes, never fully open, showed a narrower light.
"In that, Lieutenant, I'd guess you was right."</p>

<p>Castleton spoke at once. "Maybe you have additional
information, Benteen."</p>

<p>"Ain't always that," put in Al Hazel shrewdly. "Some men get
so's they smell the right and the wrong of Indian sign."</p>

<p>"You have my permission;" decided Warren. "What is your
plan?"</p>

<p>"Up Aravaipa Creek and over to the Gila, circling the Mescals.
If Antone has gone into those hills we should cut his sign. I
should also like to start tonight, well after dark."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Major Warren, and left the room.</p>

<p>Benteen walked out with Al Hazel. Al Hazel pushed his hat well
forward to shield his eyes from the bitter flash of the sun; his
jaws worked gently on the cud of chewing tobacco and his close-
shuttered eyes watched the smoky distance of the San Pedro.
"Lieutenant, whut was that woman's name you picked up?"</p>

<p>"Lily Marr."</p>

<p>"Just so," murmured Al Hazel, and sauntered off, hands deep in
the front pockets of his serge pants.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<p class="first">SUNLIGHT burned against the earth, catching up
the thin and bitter flashes of mica particles in the soil, and
heat dropped over the post, layer on layer until it was a
substance that sluggishly stirred when the weight of a body was
put against it. The flag hung lifeless against its pole; the
sprinkling cart traversed the parade, damping the dust and
leaving its steamy smell behind. A few Indians came from the camp
outside the post and crouched in the false shade of the
commissary building. Al Hazel's wife crossed the parade for the
Major's washing, her olive Mexican cheeks smothered in a dead
white flour paste. Lily Marr slept in an exhausted sleep in
Eleanor Warren's bed. Drill call brought two skeleton troops, I
and K, to the parade where Captain Harrison, his cheeks turned a
lobster-red by the sun, drilled them briefly.</p>

<p>At noon Lieutenant George Mixler brought his detail down
Aravaipa Creek and reported. He was a heavy young man whose
naturally cheerful face was overcast by worry; after he had
welcomed Eleanor he went straight toward his own dobe quarters.
From her position under the ramada of the commanding officer's
house, Eleanor heard him speak to Harriet, and heard Harriet's
voice rise unreasonably and dissolve into crying.</p>

<p>The day droned on, the terrific summer's heat pressing down on
a parade bare of life. Eleanor soaked her hands and face in tepid
water and, unquenchably curious in spite of the weather, followed
the walk around the quadrangle, past headquarters, post bakery,
guardhouse and sutler's store&mdash;and down along the line of
men's barracks. Back of the commissary she saw troopers beneath
the open shed of the blacksmith shop. Tom Benteen, stripped to
his waist, had the hind foot of a horse between his legs, fitting
a shoe. When she came nearer she heard him explaining to the
troopers; and she paused to hear him explain. "Set it up tight,
make your clinch clean. We'll take a few extra shoes along. I
want no crippled horses on the trip."</p>

<p>Sweat streamed down his skin, it rolled out of his sandy hair,
down across the flat of his cheeks. Troopers led their horses
from the stables and back again, Benteen standing by. "This one
will blow his tendons ten miles out. Pull a fresh mount from the
corral, Levi. That's about all. Check your cinches and buckles.
If you've got any bad saddle blankets, go to the quartermaster.
Fill your canteens after supper. You'll get rations then. Twenty
rounds extra for carbines and ten for revolvers."</p>

<p>When he came around she saw the pull of heat on his face. He
took his shirt from the ground and put it on; he came forward,
removing his hat; and there was, again, the nearness of a smile
behind his eyes, and the same strong curiosity.</p>

<p>She said: "Come along. We've got some Sonora lemons."</p>

<p>The skin below the open roll of his shirt collar was quite
dark; his hands were long and broad against heavy wrists. His
trouser belt was cinched against a typical cavalryman's small
flanks and the yellow stripe on the trousers made him seem
longer-legged than was actually so. She wanted him to talk,
curious as to the way he might break the strangeness between
them, but he had a kind of indifference that covered him. All he
said just then was a matter-of-fact, "It is a damned kind
thought," and that oath was as natural and inoffensive as
anything could be. Once, in turning across the parade her foot,
turned on a slick-sided piece of gravel; his arm pulled her up at
once and then, looking up to him she saw how alive was the
interest of his powder-gray eyes.</p>

<p>He followed her into the dobe's kitchen, and went back to the
porch basin to wash up while she ground the lemons and pulverized
the coarse sugar lumps. He brought in the ollas hanging to the
porch rafters and poured the tepid water into the glasses. He sat
on the edge of table, lifting his glass to her. "To you;" he
said, and drank with the lusty, audible relish of a thirsty
man.</p>

<p>"It would be good to have some ice," she said.</p>

<p>"The trick of getting along in this weather," he told her, "is
to let nothing bother you. Watch the Indians, or the Mexicans.
They bend but they never break. Sleep when it is time to sleep
and work when it is time to work. They're admirable people and
they know something most Americans don't, which is how to get fun
out of living."</p>

<p>He was thoroughly relaxed, his muscles loose, his legs
sprawled. There was no strain in him, no haste or worry. She
said: "That's the way you are, but you didn't learn it from the
Mexicans. You were born that way."</p>

<p>"Eleanor," he said, "you're a smart girl."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I was raised among men."</p>

<p>She refilled his glass and sat in a corner chair, more and
more interested in him. The room held a deep shade and no sound
stirred the post. Even in the half-light her auburn hair held a
shine. Her long lips were gently set, showing gravity, showing
will; Her shoulders were square and definite against the chair's
back; they were strong. In the lengthening silence she was aware
of his continuing, careful attention. In many ways he was an odd
man, sharper with his eyes than other men, more attentive to
details than other men. There was deception to him&mdash;the
deception of a swift mind lying behind seeming indifference. She
had lived in the army long enough to know that in all men there
was a liberal streak of vanity and false pride, making them easy
targets for flattery; these things were in Benteen, because he
was a man, yet she was rather sure that it would be harder to
reach him through flattery, because of the irony in his
eyes&mdash;an irony that controlled his judgments of himself as
well as of other people. It was a definite impression she
had.</p>

<p>She spoke on impulse. "Tom, would you do me a favor? Next time
you play poker, please ask Phil to join you."</p>

<p>It was always dangerous to interfere with the likes and
dislikes of men, yet she had a feeling that between herself and
Benteen was a quick understanding. In some ways they were the
same kind of people, both able to stand apart and watch the world
run by. She felt this about him. He had lowered his head. His
long forefinger gently rubbed the rim of the glass. He said, "Of
course," but the lack of interest in his voice told her more than
he intended.</p>

<p>She said: "What is it?"</p>

<p>He raised his head. "What?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Nothing. It would have been a foolish
question."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Useless, maybe. But not foolish. Some
questions have no good answers. That's one of them." He stood up
and came on until she saw the flaky grayness of his eyes and the
entire gravity in them. Inside him, deep away, some change
occurred, swift and violent enough for her to feel that wash of
its force. She realized that he was trying to tell her something
in his own reticent way. "You can change the color of your dress,
or the way you do your hair. You cannot change the kind of a
woman you are and you can't change a man into something you want
him to be. Don't try, Eleanor."</p>

<p>She murmured: "How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"I tried it once."</p>

<p>"You sound very old," she observed; and her woman's curiosity
grew greater and greater.</p>

<p>He could smile. It was a long, sound smile that showed the
white surfaces of his teeth. "I got into the first battle of Bull
Run at fifteen and went clear through to Appomattox. Two things
bring a man along pretty fast, if he's the kind to learn at
all&mdash;war and women."</p>

<p>She was a practical girl who had seen too many soldiers not to
know them. So she said: "When was the first woman, Tom?"</p>

<p>"The first and last," he corrected. "At twenty-one. She was an
unreconstructed rebel in New Orleans. If you ever go into the
deep South. Eleanor, never let the magnolias and the summer
twilight fool you."</p>

<p>She had an instant guess. "That's why you transferred, isn't
it? To get away from her. Is she married now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I think," said Eleanor, carefully watching him, "she
regretted that as much as you still do. It would be like a
woman."</p>

<p>He said: "Do I show any regret?"</p>

<p>Phil Castleton's voice crossed from the front doorway.
"Eleanor." He came on to the kitchen. The sight of Benteen
brought him up and he stood with his shoulders pulled
straight&mdash;a betraying expression on his face; and at once
the room was too small for these two big men. Of Castleton's
resenting dislike there was no question at all, but though
Eleanor watched Benteen with a genuine concern, she could make
out no visible reaction.</p>

<p>She broke the difficult silence by pouring Castleton a glass
of lemonade. "Warm, but wet, Phil."</p>

<p>He took the glass and said, "Thanks," but didn't immediately
drink. His manner was pretty clear; he wanted Benteen out of the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Benteen said: "Where's that girl?"</p>

<p>"Sleeping," Eleanor answered. "Did you want to see her?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," put in Castleton, "she could add something to what
she told you last night."</p>

<p>"What would that be?" inquired Benteen, soft and idle.</p>

<p>Castleton said briefly: "She did her whispering to you, not to
me. My observation is you have good luck with stray characters
and broken-down Indians."</p>

<p>Benteen swung around, facing Castleton; and this hot room held
storm and trouble. Benteen said: "The term stray character
scarcely applies to the lady, Mr. Castleton."</p>

<p>Castleton colored. His brief laugh concealed nothing of the
swift anger in him. "I do not know her. Pending better knowledge
I withdraw the remark."</p>

<p>Benteen looked at Eleanor. "Thanks for the drink," he said and
left the room.</p>

<p>Castleton said: "If this is your day for open house, Eleanor,
shouldn't you invite more than one man?"</p>

<p>She spoke gently. "That's a foolish remark, Phil."</p>

<p>"A man in love is apt to be a fool," he said and lifted his
glass. He was smiling again. "To you." But his eyes, above the
rim of the glass, were round and hot with real anger.</p>

<p><br> <br> Sergeant McSween called: "The detail will leave at
tattoo and ye'd better be takin' some rest meanwhile. The
lieutenant Benteen is a man that likes to march."</p>

<p>Sunlight glowed through the drawn burlap curtains of the
barrack room, In this hot semi-dark the men of the K and I troops
took their siestas on the close-placed cots, Harry Jackson lay
shirtless against the straw ticking and felt sweat accumulate
beneath him. On the wall at the foot of the bed hung his saber,
blouse and forage cap. A bright sliver of light struck in at the
corner of the window curtain. Just above the window, in a crevice
of the dobe wall, a tarantula hung in a motionless fur-black
ball, half as large as Harry Jackson's fist.</p>

<p>Voices rolled idly and fatiguedly through the half-gloom. From
the corner of his eye, Harry Jackson saw van Rhyn seated like a
tailor on his bed, bending over a book. Van Rhyn was an older
man, close to forty, with a long, shrunken face and a bony frame
that no amount of food could fill. Like the rest of the crowd he
was stripped to the waist. A small gold locket and chain swung
against his flat chest. Van Rhyn was a peculiar man who always
kept his finger nails clean and his boots shined and sometimes he
used words that none of the rest of the troopers quite
understood. It all made a mystery to young Harry Jackson who was
twenty-one.</p>

<p>The bunks of I troop ended with van Rhyn; beyond was K troop's
half of the barracks. Down there the men of K were arguing about
religion, and pleased with the knowledge it was not their turn to
go out on detail tonight. Big Mitch Canreen walked to the window,
pushing the burlap aside to squint through the barrel of his
carbine. "Anyway, boys," he said, "we'll be hopin' you sleep well
on the rocks. When you reach the Injuns bring me back a load of
baked mescal."</p>

<p>Sergeant McSween never let a man's insult go unanswered. "'Tis
the least to say we'll see Injuns. In I troop we pick no daisies
by the wayside. Did I hear any of ye talkin' about the bloody
savages ye've shot?"</p>

<p>Corporal Oldbuck answered that one. "Well, Benteen's got the
luck for that&mdash;which I will admit. Castleton ain't."</p>

<p>"Castleton," said another man. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>But McSween stopped the comment before it came. "I'll hear no
comparison as to officers."</p>

<p>Mitch Canreen spoke from the far end of I's line, "We'll take
care of your duties, boys," and laughed a long, flat laugh.</p>

<p>Young Harry Jackson lay quite still, his legs pushed beyond
the foot of his bed. His lips closed and he turned the palms of
his hands over, pushing them against the bed. His heart quickened
its beating; his throat dryly clacked when he swallowed.</p>

<p>McSween shot back his question: "Whut would ye mean by
that?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' for you, Sarge," called Canreen. "But maybe another
one of your lads will know." He was laughing again. Head half
turned, Harry Jackson watched Canreen stroll forward. Canreen was
a heavy, wicked Irishman; even in the half-light Harry Jackson
saw the blackness of the man's eyebrows and the solid roll of his
lips. Canreen was a bruiser and had had his brutal fights; it
showed on the scars of his face.</p>

<p>"If it meant anything to me," said McSween tartly, "I'd clip
your ears."</p>

<p>"Sure, Sarge, but you wouldn't know anything about love,
hey?"</p>

<p>The drowsy talk fell away and Harry Jackson, flat on his bed
tick, knew why. Even in this stifling heat a coolness rolled down
his arms and the pit of his stomach tightened on emptiness and he
felt an old, sick fear. McSween rolled around in his bunk and his
words came out softly for Harry Jackson alone. "Ye'd better try
to lick him now, son, or he'll make the rest of your hitch a hell
of a wan. There's no livin' with the ape if he believes he's got
ye scared."</p>

<p>Canreen came on toward the I troop side. He stopped by the
window and turned, the ball-shaped tarantula hovering one foot
above his black head. His mouth kept changing, it kept loosening
and tightening; he had small eyes deep in his head. Both hands
were behind him. He said: "Canreen will take care of it. The old
soldier will show I troop rookies, hey?" He was at the foot of
Harry Jackson's bed. He turned half away and brought his arms to
the front, swinging a broomstick across the bottom of Jackson's
boots. The sound flattened against the dead air and hot pain shot
up Jackson's legs and made him roll from the bed. Canreen's
laughter went wildly along the room, but when Harry Jackson came
down the length of the bed and faced him, he saw the glitter of
evil in Canreen's eyes. Young Harry Jackson stood with his
blistered feet apart, his arms idle and as loose as water. There
was no strength in him at all.</p>

<p>Canreen said: "She'll never miss you; Harry. I'll spend a
night there myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was still afraid, this young Harry Jackson; deadly afraid
of the beating he was certain to take. But Canreen had spoken a
thing that turned Harry Jackson inside out, and the fear was less
terrible because of it. Jackson pulled up his head, knowing he
could never whip that heavy brute of a man, and then saw his
saber hanging by the window. He flung out his arm, seized the
saber's hilt and pulled it free of its scabbard and made one
wild, outward slash that grazed the surface of Canreen's chest,
leaving a faint red track there.</p>

<p>Canreen yelled at the top of his voice. "Hey&mdash;!" and
dodged backward. Men sprang up from the cots. McSween called:
"None of that, boy! None of that!" Harry Jackson didn't hear it.
The fear and the jealousy in him was a flame that burned at his
lungs. Canreen paced backward, momentarily out of range of the
swinging saber; he let go with his hard cursing, and turned and
seized van Rhyn's saber from the wall. Suddenly all the men in
this barracks were crying in full throat. "All right,
boy&mdash;all right&mdash;lick the hell out of him! Knock him
down!"</p>

<p>McSween shouted, "Stop that&mdash;ye want somebody to hang for
murder!"</p>

<p>Canreen stopped and waited, his shoulders drawn together and
his round, cropped head lowered. Young Harry Jackson, turned
still and half-blind, saw the red gleam in Canreen's eyes and the
meaty roll of Canreen's lips. Van Rhyn's whisper came to him.</p>

<p>"Finish what you start, Harry."</p>

<p>It was this soft phrase which drove young Harry Jackson
forward so precipitately that Canreen was caught off guard. The
point of Jackson's saber caught and drove down Canreen's weapon.
Canreen jumped back and brought his saber forward; when it struck
the hilt of Jackson's saber a solid spasm rushed up Jackson's
arm, as though it had been broken. All Harry Jackson saw was the
shape of Canreen's round head and the dim blur of Canreen's bare
chest; everything else was gray and formless and the cry of
voices was only a confused tone. He rushed on, striking at
Canreen in lunging, crosswise, full-armed slashes. Canreen
yelled, "Hey!" and gave ground, and the sound of steel on steel
went clanging through the barracks. Young Harry Jackson saw the
point of Canreen's blade streak past his eyes and felt wetness
suddenly along his lips. He heard his own breathing come deep and
croupy from his lungs; he kept pushing on, wanting to kill
Canreen, trying to kill Canreen. He saw Canreen's saber go
crosswise and, sweeping in, he hit Canreen with the flat of his
blade on the side of the face. Canreen dropped, knees and hips
and shoulders collapsing at once; he lay on the floor and rolled
from side to side, raising his boots to shield his stomach. Young
Harry Jackson beat Canreen across the knees, hearing Canreen cry,
and afterwards he was caught from behind and dragged back and
flung completely around, across one of the beds. McSween seized
the saber. McSween was saying in a calm voice, "It is enough,
lad."</p>

<p>Somebody yelled: "Attention!"</p>

<p>Silence came to the room. McSween reached down to the cot and
dragged Harry Jackson to his feet as Lieutenant Benteen swung
into the barracks. "McSween," he said, "what's this?"</p>

<p>McSween's voice was even and polite&mdash;the voice of the old
soldier turned smart by years of service. "A bit of an accident,
sor. Canreen tripped on his saber, and it batted him across the
head, strange-like. An odd accident, sor. I nivver saw the like
of it before."</p>

<p>Young Harry Jackson backed against the rear wall of the
barrack room so that he might have its support for his quivering
legs. The heat was about to suffocate him. He could not drag in
enough air and the sound of his gasping effort told Benteen the
whole story. Benteen saw the boy's red-purple face and spoke
quickly. "Lie down. Van Rhyn, get a bucket of water. Hurry it
up&mdash;the boy's about to have a heat stroke. Did he trip on
his saber too, McSween?"</p>

<p>"He was runnin' in the sun, sor. I've warned him many a time
against it."</p>

<p>Canreen pulled himself from the floor. He put both arms
against the wall and dropped his head against them, Blood dripped
steadily from his nose. McSween pushed Harry Jackson to the bed
and van Rhyn came back with a bucket of water. Nothing was said.
Benteen watched Canreen a moment, and turned, his attention to
Jackson. Jackson's heart moved the skin of his chest; its
straining labor was loud enough for Benteen to hear. McSween
murmured: "Would the lieutenant be wantin' somethin'?"</p>

<p>He met Benteen's eyes, his own leather countenance gravely
wise; these two men understood each other and played the game
according to the rules. Benteen said: "You had better put
Canreen's saber somewhere out of reach, McSween," and left the
barracks.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hanna came from the shadows at the end of the room.
"Canreen, get the hell back to your bunk, If it had been
Castleton ye'd be walkin' post for a month."</p>

<p>Young Harry Jackson lay flat on his bed, feeling the warm
wetness of the water van Rhyn slowly poured over him. Van Rhyn's
face was a blur in a mealy grayness that surrounded everything.
He kept reaching deeper for wind, feeling starved and choked for
want of it, feeling the rack of his heart, His knees shook and
all his muscles were trembling. McSween's face vaguely appeared.
Van Rhyn's face dropped near and he saw the older man's reserved,
odd eyes pretty clearly.</p>

<p>"Good boy. Never run from anything, or you'll be running all
your life. Better be dead than that, I'm telling you, son. I
know."</p>

<p>But Harry Jackson, in the strange dimness of his mind, was
thinking: "I've got to watch out for Canreen, He'll try to kill
me."</p>

<p><br> <br> The ambulance detail returned near three o'clock
with the dead Mexican. At five Major Warren stood over the grave
in the post cemetery and spoke the brief funeral service
beginning, "Man that is born of woman," under the day's last
burning sunlight. There was no further ceremony. The officers and
small funeral detail turned back to the parade, Lily Marr and
Eleanor Warren accompanying them. Mess call sounded in the first
blue shadows of evening; then suddenly and completely, full dark
fell across the mountains, across the narrow valley of the San
Pedro, and once again the outline of the Santa Catalinas was a
black ragged-edged mass against the glittering shine of the high
stars. A new moon, tipped over on one of its horns, made a
lightless arc of the low horizon. Heat pulsed along the earth,
thick-scented with dust and sage.</p>

<p>McSween called through the thin lamplight of the barracks: "We
pull out at tattoo." Standing in the dense shadows by the corral
walls, Harry Jackson heard the echo of the sergeant's voice, and
the clatter of the eight o'clock guard relief coming up to number
five post near the edge of Aravaipa Creek. The relief stopped.
Number five's Irish brogue cut the stillness: "Halt&mdash;who's
there?"</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard."</p>

<p>"Advance, cawprul of the guard, with the countersign."</p>

<p>This was the moment, while the guard stood at the far end of
his beat, that Harry Jackson circled the corral, slipped into the
dry creek bed and crossed it, thus putting himself beyond the
lines. For a moment he lay belly-flat on the rough sand-and-
gravel soil, one hand touching the butt of his revolver as he
stared into the muddy dark surrounding him, The lights of the
post sparkled behind. The small fire of Nachee's peaceful Indian
camp made a round glow half a mile away. To the right of that
fire, and another half mile onward, the light of Valley Ranch
broke the black. These lights meant nothing, for it was a habit
of Antone's band to creep singly down from the hills and lie in
ambush at the very edge of the post with lance and arrow. Knowing
this, Harry Jackson nevertheless took the risk; pushed to it by
his desire. Rising, he went forward at a quiet walk until the
sound of his boots could not carry back to the guard; thereafter
he broke into a trot, every muscle of his body strained and stiff
from the afternoon's fight. Fifteen minutes later, well-winded,
he drew up at the first of the little scatter of dobe houses
forming the Valley Ranch, and knocked on a latched door.</p>

<p>There was a delay and, to Harry Jackson's attentive ears, the
scrape of more than one set of feet; then the door opened and he
passed quickly in and faced Rose Smith.</p>

<p>The smell of tobacco smoke in the room revived the torment of
his jealous fears. He didn't look at her for a moment. He stood
with his shoulder point swung away, staring at the opposite
wall&mdash;a tall, slender boy whose face was still clear, still
unmarked by the roughness of life. He had deep blue eyes and the
gawkiness and the sober intensity of youth wrote its mark on him
completely. He said: "If you ain't alone I'll get on
back&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said at once: "Just my uncle. He left a minute ago."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, flat and relieved. "Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was a dark, compact girl, full at hip and breast, with red
lips that stirred at sight of him. She was older than Harry
Jackson, though this he never knew. Older in years and older in
her eyes. Looking at him, her face showed a softening, a puzzled
change, as though she didn't quite understand him. She touched
his arm, letting her hand lie there. "Maybe you'll sit down."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I got to get back. I leave with the scout
detail after tattoo. Just came to see how you were."</p>

<p>"Why, all right, Harry."</p>

<p>"I just wanted to know," he said slowly.</p>

<p>She said: "I'll think of you, Harry."</p>

<p>"Lord," he said, "that's what I do all the time. It is hell to
pull out and think of you here. I wish you were in Tucson, or in
the post. And it is tough to think my outfit might leave Arizona
any time. I think of that a lot of times. I've got a year to go
on my enlistment. Where'll you be next year, Rose?"</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "here, I expect. I don't know."</p>

<p>He said: "You shouldn't be near an army post, or near
soldiers."</p>

<p>"You're a soldier, Harry."</p>

<p>"You know what I mean&mdash;the kind I mean."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know."</p>

<p>He said, "Well, I've got to get back," and pulled himself
straight before her. She let her hand drop from his arm and
remained before him with her lips soft and with a small, formless
smile. She had a pliability, a waiting silence, a smoky-eyed
expectancy. But this he didn't see. What he saw was a picture
built from the eagerness and the hunger and dreaming of a boy,
all fair and all pure. He held his hat, his feelings strong and
severe in his eyes. He said, quite formally, "I will see you
soon," and opened the door and pulled it shut.</p>

<p>The girl put her arm against the door, listening to the fading
run of his boots. Afterwards, when silence had quite come, the
rear door opened and Mitch Canreen stepped in. "Who was it,
Rose?"</p>

<p>Her shoulders rose and fell for answer. Canreen laughed, his
scarred lips pulling apart, and settled down in a chair loosely.
"Sure," he said, "sure. The kid. He don't know much, Rose. Come
here."</p>

<p>But she stood by the door a long while, strangeness still on
her face&mdash;the strangeness of the thought young Harry Jackson
had left behind him. Presently she sighed and her expressive
shoulders lifted and fell, as though it were something that had
to be put aside, and moved across the room.</p>

<p><br> <br> Tattoo ran the parade in strong, slow notes, sinking
into the velvet-layered mystery of this night. Equipped for field
duty, twenty men of I troop stood by their horses on the parade,
a long blur in the blackness. Sergeant McSween's voice struck its
grumbling command into the silence and other voices snapped back
at him, counting off. Standing at the edge of the parade, Eleanor
watched Benteen and Howell Ford cross the shadows and appear
before the other officers grouped with Major Warren. They always
went through this, shaking hands and exchanging best wishes. But
Phil Castleton was in the background, aloof and silent. Major
Warren said:</p>

<p>"I wish you to remember, Mr. Benteen, that your judgment
always must prevail in the field. You are to catch Antone if that
is possible, to keep him moving if you cannot catch him. Should
you come upon him, be sure to estimate your chances carefully.
Make a fight under any decent odds. If you must lose men to break
up Antone's power, then do it. But under no circumstances should
you waste a life foolishly. That temptation will be constantly
before you. Antone will see to that. I have a great regard for
the troopers in this command. They're the finest soldiers on
earth and they're in your hands. Be sure you give them proper
leadership. I wish you good luck."</p>

<p>Benteen's voice was slow and cool. He said, "Yes sir," and
moved on until he stood before Eleanor Warren, tall-shaped
against the night. She said, "Good luck," and took his hand.
Afterwards he wheeled away with Howell Ford.</p>

<p>Sergeant McSween's solemn voice cross the parade. "Detail
formed, sor."</p>

<p>"Prepare to mount. Mount!"</p>

<p>There was the smash of twenty bodies hitting leather, the
grunt of horses and the clank of carbines and canteens and belted
trenching tools.</p>

<p>"Right by twos, harch!"</p>

<p>The line moved, gray and indistinct; saddle leather made a
little song against the ruffled beat of the walking horses.
Eleanor went along the edge of the parade, as far as the end of
officers' row, following that column as it passed the guardhouse
and the breaking corral and blended with the shadows lying over
the San Pedro. Standing there, she listened to the slow fade of
sound. Right of her, through the open door of the adjacent
sutler's store she saw Cowen's stiff shape against the light.
Half a dozen troopers sat before him and Cowen's voice was dryly
addressing them. "I wish now to read the letter of a man in
Switzerland who went down into the horrors of drink and took the
pledge. 'Dear sir and esteemed friend&mdash;'" This was as it had
been in Stanton. Cowen had organized his Soldiers' Temperance
Union. At last all sound of Benteen's detail died beyond the San
Pedro and only the dogged rumble of Cowen's voice and the lower
murmur of dispersing officers remained.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p class="first">BENTEEN led the detail up the dry bed of
Aravaipa Creek, soon passing from level country into the shallow
mouth of a canyon, and thus onward through the black tangle of
ridge and ravine and rising mountain shoulders. Near midnight
they struck water and paused for a long rest, all the troopers
settling against the stony soil. Lying full length, one arm
propped against his head, Benteen listened to the wild chant of a
coyote on a nearby ridge. The taciturn murmuring of the men
reached him and the shift of the horses on the gravel and the
crunch of their teeth on the iron bits. A small wind drifted from
the upper country; the smell of damp horsehide and sweated
leather was quite strong. High in the blackest heavens he had
even seen a falling star make a brief, dissolving scratch against
infinity. Howell Ford sat by, saying nothing. Al Hazel settled
near Benteen.</p>

<p>"We turn out of this canyon in a mile. This is the main Injun
trail. You headin' for the Gila?"</p>

<p>"Al," said Benteen, "I'm hunting small game tonight. Nachee
told me this afternoon that some of Antone's people usually come
back to a little rancheria on top of a peak this side of Saddle
Mountain. We'll have a look."</p>

<p>Al Hazel relieved himself of his tobacco chew with a sharp
"pfwutt." He ground his boots in the gravel. "It ain't a bad
guess. Fer a young man you ain't been long learnin' Injun ways.
Whut kills white men in this country is gettin' reckless. An
Injun's got all the time in the world. His belly's his clock and
any mescal bush or mesquite clump gives him food. Home's where he
lights his fire and he'll travel farther in one day, with nothin'
to tote, than this detail could march in a week."</p>

<p>"McSween," said Benteen quietly, and rose to his horse.</p>

<p>The detail turned north from Aravaipa Creek and suddenly was
lost in velvet sweeps of land that joined each other at crooked,
tricky angles. Al Hazel, who knew this country better than he
knew his own mind, disappeared ahead. Now and then the shod hoofs
of his horse, striking rock, set up a faint flash. Eastward stood
the vague peak of Mount Turnbull. Due north, in the direction
they traveled, was the ragged silhouette of stony peaks against a
metal sky. At two o'clock Al Hazel dropped back. "Up there," he
said. "The crooked hump on the left."</p>

<p>"How far?"</p>

<p>"Hour's ride."</p>

<p>Benteen turned and murmured to the following column.</p>

<p>"No talking." They rose from one hogback to another, through
the pit-black world. This was the coolest hour of the night, a
faint wind fanning Benteen's cheek and bringing down with it the
pungency of desert growth. A horse shied violently out of the
line, evoking McSween's exasperated grumble. "Sullivan, whut the
hell?"</p>

<p>"Snake smell."</p>

<p>The mountain mass in front of them grew higher and blacker as
they approached; the land began to buckle up again, Benteen
stopped. "Hour and a half until daylight. Howell, take charge.
I'm going ahead with Hazel for a look. Sit tight. We'll be back
in thirty minutes."</p>

<p>"Would ye be takin' another man or so, Lieutenant?" suggested
McSween.</p>

<p>"Too much noise," said Benteen, leaving his horse, Thus on
foot he went forward with Hazel, skirting catclaw and nopal
clusters and mesquite bushes. They reached the shoulder-high
barrier of huge rocks fallen from the crumbling ramparts of the
peak, and began to climb over them, monkey-fashion, rock to rock,
point to point, up a forty-five degree tilt. Al Hazel grunted and
paused for breath, and in the interval Benteen listened to the
faint clack and rustle and scrape of earth life. Somewhere in
these rocks snakes denned up; he could smell them. Al Hazel put
his mouth against Benteen's ear.</p>

<p>"Two hundred yards, straight up."</p>

<p>They continued, with Benteen placing each boot on solid
support before swinging his weight to it. The stiff tilt
continued, the rocks making a kind of rough stairway, Benteen ran
his gauntleted hand against a pincushion cactus and hauled his
jaws together, suppressing a groan. Higher up he snagged his
shoulder into the drooped branch of a catclaw bush. Turned still,
he worried the sharp fishhook barbs loose. At this elevation the
air was definitely thinner. Hazel touched his shoulder for signal
and in thorough silence they climbed the last hard pitch of the
ridge. Standing almost straight, his boots on a lower boulder and
his elbows hooked over the rim of the hilltop, Benteen stared
forward and saw, for this first moment, only a kind of small
meadow recessed in the rocks and surrounding mesquite. All this
was against the paler light of the sky and though he swept the
cleared area very carefully he could not identify the marks of a
camp. But Al Hazel touched his shoulder again, and both of them
backed down the slope a good hundred feet before stopping. Hazel
whispered close to Benteen's ear.</p>

<p>"A camp. Maybe four-five-six. I ain't sure."</p>

<p>Benteen murmured: "Go back and tell Ford to bring up half the
detail. Take off belts. Too much noise. Put extra cartridges in
pockets. I'll wait here."</p>

<p>Al. Hazel faded below, making no sound at all. Benteen climbed
back to the rim, hooked his arms over it and searched the area,
trying to see what Al Hazel had seen. As far as he could
determine this mountain top clearing was narrow and not more than
a hundred feet long, with rock cairns breaking it at spots; then,
more closely observing, he discovered that one of the rock cairns
had a rounded top, which probably was a brush jacal thrown up by
the Apaches for sleeping. After that he caught horse smell, and
saw a shape stir at the clearing's far end.</p>

<p>The shadows were beginning to pale. Eastward a definite crack
of light showed along the rim of the Galiuro Mountains and from
this thousand-foot elevation Benteen watched the surrounding
mountains gradually break through the night. The San Pedro valley
showed its pale streak. Beyond that, through the gap of the Santa
Catalinas, the farther desert began to throw off a dim shine.
Below him was a sibilant heaving of breath. Al Hazel crawled
through the rocks and came beside him and afterwards Ford and
McSween reached the rim. The other troopers were halted and
silent below, waiting word.</p>

<p>Benteen murmured to McSween: "One at a time&mdash;come up and
spread."</p>

<p>McSween bent back, his whisper carrying down. Harry Jackson
heaved forward, stepping beside Benteen. Van Rhyn, weakened and
badly winded, caught Harry Jackson's sleeve. For a moment both of
them teetered on precarious balance, until Benteen's arm steadied
them. The sheet of light eastward turned into a broad violent
band and at once, so sudden was dawn on the desert, all the world
lay gray and misty and semi-visible. Turned back to the clearing,
Benteen saw the definite shape of the Apache rancheria, before
him. A brush-covered jacal occupied the middle of the clearing,
and half a dozen horses stood on picket at the far end, one
hundred yards away; near the jacal a few lumpy shapes along the
ground indicated Indians sleeping. Hazel bent against Benteen.
"Four-five bucks."</p>

<p>Benteen looked to either side, seeing the troopers crouched
against the rocks. He put his hands on the rim for a sudden jump,
motioned forward with his head, and sprang up. The deep silence
of the breathless hour was broken by the grunt and rush of the
troopers going over the rim. Benteen said in a full voice: "No
firing unless they start," and fell into a run, carrying the
skirmish line with him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lumpy shapes on the ground were whirling up and a
woman rushed out of the jacal, carrying a papoose in her arms.
One wiry buck lunged straight at Benteen, his sharp-pointed lance
thrust forward, his eyes live as coals against the copper skin.
Benteen had drawn his gun. Before he got it lifted he saw the
Indian set himself for a throw, and ducked aside as the lance
drove by him. That same moment the Indian reached for his knife
and swept it half overhead, still rushing in, Benteen's bullet
knocked him down. The scout detail raced on, full-throated. Two
more women flung themselves out of the jacal and a small boy
stood in its doorway, dead still. One of the Apaches, fleeing
away, stopped and took a snap shot with his carbine; and suddenly
McSween's gun roared. The Indian dropped. Troopers clawed the
brush away from the jacal. Harry Jackson was on the dead run,
trying to catch the woman with the papoose. Four other Indian
men, the two women, and this small boy stood silent and sullen in
the ring of troopers. This was all of the fight.</p>

<p>Al Hazel said, curtly approving, "Not a bad job,
Lieutenant."</p>

<p>The clearing, all visible now in the first sunless period of
moming, was a little below the rocky rim, marked with a few
mesquite bushes and two or three stunted pines. Benteen walked
down to the north side, meeting Harry Jackson, who said: "That
woman just sank into those rocks with the baby."</p>

<p>"Never mind. You couldn't catch her now."</p>

<p>A rough trail wound down this north side of the hill, breaking
into canyon country. Beyond this canyon the hills rolled on in
black broken crests toward higher summits. Benteen walked back to
the jacal. "Jackson, go tell Corporal Levi to bring the rest of
the detail around the north side. There's a trail for
horses."</p>

<p>The Indians crouched on the ground, impassive as stone except
for one woman who spread out her arms and began to speak swiftly
to Al Hazel. Al Hazel pushed his hat forward on his head; he
listened, his jaws gently working on the tobacco cud. When she
had finished Hazel interpreted for Banteen.</p>

<p>"She says don't kill her because that was her baby the other
woman ran off with."</p>

<p>Benteen said: "Ask her how many warriors Antone's got
now?"</p>

<p>Al Hazel asked it and waited out the woman's slow answer. "She
says maybe enough to fill this clearing with their horses."</p>

<p>"Tell her we are not fools."</p>

<p>Al Hazel repeated it in Apache, and later said, "She says it
is true. Some Chiricabuas have come up to join Antone, and some
of the Tontos are with him."</p>

<p>"Where is Antone now?"</p>

<p>When Hazel repeated the question the woman looked at Benteen
through the loose straggle of her hair and was silent. Benteen
said: "Tell her we are taking her to Camp Grant and will keep her
there, but that if she leads us to Antone she is free to go back
to her baby and her people."</p>

<p>There was a long parley, Al Hazel talking, and listening, and
answering. The other Indians never stirred. Finally Al Hazel
grunted, "Enju," and turned to Benteen. "She says Antone's over
in the Mescals. May be a lie but Antone's been ridin' pretty fast
lately and he'll have to stop to rest up pretty soon. He always
did like the Mescals for a hideout."</p>

<p>"We'll find out. Put a guard on these people. We'll lay over
there until nine o'clock."</p>

<p>The rest of the detail came up the north side with the horses,
Somebody started a small fire, upon which the men cooked their
bacon and coffee. Benteen took the saddle from his horse, carried
it to the shelter of a pine tree and stretched full length, using
the saddle for a pillow. Flat on his back, he rolled a cigarette
and smoked it through, watching the brightening blue of the sky
through half closed eyes. Al Hazel came up and crouched on his
heels, imperturbably chewing his tobacco.</p>

<p>"The squaw which got away," Benteen observed; "may cause us
trouble. She'll walk forty miles with that papoose before
sundown. Maybe reach Antone."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Al Hazel. "You never can tell about an Injun.
But you done well, Lieutenant. Cavalry never sneaked up on an
Injun in this country before. It will shake Antone some."</p>

<p><br> <br> Reveille, stables, mess call, fatigue, and drill
call. This was the ancient routine. Standing at the doorway of
the commanding officer's quarters, Eleanor watched the parade
ground shadows creep back from the increasing blast of sunlight.
Ray Lankerwell came up with a small, copper-faced boy from
Nachee's camp. He put a catchup bottle on the parade ground,
thirty feet away. He said to Eleanor, "Watch this," and motioned
to the boy who calmly bent his bow and sent an arrow dead into
the open mouth of the bottle. "Well," grinned Lankerwell, "that
gives you some notion." He went away, leading the Apache lad.</p>

<p>Out on the parade Phil Castleton ran K troop through
dismounted drill, his voice hard and precise and biting in the
dead-hot air. Dust rose around the wheeling column; the
occasional bright patches on metal equipment flashed against the
pouring sunlight. Sweat began to stain the backs of the men's
shirts, and black as they were she saw the growing heat flush on
their faces. Phil Castleton stood motionless in the parade's
middle, heavy and wide-shouldered. "Canreen&mdash;pick up that
gun. Hep, hep, hep! On right into line&mdash;harch! Pull up your
shoulders, Flynn! Watch the pivot&mdash;come up, come up!"</p>

<p>Three years, Eleanor thought, made a difference in the things
she saw. At seventeen she had taken this man at surface value,
not quite knowing what qualities in him appealed to her so. She
began to see those qualities now, the strength and the weakness
of them. He was terribly ambitious, he was a man who could not
excuse weakness. She saw how relentlessly exact he was at drill,
how he kept repeating certain close-order commands over and over
again until it was done as he wanted it done. He had no patience
for imperfection; not even on the frontier, not even in this
destroying sunlight and suffocating heat.</p>

<p>Her father came from post headquarters and paused at the door
of the house, watching the drill. He pulled at the ends of his
mustache and she thought he meant to speak to Castleton; but
afterwards he walked into the living room. She turned with him,
watching him sink into a chair and sighingly relax.</p>

<p>"Daughter," he said; "it's a damned hot land," and wiped his
half-bald head free of sweat. His skin was full pink.</p>

<p>"Dad," she said, "tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl from the ambushed Summerton wagon train, Lily Marr,
came in. The heat seemed not to touch her. Against the doorway's
bright yellow light she was strong-shouldered and motionless,
with her quite dark hair drawn severely back from a central part.
Her eyes had a quick and direct watchfulness common to most
people living on the frontier; her face had the frontier's rather
set and inexpressive calm. Her skin was smooth, though tanned
from the sun, and her features were quite regular, save for a
generous mouth. She was better looking than her knock-about life
seemed to indicate. Her speech, Eleanor had already noticed, was
carefully chosen. All of this put together puzzled Eleanor
considerably. Behind this girl's gravity and very definite pride
was some kind of mystery.</p>

<p>The major said: "Miss Marr, I should like to know what I can
do for you."</p>

<p>The girl looked at him, weighing his words. Then she said,
"Nothing."</p>

<p>Warren said: "You want me to send you on to the Summerton
ranch with an escort?"</p>

<p>She had a quick answer, a very quick answer: "No&mdash;not
now. Isn't any use."</p>

<p>Warren didn't understand. "How's that?"</p>

<p>But she lifted her shoulders and let them fall. The gesture
had a Mexican fatality to it, and Eleanor got the clear
impression then that this girl had had a good many illusions and
girlhood dreams knocked out of her. She said: "If I am not too
much in the way, Major, I'd like to stay here for a little
while."</p>

<p>"Why bless your heart," announced Major Warren, "you can stay
here as long as the flag flies."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you might let me work for my keep. I can cook."</p>

<p>Warren said at once: "You're a guest, Miss Marr."</p>

<p>The girl turned her glance to the floor. "Thank you," she said
in a softer voice, and went to her room.</p>

<p>Phil Castleton's driving voice crossed the parade. "McGuire,
dress against the right file. Flynn, pull up your gun! Column
left, harch! One, two, three, four! Sergeant, your pace is too
slow."</p>

<p>Major Warren pulled out his watch and scowled at it. He rose
and walked to the door, looking on at the drill. Eleanor noticed
the sudden shadowing expression on his face and knew, because she
was a thorough army girl, exactly what he thought about.
Castleton was marching the feet off these men; there had been no
rest for half an hour&mdash;and the outside temperature was
beyond a hundred. Castleton hadn't moved from his exact stand in
the middle of the parade. Dust made a steady fog around the
countermarching troop; the faces of the men were drawn and brick-
red, and a little heat-swollen.</p>

<p>Major Warren tugged at the ends of his mustaches. He was,
Eleanor understood, thoroughly displeased, but caught in the
delicate problem of protecting his men without criticizing an
officer in front of them. Presently he called out: "Mr.
Castleton, that will be enough drill for the morning." Castleton
said, "Very well, sir," and turned the troop over to Sergeant
Hanna. He came across the parade and stopped under the brush
ramada, before Warren and Eleanor. When he removed his hat a
trapped sweat streamed down the violent sun-flush on his
cheeks.</p>

<p>Warren said, "Come in, Mr. Castleton," and stepped aside.
Castleton walked into the room's half-shade, He held his stiff
posture before the major, shoulders thrown back. His eyes,
Eleanor observed, were a strict noncommittal black. There was,
she reflected, something in him that even the blast of the sun
couldn't reach or wilt.</p>

<p>Her father, always careful with his words, spoke nevertheless
with a suppressed impatience. "Mr. Castleton, you should remember
to give your men long rests. You'll run the vitality out of
them."</p>

<p>"They're very slack in drill, sir, and the discipline is far
too relaxed. I wanted to pull them up so they'd remember."</p>

<p>"You must not expect perfect close-order drill from men
campaigning in the field, Mr. Castleton. Barracks and field duty
are two different things. There is always a letdown in military
niceties when you troop out on daily scout. You do not create
discipline, even among Irishmen as tough as those ones are, by
undue severity."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Castledon. But Eleanor knew how much dissent
lay behind those obedient words. She knew and was afraid. Her
father's more suave talk followed in.</p>

<p>"As soon as Mr. Benteen returns, it will be your turn on
scout. Those are the men you will be taking. You want them fresh,
not worn out. That's all, sir."</p>

<p>Eleanor said at once: "I'll make up some lemonade."</p>

<p>Castleton turned to her, rubbed pride visible at the corners
of his lips. "I'd better change clothes and inspect barracks." He
made his short bow and went out. She listened to the heavy tramp
of his feet on the board walk, and turned to catch her father's
speculative glance.</p>

<p>"You're a smart girl, Eleanor. You know the army better than
most young lieutenants. Castleton is an excellent officer. A
little hard, perhaps. Maybe you can unbend him a little. He needs
it."</p>

<p>"Is that the trouble, Dad?"</p>

<p>He sprawled in the chair, taking what comfort there was to be
had. He didn't answer until he had lighted a cigar; its blue fog
somewhat screened his eyes. "Most young officers are afraid to be
human, figuring it is a confession of weakness. They're not quite
sure of their straps, or their leadership. Usually it wears off.
After three years it should have worn off with Castleton but it
has not. I should hate to see him develop into a martinet. He is
too promising for that."</p>

<p>"He's very ambitious, Dad."</p>

<p>"So was I," said Warren, quite gentle with his words. "So was
I. But the Civil War glutted the army with officers and promotion
now is a very small gleam in the remote future. I should be much
more impatient with young Castleton if I did not know he was
eating out his heart over promotion. The lists ahead of him are
clogged with gray-haired first lieutenants and captains. And
superannuated majors like me. He thinks now the only way is to
make a very impressive record so that somehow he can make his way
over the plodders. I wish him luck, but he must not get himself
too hated by men and officers in the attempt. He should develop a
little philosophy. Like me. Like&mdash;"</p>

<p>She immediately supplied the name. "Like Mr. Benteen."</p>

<p>But the Major was too fair a man to be trapped into a
comparison of junior officers. He waved his cigar and said
blandly, "You're too damned clever, young woman. Go fix me a
lemonade."</p>

<p>But after she had gone into the kitchen his voice came back to
her, slow and wistful. "Your mother was the same. We had an awful
lot of fun. If she had lived I bet I'd been a brigadier now. It
wouldn't mean anything to me at this late date, but it would have
been mighty nice to see her face when she pinned that star on my
shoulder. That's the kind of a woman she was, Eleanor. Everything
was a game, and the game was fun, clear to the end."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<p class="first">AFTERNOON'S heat settled over the post. It was a
suction that drew the last residual moisture from earth and
boards and living things. The mountains grew dim behind a blue-
yellow haze; all along the valley of the San Pedro was a sulky
glitter of rocks and sand and mica particles. Even the Indian and
Mexican hangers-on retreated to the thin, oppressive shadows of
the post. Nothing moved.</p>

<p>Harriet Mixler lay on the bed in their two-room dobe quarters,
face upward and her arms lying full length, fists doubled. George
Mixler sat by the bed, stirring the air around her head with a
fan. He was a solid young man with a pink round young face
crossed by a tawny dragoon's mustache; on his face now was a
faint, worried smile. "Pshaw, Harriet," he murmured, "nothing bad
will happen." Sweat rolled from his cheeks, down past his open
collar. He swiped it away and kept on fanning.</p>

<p>Her eyes were wide-round and breathing was difficult for her.
"George," she said, "I should have gone to Fort Whipple three
months ago. I'm going to die."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "no, you won't. Why, it is a natural thing,
Harriet. Major McClure's wife had three of 'em&mdash;all on the
frontier. Once she had no doctor. It was behind the lines, during
the siege of Vicksburg."</p>

<p>Afterwards he could have bitten his tongue in two. She was an
expressive girl, quick to feel and quick to change. Fear rushed
across her face, stronger than it had been before. "George,
Doctor Shiraz will be away when the time comes. You wait and see.
He's always gone! You'd think they might remember me. But they
don't care about a woman in the army&mdash;they don't care!"</p>

<p>"He'll be here," promised Mixler. "Right here."</p>

<p>"You always stick up for the army," she said passionately.
"You never see it my way! I hate the army. I wish I never had
seen a uniform!"</p>

<p>"I know," he answered quietly. "It is devilish hard on a
woman. But it will be all right."</p>

<p>She almost screamed at him. "How can you be so sure, so
indifferent? It's me, it isn't you!"</p>

<p>He said: "I'll get some fresh water."</p>

<p>"No, it's all flat and tasteless." She stared at the thatched
ceiling, with the shadow of all that she felt making its dark
stain in her eyes. "I feel so terrible. Just like an animal in a
trap. It is too late for everything."</p>

<p>He was a man, simple and direct and awkward; and in trying to
cheer her he said the wrong thing again. "If it's a girl, we'll
call her Harriet, If it is a boy, we'll have him in the saddle
before he can walk."</p>

<p>She gave him a swift, hating look. It chilled him to see it,
and to hear the dead conviction in her voice. "Listen, George. If
I live, and if the baby lives, I'm going away as soon as I can.
I'll never stay in another army post, I'll never follow you
around in another army wagon like a washwoman, I'll never stand
at the door of another miserable dobe shack and pretend it is
home, waiting for you to come out of those terrible hills."</p>

<p>"I know," he murmured. "I wouldn't talk so much, Harriet. Just
lie still."</p>

<p>"No," she told him, more and more quiet. "You think you're
just humoring a foolish woman; I'm telling you the truth, George.
I wanted you to resign. You could have had a nice position in
Baltimore. My father offered it. We could have lived so
pleasantly. You wouldn't do that, and I thought you were being
gallant, wanting to follow your regiment. You have had your way.
Now I shall have mine. I'm not cut out to be an army wife. I have
been miserable every day. I'm going to leave you, George, just as
soon as I can travel."</p>

<p>"All right, Harriet."</p>

<p>She looked at him, the terrible intensity still in her eyes.
"I mean it, George." And then, looking at her, Mixler saw that
she did, He kept on fanning, not speaking. Eleanor Warren came
into the room and saw the drawn expression on his face, the set
and half-wild look in Harriet's eyes. She took the fan
immediately from Mixler. "You run on."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Mixler and got up. He turned through the room,
took a long pull from the warm water jar, and stood with his big
legs wide apart. He tried to roll a cigarette, but his hands were
shaking badly, so he threw the tobacco and paper away and left
the dobe.</p>

<p>At five o'clock, in the densest heat of the day, a rider
crossed the San Pedro and appeared before the commanding
officer's house and slid from an exhausted horse. George Mixler
happened to be coming on from the sutler's store at the moment.
The traveler managed to gasp out, "Been a shooting at Summerton's
ranch&mdash;they want the doctor," and then fell to the ground,
his lips and face turned purple.</p>

<p>Mixler dragged him into Warren's house, rousing the Major from
a troubled siesta. A trooper ran down the walk and presently
Shiraz came up, took his professional look at the man and said,
"Damn near sunstroke."</p>

<p>Major Warren said: "You'll have to go up to Summerton's ranch,
Shiraz. Seems to be a shooting. Mr. Mixler, get an escort and go
along. You'll be back by midnight." Twenty minutes later Shiraz
and Mixler, with six troopers, crossed the San Pedro and headed
toward the gap in the Tortillas.</p>

<p>At six, Eleanor brought Harriet Mixler to the commanding
officer's quarters for supper. Afterwards, in the sundown hour,
they stood beneath the brush ramada to watch the mounted troopers
stand retreat and guard mount, the buglers of I and K sounding
the music. It was suddenly dark, with yellow lights sparkling all
around the quadrangle; the sprinkling cart came past, leaving
behind the steamy pungence of water on hot dust. Phil Castleton
walked up from the hard outer shadows, made his bow to the women
and expressed his sentiments on the weather. But his talk was no
screen to hide his desires and immediately Harriet Mixler turned
away.</p>

<p>"I'll come along in a little while," Eleanor said to her.</p>

<p>The silent Lily Marr spoke up. "Let me walk with you, Mrs.
Mixler."</p>

<p>For a moment all the others looked at this grave, secretive
woman. Harriet Mixler's face turned from the shadows until the
beam of the Warren house-light caught it and showed its strange,
set pallor. "You needn't bother," she murmured. Lily Marr said
softly, "We all get a little lonesome at times," and took Harriet
Mixler's arm, and moved on into the night.</p>

<p>Phil Castleton stared after them, holding his remark until
they were barely beyond hearing distance. "I don't like that Marr
girl," he said.</p>

<p>Eleanor Warren, listening to the flat ring of his voice,
realized that all his opinions were like that. Quick and
arbitrary, one way or another. She didn't immediately speak, but
took his arm and fell into step with him. They passed the corner
of officers' row, turning along the north side of the quadrangle.
The moon lay at a low angle. In the sky, deep yellow from the
dust in the air. When they reached the south side of the
quadrangle Castleton drew her into the parade to avoid the broad
talk of the troopers in the barrack. She said: "Why, Phil?"</p>

<p>"A stray woman in a tough country. She hasn't explained
herself, has she? Just a woman out of nowhere."</p>

<p>"Most of us come out of nowhere, Phil."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that. And what impels you to be
philosophical?"</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "I guess I've always been. I see people
laughing or crying&mdash;and I wonder why. I never pass a man but
what I wonder at his story, at all the fortune, good or bad, he's
been through. Why should you draw me away from that barrack wall,
Phil? I know the kind of things men like that might talk about, I
know them by heart. I was raised with troopers."</p>

<p>He stopped and turned to her. She saw displeasure on his face
clearly. "That's not becoming, Eleanor: If I ever heard one of
them speak like that within earshot of you I'd put a pack on his
back and march him under the sun until he dropped."</p>

<p>"You'd have most of them dropping then," she said, gently
amused. "You shouldn't expect so much purity from a trooper,
Phil. It isn't that they mean to be rough. They'd cut their arms
off for a woman. It's just that they never knew any other way to
talk. You shouldn't mind. These men really raised me. I think
they spared me nothing in the way of practical
knowledge&mdash;I'm glad they didn't."</p>

<p>He said, faintly indulgent, "I imagine they left you in the
dark in some things. I should hope so."</p>

<p>She said: "They are very real, Phil. How well do you know
them? Their stories? Do you know about Harry Jackson&mdash;and
the woman at Valley Ranch?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord," he exclaimed, "who told you about her?"</p>

<p>She was laughing at him, softly, freely. "I told you I was
raised by this regiment. Cowen keeps nothing from me."</p>

<p>"It is damned unpleasant. It isn't right."</p>

<p>"Why not, Phil? it is pretty tragic, isn't it&mdash;young
Harry Jackson falling in love with a very common woman. And not
knowing she's bad?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure he doesn't know?"</p>

<p>"Hanna says he doesn't."</p>

<p>They had walked on. Now he stopped again. "Do all these men
talk to you like that, Eleanor? They never talk to me."</p>

<p>She took his arm and they walked on, steps striking together.
The eight o'clock hour call ran the posts; the sentry relief
stamped by. They passed the post bakery, went back down officers'
row, and began the second round of the quadrangle; "Phil," she
murmured, "you must be more patient and a little more human with
them. Some of them are illiterate, some quarrelsome, some their
own worst enemies. But they're the best men on earth&mdash;and
they'll stick to an officer until he dies if they're loyal to
him. But you must be loyal to them."</p>

<p>He said, quite short and dry, "I begin to see. A sermon,
Eleanor?"</p>

<p>He had that faint intolerance&mdash;that resistance which came
from his pride and his own tremendous energies. She knew she had
said all she could for one night and so, knowing it, she laughed
again and stopped by the barrack's corner. "No&mdash;no sermon,
Phil. Isn't this a lovely night?"</p>

<p>He put his arms behind her shoulders and she could see how
stirred he was; it was a roughness on his face. "By God,
Eleanor," he murmured and pulled her in.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when she stepped back, she was laughing again.
"You see, Phil? I'm not a graduate of a female seminary. I'm an
army officer's daughter. I'm a woman. Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>He was grudgingly troubled. "I wish you wouldn't use quite
that tone. It isn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Phil," she said, "living is something that should be real. We
should take it as best we can, as deep and wide and full as we
can. We shouldn't ever be small or ever be afraid. Does that
sound like anything to you?"</p>

<p>"I guess," he said, hesitant and dry, "I miss the point."</p>

<p>She sighed. "Most people do. I wish I could find the
words&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was as far as she got; for the sound of a scream, wild
and in the highest possible reach of a woman's voice, struck
across the parade. A scream, a cry&mdash;and a guttering breath
of agony. And silence.</p>

<p><br> <br> Lily Marr walked along officers' row with Harriet
and turned into the Mixler quarters. She stood by, waiting while
Harriet lighted a lamp&mdash;so still and grave that Harriet
turned to her with a certain puzzlement. "It is nice of you to be
pleasant to me. I think I shall go to bed. You needn't bother to
stay. It is so terribly hot in here."</p>

<p>They were about the same age; in no other respect was there a
similarity. For Harriet Mixler was a frightened girl who could
not forget the shelter and the light and the softness of the home
from which she had come; she had never known hardship, she had
never known uncertainty until now. All this left her still
childlike and dreaming, and frightened by the world she found
herself in. Watching with her still eyes, Lily Marr saw this
clearly. She took Harriet's arm again, leading her back to the
bedroom, and her voice was slow and very calm.</p>

<p>"The heat isn't bad. Nothing's as bad as a woman's mind makes
out. I'll sit awhile."</p>

<p>Harriet put herself on the bed, lying full length. The light
was against her eyes. Lily Marr moved the lamp to the far corner
of the room. She drew her chair near the bed and propped her chin
against the palm of her hand. Her face, in its habitual repose,
had an expression that stirred Harriet Mixler's curiosity until
she found herself trying to find a proper name for it. It was
something like sternness, like a gravity that came when someone
had seen too much, like the shadow of hidden sadness. This was as
near as Harriet could explain it. But whatever the cause, it was
pleasant to see the deep, gentle glow in this girl's eyes; to
hear the steadiness of her voice. It brought an inexpressible
calm into the room.</p>

<p>Harriet said: "Have you been long in this country?"</p>

<p>"Four years."</p>

<p>Harriet murmured in her little girl's wondering voice: "It is
so odd to think of people. Four years ago I was in Norfolk,
having so much fun. It was very gay. And you were on the desert,
in this wild territory. It is very odd. Might I ask about your
people?"</p>

<p>"They were killed by Indians."</p>

<p>"How sad," murmured Harriet Mixler. "Don't you hate
Arizona?"</p>

<p>Lily Marr seemed to study the question, as if it aroused an
unfamiliar thought. "Why," she said, "I don't believe I do. When
you can't choose your way it doesn't seem much point to hate
anything."</p>

<p>"I reckon I don't understand that."</p>

<p>"My people started from New Orleans to California. They were
killed at Apache Pass. I have made my way on the frontier ever
since. Nobody hates living. We are all glad to live. I am. But I
guess I can understand being lonely. Don't be afraid&mdash;don't
ever be afraid."</p>

<p>She put her hand on Harriet Mixler's arm and left it there a
moment, her lips turning sweet, The darkness and doubt in Harriet
Mixler's face was very real. She stirred uncertainly on the bed.
Lily Marr's calm voice was a comfort, it was something real and
solid. "Nothing is as bad as you think. Pain makes you cry, but
when it is gone you forget it. Hunger hurts, but you can live a
long while without food. That's what you have to learn. Don't
ever be afraid. You can stand anything. Afterwards it is good to
be just alive. I'm telling you something I know."</p>

<p>Harriet Mixler rose slowly from the bed. "I declare," she
said, "I think you're a help. I believe I'll undress and try to
sleep."</p>

<p>Lily Marr left the chair, moving toward the door. She turned
to watch the drawn, thin lines of Harriet Mixler's face; and saw
the haunted uncertainty there. She said in her deliberate way:
"You have very pretty hair. In the morning I will comb it out for
you. Good night."</p>

<p>After she had gone Harriet Mixler stood quite still, her hands
supported against the dobe wall. She felt the heaviness of her
child, the pressure on her legs. It was hard to breathe this
suffocating air and suddenly the silence was so deep that she
heard the slugging rhythm of her heart. She moved through the
house and out into the rear yard, going along the vague border of
a low board fence, holding to the top of the fence. It was
minutely cooler here and the stars were whitely glistening in the
sky. She passed back to Captain Harrison's house, seeing him
rocking in a chair; beyond that was Doctor Shiraz' dobe. For a
moment she paused, wondering how soon he would return, and the
low, deep fright came to her again and then she looked at the
black overhead sky and began to shake, and to hate this country
and this post and the people in it, and went down into a dark
loneliness that had no light. She walked faster, as though moving
away from something&mdash;something that kept following her,
though she didn't know what it was.</p>

<p>Her hand was on the top rail of the fence and, sliding
forward, it touched a rounded, rough surface that gave before her
fingers and fell with a soft "tunk" to the ground. She reached
down and touched it again and then her fingers moved across the
nose and the mouth of the dismembered Apache head Doctor Shiraz
had put out on the fence to dry. She flung herself upright,
sickness flooding through her, turned cold, turned crazed; and at
that moment she screamed at the top of her voice until her breath
ran out and would not come back, and fell senseless to the
ground.</p>

<p>Captain Harrison came out of his back door, cursing. The
sentry rushed around from the parade, bawling, "Cawprl of the
Guard, Post number Five!" There was a swift yell all across the
post and feet smashed along the loose-boarded walk and Ray
Lankerwell ran up from post headquarters, swinging a lantern at
each jump. He found Harrison crouched over Harriet Mixler. The
lantern light touched the grisly shape of the Apache's head.
Lankerwell kicked it away, hearing Harrison's terrible,
passionate cursing. "By God, I'll kill that damned doctor! Bear a
hand, Mr. Lankerwell! Easy&mdash;she's damned near dead!"</p>

<p>The guard relief charged up. Major Warren rushed through the
Mixler dobe and settled down by Harrison, his breath bubbling in
his lungs. Eleanor hurried out of the night. Harrison caught
Harriet under the arms, lifting her; and then he and Lankerwell
took her back into the dobe and laid her on the bed. Major Warren
had the lantern now, holding it over Harriet. The room grew
crowded and all the breathing of these people was quite labored.
Eleanor dropped beside the bed, her hands on Harriet's breasts.
Harriet lay with her eyes half opened, the pupils rolled out of
sight. Her fists were clenched over her chest and she was caught
in sudden, shaking spasms.</p>

<p>Eleanor said: "When will Doctor Shiraz be back?"</p>

<p>"Not till midnight."</p>

<p>She lifted her head, staring at her father. "She can't wait
that long."</p>

<p>Harrison ground out, "Is there nobody in this post who knows
anything about babies&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lily Marr came past the men, gently pushing them. She stood a
moment, looking down at Harriet Mixler; and suddenly turned. Her
shoulders were square in the lamplight, her voice was cool and
unstirred. It was a competence, a feeling of sureness they all
felt. It was in the way she looked at them, in the way she
spoke.</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>Eleanor looked at the men. "You had better leave. Lily and I
will do this."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

<p class="first">AROUND nine o'clock that morning Benteen started
down the rocky hillside with the detail. At eleven, in a piece of
flat country below, Al Hazel got out of his saddle and began
walking a zigzag course ahead of the troopers. Presently he
pointed to a faintly scuffed mark on the flinty soil and to the
broken stems of a bunchgrass clump beyond it. "There's your
squaw's trail," he said. "And you can figure Antone's at the end
of it." He got back on the horse, his hat tilted forward on his
head and his eyes following this dim clue. The land heaved away
in a kind of irregular monotony, roll on roll, with always the
higher peaks standing black-cut under the strengthening sun. They
crossed areas of strewn slab rock and threaded thickets of
catclaw. A deer heaved out of of a mesquite grove and vanished in
an adjacent arroyo, the powdery dust rising behind him in dotted
clouds. Howell Ford rode beside Benteen; Hanna followed behind.
There was no talk in the double line of troopers. They rode with
an energy-saving looseness, hats pulled low across their sun-
blackened cheeks, shading the sweep of black mustaches, the blue
surface of Irish eyes and long raw-boned Irish jaws. Their
shoulder points were gaunt-square against the grayness of their
shirts; the exposed triangles of throat flesh were bronze-black
against the sun. Saddle leather squeaked in rhythm and the gentle
chock-chock of hoof falls ran forward through the day's
drowze.</p>

<p>Benteen watched the land closely, studying the faint darkness
at the base of mesquite and catclaw clumps, the rim of the
scattered rocks, the sheltering pitahaya columns, the low-lying
hummocks of mescal and Spanish bayonet. Behind these covert spots
the solitary Apache brave loved to lie and watch and wait with a
patience that had no end. There was no security in this land;
none by day and none by night. It was a country of extremes, of
long silence and sudden wild crying, of bone searching dryness
followed by the sudden rush of cloud-burst torrents down some
narrow canyon; of drowsy peace and the swift blast of gunfire.
This was the Territory, raw and primitive. It scoured softness
out of a man, it put an expression in his eyes that never left;
and it put a strange recollection in his head so that he never
forgot the country, and even in its hardest moments, made him
want to stay on.</p>

<p>Benteen thought of these things as he rode taciturnly under
the sunlight blast; of these things and of Eleanor Warren. His
interest in her had been, from the first, direct and lively, as
near to an instant attraction as he had ever felt in any woman.
His picture of her now was quite distinct&mdash;tall and shapely
in a way that struck through any man, good or bad. Her long,
composed lips held back some kind of smiling knowledge; her eyes
mirrored some kind of wisdom; He remembered the way she held her
head, still and straight when she looked at him, with light
sliding across the copper surface of her hair. In a woman silence
meant many things; he was not sure what it meant in her, but it
pulled at him like mystery, it played on his own solitary
thinking and lifted a slow run of excitement, as though he was on
the edge of discovery.</p>

<p>They nooned under the insufficient shade of a paloverde grove;
and went on. At two o'clock, turning out of a shallow canyon,
they came before the footslopes of a long sweeping rise. A mile
onward and upward stood the rim of another mountain. Benteen
pulled in, at once considering the tactical situation. Al Hazel
trotted back from a short exploration. "More tracks come
together," he said, and pointed toward the summit. "They all go
yonder, to the summit."</p>

<p>"If Antone's up there," said Benteen, "he's been watching us
travel all day. And if he's there it means he thinks he can whip
us. Or maybe he's waiting to see how far we'll come."</p>

<p>"Never know about an Injun," murmured Hazel, his glance
sweeping back and forth across the far rim. After a long pause he
added, "But he's still there, all right."</p>

<p>Over to the right a break showed in the mountain. Benteen
asked about it. "That's a canyon," said Hazel. "It cuts through
the mountains. Pretty deep."</p>

<p>"Any other way of getting off that mountain?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't catch Antone gettin' in a spot where there
wasn't no back door. He's got a trail into the canyon, on the
other side of the peak."</p>

<p>Ford said: "I think I see somebody moving on that rim."</p>

<p>Benteen shaded his eyes and took a long look. Rocks lay
scattered on the slope, as far as the rim. Up there stood a
scatter of pines; and presently he made out the stir of more than
one figure. He thought about this a little while. "Antone wants
us to know he's there."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Al Hazel, dryly. "If an Injun don't want
to be seen you wouldn't see him."</p>

<p>"Pretty certain of himself," considered Benteen. "Hanna, how's
our water?"</p>

<p>"Half canteens, sor."</p>

<p>The slope lay gray-brown under the solid beat of the sun; at
this three o'clock hour the heat boiled up gelatin waves from the
rocks and turned the atmosphere smoke blue. The metal strip on
Benteen's gunbutt was hot enough to burn the skin on the back of
his hand. "It will be a damned warm climb. He may be as strong as
the squaw says, which is pretty strong for this detachment. But
those rocks will make a strong shelter, if we need them." He went
to the saddle, quite carefully reviewing Major Warren's
instructions. He weighed those instructions against the situation
before him, making a careful balance. The responsibility was
entirely his own. This column belonged to him at the moment, to
be expended if he thought the results justified it, to be saved
if not. This was the hard choice an officer in the field had to
make. He looked back at the men, and at the horses; and silence
settled down.</p>

<p>"We will close in," he said.</p>

<p>Still double file, the detail took to the slope and started
the long climb, carbines canted forward. A defined trail ran
irregularly through the rock scatter. High up, to the extreme
left of the summit, an Indian on a horse moved into sight and cut
a distinct circle on the slope, waving his lance, and moved out
of sight again. Another four hundred yards onward Benteen said:
"Skirmishers," and watched his column break into a single line
abreast him. "Ford, take the right. Hazel, please go over to the
left. If we run into more trouble than we can properly account
for we'll fort up in these rocks."</p>

<p>He kept sharp watch on the rim above, and saw the furtive blur
of Apaches in motion. At this elevation the lower country rolled
away, broken and rough. The roundabout rocks emitted a furnace
blast of soaked-in heat. A six-foot diamondback rattlesnake
sluggishly stirred in the trail, struck and wound, and struck
again. Benteen's horse churned up the soil, grunting away from
it. Sweat plastered Benteen's shirt skintight against his back.
At this moment he saw no more Indians, and gave the command to
fight on foot.</p>

<p>The line of skirmisbers dismounted, passing reins over to the
horse-holders. One extra man remained with the prisoners. The
rest spread out and began the last climb on foot, bending in and
around the rocks. Watching the stony parapet, Benteen saw a head
come into sight and drop back. It was as near as he could judge
two hundred yards to the top. Van Rhyn marched beside him, hard
hit by the heat and the labor of this climb; his face was drawn
and pale and his breath jerked through him like a saw. Benteen
said at once, "Drop back and replace one of the horse-
holders."</p>

<p>But van Rhyn showed him a pair of odd, hurt eyes. "Let me come
on, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>Benteen called, "Watch the line, men. Don't get ahead of
it."</p>

<p>Al Hazel yelled, "Hyar they come!"</p>

<p>A dozen Apaches, small and wiry and stripped down to moccasins
and breechclout, leaped over the rim in one general line, struck
the loose talus dirt and slid feet first toward the nearest
rocks. Benteen saw their rifles jump forward in their arms. At
the same moment other guns began to bang sharply from the top of
the rim. Benteen called:</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>The troopers had dropped into the rocks. A volley smashed out,
hard on the heels of Benteen's command; dirt spouted up where the
bullets struck, all around the racing Apaches. One of them fell
head foremost, rolling in a ball. A second dropped on his
haunches, and slid, without life, feet first into the rocks.
Hanna's bronzed voice rode this racket, hard and unemotional.
"Come along now&mdash;come along now! Waste no shots!" Benteen
braced himself against a rock, holding his revolver on those
shifting targets. He saw his bullets hit; from the corners of his
eyes saw the line of troopers move forward. The firing from the
ramparts kept on, but the Indians who had jumped down to the
rocks were all out of sight, dead or still. A slug smashed the
surface of the rock beside which he stood. He moved forward,
calling: "Keep down&mdash;keep down. Jackson, pull your head
down." A pair of Apaches suddenly sprang up from the near rocks,
fired in unison and raced sidewise to escape the converging lead
of the troopers. Ford had pulled the right of the line forward to
enfilade those rocks. Benteen kept his eyes on the ramparts
above, seeing the carbine snouts dip and fire and pull back. He
called: "Lift your aim! On the rim!"</p>

<p>Harry Jackson kept moving out of the rocks, he kept standing
straight above them to get his shots. Benteen walked into the
clear area, crossed to Harry Jackson and pushed him down. A
ricocheting bullet whined like a great bee past them. Dirt and
rock-flakes flew along the rim, the effect of the troopers'
higher-reaching fire; and up there the barrels of the Indians'
guns began to fade away.</p>

<p>Ford, completing his flank movement, flushed the last Apache
from the lower rocks and then Benteen, watching the rampart
carefully, felt the turn of the fight. He walked out of the
rocks, pushing his boots against the sliding talus, wigwagging at
the men around him. The line surged up the steep slope, throwing
occasional pot shots to cover its approach. Harry Jackson raced
forward, catching the shoulders of the staggering van Rhyn; he
boosted van Rhyn along, using his arms and the point of his knees
to keep the older man from entire collapse. Dust boiled around
Benteen and caked into the streaming sweat along his face. He dug
this muddy grime out of his eyes and licked it off his lips, and
seized the rim with his finger tips.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hanna came up to him, heaving heavy wind out of his
chest. They slashed the rolling gravel behind them, flung
themselves over the rim and dropped bellyflat from exhaustion.
The troop came on, one by one, grunting hard with this last huge
effort. Private Jackson, still below the rim, yelled: "Wait for
me&mdash;wait for me! I got van Rhyn here!"</p>

<p>Antone's band ran and rode across the table-top summit,
kicking the cloudy dust behind. An arrow skittered the earth near
Benteen and a few straggling shots came back, striking nothing.
Troopers pulled themselves to a kneeling position, firing through
the dust. Benteen got up, trotting forward with the detail after
him. Part way over the flat he saw Antone's band sink out of
sight into the adjoining canyon.</p>

<p>"Morphy," he called, "run back and signal the horses up!"</p>

<p>He trotted over the clearing, through the foggy dust. The
boots of the troopers struck hard and their knees bent and never
quite straightened in stride; this was how spent they were. They
went slogging, shambling along, the line swaying unevenly, men
falling slowly back from the running. A thin grove of pines stood
at this far edge of the mountain summit. Ducking in and out of
the useless shade, Benteen arrived at the break-off and saw
Antone's band rush single file down a narrow mountain trail into
the canyon; a bend carried the Indians entirely from sight.</p>

<p>Howell Ford spoke between the windy reach of his breathing.
"They ain't far ahead, Tom!"</p>

<p>The troopers came up one by one. Men dropped flat to the
ground, sucking in air; men stood upright with their legs braced
apart. Harry Jackson came on with his shoulders supporting van
Rhyn, The climb had taken all vitality out of the troopers, and
the hard-burning heat took all nourishment out of the air; when
they breathed it no relief came. There was nothing their lungs
could bite into. The horse-holders galloped over the clearing,
bringing up the led mounts.</p>

<p>Howell Ford said: "Look here, Tom."</p>

<p>The single file of Antone's retreating warriors showed briefly
on a reverse bend of the trail and disappeared soon again.
Presently the party showed at the bottom of the narrow gorge,
crossed it and faded in a rock alleyway. The bed of the canyon
was eight hundred feet directly below this break-off of the
mountains, marked by a small quick-running creek that glistened
in the lower shadows; the tail of Antone's party crossed the
creek, a half mile up the canyon. A pair of Apaches dropped back,
squatting by the water. Beyond this spot the land ran into a
heavy tangle of hills.</p>

<p>Ford watched the two Indians. "They take their damned good
time about it." He looked at Benteen. "Do we follow?"</p>

<p>Benteen considered the narrow trail and the surrounding walls
of rock. It was bad country for pursuit. "I think that's what
Antone would like to have us do," he judged.</p>

<p>Al Hazel pushed his derby back from his forehead. "Reckon
that's correct."</p>

<p>"They didn't all go into that hole," decided Benteen. "Some of
them are still in the rocks at the edge of the trail."</p>

<p>"If I know Antone," put in Hazel, "that's whut he's done."</p>

<p>"We're as close to that savage as we have ever got," pointed
out Ford. "Seems a shame to let him slip loose."</p>

<p>Benteen squatted on his heels, studying the land beyond with a
close interest. The decision was up to him again, and needed to
be quickly made&mdash;if he intended to pursue. There was no
other way of approaching Antone unless he took the troop back
down the mountain and circled it, striking the canyon from the
lower end; This meant half a day's extra time. The temptation was
pretty strong to push on, but he remembered that Antone had
chosen this spot, had made a piece of a fight, and had retreated:
Antone was a good general, and very probably waiting in the
yonder rocks for a foolish young cavalry officer to lead his men
into a beautiful trap. Benteen looked around at the troopers,
seeing the dead-beat look in their eyes. Midsummer campaigning
was tough.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "We'll make camp here and rest until midnight
before turning back to Grant."</p>

<p>Hanna's voice began to catch hold of the troopers. They
stacked arms and put the horses on picket in the half shade of
the pines. Pickets dropped back to the various edges of this
mountain summit; the rest of the detail sprawled on the earth.
Benteen moved back to van Rhyn who lay full length on the pine
needles. Van Rhyn's lips were pressed together and his breathing
came raggedly.</p>

<p>Benteen said: "I'm going to have you transferred to Whipple.
This low country is too much for you."</p>

<p>Van Rhyn shook his head. "It makes very little difference,
does it?"</p>

<p>Sunlight poured out of the low west, the color of fire. Ford
still held his position at the rim, watching the canyon. He
called to Benteen in a thoroughly exasperated voice: "Those
damned savages are still in sight."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Benteen. "It is a part of the trick."</p>

<p>Al Hazel's shrewd, half closed eyes swung to Benteen; and then
to Ford. He said to Ford: "I reckon that's the oldest trick in
the book. They figger a white man will jump at bait. Most white
men will."</p>

<p>"I'll stack one trooper against five Apaches any day,"
grumbled Ford.</p>

<p>"Not in this country," contradicted Al Hazel. "Apaches are the
toughest fighters in the world."</p>

<p>Benteen sat on the ground with a piece of paper spread before
him. He drew a careful map of the country, marking his trail and
the exact position of this hilltop. Below it he wrote his brief
dispatch to Major Warren:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sir:</span></p>

<p class="letter">We met Antone's band at this spot, had a
slight brush with them and drove them back into the canyon. They
are retreating in a general easterly direction, about thirty
strong. When Lieutenant Castleton sets out he should avoid the
canyon and strike into the hills by higher ground. I am
returning.</p>

<p class="letter">Obediently,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">T.C. Benteen</span>.</p>

<p><br>
Hanna came up. "They been bakin' mescal in some pits at the
other corner of this clearin'."</p>

<p>Suddenly the sun dropped below the rim. The sky still held its
last brightness but a quick powder blue spread like water across
the land; and silence seemed to drop like a blanket over them, so
violent had been the sun. Benteen folded his dispatch, handing it
to Sergeant Hanna, "Send Jackson and two other privates back to
Grant with this as soon as dark comes."</p>

<p>Ford settled beside him, grumbling. "I hate to see those
rascals get away."</p>

<p>Benteen stretched out full length, watching the fading color
in the sky. "No hurry. We can't fight an Apache in his own style.
Our job is to keep 'em moving, wearing down their horses and
grub. If they can't bake mescal&mdash;which takes three
days&mdash;they'll have a tougher time eating. My dispatch will
reach Grant before daylight. Castleton will be on the trail with
his fresh detail in the morning, while we go back to rest up the
horses, We just play leapfrog with Antone."</p>

<p>"Not very spectacular campaigning."</p>

<p>"No," said Benteen. "Not very. Twenty cavalrymen dead at the
bottom of that canyon would be, though."</p>

<p>Dusk settled in swift desert suddenness and a campfire began
to bum against the shadows, Benteen cooked his coffee and fried
his bacon and ate it with an active man's unsatisfied hunger. He
stretched out on the ground, rolled a cigarette and watched the
night stars break through the enamel black of the sky. His men
lay blanketed nearby, drowsy in speech; the sentries scuffed the
hard earth along the rim. Turned partly on his side, Benteen
watched the silhouette of van Rhyn's sharp profile against the
fire. Van Rhyn's voice was the voice of an educated man; and he
was speaking to Harry Jackson.</p>

<p>"All young men are proud of strength, Harry. And all ignorant
men, young or old, are proud of it. The thing you must learn is
that faith is the stronger thing."</p>

<p>"What?" said Harry Jackson.</p>

<p>"It is something that will come to you later," said van
Rhyn.</p>

<p>Lying back, all muscles loose, Benteen listened to the run of
talk, to the little sounds coming out of the broad night, to the
shifting of horses' feet on the hard earth. Ease came to him and
these surrounding sounds and smells comforted him&mdash;being
familiar and old, and a part of his life clear back to his first
enlistment. There was a simplicity to the smell of sweat and to
the gentle grumbling of Hanna's voice; there was an ancient
reality to the feel of dust and pine needles against his skin;
there was something in the far sky that caught up a man and
cradled him with its timeless promise. A man, he thought, was
meant to be a part of dust and struggle, to feel hardness and to
get his pleasure from the little intervals between. This was his
kind of life. Lying like that, with the cigarette burning against
his fingers, he remembered the tilt of Eleanor Warren's head as
she had watched him from the porch of the commanding officer's
house. It was her silence, and all the secret things behind that
silence, which caught at his interest, and fanned the faint flame
of excitement again. She was a full woman; in her eyes was a
knowledge of what life was&mdash;what it ought to be. He felt it
in her; it was a quality that came across the space between them
and touched him.</p>

<p>He fell asleep with the effortlessness of a natural man, and
was wakened at midnight. The troop fell in line and turned down
the long slope, bound southwest toward Grant. All the stars were
brilliant in the sky.</p>

<p><br> <br> George Mixler had rigged up a hand-operated fan from
the ceiling of the room, directly above Harriet's bed. He sat in
a corner, patiently pulling it back and forth, stirring the stale
night's heat over his wife. She lay motionless on the bed, her
black hair loose around the drawn paleness of her cheeks, and
would not look at him. This was the thing that gouged through him
like the sharp point of a knife; she had not looked at him and
had not spoken to him since his return from the detail to
Summerton's ranch. The baby was in an improvised cracker-box
cradle beside the bed. Shiraz bent over it with his stethoscope,
the edge of his whiskers against that wizened-red little face. It
was a boy, frail and homely even to George Mixler's partisan
eyes. Eleanor Warren and Lily Marr stood in the background,
waiting Shiraz' inspection.</p>

<p>Shiraz put down his instrument, rolled it together and shoved
it in his pocket. He parted his whiskers neatly. "Nothing wrong
at all."</p>

<p>Harriet spoke in a washed-out voice: "He cries so much."</p>

<p>"So would you," said Shiraz, "if you were in his place. It is
a natural cry." He took out the stethoscope and put it against
her chest; his eyes kept watching her face, very kind, very
sharp. She looked back at him steadily and he was a wise enough
man to see the resentment she bore him, and to understand its
reason.</p>

<p>She murmured: "You weren't here."</p>

<p>He put the stethoscope away again. "No," he admitted, "I broke
my promise,&mdash;didn't I?"</p>

<p>George Mixler spoke up. "Harriet, you shouldn't talk like
that. He was called out."</p>

<p>She didn't answer Mixler, she didn't look at him. Her lips
were straight and tight for a moment. When she spoke, it was to
Shiraz. "I know. Orders come first. So you went to Summerton's
ranch and set a drunken man's broken arm."</p>

<p>Shiraz stood up, faintly smiling. "None of your fears came
true, Harriet. You're all right and your boy's all right. Mark my
word, you'll both be old soldiers." He remained cheerful in face
of her settled and resenting manner. Afterwards he looked around
at the woman, and over to George Mixler, and seemed to listen to
the silence in the room, estimating its meaning. He nodded at
Eleanor who went toward George Mixler, replacing him at the fan.
Mixler rose and immediately left the dobe.</p>

<p>Shiraz followed him. Both men stood in the blackness of the
parade. Mixler kept fumbling his hands around his pockets. He
blurted out: "She hates me for being away, Shiraz. By God, that's
hard to take."</p>

<p>"What else could you expect? That's the time when a woman
wants her husband to be somewhere nearby&mdash;most women. And it
is a time when you should expect no reasonableness at all from
her, which is the way nature made it. But she'll get over
it&mdash;she'll understand."</p>

<p>"No," answered George Mixler. "No, she won't." And suddenly
Shiraz was shocked to hear this big young man crying.</p>

<p>Shiraz stepped up and hit him on the shoulder, "And you're not
the first man that's done that, either, George. I reckon every
man and woman in the world think that their baby is the first
time such a thing ever happened. It's always the same. You come
along with me for a good stiff drink."</p>

<p>Castleton moved through the shadows, his feet briskly striking
the loose boards. Mixler pulled himself together, seeing the
faint blur of Castleton's curious face. Castleton said: "Anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>It was the brusque way he spoke the words that turned George
Mixler and stiffened him, and made him rap his answer
friendlessly back. "No," he said, and walked on with Shiraz.</p>

<p>Castleton stopped at the doorway, looking through. He put his
shoulder against the dobe's edge and listened to the steady, in-
and-out crying of the baby, watching Eleanor pull at the fan
until her glance lifted and saw him. He made a gesture with his
hand.</p>

<p>Harriet turned faintly on the bed. "Never mind, Eleanor. The
air seems just as hot when you move it. I wish I were up in the
hills, at Fort Apache. I don't think the baby can stand
this."</p>

<p>Lily Marr moved around the room, silent and capable. She ran a
wet towel across Harriet's face and changed the pillow; her hands
smoothed back Harriet Mixler's loose hair. She looked down at the
girl, a kind of gentle sternness along her lips, a calm and
unhurried faith in her voice. "He will live. Nothing's as bad as
you think."</p>

<p>Harriet murmured: "You're both mighty kind. I wish it were a
girl. I'd name it Lily Eleanor. What good's a boy to me? One
thing I swear&mdash;he'll never be a soldier, and drag his wife
into some godforsaken place and leave her alone when she needs
him."</p>

<p>"Harriet," said Eleanor, but quit on that, knowing nothing
could be said now to this tired, bitter girl. Lily Marr stepped
back from the bed and saw Castleton beyond the door. She stared
at Castleton and when she turned again her face was unstirred and
without expression, showing nothing at all; in a way it was like
a withheld judgment. She moved over to Eleanor and took the rope
guiding the fan, relieving Eleanor.</p>

<p>Eleanor joined Castleton, but for a moment she paused to watch
Lily Marr, trying to find in her mind words to define the
impression that girl left in the room; Lily Marr's hand, gently
pulling the rope, was square-knuckled and strong. She stood
straight-shouldered and faintly full at the breasts, watching
Harriet with inexpressibly calm lips. She was smileless, as
though she had forgotten how to smile, as though some knowledge,
iron-hard and gray and fatalistic, had changed her beyond
laughter. She had said nothing of herself to Eleanor; she was a
mystery. Yet in her was an indomitable reliance, a still, strong
acceptance of all that she had seen and all that she had been
through. She was, Eleanor thought, a woman who had bent to the
necessity of living, who carried the scars of that bending; but
who would never break. She was stronger than anything that had
happened to her.</p>

<p>Eleanor walked along the parade, thinking of this while she
held Phil Castleton's arm. She was tired from a day and a night
of constant attendance in Harriet's room, and she was lonely with
odd thoughts that she wanted to express and yet knew Phil would
not understand. He said, dryly:</p>

<p>"Your Lily Marr is a versatile woman. Where did she get that
knowledge?"</p>

<p>"Where did I get mine?" answered Eleanor.</p>

<p>"I love you for your courage," he said and stopping he took
her swiftly inside his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>She laughed and pulled away, feeling the release of that
moment. Some of the trouble went out of her and the smell of this
night was keener and more pleasant. "You do have your moments of
insight, Phil," she murmured. "I really needed that."</p>

<p>He said, quickly: "I love you for your courage, Eleanor, but I
hope you never have to do a thing like that again. For a refined
woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>She heard the strong distaste in his tone, his sense of
injured propriety. She said: "You are telling me it wasn't lady-
like, Phil."</p>

<p>His voice stiffened. "There are certain rather dismal parts of
life that are better left alone."</p>

<p>"It would never make me afraid to have my own children, if
that is what you mean."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't mean that at all. Great Scott, Eleanor, what a
thing to say. But I hated like hell to think of you in
there&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Phil," she said, "you mustn't be narrow. Don't ever be. I'm
glad I was there. As for Lily, she's a wonderful girl, whatever
her past may have been."</p>

<p>The distinct dryness came back to him again. She noticed how
he reverted to that tone when he wasn't pleased. It troubled her,
and it roused her temper a little. He was saying: "I think your
tastes are too generous, Eleanor."</p>

<p>"I'm an army girl, Phil."</p>

<p>They had reached the south side of the quadrangle. He stopped
to face her, "You have said that before. Maybe I don't
understand. What is it you mean?"</p>

<p>"I have never been afraid of anything that is real, Phil. I
don't ever want to close my eyes or ears. I don't want to be
blind, I don't want to hide. Living is too much fun. It is only
when we start running away from it that we grow old and very
proper, and very dull." She paused, trying to find a better way
of saying what she felt so deeply; and failed. How was it
possible to express the keenness of living as she felt
it&mdash;the vividness and the sharpness of each day's
impressions, the singing, tumultuous force of her imagination?
How could she express her own hungers and desires? She looked at
him in growing anxiety, knowing that his own conception of her
was of flowers and lace and softness&mdash;of something she could
never be.</p>

<p>He said in the same brief voice: "If it weren't for your being
here post life would be damnably dull. I shall be glad when my
turn comes to go out on scout."</p>

<p>This, she realized, was his only answer, He hadn't understood,
and he wouldn't change. He would wait for her to change. She
walked on with him, keeping time with his pacing, silently making
her adjustments, out of necessity. A woman in love, she
reflected, had this hard way to make&mdash;to conform and to
bend. She was coolheaded enough to realize how ridiculous his
opinion of her would have seemed, if she were not in love. But
she was bound to him and couldn't help herself; and so her life
was no longer her own. He was saying: "I think the present policy
regarding Indians is foolish. How can you tame a savage? They are
all alike. Nachee is no better than Antone. They are all tricky,
all cruel. But I think we are unduly afraid of them and move too
slow. Give me thirty men and I'll track Antone clean into
Mexico."</p>

<p>"Phil," she murmured, "you must not be so impatient."</p>

<p>He stopped again. He was stirred as he had not been before.
His talk came out, quick and half-harsh, burning with his own
eagerness. "This army is a morgue for a man's ambitions! We get
into a rut, we drift, we sit around waiting for a fellow ahead of
us to die. We quit trying, for fear of making life uncomfortable
for the rest of the officers. Not me! I'm damned if I sink into
the routine like that. I will not be a gray-haired captain thirty
years from now."</p>

<p>She said softly: "How far do you wish to go, Phil?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer her at once and then she knew that he was a
little embarrassed by his own ambition&mdash;that he hated to
show her how deeply he felt, for fear that she would see weakness
in him. This was what had drawn her so swiftly and inevitably to
him at seventeen&mdash;this hard man's pride and this almost
arrogant ambition. At twenty-one she still felt the power of that
rash pride; but the years had tempered her judgment and now,
gently silent, she knew she had to help him over the roughness of
his own will.</p>

<p>He said finally, in a more moderate tone, "To the top,
Eleanor. Why not? There's only one end to this road and why
should a man be content to make just a halfhearted fight of
it?"</p>

<p>"Then," she said, "I'll help you get there. I know this army
inside out. And an officer's wife can make or break him."</p>

<p>He was laughing as he turned; and when he kissed her again,
rough from his feelings, she was satisfied to have it so. Only,
in the far corner of her mind she felt that he had carelessly put
her offer aside, as though her help was something he didn't need.
He had this kind of pride. When he got a little older, she
reflected hopefully, he would grow more tolerant. And then he
would see. Distant in the corner of her mind a faint flash of
critical judgment tried to warn her that he would never be
different than he was now; but a sudden swing of loyalty to him
put the thought aside. She walked quietly around the quadrangle
with him, said good night, and returned to Harriet Mixler's
place. George Mixler was at the doorway.</p>

<p>He said in a half whisper; "She doesn't want me in there. You
sleep in the other cot with her tonight, Eleanor."</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, and touched his arm reassuringly.</p>

<p>An officer's wife could make or break a man; and Harriet was
slowly breaking George Mixler. Watching him walk back toward the
sutler's store, she saw the down-slope of his shoulders and felt
regret. She turned in and relieved Lily Marr, bathed Harriet's
white face&mdash;in which the memory of her past hours remained
like a permanent mask&mdash;and undressed for the night. She was
up two or three times during the succeeding hours to watch the
baby; afterwards its steady crying wore off and she fell
asleep.</p>

<p>Around three in the morning the return of Benteen's messengers
woke her. Lying in the darkness, feeling a faint coolness in the
air, she listened to men cross and recross the yard until she
realized that a new detail was going out. She rose and slipped on
her robe and stood in the doorway, watching lanterns flash
through the black. Troopers were forming on the parade, and
Castleton kept calling at Sergeant Hanna, and her father's voice
crossed the darkness, drawing Castleton over. She heard him give
his instructions:</p>

<p>"You will take twenty-five troopers out for three days. Your
mission is to keep Antone moving, to wear his horses down and
make it impossible for him to rest or roast mescal. Mr. Mixler
accompanies you and Manuel Dura goes as guide. You will respect
Dura's judgment as to the best trails and as to the number of
Indians that may be in front of you. I am giving you a rough map
sent in by Mr. Benteen, It shows where he left Antone. You will
take up that trail, acting on the advice Mr. Benteen enclosed
with the map."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hanna's voice harked the shadows, The troopers were
counting off, mechanically, sleepy-voiced. Her father spoke again
to Castleton, quite soberly and putting insistence in each
word.</p>

<p>"Remember, these men are in your hands. Do not permit any
enthusiasm or snap judgment on your part to lead you into
premature fighting. Do not gamble, do not guess. Don't push your
command beyond its endurance. Above all, watch out for a trap,
Antone, will attempt to suck you into one. You must refuse to
follow him through any piece of country, no matter how inviting
it may look, unless you are dead sure your flanks are covered and
your rear protected. That is all. Good luck."</p>

<p>Castleton walked back across the parade, speaking to Hanna.
George Mixler came to the door of the dobe. He said in a low,
uncertain voice: "Is she asleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eleanor.</p>

<p>"Well," murmured George Mixler, his tone discouraged and flat,
"I won't wake her. Give her my love. Tell her I said good-by.
Tell her everything will be all right." He waited a moment, as if
hoping to hear his wife call out to him, then turned away. The
command mounted, crossed the parade as a shadowy column of twos,
passed through the gap between the bakery and the barracks and
struck the loose gravel of Aravaipa Creek. Eleanor listened to
that tramping rattle die out in the distance, troubled by Phil's
failure to come to her. Long after the last echo had gone she
turned back into the dobe. Harriet's voice rose, dead-bitter,
from the blackness.</p>

<p>"He knew I wasn't asleep. He just didn't care enough to kiss
me."</p>

<p>Eleanor said gently: "Would you have kissed him, Harriet?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

<p class="first">FROM the doorway of Harriet Mixler's house,
Eleanor watched Benteen's troopers cross the parade in the golden
glare of middle-morning and swing their jaded horses into line.
Weariness bowed the shoulders of the men and cramped their legs.
Sergeant McSween's voice, dismissing the detail, was a parched
croak.</p>

<p>Benteen went immediately to commanding officer's quarters and
remained with her father a quarter-hour. When he came out he
walked straight toward her, a slow smile breaking across lips
roughened by the sun. Fine alkali powder whitened the red stubble
of his three-day growth of whiskers. His cheeks seemed gaunt to
her, his eyes more deeply recessed. The trip had dried him out;
it had enervated him. Even in smiling he showed her a drowsy
fatigue, But she was thinking that it was good to see him. His
presence was like reassurance, and then they were as before, a
little gay with each other, seeming to understand each other.</p>

<p>She said: "We have news. Harriet's baby came."</p>

<p>"We passed Phil's detail around sunup," he said. "George told
me about it." He looked at her with a distinct approval in his
eyes. "You're all right, Eleanor."</p>

<p>She returned his smile. "Was there a doubt about that, in your
mind?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No. Never was a doubt. Can I see
Harriet?"</p>

<p>She led him into the house. Harriet lay with her eyes closed,
her cheeks set in the same half-bitter firmness. The baby was
sleeping. Benteen bent his tall shape over it; the grin coming
sharp and white across his face again. He murmured, "Looks like
Harriet," and his voice opened Harriet's eyes. Benteen came
against the bed and put his big hand lightly on Harriet's
shoulder. He said: "Good girl." There was a raw red scar on the
back of his hand. It drew Eleanor's momentary attention but
afterwards she was watching the way this man had with a woman:
Harriet, so bitter and so full of hatred for everything that was
army, reached out and seized his hand and then she
smiled&mdash;and for that moment she was pretty and pleased and a
little like the Southern coquette she had once been. "I declare
I'm a sight to look at, Tom. Go 'way until I can fix up."</p>

<p>He kept smiling at her. He reached over and wound a lock of
her quite black hair around his finger. "George Thomas Mixler
wouldn't be a bad name for the boy."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Harriet, "it will be Thomas Mixler."</p>

<p>He said, "Now wouldn't that be somethin' to make old George
mad?"</p>

<p>Her smile faded and her mouth turned unhappy and desperate.
"Tom," she said, her hand pulling him down. He kissed her on the
forehead and straightened, and Eleanor, watching this through a
swift blur, noticed how gentle he was with her, how kind. He
said, "All Southern gals are flirts, Harriet. You let me
alone."</p>

<p>He left the dobe, ducking his head at the doorway. From her
place Eleanor watched him cross the parade. At this moment Lily
Marr stepped from the bakery shop, whereupon he lifted his hat to
her. Lily Marr came to the shaded walk along officer's row and
stopped. Her glance followed Benteen; her eyes were round and
grave and soft.</p>

<p>This was the middle of another hot day. At three in the
afternoon, with the full blaze upon the land again, Benteen came
to commanding officer's quarters and found Eleanor sewing on a
dress. One faint bead of moisture showed on the tip of her nose
and the exaggerated heat laid its rose stain on her cheeks. He
stopped in the doorway, loosely resting against it, so relaxed
that he seemed almost bony. He had slept and shaved, and suddenly
she saw the distinct expression of approval in his eyes. She had
never practiced the art of ladylike modesty, as taught by Mrs. De
Launcey's Boston School for Young Ladies, her army training at
once rebelling at the dropped eyelash, the breathless murmur or
the hand pressed across an agitated breast. Nevertheless she
looked down at her sewing, not quite sure of herself.</p>

<p>He said: "I'm going over to Nachee's camp. Can you stand the
sunshine?"</p>

<p>She rose at once, got her parasol and went across the parade
with him. "Sometimes," she said, "my own company isn't very
interesting. I'm glad you came along."</p>

<p>"Eleanor," he said, "Harriet and George are in considerable
trouble."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>They circled the barracks, cut through the corrals and crossed
the dry bed of Aravaipa Creek. Nachee's camp, with its brush-
covered jacals, lay a half mile down the San Pedro, within
hailing distance of the post; yet she noticed that Benteen wore
his revolver and that his glance kept rummaging the roundabout
clumps of cacti and catclaw. There was no security in this land,
not even in the full blast of a midday sun.</p>

<p>She said: "She's rather high-strung, Tom. And accustomed to
much more than an army post could ever give her."</p>

<p>"It's breaking George," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you blame her so much?"</p>

<p>He gave her a slow, smiling glance. "Why, no. It's hell out
here on a woman&mdash;and she's taking the change from civilian
life harder than most. I'm just a little bit afraid she won't
stick it out."</p>

<p>"Where did you learn about women, Tom?"</p>

<p>Afterwards she regretted asking the question, for she saw the
change it made in him. It took him back into his past life, it
pulled the smile from his face. She added at once: "I know. The
Southern girl. She would be dark and perhaps very quick, very
intense, perhaps like Harriet."</p>

<p>"That's a close guess. How do you figure it?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, judging and calm. "You are partial to that
kind. You are very fond of Harriet."</p>

<p>They walked on through the blaze of light, hearing the racket
of the Indian dogs in Nachee's camp. A few men sat on the shady
side of the jacals; a few women crouched in the bright-traced
shelter of a paloverde tree, grinding mesquite beans. Benteen
said: "All men carry the picture of a woman in their heads, the
kind of a woman they want. But it is usually a picture built up
of many women, not one."</p>

<p>"That's not very fair for the woman a man finally gets. How
can she live up to all that he wants?"</p>

<p>He was smiling a little. "When he finally gets his woman he
sees all the things in her that he wants to see."</p>

<p>"Then you are saying that love is blind."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, I should say that it is a very strong
light. Makes a man see things he otherwise wouldn't. There is
some sweetness and some honesty and a hell of a lot of self-
sacrifice in the worst woman that ever lived. Those are the
things a man finds in a woman, when he's in love."</p>

<p>"Until she hurts him," said Eleanor, watching his face for a
break.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "That's part of the bargain, the
quarreling and the bitterness. The sand with the sugar. I'd
rather have it that way than a lifetime of dullness. People want
too much."</p>

<p>"Why, Tom," she broke out, "you are saying the things I have
always said."</p>

<p>He looked at her, not quite smiling. "I know."</p>

<p>"How could you know it? I've never talked to you&mdash;not
about that."</p>

<p>They approached the first line of tents. Children came from
the jacals and stood around, silently watchful. Benteen stopped
and turned to her. There was always on his face a kind of
speculative reserve. He had a way of holding his long lips
together, smileless and yet on the edge of a smile, and a way of
looking at things or people, absorbing them but seeming not to
pass judgment, as though some things mattered and many things
didn't. She was near enough to see the flakiness of his gray
eyes; they could be hard as stone or they could be, as now, the
most considerate pair of eyes she had noticed in a man.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have to talk of those things, Eleanor. Look in
your mirror tonight. Now let's play Nachee a visit."</p>

<p>He turned her into the first jacal, into a hot, rancid-
smelling gloom. Blankets and robes made beds around the edge of
the shelter, occupied by squatted and sprawled figures. One man
rose to a sitting position and said "Nantan," and motioned to the
floor. A squaw came from the rear shadows and threw a gray army
blanket on the floor, whereupon Eleanor sat down in obedience to
the slight pressure of Benteen's hand. Benteen dropped to his
haunches, not immediately speaking and in this interval Eleanor
took her first deliberate look at Nachee, chief of the peaceful
portion of the Indians on the San Pedro.</p>

<p>She judged he was as old as her father, but he had a round and
entirely smooth face, full-lipped and quite kind. A narrow band
of red calico crossed a broad forehead to hold in coarse jet-
black hair; and though he wore only a shirt&mdash;whose dangling
tails made him look a little ludicrous, a breechclout and
moccasins with turned-up toes, she was distinctly impressed with
the dignity he carried. His eyes were cloudy brown.</p>

<p>She knew enough of Indian etiquette to preserve the silence
and to remain grave before all the inquiring eyes around her; but
it did surprise her when Al Hazel slipped into the tent a few
minutes later and took his place somewhat between Benteen and
Nachee.</p>

<p>"Tell Nachee his last advice was very good," instructed
Benteen. "Tell him I thank him for it."</p>

<p>Listening to Al Hazel, Eleanor made out little coherence.
Apache was a quick, loose language and Al Hazel spoke it as if he
held a chunk of mush in his mouth. Now and then he used his
hands, or drew swift descriptive lines with his finger points.
Finished, he listened carefully to Nachee's answer.</p>

<p>"He says you must be careful of Antone. Antone is very sly.
His father was a fox, his mother a wolf."</p>

<p>"Tell him we have heard there are many men in Antone's camp,
some of them Tontos and some of them Chiricahuas. Is this true;
and how is it so?"</p>

<p>Waiting through Hazel's question and Nachee's reply, Eleanor
saw the intent, owl-wide eyes of a small girl peeking in through
the cracks of the jacal. Nachee's hand cut downward graphically
to describe something. Al Hazel turned back to Benteen.</p>

<p>"It is true. The Chiricahuas have come up from the border
because Antone has persuaded them he has the medicine to kill
soldiers. The Chiricahuas are very bad. You will have to kill
Antone before you can bring in these others and make them
peaceable."</p>

<p>"Ask him how far Antone will travel east, if the troops
follow?"</p>

<p>Hazel asked it and got this answer. "Nachee says Antone will
never travel very far east. He will keep circling back, toward
the south, keeping his eyes on the soldiers all the time. But if
you don't let him stop to rest he'll grow tired and then his
warriors will leave him. That is when he will make a fight, so
that his warriors won't think him a coward."</p>

<p>After that Nachee spoke again, nodding toward Eleanor.</p>

<p>Al Hazel pushed back his hat and grinned behind his hand.
"Nachee says this wife is very good but a man of your standing
ought to have more than one. He says one wife wears out too
fast."</p>

<p>Eleanor, who considered herself a calm girl, opened her mouth
and shot a startled glance at Benteen. He had maintained, through
all this talk, an unstirred countenance. It did not change now
but when he spoke again it was directly to Nachee. Eleanor felt
the heat of this tent; it was worse than it had been before, it
began to burn on her cheeks. Nachee was a grave and philosophical
and tattered figure in his blankets, but she thought she saw the
glint of humor in the obscure depth of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Enju," said Benteen and terminated the interview by rising
and giving his arm to Eleanor. They left the village and Al Hazel
behind, crossing the rock and cactus-scattered flat.</p>

<p>"Why do you sometimes use an interpreter and sometimes do
not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know enough of it to carry on an extended
parley."</p>

<p>She looked at him. "What did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"I said you had another man."</p>

<p>She looked up and saw the complete indifference on his
face&mdash;and she realized he had put it there deliberately to
hide something; and then, because she knew that this was so, she
spoke out.</p>

<p>"It was a complete answer, Tom. I have another man, and am
quite satisfied&mdash;though Nachee wouldn't know what that
meant, would he?"</p>

<p>Dust rose along the upper sand bed of the San Pedro, signal of
a horse coming by the base of the Catalinas. Benteen, and Eleanor
walked on, saying nothing more, and soon reached commanding
officer's quarters.</p>

<p>She turned to him at the door. "Come in and I'll fix some
lemonade."</p>

<p>He followed her into the room. Major Warren lay on the corner
couch with a month-old <i>Harper's Weekly</i> covering his face.
The paper fluttered gently to his profound snoring. Both of them
went quietly back to the kitchen. Benteen sat up on the table,
his long legs swinging down, so turned that he commanded a view
of the parade. The solitary horseman came off the San Pedro and
reined up in the shade of the troopers' quarters, dismounting
there. Benteen watched the man loosen the saddle cinch and settle
on his heels against the barrack wall. He pulled off his hat,
rubbing away the fresh sweat on his head and, afterwards, casting
a long glance around the parade&mdash;in a manner that was full
of lively caution&mdash;he settled to the business of building a
cigarette. From this distance Benteen couldn't see his features
clearly.</p>

<p>Eleanor handed him his glass and poised her own. "Salud,
Tom."</p>

<p>But he waited, not lifting the glass, holding her eyes for a
moment. His lips were thoughtfully pinched together. Behind his
smooth expression something ran its way, something boiled and was
pressed back. She saw the little details of his face then, the
heavy, black-red line of his eyebrows, the faint break at the
bridge of his nose, the scar on his temple which was from a
"Minie" ball&mdash;so Cowen had told her&mdash;at Bull Run.</p>

<p>He said: "To the other man, Eleanor."</p>

<p>She had a quick answer for that. "I wish you knew him
better."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"If you knew him you'd like him. You don't now."</p>

<p>He said: "You're a damned loyal woman."</p>

<p>She considered her words carefully. "Maybe it is as you said.
Maybe it is because, being in love, I see things you don't
see."</p>

<p>"Salud," he said, and tipped the glass.</p>

<p>Major Warren strangled on his snoring and woke, dashing the
paper aside with an irritable arm. He rose and came into the
room, scanning them with hot, bloodshot eyes. He rasped, "Hot
enough to melt the hinges of hell's bronze doors," and went out
to douse his head in the water bucket. He came back, accepting a
fresh glass of lemonade from his daughter; he swallowed it
greedily, some of the drink spilling down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Mr. Benteen," he said, "the paymaster is at Fort Lowell. You
will take an escort of six men in the morning and go get him. I'd
send Lankerwell, but he's to go out on the next scout with
Captain Harrison." He freshened his glass and stirred the
lemonade with the tip of his forefinger. "Who's that over by the
barrack?"</p>

<p>"Some cowpuncher off the San Pedro," said Benteen and turned
out. Eleanor followed him as far as the doorway, and Major
Warren, turning his fat body reluctantly about, watched those two
with a sharp, smart attention. Benteen continued on across the
parade. Eleanor stood at the doorway, and Warren, who was no
fool, noticed that even if she was in love with Castleton, this
tall officer of I troop had the power to attract her eyes.
Nuzzling his whiskers into the lemonade glass, he thought about
this and called his daughter back to him.</p>

<p>"You have never seen Tucson. Maybe you'd like to go along with
Benteen. It will be a five-day trip. Rough, but better than
sitting around here. Maybe you'll get a chance to attend a dance
at Lowell, or maybe Benteen will take you to a Mexican
<i>baile</i>. Wish I was young enough to do that again. By God,
it is hot! Think you want to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Be a break in the monotony for you," he answered and looked
at his glass. For she was smiling at him; she was a damned smart
girl and she was reading his mind, and laughing at him.</p>

<p>Benteen crossed the parade to supervise afternoon stables.
Coming on toward the barrack he noticed the stranger's bright and
careful eyes lift to him. He was, Benteen decided, just one more
stray rider, one more vagrant shadow from the hills or the
desert. The territory had a good many of these men, most of them
with unexplained pasts and mysterious occupations. This one had a
dry, half-handsome face, smooth-shaven and fairly light of
complexion in spite of the sunshine. He had pushed his hat far
back on his head, to show a clump of yellow hair.</p>

<p>He was very watchful. Benteen, stopping by him, noticed that
his whole figure, motionless as it still was, seemed to tighten.
His eyes were a pale, calculating blue.</p>

<p>"From Summerton's?" asked Benteen.</p>

<p>The stranger stared at Benteen and his very brief "No" had a
grudging arrogance in it.</p>

<p>"If you're hungry," stated Benteen, "go over to the mess shack
and tell the cook I authorized a meal."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the stranger. "But if I was hungry, I'd eat my
own grub."</p>

<p>Benteen let the obvious dislike slide by, nodded, and went on
to the stables. The man's unfriendliness toward the army was the
reflection of a common attitude on the frontier. These civilians
in the territory wanted protection, but many of them disliked the
kind of law that went with it. They were a tough, headstrong lot;
and some of them feared the uniform&mdash;any kind of uniform.
Benteen dismissed the man from his mind for the next hour but
later, when he left the stables and cut around the breaking pens
in the last late flash of the day's sun, he saw a scene that
stopped him in his tracks.</p>

<p>The stranger had gone over to officers' row and stood now by
Harriet Mixler's dobe, facing Lily Marr who had her back to the
dobe's wall. He held his hat in one hand and he was speaking,
using his free hand persuasively. Benteen observed that the girl
made no kind of an answer. She remained still, shoulders pressed
against the wall, as if afraid or as if angry. Presently the
stranger reached into his pocket and produced something, offering
it to Lily Marr. When she made no move to accept, the stranger
jerked her hand toward him, slipped the gift into it and waited.
Lily Marr flung the gift downward to the dirt.</p>

<p>This was when Benteen moved across the parade, his long legs
traveling fast. The stranger wheeled around at once. Benteen
observed the wire-tight expression on the man's cheeks, and the
white-hot temper in his eyes. "Captain," he said in a way that
was a thorough warning, "we're doin' well without your help."</p>

<p>Benteen spoke to Lily Marr: "You know this man? You want him
around?"</p>

<p>There wasn't any fear on her face that he could make out. Her
reserve held; it was definite and cool. She said: "I know him but
I don't want him. Tell him to pick up his money."</p>

<p>Five gold pieces lay in the white dust. For a moment Benteen
considered them, remembering the robbery of the Summerton wagon
train. He had no proof of this man's connection, but as he turned
to the stranger he saw the look in the other's eyes&mdash;the
quite bright and quite deadly attentiveness; Benteen said: "Pick
up your money and go along."</p>

<p>"Captain," said the stranger, "I never took an order from a
man in my born life. Or from a woman either. Or from anything
that breathed."</p>

<p>The stranger had a gun and would use it. Benteen was sure
enough of the man's character to know that. But the insolence and
the wild pride was a little thick for him and so, since he was
close to the stranger, he whipped his long arm out, seized the
man's arm, hauled him in with a hard yank, and seized the
holstered gun. He was angry, suddenly and deeply; and felt no
scruples at all. He threw the man's gun back into the dust,
grabbed him by the shoulders with both hands and shook him until
he heard his teeth clack together; and threw him flat to the
dust.</p>

<p>"Pick up your money and go along," he said again.</p>

<p>The stranger was face down and half knocked out; he lay
motionless for a moment, his fingers dug into the loose silver
dust. McSween and a pair of soldiers ran over from the barrack
and the guard on this post swung forward with his gun brought
down. Ray Lankerwell stepped from post headquarters, buckling on
his belt as officer of the day.</p>

<p>From her place in the doorway of commanding officer's
quarters, Eleanor Warren had seen it all&mdash;the brief exchange
of talk and Benteen's swift punishment. She didn't come forward
with the others but watched Benteen with a fresh, startled
interest, now knowing something she had felt but never had seen,
which was his capacity for anger. This then was part of the man.
This was a part of all those turbulent things hinted at by the
grayness of his eyes and the long calm of his lips.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Benteen reached down and retrieved the stranger's
revolver and turned to Lily Marr, observing her stillness and her
expressionless gravity. He realized she knew more about this man
than she was telling. There was a story here, in her and in the
stranger and in the gold pieces scattered on the ground. He put
his attention back to the stranger who had risen to his knees. He
said, "Do as you're told, friend," and watched the stranger reach
into the dust and recover the gold pieces, Afterwards the man got
to his feet, brushing himself aimlessly. It wasn't until all this
was done that he lifted his face to Benteen. His cheeks were dead
white and his eyes had turned the color of slate.</p>

<p>Benteen turned to McSween. "See that this man waters his horse
and leaves the post." He pulled up the stranger's gun, kicked the
loads from it, and handed it back.</p>

<p>The stranger didn't look at Lily Marr again, or at the
surrounding men. His glance clung to Benteen with a memorizing
hatred, telling Benteen as clearly as speech what he felt and
what he someday intended to do. He said, "All right, Captain,"
and walked away with McSween behind him. "All right, Captain. All
right."</p>

<p>The group broke away, leaving Benteen with Lily Marr. Benteen
said: "You know this man pretty well, Lily?"</p>

<p>"He knew I was in that wagon train. That's why he held it up.
But I got away in the dark. He will kill you, Mr. Benteen."</p>

<p>He said "What?" and made a half turn after the stranger. Lily
Mart's voice stopped him at once.</p>

<p>"No. I wouldn't speak against him, Mr. Benteen. I'd never tell
what I know."</p>

<p>"He's a killer, Lily."</p>

<p>"Oh that," she said and shrugged it away, as if it meant
nothing. "That's because people have tried to kill him. His name
is Jack Bean and everybody knows he's an outlaw. But nobody knows
as much about him as I do."</p>

<p>"What'd he come here for?"</p>

<p>"For me, Mr. Benteen. And he'll come again;"</p>

<p>He studied the impenetrable reserve of her face and knew he
could ask no more. She was a dark woman, a woman with a gray and
odd wisdom, with a strange realism completely governing her. He
said, "All right, Lily," and walked away.</p>

<p>Lily Marr's attention turned toward Jack Bean a moment, as he
rode out of the post. Then it veered to Benteen, following his
high shape as it cut through the first violet eddies of twilight.
She laid her shoulders against the dobe wall, softly sighing. Her
eyes were, at this moment, round and wide and expressive.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

<p class="first">EIGHT hours' march brought Phil Castleton to the
retreating trail of Antone in the broken hills northeast of
Grant. Manuel Dura said, after a considerable scout, "They go
north, maybe to the Pinals, maybe into the Apache Mountains."
Before sundown they pushed over the Gila and made camp. Manuel
Dura went ahead, returning considerably after dark. "In the
Pinals, I think, The trail say so, though I would not believe
only that. It is that Antone like the Pinals and maybe got mescal
pits up there."</p>

<p>"How old are those tracks?"</p>

<p>"Four hours, mebbe."</p>

<p>It was the nearness of Antone's band that caught hold of Phil
Castleton and turned him hard and eager. Lying in his blankets,
he watched the distant crystal wash of the stars and the thin
moon hanging low and smoke-yellow in the sky, and was impatient
because of the night's long delay. He felt no weariness, hard as
the ride had been; his ambition keyed him up, it was a quick and
constant stimulant, like food, like whisky. The troopers were
blanketed down tor the night, their talk drowsily carrying on
some old, indecent joke. Rising to an elbow he saw Trooper
Sweeney still crouched by the faint firelight, long-lipped face
turned into a huge grinning. Sweeney said: "The rocks are hard.
It ain't the same as quilts and a mattress. Hey. Canreen? No
quilts for you tonight. What wud Rose be doin' now, hey
Canreen?"</p>

<p>Somebody said: "Talkin' nice with Harry Jackson. Sure."</p>

<p>"Hell, the kid ain't got that much green in his eyes."</p>

<p>"Ye saw him use the sword on Canreen. Young wans are like
that, thinkin' things that ain't so. Hey, Canreen, why don't Rose
tell him?"</p>

<p>Canreen grumbled from his blankets. "I'll be doin' the
tellin'."</p>

<p>"Sure," jeered Sweeney. "And then you'll get somethin' worse
than a beatin' around the head."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Sweeney, if ye don't want that mouth spread a foot
wider."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hanna broke in. "No more of that tawk. As for Harry
Jackson, let the boy find it out for himself. 'Twill be a bad
enough time, let alone wan of you Irish apes rubbin' it in."</p>

<p>But Sweeney murmured: "Maybe it ain't him tonight. Maybe it is
Daugherty. She likes 'em with a smilin' way&mdash;and with a bit
o' money."</p>

<p>Phil Castleton laid his order flat and sharp across the night.
"That's enough talk. If you're not tired enough to sleep I'll see
you get a longer ride tomorrow."</p>

<p>Silence fell&mdash;the stony, obedient silence that only
sullen men could contrive. He felt their dislike, he felt the
unspoken insolence&mdash;and waited for some least murmur from
anyone of them, so that he might at last lay on his punishment.
But there was no break in the stillness; their mockery was
elusive, beyond his reach. Lying back on his blanket and saddle,
he knew what they were thinking of him, as he had known it since
his first days with the command. There were a hundred ways a
soldier could make a young officer feel the weight of enlisted
displeasure&mdash;in wooden words, in impassive expressions, in a
kind of obedience that was too exact, neither one gesture more or
one less. Between that fire and his own blanket was a gulf he
could never cross.</p>

<p>He had never been able to figure out the reason, and, now had
ceased to care. But there were times when he wished he had the
power of stepping back into the ranks so that he might do as
Hanna sometimes did, which was to take a malcontent behind the
latrine line and smash respect and the fear of God into him.</p>

<p>This was the way he felt as he lay there watching the stars.
He had no fear of them, and little tolerance. He had no way of
telling these men of the ambition that fired him, no way to
arouse their enthusiasm and their loyalty. In the beginning he
had hoped to have this chiefest gift of an officer, to so stir
men that they would follow him out of blind zeal, wherever he
led. Now he knew he could never do that; and though it left him a
little lonely, it had also served to toughen him. These men who
would not serve him from liking would serve him because he drove
them harder than any officer in the detail. He was not, he told
himself again, a man like Benteen; and that thought, coming idly
to him, at once set up all the old heart-burning animosity. This
was the core of it, this was the natural injustice Phil Castleton
never ceased to feel&mdash;that this lank, lazy officer who
seemed to dream little and to have no ambitions should, by the
gesture of a hand, bind the enlisted men fast to him; and having
that gift, should ignore it. This was the thing that turned him
resenting and so jealous. Long after the camp had fallen asleep
Castleton remained awake, made irritable and sleepless by his
ambition, made lonely by it, turned a little brutal by it.</p>

<p>Next day they followed Antone's trail along the eastern base
of the Pinals, traveling deeper into the broken pocket country,
traveling higher into the general hills. At noon Manuel Dura
said: "They rest here. Fresh trail. Maybe hour old." Thereafter
Castleton pushed his detail on without rest. Horse droppings
showed freshly on the trail; the smell of dust still clung to the
heated air. At five o'clock that day a canyon opened before them,
its hundred-foot walls pinching in a shallow clattering creek and
a narrow trail weaving around man-tall boulders. A kind of
permanent twilight lay in there. Manuel Dura stopped at once,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>"In there."</p>

<p>"How far ahead of us?"</p>

<p>"Maybe hour, maybe just around bend. I don't know. Very close,
I think maybe."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"Maybe twenty go in there. Maybe more by now." Manuel Dura
watched Castleton and saw something on the officer's face that
troubled him and caused him to point toward the rock walls
overhead. Small inset pits studded these walls to either side;
the parapets hovered directly above the trail. "Too bad. She's a
nice place for trap."</p>

<p>A quarter mile on the canyon the walls bent and carried the
trail out of sight. Castleton watched that bend. "What's
beyond?"</p>

<p>"Mile, maybe, same thing. She comes out then into little
meadow. More hills after that."</p>

<p>Castleton pushed the sweat across his face and stiffened his
legs against the stirrups. Nobody spoke. Hanna's eyes, old and
black and faithful, watched him. Hanna waited, but he knew Hanna
didn't like the canyon; he knew none of them liked it. He washed
that consideration out, his impatience growing stronger. Antone
was down that canyon, maybe within rifle shot. Antone was growing
tired. He balanced the thought against his orders, which were to
take no chances against a trap and to return at the end of three
days. The second day was up and it was another day back to Grant.
Yet he had his few hours of grace and, looking at the rock wall
above him, he saw nothing to check his eagerness. He had little
respect for Apaches; he had nothing but a desire to close in and
end the chase, and thought now he saw the chance of doing it.
Antone, he reasoned, would never believe that a cavalry detail
would follow through the canyon. Castleton pulled up his reins.
"All right. Forward."</p>

<p>Mixler stared at him. Dura's swarthy face came around, openly
surprised and dissenting, "She's not good. We better go around,
up this hill, come down far side."</p>

<p>Castleton's natural impatience broke out. "Never
mind&mdash;never mind." The truth was; though he did not quite
realize it, he resented the knowledge both Dura and Al Hazel had
of Indians, and the manner in which they used that knowledge to
caution the post officers. It was his conviction that all
civilians on the frontier had built up the Indian scare in order
to keep troops on hand, thereby profiting from the selling of
feed and supplies, and from the vast freighting business built up
from post to post. Mixler was beside him, and Mixler's long
silence further irritated him.</p>

<p>"Any suggestions?"</p>

<p>Mixler shrugged his shoulders. "You're in command, I
believe."</p>

<p>Castleton lifted his gauntleted hand overhead, motioning the
detail to follow, and entered the canyon at a quick walk.</p>

<p>There was still a half hour of sunlight but as soon as the
detail got into the canyon a solid twilight settled around the
detail. Watching the high boulders in front and the small
recesses above him in the canyon walls, Castleton was at once
bothered by the thickness of the shadows. The dashing of the
creek and the clatter of the horses on the stone under-footing
made a strong racket. For a moment he had his doubt, and for a
moment it was his inclination to turn back. What checked the
impulse was the memory of Dura's skeptical expression, and
Mixler's dislike, and the opinion of the troopers. They were
watching him now; it was too late to change. He could not permit
any of them to see any confusion in his mind. But the feeling of
this place was bad. The farther the detail progressed the
narrower the canyon seemed and the more smothered Castleton felt.
He caught himself eyeing the overhead rim; he found that his leg
muscles were pushing against the stirrups. Suddenly, near the
bend, Sergeant Hanna clattered through the creek and cut in front
of Castleton.</p>

<p>Castleton snapped: "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>Hanna's old-soldier's face, bronzed and hard-boned, swung
toward the lieutenant. "K troop has fawrty enlisted men and three
officers. 'Tis better arithmetic that wan enlisted man get shot
than wan officer."</p>

<p>"Get back," said Castleton, and pushed past Hanna.</p>

<p>Beyond the bend was only the graying vista of water and stone
and the blank wall of another bend in the distance. Above them
the bright light suddenly left the sky and at once shadows packed
down into the gorge layer on layer until nothing was clear but
the ragged dance of the water on the rocks. The high rims were
blackening silhouettes. Wind scoured faintly through the canyon
but sweat collected under Castleton's hat brim and gushed along
his nose and eyebrows when he lifted it; his nerves were thin-
drawn wires pulling at his fingers, at his shoulders, and at his
neck. Somewhere was a sound that was not the sound of water or
traveling horses. He said, "Halt," and listened, swung forward in
the saddle.</p>

<p>Dura's voice came forward; softly hurried. "Eef Antone is on
that rim, he weel be thinking of rolling rocks down now. I would
not stop, lieutenant."</p>

<p>Castleton shoved his horse forward. The trail bent again and
the walls closed in until this canyon was no wider than the
length of a horse. Trail and creek squeezed past black shoulders
and then, beyond this point, Castleton saw the fresh clear
twilight of a meadow beyond; the canyon walls broke away. He held
his horse to a walk, crossed the creek and stopped in the
meadow.</p>

<p>"Hanna, we camp here. No fire tonight."</p>

<p>The gates of a pass opened west of the meadow, leading upward
into the Pinals. To the east other and shallower canyons fed into
the wild, dark hills. Behind lay the now dark maw of the canyon
through which they had just passed. Castleton dismounted and
turned his horse over to an orderly, watching the troopers stack
arms and make cold camp. Manuel Dura crossed and recrossed the
meadow, low-bent in the shadows. Presently he returned.</p>

<p>"They stop here and go on. Up there now, maybe." He pointed to
the broken-black tangle of the hills eastward.</p>

<p>Castleton looked at Mixler, a tinge of irony in his tone. "I
have always thought that Apaches were over-rated, Antone is a
better fugitive than a fighter."</p>

<p>All Mixler said was, "I should hate to have been caught in
that canyon, Phil."</p>

<p>"He wasn't there," pointed out Castleton. "He will never stop
to make a fight. We are being held back by a fear of something
that doesn't exist."</p>

<p>Settled on his blanket, he listened for the drowsing talk of
the troopers and didn't hear it. They lay silent, and in that
silence was something sullen and dissatisfied and bone-tired.
Sentries moved along the outer shadows, their feet grinding
against the creek's gravel. This air was cool coming off the
higher hills; and somewhere an owl hooted once&mdash;and was
answered from another part of these hills. He saw Manuel Dura
rise off the ground, listening. The sentries quit walking and
silence poured in, heavy and mysterious until he too felt the
strain of it The owl call didn't come again.</p>

<p>Castleton turned on his side, adjusting his head to the
saddle. He was sleepless once more, begrudging the length of the
night and hating this delay. Antone was nearby, less than an
hour's good march away, Which was a knowledge that tantalized him
and played on his restlessness until he sat bolt upright and put
his big hands together and stared at the felt-black shadows. At
this moment he was thoroughly alone, turned hungry and solitary
by the intense pressure of his ambition; turned desperate by it
until he had the senseless desire to reach out and seize
something and break it between his heavy arms. For some men, he
thought, life meant a struggle for power and place. This was what
it meant to him, He had no patience to drift. He could not stand
waiting his place in the slow mill of promotion. The fire in him
had to burn; it had to find a way through. And this, he knew in
deep, sudden bitterness, was why he had no friends among his own
rank; and, no loyalty from his men. He drove too hard. He wanted
success too badly. Other men laughed and made their lives easy.
Because he could not stand these things and would not fit into
the routine, he was disliked. Once he had seen the commanding
general of the army. In the general's eyes was something taciturn
and aloof, as though he saw and knew things other men could not.
Castleton had not understood that expression then, but now he
did. That solitariness, that tightness around the mouth, was the
price a man paid for reaching the top&mdash;for all the
sacrifices and all the hard decisions, and all the lifelong
discipline to a driving purpose.</p>

<p>He dropped his head to the saddle again, thinking of Antone's
nearness until Antone became the elusive key to his whole career.
He knew then that, given the gamble, he would risk himself and
his whole command.</p>

<p>He fell into a shallow sleeping and woke around three o'clock.
This was the day to turn back, according to his orders, but he
had still one hope, and so routed out his command, let them
finish a cold breakfast, and put them in the saddle. Manuel Dura
said, still not quite awake. "It is better we take another trail
back to Grant."</p>

<p>"Not yet. Which way did those tracks run last night?"</p>

<p>"East," said Dura.</p>

<p>"We go east."</p>

<p>The troopers traveled in a solid file behind him. At first
light they had reached a rising ridge above the meadow and faced
a country crosshatched by pine-scattered draws and turning
gulches and rocky mounds. Dura had his look at the ground and
came back thoroughly awake. "The sign is plenty. They meet here
yesterday. See that peak? Maybe there now. Thirty&mdash;forty,
<i>quien sabe</i>?"</p>

<p>A defile with ragged sidewalls marched toward the peak in the
northeast; the cobalt shadows of dawn whirled around the land,
eddying like water, tricking the eye and giving motion to the
country, beyond. "That way, Dura," said Castleton.</p>

<p>Dura's horse threw up its head and sidestepped in the trail.
Dura studied the ground with a quick attention and saw nothing
there to cause the disturbance. He lifted his head, eyes almost
shut, staring forward. He said: "Do not take that way,
Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"What do you see?"</p>

<p>Dura shrugged his shoulders. "I see nothing and I do not like
it. But that trail she is a trap."</p>

<p>"Turn left, toward that barrier of rock."</p>

<p>Manuel Dura spread his arins. "A bad place."</p>

<p>Castleton gestured with his arm and crowded past Dura, The
peak was his target, in the east. The barrier of rock, which was
a six-foot breastwork heaved up by some ancient stirring of the
earth's crust, lay a quarter mile forward; to either side the
land rose in broken hummocks. Castleton put the column into a
trot, aiming at the lowest section of the rock barrier.</p>

<p>Mixler swung abreast, his light complexion turned pink by the
sun. "Is that yucca growing along the edge of those rocks?"</p>

<p>The steady run set up a racket of iron hoofs on the solid
ground. Saddle gear creaked and Hanna's voice was heavy behind
Castleton: "Close up, Flynn!"</p>

<p>"Hah!" rasped Dura and hauled his horse in. His arm whipped
straight forward. The clumps of yucca along the rock rim moved
and fell away&mdash;and became round black heads. A first shot
broke the morning, its echo rocketing all up the hillsides. A
faint wisp of smoke rose.</p>

<p>Castleton called: "Skirmishers!"</p>

<p>Hanna's voice beat at the troopers as they rushed along a
long, broken line abreast Castleton. Mixler flung his horse
around and rushed to the right of the line, his ruddy face alive
and eager and suddenly pleased. A quick firing broke from the
rocks, the smoke showing the Apaches to be scattered along the
parapet. Castleton, taking his swift survey, thought there was an
empty spot over toward the left of that parapet and promptly
rushed for it, signaling his men to follow. It whirled the
troopers into an irregular grouping; and this was the way they
crossed the front of fire. A horse went down, throwing Trooper
Sweeney far forward against the stony soil. He turned and kept on
rolling until he reached a dip of earth and fell into it.</p>

<p>On that side toward which Castleton rushed, a series of broken
hummocks rose rather sharply. Driving in toward the end of the
rock parapet, Castleton came close to the hummocks and at once
felt the cross-whip of lead. Antone's warriors showed themselves
briefly in the spaces between the hummocks, fired, and fell back.
Castleton wheeled, raced at them with his revolver swinging up
for a shot. Hanna galloped behind, Mixler, making the complete
circle from one side of this area to the other, brought on the
last laggard men; they raced between the hummocks. Antone's
warriors ducked in and out of sight, firing as they moved. Hanna
and O'Grady, close together, rode an Apache down beneath their
horses, looking behind to see him flat and dead on the earth.
Mixler galloped around the base of a hump, came point-blank
before a tall Apache with a carbine already lifted to fire.
Mixler threw his horse aside and felt the breathing smoke of the
carbine's explosion and, targeting the brave with his revolver,
killed him with the shot.</p>

<p>It was a tight and wicked moment, the troopers rushing at the
successive hummocks without order or direction, firing at the
fugitive shapes around them. The Apaches kept fading and
reappearing, from pocket to pocket; they gave ground and were
lost, and reappeared again. The Indians stationed at the rock
parapet were streaming forward from the rear and the right flank.
Manuel Dura saw this first and, slipping off his horse, he ran to
the crest of a hump, flattened against it and coolly targeted
this new rush of Apaches with his carbine, aiming and firing with
unexcitable method.</p>

<p>Mixler, circling a hump, discovered Dura at this business.
Immediately Mixler called up the nearest troopers, rushed up to
support Dura and dismounted. One man held the horses while the
others dug in. Mixler's face was rose red and his blue eyes were
bright, almost laughing as he settled down. He said: "No hurry.
Be sure you hit something, or don't fire."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Castleton had gotten deeper in the broken country.
Apaches kept retreating before him, vague as shadows. He fired
and missed his aim. An Apache dropped out of sight and Castleton,
seeing the warrior's intent of circling the hummock, yelled at
O'Grady nearby. "Go around that side!"</p>

<p>O'Grady made a rush at the hummock's other edge while
Castleton circled his own side. His horse went into a pothole and
climbed out at the moment O'Grady galloped dead into the Apache's
thrown-up gun. The bullet hit O'Grady in the chest, knocking him
out of the saddle. Castleton's bullet killed the Apache. Rushing
on, Castleton saw O'Grady's dead face turned toward the first
brass-yellow flash of sunlight.</p>

<p>The Apaches were shadows that vanished: There was nothing now
to be seen around the potholes. Wheeling back, Castleton saw
Apaches trotting away from the fight, in a country too rough for
cavalry to follow safely. Over in the clear ground the racket of
the carbines kept going; all the troopers were rushing in that
direction.</p>

<p>Coming around the last hummocks, Castleton saw the main
section of Antone's band break back for the rocks, those brown
bodies squirming through the apertures and out of sight; but one
Indian raced toward the hollow where Sweeney lay, reached down
and stabbed Sweeney to death and ducked away. A dozen bullets
ripped the ground around him and caught him and knocked the life
out of him. Galloping to the highest hummock Castleton watched
Antone's band reach their horses in a far hollow and race back
toward the peak.</p>

<p>A few last shots followed them, but in a moment the pines and
the rough country hid them entirely. Troopers rose from the
ground, walking loose-jointedly along the uneven earth. Hanna
came up and stood at the head of Castleton's horse. Sweat hung in
bright balls at the ends of his mustaches; his shirt front was
gray with dust. His old soldier's eyes turned to Castleton,
reserved and waiting&mdash;and full of things Castleton could
feel.</p>

<p>"What would the lieutenant be wantin' now?"</p>

<p>Castleton watched the slopes of the far peak, seeing his
chance of capturing Antone fade entirely. There could be no
pursuit in land like that, formed as it was with pine thickets
and rock pits against a steep climbing grade. The sun rose, red-
hot in the sky, his rations were only for three days, and his
horses were jaded from the steady pushing through the rough
country. All this he knew with a bitter disappointment. And had
he not known it, Sergeant Hanna's black eyes would have told
him.</p>

<p>Corporal Oldbuck called: "Sweeney's a dead one."</p>

<p>"So's O'Grady."</p>

<p>These men stood around, the excitement of the encounter
fading, leaving them loose and weary. Castleton felt the dull
judgment in their heads; he heard it in Manuel Dura's voice when
the guide sauntered up.</p>

<p>"Maybe now you theenk Antone can fight, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Hanna," said Castleton, "we turn back. Tie Sweeney and
O'Grady to their horses."</p>

<p>He rode away from the men, down to where Sweeney lay on his
back with two long knife slashes through his bloodstained shirt.
Castleton didn't dismount. He sat forward, watching Sweeney's
face, curious to catch the shadow of some expression. This was
his hard moment, to know that he had led Sweeney and O'Grady to
death. This was when he realized how eagerly he had fallen into
Antone's trap. He had no particular conscience about the matter,
no regret, for this was the risk he took along with the rest of
them; this was what soldiering was for. But he knew what Major
Warren would say, and what the post would say, and how his men
would be judging him. He sat there, thinking of it, turned harder
than he had been, enraged and made a little mad by failure. It
was the failure that mattered.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

<p class="first">ELEANOR and Tom Benteen, with a detail of eight
men, left Grant before sunrise and camped that night in the
gloomy jaws of Gold Canyon where, not long before, Apaches had
slaughtered the Kennedy-Israel party. The following morning they
reached the desert floor west of the Santa Catalinas and struck
southwest into a yellow-blue heat haze. All in the surrounding
distance was the smoky outline of peaks and buttes rising from
the flat plain. Northward, the black summit of the Pinals and the
lesser summits of the Mescals and the Tortillas. Westward lay the
Picacho, marking the route of the mail stage line.</p>

<p>Along this route were evidences of the Apache scourge in the
shape of mounded graves, old and new, scattered at frequent
intervals, to mark the sudden end of Mexicans, stage-drivers,
ranchers and prospectors suddenly ambushed. A blackened square
showed where a ranch house had been; the bleached bones of a
horse lay beside the metal fragments of a wagon. Summer's sun was
a melting ball in a spotless blue sky and heat waves danced in
gelatin layers along the cactus-studded soil. Gradually the low-
lying shape of Tucson lifted from the plain and at sundown that
day the party crossed the parade of Fort Lowell on the edge of
town. The commanding officer's wife, Mrs. Bursom, immediately
took Eleanor in charge. "You will join us for dinner, Mr.
Benteen," she added. The troopers moved to the stables, and Tom
Benteen reported to the paymaster.</p>

<p>"I shall be ready to leave in the morning," the paymaster
said. "Incidentally, there's a Mexican troupe in town tonight,
playing 'Eleana and Jorge.'"</p>

<p>Benteen repaired to the post's bachelor hall, cleaned up, and
returned to Colonel Bursom's quarters for dinner. Afterwards, in
the soft, hot desert twilight, he escorted Eleanor into
Tucson.</p>

<p>"This," he told her, "is the Mecca of the Southwest. There is
nothing like it from San Antonio to San Diego, except perhaps
Prescott up in the Mogollon range. But Prescott is strictly
American, This is almost straight old Mexico."</p>

<p>At this half-light and half-dark hour a soft quiet lay over
the town. There were no streets to speak of, only casual alleys
threading the scatter of single-story dobe houses, along the
walls of which strings of drying peppers hung colorfully. The
dust was ankle-deep. Near one livery stable a water trough's
overflow created a deep mudhole, and in this a hog lay, nothing
but his eyes and snout showing. The church of San Antonio stood
in the center of a plaza, its steeple and cross standing high
over the low dobe dwellings. Around this plaza were shops and
saloons and the long, windowless warehouses of the freighting
merchants. In front of them canvas-topped wagons were banked,
idle after their long runs to Missouri, to California, to Guymas
and Hermosillo, deep in Old Mexico. They passed the rankness of
the Munoz corral, they skirted the lighted windows of saloons,
hearing the restless bubble of talk and the clatter of chips and
the call of the roulette croupier. Beyond this, as darkness
settled down, they followed the broken remnants of the old wall
which once, in the time of the padres, had kept Tucson a safe
haven in the heathen wilderness of northern Mexico.</p>

<p>Vesper bells were ringing. People moved through town, toward
the quartermaster's corral. Candle lights gleamed out of doorways
and the softness of Spanish talk was pleasant to hear. Darkness
came down and the mystery of the desert pressed in. Eleanor took
Benteen's arm, keeping step with him. "It is," she murmured, "a
million miles to anywhere."</p>

<p>He felt the rhythm of her body, he was conscious of the sweet
smell of her hair. Long afterward he said: "If I ever left the
army, here's where I'd stay. In the Territory."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why," he said, surprised at being pinned down, and not quite
finding the right words, "I like the desert. I like the hills. I
even like the heat."</p>

<p>She said; "Well, that is the kind of a man you are, Tom."</p>

<p>They recrossed the plaza in front of the church. Then he said,
"What kind?" and was really puzzled.</p>

<p>She didn't answer him directly. She stopped, coming in front
of him, looking up to him with her hand still on his arm, A
quarter-moon threw its soft light across her face; he saw its
breadth, its strength, and the dark, unknown things lying in her
eyes. "Do you think you'd ever leave the army?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not by choice. Only if a bullet or an arrow ruined me. It is
always a possibility a man has to consider."</p>

<p>He said it in a thoroughly impersonal manner, as if it were a
contingency that didn't much matter. He had, she recognized, a
broad streak of fatalism in him. Many things didn't matter to
him; he shrugged them away, he closed his mind to them. It was
odd that this should be the way of so vital and so physically
strong a man. Once, she guessed, he had been hotheaded and
restless&mdash;now and then she saw its remaining force, as in
the scene with the outlaw, Jack Bean. But he had been through the
Civil War as a boy, and had toughened on the frontier; and it had
made him older at twenty-five than most men would ever be. This
was what made him so brief-talking, so indolent. This and one
other experience, she added at once to herself: The Southern girl
had done the rest of it. The Southern girl had taken all of him
and had given back very little. She wondered then how much he
still loved that woman; and because she was very curious, she
said gently:</p>

<p>"Well this is Southern, too. You like the South."</p>

<p>"Without magnolias and honeysuckle," he answered. "No more of
those."</p>

<p>They crossed the plaza, threading the little alleys near Ochoa
and DeLong's freighting warehouses. Mexicans were going ahead of
them, toward the quartermaster's corral; all laughing and soft-
talking people. Eleanor said: "Are you really that bitter about
it?"</p>

<p>"If I were bitter," he said, "It would mean I hadn't
forgotten, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"You haven't forgotten. I know that much."</p>

<p>"No," he said "I haven't. But I'm not bitter."</p>

<p>"You think of her a great deal," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"I think of many things. I remember a cavalry charge in '63. I
think of the smell of the swamps around Richmond when we were dug
in&mdash;rotten and full of malaria. Water moccasins slid around
your boots and scared hell out of a man. I think of the sound of
the Minie balls at Gettysburg, at Little Round Top. I think of
the time Mr. Lincoln came down to camp to see McClellan.
McClellan kept drilling the army and not doing anything and Mr.
Lincoln wanted to know why. Mr. Lincoln was very tall and his
stovepipe hat added another foot and he was dressed in old
clothes that made him look like a scarecrow. Little Mac was small
and very neat. I think of a drink of buttermilk a little girl
handed me one day in the summer of '62. This was in the
Shenandoah valley. She was ten years old and her father was on
the Confederate side with Lee. But she gave me a beautiful curtsy
and flirted with her eyes. We gave her a salute when we rode on."
He looked down at Eleanor with that slanting expression which was
so near smiling and so near irony. "That's what I think of. Just
pieces of action and little scenes that don't mean much. Put them
all together and that's my life."</p>

<p>"No," she murmured. "You think of her. When you are quite
tired. At night. When you are lonely."</p>

<p>He said, "Your eyes see too much, Eleanor," and led her into
the quartermaster's corral. Cottonwood saplings had been thrown
across the corral for seats. At the end of the corral a row of
burning torches indicated footlights. A barrel, a wagon, and a
watering trough comprised the stage, on which the actors waited.
The admission, the polite young Mexican said, was fifty cents for
the citizens, but a dollar for the distinguished Americanos.
Benteen paid and escorted Eleanor to the least uncomfortable
cottonwood he could find. All the youngsters were down front,
making a great racket, Elsewhere sat the men of Tucson, a
sprinkling of soldiers and the black-eyed Mexican girls with
their ever-present duennas, their cheeks plastered with the
customary flour-paste cosmetic. An orchestra&mdash;flute and
guitar&mdash;made a desultory effort to rise above the
considerable confusion and presently ceased. A broad Mexican came
before the footlights, adjusted his serape and harangued the
crowd in Spanish, made a low flourish and retired, whereupon the
actors took station, struck their postures with heavy theatrical
license, and "Eleana and Jorge" began in the shape of an
extremely tearful scene between a rich uncle and his sorrowing
niece.</p>

<p>"This uncle," explained Benteen, "is a mercenary old scoundrel
who intends to sell his niece Eleana to a rich French officer who
is a poltroon of the first rank, Jorge is a poor but very brave
Mexican officer who loves Eleana. Of course Eleana loves him. It
is very pathetic. But maybe love will win."</p>

<p>Eleanor smiled at his tone. He had turned pleased and gay and
skeptical. The cottonwood log made a perilous bench which was the
reason Benteen hooked his arm through the crook of her elbow,
meanwhile vigorously applauding Eleana's unintelligible but
highly dramatic speech. The rich uncle departed and Don Jorge,
hiding all this while behind the barrel, sprang up to the
tremendous cheers of the audience, made his impassioned
declarations of undying love and stalked behind the wagon; at
this juncture the French officer, leering and effeminate, rose
from the barrel and minced forward.</p>

<p>A storm of hatred rose from the cottonwood benches.
"<i>Muere&mdash;Muere</i>&mdash;May he die!" Benteen clapped a
hand across his mouth, emitting strong whoops of approval. At the
end of the first act Benteen and Eleanor munched edible quinces,
listening to the constant clack of the cigarette-smoking duennas.
More troopers lined the rear of the corral, the music struggled
feebly against the racket and the tar flares made a smoky,
saturnine light against the black Arizona night. A frail little
Mexican girl with eyes as round as dollars flirted behind her
duenna's back at a youth with a dramatic face in the shadows. The
second act showed the cowardly French officer's temporary
ascendancy and Don Jorge's departure to death or glory: The
second intermission brought a payozo, or Mexican clown, to the
stage waving a Mexican flag and chanting death to foreign foes.
By this time both Benteen and Eleanor were thoroughly hungry.
Benteen bought steaming-hot enchiladas and chocolate and both of
them ate their late supper while the third act confounded the
French cad and the avaricious uncle and brought Don Jorge and
beautiful Eleana to the center of the stage in happy embrace.
Tucson, man, woman and child, stamped and shrieked its
approval.</p>

<p>Benteen guided Eleanor through the crowd. "Everything comes
out right and now we go home to sleep in exhausted contentment.
Could opera night in New York be any better?"</p>

<p>"I thought Eleana was a little buxom," said Eleanor.</p>

<p>"The Spanish taste," said Benteen. "Anyhow, she has to be
buxom to stand three acts behind those footlights. Must be a
hundred and ten Fahrenheit up there." Turning from the crowd,
they swung the long way home, back through the devious pathways
and plazas of Tucson.</p>

<p>In passing from the corral he had not noticed Sergeant McSween
in the shadows nearby. But after he had gone McSween swung around
and stared into the semidarkness near the quartermaster's shed.
Jack Bean stood there, and had been there during the last half-
hour, closely watching Benteen. Presently Bean turned into the
night whereupon McSween ploughed his way through the crowd of
Mexicans, following Bean at a careful distance.</p>

<p>Benteen and Eleanor, slowly pacing this bland, hot night, came
again to the church plaza. A few late worshipers came out and
went away; the crowd straggled through the formless streets and a
group of horsemen galloped from town. Men filed into the saloon
on the far corner of the plaza and the lights there grew
brighter. Eleanor settled on the church steps, pulling Benteen
beside her. She laced her fingers together, around her knees,
watching the high, brilliant stars and the capsized outline of
the quarter moon. Silence settled across Tucson, a soft,
smothering wave.</p>

<p>Benteen rolled a cigarette and lighted it, the smoke trailing
fragrantly into the still air. He sat loosely on the steps, his
long legs sprawled before him; he was, she thought, as thoroughly
relaxed and at ease as a man could be. His face had softened from
its habitual expression of disinterest and for this moment she
was sure he had forgotten the past.</p>

<p>"Eleanor," he said, "this is damned pleasant."</p>

<p>Her presence, she thought, did this to him. But immediately
the instant pleasure of that knowledge was qualified: her
presence, or any woman's presence. For she was an army girl and
she knew how hunger built up in a man until the nearness of a
woman was the strongest temptation in the world. Even for Tom
Benteen. He was a solid man, strong and physically alive; he had
his thoughts, he had his desires. The memory of the Southern
girl, clear as it might be to him and as near as it might be,
wasn't enough. He couldn't live with that pale shadow.</p>

<p>She murmured: "How far are those stars?"</p>

<p>"Too far."</p>

<p>"How near," she whispered, "could we get, if we tried?"</p>

<p>"Why try?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I know you better now. You don't mean it.
You cover everything up."</p>

<p>He breathed in the cigarette smoke and expelled it. She heard
the long sweep of wind in his chest. "Eleanor," he said, "don't
be too curious about me."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I want you to know what's inside."</p>

<p>She spoke in the gentlest, most wondering voice. "I won't be
able to help that, Tom. I think any woman would be curious about
you. Harriet is. Lily Marr is. Should I be different? Remember,
we will be in this regiment most of our lives. As long as you are
a line officer and Phil is a line officer. Twenty years at least.
That means we'll all be thrown together. You two hate each other.
I see it very clearly. When I marry Phil I shall take his side,
of course. But I know you both rather well, and I'll never be
able to hate you at all. It will be hard, for me. Do you
see?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer. He sat with his elbows on his knees, his
head dropped forward and the smoke of the cigarette spiraling
around his face. His lip corners had a tough, sharp set. She
watched him with the closeness that could come only of deep,
personal interest; his expressions and his mannerisms, the very
manner in which his long fingers hung down, registered in her
mind. He had a man's reticence and a man's rough humor; he had a
man's thorough temper hiding behind his silence, sometimes gay
and sometimes hard and hot as fire.</p>

<p>She said: "I should try to do something about that: But you
and Phil are the whole world apart and never will be any closer.
I'm sorry. It will make our lives difficult. We shall have our
troubles."</p>

<p>"I have thought of that," he agreed. "The trouble will not
come from me. Been wanting to tell you that the last day or
so."</p>

<p>She said, quickly: "I wish you'd marry."</p>

<p>He looked around at her, surprised and on the edge of smiling.
"Now why?"</p>

<p>She didn't smile back. Soberness held her face dark and still.
She reached out and held her hand toward him until he took it.
Her fingers closed around his palm, suddenly strong; holding to
him, pressing some of her thoughts into him. She silence went on
like this, full of unexpressed and puzzling emotions. Abruptly
she drew her hand away.</p>

<p>"I do not believe I can tell you why, Tom. I don't believe I
should. I don't think it would be very clear to you&mdash;or to
me. But it would put an end to one thing. And that, I think,
would be good for all of us. Does it mean anything at all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Maybe it does."</p>

<p>Somewhere in town a Mexican boy was serenading the window of
his own particular love. The melody of his guitar drifted through
the thick desert silence, the sound of his voice was quite clear,
singing:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"No me mires con esos tus ojos,<br>
Mas hermosos que el sol en el cielo,<br>
Que me mires de dicha y consuelo,<br>
Que me mata! Que me mata! Tu mirar!"</p>

<p><br>
From his position in the shadows of a dobe across the plaza,
Sergeant McSween saw Benteen and Eleanor as two close-placed
shadows in the vague moonlight. The sight stirred him and the
song got into his Irish heart, and he stood there, patient and
watchful, and did his own particular wishing, for a moment
forgetting why he was here. Then he remembered and turned his
attention to a sharp black line under the porch of the Shoo-fly
restaurant. This was Jack Bean.</p>

<p>Eleanor said: "I have been thinking of what you said, about
leaving the army. Short of death, you never will leave it. It is
your kind of life. You would never be happy in any other."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I never would."</p>

<p>She went on in her clear and sweet and judging voice: "I don't
believe the slowness of promotion worries you. I don't believe
you think about that much. I don't believe you ever have the
heartburnings that other officers have. Yet this will happen to
you, Tom. Promotion will come to you. Do you know why? Because
you are a natural officer. You live and breathe the army. Your
men feel it and the officers feel it. I've watched officers since
I got old enough to notice. Some men do the right thing because
it is just in their makeup, or in their blood. They were born
with it, I guess. Some men have to learn it all. The gift is
yours&mdash;without even thinking of it." She paused and drew a
long quick breath, listening to the fading melody of the distant
singer. "Would he be mentioning love, Tom? Let's walk."</p>

<p>They rose and crossed the plaza, close together under the
vague shine of moonlight. Fort Lowell's gate lay northward but
they paced slightly and slowly southward, on out toward the
silver-shining border of the desert. Deep down there behind the
black mountain masses lay Mexico; eastward the near peaks of the
Santa Ritas cut heavy chunks from the sky; and all around was a
loneliness and the smell and hint of sharp danger. The Mexican
boy's song had entirely faded. Behind them, though they didn't
know it, Jack Bean walked; and behind Bean came old Sergeant
McSween, moving like a cat in the dust.</p>

<p>Eleanor said: "What was her name, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Lucy."</p>

<p>"Pretty, and Southern. Is she married now?"</p>

<p>"I never found out." he said.</p>

<p>"You should."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it would close a door. It's open now and you keep
watching it, thinking maybe someday she'll come through it."</p>

<p>He stopped, pulling her around. His voice was quite troubled:
"You see a lot. Don't rummage through me like this. Why should
you be curious? You've got a man."</p>

<p>"You should do something else," she said in the same, even
way. "You should either go to her or get her out of your head.
For a man like you, Tom, an old lavender and lace memory is
bad."</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said. They paced on, saying no more. They rounded
the entrance to the fort gate and went through it, quietly
circling the parade. The sentry's hour call ran from post to
post: "Three o'clock and all's well." Suddenly Benteen was softly
laughing in the deep darkness.</p>

<p>"Eleanor, it is a damned short time till reveille!"</p>

<p>"It's been fun."</p>

<p>He stopped again, touching her arm. She came about, seeing the
blur of his face, the black cut of his shoulders against the
night. She knew he wasn't smiling. She knew what was in his mind.
He said: "This is the way it ought to be. A little fun. A lot of
riding. Something to cry about. Something to remember when it is
all over." The pressure of his hand grew greater, pulling her in.
She had lifted her head and her two hands came against his chest,
without resisting pressure. This was the way she stood when he
kissed her, heavy and long and hungry. If she had never known
what was in the heart of this man before she knew now&mdash;the
wild run of his temper, the force of his will. It came out, it
broke through; it was, suddenly, something that passed over to
her.</p>

<p>He stepped back, softly speaking. "Regrets?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "No regrets. It has been a lovely evening,
Tom. What did you say&mdash;something to remember when it's all
over."</p>

<p>They walked straight across the parade, up to the porch of
Colonel Bursom's house. Suddenly Mrs. Bursom's voice rose from a
corner. She said, faint acid in her tone, "I think it is about
time."</p>

<p>Eleanor Warren was laughing. The sound of it ran gaily into
the night. "About time. More than that, I think. Past time. Good
night, Tom."</p>

<p>He turned down the steps, angling toward the gate of the fort,
and she knew then he would be going back to Tucson to a saloon.
She knew what he'd do. He'd draw a chair up to a poker game and
order a drink, and sit low and loose in the chair, remembering.
This was the kind of release a man of his kind had to have. There
was too much inside him. Somehow it had to come out. In a kiss,
in a drink, in a fight.</p>

<p>Sergeant McSween watched Benteen and Eleanor go into the post,
and followed. But he hadn't gotten far along when he heard the
sentry challenge again and heard Benteen's answer, outbound.
McSween turned himself wearily around and passed the sentry,
trailing Benteen back to the saloon near the church plaza. He
stood in the black solid shadows, with his shoulder points
flattened against a dobe's wall. Inside the dobe a man slept with
a heavy snoring, and somewhere in this town a child's high thin
cry echoed out. From the saloon came the steady undertone of
drowsy voices and scraping feet. A Mexican stepped from the
saloon, adjusted his serape more securely over a shoulder and
walked across the plaza with a drunken man's extreme care. These
were the only lights showing; elsewhere the mealy blackness of a
desert night clung to earth and wall and sky, against which the
cross of the church spire cut its immemorial shape. McSween, who
was one of the faithful, watched the cross and had his own
thoughts. Afterwards, looking back to the saloon, he saw Jack
Bean.</p>

<p>The outlaw came slowly along the wall of the saloon and
stopped before one of the green painted windows. Little glints of
bright light showed where the paint had flaked away. Bean put his
eye against one of these, looking in. He stepped back, traveling
as far as the door. Here he paused so long that McSween thought
he meant to enter. It was clearly in the outlaw's mind, and the
impulse teetered him toward the door until he shoved his hand
against it and pulled away. Continuing along the wall, he cut
around the saloon's corner, toward its rear. To the observant
McSween nothing could have been clearer than Bean's purpose. This
big black Irishman left the dobe, came up to the saloon and
started for its rear, in the opposite direction Bean had
chosen.</p>

<p>Inside the saloon, Benteen walked to the bar and signaled for
a drink, which he took straight and quick. Afterwards, carrying
bottle and glass with him, he moved to the lunch counter. He
spooned a helping of chili out of a hot kettle into a bowl,
spread a slice of sweet Sonora onion, as large as a saucer,
between two pieces of bread and settled comfortably to a late
meal. To a man who had averaged twenty miles of riding a day for
the past six months, hunger was something always close and always
real. There wasn't any fat on him. He scarcely knew the feeling
of a full stomach; the constant activity of his life swiftly
burned the food he took, and left him hungry again.</p>

<p>It was for him pure comfort to stand spraddle-legged at the
bar, his elbows resting on it while he ate the chili and the
onion sandwich, sampled a platter of enchiladas and finished his
drink. He lighted a cigar, drawing in the strong smoke with a
keen relish, and turned and hooked his arms over the bar to
consider the room with a well-fed humor. There were times in a
man's life when little things gave him his greatest
moments&mdash;a drink of pure cold water after a blistering ride,
the tremendous softening of a man's body when he dropped flat to
the ground after a long run up a hill slashed by rifle fire, the
taste of a dry biscuit to a razor-sharp appetite, the biting
flavor of a cigar after long abstinence. These were the simplest
things in life, but none of them were free. A man had to earn
them by sweat and hunger and fatigue. That was why they were
good.</p>

<p>It was then past three o'clock, two hours short of the time of
starting back to Grant. He considered the poker tables a moment,
thoughtfully and with an inveterate poker player's eagerness, and
moved toward a vacant seat. In the middle of the room, he
stopped, suddenly knowing he had no taste tonight for play. It
was this quick and this strong&mdash;the recollection of Eleanor
Warren's body swaying toward him in the vague moonlight, her
rising lips, and the echo of her gently suppressed laughter. He
moved out of the saloon and headed for Fort Lowell's gate, and
had taken a dozen paces when a voice, even and very hard, hit him
in the back.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Captain,"</p>

<p>He knew the man, even as he turned. He remembered that tone.
The green-stained light of the saloon window ran a sickly glow
across his path and for a long moment he could not see beyond
it.</p>

<p>"Here, Captain," Jack Bean said, in that same thorough cold
fury. "Here."</p>

<p>Benteen's eyes saw the vague shadow Bean made in the mouth of
the ragged alley beyond the saloon. The outlaw stood near a dobe
wall, the blackness of the wall dripping on him, covering him
with its formless substance. And it was the man's voice, crowded
with the memory of his humiliation at Grant, that told Benteen
what was soon to happen, He stopped his turning, grinding his
heels into the loose dust, watching Bean's motionless shape. He
held his arms down by his side, at once outraged for not having a
gun on him; and his mind was made up when Bean spoke again.</p>

<p>"You see me now, Captain? I never shoot a man in the back. I
always give a man warnin'. You see me now?"</p>

<p>Benteen bent his knees and shoved himself across the green
lane of light, low and fast, turning to the right as he plunged
forward. Jack Bean's gun threw its round blossom of light and its
shattering racket into his face. The breath of the lead touched
him. There was a shadowy twenty feet between them, and the
projecting edge of the dobe fifteen feet away, a shelter if he
reached it. He swung in toward the dobe, seeing the muzzle light
spread again. But his mind changed and, with the dobe wall right
before his arms, he suddenly refused the shelter, cut wide of it,
and crashed into Jack Bean's swinging arm.</p>

<p>He tasted powder. Jack Bean's gun exploded in his ears, but he
caught the man's arm and carried it up and back until he heard
the grind of gristle. Jack Bean's finger, jammed in the trigger
guard, exploded a last shot at the sky; and then Benteen's long
palm wound around the barrel, holding it out of range. He carried
the outlaw back against the dobe wall and raised his knee and
smashed him in the stomach. Bean's wind belched out, his free
fist caught Benteen on the jaw corner, scraping skin; for a
moment the two of them heaved and turned and wrestled along the
wall in bitter silence.</p>

<p>McSween's voice bawled up the street: "I'm comin', Lieutenant!
I'm comin'!"</p>

<p>They reached the corner of the wall, staggered around it into
the pure darkness between this dobe and another. Benteen brought
up his left hand, sledging the base of Jack Bean's jaw. They
whirled on backward, with the outlaw's wiry shape bending and
whipping. Benteen was hit on the side of his nose; the outlaw's
sharp boot-heel cut down across the arch of his feet and left its
fresh, livid pain. Benteen kept smashing his shoulder into Bean,
kept throwing him backward and twisting the overhead gun. They
came against another dobe wall, Bean's head cracking against the
dried mud; Benteen caught the man's small waist and dragged him
away from the wall and with a circling heave, battered him into
it again. Bean's gun fell and his knees buckled under him. He
capsized into Benteen's arms, Benteen hit him twice in the belly,
got him by the neck and dragged him back along the alley.</p>

<p>McSween stood here with his own revolver lifted. "By God, I
couldn't fire, Lieutenant! You were in the way!"</p>

<p>Benteen sucked the thin and hot and insufficient air into the
bottom of his lungs. Bean, half strangled by Benteen's crooked
arm, kept lunging against the ground with his feet, he kept
trying to turn and break free, his arms sliding slow punches
against Benteen's neck. Benteen got into the green lane of light
and threw the outlaw against the saloon wall. McSween targeted
the dark muzzle of his revolver dead between Bean's eyes and
spoke with a throaty softness: "Be still, sonny, or I'll blow
your brains against the saloon."</p>

<p>Jack Bean's eyes were slate-black against the surrounding
paleness of his skin. The green light showed this. Blood dripped
down the corner of his lip and a round spot, like a burn, began
to flush up behind his ear. "Captain," he ground out, "I'll be in
this country a long time, and I never forget." Then he let out a
hard, furious cry. "You damned fool, why didn't you use your gun
instead of runnin' into me?"</p>

<p>"What gun?" said Benteen.</p>

<p>Bean stared at Benteen, "I knowed you didn't have a holster,
but was you crazy enough to walk around Tucson without a gun of
some kind in your pocket?"</p>

<p>"No gun," said Benteen. "Now you pull out of here."</p>

<p>Bean said disgustedly: "I never brace a man unless he's got a
gun. How in hell was I to know? Listen, Captain, you better carry
a gun. Next time I call I won't wait."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said McSween, "there will be no next time.
Lieutenant, I had better take a walk with this man, A little walk
beyond the town."</p>

<p>"Captain," said Jack Bean, a driving anger in his tone, "you
made a mistake layin' your hands on me. No man ever did that. I
propose to kill you."</p>

<p>"Walk along," said Benteen.</p>

<p>Bean unhurriedly brushed himself and turned into the church
plaza. McSween grumbled under his coal-black mustaches and
waggled his revolver at the retreating figure. Benteen looked
down at himself, and saw the shreds of his gray shirt hanging
about his waist. He grinned at McSween and turned back to the
post gateway.</p>

<p>McSween waited until both men were buried in the dark.
Thereafter he holstered his revolver, staring up to the dim
silhouette of the cross on the church. Presently he walked over
the square and up the steps, into the church's open door.</p>

<p>"Now it has been a long time," he murmured, removing his hat.
"Whut would my mother be a-thinkin' of me so high yonder?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2> 11

<p>A DAY and a half beyond the limit of his orders, Castleton
brought his detail front into line on Grant's parade ground and
turned it over to Sergeant Hanna. The two dead men were lashed
crosswise on their saddles. For a moment he looked at them, his
eyes half closed against the glare of the sun. "Hanna," he said,
"put Sweeney and O'Grady in the quartermaster's shed. Send a
detail to the cemetery to open up a couple graves."</p>

<p>All the people of the post stood in the shade of the ramadas,
looking on. The detail was motionless, waiting dismissal, the
sun-inflamed eyes of all these troopers fixed on him. He felt the
sullenness behind that impassive glancing; he felt the silence of
the roundabout spectators; turning, he saw Major Warren waiting
at the doorway of commanding officer's quarters. Castleton left
his horse, stiffly crossing the parade. There was no expression
on Warren's round, heat-flushed face.</p>

<p>Castleton saluted. "I report back from detail, sir. We had a
brush with Antone's party in the Pinals. Privates Sweeney and
O'Grady were killed."</p>

<p>Warren said: "When you have washed up I wish to see you and
Mr. Mixler."</p>

<p>After dismissal George Mixler walked to his dobe, toward
Harriet who at once turned into the house. Lily Marr came from
the dobe, gave him a close look, and went on down the walk.
Mixler found Harriet in the bedroom. She stood at the rear
doorway with her back turned to him, its stiffness and its
squareness telling him everything he needed to know, He paused
over the crackerbox crib, studying the yellow and wizened face of
his son, seeing his small arms turn fretfully in a troubled half-
sleep. There was, he thought heavily, something wrong with the
child. He said in a hopeful voice:</p>

<p>"Everything been all right, Harriet?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. When he heard the hard, remembering bitterness
in her voice, a dullness traveled through Mixler. He went to the
kitchen, stripped to his waist and washed and shaved and put on a
fresh shirt. It took time and all the while he waited to hear her
step, to hear her voice changed back to the way it had once been.
For him there was something unnatural in her manner. He had the
actually terrifying fear that childbirth had unsettled her mind;
suddenly he had to see her face.</p>

<p>"Harriet," he said, "turn around."</p>

<p>Stony indifference held her still. It left him helpless, it
left him in a thoroughly defeated mood. But he spoke again very
gentle. "Is it always going to be like this, Harriet?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Not for long. As soon as the baby can travel,
I'm going."</p>

<p>"You're sure it's got to be that way?"</p>

<p>She came about, showing the set, white composure on her face.
He was a young man and his knowledge of women was limited to this
one girl; but he realized that her long dislike of army life and
her experience with the baby had at last changed her completely.
She was sane enough, but she was free of him. She had put him
aside. There was nothing in her eyes now to remind him of the
laughing impulsive girl be had married in Baltimore, The damage
was done. He had been away at the one time she had wanted him and
nothing he might say about the ways of the army would change
her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>There came to George Mixler, whose life had never been
complicated by any kind of real trouble, a grinding feeling of
injustice. He put his blond head down, setting his teeth tight
against the rough and terrible words he wanted to say. He said
them all&mdash;but to himself; and when he was done he looked up
to her, gentle again.</p>

<p>"You know best," was all he said.</p>

<p>Castleton was at the door, calling him. He joined Castleton,
going down the walk and stepping into the commanding officer's
house, Captain Harrison and Ray Lankerwell waited there with
Warren. Warren said: "Where did you leave Antone, Mr.
Castleton?"</p>

<p>"We followed his trail from the point near Trumbull butte,
continuing north into Castle Canyon. On the third morning we
started west from the canyon. About an hour's march we reached a
long rock fault. They were behind it. When we turned to skirt the
rocks we ran into another party in a very rough stretch of ground
to one side of the rocks. They made a brief stand and gave way,
west again toward the top of a hill in the direction of the
Apache Mountains."</p>

<p>"How many were in that party?"</p>

<p>"Dura said about forty."</p>

<p>Warren said: "Captain Harrison, take twenty-five men who have
not been on the last two details. You will leave after sunset.
Lankerwell and Manuel Dura will go along. Rations for five days."
Major Warren paused, looking hard at Harrison. "I want you to
keep Antone moving but do not permit him to pull you into a
trap."</p>

<p>Harrison nodded and stood there until Warren said, "That's
all." Afterwards Harrison and Lankerwell left the room. Warren's
eyes were very blue. He stood before Castleton and Mixler, a
round and normally comfort-loving officer who grew more
formidable with each moment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Castleton, I always give my officers the option of
judgment when they are on independent detail. What was your
thought in continuing beyond the limit of time I had set?"</p>

<p>"Antone was directly in front of me, sir. Never more than an
hour's march after we hit Castle Canyon. I thought it possible to
overtake him."</p>

<p>"Did you scout the canyon before entering it? Put flankers on
the rim?"</p>

<p>"No sir. I did not believe Antone would try an ambush there.
We got through it without a scratch."</p>

<p>Warren turned on Mixler: "What was your judgment when you
started into the canyon?"</p>

<p>Mixler flushed a little. He stared at the major. "I had no
judgment, sir. Never gave it a thought."</p>

<p>Warren let the answer sink into dead silence. These moments
ran on until George Mixler stirred his heavy legs and looked
down. Warren pulled at the ends of his mustaches, speaking again
to Castleton. "You got through the canyon and continued west
until you reached the rocks. Had you scouted the country?"</p>

<p>"No sir. Indian sign was very strong. We knew they were dead
ahead."</p>

<p>"You knew they were behind the rocks?"</p>

<p>Castleton remained stiff and straight in the room. His jaws
cut hard lines against his cheeks. He met Warren's eyes. "No
sir."</p>

<p>"Did you know they were flanking you in the rough country
beside the rocks?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then it was a trap?"</p>

<p>"I should like to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>Warren's voice killed Castleton's reply. "Was it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did Manuel Dura mention it might be a trap?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did."</p>

<p>Major Warren nodded at Mixler. "That will be all, Mr
Mixler."</p>

<p>George Mixler left the room at once, glad to be rid of that
scene. He turned to the sutler's store. He sat down at a table
and had the sutler bring over a bottle and glass, and poured
himself two swift drinks of whisky; and sat there staring at the
blunt ends of his fingers, loose and moody and defeated.</p>

<p>Back in the commanding officer's house Major Warren asked one
more question. "What impelled you to continue then, knowing you
were on dangerous ground?"</p>

<p>"I believed we could overtake Antone. It was my judgment the
risk was justified."</p>

<p>But he looked at a man who was no longer mild or jolly. When
Warren spoke it was with a soft-voiced detachment that made the
words so much the worse.</p>

<p>"There are times, Mr. Castleton, when it is necessary to risk
a command. Nor do I condemn an honest mistake. It takes a good
many years to season an officer in the field. Neither of these
conditions applies to you. You are an ambitious officer. In order
to further your own particular career you disregarded my explicit
warnings, the advice of your guide who knows Indians better than
you could ever hope to know them; and rode into a trap, wasting
two excellent soldiers. The kindest thing I can say to you, sir,
is that you were a fool. My hope is that you will profit by this
incident. If you do not there is no place in the army for
you."</p>

<p>Warren wheeled away, seized his hat from a chair and stamped
out of the house. Slowly turning, Castleton saw him cross the
parade and enter the shed where the dead troopers lay.</p>

<p>Castleton braced an arm against the doorsill, shoving the full
weight of his body into it. This was the kind of headless fury
that moved through him. He put his head down, stretching his lips
and pushing them together and stretching them again; then he
looked up and watched Ray Lankerwell pass by. Ray's eyes touched
him, guardedly indifferent, but Castleton, turned rash and
jealous and suspecting by all that had happened; thought he saw
contempt in the man's eyes. He stared at Lankerwell's back, on
the dangerous edge of calling Lankerwell back and making a
quarrel of it. What really checked that impulse was the scrape of
feet behind him. He turned to see Cowen come through the
kitchen.</p>

<p>He threw his question at Cowen as if he wanted to hit the man.
"Where's Miss Eleanor?"</p>

<p>Cowen showed him a wooden face, but Castleton thought he saw
something behind that impassiveness, something that was hard to
bear. "Lieutenant Benteen went to Tucson with a detail. She went
along, sir."</p>

<p>Castleton's voice stepped up a note. "When will they be
back?"</p>

<p>"Two days, sir," said Cowen, and gave the lieutenant a
straight black stare, falsely respectful, and retreated.</p>

<p>Castleton walked slowly around the room, at that moment
willing to give a year of his life for the privilege of stepping
across the barrier that separated him from Cowen so that he might
slam Cowen against the wall and beat that covert jeering out of
Cowen's eyes. He swung his fists back and forth as he walked, and
stopped and stared at the yellow flare of light on the San Pedro.
Tucson lay that way&mdash;and Eleanor, and Benteen. He smacked
the edge of the doorway with the flat of his hand and went down
the walk at a heavy tramping pace to his own single-roomed
dobe.</p>

<p>He poured a drink from the olla jar swinging on the rafter of
the ramada, at once beginning to sweat from the little moisture
taken in. This was the quality of afternoon heat. He sat on the
edge of the bed and rolled a cigarette and afterwards locked his
two fists together, staring at the floor. He thought of Antone
until Antone ceased to be an ordinary Indian in the hills, and
became, instead, everything that stood in his way. This was how
be thought of Antone, hating him increasingly. Then he remembered
Eleanor, and Benteen, and when he came to consider Benteen he
drew the cigarette slowly from his mouth and held it, forgetful,
between his fingers. His lips pushed together, never relaxing,
his big shoulders came forward and he sat in this profound dismal
study&mdash;a man with block cropped hair and a heavy, forward-
thrust chin and with eyes narrowed against the little devil-
points of light shining out of them.</p>

<p>In this country a dead man needed quick burying. In the last
sunlight a file of troopers carried Sweeney and O'Grady, blanket-
wrapped, out to the little cemetery: Castleton saw them pass his
door. For a moment he sat still, in no degree stirred, feeling no
pity toward the two men and no conscience in the matter. But in
the end he rose and went to the cemetery and stood in the burning
sunlight and listened to Warren's brief service. He looked at the
figures in the bottom of the grave. There was, for him, nothing
sacred about death and nothing to dread about it. He had no fear
of it, no feeling about it one way or other: Nor for that matter
did he place any particular value on life, another man's life or
his own, So he remained motionless and unstirred, and this was
the way Lily Marr, in the background, saw him. She was a clear-
sighted and realistic girl&mdash;appraising people by her own odd
standards; and in Castleton's long, solid face with its taciturn
impatience, she saw something on the very edge of brutality. She
looked away from him, at the graves.</p>

<p>At dusk Captain Harrison led twenty-five men out of Grant's
parade on a five-day scout, Ray Lankerwell and Manuel Dura
accompanying him. The straggling Indians from Nachee's peaceful
band started back to the camp on the San Pedro. Night fully fell,
the increasing moon laying its silver-frost glow across the
gravel and alkali earth. Lamps made a firefly pattern all around
the parade and the hour call ran from post to post. At tattoo
Castleton took the usual check roll call on the parade and
returned to his dobe. He lay on the bed, staring up to the black
ceiling; sleepless with all that was on his mind, his impatience
turning him more and more desperate.</p>

<p>At the fort this night other people had their thoughts and
were prompted to strange speech and odd acts. Lying in his single
cot, George Mixler listened to the steady mewling of the baby.
There wasn't any light in the room. The thick hot air pressed
against everything and the smell of baked earth was very strong.
Harriet's white nightgown made a blur on the other bed. He heard
her reach out and gently rock the crackerbox cradle.</p>

<p>He said: "Do you want me to pick sonny up and walk
around?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>There was a distance between them pretty hard to bear; as bad
as if one of them had died, and it made him remember how close
they had been in those few years of married life. He said:</p>

<p>"You remember the boat ride across from Old Point Comfort,
Harriet?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He pushed the single sheet entirely away from his stripped
body and scrubbed the heavy sweat around his chest. Sweat ran out
of his scalp. It soaked the pillow and made a wetness that was a
comfort against the greater heat. He said: "How soon can sonny
travel?"</p>

<p>"Maybe a week."</p>

<p>"I guess you had better go then," he said quietly; and put all
his hopes away.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hanna sat in the back of the bakery shop, pushing the
table's candle idly around its own drippings. Light turned his
leather face faintly red. Herb Levi, second line sergeant of K
troop was there, and Corporal Oldbuck, and Cowen. Cowen stood
attentively in the background. Hanna used the candle to mark the
fight.</p>

<p>"They was behind the rocks. We turned left&mdash;and then we
saw 'em up behind the humps. So we went at that bunch. O'Grady
died behind the third hump. Sweeney was hurt when his hawrrs fell
but it was an Injun that ran out from the rocks and stuck a knife
in his chest. After we brushed 'em from the humps we beat 'em
back when they came up from the rocks. They ran then, the
devils&mdash;shtraight for the hills. 'Twould have been nawt any
of us come back from that, had we followed. And still, I saw the
wish in Castleton's eye. For a minute I thought he meant to
follow; and in me mind I kissed the cross."</p>

<p>"A fool," said Levi.</p>

<p>"In a way he is," admitted Hanna. "I will never feel very sure
of me life as long as I follow behind him. 'Twas a hell of a
march on hawrrses and men, but to him we're nawthing to
consider."</p>

<p>Cowen said, with a sepulchral solemnity, "Was he afraid?"</p>

<p>"Afraid? By God, no. Had he been in the humor he would have
done up that hill after Antone alone. No, no fear. But no reason
ayther. And cold, my boy. Dead cold. Have a look at his face and
see if ye find a spark o' sympathy there. He is a fine hater, and
driven by the wish to be a great man. And he means to do it, if
he must kill himself or us." He looked solemnly around. "That is
no idle fancy. I do not like the thought of goin' on the next
scout detail with him. He will be mad to try his luck again."</p>

<p>"Another thing pushes the boy," said Levi. "That would be Mr.
Benteen."</p>

<p>"Ah," breathed Cowen, "you should have seen his face when he
found out Miss Eleanor had gone to Tucson with the
Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"A bad look," suggested Hanna.</p>

<p>"A killing look," said Cowen.</p>

<p>The three of them were old soldiers, with the loyalties of
long service ground into them. They remained silent after Cowen's
remark, thinking about it and gradually awakening to its meaning.
Hanna looked at the other two, a narrow surprise on his blackened
cheeks. "And so the man is a killer. It had nawt come to me that
way before. He has no pity I have ever seen. He has damned little
conscience in the way he handles his men, and the Lord put a
pride in him that will brook nawthin'. So he is, a killer."</p>

<p>"How is it Miss Eleanor does not see that?" puzzled Levi.</p>

<p>"Ah," grumbled Hanna. "Love. She only sees his strength, not
the damned deadly thing behind."</p>

<p>Cowen stiffened. "Hanna, keep your Irish tongue off that
girl."</p>

<p>Hanna stared at Cowen. "You fool," he murmured. "I taught her
to ride and I taught her to soldier since she was knee-high to a
waterin' trough. You should be tellin' me about Eleanor Warren.
It is God's pity she cannot see the better man. The Lieutenant
Benteen is an officer and a gentleman in the true way. Now it is
somethin' to see him ride and somethin' to hear him command.
Every man in this regiment knows it. A pity she does not."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Cowen, very shrewdly, "she sees it better than
we think."</p>

<p>"Whut's that mean?" asked Hanna, who loved his gossip.</p>

<p>But Cowen only looked wise and shook his head. "I bear no
tales from the commanding officer's house."</p>

<p>Levi drew a round circle on the table with his thumb, and
spoke. "One of these days Castleton will be bracin' Benteen. It
is in the cards&mdash;and not long in comin', I think. A man like
Castleton will stand for nothing in his road, and Benteen's in
it. It will be a hell of a thing when it comes. I am not sure
Benteen can lick him."</p>

<p>"Ah," growled Hanna and rose from his seat. The three of them
were darkly pondering it, displeased with what they saw. Hanna
shrugged his shoulders. "If they fight and the Major hear of it,
they'll be cashiered. So then it will be that dog Castleton who
pulls down a better man than he ever could be." It made him
angry; he showed it in his somber Irish eyes. But he said: "This
is improper talk, outside us three. Say nothing." Taps floated
across the parade.</p>

<p>There was an unfinished bottle on the table. Hanna drank his
share and passed it to Levi, who rubbed the neck clean and, slyly
winking at Hanna, offered it to Cowen. Cowen put both his hands
flat against the sides of his trousers. "No, of course not," he
said irritably. "You know damned well I don't."</p>

<p>Levi saluted him and tipped up the bottle. Cowen sighed, his
eyes watching Levi's Adam's apple slide up and down. Cowen's lips
puckered. Suddenly he wheeled around, and stamped from the
room.</p>

<p>"Temperance," said Hanna, "is a wonderful thing, Save me
another drop, Levi. It is a dry damned country."</p>

<p>As soon as the last note of taps had faded, Harry Jackson rose
from his cot and slipped out of the barrack. He reached the guard
line behind the quartermaster shed, waited until the sentry on
that post had walked to the far end of the beat, and quietly
crossed it. At the far margin of Aravaipa Creek he flattened on
his belly to take a quick survey of the desert. As before the
shining of Rose Smith's light, a mile away, was a lure that made
him forget the danger of the land, and so he rose and fell into a
quick trot. When he reached her door he paused, noting that the
inner board shutters had been drawn across the window. Faint
light seeped through the cracks and there was a murmur of talk
inside. Harry Jackson listened to it, distinguishing no words.
And at last knocked.</p>

<p>Jealousy and fear grew in him while he waited, but when she
opened the door and he saw the shape of her shoulders and the
shining of her hair against the light, this went away and left
him humble. He stepped inside, waiting for her to close the door.
Her face came around to him, carefully watching him. She didn't
smile.</p>

<p>He said: "I couldn't get away last night. On guard duty."</p>

<p>"Harry," she said, "I don't think you ought to run the desert
like this. Antone's Indians are around."</p>

<p>Her words, seeming to carry concern, made him feel good, "I'd
come," he said, "if I had to walk ten miles." There was smoke in
the room. He said: "Your uncle been here?"</p>

<p>Her answer came out rather slow and delayed. "Yes." But on her
face was a settled expression; it had a weariness. "Harry, you
going back east when your enlistment's up?"</p>

<p>He gave her a puzzled look; "Why?"</p>

<p>"You ought to."</p>

<p>He had his cold run of doubt. "Rose," he said, "this is a bad
place for you to be. You ought to have a better home. I never did
quite figure out why you got to stay with your uncle. You ought
to be in Tucson, or up in Prescott. There ain't anything here for
a woman like you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke in, "It is after taps. You better go back."</p>

<p>"When my hitch is up I'm goin' to Prescott and settle. Maybe
you'd like that."</p>

<p>"Me?" she asked and stared at him, her eyes obscure. "Why
me?'"</p>

<p>Harry Jackson's cheeks were red; his blue eyes were sharp and
excited. "We could be married."</p>

<p>"Me?" she murmured. "Me, Harry?"</p>

<p>He said: "Why, it won't be such a long wait, just a year. I've
got two hundred dollars, and I can get a job with a freighting
outfit any day."</p>

<p>She kept staring at him until he quit talking. The set of her
face was odd, her eyes were very round and her lips were pulled
together as if she were angry. He heard her murmur, "Thanks,
Harry," and then she went to the room's back door and opened it
and spoke to somebody in the darkness. She said, "Come in," her
tone sounding exhausted. Canreen came out of the night.</p>

<p>Canreen's big-lipped mouth spread apart. He was laughing from
the top of his lungs, quick and enormously amused. He said,
"Hello, kid. You're kind of late tonight; ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Canreen," said Rose Smith, "he wanted me to marry him."</p>

<p>Canreen quit grinning. His eyelids came together and he stood
there, puzzled, not understanding. "Huh?" he said.</p>

<p>Harry Jackson remained in the center of the room. He pulled up
his head and his long black hair came down the side of his face,
giving it a young, thin appearance. His lips were turned, as
though he tasted alum; a kind of cold sickness spread across his
features. The girl saw it and Canreen saw it. Canreen at last
caught on; his voice ceased to jeer at Jackson. It was a little
bit kind. "Kid," he said, "don't you see? Hell, go on back and
forget it."</p>

<p>Harry Jackson said nothing in that long, stretching silence.
Something went out of his eyes while he looked. The girl saw it
die. Then he stared at Canreen and even Canreen, not a quick man,
saw murder in the boy's eyes. This was all. Harry Jackson turned
out of the dobe, pulling the door behind him.</p>

<p>Canreen grumbled: "I'll be watchin' that kid. He'll try to run
a saber through me again." Rose Smith was crying, making no sound
about it; she watched the closed door and tears squeezed out of
her eyes and traveled along her cheeks. She dragged her lower lip
between her teeth.</p>

<p>"Rose," grumbled Canreen, "what the hell?" He reached out his
heavy hand and laid it on her shoulder. "Aw, what the hell?"</p>

<p>Young Harry Jackson walked across the desert and slipped by
the guard line. He let himself quietly into the barrack, pulled
off his boots and lay face up on his bunk, staring at the black
ceiling. He doubled his fists together and drew a long breath to
break up something lumpy and painful in his chest; but it stayed,
and he drew a deeper breath. Van Rhyn, whose bunk adjoined, spoke
through the black.</p>

<p>"You all right, son?"</p>

<p>Harry Jackson didn't answer and presently van Rhyn pushed his
feet from the bed and scratched a sulphur match, throwing the
light toward Harry Jackson. Harry Jackson batted the light out of
the older man's hands and turned on his side, breathing deeper
and deeper. He didn't know he was crying.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

<p class="first">AS soon as Eleanor returned from Tucson she
heard of Castleton's brush with the Indians. The story came first
from her father at the supper table and as usual he confined
himself to the strict facts. But she asked:</p>

<p>"Did Antone surprise him?"</p>

<p>Major Warren stroked his mustaches, thus covering the
expressive part of his face. She knew he did this deliberately.
His answer, as always, avoided direct judgment. "The boy had a
little hard luck, They were in rocks and he could not surround
them."</p>

<p>The true story would be among the enlisted men and Cowen, who
was an inveterate gossip, would know it. After her father, had
gone for his evening stroll, she turned to the kitchen. "Cowen,"
she said, "what happened?"</p>

<p>Even with his hands in the dish water, Cowen's massive dignity
clung to him. He contained important information and self-
consciously showed it. Nevertheless, it did not entirely come
out. "Mr. Castleton pursued the Injuns into the Pinals. This was
a hot trail and the lieutenant kept on it very strict. He reached
Antone in some rocks and made the charge, but was fired upon from
the left flank where some of Antone's warriors hid. He rushed 'em
and then was surrounded for a bit, but fought 'em away. Sweeney
lost his hawrrs and was hurt&mdash;and afterwards an Injun run
from the rocks and knifed him. The Lieutenant chased a savage
around one side of a little hump o' ground and O'Grady went the
other side of the hump. That's where O'Grady died. The Lieutenant
killed the Injun. Afterwards the bunch ran and t'was too rough a
country to safely follow."</p>

<p>"Was it a trap, Cowen?"</p>

<p>Cowen scratched his ear with a soapy thumb. "Now I did not
exactly hear that," he countered. "Though I did hear the
Lieutenant caught up with Antone very sudden."</p>

<p>"How did they look when they came back?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Cowen, "like lobsters boiled too long in the pot.
And wouldn't anybody after five days of that ridin'?"</p>

<p>"Five days, Cowen?"</p>

<p>"Very near. The Lieutenant had a hot trail and wanted to keep
on till he caught the red scoundrel."</p>

<p>She knew most of the story then. Phil had over-stayed his
orders two days in order to gamble on his luck, had been
surprised, and had lost two men. She stood in the doorway of the
dobe, deeply concerned. He was too ambitious and too proud not to
feel the sting of failure; and the judgment of the officers would
nag at his mind. They wouldn't say anything to him but their
manner toward him would reveal it. This was the brutally
effective way men had. Knowing Phil Castleton, she imagined his
humiliation and began to worry.</p>

<p>She looked around the dark quadrangle and didn't see him.
Disappointed and a little piqued by his absence, she went down to
see Harriet Mixler. Lily Marr sat in the bedroom, rocking the
crackerbox cradle. Harriet smiled out of a face drawn very thin.
Neither she nor the baby looked well:</p>

<p>"As soon as he can travel," said Harriet, "we're going up to
Fort Apache and get out of this heat. He won't live unless we do.
When fall comes I'm taking him East."</p>

<p>Eleanor, sympathetic and broadminded by nature, felt only
impatient, remembering George Mixler's wire-drawn features.
Still, she would not have let opinion escape had it not been for
her own confused state of mind.</p>

<p>"Harriet," she said, "what do you expect from marriage or from
army life? Every time George goes out on scout he takes his
chance of dying. Why should you cry about trouble; why should you
put all the blame on him, and make him so miserable he can't eat
or sleep? People should stand their miseries. You should stand
yours; When you married him you knew he'd be knocking around from
one frontier post to another most of his life and that he would
never have the freedom of a civilian, or the money; or any of the
conveniences. You thought the uniform made him a very gallant
figure, and so it does. But don't you know what the uniform
means? He made a bargain with the United States. You thought that
pretty nice when there was no trouble. Yet trouble is what all
his training is for. Now that it comes do you want him to crawl
out of it and run back to Virginia and drink mint juleps in the
moonlight? I'm disappointed in you."</p>

<p>Harriet flung back her answer. "He can do what he pleases. I
can't be an army woman. I'd grow old and wrinkled, and break my
heart at it."</p>

<p>"So you'll run away and break his," said Eleanor. "You wanted
him to quit the army. You threw the choice at him. Any woman who
tries to make a man choose between his wife or his career is a
fool. Maybe he'd throw up his career&mdash;and you'd have your
man; But what would you have? Nothing you'd want. You would have
destroyed everything in him that you liked&mdash;his self-respect
and his loyalty."</p>

<p>"No," said Harriet; "he's made his choice: He wouldn't leave
the army."</p>

<p>"I think," said Eleanor gently, "you ought to be proud of
that. But if you want a man you can wrap around your finger
you'll be a miserable wife."</p>

<p>"I'm going," repeated Harriet Mixler, in a stone-set
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Eleanor, "I think you will. But afterwards
this is what you'll remember. You'll remember George coming in
from a trail, hot and dusty and tired. You'll remember how
pleased be was to see you and how you sat around in the shadows,
glad to have him back. You'll remember how sweet those few days
were&mdash;the days between the times he had to go. You'll
remember him sitting on his horse at dress parade. I think you'll
remember the trumpet calls and the flag at retreat, and the
midnight suppers, and how good an orange tasted when you hadn't
had fresh fruit for a month, And you'll remember your
friends&mdash;the closest friends you'll ever have in the world;
When you get away from it everything will come back clearer than
you imagine and you'll always regret leaving."</p>

<p>She had said all this quite swiftly. It came springing out of
her heart, and then when she had finished, she was surprised bow
deeply she felt, and was quite still&mdash;knowing that Harriet
had refused to listen. Harriet lay with her eyes turned to the
ceiling, the baby had begun to cry again; and Lily Marr's dark
eyes watched her&mdash;watched Eleanor&mdash;with a driving
interest. Eleanor reached over, touched Harriet's shoulder, and
left the room.</p>

<p>She stood in the doorway, watching the shape of the sentry
drift by, hearing the murmur of the troopers in the barrack
across the way, catching the keen hot smell of dust damped down
by the passing sprinkling cart. An orange-silver moonlight
vaguely diluted the darkness and the mountains directly east or
the post lay high and solidly black&mdash;with the feeling of
danger and mystery and ancient wildness in them.</p>

<p>It was odd to stand here and have her thoughts drift beyond
control, She had been thinking of Phil Castleton, wondering about
him; the next moment all these vivid impressions of the night
lifted her spirit to an eager pitch and then in the sway of this
strange restlessness, she remembered Tucson and Benteen and her
feelings were quick and pleased and on the shadowy edge of
wistfulness. She could not explain that mixture of sensation in
her body though she honestly tried to clear it up; there was, she
realized immediately, danger in the mood, danger in the memory,
and it was with a distinct relief that she saw Castleton cross
from post headquarters.</p>

<p>She took his arm, happy to have him near. They strolled along
the north side of the triangle without a word. Near the post
bakery a beam of light crossed the walk and she noticed the
rather hard angle of his face. But he felt her glance; it drew
his smiling attention. Beyond the beam of light he stopped and
drew her in for a kiss. For her this was the deepest pleasure of
the evening. Even the forgetfully severe pressure of his arms
brought her nearer to him.</p>

<p>She said: "It's been a long time, Phil."</p>

<p>"I always miss you. Five days, or three years. One's just as
bad as the other."</p>

<p>"That's nice to know."</p>

<p>"See anything new in Tucson?"</p>

<p>"We went to a Mexican play and ate enchiladas and hot
chocolate. And&mdash;" She had meant to add that they had sat on
the steps of the church in the moonlight. But she turned aside
from it; saying, "It was really a pleasant diversion," A distant
uneasiness stirred in her at her own evasion. She didn't like it,
she didn't approve&mdash;and wondered why she had so definitely
drawn away from mentioning the rest of the episode.</p>

<p>He said, "We?"</p>

<p>"Tom and I." She at once heard the change in his voice, its
cooling and its brief jumpiness. So she asked, quietly amused,
"Jealous?" and knew before he answered that he was.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said. Nothing more, but that was enough. Some
parts of that night, she thought distantly, she couldn't tell
him.</p>

<p>"Did you have a pretty hard scout?"</p>

<p>"You've heard the details, I imagine."</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm sorry, Phil. Better luck next time."</p>

<p>They were at the men's side of the quadrangle and as before he
pulled her away from the walk so that the voices inside would not
register. "What are you sorry for?" he asked.</p>

<p>His tone made her wonder. She knew the depth of his pride and
she had expected to hear some echo of his defeat, some
unconscious admission of humiliation. She didn't hear it. His
voice was cool and quick and quite self-confident. Whatever his
thoughts were, he kept them carefully hidden&mdash;and this
reserve troubled her, as though it were a lack of faith on his
part in her. The moment's closeness was broken. She changed the
things she had intended to say, which was about the trap he had
fallen into. In his present attitude she knew it wouldn't
help.</p>

<p>"You wanted to catch Antone, didn't you? I'm sorry you
didn't."</p>

<p>"I have learned," he said, "that Antone is clever, A good
sagebrush general. He picks his spots always in reference to a
safe retreat. This time he faded into a rocky country we could
not follow, But I do not have much respect for his striking
power. Both Manuel Dura and Al Hazel put too much stress on his
danger. I went through a canyon at dusk. Dura and Mixler were
both uneasy about it. Nothing happened. We came up against the
rocks, with Dura full of old-maid symptoms. We lost two men and
accounted for ten or twelve Indians. I regret the loss of the
men, but we paid off for it."</p>

<p>He mentioned this with a cool indifference that both puzzled
and displeased her. Somehow his words were not right; they were
screens against his real feelings. She found herself saying:</p>

<p>"It was O'Grady's third enlistment. Sweeney was very fond of
me. They were good men."</p>

<p>"I took my chances, too, Eleanor," he said in the same touch-
and-go voice.</p>

<p>"Phil," she said, a little sharp with him, "I am expressing
regret. I'm not arguing."</p>

<p>He said: "You will be the only one not expressing disapproval.
The post seems to think I'm a poor officer. Yet I would do it
again." Then she heard some of the hidden anger get loose. "And I
will do it again, given the opportunity. I have no use at all for
the damned penny-ante tactics of this campaign. If I were Antone,
watching a file of troopers chase him up one canyon and retreat
down another, I'd have nothing but contempt for the American
uniform. Next time I see the color of his skin I shall follow, on
horse or on foot, or on my belly, as long as I have one man left
to draw a full breath. Then we shall see."</p>

<p>"Phil," she said, "don't carry a chip on your shoulder."</p>

<p>He stopped. They were on the thick shadows by the post
headquarters and all she saw was the line of his jaw. "Eleanor,
are you making the common disapproval of me unanimous?"</p>

<p>She had her own temper. "Hold on young man," she said
immediately. "If it is a fight you wish to pick, just tell me. I
love to push pins into rash young officers who grow too
proud."</p>

<p>"So," he said, again cool.</p>

<p>"So," she mimicked, stung by this irritating aloofness. "If I
am to be your wife, Phil, you must not use that 'Run along little
girl' tone at all. I was straddling army wagon tongues while you
were still playing marbles. I know something about this army,
mister. You seem to think nobody at the post likes you. If that
were really true Phil, it could only mean that you were wrong. I
don't think it is true. But one thing you must do, if you really
want to get along. You must go halfway to other people."</p>

<p>He used that dry distant tone again, saying, "Tell me the rest
of my faults," and at once she knew she had to break through this
man's barrier. She said, shockingly distinct:</p>

<p>"One of us is a fool, Phil. Either you for using that tone, or
I for standing it."</p>

<p>"Eleanor," he flashed out, on the very edge of arrogance.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked.</p>

<p>He took her arms, almost shaking her. But he came all the way
down from his high, biting anger; and the sound of his words
then, humble and afraid, made her remember that she loved him.
"Eleanor," he groaned, "never speak like that. This is a hell of
a lonely life and if you leave me, how in God's name&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said, "Hush," gently and sweetly. "I know. You can't help
it. It drives you so hard. I can understand. But others
don't&mdash;because you never let them see. We'll be together a
lot of years, Phil. If I am good for anything, I'm good for you.
And I'll help. I know how. Only, you've got to do a hard thing in
the next few weeks. You've got to make your peace with the men in
the post."</p>

<p>"How?" he said.</p>

<p>"That," she said, with more insight than she realized, "I
can't tell you. You're a man&mdash;you must do it the way men
do."</p>

<p>A long windy breath rushed out of him, telling her how
desperate and balked and stormy his feelings were. Then he
murmured: "Eleanor, I wish we could be married shortly. Would a
month be too soon for you?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "A month from now, if you want it."</p>

<p>"Fine," he said, "fine," and kissed her again, and wheeled
through the night. She didn't realize until now that she stood in
front of her own doorway. This wrapped up had she been. Watching
his high shape merge with the blackness of the parade, she had
her moment of wonder. She understood him&mdash;and yet did not.
He had so many contradictory sides, rising from the tremendous up
and down swing of his personality, that at times she could not
follow, and grew a little weary from trying. She hated his
moments of sarcastic indifference&mdash;for these were the times
when be went entirely away from her and forgot her and
underestimated her; but he had that hard burning fire she could
not help loving. And so she pondered.</p>

<p>Her father spoke from the house: "Daughter, wish you'd come
pull off my boots."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and didn't move. Somehow and sometime she
knew she'd have to tell Phil about the rest of her evening with
Tom Benteen, so that it would not be a secret standing between
them. She hated deceit. But deeper than this was a faint fear of
the memory of Benteen's kiss. The recurring thought of it could
be a dangerous thing. She thought of it now and had no illusions
about her own feelings. She had wanted the kiss, and had not
regretted it, and this was the danger, this warmth that came back
to her as she recalled how he held her in the swirling blackness
of Fort Lowell.</p>

<p>"Dammit," complained Major Warren, "I can't go to bed with
these things on, Eleanor."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and listened to the trumpet pouring the
strong golden notes of tattoo across the parade.</p>

<p>Beyond tattoo Lily Marr stepped from the Mixler dobe and stood
a moment to watch the far away glitter of the stars. Dust incense
clung to the air, and heat rolled flat and cloying along the
parade, and the few stray sounds of the post sank without echo
into the overwhelming silence of the desert. Castleton and
Eleanor went past, not noticing her. The sentry paced his post,
back and forth. Tom Benteen appeared a moment in his lighted
doorway, his high body indolently slouched. Lily Marr's eyes
clung to him as long as he remained there. She lifted her arms
and locked them across her chest, and after he threw his cigar
into the dust, its lighted tip showering sudden sparks when it
struck, and turned back into his quarters, Lily Marr slowly
followed the walk around the quadrangle, her head bent down.</p>

<p>She had reached the corner near the bakery when a shadow moved
away from the wall and a hand touched her arm. Jack Bean's voice
said:</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Lily."</p>

<p>She was a strong-nerved girl. She turned without surprise or
shock, pulled against the bakery wall by Bean's hand.</p>

<p>She let his hand stay only a moment, afterwards pulling away
with a strong resistance. Jack Bean began to speak, but stopped
and turned into a taut shadow against the wall while the sentry
paced by. He waited until the sentry was out of earshot; his
voice was quick and soft and amused.</p>

<p>"Hell, I came through the guard line, right at the feet of one
of those soldiers. If I was an Apache I'd have you out of here on
a pony now."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>He said: "When I set out to do something, Lily, nothing can
stop me. I told you I'd come back, didn't I? I'm going to kill
that captain some day. I take nothing from any man, not me. And
I'll do what I please, long as I live." He quit talking, waiting
for her answer. She remained passive and unresponsive, until he
had to speak again in a more aggressive voice: "Whut were you a-
goin' up to Summerton's ranch for?"</p>

<p>"To cook."</p>

<p>"I put a stop to that, didn't I? You never got there. Nor you
never will. If you get up there, Lily, I'll burn the damn place
down. You ain't goin' to be under any roof with another man.
Maybe you don't want me&mdash;but if you don't it won't be
anybody else, either. I'm tellin' you, Lily."</p>

<p>"Go on back to Tucson."</p>

<p>"Which is where you ought to be," he answered. "I can't be
ridin' up this way all the time."</p>

<p>"Then don't come," she said. Both of them were silent again,
waiting for the sentry to go by. Presently Jack Bean tried a
different voice.</p>

<p>"Whut's a man got to do, Lily?"</p>

<p>"Do what you please. Why ask me?"</p>

<p>He said, sharp and suspecting, "There any men up here you're
a-lookin' at?"</p>

<p>"What if I am?"</p>

<p>The indifference of her talk set him in a rage. "By God," he
breathed, "I'll find 'em and I'll kill 'em. That captain?"</p>

<p>She said slowly, "No, not him. Though he could whip you any
time. You don't like that, do you, Jack? You don't like anything
above you. But there's lots of things bigger and lots of men
better."</p>

<p>He said: "If you was a man I'd know what to do. It is plumb
hard not to bat that damn pride out of your head. I set my mind
on what I want, Lily, and I get it. I always have and I guess I
always will. I'm goin' to trail you around Arizona. Every time
you see a man you like I'm goin' to kill him. You'll change your
mind. Or you'll be an old maid. Maybe you think I'm goin' to have
the Territory laugh at Jack Bean for losin' his girl. No. I
ain't. Because I'm goin' to make it too risky for another man to
look at you."</p>

<p>She waited out his talk, clearly knowing how bitterly this
wild, arrogant outlaw hated such unresisting indifference. It was
the one thing he could not understand and could not fight. He
said, more quietly:</p>

<p>"Lily, whut you want? I'll get it. Whut you want a man to
do?"</p>

<p>Suddenly she moved against him and put her arms around his
waist, locking her big strong fingers together. She called out,
"Guard&mdash;guard!"</p>

<p>Jack Bean heaved backward, trying to reach her locked fingers
and break her grip. He was cursing, he kept sliding along the
wall, the challenge of the on-running guard coming to him. He
couldn't catch her fingers and then, with other men rushing at
the bakery, he put his forearm against her throat and shoved
until she strangled for breath, still hanging to him. She knew he
had the power to break her spine if she didn't let go. But he
didn't use his strength, he didn't try; and then she understood
more about him. The guard raced in and jammed the muzzle of his
carbine into Jack Bean's flank. Stepping back, Lily was at once
surrounded by soldiers. The sergeant of the guard swung a lantern
forward and Castleton was here&mdash;and Benteen.</p>

<p>It was Benteen who lifted Bean's gun from the holster. He held
it in his hand, watching the outlaw and watching Lily Marr who
stood so composed through all this. Jack Bean's face was white
and wild and the light of his eyes burned bitterly against Lily
Marr who returned that glance with an iron calm that Benteen
never forgot.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," she said, "this is the man who held up the
Summerton wagons."</p>

<p>Benteen studied her. He said, "You've changed your mind,
Lily?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Jack Bean's hat had fallen. Light made a strong shining on his
yellow head, on the straining rage that marbled his half-
handsome, reckless face. "Captain," he ground out, "I walked
through your damned guard line like it wasn't there. I will walk
out of your jail the same way. The army ain't big enough to hold
me, and no man's big enough. Captain&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped his talk and his jealous eyes weighed Lily Marr and
Benteen with a shrewd suspicion. Suddenly he laughed, quick and
flat and dangerous. "I guess I got to take care of you, Captain.
God knows I will."</p>

<p>"Put him in the guardhouse," said Benteen, and watched a pair
of troopers catch Bean by the arms and swing him across the
parade. Lily Marr remained and Castleton remained. Castleton
stared at the girl, no trust on his face.</p>

<p>"Rather odd, Miss Marr. You should have done this last time. I
don't understand."</p>

<p>"Never mind," interrupted Benteen.</p>

<p>Castleton jerked his head around, affronted by that blunt
tone. His jaw made a stubborn cut against the night, black and
bold. Benteen ignored him. Benteen kept studying Lily Marr, more
and more moved by the serene calm she showed him. There were
thoughts in her head that never got out and memories that
darkened her eyes. There was a mystery about her she refused to
explain; and yet out of her stillness glowed a character very
real, very strong. This was what made Benteen soft with his
talk.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Lily?"</p>

<p>"Leave him there," she said. "I will do what has to be done."
She walked back toward the commanding officer's quarters.</p>

<p>Benteen turned and paced around the corner of the barrack and
into the stable. Castleton's steady steps echoed behind him. A
lantern swung down from a rafter, throwing a ghostly glow on
Benteen. When he wheeled he found Castleton before him and he
knew trouble was on the wing.</p>

<p>Castleton said: "When I am under your command, in the field,
Mr. Benteen, I will accept your orders. When I am in this post,
not on duty, I will not have you giving me orders of any kind. I
resent the remark you made in front of the Marr woman."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Benteen, "it was unfavorable. I withdraw
it."</p>

<p>"The meaning remains," retorted Castleton, "and your attitude
remains. You have always indicated your dislike of me. A blind
man could see it. The people in this post are not blind."</p>

<p>"I think," said Benteen, holding his talk to an even drawl,
"you are looking for something that doesn't exist."</p>

<p>Castleton flung up his head and half shouted his challenge.
"Don't beat around the bush!"</p>

<p>Light glinted across Benteen's sandy red hair, it painted flat
shadows over his eyes. His lids dropped, half closing. The wind
in his chest gently stirred the front of his gray shirt. His arms
hung straight, heavy-knuckled and idle. "I guess," he said, "this
is a good time to say what you want to say. Maybe it should have
come out long ago. Go ahead."</p>

<p>"Fine," breathed Castleton, sarcasm in each rapid word. "Very
fine, very magnanimous. I compliment you on your manners. They
are most effective on rank and file. The Major admires your
judgment and your discretion&mdash;or is it discretion, Mr.
Benteen? The commissioned staff is charmed by the quality of your
poker. The enlisted men applaud and imitate your soldierly
virtues, which are most naturally unstudied&mdash;or are they
unstudied; Mr. Benteen?"</p>

<p>"Go on," murmured Benteen. The shadowing in the wells of his
eyes grew blacker. He raised one hand and softly rubbed his belt
buckle.</p>

<p>Castleton's heavy shoulders rose at the corners. He was solid,
he was twenty pounds heavier than Benteen. Light laid its oily
shine on his long and flushed face. His feet stirred restlessly
on the hard-packed floor of the stable; his words rushed on
rising unreasonably and unforgivably to the break.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm not plain enough, Mr. Benteen. So I will be
plainer. I do not see the gallantry in you that others appear to
see. I do not like political lieutenants who curry the favor of
their men by slack discipline. I do not believe your customary
silence indicates profound wisdom, as Warren seems to think. Is
that plain, Mr. Benteen? I think your caution in avoiding a fight
with Antone is something else than caution. I think your transfer
to this regiment is a mystery still in need of explaining,
and&mdash;" He paused for a huge sweep of breath, measuring
Benteen as if for attack, "I think you had better keep your
damned leisure hours away from Eleanor."</p>

<p>"Through now?" said Benteen.</p>

<p>"Maybe," cried Castleton, "you still don't understand! This
army is too small for both of us! Perhaps you want to do
something about that!"</p>

<p>Benteen's lips rolled together and the silence ran on, hot and
thick and bad. He dropped his arm from his belt. "Phil," he said,
"you're an ass, full of conceit. I think I am going to beat hell
out of you. I have wanted to do it for a mighty long while."</p>

<p>"Fine!" breathed Castleton, stepping back. "Fine. I propose to
destroy your reputation as a fighter before we leave this
stable."</p>

<p>This was the moment Sergeant Hanna intervened. Watching
Castleton follow Benteen to the stable he had immediately
followed as far as the corner of the barrack wall, there hearing
the quarrel. Now he walked into the stable with a certain bland
deference. He said: "Beg pardon, but I forgot to trim the wick on
this lantern. 'Twill smoke up the place."</p>

<p>Benteen stood directly under the lantern, blocking Hanna's
further progress; and so Hanna remained by the door, solemnly
waiting. Castleton flung him a black, intolerant glance, and then
looked around to Benteen who made no move. Castleton said, "I
shall see you later, Lieutenant Benteen," and wheeled from the
stable.</p>

<p>Benteen considered the face of this inscrutable, taciturn
Hanna, understanding him completely. He said: "Hanna, was there
any talk around here tonight? I thought you might have heard
some."</p>

<p>"No, sor," drawled Hanna, "I niver heard a worrd,"</p>

<p>Benteen nodded and walked out of the stable.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

<p class="first">CAPTAIN HARRISON brought his detail back from
the hills, reporting no luck. The wear and tear of five days'
scouting showed on him, on Lankerwell, and on the men. "It is,"
said Harrison, gratefully smacking his lemon-and-sugar flavored
whisky, "a killing climate for a soldier dressed in wool clothes
and carrying thirty pounds of equipment. Meanwhile Antone,
stripped to moccasins and breechclout and a tailless shirt,
travels like a shadow. We cut his trail, two or three days old.
We never got any closer. Dura says he's shifted north."</p>

<p>Suddenly this blasting hot summer month the Apaches were alive
in the Territory. The Chiricahuas came out of the Dragoons to
disrupt the mail stage line. A prospector, with an arrow in his
back, ran thirty miles through the Rincons escaping only to die.
All down the Santa Rita valley men were forted up in their small
ranches. Half a dozen warriors crawled to the very margin of
Tucson, killed a Mexican water carrier and raced back into the
Catalinas. One afternoon, on the Santa Rita, a sheepherder lay in
the partial shade of a paloverde, listening to the tinkle of the
bellwether thinking there could be no Apaches disturbing the
flock as long as the bell continued to sound. He fell asleep, and
woke, still hearing the jingle; but turning over he saw an Apache
crouched ten feet away from him, holding the bell in his hand,
ringing it and grinning. The Mexican screamed and sprang up,
racing for the distant ranch house. The men in the ranch house
saw the Apache's lance pin the herder to earth.</p>

<p>Travel from Tucson to Prescott was cut off, no man caring to
risk it except under heavy escort. Pete Kitchen's ranch was
raided and his hogs filled with arrows, but Pete Kitchen held on.
High on the Mogollon plateau the Tontos were active closing the
courier service between Camp Apache and Fort Whipple. There was a
flurry at Date Creek, on the road to Ehrenburg. A stagecoach and
six passengers, venturing out of Prescott, never reached
McDowell. A trapper and his Indian wife were massacred in the
White Tank Mountains.</p>

<p>The mines closed; everybody withdrew from desert and hills,
crowding the settlements. Down in the Huacoucas, near the border,
a Mexican rancher's boy was carried into captivity.</p>

<p>Every garrison in the Territory was active. Detachments
scouted out of Lowell, north toward Camp Grant. Troops moved into
Fort Bowie to guard the eastern gateway of the Territory.
Detachments from Camp Apache, high in the hills, scouted
southward toward Grant; Camp Verde and McDowell, out on the Salt,
were little islands in a barren land.</p>

<p>As soon as Harrison came in, Major Warren put Benteen back in
the field. Benteen found a fresh trail beyond the Gila and
followed it until his rations gave out and his horses would stand
no more; but he returned to Grant with definite knowledge Antone
had shifted into the Sierra Anchas. Warren gave the next detail
to George Mixler, who surprised an isolated rancheria and brought
back a squaw and an elderly brave who said he would not have been
caught if he were not tired of fighting. Howell Ford took the
next detail; and after that, Harrison went out again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Major Warren had relieved Ray Lankerwell as post
adjutant to put him in the field, and named Phil Castleton
adjutant. It was, Eleanor knew, her father's way of keeping
Castleton in the post. He did not mean to trust Phil with another
detail. She was too smart a girl to interfere with army routine
and so kept her own counsel as the days wore on. Yet, walking
around the quadrangle with Phil, in the hot night shadows, she
felt bitterness grow greater in him. He had a manner of
concealing it, which was to smile more and to speak with a
lightness close to insolence. But it was no concealment. By day
he walked the post, stiff-shouldered and exact in his duties,
keeping to the post headquarters office more than
usual&mdash;even in the broiling midafternoon's heat. Once,
passing by headquarters doorway she saw him seated by the desk.
He had it book before him and appeared to be reading it, bent
over with his hands supporting his head. She paused, expecting to
draw his attention; and then she saw the sightless way he stared
at the page and the nerve-drawn expression on his lips and the
complete tightness of his shoulders. He wasn't reading; he sat
there on the edge of some kind of a break. That afternoon she
broke her long rule and spoke to her father.</p>

<p>"When will Phil's turn come again, Dad?"</p>

<p>"Ray Lankerwell served three months. I expect Phil will serve
that long."</p>

<p>"Still, you sent Ray out even while he was post adjutant."</p>

<p>"Too much paperwork right now to let Phil go."</p>

<p>She said: "Of course that isn't the real reason."</p>

<p>Warren sat in the easiest chair to be had, loosely and
uncomfortably. Heat turned his cheeks dye-red. He scowled through
the haze of his cigar's smoke. "Daughter, don't be meddlesome. I
raised you better."</p>

<p>She said, "I can't help it, Dad. You'll break him&mdash;you
are setting him down in front of the camp."</p>

<p>Warren carefully judged her expression and found it hard to
answer. He stirred around the chair. "One time," he murmured,
"when I was a young fellow in the dragoons, I committed a very
serious breach of discipline. I'm a fat man now, but at that time
I was as high spirited as young Phil. I could have been cashiered
for it. The colonel took my sword away from me and confined me to
quarters for an entire summer. I used to watch the troops go out.
I'd stand on the porch when they passed&mdash;and I knew what
every man in that command thought of me. They thought I was a
young fool. I got so I hated to cross the parade, or look another
man in the face. Sometimes I wanted to hide, but I made myself
stand in sight when those details left. Many's the time I thought
of resigning, only I couldn't run that way. You don't know what
kind of a hell that is, daughter. When I got my sword back and
rejoined my troop I wasn't the same young man any more. I lost
something. But it made a soldier out of me. It will do the same
thing to Phil. Or he'll resign."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "he won't resign. That would be a terrible
answer."</p>

<p>"Then let him eat part of his pride away," grumbled Warren.
"He has too much of it. I'm sorry for any living thing that's got
to destroy part of itself to survive. I'm sorry for any man who
has to throw half his ambitions out the window. Maybe in civil
life he could try to be Caesar. There is no place for a Caesar in
the army." He put his cigar away and rose, not liking his
thoughts. He paused before his daughter, older at this moment
than she had noticed before&mdash;older and a little sadder. "I
have stood by and watched poor officers rise above me and I have
seen great officers march out their lives in one rank when they
should have worn stars. I have seen bribery and favoritism and
cheating. I have saluted men I knew to be scoundrels, I have seen
officers rot away in some little sagebrush post while others wore
gold braid in Washington, D. C., without reason. It is unfair, it
is hard, it is brutal&mdash;but you've got to learn it, and do
your duty as you see it and make that your one consolation. I
can't talk to Castleton, and you can't. He's got to sit there and
go through every damned bit of it alone. He'll be a great man if
he does. He won't be anything you'd want if he doesn't. I don't
know whether God hates a political general or a grandstand
swashbuckler, but I do. And I cannot take the chance of sending
him out with twenty men he'll lead to slaughter for the sake of
ambition."</p>

<p>She said: "You don't like him, do you?"</p>

<p>He stopped in the doorway, carefully thinking of that. "Let's
wait and see. In thirty days I shall either love him for being a
man, or I shall hate him like hell for being a weak fool."</p>

<p>"In either event," she said, quite slowly, "he will be your
son-in-law."</p>

<p>"You have always been a loyal girl, Eleanor. You are like your
mother&mdash;you don't change."</p>

<p>After he had gone, Eleanor stood in the doorway, watching the
doorway of post headquarters for sight of Castleton. Benteen came
from officers' mess and strolled down the shade of the barrack's
ramada. Eleanor watched his loose walk; she watched the way his
sandy red hair tipped, she watched the way his long arms swung.
He was very tall and, like most cavalry officers, slim at the
hips. He wasn't a good-looking man, he wasn't spectacular, he had
little of that terrific drive of energy possessed by Phil
Castleton. And yet&mdash;these things kept going through her mind
oddly&mdash;he was a figure that she watched with an interest
that never flagged. His presence had a way of reassuring her, of
binding her to him; he had, behind his silence and his easy-going
patience, something that always lifted her heart. At the corral
near the bakery shop he swung up and sat a moment while troopers
led in a fidgeting horse; afterwards he slid inside the corral,
waited for the troopers to snub the horse to a post, and then
stepped into the saddle. Eleanor moved around in the doorway,
watching the sudden furious boil of dust when the horse was
released. She held her breath, she pressed her fingers against
the dobe wall. When the horse quit bucking, she realized how
still and intent she was, and turned back into the house. Cowen
was in the kitchen. She said: "We're going to make up some apple
pies for a party tonight, Cowen."</p>

<p>Lily Marr crossed the parade to the guardhouse and stood by
the iron-grated door, coolly watching Jack Bean's face. He came
forward and placed his hands around the bars. His long mouth cut
a quick grin across his cheeks and then he laughed in a way that
turned her eyes dark.</p>

<p>"Lily," he said, "I could have killed you last night. But now
I got it figured out. You were sore last night. When a woman's
sore she's got to love a man. That's why you had me put in
here."</p>

<p>She said: "The United States marshal will be here next week.
You're going to hang, Jack."</p>

<p>But his grin grew wider; he was sure of himself, he was
pleased with her anger and he had no fear. "Lily, this place
won't hold me long. When I get out I'll be around Tucson. I'll
wait for you there."</p>

<p>"The guard stands in front of this door all night with orders
to shoot. You're going to hang, Jack."</p>

<p>He said: "How long you figure to stay sore? What do you want
from a man? You had your way&mdash;I reckon that ought to be
enough. If it's money&mdash;" He lowered his voice. "Listen," he
said, "have that captain take you back to Tucson today. The money
from that wagon is in a coffeepot, on the kitchen shelf, in the
old Aguirre house where I always stay. You find Bill Hanley and
tell him when the marshal figures to take me back to Tucson. Bill
knows what to do. He'll wait in the Catalinas, by the trail."</p>

<p>Benteen, at this moment, was returning from the corral.</p>

<p>Lily Marr beckoned to him and waited until he came up. She
watched the grin fade from Jack Bean's face; dark and unstirred
she watched doubt creep into his eyes, she watched the freshening
shine of anger. She said, to Benteen: "He told me where the money
is. It is in a coffeepot in the kitchen of the Aguirre house in
Tucson. Everybody knows that house. The money belongs to the
Summerton ranch. Tell them where it is."</p>

<p>Jack Bean's hands struggled against the iron bars. "Lily," he
ground out, "you go too far with a man! I'll find out who gets
that money! I'll kill Summerton if he touches it! I'll knock this
damn dobe down! Captain, you keep your mouth shut if you expect
to live. Damn a jealous woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>The guard came up with a tin plate of food and a tin cup of
coffee. Lily's eyes followed his hand as it reached up to the
high, outside corner of the low roof and pulled down the jail
key. He unlocked the door. Lily reached out and took the cup and
the plate. With all these men watching her, she poured the coffee
over the food. "Open the door," she said and when the guard
obeyed her she stooped and slid the plate across the floor. The
door slammed shut and was locked. Benteen's glance clung to Lily
Marr's impassive face; he was trying to read the things in her
eyes, on her lips. She stared at Jack Bean, cruelly
unforgiving.</p>

<p>"Dogs eat off the floor, Jack. There's your meal."</p>

<p>She turned away, crossing back to the Mixler quarters.</p>

<p>Mixler and Shiraz came out, with Shiraz saying some soft thing
she didn't hear; and then the two men passed her, going toward
the headquarters building. Swinging around, she saw them stop
before Major Warren who had come to the door. She heard Mixler
speak in a fatigued voice:</p>

<p>"Doctor Shiraz says it will be necessary for Harriet and sonny
to get out of this heat. I should like your permission. She wants
to go to Apache in the morning."</p>

<p>"Take an escort of six men, Mr. Mixler,"</p>

<p>George Mixler lowered his head. He was silent a moment, both
these other officers waiting. Then he said: "I believe she would
prefer another officer, sir."</p>

<p>Warren spoke briefly: "Then Mr. Ford will accompany her. Does
she wish to take all her luggage?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said Mixler dully. "She is not returning to
Grant."</p>

<p>From her position under the ramada of the Mixler quarters,
Lily Marr watched this passing scene, her eyes seeing so much
that others would not see. She had this frontier vigilance. The
baby was crying loud enough to turn George Mixler in his tracks.
He stared at the dobe, caught by indecision, but finally went on
with Shiraz toward the sutler's store. Major Warren traveled past
her, breathing deeply. Benteen came from the corral and now her
glance livened and followed him as he went down the barrack line.
Nachee crouched in the shade, and here Benteen stopped, also
crouching; Al Hazel came up, the three of them holding a
tricornered parley, Nachee drawing patterns in the dust. The baby
kept on crying, with Harriet Mixler's voice, low and exhausted
and desperate, trying to soothe it, but for a moment longer Lily
Marr watched Benteen. Her lips sweetened and stirred and a
prettiness came to her dark face. At last she turned into the
Mixler dobe, lifted the baby from its wet bed and cradled it in
her arms. She walked the room, softly murmuring;
"So&mdash;so&mdash;so." Harriet Mixler lay on the bed with her
face turned to the ceiling; it was set and gray. She said: "You'd
make a better mother than me, Lily."</p>

<p>Lily Marr said, gently: "What else is a woman for?"</p>

<p><br> <br> After retreat and guard mount, the officers of the
post, save for Ray Lankerwell who was on scout, sat down to
Eleanor Warren's supper. The oysters were out of a can long saved
for a particular occasion, the fresh corn straight from Tucson
and still on the cob, the coffee strong in the way all soldiers
like it&mdash;and the pie a last little touch of drama.</p>

<p>Captain Harrison, an honest epicure, considered this pie in
some surprise, took his first taste and slapped his hand on the
table: "Where in God's name did you get the apples, Eleanor?"</p>

<p>"That was my mother's recipe when supplies got down to
nothing. Apple pie without apples. You make a crust. You soak
soda crackers until they are soft, season them with cinnamon and
lemon extract&mdash;and there is your filler. If you're really
hungry it does taste like apples."</p>

<p>"Ah," applauded the captain, "you're a fine cook. A woman
makes an awful difference to a man. It took me a long time to
find that out&mdash;and now it is too late. You are very lucky,
Phil."</p>

<p>Eleanor said: "Lucky to have the woman or to have the
cook?"</p>

<p>Phil surprised her. He lifted his wine glass and he was
smiling. "For the woman," he said. Coming from him it was so
unexpectedly gallant that she blushed. Her father gave Castleton
a quick look, Benteen's chin lifted as though his drifting
interest had been arrested; and for a moment there was a silence.
She had her moment of genuine fear then that the silence would
change Phil back to what he had been, that he could not carry it
off before those weighing eyes. For she knew what was in the
minds of these men. Their opinions regarding Phil had already
been formed and were not easily changed; this was what he faced.
But he kept smiling as he looked around at them. He met their
eyes and his voice was quite easy:</p>

<p>"For the woman, for Eleanor."</p>

<p>Harrison kicked back his chair at once and they all rose,
bowed to her and drank. She was not an outwardly emotional girl
and yet the rush of feeling in her, so strong and so grateful,
made her drop her head; she was that near to crying. "You are
all," she murmured, "very proper gentlemen."</p>

<p>They were still standing. Tom Benteen looked down at Lily
Marr. He smiled at her, a deep-lying interest in the smile. "To
Lily, as well." So they drank again and waited&mdash;and it was
George Mixler who added, so quietly, "To my wife." Thus they
finished and moved back from the table and lighted their cigars.
All of them kept to their chairs except Benteen who moved around
the room, touched by restlessness. The old, slanting expression
was on his face again&mdash;a faintly ironic color to his eyes.
Eleanor listened to her father's slow talk, her worried attention
meanwhile remaining with Phil Castleton. Yet she was aware of
Benteen and when he stopped by the doorway her glance went at
once to him, wondering if he meant to leave. He slouched against
the edge of the door, all loose and lank. His head turned and he
met her glance and held it until she felt something in his head,
as definite as speech, She brought her glance away.</p>

<p>Her father said: "This outbreak has just about tied up the
Territory. I am not too pleased with our tactics. I think the
Indians all through the country have been encouraged by Antone's
success. I do not know how long we can keep on his trail without
needing fresh horses."</p>

<p>Harrison said: "How in hell can the government expect to
police a section twice as big as New England with four scattered
regiments of cavalry?"</p>

<p>"The thing that defeats us," considered Warren, "is Antone's
mobility. It is like catching a shadow. If it were possible to
surprise or surround him I should take the whole force out
tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benteen spoke from the doorway; "Nachee says Antone is wearing
down."</p>

<p>Castleton spoke up, not quite able to conceal his suspicion.
"How does Nachee know?"</p>

<p>"The last warrior Ford brought in talked to Nachee. Antone is
apt to stop pretty soon and make a fight, out of
necessity&mdash;Or else he will lose his authority among the
people he leads: They are getting tired of traveling. So he'll
have to make medicine. Only medicine he can make is an
attack."</p>

<p>The hour call was then running from sentry to sentry, all
those voices level and strong in the hot dark. The guard at
number one post challenged through the night. They heard Ray
Lankerwell answer: "Officer and detail."</p>

<p>"Halt, officer and detail, Corpr'l of the guard, post number
one!"</p>

<p>Presently the clatter of the guard detail rose on the parade
and there was a soft, perfunctory exchange of words; and the
scuff of the inbound detail. The men in the room rose, anxious to
have the news; and afterwards Benteen stepped back from the
doorway to let Ray Lankerwell come in.</p>

<p>Alkali dust whitened Lankerwell's uniforin and clung like dry
flour paste to his sun-scorched cheeks. His eyelids were puffy
and his lips cracked; his voice was husky, his shoulders sagged
with a genuine fatigue.</p>

<p>He saluted the major. "Reporting back from detail, sir. We cut
a fresh trail in the Pinals and followed as long as we could.
Antone is shifting rather slowly through the hills, not inclined
to give much ground. I sighted his party in an extremely rough
location, at the bottom of a canyon, but could not come up to
attack. He had his women and children along. There was a large
number all told&mdash;fifty or sixty, I should think."</p>

<p>Warren said: "Join us, Mr. Lankerwell, when you have freshened
up."</p>

<p>Lankerwell left the room and Benteen resumed his position by
the door, staring at the dark parade. His long fingers drummed on
the dobe wall, which was a key to his frame of mind. Eleanor;
never quite getting him out of her thoughts, watched these rising
signals of restlessness. All the other officers had turned to
Warren and were silent, knowing that he would be coming to some
kind of a decision. Warren nursed his cigar at considerable
length; his round ruddy cheeks gravely established; and then
Benteeen turned, as if waiting for something he was certain would
come. Major Warren removed his cigar: "All right, Mr. Benteen. We
will try it."</p>

<p>Benteen left the room at once, his voice singing over the
parade. "McSween."</p>

<p>Major Warren rolled the cigar between his fingers, very
conscious of the continuing silence. Eleanor noticed the way his
words seemed to trouble him when he spoke. "Mr. Benteen suggested
a plan to me yesterday. There is a pattern in Antone's travels, a
kind of general retracing of his trails. We are wearing him down,
but it is also true he is wearing us down. It is noticeable that
he does not break away from these last few details as quickly as
he did with the first ones. He grows a little more careless,
apparently believing we will not close in. Mr. Benteen goes out
tonight, with Al Hazel and Nachee. He proposes to sight Antone
and to send the detail back. He will remain on scout with Al
Hazel and Nachee, and one or two extra troopers. He will follow
Antone, dropping his troopers back on the trail as he goes, as
couriers. At that time I shall take the command out."</p>

<p>Harrison said: "The young man will find himself exceedingly
lonely company in the middle of those hills, the damned savages
creeping an about him. Does he hope to keep out of sight?"</p>

<p>"There is some danger," admitted Warren. "However, Mr. Benteen
has an aptitude for this type of campaigning, He has studied it
very carefully and knows as much about Indian habits as any
officer in Arizona. Al Hazel has much confidence in him, which is
considerable recommendation. And he has been able to get more
information from Nachee than any other man. Otherwise, I should
not permit the risk."</p>

<p>Lanterns swung brightly along the parade and Sergeant
McSween's voice was solidly insistent. There was a racket in the
stables, a forming blackness in the shadows. A man shouted:
"Conway&mdash;where's Conway?"</p>

<p>The officers drifted out to watch and to listen, Eleanor put
her hand through Castleton's elbow and stood with him beneath the
ramada. Suddenly she wanted to hear him speak, to know what was
in his mind. For her father had given Benteen a free hand, which
was more than he had given any other officer in the post; and in
so doing he had shown a greater confidence in Benteen than in the
rest of the officers. All of them knew it as they stood here. The
knowledge was in Castleton's mind, undoubtedly rubbing against
his injured pride, burning away some of his tremendous faith in
himself, building up his resentment. And still he remained
silent. She pitied him then for all he was going through, sharing
his hurt, proud of the way he had so far this evening covered it
up, and drawn closer to him by it. Her hand tightened on his
elbow.</p>

<p>The troop was forming line, Sergeant McSween's deep voice
pushing at it. George Mixler suddenly detached himself from the
group and crossed to Benteen who stood by his horse. Mixler said:
"Tom, you're a hell of a fine soldier. I wish you all the luck.
Go say good-by to Harriet. She thinks a lot of you."</p>

<p>Benteen laid his long arm across Mixler's shoulder. "George,"
he said, "have you said everything to her you could say? She's
had a bad time. Remember that."</p>

<p>"No," murmured George Mixler, "I can't change her mind. She
won't listen."</p>

<p>Benteen turned to the Mixler quarters, ducking his head at the
low doorway. Lily Marr sat in the rear room, rocking the
crackerbox cradle; and Harriet lay on the bed. Her eyes came
around to Benteen, the stony memories fading out of them and a
pleased expression softening her lips. Lily Marr saw this, and
saw the way Benteen's face relaxed into a man's frank
appreciation of a woman; Lily Marr at once rose and quietly left
the dobe.</p>

<p>"Harriet," said Benteen, "you won't be here when I come back.
Isn't this post dull enough without your leaving and making it
duller?"</p>

<p>She took his hand and held it, tightly, as though wanting his
support. "Tom," she whispered, "I'm never coming back."</p>

<p>He looked at her, light running along the tanned side of his
face, and he nodded, as though he knew all that she felt. "Tough
on you and on the boy," he said. "It's wise for you to go up to
Apache and get out of the heat. As for going any farther away
than that&mdash;it is your problem alone. You'll be running away.
What from, Harriet? Better be sure it is something you won't want
any more. A man and a woman go through a lot the first year or
two. It is something you'll remember later&mdash;and no other man
will mean just the same to you. It is a hard country and the
army's a hard life. On all of us, Harriet. And you are giving
George the worst bump a man can get. But Lord bless you. Be a
good girl."</p>

<p>She had tears in her eyes. She whispered, "His name is Tom
George Mixler." Her hand pulled him down and her hands went
around his neck, and she kissed him. He remained in this awkward
shape a moment, touched by the lost and lonely feeling that was
in her. But he drew back smiling, and ran a finger through a
ringlet of her hair. "You're thinking of the fun you had as a
girl. You'll go back and try to be that girl again. But you'll
find that time's gone. You're an officer's wife with alkali in
your blood. Wait and see."</p>

<p>He turned out at once, disturbed by the forlorn look on her
face, and found Lily Marr waiting beneath the black-shadowed
ramada. He had put on his hat but he took it off again. "Lily,"
he said, "what are you going to do with Jack Bean?"</p>

<p>She was a strong shape in the dark, her shoulders squared
toward him and the round oval of her face vaguely shining up to
him. She didn't answer his question. She let the silence ride a
long while and then murmured, "Be careful of yourself," and
turned into the dobe.</p>

<p>Benteen walked directly to the cluster of officers, shaking
hands with them. Major Warren said: "It is entirely your
discretion, Mr. Benteen. My best wishes." Over on the parade the
detail counted off, those voices harking sharply into the soft
desert stillness. He came before Castleton, for a moment
undecided and uncertain&mdash;and wishing to make no scene. But
it was odd the way Castleton put out his hand. Everybody was
listening. Castleton's voice, cordial as it had never been
before, said: "Run him down, Tom. I shall cheerfully admit you
the better man if you do."</p>

<p>Benteen murmured, "A generous thought," and later felt the
light pressure of Eleanor's hand. She didn't speak and he could
not see her face; and he had nothing in his mind then that he
could safely say, and so turned back to the detail, swung to his
horse and took Sergeant McSween's report. Al Hazel drifted out of
the shadows with Nachee. Benteen said: "Right by twos, harch!"
The column broke into motion, wheeled by the commanding officer's
house, and passed into the dark. Thus Benteen left Camp Grant
behind him, heading toward the gap of Aravaipa Creek in the east.
The black mountain mass hovered before him and the bright stars
lay crystal-scattered across the endless heavens.</p>

<p>Eleanor held Castleton's arm while the other officers moved
away, her father into the house, Harrison and Ford toward the
sutler's store for their habitual nightcap. Lankerwell came up
and entered the house to see her father. She was alone with
Castleton.</p>

<p>"Phil," she said, "I'm very proud of you. And very
grateful."</p>

<p>"For what?" he said in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>"For being all that I thought you were. You made friends
tonight&mdash;friends you never had before."</p>

<p>The light from the dobe came out and touched them both. She
turned her chin upward, eager to hear his answer. He was smiling
and he seemed amused, but in the depths of his eyes she saw
something that cut her pleasure; it was a hot, stung expression
that he could not entirely hide. He said: "If that is the way the
game is played, Eleanor, I guess I can play it."</p>

<p>"A game? Wait, Phil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or whatever it is," he said, and walked away.</p>

<p>She put her shoulder against a post supporting the ramada,
watching his shape sink into the night. For a moment she had a
strong impulse to call him back and to hold him with her arms and
reassure him, in the hope that it would change him back to the
way he had been at the supper table. He was, she realized, going
through torment; the misery of it swayed him from side to side
until he was as unstable as sand. It hurt her to think of him
this way; it troubled her and brought on a faint doubt that
disturbed her loyalty.</p>

<p>The last echoes of Benteen's detail died in the night. The
moon-shot blackness closed down and the desert stillness closed
down and mystery trembled in windless air and the post seemed
drained of life. This, she realized in some surrise, was the way
it always was to her when Benteen left. Some sureness and some
pleasure and some deeply satisfying part of her life left with
him. There were, she thought with a growing unease, secret
impulses in her that would not answer to reason and would not be
suppressed; for now the memory of Benteen, his voice and his
smile and his aims around her, was uncontrollably near and real.
It struck her this suddenly and would not go, and left her
ashamed of the power it had over her will. In a way it was like
hunger. She turned quickly into the house, and began to talk to
Ray Lankerwell, needing this distraction to stop her
thoughts.</p>

<p><br> <br> Cowen walked into the sutler's store and showed the
sutler a face gripped by gloom. "If I was ten years younger, now,
I'd be in that detail. What is a man to think of, washin' pots
and pans after a life like I've had? Give me a quart of whisky,
Bell."</p>

<p>The sutler said: "A quart, Cowen?"</p>

<p>"For mince pie&mdash;I am going to make a mince pie!"</p>

<p>"Where," asked Bell, "did you get the mincemeat?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Cowen mysteriously, paid for the whisky and walked
out. He hugged the bottle under his arm, trailing completely
around the parade and coming at last to the bakeshop. He slipped
into the bakeshop's back room, uncorked the bottle and put it in
the middle of the table. He drew a chair to the table, sat down
and crossed his arms and stared at the bottle with his black
brows beetling above his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "ye smoke o' Satan, it is high time we had
this out. The temptation is on me, and we will wrestle. Drink is
a curse. It rots a man's mind and dulls his finer sensibilities,
it brings on cancer and the man in Scotland said it shriveled all
the flesh from his stomach. Drink&mdash;"</p>

<p>Half an hour later Cowen stepped from the bakeshop, walked
stolidly into the parade. He halted there, clutched the bottle by
its neck and threw it far away from him. He said, "Ah," and
belched splendidly and opened his mouth, suddenly howling:
"Apaches&mdash;Apaches! Hey guard&mdash;Apaches! I see the devils
right here!" There was a rush of feet along, the parade and the
yell of the sentry on Post Four. Lights sprang up around the
quadrangle and Howell Ford, officer of the day, ran from
headquarters. Cowen braced his feet apart, swayed like a tall
tree in a heavy wind and fell flat on his face. As the sentry on
Post Four ran up he heard Cowen say, deep in the dust: "Let go my
legs, you red murderers! Let go my legs!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

<p class="first">BEYOND midnight they camped in the rough country
northeast of Grant. In the first water-clear light of the
following morning they saw smoke signals spiral up in the
distance, to be repeated on another peak. Benteen spoke to Al
Hazel. "Ask Nachee what that is."</p>

<p>Al Hazel asked it and listened to Nachee's brief reply. "He
says it is a warning that we are here. They have seen us."</p>

<p>"Antone's band must be split again. Which one is Antone?"</p>

<p>Al Hazel did the interpreting. Nachee considered the smoke
signals a long while and shrugged his shoulders, speaking. "He
thinks maybe it is the one in the north," said Al Hazel.</p>

<p>"In the Mescals. That's the way we'll go. I want them to know
where we are aiming."</p>

<p>They ate bacon and hardtack&mdash;the hardtack fried in the
bacon grease&mdash;and bitter black coffee and went on, fording
the Gila and entering the rough country beyond it. They followed
the broken slopes of the Mescals, dipping from canyon to ridge,
and camped that night with a cone-shaped peak of the Pinals
directly facing them. That day they crossed numerous tracks.
Nachee said, through Al Hazel: "There has been a raid somewhere.
These are Antone's men coming back to the Pinals. You will find
Antone in there, maybe. He will have Chiricahuas with him." After
supper, as dark rolled quick and moon-luminous across the hills,
Nachee pulled up the folded leggings of his moccasins and faded
out of the camp.</p>

<p>"That," said Al Hazel, "is what an Injun loves. To crawl and
prowl, soft as a snake. Nachee's been peaceful so damned long
he's gettin' restless. So he's just havin' some fun. Note that
look in his eyes when he left? Shiny, like the eyes of a cat
switchin' its tail and thinkin' about trouble."</p>

<p>The day had been long and hot and dusty; and now the murmuring
of the troopers fell soon away and the camp turned silent beneath
the stars, with no soimd breaking it save the grind of the
sentry's feet against the rough soil. Benteen scraped out a
hollow for his hips, pillowed his head on the saddle and watched
the countless sweep of stars in the sky. Somebody stirred among
the sleeping men and, rising on an elbow, Benteen saw van Rhyn
crouch over the round, dull-shining remnant of the cook fire. Van
Rhyn's face, dully illumined, was old and slack-fleshed and
gripped by memories that would not let him sleep. Lying back on
his blanket, Benteen felt his kinship with all these men; and
knew what was in their minds and in their hearts. They would be
remembering the broken pattern of their lives, and chances gone,
the ambitions still unfulfilled or no longer to be hoped for, the
faces of women shining out of the past and the voices of women,
crying or angered or in laughter; the color and the heat of
certain high moments that, once experienced, would be warm to
them as long as life held; the mistakes that now woke a silent
groaning, the memory of barroom brawls that made them tighten
their muscles and feel strong. Awake, they would be remembering
all these things and they would be feeling a hunger for something
they could not name; in sleep all this would follow them through
incomplete dreams.</p>

<p>These were his men. He knew them, because he knew himself. The
memories were his, the hunger was his; and his also was the sense
of some great adventure passing him by while he grew old in the
dust and the common day.</p>

<p>It was in these hours when he couldn't keep physically busy
that the recollections of his own life were so vivid and keen. He
thought now, as he had in most hours of the past five years, of
Lucy Beauregard, recapturing the inflections of her voice and the
quickness of her up-slanting glance. Most of his life since had
been influenced by the constant picture she made in his mind.
Then&mdash;and this was a new turn of thinking for him&mdash;he
recalled what Eleanor Warren had told him he must do. The memory
of a woman in the past was a feeble light to a man; either the
woman had to be found again, or forgotten completely. He recalled
the softness of Eleanor's face as she had said it; and felt now
the nearness of her body as it had been at Fort Lowell, and the
gentle strike of her laughter in the dark. So thinking he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>Deep in the rough Pinals the following morning they came upon
a fresher trail. Antone's scattered people had collected and were
traveling ahead of him. A canyon struck into the northeast,
deepening and darkening and growing narrower as the surrounding
terrain lifted toward a prominent peak. At the canyon he stopped
and sent out small scout parties; around noon, with these parties
returned, he still had no complete story, and so took the detail
along the southern edge of the canyon for a matter of seven or
eight miles. Occasionally the print of an unshod hoof came out of
the south and dipped into the canyon, this happening often enough
to indicate some gathering of Apaches on the north side, in the
direction of the peak. Deciding this much, he found a trail into
the canyon. Nachee scouted its gravelly bottom and shook his
head, speaking to Al Hazel, who interpreted.</p>

<p>"Not this way. Up beyond, on the high land."</p>

<p>They spent an hour finding a narrow ledge leading them out of
the canyon to the north side, and within the next hour cut a
definitely fresh series of tracks. The way still was northeast
toward the high peak. All the surrounding country was badly
broken, rock shelter upon rock shelter and parallel ridges
separated by difficult ravines. Pines studded the land, and
cactus and catclaw and thin-scattered forage grass, In the middle
of the afternoon Benteen, searching for just such a location,
halted the detail on a ridge top that had a rocky outcrop around
it, affording considerable shelter from all directions. In here
he was high enough in the hills and deep enough behind the rocks
to be concealed from the scouting eyes of the Apaches. The detail
threw off for a rest while Benteen studied his pocket map. Nachee
began to draw pictures on the ground with a sage stem, speaking
to Al Hazel.</p>

<p>Al Hazel said: "He thinks Antone will be on that peak all
right. There's a natural park up there and a lot of mesquite
beans. Also a spring. But the country leading to it is pretty
tough for an attack. Nachee says he lived there as a
boy&mdash;sometimes hiding out from the Tontos when they came
down on their raids."</p>

<p>Benteen showed Hazel the map. "If Antone keeps on traveling it
is not apt to be east. That brings him too close to Fort Apache.
As soon as this detail pulls back to Grant I'd guess Antone will
do one of three things. He'll stay on that peak to rest, or go on
north across the Salt and into the Mazatzal Range, or do as he
had been doing before&mdash;come back this way. I think it is a
decent guess. Ask Nachee."</p>

<p>Nachee listened to Hazel, studied on it, and answered. Hazel
said: "He thinks Antone will drift back this way, to show his
warriors he is not afraid. And also to dig up mescal they've
probably got baking in pits around here."</p>

<p>"This is what we do," decided Benteen. "McSween takes the
detail back to Grant. Antone's scout will see him go. But you and
Nachee and I stay here. When dark comes we'll move on and do a
little scouting. The idea is to keep track of Antone's movements
until Major Warren comes up with the complete detachment."</p>

<p>He took a sheet of paper from his pocket and a pencil, and
wrote this note to Warren:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">By the enclosed map I indicate where we
are, and where Antone probably is. If Antone comes back this way,
we shall meet you when your column comes up. If Antone shifts
ground we shall follow, but I shall detail Nachee as a connecting
link to bring you on to our new location. Should Antone retreat
farther it will quite probably be toward the Mazatzals. In this
case, according to our tentative plan, I think it would be wise
to send part of a troop straight north, by night march, cross the
Salt and sweep around the northern base of the Mescals to
intercept any such shift, the main command meanwhile marching
directly to this point.</p>

<p class="letter">O'b'tly,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">T.C. Benteen</span></p>

<p><br>
He folded the note and handed it to McSween. McSween waggled a
finger at the troopers, who rose from the earth and were ready to
travel. But McSween nursed his black mustaches with the back of
his hand, reluctant to go. "Lieutenant," he said, "'tis a hell of
a country for three men to shtay in. Should ye not keep a few
more here?"</p>

<p>"Good luck, McSween," said Benteen.</p>

<p>"Ah, that," responded McSween. "I think I'll leave all my luck
here&mdash;for 'tis you that will be needin' it."</p>

<p>The detail swung up and passed back through the rocky fissures
of the ridge, soon dropping downgrade. From his position, Benteen
watched them sink deeper and deeper toward the canyon until the
double file was at last lost to his restricted sight. Just before
fading in the rough country McSween turned to look back, not
waving&mdash;for that would have been a betraying
gesture&mdash;but holding himself around in the saddle until he
disappeared.</p>

<p>Nachee squatted in the center of the area, staring at Benteen;
and suddenly he spoke to Hazel, asking an obvious question. Hazel
answered, whereupon Nachee grunted a thoughtful answer. Hazel
grinned at Benteen. "He wanted to know what we were doing. I told
him."</p>

<p>Nachee shook his head and spoke through Al Hazel. "Antone is a
fox, Nantan."</p>

<p>This was midaftemoon with a violent sun blasting the ridge top
and its few scattered pines. Benteen pulled the three horses to
the center of the bowl, which was its deepest part, in order to
keep them well out of sight; and the three men posted themselves
about the rocky outcrop, thus commanding a view of the
surrounding land. There was no higher ridge within three or four
miles of this spot and the rising basaltic rim which surrounded
the bowl concealed horses and men from the lower land.</p>

<p>Somewhere near five o'clock Benteen, looking northward through
a crack in the rocks, thought he saw a blur of motion on the
adjoining ridge, something that slipped from one cactus clump to
another. He called Nachee over. Nachee laid his eyes on that far
spot for a full five minutes, never turning a muscle; then he
said, through Hazel: "A small deer, Nantan."</p>

<p>Al Hazel said: "A deer now, but it will be Injun later. Antone
knows the detail is on the way home. He'll be scoutin' this
country." He repeated it in the Apache tongue and Nachee
said:</p>

<p>"They are close by now."</p>

<p>Nachee had turned away from the rocks and now crouched on the
earth; staring at the sky with his eyes half closed, as though
keening the dead hot air. The tail of his shirt hung between his
stringy legs, his arms lay idle across his knees and there was in
his face a complete muscular stillness. Nachee was in his fifties
and small of stature as most Apaches were; yet his cheeks were as
smooth as Benteen's and in his eyes a clear vitality glowed. His
hair, held by a single strip of red calico across the forehead,
showed as black as a crow's coat.</p>

<p>The sun dipped westward. When it touched the ragged rim of the
hills its livid-red ball seemed to break like the yolk of an egg,
spilling out against the domes and spires and rough-cut summits
of the Pinals. Light flashed in a thousand sharp splinters along
the sky, creating a fan-shaped aurora against the upper blue; and
then as suddenly as this spectacular burst showed, it faded and
the blueness of twilight trickled down the canyon slopes. The far
ridge lines, which Benteen watched quite closely, grew vague
before his eyes. Hot silence had covered this summit all day but
now, in twilight, the stillness seemed greater&mdash;so great
that the staccatto beat of a woodpecker came in rocketing waves
out of the distance. Nachee came off his haunches and walked to
the far end of the bowl, crouching beside a break in the
rocks.</p>

<p>Beyond this break the land fell sharply to the west, Al Hazel,
watching Nachee with a particular interest, came from his station
to the horses. He stood with his hand on the nose of his own
horse. Benteen dropped back to Hazel. "He sees somethin'," said
Hazel.</p>

<p>Benteen ducked over to the rocks, lying against them with his
head pushed against a crack. He discovered nothing, though he
swept the cactus-scattered slope carefully, He looked across to
Nachee, noting how taut Nachee's body was; Nachee was on one
knee, the other foot pushed behind him and ready to shove. He had
one hand dropped to the handle of his knife. Scanning the slope
again, Benteen saw an Indian rise from a mescal clump and come
up.</p>

<p>He walked at a low crouch, his head bent toward the earth.
Once he whipped straight, staring at the summit. Then he dropped
his head again, and advanced, now near enough for Benteen to hear
the small abrasion of his moccasins on the gravelly soil. Twenty
feet from the edge of the rocks where Nachee lay, the Indian
again halted and this time seemed to smell trouble. He went to
his knees, his hands propped against the earth like a runner
about to rush forward; and this position he held for a long half-
minute without stirring. The slope was steep enough to cut the
sight of the bowl; nor could he see the horses in its bottom. On
all fours he crawled another two yards and flattened completely
on the ground. At this moment Nachee moved.</p>

<p>Nachee sprang forward between the rocks with his arm whipping
up over his head. The Indian on the earth came straight up and
lunged at him; Nachee's knife hit him in the chest&mdash;the
sound of it dull and distinct in the silence&mdash;and drove
through the Indian's lungs. The Indian made one wild shout that
raced cleanly clear across the hills, dropped his hands and fell
at Nachee's feet. His body rolled a little way back down the
hill, lodging against a boulder.</p>

<p>Nachee reached down and wiped the blade against a grass clump
and trotted back to the bowl. Al Hazel came up, speaking to
Benteen. "That's bad. They could hear that Injun four miles
away." He talked to Nachee a minute and waited for Nachee's calm
reply. Then he translated the answer for Benteen.</p>

<p>"Nachee says that Injun knew we were here. He knew it when he
fell on his stomach. We got to pull out of here."</p>

<p>Nachee pointed to the dead Indian. "Chiricahua&mdash;not
Aravaipa. Plenty Chiricahuas with Antone, maybe, Nantan."</p>

<p>The three walked to their horses. The last daylight had gone;
the half-moon flushed a pale indistinct glow against all the
black edges of the surrounding ridges. At this elevation a breath
of cooling wind came with the night, immensely relieving after
the long ordeal of the sun. Benteen took a short drink from his
canteen while Nachee spoke to Hazel.</p>

<p>Hazel said: "He thinks we ought to go on without the horses.
They make too much track. If Antone's scouts come across the
tracks they'll find us before tomorrow is far along."</p>

<p>"How far is it to that peak where Antone is?"</p>

<p>"'Bout twelve-fifteen miles."</p>

<p>Benteen thought about it. "Too long a walk. We'd be dragging
around the country all night, no telling where Antone goes
meanwhile. We've got to get near him. We'll keep the horses and
take the chance. Tell Nachee to aim for the peak."</p>

<p>Hazel gave the order to Nachee who grunted, "Enju," and
climbed on his horse. They left the bowl, traveled down the slope
and fell into a black trough between ridges, pointing due east at
the high coned shape of that peak where Antone seemed to be. The
footing was gravelly and they made a distinct racket as they
traveled; yet Nachee apparently preferred this to the softer
earth for somewhere farther on he turned into another creek bed,
followed this until it dwindled out, climbed over a low ridge and
took to still another gravel course, so advancing eastward by a
kind of right-angled indirection which ate up considerable time,
At midnight, from a high point, they sighted the tall peak again.
It lay now in the south. Nachee had cut a wide circle.</p>

<p>He had also brought them upon a shallow trickle of water in
the rocks. Stopped to drink and rest, Benteen estimated the time
to elapse before the troops from Grant could come up.</p>

<p>"McSween will get back tomorrow noon. Major Warren will
probably start out that night. By a straight march he ought to
reach the meeting place day after tomorrow morning. Thirty hours.
Not long."</p>

<p>"Long enough." said Al Hazel, "if those devils get to smellin'
us."</p>

<p>"That's why we can't try it afoot. Should Antone start back
through the hills we've got to keep to his trail."</p>

<p>"Ain't as bad as tryin' to fill to a pair of deuces," said
Hazel, dryly, "but still it is considerable of a try. You got a
level head, Lieutenant, or I sure wouldn't be out here now." He
was lying on the ground. Suddenly he heaved himself erect with a
quick outlet of violent profanity and began slapping his clothes.
"Damnation. I been sittin on an anthill."</p>

<p>He kicked around the darkness, making considerable noise, and
came back to Benteen, his tone somewhat shamed. "I'll spit in the
eye of a diamondback any time and I have shook a lot of
centipedes outa my blankets. But them damned ants give me the
creepin' twitters, ever since Long Jack Bell's time."</p>

<p>"Never heard of him."</p>

<p>"My partner, back in '65. This was a pretty empty country
then. We used to prospect clear up tords the Mokyones. Wasn't any
troops around here and the Injuns had chased all the Mexicans
into Tucson. It was a bad time, for fair. We was over in the
Basin, Jack and me, knowin' better than to be there but havin' a
hell of a good time, just trappin' and prospectin', when up comes
a band of Tontos and jumps our camp. That's pretty rough country:
I got away and hid in a hole in the rocks. But they caught Long
Jack and had some fun of their own. I guess I was half a mile
away but I sure heard him holler till he couldn't holler no more.
You understand, Lieutenant? Jack was no hollerin' man, but he did
then. They beat the country for me and didn't find me&mdash;and
pulled out. I crawled back to where the cattle had been and saw
whut was left of Jack. They'd cut off his eyelids and staked him
over an anthill, facin' the sun. The ants sure took care of Jack.
Never had much use for an ant since then. Never had much use for
a Tonto, either. Which they know. I been huntin' them fer seven
years and they been huntin' me. So far the best o' the bargain's
been mine, but I sure can figure better places for old Al Hazel
to be right now than here."</p>

<p>"How'd you get out of that fight?"</p>

<p>"Crawled back to a minin' camp, which was about eighty miles
away."</p>

<p>"Crawled?"</p>

<p>"The walkin' wasn't good," said Hazel. "One of those Tonto
bullets busted my laig."</p>

<p>They went on in the first hours after midnight, falling into
the canyons and arroyos crisscrossing these hills, and climbing
back to ridge tops from which they took their bearings on the
tall peak. Presently they came to the black crack of a canyon
whose walls dropped sheer to an unknown depth, whereupon Nachee
followed the rim until he found a thin crevice for a trail and
led them to the bottom; A creek boiled against the rocks,
apparently shutting off passage. Nachee, who had been aiming for
this spot all night, took at once to the water and kept to it for
a tedious mile or more, winding with the rocks and leading the
horses breast-deep through occasional pools. Later they ascended
a risky trail, reached the canyon's other run and came at last to
a pine flat, beyond which the land rose again.</p>

<p>Nachee spoke to Al Hazel, who relayed the talk to Benteen.
"Not far now. We leave the horses here."</p>

<p>Benteen followed Al Hazel afoot across the soft under-footing
of the pine flat. Now and then Al Hazel stopped, putting back a
hand to warn Benteen. In these intervals Nachee slipped away, was
gone; and came back without the least sound, to lead them forward
again. They crossed the flats and reached the foot of a short
slope, once more halting. Al Hazel's tobacco-scented breath
fanned Benteen's face. "Up there. Be a little careful whar you
step."</p>

<p>They faded against the earth, climbing on all fours and
halting to listen and climbing again across the cacti and stony
soil. Benteen eased his weight against his arms, placing each
boot toe gently; he laid his palm against the scratchy body of a
horned toad, and in jerking back almost lost his balance. One
pine tree stood on the summit above him, vaguely traced against
the star-glittering sky. At intervals he saw Al Hazel's rump rise
and go on and fall. This was the way they traveled, foot by foot,
along the last piece of that grade; and finally reached the crown
of the hill and stopped and lay side by side, flat to the earth
with their heads hooked over a roll of land.</p>

<p>The Indian camp lay slightly below them in a natural clearing,
a hundred feet on. The remnant of a fire glowed round and red in
the clearing's center. About it were the scattered shape of
sleeping figures and the outline of Indian camp utensils and
horse packs. The horses were in a bunch beyond the fire,
identified by the occasional sneeze and stir of their browsing.
One figure slipped in from the dark, crouched over the fire a
moment, and cupped his hands, as though eating something. And as
he did so a voice came from all those rolled-up shapes, a white
man's loud, half-desperate and half-defiant voice:</p>

<p>"If I had one arm free, you godblasted red wolf, I'd sure take
my chances on runnin' fer it."</p>

<p>Benteen's head jerked upward; he heard Al Hazel's sweep of
surprised breathing. The Indian at the fire didn't turn, didn't
pay attention. But at the same time another indian crossed the
clearing and came by the fire. He stopped and kicked one of those
shapes&mdash;the white man's shape&mdash;with a full swing of his
leg and walked out of the firelight again, coming straight toward
this rise of ground where Benteen lay.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

<p class="first">AS soon as McSween returned to Grant with the
detail, Major Warren sent for Captain Harrison.</p>

<p>"Both troops will prepare to leave tonight with rations for a
week and a pack train to carry extra ammunition. After the column
pulls out Mr. Lankerwell will split off with twenty men from K
and go straight north, circling the Mescals. I want all equipment
and horses carefully inspected. Leave behind nothing but a
skeleton guard. We will take all the officers. Sergeant Oldbuck
will remain here in charge of the post until Mr. Ford returns
from Apache. We march at dark."</p>

<p>Captain Harrison left and presently the long sultry quiet of
the post gave way to a brisk activity. Men overhauled their boots
and belts, replenished their canteens, drew rations for the march
and, in many instances, wrote long-deferred letters home. Some of
them, according to common custom, made oral wills, disposing of
their belongings to this bunkmate or that friend&mdash;and
arranging for certain other trinkets and valuables to be shipped
home in event of death. It was all part of the routine preceding
a march into Indian country; for every man knew Major Warren
intended to bring on a fight if it were possible and they also
knew, through the returned McSween, that Benteen had sighted
Antone. The troopers had tremendous faith in Benteen. If he had
sighted Antone and planned to keep him under observation until
Warren arrived, it was pretty good proof that a fight was at
hand.</p>

<p>Coming back from the stables in the middle of the afternoon,
Harry Jackson found van Rhyn crosslegged on the adjoining bunk,
sorting out his personal effects&mdash;a few old letters, a
picture cut from a magazine, some clippings from a newspaper, a
tintype of a small girl, and a gold wedding ring. These he had
folded into a handkerchief, and now twisted the ends of the
handkerchief together. He called Harry Jackson's attention to the
handkerchief as he pushed it under the head of his straw
mattress. "Harry," he said, "if I don't come back, you take that
bundle and mail it away for me."</p>

<p>"Where's the address?"</p>

<p>Van Rhyn tapped the pocket of his shirt. "You will find it in
here."</p>

<p>"You'll come back," said Harry Jackson.</p>

<p>"There's an end for all of us," van Rhyn answered gently. "By
one cause or another, mine is not far away."</p>

<p>Harry Jackson sat on the edge of his bed. He made a gesture
with his hands. "Hell, Van, there's nothing to fear."</p>

<p>Van Rhyn smiled quietly, "I had not mentioned fear, Harry.
Fear is for the young ones who love life too much. When I was
younger I was afraid to die. I used to lie awake, thinking about
it. I used to reach forward with my mind trying to overtake the
moment death came, trying to discover how I would act and how I
would feel&mdash;and it was pretty bad. But there is nothing to
fear, Harry. Little by little as a man grows older he gets
callous, his senses grow dull and his mistakes and his hurts slow
him down and the fun of living fades away. After a while he
ceases to care very much, or to fight very much, or to feel very
much. After that it is a matter of waiting. I shall be glad to
go."</p>

<p>"That's no way to talk," said Harry Jackson.</p>

<p>"You are young and you have everything to hope for. That makes
all the difference. Never be philosophical, Harry. Never play the
game safe when your heart tells you to gamble. Life is mostly a
matter of damned, contemptible conventions, and hypocrisies and
cheating devices and pleasant fictions hiding a brutal system.
One or two, or maybe three, things ever matter to a man. Those
you should live by and live for. Everything else is just so much
claptrap. This world is governed by the pack. The pack sets up
the rules and it punishes the man who will not live by those
rules&mdash;just as the wolf pack kills or drives off the lone
ones who will not bend to the rules: Never let the pack govern
your life. Do what your conscience tells you is right, follow
your own star, and be your own master."</p>

<p>Harry Jackson stared at the older man, not wholly
understanding. Van Rhyn, ordinarily so quiet and so removed from
the rough talk and horseplay of the barracks, showed him a pair
of bright, bitter eyes, There was in this man, then the last
flare of an old vitality, the final glow of a fire once very
strong. Harry Jackson said: "What two or three things matter,
Van?"</p>

<p>"You will have to find out those things for yourself, Harry.
When you do find out, you'll be an old man, as I am now. If you
have played the game right the knowledge will be a comfort to
you. If you have not, your last days will be in that purgatory
Dante created out of whole cloth."</p>

<p>"How's a man to know?" murmured Harry Jackson.</p>

<p>Van Rhyn's smile was soft and understanding; his resentment
died. "Ah, I wish I could tell you. I have read all the
philosophers, but they could not tell me. Make your own answers,
Harry. Depend on others for nothing. For nothing at all." He
tapped his breast pocket again. "There's three hundred dollars in
here. When you take out the address also take the money. It is
yours."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Harry Jackson, completely astonished.</p>

<p>Van Rhyn pressed the sweat across his forehead. His face was
tight-pulled and weary; he was old. "For a drink, for a poker
hand, for a woman, for the start of a career. For anything,
Harry, that will squeeze one more drop of flavor from the rind of
the orange, which is tasteless enough at best. Someday you will
understand."</p>

<p>Troopers crossed and recrossed the parade. Men walked their
horses around the corral, watching for bruised feet and bad
tendons; the sound of the blacksmith's hammer rang metally
through the heated day; a detail crossed the Aravaipa to bring
fresh mounts from the nearby corral and Indians from Nachee's
camp began to collect under the shade of the ramadas. Ray
Lankerwell came to post headquarters reporting to Major
Warren.</p>

<p>Warren said: "As soon as we leave tonight you will break off
and take your detail directly north, past the Mescals. Turn east
into the Pinals, about at this point on the map. You are not to
bring on a fight but rather to make a show of forces that will
push Antone back should he have intentions of traveling north. If
you see nothing in front of you, and no fresh sign, close in
southward toward this spot." He indicated it with his thumb. "I
shall be somewhere near there. Pete George will go as your guide,
If you see evidence of a strong force, send a messenger through
to me. If you are not held up I expect you to join me at the
earliest moment."</p>

<p>The supper call was running all around Fort Grant's parade and
the sun lay half down the western horizon when Lily Marr came
from the Warren house and crossed to the jail. The guard was just
then bringing up a tin of food from the mess hall. Lily Marr
stood back while he unlocked the cell door, slid the tin plate
into the cell and closed the door again. She waited until the
guard had replaced the key on the high corner of the dobe wall
and turned away.</p>

<p>Jack Bean stood with his face at the bars. He put his hands
around the bars, his fingers slowly closing, tightly closing.
Blond hair fell down across his forehead, almost agamst his eyes.
He had been in this cell a week, tramping its narrow space,
enduring its breathless heat. The effect of it showed on him,
pulling in the centers of his cheeks and painting a dismal color
in his eyes. He hadn't shaved and he hadn't slept much and all
this wore him thin and nervous, and left him like a caged wolf
slowly dying for want of appetite and air. He stared at Lily
Marr, too bitter to speak, while she showed him that old,
unrelenting calm.</p>

<p>"A messenger," she said, "went up to Summerton's and told them
about the money. They have probably gone to Tucson to get it by
now. The marshal won't come for another week. But when he does
come he'll take you back with a party of soldiers. Bill Hanley
won't help you out of this. You're at the end of the rope."</p>

<p>"Lily," he said, "I'll get loose. Before God, I will. And I'll
pay you back&mdash;and I'll pay the captain back. I'll pay
everybody back."</p>

<p>"No," she said; in the same rubbing, insistent calm, "you
never will. This time the wheel stopped on your number and you
pay off for what's been done."</p>

<p>His question jumped at her. "What've I done?"</p>

<p>"Maybe you better start thinking about that. You never had
time to think about it before, but you've got a lot of time now.
Better think of those burnt wagons and the Mexican yelling when
the bullet hit him. You remember how he yelled, Jack? I do."</p>

<p>"A Mexican," said Jack Bean, "is nothin' but a Mexican."</p>

<p>"Maybe you better think of Bill Goff."</p>

<p>He answered that swiftly. "Bill knew I was after him. I never
catch a man without a gun. He saw me comin' and he had his
draw."</p>

<p>"Maybe you better think of Charley Brewerton."</p>

<p>"He made his remarks about me, Lily. When a man makes his
remarks he's got to stand the consequences. I walked down the
middle of the street at him, and I waited till he reached for his
gun."</p>

<p>"Maybe you better think of Charley Brewerton's wife who takes
in washing to live. Or Bill Goff's little girl, who's got no
parents left now."</p>

<p>He pulled up his chin. "That's somethin' those fellows should
have figured out before they got proud. I'll stand my mistakes;
they should stand theirs."</p>

<p>"Then stand yours now," said Lily Marr. "You are going to die
for them."</p>

<p>"Lily," said Jack Bean, "when a man calls me into question
I'll see him answered, till hell freezes over. I take nothing
from nobody."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lily Marr. "You'll take anything they've got,
cattle or money or horses. Charley Brewerton said you were a
thief. That's why you shot him. But you're still a thief,
Jack."</p>

<p>"Listen, girl," begged Jack Bean in a furious voice, "there's
ways of lookin' at that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just two ways. The honest way and the thief's way."</p>

<p>Bean cursed Lily Marr and swung away from the door. She heard
his heels kick into the floor. She heard his fists slap against
the dobe wall; she heard the in and out sawing of his breath. The
sun dropped down and twilight suddenly came and men were moving
out of the mess shack. The trumpeters came across the parade to
take stand by the number one post, from which point all calls
were sounded. Lily Marr's voice, as even and colorless as fate,
followed Jack Bean into the jail.</p>

<p>"You always talked about your rights. Maybe you better think
of other people's rights. You never liked the idea of any man
being as quick as you were with a gun. You had to shoot him to
find out if he was. You couldn't stand the thought of anybody
being better. If they were better you wanted to kill them. But
there are better men in Arizona than you'll ever be. You never
thought there was anything strong enough to hold you in one
place. Well, here you are, Jack."</p>

<p>He said, from the depths of the jail: "I'll get loose, by
God."</p>

<p>"Nobody will remember you when you're dead. Nobody will
remember where you're buried because in all this country you
haven't got one friend who cares enough to put a board up to mark
your grave. Someday, a few years from now, somebody will say:
'Who was Jack Bean?' And somebody else will say: 'He was a small-
time tinhorn who went around waving a gun making believe he was
big.' I guess that's about it. Just a tinhorn who never had sense
enough to stop and think. What've you got to be proud about?"</p>

<p>She waited for him to answer, but he didn't answer and he
didn't come back to the door. Twilight rolled around the post and
suddenly the trumpeters were blowing the quick, peremptory call
To Horse and troopers began to form on the parade. Lily Marr went
back to the Warren quarters and stood there.</p>

<p>A few minutes earlier Phil Castleton had come over to say
good-by to Eleanor. Now they stood in the shadows of the post
bakery, turned silent by the trumpets. Eleanor watched
Castleton's face come alive with its old, rash eagerness; even in
the shadows she observed his old temper flare up and she knew
that if the chance came to him he would throw his whole future
career and friendships and life itself, into a last gamble. The
thought worried her: it depressed her and made this moment
unpleasant. She said "Phil" very softly, but he had turned and
was looking across the parade at the forming troops and his
thoughts had gone away from her; and then she had one more cold
shocking suspicion: There was so great a desire in him that
nothing else could find a place, perhaps not even love, as she
understood love to be.</p>

<p>She said: "Phil, I wish you luck."</p>

<p>That turned him. He was smiling and his whole face changed
under excitement. He said in a rapid voice: "This time I think
we'll catch up with Antone."</p>

<p>"Whether you do or don't, Phil, I'll still be here when you
return."</p>

<p>"I'll bring you back his scalp. I'll do better. I'll count a
coup on him. I'll touch him and say as Indians say, 'Now your
spirit is mine and I am a great warrior.'"</p>

<p>"I'll still be here, Phil," she prompted him patiently.</p>

<p>He laughed outright and brought her against him and kissed
her; there was at the moment no gentleness to him, no
thoughtfulness, none of that small and faintly sad uncertainty of
a man going away from something desirable, possibly forever. He
kissed her and let her go, and still smiling, he walked at a fast
long stride over to his troop. There was an echoing roll call in
the dusk and the slap and strike of gear and stepping horses and
moving feet; all this rose to a certain key that stirred the
camp. George Mixler ran forward and shook her hand and looked at
her quite closely.</p>

<p>"Sometime in the future I wish you'd write Harriet a note. Say
that you think she did the right thing. It will please her and
make everything else a little easier for her mind."</p>

<p>"George, why say that?"</p>

<p>"I've got a feeling about this trip. It doesn't matter at all,
of course. I'm glad we're going. My love to you, Eleanor, and
good-by."</p>

<p>He ran into the shadows. The men were counting numbers and
afterwards the sergeants of K and I swung exactly around on their
heels, reporting troops. Eleanor saw her father shift in the
saddle and listened to his steady voice sing out the commands.
There was a blur of all these men, rising to saddle and the slap
of legs and the grunt of the mounts; and this, to her, was part
of a memory that went away back into her childhood, the same
routine, the same sound and the same quick rush of excitement and
eagerness&mdash;and the shock of pride running through her from
seeing her father turn his horse, from hearing his voice sing out
the marching order. The long line broke and wheeled into colunin
of twos; swung eastward through the guard gate, passed it and
rattled on the stones of Aravaipa Creek; and then, long after,
sank into the deep silence of the hills.</p>

<p>Presently the post was a lifeless row of buildings under the
glittering Arizona sky. Eleanor stood with her shoulders to the
bakery shop wall, hearing the shuffling of the sentries, then
slowly closing fear out of her mind. Waiting was always the
hardest part, but this was the army and this was the whole
meaning of army life&mdash;this moment when the troops swung
away, outward bound on campaign. Somewhere deep in her mind was a
recurring image of Castleton; it lay back below other thoughts
just now, vaguely stirring, vaguely troublesome. She let it be
so, afraid to bring it forward and see it for what it was.</p>

<p>There had been, at that last moment, one more scene. Standing
by his horse, waiting the command to mount, Harry Jackson saw
Rose Smith come out from the barrack wall and stop by Canreen.
She had something in her hand. She pushed it into Canreen's
pocket and then said: "Be good, Mitch."</p>

<p>Mitch laughed out his assurance. "Never you mind, Rose, I'll
bring back a pair o' moccasins&mdash;"</p>

<p>The order to mount stilled him. Up in the saddle, Harry
Jackson turned to watch Rose Smith's face. It pointed toward him,
white and still in the shadows. Major Warren's order swung the
troops into line and they moved out to the guard gate. Rose Smith
walked quickly forward, abreast Harry Jackson's horse. She said,
small-voiced: "Be good, Harry." After that Harry Jackson passed
through the gate and he saw no more of her.</p>

<p>At Camp Apache, that same night, Harriet Mixler stood by the
open window of her room, staring into the southwest where Grant
lay. She had arrived at the post this same morning and Major
McClure's wife, looking at her pallid face and alarmed by the
completely exhausted sound of her voice, had immediately taken
the baby from her. So she stood now alone in this room, dressed
for bed and deeply breathing the cool air of the high
hills&mdash;the first refreshing breath she could remember in
many months. This was heaven compared to Grant, the dreary trip
was behind her, and the baby was in good care. It was beyond
taps, with the post asleep. Adjoining her room was the room of
young Lieutenant Kessler and his wife. She heard them talking,
she heard Kessler's laugh and the suppressed reply of the woman;
and then the closing silence left her thoroughly alone and
friendless and let-down. She put her hand to the window sill,
watching the black crooked outline of the southwestern skyline,
and went down into her own empty thought.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

<p class="first">BENTEEN watched the restless Apache cross the
camp site and slowly climb the grade. Al Hazel was beside
Benteen, so near that Benteen could hear the ticking of the
guide's huge stem-wind watch. In this silence the sound seemed
loud enough to warn the Indian, now about forty feet away and
closing up the distance with a catlike pacing. As he advanced his
stringy shape was silhouetted by the ruby glow of the fire embers
behind him. He had his head down and he swung it from side to
side as though scooping information out of the air, for his ears
and his nose. At twenty feet the slope lifted hm until his
shoulders were on a line with Benteen's eyes and his course was
dead against Benteen.</p>

<p>Al Hazel was still motionless; Nachee had lost himself
somewhere in the dark. Benteen, knowing this next moment was
nothing but a gamble, laid a strong muscular strain on his arms,
holding them still. There was a chance yet; and the chance
presently came.</p>

<p>The white man in the Apache camp suddenly began to howl. He
didn't say anything, he didn't speak any intelligible words; he
only yelled, the pure sound pouring out of his lungs and carrying
all over the hills.</p>

<p>The Indian crouched by the fire didn't bother to move but the
one now within three paces of Benteen stopped and turned and
called back to the man by the fire. That one said something,
still not moving, whereupon the Indian near Benteen went rapidly
down the slope. Figures began to stir on the ground, wakened by
the white man's continuous screaming. Two shapes trotted in from
the far edge of the flat. The white man, Benteen realized, had
gone crazy from thinking of what lay before him. The Indian who
had walked down the slope now reached the white man and stood a
moment over him, grunting in Apache, but the white man,
apparently tied hand and foot, rolled along the ground, his cry
growing thinner and higher and wilder. Abruptly the Indian turned
aside, seized a gun from the ground and brought its butt twice
down on the white man's head, killing him instantly.</p>

<p>The crushing sound of that gun butt against bone skull
traveled up the slope and made Benteen dig his fingers into the
dirt; it went slowly through him as a wave of sick, soft feeling.
The Indian stood over the white man and smashed his head once
more.</p>

<p>He walked near the fire-glow, slowly turning as if to retrace
his path up the slope again, and at this moment Al Hazel's elbow
dug into Benteen, and they gently backed down from the top of the
ridge. They waited under the pines, missing Nachee. Al Hazel
murmured: "That was Ben Stevens, Lieutenant. And he was
smart."</p>

<p>"Crazy," suggested Benteen.</p>

<p>"Not him," countered Hazel. "He knew whut was in front of him,
So he made 'em mad and got it over with quick."</p>

<p>When Nachee arrived it was so softly that they didn't see him
until he whispered at Hazel. Al Hazel murmured: "He says this is
Antone's main camp. Antone is in that bunch. Nachee thinks there
is another camp farther along the ridge. Whut's your idea
now?"</p>

<p>Benteen whispered: "How many up there?"</p>

<p>"Maybe twenty-five or thirty. Which is why Nachee figures
there's another camp. Antone's got a strong party in these
hills."</p>

<p>Benteen crouched against the base of a pine tree, calculating
his time. It was near three o'clock, with a faint paleness to the
star-shine and a faint change in the sky, from metal black to
lesser black. In another hour or more daylight would be along.
Silence hung to the hills, deeper than any silence in the world,
the silence of motionlessness, the silence of that hour when even
the night-prowling animals had fallen asleep and the sibilant,
furtive voices of earth insects had ceased. This was the cool
hour, with the scent of pine and the scent of aromatic vegetation
clinging to the air; and this was the ebb hour when a man's mind
grew dull and his hope sank down and his vitality ran out. After
a day and a night of steady going, Benteen felt it. There was no
push in him at all.</p>

<p>He said, in a toneless murmur: "We'll back out of here. Tell
Nachee to pick a high spot across the canyon, where we can watch
the country and keep an eye on Antone if he moves."</p>

<p>Al Hazel's arm hit Benteen in quick warning; and Hazel faded
against the pine trunk, blending with its black up-and-down
shadow. Nachee was out of sight. In the nearing distance was the
faint scrape of a moccasined foot. One of Antone's warriors had
come to the rim surrounding the camp, and now kept advancing.</p>

<p>The trees made a thin scatter along the land, and rock hummock
here and there built up deeper spots of shadow; and so it was
difficult to catch the outline of a moving shape. Benteen saw him
first as a faint streak of motion, forty feet away. He came on,
disappeared behind a rock mound, and reappeared within four paces
of where Benteen stood. This was as near as he got, for he made a
quarter turn and slid by the trees at a quick, almost soundless
shuffle and headed westward toward the canyon. And, Benteen
suddenly realized, toward the horses.</p>

<p>He was still a gray shape against the night when Nachee's
shape rose from the rocks and closed in. Those two shapes at once
violently blended and there was a sharp scuffle, the 'tunk' of a
knife driving home, and the little disconnected rustle of a body
loosely falling on the flinty soil. One shadow trotted back,
which was Nachee. He murmured something to Hazel and thereafter
all three of them walked to the horses and retraced the way into
the canyon.</p>

<p>Complete blackness smothered them as they reached the canyon's
bottom and threaded the creek southward a mile or more; when they
rose from it, now on the west rim, a gray break showed low in the
eastern sky. Nachee led them steadily into higher and rougher
country. They passed through rocky defiles that covered them
completely from the freshening morning twilight, across piny
flats, between masses of catclaw and mesquite; and at last, in
the first full sunlit hour of day, they reached a broken-topped
elevation above a narrow pass which cut irregularly east and west
through the hills.</p>

<p>There was some shelter here and a view from all angles.
Looking over the rocks surrounding them on three sides, Benteen
saw how hard a country it was and realized then how easily Antone
had escaped every detail sent after him. There was no clear trail
in any direction; nothing but these rough ridges broken by deep
draws and sudden canyons, and slopes whereon broken rock lay
blackly in the growing light, Benteen scouted the surrounding
terrain with his glance seeing nothing that moved. Westward at
the end of the pass stood the butte to which he had brought the
detail the day before. This was about six miles distant.</p>

<p>Al Hazel had already gouged himself a place on the ground and
had pillowed his head on an arm, taking a quick rest. Nachee
squatted in the middle of the small space; he had his arms over
his knees, His head was tipped up and he was watching the sky
with an expressionless, unmoving attention, as though he waited
for the sky to tell him something.</p>

<p>Al Hazel drawled: "Makin' medicine. It is his religion,
Lieutenant. The sky and the earth&mdash;and water. I ain't an
educated man but it is my observation that a man's religion
usually narrows down to whut he needs most. An Injun lives right
against the earth. When he prays, somethin' like you and me; it
is fer the water to last and the mesquite beans to be plentiful,
and fer the sun to be kind. Ain't a bad religion. What more could
any man want? Nachee right now is seein' things in that sky you
and me wouldn't."</p>

<p>Nachee spoke to Al Hazel, who said: "We got a couple-three
hours to sleep. Nachee will take first watch." Benteen spread out
on the ground, gouged a hole for his hips and shoulders and
pulled his hat over his face, A stray thought ran through his
mind and was never completed, for he sank into the luxury of
pure, depthless sleep at once.</p>

<p><br> <br> The burning of sun against his skin woke him in the
middle of another sweltering morning. Al Hazel slept on, snoring
steadily through his open mouth. Nachee lay between a rock cleft,
watching the pass and the land east of the pass, which was where
Antone's camp lay. Benteen took a swallow of flat water from his
canteen and stood up to kick life into his legs. Nachee's head
turned at the sound, whereupon Benteen pointed to the ground.
"Better sleep." Nachee grunted and turned back to his
observations. But he said something over his shoulder which drew
Benteen forward. Edging himself into the rocks so that his head
wouldn't show over the rim, Benteen set his eyes on the eastern
end of the pass. The sun struck the land at a long angle, turning
it gray and brown, and against this light he made out nothing
until the flash of a metal object telegraphed across the
distance. Centering his glance on that spot he at last saw a file
of Indians crossing over; they were leaving the camp of the night
before and going over to the high ground on the south side of the
pass.</p>

<p>Al Hazel strangled on his snoring and sat up. When he saw
Benteen shouldered into the rocks he came over to have his look,
at once locating the Indians. He spoke to Nachee and listened to
the reply.</p>

<p>"Nachee says that's all men. No women or young ones. So
Antone's just looking around, not breakin' camp."</p>

<p>"Circling back in the direction of Grant," said Benteen.
"That's the way he did it before."</p>

<p>Al Hazel sat on the ground and rubbed his shoulders.
"Rheumatism again. Always get it in the hills. I butchered an
arrow out of this arm ten years ago and I still feel the damned
thing." He looked pretty tough, his long lips pulled together as
though he tasted something acid. A short beard covered most of
his face; beneath his eyes the skin pouched up, giving him an
expression that was both shrewd and dissipated. When he removed
his hat a round bald spot began to shine. He was, Benteen knew,
not more than forty, but a hard and active and sometimes
extremely rough life had prematurely aged him. He washed out his
mouth with a drink of water and refreshed himself with a chew
from his plug. The taste of the tobacco at once brightened
him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Benteen moved to the north side of the rocks and
began to watch the land they had crossed by dark. That way the
country lay in a complete tangle of intersecting arroyos through
which Antone's warriors might crawl in complete cover until they
arrived at the wall of rock surrounding this small peak. He
mentioned this to Al Hazel.</p>

<p>"I guess they'll be down there some place," agreed Hazel.
"Just a question of how long it takes 'em to find our trail out
of the canyon. Soon as they spot two horses shod and one barefoot
they'll know who's here."</p>

<p>The long morning rolled on. Near noon Benteen distributed
hardtack from his saddlebags. He broke his own piece into a tin
cup and soaked it with water. Nachee slipped his ration into his
shirt pocket. Al Hazel made no pretense of eating. "I reckon I'd
just as soon go hungry, Lieutenant, till I can get me some
meat."</p>

<p>At two o'clock Al Hazel spotted a file of Indians crossing the
pass a few miles westward. "That's Antone, cuttin' a circle," he
said. "He's lookin' at the tracks of the detail you sent home.
And he'll be followin' our trail now, from the other end."</p>

<p>In the long burning middle afternoon hours Benteen saw a
warrior rise from an arroyo at the eastern base of this summit
and look steadily upward. Presently he dropped from sight. A
little later two of them showed again, mounted, and struck up the
slope, cutting a wide detour, They were in and out of sight,
beyond a carbine's range. Benteen and Al Hazel&mdash;who had come
over to watch&mdash;saw the pair reach a high point and disappear
westward; somewhere in that direction the larger party of Indians
now rode.</p>

<p>Al Hazel considered the sun. He hauled his watch out of his
vest pocket and said "four-thirty," and snapped the hunting case
shut. "Four hours till dark, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>The sun beat down into this shadeless spot and the rocks began
to burn, trapping and building up the heat. Benteen knotted a
handkerchief around his neck. The backs of his hands began to
blister, the skin around his ears pulsed whenever the
handkerchief rubbed it; blood collected in his eyeballs,
enlarging them and changing his vision.</p>

<p>In the adjoining heights northward a dust ball rose from an
arroyo, betraying travel. It would be, Benteen guessed, Antone's
larger band closing in, The two Apaches had probably caught up
with Antone and were leading him back, Nachee said, "Nantan,"
bringing both Benteen and Hazel over to the side of the peak
which lay against the low pass. Another party slowly crossed the
pass now, taking the same trail the band of warriors had followed
in the morning, The line was long and strung out and lifted high
clouds of dust. Nachee spoke to Al Hazel, who interpreted.</p>

<p>"Squaws and kids, he says. The women are movin' camp. He says
they'll pitch new camp in those heights."</p>

<p>"How's he know?"</p>

<p>"They're movin' late in the day. And there's water up there.
Nachee knows that country."</p>

<p>"Swinging back in the direction of Grant again."</p>

<p>Al Hazel said: "Movin' away from the white man they
butchered."</p>

<p>Benteen returned to the north side, now seeing dust boil out
of the nearer arroyos. An Indian showed himself on the skyline,
horse and all, and poised this way long enough to display his
interest and his lack of fear. Hazel said: "Look down
slope&mdash;the way we came last night."</p>

<p>Heads showed along the low eastern rocks, within five hundred
yards of Benteen's position. There were four or five of them, all
steadily moving in and out of the rough breaks. Nachee came back
from his position facing both Benteen and Hazel and raised his
arm and swept it around him; it was a slow and graphic gesture
that covered everything. Al Hazel grunted: "You bet we're
surrounded." He had shown almost no concern to this point,
governed by the self-confident taciturnity of all frontiersmen;
nor did he display any particular alarm now, but he went over to
his horse and pulled out his carbine, filled his pocket full of
shells from the saddlebag and returned to Benteen.</p>

<p>The country was alive with Antone's men. Posted behind the
rocks as the bitter-burning day dragged on, Benteen saw the shift
of black heads in the rocks and the gradual nearing of those
heads. North, in the adjoining rough country, dust continued to
banner up from point to point, hanging to the air long after it
had risen; and from these telltale streaks, Benteen could see the
route of the main party as it came up from the west and wound
through the arroyos.</p>

<p>On the south side was the natural protection of the swift-
falling wall of the pass. East and west the broken tops marched
directly to this summit and up the east side the smaller group of
Apaches now patiently crawled. To the north, where the mounted
Indians maneuvered, a casual depression made a cleared spot of
perhaps two hundred feet between the summit and the next rim of
broken ground. That yonder elevation was as high as this summit,
and Antone's riders were masked by it until they arrived at the
cleared spot. Thence onward, they would be in the open if they
chose to rush in with their horses.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nachee stooped in the dust, patted his palm against
the ground and began to sing a tuneless chant that came out of
his throat as an "Ahhhhh&mdash;eeeeeeah&mdash;Ahhhh," This was
beyond six o'clock. With the sun almost touching the eastern rim
of hills. Al Hazel fed shells into his carbine and hung it over
his arm, like a hunter. Benteen lifted his revolver, looked at
the loads, and laid it on the rock in front of him. And it was
then that the long-spaced line of Antone's larger party broke
from shelter, riding to the top of the nearby rim.</p>

<p>They were mostly stripped down to breechclouts, leggings and a
few daubs of paint, though some wore shirts whose tails dangled
against their thighs. Part of them had lances and bows; part of
them carried guns as good as anything the American cavalry used.
Their legs curved against the bare flanks of the horses, their
toes dangled down, and at this distance, which was not more than
seventy yards, Benteen saw the shoulder straps of an American
captain pinned to one brave's shirt sleeves&mdash;the relic of
some old battle. Coolness ran along Benteen's muscles; he felt
the quick slugging of his heart and the dryness of his throat.
Poised against the skyline, they made a startling, barbaric show;
they were the hardest, craftiest, most merciless fighters in the
world. This, he thought, in the moment before he closed his mind
against that kind of thinking, was what lay in the back of every
trooper's mind on the frontier&mdash;this final picture, And here
it was.</p>

<p>Al Hazel drawled: "See that little feller in the middle with
the face like an old dried potato. The one with the shoulder
straps on his shirt. That's your friend Antone, Lieutenant.
That's the Injun you been chasin' all summer. There he is."</p>

<p>Antone moved his horse forward from the straggling skirmish
line and turned a circle in a kind of insolent invitation; in a
kind of feinting suggestion. But Benteen all the while
remembering the Indians creeping up through the rocks on the
east, saw the shape of something cross the edge of his vision,
and hauled around in time to discover an Apache make a long jump
from rock to rock, not thirty feet removed. Benteen threw up his
gun, took a snapshot and caught the Apache in the middle of his
leap. Antone yelled across the clear space and the horses began
to bunch up, on the edge of a run. Al Hazel's carbine roared
against Benteen's ear. The warrior adjoining Antone sagged and
caught at his pony's mane, and dropped. Hazel's second bullet
killed a horse. Antone wheeled back and carried his party over
the edge and out of sight.</p>

<p>The party of Apaches who had spent all this hot afternoon
creeping up the eastern slope suddenly raised from the rocks and
rushed on, ducking from cover to cover low-bent and evasive and
howling. Benteen steadied his arm, carefully firing. Al Hazel
jumped beside him, the carbine laying hard echoes into the last
bright glare of the day. A bullet struck a rock surface and
screamed all through the hills as it ricocheted on. One Apache
raced forward sinuously, straight away from his sheltering
hollow, straight against the parapet. Benteen's sights fell dead
on his chest but as his finger squeezed out the shot the Indian
dropped from view. He was against the same rock that Benteen
touched, only its thickness and its height beween them: Al
Hazel's carbine knocked one more Apache to the boulders; the rest
had faded.</p>

<p>Benteen suddenly heaved himself belly flat across the rock,
his head hung down the opposite side, his eyes stared straight
into the Apache's eyes, no more than a foot from him. The Indian
reached up, seized Benteen by the back of the neck and attempted
to haul him forward. Benteen, on the edge of falling, got his gun
around, thrust it straight against the Apache's face&mdash;and
saw the face half vanish from the shot. Hazel grabbed his feet;
he fell back against Hazel, blood dripping from the rock-scraped
side of his jaw.</p>

<p>The sun was suddenly gone and purple shadows began to flow
along the ridge slopes, through the pass into all the pockets and
barricades and arroyos of this broken country. Antone's main
party had faded behind the hilltop on the north, but dust still
moved there and now and then a warrior came to the summit and cut
little dog-trotting maneuvers before the watching three, as
though tempting them to come out. Al Hazel watched these antics
carefully.</p>

<p>"A little show fer our benefit. Hopin' to keep us cheerful
whilst the rest of that bunch circle this point and come up the
sides. Which they will now be doing. This spot ain't exactly good
fer an invalid, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>Benteen crossed the small depression of the summit and pushed
himself through a break in the rocks, looking down upon the pass.
This rock wall fell in stiff grades for a matter of three or four
hundred feet before leveling into the floor of the pass. The pass
itself was hardly a hundred yards wide; and its far wall rose
into the hills at a less difficult angle. The original problem,
Benteen thought, was to take a horse down this first wall.</p>

<p>He traced a zigzag course with his eyes, trying to memorize
the lay of the slope before the swift-falling shadows blotted it
out. The moon had already begun to throw off its pale glow and
would, at full dark, partly light the way&mdash;an advantage in
keeping to the trail, but a disadvantage insofar as getting clear
of Antone was concerned. There were, as yet, no Indians down in
the pass; or seemed to be none. That way was open, if they could
get to it quickly enough.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," murmured Al Hazel in his unhurried way, "we had
better watch sharp. Hard to tell an Injun from a rock in another
ten minutes."</p>

<p>"As soon as it is dark enough," said Benteen, "We'll risk the
slope." He took Al Hazel's place by the barricade while the guide
went over to have his look, Presently Hazel called to Nachee, who
remained all this time by the east edge of the rocks, as patient
as fate; he trotted to Hazel and the two of them talked a moment,
Hazel pointing into the pass. Hazel called: "Better be pretty
soon, Lieutenant. When we pull out of here they'll be right on
us."</p>

<p>Benteen stared at the rocks beyond this little area. There was
no sound in the deepening twilight and no visible motion. All the
shadows began to blend until he found it impossible to
distinguish between boulder and moving shape. He called over his
shoulder: "We may get separated when we leave here. Tell Nachee
to pull out by himself and go find Major Warren. Have him tell
Warren to wait for our arrival at the butte. We'll keep a lookout
on Antone. We will also keep a lookout on the butte&mdash;and
close in as soon as we see the troops."</p>

<p>He crossed to the west angle, hearing Al Hazel translate the
instructions in a voice that quickened and grew blunt and was at
last touched by something very close to excitement. The
situation, Benteen thought, was bad when it could swing the guide
out of his consistent calm. The shape of the rocks directly
beyond this small clearing at last blurred entirely and he found
himself straining forward, the revolver pushed ahead and half-
lifted; he found his legs hardened and all his muscles drawn
tight. These shadows were tricky. They moved, they pulsed, they
had an odd bulk that drifted toward him; and out of them suddenly
emerged the sibilance of sound. Al Hazel yelled: "Watch!" His
carbine cracked the creeping quiet. The shadows before Benteen
ceased to be shadows and became rising shapes half-vague before
him. On these he placed his shots, seeing one shadow and another
drop&mdash;until they had all dropped. Indians hated to face this
kind of fire, they hated running against anything solid: So they
had dropped and were elusively crawling forward, deep-buried in
the rocks. Al Hazel's gun blasted the night again.</p>

<p>Benteen turned from the rock parapet. He said: "Al, come on,"
and stepped beside his horse. He waited a moment until Hazel and
Nachee had reached him, until they were ready to rise to the
saddle and run. Blackness dropped, with the reddish stain of
moonlight diluting it. Al Hazel murmured: "Better make this fast,
Lieutenant. They'll be crawlin' between us and the pass."</p>

<p>Benteen said, "Nachee goes first," and listened to Al Hazel
repeat it to the Indian. Then he said, "I'll be the tail end.
Let's go."</p>

<p>He was in the saddle. He laid a shot back of him, as a
diversion that would keep Antone's men low in the rocks for a
moment. Nachee faded through the narrow break on the pass side
and Al Hazel faded through it, both dropping at once from
Benteen's view. When he followed and got beyond the rocks he saw
the two ahead of him, whirling zigzag with the descending slope,
making a great racket on the stony ground. Behind him was the
rising yell of Antone's men and an interval in which he waited,
as he pushed the horse recklessly downward, for the first crack
of a shot. That interval grew longer and harder, it grew more and
more painful. He heard his horse grunt at each descending plunge;
he saw Nachee and Al Hazel's shape wheel right and left, run and
stop and turn, and run again. Low in the saddle, he felt the
first shot breathe by him. After that Antone's men searched for
him with their guns. Slugs hit the rocks. A fragment of
splintered stone stung his face and he rode in the smell of heavy
dust.</p>

<p>He was half down the slope when his horse, misjudging the
grade, stumbled and threw him forward from the saddle; he landed
flat on the gelding's neck and balanced this way, seizing the
animal's mane to keep from falling, and in such a manner he
fought for his seat all across the last hundred feet of the
decline and came at last to the bottom; the sudden pitch of the
horse on level ground threw him completely off. He lighted on his
knees, holding to a stirrup with his hand. Al Hazel galloped back
from the darkness, calling: "All right&mdash;Tom!"</p>

<p>The horse stopped the moment weight went from its back.
Bullets slashed the ground and as Benteen rose, still clinging to
the stirrup, he had one backward and upward glance, seeing the
firefly dance of muzzle light from the rocks above him. He jumped
into the saddle and raced southward across the pass with Al Hazel
beside him. The firing had quit.</p>

<p>"Where's Nachee?"</p>

<p>"Faded. He's all right&mdash;he'll meet Warren in the
mornin'."</p>

<p>Behind them now was the rattle and clatter of Antone's horses
on the hillside; Antone was following down the slope. At the far
side of the pass Benteen turned again and made out the weave of
shadows behind him, but Al Hazel was laughing in the dark,
pleased with his luck. "I reckon that's close enough to brag
about, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>He took the lead, finding some kind of an open way up the side
of the ridge, talking to his horse as he pushed it: "Git on,
Star! By God, you better pull for yore breakfast. Them's Injuns
you smell."</p>

<p>They were half up the stiff slope, with Antone's men somewhere
at the bottom of the pass, all scattered in the dark. Turned,
Benteen made out those tangled shapes and was tempted to chance a
shot but did not. At the top of the ridge, Al Hazel swung to the
left, raced forward at a dangerous tilt, and shot into an arroyo.
They followed to its blind end, clawed out of it and swung right.
In this fashion, see-sawing from one direction to another, they
rode for a mile or more before pulling down. They heard nothing
behind.</p>

<p>"Shook 'em for a little while," decided Al Hazel. "Ridin' like
this at night we got all the best of it, though they will track
us by the smell of dust. So we walk slow."</p>

<p>Benteen's horse showed the effect of the run. It limped
increasingly as they went along; traveling head down, all steam
gone, unsteadied by its need for wind, its heart mauling the big
chest and sending hard reverberations up its frame. They drifted
up the side of a ridge, through an open pine stand whose needle-
carpeted flooring left no dust smell, bearing westward and gently
higher with the contour of the hills until, two hours or more
from the time of their brush with Antone, Al Hazel halted and got
down.</p>

<p>This was some kind of a clearing in a gulch. Al Hazel said:
"Castle and Butler's old mine," and walked forward, leading his
horse, Benteen followed, seeing the square shape of a log house
lift from the shadows. Hazel hauled back a door whose rusty
hinges squalled in the silence, and stopped on the threshold,
listening and smelling. He threw some rocks inside. "Guess there
ain't no snakes or skunks," he decided and led his horse into the
place. Benteen, loosening the cinches of his saddle, also put his
horse through the door. Al Hazel came back, closing the door, and
led Benteen across the remains of an old dump, past the
dismembered skeleton of a mill and on to the faintly cool breath
of a mine's mouth. Here again Al Hazel gingerly poked around the
ground with his feet and threw a stone or two into the
tunnel.</p>

<p>"Never sleep with a snake unless there's worse things to
choose from," he said, and went into the tunnel, dropping at
once. "By God, Lieutenant, I'm tired enough to be an old man."
Benteen heard him suck greedily on his canteen, grunting his
relief at each gulp.</p>

<p>The floor of the tunnel was solid rock, overlaid with a
scatter of loose stones. Benteen brushed them half-heartedly out
of the way before settling, took a pull on his canteen and felt
no relief from the stale water. He lay back, sore in every joint,
and so tired that when he thought of saying something to Al Hazel
about taking turn at guard the words were too heavy for his
throat. They were in a hard spot, but weariness outweighed
everything else, even the need of safety; and so he fell at once
asleep, indifferent to anything.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

<p class="first">BENTEEN woke in the first grayness of morning to
find Al Hazel coming back from a scout. Hazel had a can of water
and a few pine branches; he started a small blaze in the tunnel
and boiled up some coffee. By the firelight Benteen saw the
guide's taciturn face marked by fatigue. Al Hazel said, in a
cranky voice: "A little risky, but by God, I got to have my
coffee."</p>

<p>They drank the coffee, hot and strong and black, from the can,
and broiled bacon over the firepoints and killed the fire. This
was the first approach to a meal Benteen had had since the noon
of two days ago, and the effect of it was like a jolt of whisky.
The floor of this mine was printed on every muscle of his body
and his joints dryly ached, but he felt cheerful again and faced
the pearl-gray daylight at the tunnel mouth cheerfully.</p>

<p>Al Hazel said: "There's a spring up the hill. I watered the
horses and put 'em back in the shed. Your horse is considerable
lame, Lieutenant. Both front legs, which is from comin' down that
slope hell bent fer election last night. Whut you want to do
now?"</p>

<p>"Climb the nearest ridge and have a look."</p>

<p>"Antone's camp won't be more'n three-four miles east. But we
got to keep smart. These hills are alive with those damned
Apaches&mdash;and the closest ones will be the Tontos."</p>

<p>Benteen said: "How's that?"</p>

<p>"They saw me in the rocks yesterday, Lieutenant, and fer a
Tonto that was like advertisin' Fourth of July. That tribe's been
wantin' my hair fer close to fifteen years. They'd crawl belly-
flat across forty miles of cactus to ketch me. I sure have had
some narrer squeaks."</p>

<p>Benteen said: "Think this is another narrow one, Al?"</p>

<p>The guide nursed the coffee tin between his hands and took a
long pull. Coffee dripped along his mustache. He swiped it away
with the back of his hand and looked across to Benteen; his eyes
were blackly bedded in pouched skin. "Kind of narrer, Lieutenant.
Was a time when a situation like this would have made me smile.
Never was loath to match my legs or my eyesight or my wits with
an Injun&mdash;not as long as I was young. But when a fellow
passed forty, the game gets considerable hard. It is hell on a
man like me to wake up feelin' like he's been drug at the end of
a horse. That's when a fellow knows he ain't young any more.
Well, I guess we better get this over with."</p>

<p>"Major Warren ought to be pretty near the butte by now,"
considered Benteen. "As soon as we have a look at the country,
we'll go that way."</p>

<p>He went to the mouth of the cave, followed by Al Hazel's
cautioning voice: "Wait a minute, Tom." The black shadows were
breaking away from the hillslope, from the pine thickets, from
the rough pockets. The pearl-luminous twilight of morning drifted
in. All this was a kind of motion along the earth. A dump ran out
from the tunnel fifty feet or more and broke off on the
descending slope; there was the one cabin standing in the
clearing and the faint trace on the ground where other buildings
had been. Across the gulch the hill ran up into pines; behind him
a similar hill rose to a broken summit. In all directions beyond
the gulch trees made a scattered screen.</p>

<p>Al Hazel was beside him, studying the trees with a troubled
attention. Afterwards he shrugged his shoulders. "Never can
tell," he grumbled. "They're not fur away now."</p>

<p>They turned about, climbing the slope, A magpie rose before
them, a long-tailed streak in the growing light. Al Hazel
grunted, his feet slipping on the ground. Halfway up the slope
Benteen heard the guide's breath deepen and he knew then that the
last forty hours had drained Hazel's strength considerably. At
the top of the slope a flat crest extended fifty or sixty yards
eastward and dropped away again, From that margin Benteen saw the
land roll north and east and south, potted by arroyos and pine
clusters and slashed by crisscross ridges. Sunless morning
swelled out of the east, so clear and transparent that it
telescoped distance. He saw the deep course of the pass and the
rocky barrier across the pass, which was the country they had
come from the night before, and this verified his sense of
direction. The butte at which he was to meet Warren lay about
four miles behind him. The light kept growing brighter in the
east; and on a peak close by a wisp of smoke raveled up to the
sky.</p>

<p>Al Hazel nodded at it. "There's your Injun camp, Tom."</p>

<p>"All right," decided Benteen, "that's what I wanted to see.
Now we'll go find Major Warren." He was pleased with the way all
this had turned out, and said so. "The trip's been a little bit
tough, Al, but we've got Antone spotted."</p>

<p>"Maybe," murmured Al Hazel. "An Injun is a shadow, Tom. The
women and kids are yonder, and part of the warriors. But all of
'em ain't. The rest are closer to us, I'd bet my shirt on it.
Antone is a sly devil, and them Tontos are lookin' for me right
now."</p>

<p>He was dissatisfied, he kept sweeping the foreground with his
glance; he stood by the trunk of a tree, hat pushed back from his
round forehead. In the mat of his beard his eyes blackly sparkled
and his lips were thinned from the pressure of his thoughts. His
vest draped slackly around his solid chest and the chain of his
watch swung gently as he turned. His shoulders dropped at the
points and Benteen caught weariness in them again, and in the way
his legs were planted apart. Hazel said: "Damned pretty country,
Lieutenant. I've had a lot of fun in it. You fellers will maybe
civilize it and then it will fill up." He shook his head at the
thought, not liking it. "I'd ruther have it like it is, for a
fact. Onght to be one place left in the world where a man can do
jest as he damn pleases."</p>

<p>"A long time yet," said Benteen.</p>

<p>Al Hazel pointed to the smoke signal. "Someday those things
won't show against the sky. Then it will be a different country.
I don't take much to your kind of civilization, Tom. Put a man in
a town, in a house, give him a steady job and let him worry about
his paycheck&mdash;and he ain't a natural man any more. The Lord
never meant us to live that way."</p>

<p>They recrossed the flat and walked down the slope. First
sunlight rushed through the sky, stepping up the brightness of
the old clearing below. The dirt of the dump made a yellowish
scar against the surrounding soil and the foundation marks of the
mine buildings still cut a pattern against the encroaching grass
and cactus growth: Dust rose around Benteen's boot tops as he
slid with the grade; a few loose stones bounced downward. At the
dump Al Hazel held back while Benteen pulled the horses from the
small cabin. He led them to Hazel, noting how still-placed Hazel
was; the guide's eyes, narrower and brighter, searched the tree
thickets. He took his horse, swinging up with Benteen. Double
lines cut quickly across his forehead and he moved his shoulders
in a gesture of discontent. "Let's get out of here."</p>

<p>They crossed the dump and fell into the bottom of the gulch,
riding up its shallowing trough. This was northward, generally
back toward the pass. The land rose beneath them, reaching into
the hill slope, They quartered the slope, the pines lying in
front. Benteen's horse kept favoring its right front foot; it
moved at a stiff, jaded pace.</p>

<p>"Take the left side of that hump," Al Hazel said,
"which&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benteen, turning to look at Al Hazel, caught the tag end of
motion in the trees above. He threw weight into his heels even
before he was sure of his sight. Al Hazel had also seen it.</p>

<p>"By God," he grunted, "git out of here, Tom! Up&mdash;go on
up!"</p>

<p>Benteen hit his horse with his heels hard enough to break the
gelding into a grunting, climbing run. He had his head turned and
now saw four Apaches come out of the timber at a dead gallop,
angling down the slope to intercept them. The stillness of the
morning echoed their sudden shouting, and echoed as well Al
Hazel's quick gunshot. Hazel yelled, "Keep goin', Tom!" and fired
again.</p>

<p>Benteen swung away from the slope, shooting off toward nearer
trees. The grade kept lifting him; he felt the strain of it on
the gelding. The beast's pace faltered until he used his spurs
again, so rushing up to the lip of the ravine and arriving at
level ground. In front of him lay the scattered pines and the
wrinkled contours of broken earth. Looking behind, he noticed
that Al Hazel had dropped back and at once he slowed his pace and
drew his revolver.</p>

<p>Hazel had tried another shot from the saddle. It knocked a
horse down, throwing one of the four Apaches. The other three
came on at a circling sweep, low bent on their ponies, and still
howling. Benteen fired and called, "Come on, Al&mdash;" and threw
his glance to the front and suddenly hauled the gelding half
around. For at this moment half a dozen warriors rose out of the
little pitted hollows of the pine forest and rushed straight at
him, all dismounted.</p>

<p>He yelled, "Al!"</p>

<p>Al Hazel's voice came robustly back to him. Thereafter he had
no time to look around. The Apaches before him were dropping on
the ground; they were taking aim while one tall warrior rushed
straight for the head of the gelding. Benteen wheeled again, took
a snap aim and knocked the Apache down. He was broadside to the
others, a plain target; and suddenly he knew this was fatal, and
wheeled to charge them. They were thirty feet away, brown-shaped
on the earth. He saw their rifles rise at him, and in rushing
forward, he watched the gun muzzles shift as they rolled aside to
get clear of the gelding's hoofs. The horse yawed away to keep
from steppng on the nearest. A gun, lifted straight up, roared in
his face, and then he was past the line, rushing away from it.
Swinging to cover his rear he saw them wheel around at him; but
behind them was a sight that made him rein in.</p>

<p>Al Hazel's horse was down. Al Hazel stood with his back to a
pine, holding his gun against the three mounted Apaches who came
at him in full halloo. Al Hazel fired and killed the nearest, and
then, raising both arms, he threw the gun at the other two. There
was a louder and louder yelling and a pair of the dismounted
Apaches swung around and ran for Hazel. Benteen wheeled his
horse, firing at the Apaches blocking his way. He yelled,
"Al&mdash;get behind the tree!"</p>

<p>It was then too late. A bullet caught Hazel and turned him
until he faced the tree. He caught at its bark, painfully trying
to swing back and he was like that, slowly pushing himself around
when one of the foot-racing Apaches reached him, swung the barrel
of his carbine crushingly against Hazel's head.</p>

<p>Benteen howled "Al!" firing pointblank at the warriors coming
toward him. Al Hazel was dead at the foot of the tree and the
sound of gunfire rocketed into the morning and dust began to
shimmer in the piny shadows&mdash;and the head of another column
of Antone's men reared up from the mining camp ravine and charged
forward. There was nothing left Benteen but to run and so he
slashed on through the pines with the bark of guns behind him and
the faint whispering of lead at his ears. There was another
pocket in front of him. He raced into it, escaping their fire,
and climbed out of its far side, galloping deeper and deeper into
the timber.</p>

<p>He was beyond the effective reach of their shooting, with
sweat pouring across his face. The big horse was slogging along,
fighting for wind, and slowly losing speed; one backward glance
showed him a flickering pattern of Apaches cutting through the
trees, spreading as they followed.</p>

<p>This flight had carried him northward and now, through the
trees, he caught an occasional sight of the pass and its open
ground. The butte was out there at no great distance with a
pretty effective rimrock shelter if the horse could carry him to
it; otherwise he had only the protection of the trees and the
possibility of jumping into some shallow pit and making his
fight.</p>

<p>This was what he debated in a hundred yards of dead run, and
came to his conclusion and at once swung toward the pass. Another
hundred yards brought him to its rim, the pine trees behind him.
The slope pitched steeply into the pass and after he took it he
looked up the clear sweep of the pass and saw the butte jutting
against its end like the battlement of a castle. He saw something
more as well&mdash;and this was a sight he never forgot
afterwards to the end of his life.</p>

<p>Out around the pass, riding in double file, came Major
Warren's command. Dust boiled around the horses; the figures of
the troopers was a solidness against the dun earth and metal
flashed against the sunlight and the troop guidons fluttered to
the small breeze created by the forward riding of the column.</p>

<p>This was a mile or less away. He saw them and raised an
arm&mdash;and was seen at once as he came rocketing down the
slope. The column stirred and the dust rose in whirling clouds
and the guidons whipped straight to the immediate run of the
command. Benteen rushed off the last of the grade and halted to
look above him; one Indian stood high on the lip of the wall,
staring at the advancing troopers; a moment later he faded from
view.</p>

<p>Warren's big body rolled backwardin the saddle, bringing the
detail to a halt before Benteen. Benteen saw the roughred surface
of the Major's face break expressively. Warren's voice bawled
out:</p>

<p>"Where, Mr. Benteen?"</p>

<p>Benteen slipped off his horse. Warren said: "That beast is
about dead. Hannevy, give Mr. Benteen your horse and drop back
with the pack mules."</p>

<p>Hannevy spurred forward and dropped out of the saddle, running
back with Benteen's horse. The column sat dark and eager under
the bright-hot sunlight. Benteen mounted Hannevy's horse as he
spoke:</p>

<p>"There's part of Antone's band on the rim, behind me. They
will be falling back to the main camp. That's three or four miles
down this pass&mdash;up on the rough ground to the right."</p>

<p>"How many in front of us?"</p>

<p>"Twenty or so. More coming up, though."</p>

<p>Warren called: "Harrison, take a platoon up this slope. Push
right on! We will parallel you and cut in."</p>

<p>Harrison bawled a few words. A platoon of I troop swung from
the line, trailing Captain Harrison up the stiff pitches of the
slope. Warren swung his arm overhead and the rest of the column
fell into a steady gallop down the open floor of the pass.
Benteen said: "They will retreat along the edge of this pass.
There's an old mine about a mile on, and a clearing they might
cross in their retreat."</p>

<p>Warren said: "Anything over on the north of the pass now. Mr.
Benteen?"</p>

<p>"Antone had his camp there last night. This morning he shifted
to the south."</p>

<p>Warren said: "Mr. Lankerwell should be coming up soon. Where
is Antone's main camp from here?"</p>

<p>Benteen pointed to a round black butte-top in the southeast;
this lay perhaps four miles distant by crow-flight. Warren,
heavily rolling to the long forward pitch of his horse, studied
the butte-top at a Considerable interval. Afterwards he called
back, "Mr. Castleton," and waited for Castleton to ride up. He
said then:</p>

<p>"You will take fifteen men from your troop, with Sergeant
Hanna, and continue down this pass when we swing out of it. Keep
on until you are approximately abreast that butte, then move into
the hills, approaching it. You are to block any retreat from that
direction until we come up. Do you understand&mdash;you are not
to make an attack. Should you see Mr. Lankerwell coming out of
the north, dispatch a messenger to bring him up."</p>

<p>Castleton dropped back to the column. There was, over the
rattle and run of the column, the muffled scatter of firing on
top of the ridge. A trooper came to view on its rim and plunged
down the slope at a long angling descent. He rushed at Major
Warren: "Captain Harrison's respects, sir, and the Indians are
givin' ground in front of him, but not fast. They are collecting
in the timber. About thirty. More are drifting in from the
southwest."</p>

<p>Benteen said: "Then the rest of the warriors from the camp
have come along. There will be fifty of them. Maybe more."</p>

<p>Sweat rolled freely along the Major's empurpling face; sweat
began to stain his shirt. He rolled around in the saddle,
shouting back: "Mr. Castleton&mdash;never mind!" His blue eyes
were brilliant bright. "By God, it looks like a fight. If he does
not give ground rapidly he is waiting for his chance to attack."
The headlong run of the column had carried it well down the pass.
Major Warren's eyes considered the slope they paralleled and he
pointed his arm at an irregular break in its rim. "A convenient
spot. We have pretty well gotten behind them. We turn up!"</p>

<p>The column swung over the pass floor, straight at the grade.
Major Warren grunted as his horse hit the slope and started
upward; they were at a climbing walk, zig-zagging with the
contours. Benteen forced his horse forward, making an advance
point, and so arrived at the rim first. In front of him the land
showed its potted surface and its scatter of pine trees; through
a long, erratic defile he saw the scar of the mine dump. A show
of dust hung around that spot, raised by recent passage of
horses. Now and then, from the west, where Harrison was, an
occasional shot signaled a running action between troops and the
Apaches. Warren heaved up the slope and the column came on and
halted at his arm signal; he was breathing out of the very bottom
of his lungs; the points of his white mustache drooped down,
sodden with sweat. But he cocked an ear to the west, listening to
the shots and making up his mind.</p>

<p>"They're giving way before Harrison. Coming this way. That
dust over there in the clearing?"</p>

<p>"Antone's warriors coming up from the east to join this fight.
They have been thick around here since daylight."</p>

<p>Warren led the column forward again, following the defile as
it slanted irregularly toward the mining dump. "I want to get on
that hill above the mine."</p>

<p>They came out of the defile, swinging away from the mine gulch
and striking the ridge in a more heavily timbered part, climbing
by hard stages. "I wish to God," said Major Warren bitterly, "I
wasn't such a hearty eater. It is hell to carry the weight of two
men on one pair of buttocks. Where's Hazel?"</p>

<p>"Dead," said Benteen.</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed Warren.</p>

<p>The column scrambled over the last rocky folds of the
hillside, horses sliding and scrambling through the loose layers
of crumbling stone. Sweat smell grew rank. Mixler, at the rear of
the column, was calling at his men to close up. Hanna's thick
Irish voice cursed Trumpeter Patch. "Ye damned little
whelp&mdash;move on&mdash;move on!"</p>

<p>They reached the piny flat on the ridge top and trotted along
it until they came at last to a spot directly above the mine
dump. Here Warren halted the column to study the canyon bottom
and the ridge beyond. Firing thickened over there and grew
considerably nearer. Major Warren let the moments run on while he
weighed it all in his mind, He said presently:</p>

<p>"Mr. Castleton, take six men and go left along this ridge top.
It seems to curve around into those trees. Scout the trees. If
you see anything in that direction, send word&mdash;but do not
bring on a fight and do not charge into any timber. Hanna, go
along."</p>

<p>Castleton whirled away with his detail. Mixler came up and
reached out to shake Benteen's hand. "Looks like you had an
active time." These two officers stood by while Warren quietly
talked out his mind.</p>

<p>"That firing is not pronounced, so I think Harrison is in no
trouble yet. We could ride into it, but that would scatter the
Apaches, If they are withdrawing in front of Harrison it is
likely they will come into this clearing. In such case we shall
fight on foot. But if they avoid the clearing and try to slide
around us then we must stick to the horses. It is like seining
fish&mdash;you've got to find which way the fish propose to swim
or else you scoop up nothing but water. We shall wait a moment or
two longer."</p>

<p>Carbines scattered long echoes through the timber across the
ravine. The sun threw its hard yellow glare against this waiting
column, burning wherever it struck. The troopers held double-
ranked formation, loose in their seats, but black-jawed and
showing the flash of excitement in the rounds of their eyes.
Benteen studied these men carefully, noting how calmly the old-
timers, like McSween and Conrad Reicherts, held themselves.
Trumpeter Patch had never been in a fight before; he kept rolling
his eyes around him, watching his companions, as if seeking some
sort of comfort from them, as if trying to discover some of his
own uncertainty in them. Benteen understood what was in the boy's
mind. He could remember back to his own first engagements,
catching again the rush of blood, the quick squirming fear and
the still greater fear of showing fear. This was what Trumpeter
Patch would be going through now, and Harry Jackson who sat with
his head down, staring at the knuckles of his hands. This was the
silence of the column, but behind that silence were the crowding
hopes and fears and the back-reaching memories. Mixler pulled his
horse over to be beside Benteen. Benteen grinned at him and
Mixler nodded gently, and turned his glance to the pines on the
far ridge.</p>

<p>Suddenly the yonder firing strengthened and dust began to
show. Benteen murmured: "They're coming out of the trees."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

<p class="first">MAJOR WARREN spoke conversationally, "We will
fight on foot," and gestured with his arm. The column stirred
into front line without further command; men sprang off, ducking
under the heads of their horses, three men handing their reins to
the fourth, who was the horse-holder. The horse-holders, Corporal
Oldbuck in charge, trotted out of the line of skirmishers.</p>

<p>Warren said: "You will take the right, Mr. Benteen. Mr.
Mixler, the left."</p>

<p>The troopers scattered thinly along the brow of the rim,
crouching among the rocks; resting behind the base of the pines.
McSween walked along the line, grumbling: "Ye've got nawthin' to
hurry about, either. And mind the orders. I will beat the ears
off the man who fires before he's told."</p>

<p>Benteen walked to the right side of the line, taking position
behind a tree. From this position he looked across the ravine to
the opposite rim and saw Antone's band break out of the timber
and trot into the clearing; they came in a straggling, reluctant
wave, and as he watched them break into sight he realized that
the full force of Antone's warriors was represented here. There
were more Indians here than troopers.</p>

<p>Warren said, still even-voiced: "Take aim on the horses."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Phil Castleton, sweeping down the spine of the
ridge, reached a point where that ridge curved westward and
joined the other ridge girting the mining camp gulch. Trees
thickened here and the junction of the ridges made a chopped-up
area that cut off any very definite view ahead. All he clearly
saw was the margin of the gulch on his right hand. There was a
freshening fire somewhere ahead of him, which was Harrison
pushing in against the Apaches. Hanna rode beside him and the
other six troopers came behind. Van Rhyn was here and Canreen,
and Lefferts and Hollander, and the two inseparable partners of I
troop, Gordon and Maris.</p>

<p>They turned with the rough ground, keeping out of the hollows
as much as possible. His first tangible sight of the fight was a
smoky curling of dust through the trees, marking the quick
passage of horsemen and this, he judged, was a fresh party of
Antone's men coming out of the south to join the main band. He
knew then that it was a serious fight, for it was not customary
for Apaches to bunch up and throw themselves against cavalry
unless they were extremely certain of their ground. He was
remembering now the talk of old-timers around the post. They had
said that Antone would fade like a shadow until his own prestige
forced him to a fight or until support came out of these hills to
join him. This was the way it stood.</p>

<p>He debated sending back a messenger to tell Warren of the new
Indians drifting in; and dismissed the impulse, not wanting to
cut the strength of his detail down. He had his hard moment then
in realizing he was out of the main fight. Warren had put him
here to act only as a flank guard. Knowing it, knowing that he
stood aside as the engagement swept around him and left him high
and dry, he had his bitter wish for twenty men behind his back.
With that many he had no doubt of his ability to drive into the
timber and roll the Apaches back against Harrison, or throw them
pell-mell into the ravine for Warren to handle.</p>

<p>Dust thickened as he went along and the firing was quite
close, so close that a stray shot clipped a pine's high branch
directly ahead of him. Then, staring along the ragged up-and-down
earth, he saw Apaches drifting in the timber. At once he threw
his arms outward as a deploying signal. It brought his men into
line abreast him and here he stopped for a moment, standing in
his stirrups with his body thrown forward and all his wild
eagerness coming up.</p>

<p>Hanna murmured: "Driftin' this way."</p>

<p>The Apaches eddied toward Castleton; they were loosely
scattered through the trees and they were in no hurry. Now and
then some of them wheeled back and disappeared, as though testing
the strength of Harrison's men, as though guilefully drawing
Harrison's men deeper in the trees. The dust boiled up more and
more and the shot echoes beat out harder. There was, he thought,
increased activity farther to the north, near the pass; the main
fighting seemed to be over there. These Indians in front of him
formed the elusive flank of Antone's band. He saw only seven or
eight of them in the dust.</p>

<p>He looked down at his closed fists, he drew his deep-reaching
breath, and settled in the saddle. He glanced to either side, his
cheeks tight and his long chin hardened. Hanna's black old-
soldier's eyes were taciturn, but he knew what Hanna was
thinking; even as he spoke: "Come on!"</p>

<p>He rushed ahead, lifting his revolver. Hanna spurred near,
carbine coming up, and all the others rose and fell with the
shifting terrain. They drove out of the potholes, straight into
the trees and into the whirling dust, straight into this shadowy
confusion. Apaches shifted before him and he began firing at the
slipping shapes and he began calling: "Come on&mdash;come on!"
Around him suddenly was the blast of the troopers' guns.</p>

<p>The trees surrounded him on all sides. He saw an Apache
capsize from the saddle, and saw another rush across his path,
low and fast, firing as he raced. They dissolved before him. As
he pushed through the pines, it was as if he reached out his hand
for a sure grip and closed his fingers on nothing but air. But
they were around him. He felt the whip of their lead, close and
strong; and at once, snarled in the timber, he found himself
caught in a swift attack. They were closing around him thicker
than he had ever thought they could be. In these shadows they
were lesser shadows, their fire cross-ripping him.</p>

<p>He plunged on, firing at these shadows, and calling: "Come
on&mdash;keep together&mdash;come on!" A pine branch cut him
across the face; carrying away his hat and blinding him
momentarily. He heard Hanna's horse grunt and go down; he heard
Canreen cry: "Ah&mdash;!" He was ahead of his men, too far ahead,
and in the cloudy dust there was nothing he could lay a shot on.
Wheeling around he saw Hanna standing over his dead horse, tall
and spraddle-legged, firing and cursing and firing again. Canreen
was crawling forward on his hands, his head lobbing down.
Lefferts sprang out of his saddle and plunged against a tree for
shelter. Hanna bawled: "Get down&mdash;get down&mdash;'tis
another trap!" Gordon lumbered forward on foot, scrambling over a
deadfall and dropping behind it. Maris followed. Van Rhyn charged
his horse straight at this shelter and then reeled back, vainly
grabbing for the swell of his saddle; he was down, at once lost
to sight.</p>

<p>Castleton remained on his horse. He continued to turn the
horse, he slashed his shots at the blur of Apaches ringing him.
They were like the insubstantial visions of a dream, unreachable,
yet thickening constantly. Antone's men were all rushing up to
this spot for the kill. Hanna looked up at him, his black, wise
eyes full of things that he couldn't mention. All he said was:
"Ye had better get off that hawrss&mdash;we'll be here awhile."
Firing swelled and crashed into this spot; there was a steady
fall of pine needles on Castleton's head.</p>

<p>From the east ridge Benteen watched the Apaches come down the
far slope into the mine ravine, still unaware of the soldiers
before them. Benteen murmured: "Aim at the horses, and wait for
the command to fire." Harrison's men were putting a steady
pressure on Antone's band, forcing them out of the timber. But
there was a growing rattle of carbines off to the southwest. The
center of the fight swung that way, quickly and in surprising
volume. Benteen turned to Warren, seeing the major's face veer in
the same direction. An Apache spurred out of the timber and
shouted something to the Apaches now in the gulch, whereupon part
of the band swung back up the side of the gulch. Suddenly Warren
bawled out: "That's Castleton in a fight! God-dammit! Benteen,
take your men around there!"</p>

<p>Benteen rushed for his horse, followed by the whole right half
of the line. The horse-holders rushed up. Warren yelled at his
own section: "All right&mdash;fire!" They let go on the mounted
warriors in the ravine. From his saddle, galloping along the
spine of the ridge, Benteen watched the Apache horses fall, he
watched Indians race back for shelter, he saw them lie low on
their ponies and break in all directions.</p>

<p>He came down to the junction of the ridges with his men hard
on his heels, struck the potholes and heard the full force of the
fight in front of him. Smoke and dust rolled up from the trees;
the Apaches were howling full-throated in there. He could see
them weave through the timber and he thought he saw one trooper
still in the saddle.</p>

<p>"On foot!"</p>

<p>He was on the ground, with McSween trotting beside him.
Troopers fanned out, lumbering in and out of the potholes,
dismounted. They hit the trees, they went on through, taking
shelter and firing and slipping forward again. Smoke smell and
dust smell were rank underneath the pine boughs and the Apache
horses made a confused flitter through all this. Benteen saw
Castleton wheel his horse and rush deeper into the pines,
headlong and crazed and thoughtless. He yelled at Castleton. The
troopers drove away at the Apaches. Horses smashed into the pine
trunks. One little warrior, flat on the bare back of his pony,
skimmed in front of Benteen, trying for a shot. Benteen knocked
him down. Gordon and Maris raised their heads over a deadfall,
saw Benteen come up, and rose to join the line. Gordon yelled
out: "Now you red sons of suches!"</p>

<p>Benteen jumped over the deadfall and stumbled against the
small shape of van Rhyn dead on the ground. Canreen sat with his
back to a tree; he held a hand across his belly and stared at
Benteen, shaking his head. Sergeant Hanna lay curled up on the
pine needles with one big fist still gripping his revolver. He
had his eyes open but he was dead.</p>

<p>Harrison's men were coming near, pinching in the Apaches from
the other side. Benteen heard Harrison's crusty voice calling;
and he saw the Apache horses wheeling back toward the mine
ravine. This was a quick turn in the fight, and immediately he
called to his men, bringing them around toward the ravine. "Come
up&mdash;follow me!"</p>

<p>McSween stuck with him, the thin skirmish line doubled around.
McSween grumbled: "Keep back with me, Lieutenant! Don't get so
damned far in front!" Apaches flashed in front of them, rushing
for the clearing. But gunfire boiled up from the clearing, which
was Major Warren's piece of K troop checking Antone's retreat;
and Harrison kept pressing in from the northwest. Pinched this
way, Apaches rolled back up the gulch and through the trees,
coming hard by Benteen. Benteen balanced his revolver on the
driving shape of a wire-thin Tonto who came on afoot from the
gulch. He dropped the Tonto and turned to signal his men forward.
They were in the middle of it, the very heart of this whirling
fight. McSween ran back, seeing Conrad Reichert lose his horse.
He bawled: "Watch out, you damned Dutchman!" Harry Jackson ran
through the pitted hummocks, the rest of the detail on his heels.
Standing against the pines, or kneeling in the soft turf, they
met Antone's recoiling warriors and beat them back into the
ravine. Harrison appeared from the timber, his cheeks chalked by
sweat and dust and his lips pulled apart as he sucked in the dry,
hot air. A piece of K slashed through the pines behind him,
reached the mine gulch and fell into it, yelling.</p>

<p>Benteen yelled: "Horses!"</p>

<p>The horse-holders rushed in, the detail hit the saddles.
Benteen followed Harrison to the edge of the gulch and stopped a
moment to look down. Indian ponies lay slaughtered below and
Apaches, both afoot and mounted, shrank back from the firing.
Warren came down the steep opposite slope with his men, and
Harrison drove the last scattered remnant of Antone's band off
the ridge, into the bottom of the gulch. A few warriors, dodging
this enclosing maneuver, raced to the head of the ravine, bent on
reaching the potholes where Castleton had been trapped. Benteen
pointed at them and carbines battered the dead-burning air,
dropping some of the ponies. The rest of the fugitive Apaches
rushed on, vanishing.</p>

<p>The firing dropped off. Antone's band was shattered, his men
were dead in the hills and in the ravine, or they had fled across
the ravine, or they stood now at the bottom of the ravine, sullen
and no longer fighting. Benteen saw the troopers collecting below
him, and led his men down. Warren stood on the end of the mine
dump, considering the scene, completely soaked in his own juice.
A few last shots echoed at the end of the ravine. Troopers
straggled back and horse-holders came off the hill. Castleton
rode down from the timber, hatless and with a streak of blood
across his face. Three troopers were carrying George Mixler
across the rocks. Mixler turned a little in their arms and raised
his hand across his eyes. Benteen went over to meet him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter; George?"</p>

<p>Mixler was gray-white, and feeling pain. He shook his head. "I
don't know. Hit somewhere."</p>

<p>Shiraz came up the gulch. The troopers put Mixler on the
ground, arranging themselves to block the sun away. Shiraz
unbuttoned Mixler's shirt, and bent over, his fingers pushing
across Mixler's chest. Suddenly Benteen turned aside. Manuel Dura
called from the opposite slope, "Hey&mdash;thees is Antone," and
he pointed at the ground.</p>

<p>Troopers trotted toward Dura and Benteen walked over, looking
down at the small, wizened face of the Apache who had, for so
long a time, laid his terror across the Territory. He was past
middle age, stringy and shrunken, with an a stringent,
unforgiving expression on his face, even now. He wore a striped
shirt, with the captain's bars pinned to a sleeve and around his
neck was a cord holding a brass medal with a picture of
Washington on it, a peace-treaty medal handed down to him by some
older warrior. Benteen reached out and ripped the captain's bars
from the shirt.</p>

<p>Details were climbing the slope to bring back the dead
troopers. Somebody said: "Hey Jackson, Canreen wants to see you."
Benteen started back to Warren, but turned aside, for Castleton
stood in front of Warren, and the major's red face full of anger.
The three troopers carried George Mixler into the dobe, Shiraz
following. Benteen took a drink from his canteen and suddenly
crouched on the ground, turned dizzy by heat and hunger and the
drain of the last four days. Manuel Dura walked up to him, and
McSween came up. McSween said: "Give me your hand, You'll get out
of this sun."</p>

<p>"Manuel," said Benteen, "Al Hazel is up there. Over on the
right, just after you get to the top of the slope." Dura went
away at once, murmuring under his breath.</p>

<p>McSween pulled Benteen to his feet and slipped an arm under
Benteen's elbow. "Hell, Lieutenant, it would be a bad thing now
to see you on the ground. Any other man, but nawt you." Harrison
walked over from the Apache prisoners. He stared hard at Benteen.
He took Benteen's other arm. "I don't wonder, Tom."</p>

<p>Warren called both of them and they walked on to the mine
dump. There were these four on the dump&mdash;Warren, Castleton,
Harrison and Benteen. Castleton's cheeks were rigid. He kept his
eyes on Warren, almost sightless in the way he stared. Warren
said: "We will camp here. It is unnecessary to go on. Antone's
dead, which is the end of this particular expedition, and the end
of trouble around our district. Mr. Lankerwell should be here
before long&mdash;I have dispatched a messenger to reach him.
When he comes I shall send him on to Antone's camp. We will take
the women and children to Grant." He paused, shifting weight on
his feet, irritably pressing sweat away from his eyes. Then he
said: "Mr. Castleton is under arrest, and will exercise no
command during the balance of this trip. That is all."</p>

<p>Benteen walked down the slope toward the cabin, the back
muscles of his legs barely bracing him. He went into the cabin
and crouched beside Mixler. Shiraz had finished working on Mixler
and shook his head at Benteen. "Not a pleasant prospect. It will
be a bad trip back, for him. Better stay in here, Tom. You look
pretty well washed out. I'll get you a drink of whisky a little
later."</p>

<p>Mixler said in a husky voice: "One for both of us." He groaned
a little and moved his head from side to side. But he managed a
small smile when he looked at Benteen, "You turned out to be a
pretty good soldier, old boy. I shouldn't like to have been in
your shoes."</p>

<p>Benteen murmured: "Part of the game, George. For both of
us."</p>

<p>"Sure," groaned Mixler. "For both of us. I guess I'll get mine
on the ride home. Still, it is a comfort, in a way, to know what
you'll do under fire. I'd never been in a scrap before. There's
always a little doubt. I used to envy you because you already
knew what you could do. Now I know what I'll do. Pretty good
feeling."</p>

<p>Harry Jackson crawled over a deadfall, up in the timber, and
found Gordon and Maris kneeling by Canreen. Canreen was on his
way out; it was in the slackness of his big lips, it was a
nearing shadow in his eyes. But when Harry Jackson came up he
moved his arm a little and had his say: "Take my watch kid and
give it to Rose. And listen. I been through the mill and I look
at a woman different than you. You're pretty young and you got
some strict ideas. But that girl Rose is all right. I wouldn't
hold nothin' against her for the way she's made her livin'. Never
hold that against any woman, kid. When you get a little older
you'll see what I mean. You been sore at me, but you're all
right, too."</p>

<p>Maris said: "We got to pack you back to camp."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Canreen. "But just wait a minute, then I won't
feel it. That Camp Grant graveyard is a hell of a dry spot for a
man that's been as thirsty as me." He closed his eyes, his big
lips softly turning.</p>

<p>Harry Jackson said: "About Rose. You think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Harry," said Maris, "he don't hear you
anymore."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was no reason for rising at reveille, yet
when the call came Harriet Mixler at once dressed and watched the
sun break across the high rock ramparts behind Camp Apache.
Strolling in the morning's bright winy coolness, she saw the
details of post life with understanding eyes, and was a little
surprised that she should. It flowed around her in aimless
regularity&mdash;troop drill and fatigue detail, commanding
officer's orderly stiffly wheeling down the walk, horses milling
in the breaking pen, the water cart's to-and-fro traveling, the
sick call line in front of Doctor Panzer's door, the Indians
crouched in the quartermaster building shadows.</p>

<p>It was a pattern marking off the hours of her life. Reveille,
roll call, stables, mess, drill, and recall; the long browse of
afternoon, the sharp summons of the music again, and the stiff
line of troopers massed against the low sunlight as the bugles
blew retreat and the flag came down; and at night, in the
smothered stillness, the sentry call running from post to post
while tattoo broke across the dark and rode in continuing waves
out and out into the hills, at last dying, And taps&mdash;the end
of the pattern for one more day.</p>

<p>She had never thought this life could leave any impression on
her. Once away from it, she felt she would soon forget it, as she
might forget an unpleasant dream. And yet this listening for
things that were familiar, this faint expectancy which came when
the buglers walked to their station at the guardhouse and
breathed tentatively into their instruments just before sending
their calls across the camp, this conformity to routine, this
faint stir of something deep inside when the troops, stiffly
marching platoon front, passed in review before Major
McClure&mdash;this told her something about herself.</p>

<p>Camp Grant was far away in the lowlands, sweltering in the
desert heat. Sitting quietly in the background of a cheerful
group in Major McClure's house, she thought about that heat with
a shrinking sensation. The heat and everything that had gone with
the heat. It was, she told herself, the tragic period of her
life, Nothing before had ever been like it; nothing ever would be
like it again. From this detached place, she looked back rather
clearly, to realize one poignant truth. Her girlhood had died at
Grant; there were things she could never believe again, there
were things she could never feel again.</p>

<p>It was rather late in the evening, Major McClure told his bear
story and Mrs. McClure brought out coffee and a very elaborate
pudding. Four other officers of the post had gathered here with
their wives, carrying on a robust and cheerful conversation. This
was the way army people relaxed. They had health and they had
hunger and they had the wonderful ability to throw off the day,
when the day was done, and to grow loose and lazy. She sat
somewhat apart from the group, watching them; watching young
Lieutenant Kessler in particular. He had a pretty and somewhat
provocative wife, and now and then his eyes would lift to her and
something passed between them, warm and urgent and
possessive.</p>

<p>McClure said: "How's that baby?"</p>

<p>Harriet smiled. "Sleeping and quite contented."</p>

<p>"Apache's the place," said McClure. "That damned Grant is a
hellhole. I feel sorry for any woman living there. We ought to
get Eleanor to come up for a stay."</p>

<p>"Eleanor," said Mrs. McClure, "wouldn't leave K troop. At any
rate she has other and equally interesting reasons for liking
Grant."</p>

<p>"So? Who?"</p>

<p>"Men are so blind. Young Castleton."</p>

<p>McClure looked at her. "Ah," he murmured, "Castleton, eh?"</p>

<p>It was the brief way he spoke the name, the way he quickly
left the subject, that told Harriet of his attitude. Suddenly, in
her heart, she was afraid for Eleanor. A man's judgment of a man
was an illuminating thing; and none of the officers around
Castleton liked him. Meanwhile McClure, helping himself again to
the pudding, shot an affable glance at Harriet. "Be very nice now
if old George were here. Round out the evening for you."</p>

<p>Mrs. McClure threw her husband a wife's astonished and fretful
glance; the small silence was quite heavy. McClure suddenly
realized his lapse. He raised a hand and coughed behind it.
"Dammit, Madge," he grumbled, "you didn't make enough sauce to
cover this pudding."</p>

<p>Harriet sat small and quiet in the chair, listening to their
talk cover up the mistake. All of them knew, of course. The
regiment was a close-bound family, with nothing long remaining a
secret; and suddenly she felt outside the family, apart from it
and no longer sharing its closeness. They had been kind to her,
but there was a difference. In the kindness itself was the
difference, as though their minds held reservation and
judgment.</p>

<p>McClure said, "Messenger came up from Grant this afternoon.
Benteen went on an extended scout, picked up Antone's location.
Warren has taken his whole command out. I expect they may have a
brush with Antone. Be fortunate if Warren can break up that
Apache. Relieve the pressure of this campaign considerably. I am
sending a detail down to Grant in the morning to get the
paymaster."</p>

<p>Harriet rose, saying, "I think I'll go see sonny," and turned
from the room. Taps was just then sounding across the parade. It
swung her around and turned her breathing deeper and made her
stand straight, with her small hands tightly closed. She listened
to the call with a solemn attention, hearing something so
timeless and faithful in the long-drawn notes. There was a
sadness in the call that turned her a little humble, there was a
strength in it that took possession of her and bound her to this
parade gronnd and to the lights shining from the barracks, to the
tramp of the sentries' feet on the hard earth, to the smell of
dust, to the feel of the faint wind rolling off the hills. She
had straightened and her eyes watched the stars so bright and
high in the south-west sky, where Camp Grant lay.</p>

<p><br> <br> Major Warren brought his command into Camp Grant at
noon. From the commanding officer's ramada Eleanor watched the
column file through the gate. She stood very still, gripped by
the fear that always came when troops returned. The men were dead
beat, sweaty and beard-blackened, blistered and parched by the
sun, and round-shouldered from the fatigue in their bones. The
dead were blanket-wrapped across the saddles, and on these shapes
her glance clung. George Mixler lay cradled in an improvised
carrier between two mules, Her father sat on his horse
uncomfortably, looking tough and old and cooked by the sun. Her
eyes rummaged the column, man after man. Hanna wasn't riding as
guide of K, and then she knew the name of one of the blanketed
shapes, and closed her eyes, blinking away quick tears. When she
opened them again she saw Castleton. A long breath escaped her,
but her attention remained on the gate as they filed in and her
fear was as real and as suffocating as before until she saw
Benteen, Then all the fear went out of her and she put her head
down, afraid at the moment to look at his high, loose shape. Al
Hazel's wife stood by the quartermaster's building, crying out a
question in Spanish. The captive Indians, men and women and
children, crowded to a corner of the parade. I and K troops swung
front into line, waited for dismissal, and filed on toward the
stables, Eleanor went immediately to George Mixler. Shiraz and
two troopers were lifting him from the carrier and when she saw
Mixler's face she knew he had been badly hurt. They carried him
to Shiraz' quarters.</p>

<p>Captain Harrison walked on, smiling a little through his
cracked lips, "We got Antone, Eleanor," and continued toward his
dobe with a definite limp. Castleton threw the reins of his horse
to an Orderly, cut across the parade and disappeared in his dobe
at once. He had not looked at her. Eleanor thought, "Something
has happened," and watched Benteen come up.</p>

<p>She noticed at once the ragged mark on his cheek, which was
the result of his fight with the Apache on the rocks above the
pass. His face was thinner, he was sweated dry, he was ridden
down to muscle and bone. It had an effect on her; an actual
physical effect. She touched his arm, looking at his eyes. He was
smiling, and she knew, from the way his face changed, that he was
pleased with the pressure of her fingers. It was a feeling that
at once lay in both of them. But his face had some of the old
reserve on it; it held away something.</p>

<p>She said, softly: "I said my prayers for you, Tom."</p>

<p>"Sometime," he said, carefully picking his words, "I want to
talk to you, Eleanor."</p>

<p>She looked down and was disturbed. "Is it something you ought
to talk about, Tom?"</p>

<p>"We'll be living in the same camp for a long time."</p>

<p>"Will that be bad, for you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think&mdash;" he began. But he shook his head. "I
need a little sleep first."</p>

<p>Al Hazel's wife sat in the dust, against the wall of the
quartermaster's building. She was crying, rocking her shoulders
slowly from side to side. Eleanor breathed: "Where's Al?"</p>

<p>"He's dead," said Benteen. "We had quite a scrap with Antone,
Eleanor." He went on, turning into Shiraz' quarters to see
Mixler.</p>

<p>The crying of Al Hazel's wife was a steady moaning in the hot,
windless air. Eleanor went over and crouched in the thick dust.
Al Hazel's wife stared at her out of dully red eyes. She put her
head on Eleanor's shoulder, crying and speaking in Spanish.
Eleanor held the woman, saying nothing. A detail of soldiers
circled the Indians in the yard, her father crossed the parade to
his quarters and Benteen left the Shiraz dobe, entering his own.
He ducked at the doorway and put his hand against the wall, as
though bracing himself. Castleton's quarters were directly
opposite her; he sat on the edge of his cot, his shoulders
crouched forward, his arms across his knees. He was smoking a
cigarette and his head was dropped forward. Presently Al Hazel's
wife rose. She said "Ah," and moved her arms apart, and walked
back along the line of the quartermaster's building. Eleanor went
at once to Castleton's dobe and for the first time in her life
stepped unbidden into an officer's room.</p>

<p>"Phil."</p>

<p>He didn't look at her. His long jaw was hard-set; his voice
came at her roughly, "Go away, Eleanor. Not now&mdash;not
now."</p>

<p>"Phil&mdash;what happened?"</p>

<p>The question pulled him back and he turned and showed her the
rank anger of his eyes. It hurt her to see so much heartless,
unthinking feeling there. He stared at her as though he had no
trust. "Didn't your father tell you?"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen him, Phil."</p>

<p>"Then," he said; "how do you know anything's wrong? Maybe Mr.
Benteen gave you the details."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "do you think he would?"</p>

<p>"Ah," breathed Castleton, "Mr. Benteen is an officer and a
gentleman and wouldn't stoop to common gossip&mdash;is that the
way you feel about him?"</p>

<p>She hated that domineering sarcasm and yet realized how deeply
stung he was, how completely his fury changed him. So she spoke
quite gently. "Do you have to hurt me, Phil?"</p>

<p>He said in a stony, flat voice: "I am under arrest for going
beyond the letter-of-the-law of your father's orders." He drew a
breath and she knew he meant to add something to that phrase. She
waited, dreading what that addition might be. She wanted him to
be honest. Above all other things she wanted him to show neither
self-pity nor evasion. These qualities she despised. They were,
to her, cardinal sins in an officer. Suddenly, not quite sure of
what he meant to say, she broke in:</p>

<p>"We can live down any honest mistake, Phil. We can go on, we
can keep trying&mdash;we can whip any kind of bad
fortune&mdash;if we face everything straight."</p>

<p>"We?" he said in that high, intolerant voice.</p>

<p>She gave him a long look. "Am I not part of your life,
Phil?"</p>

<p>She hoped it would break his temper, She stood there,
desperately waiting for him to rise and come to her and include
her in his misfortune, to show her some relieving gentleness and
understanding. And yet he did not. He said in a dry monotone:</p>

<p>"There seems to be no place in this command for an officer who
exercises any judgment of his own. Apparently we are to be little
sticks jerked by strings."</p>

<p>She had, when deeply affronted, her own quick temper; and now
he had outraged her sense of fairness, her hope, and her long-
placed faith.</p>

<p>"Stop being a fool, Phil! Stop excusing yourself and pitying
yourself. You should know better&mdash;your training should have
taught you better. There is no sense in trying to dramatize
yourself as a young hero on a horse, leading desperate charges.
I'm ashamed of you!"</p>

<p>He said, red from throat to forehead, and shaken visibly by
his resentment: "Are you? Are you indeed? Perhaps, Eleanor, it
would be better if you tried not to guide my life for me. I do
not wish to hide behind a petticoat."</p>

<p>She opened her mouth, and shut it tight on her feelings; and
she studied him a long, long interval, at last saying: "I think
it would be better to wait until we are both less quarrelsome."
Going out, she returned to her own quarters. Her father sat half
collapsed in the easy chair.</p>

<p>"Daughter," he groaned, "see if you can get these damned boots
off."</p>

<p>She knelt down, and had her head lowered when she spoke. "Why
is Phil under arrest, Dad?"</p>

<p>He said: "Don't interfere, daughter."</p>

<p>"I know," she answered him, quite humble. "But that's the man
I'm marrying. Shouldn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"I gave Mr. Castleton orders to conduct a scout and keep out
of a fight. His gallant notions led him straight into
trouble."</p>

<p>She pulled off one of his boots and, still kneeling, asked
softly: "Was Hanna with him, Dad?"</p>

<p>"Hanna and van Rhyn and Canreen. Now don't ask me anything
more."</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Nothing more." She stood up. Major Warren
watching her now with a shrewd eye, saw no expression on her face
and heard none in her voice: "I'll make up some lemonade for you,
Dad."</p>

<p>She went to the kitchen and was there when she heard him say,
in pleased reflection: "It was something of a sight to see
Benteen come off the ridge to meet us. The Apaches had him
cornered. They were on the top of the ridge. It was as close to
hallelujah as that young man will get for some time. I am
mentioning him in my report to Crook."</p>

<p>Coming back from the stables, young Harry Jackson found Rose
Smith at the corner of the barracks, turned his way as though
waiting for him. He came up to her, embarrassed and oppressed by
the message he had to give. Reaching into his pocket he pulled
out Canreen's gold watch and held it to her.</p>

<p>"He told me to give this to you."</p>

<p>"He's dead, isn't he?"</p>

<p>Young Harry Jackson nodded, still holding the watch. She
didn't take it. She watched him, the shine of the sun in her
quiet-black eyes, and he felt something rise in him then he had
thought entirely dead. It took the heaviness out of him, it made
her as she had been before&mdash;a desirable woman. It surprised
him a little to hear his own voice.</p>

<p>"Rose I'm not such a hell of a greenhorn. Like I said before,
my enlistment runs out next year and I propose to settle in
Prescott. It would be a good place to start. For the both of
us."</p>

<p>Her lips, softly pliable, changed and pressed together. A
shadow rushed across her face, or seemed to. "There's something
you'd have to forget, Harry."</p>

<p>He said, very gravely: "I'd forget."</p>

<p>Her eyes had a glowing deepness, and sudden sweetness made her
face younger and prettier. Her lips moved, kind and red and
strong. He had not noticed before how dark her hair was against
her temples, or how smooth her skin was; all this came to him
now, quite quickly, and left him excited and pleased with this
moment and the things that were ahead of him. But she was shaking
her head.</p>

<p>"You keep the watch, Harry. Canreen was a good man, in his
way. You keep the watch, to think of him and maybe once in a
while to think of me. You wouldn't forget, Harry. It would come
back. It would always come back."</p>

<p>She stepped nearer and brushed her lips across his cheek and
went quickly toward the sentry line, toward the ranch on the
flat. Harry Jackson didn't turn to see her go. He stood fast with
the watch unnoticed in his hand&mdash;and wanted to cry.</p>

<p>Midafternoon's heat pressed in on the post, one thin layer on
another, and the soil of the parade ground glittered against the
sullen light and the powder-dust mushroomed up as a man's foot
touched it. A detail took the dead troopers out to the little
cemetery behind the post and K and I troop stood in single rank
around the fresh graves, listening to Warren recite the services:
"Man that is born of woman&mdash;" This was all, this and the
crash of the carbines and the buglers blowing Last Post, and the
march back. Lily Marr walked with Eleanor, as far as the
guardhouse, and stopped here while Eleanor went on. Lily faced
the grated door and Jack Bean who stared out from the rank jail
cell.</p>

<p>He looked at her, neither in hate nor in liking, but she knew
something now. Each day of this past week, coming before him, she
had watched his eyes; and now she saw what she wanted! This man
had always been wilder than the wind; enduring no restraint. He
had never known quietness, he had never felt anything as strong
as his own will. She watched him, calm and certain, showing him
no feeling.</p>

<p>"I guess you saw Lieutenant Benteen come back," she said.
"You'd like to see him dead. But he's alive. He'll still be alive
when you're hung. Sergeant Hanna was killed. He was a better man
than you are, Jack. Why wasn't it you in his place? What have you
done that's worth keeping you here when somebody better has to
go?"</p>

<p>He put his fingers around the bars. "Lily, I reckon I know
what hell is. It is a place where a woman kills a man by keepin'
him alive. An Apache couldn't do what you're doin' to me. Go on
away."</p>

<p>"The marshal will be here this week."</p>

<p>Jack Bean shrugged his shoulders, not answering, and Lily Marr
knew he didn't care. She came nearer the bars, speaking with a
low, smooth softness. "When it gets dark tonight I am coming by
this door, and reach the key and throw it in. The guard will kill
you if he catches you coming out. There won't be any horse to
cross the desert on and there won't be any water. Maybe you'll
get to Tucson."</p>

<p>He grated his answer back to her, "I wouldn't take nothin'
from you, not even to keep from dyin'."</p>

<p>But she was almost smiling. "Yes you will. You'll do anything
to live. And maybe you'll get to Tucson. But you won't forget you
owe your life to me, and you won't forget you laid in jail a week
with the Territory laughing at a tough man who wasn't tough. You
are not the same man that went into this place, Jack."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Not from you, Lily. I don't want nothin'
from you."</p>

<p>She was still near to smiling when she turned away and crossed
to the dobe where George Mixler lay; at the doorway she turned,
observing the last low sunlight with a smooth, half-pleased
expression on her face.</p>

<p><br> <br> Supper and retreat and the bugles strongly sounding
while the flag went down; and again the sudden twilight fading
into dark. Eleanor stood under the headquarters ramada watching
Tom Benteen cross from officers' mess to the stables. She kept
her eyes on him until he turned the corner of the barrack;
Afterwards she put her arm against a post of the ramada, waiting.
Horsemen came over the San Pedro gravel, to be immediately
challenged by the sentry; "Halt&mdash;who's there?"</p>

<p>"Officer and party from Fort Apache."</p>

<p>"Halt, officer and detail. Cawprul of the guard, post number
one!"</p>

<p>Doctor Shiraz came from his dobe, paused long enough to gather
a breath of air, and turned back. He had been inside all
afternoon with George Mixler. Her father left headquarters
office, paused at Shiraz' door and walked forward. He called into
the dark, "Orderly," and stopped by Eleanor, his round cheeks
gloomy. "I do not think George will live." The orderly walked
away, boots scuffling the boards. The detail from Apache swung
into the parade, six horses and an ambulance wagon. Turning
about, Eleanor saw Harriet Mixler come swiftly down from the
seat. Warren went around on his heel, into the house.</p>

<p>Harriet came near Eleanor, her white drawn face vague in the
moonlight. "I left the baby at Apache. Is George here? Do you
think he will see me? Do you think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Eleanor breathed, "Harriet&mdash;Harriet&mdash;" She held
Harriet's arm. She was almost whispering. "You will find him with
Doctor Shiraz. You'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Harriet said, "Oh," and caught up her skirts, rushing down the
walk. She called "George!" Her voice, thin and high as a child's
voice, made a forlorn and diminishing echo on the night air.
Castleton, coming out of his dobe, suddenly stepped aside to
avoid her on-running shape. He wheeled and watched Harriet run
into Shiraz' house. Afterwards he paced forward, stepping heavily
on the boards. He had his head lifted and his face, illumined by
the moonlight, was distinctly sullen. Eleanor said, "Phil&mdash;"
He saw her, made a quick avoiding wheel, and entered Warren's
house.</p>

<p>Eleanor put her hands across her breasts again, tightly
locking them. She walked swiftly away from the row, out into the
parade and beyond earshot; and kept on traveling with her head
down, past men's quarters, past the bakery, past the shining of
the sutler's store lights. At the guardhouse she noticed Lily
Marr suddenly turn into the shadows, sinking away from sight, but
her thoughts were so confused and troubled that she paid this no
attention. In this manner, still walking, she came against the
still figure of Sergeant McSween.</p>

<p>This was at the corner of the rectangle, near Doctor Shiraz'
dobe. McSween had his shoulder tipped against the dobe's wall and
seemed to be listening. He straightened up&mdash;"My apologies,
Miss Eleanor"&mdash;and gave her room on the walk.</p>

<p>"It's all right, McSween."</p>

<p>"Ah," he murmured, "there's many a thing that can't be right.
'Twould be too much to expect from a damned funny life. I miss
Hanna. I do miss that Irishman a hell of a lot. Now 'tis the
Lieutenant Mixler. Which is sad when there are others not near
worth the keepin' that do not seem to die."</p>

<p>They heard Harriet Mixler cry out a word. McSween said, "Now I
should not be standin' here at all," and strode away. Eleanor
walked on.</p>

<p>Harriet came into the room, finding George on the bed. Shiraz
got out of his chair and stood back, turning completely around so
as not to observe this. Harriet knelt at the bed and George
Mixler's drowsy eyes opened up and were a cloudy, puzzled blue.
He said, through his mouth's thickness, "How did you know
this?"</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;I didn't. I left sonny at Apache. I came."</p>

<p>"Wanted to come back, Harriet?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, George. But how&mdash;what happened?"</p>

<p>He seemed not to hear her. He rolled his head from side to
side on the pillow, he ran his tongue across his lips, and
faintly framed the words on them. "It is good to know&mdash;that
you changed your mind. My young wife, my lovely wife. I should
like to have seen the boy again. Do not let him entirely forget
me." He breathed suddenly and painfully and she heard the fading,
breathless tone: "My love, all of it&mdash;as it's ever
been&mdash;to you."</p>

<p>She saw him loosen; she heard him sigh again. He was smiling
and sleepy and there was no motion in him. Harriet turned her
head to Shiraz. Her big round eyes, so dark and so frightened,
begged at him; and her face held the fear that the face of a
child holds when its deepest faith is broken. This was the way
she looked at him. Shiraz put his hand across his mouth so that
she might not see its changing; and shook his head.</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

<p class="first">AS soon as Castleton came from her father's
house, Eleanor crossed the parade to him, placing her hand on his
arm. Light gushed through the doorway, shining on both, and she
knew that he could see the concern and the loyalty on her face if
he looked, if he broke out of his tremendous self-absorption. His
old attitude governed him again&mdash;a distrust of others, a
domineering faith in himself, a rankling, bitter anger at the way
his luck ran. She had a pretty clear view of him at the moment
and saw so little that she could love.</p>

<p>This was a swift and sudden thought that shocked her: She saw
so little that she could love. All these minutes, pacing the
parade with her troubled thoughts, an odd discontent had been
stirring in her, a tremendous dissatisfaction. She had not been
able to name it, but it was as though something lay near her that
she could not reach, as though she struggled through a cloudy
confusion with the promise of some complete relief and happiness
quite close by and could not reach it. All she saw at this moment
was the stubbornly resenting cast of Phil's features. The
interview with her father had hit him badly.</p>

<p>"Phil," she said, "walk with me."</p>

<p>But he held his place, intractably wilful. "Eleanor," he said,
"there is no hope for me in this regiment."</p>

<p>She murmured: "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"It has been made pretty clear," he said in dry sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Are you thinking of a transfer?"</p>

<p>His chin, she noticed, was very heavy. It lengthened and
unbalanced his face. He had removed his hat and his black hair
sparkled in the light; and in an unruly, sulky way he was
handsome. She had made many an excuse for him, she thought; now
it was cruel to see her excuses fade. It was cruel the way her
mind worked, picking him apart.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "there is no place in the army for an ambitious
man. It is nothing but a dull mill. I am resigning."</p>

<p>"Phil!"</p>

<p>He looked at her, "We can have a little fun out of this,
Eleanor. If we go to Tucson we can be married there, catch the
stage to San Diego and the boat to San Francisco, going back East
by the Pacific Railroad."</p>

<p>She didn't answer. Light made a cool, sparkling glow in his
eyes. His own talk began to change him and make him a little
eager to be out of this country. He was looking forward,
impetuous and wilful again; he was near smiling. "It will be a
good deal like paradise, after Grant."</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, "no, Phil," and felt the heaviness of her
heart.</p>

<p>It brought him up. There was a gesture he always made when
irritated. He lifted his chin a little, watching her with a
hardening reserve. "I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I couldn't."</p>

<p>"I thought a woman followed a man," he said, sarcasm in his
voice once more, "if she loved him."</p>

<p>She drew a long breath. "If a woman loved a man, I suppose she
would."</p>

<p>"Then what has this been?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Whatever it was&mdash;and I did love you once, Phil&mdash;it
isn't love now."</p>

<p>He hated resistance and showed it in the tightening of his
lips. The expression on his face then was almost brutal. This
sudden insight shocked her and left her clear-headed, so that his
speech made no impression.</p>

<p>"Is the army a religion to you, Eleanor?"</p>

<p>She knew then. She knew what had been in her mind and in her
heart so long. It was like relief, like cool air after
insufferable heat; she had a feeling of freeness that had not
been hers for a long, long while; Standing in front of him she
could look at him and feel no regret. For this first time in the
years she had known him she had no hunger for his nearness, no
quick beart-lift at his presence. She spoke quite evenly.</p>

<p>"Only one person in the world will ever matter to you, Phil.
That person is Phil Castleton. You are leaving the army because
you cannot stand the truth. You're running away. And you will
always be running away. There never will come a time when you
learn to be tolerant, or to know what love is, or what fairness
is. Well, I wish you luck. I really do."</p>

<p>She waited for temper to pour out of him, or hurt feeling, or
pleading&mdash;or anything. But nothing came and she realized
that he was seeing himself at the moment, not her; he was wrapped
around by that wilful pride and self-centered egotism. He
murmured "Ah" in a dry, quick breath, wheeled on his boots,
almost rushing across the parade.</p>

<p>She watched him go. There were heavy shadows on the parade and
into these he faded physically and was gone. And afterwards, in a
manner that forever afterwards puzzled her, he was gone as well
from her heart and her conscience; leaving no trace, no emptiness
where he had been. This was the way it happened if loyalty was
pulled too tight and worn too thin. The time came when, as with
her now, it broke completely. These were her thoughts. She was
free of him, she was looking back, seeing him as she had loved
him and then, in this new lucid light, she was seeing him as he
had come to be. She was free of him&mdash;and realized how great
the strain and self-deception and anxious hope had been.</p>

<p>The sudden bawl of a sentry rose from the post bakery.
"Corp'ral of the Guard&mdash;prisoner's loose!"</p>

<p>Eleanor ran over. Boots scuffed up from the corner of the
quadrangle and Benteen trotted out of the stables, a lantern
swinging in his hand. Her father came on, cursing at the loose
stones under his bare feet. The door of the guardhouse stood wide
open and Benteen, throwing his lantern high up, said: "How'd he
get out?"</p>

<p>The sentry said: "It was closed when I walked past it last
time, sir. When I turned the beat and came back, it was open.
Just one minute between times."</p>

<p>Major Warren said: "Who carries the key?"</p>

<p>Benteen said: "It usually hangs on top of that projecting
timber, sir. Somebody threw it in to Bean."</p>

<p>"Now who would do a thing like that?" grumbled Warren. "Well,
he's gone now but he'll have one hell of a time getting to
Tucson, or anywhere. We won't attempt to overtake him. Not worth
it. Hereafter I want that key kept in the personal possession of
the sergeant of the guard. Very slipshod. Very."</p>

<p>He limped back to his house, grumbling audibly: "Guardhouse
key hanging outside! Like the key to a female seminary. Good
God."</p>

<p>The guard detail faded in the dark, leaving Eleanor and
Benteen together by the open door. Benteen swung toward her. He
was smiling a little. He had slept and shaved and the dead
exhaustion was gone from his eyes. He had, she thought in slow,
deep admiration, the kind of vitality that could shake off any
punishment. She stood before him, pleased by his smile and not
wanting him to go, and trying to let him see this.</p>

<p>"Lily&mdash;of course." he murmured.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"The way of a serpent, an eagle or a woman," he murmured.</p>

<p>So near him, alive to the shadows of his face, to the way his
mouth turned and the way his sandy-red hair lay against his
bronzed forehead, she discovered thorough understanding in his
gray eyes. He had this insight and this tolerance; he had the
gift of looking into others. It bound people to him, the
unruliest trooper in the command, the officers; the women of the
post&mdash;and it bound her to him. She realized it in one swift,
wondering flash and waited for him to speak.</p>

<p>"She broke him, Eleanor. She put him in this hot hole and took
the sap out of him, Then she turned him loose." He shook his
head, the slow smile continuing. "A little odd."</p>

<p>"Any woman in love," she murmured, "is odd; Tom. They see so
much&mdash;and so little."</p>

<p>"She deserves better. There is something in that
girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>Steps rustled in the darkness. Lily Marr said in her calm
voice, "Mr. Benteen&mdash;" She came into the glow of the lantern
and confronted Benteen with her small shoulders resolutely set.
Softness controlled her expression, making her pretty and gently
excited. Her lips were pleased. But it was the way she watched
Benteen that turned Eleanor around and took her away from these
two; it was something Lily Marr's eyes held, something sweet and
sad and beyond hope. The girl was in love with Benteen.</p>

<p>Benteen said: "What for, Lily?"</p>

<p>She brushed the question away. "I want to go to Tucson with
the next detail, Mr. Benteen. And I thank you for all you've done
for me."</p>

<p>He said: "You think he'll be there, Lily?"</p>

<p>"If he gets through the Catalinas he'll be there."</p>

<p>"Suppose he doesn't?"</p>

<p>She had a way of lifting her shoulders, a way of holding her
face composed. It expressed everything, it was the reaction of a
strong, hardy spirit that knew the meaning of trouble and could
look at any disaster without crying. "If he doesn't, Mr. Benteen,
then I guess I'll grieve&mdash;and go on living."</p>

<p>"What'll he say when you see him?"</p>

<p>She was quite serene: "He was a man who never thought twice of
what he did, and never once of other people. But he will now. And
he'll be glad enough to see me. It is something he can't
help."</p>

<p>He was troubled about her. He showed it: "You deserve better,
Lily."</p>

<p>She said, very quietly: "No, there's a place for all of us,
Mr. Benteen. And I guess my place is with Jack Bean. I think,"
she said, coolly planning ahead, "we will go to New Mexico. They
won't know much about him there. He won't be very wild. He's a
better man than you think." Then she paused, and added a slow-
voiced after-thought. "I guess I know him pretty well, the bad
and the good."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck."</p>

<p>"I guess you wish most people luck," she murmured. "I guess
you know people better than most do. I'll be gone, but I'll
remember you very well. Very well."</p>

<p>The light showed her strong shape against the night and the
round darkness of her eyes as she lifted them to him and held his
attention. Brief feeling moved across her long lips; It was a
shadow that stirred her features, and left them composed again.
There was this moment, then she turned and walked into the
darkness.</p>

<p>From the ramada of her father's house Eleanor saw the scene.
She noticed how Benteen turned about, facing her as if he meant
to come on. He remained this way quite a long while and at last
wheeled and, with the lantern swinging its quick arc across the
black, headed for the stable. Eleanor drew a deep, disappointed
breath&mdash;and continued to wait.</p>

<p>Turning the corner of the barrack's wall Benteen discovered a
shape posed in the dark and threw his lantern around until its
pale glitter identified Sergeant McSween. McSween's leathered old
soldier's cheeks showed him nothing but a settled melancholy; and
so Benteen went into the stable, killed his lantern and hooked it
to a peg. Another lantern swung above the doorway of the stable,
diluting the blackness with its fan-shaped beams, Horses stirred
on the hardpacked dirt, their teeth crunching against oat
rations, their halter ropes softly sliding on the feed boxes. The
smell of the stable was a rank compound of sweat and leather and
manure and hay; strong and pleasant to a cavalryman's nostrils. A
man's steps scuffed the area beyond the stable. Benteen,
expecting McSween's approach, turned toward the door and found
Phil Castleton paused there.</p>

<p>There was a hazel brightness in the man's eyes and a paling of
his skin from temple to neck; and Benteen knew what fury was
then, from seeing it. Shock went through him. It was an
instantaneous flash striking every nerve and leaving him cold in
the compressed heat of this summer's night. Alive in his head,
this swiftly, was an ancient, brutal eagerness. He knew what
Castleton meant to do. It was like a smell, like a sound. The
walls of his stomach closed in. He felt the steady, sloshing beat
of his heart along the base of his ears, along the side of his
jaw. It kept quickening; and for a reason he never knew, the odor
of the stable got ranker and ranker.</p>

<p>Castleton said in a rising, shallow tone: "Come at it,
Benteen&mdash;come at it," and without waiting, drove his big
body straight for Benteen. He grunted when he jumped, and grunted
again in throwing his right hand at Benteen's jaw.</p>

<p>Benteen's head dropped, Castleton's knuckles ripping along his
hair. Benteen pulled up his forearms, rolling Castleton's right
hand away as it beat in; but Castleton's weight carried him
backward and the next blow, ripping up through his elbow and his
guard, cracked him on the corner of his chin. Benteen's shoulders
slammed against the stable wall and his head hit the dobe, the
echo of it roaring in his ears; and for a moment he saw the
crystal sparkle of the lantern and Castleton's long-jawed face
and the whip of his arms only as a blur. He turned his shoulder
to take the edge from the beating, but these were blows that
stunned him, as punishing as the down-sweep of an ax-handle. He
kept rolling his shoulders; he pushed a leg against the stable
wall, and shoved himself low and fast against Castleton again,
taking the shock of Castleton's ready fists as he went in. He
smothered the man for a moment, wrestling him back toward the
stalls, he kept against him, coming around with his fist and
battering Castleton's temple. Castleton, quite near the stalls,
wheeled aside and away, and Benteen's long reaching arms smashed
him twice across the mouth.</p>

<p>Castleton danced back, his breath sawing the dull quiet of the
stables. They were under the lantern: They slowly circled, arms
up and doubled; throwing quick punches and blocking. Benteen kept
his head low, his mouth against the knuckles of his defensive
fist. Blood dropped against those knuckles from his nose; he
tasted it in his mouth and he had the smell of it. Castleton
feinted, went backward and afterwards rushed in. They were close
then, fists swinging hard and fast, meaty echoes ringing in the
stable. It was a hard and wicked little flurry, savagely
effective; and then they were circling again. Benteen panted
through his teeth: "Come on, plebe, come on and fight."</p>

<p>From his position at the corner of the barrack wall, Sergeant
McSween saw this and lived it and felt it. He stood away from the
wall, his muscles working and his breath groaning in and out. He
sighed "Ah," when the on-rushing Castleton hit Benteen on the
face. McSween heard the crack of it and saw Benteen's head
bounce; and then those two, head down, were circling and waiting,
and rushing in and slugging and stepping back. Somebody ran
across the parade, coming toward McSween. McSween put out his
arm&mdash;"Stop here"&mdash;and turned to see Eleanor Warren
beside him. He was shocked. He said, "Ah, for the love o' Gawd,
Miss Eleanor, don't watch it&mdash;don't! If the Lieutenant
Castleton licks him I'll kill him, I will! Go on back!"</p>

<p>Benteen's head sagged, heavy-weighted. The surface of his fist
was oily with blood and slid smoothly along Castleton's cheek
when it missed its mark. Castleton hit him twice; he felt the
jolt, but not the pain; the ability to feel sharp pain was gone.
There was a grayness before his eyes. Beyond this grayness
Castleton moved in and out, and Castleton's mouth was a longer
and thicker stain against his skin. Castleton stepped at him and
moved away, and stepped in again. Benteen rushed him, taking his
beating as before, but he knocked Castleton's arms aside and felt
Castleton's teeth break against his fist. He carried Castleton
back. There was a sharp bridle peg at the edge of the nearest
stall partition; he heaved Castleton into it, and saw something
half-wild twist across Castleton's face. Castleton's arms went
down and he was suddenly uncontrollably sick. Benteen hit him
across the bridge of the nose; and hit him again, fair and full
against that long bloody jaw. Castleton's mouth was wide open,
his eyes turned aimlessly from side to side. Benteen seized him
by the neck and flung him around, and smashed him hard enough to
drive him against the wall. There was a bale of hay lying here
and Castleton's legs tripped on it and he sat down, holding
himself motionless a moment; afterwards he bent over with his
arms almost touching the floor, breath bubbling and sobbing in
his lungs.</p>

<p>From her position outside the stable, Eleanor saw Benteen move
against a stall partition and hook his arms over it. He supported
himself this way, his legs wide apart and shaking. He dropped his
head against the partition, motionless for a long, long moment.
She sighed: "McSween&mdash;go help him!" But McSween whispered:
"We saw nawthin'. We saw nawthin' at all." She stood still,
watching Benteen swing from the partition. He pushed the flat of
a hand across his face, squeezing sweat and blood away from his
eyes. He shook his head. There was an empty burlap sack on the
floor; he lifted it, dirty as it was, and scrubbed his face with
it. His shirt hung wide on him, all its buttons ripped off.</p>

<p>"Phil," he breathed, "you through?"</p>

<p>Eleanor, straining her ears, heard no instant answer. Benteen
wiped his face with the sack again. He repeated his question.
"You through?"</p>

<p>She heard Castleton groan, "Oh, my God, what a mess!"</p>

<p>That was all. She slipped across the parade and stopped
beneath the ramada to look into the house. Her father sat in the
easy chair, smoking silently and furiously on his cigar, Turned
back, she saw Castleton go slowly over the parade. A little later
Benteen followed, entering Doctor Shiraz' quarters.</p>

<p>Her father said: "Eleanor, are you out there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "Yes." And was still beneath the ramada, a
long half-hour later when Benteen came down the walk. He stepped
into the beam of lamplight and she noticed that he had scrubbed
himself clean and treated the cuts on his face with some kind of
caustic; there was a long red burn on his cheek, and his lips
were a little smashed at the corners. He looked at her, the fight
still a smoky flare in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You gave me some bad advice, Eleanor," he said in a very slow
voice. "Maybe a man shouldn't carry the memory of a girl around
in his head&mdash;when the girl's beyond his having. But it is
better than something else."</p>

<p>"What else, Tom?"</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "you must know."</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, "I knew it at Tucson. It has been nice to
know."</p>

<p>"It will be impossible for me to live in the same regiment
with you. That is what I meant to tell you this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Phil," she said in one swift breath, "is leaving the army and
I am not marrying him."</p>

<p>He was tired, or he was confused, or he was deeply moved, by
the thought of it. For he put his head down and held it this way
so long that she almost put out her hand. When he lifted it again
she saw the oddest expression she had ever found on a man's
face&mdash;so close to smiling, so near to sadness. All he said
was, "Eleanor," and brought her toward him with his long
arms.</p>

<p>This, she thought as she lifted her lips, was like
Tucson&mdash;as deeply satisfying, as rich. Only it was
different, it was for her an answer that stilled her mind and
made her humble at the thought of the years ahead. One small,
dissenting thought did come to her, making her pull away:</p>

<p>"She had something of you, Tom. I won't ever have that part,
will I? Is there enough for me&mdash;will you ever regret?"</p>

<p>"No," he said; "No regrets. Maybe a memory, for me&mdash;as
you will have yours. There is nothing simple about living, and no
sure answer for any of us, I guess. But no regrets."</p>

<p>Over at the corner of the parade the trumpeters were spitting
faint sounds into their instruments, ready for taps. She put her
arm through his elbow, knowing what he meant. Harriet Mixler
crouched before her husband and watched him slowly go out beyond
her tears and her hopes. Fresh scars in the cemetery marked the
end of good and gallant men. This was the army, this was the
frontier, with Lily Marr waiting for the next detail to take her
to Tucson and Jack Bean and whatever life with him might mean. Al
Hazel's wife sat somewhere with her tragedy and the men of the
troop, half-asleep on their cots, would be softly speaking of
yesterday, and pleasantly dreaming of tomorrow. The dead were
dead and the living looked forward.</p>

<p>The smell of dust was keen in the hot air and the stars hung
brilliantly remote and taps, long and deep and sustained, ran the
night, promising the end of one day, promising sleep. Tomorrow,
the sun would rise and reveille blow, with dust again boiling out
of the corrals and Sergeant McSween's iron voice harking along
the parade. The thin blue line of troopers would cut a silhouette
along the flats of the San Pedro and Tom Benteen would come down
the walk toward her tall and cheerful, with the half smile behind
his eyes. This would be the way of it, until whatever end there
was in store for them. She tightened her grip on his arm,
dreaming and sad and gay.</p>

<p>"The best of it," said Benteen, "to them, wherever they may
be. And to us. It is a fine life, Eleanor. We shall have trouble
and we shall have fun&mdash;but no fear." The long falling melody
of taps faded into the deep silence of the desert; along the
quadrangle lights winked out.</p>

<p>"No regrets and never any fear," he said, and kissed her.</p>
