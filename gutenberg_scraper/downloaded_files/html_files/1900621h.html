<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THAT BRIGHT
DAY&mdash;THAT FAR LAND</h2>

<p class="first">THE town had a name but no shape, no street, no
core. It was simply five buildings, flung without thought upon
the dusty prairie at the eastern edge of Dakota, and these stood
gaunt and hard-angled against the last of day's streaming
sunlight. The railroad, which gave the town a single pulse beat
once a day, came as a black ribbon out of emptiness, touched this
Coraopolis with hurried indifference, and moved away into equal
emptiness. The five buildings were alone in a gray-yellow space
which ran outward in all directions, so empty that the tiring eye
never saw where earth ended and sky began. There were no trees in
this world, no accents, no relieving interruptions; nothing but
the gray soil rolling on and a short brown grass turned crisp and
now ready to fade when winter temperatures touched it.</p>

<p>The train&mdash;a wood-burning engine and three
coaches&mdash;had paused and had gone, leaving one woman and one
man on the cinders in front of the depot shed; the woman fair and
round-bodied and slightly smiling at the land as if it pleased
her. Beside her stood a collectreadreaion of trunks and valises.</p>

<p>Nobody walked abroad, nobody met the train. These two were
alone, facing the mute buildings whose western window panes
burned yellow in the sunlight. From this cinder platform ran a
sinuous pathway through the short grass to a frame building, two
stories high, three hundred feet away; in front of the building
were a wagon and a team and a pair of saddled ponies. Far out on
the prairie a gauzy spiral of dust signaled the passage of
riders, inbound or outbound. The man, somewhat farther down the
platform, took his view of the town, looked at the woman and her
luggage, and moved forward.</p>

<p>"That," he said, pointing toward the two-story building, "is
probably the hotel. I presume you are going there. I'll take your
light luggage."</p>

<p>She was not more than twenty-five, he thought; she had gray
eyes and a pleasantly expressive mouth and her glance, turned
upon him, was self-possessed. She smiled and said: "Thank you,"
and when he took up her valises and turned to the winding pathway
she followed him without comment.</p>

<p>There had been a sharp and bright and full sun all day. Now it
settled westward and seemed to melt into a shapeless bed of gold
flame as it touched the far-away mountains; with its passage the
air at once chilled and small streaks of breeze came out of the
north with the smell of hard weather. Winter crouched yonder on
the rim of the horizon and one day or one night, in the space of
an hour, would turn this land black and bitter, shriveling every
living thing exposed to it. He knew this land, or land like it;
and the feeling of again being in it expanded his tissues and
sharpened his zest for living. Yet for all its goodness it was
like a smiling and beautiful woman, whose lavish warmth and
generosity sprang up from those same strongly primitive sources
which could make her cruel.</p>

<p>The wall of the hotel had a door and a set of windows opening
up the dusty earth; and a single railroad tie lay before the door
to serve as a step. The man paused to permit the girl to go
before him into the place; and then followed. There was a narrow
hall and a steep stairway splitting the building into equal
halves. To the right of the hall a broad doorway opened into a
saloon; another doorway on the left led to a ladies' parlor and
office. He followed the girl into the parlor and set down the
suitcases, waiting back while she signed the register. The
hotelkeeper was a neat and large and taciturn woman. She said,
"Together or separate?" When she found out, she said to the girl:
"You can take Number Three." As the man stepped up to the
register, she watched him a moment, estimating him; and then gave
the girl another quick inspection.</p>

<p>He signed his named in a steady-slanting motion, <i>Kern
Shafter</i>, and his pen momentarily hesitated and then
continued, <i>Cincinnati, O</i>. It was a slight flaw in his
certainty, at once noticed by the hotel woman; her glance held
him a longer moment, not so much with interest or suspicion but
with a cold steadiness. He laid the pen down, at the same time
reading the name of the girl written directly above his own. It
was: <i>Josephine Russell, Bismarck, D.T</i>.</p>

<p>"You take Seven," said the hotel woman to Shafter. She spoke
to both of them with an inclusive glance. "If you're northbound
on the stage, it's at half-past four in the mornin'. We serve
breakfast at four."</p>

<p>Josephine Russell said: "May I have the key to my room?"</p>

<p>"They were carried away in people's pockets a long time ago.
If you shut your door it will stay shut. If you're afraid, prop a
chair against the inside knob." She added in a small, grim tone:
"You needn't be afraid. I don't stand for anything in this house.
You'll have to carry your own luggage. I've got no man handy. Not
that men are very handy."</p>

<p>Shafter turned to the valises and carried them up the stairs
and waited for the girl to go ahead of him. She led the way down
the hall and stepped inside Number Three. She walked across the
room to the window and turned to watch him, one last flare of
sunlight coming through her window, running over the curve of her
shoulders, deepening her breasts. She had removed her hat and he
observed that her hair was a dense black; even so she seemed fair
of complexion to him. Perhaps it was the way her lips were shaped
against her face or the way her eyes held their smiling.</p>

<p>"I appreciate your help," she said. "Do you think my trunk
will be safe on the station platform until morning?"</p>

<p>"I'll bring it to the hotel," he said, and went away.</p>

<p>She remained where she was a moment, her head slightly tilted
as she watched the doorway, idly thinking of him. He had worn a
cravat which looked as though it might have been the present of
some woman. His clothes were excellent clothes for this part of
the land, and smiling came easily to him. Yet his hands, she
recalled, were very brown; and the palms were square and thick.
She swung about and observed that the sun had gone, leaving the
land with a strange, thin, glass-colored light. The horsemen out
on the prairie were seemingly no nearer now than they had been
fifteen minutes before.</p>

<p>But all of it pleased her: the raw running of the earth, the
great empty arc of the sky, the smells rendered out by the warm
day and the curt bite of approaching winter, this sprawled little
town that served as a rendezvous for homesteaders and cow hands
and drifters fifty miles roundabout, the sound of men's voices in
the saloon below; for Josephine Russell was a western girl
returned from a trip east, and this West eased her with its
familiar things. She hummed a little song as she took the grime
of coach travel from her and prepared herself for supper; she
stood awhile, watching the last glow of the disappeared sun fade
in the high sky. Suddenly, then, the prairie all around her was
dark and the shapes of the town's other buildings were
sharp-edged shadows in the swift night. She turned down the stairs to
the dining room.</p>

<p>There was no door to shut out the barroom and she looked
directly into it when she reached the foot of the stairs,
noticing that Shafter now sat at a poker table with four other
men. He had removed his coat for comfort and sat back in his
chair with a long cigar burning between his lips. He seemed
cheerful, he seemed content...</p>

<p>At four the next morning she came half asleep down the stairs
and saw him again, at the same table and in the same chair,
finishing up an all-night game. Later, she watched him come into
the dining room. He had quickly shaved and, although he showed
the lack of sleep, he had the same air of being pleased with
everything around him. She smiled at him when he looked toward
her, and got his smile back. He had a kind of ease with him, as
though he had settled the question of himself and his future, had
arrived at a decision and had shrugged off many of the worries or
the ambitions that made other men exhaust themselves. His hair
was black and bushy and his face was of the long, thick-boned
sort, browned by weather and showing the small seams of
experience around his eyes. He had quick eyes which looked about
him and saw the people and the situations which surrounded him;
and it was this kind of watchfulness which inclined her to the
belief that he was either western, or had long been in the West.
All western men had that same awareness of their
surroundings.</p>

<p>The breakfast was bacon and hot cakes and fried potatoes and
bitter coffee. Afterwards she walked to the waiting stage in time
to see Shafter lift her luggage into the boot. He said to her: "I
never saw a stage that wouldn't go off without somebody's
luggage. I put a trunk and three valises up there. Is that
all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and stepped into the coach. A pair of young
men came aboard and sat on the opposite seat, facing her; a huge
man entered, sized up the seating capacity and squeezed himself
beside her. Shafter was last, throwing away the unsmoked end of a
cigar as he came. He had a long overcoat on his arm and as soon
as he took place between the two younger men he opened the coat
and laid it over her lap.</p>

<p>"It will be cold for an hour or so," he said.</p>

<p>Daylight flowed over the land in gray, chill waves; the smell
of dust lay rank and still upon the earth and all sounds had a
brittleness in the air. The brake rod struck sharp against the
metal bracket and the driver's hearty cursing put the four horses
in motion. They lumbered across the baked earth, leather braces
groaning; they turned the hotel's corner with the cry of one
townsman coming up from behind: "Don't forget to tell Mike I'll
be there tomorrow night!" Suddenly the town disappeared and they
were rolling onward, with the coach wheels lifting and dripping
an acrid dust.</p>

<p>The coach swayed and shuddered as it struck deeper depressions
and the impact went through the five passengers closely crowded
on the two seats. The big man sat with his hands on his knees,
his bulk spilling against Josephine Russell. He made some small
effort to pull himself together but found it impossible; and sat
still, a horsy smell flowing from his clothes. He turned his head
and grinned at her. "These rigs sure never were made for an
ord'nary-size man."</p>

<p>She smiled at him, saying nothing. The smile encouraged him
and he said: "I shot buff'lo here five years ago. Ain't none on
this side of the Mizzoura anymore."</p>

<p>Early morning's dullness was on them. Josephine Russell had,
woman fashion, settled herself to endure discomfort as gracefully
as possible. The two younger men, each pushed into his corner,
looked vacantly out upon the land, while Kern Shafter planted his
feet solidly on the coach floor and, using the two men on either
side of him as supports, fell promptly asleep.</p>

<p>Josephine Russell passed time's monotony by letting herself be
curious about him. He knew how to relax completely in odd
circumstances and had dropped asleep almost at once, his chin
touching his chest, the long full line of his mouth softening.
The wrinkles at the edge of his temples disappeared when his eyes
were closed and the squareness of his upper body went away. She
had noticed earlier that when he stood still he carried himself
at a balance, which was something civilians didn't often do. He
was slightly under six feet; he had big hands and heavy legs. In
a country that somehow impelled men to grow sweeping mustaches,
burnsides, imperials or Dundrearies, he had remained
clean-shaven; and he showed some kind of taste in his clothes and
appearance. In the West such a thing was noticeable. He had fine
manners with women and he knew how to be easy and smooth with
them. That was noticeable, too. Her eyes narrowed slightly on him
as she thought that this perhaps explained his reason for being
out here; men who came west nearly always had reasons, some of
which were gallant and some of which were sordid.</p>

<p>Time dragged on and the day grew warm. Sunlight struck through
the coach window, burning on Shafter's face. He was instantly
awake at that hot touch, motionless but with his eyes fully open.
He looked at the coat still on Josephine's lap, and bent forward
and took it and stowed it in a roll beneath his feet; and fell
asleep again. The four horses went on at a walk, at a run, at a
walk, each change of pace producing its agreeable break and its
new discomforts. The wheels lifted the dust in ropy, dripping
sheets and this dust traveled as a pall over and around the
coach, setting up a landmark that could be seen miles distant;
its gauze clouds rolled inside the coach, laying its fine film on
everything, and crept into nostril and lung. The morning's
coolness was absorbed by the first full rush of sunlight; a
dust-stale heat began to collect.</p>

<p>The big man, cramped in the corner of the seat, rolled his
eyes around him and, by a series of cautious and self-conscious
movements of his arm, burrowed into his pocket and found a cigar.
He lighted it and dragged deeply on the smoke, his face growing
bland and happier at once. Clouds of smoke spread through the
coach and the big man made an ineffectual effort with his hand to
sweep them away from Josephine.</p>

<p>The first smell of it woke Shafter at once. He opened his eyes
and watched the big man steadily. The big man felt the weight of
the glance but avoided it by looking out the window; he sighed
heavily, he clenched the cigar between his teeth, he rolled it
around his mouth, he took three rapid drags on it, and then
irritably stared at Shafter. He held the glance with some
defiance, but at last he pitched the cigar out of the window,
whereupon Shafter again fell asleep.</p>

<p>At noon the coach, struggling against the endlessness of
space, dipped into a coulee and drew before a drab, squat
building which sat in a yard littered by tin cans and empty
bottles. The passengers moved painfully from their confinement,
ate dinner and returned reluctantly to their seats. The big man
climbed beside the driver, replacing a slim, wild-haired youth
who took his seat inside with a glowering silence. Coach and
horses struggled up the coulee's side, faced the rolling sea of
grass again, and resumed the steady march. The overhead sun
pressed upon the coach, building up a trapped, sulky heat inside;
and the dust began to drift up through the cracked floorboards in
small, twining eddies. Shafter noticed how the dust touched and
clung to the girl's hair; and noticed how the sun played against
her face, against the gentle crease of her lips. Humor lived
there, even in this discomfort. She had been looking through the
window, but felt his glance and met it coolly, now not
smiling.</p>

<p>He turned his glance, staring upon the land and the land's
gray-brown monotony. Haze came down on the far edges of the world
but in that haze indistinct shapes moved&mdash;the only motion to
be seen anywhere. He watched those shapes for half an hour and
noticed them gradually drift in. Presently he knew what they were
and his eyelids came closer together and a different expression
reached his face. The driver's voice drifted down through the
squealing and the coarse grinding noise of wheels and straps and
double tree chains. "Always about here." But the coach's speed
neither increased nor decreased.</p>

<p>It was a file of young Indians, slanting forward through the
western sunlight on little patch-colored ponies. The Indians rode
with a spraddled, keeling motion, their bronze-bare legs shining
in the sun. Some of them were breech-clouted only and some wore
white man's trousers and white man's shirts dropped outside; a
hundred yards from the stage they wheeled and ran abreast of it,
the little ponies controlled by single braided rawhide lines
attached to their lower jaws. One Indian slowly drew an arrow
back in his bow, aimed it, made an imaginary shot, and relaxed
the bow; he flung up one finger derisively, whereupon the whole
party wheeled and raced away. The driver's voice came down again,
windy and relieved. "Agency bucks, but you never know whut
they're up to."</p>

<p>Josephine Russell's face was steady and sharp and hardened,
but she said nothing. She looked at Shafter.</p>

<p>He said: "Indian kids, just playing at trouble. Nothing to
fear."</p>

<p>The sullen young man with the mop of wild hair had remained
rigidly drawn together during the affair. Now he relaxed and
spoke. "You live in this country?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know. There's always trouble. Meet those kids
where they thought they had a chance and it would of been
different."</p>

<p>"No use worrying about things that don't happen."</p>

<p>The youngster was inclined to be intolerant of this apparent
greenhorn, and the presence of a woman made him accent his own
frontier wisdom. "If you'd seen what I seen out here&mdash;people
scalped and whole families with their heads busted in&mdash;you
wouldn't be so easy about it."</p>

<p>"If it had been spring or summer," said Shafter, "I would have
been worried. But winter's coming. These Indians will be on the
reservation, eating government beef. They will be good Indians,
until spring comes again."</p>

<p>The youngster disliked his point of view being overthrown and
he gave Shafter a hard, scowling glance and was evidently tempted
to set him in his proper place by a few bolder words. Shafter
took the lad's beetling glance and held it, and presently the lad
reconsidered his intentions and only said, "If you'd seen what I
seen," and reached into his pocket, producing a plug of tobacco
from which he chewed an enormous lump and pouched it against one
cheek.</p>

<p>Occasionally the stage rolled down the side of the coulee,
struck rocky bottom with painful impact and tilted upward,
throwing the passengers violently around the seats. The heat
clung on with the westering sun and the dust was a screen through
which the passengers viewed each other with blurred vision. It
dampered normal breathing; it coated the faces of all and
presently these faces turned oil-slick and this wetness grew gray
and streaky as it formed small rivulets across the dust. The
smell of the coach became rank with the odors of bodies rendering
out their moisture and the confinement turned from discomfort to
actual pain. Shafter noticed that Josephine Russell had taken
firm control of herself, pressing back her feelings, and from
this he realized she was feeling the ordeal. Now and then, aware
of her bedraggled appearance, she pressed her handkerchief
against her face.</p>

<p>The road had swung directly into the blast of the low burning
sun and therefore it was a surprise when the stage wheeled to a
stop before a raw and ungainly house standing alone in all this
emptiness. The driver got down, grunting as his feet struck; he
called back, "Night stop," and walked away. A man moved from the
house toward the horses, and one by one the weary passengers
lifted themselves from the vehicle and tried their cramped legs.
Shafter stood by, giving the girl a hand down. For a moment he
supported her, seeing a faintness come to her face; she touched
him with both arms, she held him a little while and then,
embarrassed, she stepped away. Shafter climbed to the boot of the
coach and sorted amongst the luggage. "Which will you need for
overnight?"</p>

<p>"The small gray one," she said.</p>

<p>He found it and brought it down. He stood a moment, surveying
the house; he looked to an upper window and saw a woman there,
staring out upon the coach. He gave the girl a quick side glance
and noticed she had not seen the woman; a short and darker
expression crossed his face and he led the way over the packed
yard to the door. Three great hounds lifted up and growled at him
but a voice&mdash;a woman's sharp voice&mdash;came out of the
house, cowing them.</p>

<p>Josephine Russell murmured: "Are there nothing but women
hotelkeepers in eastern Dakota?" She had made a more deliberate
appraisal of the place and now she gave Shafter a sober glance.
"Is it all right?"</p>

<p>"It will have to be," he said.</p>

<p>A woman met them in the half light of the long front room; a
woman once young, and still not old in point of years. She stood
back, ample-bosomed and careless of dress; her eyes were ready
for Shafter and had warmth for him, but they turned cool and
watchful when they swung to the girl. There was a moment&mdash;a
long and unsure moment&mdash;while she studied them. Shafter said
in a short voice: "You have a room for this lady?"</p>

<p>"Take the one at the top of the stairs. On the left."</p>

<p>He followed Josephine up the stairs. She stopped before a door
and looked back at him a moment, and then opened the door and
stepped into the room and stood in the center of it, looking on
without expression at the room's furniture, at the rough blankets
on the bed. He put down her suitcase and went to the window; he
pried it open and looked out, and turned back to her. Her glance
came over to him and he saw a slight flicker of embarrassment,
calm and self-possessed as she was.</p>

<p>He said: "A hell of a place."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "But the only place." Then she
said: "Are you going to be around here tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. He looked at the door when he left the room
and saw that there was no key; he closed the door and walked down
the stairs. The woman who ran this doubtful desert shelter stood
nearby, waiting for him.</p>

<p>He said: "Is that room all right?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "Yes. But I don't ask the genteel
to come here."</p>

<p>"This is a stage stop, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Let it stop some other place," she said. Then she laughed,
and her lips were full and heavy and red. "But there's no other
place. Do you want a room?"</p>

<p>He said, "No," and color came to him and he turned out to the
porch. He walked around the house, sizing it up, its windows
blanked out by drawn green roller shades, its paintless angles,
its unloveliness. There was an outside stairway running up the
east wall, on which he laid a moment's attention; behind the
house was another porch, and water and basin. He washed here and
beat the dust from his clothes, and resumed his circle of the
house. The sun dropped in a silent crash of light and, coming
from an apparent nowhere, riders shaped themselves against the
sudden twilight. He sat on the porch steps, watching them reach
the yard, wheel and step off; all men stamped by their trade,
booted and spurred and dusty and scorched by the sun, turned dry
by the heat and hollow-hungry, careless and nervous of eye,
watching everything and nothing. There was a bar farther back in
the house and out of it lights presently rose, and the sound of
men talking&mdash;and of women talking. He got up and crossed the
main room. He paused at the doorway of the bar and had his look
at the women; he moved to the bar and took his drink, and stood
with his elbows on the bar until he heard the dinner triangle
banging. Then he went on to the dining-room door and waited for
Josephine.</p>

<p>She came down the stairs and paused to look around; when her
eyes found him he saw the relieved lightening of her face. She
came up to him, smiling a little, and went into the dining room
with him. He saw her glance touch the dozen men at the table and
coolly take in the woman at its head&mdash;and the two other
women also present. She knew them at once, he realized; it was
the faintest break on her face, soon covered. After that she took
her place and she never looked at them again.</p>

<p>The big plates and platters came circling around, were emptied
and carried away by a China boy to be refilled. One man, already
drunk, talked steadily; but otherwise the crowd was silent and
hungry and ate without conversation. Small talk was a custom of
the East; out here men resented making a ceremony out of a meal
and wasted no time on it. Ten minutes after they had entered the
room, most of the men had finished, and had gone on to the bar;
in a little while the rest of the group had deserted the table,
leaving Shafter and Josephine to themselves. She sipped at her
coffee, tired but relaxed. Through his cigar smoke he watched the
lamplight shining against the gray of her eyes, he observed the
sweetness and the humor restlessly living in her lip corners. She
caught his glance and held it, thoughtfully considering him,
making her own silent observations concerning him. Racket began
to spread from the saloon and a woman's voice grew strident. The
girl shrugged her shoulders and rose from the table.</p>

<p>He followed her back to the big front room and he observed
that she stopped at the stairs and looked toward the second floor
with an expression of distaste. Suddenly she wheeled toward him
and took his arm and they went out of the house and strolled
along the vague road. A sickle moon lay far down in the sky,
turned butter yellow by the haze in the air, and the stars were
great woolly-crystal masses overhead. Sharp-scented dust rose
beneath their feet, the fragrance of the earth was
strong&mdash;the harsh and vigorous emanations of the earth
itself. He felt the girl's body sway as she walked; he felt the
warmth of her body, the warmth of her thoughts. The desert ran
blackly away, formless and mysterious, and far out on the flats a
coyote called.</p>

<p>"Do you know this country?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I know the West," he said. "I put in some time in the
Southwest."</p>

<p>"Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"It's better than what I've had lately."</p>

<p>They went half a mile onward, slowly pacing; and turned back.
The lights of the house gushed from a dozen windows&mdash;the
only light and the only warmth in all this empty stretch of
space; and the sound of laughter, sharply shrill, rode in the
little wind.</p>

<p>She said: "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Kern Shafter. I regret that you have to stay here
tonight."</p>

<p>She didn't answer that until they had reached the porch. Then
she murmured: "It will do," and passed into the house. At the
foot of the stairs she turned to him and asked a question she had
asked once before. "You'll be here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Good night."</p>

<p>She nodded her head slightly by way of answer, and climbed the
stairs.</p>

<p>After she had gone into her room Shafter left the house and
went to the coach standing in the yard. He climbed to the boot
and found his valise and took out a revolver. He sat on the top
of the coach and hefted the gun idly in his palm, feeling its
familiar weight, its accustomed and comfortable reality. He
thrust it inside his trouser band and lay back to smoke out his
cigar while the depth of night increased. The moon's light had no
effect on the blind blackness; this yard, touched by house
lights, was an island in all the surrounding emptiness. The stars
sharply glistened and the scented wind lifted; and mystery closed
down and loneliness moved in, with its questions and its far
wonder. He sat still, brooding over things behind him, over old
injuries still burning and old memories still sweet. When he had
thought of them and had felt the heat of them, he closed his mind
upon them; and yet, like the leaks in a dam gate, there were
apertures in his will and his resolution, through which little
seepages of memory still came. He stretched out full length,
feeling the goodness of the wind and the ease that came to him.
Looking at the sky, he seemed to grow longer and broader, and the
space inside him was less crowded. He thought: "I have made one
right decision," and felt the peace of knowing it.</p>

<p>With the night also came the quick chill of winter not far
away; the starglow had its frigid glitter, the far unseen
distance had its threat of storm. Other riders came out of the
night, dropped off before the house and moved in, to add to the
growing noise. Shafter dropped from the coach and returned to the
main room. He found a pair of chairs and drew them together,
sitting on one and laying his feet on the other. The big woman
who ran the place found him here, so placed that he had a view of
the stairs and the doorway of the room directly above.</p>

<p>She stopped before him, smiling down. She lifted his hat and
threw it aside and, still with her half smile, ran one finger
along the edge of his head. "Your woman will be all right."</p>

<p>"Not mine," he said.</p>

<p>"I guess," she said, "you wouldn't have much trouble with a
woman, if you wished. I know your kind."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you don't."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me what I don't know," she said, half sharp with
him. But her brief smile came back as she continued to watch him.
"You don't need to curl up like a hound in front of her door. It
will get noisy, but nothing will happen."</p>

<p>"Nothing will," he agreed.</p>

<p>"You plan to stay here all night? Right here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She ceased to smile. She spoke in a soft, jeering, faintly
envious tone. "That's romantic, isn't it? You fool." Suddenly she
dropped a hand on his stomach, on the shape of the revolver
beneath his coat. "I wouldn't flourish that thing around here.
There's a couple men in the bar who could shoot that diamond ring
off your finger without scratching your skin."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, and grinned, "tough ones."</p>

<p>She was puzzled at his reaction. Her lips indecisively
loosened while she watched him. He lay back on his chair, a quiet
man who didn't seem to care about many things, who didn't give
himself away. He dressed well and she knew, without giving it a
thought, that he was far above her and perhaps had only a scorn
for her. She hated men like that, even more than she hated the
rough ones who came here to this house with their appetites; she
hated them with a hard desire to use her claws on them&mdash;the
fashionable, cool ones&mdash;and pull them down to her. But she
didn't find herself hating this man. It was as she had said
before to him: he had a way that women liked and an appeal that
women would answer. But he didn't seem to care.</p>

<p>She started to touch him again but checked the gesture. "My
God," she murmured, "this is a lonely place. Sometimes...If
you're crazy enough to sit here all night I'll bring you a
blanket later. Maybe some hot coffee."</p>

<p>"I'll be here," he said. She had swung away, but she checked
and turned, her eyes scanning him with a small break of hope.
Hard living had begun to etch its lines along her face, yet she
still was a pretty woman in a loose, heavy, physical way.
Carefulness of dress would have done much for her, but she had
forgotten to care. She shrugged her shoulders and walked into the
saloon, which grew increasingly noisy.</p>

<p>Josephine's room was ceiled with rough lumber whose edges
never quite lay together. There was a single window, with a green
roller shade discolored by sun and in-beating rain. A lighted
lamp stood on a table made up of fragments of boxes which once
had contained canned goods; above the table a blemished mirror
hung askew. The bed was a four-poster made of solid mahogany, the
possible derelict of some wagon train passing through, and on it
lay lumpy quilts and a pillow without a slip. The floor had once
been covered with a lead-colored paint, but this now had largely
broken away so that it was a kind of leprous gray and brown.</p>

<p>Josephine stood in the middle of the room, remembering the
people downstairs and hearing the noise which now came up in
growing stridency; particularly she heard the voices of the
women. She shrugged her shoulders and walked to the bed, pulling
back the quilt to explore the two blue army blankets which served
as sheets. She bent, looking closely at the blankets; she peeled
back the blankets and studied the mattress. She bent still
farther down, running a finger along its stitched edge. "At least
there are no bedbugs," she thought, and got ready for bed.</p>

<p>She propped the room's lone chair against the door-knob,
turned out the light and stood a moment at the window, watching
the yard. She saw a man lying on top of the coach, smoking a
cigar, and though it was intensely black beyond the range of
house lights, she thought she recognized the shape of Shafter's
shoulders. The thought of him, vagrant and curious and slightly
warm, held her still for a little while; then she crept into
bed.</p>

<p>There were men in the adjoining rooms, their lights coming
through the warped joining of the wall boards, their voices quite
plain as they exchanged stories, each worse than the one before.
She rested, still and wide awake, listening to a fight begin and
go through the house in grunting, crashing, falling echoes. Some
man yelled out his cursing and a gun exploded and a woman
screamed; afterwards a man rushed into the night and presently
rode away at a dead run. Near midnight someone came slowly up the
stairs, his body making a weight on the flimsy wood. He crawled
along the hall, his hands scraping the wall. He touched the knob
of the door and stopped, and she heard the knob turn and the door
give; after that, she heard another traveler come lightly up the
steps. One soft word was said and a sharp blow struck, sending
one of the men against the wall. Presently that one fell down the
stairs in a tumbling, rocketing fashion. The man who had so
lightly come upward now went down with the same soft footfalls.
Josephine thought: "He's watching out for me," and thought of
Shafter, again with relief. Little by little some kind of order
crept into this wild house as its inmates fell asleep, and its
guests rode away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; WEST OF THE RIVER</h2>

<p class="first">AT one o'clock, Shafter left his seat at the
foot of the stairs and went into the barroom. Everybody had gone
except one drunk stretched dead to the world across the pool
table, and one gloomy houseman cleaning up the debris. Shafter
got a glass of whisky and carried it to a table and sat down; the
woman who seemed to run this place came up from some other
quarter of the house and took a chair across from him. The flame
of her vitality obviously burned low, for she sat with her elbows
on the table, supporting her head, staring at the table's green
felt top. She murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hard way to make a living, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He said nothing and presently his silence made her lift her
glance to him. He smiled at her and pushed his drink over the
table. She looked at it a long while, all the brightness faded
out of her. "No," she murmured, "I hate the sight of it." She
looked up at the barman. "Go get us some coffee, Bill." Then she
noticed the drunk on the pool table and a raspiness came to her
voice. "Roll that dumb beast off there before he digs his spurs
into a thousand dollars' worth of woodwork." The barkeep was a
taciturn and a literal man. He moved to the table, put both arms
under the sleeping drunk and gave him a short shove. The drunk
fell loosely, striking in sections, at the knees and then at the
shoulders. His head slammed hard on the floor and his mouth flew
open. He rolled slightly, threshed his arms, and ceased to move.
Bill went on toward the back of the house.</p>

<p>"Look at him," said the woman in bitter disgust, pointing to
the drunk. "That's a man. That's what they all look like. He'll
sober up, eat breakfast and go away. But he'll be back in a
couple days. That's what I've got to make my living from."</p>

<p>He said: "Feel this way every night?"</p>

<p>"Every night."</p>

<p>"Time to move on then."</p>

<p>"One place is no better than another," she said, and looked at
him with a small revival of interest. When she realized he had
been steadily watching her, she pulled herself straight and ran
her hands lightly over her hair. "Do I look as bad as I
feel?"</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"May," she said. "There's another May here, but she's
Straight-Edge May."</p>

<p>"All women are beautiful, May."</p>

<p>"You fool," she murmured, "don't talk like that. You don't
mean it. Even if you did mean it, it would get a woman like me to
thinking about things she shouldn't anymore." But his words had
lifted her; they had revived her spirits. "You've knocked around,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Running from something."</p>

<p>He showed her his smile again, that easy and careless smile
which changed him, which took the darkness out of him. He had
sympathy for her but he let it show in his eyes rather than spend
words on it. He sat with her and took her as she was. "Everybody
runs from something, May. Or runs after something."</p>

<p>"In trouble?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't have to watch what's behind me."</p>

<p>"You've never had to come to places like this for your fun,
either," she said, judging him with her wealth of man-knowledge.
"Your kind uses theater tickets and bonbons, and back rooms at
fashionable restaurants."</p>

<p>For the second time this night, she caught him off guard,
causing him to flush. "May," he said. "Let's talk about the
weather."</p>

<p>She regarded him closely, amused that she could embarrass him
but also puzzled by it; embarrassment was a rare thing in a man
and somewhat beyond her limits of experience. She shrugged her
shoulders. "I guess I don't know much about your kind. I only met
one like you. That was a long time ago. If I knew where he was
now I'd write him a letter and let him know just how I turned out
after he got through with me." A small tinge of bitterness got
into her voice. "Maybe it would make him add something extra on
the collection plate next time he went to church."</p>

<p>"How do you know he goes to church, May?"</p>

<p>"It's fashionable for his kind to marry somebody respectable
and go to church, and buy his way into heaven. No doubt, when he
gets sentimental, he sometimes thinks, 'I wonder where she is
now.' Not that he's sorry. His kind of man is proud of one good
sinful memory. As for the woman, she can just look out for
herself." She bent toward him and showed him an old, old anger.
"I don't like your kind of men." But as soon as she said it, her
mouth softened. "But I like you. I guess that explains how I got
here."</p>

<p>Bill came in with two cups of coffee, black and hot and rank,
and moved back to his dismal chores. Shafter dumped his whisky
into the coffee and drank it slowly. He was loose in the chair,
he was thoroughly at rest, enjoying the small tastes and sounds
and colors around him. She thought to herself, as she studied
him: "I'd figure him a genteel bum, except that he threw George
Dixon down the stairs." That made her speak up. "You're too quick
for your own good. Dixon didn't mean to go into the lady's room.
He was just drunk."</p>

<p>"There is only one way to handle Dixons," he said.</p>

<p>"He may come back," she said. "He's a mean one."</p>

<p>"If you hit Dixons hard," he said, "they don't come back. If
you hit them soft, they do."</p>

<p>She said: "You uncover yourself just a little bit at a time.
You get different as you go. Is there anything I can do for
you?"</p>

<p>He looked at her with a greater attention. "How's that,
May?"</p>

<p>"Do you need a stake? I've got plenty of money."</p>

<p>He didn't immediately answer and he didn't smile at her again.
He finished his coffee, and rose. Her glance remained on him.</p>

<p>"Didn't hurt your feelings, did I?" she wanted to know.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, May, you made me feel fine. But I
don't need it."</p>

<p>She followed him from the barroom to the front room. "You
don't need to stay down here anymore. Take the room across the
hall from your lady."</p>

<p>He turned on her, looking down, the quietness of his eyes and
the expression in them giving her goodness. She wanted to touch
him, to reach up and lay her fingers through his black hair; she
wanted to come close upon him and lift her mouth for him. But she
stood back, a realist who knew that for him she was a vessel long
since drained empty; it was the first time in many years she had
felt that way about a man.</p>

<p>"Why did you offer me the grubstake, May?"</p>

<p>"People can always hope," she said. "Maybe you would have
taken it. Maybe you would have stayed."</p>

<p>He moved to the stairs and turned back there, one hand lying
heavy-spread on the railing. "Remember what I told you," he said.
"All women are beautiful."</p>

<p>She shook her head, darkened by what she wanted and couldn't
have. "If you wish to be kind, never say that to a woman like
me." She watched him all the way up the stairs.</p>

<p>And she was at the foot of the stairs at five in the morning
when, following breakfast, he turned out of the house. She had
taken pains with her hair; she had pressed away the lines about
her eyes with cold towels, and she had put on the dress she used
for trips to Fargo. But she didn't speak to him as he went by,
for he had Josephine with him, and she knew exactly what her
station was. After they had gone out, she moved to the porch,
watching the stage swing around in the yard. She saw him bend and
look through the window at her; and she stood still and watched
the stage roll away through its dust and become at last a point
in the distance.</p>

<p>The man who had been capsized from the table the night before
now moved out of the house in painful slowness. He stopped beside
her, puzzled as to the soreness of his bones. "By God," he said,
"it must of been a big night. Somebody ride a horse through the
barroom, May? I been stepped on, all over."</p>

<p>"No," she said. "You just fell down."</p>

<p>"Must of been from the roof," he murmured and went on to his
horse. He groaned when he went into the saddle; he turned and
waved a hand. "See you soon, May."</p>

<p>She still watched the stage, but she said, with a piece of a
smile: "All right, Tom. Be good and come again."</p>

<p><br>
THE coach ran along the twin ruts of the road,
outward upon the prairie, under the rising flood of clear and
brilliant sunshine. For the space of half an hour, the world
stood bathed in morning's freshness, in its coolness, in its
bright cleansing light; and for that half hour the horizons were
sharp lines in the distance. Then the coolness went away and the
faint fog began to rise and the enveloping dust settled within
the coach and the monotony of the ride gripped them again. Three
of the passengers had dropped off at the night station, leaving
only the heavy man, Josephine and Shafter inside. Shafter propped
his shoulders in the corner of the coach, braced his feet on the
floor and fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, there was a series of small, ragged up-and-down
black strokes against the emptiness and the horses had smelled
their destination and were now running freely without the urging
of the driver; somewhat later the stage moved into the mouth of
Fargo's main street, passed a row of raw-boarded houses to either
side, turned a corner and stopped at a depot shed standing beside
a single track.</p>

<p>The driver got down, shouting, "Fargo, and yore train's in
sight," and went up to the boot, throwing down the luggage
without regard for the contents. Shafter stepped out and gave
Josephine a hand; he found her luggage and piled it near the
track, standing back to light a cigar. The train had come out of
the east, its progress singing forward on the rails and its
whistle hoarsely warning the town. Townsmen strolled up to break
the day's tedium and to touch again for an instant that East out
of which they had come; to catch, in the train's steamy bustle,
the feeling of motion and excitement and freedom which had
impelled most of them to come west but which they had lost as
soon as they had taken root here.</p>

<p>Josephine turned to Shafter and regarded him with soberness.
"You have been kind. If I should not see you again, let me wish
you all good luck."</p>

<p>"I'll be on the train."</p>

<p>"Bismarck?" asked Josephine, and showed him a remote pleasure
with her eyes.</p>

<p>He nodded instead of speaking; for the engine coasted by with
its bell steadily clanging and its exhausts ejaculating gusts of
steam. Two baggage cars and five coaches growled to a jerky stop,
and passengers looked curiously through the grimed car windows;
and an army captain stepped to the runway and began a vigorous
constitutional, his cap slanted rakishly on a head of long,
bright red hair. The conductor stood on the runway and shouted,
"Fargo&mdash;Fargo, twenty minutes for lunch!"</p>

<p>Passengers now descended and ran for the lunchroom sitting at
the edge of the platform. Josephine meanwhile turned to the
train, whereupon Shafter gave her an arm up the nearest coach
platform, collected her luggage and carried it into the car. He
stowed his own valise on an empty seat and left the train,
crossing to the lunchroom. Some of the passengers had seated
themselves along a table, before a row of dishes prepared for
hasty service; and other passengers, unable to find seats,
reached over the heads of the fortunate ones and improvised
sandwiches for themselves. Shafter noticed a pile of lunch boxes
made up, took two of them, paid the bill and returned to
Josephine.</p>

<p>"You never know when these trains get where they're going," he
said, leaving a lunch box with her.</p>

<p>He returned to his own seat and began on his meal. The engine
bell had begun to sound again and the conductor stood on the
runway, crying "Bo-o-o-ard," to summon passengers from the
lunchroom. The engine released its brakes and gave a first hard
<i>chuff</i>, sending a preliminary quiver through the coaches.
The train slid forward, gathering speed, while a woman on the
train began to scream as a last man rushed from the lunch-room,
sprinted along the runway and caught the grab rails of the last
coach. The gathered townsmen cheered this extra touch of
melodrama, and the engine whistled its throaty farewell as it
gathered speed, and the vacuum of its passage lifted eddies of
dust and paper on the tracks. It left behind the smell of steam
and coal smoke and warm lubricating oil; it left behind the
memory of liveliness and motion and it left behind, in the heart
of more than one townsman, the half-formed decision to pull up
his roots again, as he had before, and move into that bright West
whose unknown distances held perpetual promise of fortune and
adventure.</p>

<p>The coaches, castoffs of other lines in the East, swayed with
the not yet thoroughly settled grade of this new railroad,
stretched taut on their couplings, and slammed together when the
engine slightly abated speed. Cinders pelted the windows and
smoke streamed back the length of the train; and the engine
whistle laid out its hoarse notice upon the land. Here and there
a siding ran briefly beside the main line and here and there a
yellow section shanty stood lonely in the sun. Out in the
distance an occasional antelope band, startled from grazing, fled
away in beautiful smoothness. Once in a great while Shafter saw a
ranch house or a rider, or cattle. Propping his feet on the
opposite seat, he fell asleep, and later woke to find the train
stopping at a town that was four little shanties facing the
tracks; and slept again until he heard the conductor cry,
"Bismarck!"</p>

<p>The town's gray out-sheds and slovenly shanties and corrals
slid forward and its main street appeared&mdash;one long row of
saloons, stores, livery barns and freighter sheds crowded side by
side, unevenly joined and roughly thrown together. The train
stopped, heads bobbed beside the car windows and presently people
came in to search for friends. Shafter picked up his valise and
left the coach.</p>

<p>The sun was down and coolness already began to move over the
earth. There had been rain in Bismarck, turning the yellow dust
gray and slick, and coating the boots of the gathered crowd. An
army ambulance stood near the track, held by a cavalry corporal,
and a pair of ladies crossed to it and were whirled away.
Josephine Russell meanwhile descended, walked to a gray-haired
man and kissed him. The gray-haired man took her luggage and
turned off, but for a moment Josephine Russell paused to look
back at Shafter. Impulse moved her to him.</p>

<p>"I wish you luck," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll remember your wish," he answered and lifted his hat to
her and watched her walk on. She was an alert, happy woman; she
had presented him with that fair and serene face which he most
admired, and as he looked at her retreating shape he had his
slight regret&mdash;the regret of a man who sees beauty and grace
disappear.</p>

<p>The cars were now empty, the engine had been uncoupled and
moved on; for this was the farthest west of the railroad, in this
year of 1875. Beyond Bismarck was the yellow Missouri, and beyond
the Missouri lay the unknown lands of the Sioux where,
intermittently for ten years, little columns and detachments of
the army had marched and fought, had won and had been defeated.
Shafter lifted his valise and moved toward a wagon wherein sat a
driver. He spoke to the driver:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where's Fort Abraham Lincoln?"</p>

<p>The driver pointed a finger southwesterly. "Along that road,
four miles to the Point. Ferry there." Then he said: "Get
in."</p>

<p>Shafter dumped his valise into the wagon's bed and took place
beside the driver who now set his team down the street at a trot.
At the end of the street the road moved in dog-leg fashion up and
down and around little folds of earth, past an occasional house,
past Indians riding head down and indifferent, their toes pointed
outward, their shoulders stooped. The team kept up an easy
mincing trot, making a little melody of harness chains, and so
covered four miles, coming then to a highland upon which sat a
collection of houses sitting apart and facing all directions.
Beyond this highland the terrain rolled into bottom lands and
reached the Missouri. Beyond the river stood the fort on its
bluff, its line of houses square and trim and formidable. The
driver slammed on his brakes as the wagon descended the grade to
the ferry dock; and pointed at the houses to either hand.</p>

<p>"If you got money to spend, don't come here. This is the
Point. It's off the military reservation. It is a bad place, my
friend." He let go the brakes and the wagon rolled to the deck of
a river steamer, once glamorous but now converted to something
little better than a scow with steam; on the pilot house a gilded
sign gave its name, THE UNION. The name was its only substantial
part, for when the lines were cast off the ancient engines shook
the boat in all its frames. They surged forward through the near
shore's back eddy, came upon the middle channel and were seized
by a current that lay deceptively beneath this murky river's
surface. The <i>Union</i> shuddered throughout, paused and lost
steerage way. It skewed across the current, fell five hundred
yards downriver, and reached slack water on the far side; with
its engines racking its ancient frame, it worked slowly upstream
and nosed into the slip. The wagoner released his brakes, whipped
his team into a run and went up the grade to the top of the
bluff. When he reached it he sat back and blew out a breath.</p>

<p>"Damn boat someday is goin' to keep going right on down to
Yankton. Or blow up."</p>

<p>The walls of this fort were formed by the back edges of
barracks, storehouses, officers' quarters and stables, all these
facing a great parade ground running a thousand feet or better in
each direction. The teamster drew before the guardhouse post,
said "Commissary," and was waved in.</p>

<p>"You know where the adjutant's office might be?" asked
Shafter.</p>

<p>"Down there by the end of the quartermaster building."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the ride," offered Shafter and dropped off with
his valise. He went along the east side of the parade ground,
traveling on a board walk which skirted troop quarters; and as he
passed these long barracks he heard the clatter of dishes coming
up from the mess hall in the rear of each barrack. This was
supper time, the sun just dropping below the ridge to the west of
the fort; and the ceremony of retreat was not far away, for
orderlies were now cutting out of the stable area, leading horses
across the parade to Officers' Row. He had just reached the
doorway of the adjutant's office when the trumpeter at the guard
gate blew first call.</p>

<p>He stepped inside in time to see a huge, tall first lieutenant
clap on a dress helmet with its plume, thrust the chin strap into
place and hook up his sword. Dundreary whiskers grew in silken
luxury along his jowls, out of which showed a big-fleshed mouth,
a solid nose and a pair of darkly sharp eyes. He looked at
Shafter. He said, "Yes?" and started for the door. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"I'll wait until the lieutenant returns from retreat," said
Shafter.</p>

<p>The lieutenant said, "Very well," and flung himself through
the door, followed by a sergeant major empurpled with years of
weather and hard living. A corporal remained behind in the
office, his arm hanging from a sling.</p>

<p>Shafter watched five cavalry companies file out from the
stables to the parade ground. The hark of officers came sharp
through the still air. "Column right! Left into line! Com-m-pany,
halt!" Horsemen trotted briskly here and there, lifting quick
puffs of dust from the hard parade. One by one, the five
companies came into regimental front, each company mounted on
horses of matched color, each company's guidon colorfully waving
from the pole affixed in the stirrup socket of the guidon
corporal's stirrup. For a moment the regiment remained still,
each trooper sitting with a grooved ease in his McClellan, legs
well down and back arched, saber hanging on loosened sling to
left side, carbine suspended from belt swivel to right, dress
helmet cowled down to the level of his eyes. Thus the Seventh sat
in disciplined, impassive form&mdash;a long double rank of dark,
largely mustached faces&mdash;homely, burned faces, Irish faces,
seasoned and youthful faces, faces of solid value and faces of
wildness&mdash;all pointed frontward to the company commander and
to the adjutant now taking his report. Presently, the adjutant
wheeled his horse, trotted it fifty feet forward and came to a
halt before a slim shape poised lithe and watchful on his
mount.</p>

<p>Even at this distance Shafter recognized the commanding
officer&mdash;that long, bushy fall of almost golden hair which
even the cowling of the dress helmet could not conceal, that
sweeping tawny dragoon's mustache which sharpened the bony,
hawkish nose and accented the depth of eye sockets, that sinuous
and muscularly restless body now held in momentary restraint
against its own incessant rebellion. There sat the man who was a
living legend, the least-disciplined and poorest scholar of his
West Point class of 1861; whose wild charges and consuming love
of naked action had turned him into a major general by brevet at
the age of twenty-five and who was, in the shrunken peacetime
army, Lieutenant-Colonel of the Seventh Cavalry and its commander
by virtue of the absence of Colonel Sturgis. Everybody in America
knew the face of the man; it was a household familiarity, the
thin lips half concealed by the waterfall mustache, the hungry
boniness of the jaw, the blue inset eyes seeking attention,
seeking any audacity to prove the right to attention.</p>

<p>Custer's arm answered the adjutant's salute with a swift
nervous jerk. A word was spoken. The band burst into a quick
march, still stationary on the right of the line. The officers of
the regiment rode slowly front and center, formed a rank and
moved upon the commanding officer. Shafter heard the brittle
crack of an officer's voice halt them. He watched them salute
Custer, and receive his return salute, after which they took
place behind him. Suddenly now the band swung around and marched
down the front of the regiment, in full tune, and wheeled and
marched back. Silence came completely; all the shapes upon this
parade turned still as the massed buglers tossed up their
trumpets and sounded retreat. Hard upon the heels of the last
trumpet note the little brass cannon at the foot of the flagpole
boomed out, its echo rocketing into the western ridge and out
across the Missouri. The flag began to descend and the band
struck up a national air. Shafter pulled his heels together and
removed his hat; he stood balanced, facing the flag as it slid
down the pole toward the trooper waiting to receive it. In the
ensuing quiet, Custer's strident voice carried the length and
breadth of the parade.</p>

<p>"Pass in review!"</p>

<p>The first sergeants, now commanding the companies, wheeled
about, harking their stiff calls. The band broke into a march
tune, the regimental front broke like a fan and came into platoon
column; it turned the corners of the parade and passed before the
commanding officer with hard dust smoking up around it. Down at
the far end of the parade ground, each company pulled away toward
its own stable. The ceremony was done.</p>

<p>Out by the flagstaff the officers surrendered their horses and
moved idly along the walk toward their quarters. The adjutant
took his last orders and departed. An orderly galloped forward to
take Custer's horse, but the general swung his mount and flung it
headlong across the parade, wheeled and raced it back. Arriving
before his quarters he sprang to the ground, tossed over the
reins and stamped up the porch of his house; it had been one
sudden outburst of energy which could no longer be dammed up.</p>

<p>Shafter meanwhile stepped back into the adjutant's office.
Presently the adjutant came in, slightly sweating; he removed his
dress hat and laid it on a desk, he unbuckled his saber and hung
it to a peg on the wall and, having done this, he looked at
Shafter.</p>

<p>"Well, sir."</p>

<p>"I should like to enlist in this regiment," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"Ohio."</p>

<p>"How was it you did not enlist at the nearest recruiting
service?"</p>

<p>"I prefer to pick my regiment."</p>

<p>"That involved considerable train fare," observed the
adjutant, and took time to consider Shafter with a very cool eye.
"Normally we are recruited from Jefferson Barracks. Still, we can
enlist you." He turned to the corporal with the bad arm. "Get an
enlistment form, Jackson. Get a doctor's blank, too."</p>

<p>Jackson searched another desk for the required forms and the
adjutant lowered his rather massive frame into a chair and
considered the work on his desk. The corporal sat down at another
desk and beckoned Shafter before him. "Name?" he said, and began
to take Shafter's history. "Recent address? Next of kin?"</p>

<p>"No next of kin."</p>

<p>"No next of kin."</p>

<p>"Closest friend, then."</p>

<p>"None," said Shafter.</p>

<p>The corporal leaned back and chewed his pen a moment, looking
at Shafter. The adjutant raised his head to consider this new
recruit. "Are you that alone in this world?" he asked, with some
skepticism. But he nodded at the corporal and murmured, "Let it
go." Both the corporal and the lieutenant, Shafter realized, were
thinking the same thing: that he was another drifter running from
a past. These regiments on the border had many such men; it was
an old story.</p>

<p>"Birthplace, parents' names? Age, weight, color of hair and
eyes? Height? Distinguishing marks?" The clerk rattled off the
inquiries and scrawled them down. It grew late and he was
impatient to be free&mdash;to join the poker game at troop
barrack, to meet a woman across the river at the Point, to
sleep&mdash;or perhaps simply to sit idle and dream of the
comfort and the freedom of civilian life. Shafter quietly
supplied the answers required of him, thinking of that same
civilian life with no regrets and no particular warmth. Insofar
as he had a home, this army post would satisfy him completely;
the uniform would be the answer to his wants. He heard men come
into the adjutant's office behind him. He heard the adjutant
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is slightly late, Doctor. But could you examine this man
for enlistment?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Shafter turned and saw the doctor, standing by the adjutant's
desk. But his eyes lingered on the man only a moment; for there
was another officer now in the room, a captain looking out from
beneath the rim of his dress helmet at Shafter, with a keen
attention. He was a heavy, stocky man with a broad practical
face, with a heavy sand-colored mustache guarding his upper
mouth. It was a serviceable, unemotional Irish countenance, a
face disciplined by duty and routine and largely beyond the whims
of excitement. Shafter looked back at him gravely. The doctor
said, "Step in the room," pointing to a doorway back of the
adjutant, "and strip."</p>

<p>He followed Shafter, he waited, his mind obviously on other
things. He took a mechanical survey of Shafter's naked frame and
pointed to the thick whitened welt of a scar that made a
foot-long crescent on Shafter's left flank, above the hip "What was
that?"</p>

<p>"Saber cut."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the doctor, and made his tapping inspection of
Shafter's chest. "How old?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-two."</p>

<p>The doctor completed the rest of his routine in silence and
motioned for Shafter to resume his clothes, meanwhile himself
leaving the room. He sat down at the edge of the adjutant's desk,
completing the physical form. "He'll do physically," he said to
the adjutant.</p>

<p>The captain still remained in the room. Now he said: "I'll
take that man."</p>

<p>The adjutant grinned. "You want everything for A Company,
Moylan."</p>

<p>"I'm down to fifty-three men," said Captain Moylan.</p>

<p>"You're no worse off than the other companies."</p>

<p>"I'd like to have him, Cooke," said Captain Moylan, pressing
the point.</p>

<p>The adjutant looked at the enlistment blank placed on his desk
by the corporal. The corporal had gone. Cooke read through it.
"He came all the way out here to enlist. You're buying a pig in
the poke. Probably he's using the uniform to hide."</p>

<p>"He's had service before," said the doctor. "Saber scar."</p>

<p>Cooke said: "Jackson forgot to ask that question. It doesn't
show here."</p>

<p>"Do I get him?" asked Moylan.</p>

<p>"You can have him, but the other company commanders will
charge me with partiality."</p>

<p>"One more thing," said Moylan. "Let me swear him in."</p>

<p>Both Cooke and the doctor showed some degree of surprise.
Cooke was on the point of asking a question, but at that moment
Shafter, having dressed, returned to the office and took stand in
front of the adjutant's desk. Cooke now gave Shafter a more
thorough glance, noting his posture, his drawn-together carriage,
his composed silence. Cooke said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you leave any felonies behind you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Have you had prior service?"</p>

<p>Shafter's answer came after a small pause, noticeable to all
of them. "Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"What organization?"</p>

<p>The small delay was again noticeable. "Fourteenth Ohio."</p>

<p>"That would be the Civil War," said Cooke.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What was the quality of your discharge?"</p>

<p>"Honorably mustered out, end of war."</p>

<p>Cooke nodded. He took a little brown volume of army
regulations from a pile on the desk, searched through it and
found a page. He handed the open book to Captain Moylan. Shafter
turned to face the captain and, without being requested, raised
his right hand. Moylan looked at the page and began the oath: "Do
you solemnly swear..."</p>

<p>When it was done with, Moylan gravely listened to Shafter's "I
do," watched his face a considerable moment, and tossed the book
of regulations on the table. "Very well," he softly said. "You
are now a private in the Seventh Cavalry, attached to A Company.
Follow me over to barracks."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Shafter, and moved out of the office behind
Moylan. Cooke sat with his chin propped in, one massive, meaty
hand, watching the two go. "That was odd. Porter. Something
there, I fancy."</p>

<p>"He's no raw Irishman off the boat," commented Porter. "He
smells like a broken-down gentleman to me."</p>

<p>"I didn't seem to catch the broken-down part. If he is a
gentleman, may God help him. We've got a few of them. They're
very forlorn souls. Well." He rose and made a halfhearted gesture
of creating some sort of neatness on his desk. "A little game
tonight?"</p>

<p>"I've been invited to dance the opening set at D Company's
ball," said Porter. "I'll meet you later."</p>

<p>Out on the baked parade ground, Shafter fell in step with
Moylan, to the left and slightly behind the captain. First
twilight had come to the land, the low hills to the west of the
fort turning dark and edged against the sky, the great endless
prairie to the east slowly foreshortening, as night crept over
it. A guard relief detachment went scuffing by, the sergeant
saluting Moylan as he passed. Moylan returned it absent-mindedly.
He spoke to Shafter without turning his head.</p>

<p>"This was considerable of a surprise, Kern."</p>

<p>"I hadn't realized you were with the Seventh."</p>

<p>"I'm damned glad to see you. Often thought of you, It has been
a long time since Winchester and Cumberland Gap. I don't suppose
you expected to see old Myles Moylan as a captain of cavalry. It
has been a hard route. I was sergeant major in this outfit before
I got my commission. Coming up through the ranks is not the easy
way to do it."</p>

<p>"God bless you," said Shafter. "I can think of nothing
better."</p>

<p>"I asked Cooke to attach you to my company," said Moylan. "I
didn't say why. You didn't wish me to say why, did you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It was a hard, hard thing," murmured Moylan. "I have never
ceased to feel anger over it. Have you done anything about
it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to be done."</p>

<p>Moylan walked a full twenty feet before speaking again; and
his words were troubled. "The strangeness of it does not stop
with my being here and you being here. It is more than that. I
wish I could have had the chance of speaking to you quietly
before you took the oath. I think you wouldn't have stayed.
Garnett is here. Or did you know that, and come to hunt him
especially out?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know it," said Shafter, and said nothing more. He
walked steadily beside Moylan, his chin dropped, expression
drained from his face.</p>

<p>Moylan said: "He is first lieutenant of L. That is why I had
Cooke assign you to my company. It would have been highly
unpleasant for you to have served under him."</p>

<p>"It is strange how a thing never ends," said Shafter.</p>

<p>Moylan stepped to the porch of a barrack at the south end of
the parade; a first sergeant sat there with a pipe in his mouth;
he came to his feet and snatched the pipe from his mouth.
"Hines," said Moylan, "this recruit is assigned to A. Take care
of him."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the sergeant. Moylan swung off, going at a
steady, fast pace down the walk, into the gathering twilight. The
first sergeant gave Shafter a considerable stare. "What's your
name?"</p>

<p>"Shafter."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Shafter, come with me," said Hines.</p>

<p>The barracks was a building thirty feet wide and better than a
hundred long, with peeled logs standing upright as supports and a
floor of rammed earth. A continuous row of double-decked bunks
ran down the walls. At the foot of each bunk was a small locker
for each man's effects and a rack for sabers and gear and
carbines and other equipment. At the far end of the building was
a little office over the door of which was a painted sign,
Orderly Room. A door led back into what seemed a mess hall.
Meanwhile the sergeant strode along the bunk row, past men
already asleep, past men lying awake on their blankets, past a
table where men sat at a poker game and looked up at Shafter with
an indifferent interest. The first sergeant stopped at a bunk.
"This," he said, "is yours. Do I have to teach you to ride and
handle a gun and mind your orders or&mdash;" and he studied
Shafter with a closer eye&mdash;"is it that you've had service
before?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Cavalry?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Alcott," called Hines, and drew another sergeant across the
room with a waggle of his hand. "Take this man&mdash;Shafter's
his name&mdash;and give him an outfit."</p>

<p>"Come along," said Alcott and towed him into a dark little
cubbyhole of a quartermaster's supply room. The sergeant did a
moment's measuring on Shafter with his eyes, then turned to his
shelves and began to toss pieces of uniform over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Shafter emerged with an outfit stacked
from his outspread arms to his chin&mdash;underwear, socks, field
boots and garrison shoes, blue pants and blue blouse and two blue
wool shirts, campaign hat, forage cap and dress helmet with
plume, saber and saber sling, carbine with its sling, Colt
revolver, Springfield carbine, ammunition, cartridge belt,
canteen, mess outfit, intrenching tools, saddle bags, housewife
kit, bridle, lariat and hobbles and picket pin, a razor, a
silvered mirror, a cake of soap, a comb, two blankets, a straw
tick, a box of shoe polish and a dauber, an overcoat, a rubber
poncho with a hole through its center, a pair of wool gloves, a
bacon can, currycomb and brush, and a pair of collar ornaments
with cross-saber, the regimental number 7 above and the troop
letter A below.</p>

<p>He laid these things on his bunk, took up his tick and left
the room, headed for the stables. A hard-packed area lay between
them and the rear of the barrack hall, used for troop assembly;
beyond the stables stood the edge of the bluff which dropped to
the Missouri now blackly running on into the night with a soft
rustle of its silted waters. Beyond the river winked the lights
of the Point and over the water at this moment slid the
<i>Union</i> with a panting <i>chow</i>&mdash;<i>chow</i> of its
engines. Shafter found the straw stack and knelt to fill his
tick; he heard the casual stamping of the horses and smelled the
rankness of horses&mdash;and the night came blackly down upon him
and from afar drifted the rolling tune of the band, made
beautiful by the distance, by the night, by the shining of the
stars. When he had finished his chore he returned to the barrack
hall, laid the tick on the bunk and made his bed. He took off his
civilian suit and pulled on the army pants and shirt; he rolled
up his civilian clothes and stood a moment looking at them, and
had his long, backward thoughts. He turned around, speaking down
the barrack hall.</p>

<p>"Anybody getting a discharge soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said a trooper, and sat up from his bunk. "I'm leavin'
next week."</p>

<p>"How big are you?"</p>

<p>"Five-ten, one hundred and sixty."</p>

<p>Shafter rolled the suit into a ball and threw it at the man on
the bunk. "The tailor can pull in the trouser legs and cinch up
the coat. It's yours. When you get to New York, walk into the
Netherlands House, and tell the headwaiter who wore those clothes
last. You'll get a free meal out of it."</p>

<p>The guardhouse trumpet drew the slow notes of tattoo across
the silence of the night, softly and beautifully. Shafter got a
cigar from his luggage on the cot. He lighted it and strolled in
his stocking feet to the barrack porch. Across the thousand-foot
parade ground the lights of Officers' Row were pleasantly shining
and somewhere about the fort the regimental band still was
playing dance music. Out from Number One Post at the guardhouse
came the sentry's call: "Nine o'clock&mdash;all's well," and the
call was picked up, post by post, until it ran all around the
fort. He thrust his hands into the pockets of the pants, feeling
the roughness of them; they had the smell of the storehouse on
them and they were stiff. But they covered him and they brought
back to him recollections of the years gone, and all those
recollections were satisfying. It was like coming home; nothing
was strange. The voices of the men within the barrack, the sight
of the carbines racked together, the sabers hanging at the foot
of the bunks&mdash;all this was familiar. It was a way of living
which, once surrendered, he now embraced again.</p>

<p>The darkness was a complete, moonless dark. Beyond Officers'
Row lay the low, curved silhouette of the western ridge, over
which a soft wind came with its scent of winter, with its scent
of farther wildness. Out there, far out, lay a country as
mysterious as the heart of Africa. Across it, during the past ten
years, occasional military expeditions had traveled, had fought,
had won and lost&mdash;but never had penetrated the core of it.
That was Sioux land, the last refuge of a race which had given
ground before the promises, the threats and the treacheries of
the white man's frontier; and now had vowed to retreat no
farther. Out there Sioux tepees made their rows and clusters
along the Powder, the Yellowstone, the Tongue and the Rosebud;
and along a stream which the Indians called the Greasy Grass but
which was known to white men as the Little Bighorn.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE RITUAL OF
ACCEPTANCE</h2>

<p class="first">"ABBOTT!"</p>

<p>"Yo!"</p>

<p>"Allen!"</p>

<p>"Yo!"</p>

<p>"Benzen!"</p>

<p>"Here!"</p>

<p>This was at five-thirty in the morning, the company assembled
unarmed and dismounted behind its barrack to answer roll call. A
mist lay hard upon the Missouri, hiding the water, but holding in
suspension all the river's rich, dank and racy smells, and day's
first light pressed down upon the mist from above. The troop
stood glumly double-ranked in the chill air. The sergeant's nose
was a reddening thermometer of both his temperature and his
disposition. Upon completion of roll call, he made an about-face
and rendered his slowly precise salute to the sharp-visaged young
second lieutenant waiting by.</p>

<p>"Present or accounted for, sir."</p>

<p>The lieutenant acknowledged the salute and thus, having
fulfilled regulations, walked away. Hines turned back upon the
troop, morning-sour and professionally cranky. "I never saw a
filthier yard, nor a dirtier barrack. After breakfast you'll all
turn out for police on it. Mind me, you have been doin' too much
soldierin' on your bunks. Corp'ril King and squad, wood detail.
Costain, duty at the orderly room, Melish, Duker and Straub,
kitchen. Sergeant McDermott, Corp'ril Roy, Privates Bean,
Ryneerson, Hoch and Muldoon, guard duty tonight." He thought a
moment and thereafter opened his roster book again. "By order of
this date, Private Shafter appointed sergeant. Dismiss."</p>

<p>The heavy smell of coffee came reeking out of the mess-hall
wing as they broke up and ran back to barrack. Air down the
parade sounded the brisk mess call. Day broke through the mist,
sparkling against the dew-beaded grass. Shafter got his mess
outfit from his bunk, crossed to the hall, and joined the forming
line. A private with a vein-netted face and a pair of flushed
eyes overhung with a solid lacework of stiff black brows came up
behind him, growling. "A sergeant," he said, "does nawt eat with
us common ones. You belong at the head o' the line."</p>

<p>"I'll wait until I sew the stripes on," said Shafter and gave
this new one a thoughtful appraisal. The man had muscular
shoulders; he was full of bone and meat, but his belly was round
and liquor had softened him. On his sleeve was a faded spot
where, not long before, sergeant stripes had been.</p>

<p>"The rank came easy, did it not?" said the man, accenting his
insolence.</p>

<p>"As easy as yours went away," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"I worked for mine," said the man. "Four years. I licked
nobody's boots for 'em. I gave 'em up because it was me own
wish."</p>

<p>"So that you could breathe freer into a whisky bottle," said
Shafter.</p>

<p>"You've got a tongue, I do observe," said the man. He lifted
his voice a little and half the line of men heard this. "To be a
sergeant is not a matter of tongue in this outfit, bucky. It is a
matter of knuckles. Do you know what I think? I think you'll not
last long."</p>

<p>The line moved up, passing before the cook's table where a
pair of troopers served out breakfast from kitchen kettles.
Shafter got his oatmeal, his bacon and biscuits and held out his
cup for coffee. The trooper handling the pot let his hand waver a
little so that the coffee spilled over, scalding Shafter's hand;
and then the trooper gave him a blank stare. Shafter looked back
at him, a little light dawning gray-bright in his eyes, and
passed on to a long table. That was the way it would be in this
troop; he was untested, and suddenly a sergeant&mdash;made so by
Captain Moylan out of memory of incidents long ago. Moylan must
have known that he put his new sergeant in a hard position.</p>

<p>Hines passed by and dropped a brusque word. "Come to the
orderly room."</p>

<p>In a little while Shafter followed him into the small room at
the end of the barracks. Hines was at his desk. He said, "Shut
the damned' door," and waited until it was done. "I'm too old a
man to remark upon my company commander's choices. You've been in
the army before?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Moylan knew you somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Let's let that slide," said Shafter.</p>

<p>Hines was displeased, and his stare was like the slap of his
heavy hand. "It is his choice to make, but it is me that has to
keep the company runnin' like a company should run. There is
somethin' here which the company will not like, and I cannot put
my hand upon any man to stop him from givin' you the roll of his
eye. I will not have this outfit go sour because of the
advancement of a rooky to sergeant. So, then, you must lick
somebody to show what you've got. It will be the one that was
sergeant and got broke for tryin' to lap up all the whisky in
Bismarck. That's Donovan."</p>

<p>Shafter remembered the meaty one with the round belly. "He's
opened the door already."</p>

<p>"See that you walk right through that door," said Hines. "You
must give him a hell of a beating, or you'll never draw any water
in this outfit as a noncom. If he should give you the
beatin'&mdash;and it is my bet that he'll do just
that&mdash;there is but one thing for you to do. You will turn in
your stripes."</p>

<p>Shafter stood easy in front of the first sergeant, smiling a
little. "You have got a fine collection of savages for a company,
Sergeant. I shall tame one of them for you."</p>

<p>"So," said Hines and was not impressed. Four hash-marks on his
sleeve testified his service; in the rounds of his eyes lay an
iron, taciturn wisdom. The army had made and shaped him until he
was all that the army stood for, a solid, short-tempered and
thoroughly valuable man. "You talk like a damned gentleman. Get
your stripes sewed on. At stable call you will be assigned a
horse. Afternoon you will hitch up the light wagon and go to
Bismarck to do errands for the captain and his lady. You will
stay until the train comes in, pick up the first lieutenant of
this company, who arrives from St. Paul&mdash;the Lieutenant
Smith."</p>

<p>"Who is the officer that took roll call this morning?"</p>

<p>"That one is Varnum. He has some knowledge of Indians, which
God knows we'll need when they break out again next spring."</p>

<p>Stable call came sharp upon the parade ground, pulling Shafter
from the orderly room. The fog had lifted and bright sunshine
slanted out of the east; he was assigned his horse, and his
stall, and spent time grooming the horse. Sick call came, and
first call for drill; at nine o'clock the sharp-faced Lieutenant
Varnum took the company out upon the parade. Heat lay like a
thinned film in the windless air, only suggesting what it had
been a few short months before, but the fine dust rose beneath
the hoots of the turning horses as the five companies, each on a
section of the parade, went through their close-order maneuvers,
wheeling in column, fours left, fours right, left into line,
walk, trot, gallop; the horses, old in the business,
automatically responding, crowding upon each other, grunting,
precisely coming about. At eleven-thirty recall sounded; and mess
call came at noon. Afterwards, Shafter hitched up the light wagon
to a pair of horses and, with a shopping list from Mrs. Moylan in
his pocket, drove through Lincoln's guard gate&mdash;past the
post gardens and hospital and band quarters, past the barracks of
the regimental noncommissioned staff, past bakery and officers'
club and civilian quarters and post trader's store&mdash;and so
came to the ferry.</p>

<p>Over the river, he drove through the Point which lay exhausted
after its night's excesses, and followed the straggling road into
Bismarck. As soon as he arrived there he did the shopping for
Mrs. Moylan; after that he hunted up a tailor and sat in his
underclothes for an hour, reading an old copy of the <i>New York
Tribune</i> while the tailor cut his uniform to better size,
sewed on the sergeant's chevrons and the yellow noncom strip down
each trouser leg.</p>

<p>He still had an hour to spend before train time; and walked
the length of Bismarck's street, the sun's warmth going through
his heavy blue blouse and bringing out its woolly smell; he
turned and strolled back and, in front of the town's big grocery
store, he came upon Josephine Russell. She halted at once,
showing surprise; she tipped her head as she studied him.</p>

<p>"So that is why you came west?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She said: "I think you've worn the uniform before. I thought
that when I saw you standing in front of the depot at
Corapolis."</p>

<p>She carried a basket of groceries, and she had a roll of
checked red-and-white oilcloth under her arm. Shafter relieved
her of these bundles. "Where can I carry these for you?"</p>

<p>"You're on duty, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Waiting for the train to come in."</p>

<p>They moved down the street, side by side. She wore a light
dress, and she had no hat, and she seemed fairer to him than
before; her gray eyes were calm and pleased in the way they
looked at him. Her lips held their steady hint of a smile.</p>

<p>"It's good to see you," he said.</p>

<p>She gave him a quick side glance, slightly speculative, her
eyes gently narrowing. Her lips made a softly pursed line and
afterwards she walked on in silence, looking before her. This day
the town was crowded. Half a dozen punchers came up the walk,
shoulder to shoulder, thrown slightly forward by the high heels
of their riding boots&mdash;all sharp-eyed, roughly dressed men,
and all keenly alive. They broke aside to let Josephine pass, and
eyed her with surreptitious admiration. Indians sat against a
stable wall, dourly indifferent. Up from a warehouse at the lower
end of town moved a caravan of ox-drawn wagons crowded to the
canvas tops with freight, headed outward from the railroad into
that southward distance which ran three hundred miles to Yankton
without the break of a town or settlement, except for the dreary
little army posts or steamboat landings along the Missouri.</p>

<p>A man sat on the steps of a barbershop with a carbine and
calmly shot between the traffic at a target over near the
railroad tracks; and drew up his gun to let Josephine and Shafter
pass by. At the foot of the street Josephine turned the corner of
a feed store and moved back upon the prairie to a house standing
somewhat removed from the town. A picket fence surrounded it, but
otherwise it was without ornament, shade or grass.</p>

<p>Josephine opened the gate and led Shafter to the porch, there
relieving him of the packages. She dropped them inside the house
door and turned back. "If you must wait somewhere, it might be
just as comfortable waiting here. Sit down."</p>

<p>There were a chair and a rocker on the porch, both made of
merchandise packing boxes. Josephine took the chair and Shafter
settled himself in the rocker and let his long legs sprawl before
him. The gesture brought an instant smile and comment from the
girl. "You have a wonderful gift of just going loose all over
whenever you can."</p>

<p>"I got that from the army. A man learns, when he's on long
marches, to make the short stops count."</p>

<p>"The uniform changes you entirely. My first judgment of you
was a great deal different." Her glance turned thoughtful. "In
civilian clothes you seemed a somewhat skeptical man, perhaps
accustomed to the good things of life."</p>

<p>He showed some embarrassment at the remark. He said: "I guess
that's true."</p>

<p>She realized she had struck something in him which was
vulnerable; he had a sensitive spot, and she was sorry she had
touched it and changed the subject. "You were lucky to get a
uniform that fitted you."</p>

<p>"I had the tailor work on it," he said. "Well, whatever I was,
I still am. You can't change a man by clothes. But I have wanted
to get back into the uniform for ten years. I remembered that
when I was a soldier last time I had about as much complete peace
of mind, as much personal contentment, as I ever had. That's why
I came back. I do not require much comfort and I do not need many
possessions. What I need, I guess, is to be with plain and honest
men."</p>

<p>"Men can be plain and honest outside the army."</p>

<p>"Then," he said, "it must be something else the uniform has
that I have needed. At any rate, I feel at home, which is
something I have not felt for a long time."</p>

<p>"Adventure?" she murmured. "The sound of bugles?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I went through four years of the Civil
War. I heard a lot of bugles blowing for the charge. I saw a lot
of men fall, a lot of good friends die. That's the other side of
adventure. I am no longer a young man dreaming of gallantry in
action."</p>

<p>She bent a little in the chair, smiling and curious. "You make
yourself a greater puzzle to me, Sergeant." Then she rose and
went into the house. He reached into his blouse for a cigar, and
lighted it and relaxed wholly in the rocker. The afternoon was
warm, all of summer's scorch gone out of it. The deep haze of
summer, this far west, had lightened, so that the prairie was a
tawny-floor, running immeasurably away into the distance. The
railroad line marched eastward, marked by the single row of
telegraph poles; and in that direction was the smudge of the
afternoon train coming on. Josephine Russell came back with a
tall glass of milk and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"How long have you lived out here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Two years. We have always been moving up on the edge of the
frontier. I suppose in two or three years more we'll be out there
in Montana somewhere. My father has that store&mdash;where you
saw me. But he is restless, and more so since my mother
died."</p>

<p>"You like it here?"</p>

<p>"I like whatever place I am." A more sober expression came to
her face. "It was nice to visit the East, though. I don't know
when I shall see it again."</p>

<p>The train flung its long warning whistle forward from the
distance, reminding Shafter of his duty. He rose with reluctance
and stood easy-balanced on his feet, looking down at her with his
expression of personal interest, and he repeated what he had said
earlier: "It is good to see you again."</p>

<p>"The post can be a very lonely place. Are you sure it won't
bore you?"</p>

<p>"I don't need much in the way of distraction."</p>

<p>She said: "This house is open, if you feel like visiting."</p>

<p>He nodded, he said: "I shall do that," and walked back toward
town. She watched him go, his shoulders cut against the sunlight,
his long frame swinging. She had known, as soon as she saw him in
uniform, that the sergeant's stripes did not represent what he
once had been. Somewhere in the past he had been a man with a
career, had met disaster, and had stepped away from the wreckage
with a shrug of his shoulder. She had guessed that much about him
two days before, and was more certain of it now. There was, she
thought, a woman somewhere involved. Reluctantly she lifted her
guard against him. "I should not," she murmured, "be very much
interested in him," and continued to watch him until he swung
around the corner of a building and disappeared.</p>

<p>Shafter drove the small wagon to the station and arrived just
as the train did. He watched the passengers come out, saw only
one army officer, and walked toward him. Lieutenant Algernon
Smith was a dark, chunky-shouldered man with a bushy black
cavalry mustache, heavy black brows, a solid chin and sharp eyes.
He took Shafter's salute.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Shafter, sir. I am to drive you to the post."</p>

<p>The lieutenant said. "You're new?"</p>

<p>"I enlisted yesterday, sir."</p>

<p>"Rapid promotion," said the lieutenant enigmatically and
nothing more. He had a small portmanteau which he flung into the
wagon when he reached it, and stepped up to the seat, folding his
arms across his chest like an artilleryman riding a caisson.
Shafter ran the team out of town and down the rutty road. Past
the Point he saw the ferry ready to cast off, whereupon he
whipped the team into a dead run down the incline and put it
aboard with a sudden shock of brakes. Lieutenant Smith grabbed
the edge of the seat to prevent falling out, and gave Shafter the
benefit of his dry voice: "I guess you have dash enough for
cavalry service."</p>

<p>Once inside the guard gate, Shafter drove over the parade to
Officers' Row, let off the lieutenant and went on to Captain
Moylan's quarters. He carried the packages to the back door,
delivered them to the captain's striker, and returned the wagon
and team to stables. It was past five o'clock then, afternoon
stable call having occurred while he was gone; therefore he
curried his horse and walked into the barrack. As soon as he
reached his bunk he saw that it had been ripped apart. His box of
cigars, which he had placed beneath the tick, now lay in sight,
its lid open and the cigars gone.</p>

<p>The men of the troop sat around the barrack, waiting mess
call, cleaning up equipment for retreat, or lying back on their
bunks. Donovan, he noticed, was at one of the tables, playing a
game of solitaire. Donovan was smoking a cigar and, to make the
point clearer, Donovan had a row of cigars lying on the table
before him. A scar-mouthed trooper stood by, thinly grinning and
watching Shafter from the evil corners of his eyes. It was a
published thing in the barrack room; everybody knew what was
happening, and waited for the rest of it to happen.</p>

<p>Shafter turned to the table and stood beside it, looking down
on the red surface of Donovan's neck. The ex-sergeant kept on
with his solitaire, aware of Shafter's presence but ignoring it.
He had his feet planted squarely on the floor, beneath the table;
he had his forearms lightly braced on the table's top so that one
warning would bring him roaring up to his feet.</p>

<p>"Donovan," said Shafter, easy and plain, "where do we have
this fight?"</p>

<p>"Behind the stables," said Donovan with equal calmness.
"Tinney, have a cigar. They're good ones, picked by a gentleman
lately come among us to dodge a warrant. I guess we have smoked
the gentleman out." He slapped a hand down on the table so hard
that the cards jumped and he leaned back and shouted out a heavy
laughter at his own joke.</p>

<p>The scar-mouthed trooper grinned and reached for a cigar. He
was not entirely sure of his act, however, and cast a sly glance
at Shafter. He held his hand on the cigar, dividing his attention
between the two men, and for a moment he seemed to debate on
which side of this coming fight the power lay&mdash;and safety
for him. Presently he decided the question in Donovan's favor,
picked up the cigar and turned away. In the background Shafter
saw the other troopers watching, interested and speculative. It
was a break in the dull day, a flash of violence feeding their
hungry appetites.</p>

<p>"I'll be behind the stables after tattoo," said Shafter.
"Better smoke those things up now, Donovan. You'll be sick of
cigars later."</p>

<p>Donovan continued imperturbably with his playing. He said to
the room at large, "Listen to the gentleman's words carefully,
boys. The gentleman is a sergeant. He is an educated sergeant,
sent among us heathens to bring us knowledge."</p>

<p><br>
SUPPER was over and retreat gone by; twilight came,
layer on layer, with its sharpening chill. Along the quadrangle,
lights splashed their yellow lanes out of doorways, poured their
fan-shaped patterns through dusty windows. A patrol, half a
company in strength, came in from the western distance and moved
with jaded temper across the parade, equipment clinking in the
dark. Shafter strolled along the barracks walk with his cigar,
hearing the talk of men come out in drawling eddies, in sudden
bursts of laughter, in sharpness, in murmuring. A guard detail
tramped briskly by, an officer crossed the parade at full-out
gallop; and somewhere a deep voice yelled: "Flynn&mdash;hey,
Flynn!"</p>

<p>The stars were up, turned brilliant by the cold air, and for a
moment Shafter stopped to watch them. Other troopers moved by
him, some with idleness and some hurrying to reach the ferry and
the gaudy dens beyond the river at the Point. Across the parade.
General Custer's house was filled with light and officers and
their ladies strolled toward it, the quick and gay voices of
these people coming over the long stretch of ground in softened
cadence. He listened a moment to those tones of warmth and he
stood still with his eyes half closed, and then swung on with the
idle current of troopers, moving past the guard gate toward the
post trader's store.</p>

<p>He turned about before he reached it, remembering that he had
a date with Donovan after tattoo, and he paced back through the
outthrown lights of the guardhouse, indifferently noticing an
officer appear from the guardhouse, and swung toward Officer's
Row at a quick and nervous pace. Twenty feet onward, he heard the
officer's stride cease and he heard the officer call at
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold up there."</p>

<p>He had not seen the officer's face, but a ruffling chill ran
along his back and a strange tight spasm went through his belly
as he swung. The officer stood waiting twenty feet away, his face
obscured by the shadows; and then the officer murmured in a long,
odd voice: "Come here, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Shafter moved up, watching the other man's face take on shape
and form&mdash;and identity. When he was ten feet removed, he
discovered whom he faced and a feeling greater than any feeling
he had known for years broke through him and shook him from top
to bottom. He came to a stand and remembered he was in uniform,
and made his salute.</p>

<p>The lieutenant did not return the salute. He looked upon
Shafter with a face exceedingly sharpened by astonishment, by the
shock of past memories, by the rousing of old rages and evils. He
had no motion in him at that moment, he had only one thought, and
this escaped him with a slicing-sharp expelling of wind.</p>

<p>"How in God's name did you get here?"</p>

<p>Shafter could think of but one answer, and made it: "It's a
small world, Mr. Garnett. A very small world to a man trying to
escape his conscience."</p>

<p>"Your conscience?" said Lieutenant Edward Christian
Garnett.</p>

<p>"Yours," said Shafter.</p>

<p>The lieutenant stood still and began to curse Shafter with a
softly terrible voice. He pulled up his high shoulders, he
straightened his long body and he used his words as he would have
used a whip, to cut, to disfigure, to destroy. The guard patrol
swung around the corner of the quadrangle and passed close at
hand, stopping the lieutenant's voice for a little while, and in
this silence Shafter saw the man's pale wedge of a face&mdash;so
handsome and tempting a face to women&mdash;show its hard evil,
its unforgiving and brutal blackness. This was Garnett, formed
like an aristocrat out of a French novel, with dark round eyes
well recessed in their sockets, with a head of dark hair that
broke along his forehead in a dashing wave, and a gallant
mustache trimmed above a full, thick-centered mouth. He had the
whitest of teeth; he had a smile, Shafter remembered, which could
charm a woman and capture her without effort. He was a man with
the obsession of conquest&mdash;the conquest of a woman; he had
the predatory instincts of a tiger and no morals, no scruples, no
decencies. He had touched nothing that he had not destroyed, so
that all along his career was the wreckage of his passing. He
was, Shafter bitterly knew, an inner rottenness covered by a
uniform, and cloaked by a kind of gallantry which passed for
courage.</p>

<p>The patrol passed on. Garnett said, sharply: "See to it that
you are not in this fort tomorrow."</p>

<p>"What are you afraid of, Mr. Garnett?"</p>

<p>"Damn you," said Garnett, "speak to me properly."</p>

<p>"Then let us start right. Return the salute I offered you. You
were always a slovenly soldier."</p>

<p>Garnett stared at him. "I could prefer charges against you,
Shafter."</p>

<p>"Do you want to open the record of the past, Mr. Garnett?"
murmured Shafter.</p>

<p>"And how could you open it?" answered Garnett, thinly
malicious. "Your word against mine? Who would take it?"</p>

<p>"Captain Moylan is also here," said Shafter. "As a gentleman,
I suppose he has kept his knowledge of you to himself. How would
you like the ladies of the post to know of the events of your
past? It would interfere with your prowling. I think you will
never prefer charges against me."</p>

<p>Garnett stepped nearer him. "Listen to me. I have got a
hundred ways of getting at you. Believe me, I'll use them all.
I'll break your damned back and I'll break your heart. Before I'm
through with you, you'll crawl over the hill one dark night and
never come back."</p>

<p>"You are a dog, Mr. Garnett," said Shafter.</p>

<p>Garnett lifted a hand and hit him one cracking blow across the
face with his open palm. The effect of it roared through
Shafter's head; he stepped away and then he stepped forward, to
find Garnett backed four paces from him and holding a drawn
revolver on him. "Go ahead," Garnett softly murmured. "You are in
a hard regiment, Shafter, with damned little mercy shown on
insubordination. The colonel would have you shot, as he has had
others shot before you."</p>

<p>Over by the guardhouse, the bugler softly breathed into his
instrument, readying his lips for tattoo. Shafter waited out the
dismal silence, pulling his impulses back into safe place, and
spoke to this man he both despised and hated more than any other
person upon earth. "I did not know you were here," he said.
"Probably I would not have come if I had known it. Still, I'm
here. Here I shall stay. And now that you have used your hands on
me, I'll tell you something: One way or another, I'll destroy
you."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Garnett held the gun on him, watching him with
strict attention. He said, "You may go now, Sergeant."</p>

<p>They were alone in the darkness, thus facing. Shafter thought
of this, knowing that he had the advantage. By daylight he could
not pass the strict line which divided him from Garnett; by
daylight Garnett could make him dance. But there would always be
times when he might catch this man on even terms; for Garnett
would take no chances on his own blemished reputation being
published at this post. So Shafter stood his ground and gave
Garnett a taste of what would come.</p>

<p>"Put up the revolver and turn about and march away. I think
Moylan would relish the opportunity of exposing you."</p>

<p>Garnett cursed him again, in his whispering wicked way. Tattoo
broke over the parade, drowning out the sound of Garnett's voice;
but he watched the lieutenant's lips form their blasphemies and
then close thinly together. The lieutenant bolstered his gun,
swung and went toward Custer's quarters at a long-reaching
pace.</p>

<p>He left behind him a man who, once turned bitter against the
world, had mastered his bitterness; and suddenly now was bitter
again. He left behind him an enemy of dangerous shape, a man
tempered and toughened by a war, knowing its trickeries, its
subterfuges, its brutal modes of combat. All that knowledge
Shafter had subdued and put aside during the ten following years,
but it returned to him as he turned back toward A Company's
barrack with tattoo's last notes falling away in softened,
melancholy loveliness across the parade and across the dark
younder earth. Nine-o'clock call began to run from post to post
as he rounded the barrack and moved through the dark space
between barrack and stable. He cut about the stable and found A
Company's men waiting in the blackness, all ranked along the
river bluff. He saw a shape lift from the earth and heard the
shape say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What kept you? Now where's that lantern?"</p>

<p>It was Donovan speaking. He stood heavy-shouldered in the
dark, stripped to his shirt, with his paunch spilling over the
belt of his trousers. A man moved up and pulled a blanket away
from a lantern, so that its light danced in yellow crystals upon
the night. Donovan clapped his meaty hands together and held them
dropped before him, grinning at Shafter. He was a confident old
hand, facing another routine battle; and the battle was life to
him, so that he gave no thought to hurt or to injury or to scars.
There was no real anger in the man, Shafter understood; Donovan
had only used his sarcasm and his ridicule as a weapon to produce
the fight he needed as much as he needed food. "Take off your
blouse&mdash;take off your shirt. I'll have no advantage. I need
none."</p>

<p>It was a full ten degrees colder than on the previous night,
and a wind played out of the north as an idle warning. Stripping
off blouse and shirt, Shafter studied Donovan's bullet-round
head, the blunt bevel of his shoulders, the softening pads of fat
which lay along his upper arm. The man's coolness, the man's
complete calm warned him; this Donovan had been a professional
somewhere and thought of his opponent as only another green,
awkward one to be pounded down and added to his list. He saw
Donovan winking at the dark shape of the crowd.</p>

<p>"If the gentleman is ready," said Donovan with his ridiculing
tone, "let's be off to the fair."</p>

<p>He waited no longer. He took a striding, squatty plunge
forward, his left fist feinting, his right thundering out.
Shafter came in, caught that right-armed blow on his elbow and
threw it aside. He hit Donovan hard in the belly; he felt his
fist sink into the doughlike fat. He heard Donovan's blast of
expelled wind; he shifted his hips as Donovan tried to ram a knee
into his crotch; he trapped both of Donovan's arms under his
elbows and he rode around a circle as Donovan used his strength
to pull free. He let go, hooked a punch against Donovan's kidney
and moved away.</p>

<p>Donovan shook his head. Donovan's mouth was open, sucking
wind. Donovan's face was rouge red. He gave an impatient cry, his
narrowed eyes showing a crimson, sly fury as they studied
Shafter. He stood still. He stamped the ground with one foot,
shuffled forward and feinted with his body, luring Shafter in. He
dropped his arms, opening himself wide, and rushed forward again
with his head down, growling strange things under his breath; he
was suddenly hard to hit. Shafter tried for the man's belly,
missed, and then, before he could swing clear, he was thrown back
on his heel and knocked to the ground by a savage punch he had
never seen. He rolled and saw Donovan's legs striding forward; he
seized Donovan's foot and turned with it and brought the man
down. The ex-sergeant struck hard, and the fall drew its grunt,
and after that Donovan was a fat ball of fury, reaching and
striking and kicking.</p>

<p>Shafter flung himself away, stood up and watched Donovan rise.
He hit the Irishman, left and right hand, in the belly and
brought Donovan's guard down. He saw his opening, stepped in and
sledged Donovan at the side of the neck. He got two hard blows in
before Donovan reached for him and tied him up. He went loose,
letting Donovan pay out his strength in the struggle.</p>

<p>Donovan cried, "You damned leech, stand out and fight it!" He
used all his muscles and heaved Shafter clear, and raised a hand
to brush his sweaty face. Shafter slid in, driving for the man's
belly, and saw the sick look that came to Donovan's mouth.
Donovan reached for him but Shafter whirled aside, found his
chance, and hit him in the kidney again. The man's softness was
crawling up on him; he had his mouth sprung wide and his eyes
were not clear. Helplessness seemed to come to him, for he shook
his head and let his arms drop. Shafter started in, but feinted
back as Donovan, playing possum, came to life and struck out in
long-reaching left and right blows. He missed and now, off
balance, stumbled forward. Shafter caught him with a short,
up-cutting blow beneath the chin. Donovan sighed; the power went out
of him and he fell slowly and cumbersomely to the dust, his face
striking.</p>

<p>The light bobbed up and down in Tinney's hands. Tinney said,
"For God's sakes Donovan, quit foolin'!" He ran forward and
tickled Donovan with the toe of his boot; he bent nearer and
straightened back, to say in a dull astonishment: "He's out."</p>

<p>"Water bucket," said Shafter.</p>

<p>Somebody went running back to the stable while Tinney
helplessly circled Donovan with the lantern. "Donovan&mdash;hey,
Donovan," he pleaded. Troopers formed a fascinated, silent
circle. Shafter said, "Tinney, how did you like that cigar?" and
watched Tinney's head spring up. Tinney opened his scar-shaped
mouth to speak, found nothing to say and slowly backed off. The
messenger ran in from the stable and flung a full bucket of water
on Donovan's naked torso. The Irishman, half-wakened by it, made
a wild swing and got to his hands and knees. He shook his head
and looked up. He saw Shafter. He ran a hand over his face to
slash the water away. "I got licked?" he said.</p>

<p>"You should quit smoking, Donovan," said Shafter. "Cigars are
bad on the wind."</p>

<p>Donovan pulled himself to his feet. He said, "What fool dumped
the bucket on me? Because a man is on his knees is nothin'." Then
he said curiously, "Was I out?"</p>

<p>"Dead out," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Then I got licked," said Donovan in a practical voice. He
studied Shafter at some length, without resentment. He put out
his hand. "That's the end of it," he said. "I never bear a
grudge."</p>

<p>Shafter took Donovan's hand, whereupon Donovan thought of
something and swung around, pointing a finger at the men of A
Company. "When I'm licked, I'm licked. But don't none of you lads
think you can do better than me. Don't none of you get fresh with
me. I'm still man enough to lick the lot of you. Another
thing&mdash;if you back-talk the professor here, I'll beat your
ears down. You hear?"</p>

<p>He started for the barracks, his head dropped in weariness.
Shafter came up to him and laid an arm on his shoulder, so that
the two went on through the dark. Donovan murmured: "I'll buy the
cigars, bucko. You're all right. If you can lick me, you can wear
the stripes. I'd like to see the man that can take 'em off
you."</p>

<p>"Donovan," said Shafter. "One night soon we'll take a few of
the lads and drop over the river. A little drinking will do no
harm."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Donovan, "you're my kind. But if I'd lay off the
whisky you'd never of had me. Professor, this is a damned good
outfit."</p>

<p>Shafter moved through the barrack room, putting on his shirt
as he walked; he continued on to the porch which confronted the
parade and he stood there and felt the ache of his bruises, the
loosening aftereffect of the fight. But he knew he had ceased to
be an outsider. He had joined the company; he could tell that by
the way the men looked at him. This was why he had
joined&mdash;to be one of a company of men. To be with them and a
part of them; remembering away back, he knew that it was in this
closeness he had been happiest. Maybe it was discipline or maybe
it was service, or maybe it was the feeling of a man as he rode
with other men, joined in the roughness, in the brawling and in
the fighting, in the lust and evil and in the honesty and the
faithfulness that bound them all together. He stood still, coming
close to the reason, but never quite grasping the tangible form
of it. As he searched himself, going down into the strange places
where lived those prime hungers which made him a man, he
remembered what things had been important to him in the past, and
what things he had missed in civilian life. They were little
things, but all of them strong&mdash;the sweat that started out
of his pores and stung his eyes, the heavy dust rising up from a
marching column, the wind against his face when he rode through
some early March morning with the fog lifting out of the lowlands
of the Wilderness; the rain beating hard upon him until the smell
of his uniform was woolly and rank; the pure pleasure that had
come to him when, dried and exhausted, he dropped to his belly
beside a sluggish branch in Virginia and drank the brackish water
until he could hold no more; the evening shadows with the
campfires glittering through them and the sound of tired voices
coming from afar; the stretch of his leg muscles as he lifted in
the saddle for a run; and the wicked satisfaction that came of
taking a blow and giving one; and the comfort of the earth as he
lay against it&mdash;and the calm dark mystery of the heavens as
he looked up to them. Each was a little thing, but each one
fashioned and formed him and fed him and made life full.</p>

<p>A trooper came out of the barrack and stood silently by; he
was a young lad, tall but still not wholly filled out with man's
muscles. He had light hair and a fair face and he smiled in an
engaging way when Shafter looked at him. He was not more than
eighteen. He said wistfully: "I wish I knew how to fight. I mean,
well enough to take care of myself."</p>

<p>"It will come," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Funny thing," said the boy, "I never had a fight."</p>

<p>"It may be you can get through the next forty years without
one," said Shafter. "I hope you do."</p>

<p>"A man's got to fight sometime," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Don't look for one&mdash;don't give it a thought," said
Shafter. "Wait until it comes&mdash;and perhaps it will never
come." He fell silent, noting the boy's puzzled face. What he had
said seemed a contradiction to the lad; and so he quietly added:
"Men are not dogs to be growling at each other."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose so," said the youngster and, still puzzled,
moved down the parade toward the south; in that direction, beyond
the quartermaster quarters, lay Suds Row, which was a line of
houses occupied by married sergeants whose wives were troop
laundresses. He heard the boy whistle a little as he moved into
the darkness.</p>

<p>Shafter returned to his bunk and pulled off his uniform.
Donovan walked out of the washroom, stripped naked. He tapped his
paunch, turned red by the punches Shafter had put there. He was
grinning. "A good fight, bucko." The first sergeant came out of
the orderly room and paused to look at these two.</p>

<p>"What happened to your belly, Donovan?"</p>

<p>"I fell on a picket pin," said Donovan, and grinned again.</p>

<p>Hines said "I'll have to send a detail out to pull up all
these picket pins which the men of this troop keep stumblin'
over." He showed Shafter a sardonic humor and passed on,
grumbling at a group of poker players. "Break up that. Taps is
comin'." He left the barrack and went at an old soldier's steady,
established pace through the dark, along the side of the
quartermaster department and the commissary building; he turned
down Officers' Row and stopped and tapped on the door of Captain
Moylan's house. When the captain came out, he rendered his slow,
grooved salute and said: "He licked Donovan, sir."</p>

<p>"So," said Moylan, and was pleased. "It will be all
right."</p>

<p>"It will be better than I thought," agreed Hines. "Now, can he
soldier?"</p>

<p>"As good as you or I, Hines."</p>

<p>"Let us not be givin' him too much credit," said Hines. "If
the man is half as good as either of us. Captain, he is an
angel."</p>

<p>"You'll see," said Moylan.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; ON OFFICERS' ROW</h2>

<p class="first">LIEUTENANT GARNETT moved rapidly over the parade
toward Officers' Row, preoccupied and scowling, with the shock of
the meeting still affecting him, with fear still a sharp
sensation in him. As he came before General Custer's house, he
paused to pull himself straight, to compose the expression on his
face and to make a few quick jerks at the tail of his coat. Once
more in trim, he crossed the porch with his cap removed and
tucked in the crook of his left arm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Custer met him, touched his elbow and led him forward to
the crowd arranged in groups around the room. She was a demure
woman, quietly charming and with a light and softhearted manner
of meeting people. She said: "I believe you know everybody,
except perhaps our very young and very pretty guest from
Bismarck."</p>

<p>She paused before Josephine Russell, who was seated on the
piano stool. Lieutenant Garnett's back sprung into a tenser arch,
like a race horse waiting the drop of the barrier; his deep-set
and slightly mournful eyes saw the girl's prettiness and the
hunting instinct in him rose and fashioned a flashing smile, and
all the proper gestures of gallantry; he made a show in his
uniform&mdash;the long straight sweep of his trousers with their
broad yellow stripes, the tight brass-buttoned coat above which
lay the white wing collar and black cravat. He had a long wedge
of a face with an olive pallor which no amount of sun changed and
this, against the intense blackness of his wavy hair, made him an
extremely-striking man.</p>

<p>"Josephine," said Mrs. Custer, "let me present Mr. Garnett.
This is Josephine Russell." And then, because Mrs. Custer had a
motherly instinct for the men of the command, and loved to makes
matches, she added with her air of bright and gentle interest,
"Mr. Garnett is so wedded to his profession that I fear he has
never had time for ladies."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Garnett gave Mrs. Custer a quick glance, suspecting
irony; but he saw only a very human pleasure on the face of the
commanding officer's wife and so turned and made his
distinguished bow. "I must warn you. Miss Russell. There are many
bachelors and you will be rushed."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mrs. Custer, "all the eligible bachelors of the
post have rushed her."</p>

<p>"I propose to join their ranks immediately," said Garnett.</p>

<p>Josephine acknowledged the compliment with a smile; she sat
with her hands on her lap, pleasantly reposed. Her hair lay
darkly back on top of her head, exposing the small and dainty
ears with their pearl pendants. She had a soft roundness to her
bosom, and she had a reserve in her eyes; and the shadow of
strength and intensity behind her smiling greatly intrigued the
lieutenant. She said: "The gallantry of the Seventh is well
known, Mr. Garnett."</p>

<p>Mrs. Custer went away and for a little while the lieutenant
tried his best wares on Josephine, idly but deceptively probing
and drawing her out, testing the metal in her, searching for some
entry through her vanity, her weaknesses, her romantic notions or
her pride. He was a clever man and presently when the general's
brother, Captain Tom Custer, came up&mdash;a slim, restless man
with a boyish and daredevil face topped by lank light
hair&mdash;the lieutenant passed on to pay his respects to the
other officers and their ladies. The general was in a corner,
having some sort of tactical discussion with Major Reno and
Captain Weir of D Company and the tawny Yates who was commander
of F. Garnett left that weighty circle to itself, said a few
words to Algernon Smith and Mrs. Smith, joined in with Calhoun
and Edgerly for a moment&mdash;the latter as handsome a man as
himself&mdash;and so, punctiliously leaving his word and his
smile from person to person, he came finally to Major Barrows and
his lady, the major being here on tour of duty from the inspector
general's department.</p>

<p>The major was on the small and lean side, leaf brown and quiet
of face, very soft of voice and with a taciturn cast to his eyes.
A small mustache and imperial gave a tempered sharpness to an
otherwise gentle set of features, and his manner in addressing
Garnett had a kind of formal courtesy. "Good evening, Mr.
Garnett. A pleasant evening."</p>

<p>"Pleasant, but there's a chill in it. Winter's coming."</p>

<p>"Always does," said Major Barrows, inflecting a most
commonplace remark with his dryness.</p>

<p>Garnett, usually extraordinarily attentive to the ladies,
talked on with the major for a full minute or more before turning
his head and looking down at Mrs. Barrows; and then gave her a
smile and a word, nothing more. She looked up at him, a woman
somewhat younger than her husband, still of feature and with only
her eyes showing much expression. She sat back in the chair, her
head rested against it so that her throat revealed its ivory
lines. Her lids dropped and for a moment her lashes touched as
she watched this man&mdash;darkly, indifferently, strangely.</p>

<p>The major divided an inexpressive glance between them and then
thought to say: "You have met, have you not?"</p>

<p>The major's wife smiled slightly. "Of course. Two or three
times."</p>

<p>"My memory for things social has grown rusty," apologized the
major. He sought his coat for a cigar, cast a glance at the
general and his party and made a little bow to be excused, going
over to join that discussion. Garnett thrust his arms across his
chest, matching the depthless inspection of the woman with one of
his own. In the little pocket of her throat he saw her heart
beating and he knew he had stirred her. He had met her at a party
like this only a month before, had smiled at her; he had sat
beside her at Major Tilford's dinner slightly later, studying her
silence and her indifference until he knew what it was. This was
his third meeting and he understood what his method was to be
with her; it was to be dark and somber, with soft words carrying
more in tone than in meaning. The major's wife, he guessed was a
lonely woman with unspent emotions.</p>

<p>"Do you enjoy it here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and continued to watch him out of her
half-closed eyes! It was a challenge to be met and he murmured: "Of
what are you thinking?"</p>

<p>"Many things."</p>

<p>"Have you walked through these shadows, late at night, by
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Often."</p>

<p>"I know what you have felt. I know what you have thought," he
said.</p>

<p>"Do you?" she asked. Her eyes grew wider and a slight warmth
escaped her control and showed on her lips. He watched her
suppress it, he heard practicalness return to her voice: "You are
gallant, Mr. Garnett."</p>

<p>He had interested her but, like a wise campaigner, he did not
overdo his pressing; he nodded and turned back to join Calhoun
and Edgerly who stood before Josephine. Presently the talk of the
older officers interested him and he drifted that way. Weir was
speaking:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is absurd to suppose that the Sioux, having had their best
country in the Black Hills opened up to the white miner, will not
brood upon it. We have respected no treaty we ever made with
them. They know we never will. What good is a treaty, solemnly
made in Washington, when a month later five hundred white men
cross the deadline? The prospector, the emigrant and the squatter
have a hunger for gold and land that we cannot stop by treaty. We
have spent two years trying to run the whites out of country
which we have promised shall be the Indian's. It is an impossible
job. The Indian knows we will continue to back him westward until
we have pushed him into the ocean. All the Sioux leaders see it.
They will make a stand. Of course there will be a campaign next
year."</p>

<p>"If so," said Custer, "we shall decisively defeat them."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Weir, "I were as optimistic. All this summer
the traders have been freighting repeating rifles up the
Missouri, trading for fur. Winchesters and Henrys. They are
better arms in many ways than ours. Did I tell you that last week
when I took out my company for target practice one third of all
our carbines jammed after the fifth shot?"</p>

<p>"Tell your recruits to keep the breech mechanism clean."</p>

<p>"That is not the trouble. These cartridges have got a lot of
soft base metal in them. The cartridge expands quickly and sticks
in the breech. The extractor tears through the rim of the
shell&mdash;and there's a gun you've got to hack at with a pocket
knife."</p>

<p>"Major," said Custer to Barrows, "I wish you'd stress things
like that in your report to the department. I have written so
many critical letters that I'm regarded as a dangerous and
undisciplined officer. I am heartsick at the things I see which I
cannot improve. Things which lead a very slimy trail right back
to Washington."</p>

<p>Mrs. Custer overheard him and gave him a wifely side glance.
But the general, impetuous in any kind of attack, used his words
as he would have used a saber. "The post-trader situation is
rotten. It is corrupt, it is venal. The prices charged by the
post trader here are outrageous. Do you know what his excuse is?
It is that his expenses in getting the job were so enormous that
he must recoup himself. Why were they enormous? Because there are
gentlemen in Washington who sell these post-traderships to the
highest bidder. How can such a situation exist? Because there
exists a corrupt ring in Washington, so protected by extremely
high-placed officials that they cannot be touched."</p>

<p>The group of officers appeared mildly embarrassed. Major
Barrows cast his reserved, taciturn glance at the general. "That
is a risky thing for an army officer to say, Custer."</p>

<p>"I don't give a continental," said the general. "I personally
know of a brother of one official&mdash;one of the highest in our
land&mdash;" he checked himself, looked about the group with his
bony, flushed face, and plunged on&mdash;"in fact the brother of
the very highest public official of our land, who is receiving
financial reward for using his indirect influence in assisting
civilians to receive these post-traderships from the Department
of Interior."</p>

<p>"Custer," said Major Barrows, "no army officer who wishes for
a successful career can afford to question civil authority in
Washington."</p>

<p>"I shall be in Washington soon," said Custer. "I shall mention
the evil as I see it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Custer moved forward and lightly laid her hand on her
husband's arm. "You must not ignore the rest of your guests," she
said, smiling the dangerous subject away.</p>

<p>Custer immediately grew gentle at her touch. His sharp blue
eyes sent a dancing glance around the room and saw his brother,
Captain Tom Custer, seated alone in a rear corner of the room,
hands over his stomach as he caught a bit of sleep.</p>

<p>"All right, Libby," he told his wife, "I'll be
mealy-mouthed."
But his eyes returned to the figure of Tom Custer and an edged
grin formed beneath the tawny fall of his mustache; he made a
signal at Lieutenant Edgerly, who came immediately near. He
whispered something in Edgerly's ear. The lieutenant left the
room at once.</p>

<p>Major Barrows said: "How certain are you of a spring
campaign?"</p>

<p>"Wholly certain," said Captain Weir. "Nothing will stop the
Sioux from defending their ground, if we push at them."</p>

<p>"How do you know you'll get orders to push at them?" asked
Barrows.</p>

<p>Garnett had meanwhile drifted away and now was again in the
corner with Mrs. Barrows. The major slightly changed his stand so
that he saw them without turning his head greatly; he watched
them as they talked, he watched his wife's face.</p>

<p>Weir said: "People on the frontier want to move west. They see
the Indians barring their way. So they shoot a few Indians and
then the Indians shoot them.</p>

<p>"That creates an incident. People here then cry to Congress
and Congress puts pressure upon the War Department. We shall be
sent out."</p>

<p>Major Reno had not spoken thus far. He was a stocky, rumpled
figure, round and sallow of face with black hair pressed down
upon his head and a pair of round recessed eyes, darkly circled.
He seemed not wholly a part of the group; he seemed outside of
it. But he said now: "It will not be a summer's jaunt. We shall
face formidable resistance."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw," said Custer. "I know Indians. They will see us,
and break. The question will not be one of fighting them. The
question will be can we reach them soon enough to surround them
before they break into little bands and disappear. I can take
this regiment and handle the situation entirely."</p>

<p>"Your regiment," said Barrows, "has an average muster of
sixty-four men per company. Full strength, you might take eight
hundred men into the field. A third of those are apt to be
recruits. It is not an extraordinary show of strength."</p>

<p>The general said, with his dogmatic certainty: "The Seventh
can whip any collection of Indians on the plains," and turned to
meet Edgerly, who had returned with a hank of clothesline. The
general looked at his brother Tom, still snoozing in the chair,
and chuckled as he took the line. He walked along the edge of the
wall; he got down on his hands and knees and crept forward until
he was behind Tom Custer's chair. Crouched there, he looped the
clothesline around Tom Custer's boot at the instep, made a slip
knot and softly drew it tight; then he crawled to a rear window,
standing open to the night, and made the other end of the
clothesline fast to the window's latch.</p>

<p>Edgerly had meanwhile brought in the guard trumpeter. The
general tiptoed to the front of the room and whispered to the
trumpeter; he went around to the other officers and softly spoke
to them&mdash;with Majors Reno and Barrows alone standing
indifferent and puzzled in the group. Edgerly closed the front
door and the trumpeter retreated into the general's study. The
rest of the officers had risen and were waiting Custer's
signal.</p>

<p>Suddenly he cut his hand sharply down through the air, the
trumpeter blasted boots and saddles into the room and the
officers began to rush pell-mell for the door, shouting: "Sioux!
Edgerly, get to your troop! They're attacking the back side! My
God, they're coming down the hill by the hundreds!"</p>

<p>Custer yelled, "Where's my hat? Reno, take the first troops
assembled&mdash;Weir&mdash;" Somebody yanked open the front door
and rushed out, shouting back: "Hurry up!" and hard after that a
gun cracked through the night.</p>

<p>Tom Custer came up from his chair in one bound, roused out of
his peaceful catnap. Reacting with an old soldier's pure impulse,
he made a headlong rush for the door. Three steps took him to the
end of the clothesline, which snapped tight and cut his legs from
beneath him. He fell in one flat, long-bodied crash, face flat on
the floor.</p>

<p>Everybody yelled in terrific delight and even Reno permitted
himself a smile. General Custer staggered to the nearest wall and
laid himself against it, laughing so uncontrollably that tears
rolled along his face. Mrs. Custer, in all this pandemonium,
stood still and smiled her gentle smile while Tom Custer, the
holder of two Congressional medals of honor, sat up in the middle
of the floor and unhooked the clothesline from his boot. He shook
his head, staring at all the convulsed shapes around him; he
pointed a finger at the general and shook his head, and began to
grin. "That was a frivolous kind of amusement. I damned near
shook out my teeth."</p>

<p>The general drew a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped away
his ribald tears. Major Barrows looked at his wife, who rose; and
the two made their expressions of pleasure and departed. Edgerly
brought around a rig for Josephine. Gradually the rest of the
visitors said good night and went away until the general and his
wife were alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Custer moved upstairs, leaving the general to a restless
back-and-forth pacing. He had his hands clasped behind him and
now and then stopped to rearrange some object on the table, to
change the location of a chair, to lift or lower one of the
frayed window shades; and then resumed his nervous traveling.
Presently he passed through the doorless arch into a room whose
walls were crowded with animal heads, guns and Indian relics. Two
large pictures looked down upon his desk; one was of
McClellan&mdash;to whom he gave a loyalty he seldom gave any
other man&mdash;and one was of himself in his flamboyant uniform.
He sat down and picked up a pen, and sighed his dislike for the
chore before him. But physical energy nagged at him and so in a
moment he resumed the article he was writing on frontier life for
an eastern magazine, sending the pen across the page in a rapid
plunging scrawl.</p>

<p>He worked for an hour, tense and aggressive in this thing as
he was in all things and abruptly stopped and sat back, listening
to the faint scratches of sound coming through the lonely house.
Taps blew and the guard call went around. He fidgeted in the
chair and lifted his voice: "Libby!"</p>

<p>She descended the stairs, wrapped in an old blue robe, her
hair done back for the night and her eyes sleepy.</p>

<p>"Libby," he said, "how can I write if you're not around?"</p>

<p>She smiled at him and settled in a chair, all curled in it,
and watched him as he read what he had written; she watched his
face, her eyes soft and affectionate, and when he had finished
she said: "That's very good, Autie."</p>

<p>"Is it?" he asked, like a small boy, anxious for praise. "Is
it any good?"</p>

<p>"Nothing you put your hand to is not good."</p>

<p>"Then," he said, "I shall send it, though the Lord knows why
they should want to pay me two hundred dollars for it. It will
help out on our next trip east, old lady."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, absent-mindedly. Her thoughts were elsewhere;
they revealed a half fear on her face. "Autie&mdash;all this talk
of a campaign next summer&mdash;do you think it will come?"</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>"Then I hope winter never passes," she said, suddenly
intense.</p>

<p>"Libby," he said, "you were a little cool toward Reno
tonight."</p>

<p>"It is not in my heart to be nice to anybody who is not your
friend."</p>

<p>"Still, he's an officer of this regiment. We must show no
favorites. We must be the same to all."</p>

<p>"I'll try," she murmured.</p>

<p>He smiled at her and rose and went around to her. He lifted
her out of the chair and carried her around the rooms, her small
protests coming against his chest: "Autie&mdash;let me down.
Autie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blow out the lamps," he said, and lowered her by the tables
while she blew; and in the darkness he carried her up the stairs.
"Autie," she murmured, "I'm too old a woman for such romantic
foolishness."</p>

<p>"You are a child," said he.</p>

<p><br>
MAJOR BARROWS moved slowly down the walk with his
wife, silent as he usually was, preoccupied by his own
reflections. Margaret Barrows did not disturb them for she was
engaged in thoughts of her own, and so the two reached the house
assigned to them. The major lighted the lamp and stood a moment
by it, his taciturn eyes observing the willow shape of his wife
as she moved about the room, the luminous gravity of her face,
the shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Pleasant evening," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Custer was indiscreet. He always is. Nothing saves him but a
reputation for dash. That will not save him forever, unless he
grows humbler than he is now."</p>

<p>She moved toward him and watched him with that strange
expression which always deeply disturbed him; for he was not a
stupid man and he knew the depths of his wife's nature, and
struggled in his own way to satisfy the rich, racy current of
vitality within her. But the stiffness of his nature was a hard
thing to change, so that he knew he could not satisfy the
romantic side of her character. It troubled him that she stood
here now and wanted only some little display of ordinary
affection, some word that would please her; and the best he could
contrive was a stolid, "I think I'll finish my smoke on the
porch. You're a beautiful woman, Margaret. I was conscious of
that tonight." He bent forward and kissed her and straightened.
She stood a moment longer, permitting him to see the iron control
come to her again, and he knew he had failed. She said: "Good
night," and went into the bedroom.</p>

<p>The major walked to the porch and sat down, hooking his feet
to the rail; there to brood over the fragrance of his cigar.
Lieutenant Smith and his wife strolled past, on the way to their
own quarters. Mrs. Smith's musical voice came to him. "Good
night, Major."</p>

<p>He said, "Good night," and watched the two move through the
shadows. They were a well-matched couple, a very gay and
companionable woman and a very handsome man; after several years
of married life they were still close to each other. Some
marriages were like that, he thought, in which the dispositions,
the tastes and hungers of two people were so perfectly matched
that the union was indestructible. It was an uncommon thing, and
a beautiful thing to see, and it made him keenly feel his own
failure. Life was mostly humdrum, drudgery and tedious hours
stretched end on end; for him that was well enough but for his
wife it was a kind of suffocation against which she fought. She
needed brightness and drama and moments when her cry for beauty
would be answered. He thought: "If I could play the gallant part,
if I could go to her as a swashbuckling man and sweep her up and
arouse her and stir her all through&mdash;" But he shook his
head, knowing he was not that kind of man; even if he tried to
play the part it would not come off. Some men were born for one
thing, some for another. As he sat there thinking of this and
knowing his wife's terrible need for some kind of release, he
felt a tragic unhappiness for her.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Smith and his wife moved into their quarters and
made ready for bed. Smith said: "That was strong meat Custer was
serving up&mdash;that talk about graft and scandal. All true,
every word of it, but he's on dangerous ground talking about
it."</p>

<p>"He loves dangerous ground," said his wife. She sat on a chair
scarred by repeated ownerships and changes of station, before a
bureau made of scrap lumber by some trooper of the command. There
was a mirror one foot square on the wall and into this she looked
as she took down her hair. It was another threadbare room to
match all the threadbare rooms along Officers' Row, with a dull
neutral wallpaper pasted against the uneven walls. The floor was
bare boards painted brown and at the windows hung those same
green sun-cracked shades which were to be seen in all the
quarters. One austere army rule covered these habitations: No
house should be better than another house and no family was to
have more comforts than another family. Therefore all quarters
were shabby and mean and without grace, except as the small
pocketbook of the officer could improve them. In the East these
houses would have been tenements belonging near the railroad
track.</p>

<p>"So he does," said Smith. He pulled off his shoes, removed his
shirt, and sat back to enjoy a last fragment of his cigar.</p>

<p>"I never cease to think of that," said Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"All of you&mdash;forty officers and eight hundred
men&mdash;are in the hands of one impulsive commander. When he
courts danger for himself, he courts it for you."</p>

<p>"That's the way of soldiering. You're old enough a campaigner
by now to know it couldn't be otherwise."</p>

<p>"I'm old enough a campaigner to know that no commander has the
right to take risks for the fun of it, or for personal glory, or
for newspaper stories back east, or to show his enemies what a
great soldier he is."</p>

<p>He looked at his wife with some surprise. "How long have you
been thinking these things?"</p>

<p>"A long while."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't harbor them in your head. It's been a long
stretch for you out here in this dreary nowhere. I should have
sent you east last fall."</p>

<p>She looked at him, disturbed yet affectionate. "You know we
couldn't afford it. If we could have, I wouldn't have gone
without you. What fun would that be?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it would have been nearer possible last year
than now."</p>

<p>"Are we broke?"</p>

<p>He grinned, taking it an easy way. "Just more broke than
usual. That last change of station set us back a lot in railroad
fare." He thought about it a long interval, then sighed and said,
"Maybe someday the government will be generous enough to pay for
the transportation of an officer's wife when she follows her
husband from post to post." Then he added, "Not that I'm
complaining. We have had good times. We're healthy. We sleep
well. We have few worries."</p>

<p>"And when you die," said Mrs. Smith with a touch of irony,
"the government will even be generous enough to bury you without
expense."</p>

<p>"Ah, now," he said, and grinned, "you get that out of your
head, old girl."</p>

<p>She was not a woman to complain and not a woman to fret with
him or to add to his worries; yet tonight a good many small
things seemed to collect in her mind and make her restless.</p>

<p>"I heard the general speak of a campaign next spring. Is it
that certain?"</p>

<p>"Looks so. Government has been sending expeditions out there
year after year without results. The Sioux grow more
discontented. The settlers become more insistent on opening the
country. We've been hearing that government intends to order all
Sioux back to their reservations permanently. The Sioux will not
comply. I think we shall see a big campaign, intended to end the
question once and for all."</p>

<p>She sat still, thinking of his words; and her face darkened
and he saw worry he had not seen before. It made him say again,
very regretfully: "I wish I'd sent you back east for a
vacation."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "it isn't that. I can't help thinking of the
general's temper. He would throw this regiment away, all in a
moment of recklessness."</p>

<p>"He would be at the head of it when he threw it," Smith gently
reminded her.</p>

<p>"I believe," she said, "you'd appreciate a campaign full of
fighting."</p>

<p>He gave that a moment's consideration and arrived at his basic
belief in the matter. "After a winter of garrison confinement,
I'm always glad to be riding out. But after a summer of eating
dust I'm always glad to come back. No, I think I prefer easy ways
to hard ones. But that's scarcely the point, is it? The
government has trained me to take the hard ways. We're not in the
hands of Custer, old girl. We're all in the hands of our
country."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and went to bed. Smith finished his
cigar and walked through the house in his nightgown, blowing out
the lights; and came beside his wife. He put his arm around her.
"You're a little blue tonight."</p>

<p>"I wish," she whispered, "I knew what was troubling me. It is
there, but I can't name it. Sometimes it is a lump in my
stomach."</p>

<p>"Maybe we'd better have Porter give you a looking-over."</p>

<p>"You idiot," she said, "you know I'm healthy as a horse," and
moved against him.</p>

<p>After leaving Shafter, the young trooper&mdash;Frank
Lovelace&mdash;walked into the night, his desires setting a
compass course toward Suds Row. He thought of Shafter in youth's
instinctively admiring way. He was greatly impressed by the
sergeant's coolness and quietness under strain and he wistfully
wished that he might have the same kind of qualities. His age
made him dream of great things; and his vivid imagination placed
him in the sergeant's shoes, so that he saw himself equally cool
and brave and triumphant. This was the world he made for himself,
but he was young and therefore he was unsure, not knowing his
capacities and secretly doubting himself.</p>

<p>He turned into Suds Row and passed along the row of small
houses occupied by the married sergeants. He had been walking
rapidly; now he dropped to a slow saunter and began to whistle.
When he passed the house of Mary Mulrane, he gave the lighted
window a swift sidewise glance and saw Mary's father, old Mulrane
who was a sergeant major, bowed over a paper on the table. Young
Lovelace continued his stroll to the end of the row and stood a
moment listening to the Missouri lap at the base of the bluff. He
turned back. Mulrane's door had opened, letting out a bright gush
of light; it closed again and he felt dispirited. But when he
came abreast the house he found Mary waiting.</p>

<p>He turned in and saw her face pale in the shadows; he touched
her with his hand and he drew her smile. He stood still, a wonder
and a wanting rushing through him and setting off the purest and
most violent kind of flame, and he drew a long sigh and thought
of nothing to say. He saw the way she held up her head and he
thought he might kiss her; but he never had kissed her and he
didn't want her to think the wrong thing about him. She waited,
watching him, the smile steady on her face. Presently she came
from the wall and slipped her hand into his hand and walked back
down the row beside him.</p>

<p>He said: "It's cold tonight. Aren't you cold?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm not cold at all."</p>

<p>"I should think you would be."</p>

<p>"It's pretty tonight."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "The darkness just kind of stretches away.
Like it was moving." They came to the edge of the bluff and he
reached down and got a chunk of earth; he threw it and waited,
and long afterwards heard it strike the river. He said: "The
river's always going somewhere. I wish I could get in a row boat
and just drift. Next week, Yankton. Then St. Louis. Then New
Orleans."</p>

<p>She didn't answer him and he felt her somehow draw away from
him. She didn't stir, but she wasn't as near him as she had been.
He could feel it distinctly. Then she said: "Do you want to go
that bad?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "it isn't that. I'd just like to be doing
something. I'd like to see the country."</p>

<p>"The girls in the South," she said, "are supposed to be very
pretty."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of that," he answered at once. "I'd
like&mdash;" But he didn't know what it was. It was something
formless; it pushed at him and it pulled at him, it filled him
up.</p>

<p>"You're funny," she murmured.</p>

<p>He looked at her and saw her smiling again. She was near him,
she was watching him closely. He said: "It's tough to just stand
around when everything is happening everywhere. I've got three
more years to serve. When I get out, what'll I be? Nothing at
all."</p>

<p>She murmured: "I think you're something."</p>

<p>He looked at her, his pulse beating faster. He waited a long
while, on the edge of what he wanted; he felt himself shoved
toward it but he knew he never would take the chance of making
her think he was another easy trooper. She made a little motion
with her head and she looked away from him a moment and took his
hand again, standing still. "I get lonely too, sometimes," she
said, and turned her face toward him. Suddenly a kind of terror
went through him for what he knew he was about to do, but he
couldn't help it. He put one arm around her and saw that she
didn't draw back. Her face was still near him and just below him.
He put both arms around her and kissed her. He was trembling, he
was hot, he was cold. He squeezed her until a sigh came out of
her; he felt the heat and the urgent sweetness of her mouth and
it astonished him to realize she held him as tightly as he held
her. He felt her fingers at the back of his neck.</p>

<p>She stepped away, looked at him a moment; she dropped her head
against his chest and continued to hold him. He heard her
murmur:</p>

<p>"Did you mean that, Frank? It wasn't just something you'd do
to any girl if you got the chance?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he said, shocked.</p>

<p>"I'm glad. I wouldn't let anybody else do it."</p>

<p>They heard Mulrane calling in his thick Irish voice: "Mary,"
and turned to see the sergeant blocked against the light of his
open door. Mary Mulrane softly laughed and seized young
Lovelace's hand and walked up the street with him. Young Lovelace
felt the sergeant's hard eyes on him, and was embarrassed. But
Mary held his hand so that her father could see it.</p>

<p>"Going out like that," said Mulrane, "in a cold night without
a coat. Where is your mind awanderin'?"</p>

<p>"It isn't cold," said Mary.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the sergeant, "it isn't cold, is it?" And he
grunted something under his breath. "You come in. And you,
Lovelace, you had better get back before you're picked up by the
rounds. Taps will be blowin'."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lovelace and started up the street. He had gone a
few feet when he heard Mary murmur something. In another few feet
the sergeant's voice came after him. "Come to Sunday supper,
Lovelace."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Lovelace, and went on. The earth came up and
struck his boots; but it was soft&mdash;the earth was&mdash;and
it seemed to roll and sink with his weight. The air was fine and
cold and full of fine smells and the night's sky sparkled with
its diamond stars. He could not breathe enough; he could not feel
enough. Taps broke as he entered the barrack. Tinney saw him and
Tinney gave him an evil grin. "Pickin' up your washin' again? I
saw Purple down that way tonight. Maybe he was pickin' up his
laundry too."</p>

<p>Lovelace said, "Ah," and turned to his bunk. But after the
lights were out he lay on the bunk and was racked by doubt, by a
deep hate of Tinney and Purple. He thought: "I've got to learn to
fight." He lay still and suffered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; REHEARSAL FOR A
TRAGEDY</h2>

<p class="first">AT six o'clock in the morning Lieutenant
Algernon Smith led twenty men of A Company out upon the parade,
joined a platoon of L Company waiting there under Garnett, and
made a motion of his hand which put the combined column across
the parade. The troopers moved two by two through the guardhouse
gate, rode up the slope of the ridge east of the post and came to
its crest, facing the desert's long western reach, now asmolder
with the tan and ashy colors of fresh sunlight.</p>

<p>Shafter rode as right guide at the head of the column, Smith
beside him. Adjoining the lieutenant was the civilian guide, a
tall and very thin man wearing a sloppy blue serge coat and a hat
scorched by many campfires and discolored by many a dip into
wayside creeks. His name was Bannack Bill and he had a gaunt neck
up and down which an Adam's apple slid like a loose chestnut; his
calico eyes, half hidden behind dropped lids, never ceased to
search the landscape.</p>

<p>Early morning glumness held the troopers silent; they rode
half awake, slumped on their McClellans, gradually taking on life
as the sun warmed them and the steady riding loosened their
muscles. All this was familiar country, and the ride was just one
more scout detail flung out daily to keep an eye on the Sioux,
who moved in mercurial restlessness over the land. East of the
river the Indians lived in sulky peace and paid their visits to
Bismarck, sitting in motionless rows along the sidewalk. East of
the river they were a subjugated race. But west of the river they
were a free and intractable people, at peace if it pleased them
and at war if it pleased them, made haughty and insolent by the
memory of the many evils done them by white people, made proud by
the recollection of their vanishing freedom, made warlike by
nature. They came into the post to hold council with the general
and the pipe was smoked and presents passed and gestures of
friendship made; but at night these same warriors waited in the
darkness outside the guard line to cut down whatever foolish
trooper strayed beyond the limit of safety. East of the river a
man might sleep at night in safety but west of the river was only
an uneasy peace maintained by the threat of guns&mdash;Indians
and soldiers facing each other with the knowledge that the
penned-up flood of hatred and vengeance grew stronger and
stronger behind its barrier.</p>

<p>Bannack Bill made a little gesture and rode wide of the
column, staring toward the ground as he traveled. He came back.
"Small party headin' south. Half a dozen bucks. Dozen kids and
women. Four travwaws."</p>

<p>Algernon Smith turned to Shafter. "You're new. Maybe you don't
know what we're doing."</p>

<p>"No sir."</p>

<p>"Keeping watch on these people. Never know what they might do.
Maybe they'd strike against the fort some night to drive off
stock. Maybe they might try to raid the guard lines. The only way
we can guess their state of mind is to watch the trails they
make&mdash;to see if they're collecting any place in a big bunch,
which is always indication of something in the wind. Unusual
activity is a good sign that they're disturbed. Right now it is
customary for them to collect from summer villages and go down to
the Agency for the winter. If they go down in big numbers we can
guess they're going to cause us no trouble until spring. If they
stay away from the Agency we can expect something." A little
later the lieutenant added: "Of course there are many villages,
farther west, who never come in. They're beyond our reach."</p>

<p>The middle of the morning, some thirteen miles from the fort,
the column came upon little hills and bluffs bordering the
meandering course of Heart River. At this time of the year the
river had receded to a small creek, over which the command passed
easily, wound through willow and cottonwood and filed through a
series of gullies. A ridge ran to either side of the column,
shutting off the farther view of the land. Lieutenant Smith
scanned it with a moment's professional interest, turned and made
a motion of his hand which was sufficient to send a pair of
troopers forward to act as points for the column, to send another
pair galloping up the side of the left ridge&mdash;and a third
pair toward the summit of the right ridge.</p>

<p>Bannack Bill meanwhile had found himself another interesting
set of tracks and pursued them forward at a trot, his light body
jiggling up and down on the saddle. Lieutenant Garnett, hitherto
riding halfway down the column, now came forward to travel beside
Smith.</p>

<p>"Usual course this time, Smith?"</p>

<p>"Unless we run into something that draws us aside."</p>

<p>Shafter sat easy in the saddle, pleased as he had not been
pleased for ten years. Behind him were the usual sounds of
troopers in motion, the squeezing sibilance of leather, the
off-key clinking of metal gear and the slap of canteens, the
murmuring play of talk among the men, the sudden chuffering of a
horse. He turned and saw the column stretch two and two behind
him in blue-figure line, the men so dark of face that their eyes
seemed to glitter; it was a tough, rawboned line&mdash;like a
sinuous whip being dragged across the country. Carbines lay
athwart each man's pommel; the yellow seam of each noncom's pants
leg made a splash of color. He saw Donovan's round raw face
slowly grin and Donovan's eyelid slowly wink; he settled himself
frontward again and he thought: "A damned fine life I have been
missing." Around him eddied the odor of dust and the odor of his
horse&mdash;and the smell of his own body rendering up its
warmth. All of it was good.</p>

<p>Smith said: "Tell flankers and point men to get farther
ahead," and sent off the trumpeter with the message. The
trumpeter's name was Kane and he was a round and ruddy-faced boy
who had creased the front brim of his cavalry hat upward so that
it gave him a dash; he left the column like a gunshot, flinging
his horse into an instant run, body swinging on the saddle.
Directly in rear of Shafter, Corporal Bierss and a private by the
name of Jordan were rolling out the tempting juices of one
obscene story and another, each man matching story for story.
Donovan, overhearing this, called forward to Bierss. "Lad, you
talk too big. You don't know that many women."</p>

<p>"I meet 'em quick&mdash;I get rid of 'em quick."</p>

<p>"Like Kimono Lizzie in the Big Bend House," said Donovan.</p>

<p>The column liked that and laughed at it, though the laughter
didn't trouble Bierss. He said amiably: "She wasn't no lady, so I
left."</p>

<p>"By the second-story window," said Donovan.</p>

<p>"It was too much trouble walkin' back down the stairs," said
Bierss.</p>

<p>"Just so," jeered Donovan. "There was a sergeant from D
Company comin' up the stairs, him havin' a better track on
Lizzie."</p>

<p>That did disturb Bierss, who said: "The hell with any sergeant
from D. I wouldn't walk a foot from none of that crowd. And he
didn't have no better track than I had."</p>

<p>"Whut'd you jump out the window for then?"</p>

<p>Bierss thought rapidly and came out with a virtuous answer. "I
wouldn't compromise a lady."</p>

<p>A shout of laughter exploded and rolled down the column and
came echoing back. The effect of it pleased Bierss, who grinned
beneath his ragged dragoon mustaches and shook his shoulders into
squarer shape. The two officers rode on in self-enforced
isolation, hearing it all but ignoring it. The column came up
from a long ravine and faced a desert studded with glacial rocks.
Ahead of them stretched a bumpier country, and still farther
ahead the misshapen outline of badlands showed through the thin
fall haze.</p>

<p>The point scouts had gone forward, the flankers were working
off to a greater distance, and the civilian guide was two miles
in advance, just now entering a scattered fringe of trees which
marked a creek flowing from the northwest. Smith shook his head.
"Bill's too old a hand to be doing that. He might get jumped
before we could reach him."</p>

<p>"Old ones get careless," said Garnett,</p>

<p>"Damned seldom," said Smith. "That's why they live to be
old."</p>

<p>He had not sent out advance scouts to survey the previous
crossing. But they were now thirty miles from the fort, and in
deeper Indian land, wherefore he watched the two point men as
they moved cautiously upon the timber before them and presently
turned his head to Shafter. "Take six men and go up there."</p>

<p>Shafter half swung in his saddle. He made a motion that pulled
the three nearest sets of twos away from the column, and set his
horse to the gallop across the ground. He had Corporal Bierss
with him and Bierss still held on with his stories:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So I saw she was lookin' at me with somethin' in her eyes and
I knew all I had to do was..."</p>

<p>Shafter watched the two point men fade into the timber; when
he got within a hundred feet of it he waggled a hand to left and
right, bringing his six men into skirmish line. All these
troopers knew their business and spread farther and farther apart
as they approached the timber, and so went into it, threshing
carefully through. They crossed a creek, breasted a loose thicket
and reached the top of a small bluff. Shafter stopped here,
waiting for the main command to come up. They dismounted and
crouched down to break the riding monotony, and Bierss took time
to catch a smoke. "You been at this kind of business before,
Sarge?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so. Ever in the South?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The girls down there," said Bierss dreamily, "have got skin
the color of cream."</p>

<p>"Beautiful faces," agreed Shafter.</p>

<p>"Wasn't talking about their faces," said Bierss.</p>

<p>The main column splashed over the creek, came grunting up the
side of the bluff. The advance group went to the saddle and fell
in at the head of the column. Smith swung it left, climbing again
to the crest of a ridge wherefrom he might see the roundabout
pockets and ravines; the flankers in the distance were rising and
falling across this rough ground like small boats in a
heavy sea-swell. Smith grunted and shaded his eyes against the western sun,
looking at the small figure of the guide who, two miles forward,
now turned his horse and rode a steady circle in signal. Smith
said "Gallop," and put the troop to a run.</p>

<p>The troop whirled down the ridge, the horses grunting as they
pitched across the uneven ground, accouterments banging and
slapping down. The civilian guide waited sedately, and pointed to
the south, whereupon Smith brought the column to a halt with a
downthrust of his hand. He looked back at the strung-out column.
He called testily: "Stop that sleeping on your elbows. Close
up&mdash;close up! Sergeant McDermott, what are you back there
for?" Then he looked ahead once more in the direction which had
drawn the guide's interest.</p>

<p>Off there, now showing on a ridge, now lost in a depression,
Shafter saw a column moving beneath the shape of its own
dust&mdash;a long string of ponies and riders and travois; and
over the distance he heard Indian dogs barking.</p>

<p>"Biggest one yet," said the guide. "Fifty lodges in that
outfit."</p>

<p>Garnett said, with a show of eagerness: "Let's go have a
look."</p>

<p>Smith was a cooler and more reflective man, with considerable
experience in frontier campaigning. He considered Garnett's wish,
and rejected it. "As long as they're heading for the Agency
there's no point in our stopping them. They might misjudge our
intentions as we rode up, and prepare for a fight. One shot by a
careless buck would start trouble which nobody wants or
intends."</p>

<p>"I hate like hell to let them think we're avoiding them,"
grumbled Garnett.</p>

<p>"That's scarcely the point," Smith said dryly, and put the
column forward at its former pace and in its daylong direction.
This march carried them along the ridge, so that they were in
plain sight, and gradually as they moved west they had a better
view of the long Indian column as it wound through and around and
over the depressions and hummocks of the land. The head of the
column passed out of sight on the yonder side of a ridge, but a
group of warriors came streaming back on their ponies, stopped at
the end of their column and stood watchfully there, faced against
the cavalry. Presently, as the tail of the column dropped over
the ridge, this rearguard wheeled and went scudding away&mdash;a
thin yell of defiance floating back.</p>

<p>"That's all right&mdash;that's all right," grumbled Garnett.
"We'll take care of that someday."</p>

<p>"Possible," said Smith, still dry-toned, and gestured the
command forward.</p>

<p>The sun's violent flame rolled back like sea waves across
butte and ridge and far-scattered clumps of timber; into that
yellow flare the column rode with growing weariness and longer
silences. At six o'clock Smith rose in his stirrups to have a
look before him; at six-thirty the command had camped in a grove
beside another small creek, the horses standing on picket, the
guards posted, the campfires burning and the smell of coffee and
bacon drifting in a chilling air. Men went beating along the
earth with sticks, routing out rattlesnakes, and the sun sank and
twilight fell full-handed upon the earth&mdash;and then the stars
were all ashine across infinity's pure space and the campfires
became round, dull spots in the black. Shafter rolled in his
blanket, settled his head on the saddle and for a few drowsy
moments listened to the murmuring around him. The creek left a
smooth, undulating tone behind as it ran north and the smell of
the half-dead fires drifted against Shafter's face to remind him
of a thousand bivouacs, and so to revive one by one the tangled
memories of his past. Weariness played through his
bones&mdash;the wonderful luxury of physical looseness rolling
all along his body; and his cares and strange involved wanderings
went away, taking him back to the pure simplicity of being one
tired man sleeping near other tired men.</p>

<p>There were no trumpet calls on scout patrol. Men stirred out
of sleep and saw daylight crack through the eastern blackness;
and sat up to put on their hats, their blouses and their boots,
thus rising full-dressed. One trooper gave a springing shout and
jumped aside and began to swear; he got a stick and beat the life
out of a rattlesnake which, drawn by warmth, had spent part of
the night curled against his blanket. A water detail took the
horses down to the creek, vanishing in the damp fog. Fires sprang
up, rich yellow in the half light, and the smell of coffee and
bacon pungently spread. An hour before sunrise the company moved
out, silent and cold and morose.</p>

<p>The way now was southwest as the column began to make its
curve upon the land and strike homeward; but the guide said,
"I'll look yonder a bit," and rode straight into the west.
Somewhere near the tail end of the column a trooper began to sing
and was stopped by half a dozen grumbling voices. A bleak chill
lay in the still air, its thin edge cutting against face and
hand; the breath of the horses laid little puffs of visible
moisture against the light. Sunrise broke tawny in the east,
bright but heatless, and the sleazy fog lying over the earth
vanished. The horses' hoofs struck and rattled along scattered
rock brought down by glaciers tens of thousands of years before,
and little patches of alkali showed on the ground, and clouds of
small black birds wheeled up and went away in wheeling
billows.</p>

<p>Far ahead of them the guide came into view on a ridge and
circled his horse as he had done the preceding night. Smith
watched the guide a long while but forbore to push the troop into
a gallop because of the rocky underfooting. He swung the column
to higher ground and then, clearing the gravel, simply waved his
hand overhead; the column burst into a steady run, with the
lieutenant's glance now and then going back to see how the
formation was. His voice laid down a growling insistence.</p>

<p>"Keep up&mdash;keep up. Dooly, handle your horse." Garnett had
come abreast of Smith again, but the senior lieutenant gave him a
tough look and said: "Ride back." Garnett dropped to the rear.
The lieutenant, Shafter decided, was that kind of officer who
kept his amiability and charm for the social hours; on duty he
was a brusque man attending strictly to business and determined
that others under him should attend to theirs.</p>

<p>The column followed Bannack Bill downgrade toward a thin
fringe of willows scattered along a creek. There was something
scattered on the ground which, upon a steady inspection, had to
Shafter a familiar attitude; he had seen many men thus, arms
crooked carelessly, bodies lying in the disheveled posture of
death. The guide waited near by and said nothing when Smith
halted the column. There were three men stripped naked, two of
them apparently beyond middle age and a young one. This was not
entirely a matter of certainty, for they had all been scalped,
their heads cracked in and their bodies mutilated. Each man had
half a dozen arrows thrust into him.</p>

<p>"Look like prospectors coming back from the Black Hills,"
commented Smith. "Ever see them before, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Can't recognize 'em."</p>

<p>"Not dead long. They've not swollen much."</p>

<p>"Sometime yesterday afternoon," said the guide. He got down
from his piebald horse and had a look around the ground. "They
hadn't started a fire and so I guess they were just makin'
camp."</p>

<p>There wasn't much to show the story for there was nothing left
except the bodies. Horses, equipment and supplies had been
carried off. One white trail showed where a warrior had dumped
the prospector's flour and, a few yards from the scene, a muslin
bag of beans lay spilled on the ground.</p>

<p>"It was that party we passed yesterday late," said Bannack
Bill.</p>

<p>"How sure are you of it?" asked Smith.</p>

<p>"A party of bucks would of sculped these fellers and let it go
like that. That knife work was done by squaws and the arrers
prob'ly by kids practisin' up on their shootin'. You'll find them
scalps with that party."</p>

<p>"We'll go see," said Smith.</p>

<p>He led the column to the creek and let it water, and then
swung back into the southwest, moving at a walk through the rough
gravel-strewn valley. They traveled steadily, passing over small
ridges and into other small lands of level grass, and through
broken formations and areas of upheaval. Near eleven o'clock they
cut the trail of the large party bound south for the reservation
and came upon an old Indian lying alone in the half-warm sun. He
rose to his elbows and looked at them with a bitter-black glance
out of his shrunken, disease-ravaged face, half expecting death
at the hands of the troopers; and fell back on his side, not
caring. The troop passed on.</p>

<p>Smith spoke to Shafter. "You've had campaign service?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Four years and a half."</p>

<p>"Any against Indians?"</p>

<p>"Half a year against the Comanches down in the Nations."</p>

<p>"I like to know how far I can depend on my sergeants," said
Smith briefly, and fell silent. He had followed the Indian trail
directly for an hour when he left it and moved over a hill to the
west and set his troop into a gallop along a sandy valley. They
went this way, walking and running, until the sun tipped over the
line and started down; and then the lieutenant stopped the
command for half an hour's nooning. When he moved the column on
again it was straight to the south in a line that roughly
paralleled the course of the Indian band. Around two o'clock he
called Garnett forward.</p>

<p>"Take Shafter and the first ten troopers and scout to the
left. Don't expose yourself. My desire is to come in ahead of the
Sioux and catch them before they can set themselves for trouble.
If you sight them, send back a messenger and wait for me to come
up."</p>

<p>Garnett nodded his head and started away with his detachment.
Smith's voice came after him, sharply inquisitive. "Do you
thoroughly understand you are not to precipitate any action of
your own if you sight them?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Garnett, and rode on.</p>

<p>Shafter moved beside the lieutenant, jarred out of his calm,
suddenly heated by his anger and his contempt and his savage
distrust of Garnett. He ignored the lieutenant as they slanted up
the side of the valley's east ridge, zigzagging around rock
shoulders, following old deer and antelope trails. Looking back
he saw the rest of the command streaming directly south, kicking
up a heavy pall of dust. A hundred feet short of the ridge's
crest, Garnett stopped his detachment and nodded at Shafter,
"Climb up there on foot and see what's beyond."</p>

<p>There was still some distance that might have been covered on
horse, relieving that much foot labor, but Shafter got out of the
saddle, handed over his reins to Corporal Bierss and climbed
upward over the spongy soil, his boots sliding back on the slick,
summer-cured grass. The climb made him reach for wind and he knew
this was Garnett's idea of hazing him. Near the crest of the
ridge he flattened down, removed his hat and looked over. There
was a succession of low, choppy ridges before him, and no sight
of Indians. He turned and gestured the command forward, and got
into his saddle when it came.</p>

<p>Garnett led his detachment down the far side of the ridge at a
quartering run, crossed through a series of little pockets and
started up the side of another ridge. Halfway to the top he spoke
to Shafter again. "Scout ahead on foot. Make it faster. We're
losing time."</p>

<p>Shafter dropped to the ground, catching a puzzled stare from
Bierss; he moved up the slope, digging his heels against the
turf, and flattened and looked over the high ground into a small
cross ravine which led from the valley in which the main column
moved to the one where the Sioux were presumably traveling. He
saw nothing and once more signaled up the detachment. Garnett,
when he arrived, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You ride ahead. Half a mile. When you come near the summit of
these rolls of ground, go up afoot and have a look. You'll have
to move fast to keep ahead of us."</p>

<p>Shafter got on his saddle and started away. Garnett's
sudden-loud voice turned him. "Did you hear what I told you?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Then speak up when I give you an order," said Garnett.</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said Shafter and swung off. He dropped down into
the canyon and slanted up another slope until he got within ten
feet of its summit, and went the rest of the way afoot. A plateau
lay before him, badly broken into gullies, dappled with small
knobs and minor pinnacles, and beyond that there seemed to be a
drop-off into a definite valley. He stopped long enough to signal
the detachment forward and proceeded into the rough terrain.</p>

<p>There was no clear view of any of this for more than three
hundred yards in any direction and therefore he kept a sharp
watch around him, realizing that it was likely the Indian party
might have its own scouts out. Garnett, he guessed, had thought
of the same thing, in sending him forward alone. The lieutenant
had a fixed hatred of him.</p>

<p>He passed around a knob and looked back in time to see the
detachment rise to the crest behind him. He waved at it and
dipped into a gully, followed it to a butte and circled the
butte; and thus he veered and tacked his way forward until he
reached what seemed to be the final ridge on the plateau. He
crawled the last few yards and looked over the crest into a plain
running eastward toward the Missouri. Out there, close by the
base of the plateau, the Indian band moved sedately southward,
enveloped in its own dust.</p>

<p>He made his way leisurely down the hill and lay back on the
ground until the detachment came up. Garnett rode his horse
almost on top of him. Shafter rose slowly, and enjoying the black
flash of temper he saw leap into Garnett's eyes. "Over the ridge,
just below us," he said and swung to the saddle.</p>

<p>Garnett said: "Maybe we should have brought a bed for you,"
and wheeled the column away. Shafter turned to look back at
Bierss; he saw Bierss grinning, and he winked at Bierss, knowing
that the lieutenant also saw this from the corner of his eyes.
They ran along the foot of the ridge, turned a corner of an
intervening butte, and discovered Smith riding upgrade from the
west with the rest of the command. Garnett lifted in his saddle
and made a wheeling gesture with his arm, pointing east. Smith
acknowledged it but made no effort to hurry his command on the
slope of the hill; therefore Garnett halted his group and waited.
There was a quarter-hour delay, but Garnett held his men tight in
their saddles, giving them no chance to dismount. He sat still,
completely ignoring the command.</p>

<p>Smith came up and said: "Whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"Over the ridge."</p>

<p>"Garnett," said Smith, "you should know enough to rest your
men when you have the chance." He led the column forward, staying
beneath the shelter of the ridge and following it across the
plateau until it pinched out. When they broke over the summit of
the plateau they were within five hundred feet of the Sioux,
face-on with them. Smith trotted his column forward. He turned in
the saddle to speak back to the troopers. "No false motions now,"
he said. "Wait for my commands." He spoke in a lower tone to
Garnett. "We shall ferret out the warriors who did the killing. I
propose to take them back to Lincoln."</p>

<p>"Like hunting for a piece of coal in the cellar on a black
night without a match."</p>

<p>"There are ways of doing it," said Smith. "Hold yourself ready
to do what I say. When I swing side to side in the saddle, drift
the column into a skirmish line very slowly."</p>

<p>"Very well," murmured Garnett, a touch of irritation in his
voice. Smith heard that and gave his junior officer a sharp
glance: "I don't want any damned notions of gallantry or dash to
upset this job." The column of Sioux was immediately before him
and he flung up his hand to halt the troopers. He said to Shafter
and to Bannack Bill, "Come with me," and rode forward.</p>

<p>A line of warriors milled out from the rear of the long Indian
column, racing forward, low-bent and weaving on their ponies. The
older men in the forefront of the procession ranked themselves
and sat still. Smith stopped in front of them and murmured to
Bannack Bill:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell them I'm glad to see them and hope they have had a good
summer. Tell them I presume they're going to the Agency for
winter. Tell them we're pleased to have them come in, that the
meat is fat at the Agency. Tell them any compliment you happen to
think of for about two minutes. I want to watch these young bucks
while you're talking."</p>

<p>Bannack Bill began to speak, using his hands to cut sign
across the air. The leading Sioux, all old men with faces bronzed
and chiseled by weather and years, listened. They were wholly
still except for their eyes, which lay on Bill as he spoke, and
darted covert glances at the lieutenant, and struck shrewdly
farther out to the waiting troopers. The younger men of the band
had drifted forward, forming a scattered semicircle.</p>

<p>Shafter murmured: "There's a fresh scalp hanging to the arrow
pouch of that pug-nosed lad out on the left."</p>

<p>"Very good. Sergeant," said Smith coolly. "That's what we're
looking for."</p>

<p>"You'll probably find the blankets and the clothes among the
squaws."</p>

<p>"Ever try to handle a squaw?" said Smith, dryly. "We'll leave
those dusky beauties alone."</p>

<p>Bannack Bill finished his interpreting and sat idle in the
saddle. All the old men remained silent, thereby lending dignity
to the parley. A good deal later one of them straightened on his
horse and spoke in the guttural, abrupt Sioux tongue.</p>

<p>Bill said: "He says he's very happy to see the government
soldiers. They are his friends. He is their friend. All Sioux are
friends of all whites. All whites should be friends of the Sioux,
though sometimes they are not. He says he is on his way to the
Agency and is glad to hear the beef is fat. Most years, he says,
it, is very poor and the Indians starve. Why is that, he
asks."</p>

<p>"Don't tell him I said so, Bill," said Smith, "but there isn't
any answer to that question. There are as many white thieves as
red ones and probably he's dead right. Tell him I'm happy to see
him in such good health, tell him things like that for a couple
more minutes."</p>

<p>"By God," said Bill, "I can only invent about so many lies.
Anyhow, these old codgers know what you're up to."</p>

<p>"How do they know?"</p>

<p>"You got here too fast from where they saw you last."</p>

<p>"Tell him we're all happy," said Smith.</p>

<p>Shafter said: "The lad next to the lad with the scalp has got
a gold watch and chain wrapped around his neck."</p>

<p>"Two out of three will do nicely," said Smith. "You've got a
good eye. Sergeant." He eased himself in the saddle, rolling from
side to side, which was his signal to Garnett a hundred feet
behind him. The old Sioux men watched him in beady interest,
their glances flicking back to the troopers now idly deploying
into skirmish line. The young bucks saw it as well and stirred
uneasily, drifting their ponies back and forth.</p>

<p>"Bill," said Smith, "tell him we're happy over everything but
the murder of the three white men. Ask him if he knows of that
evil thing."</p>

<p>Bannack Bill murmured: "You sure you're ready to start the
fireworks?"</p>

<p>"Let it start," said Smith. He waited until Bannack Bill began
speaking; then he turned his head and gave Shafter the kind of
glance which not only delved for toughness in another man, but
mirrored his own essentially hard spirit. "We need a display of
decision here, Sergeant. It has to be done quietly, but without
any show of hesitation. When I give the word, ride over and bring
out those two bucks. I shall back you up."</p>

<p>Shafter said, "Yes sir," and felt the continuing force of
Smith's glance. The lieutenant was aware of the risk involved in
so brisk a show of power, for the warriors in this band were all
well-armed and they could muster as much strength as the
detachment. Meanwhile Bannack Bill said his say and waited for
reply. It was not long in coming. The old spokesman of the Sioux
straightened himself, pointed to the earth, to the sky and to the
four cardinal points, no doubt invoking all the gods he knew
about to attest his sincerity, and launched into speech.</p>

<p>"Winding himself up," murmured Smith and impassively listened.
When the old one had finished, Bannack Bill paused a moment to
summarize what he had heard, and proceeded to translate it
freehand.</p>

<p>"The old codger decorates his damned lie as follows: His heart
is pure, his mouth is wide open to truth, his soul is hurt to
think the lieutenant would think that Red Owl's band would hurt a
white man. Not one of his people touched a hair on those three
prospectors. He has seen many bad things done by the whites but
he's ready to forgive and forget and would share his blanket with
any white man to show he means it. He says likewise it is gettin'
late and he's got forty miles more to go before reachin' the
Agency. The nights are growin' chilly and some of his old ones
are hungry. Which is a way of sayin' to us that it is time to
quit the foolin' around."</p>

<p>Smith nodded, meeting the old warrior's eyes. They were eyes
of black liquid, full of pride and complete confidence&mdash;and
touched with shrewd scheming as they stared back at the
lieutenant. Smith said: "Tell him I'm glad to hear of his
peaceful intentions. Ask him this: If he knew that some of his
young men had killed the prospectors, would he bring them to the
fort as a sign of his good will?"</p>

<p>Bannack Bill asked it. Out on the wings of the crowd the young
bucks grew increasingly restive and there was a murmuring among
them. The old one placed a hand on his heart and briefly answered
the question. Bannack Bill said: "He says he would bring in his
own son if his son had done it."</p>

<p>"Go get them, Sergeant," murmured Smith, not turning his head.
He stared at the old one. "Tell him I believe his word to be
true. Tell him he has no doubt been deceived by his own young
men, for we see the scalp and we see the watch. Tell him we take
him at his word and will carry the two young men back to the fort
with us."</p>

<p>Bannack Bill hesitated, casting a bland stare at Smith. "I
hope you got the best cards in this game. Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Tell him," said Smith.</p>

<p>Shafter had meanwhile turned and now rode directly and
unhurriedly to the left, passing along the ranks of the younger
warriors. They sat still, staring back at him with their haughty
faces, with the snake-twining of insolence in their eyes. He came
to the warrior who had the fresh scalp hanging from his quiver
and to the warrior with the watch wrapped by its chain around his
neck. He stopped, looking at the scalp and at the watch. Suddenly
other bucks crowded close to these two and grasped their carbines
and lifted them suggestively and a steady, thick stream of Sioux
words went back and forth along the line, growing sharper,
growing more excited.</p>

<p>Shafter heard Bannack Bill say: "He says there must be a
mistake. That is an old scalp, from many years ago. The watch was
a present."</p>

<p>"Tell him we shall take the two warriors to Lincoln. If he
speaks the truth we shall release them."</p>

<p>Shafter pulled his .44 and laid it on the buck with the scalp.
He pointed his finger at that one, and at the other one. He made
a gesture of command. These two sat dead still and stared back,
animosity burning brightly in them; but the younger men began to
push around them to make a screen that Shafter could not get
through and, seeing this, he shoved his horse forward and swung
it and laid the muzzle of his gun against the ribs of the warrior
with the scalp. He pushed on the muzzle. He said: "Move out." A
sudden crying freshened about him. He heard the clicking of
carbine hammers and he watched the young bucks drift in to trap
him. One buck swung his arm toward his revolver. Shafter laid the
gun on him at once and stopped him, and pulled the weapon back to
his original target. He heard Smith coolly say: "Ask him if a
chief swallows his words as soon as they are spoken."</p>

<p>Bannack Bill repeated it to Red Owl and Red Owl sat still
thoughtfully. Back in the column the women were beginning to lift
their shrill voices, the savage intent of their words scraping
Shafter's nerves and inciting the young warriors to greater
violence. One brave flung his carbine around and took a steady
aim on Shafter. Then Red Owl's voice came out quickly and spoke
three words that settled the question, for the two wanted
warriors moved out of the group, Shafter behind them. They rode
straight toward the waiting cavalry, never turning their
heads.</p>

<p>Smith said crisply: "Tell Red Owl I'm pleased he keeps his
word," and wheeled back to the detachment. He called to it, "Hold
your places," and swung to watch the Indian band take up its
forward motion. The old ones rode by in stony silence but the
bucks, fermenting with rage, dashed back and forth along the
cavalry line, shrilly crying, flinging up their guns in
provocation. They wheeled and charged at the troopers, sliding
down from their ponies in beautiful displays of horsemanship,
coming full tilt against the troopers' outspread line, and
wheeling away with a derisive shouting.</p>

<p>"Hold steady," said Smith.</p>

<p>Garnett watched the Sioux with the clearest kind of desire on
his wedge-shaped face. He spoke in strong enough tone for his
words to carry through the troopers. "It would be better to kill
them now than wait until next year when they may kill us."</p>

<p>"Garnett," said Lieutenant Smith, "there's women and children
in that group."</p>

<p>"They're worse than the men."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Smith.</p>

<p>The procession went slowly by, the squaws all shouting at the
troopers and some of them crying wildly. The travois dragged up
dust and the young warriors suddenly drove the Sioux horse-herd
through the deployed troopers. This was a moment of danger and
Smith saw it and called sharply again: "Hold tight," and watched
the scene with the sharpest attention until horses and Sioux had
passed on.. Then he said: "Column of
twos&mdash;forward&mdash;walk." The troopers came in, resuming
formation. Smith settled himself taciturnly at the head of the
group.</p>

<p>"It was a question in my mind how we'd come out," murmured
Bannack Bill.</p>

<p>"They had their women and kids along," said Smith. "That kept
them from fighting." He turned to Shafter, who rode with the two
captive Sioux. "Very good, Sergeant," he said, and pointed the
column due east. He was disposed to let the silence continue,
being naturally a blunt man who seldom saw the necessity of
extended conversation. But Bannack Bill, who knew a good deal
about Indians, had the recent scene still in his mind. "Something
else to make them hate us. You know how an Indian hates, Smith?
It is like one of these fires that burns in a coal bed out there
on the Bad Lands. Goes down underneath and smokes and gets
hotter. It just never goes out. One day it breaks into the
open&mdash;the damnedest blaze you ever saw."</p>

<p>"That may come," admitted Smith.</p>

<p>"Sure it's comin'. These Sioux have been pushed back as fur as
they'll push. They're right now on the last of their huntin'
land. Last buff'lo is there. Last freedom is there. They have
made up their minds to go no further. I know."</p>

<p>"If I were a Sioux," said Smith, "I'd feel the same way. We
can only hope that the authority in Washington will see the point
and let the Sioux alone."</p>

<p>"The authority in Washington," stated Bannack Bill, "will
order the Seventh out for a campaign when spring comes. I been
here a long time on the frontier. It is the same old story."</p>

<p>Smith rode a long distance in silence; he was a soldierly
shape, he was that kind of officer whose presence reassured the
command, practical and assured and humane, with the habit of
decision and the knowledge of men well-blended in him. A dozen
years of soldiering had seasoned him, taught him
rough-and-tumble, swiftness of action; it had taught him the distinction
between caution and daring. West Point and the campaign field had
made of him an excellent sample of that type of officer and
gentleman which the army regarded as its ideal.</p>

<p>Now and then his thoughts laid a temporary shadow across his
face; now and then he shook his head as his thinking took him to
impassable ground. Presently he shrugged his shoulders. "You're
right," he said. "There will be a campaign. Well, it is one of
those things over which a soldier has no control, and never will.
We do what we are told to do, and presently we shall be told to
subjugate the Indians. The fault is higher up." Then he corrected
that. "Still, the men higher up are not free agents either.
Something pushes them on, whether they like it or not. It goes
back to one race against another race. The white man's idea
against the red man's idea. If the situation were reversed, the
Indians would be doing to us what we are now trying to do to
them. White men have fought each other since the beginning of
time. Red men have fought each other. Now the races fight. Well,
we're in the hands of history, and history is a cruel thing."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," said Bannack Bill, "just remember one thing when
you're campaignin'. Every man in Red Owl's band has got the
memory of you and me and the sergeant here burned deep in his
head. He would know us next week, next month, next year. And he
has got his notions of what he'll do when he meets us. Finger by
finger and joint by joint and one chunk of flesh after another.
Remember that next summer and take damned good care you don't
fall in their hands."</p>

<p>"Things sometimes drift on for years," said Smith. "Nothing
happens. Just reveille and retreat, summer and winter. Sort of a
holiday in a man's life. Then a cloud gathers and you smell bad
weather. You feel it in your bones, as I have been feeling it for
months. Never tell me there isn't such a thing as a sixth sense.
Well then, the storm breaks. When it is over, you look around and
you see a lot of faces missing. That's the hard thing&mdash;to
recall all those men who once were beside you on the firing line,
and now are gone."</p>

<p>"It is coming," said Bannack Bill.</p>

<p>Smith lifted his shoulders and reclaimed his practical manner.
"Never pays to speculate upon the future."</p>

<p>It was then three o'clock. At ten, the command reached the
guard gate at Fort Lincoln, answered the challenge and passed in.
Taps ran the cold air as Shafter stepped wearily from his
saddle.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE RIDE TO RICE</h2>

<p class="first">COLDER weather squeezed the land; a thin crust
formed on water buckets and barrels and the ground showed crazed
frost patterns. Troopers turned out for morning roll call in
overcoats and Berlin mittens. Sergeant Hines's voice had a more
brittle snap to it and his nose, which was an adequate weather
vane, made a scarlet point in the gray dawn. After he had
announced the details for the day he said: "Shafter, harness up
the light wagon and report to commanding officer's house. Take
along a couple blankets, your carbine and fifty rounds of
ammunition. Dismiss."</p>

<p>Shafter had his breakfast, hitched the team and rolled over
the parade through a woolly fog, through a stillness that was
unlike any other stillness. The sun lay somewhere above this fog,
without heat enough to dispel it or to break the steady cold. He
rolled before Custer's house and stepped to the porch as Custer
came out with Mrs. Custer and Josephine Russell.</p>

<p>Shafter saluted and noticed the general's sharp eyes go around
the horizon. Custer said: "Not quite time for a blizzard, but it
will be cold. Are you dressed warm enough?"</p>

<p>"I'm stuffed and padded," said Josephine.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Custer, "drive Miss Russell to Fort Rice,
remain overnight, and bring her back. Be sure you leave Rice soon
enough to make the fort before sundown." Custer gave the girl a
hand to the seat of the light wagon, saw to it that a blanket was
folded over her legs, and meanwhile cast a professional eye on
the carbine lying under the seat. Mrs. Custer called from the
porch: "Give my love to Mrs. Benteen and the other ladies and say
I hope to see them soon." Shafter sent the team over the parade
at a willing trot, passed commissary and quartermaster buildings,
rolled down Laundress Row, and set out upon the road which ran
south beside the swinging loops of the river toward Fort Rice
twenty miles away. The morning-fresh team went spanking
along.</p>

<p>He had not seen Josephine for a week, and experienced a good
deal of pleasure at her presence. "I have been wondering how you
were."</p>

<p>"So have I," she said. "I grew rather curious to see how the
experiment was turning out."</p>

<p>"What experiment?"</p>

<p>"Your coming back to an old trade. Other men have tried it and
seldom found it satisfactory."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'll regret it?"</p>

<p>"You seemed a different sort of person. I
mean&mdash;accustomed to better circumstances than you are in
now." She paused, opening the subject for him. When he refused
the opening she calmly qualified her observation. "It didn't seem
to me that you would deliberately accept so rough a life."</p>

<p>"Not as rough as it looks," he commented. "It is a very good
life in fact."</p>

<p>"I know something of soldiers," she said. "I have heard them
talk and I have seen them drunk."</p>

<p>"Both the genteel and the common get drunk."</p>

<p>She sat straight, looking before her for a few thoughtful
moments. "I suppose I was rude."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not rude. You don't know my kind of
people."</p>

<p>"Those are not your kind of people," she said, now on firm
ground again. "That is why you are such a puzzle to me."</p>

<p>"When did you bother to think of me at all?"</p>

<p>"Why," she said, as though surprised that he should doubt her
interest, "don't you know any woman is intrigued by
contradictions? You are a contradiction. I wanted to go visit
Mrs. Benteen&mdash;and I suggested to Mrs. Custer that you were
undoubtedly a good driver."</p>

<p>He turned, smiling, to her and watched her smile answer him.
The cold day rouged her cheeks and sparkled in her eyes. She had
a beautifully fashioned face, all its features generous and
capable of robust emotion, all of them graceful. She was a girl
with a great degree of vitality and imagination, these things
held under careful restraint. He saw the hint of her will, or of
her pride, in the corners of her eyes and lips.</p>

<p>"I am flattered," he said.</p>

<p>"Under pressure," she said, with quick humor, "you do rise to
gallantry. Do you know&mdash;I think your thoughts of women are
sometimes less than generous."</p>

<p>He said, very seriously: "I hope I've never shown it to
you."</p>

<p>"It is only a guess," she said and at once changed the
subject. "A beautiful day."</p>

<p>The fog had closed in, bringing the horizons close upon them.
It was colder than it had been, with grayer shadows lying upon
the dull earth. To the left of them the Missouri ran between its
crumbling banks, to the right lay a strip of moderately level
country, this running up to a low ridge; and this ridge marched
southward a matter of miles and dwindled away into a general
plain. They came, late in the morning, to a narrow wooden bridge
over the Little Heart, which trembled to their passage; they
followed the road's rutty course steadily southward, steam
beginning to rise from the winter-thick wool of the horses. At
intervals during the morning a courier ran full speed by them and
later they overtook a slow-laboring freight outfit bound
southward from Bismarck. Near eleven o'clock the Bismarck-Black
Hills stage came out of the lonely land to the southwest,
pitching on its fore and aft straps.</p>

<p>"I have never liked the sharp line between officers and men,"
Josephine suddenly said.</p>

<p>She had been following some line of thought; and this was its
conclusion. He tried to guess what the thought had been but
failed. He said: "A regiment is a machine built for violent
action. Men make up the parts of the machine&mdash;and each part
has to perform its particular chore. There's no time to argue
about it when a fight starts; so it has to be settled a long time
beforehand. Every man must understand his place."</p>

<p>She said, in a lightly speculative voice: "I should not think
you'd be happy in your place."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You've had a higher place."</p>

<p>He smiled a little. "You're an indiscreet woman."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said calmly. "After all, a woman has two
privileges. To be inconsistent and to be indiscreet."</p>

<p>He said, now grown sober, "I have had both qualities used on
me. It has made me wonder what a man's privileges are."</p>

<p>"To walk away when he grows weary of it," she said promptly.
"That's what you did, didn't you?"</p>

<p>She hit hard when she chose to. He looked at her and saw her
half-smile temper the cool realism of her thinking.</p>

<p>"Many men have walked away," he admitted. "But few men ever
walked away whole. They left some of themselves behind. The
ability to trust, maybe. Faith. The first idealism they had. The
wonderful dream of youth. Love is supposed to be the core of a
woman, it is supposed to be the entire meaning of her life. The
philosophers, at least, say so. A man is supposed to have many
interests, of which love is only one. So the wreck of a love is
supposed to leave a woman bankrupt, whereas it is presumed that a
man easily mends his heart and hunts for another love. That is
entirely a fiction of the philosophers."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure?" she asked, gentle with her voice.</p>

<p>"It is the woman who mends her heart and finds another love,"
he said. "She knows she's got to do it, if she's to get along
with the business of living. So she does it. She's far more
realistic than the man. She gets her balance back and moves
forward. Very frequently he doesn't."</p>

<p>"It was as I thought," she murmured. "You are skeptical
regarding women."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I am."</p>

<p>Her answer to that was extremely soft. "I am so sorry."</p>

<p>"Why should you be?"</p>

<p>"It leaves you so little."</p>

<p>"There is still the world of men for a man to be comfortable
in."</p>

<p>Fort Rice came through the fog, a blur and then a square shape
huddled against the earth. He slapped the team into a trot and
looked at her and saw that she was quietly studying him; and he
caught an expression on her face that was wholly mature and
far-thinking. She said: "This has been a nice trip. Sergeant. At
least I have relieved you from drill, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, and drove into Rice as mess call sounded. Mrs.
Benteen, a tall and tired-appearing woman, came to the porch of
one of the half-dozen homely houses to greet Josephine. Shafter
took the girl's portmanteau into the house, came back and drove
the rig around to the stables and put up the horses. He had no
particular mess assignment and therefore hunted up a sergeant and
got permission to attach himself to H Company. After noon meal he
took a stroll around the post.</p>

<p>It was only a shabby collection of buildings, made of warped
cottonwood lumber, closely surrounded by a stockade of logs set
upright in the ground and capped at each corner by a small
bastion from which sentries might view the roundabout country at
night. All the ground was worn smooth of vegetation and all the
quarters were paintless, their walls warped apart by the reaction
of sun and rain. Thus shabby and forlorn. Fort Rice commanded the
Missouri's bluff, exposed to the full rigors of winter wind and
to summer's brutal heat. For the people of this post there were
no diversions, no entertainment, no break in a dull and confined
life. East and west of them stretched an empty land. Forty miles
to the south lay the Agency, twenty miles northward were Lincoln
and Bismarck&mdash;too far away for a casual ride.</p>

<p>He sat on the barracks porch, watching the two skeleton
companies drill briefly in the afternoon; and later he made a
circle outside the post. There was a cemetery lying slightly
beyond the post on a small knoll with little mounds slowly losing
identity as weather faded them back to the blank anonymity of the
gray earth. In a short while the very mark of these people would
be gone&mdash;they who had been round-formed and fair, their
bodies taut with hunger, their lips red and warm and all their
dreams making them great. For a short while they had lived, had
voice and motion and were set apart from other living things;
they left footprints upon the earth and their hands formed
objects which were dear to them, but now the shifting sands
filled in the crevices which marked the oblong spot where they
lay and the same wind which once had blown its fragrance against
them now blew where they were not. They had occupied space
beneath the sky and above the earth; that space was now empty.
Somewhere, somebody still remembered the touch of these people,
but in time that remembrance would grow fainter until at last
there would be no living thing that knew them&mdash;and the great
void of time would have absorbed them into its nothingness.</p>

<p>He thought of this and it was a gesture of rebellion which
made him draw his boot along the edge of one fading grave, to
sharpen its outline and thus postpone that inevitable oblivion;
and he turned and made his circuit of the post, coming upon the
crumbling bluff of the river. A wooden incline led down the side
of the bluff, upon which stood a wooden platform with wheels, and
a keg. To the machine was attached a pair of ropes by which the
keg was run to the river for its cargo of water and drawn up. He
stood awhile, smoking a cigar and watching the later afternoon
grow gray. The strange fog held on, thickening and rolling
forward until the river became a silver blur beneath the woolly
overcast. A wind came up with its keen cold.</p>

<p>After supper and after retreat, he sat awhile in H Company's
barrack-room, watching men sit taciturnly at poker tables,
watching them lie back on their bunks. A big-bellied cast-iron
stove slowly grew red and tobacco smoke rolled in sleazy layers
through the room, through which the barrels of the carbines
played a dull blue gleaming. One trooper squatted on his bunk,
plucking a sad tune from a guitar, while two other troopers stood
close by and tried to make a harmony from the tune. Out of the
washroom stalked a lean-flanked cavalryman, naked entirely, with
a pure white skin which ran up to a sun-blackened collar line.
The wind had risen and sang a soft song at the barrack eaves and
men lifted their heads, shrewdly listening to that warning. Gun
oil and dressed leather and men's bodies and the
horse-impregnated uniforms made a heavy male odor in the room.</p>

<p>"Who's goin' to be mail sergeant this winter?" asked
somebody.</p>

<p>A corporal sitting by had an answer. "John Tunis took his
discharge this week. They're breakin' in a new man at
Lincoln."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Shafter.</p>

<p>"Always a sergeant detached to carry mail in the winter when
the railroad stops runnin', Lincoln to Fargo and back, twice a
month. A team and a sleigh. Tunis was the only one who could make
his way through a blizzard."</p>

<p>Shafter moved from the barracks, into the windy blackness.
Lights glistened along the cramped parade and the bastions at
each corner of the stockage stood lonesome against the shadows.
There was a party in Benteen's quarters, all lights gleaming
cheerfully upon the cold world. Through the shadeless windows he
saw the officers and ladies of the post gathered, with Josephine
surrounded by young lieutenants. He pulled on his cigar, and was
surprised that he stood here. "I am well past sentimental
longings," he thought. But he stood fast, and observed her
carefully. One of the lieutenants drew laughter from
her&mdash;from this self-contained girl who was so careful of her
inner riches; she lifted her head and he had a full view of her
face, changed by the laughter, and he said to himself: "She's
damned attractive," and for a moment he felt a small thread of
loneliness, of outsideness and was reminded of many things in his
past. Turning away, he returned to the barracks, coming suddenly
upon a scene.</p>

<p>Men sat motionless on the bunks looking toward the end of the
big room; and those at the tables had suddenly quit their games.
The first sergeant of H, a leather-lean man with four hashmarks
across his sleeve, stood in the middle of the room and faced a
man at the far end. He was speaking in a cool, persuasive voice
to that one. "Put it down, Stampfer. When you're drunk you've got
no business handling a gun&mdash;and you're damned drunk
now."</p>

<p>The trooper at the end of the room had placed his back against
the wall. He was short and chunky, with a wildness burning in his
eyes and a mass of hair half fallen down over his forehead. His
mouth opened and closed and opened again; and then he said with a
drunk-mad distinctness: "I am going to kill you!" He brought up
the carbine in his hand. He patted it with one hand. "The only
friend I've got in the whole damned world. It don't sneak around
behind me. It don't steal things out of my bunk. It don't take my
rights away."</p>

<p>"Now," said the first sergeant in a most practical voice,
"what's the good of shootin' me, Stampfer? You want to be
hung?"</p>

<p>"I'm smarter than that," said Stampfer. "I'll leave one bullet
for myself."</p>

<p>"You're makin' a damn fool out of yourself in front of the
lads," said the first sergeant. "Put the gun down."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Stampfer. "All of you think I'm a damned fool.
Don't think I don't know that. I seen you laugh behind me. I hear
what you say about me. I'm nothin' but a dog around here!" His
voice went up-pitch, uncontrolled and half screaming. "I hate the
lot of you. I could kill you all and beat your brains out! That's
for you, Beckett&mdash;and I'm goin' to kill you first! Then I'm
goin' out to hunt the officers of this troop&mdash;the dirty
slave drivers. I'm goin' to kill Benteen and I'm goin' to put a
slug right through Gibson's guts." He shouted it out. "I've had
enough of it&mdash;from all of you&mdash;from this stinking hell
hole&mdash;from these bastard officers that look at us like we
was scum and give us the butt end of their tongues whenever they
please! You can cringe! You can stick it out when they drive you
like cattle through the heat! You can stand guard duty this
winter when it's so cold your fingers rot off! That's
fine&mdash;that's fine! I won't&mdash;not me!"</p>

<p>He stopped in quivering exhaustion. He lifted the gun half to
his shoulder and fired at Sergeant Beckett, who never moved a
muscle. The sound slammed through quarters and one man, crouched
on a bunk near Stampfer, now flung himself forward. Stampfer
swung the muzzle of the gun and caught the trooper on the side of
the head, dropping him senseless to the floor. Suddenly the whole
half end of the barrack rose and rushed at him. Stampfer swept
the gun before him like a scythe; a second trooper went down, but
a third one ducked in and caught the gun. After that H Company
went to work.</p>

<p>Stampfer was against the wall and the liquor's madness had
added strength to his heavy frame. He took these men as they came
to him, breaking his knuckles against them, plunging his feet
into their bellies. He caught them at the arms and butted his
head sharp under the chins; he slashed his fingers across their
faces and drew blood. He was struck, and struck again until sight
left him, but he stood on his feet and fought as a blind and
senseless brute would fight. One man got a strangle hold on him,
was carried around and around and flung off; another trooper
tackled him at the waist and had his face smashed by Stampfer's
up-driving knee. All this carried the fight away from the wall
toward the center of the room. Suddenly Sergeant Beckett drew his
revolver, made a quick pace forward and cracked the barrel across
Stampfer's skull. Stampfer went down, no more motion in him.</p>

<p>He left wreckage behind him, two men knocked completely out,
one man kneeling dazed on the floor with a broken nose, and half
a dozen others nursing lesser injuries. The sergeant stood still,
staring at Stampfer and cursing him. "Two months since the last
spell. I have warned you boys to offer him no booze."</p>

<p>"He had a bottle. It was full half an hour ago. It's empty
now."</p>

<p>"Dump him on his bunk and tie him to it," said Beckett. He saw
somebody coming in the door, turned about and yelled,
"Attention." He stood stiff before the entering officer, who was
Captain Benteen.</p>

<p>Benteen said in a querulous, rasping voice: "What's this?"</p>

<p>"Stampfer again."</p>

<p>Benteen was an officer of long service. He had a thatch of
snow-white hair, a round stubborn face and a mouth made for acid
comment. Benteen was a cranky realist and a disciplinarian; he
wasted no sympathy on Stampfer. "Did you lay him out?"</p>

<p>"Cold enough."</p>

<p>Benteen looked at the carbine on the floor. "Was that his shot
I heard?"</p>

<p>"It was so."</p>

<p>The captain saw the two men lying unconscious. "Badly
hurt?"</p>

<p>"Just knocked out," said the sergeant. "They'll come
around."</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Benteen, "next time he draws a gun on any man
of this company, shoot him. You have that as an order from me.
Now tomorrow when he comes to you with his regrets, make up a
pack for him with seventy pounds of bricks in it. He'll march
around this post with that until he falls down."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said the sergeant.</p>

<p>Benteen gave the troop a harsh stare and turned from the room.
Outside at the moment taps ran the post and the sentries were
calling. The trooper with a smashed face rose with his lips redly
smeared. He clapped a hand to his mouth, swearing. "He broke one
of me front teeth with his damned knee, Sarge!"</p>

<p>The sergeant went to the man. He said gruffly, "Hold up your
head," and used his fingers to pull back the man's bruised lips
as he would have opened the mouth of a horse. He looked at the
tooth sharply snapped off and he murmured: "You'll have a hell of
a toothache if that thing stays in. It has got to come out. I'll
get my pliers."</p>

<p>He went to the man who had made the first jump at Stampfer; he
bent down, and rose up. "Neely," he said softly, "go fetch the
surgeon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; OF MANY
INCIDENTS</h2>

<p class="first">AT one o'clock Shafter brought the light wagon
before Captain Benteen's door, gave Josephine a lift to the seat
and stood by while Benteen arranged the robe around her with an
old man's motions of gallantry. The captain looked at the sky a
moment, suspecting the weather. "Sergeant," he said, "waste no
time in returning to Lincoln. Do you know what an oncoming
blizzard smells like? Do you know the signs?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"If bad weather blows up before you reach the Little Heart
River bridge, turn back to this post. If you should be unable to
return, take cover in the bridge. It has served such purpose
before."</p>

<p>"You mustn't worry," said Josephine. "I have been out in many
a storm."</p>

<p>There was a wind, and the wind ruffled the captain's white
mane when he removed his garrison cap. He gave the girl a hard
smile. "A blizzard is not a storm. A blizzard is the world upside
down. It is the wind gone mad and the world drowned out. It will
drive the breath from your lungs and the heat from your body.
When the blizzard blows it brings on a fury that will pound the
reason from your head. Nothing stands against it&mdash;nothing at
all. You know that. However, I am merely cautioning you against a
remote possibility. If I thought a storm likely I should not
permit you to return to Lincoln. I think it is too early in the
winter. But don't waste time, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"It has been most pleasant," said Josephine. "I shall tell the
Custers how kind you were."</p>

<p>Benteen gave the girl an oblique glance. "Convey our regards
to the general and his lady," he said and turned away. It had not
been an effusive message.</p>

<p>Shafter rolled through the guard gate at a trot, facing a gray
plain upon which the winter fog pressed and thickened and was
churned by the stiff wind moving out of the north. It was colder
than the day before and the sun was a thin refraction of light
above the overcast. Summer and fall had departed from the plains
in the space of thirty-six hours and the smell of the air was
raw, almost dangerous. Shafter was smiling. "What is amusing?"
asked Josephine.</p>

<p>"Benteen's reluctant courtesy to Custer."</p>

<p>"It was rather wryly given. I noticed it."</p>

<p>"Have you heard the story?"</p>

<p>"Not all of it."</p>

<p>"About seven years ago the Seventh had a battle down on the
Washita in the dead of winter and wiped out Black Kettle's band
of Cheyennes. It was somewhat of a fight and a small detachment
under Major Elliot wandered off and didn't come back. Custer
considered himself in a tight fix&mdash;other bands being in the
neighborhood&mdash;and spent a couple days getting his regiment
and supply train together before looking for Elliot. He found
Elliot and nineteen men dead. Benteen considered Custer had
exhibited complete callousness in the matter and wrote a letter
about it to the newspapers. It was quite an affair. Benteen
despises Custer. If you consider the man's face you can see he
would be capable of a good robust hate."</p>

<p>"The regiment seems a very close and agreeable family."</p>

<p>"You can't put a group of men&mdash;and their
wives&mdash;together over a period of years without having
animosities. This regiment has its factions. The general is an
extremely dashing man, very proud of his abilities. You will
remember he was a boy general in the Civil War. He hasn't
forgotten it and neither have some other officers who are serving
under him, twenty years older than he is. Some of them feel he
has too much dash and too little judgment. Others would follow
him into point-blank artillery fire if he ordered it."</p>

<p>"I admire him," said Josephine. "Very much."</p>

<p>"He is either loved or hated. He commands no lesser feelings
in men."</p>

<p>"How do you feel about him?"</p>

<p>He gave her an easy, half-smiling glance. "I shall reserve my
judgment until I serve my first campaign under him."</p>

<p>She said, very soberly, "Are you that sure there will be
fighting?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I'm very sure there will be."</p>

<p>He rode along in silence, not thinking seriously of very much
but simply sitting by while the day touched him with its fingers.
The damp fog moved over his face like soft fine bristles and a
smell, slightly rank and rotten, came from the near-by river.
High up beyond the overcast was the subdued murmuring of geese,
scudding delayed before the onset of winter.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," she said, "I'm glad to be riding back with
you."</p>

<p>When he turned he saw that she was smiling at him and then he
remembered how blunt she had been with him the day before; and
was struck by the change. She had drawn the curtain of reserve
away and seemed to like him and seemed to wish to be liked by
him. She had a teasing expression of gaity in her eyes; she had a
provocative challenge in them&mdash;and all this made her a more
complex and unfathomable woman, and a more striking woman.</p>

<p>"I appreciate the honor," he said. "It was different
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, and didn't bother to explain the change.
"Isn't it a wonderful day?"</p>

<p>"When you feel good," he said, "any day is good."</p>

<p>"It is the country," she said. "It makes you spread out
inside. It makes you giddy. It even makes you reckless. It is
easy to cry or laugh here. Or to love, or kill."</p>

<p>"Killing and loving are close together sometimes."</p>

<p>They rolled on over the prairie, jarred steadily by the
dry-baked ruts. There was a sound ahead of them, of riders moving
fast through the thickening mists, and presently a lithe little
officer sitting forward on his horse like a jockey darted out of
the haze with a file of six troopers behind him; they fled by,
one shout dropping from them, and faded into the haze again.</p>

<p>He remembered, suddenly, that she had fallen long silent and
turned to see darkness on her face. She said: "That was a strange
remark. It came out of experience."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She looked at him as she had the previous
afternoon&mdash;judging him. "You should not permit your
experiences to sour you."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it is a nice day."</p>

<p>She was wholly mature at the moment, alert enough to
understand the undercurrent between them, to fathom his desire to
push her away from his secret. She said: "That was a rebuff
wasn't it. Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"There is no real gallantry in me."</p>

<p>She thought of it, and watched him with a half-lidded
attention. She was very cool, and very frank with her eyes. "It
was unnecessary to warn me. You see. Sergeant, I was brought up
to believe that each person must stand the consequences of his
own actions. I never could expect sympathy from my people when I
hurt myself doing some foolish thing. So, if I do a foolish thing
now, I shall not cry. You needn't worry."</p>

<p>"What is the foolish thing?"</p>

<p>"I have decided I like you."</p>

<p>He gave her a half-embarrassed and half-astonished glance,
whereupon her soberness unexpectedly left her and she put a hand
lightly on his arm and laughed. She had a way of laughing that
was extremely attractive, her chin tilting up and her lips
curving in pretty lines. A small dimple appeared at the left of
her mouth and light danced in her eyes.</p>

<p>He said brusquely, "You're a damned strange woman."</p>

<p>"The simplest kind of a woman. There is no complexity to a
woman until a man puts it there."</p>

<p>He shook his head and let the talk drop, but he thought about
it through the long stretch of following silence. The Little
Heart bridge shaped up through the fog murk. They passed it and
dropped their booming echoes behind; the horses, sensing home,
stepped briskly through the chilling wind.</p>

<p>"Have a nice visit?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. All officers of this regiment are gallant. There was one
young lad newly from West Point&mdash;the colonel's son. Sturgis.
It is confusing. Do you suppose Colonel Sturgis will ever return
to take the command from Custer?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it. The War Department seems to regard it as Custer's
command. He's been in charge of it for ten years or
so&mdash;except for a season when he was court-martialed and
deprived of authority."</p>

<p>"What was his transgression?"</p>

<p>"Rode a hundred miles to see his wife&mdash;and wore out his
escort troopers getting there. All this without permission to
leave his post."</p>

<p>"It was a romantic gesture," she murmured.</p>

<p>"It was something he would have arrested one of his own
officers for doing. He is a man with violent swings of temper.
Inconsistent and unpredictable. You can never know for a
certainty what he'll do next. That's been his history.
Steadfastness is not one of his virtues."</p>

<p>She said unexpectedly: "Did I see you strolling through the
dark last night, past Captain Benteen's quarters?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Smoking your cigar. I understand a cigar and a woman go
together in a man's mind. Was there a woman in your mind?"</p>

<p>"I wondered," he said, "if you were enjoying yourself."</p>

<p>"I was also thinking of you," she murmured.</p>

<p>He looked at her and noticed the sweetness of her expression
and was greatly troubled. He had started out with this girl
pretty much as a stranger; and found himself now somehow engaged
in her emotions. It threw him back on his honor, and he searched
himself carefully, wondering if he had given her encouragement.
He thought: "She's old enough to know her mind, she knows what
she's doing." But he was uneasy with the responsibility which lay
with him. It bore hard against him, the more he thought of it,
the farther he silently traveled, until he came to his abrupt
conclusion. "It will have to be settled," he thought.</p>

<p>He stopped the team and wrapped the reins around the brake
bar, turning to her. Her eyes lifted to him, narrowed and
watchful, but she made no motion when he bent and put his arms
around her; for a small moment he hesitated, looking carefully at
her lips and the expression in her glance, and saw nothing but
the layered darkness in her eyes. He bent down and kissed her,
and held the kiss longer than he intended, and drew away. She had
made no gesture and no sound; she had put no resistance against
him. But now she said, in a curt, precise voice: "I think I heard
the general say we should be home by supper-time."</p>

<p>He sent the team on at a faster clip, much more uncertain than
he had been. He thought with some self-disgust: "There is no such
thing as a study of women. Nothing is to be learned from them. A
man gains no permanent wisdom." It was then past the middle of
the afternoon, and the sky turning gray; at five o'clock he
passed through Lincoln's south gate, and drew before Custer's
house. He got down to give her a hand, and felt the weight of her
body momentarily spring against his arm. She had a light perfume
that drifted to him&mdash;a sudden, disturbing fragrance. He
started back around the horses and was halted by her clear, sharp
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One moment, Sergeant."</p>

<p>He turned and watched her come forward. She was on guard, she
was cool and quite self-assured, and smiling. It was not a soft
smile, not tender or indulgent; it came out to him as the
reflection of tumult and stirred emotions.</p>

<p>"You meant to frighten me away, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"To show you that your knowledge of me was incomplete. You
must not take men at face value."</p>

<p>He saw the fire and the intensity within her, the swift
feelings under hard control. "I think you'll find it was a
dangerous subterfuge, Sergeant," she said evenly.</p>

<p>He lifted his cap as she turned away; he climbed to the seat
and drove the rig through the sweeping wind, back to stable
quarters. He unharnessed and stalled the horses and backed the
wagon into its proper place. Having missed stable call, he
groomed his own horse in the gathering dusk. But all this while
he remembered the taste of her lips and her fragrance and the
stillness of her body, neither accepting nor rejecting him. That
got into him and suddenly he realized she had broken through his
barrier. Afterwards, walking back to quarters, he recalled her
voice as she had said: "You'll find it a dangerous subterfuge,"
and wondered at her meaning.</p>

<p>He reached the barracks with all this churning through his
head, and heard first call for drill rocketing down the parade.
"It comes early tonight," he said to Hines.</p>

<p>"For the rest of the winter it will be before supper." He
stood retreat and for a while the ceremony took the girl out of
his head. There was this power in the trumpets and in the music
of the band, in the old grooved ritual of arms, in the voice of
the adjutant calling all across the parade's distance, in the
somber, stilled ranks of the men and in the pageantry of troopers
wheeling by the commanding officer and the bright flash of gold
epaulet and the swords tossed gallantly up. It was a thing that
was in his blood and bones, not so much because of its color but
because of all that it meant in the way of men faithfully
standing together&mdash;of hard and proud men, of evil ones, of
young ones and old ones&mdash;all for the moment surrendering
what they individually were to become something greater than they
could ever individually be. That was it, he thought; that was the
thing that brought peace to him, and comfort&mdash;this faith in
a symbol, in an idea. He rode back to stables in a better frame
of mind, but at supper table the recollection of the afternoon
scenes recurred and turned him irritable. Afterwards he lighted
up a cigar and moved around the big room, as undecided as he had
been for many weeks. Sergeant McDermott and Corporal Bierss had
started a poker game. McDermott said, "Sit down, Shafter."</p>

<p>Shafter took a chair and waited for his cards. He saw Donovan
at the far end of the room with half a dozen other troopers, all
of them talking over something. Donovan saw him and came over.
Donovan murmured: "This is a good night to get wet, Professor.
How you feelin'?"</p>

<p>"Any night's a good night," said Shafter. "Where you
goin'?"</p>

<p>"There's a place across the river called the Stud Horse," said
Donovan. "Bierss here knows it's a lively spot. A little fun,
Professor?"</p>

<p>"Let the man alone," said Sergeant McDermott. "He's just about
to catch up on his arithmetic."</p>

<p>"A lad from L dropped word there'd be a group of his boys over
there," said Donovan. "It was a kind of an invitation. He said if
we had the guts to drop in&mdash;"</p>

<p>McDermott and Bierss showed immediate interest. McDermott
said: "Why didn't you say that to begin with? You comin',
Shafter?"</p>

<p>Shafter got up, still undecided. Maybe, he thought, this was
the way to knock his troubles out of his head, maybe it wasn't.
But this was his troop and the lads had let him into it; he was
one of the crowd. "I had a notion to go into Bismarck," he said.
"How long can you keep that fight on ice?"</p>

<p>"It won't get started until the police patrol clears out,
after tattoo."</p>

<p>"I'll be there," said Shafter.</p>

<p>McDermott and Bierss and Donovan went into a close study.
McDermott said: "Last time we got licked. We didn't take the best
scrappers along. Get Rusk and O'Mallan and Carter. Get..."</p>

<p>Troopers drifted forward. Lovelace came up and heard what was
in the making. He said: "I'll go, too."</p>

<p>McDermott looked at him, critical but not unkind. "You ain't
had much experience in this business, son. Barroom fightin' is a
science. You'd get your head knocked off before you turned
around. L Company will bring along its best scrappers."</p>

<p>Lovelace revealed embarrassment. He held his place and he
repeated his wish. "How am I going to learn if I don't start
sometime? Let me go along, Sarge."</p>

<p>Shafter studied the boy a moment, knowing exactly what lay in
Lovelace's mind. Presently Shafter said to McDermott: "Take
Lovelace, Mac."</p>

<p>McDermott shrugged his shoulders. "All right. You get a couple
of boats and take 'em over to the other shore, son."</p>

<p>"What are the boats for?" asked Shafter. "There's a
ferry."</p>

<p>"It will be after taps," said McDermott, "so we can't come
back on the ferry. Who's guard on Number Six Post at ten
o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Donovan.</p>

<p>"I'll go see the sergeant of the guard," said McDermott. "Last
time there was a green lad who didn't know much about soldierin'.
He might have caused us trouble."</p>

<p>Shafter turned away, but he heard McDermott's voice call after
him: "We ain't ever had enough foxy scrappers to cope with that
outfit. By God, it will be a different tune tonight. You be there
sure, Professor."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Shafter. He put on his overcoat and stepped into
the raw, steady wind. Beyond the guard gate he caught a
late-traveling ambulance, crossed the wind-chopped river and
so rode into Bismarck.</p>

<p>Earlier that afternoon Major Barrows' wife rode out of the
post on a dark bay horse and swung toward the ferry at the same
time Lieutenant Garnett came trotting off the old Fort McKean
road with half a platoon behind him. He saw her and lifted his
hat and smiled. Afterwards, inside the post, he nodded at one of
the troopers. "Purple, report to me at my quarters." He
surrendered his horse and strode over the parade to bachelors'
quarters at his usual pacing gate, every inch of his frame taut
and soldierly. He was thinking of Mrs. Barrows in his aggressive
way when he moved into the frame house at the end of Officers'
Row and entered his own particular room. He was still appraising
her as he washed up and groomed himself before his mirror. He
thought: "Lonesome as hell, and ready for a little flirting." He
corrected himself on that. "Not the precise flirting type, I
think. Probably trying to be honest with a husband who is
somewhat of a fool in his handling of her."</p>

<p>Purple presently tapped on the door and came in and stood by
with a half-respectful, half-knowing interest. Jack Purple was
the lieutenant's striker, doing the necessary valet chores,
running the usual errands and, on occasion, executing chores
which were scarcely routine. He had followed the lieutenant
through two enlistments, being transferred at his instance from
one outfit to another so that he might serve Garnett. He was in
many respects a cheaper edition of the lieutenant, as base and as
fundamentally predatory, but lacking Garnett's covering veneer.
He was a lean man with a sharp face in whose crevices a kind of
handsomeness dwelled in company with a poorly reined boldness. He
imitated the lieutenant's long hair-cut, the lieutenant's
fastidiousness of dress and in his way he tried to copy the
lieutenant's dash. An apt and willing pupil, he had learned many
of Garnett's methods with women and after eight years of
association he knew more of the lieutenant's secrets than any
other man, so that the relation between them was a thing
compounded of servility, trust, and contempt. Bound together as
they were, they had no illusions, and each man secretly harbored
his opinion of the other.</p>

<p>"Purple," said Garnett, "keep my boots in a better state. Your
private affairs have made you forgetful."</p>

<p>"The lieutenant knows," said Purple with a veiled grin, "that
I have nothing new to trouble me."</p>

<p>"You're lying," said Garnett. "I know about that girl on
Laundress Row."</p>

<p>Purple showed concern. "My God, Lieutenant, you ain't got your
eyes on her, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, but she's going with a boy in A Company."</p>

<p>"Oh, him," said Purple with indifference. "Lovelace is his
name. A dummy."</p>

<p>"Never take a woman away from a man who's liable to cripple
you. Purple. You never see me doing that, do you?"</p>

<p>"I'll take care of him."</p>

<p>"That's your affair. Now listen to me. I want a man in this
outfit soundly whipped. I wanted him busted up."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," said Purple, "some things I can do, some I can't
do."</p>

<p>"Not you," said Garnett. "Get Conboy to do it. Just drop the
word to Conboy that you can get him a hundred dollars if he does
a first-rate job."</p>

<p>"It will be first-rate if Conboy does it," said Purple, "Who
you wastin' that money on?"</p>

<p>"The new sergeant in A Company. Shafter."</p>

<p>"The one that licked Donovan?"</p>

<p>"Did he?" said Garnett and looked displeased.</p>

<p>"He did," said Purple and stood still, trying to remember
where Shafter had cut Garnett's past trail. "But it shouldn't be
much for Conboy. Conboy licked Donovan twice. This Shafter won't
reach him at all."</p>

<p>"Go see Conboy," said Garnett. "Keep my name out of it of
course."</p>

<p>"The man's a sergeant. How could he be after any woman you
wanted? Was it a long time ago, Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Get out of here," said Garnett. "Bring my horse around."</p>

<p>He pulled on his overcoat, buttoned it and snugged his
shoulders into it until the cloth lay smooth; he gave his hair a
last brushing at the edges and took care to adjust his garrison
cap; and he stood a moment before the mirror, watching his face.
"She will play the deep game," he thought. "She will want me to
play it." He went out to his horse and swung up with a last word
for Purple. "See Conboy right away," he said, and broke into a
gallop across the parade, through the guard gate and along the
ferry road. Mrs. Barrows waited at the slip for the ferry now
nosing in; she turned her head when she heard Garnett
approaching.</p>

<p>He lifted his cap to her, not smiling; he had the exact
expression on his face he wished her to see&mdash;a repressed
look which came from stirred feelings, a gentleman of honor
hard-drawn to a woman but holding himself in. He noticed the
violet
coloring of her eyes and he closely watched the small change
around her lips. These little fugitive shifts on a woman's face,
the varying sounds of a woman's voice, the small gestures or
phrases half spoken&mdash;these were things on which he always
laid much emphasis. He was not certain, but he thought he made an
effect on her.</p>

<p>"To Bismarck?"</p>

<p>She nodded and put her horse across the staging to the boat.
She rode through to the boat's far end, Garnett following. "My
destination also. Do you wish to dismount?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He made nothing of her brevity. It was a thing to be read
either way. She was, in his own expert judgment, a fully formed
and beautiful woman, an instrument of many strings, awaiting
somebody's touch.</p>

<p>"Winter's here."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. Then, as though conscious that her sparing
conversation might be rude, she gave him a full glance,
murmuring: "Now the light goes out until spring. I dread it."</p>

<p>"There's still a train back," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"An officer's wife has no business living apart from her
husband."</p>

<p>"I understand that," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you?" she softly said.</p>

<p>For all his assurance he was halted by the remark; he made
nothing of it and saw no lead for him. He thought with
impatience: "Have I misjudged this woman?" He tried a few idle
phrases, and was answered with equally idle phrases as the boat
labored with the current, reached the eastern shore and dropped
its plank. The two moved upgrade to the forking of the
road&mdash;one branch going through the Point, the other swinging
wide of the place and running along the bluff. He
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shall we take the roundabout road?"</p>

<p>She gave him an odd glance. She said, "I don't believe in
avoiding realities, Mr. Garnett. The Point can't be ignored by
circling it." But she looked behind her at the east side of the
river, which at this distance was covered by the day's thin fog;
then her eyes touched him, the excitement in them quite distinct.
"But if you wish," she said in a quicker, shallower voice, and
turned to the side road.</p>

<p>He felt a quick elation. She had made a decision and had
indirectly told him why she had made it. They moved up the road
to the top of the bluff and came in another quarter hour to the
scar of the railroad right-of-way being built west of Bismarck
and now abandoned for winter. They rode along the right-of-way
until, by her gesture, they swung into the flat prairie.
Presently they were two figures riding along in the mist. "I like
it better this way."</p>

<p>"Strange," he said. "I should think you'd like to stick to
lights and comfort. I should not think you'd enjoy lonely
places."</p>

<p>"Lonely people for lonely places," she said.</p>

<p>"I recognized the loneliness in you."</p>

<p>"I suspect you are rather clever at reading people, Mr.
Garnett. Have you been wasting your time reading me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Is it a waste of time?"</p>

<p>"Better if it were."</p>

<p>"It is a damned hard thing," he said, his voice rough and
edged.</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"To see a woman&mdash;to know that woman is your kind of a
woman. Dreaming the same kind of dreams. Ready to laugh at the
same things, to feel the same loves, the same passions. To lie
awake at night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Garnett," she murmured in the softest of voices. He
looked down and saw her hands tightly gripping the pommel; he saw
hurt and hard restraint on her face. He had struck her emotions
forcibly and he knew this was the moment he had waited for.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said, and stopped his horse and got down. He came
beside her, looking up; the things he felt were hot enough and
real enough at this moment to show upon him and the woman saw
them as she stared at him and struggled with herself.</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, "get back on your horse."</p>

<p>"Come down," he said, and touched her. He felt her body
trembling as she hung to the pommel, he noticed a weakening in
her, he recognized something almost like terror on her face; and
then that broke and she crossed the deadline she had set herself,
and suddenly put out her arms and came down to him. He had her in
his arms and his mouth upon her and he held her like that over
the lengthening moments, feeling surrender soften her. When she
pulled her lips away she was silently crying, even as she clung
to him; she dropped her head and laid it against his chest.</p>

<p>"I knew this was coming," she whispered. "I knew it at the
Custers'. I sat there and could look ahead and see all of it.
You're not a good man, Mr. Garnett. I know that."</p>

<p>He said: "I am very much in love with you."</p>

<p>She lifted her head and showed him her bitter glance. "You
needn't lie. It isn't necessary."</p>

<p>Her realism had not left her and this threw him off balance
and made his next words ridiculous even in his own ears. "Do you
think I'd touch you if I didn't have the deepest kind of
feelings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "you would. I know you&mdash;and now I think
you know me. You have studied me rather carefully haven't you?
Help me up, please."</p>

<p>He gave her a hand to the side saddle, flushing at the
position in which he had been placed. She made him seem awkward
and amateurish and that was to him an unforgivable thing. He got
to his own saddle and quickly attempted to get the scene back
within his control. "Mrs. Barrows," he said, "if you believe that
about me I shall certainly not come near you again."</p>

<p>She stared into the thickening, graying mist of the afternoon
and then she turned and gave him a glance which revealed the
fatalism in her. "Yes, you will. And you know also that when you
come, I'll be where you want me. That is the way it will be,
Edward. We both know what we are and we both know there is no
help for us. I'm going back to the fort. Don't come with me."</p>

<p>She turned her horse and started away, then checked around and
rode back to him. Her voice softened and her face showed a more
tender side of her character. Her eyes searched him and seemed to
have hope in him. "Edward," she murmured, "we can be better
people. Let's try to be."</p>

<p>He gave her a dark, rash look. He said, "I want you. I've got
to have you."</p>

<p>Her voice lifted to a sudden passionate appeal. "Let me
alone!"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I can't. I want you and I know you want me.
That's enough isn't it? What else matters at all? I can't play a
hypocritical part. Neither can you. There's too much in both of
us."</p>

<p>She watched him a long moment, her shoulders dropping and the
softness going from her face&mdash;the odd glow of beauty dying.
A long sigh escaped from her. "All right, Edward," she whispered.
"All right," and turned from him.</p>

<p>He watched her grow smaller and dimmer in the rapid-falling
twilight, and at last vanish. He had a twinge of conscience, not
at his conquest of her, but in permitting her to return home
alone. He had done better than he expected; he had caught her
sooner than he believed possible, and now said to himself: "A
ripe peach ready to drop from the tree." As soon as he said it,
he thought differently of her, he valued his triumph less highly,
and he had another cynical thought: "From what she said I don't
suppose I'm the first man to come along." Even so, he was
thinking of when he should next see her, and of what he would
say. With this in his mind to excite him, he pointed his horse
southeastward, hearing the fort's sunset gun send its echo up
along the river's canyon in rocketing waves. At late dusk he
arrived in Bismarck, stabled his horse and went into the
restaurant frequently patronized by the post's unattached
officers. He discovered Edgerly in the back of the place.</p>

<p>"Got tired of the food at Bachelor Hall?" asked Garnett.</p>

<p>"Been tired of it for years," said Edgerly.</p>

<p>"You should do as I do&mdash;get yourself invited more often
to married quarters for your meals."</p>

<p>"I've been a star boarder at every table in the garrison,"
said Edgerly. "A man can push his luck just so far. Then he
becomes a damned bore."</p>

<p>"Maybe our salvation," said Garnett, "lies in marriage."</p>

<p>"That," said Edgerly, "is a damned bizarre suggestion, coming
from you."</p>

<p>Garnett accepted the remark with a grin, but he felt the
pointed edge of it. He envied Edgerly's magnificent stature and
was jealous of Edgerly's thoroughly masculine appearance. The man
was as handsome as hell and was the cynosure of many a woman's
eyes. While he ordered and ate, he turned Edgerly's remark over
in his head, possessing a Beau Brummel's sensitiveness to the
opinions of other men; and he wondered if he had acquired a
reputation among his brother officers of which he was not aware.
The thought inevitably brought along his companion worry: Had any
part of his past caught up with him? There were only two men in
the post&mdash;Captain Moylan and Shafter&mdash;who knew his
reputation and both these men, being gentlemen of their own
standards, would keep silent; a gentleman, he thought with a
return of cynicism, was a man who suppressed his natural desires
for fear of what people would say.</p>

<p>"You came in here looking rather pleased," observed Edgerly.
"Had luck?"</p>

<p>"Luck?" said Garnett and felt himself betray a certain
embarrassment. Edgerly had a sharp pair of eyes and it seemed to
him that Edgerly now watched him with something more than casual
curiosity. "Just the winter air vitalizing me, I suppose." He
lighted a cigar with his coffee, taking such ease as could be
found in the restaurant's drab atmosphere. The place had become
crowded with the odd assortment of rough frontier
types&mdash;cowhands, railroad men, gamblers and freighters. A
buxom and floridly handsome woman swept into the place, wearing a
vivid mauve dress fitted sung at bosom and hips; she took a table
and she called out in her hearty voice: "Hurry it up, Charley,"
and cast a speculative glance at the two officers.</p>

<p>"Shall we take in the opera?" suggested Garnett
sardonically.</p>

<p>"The girls at the Wave put on a pretty good show," said
Edgerly. "Rough but diverting. However, I think I'll go back to
the post and spend the evening with Upton's
<i><b>Tactics</b></i>."</p>

<p>"Scarcely answers the problems of a Sioux campaign," said
Garnett. "Upton conceives of a cavalry as a solid force meeting a
solid enemy. The Sioux simply do not subscribe to the doctrine of
staying in one place or insufficient force to be met and
defeated. It is like charging a cloud of dust."</p>

<p>"The answer is," suggested Edgerly, "for the cavalry to in
turn do the same thing. Make rapid night marches, hide by day,
split and come together."</p>

<p>"That would be practical if we had no wagon train, no luggage,
no such impediments as saddles, intrenching tools and so on. The
Anglo-Saxon horse soldier is a cumbersome object moving along at
five miles an hour. The element of surprise is not in him unless
he is fighting equally cumbersome opposition. If you attempt to
split forces in front of the Sioux the result is that the Sioux
see it and destroy each force separately."</p>

<p>Edgerly said: "It depends a great deal on the commander."</p>

<p>"Our commanders are still fighting the Civil War&mdash;mass
against mass. They come out here with a total lack of information
regarding Indians."</p>

<p>"Scarcely true of Custer."</p>

<p>"Edgerly," said Garnett, "doesn't it strike you a little odd
to hear him say that one white soldier can match ten Indians? Do
you believe that? I don't. I believe it to be the kind of
reasoning which may lead us into difficulty."</p>

<p>"You sound like Benteen," said Edgerly. "I had not known you
were a Benteen adherent."</p>

<p>"No," said Garnett, "I have not aligned myself."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Edgerly, "I believe the regiment will
acquit itself with credit when the campaign comes. Did you hear
Custer is presently leaving for the East on vacation?"</p>

<p>The two rose, paid their bill and went out&mdash;a pair of
tall and extremely distinguished-appearing men drawing the
covertly admiring glance of the buxom woman at the table. They
stepped into a street turned robust and lively by Saturday
night's traffic. The gush of Bismarck's lamps played upon the
street's moisture-clodded dust and cappers stood before the
gaming houses, each with his patter and his urgent invitation. A
line of soldiers were spread along a shooting gallery's arcade,
the twenty-two-caliber rifle bullets clanging on the metal
targets. Edgerly paused a moment to look on, and to make his
observation. "That's something we could stand more of in the
regiment. We've got too many recruits who are indifferent shots."
Half a dozen cowhands whirled through the night's darkness,
primed for excitement, and sending their high sudden shouting
into the clamor; the town marshal paced taciturnly by on his
steady rounds and a tall, white-mustached man came down the
street side by side with Josephine Russell.</p>

<p>Edgerly paused before them and lifted his hat, smiling. He
shook hands with the elderly man and he made a gallant bow before
Josephine, who said: "Night-hawking, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"A couple of soldiers on the prowl," agreed Edgerly and then,
remembering that Garnett had not previously met Josephine's
father, made the introduction.</p>

<p>Garnett made his bow and accepted Russell's hand. The girl's
presence straightened him like a cold shock and placed him on his
best and most charming manner. He observed the girl's casual
glance, and met it, and his fast mind began to hunt for the usual
signs that would give him a proper lead. He held her attention
until she swung her glance to Edgerly.</p>

<p>Russell said: "You've had a cold ride over from the fort, and
mighty little entertainment to be had here to pay for it. Happy
to have you both join us at our house for a cup of coffee."</p>

<p>Edgerly said, "I should be back at the post, but I shall
accept, in order to give Garnett here a view into one of the few
civilized homes in this territory."</p>

<p>"You must be thinking of our new plush chair," said Josephine.
Edgerly made a move to drop beside her and was forestalled by
Garnett who smoothly turned and took her arm. She gave Garnett an
amused glance and then again diverted her attention to
Edgerly.</p>

<p>"How was the last scout?"</p>

<p>"No excitement. None at all. The Sioux are all coming in
willingly for a winter of free beef at the Agency."</p>

<p>"Don't you folks be deceived," said Russell. "There's more
things brewing than you're familiar with. I talk to the traders
and teamsters. They catch what's going on."</p>

<p>"What's going on?" asked Edgerly.</p>

<p>"The Sioux have got plenty of guns and plenty or shells and
plenty of horses. They been visiting, band to band, all this
fall. Sitting Bull's been around talking to Gall and Two Moons
and Crazy Horse and the other chiefs. It is unusual for Indians
to make plans that way. Each band most always goes it alone."</p>

<p>"What are they talking about?"</p>

<p>"You'd never get a Sioux, not even a renegade Sioux, to tell
you that."</p>

<p>Edgerly spoke soberly: "Let it be, if they want to light it
out next spring. We shall settle the Indian question once and for
all."</p>

<p>Mr. Russell gave the lieutenant an old man's glance of
reserved knowledge. "The army's said that for ten years, and it
has tried. It has nothing yet to show for its campaigning." But
then his courtesy made him smooth over the reflection. "Let's not
discuss politics. Coffee will be good after this cold wind. Early
winter coming."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; AT THE STUD
HORSE</h2>

<p class="first">SHAFTER came into Bismarck half an hour later
and entered the nearest saloon; he strolled along the filled
tables, he watched the faro rig and he tried a dollar on the
roulette wheel. One of A's troopers, a Dutchman by the name of
Kanser, sat at the blackjack table, having luck. Kanser looked up
at him, pointed to his pile and said: "Sit in, Sarge. I'll bank
you. I'm lucky." Shafter shook his head and passed on out of the
saloon into the gathering wind. He had reached the far end of the
street before he quite realized where he was bound, and then he
shrugged his shoulders and continued on across the empty area
toward Josephine Russell's. Suddenly he knew that she had been in
his mind ever since he had dropped her at the Custer house. He
had the clearest picture of her smile, the strongest recollection
of her voice. He was going back to her, he told himself, to
straighten out a misunderstanding. He had meant nothing by the
kiss; he wanted her to know that.</p>

<p>He wasn't aware of visitors until he had knocked; and then it
was too late to turn back, for Josephine opened the door at once
and seemed pleased to see him. She took his arm, saying, "Come in
out of the cold," and drew him through the door. As soon as he
got inside he saw Edgerly and Garnett.</p>

<p>He stood still and his thorough knowledge of the gulf that
separated officer and enlisted man made him realize the
embarrassment of his position, even though he was on the neutral
ground of a civilian house. Edgerly was faintly smiling the smile
of a man who looked upon an awkward situation with some
puzzlement; and he was quick to say, "Good evening,
Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir," said Shafter. He was at the moment
watching Garnett's eyes display a malice and a thin pleasure, and
the sight of that heated him physically and hatred of Garnett was
a force that kicked him in his stomach. He thought rapidly of one
means or another by which he might gracefully retire from a
situation which was as painful to his hosts and to Edgerly as to
himself.</p>

<p>The girl understood this as well as he did. She saw the whole
scene quite clearly, Shafter's stony attitude of attention in
front of his superior officers, Edgerly's gentlemanly effort to
break the restraint with his friendly smile, and the satisfaction
visible on Garnett's face. She said to Shafter in a soft and
hurried voice: "Wouldn't you like to have a cup of coffee?"</p>

<p>He said: "I've had supper."</p>

<p>Edgerly meanwhile had done his quick thinking. Now he said:
"Did you find the horse I sent you after?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"That's fine, Sergeant. Where was he?"</p>

<p>"Beyond the Point."</p>

<p>"Take him back to the fort for me. Sergeant," suggested
Edgerly, and gave Shafter his repressed grin.</p>

<p>Shafter turned out of the house at once. The girl followed
him, closing the door. He had stepped from the porch when her
voice stopped and turned him. He stood still, watching her move
forward. "I'm very sorry," she murmured. "I suppose it was my
fault. If I hadn't invited you inside you wouldn't have been
placed in an uncomfortable situation. But it would have seemed
very rude if I hadn't asked you in, wouldn't it? You wouldn't
have known the reason and you would have thought me without any
manners at all."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," he said.</p>

<p>But she shook her head as she watched him. "I'm afraid it
does. You're quite angry."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I have no privilege to be angry. Good
night."</p>

<p>He was down the steps when she stopped him again. "Just a
moment," she said and turned into the house. Presently she came
out with a heavy coat wrapped around her. She took his arm, not
saying anything, and she walked with him back through the windy
darkness toward Bismarck's street. When they reached the foot of
the street he stopped and faced her. "That was nice of you."</p>

<p>She said: "I hate that military distinction between officers
and men. I really hate it."</p>

<p>"It can't be otherwise," he said.</p>

<p>"Edgerly was very thoughtful."</p>

<p>"The man is a gentleman by instinct."</p>

<p>"There's something very bitter between you and the other
one&mdash;Garnett. I think that's what made you most angry."</p>

<p>He looked at her and was ashamed of the trouble he had caused
her. He said: "I apologize for bringing any of my feelings into
your house. You shouldn't give it another thought. I had no right
to come to you."</p>

<p>She chose her words with a good deal of care. "I have my own
rules of right and wrong. You must let me feel the way I wish to
feel about it."</p>

<p>He smiled down at her somewhat in his old and easy way, but
she knew he was inwardly rankling and then she was completely
convinced that her prior judgment of him was correct. Had he
never been of a higher grade than a sergeant he would have
accepted the scene in her house without a second thought and
automatically would have made his departure. But he had felt
embarrassment, even though he knew the rules of the game; he had
made his exit as gracefully as possible, to save her feelings as
well as his own. He had once been something better, and perhaps
the memory of that was the thing that had most hurt him.</p>

<p>"You have a gentle heart," he said. "Do you wish me to see you
back to the house?"</p>

<p>"No. Come to supper Wednesday night."</p>

<p>She thought he meant to refuse, for he stood silent as he
considered it. Then she saw his smile come again. "That will be
something to look forward to," he said and lifted his hat to her
and went up the street.</p>

<p>She stood a moment, watching him stride away, sharing his
embarrassment and made angry at the scene which had produced it.
Presently she shrugged her shoulders and moved back toward the
house. "Some of it I don't understand," she thought. "Some of it
came from the other officer&mdash;from Garnett."</p>

<p>At the south end of the street Shafter hailed a freighter
moving out of town and climbed aboard, to sit in heavy silence
beside a taciturn driver whose sole remark was "Hyah Lily, hyah,
Don!" The blackness of the night closed in and the fog broke like
a fine rain against them, very cold. "Damn him," Shafter thought,
"he's moved into another home, to stalk another woman." There was
no feeling as bad as the one which that knowledge brought; it
whetted his temper dangerously, it brought up from the past small
pieces of memory one by one and revived a story he had never been
able wholly to forget. "He'll spoil her if he can, knowing I know
her. God damn him!" He slammed the palm of a hand hard down on
the seat from thinking of it, drawing the teamster's slanted
glance. "No mosquitoes this time of year," said the driver.</p>

<p>Three quarters of an hour later the lights of the Point began
to make crystal blooms through the fog and by degrees the sound
of music moved forward. They passed a building strongly lighted
and skirted others one by one. "Which is the Stud Horse?" asked
Shafter.</p>

<p>The driver pointed with his arm. Then he said: "Been there
before?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then you're a fool for goin' near it."</p>

<p>Shafter said, "That may be," and dropped into a road slowly
turning to mud beneath the wheels of the steady-passing wagons.
When he reached the door of the Stud Horse he noticed a few
troopers hanging back in the darkness, grouped together. Passing
through he came upon a room the approximate size of A Company's
quarters, with its bar running the full length of one wall, with
the customary grouping of poker tables and other gambling
layouts. There was a small floor for dancing and a raised
platform at one end on which sat a piano, and a pianist in a
velveteen jacket, an accordion player and a fiddler. There was
additionally on the platform a rawboned girl singing a song about
a soldier lad who would hear no more bugles to the muted
accompaniment of the violin. Fragments of the song came through a
considerable racket, for the place was well occupied by soldiers
from the post, and this was the latter part of the evening so
that the fun had gotten moderately rough. He saw Lovelace
standing at the bar and walked toward him. The youngster gave him
a look and murmured: "The crowd's been waitin' for you. They're
in the back room."</p>

<p>Lovelace's hair was as yellow as a girl's and he had a nice
pair of eyes, A glass of whisky stood before him on the bar, so
far untouched; he moved it between his hands with short restless
gestures and he seemed nervous.</p>

<p>"I'd let that stuff alone until later," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"I wish this was over with," said the lad. "But we got to wait
until the patrol comes through. L Company's outside. I saw 'em
awhile ago."</p>

<p>"You been in this kind of fighting before?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lovelace. "I'm not afraid of it, but maybe this
drink would help."</p>

<p>"Wait awhile," said Shafter and pushed the whisky away. The
front door opened and a file of troopers came briskly in, headed
by a sergeant. The sergeant bawled: "All out for the ferry. Make
it sharp now, boys. Get away from that bar&mdash;cash in. I won't
be tellin' you twice." The detail tramped out.</p>

<p>"We'll go out and circle the place to the back room," said
Lovelace. The music stopped and Shafter and Lovelace moved with
the crowd into the sparkling, damp air. Voices called through the
blind fog and somewhere a woman started to laugh and kept on
until she ran out of breath. He heard the patrol sergeant
shouting in and out of the Point's various dens. Lights died here
and there as Lovelace led him around the corner of the Stud
Horse, past a group of waiting troopers. He heard one of them
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's that new sergeant of A Company."</p>

<p>"Can he fight?"</p>

<p>"He licked Donovan."</p>

<p>"He's my oyster, boys. Where'd that damned patrol go to?"</p>

<p>Lovelace led him to the rear of the building and opened a door
into a little room crowded with A troopers. A lamp burned on the
table and smoke filled the place. Donovan said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're a man to keep a date on the dot. Professor. Nine it
is. The patrol's gone by."</p>

<p>"Hold it a minute," said Sergeant McDermott.</p>

<p>"Hackett is patrol sergeant tonight and he knows about this.
So he said, don't start a fight until he gets out of
hearin'."</p>

<p>"You think of everything," said Donovan.</p>

<p>"There's a right way to fix things&mdash;and a wrong way,"
said McDermott. "Lovelace, how many L men did you see?"</p>

<p>"Eight or nine."</p>

<p>"The agreement was not more than ten to a side," said
McDermott, "but you got to watch that outfit. It is not to be
trusted."</p>

<p>Shafter counted noses. He said: "We've got twelve here,
Mac."</p>

<p>"That's entirely different," said McDermott. "Just in case
they got more."</p>

<p>Shafter grinned at the men around him, at Donovan's scarred
professional fighting face, at the wholly unconcerned Bierss, at
Lovelace who was worried and tried to hide it, at Tinney whom he
felt to be treacherous, at the other troopers standing shoulder
to shoulder around the room; it was the troop spirit that drew
them here&mdash;the pride of it in their bones and the rank lust
of living in their blood. They would be bruised and they would be
hurt and some of them would carry scars afterwards, but still it
was the faith of one man to another that brought them here.</p>

<p>There was a scratching and a murmuring out in the big room.
McDermott said: "That's them," and opened the little room's inner
door and stepped through with A's troopers behind him. McDermott
looked across the room at the L troopers drawn into a kind of
line; he said, politely formal, "Well, gentlemen, here we are.
How many have you got?"</p>

<p>There was a sergeant to speak for L&mdash;a rawboned heavy man
with pure-black mustaches roping down from either side of his
mouth. "You can count, Mac."</p>

<p>"So I can, and I count thirteen. That's more than ten."</p>

<p>"Ain't it, though," retorted L's sergeant. "And I can count,
too, and I count twelve. You tryin' to fool us again?"</p>

<p>"I said to the boys," said McDermott, "that you could never
trust L. I was right, wasn't I?"</p>

<p>"Twelve and twelve then," said L's sergeant, and turned to
point a finger at one of his men. "You, Gatch, stand aside and
stay out of it."</p>

<p>McDermott took a look at the discarded L trooper and was
derisive. "Him? Hell, leave him in the fun. He ain't goin' to be
of any use to you anyhow."</p>

<p>The two troops had spread out and had gradually drifted
nearer. A man came from the bar, speaking to them: "What you pick
my place for? I get the worst of it all the time. Take your scrap
over to the City of Paris for a change. You bust up any more
poker tables for me and I'm goin' to turn you in to Custer."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said McDermott, "you do that. He'll pay the bill." But
then he stopped his forward drifting and stabbed an arm at one of
the troopers in front of him. "Conboy, what're you doin' here?
This is strictly between A and L."</p>

<p>But L's sergeant said in a cool and crafty voice: "Nothin' was
said about that."</p>

<p>Conboy was built short and broad and muscular. He had a bull's
neck and a jet-black head of hair cropped close to his skull and
when he looked out upon A Company's ranks he dropped his head and
scanned them from beneath his heavy brows. He was a
knuckle-scarred man, flat of lip and flat of nose, and he rubbed his
shoes gently back and forth on the floor, his knees springing
into a slight crouch. Donovan protested at once. "Nothin' was
said about bringin' in outside bruisers, either. Is this an
honest fight, or ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Now will you listen to who's speakin' those words?" jeered
L's sergeant.</p>

<p>"All right," said Donovan. "Pair off as you want, but I'll
take Conboy."</p>

<p>"I've licked you before, Donovan," said Conboy, now speaking
for himself. "I want fresh meat this time."</p>

<p>"So you've got down to pickin' your meat easy," said Donovan
with heavy sarcasm. "You should be proud of that, Conboy."</p>

<p>"I'll take one man," said Conboy with a kind of insolent
weariness. "When I have done him up I'll back off. That leaves
things even enough."</p>

<p>"Who's the man?" demanded McDermott.</p>

<p>"Him," said Conboy and pointed at Shafter. "I hear he thinks
he's a fighter."</p>

<p>McDermott was outraged at the affair and said so. "Martin," he
said to L's sergeant, "if that damned misfit outfit of yours is
so afraid of itself that it has got to ring in professional
talent to win a scrap, you can go to hell before you get any
further consideration from us."</p>

<p>Donovan had drifted beside Shafter and now whispered. "The man
is a bruiser. He fought all the big ones in England. I have
fought him twice. He's better than me, Professor. He's better
than you."</p>

<p>Conboy stood watching Shafter with an idle, lowering light in
his pale-blue eyes, with his scarred head dropped after the
fashion of a dangerous bull half ready to charge. He was
barrel-chested and he had massive legs but his girth bulged out from his
hips like pillow stuffings; he was past his prime and no longer
kept himself hard, but the crafty skill of his long years was
more than enough among amateurs. He was, Shafter guessed, beyond
thirty-five.</p>

<p>Conboy said: "You ready?"</p>

<p>Shafter moved to the bar and peeled off his overcoat and
blouse and shirt. He heard Conboy say in a vast, confident voice:
"The rest of you lads hold off your fight till we have ours. I
like a proper audience."</p>

<p>"A knockdown is a round?" asked Donovan. "You back off when
he's on the floor?"</p>

<p>"So it is," said Conboy shortly.</p>

<p>"Then it is understood," said Donovan. "Everything proper. If
you forget that, Conboy, I'll come up behind you with a
chair."</p>

<p>Conboy had stripped to the waist, and now he squatted
slightly, one foot forward and both enormous fists cocked stiffly
before him. Shafter squared off before him, standing balanced
with his arms down. Conboy stared at him from under his shaggy
brows. "Get your guard up, you fool. I'll not play around with a
green man. Come on, guinea, give me a fight&mdash;give me a
fight."</p>

<p>The troopers had fashioned a circle to watch this; other
troopers were returning to the Stud Horse, drawn by the rumor of
trouble. Shafter looked at Conboy's feet, so solidly planted on
the floor, anchored there by the man's vast bulk, and
experimentally he slowly circled Conboy at a distance, watching
Conboy's shoes make little shuffling turns; suddenly Shafter
whipped back in the opposite direction and saw Conboy's feet stop
and reverse. Conboy's footwork had been slow and Conboy knew it
as well as Shafter, for his pale eyes heated up and he let out a
huge roar and came rushing forward with his head down and his big
hands reaching out in feinting punches. Shafter slid by him,
hooked a hard jab into the man's belly, swung and caught Conboy
on the side of the neck. Conboy, never off balance, whirled
catlike and launched his rush; he missed with his right hand and
reached full out with his left fist and caught Shafter on the
shoulder, shaking Shafter backward. He followed up his chance,
pursuing Shafter. Shafter wheeled aside, swinging behind Conboy
and waiting there.</p>

<p>Conboy came around with an irritated scowl. "Come
on&mdash;quit the fancy stuff and give me a fight!" He stood
still, his flanks heaving softly to his breathing. He jiggled his
fists up and down, feinting as he remained in his tracks and
watching Shafter with his alert and crafty eyes. L Company's men
were beginning to ride Shafter with their comment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's monseer, the dancer."</p>

<p>"Take a crack at him, Shafter. It won't hurt any worse to get
killed now than later."</p>

<p>Shafter moved sidewise again, slowly turning a circle while
Conboy irritably wound about. Shafter heard Donovan murmur: "Take
your time Professor. Make him come to you. The big tub of guts is
too heavy to move."</p>

<p>Conboy heard it and flung his head aside to shout at Donovan:
"I moved fast enough for you, lad&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shafter slipped in, cracked him on the side of the face and
laced a jab into his flank; he had learned something about the
man at the first exchange of punches, and learned something now,
for Conboy's ruffled temper gave him speed and he came around in
a flash and smashed through Shafter's fending arm and hit him
with a left-hand blow on the chest. It had a crushing effect,
turning Shafter cold. All he saw for that moment was Conboy's red
face and pale-blue eyes moving against him; he ducked and barely
avoided a killing punch that went windy past his cheek; in
self-defense he fell against Conboy, locked Conboy's arms and laid his
weight against Conboy. Donovan yelled: "That's it&mdash;that's
it!"</p>

<p>Conboy roared, "Is it now?" and threw his bullet round head
forward, cracking Shafter hard on lip and nose. Shafter locked
his fingers together behind Conboy's back and squeezed, but it
was like squeezing into sponge rubber; he could not spring the
man's ribs. He bore Conboy backward by his dead weight, he
shifted his legs to protect his crotch against the up-driving of
Conboy's knees and he brought his heel hard down on Conboy's
instep. The heavy man had grown angry and his wind began to
trouble him as he tried to fling Shafter away. They had wheeled
around the circle, with the circle giving away, and now they came
to the bar. Conboy used a sudden concentration of energy to swing
and hurl Shafter against the bar. Shafter, who realized what the
man wanted to do, let himself be carried around and then flung
his own strength into the wrestling.</p>

<p>Conboy, overbalanced, struck the bar and was pinned to it.
Shafter surged against him, driving the man's shoulders backward.
He heard Conboy grunt and wheeze and he pushed Conboy far enough
to draw one of the man's legs from the ground. He let go, smashed
him under the neck with two hard side-swinging punches, saw
Conboy's arms lift and then drove in with his knee full into
Conboy's belly.</p>

<p>For a little while he had Conboy cornered and he grew reckless
of his own defense. He battered Conboy's kidneys, he flung
himself against the man again with all his weight and threw his
forearm across Conboy's windpipe, springing the man's back on the
edge of the bar. He matched Conboy's strength with his own and he
balanced his weight against Conboy's. He heard L Company shouting
at him, outraged at the turn of the affair and disliking this
kind of fighting. He heard something crash and then the truce
snapped and the troopers rushed yelling at one another.</p>

<p>He saw Conboy's face grow crimson from strain and he felt the
man's oxlike heart slug through his shirt. He let go the pressure
and stepped back and drove a right-hand blow with all the power
he had into Conboy's belly. He saw Conboy sag; but that was all
he saw. Fired up and aggressive, he momentarily forgot that this
man had spent a lifetime learning rough-and-tumble; suddenly out
of nowhere Conboy's fist caught him on the head and the explosion
of it lighted his brain brilliantly and he felt himself spin away
and go backward. He never knew when he hit the floor.</p>

<p>When he awoke he had a thundering headache and a sick
hollowness in his belly. There was a stillness in the saloon and
out of the stillness a man said: "That patrol will be back here
in a minute. Maybe we had better carry him."</p>

<p>He couldn't see who did the talking, but he said: "Damned if
you will," and rolled and put the palms of his hands on the
floor, pushing himself up. Then he heard Donovan's husky,
gravelly voice close by. "Now that's the lad. Professor. A drink
will fix it, and we've just got time for one."</p>

<p>He stood up with the help of Donovan's arm. Donovan's face was
a shimmering object behind a fog; it moved gradually out of the
fog and became clear. Looking around him he saw A Company's men,
worse for the wear and tear of a hard brawl; but he saw L's
troopers here too. The affair seemed to be over and no bad
feelings left. He spotted Conboy at the bar, both elbows hooked
to its edge. Conboy's face was still red and he looked tired.
Shafter walked over to his blouse and overcoat and put them on,
feeling the pull of his sore places; the ache of his head pounded
steadily on.</p>

<p>McDermott slapped the bar with his palm. "Let's get that
drink, boys. We can't hold off that patrol all night."</p>

<p>"Conboy," said Shafter, "what'd you hit me with?"</p>

<p>"Me hand, damn you," said Conboy, morosely. He swung himself
around to the bar and leaned on it, a tired man and a disgruntled
one. Donovan stood by Shafter, feeling good.</p>

<p>"Next time, Conboy, he'll lick you."</p>

<p>"Will he," said Conboy, sourly. "Will he indeed?"</p>

<p>"A month's pay he will," said Donovan.</p>

<p>Conboy gave Donovan a pale and dismal stare and downed his
whisky at a toss and looked dourly at the empty glass. "A man's a
fool to be doin' this thing forever."</p>

<p>This crowd was tired, the ferment spilled out of it in one
sudden climax of brawling; but it was cheerful. Troopers stood
along the bar shoulder to shoulder and drank the cheap Stud Horse
whisky in content while the houseman bitterly complained.</p>

<p>"Who's payin' for those tables? Who's in charge here? By God,
I'll go over to the fort tomorrow."</p>

<p>Conboy turned his sour glance to Shafter. "What's the
'Professor' for?"</p>

<p>"Just a jackleg title," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"You'll do," said Conboy grudgingly. "I had to work for that
hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Donovan gave him a look. "What hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>There was a man beside Conboy, a trooper with a dandy's
haircut and a weakly handsome face; and this one said softly to
Conboy, "Shut up, Conboy."</p>

<p>McDermott had gone out of the saloon, and now came hurriedly
back. "Back door&mdash;back door. Patrol's comin'."</p>

<p>The troopers made a run for the saloon's rear doorways and
went scrambling into the darkness; out front the sergeant of the
patrol made an unnecessary racket with his command. "Patrol,
halt! Patrol at ease! Jackson, you go over to the City of Paris
while I see if everything's clear in the Stud Horse!" His voice
carried clearly through the misty, cold night; it was a
fire-alarm warning to everybody before him, as he knew it would be.
Donovan caught Shafter's arm. "Come on, Professor. No use causin'
Hackett any trouble."</p>

<p>"Donovan," said Shafter. "Who was the slick one with
Conboy?"</p>

<p>"Him? That's Lieutenant Garnett's striker. Purple's his
name."</p>

<p>McDermott herded his band together, softly grumbling: "Follow
me," and led the way down the bluff and across the sandy lowlands
to the river. Lovelace trotted into the darkness and presently
called: "Down here." Following his voice, the A Company
detachment came upon two boats drawn upon the beach. "Six to a
boat," said McDermott. "Pile in."</p>

<p>They shoved the boats into the water, troopers wading out and
climbing aboard. These boats were average size and the weight of
six troopers pulled them down until the oarlocks were a bare six
inches above the water. Donovan had the oars in Shafter's boat
and he swore placidly at the troopers crouched on the bottom.
"How the hell can I brace my legs?" There was a steady wind out
of the north&mdash;the cold all-day wind with its bite of winter;
as soon as they cleared the beach small waves began to lick
against them. McDermott said: "Don't get this damned thing
broadside, Donovan, or we'll swamp."</p>

<p>"Say," said Corporal Bierss, "can anybody swim?"</p>

<p>Nobody answered him. The laden boat rose sluggishly with the
swells but never quite made the summit; water broke at the bow
and sprayed inboard. Somebody let out a yell. "Fine," said
Bierss, "I'm glad one man can walk home if we sink."</p>

<p>"Listen," said somebody else in an uneasy voice, "let's go
back."</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Bierss. "Other people want to enjoy the
music."</p>

<p>"What music?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Bierss, "the fiddles of heaven are playing."</p>

<p>Donovan had the nose slightly swung toward the west bank and
therefore the waves, coming close upon each other in this narrow
stretch of water took the boat on the quarter and gave it a
twisting, heaving motion. The fog had closed densely in, shutting
off the lights from the fort, the Point, and the stars. The
second boat had disappeared and the sound of the troopers in it
faded somewhere downstream. They were in a black gut that had no
direction, with the wind beating down the river's shallow canyon
and the boat wallowing. The Missouri came aboard in flat sheets
and somebody stirred, and drew protest from McDermott.</p>

<p>"Lie still."</p>

<p>Bierss said in his idle, unexcitable voice: "If anybody gets
sick on this packet, just remember which way the wind blows."</p>

<p>"We ought to be near shore. How wide is this damned
creek?"</p>

<p>"It runs from bank to bank," drawled Bierss. "But my mother
always liked to say that no river was as wide as it looked and no
chore as hard as it seemed."</p>

<p>"Was she ever on the Missouri in the middle of the night with
a bunch of drunks?"</p>

<p>Lovelace spoke up, distinguishable to Shafter by his more
careful use of words. "Next time I think I could lick that
fellow."</p>

<p>Four men spoke up practically in unison. "You licked him this
time."</p>

<p>There was a silence, and then Lovelace said in a surprised,
greatly elated voice: "Did I? Did I really lick him? You know, he
wasn't a bad fellow."</p>

<p>"Why," said Bierss, "none of 'em are bad after you've had a
fight with them."</p>

<p>Donovan had said nothing all this while, being full of labor
at the oars and extremely careful in his management of the boat.
Now suddenly either his vigilance wavered or the wind swung a
curler from a broader angle, for the boat rose on its side, took
the shock of the wave's wallop nearly broadside and went
teetering into a trough. It dipped into the river like a bucket,
whereupon one trooper lifted himself off the floor and further
unbalanced the boat. There was a moment of real danger. Shafter
felt the craft sink and felt it grow unmanageable. Water rolled
back and forth along the bottom.</p>

<p>"Bierss and Mack," he said, "overboard and hang on." He was at
the bow and swung and straddled it and let himself into the
river, hanging to the bow's point. He heard Bierss say
cheerfully: "Nature's own way of taking a bath." Shafter felt the
boat lighten as it lost something like five hundred pounds of
load. "Donovan," he called, "you can't row upstream with the
three of us dragging. Just keep the nose angling toward the bank
and let the current set you over." He went under as a wave broke
across the bow&mdash;and he came up spitting. Wind made a
sibilant rough sound on the river. Bierss was saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"...and so Reginald said to Mary, 'Will you walk hand and hand
down life's pathway with me?' And so she did and her oldest son
grew up to join the cavalry. Donovan, stop long enough for me to
shake the water out of my boots."</p>

<p>"It ain't so damned funny," grumbled somebody.</p>

<p>There was a dull crystal glow above them, which would be the
fort lights coming through the fog, and the waves had lost force.
Donovan rowed steadily and a last curler broke over Shafter's
head, the muddiness of it making a taste in his mouth. Now with
calmer water, Donovan swung the nose of the craft and headed
directly for shore, and presently Shafter felt bottom beneath his
feet. He walked into shallower water, pulling the boat with
him.</p>

<p>The troopers got out and hauled the boat to dry land while
McDermott murmured, "Wait," and disappeared in the downstream
darkness. Donovan also moved away and in a little while returned.
"We're half a mile below Post Ten." Somewhat later McDermott came
back with the troopers who had been in the other boat.</p>

<p>"This river," said Donovan thoughtfully, "ain't anything to
fool with. I never did like water."</p>

<p>The party walked upstream into the cutting wind. Shafter felt
coldness slice through him; water drained down his body and
collected in his boots and his boots squealed as he stepped
forward. After ten minutes of this forward groping McDermott
whispered back: "Follow me," and tackled the bluff.</p>

<p>They moved Indian file to the bluff's edge and lay flat,
waiting the sentry's passage. It was now past taps with the
lights of barracks darkened, but a glow came on from Officers'
Row and from the buildings scattered outside the post proper. A
shape emerged from the misty blackness, paused and faced the
river. McDermott waited a decent interval and then called softly
forward:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For God's sakes, Killen, move on to the end of your post.
We're cold."</p>

<p>The sentry growled: "Keep your mouth shut. You want me to
violate the articles of war?" He walked into the darkness.</p>

<p>The file of troopers rose up, passed the stables and crept to
the rear of the barrack. McDermott opened the door and led the
way into the room's warm darkness; one by one the troopers groped
to their bunks, the sound of waterlogged boots betraying them.
Shafter stripped naked, laid his clothes at the foot of the bunk
and slid into his blankets.</p>

<p>The night was over, leaving him with his bruises and his
headache; the left side of his face was numb from the last blow
landed by Conboy. Otherwise he felt content, relieved of his
cares and made sweet again by the swift burning-out of excess
energy; all through the barrack he heard men whispering and the
soft laughter of troopers as they remembered back&mdash;and this
sound was a good sound and gave him peace.</p>

<p>Then he recalled Conboy's hundred-dollar chore and realized it
was Garnett who had offered the money to have Conboy cut him into
ribbons; he had been tired but now he lay long awake, his fresh
hatred rising. He was still awake when Hines stepped from the
orderly room with a lantern and played its light upon the row of
bunks; he had stayed discreetly away until he was certain of the
party's return and now, like an indulgent father, came to see if
all were accounted for.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; WORD FROM THE
PAST</h2>

<p class="first">ONE day, the restless Custer took his wife and
brother Tom east for winter; he took with him also the driving
energy which whipped the regiment's temper, so that without his
presence the Seventh settled into a slower routine. Early winter
rains slashed out of slate-colored skies lifting the Missouri a
full five feet and driftwood wheeled down the river's mud-greasy
surface while the quickening current began to undercut the
crumbling bluffs. Standing near A Company's stable, Shafter
watched huge sections of earth crash into the water and send
small tidal waves onward. Two soldiers were caught in a squall
while crossing from the Point and were never seen again. Three
babies were born within the post and a sergeant's wife on
Laundress Row committed suicide.</p>

<p>Continued reports of disaffection came from the various Indian
agencies. Runners arrived with news that the Sioux, half starved
for want of enough government-issued beef, were beginning to
leave the reservations and return to their own lands westward.
The Seventh, now under Reno, scouted steadily in that direction
to turn stragglers back, but it was like spreading a net against
the wind. The spirit of revolt and resistance was a growing thing
throughout the Indian bands as Sitting Bull's couriers traveled
from village to village. Near the end of November Calhoun and
thirty men had a brush with a fleeing party of Sioux on the Heart
River in which one trooper was injured; the Sioux disappeared in
the darkness.</p>

<p>A hundred recruits arrived from Jefferson Barracks to fill the
Seventh's thin ranks. Lieutenant Benny Hodgson, about to
surrender his commission and return to civil life, decided to
stay through the summer campaign which he felt to be coming, and
was made battalion adjutant under Reno. Young Jim Sturgis, the
colonel's son, newly minted from West Point, joined his father's
regiment and was attached to M Company quartered at Rice. There
was the rumor of a War Department scandal coming out of the East
as well as half-verified news of army plans being laid by Grant
and Sherman and Sheridan for a winter campaign to crush the
Sioux. Custer, the post learned, was in New York, being feted and
dined and enjoying the company of that great Shakespearean actor
Lawrence Barrett. General Terry, the department commander at St.
Paul, sent on urgent orders for the Seventh to overhaul its
equipment and to whip its recruits into shape as rapidly as
possible; whereby on the windy bitter mornings the troops went
through their monotonous evolutions on the parade, marched
outside the fort for rifle-range practice, and daily scouted
westward. Freighters broke the first light snowfall with supplies
for the quartermaster and commissary depots on the reservation.
Miners began to stream back from the Black Hills, forced out by
weather and by the fear of Sioux revenge in the spring. The
<i>Far West</i>, Captain Grant Marsh commanding, came downriver
and stopped briefly to report he had been fired on four times in
four days along the upper stretches of the Missouri. On December
6 the telegraph flashed news from the East that couriers would be
sent out to instruct the recalcitrant Sioux to come into the
reservations by January 31, or be treated thereafter as hostiles.
That same day the first hard blizzard swept out of the north and
pounded Lincoln for thirty-six hours, marking the end of train
service from the East until spring.</p>

<p>First Sergeant Hines opened the orderly room directly after
morning sick call and waggled a finger at Shafter. When he
reached the room, Shafter found Captain Moylan at the little desk
with a letter in his hand. The captain said: "Hines, step out a
moment," and waited until the old sergeant had gone.</p>

<p>"Kern," said Moylan, and nodded at the letter, "this came to
headquarters three or four days ago. Cooke gave it to me to
handle as I saw fit." He handed it to Shafter and he sat back to
watch Shafter's face as the latter looked down on the single page
with its scent so familiar, with its light quick
handwriting:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">
<span class="smcap">The Commanding Officer</span>,<br>
Seventh Cavalry,<br>
Fort Lincoln, D.T.</p>

<p class="letter">As a particular favor to one who is vitally interested
 in knowing the whereabouts of Kern Shafter, is he a member of your
regiment?</p>

<p class="letter">Very truly,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">
Alice Macdougall</span>.</p>

<p><br>
The scent raced across the years and the sight of that
handwriting made him vividly remember the smiling and the
laughter and the love that once had been without bottom or
boundary. Her personality was a fire glowing against the
blackness of time; her voice was a light bell stroking its melody
through long emptiness, rousing his memories so fully that the
hurt of all that had been was a physical pain. He folded the page
into smaller and smaller squares, tore it across, and dropped the
pieces into the iron stove in the middle of the orderly room.</p>

<p>"No answer?" asked Moylan.</p>

<p>Shafter turned his head slowly from side to side. "None at
all."</p>

<p>"I remember her very distinctly," said Moylan. "Last time was
behind the lines at Fredericksburg." He sat idle, a heavy,
sandy-haired, bluff-featured man with memories in turn sweet and acid.
"You were the officer then, and I was the sergeant. Very odd to
recall. You've never seen her since?"</p>

<p>"Once," said Shafter. "Once in Baltimore."</p>

<p>The captain said in a careful way: "I always wondered one
thing. Did Garnett marry her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"God damn him," growled the captain, "he's got a lot to answer
for on Judgment Day." He looked up. "She still remembers you. Is
this the first time you've heard of her&mdash;since
Baltimore?"</p>

<p>"No," said Shafter. "I have heard indirectly of her many
times. She has spent a fortune tracing me."</p>

<p>"She has a fortune to spend," said Moylan.</p>

<p>"She always had everything she wanted," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Until she met Garnett," amended Moylan. "Then she had
nothing." He sat heavily in thought, and at last shook his head.
"It didn't take her long to find out she guessed wrong, did it?
She has apparently been sorry for ten years&mdash;and wishes to
see you. That's a long time for a woman to regret a thing.
Doesn't it have any effect on you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Shafter.</p>

<p>Moylan looked at Shafter with steady attention. "It is logical
that you should hate Garnett. He'll not be easy with you around
here. He'll use his weight on you where he can. He's already
tried, has he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Shafter. "But that can work both ways, Myles."</p>

<p>"Do nothing you'll regret."</p>

<p>"Regret?" said Shafter and gave the captain a metal-sharp
glance. "If it were in my power to put a bullet through his
heart, I'd have no regrets."</p>

<p>"That is not what I meant," said Moylan. "He ruined you
professionally once. Do not open yourself to that again by any
act."</p>

<p>Shafter said nothing and the captain knew the man well enough
to realize his words made no effect on one who, ten years before,
had been a wild and headlong kind of warrior. The intervening
years had settled Shafter, had given him some wisdom and some
tolerance; it had not changed his essential character at all. He
was now what he had always been, the proof of it being his return
to soldiering after long absence. That caused Moylan a
question.</p>

<p>"What brought you back to the uniform, Kern?"</p>

<p>"I was never very happy out of it."</p>

<p>"The old songs, the old bugle calls, the old
duties&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not sentiment, Myles. I'm a little old for that, and a little
too jaded to be romantic. Maybe I got tired of being my own man
doing whatever I pleased, and therefore doing nothing."</p>

<p>"I know you better," said Moylan. "The answer is that
soldiering was your lot, as it is to some men more than others.
The dust and misery of it, and the content of it as well. The
romance of soldiering, of course, is all nonsense in the hands of
civilians who know no better. The real part of soldiering is a
thing they never know&mdash;to come off a scout dirty and frozen
to the bone&mdash;and to sit at night in comfort and to know
you've done a day's good work, and that other men around you have
done it, too." He stopped his talking, looked down at his broad
hands, and said in a different voice: "We've got need of a
sergeant to ride the mail. I told Cooke I had the man for it. You
are the man."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Shafter and smiled a little. "You want me out
of the post this winter."</p>

<p>"I want no collision between you and Garnett," said Moylan.
"Report to Cooke for further instructions. You're listed on A's
roster as detached beginning today."</p>

<p>He sat back after Shafter had gone. Hines returned and set
about the ritual of paper work. Moylan said: "I gave him the
job."</p>

<p>"Does he know about bad weather?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Moylan and drew a piece of paper before him. He
dipped the pen and stroked the corners of his mustaches for a
moment and then began:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>:

</p><p class="letter">It would require the colonel's approval to
carry this matter to the adjutant general's attention. Therefore,
I write directly to you as an old friend, to bring to your
attention the case of Kern Shafter, once an officer of the
Fourteenth Ohio...</p>

<br>

<p>"Captain," said Hines, "is there a feelin' between Shafter and
the Lieutenant Garnett?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"It is information among the boys that Garnett paid Conboy a
hundred dollars to bruise up the lad."</p>

<p>Moylan grumbled in his throat and sat heavy at the table, his
silence giving Hines assent. Hines said discreetly: "There are
other things, regardin' the Lieutenant's habits&mdash;"</p>

<p>Moylan swung about. He stared at Hines. "A woman?"</p>

<p>"A woman."</p>

<p>"I know about that," said Moylan. "But keep your mouth shut,
Hines."</p>

<p>Shafter pulled on his heavy coat and Berlin mittens and moved
into the white outer world. The wind, driving from the north, had
banked all exposed walls of the post eave-high with snow, had
laid a two-foot covering across the parade. The roofs of the
buildings were puffed up like thatched cottages, the glittering
white surface broken only by the dark smudge of chimney. The wind
which at the height of the storm had blown at a sixty-mile rate
had ceased entirely so that the post had a dampered stillness
across which the voices of men carried with a lively sharpness.
Shafter moved along the narrow shoulder-high lane carved out by
the shovel details, and reported to the adjutant's office. Cooke
gave him his instructions.</p>

<p>"You'll have a sleigh and two mules and a week's rations.
You'll eat and be quartered along the route, but the rations will
be for emergency if you get snowed in anywhere. The round trip to
Fargo is approximately two weeks, depending on weather. You'll be
wise to follow the railroad closely. You can't see the track but
the telegraph poles will always guide you. Here is a list of
ranches and shelters along the way. Better spend the morning
picking your team and putting your storm pack together. Draw on
the quartermaster for extra robes and blankets. Leave at reveille
tomorrow. Get the pouches at the fort's post office and drop back
here for special despatches. You'll also take the outgoing mail
from Bismarck. That is a courtesy to the town. I have no more to
add, except that you should watch your weather most closely.
Sometimes you'll never have more than an hour's warning of a
blizzard."</p>

<p>Shafter saluted and left the adjutant's office, going out to
the big mule barn behind the post to pick a team. He spent an
hour doing this, and the rest of the morning stowing the sleigh.
Then, with nothing more on his mind and being his own master
while on detached duty, he hitched his mules to the sleigh and
left the fort for a trial run. In the middle of the afternoon he
drew up before Josephine Russell's house and saw her come to the
door.</p>

<p>"If you're staying awhile," she called, "drive your outfit
into the barn."</p>

<p>He circled the house, left the team and sleigh tied in the
barn's runway, and struggled back to the house. The snow was
fresh and needed both settling and hardening in order to make
decent footing for the mules; a cold night, he thought, ought to
put it in shape. He slid out of his heavy coat in the room's
warmth and stood with his back to the heater's isinglass windows,
watching Josephine's clever hands work at her knitting needles.
She sat near a window for the sake of the light, her face now
lifting to him, now dropping to her work. She had on a dress the
color of dark roses, with a large cameo brooch pinned at the
neck; and she seemed pleased with his presence. There were
certain things which always gave a woman a cozy, demure air;
knitting, he decided, was one of those things.</p>

<p>"What's your errand today, Kern?"</p>

<p>"Just trying out a pair of mules, for the Fargo mail run."</p>

<p>She stopped her work to give him a serious appraisal. "Did you
put in for that?"</p>

<p>"It was assigned to me, but I have no objections."</p>

<p>Her smile came quickly up through the soberness of her face,
giving it warmth and charm. He watched her lips softly change.
"No," she said, "you wouldn't object. When I first met you, Kern,
I thought you were a very sophisticated character. In fact I
thought perhaps you were of the faded gentleman type. When I
heard you had joined the Seventh I thought, 'There goes a man
with delusions of romantic adventure.'" She smiled again to
remove whatever sting there might have been in her words. "But
you have done very well for yourself. Is that little purple spot
on your temple the place Conboy hit you?"</p>

<p>"Who tells you of these things, Josephine?"</p>

<p>"An army post is the biggest whispering gallery on earth."</p>

<p>"I got knocked out," he said and stretched his feet before
him, loose in the chair and very comfortable. The girl went about
her knitting, her head bent. She had turned sober again and he
thought she held some displeasure of him behind her silence.
After a little while she murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do the women look like in that place?"</p>

<p>He came to his own defense immediately. "Do you think my
tastes are on that level?"</p>

<p>"Then what were you there for?" she asked, and looked at him
with sharp criticism.</p>

<p>"It was a little family affair between A and L Companies," he
said. "The boys asked me to join the party." He thought it over
and added: "You could call it my initiation into the troop."</p>

<p>She held herself still, once more debating him in her mind.
"The opinion of other men means a great deal to you, Kern."</p>

<p>"The opinion of my kind of men," he amended.</p>

<p>"Are they your kind?" she asked. "The ones you bunk with and
march with? Are they really?"</p>

<p>"That's why I joined," he said. "To get back where I
belong."</p>

<p>She shook her head, murmuring, "You're strange," and resumed
her knitting. "You've had education and many pleasant things, but
you go back to a raw and very rough kind of life. Doesn't it
cause you any remorse to give up those nice things?"</p>

<p>He sat silent, turning it over in his own mind. Nothing had
bothered him since joining, no regrets and no moments of
indecision. He remembered now that he had felt at home when he
stepped onto Fort Lincoln's parade; weight and care had fallen
from him, and the feeling of emptiness within him had somehow
been filled. Not one day since that time had he lacked peace of
mind.</p>

<p>"You are thinking that I'm ducking out of civil life because
it was too hard&mdash;letting the government do my thinking in
return for eighteen dollars a month."</p>

<p>"It has occurred to me," she said.</p>

<p>"I had no obligations in civil life," he told her. "I had
nothing&mdash;and I knew it. A man must feel he belongs to
something. As long as he floats around space doing little chores
that start and end with his hands and never reach his heart, he's
no good to himself. Some things are real and some are only tinsel
paper that people wrap themselves in, having nothing more
important to do with their time. Dust is an honest thing, and so
is sweat and the bruises you get from fighting."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose these other troopers think of that?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Some do and some don't. Some are good and some are pretty
bad. But the point is that when the trumpet blows boots and
saddles, they'll all swing up together, and when action begins
they'll run forward together. That is what men were made for,
Josephine."</p>

<p>She held her eyes down to her work while he talked; she kept
them there. Shafter sank low in the chair, the back of his hair
ruffled against it and his body sprawled in lank and bony lines.
He watched her fingers move with the knitting needles, making
little half circles of gracefulness. Small shades of expression
softly darkened and softly lightened her face and her lips made
their elusive changes as her thinking varied. He got up to fill
the stove and noticed that the woodbox was empty; he left the
house and got an armload of wood and brought it back. The silence
of the house was a pleasant silence; he tipped his head, watching
the ceiling, listening to the ticking of a clock. Now and then an
echo from Bismarck's main street reached out.</p>

<p>"How old are you, Kern?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-two."</p>

<p>Her knitting needles wove in and out beneath her absorbed
eyes, her profile against the strong light of the window was
full-lipped and serene.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been married?"</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"Engaged?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you now?"</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>She laid down her knitting and let her hands lie idle in her
lap while she gave him an exacting appraisal. She was thoroughly
serious, wholly wrapped up by her momentary interest in him. "It
was something painful, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>He nodded and let that serve for an answer. Her glance
searched all the way through him, and presently she shook her
head and took up her knitting again, speaking as much to herself
as to him. "It has left its effect. It isn't that you are cynical
about women. I've never caught that in your talk, but you
distrust women. You look at them as though they had qualities
which men should be on guard against."</p>

<p>"Women," he said in his idle, speculative way, "are the only
real beauty in the world. What good is a lovely sunset if a man
can't embrace it? There is a need in him that neither sky nor
earth nor music can fill. Only a woman can fill it."</p>

<p>She murmured: "You say that as if you believed it but didn't
want to believe it."</p>

<p>"A woman is a wind, wild and sweet. A woman is a song. I have
never thought differently."</p>

<p>"Kern," she said, "your trouble was that you wanted too much.
No woman can be all that."</p>

<p>"There are rare meetings like that&mdash;of a man carrying to
a woman all that he feels and needs, and receiving from her all
that he hoped for."</p>

<p>"You have been deeply disappointed," she said.</p>

<p>"A man's not entitled to disappointment," he said. "The fault
is more apt to be in him than in the woman. Therefore, he draws
back and forgets about it."</p>

<p>"You have not forgotten."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten that I was a fool," he said, quite
careful with his words. "I will not be a fool twice."</p>

<p>She kept her attention on her knitting, her mouth drawn
together in almost severe lines. She made no attempt to break the
silence; she seemed done with him. Presently, in a little gesture
of impatience, she put the needlework aside and rose and went
into the kitchen. He heard her call back:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When does A Company have its ball for the enlisted men?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks away, I believe,"</p>

<p>"It will remind you of other days."</p>

<p>"I had no intention of attending," he said.</p>

<p>She came out in a little while with a cup of coffee for him,
and one for herself. She took her chair again. "One stretch of
road between here and Fargo you'll want to watch. There's no
shelter of any kind for thirty miles if a blizzard should catch
you. It is between Romain's ranch and a little section house
called Fossil Siding. When do you leave&mdash;when will you be
back?"</p>

<p>"Leave in the morning. Should return in ten or twelve days
unless the weather stops me."</p>

<p>She put her coffee cup aside and rose and stood at the window
with her back to him. Her shoulders were square but rounded
softly at the points and her black hair lay rolled and heavy on
her head. She touched the pane idly and turned to him, looking
across the room with a restless light in her eyes. He sat still,
meeting her glance and seeing the shadow and shape of odd things
come and vanish. She wasn't smiling but the thought of a smile
was a hint at the corners of her mouth, in the tilt of her head.
She took his coffee cup and went into the kitchen. He heard her
move and then stand still; and suddenly his mind was fully on her
and the thought of her went through him and kicked up its
reaction. He got up and reached for his coat.</p>

<p>"This is a lazy man's life."</p>

<p>She came into the living room. "Have supper here."</p>

<p>"There's the team on my hands. Otherwise I'd accept."</p>

<p>She watched him button up the big overcoat and grow bulky. His
shoulders made a sweep and the uniform took much of the
first-noticed softness from him, toughening him. She noticed the scars
on his knuckles.</p>

<p>"So you had your fight and crossed the river on a dark, rough
night&mdash;and almost swamped. Is that what you like?"</p>

<p>He grinned. "That's what I like," he said. "It was a good
party."</p>

<p>"I haven't been to a dance since early fall," she
murmured.</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment. "It's strictly an enlisted man's
ball. No officers and officers' ladies."</p>

<p>"So then?"</p>

<p>"You're for gentlemen and officers, Josephine."</p>

<p>"Am I?" she asked him, coolly meeting his attention. "How do
you know that?"</p>

<p>He saw in her at that moment a reckless spirit. She had wanted
something and she had asked for it; her eyes held his glance,
with the hint of a temper as aggressive as his own. He said: "I
can't be put in the position of refusing a lady's wish. Will you
go to the ball with me?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she said.</p>

<p>She was smiling slightly, knowing what she had done to him,
knowing also the boldness of her asking. He moved to the door and
turned there; she was alert, she was carefully exploring his face
with her eyes for things she seemed to want to know. "You gave
yourself away," she told him. "If you weren't a gentleman it
wouldn't have been difficult to refuse me."</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said, "I really wanted to take you." But he shook
his head at her. "It is not a good thing for you. It will cut you
out from being invited to officers' dances. When you let yourself
be seen with an enlisted man, you are crossing one of the
toughest boundaries in the world."</p>

<p>She started to tell him something, thought better of it, and
moved around him to open the door. Then she said: "You are a
rough-and-tumble man, Sergeant. But I think I can hold my own
with you."</p>

<p>He grinned as he lifted his cap, and then went into the snow,
openly laughing, and presently curled around the house with the
sleigh. She was on the front porch and waved at him as he went
by. She stood a considerable while in the biting, still air, now
wishing she had told Shafter that Garnett had invited her to
officers' bail and that she had accepted. It was the reason she
had deliberately forced an invitation to the enlisted men's bail
from Shafter. She knew, as a matter of intuition, that he
disliked the officer. This, then, was her way of balancing the
situation, of taking the edge from any resentment he might feel
toward her for going with Garnett.</p>

<p>She turned into the house and closed the door, and stood with
her back to it. "Why should I bother to go to the trouble of
saving his feelings? What do his feelings matter to me? I am
simply another woman he means to keep at a proper distance."</p>

<p>She remembered all that he had said, and she knew much that he
had not said&mdash;the streaks of hopelessness and resentment,
the imagination that he could not entirely subdue, the hunger
that no amount of self-discipline could kill. He had partly given
himself away, she realized. "The woman," she thought, "left her
marks all over him. She must have been brutal about it, to
produce his present state of mind. Yet even now he is not sure he
doesn't love her. That's behind it all."</p>

<p>She moved across the room, despising the woman, whoever she
was; ashamed of the woman, and outraged at a story she could only
guess at.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; MR. GARNETT TRIES HIS
LUCK</h2>

<p class="first">AT reveille he was up; by eight o'clock he had
put the fort and the river behind him. There was a hundred pounds
of mail in the sleigh, a week's emergency rations and a roll of
bedding, and extra grain for the mules. Bismarck dropped behind a
steel-gray winter haze&mdash;its housetops and its little winding
columns of smoke; ahead of him stretched a white smoothness
broken only by the line of telegraph poles and, at great
intervals, the low-lying smudge of a ranch house. That first day
out he saw several of these ranches; and put up at one of them
that night. The second day brought a duller sky and a greater
emptiness. The mules went steadily on, hauling the sleigh at a
brisk clip where the snow lay thoroughly hardened by alternate
freezing and thawing. When they reached soft patches the team
fell to a slow, exhausting struggle. He passed two houses on the
second day; on the third, he ran almost his whole trip with
nothing in sight but the telegraph poles. He crossed little
creeks frozen to the bottom, he flushed small bands of antelopes
and saw where they had scratched away the snow for forage. The
fourth day he came upon a party of warriors cutting out of the
north on a hunting trip; they saw him and advanced until they
identified his uniform and then turned away, sending back their
insolent cries. The fifth evening brought him to a stalled
freight train waiting for a snowplow; he stayed that night in the
train's caboose, stabling the mules in an abandoned sod hut. The
following afternoon, passing close-grouped farms, he came into
Fargo&mdash;which was only another version of Bismarck. By
daybreak the following morning he was on his way back, bearing
not only mail but several packages for Bismarck merchants and a
little pouch of despatches from department headquarters at St.
Paul.</p>

<p>He brought with him also a week's collection of newspapers and
read them at night, in one ranch house or another. President
Grant had taken the Indian matter into his hands and had ordered
a winter campaign to follow the failure of the Indians to return
peacefully to their reservations on the deadline of January 31.
One headline said: CUSTER WILL LEAD WINTER EXPEDITION. CAN BOY
GENERAL REPEAT BRILLIANT WASHITA STRATEGY? The <i>New York
Tribune</i> had a long and tempered essay on the ills and evils
of Indian affairs, deplored the instances of corruption and
misdealing which had characterized so much of white relations
with the savage, but sadly concluded that the march of white
man's progress could not be stopped, therefore making rigorous
treatment of the Indian the most humane in the long run. The
<i>Boston Post</i> bitterly assailed the greed of the white man
and the white man's consistent disregard of his obligations.</p>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">The history of relations between white man
and red has been an unbroken story of rapacity, cruelty and of
complete lack of feeling on the part of the white. Nothing has
been constant with him except his sacred right to seize whatever
land he wished from whatever Indian tribe he wished. We have no
reason to be proud of our dealings with the weaker savage race.
We have no right to call ourselves a civilized or cultured people
with that record against us.</p>
<br>

<p>But the <i>St. Louts Globe</i> reflected the view of the
western settler and trader and land-hungry emigrant.</p>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">There is no use entering into a discussion
of the morals of the white man versus the red man. All the debate
in Christendom cannot blink the fact that the white man is a
surging tide of conquest, of settlement and progress, whereas the
Indian is content to rove nomadically across the land as he has
done for the tens of thousands of years, ignoring an earth which
could provide him riches were he industrious enough to cultivate
it. Primitive indolence and barbaric narrowness is his character,
nor does he wish for anything we call civilization. Let us not
shed tears over the ills done poor Lo. Poor Lo has been at the
business of killing and raiding and stealing for many centuries
before the white man came. It is his one great object in life, it
is his profession and his pastime. Whereas a white boy is taught
to believe that the purpose of a man is scientific and literary
and social advancement, the one and only training an Indian boy
ever receives is to go out and kill his enemy, thereby becoming
great in his own tribe. Were the race of the Indian to die off
tomorrow there would be no permanent handiwork behind him, no
inventions, no scholarship except a few primitive daubs on this
or that rock, no system of ethics at all, not one worthy thing to
justify his tenantry upon the fairest of all continents. By
contrast look upon the white man's record in a brief 250 years
here. That should be answer enough to all the silly
sentimentality current in the East. It is time now to end the
endless marching and countermarching of skeleton cavalry columns
commanded by officers who know nothing of savage warfare. It is
time now to send in one large and determined expedition to crush
savage resistance permanently and to confine the red man to the
reservation, so that at last the white race may get on with its
appointed destiny, which is to harness the continent and to build
civilization's network across it.</p>

<p><br>
The system of post traderships was under fire and Congressman
Clymer had asked the House for authority to investigate the
Indian Bureau and the War Department, suggesting scandal.
Secretary of War Belknap was quoted as saying that yellow
journalism made a mockery of an honest man's attempt at efficient
administration. There was definitely, in all the papers, a
growing preoccupation with the Indian question&mdash;and a
growing scent of trouble brewing. There were also many items
regarding Custer. He had given a talk at the Lotus Club. His
spectacular presence was noted and admired at the theater.</p>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">Custer [said the <i>New York Herald</i>] has
as much right as any man living to speak of Indians. His
statement that one regiment of cavalry&mdash;with pardonable
pride he mentions his own Seventh&mdash;could handle the Sioux in
one campaign as effectively as ten years of treaty making and
treaty breaking, must be seriously regarded. In any such
campaign, who else has the skill, the matchless daring to equal
his leadership? The Boy General of 1864 is now the mature Indian
fighter, the darling of his troops, and in the full prime of his
great powers.</p>

<p><br>
There was the smell of bad weather in the air as Shafter moved
westward over the empty, dull-glittering plain toward
Lincoln.</p>

<p><br>
THEY had been to see "Julius Caesar," played by
their closest friend, Lawrence Barrett; and afterwards they had
gone up to a mansion facing Central Park where, surrounded by
money and power and considerable beauty, Custer had dominated the
conversation both by his exuberance and by his reputation. Now,
at two o'clock in the morning, the general and his wife returned
to their hotel rooms.</p>

<p>The general was keyed up by the fullness of the evening, and
at the mercy of his inexhaustible energy; he flung his hat and
cape and dress coat the full length of the room and missed the
chair at which he aimed. He let them lie and walked a circle of
the sitting room while his wife went into the adjoining
bedroom.</p>

<p>"Vacation's about gone, old girl," he called out. "We're
coming to the end of our period in heaven."</p>

<p>"I'll regret going back," she said. "I've had such a nice
time. And you've enjoyed yourself so much."</p>

<p>"No more shows, no more parties for another year. Maybe for
two or three years. The army is a strange thing. A little glitter
at retreat when the band plays and everybody's in full dress. A
little of that followed by hours of drudgery and tedium. It is
the tedium that eats out an officer's heart. Year after year of
it."</p>

<p>She came out to him in her robe. "Autie, you shouldn't be
restless. We've had such a good time. It's nice to have a famous
husband. We're welcome in the homes of the rich, the powerful,
the artistic, the intelligent. George Armstrong Custer rings the
bell and the door opens. I thought of that tonight, watching you
talk. I was very proud of you."</p>

<p>He looked at her, he smiled at her; he stood in a moment's
rare repose, gentled by her softness, by her love. But it was
only for a moment. He had supped at the table of the mighty, and
the mighty had been deferent to him because he was General
Custer; now he saw that ended as he turned back to his frontier
post. He saw more than that. He saw the undramatic years stretch
out ahead of him&mdash;a continuation of the long eleven years
which had followed the Civil War. And as he thought of those
years of patience and plodding and unspectacular duties
performed, he had his fear. He was a child of adventure; his fame
had come of moments of crisis and headlong action. Routine was
death to him, but he saw nothing forward but routine. He had
reached the pinnacle at twenty-five and all the subsequent years
had been anticlimax, a wasting away of those precious hours which
a man so meagerly possessed&mdash;those hours in which he had his
chance at everlasting glory. At thirty-six he was less than he
had been at twenty-five. In another ten years he would be
forty-six, one more middle-aged Civil War officer whose greatness was
only a fading memory with the people, whose place in the sun was
taken by younger men seizing their moments of luck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Libby," he said, almost groaning, "I'm in a blind alley.
There's no chance open, nothing to reach for. I see the stupid
and the dull all around me, rising above me, fawning or tricking
their way to power. My enemies are in command of the War
Department, cheating me out of chances, giving other men places I
ought to have, entrusting incompetent officers to places of
responsibility to which I'm entitled. I'm handcuffed. If there
was a break I might make, if there was an alley, an opening
anywhere, I'd seize it."</p>

<p>"Autie," said Mrs. Custer, whose softness was strength, whose
quietness was the only discipline he knew, "what more could you
want?"</p>

<p>He sighed greatly and smiled at her. He went forward and
kissed her, turned obedient and teasing. "You have a hell of a
time with me, don't you, Libby?"</p>

<p>She said: "Civilization is not too good for you. I think we
will be happier when we return to the command." But a cloud
passed across her expressive face as she remembered that spring
was not far away. Spring was her dread, spring was a black cloud
that shut out her life's sun&mdash;for spring meant campaigning,
it meant Autie marching away. Suddenly she turned back into the
bedroom.</p>

<p>Custer seized the day's paper and lay out full length on the
floor of the room to read it. He became engrossed in a front-page
story concerning Congressman Clymer's proposed investigation of
the War Department; and presently he sprang up, went to the
writing table and sat down at it. Mrs. Custer heard his pen
scratching violently through the quietness.</p>

<p>"To whom are you writing, Autie?"</p>

<p>"I'm offering my services as witness to Clymer. I think we
shall get the bottom of some scandal, and I know enough of it to
lend a hand."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, then spoke again. "Do you think it
wise?"</p>

<p>"Wise or not," he said, "I shall do it."</p>

<p>He finished his letter, addressed the envelope and sealed it;
he leaned back in the chair, feeling a thrust of hope. It might
lead somewhere; it might lead to an opportunity. It might give
him an opportunity to smash at his enemies, to bring him before
the people on an issue. It was, at least, an opening&mdash;and
openings were rare things for a frontier officer. He studied this
and grew slightly excited at the thought. He saw himself once
more in the current, as he had been before; he saw himself out of
the slack water at last. He had to have action to survive, since
action was his only gift; and survival and triumph and public
acclaim were to him the same sources of life they were to the
other public men who fought tooth and claw for them. Fame was a
jungle in which predatory beasts roamed; there were no rules in
that jungle, only a bitterest kind of fighting. And at fighting
he had considerable skill.</p>

<p><br>
GARNETT called for Josephine at eight, stood a
moment in the Russell living room to give her his full admiring
glance and murmured: "You must forgive me for using a very old
phrase. I had no idea you were so&mdash;" he paused and seemed to
search himself for the word, and went on in an impulsive
way&mdash;"so damned beautiful."</p>

<p>She was round and mature within a black dress whose solid
coloring was broken by little streaks of gold thread along her
breasts and sleeves. Her hair, extremely black, lay high and
shining on her head, exposing white neck and ears, and a pair of
earrings moved slightly as her head turned. She watched him,
smiling but not entirely taken in. "I hear you're a gallant man.
Lieutenant."</p>

<p>He gave her a keen answering smile and stood sharp-eyed before
her. The smile gradually faded. "I suppose so," he agreed. "I
suppose the presence of women inclines me toward the kind of
speech they want to hear. My feeling is that a woman living out
here, with little enough in the way of comfort or luxury, has got
something extremely fine in her soul. Even the washerwoman who
follows her sergeant from one dismal hovel to another."</p>

<p>"Particularly that woman," corrected Josephine.</p>

<p>"Gallantry or not," he said and was wholly serious, "I mean
what I say about you."</p>

<p>"It is at least pleasant to hear."</p>

<p>"And now to the ball," he said, suddenly returned to his high
humor; and escorted her to the cutter. They made a rapid passage
to the fort and came upon the commissary building, which served
as the ballroom, its stores pushed aside and its bare walls and
rafters decorated with colored paper shields, crossed arms and
bunting. The regimental band sat on a platform at one end of the
room. Major Reno, commanding in the absence of Custer, led the
grand march with his wife; afterwards the crowd broke into sets
for the quadrille.</p>

<p>The officers of the five companies stationed at Lincoln were
present in full dress uniforms, gold epaulets, sash and
regimental cord draped over the shoulder; and this color flashed
and glittered against the dresses of the ladies, and there was a
sharp exuberance in all of them, a health and a happiness and a
childlike response to one night's freedom. The Benteens and
DeRudios and Gibsons came up from Rice where H and M Companies
were stationed&mdash;and remembrances were spoken for the five
troops on far-away station&mdash;for Captain Keogh's I Company
and Captain Ilsley's E Company at Fort Tot-ten, and for B, G and
K in distant Louisiana. The regiment was a clannish thing even
though it had not been together as a complete unit for many
years; in spite of its jealousies and cliques and animosities,
the Seventh was tied together by its traditions, its decade of
service.</p>

<p>There were other townspeople, besides Josephine, at the ball;
and now and then she saw Charley Reynolds, reputed to be the best
scout in the West, come shyly inside and watch the proceedings.
He was a small man, very quiet and very soft of speech, dressed
in a neat blue suit and black tie; somewhere he had a past which
he never mentioned but his eyes were sad blue eyes above a round,
smooth face and a semicircle mustache carefully kept. Other
officers from the infantry companies stationed at the post were
likewise in attendance.</p>

<p>They danced the sets, they danced the polka, the schottische
and the waltz. Josephine went swinging away in the arms of this
officer or that one; she stood in one little group or another,
all of them gay and all charged with little bursts of gossip and
laughter and bantering. They stood at the punch
bowl&mdash;lemonade made with citric acid&mdash;they lightly
ridiculed one another, out of familiar association, repeating the
old, old jokes and the ancient recollections.</p>

<p>"I admire that dress," said Mrs. Smith to Josephine.</p>

<p>"I bought it this fall in the East. I suppose it's the last
new one I'll have for three or four years."</p>

<p>"Why," said Mrs. Smith, "I'm wearing one six years old."</p>

<p>Mrs. Calhoun smiled regretfully. "I bought this in 1869. I've
never been close enough to the East to get another. It has been
altered and let out so often that it is nothing but a mass of
thread and stitches. Miss Russell makes old women out of all of
us."</p>

<p>Annie Yates and her husband joined the group. Captain Yates
ran the back of his fingers across his yellow mustaches. "Myles,
I hear your saddler got drunk and snowbound last night."</p>

<p>Moylan nodded. "We are thawing him out one section at a
time."</p>

<p>"It shows," said Yates slyly, "what drunkenness will do for a
company."</p>

<p>Moylan grinned. "Just have your first sergeant mention it to
my first sergeant, if you want to know which outfit is the best
at indoor fighting. For recommendations, ask L Company."</p>

<p>"What about that fracas?" asked Yates, turning to Garnett.</p>

<p>Garnett gave Moylan a quick glance and met the captain's cool
attention. He flushed a little when he answered Yates. "I know
nothing of it."</p>

<p>"Quite a brawl, I heard," said Yates indifferently and moved
to his partner as the music began. Major Barrows bowed at
Josephine and led her away, leaving his wife for Garnett's
attention. Garnett put his arm about her slim waist, adjusted
himself at the proper waltz distance and swung her out upon the
floor.</p>

<p>Neither of them spoke for a considerable time, he staring over
the top of her dark hair and she watching the couples about her
with an expressionless disinterest. Now and then she caught sight
of Josephine and followed the girl with a narrowed glance, her
lips moving together by a pure reaction over which she had no
control. Finally she said in her coolest voice: "Your taste is
excellent, Edward."</p>

<p>Garnett said, equally cool, "Do you object?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>But he knew she was furious, and the knowledge pleased him. "I
wish," he murmured, "I might hold you closer."</p>

<p>"Be careful," she murmured, "my husband is watching."</p>

<p>"Does he suspect?"</p>

<p>"It is never possible to know what he thinks or what he knows,
Edward. But we must be very discreet."</p>

<p>"I shall have the cutter at the same place tomorrow
afternoon."</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, "not so soon. I can't always be finding
reasonable excuses to go to town."</p>

<p>He said nothing but when she looked up she noticed the shadow
of sulkiness on his face; the tips of her fingers dug into his
shoulder. "Don't," she whispered. "Don't, Edward."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," he said.</p>

<p>She grew coldly, politely angry with him. "You can help it
well enough to bring a very pretty girl to the ball. Don't act
out a part."</p>

<p>They danced the rest of it in complete silence, once around
the huge hall. The music found them at the far end. He took her
arm and walked her slowly back toward her husband. He looked
straight ahead of him when he spoke. "Tomorrow afternoon,
Margaret?"</p>

<p>They had almost rejoined the group when he heard her soft
smothered answer: "All right." Then she turned from him to her
husband who stood by with his usual taciturnity. She smiled at
him. "Are you having a good time, Joseph?"</p>

<p>He looked down at her in the manner with which she was so
familiar&mdash;some part of his mind and heart loving her, some
part of him grimly hanging to his iron reserve. "I always enjoy
myself when I see you having a good time."</p>

<p>She kept her eyes on him until he turned to speak to Calhoun;
and then she ventured a surreptitious side glance at Josephine
Russell, who stood beside Garnett. She hated the girl in the
proud way of a beautiful woman recognizing loveliness in another
woman; and knowing Garnett, she wondered what secrets might lie
behind Josephine's calm. Benteen came up to claim her, his cheeks
scarlet against the silver-white magnificence of his hair. Crusty
and contentious as he was, he unbent to her. "My pleasure, Mrs.
Barrows."</p>

<p>At two in the morning the ball ended and the various couples
met in one house or another for coffee and bacon, and carefully
treasured eggs long packed down in water glass. At three, Garnett
returned Josephine to her house and at her invitation stepped
inside. The elder Russell sat asleep in a rocker with a stout
fire going; and woke and moved off to bed. Garnett stood in the
middle of the room, holding his dress hat tucked under an arm,
letting his glance openly admire the girl. She removed her coat
and stood by the stove, as fresh and as awake now as she had been
seven hours before; there was a tremendous amount of vitality in
her, and a great deal of practical wisdom which now and then came
out with its faint irony, and a capacity for emotion lying well
down within her. He wondered if any man had stirred it.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Garnett, for the most delightful kind of an
evening."</p>

<p>He made a little bow with his head, still watching her with
his appreciative eyes. She turned to warm her hands at the stove
and her attitude at the moment&mdash;the straightness of her body
with its round and full outlines&mdash;kicked a hard emotion
through him. He was so interested in her that when she suddenly
turned her head she caught him with this unguarded appreciation
in his eyes; and her glance came back to him knowing what he
thought. He was a handsome creature whose judgment was critical
and therefore his interest was a flattering thing; she admitted
that to herself. He was dangerous as well&mdash;his smile, his
gallantry, and his words.</p>

<p>"Am I welcome in this house?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"I should like to pick you up for a ride in the cutter some
morning."</p>

<p>She didn't answer it; she simply nodded. He drew a breath and
walked toward her until she was within reach of him and he looked
down at her and waited for a break in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't spoil a good impression, Mr. Garnett."</p>

<p>"You're still thinking I am particularly solicitous of ladies,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "they are a challenge to your
talents."</p>

<p>Sometimes she threw him off stride by her frankness; in
moments like this, when he wished for tenderness and emotion, her
words were cold water flung in his face. He flushed somewhat. "I
find myself in a bad situation with you. I don't want you to
suspect me. Women have played their light games of flirt with me.
I have responded in kind. You seem to be aware of that."</p>

<p>"Let's not be too serious at three o'clock in the
morning."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be misunderstood. I want you to know I'm dead
serious toward you. This is no game with me, Josephine. When I
leave here tonight I'll be troubled with myself all the way
home."</p>

<p>"Now why, for mercy's sakes?" she demanded, really
surprised.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "As you stood there at the stove
just now I grew completely disgusted with myself. I never thought
any woman could humble me in that manner. Do you see what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, studying him with considerable
penetration. She had a great deal of self-control, and much
pride. She was, he thought, as strong a woman emotionally as he
had seen; but in her lips, in her voice tones, in the slanted
glances she sometimes gave him there was the hint of powerful
convictions and will. He had the feeling that she could, if
necessary, draw a revolver and shoot a man down and not go to
pieces afterwards; it was that thing he chiefly discovered as he
analyzed her, that courage and simplicity of action which was
near to being primitive. The truth was, he knew less of her from
observation than he knew of most women; her character had a way
of eluding his inspection.</p>

<p>"Why should we be too involved in all this, Edward?" He made a
little bow to her and said "Good night," and turned to the door.
As he opened it he swung back, and said with a complete
confidence: "You must know me for what I am. I mean to have you.
I mean to make you want me."</p>

<p>
TROOPER LOVELACE ate his supper in a hurry, a fact
noticed and commented on by Bierss. "What's the matter with your
appetite, Lovelace?"</p>

<p>The young lad flushed under the attention of the roundabout
troopers and got up from the table. "Nothing," he said. "Nothing
at all."</p>

<p>"Love's bad for the appetite," said Bierss. But he went easy
on Lovelace. Crude and obscene as his comment could be, he
forbore using it now. All he added was, "You got Purple to beat,
Lovelace. He's stickin' close to Suds Row."</p>

<p>"Who said anything about Suds Row?" retorted Lovelace and left
the mess hall. He was relieved to get away from the crowd, for he
lived in deadly fear that one of the troopers might say something
concerning Mary which would compel him to fight. It wasn't the
fighting which troubled him so much; it was her name being
mentioned at all in the barrack. He wrapped his heavy coat around
him and passed into the frigid night; and eagerness to see her
again caused him to buck his way rapidly through the snow.</p>

<p>When he came before Mulrane's house he stopped, the shyness in
him making it difficult for him to knock on the door and face the
family. He stepped away and moved on toward the bluff, but he
hadn't gone far when he saw a pair coming up the street, and
heard Mary's voice carry forward in the brittle-cold air. The
other figure was tall against her, whereby he knew it was
Purple.</p>

<p>He went dead cold and his stomach turned over. He hated Purple
violently, and he was shocked at Mary; but most of all he felt
the humiliation of standing here as they came forward and saw
him. They moved on until he saw Purple's grinning face&mdash;and
heard Purple speak to him like a grown man making talk to a
little boy: "You're out late, son."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Lovelace, and felt self-disdain for so
feeble an answer. Mary's face was round and troubled in the
darkness. Her voice was softly hurried.</p>

<p>"Frank," she said, "we're going in the house now. Come
on."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I was just walking by," and cut around them
and went on. He heard Purple say something, and laugh; and the
sound of it burned like an iron through him. He stopped at the
edge of the bluff and swung around. They were before her house
and a little later he heard Purple's boots go gritting through
the snow. The house door opened, and closed. She had gone inside.
Lovelace moved up the street, thinking of a dozen sharp and
challenging things he might have said to Purple, in answer to the
man's arrogant manner. He thought of them now; but now they were
too late. He passed the Mulrane house with his head down, and
heard Mary speak to him.</p>

<p>"Frank," she said, "wait a minute."</p>

<p>She had opened and closed the door, but she hadn't gone in.
She stood in the shadows, waiting for him, and as he came up she
lifted her head and smiled for him. "Come in now, Frank."</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"You're angry."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I didn't mean to butt in."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were coming," she said. "How was I to
know?" Then she grew a little irritated. "Am I supposed to just
sit around and wait for you and turn everybody away?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not at all."</p>

<p>"Well, then," she said, "don't be foolish."</p>

<p>"A little cold for taking a walk, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>She tossed her head at him. "I've walked in colder weather,
with you."</p>

<p>"And kissed him, too, I suppose."</p>

<p>She delayed her answer, watching him, troubled and uncertain
with this scene. "I let him kiss me," she admitted slowly.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, stricken dull, "good night."</p>

<p>"Wait. A girl has to know things, doesn't she? She has to know
whether she thinks more of one man than another. A girl isn't a
bolt of cloth to be wrapped up and set on the shelf by the first
man that comes along. She's got to know who's right. A man looks
around to find the right one, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Lovelace, "maybe he's the right one, and maybe
I'm not. When I kiss a girl I'm not fooling around."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't say that to me, Frank. I'll do what I please
until I make up my mind."</p>

<p>He descended lower and lower into a sweltering gloom. He sank
like a rock through layers of disillusion and renouncement and
broken dreams. He said, "All right, Mary," and moved up the
street with personal tragedy weighting his shoulders down.</p>

<p>Her voice came after him: "Aren't you going to invite me to
your troop ball?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Good-by, Mary."</p>

<p>He moved through the guard gate and tramped along the row of
barracks; he went all the distance to the north guard gate and
turned back to company quarters. He stretched out on his bunk,
face up; he was wholly crushed and there was no hope in him. He
thought of deserting and going to Mexico. Then he said to
himself: "No, I'll stay here until summer campaign. She'll
see."</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; MEMORY OF A
WOMAN</h2>

<p class="first">SHAFTER reached Fort Lincoln thirteen days after
his departure from it and dropped off his mail and despatches. He
had brought back from Fargo a barrel of apples, something rarely
had on the frontier. Half of the barrel he left in the barrack
room; the other half he divided into three sacks, taking one to
Mrs. Moylan and one to Lieutenant Smith's wife. Both ladies were
genuinely appreciative. Mrs. Smith looked at them and took up one
and laid it against her cheek. "When I was a child in New York,
Sergeant, I used to do this to take the winter chill out of them.
We had a big root cellar with bins on each side for apples and
potatoes. Sometimes the snow got so deep between the house and
the root cellar that we tunneled a passageway between." She
looked beyond the sergeant, the vision of it very clear to her,
drawing her back to her younger years. "Apples and nuts and
home-cured raisins at night around the big fireplace. There were eight
of us&mdash;eight children, and now they're scattered all over
the earth." She gave him a bright short smile. "Your present took
me back, Sergeant. Thank you."</p>

<p>He carried the mail on through for Fort Rice that same
afternoon and returned to Lincoln next noon. This was Saturday,
and the men of the troop had spent most of the day dressing up
the quartermaster building for their ball that night. Receiving
Moylan's permission to use the mail sleigh, Shafter presented
himself at Josephine's house promptly at seven-thirty.</p>

<p>When she came to the door, he was astonished at the rough
shock that went through him. Her presence did that to him, the
smile breaking over her lips, the touch of her hand on his arm,
the sudden view of loveliness she presented to him. He closed the
door and stood against it, watching her move away and turn and
face him. She said: "It is a little early. Take off your overcoat
for a moment."</p>

<p>He was a tall sharp shape inside the coat's length and
heaviness. It fitted snug against shoulders and chest and added
to his height. He stood wholly attentive as he watched her, a
black-haired man with long and broad bones and a face whipped by
the wind; and the wind and darkness&mdash;and the sight of
her&mdash;sharpened his eyes. She noticed it and made a slight
turn and a slight gesture with her arms and stood before him for
his inspection, the smile steady. "Will I do for your ball,
Kern?"</p>

<p>He said: "I've not seen anyone like you."</p>

<p>"Come now," she said, "you've seen no woman at all for a week.
That's no comparison."</p>

<p>"I can go farther back than that," he said, soberly
deliberate.</p>

<p>She tipped her head, immensely curious as to his past, caring
about it with a genuine emotion. Her smile changed and grew
smaller. "How far back must you go to find a woman you'd want to
stand beside me?"</p>

<p>"Once," he said, "a long time ago, there was one."</p>

<p>"She meant a great deal?" asked Josephine, very softly.</p>

<p>He nodded. "At the time it was one of those affairs which
seemed&mdash;" and a self-amused and slightly harder tone came
into his voice&mdash;"eternal. The kind you make everlasting vows
on. When the earth is wonderful and everything is fair to behold
and you could fight all the dragons on earth."</p>

<p>She had ceased to smile; the glow left her face and she stood
still, listening. "Where is she now?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere, alive."</p>

<p>"Alive in you. I hear her walking around your heart."</p>

<p>"All you hear is echoes."</p>

<p>"How long since you've seen her?"</p>

<p>"Eight years."</p>

<p>"Echoes don't last that long. Only hope does."</p>

<p>"Or disillusion. I have no desire to hope."</p>

<p>She turned slowly away, moving toward the corner table in the
room. She put her hands lightly on a book, and moved the book,
and spoke over her shoulder. "It must have been an intense affair
to leave so lasting an impression."</p>

<p>"A man and woman in love," he said, "is scarcely a mild thing,
is it?"</p>

<p>"That depends on the woman and on the man."</p>

<p>"I'm speaking for myself."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have a great deal of depth. I have only recently
discovered that in you."</p>

<p>"A man learns to cover himself and protect himself from
further commitments which will break him apart. He goes sour and
skeptical."</p>

<p>"You're not."</p>

<p>"You've not heard me express it."</p>

<p>She turned about. "Kern, I don't think I like to be the
instrument which brings back those memories to you."</p>

<p>Humor moved into his eyes. He had an edge to his spirits, and
appreciation of her was a clear print on his face. He had changed
a great deal in the short time he had been in the army, she
thought; he was a more aggressive man, a simpler and less
involved man enjoying the physical sensations, the hearty
pleasures, the old, sentimental loyalties. Still, she remembered
his one grim remark concerning disillusion, and was troubled by
it, though she failed to understand why she should let it disturb
her. For a moment the fine, glowing feeling of his presence had
left her; suddenly she shrugged her shoulders and smiled
again.</p>

<p>"What a strange way to start an evening. Time to go, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>He moved over the room to lift her coat from a chair. He held
it for her and was for the moment close to her, so that when she
turned to him and looked up she saw the image of her face in his
eyes. His lids crept together as he watched her, as her presence
hit him again with its sound jolt. She saw what was happening to
him but she stood still, her lips slightly apart. She thought:
"This is foolish," and felt the heavy undertow of feeling sweep
against her, unsettle her resolution, and turn her reckless. She
made one sharp move to break that moment, and wheeled away. He
stood still and presently she swung back, her face almost severe
in its darkness, but her eyes glowing against him. For a moment
they watched each other, completely still; and then she lifted
her chin, breaking the turbulence of feeling between them, and
took his arm.</p>

<p>"Time to go," she repeated.</p>

<p>He brought her back at one in the morning and escorted her to
the door. He lifted his hat and he said: "Thank you. Now you've
tried the high and the low. Good night."</p>

<p>She said: "Come in for coffee."</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>She had a way of lifting her head in a sudden motion when she
was angry and when she was determined. She said: "Tie the mules
and put the blankets over them. Then come in. Sergeant."</p>

<p>When he had taken care of the mules he came into the house and
found Russell standing sleepily by the stove. Russell said: "My
girl is staying out late. Three last week and one o'clock
tonight."</p>

<p>"My record is better than the lieutenant's by two hours," said
Shafter.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Russell and left the room. Josephine had
dropped her coat on a chair and for a moment had watched
Shafter's face; now she went into the kitchen. Shafter stood with
his back to the stove, hearing her move about the other room. He
got a cigar from his pocket and lighted it and he drew in the
heavy smoke and relished it, at the same time thinking of the
waltz tune swinging them around and around the hall. It was
Sergeant Hines who had privately said to him, during a break in
the dancing: "You're flyin' high, Shafter. She was at officers'
ball last week with Garnett."</p>

<p>He listened to her footfalls and admitted that she drew his
attention, and he recalled that he had thought of her during the
thirteen days between Fargo and Bismarck. He pulled the cigar
from his mouth and stood with his face tipped toward the floor,
gravely aware of what was happening to him and stubbornly
convinced that he had to prevent it from happening.</p>

<p>She came from the kitchen with coffee for both of them and a
little tray with bread and honey and cheese. She put these things
on a table and motioned to him. He brought up a chair and sat
down opposite her. She sat back with her coffee, her eyes
scanning him over the rim of the cup, quite thoughtful. "Who told
you about my going with Garnett?"</p>

<p>"One of the boys."</p>

<p>"I should have told you two weeks ago that I planned to go
with him."</p>

<p>"If I'd known it I wouldn't have taken you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"A woman can't play both sides of the line. I'm on one side of
it and Garnett's on the other. You're an officer's woman. In
going with me you have shut yourself out of being invited to the
officers' side again."</p>

<p>"Isn't that my affair more than yours?"</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>She sipped at her coffee, never for a moment taking her eyes
from him. He was seemingly at ease, but she knew he was violently
angry and she hated to have him that way.</p>

<p>"It really isn't that," she told him. "It's Garnett, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Let's forget it."</p>

<p>"Nothing would please me better," she coolly answered. "But
you have no intention of forgetting it. So it had better be
talked out before it gets worse."</p>

<p>He used his calm, stubborn voice on her. "How would it
help?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "That's what I'm trying to discover.
You were embarrassed by him in this house once. Is that the cause
of your disliking him so greatly?"</p>

<p>"Josephine," he said, "I hope you had a pleasant evening," and
rose. He smiled at her, but he had drawn away from her. She sat
still, watching him pull into his coat, and she wanted to ask him
if common jealousy lay at the roots of his change toward her but
she could not bring herself to the direct question.</p>

<p>"It started out very well, Kern," she told him, "and ended
badly. But I really forced myself on you, so I shall not
complain." Abruptly she began to feel a slow outrage at the whole
situation. "I have liked most of the changes I have seen in you.
I do not like this one at all."</p>

<p>It broke through the reserve behind which he seemed to want to
take shelter. "It is Garnett," he admitted.</p>

<p>"But it goes a long way back. There's no use adding to
that."</p>

<p>"If it is so far in the past, why bring it forward to
influence your judgment of me? I have nothing to do with your
past, or your quarrels."</p>

<p>"That's right," he said, very dry. "You're also trying to tell
me I have no business in making an issue of your going with
Garnett."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I was trying to tell you that."</p>

<p>"You're right. And that leaves the matter pretty straight. As
I said before, you're an officer's woman and I have no business
here at all." He took up his dress hat and bowed slightly at her
and turned to the door.</p>

<p>"Is that your way of saying good-by, Kern?"</p>

<p>He swung. She had shaken him out of his hardness and she had
made him sad. She saw the sadness lie darkly around his eyes and
his mouth. He nodded. "I don't believe in tangling up somebody's
life&mdash;and I've spent a good many years trying to untangle my
own."</p>

<p>She rose and spoke in an almost antagonistic tone. "Where is
the tangling? Aren't you taking in too much territory to make
anything out of a dinner, a few visits and a dance?"</p>

<p>"You misjudge yourself, Josephine," he said.</p>

<p>She had not convinced him, she had not changed him, and she
was not holding him. Knowing it she hit him with deliberate
unfairness. "Did you run from Garnett once before&mdash;as you're
doing now?"</p>

<p>He let an enormous sigh out of his chest as he came back to
her. She hated what she had done and she was ashamed of herself
and stood still when he looked down with his gray, dismal
expression. "You don't know me very well," he said and took her
arms and pulled her forward. "It would have been better if you'd
left me alone." He dropped his head and kissed her, holding her
so strongly with his hands that she felt pain in her ribs. Then
he stepped back. "That was foolish," he said.</p>

<p>"Was it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You knew it was coming," he said, thoughtfully watching
her.</p>

<p>"I usually know when a man wants to kiss me."</p>

<p>"That's not hard to read on a man. The difficult thing is to
know what he means by the kiss."</p>

<p>"Last time you kissed me it was for the purpose of offending
me and getting rid of me. What was your meaning this time?"</p>

<p>"We're fighting now," he said. "It isn't worth that."</p>

<p>"What would you fight for?"</p>

<p>"A crooked deal at cards," he said, "a spilled drink, a dirty
name&mdash;a shove in the ribs."</p>

<p>His words deliberately crowded her out, deliberately kept him
inside a man's world. She was hurt by the way he spoke, and she
thought she knew why he had spoken. "You've had one fight over a
woman and now you think there's no woman worth that trouble. You
have taken most of the nonsense out of your life, haven't you,
Kern? You are very safe with your little comforts."</p>

<p>She was greatly embittered and she wanted to punish him. Even
so she listened carefully to him when he spoke, seeking to pull
aside the screening of his words to fathom what terrible
experience had left him so dull and without faith.</p>

<p>"A woman is beauty, Josephine, and all men worship beauty.
Some men always see it from a safe distance and die happy with
their illusion. Some men come upon a woman and touch her and
possess her and never regret it. But there are men who have no
such luck. When they come upon their shrine and touch the beauty
they have worshiped from afar for so long&mdash;all that beauty
fades and dies out." He paused a moment and then added the one
and terrible comment: "It is hard for a man to come upon this
shrine and see the finger marks of other worshipers before
him."</p>

<p>"From you," she said, pitying him even as she hated him. "From
you who have rolled in the dust and been beaten down in barroom
brawls."</p>

<p>"Different," he said with his gray smile remaining. "A man's
sins are honest. He wants his beauty to be the same way." He
looked at her with the smile disappearing. "How did I come to
speak of all this?"</p>

<p>"I drew you out. I don't like you, Kern."</p>

<p>"The first honest thing said tonight." Then he shook his head.
"No, the kiss was also honest. But it is better to end a thing
properly than to nourish miserable illusions."</p>

<p>She said: "You will never cease to nourish your
illusions."</p>

<p>"Then," he said, "I'm a fool."</p>

<p>She threw his words back to him. "Yes, you're a fool. But for
the opposite reason. For thinking you can live without illusions.
You'll never have anything else half as real. Good night."</p>

<p>She listened to him cross the porch and drop into the snow.
Later she heard him run the sleigh and team around the house,
heading away for the post. He was still before her in the room,
his shape, his height, his face with its swings of feeling. Until
this night he had guarded himself well, and then had let the
screen slip aside to expose the wreckage within&mdash;the old
love that had run through him like a fire and had burned out to
leave nothing but the charred skeleton of hope behind. "I was
right," she thought, "I should never have permitted myself to be
interested in him."</p>

<p>It surprised her that he had so profoundly shaken her, had
aroused a momentary fury against him, and then a pity. He was a
man emptied out by catastrophe and now living in a state of
guarded suspense, fearing that some other catastrophe might shake
him again. He had pulled away from all the fine prodigal emotions
of living because of that. Yet she corrected herself, knowing she
had wrongly estimated him. He had too much in him deliberately to
starve out all his feelings and therefore he had retreated to the
world of men.</p>

<p>It was a tragedy and she felt it. She stood still, wondering
why it should go so hard with her, and presently she understood.
She had allowed herself to put her first hopes in him, his smile,
his strength, his imagination and tenderness&mdash;all those
things which made a man sound and good; and now stood by and
watched him throw those things contemptuously aside. It hurt her
badly.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE GODS CEASE TO
SMILE</h2>

<p class="first">SHAFTER was in Fargo on Christmas Day. He had
dinner at the railroad restaurant and moved to the saloon to play
poker until the mood went out of him and he bucked his way
through a hard-driving snowstorm to the hotel and lay long awake,
listening to the wind whining thin and sharp along the wall of
the building. Darkness pressed down upon Fargo so heavily that
the town's lights, passing through window pane and doorway, were
at once absorbed. On the blackened, weather-riddled street a
gunfight erupted and briefly lasted. Somewhere in the hotel a
music machine pricked out sentimental tunes steadily; he listened
to those little tinny melodies and was carried back and carried
down until he turned savage from the memories of his life.</p>

<p>The storm pounded the earth for three days. It screamed
through the town and drove drifts against the windward side of
buildings until men were able to walk out of second-story
windows. It snapped telegraph lines eastward and stopped trains
from St. Paul. It moved out of the northern emptiness like great
wild sea waves, higher and higher, more and more violent, until
the impact of this fury thundered against Fargo's walls and
carried away all insecure things, and shook each building on its
foundation. Fargo's citizens counted ranks and named those who
had been caught away from home and knew that death rode
abroad.</p>

<p>There was a rope stretched from the hotel to the restaurant
and from the restaurant to the saloon; along this confined
pathway the citizens blindly moved. Men who had come in from the
outskirts of town at the beginning of the blizzard dared not
attempt the half-mile journey to their homes. They slept in the
hotel, ate in the restaurant and spent the rest of their hours in
the saloon. A poker game, started on the first day, went
intermittently on to the end; and when Shafter rose from the
table on the morning of the fourth day and heard the strange,
hollow stillness abroad, he had five hundred dollars in his
pockets.</p>

<p>It was beyond New Year, however, before the mail from St. Paul
came in; and the homeward journey across the drift-drowned land
took him ten days. When he came into A Company's barracks, Hines
said: "Where were you when it started?"</p>

<p>"Fargo."</p>

<p>"The boys were bettin' even money you were caught out."</p>

<p>That night Garnett dropped into Josephine's house for dinner
and mentioned the arrival of the mail. Josephine said: "Did he
have trouble getting through?"</p>

<p>"Shafter? I don't know." He observed the girl's lightened
spirits and after the elder Russell had taken himself off to bed,
Garnett commented on it. "You have a fancy for him don't
you?"</p>

<p>"I'd worry about any man traveling in this weather," she
said.</p>

<p>It was not a direct answer, Garnett realized, and he pushed
his point. "That wasn't what I asked."</p>

<p>"Yes," she told him, "I like the sergeant."</p>

<p>He smiled his best smile. "I envy any living thing which has
part of your heart or your interest."</p>

<p>"Edward, did you know him before he came here?"</p>

<p>He had been smiling at her, and he still smiled; but she
noticed him change within, grow reticent, grow cautious. He
struggled with his answer, not wishing to answer her, but she
kept the pressure of her glance on him, making him say with great
reluctance: "Yes, I knew him."</p>

<p>"Were you once friends?"</p>

<p>He said, "Good friends, once."</p>

<p>"Why did you quarrel?"</p>

<p>"Do you have to know that, Josephine?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm too curious," she said, and turned away from
him to the far corner of the room. She sat down and picked up her
knitting, at once absorbed in it. She changed the conversation by
saying: "This is your first winter out here, isn't it? You must
watch the weather from now until April. It can be very
treacherous."</p>

<p>"I've heard that," he said. But he was troubled at the way the
scene had gone, and dissatisfied at the showing he made with her,
A woman's mind was a fertile thing. She would perhaps ask him no
more about his past, but she would invent one answer after
another to fill in the unsolved story&mdash;and by this process
he might be injured in her eyes. He sat in the chair with a posed
ease, the warmth of the room making his ivory cheeks ruddy; his
hair tumbled forward on his head and gave him a negligent
handsomeness. He tapped the chair with the index finger of his
right hand&mdash;a broad, long hand with a heavy diamond ring
showing out its glitter; he dropped into a somber study.</p>

<p>She looked up and saw him thus off guard and tried to fathom
the realness of the man. There were times when he deliberately
put himself on his best behavior toward her; she always knew
these times and always discounted them. There were other moments
when she felt he wanted her to see him for whatever he was, when
he tried to be only human and natural, as though he had
discovered in her a realism which cut through any pose he might
adopt. He knew his own striking appearance and he took pains to
be seen at his best, and yet, in his own way, he had much of the
rough masculinity she had observed in Shafter. Always, in
studying Garnett, she had Shafter in her mind; he was a constant
reminder in her head so that now he was somewhere in the room,
looking at her with his gray eyes and with his smile which
covered his real feelings.</p>

<p>"Edward," she murmured, "don't chase your thoughts
around."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I've never been noted for heavy thinking.
I'm surprised at myself. The things I keep going back to the
things I keep stumbling over. Regrets&mdash;and all that."</p>

<p>"What regrets?"</p>

<p>"Things that would have been better undone."</p>

<p>"Women, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Looking at you, they're just shadows."</p>

<p>"That's a strange thing to say."</p>

<p>"It is strange for me to be here wishing I could say what I
want to say."</p>

<p>"I never knew you to lack self-expression."</p>

<p>"I never have," he admitted. "That's it. I have told other
women how beautiful I thought they were. I have even told a woman
I was in love with her. I have said those things, not entirely
meaning them. Now I want to say them because I mean them. I wish
I had never used those words before."</p>

<p>"You're frank at least."</p>

<p>"It is my only chance, with you." He got up, walking toward
her. He looked down. "Do you expect him tonight? He came back
today. I suppose he'll come to see you."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," she said.</p>

<p>"You've been kind to me lately. Do you have any particular
feeling toward him, Josephine?"</p>

<p>She answered him with an almost irritable impatience.
"No."</p>

<p>"Do you trust me?"</p>

<p>She ceased her knitting and looked up, carefully choosing her
answer. "Yes," she said, "I trust you."</p>

<p>It made a tremendous impression on him. He grew buoyant, he
made a swift motion with his arms. "I'd like to wrap you in fur
and drive you down the Avenue in the most elegant cab in New
York, I'd like to dine you at Terry's and take you to the
theater. I'd like to sit by and watch your lips grow red when you
smile. You are the most beautiful woman in the world in evening
clothes. There is body and strength to you. There's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Edward," she said, "don't."</p>

<p>His intemperate feelings controlled him. "You see," he
murmured, "that's how I feel. If you trust me, believe me also."
He swung around and got his coat and shrugged himself into it.
She laid aside her knitting to watch him and noticed how,
unconsciously, he straightened himself before her to show himself
to best advantage; it was a thing he couldn't help. "There's a
place in New Orleans, in the Quarter. When I think of it I think
of you. A restaurant down an alley, with a back courtyard and an
old man who plays the violin while you eat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you take a woman last time you were there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Shame on you for wishing to take me there then."</p>

<p>"I know," he said. "I know. You see how it is? Well, let's go
for a sleigh ride out to the Benson farm tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever have duty at the post?"</p>

<p>"Winter's a dreary time for soldiering. Nothing to do. Old
stories, old faces. We all get sick of one another, and therefore
try to keep away from each other. Two o'clock?"</p>

<p>She murmured: "We had a drive two days ago. Let's wait another
week, Edward."</p>

<p>"Then invite me to supper."</p>

<p>"I shall," she said. "But not this week."</p>

<p>He said quietly, "I understand."</p>

<p>She found herself irritated. "What do you understand,
Edward?"</p>

<p>"You do expect Shafter. Good night, Josephine."</p>

<p>He was not a humble man and therefore it was remarkable to her
that he left with so much quietness. She took up her knitting but
held it still; she listened to the wall clock strike nine and
restlessness destroyed her sense of comfort. She put the knitting
aside and got her coat and hat and an old wool muffler and
stepped into the night. Coldness held both wind and blackness in
its frozen grip and the sliding of her feet on the snow brought
up crackling echoes which went abnormally large before her. She
turned into Bismarck's street and strolled along it, almost
alone. The night marshal passed her and stopped to leave his
warning. "Twenty-seven below, Josephine. Don't stay out in this
too long." She went on until she reached the post office. It was
closed, as she knew it would be, but she looked both ways on the
street with hope in her heart, and then turned into her father's
store.</p>

<p>The night clerk was serving a last customer before closing
time. She moved idly around the counter and got herself a cracker
and cut a piece of cheese and dipped a pickle from the big
barrel; she sat on the counter's edge and swung one leg while she
ate. Two squaws came in and made signs for tobacco. She made the
transaction, speaking a few Sioux words to them, and watched them
leave.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go home, Jo?" asked the clerk. "That pickle
will spoil your sleep."</p>

<p>She wrapped the muffler around her neck and stepped back into
the night's iron-hard cold and saw Shafter standing at the edge
of the walk, facing her. He had come along in the sleigh and had
gotten out of it.</p>

<p>She realized then that this was the hope that had brought her
here; but now she was uncertain, and uncertainty made her turn
half away, and stop and turn back. His glance had followed her
and was intently on her. He lifted his hat.</p>

<p>"You're going home alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>He made a motion toward the sleigh. He came forward and took
her arm and gave her a hand into it. "Better wrap that muffler
tighter. Part of your ear is exposed."</p>

<p>She said: "Did the storm catch you?"</p>

<p>"I was in Fargo," he said and sent the mules walking down the
street. "Didn't get away until after New Year."</p>

<p>"I wondered if you were safe," she said.</p>

<p>"Two weeks in Fargo," he said, "is a dull experience."</p>

<p>"There must have been a poker game."</p>

<p>"That runs out, too."</p>

<p>They turned the corner and moved over the gap toward her
house. He brought the sleigh before the door and held the mules
in check. "Nice Christmas?"</p>

<p>"The Calhouns had a party at the fort. Somebody had sent in a
plum pudding; and we had Tom-and-Jerries without the eggs. There
were three eggs, but they all turned out bad. The band played
Christmas carols and we went around singing until Major Reno
ordered us back to shelter before we froze. Yes, it was a
pleasant Christmas. Only one shooting in Bismarck."</p>

<p>"Christmas..." he started to say, and shook his head and let
it go like that. He looked at her in the way she best knew him,
smiling and easy&mdash;all this covering up the heat in him. She
sat still a long moment, gripping her hands together beneath the
robe. She thought: "I should ask him inside. I should break this
wall between us." But her pride was harder than her wishes and
presently she slipped from the sleigh. "Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night," he said and lifted the reins. He was ten feet on
when she called to him. She said, "Happy New Year, Kern."</p>

<p>He swung in the seat, the glow from the snowbound earth
shining faintly on him. "And many of them," he said and
disappeared.</p>

<p>She waited until she no longer saw the outline of the sleigh
and no longer heard the sibilant slicing of team and runners on
the snow; then she turned inside, profoundly sad.</p>

<p><br>
HE was in Fargo in February when news came over the
wire that the Indian Commissioner had surrendered control of all
Sioux not on their reservations to the War Department. He was at
Fort Lincoln a week later when Terry's order to be ready for a
winter campaign came to the Seventh. Making his back-and-fourth
circuit during the following weeks, Shafter watched the story
unfold. The Sioux and Cheyenne, frightened by the intentions of
the War Department, fled from their reservations, going back
through bitterest weather to their old grounds on the Powder, on
the Rosebud, on the Tongue. The General of the Army, Sherman, had
given Terry full freedom of action. Meanwhile Sherman had
despatched a column under Crook north from Fetterman, the intent
being that Crook and Terry, coming from different directions,
should catch the Sioux in a nut cracker. Crook's column beat its
way through terrible weather, launched a surprise attack on the
village of Crazy Horse, on the upper sources of the Powder, and
for a moment had victory within its grasp. But Crazy Horse,
fighting in desperate recklessness, gathered his warriors and
threw Crook's column into disorder and drove it back to
Fetterman. Terry, meanwhile, found his plans wrecked by the
steady succession of blizzards blowing over the land and delayed
his campaign.</p>

<p>Early in March, the long simmering scandal which had sent its
forewarning taint out of Washington for a year or more boiled
over. A broker in New York came forward with evidence that
Belknap, or Belknap's wife, had taken money as reward for aiding
certain men to secure profitable post-traderships. Belknap
resigned as Secretary of War on the eve of a Congressional
investigation. At the same time Custer, whose leave had expired,
took the train west to St. Paul with his wife and there reported
to General Terry.</p>

<p>Terry gave him his orders. Custer was to go on to Lincoln at
once, to put his regiment in readiness and to march at the first
break of weather, to meet the Sioux and to gather them in or to
crush them. "I had hoped to be started long before this," said
Terry, "in order to work in conjunction with Crook. As soon as
practicable, Sherman will get Crook in motion again, headed
north."</p>

<p>Custer took a special train from St. Paul. Halfway between
Fargo and Lincoln the blizzard snowed him in and he cooled his
impatient heels in a frigid coach until a detachment from Lincoln
came out to his rescue. Once at the fort, his nervous, driving,
impetuous will galvanized the seven troops of the regiment into
feverish action; and at the same time, departmental orders went
out from Washington, sending the three companies in Louisiana and
the two at Fort Totten back to Lincoln. For the first time in
many years the regiment was again to be whole. Custer flung
himself into his job with all the terrific energy of a man who
could not bear quietness. He had scarcely returned to duty,
however, when a telegram arrived from the Congressional
investigating committee ordering his return to Washington in
order to testify against Belknap. On the eve of a campaign, with
all the glory that might accrue to the regiment and to him, his
own indiscreet offer to Clymer had at last caught up with him. In
this dilemma he wired his appeal to the committee:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">I AM ENGAGED UPON AN IMPORTANT EXPEDITION...I
EXPECT TO TAKE THE FIELD EARLY IN APRIL...MY PRESENCE HERE IS
DEEMED VERY NECESSARY...WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW ME TO
RETURN MY REPLIES BY MAIL?</p>

<p><br>
The committee thought not, and so near the end of March Custer
returned to Washington. Sergeant Hines spoke his mind
confidentially to Shafter about this.</p>

<p>"If the general would keep his mouth shut maybe he wouldn't
get in so much trouble."</p>

<p>Terry had based his plans on Custer since the latter was to
his mind the best Indian campaigner under his command. Therefore
the campaign lagged, waiting Custer's return from Washington. The
days and the weeks dragged on while the committee slowly worked
its way through the mass of testimony, prejudice, politics and
recrimination. One by one the lost companies of the Seventh
returned from their out-of-way assignments and the quarters at
Lincoln, never meant for a full regiment, spilled over. The ice
in the river went out one day with a grinding and a crashing like
unto the cannonade of an artillery battle but the weather still
was dangerous, now clear, now swinging down with its northern
fury. Day after day the regiment drilled and made its
preparations, and by means of the newspapers followed the
testimony of their commander in Washington who, prodded by
question upon question, at last produced this one startling
thing:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">"Fraud among the sutlers could not have been
carried on without the connivance of the Secretary of War...You
ask me of the morale and character of the army. The service has
not been demoralized even though the head of it, the Secretary of
War, has shown himself to be so unworthy."</p>

<p><br>
Captain Benteen, consistent in his hatred of Custer, smiled a
wintry smile when he read that. "The Goddamned fool," he said to
his lieutenant, Francis Gibson. "Belknap was President Grant's
friend. In saying Belknap was a scoundrel, Custer is telling the
people publicly that he thinks the President is a scoundrel. Do
you think Grant will stand that in silence? It is a matter of
discipline. No little jackass lieutenant colonel in the United
States Army can speak of the commander-in-chief that way. Right
or wrong, an officer keeps his mouth shut. But Custer never had
sense enough to know that. He has courtmartialed many a man
within his regiment for insubordination, and now exhibits the
worst insubordination possible. Wait and see what Grant does to
him."</p>

<p>Out in St. Paul, General Terry waited for Custer's release
from Washington. All arrangements had been made, now that spring
was close by. Crook was to start up from Fetterman again. General
Gibbon, with all the troops he could scrape together from the
isolated and remote posts of Montana Territory, was to march
east, reach the Yellowstone, and follow it until he joined with
the Seventh Cavalry which meanwhile would be marching west. Thus
the three columns, flushing Sioux before them, would drive the
red men into a pocket, there to trap them and induce them to
return to the reservation, or to subdue them by pitched battle.
The plan was made and Terry waited for the commander of the Fort
Lincoln column to return from Washington.</p>

<p>The Congressional committee finished its initial hearings but
held Custer in the capital for future use. Now, with the campaign
hourly growing nearer, Custer saw himself in danger of being left
behind&mdash;his regiment marching without him. He appealed to
Sherman, who was the General of the Army. Sherman said: "You had
better see the President. It is in his hands entirely."</p>

<p>"I have been there twice. He refuses to see me," said
Custer.</p>

<p>"Better try again," said Sherman.</p>

<p>Custer went wearily back to the White House and handed in his
card. He sat in the anteroom, a lank, flamboyant man slowly being
humbled and made conscious of his own helplessness as the hours
passed. Men went by him, in and out of the President's office.
Old officer friends from the Civil War paused to say hello, but
he thought there was constraint in their manner. The sun had
ceased to shine upon him. At five o'clock in the evening, as gray
day came to its end, the President's secretary came out with his
message.</p>

<p>"The President." said the secretary, "will not see you."</p>

<p>Custer stood up, paling a little. He remained still, the dash
and the rankling vigor for the moment crushed from him. Then he
murmured, "Very well, sir," and left the room. That night, with
his wife, he caught the train west. As he stepped from the train
at Chicago to transfer for St. Paul an aide of General Sheridan's
came to him, offered a polite salute and handed to him a copy of
a telegram despatched from Sherman to Terry:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">GENERAL: I AM AT THIS MOMENT ADVISED THAT
GENERAL CUSTER STARTED LAST NIGHT FOR ST. PAUL AND FORT ABRAHAM
LINCOLN. HE WAS NOT JUSTIFIED IN LEAVING WITHOUT SEEING THE
PRESIDENT OR MYSELF. PLEASE INTERCEPT HIM AT CHICAGO OR ST, PAUL
AND ORDER HIM TO HALT AND WAIT FOR FURTHER ORDERS. MEANWHILE,
LET THE EXPEDITION FROM FORT LINCOLN PROCEED WITHOUT HIM.</p>

<p><br>
Custer gave his wife an odd, desperate glance&mdash;the
wildness of feeling rushing to his bony face, into his piercing
eyes. "Libby," he said, "they have stripped me of my
command."</p>

<p>Discipline had reached out and struck him with its brutal
hand; and the hand was Grant's, whose reputation Custer had so
rashly impugned before the Congressional committee. Custer at
once boarded the train for St. Paul with Libby. He was
afraid&mdash;he who never had known fear before. He was
humiliated and humbled and felt the sting of it so keenly that
all the appreciation of life went from him. His vaulting
amibition to challenge the President, with the public as an
audience to the combat, fell completely out of him; his audacity
wavered and his intense physical energy, with its accompanying
self-assurance, faltered. He who had been the darling of America
stood bereft of his power, brought short up, stripped and held
still by the brooding presence in the White House. His entire
career lay in the hollow of Grant's stubby palm.</p>

<p>Reason and persuasion were methods for which Custer held a
secret contempt, because of his impetuous nature; but force was a
thing he understood, and this blunt blow reduced him to the
stature of a man begging for his life. As soon as he reached St.
Paul he went directly to his immediate superior, Terry. Terry, he
knew, had always liked him, and had faith in him as a fighter.
Terry was now his last resort.</p>

<p>"I am entirely in your hands, General," said Custer. "Neither
Sherman nor Sheridan will intercede for me. The President would
not see me, although I repeatedly attempted to see him. When I
found it was useless, I took the train west. Now I am condemned
for not having visited the President before I left. What was I to
do? They have me trapped in a cage and it pleases them to poke
sticks at me. If it is the President's wish to humiliate me
before the country, he is succeeding. I do not believe I deserve
it."</p>

<p>Terry was a mild man, a man deeply humane, tolerant and
sympathetic. There was a Christian mellowness in him, and a great
capacity of forbearance. Even so, he delivered a gentle
reprimand.</p>

<p>"You should have known better. You've been in the service long
enough to know the impropriety of making public comment on your
superiors."</p>

<p>At any other time Custer would have reiterated his fiery
impatience with hypocrisy. Now he played a meek hand. "I have
never been anything but a soldier. General. I do not understand
politicians. They have used me."</p>

<p>"No man can be used unless he permits himself to be used. Or
unless he is very stupid, Certainly you're not stupid."</p>

<p>Custer flushed, but held his peace. Terry thoughtfully
considered the problem and was at loss for an answer. He had
counted on Custer for the campaign. "I have definite instructions
not to take you. Even if it were possible to take you, I now
propose to go as commander of the eastern column."</p>

<p>"Put yourself in my place," said Custer. "If my regiment
marches without me I shall be intolerably disgraced."</p>

<p>Terry thought about that, slowly and with great doubt. "I have
learned not to question the orders of my superiors. That is a
lesson I doubt if you've learned. But you must learn it.
Impetuousness has been your lifelong creed. It is an admirable
thing until it runs into something else, which is
insubordination. An officer of your rank, commanding the lives of
eight hundred men, must have respect for order and for caution.
The lives of all these men are entirely at your disposition. I
have complete faith in you as a fighter and I should feel much
better with you in personal command of the Seventh, but I cannot
deny that the President has cause enough to suspend you from
duty."</p>

<p>"Is there no way you can put in a word for me?" said
Custer.</p>

<p>Terry turned to his desk and took up his pen, very carefully
composing a message; upon finishing, he passed it to Custer. It
read:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">I have no desire to question the orders of the
President. Whether Lieutenant Colonel Custer shall be permitted
to accompany the column or not, I shall go in command of it. I do
not know the reasons upon which the orders given rest; but if
these reasons do not forbid it, Lieutenant Colonel Custer's
services would be very valuable with his regiment.</p>

<p><br>
Custer's relief came up strong and ruddy to his face; his
spirits rushed from extreme depth to extreme height. He said: "I
am forever under debt to you, General," and left the room.</p>

<p>There was now nothing to do but wait while the slow wheels
ground; and days passed, intolerably long to Custer, and to his
wife who had to bear his moods which were penitent and hopeful
and downcast and bitter by turn. The message went to the division
commander at St. Louis, General Sheridan, who added his
endorsement.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">On a previous occasion, in 1868, I asked
executive clemency for Colonel Custer to enable him to accompany
his regiment against the Indians and I sincerely hope that if
granted this time it may have sufficient effect to prevent him
from again attempting to throw discredit upon his profession and
his brother officers.</p>

<p><br>
It was then forwarded to General Sherman who despatched it to
the White House, and there it rested in the hands of
Grant&mdash;a man whose convictions were as immovable as polar
ice, whose enemies were seldom forgiven, whose injuries were
always remembered. Yet the President was a military man and the
western campaign waited, and Terry had expressed an inclination
for Custer's services. Somewhere during the same day upon which
he received Terry's application, he weighed his personal feelings
in relation to the wishes of Terry, an old soldier whose
faithfulness was unquestioned; and so he despatched his answer to
Sherman, who wired it to Terry:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">THE PRESIDENT SENDS ME WORD THAT IF YOU WANT
GENERAL CUSTER ALONG, HE WITHDRAWS HIS OBJECTIONS. ADVISE CUSTER
TO BE PRUDENT, NOT TO TAKE ANY NEWSPAPERMEN, WHO ALWAYS MAKE
MISCHIEF, AND TO ABSTAIN FROM PERSONALITIES IN THE FUTURE.</p>

<p><br>
Nothing but a sense of propriety restrained a wild whoop of
triumph from Custer when Terry gave him the news. All his
restlessness and vitality and abundant confidence came back at a
single bound. He stood by to hear Terry's final instructions:
"Return to Lincoln by the first train and pull your regiment
together. I shall join you at the first opportunity. I wish to
march as soon as I arrive."</p>

<p>Custer left Terry's office and repaired immediately to his
hotel. In the lobby he met Captain Ludlow, who once had
campaigned with him and now was passing through the city. His
troubles were common knowledge among the army, and Ludlow
expressed a friendly sorrow. "But," he said, "you look uncommonly
cheerful for a disgraced man."</p>

<p>"I've been restored to duty," said Custer. "I am taking the
next train west.</p>

<p>"Capital," said Ludlow. "When will Terry join you?"</p>

<p>"Directly."</p>

<p>"You'll be under an excellent officer. A little on the
cautious side for a man of your temper, but an able one. I hope
it won't cramp your freedom of action too much."</p>

<p>Custer gave him a smile and a rash, penetrating glance. "Oh,
once we're in the field, I shall pull away from Terry."</p>

<p>Ludlow lifted his eyebrows and stifled a comment.</p>

<p>Custer gave him a hearty slap on the back, departing. When he
entrained for Lincoln, he was a man with a fixed idea. Behind him
lay intolerable injustice and deep personal humiliation; but
ahead of him lay redemption in the form of one more glorious
opportunity. The Seventh was his regiment, as all the country
knew; his name and the Seventh were inseparable. It would be the
Seventh which seized the chance and pressed it&mdash;and restored
his prestige. Who then could stand before him? In this game of
power&mdash;played before the audience of the nation&mdash;he
meant to produce a trump against Grant. He meant to seize his
chance, by whatever means it had to be obtained. He looked ahead,
and saw no great difficulty in gaining complete freedom of
movement from Terry, once he was in the field.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE PAST COMES
FORWARD</h2>

<p class="first">SPRING came slowly, fitfully to the plains; now
with the pale sun dissolving the snow, now with half-warmed rains
pelting down, now with nights of searing coldness. The Missouri
boiled yellow and heavy between its crumbling banks and rose
until it lapped at the foundation timbers of the Point. All
across the flatlands the river eddied and cut its way, and great
chunks of earth dropped into an already mud-engorged stream. The
<i>Far West</i> Captain Marsh commanding, nosed up from Yankton
and tied at the fort to take on supplies which it would carry
upstream for the troops, as far as the Powder and the Tongue, or
even beyond if Terry so ordered. In memory of past ambuscades.
Captain Marsh had the sides of the engine room double-planked and
the pilot house shielded with thin iron plates against Sioux
rifle fire.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of April, Shafter left Lincoln for what he
believed would be the last mail trip. Snow still blanketed the
ground and lay bank-full in the coulees; but here and there on
the railroad's right-of-way it had begun to shrink back,
permitting section crews to repair the unsettled grade and the
warped track. Trains would be soon in operation.</p>

<p>Four miles from Fargo, he passed the Benson farm and stopped
long enough to pick up their private mail. The earliest spring
birds were returning, sweeping in graceful clouds upon the small
knolls swept clear of snow; and high overhead at night he heard
the honking of geese&mdash;the earliest vanguard of itinerant
millions to follow. The weather was raw and windy, but in the
wind was the rank smell of winter's breakup, of rotted earth
about to come alive. By early morning he crossed swales coated
with ice; by late afternoon similar swales farther east had
turned into brimming lakes under the wan warmth of the day. Here
and there, the receding snow line disgorged its tragedies, a
buffalo fallen, a cow long dead but still intact from its
winter's refrigeration. Far away on the horizon he saw the smoke
of a work train. He arrived at Yankton to find the despatches not
yet arrived from St. Paul, and was delayed a week, waiting their
arrival. The mail, the newspapers and the telegraph wires were
teeming with news of freshened activity. Great things were
stirring, great plans were making, and hopes ran high for a
permanent settlement of the Indian problem; the campaign was
drawing near. Crook had already started north from Fetterman to
carry out his part of the plan, which was to box the Sioux on the
south, to drive them north toward the Missouri or to prevent them
from drifting away from the Missouri. Meanwhile, in Montana,
General Gibbon had formed a column from troops stationed at Forts
Shaw and Ellis and had gotten under way the middle of March,
pushing through the bitterest of winter weather in order that he
might fulfill the orders Terry had given him. Coming out of the
west. Gibbon was to push east to the Yellowstone and follow it,
scouting, making contact with the Sioux, and pressing them toward
the Dakota column which would be advancing from Lincoln.
Somewhere in the almost unknown region west of the Missouri and
south of the Yellowstone, Terry's plan called for a junction of
these three columns&mdash;his own, Crook's and Gibbons. Somewhere
in that same area the Sioux moved like shadows upon the earth,
keyed up by their great leaders and their medicine men.</p>

<p>The despatches from St. Paul arrived at last on a Saturday
train. Shafter went to the post office, got the pouches for Fort
Lincoln and Bismarck and returned to his hotel with them late in
the afternoon. Afterwards he dropped by the stable to have a look
at the mules, and went to the hotel for supper. Darkness came
down again and a rough wind whirled through the town. He sat
awhile in the saloon, half interested in a poker game, and
finally gave it up and climbed to his room.</p>

<p>A week of inaction was a hard thing. He made a slow circle
around the cold room, half of a mind to go back to the saloon;
there was this restlessness in him which had lately grown
greater, destroying his satisfaction. He thought, "Same thing as
cabin fever. It's been a hell of a long winter. A little
sunshine, a little sweat and a smell of dust will cure it." He
stopped and stood by the window, listening to the wind with an
experienced ear. It made a racket and it shook the hotel with its
force; but the venom had gone out of it. Spring was on the way.
In another sixty days the regiment would be in motion across the
plains; the thought of it cheered him enormously. "Probably this
is my last mail trip," he reflected. "Snowplows and work trains
are halfway to Bismarck now. Should be a train in there next
week."</p>

<p>Somebody knocked on his door and he said, "Come in," but for a
moment he remained at the window, interested in a little scene on
the street below. A dray, drawn by four horses, came around the
corner, the horses breast high in the snow. They stalled there
and the driver, seeing trouble ahead of him, now tried to back
out and got his two teams snarled. Presently Shafter remembered
the knock at his door and turned. A woman stood in the doorway
and made a little gesture with her hand. She tried to smile, and
failed; and suddenly she closed the door and placed her back to
it.</p>

<p>"Kern," she said. "Kern. Come to me."</p>

<p>It was like springing out of a sound sleep. The same physical
shock went through him, the same quick and heavy pounding of his
heart oppressed him. A queer thought came to him. "Why," he said,
"she's ten years older." He saw that at once. Her shape was the
same straight and lovely shape he had known so long ago; her face
was the same expressive face, the lips warm and ready, the eyes
watching him and willing to respond. She had always worn
excellent clothes, and wore them now; the jade pendants at her
ears reminded him somehow of the night he had found her with
Garnett; perhaps they were the same ones. She wore the ring he
had given her, the sight of which had a far-away effect on him,
as though he turned back the pages of a book and saw himself as a
man half familiar, half strange.</p>

<p>"Hello, Alice," he said.</p>

<p>"Come to me Kern."</p>

<p>He kept thinking that she was ten years older. There was
nothing he could see on her to prove it; but the effect of those
years was somewhere in her. They had made a change, the nature of
which he could not tell. He lowered his eyes and remembered how
many hundreds of times he had called her back to his mind and had
created the image of her. The image was clear and distinct,
engraved in his memory by the years of recollection. He lifted
his glance quickly, to match the image with her presence before
him; and there was an instant in which the image lay upon the
reality and made a small blur. The two did not perfectly blend.
Then the image died and the realness of her presence was with
him. But he remembered that one moment and he thought: "Ten years
have made a difference."</p>

<p>She had waited for him and he had not moved. She said: "I've
spent a long time looking for you, Kern. Years of looking for
you. I found you were at Lincoln. I was on my way to Lincoln.
Then I saw you tonight on the street. After all that, can't you
come the last ten feet?"</p>

<p>But she saw he had no intention of coming and, with a gesture
of her shoulders, she walked toward him, her eyes holding his
attention completely. There was a blackness and a care in her
eyes; there was a terrible concentration of feeling in them, as
though her life depended upon him. She touched him and looked up,
and then she slid her arms around him and brought her body to him
and give him a full and long kiss.</p>

<p>He made a gesture of placing his arms around her and a great
embarrassment went through him at his lack of response. She felt
it as well and presently stepped back, hopelessness and
half-terror in her eyes. She murmured: "Would it do any good to go all
the way back, Kern? To explain the kind of a girl I was, the
foolishness in me, the strange things I seemed to want and then
found out I didn't want? Would it help if I said I made a
mistake, and knew it as soon as you were gone, and have lived
ever since trying to find you and repair the mistake?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it wouldn't do any good."</p>

<p>"I can't believe the deepness of all we felt could die out
entirely. I can't believe it would die at all. It was everything
to us. How could it be nothing now?"</p>

<p>"Was it everything to you?"</p>

<p>"When it was too late, I knew it was. But you were always the
steadfast one. I never expected to come to you and find there
wasn't a trace of me left in your heart. I knew I had hurt you as
badly as if I'd shot you. That's been on my mind ten
years&mdash;to make it up. But I thought you'd remember me, and
remember the best of what we had. That maybe you would carry a
hope, as bitter as you were toward me, that someday it might be
different. That we could go back."</p>

<p>He heard, in her words, all that he himself had secretly
believed. He had nourished the wish, even as he had closed
himself up, made himself over, and sought simplicity for his
life. His disillusion, he realized, was a screen behind which he
covered his hope. Now she was here&mdash;and he could revive the
hope. Yet, with Alice MacDougall before him, he had no desire to
revive it. Something had happened to him. Maybe it was the
weariness of ten years. Maybe it was something else. He wanted to
express all this to her, and found it impossible; and only shook
his head.</p>

<p>She looked closely at him. She begged him in silence to
change, to come to her; she begged him to lie to her and say the
things, out of pity, that he didn't believe. The wish and the
appeal was on her face; the willingness to come to him on any
terms was there. He knew it and felt the shame of her position
and was embarrassed again. "No," he said, "nothing can come back,
for us."</p>

<p>She made a sharp turn from him and walked across the room to
the door. She swung back. The capacity for crying was burned out
of her, he guessed; her expression was dull and indifferent.</p>

<p>"Kern," she said, "it would help me if I knew one thing. Do
you hate me so much?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't hate you at all."</p>

<p>"Then," she said, "I know you never loved me as deeply as you
thought you did. I haven't really wrecked your life. I only
wrecked my own."</p>

<p>He wished he could answer that. He wanted to tell her how the
long years had been with him, how empty they had been, how far he
had traveled to escape the memory of her, how long he had dreamed
of her. But he saw that she was comforted by her belief that he
had failed in depth of emotion. It restored her self-respect. She
stood still, giving him a long and smileless glance; she was a
woman taking away some final memento to mark the end of a part of
her life. She murmured: "You've changed very little. You look
well." She drew a breath, she said in a low and uneven voice:
"Remember, Kern, I tried to come back." Then she opened the door
and went away.</p>

<p>He walked over and closed the door. He stood with his face to
it, trying to explain to himself why the memory of her had been
so powerful in him and now meant nothing. He was free in a way he
had not been free before; there was nothing left of her now but a
sentimental recollection. He thought: "Something's happened and I
have not been aware of it."</p>

<p><br>
HE left Fargo on a dull and lowering morning. Winter
this year had been one of the most severe on record; it released
its grip for a few hours, and renewed it again with its bleak,
slicing winds. At Hatton's Ranch he woke to a bright morning. A
bland warm wind blew from the south, and all that day the snow
beneath him turned to slush and the mules carried a thin vapor of
steam around their flanks from sudden sweating. That night, at
Bell T Ranch, old George MacGoffin warned him.</p>

<p>"Too damned sudden and too damned fair. It's like a woman
hatin' you all year and then beginnin' to smile. There's a knife
in that smile."</p>

<p>"Never had the experience of a woman throwing a knife at me,"
said Shafter.</p>

<p>"My experience has been with Injun women," said MacGoffin. "I
ain't had no chance at the other kind."</p>

<p>That morning he started with one day's run into Lincoln
remaining, and therefore was on the road earlier than usual. The
previous day's thaw had hardened by night into a tough crust
which made bad footing for the mules. At noon Shafter stopped to
boil his coffee and fry his bacon. Before resuming his journey he
buckled on to each mule a set of smaller leather snowshoes
designed to give better traction. Far ahead of him, barely
visible in the steel-colored haze, lay Romain's ranch and, beyond
that, the Benson ranch which was four miles short of
Bismarck.</p>

<p>As he rode forward the haze thinned and gave him a better view
of the horizons; at three o'clock he passed the Romain ranch and
pointed toward Benson's house. Somewhere in the course of the
next hour a feeling rolled through him and ruffled his flesh, a
queer sensation that had no apparent origin. He sat still, alert
to the feeling and now aware of a forming darkness distant in the
north. The air was wholly motionless and the sound of mules and
sleigh made more than the usual racket in an increasingly thin
air. His feet and the exposed flesh of his face registered the
increased bite of weather, by which he knew the temperature had
swung sharply down in one of the prairie's freak twists. It was
the weather change, then, that had made its reaction in him.</p>

<p>The Romain ranch was by then an hour behind him, the Benson
house two hours ahead. He thought of the possibilities of shelter
between those two points&mdash;the culverts into which a man
might dig his way and find scant comfort, and one small section
house. These were his secondary defenses against the storm now
displaying itself northward in the shape of a ragged wall of
cloud columns kicked high by wind.</p>

<p>He had played his game with these blizzards all during the
winter; had seen them form and come on, sometimes slowly,
sometimes with the speed of an express train. On occasion he had
been given far-away warning; on other occasions he had been
struck within a period of ten minutes. So now he studied the
clouds with a searching attention over a quarter hour, sending
the sleigh along at a fast clip. It would be a storm of some
severity, he decided, but probably not as dangerous as those of
midwinter had been and not possessing that dense drive of snow
which completely blotted out the earth. By this time he had
reached the halfway point between Romain's and Benson's. In one
sudden flip of decision he made up his mind to continue to
Benson's.</p>

<p>He had enough experience to possess great respect for those
northern clouds bearing down upon him; therefore he checked his
position in relation to the nearest culvert on the railroad and
made a quick guess of the length of time it would take him to
reach Benson's. He oriented himself carefully, knowing that when
darkness closed in he would have to depend entirely on the
feeling of the earth as it lifted and dropped beneath the sleigh.
The telegraph poles ran die-straight westward, the yellow station
house at Tie Siding marched up and fell behind. He got out his
watch and marked the time he passed it. If the storm closed in he
would then have one kind of a bearing when he turned about.</p>

<p>Nothing yet disturbed the cold still air around him; up north
the height and breadth of the jagged clouds told of a tremendous
wind rushing forward&mdash;and behind the clouds marched a
spreading blackness in which fury lived. The sight of it made him
revise his judgment, made him take out his compass and get a
course on the Benson house. It lay directly along the telegraph
poles, one point south of due west. As long as light lasted the
telegraph poles would be sufficient, but when the storm's strange
night fell, with its wild crying and its pressure against the
team and its smother of snow, the poles would be
indistinguishable ten feet distant.</p>

<p>At four o'clock, the Benson house was forty-five minutes
before him and in clear view. At ten minutes after four there was
no Benson house to be seen. Day drained out of the sky and
through the stillness he heard the distant reverberation of wind,
like the trembling echo of a waterfall, like the shuddering of
volcanic action. He looked into the sleigh's bed to see if his
mail and light cargo were secure; he snugged his collar around
his neck and lifted his scarf to the bridge of his nose and
suddenly put the team to a run. He had sensed a possibility of
outracing the storm by a scant margin.</p>

<p>In another ten minutes he hauled the team down to a steady
walk. He had lost his race even then and realized he had to
conserve the mules for the emergency which would come when the
blizzard struck. Blackness moved over the sky like an unrolling
carpet and one first streak of wind puffed softly across the
stillness. The mules had been plugging steadily along but now the
touch of the wind disturbed them and they broke into a trot.
Shafter let them keep the pace, meanwhile watching the gray wall,
boiling from earth to heaven, move on with its stately terrible
power; great lances of grayness puffed forward from its crests,
like the spray blown from mile-wide, mile-high waves. Wind grew
brisker about Shafter and as the churning blackness rushed upon
him he heard the voice of the storm slowly lift at him with its
mixture of tortured sounds. He looked at his watch, putting his
head close to the dial. The time was then twenty-five minutes
past four and the Benson house was another thirty minutes ahead.
Looking up from the watch he thought he saw a flash of light
reach forward from the house, but at once realized it was a
single wafer of snow whipping by. He had scarcely stuffed the
watch into his pocket when the full pressure of the blizzard,
moving across the earth at fifty miles an hour, came upon him and
round about him and seized him and shook him in the sleigh's seat
and became a great yelling in his ears. A wall of hardened snow
hit him and closed steadily down until he had only a vague sight
of the mules.</p>

<p>He felt them give to the wind's pressure and pulled them back,
northward, and felt them give again. He changed course slightly,
passing a telegraph pole within arm's distance and calculating
the location of the next pole; in this way, fighting the team's
drift, he made his departure from one pole and his landfall on
another, observing that he missed the poles by wider and wider
margins as he went on. The pressure of the storm thus grew
greater and his forward progress became a game of guessing how
far northward it was necessary to swing. Meanwhile he took to
counting the poles, realizing he could not read the watch in the
pit-black darkness now surrounding him. He made his rapid
estimate of distance. It was a rough four miles to Benson's and
there were thirty poles to the mile; that would make 120 poles
between this point and Benson's, the poles standing 176 feet
apart.</p>

<p>He drew hard to the north. He counted the approximate distance
before the next pole should show its thin blur near by, and saw
nothing; he hauled hard to the north again, tension pulling at
the muscles of his belly.</p>

<p>He counted the seconds slowly in his head. He thought: "Maybe
I'm swinging too much," and strain piled up in him. But the force
of the wind had gotten always greater and he knew his own senses
were tricking him and therefore kept drawing to the right until
it appeared to him he was traveling due north.</p>

<p>He had by then gone a distance sufficient to include three
poles and had seen nothing. There was only one way left him of
checking his whereabouts. Pulling around through what seemed a
forty-five-degree turn, he headed full into the teeth of the
wind. The team fought him and fell off against the wind; he
brought it back and used the ends of his reins to push it on. The
sleigh rose with a roll of snow and tipped down and he felt the
runners grit and bump along spotty covering over the railroad
ties. He had struck the right-of-way.</p>

<p>He turned with it and followed it. A snowplow had recently cut
a partial way through here, leaving shoulders to either side of
the track; thus more or less guided, the mules could not swing
off as freely, and now settled to a steady pulling. Meanwhile he
counted the poles he could not see, judging the distance between.
When he passed the thirtieth pole he started from the beginning
again and in this manner covered the second mile.</p>

<p>The wind and the sheer weight of the coldness got through him.
He felt it first in his legs as a stiffness and then as a pain;
and then he felt it in his bones. He began to kick his feet
against the sleigh's floor. "Twenty-three," he said, and kicked
the floor, "twenty-four," and kicked again. He had the muffler
drawn twice around his head, but the wind flung its rioting
racket against his ears until the steady pulse of sound bothered
him.</p>

<p>This was the first break in a man's armor, the first aperture
through which the blizzard flung itself eventually to break down
sense of direction, to destroy hope, to bring on the panic that
made men disbelieve themselves and at last turn with the wind and
let it carry them to destruction. It was the incessant sound
which first drummed the balance out of a man's mind, and
afterwards it was a knowledge of legs slowly freezing. He was in
the center of blackness, feeling the blackness whirl around him
so swiftly and so powerfully that he grew dizzy. For a moment he
closed his eyes. When he opened them the team had stopped.</p>

<p>He brought the reins sharply down on the mules' rumps. He
said, "Thirty. Two more miles."</p>

<p>The mules started, went a few halfhearted feet, and again
stopped. He lifted the ends of the reins, but suddenly remembered
that there was a short low trestle over a coulee two miles east
of Benson's house; the mules had come upon the trestle and were
afraid of it. Pulling them around, he drove over a hump of snow
and sighted a pole as it slid by, and now once more he aimed his
course from pole to pole.</p>

<p>He was in the middle of the third mile when he realized the
mules were playing out. The poles came up from the blackness more
slowly and the team swung farther from the wind and was harder to
rein back. At the twenty-sixth pole on the third mile the team
faltered and came to a stop.</p>

<p>He lashed out with the end of his reins and got the sleigh
going. He said "Twenty-seven," and waited what seemed a long
while for the twenty-eighth pole. He picked it up and then sat
back for the next one. Suddenly he thought: "I was pretty slow in
reaching out to slap those mules." He had thought he had swung
his arm instantly, but now that he got to studying it, he
realized he had sat motionless for a good ten seconds. The bitter
cold had begun to paralyze his mind and the knowledge of it
flashed the sense of danger through him. He stamped his feet on
the sleigh's floor and he yelled into the wind, "Now I'll stretch
my right arm," and felt his muscles gradually respond. It was
like sending a ball rolling down a bowling alley and waiting for
it to strike&mdash;his will moving that reluctantly toward his
muscles.</p>

<p>He reached the first pole of the fourth mile. The wind keeled
him on the seat; the force of it shoved the sleigh sidewise and
the screaming sound of the storm grew more and more shrill until
his ears vibrated with the steadiness of the impact. He pulled
the mules around with greater difficulty and knew that he could
afford to waste little more energy in this kind of wrestling and
turned the team north again, rising onto a shoulder of snow and
dropping into the railroad cut. It took a great load off his mind
thus to be traveling in a certain direction; at the same time he
began again to count slowly, thereby estimating the passage of
the telegraph poles, which he could not see. The thirtieth pole
should, if his calculations had been right, bring him opposite
Benson's house. If he missed Benson's, the road would carry him
directly into Bismarck, but he knew he could not nurse the team
the additional five miles.</p>

<p>He kept stamping his feet until he discovered he had lost all
feeling in them; his right side, so steadily pounded by the wind,
had grown stiff. He stopped the team as soon as he thus realized
he was slowly freezing, and stepped from the sleigh. He held the
reins and walked forward, no sensation of weight on his feet, and
got to the head of the team and led it forward.</p>

<p>The physical exertion warmed him, but it tired him. He
thought: "I'm not that soft," and knew at once how much the
blizzard had sapped him. He put the reins over his shoulder,
guiding the mules as well as pulling them on against their
inclination to stop. He had passed the fiftieth pole when he
began to watch the left forward distance for Benson's house
lights. He thought he saw those lights and stared steadily until
the mealy agitation of snow made a heaving up-and-down confusion
in his brain. He closed his eyes and walked half a dozen paces,
and opened them again. There were no lights.</p>

<p>When he had counted the twentieth pole he began to visualize
the ten poles remaining. He made a picture of them in his mind
and saw how far they stretched out and he thought: "I may have to
let the team go and walk on." But he argued himself out of the
impulse. He had a terrible feeling of futility and a growing
conviction that he lacked the energy to cover the distance. Then
he pushed the doubt out of his mind by arguing with himself about
the mules again. "It's too good a team to abandon. The off mule
is a little the smartest, and a little the meanest. Same as
people are. The smarter they are the crueler they can be.
Something there for me to think about when I reach Lincoln. Can't
give up the mules. Or the mail..."</p>

<p>He walked straight into a signal post stuck up beside the
right-of-way and struck it with his face. It should have hurt him
badly, but the pain was something that traveled very slowly to
his consciousness. The team had stopped behind him. He put his
hand on the post and felt upward until he reached the square
board on top of the post&mdash;and he stood still, the wind
pushing him against the post and the scream of the wind pulling
his thoughts apart. He put them patiently together again, trying
to make a picture of the railroad as it moved toward Bismarck,
trying to spot the signal board's location.</p>

<p>"Why, hell," he said, "this is the Benson whistle-stop sign.
The house is two hundred feet straight south."</p>

<p>The discovery shot a jet of warmth through him. He crawled
back along the side of the near mule and got into the sleigh and
he squared the team into the south, with the wind full at his
back. Then he said: "There's one more sign, a mile away from the
Benson sign, but I can't have misjudged my distance that much."
The whole thing now was a toss-up, for he was no longer certain,
and he sat still, knowing that if he failed to strike the Benson
house at the first try, the team would not face the weather and
return to the track. Suddenly he brought the rein ends down on
the mules. "Hya&mdash;hya," he yelled. "Get on Babe.
Butcher!"</p>

<p>They had stood still too long and now were slow in starting.
He slashed their rumps with the reins and got them into motion.
He felt them strain upward on the ridge of snow and falter. He
hit them again and yelled at the top of his voice. The sleigh
tilted, came to the snow's summit and dropped down. The mules,
driven by the wind, slogged slowly through the snow.</p>

<p>He was again counting time slowly, and guessing distance. He
stared ahead of him for Benson's lights and he grumbled, "Come
on&mdash;put that lamp in the window. Forty-two seconds,
forty-three seconds..."</p>

<p>There was a flurry of snow in front of him, a flickering
screen of it across his eyes; and then he realized it was a ray
of house light which had made the snow visible. The mules had
stopped again and when he watched the snow a moment he saw the
light shining ahead. He was directly against the house's
porch.</p>

<p>It never occured to him to step down and go to the house.
Instead, he guided the team to the left and made a patient
circle, driving the sleigh close by the walls. Darkness came
solidly down again as soon as the house light faded, but he had
the picture of Benson's yard wholly clear in his mind and went on
with confidence. When the team stopped, Shafter got down and went
ahead, touching the wall of Benson's barn. He scraped his hand
along the wall until he found a door latch and rolled the door
open and pulled team and sleigh into the barn's runway. He hauled
the door almost shut and turned and put his back to it. He spoke
to himself aloud, with a drunken man's labored
distinctness:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Better stay here until I thaw out. Better not go into a warm
house."</p>

<p>Exhaustion hit him on the head like a maul. He felt his feet
slide forward a little so that he was braced against the wall.
His belly was empty and his throat dry; and his body was a
patchwork of feeling and stinging aches and numbness. He slapped
his hands together and he said: "They're all right." He took off
his Berlin gloves and slid his hands underneath the muffler which
lay ice-cemented around his throat and ears. He pinched his ears.
He pulled away the muffler and began a steady rubbing. Streaks of
colored light swam across his pupils and he was distinctly
unbalanced from the pounding of the storm, and for a little while
the quietness in the barn bothered him. He felt the wind lean
against the wall and strain it and he heard the shrilling of the
eaves and the rattle of sleet against the roof. Sensation came to
his ears.</p>

<p>He walked through the darkness toward the mules. He said:
"Babe&mdash;Butch," and walked around and around the sleigh,
stamping his feet as he traveled. He was greatly tired and wanted
to sit down, but he kept himself moving. He said, "Babe," again
and unhitched the team and groped in the dark for a quarter hour
to remove the harness. He was as weak as a man recovering from a
long fever, every motion of his hand requiring a deliberate push
of his will. He let the harness fall on the ground and he let the
mules go and turned to the door. When he stepped outside, the
storm nailed him to the wall so that he had to wheel sideways and
go shoulder first into the wind; he guided himself by the faint
light he saw and reached the house's back door. He hit it once
with his hand, opened, the door and passed into a dark room.
There was a farther door open, through which a light burned with
extraordinary brilliance. He went through the doorway and saw two
blurred forms ahead of him. A woman's voice came sharply at
him.</p>

<p>"Kern&mdash;where've you been?"</p>

<p>She came to him, reaching toward the scarf around his neck and
when she pulled it away, the crusted ice rattling on the floor,
she laid her hands on his ears. "Kern," she said, "you can't stay
in a warm room."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I thawed out in the barn." He closed his
eyes and pushed his fingers against the lids, and opened them to
find Josephine watching him.</p>

<p>"I'll get you some coffee. Are you sure your feet are all
right?"</p>

<p>"Coffee's fine," he said. He looked at the man standing near
the stove in the corner of the room, but the pounding of the
weather still affected his eyes and the heat of the room put a
film on them. Josephine had gone back toward the kitchen. He
looked around the room and saw an army cot made up like a divan
and he went to it and sat down. He bent over and supported his
head with his hands braced against his knees. This was
uncomfortable and presently he lay back on the cot.</p>

<p>When Josephine returned he was sound asleep. She stood over
him a moment, worrying about him. "He was coming from Fargo and
got caught in it. He must have lost his team. Edward, help me
take his boots and socks off. If his feet are frozen we'll have
to wake him up."</p>

<p>Garnett said irritably: "It is a strange thing he should come
to this house, with two hundred miles of space between Fargo and
Bismarck."</p>

<p>She looked back at the lieutenant. "Under the circumstances,
I'm very glad he's here. Help me with his boots."</p>

<p>Garnett said: "I'd do anything for you, Josephine, but I will
not touch him."</p>

<p>"This is no time to be hating him. He may lose his feet."</p>

<p>"Let him crawl around on his hands and knees."</p>

<p>"Edward," she said, shocked, "no human being should carry that
kind of thought in his head."</p>

<p>"You don't know," he murmured. "You can't possibly know how I
feel about him, or how he feels about me. There is no use of
hiding it. I'd be lying to you if I said I was sorry for him. I
regret he survived the storm. For his part, he would stand over
me and let me die and never lift a hand."</p>

<p>He stood back and watched her haul at Shafter's boots. She got
them off and stripped away his heavy wool socks. She put her
hands on Shafter's feet; she pinched the white skin around his
ankles and watched a faint spot of color come to the flesh.
Garnett's expression turned distasteful as he viewed this. A
protest came out of him. "Don't dirty your beautiful hands on
him."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what was between you two. You've done something
to him, haven't you, Edward?"</p>

<p>"I have done my best to ruin him," said Garnett coolly. "As he
has done his best to ruin me."</p>

<p>"I think he has more generosity in him than you have,
Edward."</p>

<p>Garnett's mouth formed a small, acid smile. "Wait and see."
Then he remained still a long while, his hands laced behind him,
darkly speculating. "Josephine," he said finally, "no matter what
happens next, please remember I have never said an insincere
thing to you."</p>

<p>"Why? What can happen?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see," said Garnett.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; A SINNER TURNED
HOLY</h2>

<p class="first">SHAFTER woke with one thought uppermost in his
mind: "I've got to get up and find a place to sleep tonight." The
room was dark, and the windows showed the blackness of the outer
world. The storm had blown itself away, its abrupt end a surprise
to him. He turned his head to see a light in the kitchen and a
woman moving about. He lifted himself on the cot; his clothes
were on but his shoes had been removed, and he had blankets over
him. The weariness was gone. This little half hour's nap had
freshened him and taken even the memory of the storm's beating
from his head; he felt fine, and said to himself: "I'm almost as
good now at thirty-two as I was at twenty." Almost as good, but
not quite, for no man could expect to keep forever the bubble of
energy of that younger age; and when a man got older he got
wiser&mdash;and wisdom always had a little bit of fear in it.
"When you're young," he thought, "you're too dumb to know all the
things that could kill you."</p>

<p>He got up and moved into the kitchen to find Josephine at the
stove. The little kitchen table was set and the smell of coffee
and bacon was a stimulant to him. Josephine said: "How do you
feel?" She smiled at him.</p>

<p>"Fine," he said, "fine. Half an hour's rest does a lot."</p>

<p>"Nearer ten hours," she said. "It is six o'clock in the
morning."</p>

<p>He looked out of the window; he looked at his watch. "That's a
strange one," he said, and went to the back porch. He cracked the
ice from a water bucket and washed his face. Josephine opened the
door briefly to hand him a towel, and he stood in the brittle
stillness of the morning, savoring the softer, warmer smell that
this day brought. Light made a dull crack in the east, but there
was a silver haze hanging over the land&mdash;the kind of fog
that would last indefinitely and shut out the sun. Snowdrifts lay
in molded shapes against the walls of the house, banked halfway
up the windows. The blizzard had punished him, and left his skin
as tender as though it had been seared by fire, but even so he
had already forgotten the misery of that four-mile ride. He was
in good spirits, and hungry, and pleased with his survival as he
turned back into the kitchen.</p>

<p>He sat down to breakfast. Josephine poured coffee for him and
for herself and took a place opposite. She sat quietly by, her
face rose-colored and pretty by the stove's heat; she sipped her
coffee, now and then watching him but offering no comment.</p>

<p>"How do you come to be here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We were out for a ride and saw the blizzard coming. We got
here about two hours before you did. Where were you when it
started?"</p>

<p>"Halfway between here and Romain's. What time did I get
here?"</p>

<p>"It was half-past seven."</p>

<p>"Four miles in two hours and a half," he said. He shook his
head. "I didn't think it took that long. No wonder I got
cold."</p>

<p>"You were dead-beat," she said.</p>

<p>He ate his meal and sat back with his cigar. Josephine rose to
pour him another cup of coffee, a serene and thoughtful
expression composing her face. He noticed it now as he had so
often before. "Where are the Bensons?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They were on the way to Bismarck when we passed them. So I
suppose the storm held them in town."</p>

<p>Daylight slowly seeped through the windows, muddy and sullen.
He got up from his place, now thinking about his mules. "Time to
get on. It was a first-class blizzard. The last shot in the
carbine, I guess, before spring comes. I doubt if we'll have
another. My last trip, more than likely. The train will be
running next week."</p>

<p>He heard somebody stepping along the front room, behind him,
and he noticed the girl's face tighten. He thought nothing about
it as he stood there; he felt like a man who had gone through a
big drunk&mdash;bruised and sore but all sweet and cleaned out
inside. Everything was fine and he had no bad memories or
cares.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that cut on your head?"</p>

<p>He raised his hand to it and ran a finger along a welt which
stretched from the bridge of his nose back to the line of his
hair. He had to stop to think about it before he remembered. "I
walked into the signal post out in front of the house. That's
what saved my bacon. I knew I was on top of Benson's then. It
steered me right in."</p>

<p>"You took chances, Kern."</p>

<p>"I thought I could beat out the storm. I guess I got a little
careless." He turned around and faced the living-room doorway,
and at that same moment he saw Garnett come across the front room
and stop. Garnett looked at him, his eyes narrowed, his mouth
pulled long and firm; there was a thin and bright attentiveness
in his glance and he held himself on guard, as though he knew
trouble had to come between them.</p>

<p>Shafter removed his cigar. Red color showed freshly along his
neck and a rough expression tumbled over his face. He looked, the
girl thought, like a man who suddenly had stumbled upon something
dangerous and unpleasant, something for whom he had maintained a
lifelong animosity. He held the cigar in his hand, reading
Garnett, and being read by Garnett. Presently Shafter turned his
head to the girl and she saw what he thought.</p>

<p>"This is the man you came riding with?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "It is as I explained to you. The storm
caught us."</p>

<p>"I know," said Shafter, very quietly. Then he asked her an odd
question. "Has he had breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No. But why?"</p>

<p>He almost smiled as he pointed to the revolver and belt on
Garnett's waist. "He eats breakfast with his gun."</p>

<p>"You know why it's there," said Garnett.</p>

<p>"Why is it?" Josephine asked.</p>

<p>"He's away from the fort," said Shafter, murmuring the
words.</p>

<p>"There's nothing on this side of the river to be afraid of,"
she pointed out. "These Indians on the east bank are all
right."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Shafter. "But I'm here."</p>

<p>"You see?" said Garnett to her. "He knows why I've got
it."</p>

<p>She studied the two, worried and gradually growing impatient.
"I think you are both fools."</p>

<p>"That's probably true," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"You've had your meal," said Garnett. "Go on, get out of
here."</p>

<p>Shafter's face held its creased half-smile. He had his head
slightly bent as he watched the lieutenant. He murmured: "Up to
the same old tricks, Garnett?"</p>

<p>The girl caught the meaning of it and spoke quietly, ignoring
the chance to grow furious at him. "I told you how it was. You
were caught in the same blizzard, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Don't explain anything to him," said Garnett sharply.</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed Shafter. "The Lieutenant never
explains. There isn't time enough&mdash;even if he lived to be an
old man&mdash;for him to explain all he's got behind him."</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Garnett coolly, "mind what I tell you or I'll
have you courtmartialed for disobeying me."</p>

<p>"Stand aside from the door," said Shafter. "I'm going in there
to get my cap and I don't want to get the smell of a scoundrel on
me."</p>

<p>"According to the record," said Garnett in a jeering tone,
"who's the scoundrel? You're making a scene for the lady. If I
had you in my company I'd break you."</p>

<p>"If I were in your company," said Shafter, "somebody would be
broken in due time, no doubt. Stand aside, Beau."</p>

<p>The name, the girl noticed, pricked Garnett's coldness. His
eyes heated and for a moment he balanced in the doorway, thinking
of the answer he wanted to make. Then he stepped into the kitchen
and cleared the doorway. Shafter went past him and crossed the
room to the cot. He got his cap off the floor and he took his
muffler from a wall hook where it had been hung by Josephine to
dry during the night. He stood with his back to the kitchen while
he wrapped the muffler around his neck. He started to put on his
overcoat, but then he got a thought in his head which turned his
face tough, and he folded the coat over his arm and went back to
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Garnett had taken a seat at the end of the table. He sat on
the edge of the chair, his body turned so that he might watch
Shafter, who now came through the doorway and paused. Shafter
looked at the girl. He said softly: "My advice to you is to get
out of this house."</p>

<p>She was under strain, fearing what might happen. "Kern," she
said, "don't say any more. You've said enough."</p>

<p>"That's right," he agreed. "I've talked enough." He dropped
the coat and came against the back of Garnett's chair. Garnett
started to rise, but Shafter's arms closed about him and pinned
him to the chair; then he let go with one arm and used the butt
of his palm to crack Garnett on the temple, and after that he
reached down and knocked away Garnett's hand as it struggled to
reach the gun. He caught the gun out of Garnett's holster and
stepped back and threw it to the far corner of the kitchen. He
was laughing quietly.</p>

<p>"Now, Beau."</p>

<p>Garnett sat still a long dragged-out moment, his head sagged
down. The girl mistook his silence and sharply spoke: "Kern,
you've injured him! Don't you know what he can have done to
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Garnett made a springing rush from the chair, avoiding
Shafter's outreaching arm. He raced through the doorway,
momentarily out of sight. Shafter wheeled and started after him,
hearing Josephine's voice suddenly grow shrill:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Benson's rifle&mdash;on the wall!"</p>

<p>He rushed through the door in time to see Garnett rip the
rifle from the wall and bring it up to him. The round, dark
muzzle centered on Shafter and wavered a moment. He whirled and
ducked as the roar of the gun filled the room with its dry crash
and he felt the wind of the bullet against him and heard it tick
through the far wall. He charged straight against Garnett as the
latter took two backward steps. He knocked the gun aside and hit
Garnett with the point of his shoulder and smashed him against
the wall; he brought up one arm and rammed it across Garnett's
windpipe, and seized the gun and got it free and flung it into a
corner. He stepped back again, his head still slightly bent as he
watched the man.</p>

<p>"Now's the time, Beau."</p>

<p>"Do you know what I'll have done to you?" cried Garnett.</p>

<p>"You're hiding behind somebody else again," said Shafter.
"You're always trying to find somebody else to settle your
scores. Like Conboy. Like other times I could bring back to you.
But right now, it is just the two of us. Do you know what I'm
going to do, Beau? I am going to destroy an illusion of
manliness. I am going to cripple you past the point where any
other woman will want you. When I think of the women&mdash;"</p>

<p>Josephine, now at the kitchen doorway, cried at Shafter:
"Don't, Kern!"</p>

<p>Garnett stepped sidewise along the wall, toward a corner, as
Shafter watched him. Suddenly Garnett reached a chair and seized
it and flung it up over his head and came forward, his face
slashed by the intensity of his thinking as he swung the chair
and flung it down and forward. Shafter raised one arm and took
the blow, and shunted the chair aside. He stepped on and drove a
punch deep into Garnett's flank, into the soft flesh just above
the hip. Garnett cried out a hurt breath and let the chair drop
and wheeled and sprang at Shafter, both hands swinging. One of
his fists struck Shafter on the cheek, sending Shafter back.</p>

<p>But he was still hunting for a weapon, and momentarily turned
his head, thus exposing himself. Shafter jumped in and staggered
the lieutenant with a blow against his belly. Garnett struck the
wall and his mouth sprang open and in this defenseless moment he
was at Shafter's mercy. Shafter hit him slantingly on the mouth,
drawing blood. He watched Garnett's head drop and roll aside. He
waited for his chance and when he saw it he hooked another side
blow across Garnett's nose. He knew he had done the man damage,
for he heard Garnett's yell rise.</p>

<p>Garnett came against him and took his punishment; he seized
Shafter around the waist and held on and pushed Shafter toward
the stove with a great burst of strength. He shoved Shafter
against its hot sides and he stiffened his legs behind him and
spent all his remaining energy in that one effort to hold Shafter
there.</p>

<p>The smell of Shafter's scorched clothing began to stink in the
room. Shafter felt the flare of pain on the backs of his legs. He
got an arm around Garnett's head and gave it a twist that threw
the man off balance. He slid suddenly aside and saw Garnett throw
both hands against the hot top of the stove to keep himself
upright. Garnett cried out and drew back with his hands half open
before him. The pain of it made him forget Shafter who, now
behind him, came up and sledged him on the side of the neck and
drove him across the room. Garnett turned and shoved his arms
defensively before him. Shafter hit him on the mouth and drove a
punch into his belly and watched the man drop.</p>

<p>He stood over Garnett, breath drawing deep, and bitterly
regretted he had not more permanently damaged those handsome
features which had caused so much ruin. This was not like his
fight with Conboy, in which the end of the struggle brought also
an end to bad feeling; this was like no other fight in his life.
He was dissatisfied, his thirst unquenched; he looked down and
hated the man more violently than before, and knew he would never
cease to hate him. He waited there with the hope that Garnett
would rise up and try again. He said: "Now's the time. Beau. Get
up. Just one more try. Maybe you can reach another chair. Maybe
you can get one of the guns. You can try, Beau. If you shot me,
you wouldn't be held for it. You know that. Get up and try
it."</p>

<p>He stepped back another pace, giving Garnett a chance to make
his turn, his jump, his lunge. He thought the man's silence was
faked; he thought Garnett heard him, and waited. Blood rolled
down Garnett's lips and he breathed in the shallow, fast and
sucking way of an exhausted man; suddenly he gave a hard groan
and rolled to his back and laid a hand over his broken nose.
Shafter got a glance at the man's eyes and knew then the fight
was over.</p>

<p>He stood still with the memory of a ten-year injustice burning
through him, unquenched. He murmured: "God damn you, Garnett,
you've always got a way of sliding out. You'll crawl out of this,
like you crawled out before, and you'll carry your rotten
business on. I ought to break your back."</p>

<p>Garnett swayed gently from side to side, on the floor. His
legs rose and dropped as steady reflexes of pain pulsed through
him. He groaned: "You've broken my nose."</p>

<p>"I hope it heals crooked," said Shafter. He had grown cooler
and now he shrugged his shoulders and turned into the kitchen.
Halfway to the rear door he wheeled rapidly, entered the living
room again and picked up Benson's rifle. He ejected the shells
and put them in his pocket and laid the gun on its rack; in the
kitchen he retrieved Garnett's revolver and removed its loads and
left the gun empty on the table.</p>

<p>Josephine had come into the kitchen. When he moved toward the
back door she halted him with her voice.</p>

<p>"He'll have you courtmartialed. You have put yourself in his
hands."</p>

<p>He had forgotten her for a little while. He stared at her,
aware of her beauty as he always was. She was a fair woman, with
hungry dreams seeking answer; and Garnett, whose profession was
women, had at once known the vividness of her dreaming, her
eagerness to believe and to respond to those things which seemed
to come as answers to all longings. It was a cheap and easy and
dirty profession, preying upon the near things of a woman's soul,
betraying them and leaving the woman stripped of illusion.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "He won't. He can't bring charges against me
without explaining the circumstances and involving you. He won't
do that. Not that he'd have any scruples about giving you away,
but he'd be exposing himself."</p>

<p>"Exposing himself to what?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To other women who now think they share his interest
exclusively," said Shafter.</p>

<p>She stood stone-quiet, her face fixed in a cold distasteful
expression. She murmured: "You make this a very unpleasant
affair, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I know the man," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Do you know me?" she said.</p>

<p>"You went out for an afternoon's ride," he said. "That was
all."</p>

<p>Her answer tumbled swiftly back at him. "Where is the wrong,
Kern? Dig down as deep as you want and find me an
answer&mdash;the worst answer you can find."</p>

<p>"There's your answer," he said and pointed through the door
toward the living room. Garnett had risen from the floor and now
walked slowly forward and supported himself in the doorway. He
looked upon these two with his battered face, his crushed lips
and his bold nose now broken at the bridge; he looked at them
with a dull indifference, and listened as though their words came
through fog to him.</p>

<p>"What has he to do with me?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Everything he touches&mdash;"</p>

<p>She cut in and finished the phrase for him. "Turns bad. That's
what you think. You were hurt once, and you stopped growing. You
have spent the last years of your life shrinking smaller, drawing
away for fear of getting hurt again. You've done a good job of
making a very unimportant man out of yourself, Kern. You might
have been a big one. I've thought of that often and it has
troubled me to see so much turn into so little. There's more fun
and honesty in living than you know about. It has passed you by.
You think Edward is evil? So are you. Evil in the way you let
hate and suspicion feed upon your soul."</p>

<p>Shafter bowed his head slightly. "You may be right," he said,
and left the room.</p>

<p>She stood still, hearing his feet crackle through the snow
crust as he went toward the barn; she was very attentive to that,
forgetting the presence of Garnett. The anger died out of her and
her face lost its temper; her shoulders dropped.</p>

<p>"That's the girl," said Garnett. "You've hit him hard. I know
how he looks when he's been beaten. I know the look on his
face."</p>

<p>She had her back to Garnett. "Edward, as soon as Kern has
driven away, get your team and cutter ready. We're going
home."</p>

<p>He said: "Look at me."</p>

<p>She kept her position for a little while and when she did turn
she was sorry to show him the feeling she knew he would see. He
was a clever man with his eyes; he read what lay within
people&mdash;that was his gift. He had, she realized, frequently
read her mind or her wishes and had changed his mood to suit her,
his manner to please her. In a way it was a versatility not quite
honest, a skill that came of practice. She remembered then what
Kern had said about him: "To other women who now think they share
his interest exclusively."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Edward," she said.</p>

<p>He said: "You liked me yesterday. You don't like me now. Where
was the change?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Never mind. Let's go."</p>

<p>"He made the change, didn't he? You believe what he said about
me?"</p>

<p>"Let's not bother to go into it. A thing changes. People
change."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you believe him. And all those hard words you
used on him meant nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I meant them."</p>

<p>He managed a thin smile. "You intended to hurt him, but you
never intended to drive him off. You want him to come back. It is
a very old way with a woman."</p>

<p>"You would know, wouldn't you?" she said quietly.</p>

<p>"It has been used on me more than once." He looked at her,
withdrawing his smile. "I never have tried to cover up my
weaknesses to you, Jo. I knew it was no good. If you had been
just another woman with me, I would have used all the tricks in
the book."</p>

<p>"You know the book very well."</p>

<p>"I don't deny it." He sighed and struggled with the pain
pulsing through him. "When I saw you I knew I had come to
something serious. You are the first woman with whom I have ever
wanted to be honest. As soon as I realized that, I was afraid. I
knew what was behind me. I knew you'd discover it sooner or
later&mdash;as any woman will come to know about a man. That's
why I told you to believe in me, whatever happened. I wanted you
to know I meant to play the game right with you." He shrugged his
shoulders, the weight of his thoughts fatally on him. "A sinner
turned holy&mdash;and confronted with his sins."</p>

<p>"I believe you," she told him quietly.</p>

<p>"But now believing is not enough," he murmured. "There's too
much behind me, and too little left in me."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Let's go home."</p>

<p>He went back to the living room and got into his coat and left
the house, soon bringing the cutter around. He helped her up and
turned toward Bismarck through a lowering overcast which closed
the horizons down. She looked for the shape of Shafter's sleigh
in the distance and didn't see it.</p>

<p>"Edward," she said, "don't use your power as an officer over
him now. Let all this die."</p>

<p>He gave a strange, almost irrational laugh which made her
glance sharply at him. She said, "You're hurt, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"That's another thing about a woman. She goes through storm
and then expects sunshine to erase the memory of storm. You
misjudge me and you misjudge Shafter. Nothing will stop the way
we feel. Nothing will stop me from getting at him."</p>

<p>"Edward," she said, "don't make yourself less than you
are."</p>

<p>He shook his head and said nothing more until they reached the
front of her house. She dropped out of the cutter and looked back
at him a moment, sad for the way things had been, sorry that she
had hurt him. He read that in her, too, with his eyes. He
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shan't see you again, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He nodded. Then he said: "But you must understand something
else about Shafter. I know him better than any other person. You
believe he'll come back because&mdash;as you have already
discovered&mdash;he's in love with you." He smiled in his bitter
way. "But he won't come back. He never goes back to anything.
Good-by, Jo."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; BOOTS AND
SADDLES</h2>

<p class="first">ONE night the regiment lay crowded within the
walls of Fort Lincoln; at tattoo on the following evening it
camped in tents on a level plain three miles south of the fort.
Winter was done and waiting was done. Terry's orders had come
through and the Seventh stretched its legs in the open once more
and smelled the old good odor of canvas and grass and campfire.
There would be a period of preparation before Terry arrived from
St. Paul to lead the expedition on its way.</p>

<p>The regiment was whole again, all its twelve companies lined
up side by side on the plain, each with its company street and
line of tents leading off the main regimental street. Across the
regimental street stood the tent of the commander, now occupied
by Major Reno. Beside the tent of the commanding officer sat the
other tents of the adjutant and staff. Adjoining the cavalry
troops were two companies of the Seventeenth Infantry and one of
the Sixth Infantry; here also were three Gatling guns in charge
of two infantry officers and thirty-two men&mdash;an innovation
looked upon by the cavalry with mixed emotions. Still farther on
lay the wagon park with its one hundred fifty wagons to carry the
quartermaster and commissary supplies, near which camped a
hundred and seventy-five civilian teamsters in their own clannish
group. With the regiment as well was a small party of Ree scouts,
Charley Reynolds, and two interpreters&mdash;Fred Girard and the
Negro Isaiah Dorman. The scout detachment had been placed under
the command of Lieutenant Charles Varnum.</p>

<p>Here it lay under the early May sunshine, a sprawling unit on
the plain, the white tops of its tents softly shining, the year's
early dust rising from its steady activity, its day hourly marked
by the throaty summons of the trumpets, with despatch riders
whirling in from Lincoln and Bismarck and slow freight caravans
arriving to round out the regiment's supplies; with scout details
trotting out for their daily sweeps westward and returning jaded
at night, one day coated with dust and the next day freckled with
the mud of a seasonal shower. Throughout the hours the companies
drilled, the sharp calls of officers and noncoms floating through
the bland late-spring air and the horses wheeling and crowding
and moving with the precision of long training, and metal gear
singing its minor metal tunes, and saddle leather squealing, and
carbines slapping on their slings. Throughout the hours, too,
details filed away to the foot of a small ridge for target
practice.</p>

<p>This was the shake-down of a regiment whose units had been
long separated. Men sweated off the fat of winter and refreshed
their memories of duties grown vague by disuse. Equipment was
overhauled, and replaced, guns tested and clothing mended or
newly issued. Old men coached recruits and hazed them with the
time-yellowed tricks of the service. New cavalry mounts were
broken at the corrals and officers found bizarre flaws in old
horses in order to secure younger stock for their commands. The
pieces and parts of the regiment came together, stiffly from long
lack of contact and then smoothly as they daily made union. At
night campfires blazed on the earth, yellow dots against the
velvet shadowing of the land, and men sang, or sat still, or
argued, or wrote last letters homeward, or thought of home and
never wrote; and they sorted out their possessions and extra
equipment and mementoes long prized and sent them back to
barracks to await their return when the campaign was done. All
sabers were boxed and stored and dress uniforms put away.
Threadbare trousers and battered campaign hats appeared,
decorated by the frail blue and yellow flowers now coloring the
prairie.</p>

<p>New faces appeared with the returned
companies&mdash;Lieutenants Godfrey and Hare of K,
Godfrey with a huge nose and a
stringy mustache and long goatee; Captain McDougal, transferred
from E to command B; Lieutenant Mcintosh with the strain of
Indian blood in him, and Lieutenant Wallace with the long neck
and serious manner; Benny Hodgson, a youngster loved by the
command for a sunny disposition; and Porter of I Company, and
Captain Myles Keogh of I, a sharp-eyed, swarthy-skinned man with
a pointed black imperial and indigo black mustache. It was Hines
who described Keogh to Shafter. "There's three soldiers of
fortune in this outfit. Nowlan and DeRudio and Keogh have served
in Europe. Nowlan is a fine one and DeRudio is all right when he
don't get excited and start talkin' Eye-talian at us. This Keogh,
now, is the hardest of the lot, a martinet when he's sober and
one that will throw the back of his hand at a trooper when he
feels like it. We're goin' into this campaign in need of
officers. Professor. We should have thirty-six or more and we've
got but twenty-eight, and some of them are far from bein' the
best in the world. For that matter, we could stand a few more
men. Eight hundred to the regiment is not enough. It is Custer's
idea that we can lick all the Sioux in the West. It is not
mine."</p>

<p>"It looks like Reno in command instead of Custer," said
Shafter.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hines gave him a look, shrugged his shoulders and
turned away.</p>

<p>On May tenth the guardhouse trumpet cracked the afternoon with
its sharp flourish for a general officer and Terry and his staff,
and Custer, whirled out of the prairie and down the regimental
street. It was as though an electrical shock passed through the
command, stiffening it and exciting it. The presence of Terry
meant the beginning of the campaign; and the presence of Custer
meant that ease was over and long marches begun and sudden
strains and unexpected shocks would come to the command. That
night after retreat, the story of Custer was common knowledge in
the camp, spoken of by officers in the presence of the sergeant
major, and mentioned by him to the company sergeants, and in turn
passed down the line. The regiment was a family with no
secrets..</p>

<p>Hines said: "There Custer was in St. Paul, the President with
a thumb on him and pushin' down for the things he'd said in
Washington. And Sherman was out of patience with him, and
Sheridan too. So he was a spanked boy watchin' his regiment go
away and him not with it. Can you see the general pacin' up and
down, cursin' the world because he wasn't out in front wavin' his
big hat and sayin' 'Come on boys'?" Hines looked around him and
grinned.</p>

<p>"So he writes this letter very humble to the President and
Terry writes a nice letter to back him up, and Sherman likewise.
Well, then, the President finally says back to Terry that if
Terry thinks Custer will help on the campaign he'll let Custer
go. But you know what Sherman wired Terry?" Hines's grin
broadened into a laugh and he slapped the mess table with his
hand. "Sherman wires Terry to tell Custer to be prudent, not to
take any newspapermen along with him to write up his glorious
deeds, and to quit makin' remarks about his superior officers in
the future. So we got Custer back?"</p>

<p>"Lickin' his wounds," said Sergeant McDermott. "He was spanked
before the country and he knows it. The more he thinks of it, the
worse it will hurt."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," said Hines.</p>

<p>"You know what he'll do to us now?"</p>

<p>"He'll take it out on us," said Hines. "Be ready to
sweat."</p>

<p>"It is not the sweatin' I think of," said McDermott. "He will
be devisin' ways to make the ones that spanked him look foolish.
He will try to make a big man out of himself again, before the
country. He will whip the Sioux, and then he'll be a hero once
more. What I'm thinkin' is he'll ride this regiment into hell to
do it."</p>

<p>"I guess he'll find hell enough out there to ride into," said
Hines imperturbably. "There is no able-bodied Sioux left on the
reservations. They're out west waitin' for us to come."</p>

<p>"A man in the Seventh," said McDermott glumly, "shouldn't be a
family man."</p>

<p>"There's Terry to hold him down," said Hines.</p>

<p>"He'll do as he did before with Stanley. He'll listen to
orders and march away and disobey 'em."</p>

<p>But Hines scratched his chin, long thinking. He shrugged his
shoulders. "It may all be so. Still, I feel better with him
around. I like to soldier under a man that is masterful at
leadin'. Wherever we go, McDermott, he'll be at the front of us.
We'll never have to look back to see if he's comin'."</p>

<p>"If he don't pull out and leave us to fight it alone," said
McDermott. "Like he did Major Elliot at Washita."</p>

<p>"That," said Hines, "was a long time ago, and a thing full of
argument. Let it be forgotten."</p>

<p>Shafter said: "You're an old horse smelling smoke, Hines."</p>

<p>"The truth," said Hines. "In spring my bones begin to ache
with the memory of twenty-eight years of campaignin' and I sleep
light and wake early and I think of a lot of lads I knew and a
lot of fights we've had, and I want to be at it. I am a fool to
think it, for the feelin' of bein' old has gotten at me lately. I
guess this will be my last campaign."</p>

<p>It was as Hines knew, and as all the regiment suspected. The
winter's ordeal had left Custer raw of nerve and pride; it had
increased his terrific animal energy His rough hand seized the
regiment and shook it into redoubled activity. Officers' call was
a repeated summons through the day and the drill period
lengthened and men toiled late at special-duty chores.
Inspections were repeated, company by company, with Custer's
sharp eyes on everything. By day he was everywhere, whirling out
of camp to the fort, the drill field or rifle range, or simply
rushing headlong into the prairie to give himself a run; at
retreat his nervous, staccato voice cracked across the plain;
late after taps the guards saw his tent lights burning and his
shadow pacing. There was no rest in him.</p>

<p>Crook, the grapevine rumors said, was well under way; and
Gibbon was already as far as the Bighorn, having fought his way
out of the West through the last winter storms. The May weather
turned variable, one day warm and the next day sending down its
riotous sheets of rain which turned the porous earth into spongy
mud and set all the tents a-steaming. The <i>Far West</i> had
already departed upriver with supplies, which would be left at a
base designated by Custer. Terry had, meanwhile, made every
effort to secure advance information of the Sioux whereabouts,
and scouts drifted in fugitively with their information and
drifted secretively out. The Rees, under Bloody Hand, arrived in
camp on the fifteenth and pitched their tents. On the sixteenth
general orders went out; the command would march the following
morning. That night, on the eve of departure, the officers held a
ball on the regimental street and all the ladies came out from
Lincoln, and in the bland evening the music of the regimental
band swung them around and around while the light of campfires
glowed on colored dresses and faded fatigue uniforms.</p>

<p>Shafter stood back, watching the couples&mdash;the
cheerfulness upon the men and the gaiety upon their women. This
was the time, he thought, when a woman looked upon a man with a
sharpened tenderness, when she noticed the things upon a man's
face with a memorizing care, and stored in her mind the little
things said, and matched his carefree air and held back from him
the hard anxiety which lay like a lump in her heart. And this was
the time when a man felt the goodness and the excitement of
soldiering and yet had his own anxieties and tried to conceal
them from the woman with a greater buoyancy. This was the time
when they laughed and concealed harsher thoughts.</p>

<p>He moved back to his tent at tattoo and stretched out on his
bunk. McDermott was writing a letter by candlelight, making hard
work out of it. McDermott looked up at him, scowling. "If you're
going to soldier, Shafter, don't get married."</p>

<p>"Where's your family?"</p>

<p>"Iowa&mdash;Cedar Rapids." McDermott leaned back. "I've got a
boy who's three. Haven't seen him for eight months. I'll be glad
when this enlistment's up." He returned to his letter and
struggled with it and stopped again. "I suppose you've done your
writing already."</p>

<p>"No," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Better do it. I ain't been in the army ten years for nothing,
I know when a campaign's just a march and I know when it's going
to be a fight. This one's going to be a fight. I've seen it come
all winter."</p>

<p>Shafter left the tent, moving down the company street into the
darkness. The band music floated through the windless air, the
swing and lift and melody of it carrying him back through his
memories, evoking scenes half forgotten and feelings long buried.
It shocked him to know suddenly how powerfully the music swayed
him, embittering him for things that had been and now were not,
making him sad out of reasons he could not understand, creating
in him an acute loneliness.</p>

<p>"Here," he said to himself, "you're thirty-two and past
sentiment. You've gotten rid of your dreams. That's what you
wanted, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>He could not stop the outreaching of his thoughts, the strange
swirl of his imagination. He remembered a lace fan lifted before
a woman's face; and then the fan fell and he saw the sharp curve
of her red mouth as she laughed at him, provocation in every soft
curve of her cheeks, and the sound of her voice came over the
great distance like a bell. The ball long since had turned
silent, but the echo remained.</p>

<p>He remembered in sharp, stinging regret the kind of young man
he had been; he recalled the wild flavor of his ambitions, the
endless taste he had for life, the hopes and tempers and formless
dreams which had buoyed him. Faith had been in that young Kern
Shafter, and enthusiasm had made the world a fair place. He
stopped walking; he put his hands behind his back and laced his
fingers together, looking into the lush shadows of the night.
Even now he caught the end of that hot vivid past, and suddenly
said to himself: "When did I stop believing in things?" Somewhere
along the line&mdash;and he knew when it was and how it
was&mdash;he had flung himself upon the sharp point of
disillusion, and it had opened him up and had drained out his
faith; since that time he had walked as a bloodless man, turned
stringy and colorless and heated only by a hatred.</p>

<p>But he saw that lace fan lift again over a woman's face and he
heard her voice speaking to him, and then the fan dropped and the
face was fair and smiling before him. It was another
face&mdash;it was Josephine Russell's face and the smile was for
him as long as it lasted. He watched it darken and die and he
watched the glow of her eyes grow strange. He swung back on his
heels; the music was still warm and beautiful in the night when
he crawled into his blankets; and from the regimental street
drifted the quick, stray phrases and laughter of the officers and
their ladies.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Smith whirled his wife gallantly around, outward
beyond the crowd. The music still played on but he broke away and
took her arm and strolled across the slick prairie grass. "That
makes me think of Saratoga," he said. "We had fun, old girl.
Seems like a long time back. Just five years, though."</p>

<p>She said: "Do you know where I'd like to go again? Remember
that little Connecticut town we passed through? All the houses
painted white. The elms around them."</p>

<p>"We'll have our bills paid by fall," he said slowly. "Then I
shall ask for leave." He stopped and turned her and looked down
at her. "I regret all the things you've missed," he said, and
kissed her.</p>

<p>She stepped back but she held both his arms. "This is the
first time I've ever felt so afraid."</p>

<p>"It shouldn't be a long campaign. We are very well equipped,
and we're going out in substantial numbers. This won't be another
Fetterman affair. I think we'll have it done with by late August
and be on the way home."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Terry's a sound, safe man."</p>

<p>She shook her head, still clinging to him. It was a rare thing
for her to be upset in this manner; both of them had a little
ritual about these partings, which was to make them gay and very
casual. But tonight she could not play the part, and his own
feelings were strange in his chest. "I'm afraid," she said in a
still lower, more breathless voice. "I've been that way all
winter."</p>

<p>"You've stuck too long on the frontier."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "it isn't that." She pulled herself together
and spoke with a pent-up feeling. "I wish the President had kept
Custer away."</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;now," he said. "Anyhow, Custer will be under
Terry's orders."</p>

<p>"If he sees a chance for a grand coup," she said, "he'll
disobey his orders. I hate that man."</p>

<p>"Look here," he said gently, "we're in this regiment for
another twenty years. You must not let your emotions shake you
too much."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she said, "I wish you were not in the army. I
know it is your life and you want no other. But what have you
gotten for all your faithfulness and service? You are beginning
to turn gray. The hard usage of campaigning has done it to you.
What do we have for it? A dozen silver spoons and a few cracked
plates."</p>

<p>He was deeply disturbed and walked on without speaking.
Presently she touched his arm and stopped. He saw a smile come
uncertainly to her face. She murmured: "I won't send you off this
way. Be good and take no unnecessary chances."</p>

<p>"I shall write you faithfully each night," he said.</p>

<p>"We'll be in Connecticut this winter. Fresh apples, fresh
vegetables. New clothes and old friends." He grinned at her and
put his arms around her and kissed her once more; and so they
stood in the darkness clinging to each other and reluctant to
part while the long moments ran by.</p>

<p><br>
IN the four-o'clock darkness the drums of the
infantry and the cavalry trumpets sounded the general and the
glowing tops of the tent city collapsed as by the stroke of a
single hand. Details moved on their crisscross errands, rolling
and packing the canvas and stowing it away in supply wagons.
Water details moved to the river and came back and orderlies
rushed through the wan light of first daylight. Assembly blew and
companies formed, each trooper's voice harking to roll call.
Officers crisply shouted, swinging the companies into regimental
line. The band was ahead and the colors swung by and Custer and
his aides whirled up spectacularly. In the distance a bugler
sounded "Forward" and at the same moment the band broke into
tune. An ancient excitement rippled through Shafter, reviving the
recollections of a hundred other marches in the past. After long
waiting and long preparation, they were under way; over eight
hundred troopers and infantrymen with scouts and guides and the
long lumbering train of wagons rolling behind. The Seventh, in
camp a collection of many men, now became a single-minded weapon,
flexible, obedient and responsive. Ahead, Custer's huge campaign
sombrero swung up in a wide gesture.</p>

<p>Shafter rode as right guide, the captain beside him. Moylan
said: "We're parading through the fort. When we get beyond it
we'll stop to let the wagon train catch up. There will be time
for anybody so wishing to ride back and say so-long. Pass that
word along, Hines."</p>

<p>Then the captain looked at Shafter. "You got somebody to speak
to?"</p>

<p>"No," said Shafter.</p>

<p>Moylan sat straight and blocky in the saddle&mdash;a man
growing old in his uniform. He had an excellent soldier's face,
square and calm and shrewd; he was a good commander, his
strictness tempered with practical wisdom. He saw many things he
pretended not to see; but he always saw what needed to be
seen. Lieutenant Smith rode half down the line. The second
lieutenant, Varnum, had been detached with Hare to command the
Ree scouts. These rode ahead of the regiment.</p>

<p>Somewhere between midnight and reveille it had briefly rained,
so that all the grass stems were beaded with moisture. Morning's
sun came up to lighten a faint fog and a courier galloped back
from the head of the column at a headlong pace. As the troopers
approached the walls of Lincoln they filed past Ree women
gathered wailing and weeping to watch their men go. Moylan looked
thoughtful when he heard it. "That's odd," he said. At Laundress
Row the sergeants' families were likewise gathered and likewise
crying. McDermott, reminded of his own wife and children, began
to curse. Young Lovelace looked down upon the women and presently
he found Mary there; she too had tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>The band struck up the regimental tune, "Garryowen," and so
passed through the gate and marched across the parade. Along
Officers' Row the families had assembled, and townspeople had
come over from Bismarck for the departure. The infantry companies
left in charge of the post were drawn up in rank to salute the
passing column; a handful of troopers, on sick list or detached
duty, marched beside their companions a little distance to say
good-by. Thus the regiment passed through the main guard gate to
the north and swung westward toward the ridge west of the
post.</p>

<p>As A Company filed through the gate, Shafter saw more
townspeople gathered and, looking over toward the little building
of the commissary sergeant, he saw Josephine.</p>

<p>She didn't notice him at the moment. Her glance was on the
column and she seemed to be scanning it very closely, her glance
running through the stretched-out file with a hurried intentness.
Presently she discovered him and her eyes stayed on him as he
rode forward; he observed her face grow tighter than before and
he saw her lips move. He lifted his hat and when he rode on he
felt the effect of her glance. It seemed to remain with him, to
follow him.</p>

<p>Half a mile onward the regiment halted to wait for the supply
wagons to come forward; and the ranks broke, the officers and
married men riding back to perform their own private farewells.
Shafter stood beside his horse, watching them go; he got out his
pipe and filled it and drew smoke heavily into his lungs. He
squatted down on the hard earth, hard in thought, hearing the
cross fire of talk of other troopers around him.</p>

<p>Bierss said: "Your last chance. Bill, on that gal you been
goin' with. She'll have another soldier when you come back."</p>

<p>"I can get another gal."</p>

<p>"Them Sioux women ain't tame," said Bierss.</p>

<p><br>
FRANK LOVELACE walked rapidly down the hill with the
rest of the back-tracking men. He passed groups of people at the
north gate, he heard them talking and laughing&mdash;and he saw a
woman put both her hands on a trooper's shoulder, look long at
him, and begin to weep. He moved across the parade's long length
toward the south side, blindly pulled toward Mary. He hadn't
talked to her for many weeks&mdash;not since the night of the
quarrel&mdash;and he knew that the tears he had seen on her face
were for her father who was also marching away. Or maybe they
were for Purple. Still, he kept going; he couldn't help it. When
he had gotten halfway across the parade he saw her come toward
him. She was running.</p>

<p>He said, "Ah, Mary, don't run!" He raced toward her. She was
speaking to him but he couldn't hear what she was saying. He
stopped just in time to avoid striking her; her arms went around
him and he felt the hard pounding of her heart and her tears ran
hot along his cheeks when he kissed her.</p>

<p>She pulled back to look at him, showing him the terror in her
eyes. "I didn't want you to go away like that, Frank!"</p>

<p>"I was coming to you," he said.</p>

<p>"It didn't mean anything," she said. "I'm sorry if you were
angry. If you'd only turned back instead of walking away."</p>

<p>"I wanted to come back," he said. "I guess I was a big
fool."</p>

<p>The trumpet was blowing from the hill, summoning them back.
The sound of it went hard through him; it made a pain in him. Her
hands dug into his arms and she was trembling&mdash;and once more
terror widened her eyes. "Frank&mdash;Frank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll be back," he said.</p>

<p>"My father likes you. Frank&mdash;"</p>

<p>He kissed her again and turned, pulled by the music. Men were
streaming over the parade and somebody called at him to come
along. She clung to him, so that he had to lift her arms from
him; and though he was very young, he did something that was as
gallant as any mature man could ever do. He lifted her hand and
kissed it, and he smiled and said again, "I'll be back," and
trotted toward the north gate. After a few feet, he looked behind
and noticed that she was walking after him. He called, "No,
Mary." He shook his head and broke into a run. When he reached
the north gate he again looked back and saw her standing in the
center of the parade with her hand raised to him. The sight of
her, so small and lonely on the parade ground's empty sweep, hit
him in the heart.</p>

<p>Several officers had ridden down from the ridge to have a
final moment with their families. Garnett came with them and went
into bachelor's quarters to pick up a small notebook he had
forgotten; when he came out of quarters he looked along Officers'
Row and observed Mrs. Barrows standing before her house; her face
turned toward him and he saw the care and the shadowing cast upon
her features by her thinking. Then she looked away from him and
he noticed the major coming across the parade toward her. Garnett
climbed to his saddle and trotted briskly toward the north
gate.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Smith had meanwhile dismounted before his wife,
campaign hat in hand. He said: "I shall write you faithfully, by
each courier. I really think we'll be back by August. Be a good
girl, keep your hands busy and your mind out of mischief."</p>

<p>"What mischief is there to be found in an army post with all
the healthy men gone?"</p>

<p>"Always one or two handsome beggars floating around."</p>

<p>"Pooh," she said, "I can't flirt with old men. That's all
you're leaving me with."</p>

<p>They were light and foolish with each other. He said: "I shall
come back with a mustache a foot long. One of the scratchy
kind."</p>

<p>"I shall divorce you if you appear with mutton chops."</p>

<p>"It won't be divorce you'll be thinking of, when I show
up."</p>

<p>"You're very egotistical."</p>

<p>The sound of the trumpet came again from the hill; and their
smiling died. He took her to him and he said in a hard, grating
voice: "I shall miss you like hell."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "be careful&mdash;oh, be careful!" He held her
as long as he dared and then wheeled and stepped up to his horse.
He was again smiling, and looking down sharply at her until she
brought a smile resolutely to her lips. "That's it," he said.
"This winter, old girl, we're going to Connecticut. Good-by, my
dear."</p>

<p><br>
SHAFTER sat on the ground, looking down at the post,
his thoughts wholly with Josephine. What stuck with him was the
picture she made, her shoulders against the wall of the
commissary sergeant's house, her eyes so carefully searching the
column and at last stopping upon him. He said to himself: "She
can have little interest in me," but her lips had said something
to him across the distance. Very definitely she had spoken to
him. Suddenly he realized he had to go back to her and discover
if she had spoken to him, if she had anything to say to him. He
rose and went into the saddle, dropping down the hill.</p>

<p>He came to the officers' club and skirted the post gardens.
There were a lot of soldiers and people crowded around the gate
and he didn't immediately see her and he thought she had perhaps
returned to the ferry. Troopers had begun to come out of the
fort, bound back to the column, and from his point of view he
could see the long wagon train crawl around the west edge of the
fort, now nearly caught up with the command; and from the main
column came the sharp notes of the trumpet, summoning the
stragglers. Threading the crowd, he saw her. She still stood by
the house of the commissary sergeant and she had seen him and was
watching him. He came before her and lifted his hat.</p>

<p>"Nice of you," he said, "to come here to watch us go."</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, "you'll be away all summer."</p>

<p>"Never know. Nothing's certain."</p>

<p>She had nothing to add, and for his part he was caught in a
silence which held him fast. Troopers streamed through the north
gate. Captain Moylan passed, saying: "Time to go. Sergeant."
Shafter watched her, with the clearest impression of her beauty
and her strength. These were the things in her which most had
appealed to him&mdash;these which gave her a capacity for
laughter and teasing and gave her, too, a will which could be as
hard as iron.</p>

<p>"Good luck," he said,</p>

<p>"You're the one to need that, Kern. I should be wishing you
the luck."</p>

<p>"Wish it, then," he said.</p>

<p>"If you think it worth remembering," she said, soft and calm,
"I do wish you luck."</p>

<p>He stirred on his saddle. There was a question in his mind,
and a wish and an uncertainty he wanted to be rid of; and he
remembered how sweet her lips were and the vibrations of her
voice when she was stirred. He was on the edge of dismounting and
he had made a move toward it when Garnett rode up from the guard
gate and saw him there. Garnett's voice hit him like a stone.</p>

<p>"Get back to your outfit, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Shafter saw her throw a glance toward Garnett, who swung from
his horse and now stood by her. She looked at Garnett with an odd
expression, and turned her smiling glance again to Shafter, still
and sweet. He bowed his head at her, wheeled the horse and
trotted to A Company.</p>

<p>Custer rushed by, lithe and magnificent on his horse, the
feeling of motion and activity exciting the general. All down the
line the sergeants were bawling at their men. A single word
rippled through the column.</p>

<p>"Forward!"</p>

<p>The Seventh moved with a kind of elastic stretching; and the
white-topped wagon trains made a sinuous half-mile trail behind.
The ground sloped upgrade toward the little ridge west of the
fort and one by one the companies came to the summit, tipped over
and had a last backward look at Lincoln, lying under the
sun-brightened morning haze. Shafter swung in his saddle to catch
that picture, and Hines said:</p>

<p>"Long time before we see it again."</p>

<p>They moved down the ridge into a rolling, broken
land&mdash;headed toward the Heart River, the Bad Lands, the
Powder and the Tongue and the Yellowstone and the
Rosebud&mdash;to all that crisscross of strange names and
colorful and mysterious names&mdash;to the mysterious depth of a
land almost unknown to them. In that direction somewhere lay the
Sioux. The band had ceased to play and the column tilted over the
ridge in thoughtful silence. With the general rode his adjutant,
his orderly and Charley Reynolds. With him too rode Marc Kellogg,
representing the New York Tribune, one of those newspapermen
whom Sherman had warned Custer not to take along.</p>

<p>From her place at the side of the commissary sergeant's house,
Josephine Russell watched the regiment move up to the summit of
the ridge and fall away. At that moment the sun brightened the
haze and she noticed that a shadow was thrown upward by the
column.</p>

<p>The shadow strengthened into a mirage, so that she dearly saw
the regiment marching through the sky and slowly fading in the
sky.</p>

<p>She thought for a moment it was an illusion of her own; but
then she heard people around her speak of it, half in excitement,
half in wonder. One man near by shook his head and turned his
eyes from it. "That's a sign. I'm damned glad I'm not along."</p>

<p>She swung back to the ferry, walking with her head lowered;
she got to her horse and stepped to the saddle. "It might have
been better," she thought. "But Edward came between us again. I
expected too much. Now there's nothing left to expect." She
thought she heard the far-off sound of the regimental band
playing "Garryowen," and listened until she was certain it was
only her imagination.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; WESTWARD MARCH</h2>

<p class="first">THAT afternoon, the column marched thirteen
miles and camped in a grassy bottom beside the Heart River. Water
and wood details went immediately away and men took up clubs to
clear the area of rattlesnakes. The horses were placed on picket
down the middle of each street and the guards were pacing their
rounds by the time the cook fires began to stain the shadows.
Another detail went out to slaughter the beef issue from the herd
of cattle driven with the column. At headquarters tent, Terry and
Custer sat in close conference while pay call blew and the
regiment filed by the paymaster.</p>

<p>Shafter said: "You going to walk down to the corner saloon
now, Hines?"</p>

<p>"It is Terry's doin'," said Hines. "If the boys had gotten
their pay last night in the fort we'd have a column of drunks
this mornin'. Now it will keep till we get home."</p>

<p>Reveille blew at four on the following morning and the general
sounded at five. By six the column was under way, a mile-long
line sinuously following the contours of the land, with flankers
to left and right and advance points far ahead, with the Ree
scouts fading into the distance and creeping back as quietly in
the late day. Rains came down in tempestuous squalls and they
crossed the Sweetbriar in a slashing hail storm and crawled
through bottom-land with the wagons hub-deep and double-teamed.
Despatch riders arrived from Lincoln with the latest mail and
later rode back. On the twenty-first they crossed the Big Muddy
and moved through sharp showers and slept wet at night and rose
sullen. The little creeks they came upon were bank-full from the
steady downfall; the quick-bred mosquitoes swarmed thickly around
them, driving the livestock frantic. Alkali patches began to
appear and on the left forward horizon the Bad Lands showed as
fairyland spires and grotesque, vari-colored minarets; at night
burning lignite beds sent up their dull red columns, like signals
of warning. They crossed the crooked loops of Davis Creek ten
times in one day's march, moved through huge cottonwood groves
and put the Little Missouri behind them. That day Terry sent
Custer forward on scout but found no sign of Indians.</p>

<p>It rained again and grew cold and snow fell three inches deep.
Wet buffalo chips smoldered without burning and horses grew
hungry for want of good grass. Scouts came out of the broken land
from Major Moore's detachment&mdash;who had been sent forward to
establish a supply base&mdash;to report he had reached Stanley's
Stockade and that the <i>Far West</i> waited there with supplies.
The same despatches brought news from Gibbon to the effect that
his Montana column was in motion down the Yellowstone. Terry sent
back orders for Gibbon to halt and wait, and for the <i>Far
West</i> to deliver one boat-load of supplies to the mouth of the
Powder.</p>

<p>They followed the Beaver into rising, broken country, the
column weaving around and about gullies and low masses of rusty
sandstone. They forded Cabin Creek and traversed a barren country
glittering with mica. Beyond O'Fallon's Creek they crossed a
divide into the basin of the Powder and from the heights, in a
short interval of sunlight, they saw far away the rugged,
contorted bluffs of the Yellowstone. Thoroughly weary, and wet
again from the intermittent rain, they camped on the Powder,
which was at this point two hundred feet wide and two feet
deep.</p>

<p>It was June 8, with the patient and thorough Terry growing
unaccountably restless. Next morning he took Moylan's and Keogh's
troops and rode down the Powder to the Yellowstone where the
<i>Far West</i> waited and where also Major Brisbin of Gibbon's
column waited. Terry left the two cavalry troops and proceeded up
the river on the <i>Far West</i> to the Tongue where he had a
conference with Gibbon. Then he came back on the boat to the
Powder and returned with his two escort troops to the camp of the
Seventh. That night Hines, having talked with the sergeant major,
passed on the news.</p>

<p>"The base of supply will be at mouth of the Powder. The <i>Far
West</i> will move Major Moore and the supplies to there from
Stanley's Stockade. Meanwhile Gibbon's been ordered to go back up
the Yellowstone to the Rosebud and wait until we march to him.
The country over that way is full of Indians. Gibbon's outfit has
been fightin' 'em in small details all the way along."</p>

<p>Now it was a game of hide and seek, with all the
responsibility of making contact falling upon Terry's shoulders.
Before him lay a rough area of land about one hundred miles
square, bounded on the north by the Yellowstone, on the south by
the fore edge of the Bighorns, on the west by the Bighorn and on
the east&mdash;where he stood poised with the Seventh&mdash;by
the Powder. In that area lay the main bodies of the Sioux, their
tracks plain to his scouts, their smaller bands weaving rapidly
from place to place as bait to confuse him and draw him off
scent. Now, patiently, he set about a thorough scouting job to
establish the whereabouts of the enemy's weight. Crook, somewhere
around the Bighorns, acted as a fence on the south and Gibbon,
camped at the mouth of the Rosebud, would bar the Sioux from
westward retreat.</p>

<p>"The trouble is," said McDermott, "we're too slow and we're
too few to make a good fence. If Crazy Horse or Gall or Two Moons
or Red Cloud want to break out of this country, they can circle
and be a hundred miles away before we get turned around. Now
here's Terry tryin' to find where to hit. Meanwhile the Sioux
scouts know where we are. We can be seen forty miles away. We
ain't goin' to strike the Sioux by surprise."</p>

<p>"That," said Hines, "is what Terry's got Custer for. We'll
just march here and there across the country until Terry's got it
figured where they are. Then one night we'll set out under Custer
and we'll go fast. We'll make a big jump and catch 'em before
they see us."</p>

<p>On the tenth of June, Terry despatched Reno with six companies
of cavalry and one Gatling gun to explore the upper part of the
Powder. "You will go as far as the junction of the Little
Powder," he told Reno. "Then go due west to the headwaters of the
Mizpah Creek, cross and continue to the Pumpkin, and go down the
Pumpkin to the Tongue. Then proceed down the Tongue to the
Yellowstone where you will meet me. You will throw out smaller
parties as you march, exploring the intervening ground. I wish it
thoroughly scouted, although I feel certain the hostiles are not
in body this far east. I think we shall find them beyond the
Tongue. Do not, however, go beyond the Tongue."</p>

<p>Thus he intended thoroughly to convince himself of the
emptiness of this smaller area before pushing ahead to where he
believed the action lay. Reno left early in the afternoon with
his wing, A Company included, and struck directly up the Powder.
Faithful to his orders, he turned west at the Little Powder,
touched the headwaters of the Mizpah and moved on to Pumpkin
Creek. He had his feelers out all the way in the form of the Ree
scouts led by Bloody Hand; and each night they brought back the
story of renewed trails sweeping up from the southeast and going
on toward the northwest, on beyond the Tongue toward the Rosebud,
toward the Bighorn. Bloody Hand, to indicate the size of that
far-away gathering, reached down and cupped the clodded earth in
his hands and let it spill out. "That many," he said.</p>

<p>Reno had long service as an officer and a creditable Civil War
record; but now when he reached the Tongue he faced the problem
of an independent commander operating beyond the reach of his
superior officer. He had his strict orders not to go beyond the
Tongue, but his scouts all were in accord as to the presence of
Sioux over that way; and he judged his mission to be that of
finding definite clues. Therefore, wrestling with the problem, he
broke the bonds of his order and crossed the Tongue to the
Rosebud, feeling right and left constantly, and on the nineteeth
he stopped near the Yellowstone and sent a despatch to Terry of
his whereabouts and what he had discovered.</p>

<p>Terry meanwhile had been moving westward along the Yellowstone
with the rest of the Seventh, keeping in contact with the Montana
column and with Moore by courier; and now slowly, as news drifted
in, he began to tie the ends of his expedition together. Gibbon
he held at the Rosebud. At the Tongue he met Reno's returning
psirty and the three men, Terry and Custer and Reno, lield a
conference. Terry listened to Reno's report and explanation of
his going beyond his orders without comment, being a mild and
reserved officer. All he said was: "It is as I believed. The
Sioux are beyond. On the Rosebud and westward in the direction of
the Bighorn. General&mdash;" indicating Custer&mdash;"you will
move the Seventh on to the mouth of the Rosebud and join Gibbon.
I shall take the <i>Far West</i> up there."</p>

<p>Custer and Reno left the general, Custer walking with a heavy
irritable silence that Reno immediately noticed; and for his part
he had his dislike of Custer and now revealed it with a sour,
caustic question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I seem to gather from your manner that you disapprove of my
stretching my instructions."</p>

<p>"When Terry gave you those orders," said Custer, "he already
knew there was a concentration west of the Tongue. Therefore your
march in that direction was a waste of six days' time."</p>

<p>"I judged the orders on their intent," said Reno stiffly. "I
think I have an average intelligence."</p>

<p>"I do not question it," snapped Custer and walked away. He was
in a bad frame of mind, his nervous energy goading him to an
impetuous action he could not embrace because of Terry's
restraining hand.</p>

<p>On June 20, the <i>Far West</i> landed Terry at the mouth of
the Rosebud where Gibbon and his column waited. That same
afternoon the Seventh arrived and a general meeting was held
aboard the boat&mdash;Terry, Custer, Gibbon and Gibbon's second
in command, Brisbin. Terry laid his big campaign map on the table
and made his estimate of the situation.</p>

<p>"The Sioux are southwest of us, somewhere between the Rosebud
and the Bighorn. General Gibbon's column will ascend the Bighorn.
It will swing when it reaches the Little Bighorn and follow that
stream. You will leave in the morning, Custer, with your
regiment, and go up the Rosebud. The intent of this maneuver is
that the two columns will act as an anvil and sledge, with the
Sioux between. We shall require a close consideration of the
time. General Gibbon, at what time can you be at the mouth of the
Little Bighorn?"</p>

<p>Gibbon took a long look at the map and made his calculations;
at this stage of the game the element of time and distance grew
vital and therefore he arrived at his estimation with a great
deal of care. "I shall," he said, "be at the Little Bighorn on
the morning of the twenty-sixth."</p>

<p>"That is for your information, Custer," said Terry. "Your
marches should be based upon Gibbon's arrival at that creek at
the agreed time. Now," he went on, still speaking to Custer, "as
you proceed up the Rosebud, you will explore right and left. When
you reach Tullock's Creek you will send a man down that creek to
meet Gibbon's scouts and thereby transmit such information as you
have acquired to him. This country will no doubt be full of
hostiles. Therefore you need a good scout to make it."</p>

<p>"Let me give him Herendeen," said Gibbon. "I'll talk to
Herendeen."</p>

<p>Custer nodded absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>"At the upper reaches of the Rosebud," Terry said, "you will
scout toward the Little Bighorn. But I wish you to constantly
feel toward your left. I do not wish to hamper you with
unnecessary orders, but you should adjust your marches so as to
give Gibbon time to come along. On the morning of the
twenty-sixth, therefore, you should be in some position southeast of the
Sioux while Gibbon is somewhere northwest of them, the two of you
closing in on either side. Do not rush the thing. Do not permit
yourself to engage before Gibbon is up for support. Now, how are
your supplies and how do you feel about your men? Do you need
something added to the Seventh? Gibbon could give you Brisbin's
battalion of cavalry."</p>

<p>Custer sat in glum thought, staring at the floor. "No," he
said, "I'll need nothing more than I have. The Seventh is wholly
able to take care of what it meets. The addition of outside
cavalry would only interfere with our freedom of movement."</p>

<p>Terry considered him a thoughtful moment, knowing his man; and
Gibbon and Brisbin studied him. Irritableness worked in Custer;
an uncharacteristic gloom showed on him, as though the winter's
injuries and humiliations, never healed, now freshly hurt
him.</p>

<p>"Gibbon," said Terry, "give Custer part of your Crow scouts.
Give him Bouyer and Girard. They know this country better than
Reynolds. They can assist Reynolds." He stroked his smooth chin
and had a commander's natural grave wondering; for he had made
his explorations, formed his judgments and had arranged his
maneuvers. Now the job was in the hands of his field officers. He
sat still, checking all these things seriously in his mind.
"Crook should be somewhere near us, and it would be a relief to
have him in support. But I have heard nothing from him and have
no idea at all where he is. Nor can I wait longer, for fear the
Sioux will slip through us. You have a slightly farther distance
to go. Gibbon, therefore put your troops in motion today for the
B ghorn. Custer will leave first thing in the morning. That is
all. I shall go with Gibbon's column and&mdash;" turning to
Custer&mdash;"if all goes well, I shall meet you on the
twenty-sixth."</p>

<p>Custer rose, saying, "I'll pass on the orders," and left the
tent. Gibbon, Terry and Brisbin all watched him depart, their
glances following his long shape, as it moved with impatient
treading toward his own headquarters tent.</p>

<p>Officers' call ran through the Seventh, summoning them to
Custer who sat in his portable easy chair, a lank figure in
buckskin, with a scarlet flowing kerchief and a head of hair
grown ragged. The sun had scorched his face scarlet, making his
eyes a deeper blue. He sat still before his officers, with none
of the electric energy showing in his talk or his muscles. He
seemed to their sharp eyes unusually depressed.</p>

<p>"Gibbon marches up the Bighorn while we march up the Powder.
We shall leave in the morning, light marching order. The wagon
train stays. Each troop is assigned twelve mules which are to
carry hardtack, coffee and sugar for fifteen days, bacon for
twelve days. Use your strongest mule in each troop for extra
ammunition, two thousand rounds per troop. You'll have to load
extra forage on the mules also. Each trooper will carry one
hundred rounds of carbine ammunition and eighteen rounds of
revolver. And twelve pounds of oats."</p>

<p>The twenty-eight officers stood gravely before him, stained
with a month's hard marching, their buckskins caked with old mud,
their blue trousers faded out, their mustaches unkempt. They were
a hard crew to look upon in the falling twilight; and they were
silent long after he had fallen silent, until at last he said in
his always touchy voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are there any suggestions, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>It was Moylan who spoke. "That's not enough mules. General.
You'll break them down with the load you propose."</p>

<p>"Wagons are out of the question. Additional mules will slow us
too greatly."</p>

<p>French of M Company had a word. "Once your mules start to lag
you'll slow down anyhow."</p>

<p>Custer slapped the arms of his portable chair with a gesture
of open temper; his voice carried its rasp of anger. "Well,
gentlemen, carry what you please, but remember you are
responsible for your companies. The present arrangement of wings
is abolished. Each commander reports directly to me. The extra
forage was only a suggestion, but bear in mind we will follow the
trail for fifteen days unless we catch them before that
time."</p>

<p>Captain McDougall said: "Are we to push on at will? I thought
I understood you to say we were operating in conjunction with
General Gibbon."</p>

<p>Custer was now moving back and forth along the ground, nervous
and wholly out of patience with his officers. "We shall follow
the Sioux, no matter how long it takes. We may not see the
steamer again." He swung on his adjutant. "Cooke, make out the
orders so troop commanders may have them tonight. Assign a
sergeant and six privates from each company to take charge of the
pack train. McDougall, your troop will guard the pack train.
There is at present an unequal distribution of officers among the
companies. I shall make temporary reassignments in order that
each troop may be properly officered. That's all."</p>

<p>He meant it to be all, but the officers lingered, not wholly
satisfied. McDougall said: "I don't think a few extra mules would
be unwise. General."</p>

<p>Custer wheeled, his voice turned shrewish and sardonic:
"Twelve mules to a company. Take what you wish on them. Take
nothing if you are prepared to starve your troop. For that matter
you'd better take salt along. You may have to live on horsemeat
before we're finished with this." Having said it, he whirled into
his tent.</p>

<p>The officers turned and moved backward toward their companies
in small groups. Godfrey moved beside Edgerly and quietly spoke
his mind. "I have never seen him like that before."</p>

<p>"You must remember," said Edgerly, "he is smarting under the
rebuke he received from the President. He is a very proud
man."</p>

<p>Godfrey shook his head. "The smell of powder is usually a
tonic to him&mdash;and the smell of powder is thick around here
tonight. He is singularly depressed. In fact he has depressed
me."</p>

<p>Darkness came and mess fires bloomed along the Yellowstone's
bluff. Details moved back to the supply train to break out the
extra rations and ammunition to be loaded on mule-back on the
morrow; and off to one corner of the camp, the Indian scouts were
in full voice with their own strange ceremony&mdash;the echoes of
it sharp and mournful in this wild empty corner of the earth. In
his tent, Lieutenant Smith was at the moment writing this letter
to his wife:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">We leave in the morning on what seems
to be the final part of the campaign. It will soon be over and
then I shall look forward to the return&mdash;to leave this fall.
I know how you feel when I am away. I have often thought of the
hardness of it on you and I wish often that I were a more
demonstrative man so that I could tell you how the sight of you
and the nearness of you sometimes affects me. We are a sober lot
tonight. The general is in an edgy frame of mind and there's not
the usual racket along the company street. But that is as it
always is before action. Be cheerful. There is no great prospect
of danger here...</p>

<p><br>
LIEUTENANT PORTER stepped into Lieutenant Van Reilly's tent
and found Harrington there; and stood by while these two made
mutual wills. "My effects to you." said Harrington, "if I die and
you survive. If you die and I survive, I shall take your things
to your wife."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Van Reilly. "Now in case we're both killed,
let's have Porter do that chore."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Porter. "And either of you is to look after my
possessions and return them to my wife in case of my death. Is
there a drink of hard liquor in this tent?"</p>

<p>Van Reilly found a bottle and measured it by candlelight. "One
drink for tonight. One for tomorrow night. After that we shall
not need it, being uplifted by victory, I sincerely trust."</p>

<p>In his tent, Custer was at the moment composing his nightly
letter to Libby; and all along the regiment men made their casual
disposition of their effects, or wrote final thoughtful messages
home, or lay back and were silent, or played poker by
candlelight, or walked abroad in the camp darkness. On the <i>Far
West</i> a game of polcer had started with Grant Marsh, Keogh,
Tom Custer, Calhoun and Garnett playing; and on the bluff of the
river Shafter stood alone, watching the steamboat's lights make
their yellowed, wrinkled lanes across the water. The river was a
steady washing tone in the night, and wind came down from the
north, and somewhere southward a low moon shed a partial glow
through the fog. The Crows and the Ree were steadily chanting out
their strangely barbaric tune of farewell and warning&mdash;that
beating rhythm a pulse of premonition all through the camp. One
by one the lights of the regiment died and tattoo sounded softly.
Shafter watched the black shadows thicken in the Yellowstone's
canyon, and he looked backward and saw his life as an empty thing
and found no clear answer for his future. His life marched to
this point, void of hope or ambition, without sweet memories or
faith&mdash;and tomorrow held nothing that made him anxious to be
traveling toward it.</p>

<p>So the regiment settled down to sleep on the eve of its march.
On that same night and at that same hour, one hundred miles
southward. Crook's command lay with double guards around it and
licked the wounds of a sharp defeat inflicted by Crazy Horse four
days earlier. For the second time in five months Crook grew
cautious and doubtful and now sent despatches back to
Laramie&mdash;to be wired to Sheridan at Chicago&mdash;that he
would not advance without additional reenforcements. Of all this
Terry knew nothing as he sat awake on the <i>Far West</i> and
reviewed his plans.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; CUSTER PULLS
AWAY</h2>

<p class="first">A DAMP mist hung heavily over the water and the
canyon, through which the cursing of the mule packers came in
muffled explosions. The peremptory notes of assembly laid a rough
hand upon the troopers, and the companies formed one by one on
the rolling bench above the river. Custer swung to his horse and
crossed the camp at a full gallop to join Terry, Gibbon and
Brisbin who tarried behind their own column in order to see the
Seventh away. Custer rounded in beside the three, his horse
fiddling briskly. Down the bench rose Reno's shout of command,
which placed the regiment in forward motion. There was no music
to lead them on this parade; the band had been left at the Powder
River base.</p>

<p>They came past the reviewing group, Reno saluting as he went
by, each company commander swinging his head to the right and
rendering a like salute. They moved on, company by company,
stained by weather and a month's hard marching&mdash;dark and
toughened and competent men made surly by early morning. There
was none of a dress parade's flash or fancy display about them
this day. Their clothes were ragged and their whiskers long, and
they carried with them the bulky impedimenta of a field
campaign&mdash;bedding roll lashed behind saddle cantle,
haversacks, lariat and picket pins, nose bags and extra pouch of
oats, carbine and revolver, extra bandoliers of ammunition,
trenching tools, canteen&mdash;all these things attached to
various quarters of man or horse, all slapping and clattering and
shifting to the motion of the mount.</p>

<p>Terry watched them pass with a thoughtful eye. For the troops
he had nothing but commendation. "You have a good regiment,
Custer. I do not know of a better one in the service."</p>

<p>Custer showed a flash of his old spirit. He smiled, the
constriction of it half closing his eyes and brightening them
into audacity. "My regiment. General, has been the best in the
army for ten years."</p>

<p>Terry smiled. Gibbon said nothing. Brisbin, a member of the
Third Cavalry and a truculent man, gave Custer a sharply
irritated glance and returned his eyes to the Seventh. It had
always been a flashy regiment, more troublesome and more
picturesque than any other, with ten years of campaigning to its
credit, with its roll of honorable dead, with its actions and
skirmishes and engagements a worthy list on its record. Its
companies, never at full strength, had been further pulled down
by details left at the Powder River base so that its eight
hundred had diminished to seven hundred. But it had a strong core
of old-time noncommissioned men and its captains were largely
good, some seasoned and faithful like Moylan, some wild-tempered
like Keogh, some stubborn and cool as was the white-haired
Benteen who never forgot a hatred or a liking.</p>

<p>The companies were under-officered and Custer had made some
changes of assignment. Moylan still had A Company, B was
McDougall, C had been given to Tom Custer while Weir kept D.
Algernon Smith had been taken from A to command E Company. F was
Yates and G was led by Donald Mcintosh, the officer with Indian
blood. Benteen had H and I was commanded by Keogh and Godfrey led
K. Custer's brother-in-law, Calhoun, rode in front of L. French
retained M. There was also some shuffling of other officers to
insure for each troop better leadership.</p>

<p>"The heart of a regiment," said Terry, "is faith in itself. I
have every confidence in the Seventh."</p>

<p>The column went by. Sun began to break through the fog and the
day promised to be fair and warm. Terry, laboring under natural
weight of spirit, saw the sun as an omen and slightly nodded to
himself, and then fixed a sharp blue eye on the pack train of 160
mules now passing under the escort of six troopers from each
company, followed by McDougall's company as guard. The mules were
improperly loaded and made a ragged, recalcitrant column. The
general scowled at the sight of it.</p>

<p>"That's a poor shift for a supply train," he said with some
degree of sharpness. "You're going to have trouble with it."</p>

<p>Custer flushed in embarrassed irritation and bit his lips. He
looked straight before him. "We'll get it shaken down before the
day's over."</p>

<p>"Better have been gotten in shape before you started," stated
Terry. "Everything depends on the timetable we have set. Let
nothing disturb that, even if you have to cut your worst mules
out and let them go."</p>

<p>The last file passed and the better part of a half hour had
gone by. Terry lifted a folded paper from his pocket and handed
it to Custer. "This is the written statement of the instructions
I gave you yesterday. I have left them purposely indefinite in
certain things. I have too much faith in your judgment as a
commander to impose fixed orders upon you."</p>

<p>Custer accepted the paper, gave it a careless glance and
thrust it into his pocket. He was impatient to be away and his
body communicated that feeling to the horse beneath him. It
fiddled and danced in the spongy earth, carrying him around until
he faced Terry.</p>

<p>Terry said: "I shall be with Gibbon and we shall be on the
Little Bighorn the morning of the twenty-sixth. Be sure, when you
reach the head of Tullock's Creek, to send Herendeen back along
it to communicate with Gibbon. That will be a verification of
your whereabouts. One last thing. I expect both columns to work
in close conjunction. We cannot beat the Indians in detail, or
surround them in detail. This movement depends entirely upon both
columns striking at the same approximate time. Be sure to have
your scouts always well ahead to establish contact with Gibbon at
the first opportunity. I wish you luck."</p>

<p>Custer grasped Terry's hand and shook it with his swift
impulsiveness, briefly accepted the hands of Gibbon and Brisbin,
and whirled around. Just before he broke his horse into a gallop,
Brisbin called after him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now Custer, don't be greedy. Wait for us."</p>

<p>Custer looked back, flushed and smiling. He flung up his hand,
his horse springing up beneath him, and so making a figure of
dash and gallantry in the day's growing sunlight. "I won't," he
said. With that enigmatic answer he let his horse go, and rushed
away toward the column's head.</p>

<p>A mile from the Yellowstone, Custer halted the command for a
brief rest and divided the Indian scouts into two sections to
cover each side of the Rosebud; after that he stood at the head
of his horse and looked awhile into the haze slowly developing
southward. Cooke was with him, waiting for anything the general
might have to say, but Custer made no comment. Wrapped in an
unusual kind of taciturnity, Custer presently mounted and swung
up his hand for the forward march; and led the column over the
Rosebud to the west bank.</p>

<p>From his saddle, Shafter watched the broken country unroll
before him. The Rosebud lay at the bottom of a shallow canyon and
the column, now without the impediment of wagons, took the most
practicable course&mdash;sometimes following the edge of the
water, sometimes traveling on a narrow benchland half up the side
of the canyon, and sometimes rising to the top of the bluff. All
this was a powder-gray, fine-grained land with grass and sage
tufting it; all of it was a land scorched by summer's heat and
scarified by severe winters. Now and then the command passed
through willow growths. Otherwise there was no break in the rough
rolling of the country.</p>

<p>A Company had a new officer. Smith had been put in command of
E and Varnum was in charge of the scout detail; therefore Custer
had assigned Garnett to A, and Garnett now rode at the foot of
the troop. Shafter felt him as he would have felt a cold wind at
the back of his neck; and all his thoughts of Garnett were cold
and full of hate, shaking him out of his solemn, indifferent
frame of mind.</p>

<p>Hines said: "Reminds me of the country around the Washita.
It's gettin' hot. I never knew it to be any other way when the
outfit went into a fight. Cold as hell or hot enough to give a
man a stroke. Soldierin' is a funny hfe."</p>

<p>They bivouacked at noon, ate and lay idle in the warming
drowse. The regiment now was definitely pointed into action,
hourly penetrating deeper into the heart of Sioux country, and
therefore men were more silent than usual, more withdrawn to
their own thoughts&mdash;and more watchful. In the afternoon the
regiment moved on, still following the Rosebud as it angled to
fhe southwest; scouts returned with their news and sometimes this
news came down the line, as overheard by some officer or enlisted
man. Once Moylan spurred ahead, spoke to the adjutant and dropped
back.</p>

<p>"Plenty of tracks ahead of us. The Sioux seem headed toward a
general meeting on our forward right."</p>

<p>"Soldiering," repeated Hines, "is a funny life. I knew I'd get
sore bones out of this, but I wanted to come. Ten years from now
I'll smoke a pipe and tell some youngster how Grandpaw fought the
Sioux&mdash;and I'll lie like hell. It will seem wonderful to me,
lookin' back at it. But right now my bones are sore."</p>

<p>"It ain't your bones," said Bierss.</p>

<p>Hines retorted: "My bottom's a damned sight tougher than
yours, Cawpril. It has scrubbed leather a lot of years
longer."</p>

<p>"You ain't had the fun I've had," said Bierss. "You never got
run out of as many bedrooms. Ah, Sarge, you're a serious man.
When you're dead you'll regret that."</p>

<p>"In heaven," said McDermott, "I wonder if a man could get
chevrons put on his wings."</p>

<p>"If it takes as long to get a promotion in heaven as in this
army," said Bierss, "you'll be fifty years a rookie."</p>

<p>"A good man's a good man, heaven or here," said McDermott
virtuously. "Gabriel will have me runnin' a platoon inside of a
week."</p>

<p>"All I want out of heaven," said Bierss, "is a bed and three
meals and no work. And a woman who won't cry when I leave
her."</p>

<p>"You'll be lookin' for a second-story window to jump through,"
said McDermott.</p>

<p>"No windows in heaven, you fool," put in Hines. "It is a city
of glass. Everybody sees everybody. No dark corners and no
walls."</p>

<p>"Good God," said Bierss, "can't a man have privacy anywhere?"
He grinned at Shafter. "Professor, you've read books. What's
heaven like?"</p>

<p>"A tunnel," said Shafter. "No light and no sound. You'll never
know when you walk into it and you'll never reach the other end.
In fact, Bierss, you'll never know you're there."</p>

<p>Bierss rummaged that conception through his mind for a quarter
mile and made no headway. "I don't see that at all. It sounds
like bein' buried underground forever."</p>

<p>"Who knows?" murmured Shafter.</p>

<p>"Professor," stated Bierss, "if that is what a book does for a
man, then books are damned dangerous and I'm glad I never read
one."</p>

<p>The column camped short of twilight, still on the Rosebud; and
fires twinkled along the earth and guards threw a vigilant ring
around camp. The Crow and the Rees slid mysteriously away and
from afar presently came softly the repeated hoot of an owl, to
be elsewhere echoed. An orderly summoned the officers to Custer's
fire. He stood at the blaze with his officers ringed around it,
and firelight played upon him somberly and brightly danced in
their eyes. Cooke, the giant adjutant, stood near Custer, as did
the mild and self-effacing Charley Reynolds.</p>

<p>"From now on," said Custer, "there will be no more bugle
calls. Stable guards will waken the troops at 3 A.M. March will
be resumed at five. I shall regulate the making and breaking of
camp. Otherwise each commander is responsible for the actions of
his company. You will observe proper interval between companies.
Do not get ahead of the scouts and do not let the column stretch
out. We must remain compact."</p>

<p>He spoke in a suppressed manner; he seemed jaded, he seemed
half indifferent, half uncertain. None of the brusque and
intolerant stridency so characteristic of him showed this night;
and after his initial announcement he stared long in the fire and
presently pulled himself out of a kind of reverie.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I have complete faith in this regiment and I have
entire confidence in your loyalty and your entire support. I call
on you particularly now to give me the best of your judgment and
all of your talents."</p>

<p>He pushed his hands into his pockets and broke off, hard
engaged in thought, his bony face tipped down, his thin long lips
half hidden behind his mustache, his face in a shadowed,
disillusioned repose. The ring of officers waited for him to
continue, closely watching, carefully listening to this new tone,
this somber reflection so unlike him. Silence weighted the
circle. Benteen looked upon his commander with his ruddy,
dogmatic face holding a steadfast reserve, an ingrained dislike;
and Reno studied the man out of his dark-ringed eyes.</p>

<p>"We can," continued Custer, "expect to meet a thousand
warriors or more. The trails are growing heavy, pointing ahead of
us and west of us. It may be more than a thousand. It might be
fifteen hundred. We came here to find Indians and we shall find
them. We shall find them if I have to march this regiment all the
way down to Nebraska or back to the Agencies. Let there be no
misunderstanding as to our purpose. I have too much pride in the
Seventh to go back empty-handed and I know you feel the same way.
I ought to mention that General Terry offered me Brisbin's
battalion of cavalry. I refused it. Frankly, I felt that there
might be jealousy between the two groups and I wanted nothing to
break the present knit spirit of our command." Then he paused and
took on a moment's show of his old spirit. "Moreover, I am
confident the Seventh can handle whatever it faces. If the
hostiles can whip the Seventh, they can whip any reenforcements
we might have. That is all I have to say tonight, except you
should be prepared for marches of between twenty-five and thirty
miles a day."</p>

<p>The group slowly dissolved, walking in twos and threes back
through the shadows toward the vague line of the troops lying
like windrows along the earth. Godfrey and Mcintosh and Wallace
moved together toward the far end of camp, none of them speaking
for a long spell. It was Wallace who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"You know, I think Custer is going to be killed."</p>

<p>"Why, what makes you believe that?" asked Godfrey.</p>

<p>"I have never seen him so disheartened before," said Wallace.
"There is a shadow distinctly over him."</p>

<p>Mcintosh made a troubled remark. "The general speaks of going
as far as Nebraska if he must. I had the impression that Terry
had definitely restricted us to a fifteen-day sortie."</p>

<p>"You know the general," said Godfrey, whereupon the three
broke off, each going his own direction. Godfrey's troop was well
along the camp and presently he passed a fire, around which he
saw the interpreter Mitch Bouyer and three Crows squatting.
Godfrey stopped and likewise squatted. One of the Indians looked
at him and then spoke in Crow to Bouyer, who turned to
Godfrey.</p>

<p>"Half Yellow Face wants to know if you've ever fought Sioux
before."</p>

<p>"Tell him I have," said Godfrey.</p>

<p>Bouyer passed it back to Half Yellow Face. The Indian asked
another question which Bouyer relayed. "How many do you expect to
find this time?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ten or fifteen hundred," said Godfrey. "What does he
think?"</p>

<p>"He wants to know if you think you can whip that many?"</p>

<p>"I guess so."</p>

<p>Bouyer spoke for himself. "Well, I can tell you we're going to
have a damned big fight and I ain't so sure. Neither are the
Crows."</p>

<p>"How big a fight&mdash;how soon?" asked Godfrey.</p>

<p>"Soon," said Bouyer. "Don't expect the Sioux to retreat any
more. They got their families with them. A big fight. All the
fight you'll ever want."</p>

<p>The regiment was up at three and again in motion at five, with
the troopers silent and stale. Within two miles they crossed the
looping Rosebud three times and stopped once for watering. The
day grew hot and the sun began to bite down for the first time
during the long campaign and the porous earth changed from slick
mud to dust by noon. The scouts, now working constantly ahead,
reported back the mark of sign not over two days old. The long
day wheeled on and the scanty foraging of the horses began to
tell upon them; after thirty-three miles the regiment went into
camp, ate and fell asleep. Once again at three it rose and at
five was again marching.</p>

<p>Shafter said to Hines: "'What's the date?"</p>

<p>Hines couldn't remember it and had to draw his roster book
from his shirt pocket. '"Twenty-fourth, but what's a day to
you?"</p>

<p>"Birthday."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bierss, "tonight we'll bake a cake."</p>

<p>Captain Moylan, riding at his usual place beside Shafter,
turned and said: "Good luck."</p>

<p>"Any kind of luck is all right."</p>

<p>The Crows sent back word of fresh sign and presently the
column began to pass the round dead-grass spots where lodges had
stood and the blackened char of old campfires. At noon the
command halted for dinner&mdash;bacon and hardtack and
coffee&mdash;and was hurried into the saddle by Custer. But after
a brief forward march, he stopped the regiment at one o'clock.
The Crows, vigilantly rummaging the distance, had sent back word
of a camp freshly deserted at the forks of the Rosebud. Custer
swung forward with two troops to investigate while the regiment
rested. He was back in the middle of the afternoon and now began
to throw his scouts in widening circles all around him. Seated
cross-legged against the earth, Shafter knew that the trail had
grown suddenly hot from the way the scouts ran in and out.</p>

<p>At five, Custer swung the command forward and now the trail
passed into a valley whose short brown grass grew smooth and
slick from a dry, stiff wind ruffling over it. The tracks of
lodgepole travois scratched the ground everywhere and they came
upon the skeleton frames of wickiups where a camp had been, and a
sun-dance lodge. An officer left the column and moved to the
lodge and rode back presently with a scalp lifted in his hand.
Presently news came down the column:&mdash;</p>

<p>"White man's scalp hanging on that lodge. Cooke says it must
have been one of Gibbon's troopers killed on the Yellowstone last
month."</p>

<p>Custer seemed now to be pulled by the lively scent, for he
moved the column steadily on through the last sunlight and into
the blue-running dusk. The land tilted upward and the Rosebud
made a shallow semicircle toward the southwest, fringed with
willows. Beyond them, in the distance, lay a shallow knob.</p>

<p>Herendeen, who had been Gibbon's scout, now trotted up the
line and reached Custer and spoke to him. "General, we're as
close to the head of Tullock's Creek as we'll get. It's off
there&mdash;" pointing to the right. "This is where I'm supposed
to leave you and go down the creek to find Gibbon's scouts."</p>

<p>He waited for Custer's order on the subject and for whatever
message Custer intended to convey to Gibbon.</p>

<p>It was a night's ride down the creek, through the heart of
Sioux-held ground and a risky prospect for a lone man. Gibbon had
known this and had promised Herendeen extra pay for the venture.
So now Herendeen waited for Custer's order to go, and rode
silently beside the commander. Custer gave him a brief glance out
of his deep-set eyes, out of his bony, thought-hardened face; and
then Custer put his glance into the forward blue distance and
rode on without speaking. He had no answer for Herendeen and,
after a half mile of this kind of traveling, Herendeen saw he was
to be given no order. Being a man with a frontier touchiness, he
wheeled away and dropped back along the column until he had
reached his place. Apparently the general had changed his mind
about sending back a messenger; it was just as well to Herendeen,
who had no intention of risking his skin unless Custer definitely
requested it.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the command halted in sundown's last yellow
flare of light and made camp with a dry, hard wind rolling the
desert's smoke-fine dust at them. An orderly trotted through camp
in lieu of officers' call and presently all officers stood in
circle around Custer and Custer's headquarter's pennant. Benteen,
whose mind always had an acid realism, stared at the flag with
his unfavorable thought, at the two stars of a major general
stitched on the pennant's field. This was what Custer had once
been, in the Civil War, but no longer was; therefore in Benteen's
critical opinion the commander had no right to the use of the two
stars. It was a display of vanity that he held against Custer,
adding it to his list of Custer's many other faults.</p>

<p>They stood stiff and spraddle-legged and dusty in the forming
twilight, watching Custer's hawkish face swing around upon them;
and, since all of them were in his hands and all their futures
were at his disposal, they watched him closely, analyzing his
unpredictable temper. The sourness and the gloominess had given
way, but his buoyancy had not returned. He stood eager and
straining in the windy evening, anxiously bedeviled by the
nearness of the Indians, with all the consequent possibilities of
a spectacular sweep against them; he was gnawed by the thought
that he might miss them and lose that chance. All this was
evident in the staccato manner of his talk.</p>

<p>"We have come seventy-five miles from the mouth of the
Rosebud. I have sent Varnum forward with the scouts. We're no
more than thirty miles from the hostiles. I do not know yet
which way they're running but I propose to find out."</p>

<p>Benteen's dry voice interrupted. "Are you sure they're
running, General?"</p>

<p>Custer's voice had a special usage for Benteen; it was stiff
and formal and brief: "If they were not running, we should have
struck them before now."</p>

<p>"They know where we are," Benteen pointed out. "They know
we're coming. It is my idea they may be picking their own spot to
fight on."</p>

<p>"We'll see&mdash;we'll see," said Custer in his dismissing
tone. "I propose to make a sudden jump at them. Troop commanders
had better change your details on the pack train. May not get
another chance. Look to your equipment. I suggest you water again
tonight."</p>

<p>The pushing wind caught at the standard, whose end was plunged
in the sandy earth, and suddenly knocked it over. Godfrey bent
down and lifted it and jammed it into the ground again. It fell
again, whereupon Godfrey patiently repeated the operation. All
the officers watched this until Custer said: "Nothing more,
gentlemen," and then they turned back to their various company
streets, walking with a sprung-legged weariness. DeRudio said to
Godfrey: "That was a bad sign."</p>

<p>Shafter lay back on his blankets, head pillowed on the
McClellan saddle. Wind lifted the silt-fine sand from the ground
and threw it against his face; the smell of dust was constant in
his nostrils, and turned his throat dry. Night fell with its
desert suddenness and the stars were very bright against the
black bedding of the sky. Moylan had returned and spoke to Hines,
who in turn spoke to Sergeant Easley. "Get six men and go relieve
the troop's pack-train detail."</p>

<p>At nine o'clock, Lieutenant Varnum returned from his scout and
reported to Custer who sat cross-legged in the darkness. Varnum
crouched down to make his report.</p>

<p>"We went ten miles forward. Same kind of tracks as we've been
crossing. We saw what looked like signal fires during the
afternoon. They were off to the right."</p>

<p>Custer said: "The Crows tell me there's a high point on the
divide between the Rosebud and the Little Bighorn where they used
to go to steal Sioux horses. It is a lookout place called Crow
Peak. It commands a view of the Little Bighorn valley. I want a
responsible white man to go up there with the Crows tonight and
have a look from there first thing in the morning and send word
back to me. I'll be coming forward."</p>

<p>"I expect," said Varnum, "that means me."</p>

<p>"Take Reynolds and Bouyer with you, and whatever Indians you
please."</p>

<p>Varnum had been in the saddle for many hours straight and was
extremely weary. He got up and stamped his feet on the ground.
"Daylight will be about four or a little after."</p>

<p>"Send back word as soon as practicable. What do your Crows say
about the Sioux?"</p>

<p>"They guess a couple thousand. They counted the lodge marks at
the last camp we passed."</p>

<p>Custer said: "These Rees are dead afraid of a Sioux. One Sioux
is five to them. I doubt if the Crows have much more courage in
that respect."</p>

<p>"I'd argue that, General. They're strong fighters."</p>

<p>"Send back word as soon as possible," repeated Custer and thus
sent the dog-tired Varnum away. Cooke came up from the darkness
and looked down from his great height. "Anything more.
General?"</p>

<p>"No," said Custer. "Better roll in."</p>

<p>After Cooke had gone away, the general remained in his
cross-legged attitude, solemnly thoughtful. The Rosebud, shallow and
fickle, ran with a slight murmuring along the base of the low
bluff before him. Behind him lay the regiment, soon asleep. He
heard the sentries pacing, the occasional murmuring of their
voices and the click of their guns. The wind had somewhat
lessened but the scent of dust was strong, and the smell of
horses and mules blew through the camp. He sat very still, his
impulsive mind grasping the ends of his problem, and darting here
and there, and jumping far ahead to the eventual scene which he
knew he must make real&mdash;the scene of the Seventh smashing
the Sioux in surprise attack. There was never any doubt in his
mind as to the Seventh, never any doubt as to victory; the only
thing which had ever worried him was his ability to catch up with
the hostiles before they slipped from his grasp, before Terry's
time limit expired, before Gibbon came up to join him.</p>

<p>He had a fighter's heart, this Custer, and a fighter's
tremendous energy. He scorned the cautions which held other
commanders back, he had a blind faith in the naked power of the
sudden surprise rush and the naked power of a cavalry charge. On
dash and surprise and swiftness he had made himself a general out
of a boy lieutenant in four years and he could not change now.
Nor wanted to change. Impatience and restlessness and a
self-faith that never wavered were the stars that shone brightest
before him, and moved him and made him.</p>

<p>So he sat, jealous of the chance before him and wanting
neither Terry nor Gibbon to share it; and he thought of the
ordeal through which he had passed during the winter&mdash;the
humiliation put upon him by Grant, by Sherman, even by Sheridan,
and all this he hated until the hatred squeezed out of him
everything but the one dominating passion to strike and destroy
the Sioux camp, and so recover his prestige. He had been a
household name in his country, and still was; and once he whirled
down upon the Sioux and scattered them to the winds not even the
President would be able to stay the public applause or the public
clamor for his advancement.</p>

<p>To himself he was a candid man. He knew what he wanted, and
what he would do to get what he wanted&mdash;and never did he
attempt to conceal it from himself. He had no hypocrisy in him,
no political caution and none of that mellowness whereby a man
might smooth himself a pathway through other men. The egotism
which lies in the tissues of all men was thicker in him than in
others; the hunger for applause which is a thirst in all men was
a greater craving in him. The sense of drama which made quieter
men silently wish they had the stature and the daring to play
great parts was in George Armstrong Custer so vivid that it gave
him the stature and the daring. He created the color which other
men shrank from, even as they wanted it. He played his part
straight as would a great actor and beheved in himself and in his
part until the two were one; in him was none of that critical
self-reflection which caused others to draw short of appearing
ridiculous. He was a simple man so hungry for greatness that he
could ride roughshod over the personal feelings of other men and
not be aware of it; he was so naive in his judgments that even as
he knew his enemies, he treated them in the manner of one who
knows them to be entirely wrong and therefore to be treated
charitably, indulged. He could be harsh and brutal for the sake
of a soldierly ideal, but there was no gentle insight in him, no
compassion, no deep sympathy. As inspiring a commander as he knew
himself to be and as proud of his regiment as he was, he knew
nothing of that man-to-man affection which tied a command
together. One moment indulgent and the next instant full of fiery
intolerance, he lacked any semblance of balance and was so blind
to his own character that he needlessly broke army regulations
out of a sense of complete virtue, and yet would instantly
condemn and punish a subordinate officer for the slightest
breach. All these things he was&mdash;an elemental complex of
emotions and hungers and dreams never cooled, never disciplined,
never refined by maturity; for he had never grown up.</p>

<p>He lay back, somewhere during the night, on his blankets and
fell into that instant sleep for which he was famous. But the
last thing on his mind had been a fear of losing the Sioux and
the first thing to return to it when he woke near midnight was
that same fear. He lay quiet for half an hour, thinking of it;
and suddenly rose up and called to his orderly.</p>

<p>"Wake the company commanders and tell them to be ready to
march at one o'clock."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE ORDEAL
BEGINS</h2>

<p class="first">THE command struggled out of dead sleep and
stumbled through the curdled blackness; and horses pitched a
little and men cursed with bitter violence and sergeants' voices
prodded the weary-drunk companies into formation. There was no
talk as the Seventh moved forward. Horses sneezed and dust rose
thick around the command; now and then an orderly ran down the
column, and later ran back. They traveled with the Rosebud as it
circled and slowly moved upgrade, and the land all around was a
series of streaky black layers against which some heavier chunk
of land thrust a deeper blackness. At three o'clock, this
blackness began to move in muddy gray waves and at four light
came, one dark tone moving into a tone less dark until a pearl
dawn lay over the earth. A rippled order came back along the
column, through the dense dry dust.</p>

<p>"Fall out for breakfast."</p>

<p>Shafter unsaddled and searched for the makings of a fire.
Hines had dropped almost at once on his haunches and part of the
command curled up and fell asleep again, wanting rest more than
food. Shafter boiled his coffee and fried his bacon and put his
hardtack in the bacon grease to soften it. He saw Captain Moylan
standing near by and he beckoned him over and split his breakfast
with his commander. Moylan squatted in the dust, his eyes
bloodshot. The creek water had alkali in it, turning the coffee
bad. Hines came over and sat down, groanmg as he touched the
ground. "This is soldierin' for you, Shafter. Don't stay in it as
long as I'm stayin'. If I was thirty again&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shafter said: "I remember a night march from Chambers to Shaw
Gap, during the war. It was worse, Hines."</p>

<p>"Much worse," said Moylan and grinned at Shafter. "There was a
tougher commander along. He was in a hurry."</p>

<p>Hines looked at both of them and softly said: "So. Same
outfit, hey?"</p>

<p>Garnett walked forward and stopped by the fire. He looked down
at Moylan: "Any orders. Captain?"</p>

<p>"None that I know of," said Moylan. "Get off your feet,
Garnett. It is a long day coming and nobody knows what's at the
end of it."</p>

<p>Shafter looked up at Garnett and met the man's cool glance; he
gave back the same arrogant stare and saw the flush of temper in
Garnett's face. Presently the lieutenant moved away. Shafter
heard Hines murmur: "There comes somebody," and turned his
attention to the little hill ahead, down which a rider rode
rapidly, rounding in before the head of the column. Shafter
dropped back on his shoulder blades.</p>

<p>"Today's the day, Hines. Want to lay a bet?"</p>

<p>"What you bettin' on?"</p>

<p>"A fight," said Shafter. "I feel it in the middle of my
belly."</p>

<p>Hines looked around him to the troopers scattered on the brown
grass. "Some of those lads ain't heard the sound of bullets
before."</p>

<p>Shafter lay idle, staring at the sky. One small cloud fluff
sailed alone overhead and the sunlight had begun to brighten the
blue arch. The day would be hot. "War," he murmured, "is a
woman&mdash;beautiful when first kissed."</p>

<p>The mention of a woman brought the near-by Bierss upright from
his prone position. "I'm a dumb one, Professor, but I get
that."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Hines.</p>

<p>Bierss grinned at Shafter. "And you didn't get it out of no
book."</p>

<p>Custer came down the camp, riding bareback. He stopped near
Moylan. "Be ready to move at eight. Varnum sends word there is a
concentration of hostiles to the west of the divide." He rode on.
Shafter closed his eyes and fell instantly asleep. Presently he
heard a trumpet blowing far away and somebody dug him urgently in
the ribs and Bierss was saying: "Come on, rise and shine."</p>

<p>The regiment collected itself, slowly and with effort, and
moved forward. From his place in the saddle, Shafter saw Custer
and a small party riding on ahead. Dust began to steam up around
the column again.</p>

<p>Custer galloped forward with Girard, one of the civilians lent
him by Gibbon. Two miles on, he found Charley Reynolds waiting
for him at the foot of Crow Peak Reynolds led him up the slope
toward a round knob from which the country fell away in its
broken wrinkled outline. To the north, they could see the long
cavalry file move forward in a smoky, serpentine line, gradually
following the creek bed and sheltered from sight by the ridges to
either side of the creek. Here, adjacent to Crow Peak, was the
height of land which marked the head of the Rosebud's valley. To
the west the land ran in small gullies and tangled ridges toward
the Little Bighorn.</p>

<p>Varnum and Bouyer and Reynolds stood near the general; the
Crows made a group of their own near by. Custer lifted his
glasses on the valley to the west and gave it a careful scrutiny,
a prolonged attention. He lowered his glasses. "I see nothing,"
he said in a disappointed tone.</p>

<p>"Look beyond the valley to the top of the bluffs," urged
Varnum. "The Sioux horse herd is there. A big one."</p>

<p>Custer tried again, and shook his head. "I see nothing."</p>

<p>"Look for worms wiggling along the ground," said Varnum.</p>

<p>Custer took one more try with his glasses. Varnum waited in
silence worn down by his steady riding and feeling the weight of
his responsibilty. Custer shook his head as he lowered his
glasses. "No, I make out nothing."</p>

<p>Varnum showed his disappointment. "The Crow are quite certain
of a big camp over there. We saw smoke rising on that plateau an
hour ago. Dust smoke from horses. The Crow are also quite sure we
have been seen by Sioux scouts."</p>

<p>"No," said Custer arbitrarily, "we haven't been seen. We've
been riding under the rim of the valley."</p>

<p>"The Crow are sure we have been," stated Varnum. "They think
the Sioux are off there in great numbers, waiting for us."</p>

<p>Charley Reynolds, always an extremely quiet man, now put in
his advice. "You're going to have a big fight, General. A hell of
a big fight."</p>

<p>"What do you base that on, Charley?" asked Custer.</p>

<p>Charley thought about it in his mild, thoughtful manner. "On
my medicine," he said. "I have lived in the West a long while. I
know what's up when I get a feelin'. I have seen enough tracks to
convince me and enough dust to be certain." He pointed west and
said seriously: "There are more Indians over there, General, than
you ever saw in one place before."</p>

<p>One of the Crows gave a grunt and pointed to the northwest.
Looking down from the knob, Custer and the rest of the party saw
four Indians riding rapidly through a coulee toward the Rosebud.
They had been somewhere near the crest of the divide, blended
with the brown and gray soil; now they traveled away fast, their
ponies breaking the dust.</p>

<p>"We've been spotted for certain," said Varnum.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," said Custer. "They couldn't see the regiment
from there."</p>

<p>Charley Reynolds and Girard and Bouyer and Varnum gave the
general a silent attention, forbearing to say more. Suddenly he
turned off the knob, got to his horse and led the group
downgrade. The head of the regiment had reached the foot of the
ridge and now halted at his command. He said to his trumpeter
orderly: "Officers' call," and sat on the ground, waiting for his
officers to assemble. His buckskins were powdered with dust, his
bright red kerchief silvered with it. Three days of hard sun had
scorched his extremely fair skin. Beneath the flare of his
great-brimmed hat, his bony features were soberly composed, his hawkish
nose dipped and his eyes narrowly fixed upon the earth before
him. He dug his fingers into the soil and lifted dust through
them as he considered his problem with his restless will, his
driving wishes. Presently he stood up to meet his officers.</p>

<p>They came forward on slow feet, all men worse for the wear,
wanting sleep and suffering from a thirst the alkali water of the
region could not slake. Dust and heat had gotten into all of
them; even Major Reno's sallow cheeks were flushed; and Benteen's
naturally florid complexion was scarlet. They stood jaded and
lackluster around him.</p>

<p>"The camp," said Custer, "seems to be over that way," and
motioned his arm westward. "The Crows are certain of it. I am
not. The Crows likewise think we have been discovered. I am not
inclined to agree. In any event, we move that way as soon as
troops are in order. We will now break the command into three
wings. Reno, you take M, A and G Companies. The scouts and guides
will also be attached to you, and Doctors Porter and DeWolfe will
follow your battalion. Hodgson will be your adjutant. Benteen,
you will have your own company and also D and K. McDougall will
remain as guard for the pack animals, and the arrangement of six
men and a noncom from each troop to handle the animals will
likewise remain as it is. Mathey will command that detail. I
shall take C, E, F, I and L. Doctor Lord will go with me. You had
better fill canteens and water the horses. We may not have time
to do that later."</p>

<p>The officers went doggedly away, and presently watering
details broke for the creek. A hot sun poured down from straight
above and the air was thin and still. Custer stood alone by his
horse, the old flame of haste burning in him, the old impatience
nagging at him. He turned sharp to his adjutant who remained
faithfully near by. "Cooke, ride through the command and take the
report of the troop commanders when they're ready."</p>

<p>Shafter filled his canteen and brought his horse to water and
watched it test the surface of the creek with its sensitive nose.
It blew against the water, it smelled the water and expelled a
breath and tried to skim the surface away, and lifted its head.
The alkaline taste was too strong. Boots and saddles cracked the
warming day, and at half-past twelve he was mounted again, moving
forward.</p>

<p>The column rose with the divide, leaving the creek behind it,
and now filed westward through the wings of a shallow pass. The
horses were worn down and the command began to stretch out and a
warning kept running back: "Close up&mdash;close up!" Moylan
turned his head and beckoned at Garnett who rode near the foot of
the troop. Garnett came up briskly to join Moylan. Shafter heard
the captain speaking.</p>

<p>"I shall tell you this while we have time to speak of it. I do
not give many commands, since my noncommissioned officers are all
old hands at the business. But when I do sing out, I want quick
answers. Half or better of the company has not been under fire.
Therefore these men will shoot too fast and waste ammunition. You
must constantly watch for this on the skirmish line. Keep the
fire steady but hold down the hotheads. You must keep counseling
these green men not to fire unless they have something to hit.
You must also keep the company closed up. The Sioux always try to
split a command into detail and chop up the pieces. Let nobody
straggle or fall back on your wing. That is the main thing I want
to tell you. Keep this company always together." He nodded,
sending Garnett back.</p>

<p>Hines turned to McDermott and murmured: "You're top kick if I
drop. Remember to get the duty roster out of my breast
pocket."</p>

<p>There were three sergeants with the troop, Hines, McDermott
and Shafter, the others having been detached for various duties;
there were four corporals, and forty-one privates now riding two
and two down the western slope of the broken hills. Ahead of them
at a distance lay the half view of a valley stretching along the
timber-fringed Little Bighorn, gray and dark olive and tawny in
the hazy heat fog. Benteen suddenly swung out from the column's
head and drew his three troops with him. Shafter heard Reno call
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where you going, Benteen?"</p>

<p>Benteen waved an arm at the rough hills to the south of him.
"Goin' to scout that&mdash;and drive everything before me." He
had, always, a dry voice and it was impossible to tell how much
irony lay in it now. He shouted back and drew his own company
after him, and Weir's and Godfrey's. These three rattled
away.</p>

<p>A Company now was the head of the column; and suddenly Cooke
dropped back from the general, who rode fifty yards ahead. Cooke
reined around beside Reno. "The general," he said, "directs you
take specific command of M, A and G."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Reno.</p>

<p>"That is all he said," confirmed Cooke, and galloped
forward.</p>

<p>The pitch of the hills steepened and the way wound between
gray chunks of earth and clacked across a rocky underfooting.
There was a little stream to the right of them dropping in liquid
bubbling toward the Bighorn. Dust thickened and the horses
grunted with the effort required to check their descent. Custer
swung in his saddle and pointed at Reno, and then pointed across
the creek; Reno at once crossed his column over. Now the two
battalions marched side by side, Custer's to the one hand of the
creek and Reno on the other. Meanwhile the pass widened as it
descended and the ground before them showed the chopped tracks of
fresh Indian travel. Moylan looked at those tracks with
considerable thought.</p>

<p>The troopers moved through the dense dust, sweating and
cursing, steeped in their own misery, gaunt from weariness and
from thirst; but the pace quickened and a strange, lively feeling
got into Shafter&mdash;the same warning of battle which had gone
through him so many times before. The guides were ranging ahead,
lifting up and down the little rolls of land which now and then
shut out the valley before them.</p>

<p>Custer shouted at Reno and waved his hat in signal, whereupon
Reno swung the column over the creek again, bringing the two
battalions together. Suddenly they capped a ridge and saw a lone
tepee standing in the valley before them. Custer flung up his
hand, halting the command, and the Ree scouts went forward in
stooped, lithe positions, like scurrying dogs closing in on a
scent. Girard swung to the right, climbing a small ridge which
gave him a view of the land beyond. Meanwhile the Rees, growing
bold, reached the lodge. One of them entered&mdash;and came out,
crying at Bouyer. Bouyer said to Custer: "A dead Sioux
inside."</p>

<p>Girard shouted down from his vantage point on the ridge.
"Injuns, runnin' down the valley!"</p>

<p>The Rees had set fire to the tepee. Custer spurred up the
ridge beside Girard and had his look into the valley and turned
and rushed down the ridge, yelling at the Ree chief, Bloody Hand:
"Tell your people to follow them!"</p>

<p>Bloody Hand spoke back at the Ree. They stood still, saying
nothing and not moving, and presently Bloody Hand shook his head
at Custer. Custer cried out: "Forward," and started down the
creek with the two columns racking after him. The little ridge
which had blocked their view now petered out into the plain of
the valley and gave them view of the creek as it looped toward
the brush and willows which marked the course of the Bighorn.
Dust in the valley showed where the fleeing Indians had been. The
two columns pitched forward, men rolling in their saddles and
sergeants shouting back. Cooke and Captain Keogh rode over from
Custer's column and fell beside Reno, all of them at a canter.
Cooke said:</p>

<p>"The Indians are across the Little Bighorn, about two miles
ahead of us, now. The general directs that you follow them as
fast as you can and charge them. He will support you with the
other battalion."</p>

<p>The Indian trail crossed the creek. Reno's battalion went
splashing over the water and pointed at the Little Bighorn in its
grove of trees. The valley continued beyond those trees, not
visible to the troopers. Looking back, Shafter saw the column
under Custer veer away in another direction, and presently slide
behind a knoll of ground. In that direction the valley rose to a
line of high bluffs.</p>

<p>Reno struck the Bighorn at a place where the trees were
thinnest and yelled back, "Don't let the horses stop to drink!"
Moylan turned to Shafter and repeated the command. Shafter
dropped out of his file and stood with his mount belly-deep in
the water. Corporal Bierss' animal came to a dead halt and thrust
its muzzle eagerly down. Bierss sawed at the reins and cursed it,
and then Shafter spurred near and gave it a hard kick with his
toe and sent it on. But the little delay had broken the
compactness of the line and troopers were tangled midstream,
their animals half crazed by thirst. Shafter and McDermott ranged
among them, kicking them on. A horse stumbled and went down and
water sprayed up, wonderfully cool. Moylan's great voice bawled
from the far bank and Mcintosh of D and French of M were laying
words about them like ax handles.</p>

<p>The column crossed, fought through the willows and came upon
the broadened valley before them. To the right, across the
stream, a bluff lifted and grew taller as it moved away until,
two or three miles south, it was a ridge crowned by round-topped
peaks; on the left the valley was held in by a low, slow-rising
slope. Ahead of them, at a distance, a wooded bend of the river
closed out the farther view of the valley; a mass of dust rose
beyond those trees. At this moment Cooke came splashing across
the ford and shouted at Reno. "Scout reports there's a hell of a
lot of Indians under that dust smoke&mdash;beyond those
trees."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;all right," said Reno. He sat on his horse
while troopers straggled out of the river. The companies had lost
formation and officers were calling and sergeants swore their men
into formation. Horses plunged, turned frantic by the excitement,
and one horse took the bit in its mouth and raced a hundred yards
away before the company checked it down.</p>

<p>"Take your time," said Reno. "There's enough ahead for all of
us. Form up&mdash;form up!" He shouted at Cooke who now had
wheeled back into the water on his return trip to Custer.
"Where's Custer?"</p>

<p>Cooke turned in his saddle, shook his head, and pointed
vaguely; and disappeared. The three companies had formed and now
were in columns of fours. Men sat with hard-handed grip on the
reins, dusty and water-splashed, reddened by the hard scorching
of the sun, half exhausted and hungry. Reno called: "Mcintosh,
you're reserve. Varnum, take your scouts out on the left flank."
He rose in his saddle to give the forward command, but changed
his mind and turned to look at the valley. There was no Indian to
be seen on it yet, but the whole floor showed the scarring of
their ponies&mdash;and the distant dust column rose heavily
behind the trees. Suddenly he spoke aside to his orderly. "Ride
back to Custer. Tell him the Indians are in force in front of
us." Now he rose in his stirrups again and shouted:</p>

<p>"Left into line&mdash;guide center&mdash;gallop!"</p>

<p>The column broke like a fan, fours slanting out and coming
into a broad troop front. The two advance companies formed a
spaced skirmish line sweeping at a gallop down the valley, A to
the left and M to the right, Reno, Hodgson, Moylan and French
riding forward, and Garnett and DeRudio behind. G Company made a
second line in the rear. Over to the left, skirting the edge of
the footslopes, Varnum commanded his Ree scouts; with him were
Reynolds and the two half-breed Jacksons, Girard, Herendeen, and
the Negro Dorman.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; CHARGE AND
RETREAT</h2>

<p class="first">IT was a two-mile run down the length of that
valley toward the trees which barred their farther view. Dust
thickened steadily behind the trees, and puffs of dust rolled
forward around them and something flashed in the core of the
dust&mdash;like lances glittering. Reno, out in the lead, turned
in the saddle as he galloped and looked back anxiously toward the
crossing of the river, looked for the support Custer had
promised. The plain was empty. At the same time DeRudio shouted:
"That's Custer waving his hat on the bluff!" Shafter, throwing
his glance to the high bluffs to the right, across the river,
thought he saw a single horseman on that far crest move slowly
out of sight.</p>

<p>They were nearly abreast the trees which formed a screen; they
swung to pass the trees and so continue down the valley. On the
left, Varnum was cursing above the racketing roll of sound, above
the thud and jingle and the heaving and the crying of men.
"Goddammit, come back&mdash;come back!" His Rees had been
watching the dust in the foreground and they had sighted the
on-racing shape of Sioux; now they turned and fled. Bloody Hand,
their leader, called and beckoned; but when he saw them run he
flung up an arm and turned back to Varnum and the white scouts
remaining. It left a gap in the left end of Reno's line. Suddenly
Reno cried through the turmoil at Mcintosh. His voice failed to
carry but the gesture of his arm was enough. Mcintosh spurred G
Company forward into the line.</p>

<p>They skirted the timber and pushed by it. The dust storm was
ahead of them, no more than two hundred yards away, and now the
shadows within the dust leaped out of it and rushed
on&mdash;Sioux warriors bending and swaying and crying. One wave
of them wheeled and made for the left flank of Reno's line,
meaning to turn it. Reno tossed up his arm and his mouth formed a
phrase that was seen but scarcely heard: "Prepare to fight on
foot!"</p>

<p>Horses went crazy in the sudden milling halt, in the sing of
rifle fire, and for a moment the line was beyond control. One
young trooper let out a screaming yell and plunged into the dust,
his horse uncontrollable. Shafter watched him disappear, never
again seeing him. Troopers dropped from their saddles, and in
groups of threes flung their reins to a fourth trooper who
wheeled and ran back with the mounts. The line became a crescent
of kneeling men; the officers dropped behind to unmask the fire
of their companies. Reno walked calmly to the rear of his
command; he stood with his legs apart and his revolver drawn,
taking careful aim and firing with deliberation.</p>

<p>The trees now were behind the command and the solid dust in
front; and suddenly a wave of Sioux broke forward and curled
around the left, where Varnum was posted with his guides. Firing
rattled up from the troopers' thin ranks and Varnum's little
group was in the thick of a swift, wicked melee. Sioux lead
struck the earth hard by throwing up little streamers of dust,
and men ducked and grunted at the sight of it. Hines knelt beside
Shafter, sweat making straggling marks down the patched dust of
his face; his complexion was purple but his lips were pulled
apart as if he were grinning. "Professor," he said, "I wish I was
thirty years younger."</p>

<p>The Sioux shots made a thin rain along the earth; their lead
breathed hotly past. An arrow struck short and wavered snakelike
on the dust. A man to the right of Shafter gave one soft grunt
and settled forward on both knees. Hines turned his head in that
direction. He called: "Cobb, you hit?" Hines had a grim stretch
to his lips and he raised a hand to dash the sweat from his face;
but the hand went halfway up, halted there and dropped. His head
jerked from the impact of a bullet, his eyes rolled. He said,
"Ah," and dropped dead.</p>

<p>Reno shouted, "Forward," and Moylan repeated it. Shafter
reached to Hines's breast pocket and pulled out the roster book.
He looked around him and saw other figures lying still; he saw
McDermott shake his head. Wallace trotted toward Moylan and Reno.
"Pressure's getting very strong. We're going to have our left
flank caved in. Can't we send back to Custer for support?"</p>

<p>The Sioux were wheeling crisscross through the dust, charging
and firing and rushing away. They made a greater and greater
pressure, against which Reno's line slowly moved until it could
move no more; men settled to their knees for better fire. Over on
the left, Shafter watched Sioux suddenly appear out of the
wrinkled high ground and sweep behind the cavalry line. To the
right, where the river lay, he saw the cloudy shapes of Indians
darting through the willows. Reno saw it too and stood still to
think of his position. Wallace had trotted toward Varnum's
position; now he came back with Billy Jackson, one of the
half-breed guides.</p>

<p>"You want to go back and find Custer?" asked Reno.</p>

<p>The dust had rolled over them and beyond them; there was no
view of the valley in any direction. Billy Jackson saw all this
and shook his head. "They've cut us off. No man could get
through."</p>

<p>The horseholders, a hundred feet behind the line, were firing
into the smoky haze, now being attacked from the side. Reno said
to Mcintosh: "Pull out your company and go guard the horses."</p>

<p>Mcintosh and Wallace both signaled G Company out of the
skirmish line. Firing began to strike at them from other angles,
left and right. Young Lovelace cursed his gun and reached for a
knife to dig a stuck shell from the chamber. Shafter stood up to
look for McDermott, whereupon Bierss grinned at him. "Damn you
and your black tunnel. It bothers me."</p>

<p>Shafter called at a youngster wildly firing: "Take your
time&mdash;take your time! You're hitting nothing!" He saw
Garnett standing a yard behind the line, as tall as if he were on
parade. The lieutenant had his revolver half lifted and his eyes
strained into the dust mist, waiting for a target. Whiskers
darkened his sallow face; his mouth was trap-tight. Shafter moved
back in time to see George Busby drop. Donovan raised a crimson
face and called at Shafter. "We can't hold this place. Somebody
better tell Reno that while there's time."</p>

<p>Reno knew it and Reno had made up his mind and had given his
orders. Moylan was shouting those orders through the steady slam
of gunfire. "Drop back to the timber!"</p>

<p>The line rose, ragged and broken, and slowly retreated,
followed by the bold and confident Sioux who charged closer and
closer to the cavalry guns. They were sweeping down in greater
numbers on the left, and their lead came out of the river
willows. Under this cross-whip of fire some of the green troopers
began to break and run for the timber; the voices of the officers
struck them and seized them and settled them to an orderly
withdrawal. Pace by pace, the line gave way and presently got to
the protecting edge of the brush and timber and stepped inside
it.</p>

<p>As soon as they left the open ground they lost contact with
each other; the battalion lost unity and runners began to crease
through the brush, seeking the major for his orders. Reno had
taken stand in a little clearing in the middle of the timber. He
had his adjutant Hodgson with him, and his trumpeter; he listened
to the firing slash its way through the loose brush and strike
the tree trunks and ricochet on in whining tangents. He ducked as
one of these sounds came close, and swore at himself. He said to
his trumpeter: "Get the horseholders up here in this
clearing."</p>

<p>A runner sifted through the undergrowth. "Captain French says
the Sioux are massing on the other side of the Bighorn and mean
to make a crossing and cut us off!"</p>

<p>"Tell French to swing his company against the river side,"
said Reno. Then he turned to Hodgson. "Go see where A and G have
got themselves placed."</p>

<p>Shafter crouched at the edge of the timber and watched the
Sioux shapes lace the thickening dust before him. They raced
forward through it, firing at the timber, and wheeled and faded
away; they were curling around the grove, drawing a tighter ring
about the command. The woods reverberated with the steady echoes
of the troopers' firing and he heard men crying questions through
the thicket. The men of A Company were spaced so far apart in the
brush that he saw only the nearest files. Donovan was on his
left, coolly waiting, coolly firing. Bierss knelt at his right.
Bierss was a heavy man and had dripped his sweat all the way up
the Rosebud, but now Bierss had no moisture left in him and gave
Shafter a glance of pure misery. "Pretty soon I got to crawl to
the river for a drink, Professor." Shafter passed him his
canteen.</p>

<p>The pressure increased against the grove. Shafter had the
feehng that the troopers on his left flank had drifted toward the
center of the area. There was no longer any resemblance of order.
Cut off from their commands, the men grew afraid.</p>

<p>"Bierss," he said, "how much ammunition have you left?"</p>

<p>"Fifty rounds. Where the hell you suppose Custer is? He was
goin' to support us."</p>

<p>Shafter got up and broke through the brush to his left. He
found Lovelace and Ryan and Corporal Mudd; after a ten-yard gap
he discovered O'Dale. He said: "You seen McDermott?"</p>

<p>"No," said O'Dale. "I ain't seen anybody. Where's the rest of
the outfit? I'm all alone here."</p>

<p>A bullet touched a willow and went on with the sound of a
hard-plucked banjo string. He pushed farther on to make contact
with the lost fragments of his company; he parted the brush
before him, at the same time hearing carbine fire strengthen
behind him. That would be the Sioux crossing the river. He lifted
his voice, calling: "McDermott!" Suddenly, knocking the thicket
aside with the barrel of his carbine, he came face to face with a
Sioux, all naked save for a breech clout. The Sioux took a
backward pace and flung up his carbine. Shafter had that one
instant in which to see black shock dilate the man's lids, to see
a reaction stretch the red man's face broad. He fired and heard
his bullet tear through the Sioux's chest, and for the briefest
moment he watched the Sioux fall and turn and die.</p>

<p>Deeper in the trees he heard Garnett shouting: "Moylan, where
are you?" He turned back, not knowing the Sioux were filtering
into the woods artd that in a little while the battalion would be
completely surrounded and completely trapped. He passed O'Dale
and then struck off toward the heart of the timber and had gone
fifty feet when he met Moylan.</p>

<p>"We can't stay here, Captain. We'll be out of ammunition in
fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"Reno's debating a retreat," said Moylan. "The Indians have
crossed the river and broken our flank there."</p>

<p>"They're coming in on this side, too."</p>

<p>"I'll go tell Reno that. Pull the company back toward the
center."</p>

<p>Shafter retraced his path to O'Dale. "Give way to the middle
of the timber." He went along the line again repeating it, and
reached Bierss. "Swing to your right and tell the lads to collect
in the center clearing." Then he turned to the left once more,
seeking to find the other flank of A Company, lost somewhere in
the thicket. He passed the dead Indian and drove his shoulder
through the small willows, listening to the steady crackle of
gunfire. Dust came into the woods from the plain and presently he
caught a smell that was something else than dust&mdash;the taint
of leaves burning. Directly after that he heard the dry rustle of
flames. The Sioux had fired the grove.</p>

<p>He found three A troopers together in an isolated spot and
sent them back; now crouched and running, he moved twenty feet
and came upon Doctor Porter, kneeling over Charley Reynolds.
"Fall back. Doctor," said Shafter. "Toward the center."</p>

<p>"Give me a hand with Charley," said the doctor and turned to
Reynolds. He put a hand on Reynolds' chest and shook his head.
"No, never mind," he said and got up. The Negro Dorman lay dead
ten feet away with a little ring of cartridges around
him&mdash;and a trooper from M was near at hand, also dead.
Shafter ran across a clearer patch of ground with the doctor
behind him; when he reached the middle clearing he saw the
remnants of the battalion gathering from the edges of the grove,
and the horseholders standing ready. Reno waited by his horse,
his feet apart and his face flushed and dark; he was an anxious,
uncertain man with a terrible decision riding his shoulders.</p>

<p>He said: "Where's Mcintosh&mdash;where's DeRudio?"</p>

<p>Shafter moved down A Company's half-assembled ranks. He said,
"Bierss, have you seen McDermott?" Bierss shook his head, too
tired to answer. Heat lay through the trees in smothering
pressure and the flung-up dust grew heavy and the smell of smoke
increased. Carbine fire rattled all through the timber and men
straggled forward, so spent that they dragged the butts of their
guns on the ground. Lead from the Sioux guns whipped the
clearing. Moylan and Wallace and French waited&mdash;and grew
tired of waiting. French said: "This position is becoming
untenable, Reno."</p>

<p>The Ree leader. Bloody Hand, swung up to his pony and
murmured, "Better go&mdash;better go."</p>

<p>Reno cast a strained eye around a command grown thinner from
casualties and from strays still lost in the grove. The weight of
his decision grew so great that it deadlocked his mind. But
suddenly he said, "We'll charge back up the valley and cross the
river to the bluffs." He swung to his saddle, close by the
waiting Bloody Hand. Moylan and French were calling to their
troops and men rushed toward the horseholders and the confusion
grew into half panic, Mcintosh plunged breathless from the woods,
his hat gone and his dark face pinched.</p>

<p>"Column of fours!" roared Moylan.</p>

<p>"My troop's not collected!" said Mcintosh.</p>

<p>French shouted at him, "We can't wait. Tosh. You go first,
Moylan. I'll follow. Bring up the rear, Tosh!"</p>

<p>Reno had swung his horse around; and at that instant a Sioux
bullet made its sightless track across the clearing and punched
its way through Bloody Hand's brain, showering blood on the
nearby Reno. The major flung up a hand to his face, so badly shaken
that be jumped from the saddle and said, "Wait!" The
loose-formed
column began to break apart under the pressure of bullets singing
and sighing all around. The smell of smoke came to the horses and
fright grew among them. Reno shook his head and clawed his way to
the saddle. He yelled, "Forward!" and set his horse to a
gallop.</p>

<p>The column, not yet untangled, followed in loose
disorder&mdash;all the officers laboring to get the battalion in
some sort of shape. They were in full motion when they came out
of the timber into the valley, into the rolling clouds of dust
raked up by the Sioux who had now swept around the grove and set
up their sharp fire at the column's head. Horses slammed together
under excitement and troopers, venting strange needs, began to
yell full voice. Reno and Hogdson led the way, Reno swaying
hatless in his saddle. Moylan galloped beside Shafter, now and
then looking back at his troop. When the head of the column had
gotten a hundred yards from the grove, Shafter glanced behind him
and saw M Company directly following; but beyond M Company, G
came in scattered, straggling bunches.</p>

<p>Wallace tore forward, overtaking Reno. He yelled: "For God's
sakes men, don't run! Don't let them whip us!"</p>

<p>Reno turned his head and harked out a savage answer. "I am in
command here, sir!"</p>

<p>Dust rolled heavier and heavier and suddenly the Sioux darted
in, riding parallel to the column. They made dark, shining
figures on their horses; they flung up their carbines, took
bobbing aim, and fired. They made sudden dead-on runs at the
column until their horses scraped against the running mounts of
the troopers and presently the column, pouring forward at a full
run, was engaged in a deadly, hand-to-hand wrestling.</p>

<p>Shafter jammed his carbine into its boot and now used his
revolver point-blank. He saw his targets waver and he turned to
watch an Indian fall and noticed Lovelace locked in a Sioux's
tight grasp&mdash;the Sioux seeking to unhorse the lad. Shafter
wheeled and blew a hole in the Sioux's flank and gave a sudden
push to Lovelace, who was three quarters out of his saddle. But
the Sioux were racing up in greater numbers, pressing in with a
daring that came from sure knowledge of their victory; and the
close fire struck home and troopers fell screaming and riderless
horses bolted away. Shafter saw Lieutenant Mcintosh running alone
beside the column with two Indians boxing him. He swung over, but
was too late. Mcintosh flung up both hands and his head bobbed
down. Shafter watched him disappear beneath the hoofs of the
oncoming Indians. Far back he noticed a little isolated band of
troopers drop out of sight as the Sioux cut across and blocked
their escape.</p>

<p>It seemed an endless, hopeless run down the valley. The
battalion was a skeleton, its identity half buried in the
smothering, close-riding Sioux; the horses ran in the loose gate
of near-exhaustion. Shafter galloped beside Bierss who rolled
like a drunk in the saddle. Bierss' face had a stoniness on it,
an unrecognizing blankness. Shafter cried: "Sit up, Bierss! Hang
on!"</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured Bierss. "A long day&mdash;a long day."</p>

<p>Reno had swung the column toward the river, apparently meaning
to cross. This maneuver brought them close by the bordering
willows and thus they ran with the bright flash of the water
beckoning them at the foot of a bank which ran sheerly up and
down, too high to jump. Across the river stood the wrinkled hard
slopes of bluffs whose rough-crowned tops promised safety.</p>

<p>One trooper wheeled from the column, came to the edge of the
bank and made his desperate fifteen-foot leap. Horse and rider
struck in a great spray and afterwards the horse struggled on
alone, the rider never coming to the surface. Garnett, so far at
the foot of A Company, now put spurs to his horse and drew
forward until he rode abreast Reno, and he cried out, "Here's a
ford," and rushed down a crack in the bluff.</p>

<p>The battalion followed that narrow cut to the edge of water.
The leading horses, crazed by thirst, slackened and tore the
reins free from the troopers' tight grasp. They stopped
belly-deep in the stream and made a barricade which spread back and
blocked the small pathway down the bluff; the men of the
battalion, coming on in desperate haste, fanned out and took to
the river from whatever point they found themselves. Carbine fire
began to whip at the troopers in the water.</p>

<p>Shafter had crossed the river when he saw Donovan's horse
drop, sending Donovan to the ground. Donovan got up and shouted
as troopers fled by him toward the rising slopes of the bluff.
Donovan lifted his pistol and took his stand, firing back across
the river, blood-flushed but cool. Shafter ran beside him and
kicked one foot out of his near stirrup. Donovan put his foot in
the stirrup and lifted himself behind Shafter, whose horse now
dropped to a slow and weary walk.</p>

<p>"There goes Benny Hodgson!" shouted Donovan.</p>

<p>Hodgson had fallen midstream, waist-deep. He got to his feet
and staggered forward. A passing trooper paused long enough for
the boy lieutenant to seize a stirrup and in this manner he was
towed out of the river, turning around and around, dragging his
limp feet. He was on the gravel shore when a second bullet
dropped him. For a moment the trooper paused and was on the
impulse of dismounting; then he saw Hodgson to be dead and rushed
at the slope.</p>

<p>Halfway up that hard, bitter incline, Shafter saw Doctor
DeWolfe die, struck by a bullet from the heights. Troopers dotted
the trail, some racing far ahead, some still coming over the
water; they slashed the last grain of energy out of their
half-dead horses, they scrambled afoot; they stopped to fire, they
plugged on, one weary yard at a time; they collapsed and sat in
morhentary agony, and got up and went on again. They fell and lay
still.</p>

<p>Not far from the summit Shafter saw Garnett reel in his horse,
make a futile grab to save himself, and fall shoulder first. He
was crawling upgrade on his belly when Shafter passed him and he
turned his head hopefully and looked up, about to ask for help;
but when he saw Shafter he closed his mouth and groaned and
resumed his painful inching progress.</p>

<p>Shafter reached the crest and found Reno with half a dozen
troopers already arrived. Reno stood hatless, watching his broken
battalion come up with a gray, dazed expression on his face. He
kept saying: "Spread out and cover the others." Donovan dropped
off and Shafter dismounted and fell to his stomach on the edge of
the crest, bringing his carbine into play. For a moment he lay
wholly still, his heart painfully pumping, his throat parched dry
and his chest aflame. He felt himself half groggy and for a
moment he had to squeeze down on the carbine to keep himself from
fainting.</p>

<p>One by one troopers reached the crest and fell in their
tracks. Moylan arrived and French came up, both going to Reno.
"We had better arrange a defense here," said Moylan. "The Sioux
will re-form and attack."</p>

<p>Far down, near the water's edge, Shafter saw the Sioux rush
toward dark figures on the ground, bend and describe a swift
motion, and rise and run on. Garnett lay flat on the ground,
three hundred feet below, apparently dead; but presently Garnett
raised his head slightly and looked up to the crest&mdash;and
lowered his head again, turned still. Across the river, back in
the valley out of which the battalion had made its way, the Sioux
were swinging and racing toward the grove; they were streaming
around the grove to the valley's lower end, beyond sight.</p>

<p>"They're not following up their attack," said Moylan.</p>

<p>"I'm damned glad of that," said French. "We're out of
ammunition."</p>

<p>He heard someone yell, "Here comes Benteen," and he looked to
his left, eastward along the bumpy spine of the bluffs. Benteen's
three companies moved briskly forward and Benteen jumped from his
saddle. He said: "Where's Custer?"</p>

<p>"I'll be damned if I know," said Reno. "He was to have
supported me. We got down there and took one hell of a beating.
Where's McDougall and the pack train?"</p>

<p>"Coming," said Benteen.</p>

<p>"Send somebody back to him. Tell him to cut out one ammunition
mule and get it here as soon as possible."</p>

<p>The Sioux made a long, cloudy line on the plain, racing away,
and Moylan murmured: "I don't understand that." Then, in the
following half silence, all of them heard one far-away volley
westward.</p>

<p>"There's Custer," said Benteen. "In a fight."</p>

<p>Troopers continued to struggle up the slope, their eyes glazed
by exertion; and now other troopers, partly rested, moved back
down from the summit to rescue the wounded stragglers. Shafter
heard the officers talking near by, but he paid no attention. He
had his eyes pinned to Garnett's motionless shape. He watched the
man, and a steady hatred held him still. Bierss crawled beside
him and groaned and lay full length. "Professor," he murmured,
"it was bad."</p>

<p>"We're here," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"A lot of us ain't," said Bierss. "There's Hines and
McDermott&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But we're here," said Shafter roughly. He laid aside his
carbine and slid down the slope. A stray Sioux bullet struck near
him and in the thin heated silence the crack of it sounded on and
on. He got to Garnett and crouched. "You alive?"</p>

<p>Garnett slowly turned his head on the dust. He looked at
Shafter's feet, murmuring, "You got any water?"</p>

<p>"No," said Shafter. He hooked Garnett around the shoulders
with his arms and sat him upright. He braced the man against his
legs and heaved again, pulling Garnett up. He balanced him a
moment, doubting his own strength; then he crouched and in one
sharp effort he got Garnett on his shoulder and went up the hill.
His feet ground into the soft, rocky underfooting and slid back.
A bullet struck short and ricocheted with a liquid whining;
elsewhere a carbine flatted an answer. He said at the extreme end
of his lungs, "You dog, I shouldn't be doing this." Fifty feet
from the summit, Donovan came down and gave him a hand.</p>

<p><br>
AT five o'clock, a dust-red sun flamed low on the
western horizon and from the west now and then came the pulse of
gunfire, so faint that some men heard it and others were
uncertain. It was the worried and impatient ones who heard it; it
was the exhausted who neither heard it nor cared. The valley
below was almost empty of Sioux but in the rocky crevices of the
two higher points surrounding this peak Indians lay and
intermittently fired. Benteen, salty and cool under disaster,
moved briskly around the rim of the peak, posting the companies
while the jaded Reno moved aimlessly from point to point,
unafraid but dazed by what he had undergone and what he feared he
must yet endure. The walking wounded toiled painfully up the
stiff slope; details were bringing up those critically injured,
while Doctor Porter moved among them, making such shifts as he
could.</p>

<p>McDougall's B Company had arrived with the pack train and
extra ammunition. Captain Weir, one of Custer's nearest friends,
stood arguing with Reno, half pleading, half in ill-covered
anger. "We should be moving out to support Custer. He is very
definitely engaged at the lower end of the valley."</p>

<p>"So were we very definitely engaged," said Reno, irritably.
"My orders were to attack and that I would be supported. I
attacked. I was not supported. I had no orders at all to support
Custer. It is only by God's miracle we survived to reach this
hill."</p>

<p>"He may be in extreme trouble," said Weir.</p>

<p>"He may be," said Reno. "And so are we. Take a look around
you. Weir. Does this look like a battalion presently fit for
service?"</p>

<p>"Definite orders or not," said Weir stubbornly, "you have your
judgment to exercise. I should think judgment would indicate
supporting the wing now in need of help. My God, there are a
thousand or two thousand Sioux down there fighting him."</p>

<p>"I'm better aware of it than you are," said Reno, dryly. "I
have just come out of all that. My judgment is first to protect
my own battalion. We shall be attacked again."</p>

<p>Weir went stamping angrily away and Shafter saw him move over
to his lieutenant, Edgerly. The two remained in considerable
conversation, after which Weir mounted his horse and came back
toward Reno. He dismounted and said something to Reno, and then
got on his horse and moved out to the north alone. Within five
minutes Edgerly pulled D Company into formation and followed
Weir. In that direction the faint volleying sounded again.</p>

<p>Benteen came up to Reno. "Where's Weir going?"</p>

<p>"Damned if I know."</p>

<p>"You're in charge here, aren't you?" said Benteen acidly. "I'd
suggest you pull him back."</p>

<p>"No," said Reno, temporarily resolute. "We'll move out and see
if we can support Custer, wherever he is."</p>

<p>The troops drearily assembled. Blankets were opened and the
wounded placed upon them, four men to a blanket. In the harsh,
swimming sunlight of late afternoon the battalion started west
along the rough summit of the bluffs. A mile onward they got to a
high peak and saw the lower end of the valley, all hazy with the
churning of Sioux horses, and on a lower peak they discovered
Sioux madly circling into sight and riding down out of sight
again. Beyond that lower peak was a hidden extension of the
valley; and from it came one last volley, followed only by the
popping of an occasional gun.</p>

<p>Weir was ahead and now Weir stopped, his troopers dismounting.
The crooked ravines before Weir suddenly disgorged Sioux and
within five minutes he was in a bitter fight, gradually
retreating until he came upon the main command. "Now, dammit,"
cried Reno to Weir, "you see what it's like!"</p>

<p>Indians erupted over the lower peak and slashed forward; they
struck up from the long slopes to the north; they clambered
forward on the rocky outcrop of the sheer bluff to the south. The
battalion, thus abruptly faced with fire from three sides, slowly
jockeyed itself into position. D took the force of the attack
while the remnants of A and G painfully moved backward with the
wounded. Presently M replaced D and then Godfrey dismounted K and
made a screen for the rest of the command; thus beyond six
o'clock Reno's battalion, exhausted by a steady twenty-four-hour
march and half destroyed by an afternoon's fighting, reached its
original peak and flung itself into defensive position. Benteen
paced back and forth, maneuvering the companies in a rough circle
to defend the knob; there was a shallow depression in the middle
area of the knob and here he posted the pack horses and made a
breastworks of the packs, behind which he placed the wounded.</p>

<p>"Wallace," he said, "put G here," and indicated the place with
his arm.</p>

<p>Wallace said wearily: "There are just three men left in
G."</p>

<p>"Very well. Place those three here."</p>

<p>The sun was low and the light had changed. Now at this hour,
the Sioux poured back, clambering up the bluff, sidling along the
ravines and rock barriers, boiling across the river. From the two
adjoining higher peaks the Sioux fire began to break, plunging
down upon the exposed circle. That leaden rain splashed up the
dust and furrowed the sandy earth, biting into men and animals
and packs.</p>

<p>"God damn that sun," panted Bierss. "Why don't it set?"</p>

<p>Shafter lay flat, watching the distant rocks, waiting for a
fair shot. Donovan died silently beside him; a crazed horse
rocketed around the circle and stepped on his outstretched legs
and charged down the slope, and tripped itself on its dropped
reins and went end over end in a small avalanche of shale all the
way to the river. There was no letup while daylight lasted; that
pelting storm played cruelly and fatally upon them all as they
crouched and dismally took panishment. The command was a
half-unconscious body, quivering to each added lash but unable to
strike back. At eight o'clock the sun fell and the shadows came
mercifully to end the gunfire; in the twilight and in the onset
of peace, Shafter stirred out of his position like a man drugged
and heard a trooper crying among the wounded.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; FAREWELL TO
GLORY</h2>

<p class="first">NOW men who had been wounded and who had said
nothing of it began to move toward the center of the area where
Doctor Porter steadily worked and voices began to lift, shaken by
agony. "Who's got some water?" The officers stirred around,
taking check of their companies. Moylan said to Shafter: "We have
got to dig in tonight. They'll be at us when daylight comes.
We've got to throw up breastworks. Where's Garnett?"</p>

<p>"Over there," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Alive?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Shafter.</p>

<p>He got his bacon and hardtack out of his haversack and sat
down to his first meal since the night before; but he had no
water and his mouth was too dry to dissolve the hardtack and
therefore he chewed on the raw bacon for its moisture, and
presently grew thirstier. The groaning of the wounded got
steadily worse and one of these men had a question that never
left his tongue: "Where's Custer? Why don't he come?"</p>

<p>Somebody, anonymous in the darkness, flung back an answer:
"He's pulled out and left us, like he did Major Elliot at
Washita."</p>

<p>Moylan spoke up, coolly. "Let that go, boy."</p>

<p>Pickets were sent down-slope and presently stragglers, trapped
in the grove or the river's willows during the valley fight,
began to creep in. Shafter listened to their hard breathing and
the sudden grunt that came out of them when they sat down. He
moved along A Company's line. "Start digging. Dig yourself a
hole. Make yourself a shelter."</p>

<p>"What with, Sarge?" asked O'Dale.</p>

<p>"A knife or a spoon if you've got nothing else." He came to
Bierss and found the corporal sound asleep. He stood a little
while, hating to break that exhausted slumber; he nudged Bierss
with his foot and then he had to reach down and shake the
corporal. "Bierss&mdash;dig yourself in."</p>

<p>"The blacker the tunnel the better," murmured Bierss. "What
you meant was just to rest and forget, wasn't it. Professor?
Sounds better now than it did before."</p>

<p>The call for water from the wounded was a thing that rubbed
Shafter's nerves raw; it was worse than anything that had gone
before. Some of A Company's men were over there in Doctor
Porter's compound; he thought he heard Lovelace and stepped over
and found the boy. Lovelace had a hole in his leg above the knee,
and he was trying to endure it without complaining, but his voice
shook when he spoke. "Jesus, I hope this thing don't get so bad
they have to cut it off. You got a drink, Sarge?"</p>

<p>Shafter unhooked Lovelace's canteen; he collected a dozen
canteens and searched for Moylan in the shadows. "I'm going down
to the river."</p>

<p>"The valley is crawling with Sioux," said Moylan. "Hear all
those owls hooting?"</p>

<p>"I can hoot as well," said Shafter. "Remember when we crawled
through the rebel lines?"</p>

<p>"The rebels weren't as smart as these Sioux."</p>

<p>"Where do you think Custer is, Myles?"</p>

<p>Moylan thought about it a long while and let his voice fall to
a murmur. "Maybe he broke through and went on to meet Terry, but
I don't think so. I think he's dead. I think they're all
dead."</p>

<p>"So he waved his big hat and went out to meet his
beloved."</p>

<p>"I don't mind that so much," said Moylan. "But he took more
than two hundred men with him. Terry's all we've got to hope for
now, and he'd better come soon. There's three thousand Sioux in
that damned valley and they'll all be at us first thing morning
comes."</p>

<p>Shafter dropped down the slope, softly calling to the pickets.
He tried to make a quiet trip of it, but the loose shale crumbled
beneath his boots and rolled away. Half-descended, he stopped and
listened into the night; at the lower end of the valley he saw
Sioux campifires burning and he heard strange rhythms and strange
echoes drift forward. He crouched in the muddy darkness for ten
minutes and then proceeded with greater caution until he got to
the softer ground at the bottom of the bluff; and went directly
to the water's edge. He flattened on his belly and drank
sparingly and drew back to feel that cold wetness spring through
him like an acid injected into his veins; it was the sharpest
possible sensation through every part of his body. He put his
arms into the water when he drank again; he ducked his head under
and drew back once more, licking his tongue against his dripping
mouth.</p>

<p>He filled the canteens and crouched still. There was a
sibilance in the willows, and a slight steamy echo from the river
as it flowed past, these sounds sharpening his feeling of danger.
He swung his head to orient one sound or another and he watched
the shadows pulse around him. He thought: "This is the last drink
for God knows how long," and regretted leaving the river; and
drank again, until he felt slightly sick. Gathering up the
canteens he turned back to the bluff.</p>

<p>The canteens weighted him down and they made a small racket
which betrayed his position. A third of the distance up the bluff
he sat down, suddenly so weak that he doubted if he could carry
the load. Somewhere now he definitely heard a body gritting along
the nearby surface of the bluff, and in a little while a voice
said: "They're up this ravine. Come on." He sat still and let the
party go on ahead of him. He wanted to call to them for help, but
the night was too still to take the risk.</p>

<p>He grew less cautious, once they were ahead of him, and now
tackled the slope again, each foot of advance using up his wind;
his leg muscles ached and he seemed to have a hole in him through
which his strength poured like sand. Presently he sat down,
feeling the dogged beating of his heart. "When I was twenty, this
would have been easy." It was harder to rise and the steepness of
the slope dragged at him and pulled him back. Dried out as he
was, he began to sweat. He thought: "If I stop again I'll throw
away some of the canteens, so I had better keep going." Beyond
the halfway point he had ceased to think of the Sioux creeping
around him and he no longer troubled to walk quietly. He created
a racket in the night, plugging one foot before him, making
strange sounds with his mouth, shoving himself on. A picket's
voice came at him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Give me a push," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"You got water?"</p>

<p>"Not for you," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"To hell with you then," said the picket.</p>

<p>Shafter churned the rubble under him; the whole weight of the
bluff bore against him and pushed him. His lungs had a spongy,
bubbling ferment in them and his pulse slugged at his temples,
his neck, his wrists. He was a man on the edge of collapse,
indecently listening to his own weakness. When he came to the
summit he stumbled and fell, flinging the canteens into the
darkness. The liquid sound of them brought men at him on the run;
he heard them searching the ground for the canteens. He rolled
over, suddenly furious. He got up and struck a bent shadow. He
panted, "Leave those alone!"</p>

<p>Bierss called at him from a short distance. "You want help
there, Sarge?"</p>

<p>He got his canteens together and walked over to Doctor
Porter's stockade, where the wounded lay. Doctor Porter crouched
beside a man, a stub end of a candle lighting his work. "A little
water," said Shafter.</p>

<p>Porter paused a moment and gave the canteens the sharpest kind
of stare; his own thirst tortured him and he showed the struggle
on his face. Then he called quietly into the darkness. "Toomey,
come here and dole out this water. None for you, Toomey, and none
for any who is able-bodied."</p>

<p>Shafter kept his own canteen. He saw Lovelace near by and he
bent and propped up the boy and gave him a small drink and
watched inexpressible relief slash sharp lines on Lovelace's
face. He stood up, oppressed by the sound of misery around him,
and by the smell of misery. Men lay under the feeble circle of
the candlelight, they were shadows beyond the candlelight. He
heard them calling: "Toomey&mdash;for God's sakes bring me a
drink!" Porter suddenly leaned back from his patient and gave the
man a long look. "Nothing more for you until we can get you in a
better place."</p>

<p>"You don't have to tell me that way, Porter."</p>

<p>Shafter looked around, recognizing Garnett's voice He stood
undecided in his tracks, hearing Porter answer. "I haven't told
you anything, Garnett," he said, and moved on to the next man.
Shafter bent, seeing Garnett's pale face grow rough with the
knowledge of his own dying. Garnett's eyes were wide and his
pupils were big; he stared up at Shafter.</p>

<p>"Light's bad," he whispered. "That's you, Kern?" Shafter
unscrewed his canteen top. "Take a drink."</p>

<p>"You're wasting it. I'll be dead in a little while."</p>

<p>"A man's got a right to die with a drink in him," said
Shafter. He stared down, not even now able to feel sympathy. His
hatred was as rank as it ever had been; this was a man he
despised, a man whose memory he would always carry like the scar
of a wound treacherously inflicted. It even rankled him that
Garnett should refuse water in order that the living might have
it; none of that charity or goodness had ever been in Garnett.
Garnett sighed. "Give me the drink, then," he said, Shafter slid
the flat of his hand behind Garnett's head and lifted it; he
listened to the greedy sucking sound of Garnett's lips on the
canteen. He pulled the canteen away. "That's enough to die
on."</p>

<p>Garnett moved his head, side to side. He murmured: "I think
the bullet smashed my spine. I can feel nothing from the hips
down."</p>

<p>"This time," said Shafter, "you couldn't duck." Garnett said:
"I was never afraid of anything and you damned well know it."
Garnett stared at him with a kind of malicious satisfaction.
"You're waiting for me to cry for mercy&mdash;or pity. You're
alive and I'm dying, and you're pleased as hell and you think I'm
going to go out on my hands and knees, crawling and afraid.
You're wasting your time. I'm not sorry for a thing I've ever
done."</p>

<p>"It is a good thing to know you'll never ruin another
woman."</p>

<p>A shadow came upon Garnett's face. He lay still and thought
about that. "Why," he said finally, "it was a game with me. The
only game that ever interested me. A man and a woman. A man in
pursuit of a woman. But you've got the wrong view of that, too,
Kern. I am a kind of a speciahst in women and I guess I ought to
know what lies in them as well as anybody. Now that I look back I
doubt if I ever ruined any woman. I doubt if I ever made a woman
do something she hadn't made up her mind to do. Do you understand
that, Kern?"</p>

<p>"No," said Shafter.</p>

<p>Garnett had a dying man's patience and now slowly brought his
thoughts to bear upon the thing he wanted to say. "A man is
supposed to be the hunter and the woman the hunted. Who started
that idea? A man did. A man always figures himself the one who
does the chasing and the winning. I have looked into the eyes of
many a woman and I have said to myself: 'I can make her want me.'
But that was really a delusion. It is women who really make the
conquests. They get what they want, Kern, but the blame goes to
the men. That's the way a woman holds a man&mdash;laying the
blame on him. She surrenders but she captures. I was smart enough
to know that. I played the game just as women wanted it played.
But I never let myself get captured."</p>

<p>"You believe that?" said Shafter. "Would you do it all
over?"</p>

<p>"I'd do every bit of it over," said Garnett.</p>

<p>"You're better dead," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"You're thinking of Alice," murmured Garnett. "A dead man
doesn't have to be a gentleman, Kern, so I'll tell you something
about her. She was my kind, not yours. You think I took her away
from you. I had damned little to do with it. She was after me and
I played the game. She knew you and I were friends. She broke up
that friendship without the least scruple. But after she got me,
she didn't want me. She was looking for fresh meat. She was a
beautiful woman, Kern, and she had no trouble at all in making me
want her. I had my illusions about her, as you did. I thought the
whole world was in her eyes, as you did. Then afterwards I
discovered the coldness behind her beauty. She cured me of my
illusions. I have never respected another woman. Is that candle
going out? It's getting dark."</p>

<p>"No," said Kern. "It is still burning."</p>

<p>"Then I'm the one going out," murmured Garnett softly. "What a
hell of a mess today's been. Where's Custer?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck for tomorrow," said Garnett.</p>

<p>Shafter had no answer for that. He watched Garnett with an
impersonal attention; he watched the man's face lose its
sharpness one line at a time, its definiteness one degree upon
another, until presently Garnett was a spirit quietly
withdrawing, half free but not wholly free of his body. Nothing,
he thought, stopped Garnett from immediately ceasing to breathe
except the mortal fear of the last long jump into space and
blackness. Garnett held on, dreading the step.</p>

<p>"In pain?" asked Shafter.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"The easy way," said Shafter, "is to just shut your eyes and
die."</p>

<p>"Kern," said Garnett, "do me one favor. See that I'm buried
deep enough to keep the coyotes from digging me up." Then the
faint malicious tone came back. "If you are alive to do it."</p>

<p>"Anybody you want a letter written to?"</p>

<p>"Don't be hypocritical, Kern. How could you compose a letter
of soldierly regret concerning me?"</p>

<p>"I could say you were dead, nothing more. Have you got anybody
who might care enough to hear it?"</p>

<p>"You always were a fellow who hated to change," murmured
Garnett. "You would burn your bridge rather than go back over
it." He was silent for so long that Shafter thought he had died;
then his head moved on the ground. He looked up into the night,
at the far stars winking. "The earth is my pillow, the earth is
my mistress. The earth is a woman and, like all women, stronger
than any man can be. Men are the vessels God made to carry
illusions. Women are the realists; they are the strength of the
race. They love, they hate, they bear. They pray and they sin.
But they are stronger than love or sin. If I had it to do over
again&mdash;" He ceased to speak, coming upon his final
convictions and knowing them and struggling with them. "I should
not do the same things. That's what you're waiting to hear,
Kern&mdash;the cry of a man afraid."</p>

<p>"I am disappointed in you," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"The last woman was the one I wanted and could not have
because of what I had been before I met her. That is something
you didn't know about me. I was more of a man of honor in her
presence than you supposed."</p>

<p>"Josephine?" said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Josephine," whispered Garnett and died.</p>

<p>Doctor Porter moved past, dropping his question. "How's
Garnett?"</p>

<p>"Finished."</p>

<p>"Fortunate," said Porter and knelt down with his candle beside
another man. Shafter got up and moved on his stiff, dead legs
toward the northern edge of the defense circle. He passed Moylan,
standing solitary in the dark. He said, "Here's a drink, Myles,"
and handed over the canteen. The captain accepted the canteen. He
shook it and judged its contents and for a long moment he
struggled with his thrist, and handed it back unopened. "Spread
it thin among the boys," he said.</p>

<p>"Garnett's dead," said Shafter.</p>

<p>"Poor soul," said Moylan. "Feel sorry for him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You had better catch a wink. Tomorrow's a bad thing to think
of."</p>

<p>Shafter found Bierss lying on his back. Bierss had scooped
himself a hollow spot the size of his body and had tossed the
dirt up as a breastwork and now he slept in the depression with
the dirt for a pillow. Shafter settled down, feeling the dullness
of his body throughout. He thought: "I've got to dig my own
shelter," and dreaded the chore. He was sore of muscle and dried
out and his lungs burned from exertion and dust; he was tired in
a way he had never been tired&mdash;made stupid and indifferent
by it. His mind moved slowly and his will had little effect, but
exhaustion had put a kind of poison in him which would not let
him sleep. He lay still, feeling the heat die out of the earth
and the air. Some of the wounded mercifully slept but for others
the agony went on and their groaning made him grit his teeth and
turn on the ground; over there in the improvised hospital men
were going through a hell that would leave its scratches on them
forever. This was the glory of battle&mdash;this was the end of
the band playing and the bright pennants flying and all the
dreams of gallantry and personal triumph; a man dreamed of glory
and it came to this. A lithe figure in a buckskin suit and a
flowing red tie stood up in his stirrups and flung his great hat
impetuously over his head and the regiment went into battle line,
the voices of men shouting out their power and their excitement,
and afterwards the smoke and heat and dust folded over them and
death struck and long later in the aftermath's stillness men lay
physically and spiritually smashed and thought only of water and
rest and peace.</p>

<p>Yet Garnett was right. Men were vessels to carry the dreams of
the race&mdash;the bright visions of gallantry and courage and
daring which made the life stream fresh and quick, the steadfast
visions of honor and loyalty, and the great flame of faith.</p>

<p>The good and the bad died for those visions, never wholly
realizing why they fought; the good and the bad lived to enjoy
the peace which came of nights like these, never fully
understanding how their peace was secured for them.</p>

<p>The name of this little battle in a remote western valley
would fade as time went on until few people knew of it or the
reason for it. But even if they forgot it, it would still be a
part of that red thread which ran continuously through the fabric
of the country. Battles of the past had stained the thread, and
this battle now would add its scarlet color, and other battles
yet to come. Some of these battles were just and some were
unjust, some were necessary struggles of survival, some need
never have been fought; but there was never any way of
knowing.</p>

<p>A man was faithful and he fought, and had his hopes of
betterment; and somewhere else a man stopped his plow and looked
upon the long furrows with his mind fertile with ambition; a
river packet steamed down the Ohio with its cargo of two hundred
people asleep while the pilot smoked his stogy in the wheelhouse
and watched the dark river bend; a jockey at Saratoga sat on his
horse at the barrier and wickedly waited for his break; a man in
some New York tenement room sat before his table and wrote his
pamphlet inciting the oppressed to rise against the barons of
coal and steel; a boy and a girl walked through moonlight under
the hickory trees of Indiana and knew nothing except each other's
presence; a married woman stood in a room and looked across it,
beyond the crowd and beyond her husband to her lover, and met his
glance and knew what it meant. The just and the unjust, the
faithful and the crooked, the pure and the sinful&mdash;all were
one, breathing a common air and pacing a common earth, the most
pure with his temptations and the most dissolute with his moments
of grandeur. All were one, walking forward through the sunlight
and the dark, each with his end but each a part of the life
stream which came out of time and went on into time.</p>

<p>This was his country and this was his part and his place. He
thought of Hines dead and Bierss alive; one an upright man and
one a lewd scoundrel. But each had taken his place in the ranks
of men and each had been faithful, one with his duties discharged
and one yet to suffer before his grace was achieved. Tonight the
camp lay at fitful rest and each of the living nourished his
memories, his wishes and his hatreds but all were waiting
together for tomorrow&mdash;and again would stand together. Their
lot was a common one; the commonness of it made all of them
good.</p>

<p>He thought: "I've got nothing but a spoon and a knife to work
with." He rose to a sitting position and found his haversack and
got out his knife and began to dig the sandy-powdered soil. He
worked mechanically, his muscles reluctantly answering his will.
This was the bitter end of a day now twenty hours old and pieces
of that day worked through his mind as strange and vivid pictures
telescoped together. He remembered many mixed sounds, and the
shock of cold water at the first ford went sharp through him; he
recalled the way Cooke had turned at the ford and had gone away,
his Dundreary whiskers flowing to the breeze of his gallop; he
remembered the terrified face of young Adkins, whose horse had
bolted straight into the dust and toward the Sioux. He thought:
"I shouted at him to fall off the saddle, but he didn't hear." He
scooped the loose earth into a mound and recollected Bloody
Hand's sudden shudder in the saddle and the violent blood
splashing against Reno's face. He could not recall when he had
last seen McDermott. He tried to recollect McDermott on the
firing line; he tried to follow McDermott from that point. "Dead
and scalped," he concluded.</p>

<p>Reno came tramping around the circle and stopped near Moylan.
Shafter heard the major speak with an exhausted incoherence. "How
in God's name can a man possibly sleep?"</p>

<p>"Who's asleep?"</p>

<p>"Benteen," said the major. "Sound asleep."</p>

<p>At midnight or beyond, Shafter had a shallow depression
scooped out. He thought, "There'll be hell around here at
daylight. They've got positions higher up and they'll scorch us."
But he had done all he could and now settled in his depression,
uncomfortably lying on his cartridge belt; he made some attempt
to adjust himself, and fell asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; BUGLES IN THE
AFTERNOON</h2>

<p class="first">HE woke with a sudden upfling of his body from
the ground, startled by the sound of a single shot. Day trembled
through morning's twilight and the peaks to either side of this
one now came into view; below him a mist moved thinly over the
Little Bighorn. Benteen strode past, sharp of voice and full of
vigor. "Keep under cover, boys. The music's starting again."</p>

<p>A second shot arrived, slitting the dust behind Shafter, the
echoes of it rolling on and on through morning's stilled air.
Bierss grunted to himself and pointed westward to the adjacent
peak, whose heights commanded this knob on which they lay.
"Comin' from there, but I don't see a damned thing."</p>

<p>Moylan came forward and sat down by Shafter. He said: "You
take the left wing of the company, I'll take the right."</p>

<p>"Myles," said Shafter, "don't expose yourself."</p>

<p>"I am too old to duck," said Moylan. He crossed his legs
tailor fashion and stared a long while at the hill from which the
fire now came more strongly. Lead arrived, breaking up dust and
forming a thin haze on the knoll. "Boys," called Moylan, "watch
those rocks and wait till you see something to shoot at. We have
got all day." Far below, fresh waves of Sioux came up the valley
and flung themselves at the river willows and made the water
crossing; they dismounted and began to work their way forward on
the slope, climbing in crisscross fashion and dropping behind the
rough furrows of earth, the frequent slabs of rock. The sun rose,
the first touch of it reminding Shafter of his thirst and his
hunger. This day would be hot.</p>

<p>"Give me your carbine," said Moylan and took it from Shafter
and braced his elbows on his knees and snugged the gun to his
cheek. He waited a long while, holding the muzzle dead on one
spot; the gun roared and the recoil slightly swayed him. His
mouth creased. He returned the carbine to Shafter, nodding.</p>

<p>Bierss said: "For God's sakes, Cap'n, get down."</p>

<p>"Kern," said Moylan, "I wrote a letter a month ago to General
Summers. You remember him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He's close to Sherman. I told him to open a case that had
been shut too long."</p>

<p>Shafter said, "You ought to let dead things alone. They'll
never touch it."</p>

<p>"I did Summers a good turn once when he was a young captain.
He owes me a turn and I told him I wanted it. A word from him to
Sherman will be enough. A word from Sherman will do all of it.
That would be a good thing."</p>

<p>"Once," said Shafter, "it would have mattered. Now, I don't
care."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the captain, "you do. Otherwise what brought you
back to the uniform?"</p>

<p>"I could think of nothing else to do."</p>

<p>"So you did the thing which was in your mind, my boy. You came
back. You'll be soldiering until you're mustered out an old man,
or until you're buried on the battlefield."</p>

<p>Shafter turned in his hole and smiled at the captain. "A bunk
to sleep in, a payday for a little whisky and a little
poker&mdash;that's enough, Myles."</p>

<p>"We shall see," said the captain and moved away, strolling as
though he were on Lincoln's parade ground with no care in his
mind.</p>

<p>Company A held the east segment of the circle, facing the
higher peak, from which Sioux fire now strengthened. H and K lay
overlooking the ford to the south and M guarded the west, taking
the fire from the peak which stood as a high point in that
direction. To the north, where the ridge ran gradually downward
into flat land, B and D and the pitiful remnant of G had been
placed. It was from this direction Reno and Benteen expected
attack.</p>

<p>The sun came full up. At nine o'clock the firing had grown to
an outright engagement and the Sioux had apparently begun an
encircling movement. A constant, down-plunging leaden rain came
from the two peaks to north and south. Along the lower rocks,
between the south rim and the ford, the brown Sioux bodies made a
spotty, shifting pattern against the gray earth. Reno came over
to look down that way and spoke his judgment.</p>

<p>"They wish to draw our attention. The main attack is shaping
to the north."</p>

<p>Over there the land fell gently, slashed by frequent gullies
into which the Sioux filtered in quick sallies; a great party
moved around the base of the southern peak, made a wide sweep and
rushed forward into the gullies. Benteen, vigilant and calm, came
up to Reno.</p>

<p>"If they get any nearer, they'll swamp us with a sudden
charge. We've got to attack."</p>

<p>"You'll lose every man you take out there," said Reno.</p>

<p>"We have got to drive at them," repeated Benteen.</p>

<p>Reno said irritably: "If you can get a party together you have
my assent to it."</p>

<p>The firing never let up. Horses began to drop in the center of
the area and the smell of powder lay acrid in the air. Bierss
snugged himself into his shallow pit, fired and loaded and fired
again until the barrel of his Springfield was too hot to grasp.
Moylan sat behind his section of the company, loading guns and
passing them to his troopers with his calm counsel. "Take your
time. Wait until you see the sweat on their bellies."</p>

<p>Shafter had gone to the left of the troop line; he stood here
watching the earth around him show dimpled jets of dust. Behind
him Benteen's voice made a strong, steady call and troopers were
gathering themselves for a rush. The Indian line, now drawing
about the knoll from all sides, brought a heavier gunfire to
bear. It grew into fury, echoes all blended into one rolling,
crackling racket. Shafter watched A Company's thin line wilt on
the ground; he watched men die and he saw them flinch and roll
helplessly aside and turn wild glances upon him. Bierss moved a
little in his hole, as if settling for a better aim; the
corporal's gun steadied on the nearby peak and the corporal's
body lifted and fell to his breathing. Shafter turned his head
for a brief while to watch Reno trot toward the other side of the
area. "Benteen," said Reno, "I'll take this." Swinging his
glance back again, Shafter noticed Bierss' gun tipped idle over
the dust parapet. Bierss had flattened himself full length and
seemed to be taking a short rest.</p>

<p>"Bierss," said Shafter, "look alive."</p>

<p>Trooper O'Dale looked about and shook his head. Shafter
stepped forward until he saw that Bierss had a bullet through his
brain.</p>

<p>Reno's voice came back through the hark and the snarl of
gunfire. "Forward!" Shafter swung and ran after him as the major
jumped forward with his revolver, leading his troopers downgrade
toward the nearest gully. Shafter came abreast of the line and
ran with it. He remembered the way Bierss had relished his
worldly pleasures, but he remembered, too, how Bierss had marched
and endured and fought and had grinned through all his
misery.</p>

<p>The skirmish line rushed on toward the gully, firing as it
ran. Reno had no hat and his lank hair jiggled down over his
forehead; he kept discharging his revolver at the gully and he
kept shouting: "Forward&mdash;jump 'em!" Men whimpered a little
and paused and sat slowly down and were left behind. Twenty yards
from the gully, Shafter watched Sioux spring out of it and run
backward toward the next lower gully. The slope of the plain
boiled with dust and his heart began to slug in his ribs again
from the run, Reno had stopped and turned. "That does it," he
said, his eyes round and black-ringed. "Back to the top." The
line swung, trotting upgrade, pushed now by the danger to the
rear. Bullets whipped by and scraped up flinty showers of earth.
Shafter breathed from the bottom of his lungs, he heard men from
the higher parapet call him forward. He reached the top and half
turned to look behind him, and at that moment he was struck hard
in the body and he dropped to his hands and knees and was puzzled
at his fall. He started to rise again, and saw Lieutenant Edgerly
striding toward him. He reached out for Edgerly's hand, but his
own arm grew too heavy and fell back. For the smallest interval
of time there was a roar in his head like the breaking of surf;
after that all sound ceased.</p>

<p><br>
THE sortie had driven the Sioux back from the near
coulee and the firing slackened and men began to reach out for
the wounded. A pair of D troopers carried Shafter to the pack
barricade before Porter, who worked on his knees, his sleeves
rolled up and his long hands blood-stained. He gave Shafter a
single, hard look and said to the troopers, "Take his shirt off,"
and returned to his immediate job.</p>

<p>Moylan came up a little later and found Porter working on
Shafter. Moylan said: "Where's he hit?"</p>

<p>"Near the kidney," said the doctor and leaned back to dash the
sweat from his nose.</p>

<p>"What's that on his face?"</p>

<p>"He hit a rock when he fell."</p>

<p>"Porter," said Moylan, "how much does a man have to suffer to
earn salvation?"</p>

<p>Porter shook his head and returned to his labors. He rolled
back Shafter's eyelids and peered down and sat a moment, making
up his mind; and got up and turned to the next man.</p>

<p>At noon, half a dozen desperate troopers ran the gantlet to
the river and came back with water. The sun moved on, blistering
the earth with its heat, and the wounded began to stir under it
and cry out when they could no longer be still. At two o'clock,
the Sioux fire grew brisk and for half an hour the command fought
doggedly; in the following lull the officers held a
conference.</p>

<p>"Custer must have gone on to Terry," said Weir.</p>

<p>"Terry," said Godfrey, "was due at the mouth of the Little
Bighorn this morning. He should be here."</p>

<p>Moylan shook his head. "If he's anywhere around this valley
he's in one hell of a fight, same as we are."</p>

<p>Captain French made a short roundabout gesture with his hand.
"Time can't be held much longer. We're being cut to ribbons. We
have got to move to one of those two higher points tonight."</p>

<p>"We have got to get water tonight," added McDougall.</p>

<p>Reno said dourly: "We have got to have help, or we won't last
tonight."</p>

<p>"By God, sir," said Benteen brusquely, "we'll last."</p>

<p>He had fallen asleep and now he was awake, and he had slept so
hard that his body was numb below the hips. He looked at the sun
crawling half down the sky; it had been straight overhead when he
last saw it. "How could I have slept for three hours?" he
wondered. He rocked his head from side to side and recognized the
barricade of packs and discovered men lying in a row beyond him,
some still and some groaning. Then he knew he had been hit and he
tried to move his legs and had no luck. Pain began to move
through him; it trickled like water and seemed to have no
source.</p>

<p>Toomey, Doctor Porter's orderly, was near by. He said: "What's
the matter with me, Toomey?"</p>

<p>"You got a hole in your guts," said Toomey.</p>

<p>Shock sickened him and a bitter fright yelled through him; but
that was only temporary. The wave of vitality passed, and left
him dull. He thought: "I must be dying."</p>

<p>The pain began to take on the rhythm of his pulse, slow and
steady, and in a little while he was a mass of flame. "Four days
ago," he thought, "we were at the mouth of the Rosebud and Custer
led us. Twenty-four hours ago we were coming over the pass. Then
we sighted the lone tepee." It was far back; it might have been a
month ago. He remembered how the troop had looked when it marched
away from the Yellowstone and he visualized the men he knew to be
dead, and then he visualized the troop without these men. "My
God," he said, "we're not enough to mount a guard."</p>

<p>He watched the sun slide west and he heard the firing come in
fitful volleys. A bullet occasionally struck the barricade of
packs with a sharp thump, and now and then a bullet bounced from
the earth and screamed through the thin hot air like a suddenly
burst piano wire. Moylan came over and looked down. "How are you,
Kern?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Terry ought to be up to relieve us pretty soon."</p>

<p>"I hope he's got a better hill than we have."</p>

<p>"The Indians have quit massing against us," said Moylan. He
watched Shafter a moment in an extraordinarily sharp
way&mdash;the way of a man who looks upon death; and then Moylan
went away.</p>

<p>There were fewer and fewer exchanges of firing. The men at the
parapets began to rise, dusty and parched, and to move around
with the looseness of physical exhaustion. The smell of the
wounded hung in the air, faintly sweet, faintly foul; the dead
man next to him had begun to swell in the belly. Details formed
and moved the horses downgrade toward the river, and he heard
Reno talking to Benteen.</p>

<p>"They've gone back toward the foot of the valley."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't be leaving us unless they were threatened
elsewhere," said Benteen. "That will be Terry or Custer."</p>

<p>A detail returned with water for the wounded. Moylan came over
to give Shafter a drink, and sprinkled some of it on Shafter's
face. There was smoke in the air.</p>

<p>"Sioux burning the grass in the valley," said Moylan. Godfrey
called to him and he went back toward the south rim of the
peak.</p>

<p>"Look there," said Godfrey.</p>

<p>The Sioux had broken camp at the lower end of the valley and
now were passing up the same area across which Reno's troop had
charged. The column was as wide as the valley itself and it
stretched on and on, braves and squaws and travois and horse
herd. All the officers and men lined the brow of the hill to
watch it pass and swing south into the broken land.</p>

<p>"A mile wide and three miles long," said Benteen, estimating
the column. "Fully three thousand warriors in that party. That's
what we ran into."</p>

<p>The sun had begun to set, its long rays flashing on Indian
lance and gun; the murmur of that vast band&mdash;the sound of
voices and the rattle of gear&mdash;came up the slope like the
faint babble of geese in the distant sky. Benteen said suddenly:
"There are white men in that outfit."</p>

<p>"White men's clothes," said Godfrey; and then all of them
heard the notes of a cavalry trumpet&mdash;a pure blast without
orderly meaning&mdash;come from the column.</p>

<p>"Clothes and trumpet," said Moylan. "There's your answer.
Stripped from dead troopers."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Weir in a groaning voice, "Custer would
come."</p>

<p>Moylan and the other officers only looked at him.</p>

<p>Night came down, the stars bright and immense in the sky.
Moylan brought Shafter a cup of coffee and said: "You want some
bacon, Kern?"</p>

<p>"No," said Shafter, "I'm not hungry, but I could drink a
gallon of water."</p>

<p>He turned on his side, but a great bomb of pain exploded in
his belly and sent out its waves of agony. He stretched his arms
and dug his fingers into the ground and slowly sweated and felt
sick. A wind came up and cooled him slightly; and thus partly
relieved, he fell asleep. When he awoke the wind still blew but
he was increasingly hot and he called softly for Toomey and got
another drink; and lay listening to the little sounds in the
camp, to the pacing of the sentries and the snoring of exhausted
men and the suppressed sighing and gritted suspirations of the
wounded around him. He saw light break through the east and when
day came he was a thousand years old, with strange thoughts in
his head; and he had made his exploration into the sub-world
which the living and healthy never see, and heat burned
throughout him; then he fell asleep a second time.</p>

<p>When he awoke again the sun had started up and he saw a column
of riders come over the hill's crest. General Terry in the lead.
Terry got down and reached out and shook Reno's hand and
Benteen's hand. There were tears in Terry's eyes.</p>

<p>"General," said Reno, "where is Custer?"</p>

<p>"Custer," said Terry, and nodded to the west, "is three miles
down there, dead."</p>

<p>"Where's his battalion?"</p>

<p>"Dead," said Terry. His voice broke and he bent his head,
wrestling with his self-control. "All of them, every man and
every beast. A terrible blunder&mdash;a terrible, tragic,
unnecessary blunder."</p>

<p>The group of officers stood around him in stunned silence;
their own ordeal had taken much capacity of feeling out of them,
yet this was a shock that all felt, this complete extinction of
five companies, all their officers and all their men who had
ridden away the previous afternoon. Reno lifted a hand and
surreptitiously wiped moisture from his eyes. Weir, who had loved
Custer, flung up a hand and turned aside. Terry looked around him
and saw the remnant of Reno's command and the brutal evidence of
its ordeal.</p>

<p>"What are your casualties?"</p>

<p>"I have got thirty dead and forty wounded. There are others
missing." Reno passed a hand over his face, at the end of his
physical resources. "I do not entirely know."</p>

<p>Terry stood still, looking into space, a sad and weary and
troubled man whose campaign, so carefully planned, so
thoughtfully and painfully arranged, had turned into greatest
disaster. This regiment which had marched up the Rosebud in high
hope, its colors flying and its commander dreaming of gallantry,
now lay as a broken thing on the dry hot earth, more than 250 of
its men dead and another sixty wounded. The regiment had come
upon the Sioux at the high flood of their power, upon the
greatest concentration of strength ever seen upon the plains.
Uncaptured and undefeated, that Sioux power now slowly moved
away, while Terry with his battered command could not follow.</p>

<p>He knew, as he stood so gravely here upon the scene of defeat,
how that defeat had come about. His trap, designed to snap shut,
had been prematurely set off by the impetuous disregard of
General Custer of his orders; wanting glory and blindly believing
in himself and his regiment, Custer had not waited; the power of
waiting was not in him. More than that the expected help of Crook
had not come. With a command greater than Terry's, Crook dallied
on the upper Powder, cautiously sealing himself in with
double-strength pickets, made afraid by his defeat and calling for help.
Of this Terry then knew nothing; it only mattered that the
campaign had failed.</p>

<p>He turned to his adjutant and said slowly: "Send a man back to
the <i>Far West</i> and tell Marsh to push the boat upstream as
far as he dares. We shall be bringing on the wounded, who must be
taken to Lincoln. Remind him to have plenty of wood aboard and to
arrange the lower deck as a hospital. We must have details out at
once to bury the dead. Waste no time. We have got to pull
out."</p>

<p>From his place behind the packs, Shafter saw the commands
sudden activity with a disinterested eye. Fever thinned his blood
and lifted him so that sometimes he seemed weightless above the
ground. The talk of men moved around him and left no impression.
He saw Moylan bend down and he heard Moylan speak, and nodded in
return. He saw the dead carried away and never quite understood
why. Later he was lifted into a blanket litter slung from poles,
two mules fore and aft on the poles; with this motion cradling
and easing him he slept and woke and saw the sky bright, and
slept again, later to wake and find the sky black. He heard
Lovelace's voice somewhere near him and Lovelace was saying:
"I'll be back. I'll be back." Three days later he was on the
<i>Far West</i> and only vaguely was aware of it; there was a
different smell and a different motion&mdash;and the sight of the
sky disappeared. From time to time he heard a whistle blowing and
always he heard the murmur of men&mdash;their sighing and their
suppressed words. Some of the words came from him.</p>

<p>On the third of July, the <i>Far West</i> blew its whistle for
the landing at Fort Lincoln and, with its jack staff black-draped
and its flag at half-mast, touched shore. A runner went out
immediately with the news and in the middle of the night officers
reluctantly walked toward Officers' Row to notify the wives of
the dead. The wounded were carried to the post infirmary. In
Bismarck, a telegrapher sat at his key to flash the news east,
and at midnight exactly someone rapped on the door of the Russell
house. Josephine had heard the boat's whistle. Now, moved by the
intimations of fear, she nose and dressed and hurried to the
post.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; "IT WAS WRITTEN IN
THE BOOK"</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was space around and above and below him;
he swept through it, back and forth, as though in a giant swing.
At times he rose directly upward and fell down and down yet never
touched earth. Occasionally, great storms swept this space and he
was whirled end over end with the screaming tumult of the storm
filling his ears; then calmness would come and he floated without
motion or sound or feeling. There were moments when he drifted
near consciousness and heard voices, and recognized his own voice
among them, and felt the touch of the bed and sometimes the cold
pressure of a hand on his face. Sensations of fire and
suffocation made him turn and protest; and after that he lost
these sensations and floated into complete blackness and knew
nothing. When he returned to near-consciousness he always knew he
had been away, and his mind always tried to distinguish the real
from the unreal but never quite succeeded. On those occasions
when he came out of blackness and approached the border of
awareness he seemed always to ask himself: "How long has it
been?" and his mind strained to answer the problem. Now it was
but a moment he had been away, now it was a hundred years. Time
was something that would not stay fixed; it had nothing definite
about it, nothing real. It was a distance between two
points&mdash;but the points were forever moving, so that the
distance was never the same. He walked back and forth between
those points time after time with his watch in his hand. It
always took him fifty-seven minutes, no matter how near each
other the points were, no matter how far apart they were. Then he
changed his way of calculation. He dug deep holes and buried
posts and laid rocks against them so they could not move, so they
would always be exactly in the same places. Now he walked back
and forth between them and found he could make the trip sometimes
in one minute, sometimes in six hours. But there was no
difference between the minute and the six hours. His mind
strained onward toward truth, reaching out and out and almost
grasping a thought but never quite touching it. It excited him
and he put all his will into it. He said: "There is no such thing
as time," and felt a great wave of peace roll cool and wonderful
through him. He would never have to worry about time any
more.</p>

<p>He stood again by one of the posts he had planted deep in the
ground and he looked around him. Where was north? Where was down
and where was up? Distance marched away, but it had no ending. It
began where he stood, but the place on which he stood was
nothing; it did not exist&mdash;and space marched out from
nowhere through nowhere, to nowhere. There were no boundaries.
When he walked away from the post he walked into emptiness, and
emptiness was all around him and it made no difference which way
he traveled, for there was no such thing as direction.</p>

<p>Then he returned to the post and he said, "But this is
somewhere&mdash;this is solid. I am here. This is here." He
reached out and touched the post to feel its solidness, and
discovered the post was an illusion, for his hand passed through
the squareness and the definiteness of it and there was no
squareness, no definiteness, no post. It did not exist. It was
only something he had wanted to be there. It was only a wish, a
dream. Suddenly he swept his hand back to his chest, to feel his
own solidness, and his hand passed through his chest, and he
looked down at his hand, and it was not there. He was not there.
He was a shadow in shadows. He was less than that&mdash;he was
emptiness floating in emptiness. "No," he said, "that can't be
true. I think and I feel&mdash;and I see." But what did he see
and what was it he felt? He sought for his answer, patiently and
stubbornly. He was alone, a bodiless thing in a space that had no
beginning, no form and no end. He was a voice that had not sound,
he was a wish, a dream, a spark of being. His mind worked at it,
pushing at the thought and pressing it narrower and narrower. He
was a spirit. Where came that spirit and what gave it power and
what was its form, its meaning or its purpose? He was still now,
he was motionless in the motionless void around him; but
somewhere in the void was a presence waiting for his answer.
"What am I?" he asked. Then he said: "I am something."</p>

<p>He awoke as he had wakened thousands of other times;
consciousness arrived softly and he opened his eyes and saw the
walls around him, the stove in the room, the iron frame at the
foot of his bed, the gray blanket folded there, and the orderly
looking down at him. Josephine sat beside the bed.</p>

<p>"Hello, Kern," she said.</p>

<p>"What time is it?"</p>

<p>The orderly gave him an odd glance and pulled out his watch.
"Nine in the morning."</p>

<p>"What morning?"</p>

<p>"Saturday morning. July 6."</p>

<p>"This Fort Lincoln?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Shafter lay with his head turned, watching these two,
Josephine and the orderly. They were solid figures silhouetted
against the daylight streaming through the hospital windows,
their voices made full sounds, and Josephine's lips were red and
real and there was a strange moist shining in her eyes. He said,
"Bend forward," and put out his hand. It had weight and the
weight was hard for him to manage, but he touched her cheek, and
felt its smoothness and its reahty. He murmured, "A very odd
thing," and then, as though this one gesture had worn him out, he
fell asleep.</p>

<p><br>
HE came awake again somewhere during the night and
felt the hollow, exhausted peace within his body. His lips were
rough when he touched them with his tongue and a great lassitude
made it impossible for him to move. But he was thinking of the
strange things which had been in his mind and now he tried to
bring them back, grasp their meaning and their dark importance.
They would not come; it were as if, close to the margin of death,
a gate had drawn aside to permit him a glimpse of another world.
But he had cheated death and the gate had slammed shut and some
power was even now at work, erasing within him the half-revealed
secrets which did not belong to him as long as he was in this
world. "A man could not endure living," he thought, "if he saw
both sides of the fence." He slept into the middle of the
following day and woke and was fed. Josephine came in for a short
time and sat at his bed. She watched him, darkly and without a
smile; it was the way he knew her best, her pride making her
strong, her will giving her force.</p>

<p>"Garnett's dead," he said.</p>

<p>"I know." Then she added, "Why do you think of that before you
think of other things?"</p>

<p>"He spoke your name." He thought of that a moment, and added:
"Of all the women he knew, you were the one he remembered."</p>

<p>"Did he ask you to tell me anything?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why are you speaking of him now?"</p>

<p>"A woman should know when a man dies with her memory in
him."</p>

<p>"And the memory of other women."</p>

<p>"No," said Shafter, "he wasn't thinking of the others,"</p>

<p>"Do you want me to thank you for telling me all this?"</p>

<p>"I am only doing a chore."</p>

<p>She watched him and he held his eyes on her, wondering what
emotions lay behind her self-control. He wanted some sign from
her, but she gave him none. She had closed up on him entirely so
that he no longer saw in her eyes or on her lips, nor heard in
the cadence of her voice, the telltale warmness of her heart. He
felt irritated at it, at her, and at himself.</p>

<p>She said: "Better sleep," and went away.</p>

<p>A little later he saw Mary Mulrane pass him. He watched her
stop at a far bed and bend over; he raised himself a little and
thought he recognized Lovelace in the bed. When Mary returned he
stopped her. He said: "How's Frank?"</p>

<p>She was happy, he saw; and she had been crying. "He's all
right," she said. "The doctor says he's all right. If I knew
about my father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your father," said Shafter, "was stationed at the Powder
River base. He's safe."</p>

<p>She looked at him and was tempted to speak of something; and
struggled with it, and spoke. "What happened to Jack Purple?"</p>

<p>"He died with his troop." He looked at her and felt free to
give her some advice. "Mary," he said, "don't waste a tear on
him. Your boy is better."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I know that. I always knew that. I am just
sorry&mdash;I'm sorry for all of them."</p>

<p>Major Barrows and his wife called that afternoon. They talked
a little while, the major inquiring about his officer companions,
those living and those dead. Mrs. Barrows sat by, scarcely
speaking, but attentive, and presently the major murmured, "Stay
a moment, Margaret. I want to speak to Doctor Jordan." He gave
his wife a sharp glance and strolled down the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrows said: "It was terrible for all of you, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It was a hard fight," he said.</p>

<p>She pressed her lips together and sat in silence, looking at
him in a rather desperate way. She turned her head to notice that
her husband was at the far end of the room and now she swung her
glance back to Shafter, suddenly grown strained and harassed.
"Sergeant," she murmured, "how did Edward Garnett die?"</p>

<p>He knew then how it was with her. He said to himself: "So he
got her, too." She loved the man and was tortured now. He thought
of what he was to say very carefully, and said it: "We were
halfway up the hill when he was hit. He got to the top and lasted
until that night. But he wasn't in much pain. He knew he was
dying and it didn't matter to him."</p>

<p>She absorbed his words. She sat still, waiting for him to
continue, her eyes begging him to add something she seemed in an
actual agony to hear. Presently she drew a long sigh and spoke in
a tone scarcely above a whisper. "Were you with him when he
died?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did he speak of me at all?"</p>

<p>This was what she wanted to hear, so urgently that she had
stripped herself of her honor before him. It meant life or death
to her.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "he called your name when he died."</p>

<p>Feeling rushed across her face and filled her eyes.</p>

<p>She drew a ragged breath and her hands came togethei and
whitened with pressure. She started to speak to him but found no
voice. She bowed her head, struggling with her composure, and in
a little while the major returned from the far end of the room.
Shafter noticed the way his eyes surreptitiously touched his
wife. Then the major said quietly: "We mustn't wear him out,
Margaret."</p>

<p>She stood up, very cool again. She said: "God be with you,
Sergeant," and for the first time she smiled.</p>

<p>Major Barrows had started away, but now came back and looked
down at Shafter. "Sergeant," he said, "how could it have
happened? How could it have been possible?"</p>

<p>Shafter murmured: "I've been thinking of it. General Terry
split his forces into two sections, to approach from different
sides of the Sioux. That turned out to be a mistake. Then Custer
split his regiment into three pieces&mdash;and that was a
mistake. He was to have waited for Gibbon to come up. He was to
have sent a scout through to check with Gibbon. He didn't send
the scout through, and he didn't wait. Both mistakes. We had
counted on Crook, but Crook never came. Add all those things
together."</p>

<p>Barrows said: "If Terry had held his command together, if
Custer had waited&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We still would have been beaten, I think. There were too many
Sioux."</p>

<p>"A tragedy of errors," sighed Barrows and shook his head.</p>

<p>Shafter looked at the major. He looked at the major's wife.
What he said was for both of them. "Men do the best they can.
That's all they can do. This thing was written in the book. The
hand that writes in the book is one over which we have no
control."</p>

<p>'"It is as good an answer as any," said Barrows and led his
wife away.</p>

<p>The wind blew rough and dry across the parade as the major and
his wife stepped from the hospital. The major took her arm and
looked at her with a consideration that was odd in him. "Turn
your face from it, Margaret."</p>

<p>"I'm not that fragile."</p>

<p>"This land is hard on precious things," he said.</p>

<p>She gave him a startled glance, "Why, Joseph, I haven't heard
you say that for so long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," he murmured. "I know."</p>

<p>Shafter lay in a still and wonderful ease while his mind
turned the case of Mrs. Barrows patiently over and over. She had
been a woman racked with terrible emotions, with feelings so
urgent that she had bared herself to him; and then in one phrase
he had restored within her some faith, some flame, some spiritual
loveliness more necessary to her than her loyalty to her husband.
Maybe she had been lonely most of her days, the grace and romance
of life slowly shriveling until Garnett had come along to see her
need and to prey upon it. Perhaps she had feared or suspected it
was a cheap thing with him, nothing more than a conquest in
return for all her passionate giving, and so she had come to him,
to Shafter, for one word which would restore her faith. Well, he
had given her the thing she wanted to hear. He had supplied
Garnett's memory with a dignity the man himself did not
possess.</p>

<p>But he thought of other women Garnett had captured by his
charm and it occurred to him that all of these women had seen in
Garnett something which he was not. How had they seen it then? He
puzzled over it until he remembered Mrs. Barrows' eyes. It was a
dream they sought to make real. These women all had hungered tor
the music, the color and the vivid richness of hving; it was a
cry in them, to be important, to fill the empty tissues of
existence with those full and beautiful experiences for which the
human spirit was created. They had come to Garnett, crowded of
heart and body, and had made their surrender in hopes of a like
return. That was their fulfillment&mdash;to love and to be
loved.</p>

<p>He remembered the stillness on Josephine's face, the stillness
upon her lips; and he slept.</p>

<p>The hospital orderly brought him a letter the next morning.
"Came last week," said the orderly. "War Department."</p>

<p>It was from the adjutant general. It said:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">By order of the General of the Armies, please
be informed that your record has been reviewed and certain
findings set aside. This is your authority to request
reinstatement, as first lieutenant of cavalry, United States Army.
If you wish to act upon this authority, make application through
the adjutant. Seventh Cavalry, submit to physical examination and
return papers to this office for approval.</p>

<p><br>
Moylan, he thought, had done that. When Josephine came that
afternoon he showed the letter to her and watched her eyes move
back and forth over the writing. She had an intent, interested
expression on her face, and her lips stirred and she looked at
him with a lively expression playing behind her reserve.</p>

<p>"Are you going to accept it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Many things have happened to you, Kern. Some of them have
been harsh. Or were you a wild young man?"</p>

<p>"It was a woman with whom I was in love," he said. "Garnett
was my best friend in those days."</p>

<p>"He took her from you, Kern?"</p>

<p>"Or she went to him. Who knows about those things? In any
event, the world fell down. She had come down behind the lines to
see me. This was in the Shenandoah Valley, in a little town. When
I got away to go to the town to meet her I found Garnett with
her. The hotel room," he added irrelevantly, "had rosebud
wallpaper. I drew my sword on him and we fought all the way
downstairs and out through the door. I slashed him and he fell.
He was senior to me as an officer and naturally preferred
charges. Neither of us could explain the cause of the quarrel and
therefore it stood as insubordination on my part. I was dismissed
from the army, enlisted under another name and served the rest of
the war as a private."</p>

<p>She listened to him with an absorbed attention. She said
swiftly: "You saw her again. You told me that once. When you saw
her, Kern, did you have any great feeling about her? Did you hate
her greatly, or still want her greatly?"</p>

<p>"I saw her in Fargo, on my last mail trip. It was all
gone&mdash;everything. You can't restore faith. I was very young
and love is a terrible thing when you're young."</p>

<p>"But not when you're a mature man, Kern?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>She said: "I can understand why you hated Garnett. You still
do, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "It would be difficult for me to hate any man,
living or dead, who rode down that valley with me."</p>

<p>"But he changed your life for you."</p>

<p>"Maybe I did my own changing. I lay no blame on anybody for
what I am."</p>

<p>She spoke out of a dark, cold distance. "He always walked
between you and other people. Whenever he did that, you were
never the same. He destroyed your faith. You have never had it
since. Not in anything or anybody."</p>

<p>"Could I have a drink of water?"</p>

<p>She poured out of a jug into a glass. She started to hand it
to him, then bent and slipped an arm under his head and lifted
him and held it. Her hand was warm and firm on his back, her eyes
intently searched him, her lips stern. He dropped back, hearing
sharpness in her voice.</p>

<p>"You're so thin, Kern."</p>

<p>"I'll be standing retreat one month from now," he said. "In
this regiment."</p>

<p>"At least," she said, as though to herself, "you have faith
left in one thing, in your kind of men. That's all. For all other
things, you are an empty man. Garnett and that woman killed so
much in you. They left you a bare, bleached skeleton."</p>

<p>"Why, Josephine," he said. "He's dead and she's two thousand
miles away."</p>

<p>"Are they?" she said and rose. She looked down at him in a
way he well remembered, hating him bitterly for his lack of trust
in her, injured by his unspoken judgment. It was the same look
she had given him when he had faced her in the kitchen of the
Benson house. "I don't think so, Kern. Whatever he touched he
ruined for you. You don't forget and you don't change your mind."
The anger in her was real. Her feeling in the matter was a
growing storm. "Perhaps," she said, "he destroyed many things for
me, too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Custer came to see him, and Algernon Smith's wife. They
sat by him, forlorn women now, each made aimless by a Sioux
bullet. Mrs. Smith took his hand and silently held it, asking for
comfort rather than giving it. He listened to the pacing of the
sentry on the baked earth and he heard the echoes strike hollow
through the emptied garrison. He had his recollections of Hines
and McDermott and of Bierss. There was a woman over at the Point
of whom Bierss had often spoken; she was a woman to whom any
soldier could go, but she had been fond of Bierss. He thought:
"I'll go over there and tell her about Bierss." He slept soundly
the night through and woke and was restless throughout the
morning and spent a long afternoon. He ate supper and watched the
lights go out and irritably composed himself for the night.</p>

<p>When Josephine came the next afternoon she gave him a keen
look. "You're better," she said. "You're cranky. Now I shan't
have to come as often."</p>

<p>"When did you first come?"</p>

<p>"The night the boat brought you down. It was twelve o'clock at
night. Who shaved you this morning?"</p>

<p>"The orderly."</p>

<p>"He left a mustache on you. Don't grow a mustache, Kern."</p>

<p>He had his head on the edge of the pillow, uncomfortably
turned to look at her. She watched him a moment, and bent forward
to lift his head and replace the pillow. She drew back her arm,
but held her position, looking straight down upon his face;
feeling roughened the smoothness of her lips.</p>

<p>"I can't reach up," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you want to?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you always want your own way? Do you always expect people
to come back after you've knocked them down?"</p>

<p>"When you hate a man," he said, "your eyes turn dead
black."</p>

<p>"It isn't hate," she whispered. "But I've got too much to give
you to even let myself start&mdash;if I can't be sure you have
something for me."</p>

<p>"Remember the last time I kissed you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was it a very mild thing, Josephine?"</p>

<p>Her lips were near and all her fragrance came to him; he saw
her lips move and become heavy, he watched her eyes darken. She
made a little gesture and put herself on the edge of the bed and
lowered her face to him, and her warmth and her weight came
impulsive and fully meant against him. She drew her mouth away,
whispering into his ear.</p>

<p>"Will you keep me close, will you never tire, will you never
be less than you are now?"</p>

<p>She waited for no answer, knowing him well; and came to him
again. It was like a tall fire springing up through the black
sky, touching heaven; and by its light the land around lay full
and mysterious and wonderful.</p>
