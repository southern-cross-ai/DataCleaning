<h2>CONTENTS</h2>
<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>
<h3>RELIGION AND MORALITY</h3>
<p class="ref">The meaning attached to the terms religion and magic,
pp. <a href="#page1">1</a>&mdash;6.&mdash;Distinction between
“natural” and “supernatural” phenomena or causes, p. <a
href="#page1">1</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;Mediæval conceptions of magic, p.
<a href="#page3">3</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;The theory that religion is
essentially social and magic anti-social, or at any rate non-social,
p. <a href="#page6">6</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;White and black magic, p.
<a href="#page3">3</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;Connections between religion
and magic, pp. <a href="#page4">4</a>&mdash;6.&mdash;The word religion
used in a concrete sense, p. <a href="#page5">5</a>
<i>sq.</i>&mdash;The foundation of the moral consciousness entirely
different from that of religion, p. <a href="#page6">6</a>.&mdash;All
moral concepts, which are used as predicates in moral judgments, based
on one or the other of the two moral emotions, moral approval and
moral disapproval or indignation, p. <a href="#page6">6</a>.&mdash;The
moral emotions retributive emotions, approval, like gratitude, forming
a subspecies of retributive kindly emotion, and disapproval, like
anger and revenge, forming a subspecies of resentment, p. <a
href="#page6">6</a>.&mdash;The moral emotions distinguished from the
non-moral retributive emotions by being disinterested and, at least
within certain limits, impartial, p. <a href="#page6">6</a>
<i>sq.</i>&mdash;Different classes of conditions under which
disinterested retributive emotions arise, pp. <a
href="#page8">8</a>&mdash;12.&mdash;The co-operation of the altruistic
sentiment with sympathy productive of disinterested retributive
emotions, when an individual towards whom we are kindly disposed is
hurt or benefited, p. <a href="#page9">9</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;Such
emotions also directly produced by the cognition of outward signs of
resentment or kindly feeling in others, pp. <a
href="#page10">10</a>&mdash;12.&mdash;Or by disinterested antipathies
or likings, p. <a href="#page11">11</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;How
disinterestedness and a certain degree of impartiality have become
characteristics of that particular kind of retributive emotions which
we call moral emotions, pp. <a
href="#page12">12</a>&mdash;14.&mdash;Those characteristics of moral
disapproval to be sought for in its connection with tribal custom,
which was the earliest rule of duty on account of the public
disapproval called forth by its transgression, p. <a
href="#page13">13</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;As public disapproval is the
prototype of moral disapproval, so is public approval, expressed in
moral praise, the prototype of moral approval, p. <a
href="#page14">14</a>.&mdash;Yet moral disapproval and approval have
not always remained inseparably connected with the feelings of any
special society, p. <a href="#page14">14</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;The
theory of the emotional origin of moral judgments does not imply that
such a judgment affirms the existence of a moral emotion in the mind
of the person who utters it, but it implies that the qualities
assigned to the subjects of moral judgments and expressed by moral
concepts are generalisations of tendencies to feel either moral
approval or disapproval, interpreted as dynamic tendencies in the
phenomena which gave rise to the emotion, p. <a href="#page15">15</a>
<i>sq.</i>&mdash;The relations between the concepts which are used as
predicates in moral judgments and the moral emotions, pp. <a
href="#page16">16</a>&mdash;20.&mdash;Analysis of “ought” and “duty,”
p. <a href="#page16">16</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;Of “bad” and “wrong,” p.
<a href="#page17">17</a>.&mdash;Of “right” as an adjective and as a
substantive, p. <a href="#page17">17</a>.&mdash;Of “injustice” and
“justice,” pp. <a href="#page17">17</a>&mdash;19.&mdash;Of “good” and
“virtue,” p. <a href="#page18">18</a>.&mdash;Of “merit,” p. <a
href="#page19">19</a> <i>sq.</i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>
<h3>RELIGION AND MORALITY (<i>concluded</i>)</h3>

href="#page21">21</a>.&mdash;The improvement of gods, p. <a
href="#page21">21</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;Selection of gods according to
their usefulness, p. <a href="#page21">21</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;Their
good qualities magnified in worship, p. <a href="#page23">23</a>
<i>sq.</i>&mdash;Gods induced by invocations to reward virtue and
punish vice, p. <a href="#page24">24</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;The magical
forces which give efficacy <span class="pagenum"><a
id="pagevi"></a>vi</span> to curses or oaths personified as
supernatural beings or transformed into attributes of the chief god,
p. <a href="#page25">25</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;Gods as moral
specialists, pp. <a href="#page25">25</a>&mdash;7.&mdash;The notion of
a persecuting ghost replaced by an avenging god, p. <a
href="#page26">26</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;The guardianship of gods
extended to the whole sphere of justice or morality at large, pp. <a
href="#page26">26</a>&mdash;8.&mdash;The influence of the religious
sanction upon morality, pp. <a
href="#page28">28</a>&mdash;31.&mdash;Religious devotion accompanied
with laxity of morals, pp. <a
href="#page29">29</a>&mdash;31.&mdash;Criticism of philosophers’ and
theologians’ assumption that moral judgments possess objective
validity, pp. <a href="#page31">31</a>&mdash;9.&mdash;The variability
of moral judgments and its causes, pp. <a
href="#page34">34</a>&mdash;9.&mdash;The cause of substantial
similarities of moral judgments, p. <a href="#page39">39</a>.

<a href="#page55">55</a>&mdash;7.&mdash;Forgiveness on the ground of
repentance, pp. <a href="#page57">57</a>&mdash;9.&mdash;The emotion of

<h3>THEOLOGICAL DOCTRINES BEFORE AUGUSTINE</h3>
<p class="ref">Throughout the history of Christianity we notice, as
regards the means of procuring salvation, the antithesis between works
and faith: between the moralistic view that eternal life is the reward
of a moral life wrought out essentially by our own power and the view
that it depends entirely on divine grace, connected with the faith in
Christ as our redeemer through his death on the cross&mdash;in other
words, broadly speaking, the contrast between the teaching of Jesus as
reported in the synoptic gospels and the Pauline formula of
justification by faith alone, p. <a href="#page130">130</a>.&mdash;In
the sub-apostolic period the moralistic mode of thought very prominent

Clement there is an echo of Paul’s teaching, but no real Paulinism, p.
<a href="#page132">132</a> <i>sq.</i>&mdash;The letter bearing the
name of James looks like a definite polemic against Paul’s teaching of
justification by faith only, p. <a href="#page133">133</a>
<i>sq.</i>&mdash;The Epistle to the Hebrews an addendum to the series
of Pauline epistles, although faith does not mean for the writer quite
the same thing as for Paul, p. <a href="#page134">134</a>
<i>sq.</i>&mdash;Paulinism well marked in the ‘Catholic Epistle’ of
Barnabas, p. <a href="#page135">135</a>.&mdash;Ignatius the chief

<h2 class="bold">CHRISTIANITY AND MORALS</h2>
<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>
<h3>RELIGION AND MORALITY</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">C</span><span class="smcap">HRISTIANITY</span> is in the first place a
religion but, as in the case of many other religions, it contains
moral aspects closely connected with the purely religious ones.</p>
<p>The term religion has been used in many different senses, and it is
therefore necessary that I should define what I mean by it. I take
religion in the abstract, so to speak, as distinguished from any
concrete religion, to be a belief in and a regardful attitude towards
a supernatural being, on whom man feels himself dependent and to whom
he makes an appeal in his worship. This definition seems to be in
agreement with the most common usage of the word. It has been
criticised on the ground that it would not apply to genuine Buddhism.
But Buddhism was originally a metaphysical and ethical doctrine, which
was transformed into a religion when the old gods of Brahmanism came
back, when Buddha himself was deified, and Buddhism incorporated most
of the local deities and demons of those nations it sought to
convert.</p>
<p>The belief in supernatural beings is undoubtedly based on a feeling
of uncanniness or mystery. Men distinguish between phenomena that they
are familiar with and consequently ascribe to “natural” causes, and
other phenomena that seem to them unfamiliar and mysterious and are
looked upon as “supernatural,” or are supposed to spring from
“supernatural” causes. We meet with this distinction among savages as
well as civilised races. It may be that in the mind of a savage the
natural and supernatural often overlap, that no definite line can be
drawn between the phenomena which he refers to one class and those
which he refers to the other; but he certainly sees a difference
between events of everyday occurrence or ordinary objects of nature
and other events or objects which fill him with a feeling of wonder or
mysterious <span class="pagenum"><a id="page2"></a>2</span> awe. The
feeling of mystery and the germ of a distinction between the natural
and the supernatural are found even in the lower animal world. The
horse fears the whip, but it does not make him shy; on the other hand,
he may shy when he sees an umbrella opened before him or a paper
moving on the ground. The whip is well known to the horse, whereas the
moving paper or the umbrella is strange, uncanny, let us say
“supernatural.” I had a mule that took no notice of a volley of guns
discharged close to her, because she had been in war and was used to
the sound, whereas she might take fright when she met a goat or saw an
unusually large stone at the side of the road. Dogs and cats are
alarmed by an unusual noise or appearance, and remain uneasy till they
have by examination satisfied themselves of the nature of its cause.<a
name="FnAnchor1" href="#Footnote1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Even
a lion is scared by an unexpected sound or the sight of an unfamiliar
object;<a name="FnAnchor2" href="#Footnote2"><span
class="sp">2</span></a> and we are told of a tiger who stood trembling
and roaring in a paroxysm of fear when a mouse tied by a string to a
stick had been inserted into its cage.<a name="FnAnchor3"
href="#Footnote3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Little children are
apt to be terrified by the strange and irregular movements of a
feather as it glides along the floor or lifts itself into the air.<a

<p>Supernatural qualities are not only attributed to beings who are
able to work wonders at will: the supernatural, like the natural, may
also be looked upon in the light of mechanical energy, which
discharges itself without the aid of any volitional activity. Such
energy is utilised in magic. In religion, man appeals to or worships
supernatural beings by natural means, such as prayers, offerings,
abstinences and so forth; in magic, he attempts to influence either
natural or supernatural objects or persons by supernatural means which
act mechanically and coercively. The religious attitude is in its
nature respectful and humble, the magical attitude is domineering and
self-assertive. At the root of the difference between religion and
magic there is thus a difference in the mental state of the persons
who practise them. So far as religion is concerned, this agrees well
with the notion so forcibly expressed by Schleiermacher, that the
religious feeling is in its essence a feeling of dependence; whereas
the word magician invariably suggests the idea of a person who claims
to possess power and to know how to wield <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page3"></a>3</span> it in the magic art. In order to achieve his
aim he may make use of spirits, but then he coerces them; if he tried
to gain their assistance by propitiation, his attitude would be
religious, not magical.</p>
<p>This view of magic finds support in mediæval conceptions of it. It
is true that the theologians mostly attributed the success of magic to
demons, who were enticed by men to work marvels; but the demons were
able to do so largely through their superior knowledge of the forces
of nature.<a name="FnAnchor5" href="#Footnote5"><span
class="sp">5</span></a> And besides the marvels worked by spirits,
there were others which were produced without their aid, simply by the
wonderful virtues inherent in certain objects of nature. To marvels
wrought in this manner William of Auvergne applied the term “natural
magic.”<a name="FnAnchor6" href="#Footnote6"><span
class="sp">6</span></a> Albertus Magnus likewise associated magic with
natural forces and the stars, as well as with demons;<a
name="FnAnchor7" href="#Footnote7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> and
Thomas Aquinas, though upholding the opinion that magic is due to
demons, gives us a glimpse of a different conception of it, according
to which magicians were able by personal qualifications, by subtle use
of occult natural properties, by rites and ceremonies, and by the art
of astrology, either to work wonders directly and immediately or to
coerce demons to work wonders for them.<a name="FnAnchor8"

<p>Another view concerning the difference between religion and magic
has been expressed by certain writers, from Robertson Smith onwards,
who maintain that religion is social in its aim and magic at any rate
non-social,<a name="FnAnchor9" href="#Footnote9"><span
class="sp">9</span></a> or that magic includes “all bad ways, and
religion all good ways, of dealing with the supernormal, bad and good
as the society concerned judges them.”<a name="FnAnchor10"
href="#Footnote10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> This use of the
terms, however, is not in agreement with the most authoritative
traditional usage. Besides black magic there is also white magic. Even
mediæval theologians distinguished between good and bad magic. William
of Auvergne (†1249), whose works present an unexpectedly detailed
picture of the magic and superstition of his time, sees no harm
whatever in “natural magic,” unless it is employed for evil ends; he
observes that the workers of it are called <i>magi</i>, because they
do great things (<i>magna agentes</i>), whereas others, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page4"></a>4</span> who work magic by the aid
of demons, are to be regarded as evil-doers.<a name="FnAnchor11"
href="#Footnote11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Albertus Magnus
defends the Magi of the gospel story and tries to exculpate them from
the practice of those particular evil, superstitious, and diabolical
occult arts which Isidore and others had included in their definitions
of magic. “They were not devoted to any of these arts,” he says, “but
only to magic as it has been described; and this is praiseworthy.” He
was himself a believer in occult forces and marvels in nature, showed
a leaning to the occult sciences, and was called, even by his
panegyrists, <i>magnus in magia</i> and <i>in magicis expertus</i>.<a
name="FnAnchor12" href="#Footnote12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> In
the <i>Liber aggregationis</i>, a very popular treatise on magic which
has been ascribed to Albertus but is of dubious authenticity, it is
said that magical science (<i>scientia magicalis</i>) is not evil,
since by knowledge of it evil can be avoided and good attained.<a

<p>Nor does the definition according to which magic includes all bad
ways and religion all good ways of dealing with the supernormal seem
to me at all suitable for the purpose of scientific classification. It
implies, for example, that a prayer to a god for the destruction of an
enemy must be classified as religion if it is offered in a cause which
is considered just by the community, but as magic if it is disapproved
of. When a man makes a girl drink a love-potion in order to gain her
favour, it is religion if their union is desirable from the society’s
point of view, but if he gives the same drink to another man’s wife it
is magic. The best part of what has been hitherto called imitative or
homœopathic magic no longer remains magic at all; if water is poured
out for the purpose of producing rain, it is homœopathic magic only in
case rain is not wanted by the community, but if it is done during a
drought it is religion. The acceptance of the view that the very same
practices are religious or magical according as they have social or
anti-social ends would overthrow well-established and useful terms and
deprive us of the comprehensive, convenient, and in every respect
appropriate attribute “magical” for all sorts of supposed impersonal
occult or supernatural forces.</p>
<p>In spite of the essential difference between religion and magic
they have, nevertheless, been connected with each other in various
ways. Owing to the element of mystery which is found in both, magical
forces may be personified as spirits or gods, or be transformed into
divine attributes or lead to divine injunctions; and magical practices
may become genuine acts of religious worship, or acts of worship may
become magical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page5"></a>5</span>
practices. Numerous instances of such transformations have been given
in my book on the <i>Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas</i>.
For example: the magical forces which give efficacy to curses have
been personified as supernatural beings, like the Greek Erinyes of
parents,<a name="FnAnchor14" href="#Footnote14"><span
class="sp">14</span></a> beggars,<a name="FnAnchor15"
href="#Footnote15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> and guests,<a
name="FnAnchor16" href="#Footnote16"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
and the Roman <i>divi parentum</i>,<a name="FnAnchor17"
href="#Footnote17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> <i>dii
hospitales</i>,<a name="FnAnchor18" href="#Footnote18"><span
class="sp">18</span></a> and <i>Terminus</i>;<a name="FnAnchor19"
href="#Footnote19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> or they may be
transformed into attributes of the chief god, as in the case of
Jupiter Terminalis or <span class="transl" title="Zeu\s o(/rios"><i>Ζεὺς ὅριος</i></span>.<a name="FnAnchor20"
href="#Footnote20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> The injurious energy
attributed to work performed on the seventh day developed into a
religious prohibition,<a name="FnAnchor21" href="#Footnote21"><span
class="sp">21</span></a> and the uncanny feeling experienced in
mentioning the name of a supernatural being readily leads to the
belief that he feels offended if his name is pronounced.<a
name="FnAnchor22" href="#Footnote22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
Curses and blessings become prayers;<a name="FnAnchor23"
href="#Footnote23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> and on the other
hand, prayers become spells which are believed to constrain the gods
to whom they are addressed. This appears from the words of many
formulas that are used as magical incantations. Assyrian incantations
are often dressed in the robe of supplication and end with the
formula, “Do so and so, and I shall gladden thine heart and worship
thee in humility.”<a name="FnAnchor24" href="#Footnote24"><span
class="sp">24</span></a> Vedic texts which were not originally meant
as charms became so afterwards. Incantations are comparatively rare in
the Rig-Veda, and seem even to be looked upon as objectionable, but
towards the end of the Vedic period the reign of Brahma, the power of
prayer, as the supreme god in the Indian pantheon began to dawn.<a
name="FnAnchor25" href="#Footnote25"><span class="sp">25</span></a>
The prayer is imbued with supernatural energy owing to the holiness of
the being to whom it is addressed, and its constraining force may then
be directed even against the god himself.</p>

<p>But the connection between religion and magic may be still more
intimate. I have hitherto spoken of religion in the abstract, as
distinguished from any concrete religion. In the popular sense of the
word, which certainly must be respected, a religion may include many
practices which are what I have called magical. In the ancient
religions of the East religion <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page6"></a>6</span> and magic are indissolubly mixed up together.
According to Mohammedan orthodoxy the Arabic words of the Koran work
miracles. The Christian sacraments of baptism and the Eucharist are
rooted in magical ideas, and the efficacy ascribed to them has always
retained a more or less magical character.<a name="FnAnchor26"
href="#Footnote26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> Although the magical
and the strictly religious attitudes differ from each other, they are
not irreconcilable, and may therefore very well form parts of one and
the same religion; there is no such thing as <em>a</em> magic being
opposed to <em>a</em> religion. By a religion is generally understood a
system of beliefs and rules of behaviour which have reference to, or
are considered to be prescribed by, one or several supernatural beings
whom the believers call their god or gods&mdash;that is, supernatural
beings who are the objects of a regular cult and between whom and
their worshippers there are established and permanent relationships.
If it is admitted that the word “religion” may thus be legitimately
used in two different senses, an abstract and a concrete, I think
there is little ground left for further controversy as regards the
relation between religion and magic.</p>

<p>While the origin of religion may be traced to the feeling of
uncanniness and mystery, the moral consciousness has an entirely
different foundation. For a discussion not only of the general
relations between religion and morality, but also of my particular
subject&mdash;the relations between Christianity and morals&mdash;I
find it necessary to give a summary of my views concerning the nature
of the moral consciousness, which I have expounded in detail in
earlier works.<a name="FnAnchor27" href="#Footnote27"><span
class="sp">27</span></a> The reader will notice what a fundamental
position these views occupy in my arguments.</p>

Development of the Moral Ideas</i>, two volumes (London, 1912, 1917),
and <i>Ethical Relativity</i> (London, 1932).</p></div>

<p>All moral concepts, which are used as predicates in moral
judgments, are ultimately based on one or the other of the two
emotions, moral approval and moral disapproval or indignation. Both of
them belong to a wider class of emotions, which I have called
retributive emotions. Moral disapproval is a kind of resentment, by
which I understand a hostile attitude of mind towards a living being
(or something taken for a living being) conceived as a cause of
inflicted pain; moral approval is a retributive kindly emotion, that
is, a friendly attitude of mind towards such a being conceived as a
cause of pleasure. They are related to other kinds of resentment or
retributive kindly emotion: moral disapproval to anger and the feeling
of revenge, and moral approval to gratitude. But the moral emotions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7"></a>7</span> differ from those
non-moral retributive emotions by being disinterested and, at least
within certain limits, impartial. If some one inflicts an injury upon
me, or upon a friend of mine, and I feel indignant in consequence, my
indignation can be called a moral emotion only if it is felt
independently of the fact that it was I or my friend who was hurt; it
must be possible to assume that I should have experienced the same
emotion if another similar person in similar circumstances had been
subjected to the same treatment. Otherwise my emotion of resentment
would have been not moral disapproval, but personal anger. So also,
the kindly emotion which I feel for a benefactor can be called moral
approval only on condition that it is disinterested and impartial;
otherwise it would be personal gratitude.</p>
<p>The origin of retributive emotions may be explained by their
usefulness to the species. Resentment, like protective reflex action,
from which it has gradually developed, is a means of protection for
the animal owing to its tendency to remove a cause of danger. The
disposition to experience it may consequently be regarded as an
element in the animal’s mental constitution that has been acquired
through the influence of natural selection in the struggle for
existence. And as natural selection accounts for the origin of the
disposition to feel resentment, so also it accounts for the origin of
the disposition to feel retributive kindly emotion. Both of these
emotions are useful to the species: by resentment evils are averted,
by retributive kindliness benefits are secured. But retributive
kindliness is of much less frequent occurrence in the animal kingdom
than resentment. In a very large number of species not even the germ
of it is found, and where it occurs it is generally restricted within
narrow limits. Anybody may provoke an animal’s anger, but only towards
certain individuals is it apt to feel retributive kindliness. The
limits for this emotion are marked off by the conditions under which
altruistic sentiments tend to arise. In its primitive form we find it
among animals living in groups, including the small group consisting
of mother, or parents, and offspring. The associated animals take
pleasure in each other’s company, and with this pleasure is intimately
connected kindliness towards its cause, the companion himself, who is
conceived as a friend. The altruistic sentiment would never have come
into existence without such reciprocity of feeling. That there is such
an enormous difference between the prevalence of resentment and that
of retributive kindly emotion is easily explained by the simple fact
that the living in groups is an advantage only to certain species, and
that even gregarious animals have many enemies but few friends.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8"></a>8</span> This explanation
of the origin of resentment and retributive kindly emotion also holds
true of the moral emotions in so far as they are retributive emotions;
it accounts for the hostile attitude of moral disapproval towards the
cause of pain and for the friendly attitude of moral approval towards
the cause of pleasure. But it still remains for us to consider the
origin of those elements in the moral emotions by which they are
distinguished from other, non-moral, retributive emotions. First, how
shall we explain their disinterestedness?</p>
<p>We have to distinguish between different classes of conditions
under which disinterested retributive emotions arise. In the first
place, we may feel disinterested resentment, or disinterested
retributive kindly emotion, on account of an injury inflicted, or a
benefit conferred, upon another individual with whose pain, or
pleasure, we sympathise and in whose welfare we take a kindly
interest. Our retributive emotions are, of course, always reactions
against pain or pleasure felt by ourselves; this holds good of the
moral emotions as well as of anger, revenge, and gratitude. The
question to be answered, then, is, Why should we, quite
disinterestedly, feel pain calling forth disapproval because our
neighbour is hurt, and pleasure calling forth approval because he is
benefited?</p>
<p>That a certain act causes pleasure or pain to the bystander may be
due to the close association that exists between these feelings and
their outward expressions. The sight of a happy face tends to produce
some degree of pleasure in him who sees it; the sight of bodily signs
of suffering tends to produce a feeling of pain. Moreover, sympathetic
pain or pleasure may be the result of an association between cause and
effect, between the cognition of a certain act or situation and the
feeling generally evoked by this act or situation: a blow may cause
pain to the spectator before he has witnessed its effect on the
victim.</p>
<p>But the sympathetic feeling that results from association alone is
not what is popularly called sympathy: it lacks kindliness. Arising
merely from the habitual connection of certain cognitions with certain
feelings in the experience of the spectator, it is, strictly speaking,
not at all concerned with what the other individual <em>feels</em>. On
the other hand sympathy, in the popular sense of the word, requires
the co-operation of the altruistic sentiment or affection, a
disposition of mind that is particularly apt to display itself as
kindly emotion towards other beings. This sentiment, only, induces us
to take a kindly interest in the feelings of our neighbours. It
involves a tendency, or willingness, and, when strongly developed,
gives rise to an eager desire, to sympathise with their pains and
pleasures. But the altruistic <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page9"></a>9</span> sentiment is not merely willingness to
sympathise, it is above all a conative disposition to promote the
welfare of its object. It is true that sympathetic pain, unaided by
kindliness, may induce a person to relieve the suffering of his
neighbour, but then he does so, not out of regard to the feeling of
the sufferer, but simply to get rid of a painful cognition. The sight
of the wounded traveller may perhaps have caused scarcely less pain to
the Pharisee than to the good Samaritan; yet it would have been
impossible for the latter to dismiss his pain by going away, since he
felt a desire to assist the wounded man, and this desire would have
been ungratified if he had not stopped by the wayside.</p>
<p>The co-operation of the altruistic sentiment with sympathy also
produces in us disinterested retributive emotions, when the individual
towards whom we are kindly disposed is hurt or benefited. In the
tendency to feel such emotions, however, there is a great difference
between resentment and retributive kindliness. Resentment towards an
enemy is itself, as a rule, a much stronger emotion than retributive
kindly emotion towards a benefactor. And as for the sympathetic forms
of these emotions, it is not surprising that the altruistic sentiment
is more readily moved by the sight of pain than by the sight of
pleasure, considering that it serves as a means of protection for the
species. Moreover, sympathetic retributive kindliness has powerful
rivals in the feelings of jealousy and envy, which tend to excite
anger also towards him who bestows the benefit on the other
individual. As an ancient writer observes, “many suffer with their
friends when the friends are in distress, but are envious of them when
they prosper.”<a name="FnAnchor28" href="#Footnote28"><span
class="sp">28</span></a> Among the lower animals there seems to be no
trace of retributive kindly emotion felt as a result of pleasure taken
in kindness shown to another individual. On the other hand, there is
sympathetic resentment in consequence of an inflicted injury. A
mammalian mother is as hostile to the enemy of her young as to her own
enemy. Social animals defend members of their own group, which
evidently involves some degree of sympathetic anger. When a young
monkey which had been seized by an eagle cried for assistance, “the
other members of the troupe, with much uproar, rushed to the rescue,
surrounded the eagle, and pulled out so many feathers, that he no
longer thought of his prey, but only how to escape.”<a
name="FnAnchor29" href="#Footnote29"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
Speaking of a group of chimpanzees in confinement, Professor Köhler
says that if one of them was <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page10"></a>10</span> attacked before the eyes of the others,
great excitement went through the whole group; and that even the
lightest form of punishment, such as pulling the ear of the offender,
often stirred single members of the group to much more decisive
action.<a name="FnAnchor30" href="#Footnote30"><span
class="sp">30</span></a> Among domesticated animals sympathetic
resentment may be felt even when the individual who is hurt belongs to
another species. We are told by a trustworthy authority of a dog at
Liverpool who saved a cat from the hands of some young ruffians: he
rushed in among the boys, barked furiously at them, terrified them
into flight, and carried the cat off in his mouth to his kennel, where
he nursed it.<a name="FnAnchor31" href="#Footnote31"><span
class="sp">31</span></a> The dog who flies at any one who strikes, or
even touches, his master is a very familiar instance of sympathetic
resentment.</p>

<p>Among a gregarious species of animals the members of a herd are at
ease in each other’s company, suffer when they are separated, rejoice
when they are reunited, and very frequently display affection by
defending each other, helping each other in distress and danger, and
perform various other services for each other.<a name="FnAnchor32"
href="#Footnote32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> Among men the
members of the same social unit are tied to each other with various
bonds of a distinctly human character&mdash;the same customs, laws,
institutions, magic or religious ceremonies and beliefs, notions of a
common descent, and so forth. As men generally are fond of that to
which they are used or which is their own, they are also naturally apt
to have likings for other individuals whose habits, ideas, and
feelings are similar to theirs. Uncivilised peoples are as a rule
described as kind towards members of their own community or tribe.
Within these limits they are charitable and generous and their customs
relating to mutual aid are often much more stringent than our own; and
this applies even to the very lowest among them.</p>

<p>While disinterested resentment may thus be felt in consequence of
an injury inflicted upon another individual as a reaction against
sympathetic pain, it may also be directly produced by the cognition of
the signs of resentment. In the former case it is really independent
of the emotion of the injured individual; we may feel resentment on
his behalf though he himself feels none. In the latter case it is an
emotion reflected through the medium of its outward expression in
another individual. We are told that among bees, ants, and termites
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page11"></a>11</span> signs of anger felt
by one individual may awaken, the whole community to a high pitch of
excitement.<a name="FnAnchor33" href="#Footnote33"><span
class="sp">33</span></a> A group of the captive chimpanzees studied by
Köhler might be thrown into a state of blind fury by the angry cries
of one of its members, “even when the majority of its members have
seen nothing of what caused the first cry, and have no notion of what
it is all about.”<a name="FnAnchor34" href="#Footnote34"><span
class="sp">34</span></a> When the yells and shrieks of a street
dog-fight are heard, dogs from all sides rush to the spot, each dog
being apparently ready to bite any of the others. So, too, in an
infuriated crowd of men one gets angry because the other is angry, and
often the question Why? is hardly asked. This form of disinterested
resentment is of great importance both as an originator and,
especially, as a communicator of moral ideas; it is, in fact, the main
foundation of moral tradition. Men are inclined to sympathise with the
resentment of persons for whom they feel regard; hence an act which,
though harmless by itself, is forbidden by God and man may be not only
professed but actually felt to be wrong. The punishment inflicted by
the society, which as a rule is an expression of its moral
indignation, may also, by arousing such a feeling, lead to the idea
that it deserves to be punished. Children, as everybody knows, grow up
with their ideas of right and wrong graduated, to a great extent,
according to the temper of the father or mother; and men are not
seldom, as Hobbes said, “like little children, that have no other rule
of good and evill manners, but the correction they receive from their
Parents and Masters.”<a name="FnAnchor35" href="#Footnote35"><span
class="sp">35</span></a> Any means of expressing resentment may serve
as a communicator of the emotion. Besides punishment, language
deserves special mention. Moral disapproval may be evoked by the very
sounds of words like “murder,” “theft,” “cowardice,” and others, which
not merely indicate a certain mode of behaviour but also express the
opprobrium attached to it. By the use of some strong word the orator
raises the indignation of a sympathetic audience to its pitch.</p>

<p>There is yet a third way in which disinterested resentment may
arise. In many cases people feel hostile to a person who inflicts no
injury on anybody. There are in the human mind what Bain called
“disinterested antipathies,” or sentimental aversions, “of which our
fellow-beings are the subjects, and on account of which we overlook
our own interest as much as in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page12"></a>12</span> displaying our sympathies and affections.”<a
name="FnAnchor36" href="#Footnote36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
Differences of taste, habit, and, opinion easily create similar
dislikes; and these, too, have played a prominent part in the moulding
of the moral consciousness. The antipathy which is so commonly felt
against anything unusual, new, or foreign, may lead to the idea that
it is wrong; and when a certain act which does no harm&mdash;apart
from the painful impression it makes on the spectator&mdash;fills
people with disgust or horror, they may feel no less inclined to
inflict harm upon the agent than if he had committed an offence
against person, property, or good name. Such resentment may also arise
from the observation of the feelings of others. As Abraham Tucker
said, “we grow to love things we perceive them fond of, and contract
aversions from their dislikes.”<a name="FnAnchor37"

<p>We have already noticed that sympathy, in the popular sense of the
word, may produce not only disinterested resentment but disinterested
retributive kindliness as well: when taking a pleasure in the benefit
bestowed upon our neighbour we are disposed to look with kindness on
the benefactor. Moreover, as resentment may be produced by the
cognition of outward signs of resentment in others, so kindly emotion
may be produced by the signs of kindliness. Even a dog may be
well-disposed towards a stranger when he sees a friend&mdash;whether a
man or another dog&mdash;be friendly to him. Language communicates
emotions by terms of praise as well as by terms of condemnation; and a
reward, like a punishment, has some tendency to reproduce the emotion
from which it sprang. Finally, men have disinterested likings as they
have disinterested dislikes. As an instance of these may be mentioned
the common admiration of courage when felt irrespectively of the
object for which it is displayed&mdash;a feeling which has even
elevated it to an independent virtue, and in any case tends to
influence the moral verdict.</p>
<p>Having found the origin of disinterested retributive emotions, we
have also partly explained the origin of the moral emotions. But, as
we have seen, these emotions are not only disinterested, they are also
impartial in a wider sense. The possibility of such impartiality,
however, is explained by the answer to the more general question, how
disinterestedness and a certain degree of impartiality have become
characteristics of that particular kind of retributive emotions that
we call moral emotions. The solution of this problem is not difficult
to find. It lies in the fact that society is the birth-place of the
moral <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13"></a>13</span>
consciousness; that the first moral judgments expressed not the
private emotions of isolated individuals, but emotions felt by the
society at large; that tribal custom was the earliest rule of
duty.</p>
<p>Customs are not merely public habits&mdash;the habits of a certain
circle of men, a racial or national community, a rank or class of
society&mdash;but they are at the same time rules of conduct. As
Cicero observes, the customs of a people “are precepts in
themselves.”<a name="FnAnchor38" href="#Footnote38"><span
class="sp">38</span></a> We say that “custom commands” or “custom
demands,” and even when custom simply allows the commission of a
certain class of actions, it implicitly lays down the rule that such
actions are not to be interfered with. And the rule of custom is
conceived of as a moral rule which decides what is right and wrong.
The Greek idea of the customary, <span class="transl" title="to\ no/mimon"><i>τὸ νόμιμον</i></span>, shows the
close connection between morality and custom; and so do the words
<span class="transl" title="e)/thos, e)=thos"><i>ἔθος</i>, <i>ἦθος</i></span>, and <span class="transl" title="ê)thika/"><i>ἠθικά</i></span>, the Latin <i>mos</i>
and <i>moralis</i> the German <i>Sitte</i> and <i>Sittlichkeit</i>.
Moreover, in early society customs are not only moral rules but the
only moral rules ever thought of. The savage strictly complies with
the Hegelian command that no man must have a private conscience.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote38"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor38"><sup>38</sup></a></span> Cicero, <i>De
officiis</i>, i. 41.</p></div>

<p>What does it mean that custom is a rule of conduct? It implies that
every deviation from custom is apt to call forth public disapproval.
In the lower stages of civilisation, especially, custom is a tyrant
who binds man in iron fetters, and who threatens the transgressor not
only with general disgrace, but often with bodily suffering or even
death. In its ethical aspect custom is nothing but a generalisation of
emotional tendencies, applied to certain modes of conduct and
transmitted from generation to generation. Now if custom is a moral
rule, the public disapproval aroused by its transgression may be
properly called a moral emotion. Moreover, where all the duties of a
man are expressed in the customs of the society to which he belongs,
the characteristics of moral disapproval are naturally to be sought
for in its connection with custom. Custom is fixed once for all, and
admits of no purely individual preferences. It is equally binding for
me and for you and for all the other members of the society. A breach
of it is equally wrong whether I myself am immediately concerned in
the act or not; this involves disinterestedness. So also the
condemnation of it is independent of the relationship in which the
parties concerned in it stand to me personally; this implies
impartiality in a larger sense. And all this holds true whatever be
the origin of any particular custom. It may have originated in
selfishness <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14"></a>14</span> or
partiality; the leading men of the society may at first have
prohibited certain acts because they found them disadvantageous to
themselves or to the class of people with whom they particularly
sympathised. Where custom is an oppressor of women, this oppression
may, in some measure at least, be traced back to the selfishness of
the men. Where custom sanctions slavery, it is certainly not impartial
to the slaves. Yet in one case as in the other custom is assumed to be
in the right, irrespectively of one’s own station, and the women and
the slaves themselves are expected to be of the same opinion. Such an
expectation is by no means a chimera.<a name="FnAnchor39"
href="#Footnote39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> Under stable social
conditions, largely owing to men’s tendency to share the resentment of
their superiors, the customs of a society are willingly submitted to
and recognised as right by the great majority of its members, whatever
be their station.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote39"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor39"><sup>39</sup></a></span> For instances of this see
my <i>Ethical Relativity</i>, p. 111.</p></div>

<p>As public disapproval is the prototype of moral disapproval, so is
public approval, expressed in public praise, the prototype of moral
approval: it is characterised by the same disinterestedness and
impartiality. But of the two emotions public disapproval, being at the
root of custom and leading to the infliction of punishment, is by far
the more impressive. Hence it is not surprising that the term “moral”
is etymologically connected with <i>mos</i>, which always implies the
existence of a social rule the transgression of which evokes public
disapproval. Only by analogy has it come to be applied to the emotion
of approval as well.</p>
<p>Though moral disapproval and approval have taken their place in the
system of human emotions as public emotions felt by the society at
large, they have not always remained inseparably connected with the
feelings of any special society. The unanimity of opinion that
originally characterised the members of the same social unit was
disturbed by its advancement in civilisation. Individuals arose who
found fault with the moral ideas prevalent in the community to which
they belonged, criticising them on the basis of their own individual
feelings. To deny such individuals the right of speaking in the name
of morality true and proper would be to attach to this term a meaning
which, in its narrowness, would be utterly different from the
established usage of it. All that is required is that their
retributive emotions should possess that disinterestedness and
impartiality which have become moral characteristics in connection
with custom, but may differ from public approval and disapproval
either in intensity or with regard to the facts by which they are
evoked. Indeed, the dissent from <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page15"></a>15</span> the orthodox views of morality often arises
from the conviction that the apparent impartiality of public feelings
is an illusion. In the course of progressive civilisation the moral
consciousness has tended towards a greater equalisation of rights,
towards an expansion of the circle within which the same moral rules
are applicable. And this process has been largely due to the example
of influential individuals and their efforts to raise public opinion
to their own standard of right.</p>
<p>My earlier statement that the predicates of all moral judgments are
ultimately based on moral emotions by no means implies that such a
judgment affirms the existence of a moral emotion in the mind of the
person who utters it: he may do so without feeling any emotion at all.
No doubt, to say that a certain act is good or bad may be the mere
expression of an emotion felt with regard to it, just as to say that
the sun is hot and the weather cold may be the mere expression of a
sensation of heat or cold produced by the sun or the weather. But such
judgments express subjective facts in terms which strictly speaking
have a different meaning. To attribute a quality to something is not
the same as to state the existence of a particular emotion or
sensation in the mind that perceives it. This, however, does not imply
that the term used to denote the quality may not have a subjective
origin. I maintain, on the contrary, that the qualities assigned to
the subjects of moral judgments really are generalisations derived
from approval or disapproval felt with regard to certain modes of
conduct, that they are tendencies to feel one or the other of these
emotions interpreted as qualities, as dynamic tendencies, in the
phenomena which gave rise to the emotion. A similar translation of
emotional states into terms of qualities assigned to external
phenomena is found in many other cases: something is “fearful” because
people fear it, “admirable” because people admire it. When we call an
act good or bad, we do not <em>state</em> the existence of any emotional
tendencies, any more than, when we call a landscape beautiful, we
state any characteristics of beauty: we refer the subject of the
judgment to a class of phenomena which we are used to call good or
bad. But we are used to call them so because they have evoked moral
approval in ourselves or in other persons from whom we have learnt the
use of those words.</p>
<p>Most people follow a very simple method in judging of an act.
Particular modes of conduct have their traditional labels, many of
which are learnt with language itself; and the moral judgment commonly
consists simply in labelling the act according to certain obvious
characteristics which it presents in common with others belonging to
the same group. We hear <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page16"></a>16</span> that some one has appropriated another’s
property, this is theft, it is wrong; some one tells an untruth, this
is lying, it is wrong; some one gives money to a needy person, this is
charity, it is good; and so forth. But when we examine the nature of
these acts we find that they are apt to give rise to or, as we may
also put it, to become the objects of, certain emotions, either of
disapproval or approval, and it is the tendency to feel one or the
other of these emotions that has led people to call them bad or good.
Those who first established the use of these and all other moral
concepts felt disapproval or approval and expressed in the concepts
their tendency to feel such an emotion in the given circumstances.
This is what may be called the intrinsic meaning of the terms. I do
not say that those who use them are aware of this meaning. We are
often unable to tell what is really implied in a concept that we
predicate to a certain phenomenon. When any one is asked what he means
by saying that something is or exists, or that something is the cause
of something else, I suppose that everybody who is not a philosopher,
and even many a philosopher, feels somewhat bewildered. If we want to
find out the intrinsic meaning of a term we have to examine the
circumstances in which it is used. And in analysing the predicates of
moral judgments, we are guided by the fact that if we ourselves
emphatically and truly mean what we say when we pronounce such a
judgment, we recognise that we are apt, or at least think we are apt,
to feel a moral emotion of either approval or disapproval with regard
to that on which the judgment is pronounced.</p>
<p>In order to show that the concepts which are used as predicates in
moral judgments are ultimately based upon emotions it is necessary to
examine the relations between the concepts and the emotions. This is a
task which has been much neglected by the moralists of the emotional
school, from Adam Smith to McDougall, although it is evidently a
matter of paramount importance. I have undertaken it in my earlier
works, and shall now only give a brief summary of my views. The import
of the moral concepts is not a topic that requires, for the right
understanding of the main subject of my book, as detailed a treatment
as the nature of the emotions underlying them.</p>
<p>Moral disapproval has led to the concepts of ought and duty, right
and wrong, justice and injustice. Every “ought”-judgment contains
implicitly a prohibition of that which ought <em>not</em> to be done.
Nobody would ever have dreamt of laying down a moral rule if the idea
of its transgression had not presented itself to his mind. We may
reverse the words of the Apostle and say that where no transgression
is, there is no law; <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page17"></a>17</span> the law-breaker is, in a way, the law-maker.
When Solon was asked why he had specified no punishment for one who
had murdered his father, he replied that he supposed it could not
occur to any man to commit such a crime.<a name="FnAnchor40"
href="#Footnote40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> We may certainly
applaud him who is faithful to his duty in circumstances where the
average man would have felt a strong temptation to yield to a contrary
impulse. There is no contradiction in the omission of an act being
disapproved of and the performance of it being praised; but “ought”
and “duty” only express the tendency of an act’s omission to call
forth moral disapproval and say nothing about the consequences of its
performance. The tendency in a phenomenon to arouse moral disapproval
is directly expressed by the terms “bad” and “wrong.”</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote40"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor40"><sup>40</sup></a></span> Diogenes Laertius,
<i>Solon</i>, 10; Cicero, <i>Pro S. Roscio Amerino</i>, 25.</p></div>

<p>“Right” is what is in conformity to duty, unless this term is
simply used to point out that something is “not wrong.” And like the
adjective “right” is also the substantive denoting “a right” rooted in
the emotion of moral disapproval. To have a right to do a thing is to
be allowed to do it, either by positive law, in the case of a legal
right, or by the moral law, in the case of a moral right; in other
words, to have a moral right to do a thing implies that it is not
wrong to do it. But generally the concept of “a right” means something
more than this. From the fact that an act is allowable follows, as a
rule, that it ought not to be prevented; and this character of
inviolability is largely included in the very concepts of rights. That
a man has a right to live does not merely mean that he commits no
wrong by supporting his life, but it chiefly means that it would be
wrong of other people to prevent him from living, that it is their
duty to refrain from killing him, or even, as the case may be, that it
is their duty to help him to live.</p>
<p>Closely connected with the notions of wrongness and rightness are
the notions of injustice and justice. “Injustice” implies a violation
of some one’s right; “justice,” in the strict sense of the term,
involves the notion that a duty to somebody, a duty corresponding to a
right in him, is fulfilled. But at the same time “injustice” and
“justice” are not simply other names for violating or respecting
rights. When we style an act “unjust” we emphasise that it is not
impartial, when we style an act “just” we point out that an undue
preference would have been shown some one by its omission. It is the
emphasis laid on the duty of impartiality that gives justice a special
prominence in connection with punishments and rewards. A man’s rights
depend to a great extent upon his actions. Other things being equal,
the criminal has not the same rights to <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page18"></a>18</span> inviolability as regards reputation,
freedom, property, or life as the innocent man; the miser and the
egoist have not the same rights as the benefactor and the
philanthropist. On these differences in rights, due to differences in
conduct, the terms “just” and “unjust” lay stress; for in such cases
an injustice would have been committed if the rights had been equal.
When we say of a criminal that he has been “justly” imprisoned, we
point out that he was no victim to undue partiality, as he had
forfeited the general right to freedom on account of his crime. When
we say of a benefactor that he has been “justly” rewarded, we point
out that no favour was partially bestowed upon him in preference to
others, as he had acquired the special right of being rewarded. But
the “justice” of a punishment or a reward, strictly speaking, involves
something more than this; as we have seen, what is strictly just is
always the discharge of a duty corresponding to a right that would
have been in a partial manner disregarded by a transgression of the
duty. If it is just that a person should be rewarded he ought to be
rewarded, and to fulfil this duty is to do him justice. Again, if it
is just that a person should be punished he ought to be punished, and
his not being punished is an injustice towards all those whose
condemnation of the wrong act finds its recognised expression in the
punishment, inasmuch as their rightful claim that the criminal should
be punished, their right of resisting wrong, is thereby violated in
favour of the wrongdoer. Moreover, his not being punished is an
injustice towards other criminals, who have been, or who will be,
punished for similar acts, in so far as they have a right to demand
that no undue preference should be shown anybody whose guilt is equal
to theirs. Retributive punishment may admit of a certain latitude as
to the retribution. It may be a matter of small concern from the
community’s point of view whether men are fined or imprisoned for the
commission of a certain crime. But justice demands that in equal
circumstances all of them should be punished with the same severity,
since the crime has equally affected their rights. The emphasis which
“injustice” lays on the partiality of a certain mode of conduct always
involves a condemnation of that partiality, and is thus a concept that
is obviously based on the emotion of moral disapproval. And so is the
concept of “justice,” whether it involves the notion that an injustice
would be committed if a certain duty is not fulfilled, or it is used,
more loosely, to denote that a certain course of conduct is “not
unjust.” But the word “just” may also emphasise the impartiality of an
act in a tone of praise. Considering how difficult it may be to be
perfectly impartial <span class="pagenum"><a id="page19"></a>19</span>
and give every man his due, especially when one’s own interests are
concerned, it is only natural that men may be applauded for being
just, and, consequently, that to call a person “just” may be to praise
him. So also, “justice” is used as the name for a virtue, “the
mistress and queen of all virtues.”<a name="FnAnchor41"
href="#Footnote41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> But all this does
not imply that an emotion of moral approval enters into the concept of
justice as such. It only means that one word is used to express a
certain concept, which ultimately derives its import from moral
disapproval, and in addition an emotion of approval. That the concept
of justice by itself has no reference to the emotion of approval is
shown by the fact that it is no praise to say of an act that it is
“only just.”</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote41"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor41"><sup>41</sup></a></span> Cicero, <i>De
officiis</i>, iii. 6.</p></div>

<p>From the concepts springing from moral disapproval we shall pass to
those springing from moral approval. Foremost among these ranks the
concept of goodness. The word “good” is applied to a great variety of
objects. But whatever all other good things may have in common,
“goodness,” in the emphatically moral sense of the word has a
characteristic of its own, which makes it widely different from any
other “good”: it is a concept rooted in the tendency to feel the
emotion of moral approval, it is the general expression for moral
praise. The word “virtue,” again, is usually applied to denote a
disposition of mind characterised by some special kind of goodness. He
who is habitually temperate possesses the virtue of temperance, he who
is habitually brave the virtue of courage, he who is habitually
generous the virtue of generosity. Even when a man is simply said to
be “virtuous,” this epithet is given him, more or less distinctly,
with reference to some kind or kinds of goodness: it may mean that he
has many virtues, or that he has much of one. A Supreme Being who is
regarded as all-good is not called virtuous.</p>
<p>Like the notions of goodness and virtue, the “meritorious” derives
its origin from the emotion of moral approval; but while the former
merely express a tendency to give rise to such an emotion, the
“meritorious” implies that the object to which it refers “merits”
praise, that it has a just claim to praise, in other words, that it
ought to be recognised as good. This makes the term “meritorious” more
emphatic than the term “good,” but at the same time it narrows its
province in a peculiar way. Just as the expression that something
ought to be done implies the idea that it possibly may not be done, so
the statement that something is meritorious, in pointing out its
goodness, implies <span class="pagenum"><a id="page20"></a>20</span>
the idea that this goodness may fail to receive due recognition. It
would be blasphemous to call the acts of a God who is conceived to be
infinitely good “meritorious,” since it would suggest a thinkable
limitation of his goodness.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>
<h3>RELIGION AND MORALITY (<i>concluded</i>)</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="smcap">HE</span> gods of uncivilised peoples are to a
large extent of a malevolent character, but they are not exclusively
so; and though they as a rule take little interest in any kind of
human conduct that does not affect their own welfare, some of them are
also opposed to acts of ordinary wrongdoing. Among peoples of a higher
culture, again, the gods are on the whole benevolent to mankind when
duly propitiated. They resent by preference offences committed against
themselves personally; but in many cases they at the same time avenge
social wrongs of various kinds, act as superintendents of human
justice, and are even looked upon as the originators and sustainers of
the whole moral order of the world. The gods have thus experienced a
gradual change for the better; until at last they are described as
ideals of moral perfection, even though, when more closely
scrutinised, their goodness and notions of justice are found to differ
materially from what is deemed good and just in the case of men.<a
name="FnAnchor42" href="#Footnote42"><span
class="sp">42</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote42"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor42"><sup>42</sup></a></span> See my book <i>The Origin
und Development of the Moral Ideas</i>, ii (London, 1917), ch. l
<i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>The malevolence of savage gods is in accordance with the theory
that religion is born of fear. The assumed originators of misfortunes
were naturally regarded as enemies to be propitiated; while fortunate
events, if attracting sufficient attention and appearing sufficiently
marvellous to suggest a supernatural cause, were commonly ascribed to
beings who were too good to require worship. But growing reflection
has a tendency to attribute more amiable qualities to the gods. The
religious consciousness of men becomes less exclusively occupied with
the hurts they suffer, and comes more and more to reflect upon the
benefits they enjoy. The activity of a god which displays itself in a
certain phenomenon, or group of phenomena, appears to them on some
occasions as a source of evil, but on other occasions as a source of
good; hence the god is regarded as partly malevolent, partly
benevolent, and in all circumstances as a being who must not be
neglected. Moreover, a god who is by nature harmless or good may by
proper worship be induced <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page22"></a>22</span> to assist man in his struggle against evil
spirits. The protective function of nature gods becomes particularly
important when the god is humanised also with regard to his shape, and
consequently more or less dissociated from the natural phenomenon in
which he originally manifested himself. Nothing, indeed, seems to have
contributed more to the improvement of nature gods than the expansion
of their sphere of activity. When supernatural beings can exert their
power in the various departments of life, men naturally choose for
their gods those among them who with great power combine the greatest
benevolence.</p>
<p>Men have selected their gods according to their usefulness. We have
many direct instances of such “supernatural selection.” Among the
Maori “a mere trifle, or natural casualty, will induce a native (or a
whole tribe) to change his Atua.”<a name="FnAnchor43"
href="#Footnote43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> The negro, when
disappointed in some of his speculations, or overtaken by some sad
calamity, throws away his fetish, and selects a new one.<a
name="FnAnchor44" href="#Footnote44"><span class="sp">44</span></a>
When hard-pressed the Samoyed, after having invoked his own deities in
vain, addresses himself to the Russian god, promising to become his
worshipper if he relieves him from his distress; and in most cases he
is said to be faithful to his promise, though he may still try to keep
on good terms with his former gods by occasionally offering them a
sacrifice in secret.<a name="FnAnchor45" href="#Footnote45"><span
class="sp">45</span></a> North American Indians attribute all their
good or bad luck to their Manitou, and “if the Manitou has not been
favourable to them, they quit him without any ceremony, and take
another.”<a name="FnAnchor46" href="#Footnote46"><span
class="sp">46</span></a> Among many of the Indians of Central America
there was a regular and systematic selection of gods. Father Blas
Valera says that their gods had annual rotations and were changed each
year in accordance with the superstitions of the people. “The old gods
were forsaken as infamous, or because they had been of no use, and
other gods and demons were elected. . . . Sons when they inherited
either accepted or repudiated the gods of their fathers, for they were
not allowed to hold their pre-eminence against the will of their heir.
Old men worshipped other greater deities, but they likewise dethroned
them, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page23"></a>23</span> set up
others in their places when the year was over. . . . Such were the
gods which all the nations of Mexico, Chiapa, and Guatemala
worshipped, as well as those of Vera Paz, and many other Indians. They
thought that the gods selected by themselves were the greatest and
most powerful of all the gods.”<a name="FnAnchor47"
href="#Footnote47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> These are crude
instances of a process which in some form or other must have been an
important motive force in religious evolution by making the gods
better suited to meet the wants of their believers. We find traces of
it even in the Old Testament. “Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will
be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me
bread to eat, and raiment to put on, So that I come again to my
father’s house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: And this
stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all
that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.”<a
name="FnAnchor48" href="#Footnote48"><span class="sp">48</span></a>
The Hebrews thought of the national religion as constituted by a
covenant rite in which the parties were Yahve and Abraham,<a
name="FnAnchor49" href="#Footnote49"><span class="sp">49</span></a> as
also by a formal covenant sacrifice at Mount Sinai, where half of the
blood of the sacrificed oxen was sprinkled on the altar and the other
half on the people;<a name="FnAnchor50" href="#Footnote50"><span
class="sp">50</span></a> and the idea of sacrifice establishing a
covenant between God and man is also apparent in the Psalms.<a
name="FnAnchor51" href="#Footnote51"><span class="sp">51</span></a>
Robertson Smith and his followers have represented the covenant
practices as acts of communion,<a name="FnAnchor52"
href="#Footnote52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> but similar methods
of covenanting, which I have found in Morocco, have led me to believe
that those employed by the ancient Hebrews in covenanting with the
deity aimed at transferring conditional curses both to the men and to
their god.<a name="FnAnchor53" href="#Footnote53"><span
class="sp">53</span></a> Such covenanting naturally presupposed a kind
of selection.</p>

<p>Men not only select as their gods such supernatural beings as may
be most useful to them in the struggle for life, but also magnify
their good qualities in worshipping them. Praise and exaggerating
eulogy are common in the mouth of a devout worshipper. In ancient
Egypt the god of each petty state was within it said to be the ruler
of the gods, the creator of the world, the giver of all good things.<a
name="FnAnchor54" href="#Footnote54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> So
also in Chaldea the god of a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page24"></a>24</span> town was addressed by its inhabitants with
the most exalted epithets, as the master or king of all the gods.<a
name="FnAnchor55" href="#Footnote55"><span class="sp">55</span></a>
The Vedic poets were engrossed in the praise of the particular deity
they happened to be invoking, magnifying his attributes to the point
of inconsistency.<a name="FnAnchor56" href="#Footnote56"><span
class="sp">56</span></a> The Hindus say that by praise a person may
obtain from the gods whatever he desires.<a name="FnAnchor57"
href="#Footnote57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> There is a Chinese
story that amusingly illustrates this little weakness of so many gods.
At the hottest season of the year there was a heavy fall of snow at
Soochow. The people, in their consternation, went to the temple of the
Great Prince to pray. Then the spirit moved one of them to say: “You
now address me as Your Honour. Make it Your Excellency, and, though I
am but a lesser deity, it may be well worth your while to do so.”
Thereupon the people began to use the latter term, and the snow
stopped at once.<a name="FnAnchor58" href="#Footnote58"><span
class="sp">58</span></a> “Every virtue, every excellence,” says Hume,
“must be ascribed to the divinity, and no exaggeration will be deemed
sufficient to reach those perfections with which he is endowed.”<a
name="FnAnchor59" href="#Footnote59"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
But though the tendency of the worshipper to extol his god beyond all
measure is largely due to the idea that praise or flattery is as
pleasant to superhuman as to human ears, it may also be rooted in a
sincere will to believe or in genuine veneration. That nations of a
higher culture, especially, have a strong faith in the power and
benevolence of their gods, is easy to understand when we consider that
such peoples have been most successful in their national endeavours.
As the Greeks attributed their victory over the Persians to the
assistance of Zeus, so the Romans maintained that the grandeur of
their city was the work of the gods whom they had propitiated by
sacrifices.<a name="FnAnchor60" href="#Footnote60"><span

<p>The benevolence of a god, however, does not imply that he acts as a
moral judge. A friendly god is not generally supposed to bestow his
favours gratuitously; it is therefore not a matter of course that he
should meddle with social morality out of sheer kindliness and of his
own accord. But by an invocation he may be induced to reward virtue
and punish vice. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page25"></a>25</span>
The retributive activity of many gods is evidently very closely
connected with the blessings and curses of men. In order to actualise
their good or evil wishes men appeal to a supernatural being, or
simply bring in his name to give their appeal that mystic efficacy
which the plain word lacks; and if this is regularly done in
connection with some particular kind of conduct, the idea may grow up
that the supernatural being rewards or punishes it even independently
of any human invocation. In Morocco the very patron saint of a village
is expressly said not to care about the behaviour of its inhabitants
outside the precincts of his sanctuary; yet I found that some
particular saints not only resent theft committed at their own
shrines, but also punish robbers who merely pass by, either preventing
them from proceeding further until they are caught, or making it
impossible for them to sell the stolen object, so that they are found
out at last. In these cases their hostility to an offence which does
not concern them personally is obviously due to the fact that those
saints have been so often appealed to in oaths taken by persons
suspected of theft that they have at last come to be looked upon as
permanent enemies of thieves and guardians of property. At Fez there
are certain saints who are said to be so much opposed to wrongdoers
that they do not even suffer them to live in the neighbourhood of
their shrines, and these saints are exactly those by whom it is
considered most dangerous to swear; hence I assume that they have
acquired their remarkable moral sensitiveness just by being such
severe avengers of perjury.</p>
<p>Moreover, as I have pointed out before, the magical forces which
give efficacy to curses may be personified as supernatural beings or
may be transformed into attributes of the chief god. Various
departments of social morality have thus come to be placed under the
supervision of gods&mdash;such as charity, hospitality, the right of
property, and the submissiveness of children. Gods are also frequently
looked upon as guardians of truth and good faith, which I take to be
mainly due to the common practice of confirming a statement or promise
by an oath. A god is not only more powerful than ordinary mortals, but
may also better know whether the sworn word be true or false; it is no
doubt on account of their superior knowledge that sun or moon or light
gods are by preference appealed to in oaths.<a name="FnAnchor61"
href="#Footnote61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> Owing to its
invocation of supernatural sanction, perjury is considered the most
heinous of all acts of falsehood, but it has a tendency to make even
the ordinary lie or breach of faith a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page26"></a>26</span> matter of religious concern. If a god is
frequently appealed to in oaths, a general hatred of lying and
faithlessness may become one of his attributes. There is every reason
to believe that a god is not, in the first place, appealed to because
he is looked upon as a guardian of veracity and good faith, but that
he has come to be looked upon as a guardian of these duties because he
has so often been appealed to in connection with them.</p>

<p>Where the oath is an essential element in the judicial proceedings,
as it was in the archaic State, the consequence is that the
guardianship of gods is extended to the whole sphere of justice. Truth
and justice are repeatedly mentioned hand in hand as matters of divine
concern, and the same gods as are appealed to in oaths or ordeals are
also frequently described as judges of human conduct.<a

<p>We have still to consider another set of facts that have tended to
make gods moral specialists. In the case of homicide the notion of a
persecuting ghost may be replaced by an avenging god. Confusions are
common in the world of mystery; doings or functions attributed to one
being may be transferred to another. Among some North American
Indians, though the revengeful ghost of the murdered man was not lost
sight of, the deed was at the same time looked upon as offensive to
Wakanda, “the Great Spirit”; no one wished to eat with the murderer;
they said: “If we eat with the man whom Wakanda hates for his crime,
Wakanda will hate us.”<a name="FnAnchor66" href="#Footnote66"><span
class="sp">66</span></a> In the Chinese books there are numerous
instances of persons haunted by the souls of their victims on their
death-bed, and in most of these cases the ghosts state expressly that
they are avenging themselves with the special authorisation of
Heaven.<a name="FnAnchor67" href="#Footnote67"><span
class="sp">67</span></a> The Greek belief in the Erinyes of a murdered
man originated no doubt in the earlier notion of a persecuting ghost,
whose anger or curses in later times were personified as an
independent spirit.<a name="FnAnchor68" href="#Footnote68"><span
class="sp">68</span></a> And <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page27"></a>27</span> the transformation went further still: the
Erinyes were represented as the ministers of Zeus, who by punishing
the murderer carried out his divine will. Zeus was considered the
originator of the rites of purification; at his altar Theseus
underwent purification for the shedding of kindred blood.<a
name="FnAnchor69" href="#Footnote69"><span class="sp">69</span></a>
The ritual uncleanness ascribed to a manslayer was thus transformed
into spiritual impurity.</p>

<p>It has been said that when men ascribe to their gods a mental
constitution similar to their own they <i>eo ipso</i> consider them to
approve of virtue and disapprove of vice.<a name="FnAnchor70"
href="#Footnote70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> But this conclusion
is certainly not true in general. Malevolent gods cannot be supposed
to feel emotions that essentially presuppose altruistic sentiments,
and, as already said, an invocation may be required to induce a
benevolent god to interfere with the worldly affairs of men. Moreover,
where the system of private retaliation prevails, not even the
extension of human analogies to the world of supernatural beings would
lead to the idea of a god who of his own accord punishes social
wrongs. But it is quite probable that such analogies have in some
cases made gods guardians of morality at large, especially ancestor
gods. These may readily be supposed not only to preserve their old
feelings with regard to virtue and vice, but also to take a more
active interest in the morals of the living; and they are notoriously
opposed to any deviation from ancient custom. I also admit that the
conception of a great or supreme god may perhaps, independently of his
origin, involve retributive justice as a natural consequence of his
power and benevolence towards his people. Yet it is obvious that even
a god like Zeus was more influenced by the invocation of a suppliant
than by his sense of justice. Farnell points out that the epithets
which designate him as the god to whom those stricken with guilt can
appeal are far more in vogue in actual Greek cult than those which
attribute to him the function of vengeance and retribution.<a

sultan of all the saints, Mûlai ʿAbdlqâder, has the epithet “the
patron of liars,” and is said to be compelled to assist thieves and

behaviour. The Italian bandit begs the Virgin herself to bless his
endeavours.</p>

<p>At the same time we must again remember that men ascribe to their
gods not only ordinary human qualities but excellences of various
kinds, and among these may also be a strong desire to punish
wickedness and to reward virtue. The gods of monotheistic religions in
particular have such a multitude of the most elevated attributes that
it would be astonishing if they had remained unconcerned about the
morals of mankind. If flattery or genuine veneration makes the deity
all-wise, all-powerful, all-good, they also make him the supreme judge
of human conduct. And there is yet another reason for investing him
with the moral government of the world. The claims of justice are not
fully satisfied on this earth, where it only too often happens that
virtue is left unrewarded and vice escapes unpunished, that right
succumbs and wrong triumphs; hence persons with deep moral feelings
and a religious or philosophical bent of mind are apt to look for a
future adjustment through the intervention of the deity, who alone can
repair the evils and injustices of the present. This demand of final
retribution is sometimes so strongly developed, that it even leads to
the belief in a deity when no other proof of his existence is found
convincing. Kant maintained that, since an accurate correspondence
between happiness and moral worth is not to be expected in a mere
course of nature, we postulate a moral and all-powerful Supreme Being
who establishes such correspondence. Not even Voltaire could rid
himself of the notion of a rewarding and avenging deity, whom, if he
did not exist, “it would be necessary to invent.”</p>
<p>The belief in a god who acts as a guardian of worldly morality
undoubtedly gives emphasis to its rules. To the social and legal
sanctions a new one is added, which derives particular strength from
the supernatural power and knowledge of the deity. The divine avenger
can punish those who are beyond the reach of human justice and those
whose secret wrongs even escape the censure of their fellow-men. But
on the other hand, there are also certain circumstances which detract
considerably from the influence of the religious sanction when
compared with other sanctions of morality. The supposed punishments
and rewards of the future life have the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page29"></a>29</span> disadvantage of being conceived as very
remote; and fear and hope decrease in inverse ratio to the distance of
their objects. Men commonly live in the happy illusion that death is
far off, even though it is in reality very near, and, therefore, the
retribution after death also appears distant and unreal and is
comparatively little thought of by the majority of people who believe
in it. Moreover, there seems to be time left for penance and
repentance. Manzoni himself admitted, in his defence of Roman
Catholicism, that many men think it an easy matter to procure that
feeling of contrition by which, according to the doctrine of the
Church, sins may be cancelled, and therefore encourage themselves in
the commission of crime through the facility of pardon. The frequent
assumption that the moral law would scarcely command obedience without
the belief in retribution beyond the grave is contradicted by an
overwhelming array of facts. We hear from trustworthy witnesses that
unadulterated savages follow their own rules of morality no less
strictly, or perhaps more strictly, than civilised people follow
theirs. Nay, it is a common experience that contact with a higher
civilisation exercises a deteriorating moral influence upon the
conduct of uncultured races, although we may be sure that Christian
missionaries do not fail to impart the doctrine of hell to their
savage converts.</p>
<p>It has also been noticed that a high degree of religious devotion
is frequently accompanied with great laxity of morals. The orientalist
Wallin, who had an intimate and extensive knowledge of Mohammedan
peoples, often found that those Moslems who attended to their prayers
most regularly were the greatest scoundrels.<a name="FnAnchor74"
href="#Footnote74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> “One of the most
remarkable traits in the character of the Copts,” says Lane, “is their
bigotry”; and at the same time they are represented as “deceitful,
faithless, and abandoned to the pursuit of worldly gain, and to
indulgence in sensual pleasure.”<a name="FnAnchor75"
href="#Footnote75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> Among two hundred
Italian murderers Ferri did not find one who was irreligious; and
Naples, which has (or had?) the worst record of any European city for
crimes against the person, is also the most religious city in
Europe.<a name="FnAnchor76" href="#Footnote76"><span
class="sp">76</span></a> On the other hand, according to Havelock
Ellis, “it seems extremely rare to find intelligently irreligious men
in prison.”<a name="FnAnchor77" href="#Footnote77"><span
class="sp">77</span></a> Most religions contain an element which <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page30"></a>30</span> constitutes a real peril
to the morality of their votaries. They have introduced a new kind of
duties&mdash;duties towards gods; and even where religion has entered
into close union with worldly morality, much greater importance has
been attached to ceremonies or worship or the niceties of belief than
to good behaviour towards fellow-men. People think that they may make
up for lack of the latter by orthodoxy or pious performances. A
Christian bishop of the seventh century, who was canonised by the
Church of Rome, described a good Christian as a man “who comes
frequently to church; who presents the oblation which is offered to
God upon the altar; who doth not taste fruits of his own industry
until he has consecrated a part of them to God; who, when the holy
festivals approach, lives chastely even with his own wife during
several days, that with a safe conscience he may draw near the altar
of God; and who, in the last place, can repeat the Creed and the
Lord’s Prayer.”<a name="FnAnchor78" href="#Footnote78"><span
class="sp">78</span></a> A scrupulous observance of external
ceremonies&mdash;that is all which in this description is required of
a good Christian. Smollett observes in his <i>Travels into Italy</i>
that it is held more infamous to transgress the slightest ceremonial
institution of the Church of Rome than to transgress any moral duty;
that a murderer or adulterer will be easily absolved by the Church,
and even maintain his character in society; but that a man who eats a
pigeon on a Saturday is abhorred as a monster of reprobation.<a
name="FnAnchor79" href="#Footnote79"><span class="sp">79</span></a>
Simonde de Sismondi wrote: “The more regular a vicious man has been in
observing the commandments of the Church, the more he feels in his
heart that he can dispense with the observance of that celestial
morality to which he ought to sacrifice his depraved propensities.”<a
name="FnAnchor80" href="#Footnote80"><span class="sp">80</span></a>
And how many a Protestant does not imagine that by going to church on
Sundays he may sin more freely on the six days between? In reply to
Starbuck’s question, “What does religion mean to you?” a sixty-seven
years old business man wrote: “I find that the most religious and
pious people are as a rule those most lacking in uprightness and
morality. The men who do not go to church or have any religious
convictions are the best. Praying, singing of hymns, and sermonising
are pernicious&mdash;they teach us to rely on some supernatural power,
when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page31"></a>31</span> we ought to
rely on ourselves.” William James recognises in this man a
sufficiently familiar type.<a name="FnAnchor81"

<p>We come at last to a point in which religion, or rather the
Christian revelation, is supposed to have exercised a profound
influence on moral ideas: it is said to have invested them with
objective validity.</p>
<p>All exponents of normative ethics assume that they possess such
validity: that the moral values belong to a reality which exists
whether there be a mind that perceives it or not, that what is said to
be good or bad, right or wrong, cannot be reduced merely to what
people think to be good or bad, right or wrong. It makes morality a
matter of truth and falsity, and to say that a judgment is true
obviously means something different from the statement that it is
thought to be true. If a certain course of conduct is objectively
right it must be thought to be right by all rational beings who judge
truly of the matter and cannot, without error, be judged to be
wrong.</p>
<p>Certain philosophers, like Mill and Kant, have adduced rational
arguments to prove the objectivity of their first principles and
thereby the existence of ethical truths. These have been rejected for
good reasons, and the advocates of moral objectivity have generally
resorted to a more convenient method of establishing it: they assume
that there are self-evident moral principles perceived by intuition.
But how can I know if a proposition is really self-evident or only
supposed to be so? In the case of theoretical truths no truth is
admitted to have a claim to self-evidence which is not generally
accepted as self-evident or axiomatic by all those whose intellect is
sufficiently developed to have an opinion on the matter worthy of any
consideration at all; to speak with Sidgwick, the absence of
disagreement between experts must be an indispensable negative
condition of the certainty of our beliefs.<a name="FnAnchor82"
href="#Footnote82"><span class="sp">82</span></a> As a matter of fact,
however, in the case of moral principles enunciated as self-evident
truths disagreement is radical. Some “moral specialists” say it is an
axiom that I ought not to prefer my own lesser good to the greater
good of another; whilst others not only deny the self-evidence, but
thoroughly disagree with the contents, of this proposition. According
to Sidgwick the assertion that pleasure is the only rational ultimate
end of action is an object of intuition;<a name="FnAnchor83"
href="#Footnote83"><span class="sp">83</span></a> according to Moore,
also a professor of moral philosophy, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page32"></a>32</span> the untruth of this proposition is
self-evident.<a name="FnAnchor84" href="#Footnote84"><span
class="sp">84</span></a> The latter finds it self-evident that good
cannot be defined;<a name="FnAnchor85" href="#Footnote85"><span
class="sp">85</span></a> but others, who have no smaller claim to the
epithet “moral specialists,” are of the very contrary opinion. What
should we say if two professors of mathematics quarrelled about the
axiom that “if equals be added to equals the wholes are equal,” to
which Sidgwick compares one of his moral axioms?<a name="FnAnchor86"

<p>But besides rational arguments and intuitive insight that have been
alleged to prove the objectivity of moral judgments there are also
theological arguments. In spite of all his efforts to base his own
theory on a non-theological basis, Rashdall feels compelled to admit
that, in his opinion, the belief in God is the logical presupposition
of an “objective” or absolute morality. “A moral ideal,” he says, “can
exist nowhere and nohow but in a mind; an absolute moral ideal can
exist only in a Mind from which all Reality is derived. Our moral
ideal can only claim objective validity in so far as it can rationally
be regarded as the revelation of a moral ideal externally existing in
the mind of God.”<a name="FnAnchor87" href="#Footnote87"><span
class="sp">87</span></a> He invalidates, however, in another place
this argument by saying that “the belief in the objectivity of our
moral judgments is a necessary premise for any valid argument for the
belief either in God, if by that be understood a morally good or
perfect Being, or in Immortality.”<a name="FnAnchor88"
href="#Footnote88"><span class="sp">88</span></a> The two statements
that objective morality presupposes the belief in God, and that the
belief in God presupposes objective morality, lead combined to the
logical conclusion that there is no valid evidence <em>either</em> for
the existence of God <em>or</em> for the objectivity of moral judgments.
According to Dean Inge, “Christianity lifts psychology out of mere
subjectivism, and morality out of mere relativism. . . . The Christian
point of view gives to conduct an absolute value.”<a name="FnAnchor89"
href="#Footnote89"><span class="sp">89</span></a> Bishop Bohlin, after
a penetrating review of the claim to objective validity made by
normative moralists, arrives at the conclusion that only a divine
revelation can give morality such validity.<a name="FnAnchor90"

<p>The theological argument in favour of the objective validity of
moral judgments, which is based on belief in an all-good God who has
revealed his will to mankind, contains of course <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page33"></a>33</span> an assumption that cannot
be proved scientifically. But even if it could be proved, would that
justify the conclusion drawn from it? Those who maintain that they
possess in such a revelation an absolute moral standard and that,
consequently, any mode of conduct which is in accordance with it must
be objectively right, may be asked what they mean by an all-good God.
If God were not supposed to be all-good, we might certainly be induced
by prudence to obey his decrees, but they could not lay claim to
<em>moral</em> validity; suppose the devil were to take over the
government of the world, what influence would that have on the moral
values&mdash;would it make right wrong and wrong right? It is only the
all-goodness of God that might give his commandments absolute moral
validity. But to say that something is good because it is in
accordance with the will of an all-good God is to reason in a circle;
if goodness means anything, it must have a meaning which is
independent of his will. God is called good or righteous because he is
supposed to possess certain qualities that we are used to call so: he
is benevolent, he requites virtue and vice, and so forth. For such
reasons do we add the attributes goodness and righteousness to his
other attributes, which express qualities of an objective character,
and by calling him all-good we attribute to him perfect goodness.<a
name="FnAnchor91" href="#Footnote91"><span class="sp">91</span></a> As
a matter of fact, there are also many theologians who consider moral
distinctions to be antecedent to the divine commandments. Thomas
Aquinas and his school maintain that the right is not right because
God wills it, but that God wills it because it is right.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote91"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor91"><sup>91</sup></a></span> <i>Cf.</i> Shaftesbury,
<i>Characteristicks</i>, ii (London, 1733), p. 49 <i>sq.</i>: “Whoever
thinks there is a God, and pretends formally to believe that he is
just and good, must suppose that there is independently such a thing
as justice and injustice, truth and falsehood, right and wrong;
according to which he pronounces that God is just, righteous, and
true.” A similar remark has been made by G. Stumpf (<i>Vom ethischen
Skeptizismus</i> [Leipzig, 1909], p. 22) and G. Heymans (<i>Einführung
in die Ethik auf Grundlage der Erfahrung</i> [Leipzig, 1914], p.
8).</p></div>

<p>1 have thus arrived at the conclusion that the attempts of
philosophers and theologians to prove the objective validity of moral
judgments give us no right to accept such validity as a fact. I am now
prepared to take a step further and assert that it cannot exist. The
reason for this is that in my opinion the predicates of all moral
judgments, all moral concepts, are ultimately based on emotions, and
that, as is very commonly admitted,<a name="FnAnchor92"
href="#Footnote92"><span class="sp">92</span></a> no objectivity can
come from an emotion. It is of course true or not that we in a given
moment have a certain emotion; but in no other sense can the
antithesis <span class="pagenum"><a id="page34"></a>34</span> of true
and false be applied to it. The cognition which gives rise to an
emotion is of course either true or false; in the latter case the
emotion may be said to be felt “by mistake”&mdash;as when a person is
frightened by some object in the dark which he takes for a ghost, or
is indignant with a person to whom he imputes a wrong that has been
committed by somebody else; but this does not alter the nature of the
emotion itself. We may call the emotion of another person
“unjustified,” if we feel that we ourselves should not have
experienced the same emotion had we been in his place, or, as in the
case of moral approval or disapproval, if we cannot share his emotion.
But to speak, as Brentano does, of “right” and “wrong” emotions,
springing from self-evident intuitions and having the same validity as
truth and error,<a name="FnAnchor93" href="#Footnote93"><span
class="sp">93</span></a> is only another futile attempt to objectivise
our moral judgments. The same may be said of Nicolai Hartmann’s
assertions that “the sense of value is not less objective than
mathematical insight,”<a name="FnAnchor94" href="#Footnote94"><span
class="sp">94</span></a> and that the criterion of the genuine and the
spurious sense of value “is nothing else than the primary
consciousness of value itself,” which is also an intuition.<a
name="FnAnchor95" href="#Footnote95"><span class="sp">95</span></a>
But I find in his book no clear criterion of this “primary
consciousness of value” as distinguished from any other feeling of
value. Very generally the so-called intuitions are nothing but
objectivised emotions, or emotional tendencies formulated as
judgments, calculated to give moral values an objectivity they do not
in reality possess.</p>

<p>Although all moral judgments are ultimately based on emotions, the
influence that intellectual factors exercise on such judgments is very
great indeed. Emotions are determined by cognitions and differ in
nature or strength according as the cognitions differ. This has been a
very important cause of the variations of moral judgments: the same
course of conduct is differently judged of because different notions
are held as to its nature or implications. If a person tells an
untruth we are apt to feel indignant; but if, on due consideration of
facts, we find that his motive was benevolent, for instance to save
the life of the person to whom it was told, our indignation ceases and
may be followed by approval. And, to take another instance, at the
lower stages of civilisation there is a considerable lack of
discrimination between intentional injuries and accidental ones, and
even among ourselves the outward event exercises a <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page35"></a>35</span> great influence upon
moral estimates.<a name="FnAnchor96" href="#Footnote96"><span
class="sp">96</span></a> But if it is clearly realised that a certain
event is the result of merely external circumstances, that it was
neither intended by the agent nor could have been foreseen by him,
then there could be no moral disapproval at all. Such an event could
not even call forth a feeling of revenge. Sudden anger itself cools,
down when it appears that the cause of the inflicted pain was a mere
accident. Even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and
being kicked.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote96"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor96"><sup>96</sup></a></span> We notice this influence
even in certain rules and doctrines of mediæval Christianity. The
principle laid down by Augustine (<i>Sermo CLXXX.</i> 2, in Migne,
<i>Patrologiæ cursus</i>, xxxviii. 973), and adopted by Canon Law
(Gratian, <i>Decretum</i>, ii. 22. 2. 3), that “ream linguam non
facit, nisi mens rea,” was not always acted upon. Various penitentials
condemned to penance a person who, in giving evidence, swore to the
best of his belief, in case his statement afterwards proved untrue;
and in other cases also penances were prescribed for mere misfortunes.
If a person killed another by pure accident, he had to do
penance&mdash;in ordinary cases, according to most English
penitentials, for one year, according to various continental
penitentials, for five or seven years; whereas, according to the
Penitential of Pseudo-Theodore, he who accidentally killed his father
or mother was to atone his deed with a penance of fifteen years, and
he who accidentally killed his son with a penance of twelve (see
<i>The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas</i>, i. 230). The
Scotists even expressly declared that the external deed has a moral
value of its own, which increases the goodness or badness of the
agent’s intention; and though this doctrine was opposed by Thomas
Aquinas, Bonaventura, Suarez, and other leading theologians, it was
nevertheless admitted by them that, according to the will of God,
certain external deeds entail a certain accidental reward, the
so-called <i>aureola</i> (F. A. Göpfert, <i>Moraltheologie</i>, i
[Paderborn, 1899], p. 185).</p></div>

<p>The variability of moral valuation also depends in a large measure
upon different cognitions arising from different situations and
external conditions of life. We find, for example, among many peoples
the custom of killing or abandoning parents worn out with age or
disease. It prevails among a large number of savage tribes and
occurred formerly among several Asiatic and European nations,
including the Vedic people and peoples of Teutonic extraction. It is
particularly common among nomadic hunting tribes, owing to the
hardships of life and the inability of decrepit persons to keep up in
the march. In times when the food-supply is insufficient to support
all the members of a community it also seems more reasonable that the
old and useless should have to perish than the young and vigorous. And
among peoples which have reached a certain degree of wealth and
comfort the practice of killing the old folks, though no longer
justified by necessity, may still go <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page36"></a>36</span> on, partly through survival of a custom
inherited from harder times, and partly from the humane intent of
putting an end to lingering misery. What appears to most of us as an
atrocious practice may really be an act of kindness, and is commonly
approved of, or even insisted upon, by the old people themselves. Or
take the widespread custom of infanticide. Among the lower races
custom often decides how many children are to be reared in each
family, and not infrequently the majority of infants are destroyed.
This wholesale infanticide is also mainly due to the hardships of
savage life. Urgent want is frequently represented by our authorities
as the main cause of it; and their statements are corroborated by the
conspicuous prevalence of this custom among poor tribes and in islands
whose inhabitants are confined to a narrow territory with limited
resources. For a similar reason infanticide is or has been a custom
among many peoples of a higher civilisation.</p>
<p>The variability of moral judgments further originates in different
measures of forethought or knowledge based on experience of the
consequences of conduct, and in different beliefs. In almost every
branch of conduct we notice the influence which the belief in
supernatural forces or beings or in a future state has exercised upon
the moral ideas of mankind, and the great diversity of this influence.
Religion or superstition has, on the one hand, stigmatised murder and
suicide, on the other hand it has commended human sacrifice and
certain cases of voluntary self-destruction. It has inculcated
humanity and charity, but has also led to cruel persecutions of
persons embracing another creed. It has emphasised the duty of
truth-speaking, and has itself been a cause of pious fraud. It has
promoted cleanly habits and filthiness. It has enjoined labour and
abstinence from labour, sobriety and drunkenness, marriage and
celibacy, chastity and temple prostitution. It has introduced a great
variety of new duties and virtues, quite different from those which
are recognised by the moral consciousness when left to itself, but
nevertheless in many cases considered more important than any other
duties or virtues.</p>
<p>From this motley crowd of influences I shall single out one the
result of which has been particularly revolting to the moral feelings
of Christians, namely human sacrifice. It is found not only among many
savages, but occurred in early times among all Indo-European peoples,
the Semites, and the Japanese, and in the New World among the Mayas
and the Aztecs, who practised it on an enormous scale. The gods were
supposed to be gratified by such offerings&mdash;because they had an
appetite <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37"></a>37</span> for human
flesh and blood, or because they required attendants, or because they
were angry and could only be appeased by the death of him or those who
aroused their anger or some representative of the offending community,
or&mdash;who could exactly tell why? The principal thing is that
people know or believe that on some certain occasion they are in
danger of losing their lives; they attribute this to the designs of a
supernatural being; and by sacrificing a man they hope to avert the
danger from themselves by gratifying that being’s craving for human
life. That this principle mainly underlies the practice of human
sacrifice appears from the particular circumstances in which it
generally occurs. In such cases it is mostly a matter of public
concern, a method of ensuring the lives of many by the death of one or
a few&mdash;absurd, no doubt, according to our ideas, but not an act
of wanton cruelty. When practised for the benefit of the community or
in a case of national distress, it is hardly more cruel than to compel
thousands of men to suffer death on the battlefield on behalf of their
country.</p>
<p>In so far as differences of moral opinions depend on different
degrees of reflection, on knowledge or ignorance of specific religious
or superstitious beliefs, or on different conditions of life and other
external circumstances, they do not clash with that universality which
is implied in the notion of the objective validity of moral judgment,
as in every kind of truth. But the case is different with some other
dissimilarities of moral opinion, which are due to other causes.</p>
<p>When we study the moral rules laid down by the customs of savage
peoples we find that they in a very large measure resemble the rules
of civilised nations. In every savage community homicide is prohibited
by custom, and so is theft. Savages also regard charity as a duty and
praise generosity as a virtue, indeed their customs relating to mutual
aid are often more exacting than our own; and many of them are
conspicuous for their avoidance of telling lies. But in spite of the
great similarity of moral commandments, there is at the same time a
difference between the regard for life, property, truth, and the
general well-being of a neighbour which displays itself in savage
rules of morality and that which is found among ourselves: it has,
broadly speaking, only reference to members of the same community or
tribe. Among peoples more advanced in civilisation the social unit has
grown larger, the nation has taken the place of the tribe, and the
circle within which the infliction of injuries is prohibited has
extended accordingly. A distinction is still very frequently made
between injuries committed against compatriots and harm done to
foreigners, but both law and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page38"></a>38</span> public opinion may show a very great advance
in humanity with regard to the treatment of the latter. And when we
come to rules laid down by moralists and professedly accepted by a
large portion of civilised mankind, we find such as have reference to
the whole human race. It seems to me obvious that the dominant cause
of this expansion of moral rules has been the widening of the
altruistic sentiment. But this sentiment varies in different
individuals both in strength and with reference to its objects. And
this variability will always prevent the moral rules from being
anything like uniform.</p>
<p>The variations of the altruistic sentiment in range and strength
are also responsible for other differences of moral opinion. Even
among ourselves there is no unanimity as to the dictates of duty in
cases where a person’s own interests collide with those of his
fellow-men. Sidgwick admitted that his axiom of “rational
benevolence,” according to which, other things being equal, no one
must prefer his own lesser good to the greater good of another, is
more rigid than the view of common sense,<a name="FnAnchor97"
href="#Footnote97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> and I fail to see
that any process of reasoning or “intuition” could ever harmonise the
different views. As Höffding said, no reasoning can change an egoist
into a utilitarian; his position is so far unassailable.<a
name="FnAnchor98" href="#Footnote98"><span class="sp">98</span></a>
While everybody will agree that some amount of self-sacrifice is a
duty in certain circumstances, the amount and the circumstances can
hardly be fixed in general rules, and on the whole, in cases of
conflicting interests the judgment must to a large extent remain a
matter of private opinion. Kant, that high priest of ethical
rationalism, wrote that it is impossible to assign definite limits how
far I am bound to sacrifice to others a part of my own welfare without
hope of recompense. “This duty, therefore, is only indeterminate; it
has a certain latitude within which one may do more or less without
being able to assign its limits definitely.”<a name="FnAnchor99"

<p>That moral judgments could not possibly possess that universality
which is characteristic of truth becomes particularly obvious when we
consider that their predicates vary not only in quality but also in
quantity. There are no degrees of truth and falsehood; but there are
degrees of goodness and badness, virtues and merits may be greater or
smaller, a duty may be more or less stringent, and if there are no
degrees of rightness, the reason for it is that right means simply
conformity to the rule of duty. These quantitative differences of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page39"></a>39</span> moral estimates are
due to the emotional origin of all moral concepts. Emotions vary
indefinitely in strength, and the moral emotions form no exception to
this rule. It should be noticed, however, that the quantity of the
estimate expressed in a moral predicate is not identical with the
intensity of the moral emotion which a certain course of conduct
arouses on a particular occasion. We are liable to feel more indignant
if an injury is committed before our eyes than if we read about it in
a newspaper, and yet we admit that the degree of badness is the same
in either case. The comparative quantity of moral estimates is
determined by the intensity of the emotions which their objects tend
to evoke in exactly similar circumstances.</p>
<p>But in spite of all differences of moral ideas there are most
substantial similarities, which are due to the facts that they are all
based on moral emotions, and that moral emotions are retributive
emotions characterised by disinterestedness and impartiality. I have
discussed these facts at a length which may have seemed exorbitant,
but which I have found necessary for expressing and justifying my
views on Christian morals.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>
<h3>THE ETHICS OF JESUS: THEIR RETRIBUTIVE CHARACTER</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="smcap">HE</span> thesis that moral judgments are
based on retributive emotions may seem to have been a strange
introduction to the discussion of the ethics of the New Testament with
their doctrine of love and forgiveness. But I maintain that this
thesis is nowhere confirmed more strongly than in the teaching of
Jesus as recorded in the three synoptic gospels.</p>
<p>While the Gospel of John is of great value for the history of the
teaching of the early Catholic Church and the edifice of Catholic
doctrines based on it, it is now very generally admitted to be a
comparatively late document which does not give us an authoritative
account of the work and teaching of Jesus, but represents a
tendentious interpretation of the tradition. The synoptic gospels are
founded on a tradition about Jesus which had been preached and taught
in the Church either orally or else in small collections capable of
expansion.<a name="FnAnchor100" href="#Footnote100"><span
class="sp">100</span></a> Almost all scholars are now agreed that the
short Gospel of Mark, which is earlier than its two companions,
has been one of their sources; but that they in addition used also
another source, now lost, which has been designated Q. As regards the
amount of reliable information which the three gospels contain, it has
been pointed out that wherever we can observe the methods of the
synoptists we see how little they valued strict accuracy in the
reproduction of their authorities, and how fully they felt themselves
justified in treating the details with literary freedom.<a
name="FnAnchor101" href="#Footnote101"><span class="sp">101</span></a>
There is no doubt that Jesus never uttered the discourses attributed
to him, but that they are artificial compositions of which the most
which we can hope is that they employ authentic logia. On closer
examination these discourses break up into a number of disjointed
sayings or, at best, into small groups of sayings, which appear to be
for the most part the work of the primitive community or of the gospel
redactors.<a name="FnAnchor102" href="#Footnote102"><span

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page41"></a>41</span> It is a question
whether the tradition, which had only recollection to sustain it, was
sufficiently complete and precise to enable us to comprehend what
Jesus said and meant. Harnack avers that the synoptics give us a clear
idea of Jesus’ teaching in regard both to its main features and to its
individual application.<a name="FnAnchor103" href="#Footnote103"><span
class="sp">103</span></a> According to Dibelius, “the message of Jesus
has been preserved for us in the first three gospels self-consistently
and unspoiled.”<a name="FnAnchor104" href="#Footnote104"><span
class="sp">104</span></a> Professor R. H. Lightfoot, again, concludes
that the gospels yield us little more than a whisper of the voice of
Jesus.<a name="FnAnchor105" href="#Footnote105"><span
class="sp">105</span></a> Wrede says it should be borne in mind that
only the earliest stratum of the material of the three gospels existed
before the elaboration of the Pauline theology, and that a
considerable part of it came into being alongside or after that
theology, nay even&mdash;here and there&mdash;under its influence.<a
name="FnAnchor106" href="#Footnote106"><span class="sp">106</span></a>
In any case the ethics of Jesus are quite distinct: the principle of
divine reward and punishment is the keystone of his moral teaching,
which is thus an expression of retributive emotions&mdash;the basis of
all moral judgments.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that moral emotions are
<em>disinterested</em> retributive emotions. Personal anger and
vindictiveness are strongly condemned by Jesus:</p>
<p>“Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil:<a
name="FnAnchor107" href="#Footnote107"><span class="sp">107</span></a>
but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the
other also. . . . Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love
your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you”
(<i>Matthew</i> v. 38, 39, 43 <i>sq.</i>).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote107"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor107"><sup>107</sup></a></span> The Revised Edition has
“him who is evil,” but also “evil” as an alternative. J. B. Lightfoot
(<i>On a Fresh Revision of the English New Testament</i> [London,
1891], p. 274) thinks that the former rendering is more likely to be
the correct one; and N. Söderblom (<i>Jesu bärgspredikan och vår
tid</i> [Stockholm, 1899], pp. 19, 194) insists on it.</p></div>

<p>“If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
your Father forgive your trespasses” (<i>ibid.</i> vi. 14 <i>sq.</i>).
See also <i>ibid.</i> xviii. 34 <i>sq.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page42"></a>42</span> “Then came Peter
to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I
forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto
thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven” (<i>ibid.</i>
xviii. 21 <i>sq.</i>).</p>
<p>“When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that
your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven
forgive your trespasses” (<i>Mark</i> xi. 25 <i>sq.</i>).</p>
<p>“Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you. Bless them that
curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. And unto him
that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that
taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also. Give to every
man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask
them not again. . . . Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend,
hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall
be the children of the Highest. . . . Forgive, and ye shall be
forgiven” (<i>Luke</i> vi. 27&mdash;30, 35, 37).</p>
<p>The injunction of forgiveness, however, is not always unqualified.
According to Luke, Jesus said: “If thy brother trespass against
thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. And if he trespass
against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again
to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.”<a
name="FnAnchor108" href="#Footnote108"><span class="sp">108</span></a>
He also gave the following injunction: “If thy brother shall trespass
against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if
he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not
hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of
two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall
neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to
hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a
publican.”<a name="FnAnchor109" href="#Footnote109"><span
class="sp">109</span></a> Moreover, according to some manuscripts and
the Authorised Version of the English Bible, Jesus said: “Whosoever is
angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the
judgment”;<a name="FnAnchor110" href="#Footnote110"><span
class="sp">110</span></a> whereas the qualifying clause “without a
cause” is lacking in other manuscripts&mdash;both the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page43"></a>43</span> <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i>
and the <i>Vaticanus</i>&mdash;and in the <i>Vulgate</i>,<a
name="FnAnchor111" href="#Footnote111"><span class="sp">111</span></a>
and has been omitted in the Revised Version of the English Bible. It
would of course be absurd to blame a person for expressing moral
indignation at an act simply because he himself happens to be the
offended party.</p>

<p>The injunctions of forgiveness and kindness to enemies are by no
means exclusively Christian tenets. We find them in the Old Testament.
“Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart. . . . Thou shalt not
avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people.”<a
name="FnAnchor112" href="#Footnote112"><span class="sp">112</span></a>
“Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the Lord, and he
shall save thee.”<a name="FnAnchor113" href="#Footnote113"><span
class="sp">113</span></a> “If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to
eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: for thou shalt
heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee.”<a
name="FnAnchor114" href="#Footnote114"><span class="sp">114</span></a>
“If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt
surely bring it back to him again. If thou see the ass of him that
hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him,
thou shalt surely help with him.”<a name="FnAnchor115"
href="#Footnote115"><span class="sp">115</span></a> Sirach says:
“Forgive thy neighbour the injury (done to thee), and then, when thou
prayest, thy sins will be forgiven.”<a name="FnAnchor116"
href="#Footnote116"><span class="sp">116</span></a> In the apocryphal
book ‘The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs,’ which is supposed to
have been written more than a century before the life and teaching of
Jesus, we read: “If a man sin against thee, speak peaceably to him,
and in thy soul hold not guile; and if he repent and confess, forgive
him. . . . But if he be shameless and persisteth in his wrongdoing,
even so forgive him from the heart, and leave to God the avenging.”<a

<p>Kindness to enemies was inculcated by Chinese moralists.
“Recompense injury with kindness,” says Lao-Tsze.<a name="FnAnchor126"
href="#Footnote126"><span class="sp">126</span></a> According to
Mencius, “a benevolent man does not lay up anger, nor cherish

legislator, the following rule is laid down for the twice-born man:
“Against an angry man let him not in return show anger, let him bless
when he is cursed.”<a name="FnAnchor128" href="#Footnote128"><span
class="sp">128</span></a> It is said in the Buddhist ‘Dhammapada’:
“Hatred does not cease by hatred at any time; hatred ceases by love,
this is an old rule. . . . Among men who hate us we dwell free from
hatred. . . . Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome evil
by good; let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by
truth.”<a name="FnAnchor129" href="#Footnote129"><span

<p>The principle of forgiveness had also advocates in Greece <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page45"></a>45</span> and Rome. In one of the
Platonic dialogues, Socrates says: “We ought not to retaliate or
render evil for evil to any one, whatever evil we may have suffered
from him”; though he adds that “this opinion has never been held, and
never will be held, by any considerable number of persons.”<a
name="FnAnchor130" href="#Footnote130"><span class="sp">130</span></a>
In Stoicism the condemnation of anger and resentment is abundant.
“Mankind is born for mutual assistance, anger for mutual ruin.”<a
name="FnAnchor131" href="#Footnote131"><span class="sp">131</span></a>
“Anger is a crime of the mind; . . . it often is even more criminal
than the faults with which it is angry.”<a name="FnAnchor132"
href="#Footnote132"><span class="sp">132</span></a> “The truly great
mind, which takes a true estimate of its own value, does not revenge
an insult because it does not feel it.”<a name="FnAnchor133"
href="#Footnote133"><span class="sp">133</span></a> “We all are bad. .
. . There is only one thing which can afford us peace, and that is to
agree to forgive one another.”<a name="FnAnchor134"
href="#Footnote134"><span class="sp">134</span></a> “If any one is
angry with you, meet his anger by returning benefits for it.”<a
name="FnAnchor135" href="#Footnote135"><span class="sp">135</span></a>
“To suppose that we shall become contemptible in the eyes of others
unless in some way we inflict an injury on those who first shewed
hostility to us, is the character of most ignoble and thoughtless
men.”<a name="FnAnchor136" href="#Footnote136"><span
class="sp">136</span></a> “The Cynic loves those who beat him.”<a
name="FnAnchor137" href="#Footnote137"><span class="sp">137</span></a>
He is the best and purest “who pardons others as if he sinned himself
daily, but avoids sinning as if he never pardoned.”<a
name="FnAnchor138" href="#Footnote138"><span class="sp">138</span></a>
“The best way of revenge is not to imitate the injury.”<a
name="FnAnchor139" href="#Footnote139"><span class="sp">139</span></a>
“Though we are not just of the same flesh and blood, yet our minds are
nearly related, being both extracted from the Deity. . . . Nor can I
find it in my heart to hate or to be angry with one of my own nature
or family. For we are all made for mutual assistance.”<a
name="FnAnchor140" href="#Footnote140"><span class="sp">140</span></a>
“Remember always, when you are angry, that rage is the mark of an
unmanly disposition. Mildness and temper are not only more human, but
more masculine too.”<a name="FnAnchor141" href="#Footnote141"><span
class="sp">141</span></a> “This is the way to disarm the most
insolent, if you continue kind and unmoved under ill usage.”<a
name="FnAnchor142" href="#Footnote142"><span class="sp">142</span></a>
Some of these statements breathe rather dignity or pride than
kindness; and Seneca makes the acute remark that “the most
contemptuous form of revenge is not to deem one’s adversary worth
taking vengeance upon.”<a name="FnAnchor143" href="#Footnote143"><span
class="sp">143</span></a> Paul says, as it was said in the Proverbs,
that if you feed your enemy when he hungers and give him drink when he
thirsts, you will “heap coals of fire on his head.”<a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page46"></a>46</span> A person who
feels resentment may be a proper object of moral disapproval, not on
account of the resentful impulse as such, but because it has been
allowed to develop either into an intention or into a deliberate wish
to make the other person suffer or, at any rate, into a wish that he
shall have to suffer; and the word resentment may be vaguely used in
all these cases. Jesus’ commandment, “Love your enemies,” may imply
something more than the next one, “Do good to them that hate you”: it
may enjoin you to try to check your anger; but it cannot reasonably
make it an obligation for you to have a tender feeling towards your
enemy. As Kant said,<a name="FnAnchor145" href="#Footnote145"><span
class="sp">145</span></a> “love, as an affection, cannot be
commanded,” and the reason for this is that it cannot be produced by
any effort of will. But it is easy to see why thoughtful and
sympathetic minds disapprove of resentment and retaliation springing
from personal motives. Such resentment is apt to be partial. It is too
often directed against persons whom impartial reflection finds to be
no proper objects of indignation, and still more frequently it is
unduly excessive. As Butler said, “We are in such a peculiar situation
with respect to injuries done to ourselves, that we can scarce any
more see them as they really are, than our eye can see itself.”<a
name="FnAnchor146" href="#Footnote146"><span class="sp">146</span></a>
“As bodies seem greater in a midst, so do little matters in a rage”;
hence the old rule that we ought not to punish whilst angry.<a
name="FnAnchor147" href="#Footnote147"><span class="sp">147</span></a>
The restraining rule of like for like, which is frequently found among
peoples whose customs permit or enjoin private revenge, has largely a
social origin.<a name="FnAnchor148" href="#Footnote148"><span
class="sp">148</span></a> As resentment involves no accurate balancing
of suffering against suffering, there may be a crying disproportion
between the act of revenge and the injury evoking it; a revengeful
mind, said Sir Thomas Browne, “holds no rule in retaliations,
requiring too often a head for a tooth, and the supreme revenge for
trespasses, which a night’s rest should obliterate.”<a
name="FnAnchor149" href="#Footnote149"><span class="sp">149</span></a>
But if the offender is a person with whose feelings men are ready to
sympathise, their sympathy will keep the desire to see him suffer
within certain limits; and if, in ordinary circumstances, they tend to
sympathise equally with both parties, the injurer <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page47"></a>47</span> and the person injured,
and, in consequence, confer upon these equal rights, they will demand
a retaliation which is only equal in degree to the offence. The more
the moral consciousness is influenced by sympathy, the more severely
it condemns any retributive infliction of pain which it regards as
undeserved; and it seems to be in the first place with a view to
preventing such injustice that teachers of morality have enjoined upon
men to love or be kind to their enemies.</p>

<p>Quite different from the resentment and retaliation springing from
personal motives are moral resentment and the punishment in which it
finds its expression. The moral indignation of Jesus was often
intense. His attacks on the Pharisees, scribes, and lawyers were
vehement in the extreme:</p>
<p>“Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up
the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves,
neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you,
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and
for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the
greater damnation. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is
made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. . .
. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of
mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of
the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and
not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides, which strain at a
gnat, and swallow a camel. Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the
platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. . . . Woe
unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto
whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are
within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye
also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of
hypocrisy and iniquity. . . . Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers,
how can ye escape the damnation of hell?” (<i>Matthew</i> xxiii.
13&mdash;15, 23&mdash;25, 27, 28, 33).</p>
<p>“Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love
salutations in the marketplaces, And the chief seats in the
synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: Which devour widows’
houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive
greater damnation” (<i>Mark</i> xii. 38&mdash;40).</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Luke there are similar attacks on the Pharisees
and scribes, and on the lawyers as well (xi. 39 <i>sqq.</i>, xx. 46
<i>sq.</i>).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page48"></a>48</span> The moral
indignation of Jesus even led him to violent activity. He “went into
the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the
temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats
of them that sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house
shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of
thieves.”<a name="FnAnchor150" href="#Footnote150"><span
class="sp">150</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote150"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor150"><sup>150</sup></a></span> <i>Matthew</i> xxi. 12
<i>sq.</i> See also <i>Mark</i> xi. 15&mdash;17; <i>Luke</i> xix. 45
<i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>Resentment, moral and non-moral, varies indefinitely in intensity,
and the same is the case with the act of retaliation to which it may
lead. According to the teaching of Jesus, the future punishment of
sinners is often enormous. As this is a fact which Christian
apologists have ignored or smoothed over, I shall add other quotations
from the gospels to those referring to the Pharisees, scribes, and
lawyers:</p>
<p>“Whosoever shall say (to his brother), Thou fool, shall be in
danger of hell fire” (<i>Matthew</i> v. 22).</p>
<p>“If thy right eye (or, ‘thy right hand’) offend thee pluck it out
(or, ‘cut it off’), and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for
thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole
body should be cast into hell” (<i>ibid.</i> v. 29 <i>sq.</i>). See
also <i>ibid.</i> xviii. 8 <i>sq.</i>; <i>Mark</i> ix.
43&mdash;48.</p>
<p>“The children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness:
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth” (<i>Matthew</i> viii.
12).</p>
<p>“Whosoever shall not receive you (the disciples), nor hear your
words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of
your feet. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the
land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city”
(<i>ibid.</i> x. 14 <i>sq.</i>).</p>
<p>“Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell”
(<i>Matthew</i> x. 28).</p>
<p>“Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say
unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of
judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto
heaven, shalt be brought down to hell. . . . It shall be more
tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee”
(<i>ibid.</i> xi. 21&mdash;24). See also <i>Luke</i> x.
12&mdash;15.</p>
<p>“The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather
out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire, there shall be wailing and
gnashing of teeth. . . . So shall it <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page49"></a>49</span> be at the end of the world; the angels shall
come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, And shall cast
them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of
teeth” (<i>Matthew</i>, xiii. 41, 42, 49 <i>sq.</i>).</p>
<p>“Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me,
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea” (<i>ibid.</i> xviii.
6). See also <i>Mark</i> ix. 42.</p>
<p>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and before him shall
be gathered all nations, “he shall separate them one from another, as
a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the
sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. . . . Then shall
he say unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. . . . And
these shall go away into everlasting punishment” (<i>Matthew</i> xxv.
31&mdash;33, 41, 46).</p>
<p>“He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation” (<i>Mark</i> iii.
29). <i>Cf.</i> <i>Matthew</i> xii. 31 <i>sq.</i>; <i>Luke</i> xii.
10.</p>
<p>“Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish” (<i>Luke</i> xiii.
3, 5).</p>
<p>“Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves
thrust out” (<i>ibid.</i> xiii. 27 <i>sq.</i>).</p>
<p>The rich man of the parable died and was buried, “and in hell he
lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and
Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, . . . I am tormented in
this flame” (<i>ibid.</i> xvi. 22&mdash;24).</p>
<p>When Jesus was asked, “Lord, are there few that be saved?” he said:
“Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will
seek to enter in, and shall not be able.”<a name="FnAnchor151"
href="#Footnote151"><span class="sp">151</span></a> On another
occasion, in his Sermon on the Mount, he said: “Wide is the gate, and
broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which
go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way,
which leadeth into life, and few there be that find it.”<a
name="FnAnchor152" href="#Footnote152"><span class="sp">152</span></a>
He also said: “There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many
are called, but few are chosen.”<a name="FnAnchor153"
href="#Footnote153"><span class="sp">153</span></a> Modern theology
pretends to be better informed. In Hastings’ <i>Encyclopædia of
Religion and Ethics</i> we read that New Testament teaching, taken as
a whole, suggests the salvation of the great bulk of mankind and <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page50"></a>50</span> reprobation as the rare
exception.<a name="FnAnchor154" href="#Footnote154"><span
class="sp">154</span></a> In support of this statement the author
quotes some inconclusive passages from John and Timothy and only one
from the synoptic gospels, namely the saying that “the Son of man is
come to save that which was lost.”<a name="FnAnchor155"
href="#Footnote155"><span class="sp">155</span></a> He is also very
optimistic as to the condition of the lost. He says that the general
principle of the judgment will be the loss of faculties which have
been abused, and continues: “It is not necessary to regard the
condition of the lost as absolutely intolerable, though, in contrast
with the bliss of the redeemed, it will appear most sad. Its sadness
will consist mainly in regret for the loss of the Beatific Vision, and
remorse for the criminal folly which has led to their degradation from
the rank of responsible beings. On the other hand, their condition may
admit of important alleviations. Thus they can sin no more, and will
perform the will of God unerringly, which will surely be for their
good. Moreover, their enjoyment of natural goods, though impaired,
will not be destroyed. In fact, it even seems possible to regard their
condition as one of relative happiness of a purely natural kind.”<a
name="FnAnchor156" href="#Footnote156"><span class="sp">156</span></a>
I should have thought that there could not be much enjoyment of
natural goods or happiness in the furnace of hell.</p>

<p>It is, however, nowadays a widespread opinion that Jesus did not
believe in fiery torment in hell. The statements referring to it in
the gospels are said to be either non-authentic&mdash;later glosses
added in oral tradition or by the evangelists<a name="FnAnchor157"
href="#Footnote157"><span class="sp">157</span></a>&mdash;or to be
interpreted in a figurative sense. It is argued that they are chiefly
found in the first gospel, “the Jewish gospel,” and are absent from
the parallel passages in the other gospels; but the fire of hell is
nevertheless mentioned also by Mark and Luke. Another
argument is that they are inconsistent with Jesus’ true and original
gospel of the love of God, which compels us to regard them as
metaphorical. But, as Dr. Cadoux remarks, “to have recourse to
figurative interpretation whenever Jesus’ words clash with modern
knowledge or belief, in order to maintain the complete conformity of
our beliefs with his words, is an unnatural and forced proceeding,
which does violence to the instinct of truth.”<a name="FnAnchor158"
href="#Footnote158"><span class="sp">158</span></a> The explanation of
the gospel passages concerning hell seems simple enough. It is
generally admitted that Jesus shared with his Jewish contemporaries
other beliefs <span class="pagenum"><a id="page51"></a>51</span> which
are now held untenable. The later pre-Christian Jewish writings
contain a variety of detailed descriptions of future punishment in
which torment and destruction by fire are constant features.<a
name="FnAnchor159" href="#Footnote159"><span class="sp">159</span></a>
Of particular importance is the passage in which Isaiah speaks of the
damnation of the wicked, when “the Lord will come with fire . . . to
render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames,” and of the
carcasses of the men that have transgressed against him; “for their
worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.”<a
name="FnAnchor160" href="#Footnote160"><span class="sp">160</span></a>
This passage is evidently the source of Mark’s reference to hell
“where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.”<a

<p>The immense bulk of Christians have naturally regarded hell and its
agonies as material facts. Origen, who was a Platonist and a heretic
in many respects, was severely censured for assuming that the souls of
the unpurified ones pass into a cleansing fire which is only temporary
and figurative, simply consisting in the torments of conscience;<a
name="FnAnchor162" href="#Footnote162"><span class="sp">162</span></a>
and in the ninth century Scotus Erigena showed unusual audacity in
questioning the locality of hell and the material tortures of the
condemned.<a name="FnAnchor163" href="#Footnote163"><span
class="sp">163</span></a> Some great Protestant divines, like Jeremy
Taylor and Jonathan Edwards, were anxious to point out that the fire
of hell is infinitely more painful than any fire on earth, being
“fierce enough to melt the very rocks and elements.”<a
name="FnAnchor164" href="#Footnote164"><span class="sp">164</span></a>
This awful punishment also exceeds in dreadfulness anything which even
the most vivid imagination can conceive, because it will last not for
a passing moment, nor for a year or a hundred, thousand, million, or
milliard years, but for ever and ever. In case any doubt should arise
as regards the physical capacity of the damned to withstand the heat,
we are assured by some reputed theologians that their bodies will be
annealed like glass or asbestos-like or of the nature of
salamanders,<a name="FnAnchor165" href="#Footnote165"><span
class="sp">165</span></a> which was already suggested by Augustine.<a
name="FnAnchor166" href="#Footnote166"><span class="sp">166</span></a>
It would seem that even the felicity of the few who were saved must be
seriously impaired by their contemplation of this endless and
undescribable misery, but we are told that the case is just the
reverse. They become <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page52"></a>52</span> as merciless as their god. Thomas Aquinas
says that a perfect sight of the punishment of the damned is granted
them that they “may enjoy their beatitude and the grace of God more
richly.”<a name="FnAnchor167" href="#Footnote167"><span
class="sp">167</span></a> And the Puritans, especially, have revelled
in the idea that “the sight of hell torments will exalt the happiness
of the saints for ever,” as a sense of the opposite misery always
increases the relish of any pleasure.<a name="FnAnchor168"

<p>It was only in the nineteenth century that, at last, a more
considerable number of Christians began to feel shocked by the ancient
doctrine of eternal punishment. Nowadays, according to Dr. Major, the
general belief in the English Church is “that the soul at death passes
into the spirit world, and never again has anything to do with its
fleshly integument, which has been deposited in the grave”; and a
conviction has grown up that heaven and hell are thought of not as
localities but as personal states, and that there is every degree of
purgatory between them.<a name="FnAnchor169" href="#Footnote169"><span
class="sp">169</span></a> Thus Mr. R. H. Charles has tried to show
that the fire spoken of by Jesus is not to be conceived sensuously,
but as a symbol of the divine wrath, and that the place of punishment
for the wicked is apparently a place of spiritual punishment only.<a
name="FnAnchor170" href="#Footnote170"><span class="sp">170</span></a>
Modern theology constantly falls back upon symbolism as an
interpretation of unpalatable statements found in the gospels. This,
it is said, safeguards the Saviour’s infallibility. But what about his
honesty? In the recent Report of the Commission on Christian Doctrine
appointed by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York it is argued that
eschatological beliefs are inevitably expressed in symbolical
language, being matters in respect of which “eye hath not seen, nor
ear heard,” and the essence of hell is described as “exclusion from
the fellowship of God.”<a name="FnAnchor171" href="#Footnote171"><span
class="sp">171</span></a> This implies that Jesus said what he did not
mean, but terrified the simple and ignorant people to whom he spoke,
and countless succeeding generations, by words which it has taken
nearly two thousand years for learned theologians to decipher.</p>

<p>As to the conception of the divine retribution for unrighteousness
there are important differences between the teaching of the gospels
and that of the Old Testament. According to the latter, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page53"></a>53</span> the judgment of God is
carried out in this life, according to the former predominantly after
death. Among the Jews the belief in a future state began only in
prophetic times, when it was clearly spoken of for the first time in
the following passage in the book of Daniel: “Many of them that sleep
in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and
some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall
shine as the brightness of the firmament.”<a name="FnAnchor172"
href="#Footnote172"><span class="sp">172</span></a> But belief in the
resurrection of individuals and a final judgment had become elements
of Jewish religion when Jesus was born.<a name="FnAnchor173"
href="#Footnote173"><span class="sp">173</span></a> The other
difference between the ideas of retribution in the Old Testament and
in the gospels was due to the Hebrew belief that sin affects the
nation through the individual and entails guilt on succeeding
generations. The anger of the Lord is kindled against the children of
Israel on account of Achan’s sin.<a name="FnAnchor174"
href="#Footnote174"><span class="sp">174</span></a> The sin of the
sons of Eli is visited on his whole house from generation to
generation.<a name="FnAnchor175" href="#Footnote175"><span
class="sp">175</span></a> Because Saul has slain the Gibeonites, the
Lord sends in the days of David a three years’ famine, which ceases
only when seven of Saul’s sons are hanged.<a name="FnAnchor176"
href="#Footnote176"><span class="sp">176</span></a> The notion of a
jealous God who visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him,<a
name="FnAnchor177" href="#Footnote177"><span class="sp">177</span></a>
is also frequently met with in the Old Testament Apocrypha.<a

<p>The infliction of penal suffering on guiltless persons in
consequence of the sins of others is contrary to the nature of moral
indignation, which, as a retributive emotion, is a hostile attitude of
mind towards a living being conceived as a cause of pain. The
retribution of a god is in many cases nothing but an outburst of
sudden anger, or an act of private revenge, and is as such
particularly liable to lack sufficient discrimination. It may also be
extended beyond the limits of individual guilt, because sin is looked
upon as a kind of material substance which may be transmitted from
parents to offspring. To this day the Jews in Morocco sometimes go on
their New Year’s Day to the seashore or to a spring and remove their
sins by throwing stones into the water. The words of the Psalmist,
“Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin,”<a
name="FnAnchor179" href="#Footnote179"><span class="sp">179</span></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page54"></a>54</span> were not altogether
a figure of speech. That sin is contagious was expressly stated by
Novatian, who said that “the one is defiled by the sin of the other,
and the idolatry of the transgressor passes over to him who does not
transgress.”<a name="FnAnchor180" href="#Footnote180"><span
class="sp">180</span></a> In this materialistic conception of sin
there is an obvious confusion between cause and effect, between the
sin and its punishment. This carries with it the idea that the
injurious energy inherent in sin will sooner or later discharge itself
to the discomfort or destruction of anybody who is affected with it.
The sick Chinese says of his sickness, “It is my sin,” instead of
saying, “It is the punishment of my sin”;<a name="FnAnchor181"
href="#Footnote181"><span class="sp">181</span></a> and both in Hebrew
and in the Vedic language the word for sin is used in a similar way.<a
name="FnAnchor182" href="#Footnote182"><span class="sp">182</span></a>
“In the consciousness of the pious Israelite,” says Schultz, “sin,
guilt, and punishment, are ideas so directly connected that the words
for them are interchangeable”; the prophets frequently and
emphatically declare that there is in sin itself a power which must
destroy the sinner.<a name="FnAnchor183" href="#Footnote183"><span
class="sp">183</span></a> Finally it should be noticed that while the
resentment of a man is a matter of experience, that of a god is a
matter of inference. That some particular case of suffering is a
divine punishment may therefore be assumed on the ground of the
conviction that a certain heinous sin cannot be left unpunished. When
the sinner himself escapes all punishment, leading a happy life till
his death, the conclusion is thus near at hand that any grave
misfortune which befalls his descendants is the delayed retribution of
the offended god.<a name="FnAnchor184" href="#Footnote184"><span
class="sp">184</span></a> Such a conclusion may especially force
itself upon a mind which has no idea of a hell with <i>post mortem</i>
punishments for the wicked.</p>

<p>But a moral consciousness which is sufficiently guided by
discrimination and sympathy cannot acquiesce in penal suffering being
inflicted upon the guiltless. Protests against it are heard from
different quarters both with reference to human justice and with
reference to the retribution of gods. Plato lays down the rule that
“the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to be visited on the
children.”<a name="FnAnchor185" href="#Footnote185"><span
class="sp">185</span></a> According to Roman law, “crimen vel poena
paterna nullam maculam filio infligere <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page55"></a>55</span> potest.”<a name="FnAnchor186"
href="#Footnote186"><span class="sp">186</span></a> The Deuteronomist
enjoins: “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man
shall be put to death for his own sin.”<a name="FnAnchor187"
href="#Footnote187"><span class="sp">187</span></a> And Jeremiah and
Ezekiel broke with the old notion of divine vengeance by extending the
law of individual responsibility to the sphere of religion. “Every one
shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape,
his teeth shall be set on edge.”<a name="FnAnchor188"
href="#Footnote188"><span class="sp">188</span></a> “The soul that
sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the
father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the
righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness
of the wicked shall be upon him.”<a name="FnAnchor189"

<p>While the belief in divine retribution after death favours the
acceptance of the principle of individual responsibility, it lays
itself open to criticism on the plea of being at variance with the
moral justification of punishment. The punishment which society
inflicts on a criminal is intrinsically an expression of its moral
indignation. For ages it was looked upon as a matter of course that a
person who has committed a crime should have to suffer for it because
he deserves to be punished. This is still the notion of the multitude,
as also of a host of theorisers, who by calling punishment an
expiation, or a reparation, or a restoration of the disturbed
equilibrium of justice, or some similar term, only endeavour to give
philosophical sanction to a social institution which is rooted in an
emotion. But the infliction of pain is not an act which the moral
consciousness regards with indifference even in the case of a
criminal; and to many enlightened minds with keen sympathy for human
suffering it has appeared both unreasonable and cruel that the State
should wilfully torment him to no purpose. It may certainly be thought
that men have no right to give vent to their moral resentment in a way
which hurts their neighbours, unless some benefit may be expected from
it. In the case of many other emotions we hold that the conative
element in the emotion ought not to be allowed to develop into a
distinct volition or act; and it would seem that a similar view might
be taken with reference to the aggressiveness of moral disapproval. It
is a notion of this kind that is at the bottom of the condemnation of
retributive punishment. But at the same time punishment itself is
defended. It is only looked upon in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page56"></a>56</span> a different light, not as an end in itself
but as the means of attaining an end. It is to be inflicted not
because wrong has been done, but in order that wrong be not done. Its
object is held to be either to deter from crime, or to reform the
criminal, or by means of elimination or seclusion to make it
physically impossible for him to commit fresh crimes.</p>
<p>A punishment inflicted after the death of the culprit cannot serve
the aim of eliminating a dangerous individual, because he can no
longer do any harm. Nor can it be of any use as a means of deterring
him from committing fresh crimes, because he is incapable of doing it.
Nor can it be supposed to have any reformatory effect of value to him
or to anybody else, if the punishment is eternal. The only thing that
may be gained by it is that the threat of it may intimidate the
living. In an earlier chapter I have drawn attention to certain facts
which seem to detract considerably from its usefulness in this
respect; but to inspire fear of damnation has certainly been a
prominent object of Christian moralists from the very beginning till
our own times, and not without some degree of success.<a

<p>On the other hand, as I have endeavoured to show in detail
elsewhere,<a name="FnAnchor191" href="#Footnote191"><span
class="sp">191</span></a> those theorists who think it possible to
make punishment independent of moral resentment are victims of an
illusion. Whether they are advocates of the theory of determent or the
theory of reformation, it has escaped them that they themselves are
under the influence of the very principle they reject, because they
have failed to grasp its true import. Rightly understood, resentment
is preventive in its nature; it is not only aroused by pain, but is a
hostile attitude towards its cause, and its tendency is to remove this
cause. And it may aim at its removal by bringing about repentance in
the offender, which is the reformationists’ object of punishment. Thus
resentment not only gives rise to punishment, but readily suggests as
its proper end either determent or amendment or both. But first of all
moral resentment raises a protest against wrong. And whatever
theorists may say on the matter, the immediate aim of punishment has
always been to give expression to the righteous indignation of the
society which inflicts it.</p>

<p>The dependence of punishment upon moral resentment also shows
itself in the fact that its degree is influenced by the degree of the
resentment. Though a severe punishment may be the most effective
deterrent, our feelings object to its application if the crime is
slight; and in any case they put a limit to the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page57"></a>57</span> intensity of suffering to
be inflicted upon a criminal, whatever his crime may be. In former
times burning was a penalty for certain offences which were considered
particularly atrocious, but it is utterly revolting to the moral
consciousness of modern men. Yet its agonies lasted only for a few
minutes. What, then, shall we say of the everlasting torments in the
furnace of hell as a punishment even for persons who “desire to walk
in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest
seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; which devour
widows’ houses, and for a shew make long prayers”?<a

The only thing which can be said in excuse of them is that their
horror is never clearly perceived by any one who predicts them.</p>

<p>Side by side with the doctrine of retribution there is in the
gospels the message of forgiveness. John the Baptist preached the
baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, “and there went out
unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all
baptised of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.” And he
preached, saying: “There cometh one mightier than I after me, the
latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. I
indeed have baptised you with water: but he shall baptise you with the
Holy Ghost.”<a name="FnAnchor193" href="#Footnote193"><span
class="sp">193</span></a> “After that John was put in prison, Jesus
came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, And
saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:

<p>That repentance is followed by forgiveness is found in other
religions besides Christianity. According to Zoroastrianism, one
element of atonement consists in repentance, as manifested by avowal
of the guilt and by the recital of a formula, the <i>Patet</i>.<a
name="FnAnchor198" href="#Footnote198"><span class="sp">198</span></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page58"></a>58</span> It is said in the
Laws of Manu: “In proportion as a man who has done wrong, himself
confesses it, even so far he is freed from guilt, as a snake from its
slough. . . . He who has committed a sin and has repented, is freed
from that sin, but he is purified only by the resolution of ceasing to
sin and thinking ‘I will do so no more.’”<a name="FnAnchor199"
href="#Footnote199"><span class="sp">199</span></a> According to the
Rig-Veda, the god Varuna inflicts terrible punishments on the hardened
criminal, but is merciful to him who repents; to Varuna, the cry of
anguish from remorse ascends, and before him the sinner comes to
discharge himself of the burden of his guilt by confession.<a
name="FnAnchor200" href="#Footnote200"><span class="sp">200</span></a>
So, also, Zeus pardons the repentant.<a name="FnAnchor201"
href="#Footnote201"><span class="sp">201</span></a> The main doctrine
of Judaism on the subject of atonement is comprised in the single word
Repentance. No teachers, says Montefiore, “exalted the place and power
of repentance more than the Rabbis. There was no sin for which in
their eyes a true repentance could not obtain forgiveness from God.”<a
name="FnAnchor202" href="#Footnote202"><span class="sp">202</span></a>
According to the Talmud, a space of only two fingers’ breadth lies
between hell and heaven: the sinner has only to repent sincerely, and
the gates to everlasting bliss will spring open.<a name="FnAnchor203"

<p>But repentance not only blunts the edge of moral indignation and
recommends the offender to the mercy of men and gods: it is the sole
ground on which pardon can be given by a scrupulous judge. When
sufficiently guided by deliberation and left to itself, without being
unduly checked by other emotions, the feeling of moral resentment is
apt to last as long as its cause remains unaltered, that is, until the
will of the offender has ceased to be offensive; and it ceases to be
offensive only when he acknowledges his guilt and repents. It is true
that the mere performance of certain ceremonies is frequently supposed
to relieve the performer of his sin,<a name="FnAnchor204"
href="#Footnote204"><span class="sp">204</span></a> and the same end
is thought to be attained by pleasing God in some way or other, by
sacrifice, or almsgiving, or the like. But such ideas are
objectionable to the moral consciousness of a higher type. They are
based on the crude notion that sin is a material <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page59"></a>59</span> substance which may be
removed by material means; or on the belief that an offender may
compound with the deity for sinning against him, in the same way as he
pacifies his injured neighbour, by bribery or flattery. Hence the
Reformation proscribed offerings for the redemption of sins, together
with the trade in indulgences; and we meet with an analogous movement
in other comparatively advanced forms of religion. In reformed
Brahmanism repentance is declared to be the only means of redeeming
trespasses.<a name="FnAnchor205" href="#Footnote205"><span
class="sp">205</span></a> The idea expressed in the Psalms, that God
delights not in burnt offerings, but that the sacrifices of God are a
broken and a contrite heart,<a name="FnAnchor206"
href="#Footnote206"><span class="sp">206</span></a> became the
prevailing opinion among the Rabbis, most of whom regarded repentance
as the <i>conditio sine quâ non</i> of expiation and the forgiveness
of sins.<a name="FnAnchor207" href="#Footnote207"><span

<p>That moral indignation is appeased by repentance, and that
repentance is the only proper ground for forgiveness, is due, not to
the specifically moral character of such indignation, but to its being
a form of resentment. This is confirmed by the fact that an angry and
revengeful man is apt to be in a similar way influenced by the sincere
apology of the offender. As Aristotle said, men are placable in regard
to those who acknowledge and repent their guilt: “there is proof of
this in the case of chastising servants; for we chastise more
violently those who contradict us, and deny their guilt; but towards
such as acknowledge themselves to be justly punished we cease from our
wrath.”<a name="FnAnchor208" href="#Footnote208"><span
class="sp">208</span></a> In the case of revenge external satisfaction
or material compensation is often allowed to take the place of genuine
repentance, and the humiliation of the adversary may be sufficient to
quiet the angry passion. But the revenge felt by a reflecting mind is
not so readily satisfied. It wants to remove the cause which aroused
it. The object which resentment is chiefly intent upon, Adam Smith
observes, “is not so much to make our enemy feel pain in his turn, as
to make him conscious that he feels it upon account of his past
conduct, to make him repent of that conduct, and to make him sensible,
that the person whom he injured did not deserve to be treated in that
manner.”<a name="FnAnchor209" href="#Footnote209"><span
class="sp">209</span></a> The delight of revenge, says Bacon, “seemeth
to be not so much in doing the hurt, as in making the party repent.”<a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page60"></a>60</span> While Jesus was
capable of feeling intense moral indignation, his emotion of moral
approval, of which moral praise or reward is the outward
manifestation, plays an even more prominent part in his teaching, as
is shown by the innumerable cases in which eternal reward is promised
for righteousness. Modern theologians have been disconcerted by this
fact and tried to minimise it. They have said that the hope of reward
and consequently a eudemonistic motive “sometimes” is found in the
teaching of Jesus;<a name="FnAnchor211" href="#Footnote211"><span
class="sp">211</span></a> that “it cannot be denied that the idea of
reward and punishment now and then peeps out from the context of
Christian ethics”;<a name="FnAnchor212" href="#Footnote212"><span

appeal to self-interest.”<a name="FnAnchor213"

<p>As it, after all, cannot be denied that the gospels contain
promises of reward, attempts have been made to extenuate their
presence. It is said that they serve a “pedagogical” purpose being
intended to influence people with a moral consciousness of an inferior
type;<a name="FnAnchor214" href="#Footnote214"><span
class="sp">214</span></a> that Jesus for this reason made use of an
idea which was prevalent in Jewish thought, but in such a way as to
abolish it “by transforming the reward into a gift of love, which
transcends the claims that can be raised by the worker”;<a
name="FnAnchor215" href="#Footnote215"><span class="sp">215</span></a>
that the gospels speak of reward not to make people desirous of it,
but to teach people that righteousness is pleasing to God, and must be
followed by reward. When the world shows itself hostile to the good
man, this belief serves <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page63"></a>63</span> to cheer and comfort him and make him
persevere and progress in goodness.<a name="FnAnchor216"
href="#Footnote216"><span class="sp">216</span></a> This seems to be
the general doctrine in Lutheran theology. But Luther admits that such
an unselfish belief is hardly ever found in actual Christendom.<a

<p>It is easy to see why Christian theologians are perplexed by the
promises of rewards in the gospels. Moral judgments are influenced by
the motives of conduct. They are passed on intentions and deliberate
wishes and the motive of an act may itself be an intention or
deliberate wish but one referring to another act. When Brutus helped
to kill Cæsar in order to save his country, his intention or
deliberate wish, or hope, to save it was the reason, and therefore the
motive, for his intention to kill Cæsar. But if we more carefully
analyse our moral judgments, we find that they are not really passed
on intentions or deliberate wishes in the abstract, but on the persons
who have them: <em>they</em> are held blamable or worthy of praise on
account of their intentions or wishes, because the moral emotions are
reactionary attitudes towards living beings. Now we do not feel the
emotion of moral approval or retributive kindliness towards a person
if we recognise that he does a thing only in the selfish hope of being
benefited by it, for example, if he saves another person from drowning
merely because he expects a reward for it. The reason for this is not
the specifically moral character of moral approval, but the fact of
its being a retributive emotion. We do not feel grateful either to a
person who bestows a benefit upon us, if we find that he does it only
in his own interest.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, however, moral judgments are commonly passed
on acts without much regard being paid to their motives. Moral
indignation and moral approval are in the first place aroused by
conspicuous facts, and whilst intentions are expressed in the acts
themselves, their motives are not. Men desire that certain acts shall
be performed, and other acts refrained from. The motives, or conative
causes of acts and forbearances are not equally interesting, and they
are often mixed, uncertain, and hidden. As a mediæval writer puts it,
“the devil himself knoweth not the thought of man.”<a
name="FnAnchor218" href="#Footnote218"><span class="sp">218</span></a>
Though we would not praise a person for some deed which we clearly
recognise to reflect no merit on his will, the benefit which results
from a good act easily induces us to exaggerate the goodness, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64"></a>64</span> agent. On the other
hand, it is success alone that confers upon a man the full reward
which he deserves; good intentions without corresponding deeds meet
with little applause even when the failure is due to mere misfortune.
But it is only from ignorance or want of due reflection that moral
judgments are influenced by outward deeds. Owing to its very nature
the moral consciousness, when sufficiently thoughtful, regards the
will as the only proper object of moral disapproval or moral
praise.</p>

<p>The teaching of Jesus certainly laid stress on the motives of
conduct. It has been described as an ethic of inwardness: “he rebukes
acquisitiveness rather than wealth, lust rather than adultery, hatred
rather than war or violence.”<a name="FnAnchor219"
href="#Footnote219"><span class="sp">219</span></a> He condemned the
Pharisees, whose leaven was hypocrisy,<a name="FnAnchor220"
href="#Footnote220"><span class="sp">220</span></a> who for a pretence
made long prayer, who made clean the outside of the cup and the
platter, but whose inward part was full of wickedness.<a
name="FnAnchor221" href="#Footnote221"><span class="sp">221</span></a>
He said: “That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. For
from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
adulteries, fornications, murders, Thefts, covetousness, wickedness,
deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”<a
name="FnAnchor222" href="#Footnote222"><span class="sp">222</span></a>
But in breaking with Pharisaism on the point of its mechanical
conception of duty Jesus reverted, in fact, to the position taken up
by the Prophets of Israel, whose teachings he must often have listened
to in the synagogue at Nazareth.<a name="FnAnchor223"
href="#Footnote223"><span class="sp">223</span></a> “The Lord said,
Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their
lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their
fear towards me is taught by the precept of men: Therefore, behold, I
will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a
marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall
perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.”<a
name="FnAnchor224" href="#Footnote224"><span class="sp">224</span></a>
“Thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your
fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the
Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and
inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn
that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. . . . O
Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page65"></a>65</span> mayest be saved.”<a
name="FnAnchor225" href="#Footnote225"><span class="sp">225</span></a>
“Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit.”<a

In the rabbinical literature few sayings are quoted more frequently
than the adage which closes those tractates of the Mishna which deal
with the sacrificial law: “He that brings few offerings is as he that
brings many; let his heart be directed heavenward.”<a

<p>That moral qualities are internal has indeed been recognised by all
great moralists. Confucius required an inward sincerity in all outward
practice, and poured scorn on the Pharisaism which contented itself
with cleaning the outside of the cup and platter.<a name="FnAnchor231"
href="#Footnote231"><span class="sp">231</span></a> He said that “in
the rites of mourning exceeding grief with deficient rites is better
than little demonstration of grief with superabounding rites; and that
in those of sacrifice exceeding reverence with deficient rites is
better than an excess of rites with but little reverence.”<a
name="FnAnchor232" href="#Footnote232"><span class="sp">232</span></a>
“Sacrifice is not a thing coming to a man from without; it issues from
within him, and has its birth in his heart. When the heart is deeply
moved, expression is given to it by ceremonies.”<a name="FnAnchor233"
href="#Footnote233"><span class="sp">233</span></a> The virtuous man
offers his sacrifices “without seeking for anything to be gained by
them.”<a name="FnAnchor234" href="#Footnote234"><span
class="sp">234</span></a> “The Master said: ‘See what a man does, mark
his motives.’”<a name="FnAnchor235" href="#Footnote235"><span
class="sp">235</span></a> The popular Taoist work called ‘The Book of
Secret Blessings’ inculcates the necessity of purifying the heart as a
preparation for all right-doing; and in another Taoist work it is
written: “If you form in your heart a good intention, although you may
not have done any good, the good spirits follow you. If you form in
your heart a bad intention, although you may not have done any harm,
the evil spirits follow you.”<a name="FnAnchor236"
href="#Footnote236"><span class="sp">236</span></a> One of the Pahlavi
texts puts the following <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page66"></a>66</span> words into the mouth of the Spirit of
Wisdom: “To be grateful in the world, and to wish happiness for every
one; this is greater and better than every good work.”<a

The religious legislator of Brahmanism, whilst assuming in accordance
with the popular view that the fulfilment of religious duty will
always be rewarded to some extent, whatever may be the motive,
maintains that the man who fulfils his duties without regard to the
rewards which follow the fulfilment, will enjoy the highest happiness
in this life and eternal happiness hereafter.<a name="FnAnchor238"
href="#Footnote238"><span class="sp">238</span></a> “He who is pure in
heart is the truest priest,” said Buddha.<a name="FnAnchor239"
href="#Footnote239"><span class="sp">239</span></a> According to
‘Dhammapada,’ “if a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain
follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the
carriage. . . . If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness
follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.”<a

In his description of the Buddhists of Mongolia the Rev. James Gilmour
observes: “Mongol priests recognise the power of motive in estimating
actions. . . . The attitude of the mind decides the nature of the act.

presented a gift quite as acceptable as the most magnificent of

<p>Although Jesus insisted on inwardness and purity of heart, there is
no indication that he regarded the hope of reward as an obstacle to
gaining it. How could anybody make a promise and at the same time
require that it should not influence the conduct of the promisee?
There is no inconsistency between benevolence being the immediate
spring of action and the hope of reward being the ultimate motive for
it: a person may aim at his own happiness as his ultimate end and at
the same time aim sincerely at the happiness of his neighbour as a
means to that end. Kant said that “morality is not properly the
doctrine how we should make ourselves happy, but how we should become
worthy of happiness.”<a name="FnAnchor242" href="#Footnote242"><span
class="sp">242</span></a> But then he placed the virtuous man in a
most precarious position. Even though he know that he is worthy of
happiness, and even may hope to participate in it,<a
name="FnAnchor243" href="#Footnote243"><span class="sp">243</span></a>
he must not allow any such hope to slip in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page67"></a>67</span> as a motive for his conduct; for if he does
so, he ceases to be virtuous and will not get the happiness he hopes
for.</p>

<p>This was not the teaching of Jesus. To desire to gain divine
favour, with everything implied in it, must certainly have been
regarded by him as a right motive for our conduct. But then it cannot
be said that there is in his message “no support for a hedonistic
ethic.”<a name="FnAnchor244" href="#Footnote244"><span
class="sp">244</span></a> He represents heaven as a place where his
followers will receive ample compensation for all their present
suffering.<a name="FnAnchor245" href="#Footnote245"><span
class="sp">245</span></a> They will enjoy the company of the great and
good of former ages. Jesus will be there himself, in glory, to welcome
them into everlasting habitations, and they will see God, the Father
who is in heaven, face to face. They will have their old bodies,<a
name="FnAnchor246" href="#Footnote246"><span class="sp">246</span></a>
and Jesus does not even scruple to throw into the picture a dash of
material felicity, speaking of the drinking of wine in his Father’s
kingdom.<a name="FnAnchor247" href="#Footnote247"><span
class="sp">247</span></a> There is, however, this difference,
mentioned in all the synoptic gospels,<a name="FnAnchor248"

of resurrection will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but be as

<p>The ethics of Jesus are not only hedonism, but egoistic hedonism,
as defined by Sidgwick, that is, “a system which prescribes actions as
means to the end of the individual’s happiness or pleasure.”<a
name="FnAnchor250" href="#Footnote250"><span class="sp">250</span></a>
It cannot be said that the section of eighteenth-century hedonists who
supported their theory by theological considerations<a
name="FnAnchor251" href="#Footnote251"><span class="sp">251</span></a>
contradicted the teaching of Jesus, when they looked upon self-love as
the ground for accepting the will of God as our rule; nor that
Waterland did so in his ‘Sermon on Self-Love,’ in which he said: “The
wisest course for any man to take is to secure an interest in the life
to come. . . . There can be no excess of fondness, or self-indulgence,
in respect of eternal happiness. This is loving himself in the best
manner, and to the best purposes. All virtue and piety are thus
resolvable into a principle of self-love. . . . It is with reference
to ourselves, and for our own sakes, that we love even God himself.”<a
name="FnAnchor252" href="#Footnote252"><span class="sp">252</span></a>
Paley defined virtue bluntly as “the doing good to mankind, in
obedience to the will of God, and for the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page68"></a>68</span> sake of everlasting happiness.”<a
name="FnAnchor253" href="#Footnote253"><span class="sp">253</span></a>
This motive is in agreement with Augustine’s saying that in the
heavenly city “there is only the piety that serves the true God and
expects a reward.”<a name="FnAnchor254" href="#Footnote254"><span

<p>The most authoritative description of the ethics of Jesus as
egoistic hedonism comes from a theologian of the highest repute,
Nathan Söderblom, the late Archbishop of Sweden. He wrote in his book
on the Sermon on the Mount: “If it is asked <em>why</em> everything
which is commanded in the Sermon on the Mount is to be done, why we
ought to love our enemies, not to put away our wife, and so forth, the
ultimate answer, according to Jesus, is not, for the common good or
progress of mankind, but the only uniform and satisfactory explanation
of his whole ethics and injunction of piety runs: in order to save our
soul. The infinite value of the individual human soul is the leading
idea in the Sermon on the Mount and the whole message of Jesus. To
this fact many of the moderns are perfectly blind.” Jesus does not
advocate “a careful weighing of one’s own good against the good of
others, but a ruthless egoism: build thou <i>thy</i> house upon a rock, so
that it shall stand when the floods come and the winds blow.”<a
name="FnAnchor255" href="#Footnote255"><span
class="sp">255</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote255"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor255"><sup>255</sup></a></span> Söderblom, <i><span
class="ib" title="Jesu bärgspredikan och vår tid">op. cit.</span></i>
p. 43.</p></div>

<p>Another well-known Swedish theologian, professor Nygren, says on
the contrary that “the evangelical ethics are the most
anti-eudemonistic of all ethical theories,”<a name="FnAnchor256"
href="#Footnote256"><span class="sp">256</span></a> and even goes so
far as to allege that according to the teaching of Jesus (as well as
that of Paul) God’s relations to the human beings are in no way
influenced by their behaviour, but depend exclusively upon the nature
of his love, which is “spontaneous” or “prompted by no motive.”<a
name="FnAnchor257" href="#Footnote257"><span class="sp">257</span></a>
In support of this allegation he quotes repeatedly the saying, “I came
not to call the righteous, but sinners”;<a name="FnAnchor258"
href="#Footnote258"><span class="sp">258</span></a> Luke adds:
“to repentance.”<a name="FnAnchor259" href="#Footnote259"><span
class="sp">259</span></a> This has been said to be clearly a gloss,
since there is no notion at all that Jesus had brought with him into
the world any new way of procuring forgiveness of sins but that of
repentance.<a name="FnAnchor260" href="#Footnote260"><span
class="sp">260</span></a> It has been pointed out that the prodigal
son in the parable is <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page69"></a>69</span> nearer his father than the elder brother,
and that there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth
than over ninety-nine just men. But the prodigal son showed his
repentance in thought and in word and in act; and while we do not
generally feel any positive pleasure because a person acts rightly, it
is different when a sinner repents. Even Luther, whose authority is
appealed to for the doctrine that God’s love is prompted by no motive,
demanded in the first of his ninety-nine theses that a Christian’s
whole life should be a continuous penitential act.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV</h4>
<h3>THE ETHICS OF JESUS: THEIR DISINTERESTEDNESS AND ALTRUISM</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">W</span><span class="smcap">HILE</span> Jesus’ doctrine of punishment and
reward is an outcome of the retributive character of the moral
emotions, his teaching also emphasises that disinterestedness which
distinguishes them from other, non-moral, retributive emotions. This
he does in his enunciation of the “Golden Rule”: “All things
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
them”;<a name="FnAnchor264" href="#Footnote264"><span
class="sp">264</span></a> or “As ye would that men should do to you,
do ye also to them likewise.”<a name="FnAnchor265"
href="#Footnote265"><span class="sp">265</span></a> The
disinterestedness of the moral emotions also finds an echo in the
rebuke: “Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? . . . Thou
hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then
shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s
eye.”<a name="FnAnchor266" href="#Footnote266"><span

<p>The Golden Rule is much older than Christianity and, especially in
its negative form, widespread. In the Sanskrit work ‘Mahabharata’ it
is said: “Let no man do to another that which would be repugnant to
himself; this is the sum of righteousness; the rest is according to
inclination. In refusing, in bestowing, in regard to pleasure and to
pain, to what is agreeable and disagreeable, a man obtains the proper
rule by regarding the case as like his own.”<a name="FnAnchor267"
href="#Footnote267"><span class="sp">267</span></a> Similar words are
ascribed to Confucius. When Tsze-kung asked if there is any one word
which may serve as a rule of practice for all one’s life, the Master
answered: “Is not Reciprocity such a word? What you do not want done
to yourself, do not do to others.” And in another utterance Confucius
showed that the rule had for him not only a negative, but also a
positive form. He said that, in the way of the superior man, there are
four things to none of which he himself had as yet attained: to serve
his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page71"></a>71</span> father as he
would require his son to serve him, to serve his prince as he would
require his minister to serve him, to serve his elder brother as he
would require his younger brother to serve him, and to set the example
in behaving to a friend as he would require the friend to behave to
him.<a name="FnAnchor268" href="#Footnote268"><span
class="sp">268</span></a> In Greece Isocrates enunciated the maxim:
“Do not do to others that which angers you when they do it to you.”<a
name="FnAnchor269" href="#Footnote269"><span class="sp">269</span></a>
Aristotle, when questioned how we should behave to our friends, is
quoted by Diogenes Laertius as saying: “Exactly as we would they
should behave to us.”<a name="FnAnchor270" href="#Footnote270"><span
class="sp">270</span></a> Seneca wrote: “Let us put ourselves in the
place of him with whom we are angry. . . . We are quite willing to do
to others what we cannot endure should be done to ourselves”;<a
name="FnAnchor271" href="#Footnote271"><span class="sp">271</span></a>
and Epictetus: “That which thou wouldst not suffer thyself, seek not
to lay upon others.”<a name="FnAnchor272" href="#Footnote272"><span
class="sp">272</span></a> In its negative form the Golden Rule is also
found in the earlier Judaism. Tobit said to his son: “Take heed to
thyself, my child, in all thy works, and be discreet in thy behaviour;
what thou thyself hatest, do to no man.”<a name="FnAnchor273"
href="#Footnote273"><span class="sp">273</span></a> When a heathen
came to the famous rabbi Hillel and said to him that he would embrace
Judaism on condition that he were taught the whole doctrine during the
time that he stood on one leg, the rabbi replied: “What thou doest not
like, do not do to thy neighbour; that is the whole doctrine, all the
rest is only explanation.”<a name="FnAnchor274"
href="#Footnote274"><span class="sp">274</span></a> According to
Augustine the precept that we must not do to others what we do not
wish them to do to us, is a rule of behaviour which is by nature
inherent in the human mind;<a name="FnAnchor275"
href="#Footnote275"><span class="sp">275</span></a> and Hobbes speaks
of the “laws of nature” expressed in “this one sentence, approved by
all the world, Do not that to another, which thou thinkest
unreasonable to be done by another to thy selfe.”<a name="FnAnchor276"
href="#Footnote276"><span class="sp">276</span></a> They were
perfectly right for the simple reason that disinterestedness is an
essential characteristic of the moral emotions, without which there
could be no moral precepts at all.</p>

literature outside the gospels. In this negative form it is already
attached to the Apostolic Decree as early as the Western text to the
Acts xv. 29, dating from the opening years of the second century if
not from a still earlier period, and, in spite of its absence from the
received text, it continued to hold a place in this passage of the
Acts down to a comparatively late date.<a name="FnAnchor277"

is also observable in post-Biblical Christian writings.<a

<p>It is not difficult to explain why the negative Golden Rule is more
widely spread than the positive one. Negative commandments spring from
the disapproval of acts, whereas positive commandments spring from the
disapproval of forbearances or omissions, and the indignation of men
is much more easily aroused by action than by absence of action. A
person who commits a harmful deed is a more obvious cause of pain than
a person who causes harm by doing nothing, and this naturally affects
the question of guilt in the eyes of most people. Moreover, the Golden
Rule implies that it cannot be right for A to treat B in a manner in
which it would be wrong for B to treat A, unless there is some
difference between the natures or circumstances of the two individuals
which can be regarded as a reasonable ground for difference of
treatment; and such differences are generally more restricted in the
case of acts that are forbidden than in the case of acts that are
positively enjoined. The negative commandments are also more distinct:
they condemn certain definite modes of behaviour, while the rules of
benevolence often are more comprehensive. It seems that almost from
the outset the rule of the gospels was in need of explanation and some
limitation. In certain Latin versions the words “good things” were
inserted after the word “whatsoever.” Those who made the insertion
recognised evidently that it is not everything which we may wish for
ourselves that we are bound to do for others. We might wish for
ourselves, for instance, some form of illicit or undesirable pleasure,
and yet cannot be bound to provide for others such pleasure or assist
them in obtaining it for themselves.<a name="FnAnchor279"
href="#Footnote279"><span class="sp">279</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote279"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor279"><sup>279</sup></a></span> <i><span class="ib" title="W. A. Spooner, ‘Golden

<p>The disinterestedness of the moral emotions partly underlies the
rule, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,” which <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page73"></a>73</span> occurs both in the Old
Testament<a name="FnAnchor280" href="#Footnote280"><span
class="sp">280</span></a> and in the three synoptic gospels.<a
name="FnAnchor281" href="#Footnote281"><span class="sp">281</span></a>
But this maxim contains much more than the disinterestedness of the
conception of duty. When a person pronounces an act right or wrong, it
implies that it is so <i>ceteris paribus</i>, whether he does it to
another or another does it to him, but this has nothing to do with the
particular nature of the act. When my own interests clash with those
of my neighbour, I may have the right to prefer my own lesser good to
the greater good of another, but only on condition that the other
person also, in similar circumstances, is admitted to have the right
to prefer his own lesser good to my greater good. No such right to
prefer one’s own lesser good to the greater good of another is
recognised in the precept, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself”;
but this precept owes its origin to the strength of the altruistic
sentiment in him who laid down the rule, and not merely to the
disinterestedness of his moral emotions.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote280"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor280"><sup>280</sup></a></span> <i>Leviticus</i> xix.
18.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote281"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor281"><sup>281</sup></a></span> <i>Matthew</i> xix. 19,
xxii. 39; <i>Mark</i> xii. 31; <i>Luke</i> x. 27.</p></div>

<p>The precept inculcating love of one’s neighbour is rooted in the
altruistic sentiment, which, as I have pointed out above, has produced
moral emotions, as distinguished from other retributive emotions not
only by their disinterestedness, but also by their impartiality in
other respects. Now the altruistic sentiment varies greatly both in
strength and expanse, and so does consequently the love of neighbour
which is prescribed as a duty by different moral codes. The groups of
neighbours to which these rules refer may vary indefinitely, without
interfering with the impartiality required by the moral emotions from
which they sprang. If it is considered wrong of a person to cheat
another belonging to his own group but not wrong to cheat a foreigner,
the impartiality of the moral emotion of disapproval, which underlies
the concept of wrongness, merely leads to a general rule that applies
to all similar cases independently of the nationality of him who holds
the view. If I maintain that a foreigner, or a member of another class
in my own society, has a duty towards me but that I have not the same
duty towards him, my opinion can be morally justified only on
condition that there is some difference in the circumstances affecting
the morality of the case. The impartiality of my moral emotions does
not prevent me from promoting the welfare of my own family or country
in preference to that of other families or countries. But they tell me
that I must allow anybody else to show a similar preference for <em>his</em>
family or country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page74"></a>74</span> The question is,
then, who is my neighbour whom I ought to love as myself? This
question was put to Jesus by a lawyer who asked him what he should do
to inherit eternal life. Jesus answered him by telling the parable of
the traveller who fell among thieves and was left half dead, of the
priest and the Levite who passed by on the other side, and of the good
Samaritan who took care of the wounded man; and he then asked the
lawyer which of those three he thought was “neighbour unto him that
fell among the thieves? And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then
said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.”<a name="FnAnchor282"
href="#Footnote282"><span class="sp">282</span></a> This has been
alleged to prove that in the thought of Jesus the idea of neighbour
had lost all such limitations as in the earlier Jewish interpretation
were imposed by national animosity, and embraced all men irrespective
of race. Much significance has also been attached to the word “men” in
the passage, “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to
you, do ye even so to them” (<i>Matthew</i> vii. 12),<a
name="FnAnchor283" href="#Footnote283"><span class="sp">283</span></a>
and to the word “whosoever” in the passage, “Whosoever shall do the
will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and
sister, and mother” (<i>ibid.</i> xii. 50; <i>Mark</i> iii. 35).<a
name="FnAnchor284" href="#Footnote284"><span class="sp">284</span></a>
As to the alleged implications of these two passages, it must be said
to be a poor case that is considered to need the support of such
strained interpretations; indeed, the latter of them directly contains
an important limitation. And the parable of a Samaritan who takes pity
on a wounded stranger is scarcely a clear answer to the question: Who
is my neighbour whom I should love as myself?</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is good evidence in the gospels that Jesus
had not entirely discarded Jewish exclusiveness in these matters. He
seems to have felt himself as one who had come with a message to the
people of Israel. When he sent out his disciples as travelling
apostles, he “commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the
Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: But go
rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as ye go, preach,
saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.”<a name="FnAnchor285"
href="#Footnote285"><span class="sp">285</span></a> Again, a
Syrophœnician woman came from the environs of Tyre, “and cried unto
him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter
is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And
his disciples came and besought him, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page75"></a>75</span> saying, Send her away; for she crieth after
us. But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of
the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
help me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.” When the woman, admitting
the truth of this, made the remark that the dogs eat of the crumbs
which fall from their masters’ table, Jesus “answered and said unto
her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.”
And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.<a
name="FnAnchor286" href="#Footnote286"><span class="sp">286</span></a>
By the children whose bread should not be cast to the dogs, Jesus
obviously meant the Jews.<a name="FnAnchor287"
href="#Footnote287"><span class="sp">287</span></a> It was to Jewish
sinners that Jesus addressed himself; his life was spent in wandering
over the narrow strip of ground between Capernaum and Jerusalem. He is
sometimes represented as speaking of the gospel being preached “among
all nations,” or “throughout the whole world,” or “to every
creature”;<a name="FnAnchor288" href="#Footnote288"><span
class="sp">288</span></a> but these utterances are scarcely congruous
with his belief in the imminence of the end of the world.<a
name="FnAnchor289" href="#Footnote289"><span class="sp">289</span></a>
As Dean Rashdall observes, “there is no critically unassailable
evidence that he ever spoke of actually converting the world to his
gospel or making gentiles into members of a worldwide Church.”<a

<p>It has been argued that the belief in a common divine fatherhood
compels us to regard every man as a neighbour whom we ought to love as
ourselves. Among the Jews their common descent from Abraham was always
felt to bind them together in mutual obligations. The novelty
introduced by Jesus, we are told, lies in the fact that he grounded
such obligations on a common descent from God: “by substituting the
Father in Heaven for father Abraham, Christ made morality universal.
This phrase, which places not a certain number of men, but all men, in
the relation of brotherhood to each other, destroys at once the
partition-wall between Jew and Gentile, Greek and barbarian.”<a
name="FnAnchor291" href="#Footnote291"><span class="sp">291</span></a>
Mr. Hirst writes: “Since the love of God is a Father’s love, man,
being God’s child, must love <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page76"></a>76</span> him with filial devotion and other men as
brothers.”<a name="FnAnchor292" href="#Footnote292"><span
class="sp">292</span></a> And Bishop Bohlin maintains not only that
the principle of a human brotherhood is derived from that of the
fatherhood of God, but even that without their belief in God as a
Father the Christians could never have formed the idea of a common
human brotherhood.<a name="FnAnchor293" href="#Footnote293"><span
class="sp">293</span></a> As a matter of fact, however, we find in the
gospels neither the belief in a common divine fatherhood nor the idea
of a common human brotherhood.</p>

<p>By careful study of the passages in the New Testament in which God
is spoken of as a Father, Professor Mead has found that he is called
so with reference either to Christ in particular or to Christ’s
believers. When Jesus is especially addressing the Pharisees or others
who are not in sympathy with him, he never calls God their Father. He
nowhere distinctly declares that the fatherhood of God is universal,
but he is recorded distinctly to assert that it is not universal. When
certain of the Jews, in their dispute with Jesus, said to him: “We be
not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God,” he replied:
“If God were your Father, ye would love me. . . . Ye are of your
father the devil.”<a name="FnAnchor294" href="#Footnote294"><span
class="sp">294</span></a> Again, when we examine the New Testament
passages which speak of men as the sons or children of God, we find
that the gospels, and particularly the words of Jesus as recorded
there, present not a single declaration to the effect that all men are
children of God. Wherever the conception is found, it clearly and
unmistakably is limited to a portion of mankind. On one occasion Jesus
said that those who love their enemies become the children of the
heavenly Father.<a name="FnAnchor295" href="#Footnote295"><span
class="sp">295</span></a> Paul said: “As many as are led by the Spirit
of God, they are the sons of God.”<a name="FnAnchor296"

<p>Nor do we find in the gospels the notion of a universal
brotherhood. In a passage quoted above Jesus says that his brother is
he who does the will of God.<a name="FnAnchor297"
href="#Footnote297"><span class="sp">297</span></a> John puts into his
mouth a saying in which he enjoins on his disciples brotherly love of
a very narrow compass: “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye
love one another; as I have loved you, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page77"></a>77</span> that ye also love one another. By this all
men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one to another.”<a
name="FnAnchor298" href="#Footnote298"><span class="sp">298</span></a>
It has been pointed out that the prevalent sense of <span class="transl" title="a)delpho/s"><i>ἀδελφός</i></span>
 in the New Testament is that of “fellow-Christian”&mdash;a
restricted meaning which is sometimes markedly imposed by the
immediate context<a name="FnAnchor299" href="#Footnote299"><span
class="sp">299</span></a>&mdash;and that the love required frequently
refers to the brotherhood of believers only.<a name="FnAnchor300"
href="#Footnote300"><span class="sp">300</span></a> Even Paul, in
spite of his cosmopolitan outlook, wrote to the Romans: “Be kindly
affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring
one another”;<a name="FnAnchor301" href="#Footnote301"><span
class="sp">301</span></a> and to the Thessalonians: “As touching
brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves
are taught of God to love one another. And indeed ye do it toward all
the brethren which are in all Macedonia.”<a name="FnAnchor302"
href="#Footnote302"><span class="sp">302</span></a> In another epistle
he wrote: “As we have . . . opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
especially unto them who are of the household of faith.”<a
name="FnAnchor303" href="#Footnote303"><span class="sp">303</span></a>
Hospitality towards strangers is represented as a duty in the New
Testament,<a name="FnAnchor304" href="#Footnote304"><span
class="sp">304</span></a> as it was by the Jews, but sometimes its
exercise is expressly confined to the case of fellow-Christians.<a
name="FnAnchor305" href="#Footnote305"><span class="sp">305</span></a>
Otherwise there is nothing specifically Christian about it.
Hospitality seems to be a universal custom among the lower races
whilst in their native state, as also among the early peoples of
culture. But there is no doubt that it is in the main based on
egoistic considerations, particularly connected with superstitious
ideas about the unknown mysterious stranger, who is looked upon as a
potential cause of evil if he is treated badly, and as a potential
benefactor if he is received as a guest.<a name="FnAnchor306"
href="#Footnote306"><span class="sp">306</span></a> The latter idea is
expressly mentioned as the reason for the injunction in the Epistle to
the Hebrews: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby
some have entertained angels unawares.”<a name="FnAnchor307"

<p>As to the contention that without their belief in God as a father
the Christians could never have formed the idea of a common human
brotherhood, it should be noticed that tenets of universal love have
been laid down both by the Stoics and by Eastern moralists, who had no
notion of a divine fatherhood. The Chinese teachers of morality
inculcated benevolence to all <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page78"></a>78</span> men, without making any reference to
national distinctions.<a name="FnAnchor308" href="#Footnote308"><span
class="sp">308</span></a> Mih-tsze, who lived in the interval between
Confucius and Mencius, even thought that we ought to love all men
equally; but this called forth protests as abnegating the peculiar
devotion due to relatives.<a name="FnAnchor309"
href="#Footnote309"><span class="sp">309</span></a> In ‘Thâi-Shang’ it
is said that a good man will feel kindly towards every creature, and
should not hurt even the insect tribes, grass, and trees.<a
name="FnAnchor310" href="#Footnote310"><span class="sp">310</span></a>
Buddhism enjoins the duty of universal love: “As a mother, even at the
risk of her own life, protects her son, her only son, so let a man
cultivate goodwill without measure toward all beings, . . . unhindered
love and friendliness toward the whole world, above, below, around.”<a
name="FnAnchor311" href="#Footnote311"><span class="sp">311</span></a>
According to the Hindu work ‘Panchatantra’ it is the thought of
little-minded persons to consider whether a man is one of ourselves or
an alien, the whole earth being of kin to him who is generously
disposed.<a name="FnAnchor312" href="#Footnote312"><span

<p>Much importance has been attached to the fact that in the teaching
of Jesus the two commandments enjoining the love of God and the love
of neighbour, which in the Old Testament occur in different books,<a
name="FnAnchor313" href="#Footnote313"><span class="sp">313</span></a>
have been put together in the saying: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto
it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”<a name="FnAnchor314"
href="#Footnote314"><span class="sp">314</span></a> This combination
has led to the conclusion that the love of neighbour follows from the
love of God, and cannot exist without it.<a name="FnAnchor315"
href="#Footnote315"><span class="sp">315</span></a> I find no evidence
for such a conclusion in the saying that the second commandment is
“like unto”<a name="FnAnchor316" href="#Footnote316"><span
class="sp">316</span></a> the first. They are like each other in so
far that both are commandments of love. But the word “love” cannot
mean the same in both cases. The love of God implies reverence,
gratitude,<a name="FnAnchor317" href="#Footnote317"><span
class="sp">317</span></a> devotion, and trust or faith; the love of
neighbour means practically benevolence. Love as a <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page79"></a>79</span> pure emotion cannot, of
course, be commanded, but it readily develops into a volition, and
becomes then a proper object of moral judgment. It is absurd, however,
to suppose that benevolence towards a fellow-man could be merely
derivative from the love of God. If it were, I am afraid that there
would not be much of it even in the Christian world; as Dean Inge
says, “‘love of God’ is talked about more often than felt,”<a
name="FnAnchor318" href="#Footnote318"><span class="sp">318</span></a>
and while “god-fearing” is a common epithet for a devout Christian,
“god-loving” is not found even in dictionaries. Paul speaks extremely
rarely of the love of God. Instead of saying that the love of
neighbour follows from the love of God, we may rather say, with John,
that a man cannot love God, whom he has not seen, if he does not love
his brother, whom he has seen.<a name="FnAnchor319"

<p>The altruistic sentiment, of which benevolence is a manifestation,
is found in all mammalian species, at least as displayed in the
mother’s love of her young, and the duty of benevolence in every human
society. There is no doubt that it was such a sentiment that led Jesus
to enjoin men to love their neighbours as themselves, and to regard
this duty as a command of God. His infinite kindness towards the sick,
the needy, and the distressed is abundantly proved throughout the
gospels, and finds its most touching expression in the words: “Come
unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy,
and my burden is light.”<a name="FnAnchor320"

<p>Among the positive duties resulting from benevolence almsgiving
holds a prominent position in the teaching of Jesus. He said: “Give to
him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not
thou away.”<a name="FnAnchor321" href="#Footnote321"><span
class="sp">321</span></a> When a young ruler who asked him what he
should do that he might inherit eternal life, and told him that he had
kept all the commandments from his youth, Jesus answered: “Yet lackest
thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor,
and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.”<a name="FnAnchor322"
href="#Footnote322"><span class="sp">322</span></a> Eternal life is
promised to those who feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, take
in the stranger, clothe the naked, visit the sick.<a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page80"></a>80</span> This insistence
on the duty of charity, which for ages was destined to exercise a
paramount influence on Christian morals, belonged to the Jewish
heritage. “Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy
poor, and to thy needy, in thy land”; “for this thing the Lord thy God
shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine
hand unto.”<a name="FnAnchor324" href="#Footnote324"><span
class="sp">324</span></a> Even “if thine enemy be hungry, give him
bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: . . . the
Lord shall reward thee.”<a name="FnAnchor325"
href="#Footnote325"><span class="sp">325</span></a> Especially in the
Old Testament apocrypha and in rabbinical literature almsgiving
assumed an excessive importance&mdash;so much so that the word which
in the older writings means “righteousness” in general came to be used
for almsgiving in particular.<a name="FnAnchor326"
href="#Footnote326"><span class="sp">326</span></a> “Shut up alms in
thy storehouses; and it shall deliver thee from all affliction.”<a
name="FnAnchor327" href="#Footnote327"><span class="sp">327</span></a>
“As water will quench a flaming fire, so alms maketh an atonement for
sins.”<a name="FnAnchor328" href="#Footnote328"><span
class="sp">328</span></a> “For alms doth deliver from death, and shall
purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall
be filled with life.”<a name="FnAnchor329" href="#Footnote329"><span
class="sp">329</span></a> The charitable man is rewarded with the
birth of male issue.<a name="FnAnchor330" href="#Footnote330"><span
class="sp">330</span></a> Almsgiving outweighs all other duties.<a
name="FnAnchor331" href="#Footnote331"><span class="sp">331</span></a>
He who averts his eye from charity commits a sin equal to idolatry.<a
name="FnAnchor332" href="#Footnote332"><span class="sp">332</span></a>
It must be extended equally to Jew and Gentile.<a name="FnAnchor333"
href="#Footnote333"><span class="sp">333</span></a> To such an extreme
was almsgiving carried by the Jews that, while the giver must devote
to charity at least a tenth of his income, some rabbis at length
decreed that no man should give more than a fifth, lest he should come
to seek charity himself.<a name="FnAnchor334"
href="#Footnote334"><span class="sp">334</span></a> But charity is not
sufficient in itself: kind thoughts and words must go with it. To give
liberally to the poor, but with sullen look, is to rob the deed of all
virtue.<a name="FnAnchor335" href="#Footnote335"><span
class="sp">335</span></a> “Sow [a reward] for yourselves in giving
alms as charity, you will reap according to the benevolence.”<a
name="FnAnchor336" href="#Footnote336"><span class="sp">336</span></a>
Like Jesus, the rabbis insisted that charity should be done in
secret.<a name="FnAnchor337" href="#Footnote337"><span

indeed, “better give no alms at all, than give them in public.”<a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page81"></a>81</span> While the duty
of almsgiving is in the first place based on the altruistic sentiment
and, therefore, is apt to assume a religious character where the deity
is looked upon as a being who is kindly disposed towards mankind and a
guardian of morality, there are also some special reasons why it has
been so strenuously enjoined by religions of a higher type, including
others besides Hebrewism and Christianity.<a name="FnAnchor339"
href="#Footnote339"><span class="sp">339</span></a> There is an idea
that niggardliness exposes a person to supernatural danger, whereas
charity and liberality may entail supernatural reward, on account of
the curses or blessings of the poor. The ancient Greeks believed that
the beggar had his Erinys,<a name="FnAnchor340"
href="#Footnote340"><span class="sp">340</span></a> his avenging
demon, who was evidently a personification of his curse.<a
name="FnAnchor341" href="#Footnote341"><span class="sp">341</span></a>
It is said in the Proverbs: “He that giveth unto the poor shall not
lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse”;<a
name="FnAnchor342" href="#Footnote342"><span class="sp">342</span></a>
and in Deuteronomy: “Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is
poor and needy, . . . lest he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it
be sin unto thee.”<a name="FnAnchor343" href="#Footnote343"><span
class="sp">343</span></a> The same idea is expressed in
Ecclesiasticus: “Turn not away thine eye from the needy, and give him
none occasion to curse thee: for if he curse thee in the bitterness of
his soul, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him. . . . A
prayer out of a poor man’s mouth reacheth to the ears of God, and his
judgment cometh speedily.”<a name="FnAnchor344"
href="#Footnote344"><span class="sp">344</span></a> In a very early
Christian work, the ‘Shepherd’ of Hermas, it is said: “Beware, ye that
glory in your riches, lest perhaps they groan who are in want, and
their sighing come up to God, and ye be shut out with your goods
without the gate of the tower.”<a name="FnAnchor345"
href="#Footnote345"><span class="sp">345</span></a> And a poor man is
able not only to punish the uncharitable by means of his curse, but
also to reward the generous giver by means of his blessing; as it is
said in Ecclesiasticus: “Stretch thine hand unto the poor, that thy
blessing may be perfected. A gift hath grace in the sight of every man
living.”<a name="FnAnchor346" href="#Footnote346"><span
class="sp">346</span></a> While he who withholdeth corn shall be
cursed by the people, “blessing shall be upon the head of him that
selleth it.”<a name="FnAnchor347" href="#Footnote347"><span
class="sp">347</span></a> Hermas writes that as the vine is supported
by the elm, so is the rich man helped by the prayers of the poor. “The
poor <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82"></a>82</span> praying unto
the Lord for the rich are heard by him; and their riches are
increased, because they minister to the poor of their wealth.”<a

<p>The curses and blessings, no doubt, partly account for the fact
that almsgiving has come to be regarded as a religious duty. They have
not necessarily the character of an appeal to a god, but may be
believed to possess a purely magical power, independently of any
superhuman will. This belief is rooted in the close association
between the wish, more particularly the spoken wish, and the idea of
its fulfilment. The wish is looked upon in the light of energy which
may be transferred&mdash;by material contact, or by the eye, or by
means of speech&mdash;to the person concerned, and then becomes a
fact. This process, however, is not taken quite as a matter of course.
There is always some mystery about it, and one&mdash;though not the
only&mdash;method of giving the curse or the blessing that
supernatural quality which alone can bring about the result desired is
to invoke in it a god. His own feelings need not be considered at all:
his holy name may simply be brought in to impart to it that mystic
efficacy which the plain word lacks. In the Talmud there are traces of
the idea that the name of the Lord might be used with advantage in any
curse however undeserved.<a name="FnAnchor349"
href="#Footnote349"><span class="sp">349</span></a> But with the
deepening of the religious sentiment this idea has to be given up. A
righteous and mighty god can scarcely agree to be a mere tool in the
hand of a wicked curser. Hence the curse comes to be looked upon as a
prayer, which is not fulfilled if undeserved; as it is said in the
Proverbs, “the curse causeless shall not come.”<a name="FnAnchor350"
href="#Footnote350"><span class="sp">350</span></a> And the same is
the case with a blessing. In ancient days Jacob could take away his
brother’s blessing by deceit;<a name="FnAnchor351"
href="#Footnote351"><span class="sp">351</span></a> the blessing acted
in the same way as a medicine, which cures the patient just as well if
it is stolen as if it is bought. But later on its efficacy was limited
by moral considerations. The Psalmist declares that only the offspring
of the righteous can be blessed,<a name="FnAnchor352"
href="#Footnote352"><span class="sp">352</span></a> and according to
the Apostolic Constitutions, “although a widow who eateth and is
filled from the wicked, pray for them, she shall not be heard.”<a
name="FnAnchor353" href="#Footnote353"><span class="sp">353</span></a>
On the other hand, curses and blessings, when well deserved, continued
to draw down calamity or prosperity upon their objects, by inducing
God to put them into effect. This notion prevails both in <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page83"></a>83</span> Judaism and
Mohammedanism,<a name="FnAnchor354" href="#Footnote354"><span
class="sp">354</span></a> and underlies the Christian oath and
benediction. As an uncharitable man deserves to be punished and a
charitable man merits reward, the curses and blessings of the poor
will be heard by a righteous God. “The Lord will plead their cause.”<a

<p>Besides the belief in the efficacy of curses and blessings there is
another, and more important, reason for the extraordinary stress which
the higher religions lay on the duty of charity, namely the connection
between almsgiving and sacrifice. When food is offered as a tribute to
a god, he is supposed to enjoy its spiritual part only, while the
substance of it is left behind and is in many cases eaten by the poor.
And when the offering is continued in ceremonial survival in spite of
the growing conviction that, after all, the deity does not need and
cannot profit by it, the poor become the heirs of the god. The chief
virtue of the act then lies in the self-abnegation of the donor, and
its efficacy is measured by the “sacrifice” which it costs him.</p>
<p>Many instances may be quoted of sacrificed food being left for the
poor or being distributed among them,<a name="FnAnchor356"
href="#Footnote356"><span class="sp">356</span></a> whilst in other
cases almsgiving is itself regarded as a form of sacrifice, or takes
the place of it.<a name="FnAnchor357" href="#Footnote357"><span
class="sp">357</span></a> When the destruction of the temple with its
altar filled the Jews with alarm as they thought of their unatoned
sins, Johanan ben Zakkai comforted them saying: “You have another
means of atonement as powerful as the altar, and that is the work of
charity, for it is said, ‘I desired mercy, and not sacrifice.’”<a
name="FnAnchor358" href="#Footnote358"><span class="sp">358</span></a>
Several other passages show how closely the Jews associated almsgiving
with sacrifice. “He that giveth alms sacrificeth praise.”<a
name="FnAnchor359" href="#Footnote359"><span class="sp">359</span></a>
“As sin-offering makes atonement for Israel, so alms for the
Gentiles.”<a name="FnAnchor360" href="#Footnote360"><span
class="sp">360</span></a> “Almsdeeds are more meritorious than all
sacrifices.”<a name="FnAnchor361" href="#Footnote361"><span
class="sp">361</span></a> An orphan is called an “altar to God.”<a
name="FnAnchor362" href="#Footnote362"><span class="sp">362</span></a>
Alms were systematically collected in the synagogues, and officers
were appointed to make the collection.<a name="FnAnchor363"
href="#Footnote363"><span class="sp">363</span></a> So also among the
early Christians the collection of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page84"></a>84</span> alms for the relief of the poor was an act
of the Church life itself. Almsgiving took place in public worship,
nay formed itself a part of worship. Gifts of natural produce, the
so-called oblations, were connected with the celebration of the Lord’s
Supper. They were offered to God as the first-fruits of the creatures
(<i>primitiæ creaturarum</i>), and a prayer was said: “O Lord, accept
also the offerings of those who to-day bring an offering, as Thou
didst accept the offerings of righteous Abel, the offering of our
father Abraham, the incense of Zachariah, the alms of Cornelius, and
the two mites of the widow.” These oblations were not only used for
the Lord’s Supper, but also formed the chief means for the relief of
the poor. They were regarded as sacrifice in the most special sense;
and as no unclean gift might be laid upon the Lord’s altar, profit
made from sinful occupations was not accepted as an oblation, neither
were the oblations of impenitent sinners.<a name="FnAnchor364"

<p>The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of almsgiving as a
sacrifice of thanksgiving which continues after the Jewish altar has
been done away with.<a name="FnAnchor365" href="#Footnote365"><span
class="sp">365</span></a> Like sacrifice, almsgiving was connected
with prayer, as a means of making the prayer efficacious and
furnishing it with wings; the angel said to Cornelius: “Thy prayers
and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.”<a
name="FnAnchor366" href="#Footnote366"><span class="sp">366</span></a>
When the Christians were reproached for having no sacrifice, Justin
wrote: “We have been taught that the only honour that is worthy of Him
is not to consume by fire what He has brought into being for our
sustenance, but to use it for ourselves and those who need.”<a
name="FnAnchor367" href="#Footnote367"><span class="sp">367</span></a>
So also Irenæus observes that sacrifices are not abolished in the New
Testament, though their form is indeed altered, because they are no
longer offered by slaves, but by freemen, of which just the oblations
are the proof.<a name="FnAnchor368" href="#Footnote368"><span
class="sp">368</span></a> And God has enjoined on Christians this
sacrifice of oblations, not because He needs them, but “in order that
themselves might be neither unfruitful nor ungrateful.”<a
name="FnAnchor369" href="#Footnote369"><span class="sp">369</span></a>
Augustine says: “The sacrifice of the Christians is the alms bestowed
upon the poor.”<a name="FnAnchor370" href="#Footnote370"><span

<p>By pointing out the magical and ritualistic elements in the
formation of the religious duty of almsgiving I have, of course, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page85"></a>85</span> by no means wanted to
undermine its altruistic foundation, but only to explain why it has
attained the same supreme importance as is otherwise attached only to
devotional exercises. And this is certainly a problem by itself, for
which the belief in a benevolent God interested in the worldly
morality of his believers affords no adequate solution.</p>
<p>The altruism of the ethics of Jesus is also apparent in his
insistence on those of the ten commandments which forbid men to do
harm to their neighbours. Somewhat different was his attitude towards
the commandment, “Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may
be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.” It is
unlike the others through its appeal to the worldly interests of those
who follow it. Among the Hebrews, as among many other peoples,<a
name="FnAnchor371" href="#Footnote371"><span class="sp">371</span></a>
the connection between filial submissiveness and religious beliefs was
in a large measure due to the extreme significance attributed to
parental blessings and curses. They thought that parents, and
especially a father, could thereby determine the fate of their
children;<a name="FnAnchor372" href="#Footnote372"><span
class="sp">372</span></a> and we have every reason to assume that the
reward which in the fifth commandment is held out to respectful
children was originally the result of parental blessings. We meet with
this idea in Ecclesiasticus, where it is said: “Honour thy father and
mother in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them.
For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children;
but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.”<a
name="FnAnchor373" href="#Footnote373"><span class="sp">373</span></a>
But a long life on earth was a poor reward compared with the eternal
life in heaven. Jesus taught that every one that had forsaken father
or mother for his name’s sake would inherit everlasting life.<a
name="FnAnchor374" href="#Footnote374"><span class="sp">374</span></a>
His church was a militant church. He had come not to send peace, but a
sword, “to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter
against her mother.”<a name="FnAnchor375" href="#Footnote375"><span
class="sp">375</span></a> Being chiefly addressed to the young, the
new teaching naturally caused much disorder in families. Fathers
disinherited their converted sons,<a name="FnAnchor376"
href="#Footnote376"><span class="sp">376</span></a> and children
thought that they owed no duty to their parents when such a duty was
opposed to the interests of their souls. According to Gregory the
Great, we ought to ignore our parents, hating them, and flying from
them when they are an obstacle to us in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page86"></a>86</span> the way of the Lord;<a name="FnAnchor377"
href="#Footnote377"><span class="sp">377</span></a> and this became
the accepted theory of the Church.<a name="FnAnchor378"
href="#Footnote378"><span class="sp">378</span></a> But it was not
only in similar cases of conflict that Jesus spoke disparagingly of
family ties that previously had been regarded with religious
veneration. In all circumstances the relationship between child and
parent was put in the shade by the relationship between man and God:
“Call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father which
is in heaven.”<a name="FnAnchor379" href="#Footnote379"><span
class="sp">379</span></a> And what would an orthodox Jew have thought
if he heard the words: “If any man come to me and hate not his father
and mother, . . . he cannot be my disciple.”<a name="FnAnchor380"
href="#Footnote380"><span class="sp">380</span></a> In his own conduct
he did not always follow the law. When he, at the age of twelve, went
to Jerusalem with his parents at the feast of the Passover, he tarried
behind without their knowledge, and was found by them in the temple
only after three days. The mother reproved him saying: “Son, why hast
thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee
sorrowing”; but afterwards he “was subject unto them.”<a
name="FnAnchor381" href="#Footnote381"><span class="sp">381</span></a>
Yet on one occasion his brusque treatment of his mother and brothers
surprised the people around him: “There came then his brethren and his
mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him. And the
multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother
and thy brethren without seek for thee. And he answered them, saying,
Who is my mother, or my brethren? And he looked round about them which
sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! For
whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my
sister, and mother.”<a name="FnAnchor382" href="#Footnote382"><span
class="sp">382</span></a> According to John, the mother of Jesus was
at a marriage in Cana, to which also he and his disciples were called.
“When they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have
no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee?
mine hour is not yet come.” Afterwards, however, he turned water into
wine.<a name="FnAnchor383" href="#Footnote383"><span
class="sp">383</span></a> Yet in spite of utterances which must have
jarred upon Jewish ears, the fifth commandment was left formally
intact. It was mentioned by Jesus together with the other commandments
which he enumerated in his answer to the man who asked him what he
should do that he might inherit eternal life.<a name="FnAnchor384"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page87"></a>87</span> In an important
point Jesus opposed the Jewish marriage law. In his teaching
concerning divorce he stood up for the interests of the wife. The
right of the husband to divorce his wife at his pleasure was the
central thought in the system of Jewish divorce law, although the
rabbis gradually tempered its severity by certain restrictive
measures. Two restrictions are already found in the Deuteronomic code:
the husband shall not put his wife away all his days if he has falsely
accused her of ante-nuptial incontinence,<a name="FnAnchor385"
href="#Footnote385"><span class="sp">385</span></a> or if he has
ravished her before marriage;<a name="FnAnchor386"
href="#Footnote386"><span class="sp">386</span></a> but his loss of
the right to divorce her in these cases was really a penalty inflicted
upon him on account of his own offensive behaviour. To these
restrictions the Mishna added a few others;<a name="FnAnchor387"
href="#Footnote387"><span class="sp">387</span></a> but in the same
period the very theory of the law was challenged by the school of
Shammai, who held that according to Deuteronomy the husband cannot
divorce his wife unless he has found her guilty of sexual immorality.
The ancient doctrine was strongly supported by the school of Hillel,
who went so far as to say that a man can divorce his wife even for the
most trivial reason, for instance, for spoiling his food or if he sees
another woman who pleases him better. Both schools based their
opinions on the same passage in the Deuteronomic text: “When a man
hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find
no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her:
then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand,
and send her out of his house.”<a name="FnAnchor388"
href="#Footnote388"><span class="sp">388</span></a> But the school of
Shammai maintained that the expression “some uncleanness” (lit. “the
nakedness of a thing”) signified sexual immorality; whereas the school
of Hillel interpreted it to mean anything offensive to the husband
and, besides, pressed the clause “if she find no favour in his
eyes.”<a name="FnAnchor389" href="#Footnote389"><span
class="sp">389</span></a> In legal respects the opinion of Hillel
prevailed, although divorce without good cause is said to have been
morally disapproved of by the rabbis in general.<a name="FnAnchor390"

<p>In the sayings of Jesus there are various passages bearing upon the
question. A man who puts away his wife and marries <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page88"></a>88</span> another commits
adultery,<a name="FnAnchor391" href="#Footnote391"><span
class="sp">391</span></a> he who marries a divorced wife is guilty of
the same crime,<a name="FnAnchor392" href="#Footnote392"><span
class="sp">392</span></a> and so is a woman who puts away her husband
and is married to another man.<a name="FnAnchor393"
href="#Footnote393"><span class="sp">393</span></a> A man shall cleave
to his wife, “they twain shall be one flesh”; and “what God hath
joined together, let no man put asunder.”<a name="FnAnchor394"
href="#Footnote394"><span class="sp">394</span></a> According to
Matthew, however, Jesus, like Shammai and his school, taught that a
man might put away his wife for fornication, but for no other reason.
This exception is considered to be an interpolation.<a
name="FnAnchor395" href="#Footnote395"><span class="sp">395</span></a>
But Dean Inge asks whether it was not Christ’s method to make
statements in an unguarded form, leaving it to the common sense of his
hearers to make the necessary qualifications; and he thinks it is a
tenable view that the case of adultery was not in the speaker’s mind
at the time, and even that to a Jew the right of divorce for adultery
might have been too obvious to need reaffirmation.<a
name="FnAnchor396" href="#Footnote396"><span class="sp">396</span></a>
In any case, though the rule laid down by Jesus was, from the wife’s
point of view, a great improvement on the orthodox Jewish law, its
stringency has certainly been a lasting cause of much matrimonial
unhappiness in the Christian world.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER V</h4>
<h3>THE ETHICS OF JESUS (<i>concluded</i>)</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="smcap">HE</span> ethical teaching of Jesus discussed
in the two last chapters was found to be an expression of intense
moral emotions in which both the retributive and the altruistic
elements come out very prominently. Specific religious and
eschatological beliefs were blended with the ideas springing from
those emotions. Our duties to neighbours were founded upon our
submission to the will of God,<a name="FnAnchor397"
href="#Footnote397"><span class="sp">397</span></a> and their
sanctions were rewards or penalties for obedience or disobedience to
his commandments. But those beliefs have not essentially altered the
contents of the commandments, as is testified by the innumerable
parallels between the teaching of Jesus and that of other moralists.
We even find that certain doctrines which had crept into the moral
system of the Jews from their religion, but were alien to the
emotional origin of morals, were opposed by him. This is particularly
apparent in his attitude towards the sabbath.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote397"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor397"><sup>397</sup></a></span> <i>Cf.</i>
<i>Matthew</i> vii. 21, xii. 50; <i>Mark</i> iii. 35; <i>Luke</i> xi.
28.</p></div>

<p>It has been alleged that the abundant regulations of the rabbis had
“tended to obscure in the general mind the original character and
intention of the sabbath law.”<a name="FnAnchor398"
href="#Footnote398"><span class="sp">398</span></a> These are
evidently supposed to be explained by the words in the decalogue:
“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou
labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the
Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work. . . . For in six days
the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day,
and hallowed it.”<a name="FnAnchor399" href="#Footnote399"><span
class="sp">399</span></a> It is evident, however, that the institution
of the sabbath was not due to any idea of giving a weekly day of rest
to men and animals, but to the belief that it was inauspicious or
dangerous to work on the seventh day; and there seems to be no doubt
that the reason for this belief was the mystic connection which in the
opinion of the ancient Hebrews existed between human activity and the
changes of the moon. I have pointed out in another work that such a
superstition is found among <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page90"></a>90</span> many peoples in different parts of the
world.<a name="FnAnchor400" href="#Footnote400"><span
class="sp">400</span></a> It has been sufficiently demonstrated that
the sabbath originally depended upon the new moon, and this carries
with it the assumption that the Hebrews must at one time have observed
a sabbath at intervals of seven days corresponding to the moon’s
phases.<a name="FnAnchor401" href="#Footnote401"><span
class="sp">401</span></a> In the Old Testament the new moon and the
sabbath are repeatedly mentioned side by side;<a name="FnAnchor402"
href="#Footnote402"><span class="sp">402</span></a> thus the
oppressors of the poor are represented as saying: “When will the new
moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set
forth wheat?”<a name="FnAnchor403" href="#Footnote403"><span
class="sp">403</span></a> Among modern Jews, at the feast of the new
moon, which is held every month on the first or on the first and
second days of the month, the women are obliged to suspend all servile
work, though the men are not required to interrupt their secular
employment.<a name="FnAnchor404" href="#Footnote404"><span

<p>Wellhausen suggested that the rest on the sabbath was originally
the consequence of that day being the festal and sacrificial day of
the week, and only gradually became its essential attribute on account
of the regularity with which it every eighth day interrupted the round
of everyday work. He argues that the sabbath as a day of rest cannot
be very primitive, because such a day “presupposes agriculture and a
tolerably hard-pressed working day-life.”<a name="FnAnchor405"
href="#Footnote405"><span class="sp">405</span></a> But this argument
appears quite untenable when we consider how frequently changes of the
moon are believed to exercise an unfavourable influence upon work of
any kind. That the superstitious fear of doing work on the seventh day
developed into a religious prohibition, is only another instance of
the tendency of magic forces to be transformed into divine volitions.
Like the ancient Hebrews, the Assyrians and Babylonians looked upon
the seventh day as an “evil day”; and though they do not seem
generally to have abstained from work on that day, there were royal
taboos connected with it. The king was not to show himself in his
chariot, not to hold court, not to bring sacrifices, not to change his
clothes, not to eat a good dinner, nor even to curse his enemies.<a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page91"></a>91</span> Jesus
exasperated the Pharisees by his treatment of the sabbath. He healed
sick people on that day,<a name="FnAnchor407"
href="#Footnote407"><span class="sp">407</span></a> and defended it
himself by saying that “it is lawful to do well on the sabbath
days.”<a name="FnAnchor408" href="#Footnote408"><span
class="sp">408</span></a> When the Pharisees blamed him for allowing
his disciples to pluck the ears of corn as they went through
cornfields on the sabbath, he replied: “The sabbath was made for man,
and not man for the sabbath. Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of
the sabbath.”<a name="FnAnchor409" href="#Footnote409"><span
class="sp">409</span></a> In defence of the Pharisees it has been
pointed out that they authorised breaches of the sabbatic law in
certain contingencies; that they “permitted, nay required, the
performance of all necessary works of mercy, but refused to extend the
licence too indiscriminately, and never reconciled themselves to the
theory that in general the performance of a duty justified the
infringement of a prohibition.”<a name="FnAnchor410"
href="#Footnote410"><span class="sp">410</span></a> On such grounds
even the accuracy of the reports concerning the indignant Pharisees
has been called in question. Drews argues that since healing by merely
stretching out one’s hand over the patient, as Jesus is said to have
done on the sabbath, was not forbidden by the rabbis, the Pharisees
could not have been “filled with madness” on such an occasion.<a
name="FnAnchor411" href="#Footnote411"><span class="sp">411</span></a>
But all Pharisees can scarcely be supposed to have been unanimous as
to the emergencies in which the sabbath law might be disregarded; and
Jesus certainly traversed the Pharisaic position when he treated on
the sabbath long-standing diseases, lingering maladies, and,
generally, cases where the treatment could be postponed without fear
of dangerous consequences.<a name="FnAnchor412"
href="#Footnote412"><span class="sp">412</span></a> We know that the
early Christians considered the sabbath to have been abolished by
Christ. Jewish converts no doubt continued to observe it, but this met
with disapproval. In one of the epistles of Ignatius we find the
exhortation not to “sabbatise,” which was expanded by the subsequent
paraphraser of these compositions into a warning against keeping the
sabbath, after the manner of the Jews, “as if delighting in
idleness.”<a name="FnAnchor413" href="#Footnote413"><span
class="sp">413</span></a> And in the fourth century a Council of the
Church enacted that “the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page92"></a>92</span> Christians ought not to judaise and rest on
the sabbath, but ought to work on that day.”<a name="FnAnchor414"

<p>Nor was the Christian Sunday originally in any way a substitute for
the Jewish sabbath. It was from early times a recognised custom among
the Christians to celebrate the first day of the week in memory of
Christ’s resurrection by holding a form of religious service; but
there was no sabbatic regard for it, and it was chiefly looked upon as
a day of rejoicing.<a name="FnAnchor415" href="#Footnote415"><span
class="sp">415</span></a> Tertullian is the first writer who speaks of
abstinence from secular care and labour on Sunday as a duty incumbent
upon Christians, lest they should “give place to the devil.”<a
name="FnAnchor416" href="#Footnote416"><span class="sp">416</span></a>
But it is extremely doubtful whether the earliest Sunday law really
had a Christian origin. In 321 the Emperor Constantine issued an edict
to the effect that all judges and all city people and tradesmen should
rest on “the venerable Day of the Sun,” whereas those living in the
country should have full liberty to attend to the culture of their
fields, “since it frequently happens that no other day is so fit for
the sowing of grain or the planting of vines.”<a name="FnAnchor417"
href="#Footnote417"><span class="sp">417</span></a> In this rescript
nothing is said of any relation to Christianity, nor do we know that
it in any way was due to Christian influence.<a name="FnAnchor418"
href="#Footnote418"><span class="sp">418</span></a> It seems that
Constantine, in his capacity of Pontifex Maximus, only added the day
of the sun&mdash;whose worship was the characteristic of the new
paganism&mdash;to those inauspicious days, <i>religiosi dies</i>,
which the Romans of old regarded as unsuitable for worldly business
and especially for judicious proceedings.<a name="FnAnchor419"

<p>But although the obligatory Sunday rest in no case was a
continuance of the Jewish sabbath, it was gradually confounded with
it, owing to the recognition of the decalogue, with its <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page93"></a>93</span> injunction of a weekly
day of rest, as the code of divine morality. From the sixth century
upwards vexatious restrictions were made by civil rulers, councils,
and ecclesiastical writers,<a name="FnAnchor420"
href="#Footnote420"><span class="sp">420</span></a> until in
Puritanism the Christian Sunday became a perfect image of the
Pharisaic sabbath, or even excelled it in the rigour with which
abstinence from every kind of worldly activity was insisted upon. The
theory that the keeping holy of one day out of seven is the essence of
the fourth commandment reconciled people to the fact that the Jewish
sabbath was the seventh day and Sunday the first. In England, in the
seventeenth century, persons were punished for carrying coal on
Sunday, for hanging out clothes to dry, for travelling on horseback,
for rural strolls and walking about.<a name="FnAnchor421"
href="#Footnote421"><span class="sp">421</span></a> And there were
Scotch clergymen who taught their congregations that on that day it
was sinful even to save a vessel in distress.<a name="FnAnchor422"
href="#Footnote422"><span class="sp">422</span></a> Until quite
recently the Scottish Sunday was observed with amazing rigour. Not
only were ordinary recreations disallowed, but a ban was put even upon
books and music, except such as were recognised as religious in the
narrow sense. Indeed, no recreation remained but whisky-drinking; and
a writer in Hastings’ <i>Encyclopædia of Religion</i> attributes a
great part of the drunkenness which is still common in Scotland to
this strange Sabbatarianism.</p>

<p>Jesus inaugurated his ministry by a fast of forty days;<a
name="FnAnchor423" href="#Footnote423"><span class="sp">423</span></a>
the Jews associated fasting with divine revelations.<a
name="FnAnchor424" href="#Footnote424"><span class="sp">424</span></a>
It also held a prominent position in Jewish ritual and in the
Christian Church as well; but it is seldom mentioned by Jesus, though
allusions to it have been interpolated in several places in later
manuscripts of the New Testament.<a name="FnAnchor425"
href="#Footnote425"><span class="sp">425</span></a> To some extent he
took it for granted. He said to his disciples: “When ye fast, be not,
as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their
faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. . . . But thou, when
thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear
not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret.”<a
name="FnAnchor426" href="#Footnote426"><span class="sp">426</span></a>
He speaks with scorn of the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page94"></a>94</span> Pharisee who “stood and prayed thus with
himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers. . . . I fast twice in the week, I
give tithes of all that I possess.”<a name="FnAnchor427"
href="#Footnote427"><span class="sp">427</span></a> It was objected to
Jesus that while the disciples of John and the Pharisees used to fast,
his disciples did not fast. Jesus replied: “Can the children of the
bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they
have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. But the days will
come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then
shall they fast in those days.”<a name="FnAnchor428"
href="#Footnote428"><span class="sp">428</span></a> Fasting after a
death is a widespread practice,<a name="FnAnchor429"
href="#Footnote429"><span class="sp">429</span></a> and is also
mentioned in the Old Testament. David and his people fasted for Saul
and Jonathan until even on the day when the news of their death
arrived.<a name="FnAnchor430" href="#Footnote430"><span

<p>Jesus was not an ascetic like John the Baptist, who lived in the
wilderness clothed with camel’s hair and neither ate bread nor drank
wine, but subsisted on locusts and wild honey.<a name="FnAnchor431"
href="#Footnote431"><span class="sp">431</span></a> He “came eating
and drinking” and was even accused of being “a gluttonous man and a
winebibber” who ate and drank with publicans and sinners.<a
name="FnAnchor432" href="#Footnote432"><span class="sp">432</span></a>
He accepted invitations of Pharisees to dine in their houses, and
according to John he was present at a wedding where he turned water
into wine.<a name="FnAnchor433" href="#Footnote433"><span
class="sp">433</span></a> But he led a very simple wandering life,
indifferent to all comfort. When a certain man came and said that he
wished to follow him wherever he went, Jesus replied: “The foxes have
holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath
not where to lay his head.”<a name="FnAnchor434"
href="#Footnote434"><span class="sp">434</span></a> And when he sent
his disciples to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick, he
said to them: “Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your
purses, Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes,
nor yet staves”; but admonished them to rely upon private
hospitality.<a name="FnAnchor435" href="#Footnote435"><span
class="sp">435</span></a> On another occasion he said to his
disciples: “Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what
ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. . . . For
your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.”<a

<p>Jesus speaks of the folly of hoarding in the parable of the rich
man who built greater barns: “God said unto him, Thou fool, this night
thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be,
which thou hast provided?”<a name="FnAnchor441"
href="#Footnote441"><span class="sp">441</span></a>  Moreover, the end
of the world was at hand: “Ye know neither the day nor the hour
wherein the Son of man cometh.”<a name="FnAnchor442"
href="#Footnote442"><span class="sp">442</span></a> The attitude of
Jesus towards wealth was also connected with the idea that we ought to
give in charity any superfluity of what we possess.<a
name="FnAnchor443" href="#Footnote443"><span class="sp">443</span></a>
But the principal reason why Jesus was so severe upon the rich was the
nothingness of all earthly possessions and their imperilling the soul.
“He that layeth up treasure for himself . . . is not rich toward
God.”<a name="FnAnchor444" href="#Footnote444"><span
class="sp">444</span></a> “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break
through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. . .
. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. . . . No
man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love
the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the <span

God and mammon.”<a name="FnAnchor445" href="#Footnote445"><span

<p>This disdain for temporal anxieties and worldly goods has taken us
to a new department in the ethics of Jesus, where the determining
factor is no longer the natural constitution of the moral
consciousness, but the influence of specific religious ideas. Such
influence is also apparent in the importance which he attached to
certain ritual practices, contrary to his disregard of certain others,
such as the keeping of the sabbath, fasting, and sacrifice: “I will
have mercy, and not sacrifice.”<a name="FnAnchor447"
href="#Footnote447"><span class="sp">447</span></a> Prayer holds a
very prominent position in his teaching: “Men ought always to pray,
and not to faint.”<a name="FnAnchor448" href="#Footnote448"><span
class="sp">448</span></a> “All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in
prayer, believing, ye shall receive.”<a name="FnAnchor449"
href="#Footnote449"><span class="sp">449</span></a> “Ask, and it shall
be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.”<a
name="FnAnchor450" href="#Footnote450"><span class="sp">450</span></a>
“But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for
they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye
therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have
need of, before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our
Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name”; and so forth.<a

<p>Prayer is an act of humility, and the spirit of humility pervades

<p>Prayer and humility presuppose faith, which was stressed by the
Prophets,<a name="FnAnchor458" href="#Footnote458"><span
class="sp">458</span></a> and assumed pre-eminence in the teaching of
Jesus. “The apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith”; and he
answered: “If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say
unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou
planted in the sea; and it should obey you.”<a name="FnAnchor459"
href="#Footnote459"><span class="sp">459</span></a> When Jesus caused
a fig-tree which had leaves but no fruit suddenly to wither away, the
disciples who saw it marvelled and said: “How soon is the fig-tree
withered away.” Jesus answered and said to them: “Verily I say unto
you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which
is done to the fig-tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain,
Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. . .

<p>Jesus particularly often speaks of faith in connection with his
miracles. When he had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came and
said to him: “Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
grievously tormented.” Jesus answered that he would come and heal him.
The centurion said: “I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my
roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I
am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this
man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my
servant, Do this, and he doeth it.” When Jesus heard this, he
marvelled and said to the people who followed him: “Verily I say unto
you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.” And he said
to the centurion: “Go thy way; and as thou has believed, so be it done
unto thee.” And the servant was healed at once.<a name="FnAnchor461"

<p>A woman who was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came
behind Jesus and touched the hem of his garment, saying within
herself: “If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.” Jesus

comfort; thy faith hath made <span class="pagenum"><a

<p>The woman of Canaan, mentioned above, whose daughter was vexed with
a devil and who implored Jesus to heal her, but was rebuffed by him
with the words, “It is not meet to take the children’s bread and to
cast it to dogs,” replied: “Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the
crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” Then Jesus said to her:
“O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.” And
her daughter was made whole from that very hour.<a name="FnAnchor464"

<p>Once when Jesus was in a house preaching and there were many people
gathered, four men came carrying a man sick of the palsy, but could
not make their way through the crowd. They then uncovered the roof
where he was, and when they had broken it up they let down the bed in
which the sick man lay. “When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the
sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.” Some of the
scribes sitting there reasoned in their hearts: “Why doth this man
thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?” Then
Jesus, who read their thoughts, said: “That ye may know that the Son
of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of
the palsy), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy
way into thine house.” And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and
went forth before them all.<a name="FnAnchor465"

<p>A man brought to Jesus his son who had been vexed with a dumb
spirit since he was a child. He had spoken to the disciples that they
should cast him out, but they could not, and now he implored Jesus,
saying: “If thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help
us.” Jesus answered: “If thou canst believe, all things are possible
to him that believeth.” Straightway the father of the child cried out,
and said with tears: “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.” And
Jesus cast the devil out. When the disciples asked him why they could
not do it, Jesus answered, according to Mark: <span class="pagenum"><a

prayer and fasting”; and according to Matthew: “Because of your
unbelief. . . . Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and

<p>A blind man came to Jesus, who asked him: “What wilt thou that I

<p>A man who was a ruler of the synagogue fell down at Jesus’ feet,
and besought him that he would come into his house, because he had a
young daughter who was dying; but the people thronged him. Then there
came some one from his house and said to him: “Thy daughter is dead;
trouble not the Master.” But when Jesus heard it he said: “Fear not:
believe only, and she shall be made whole.” When he came into the
house he “took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise. And
her spirit came again, and she arose straightway.”<a

<p>When Jesus entered into a certain village ten lepers met him, and,
standing afar off, cried out: “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” When
he saw them he said to them: “Go shew yourselves unto the priests.” As
they went they were cleansed. But one of them, who was a Samaritan,
when he saw that he was healed, turned back and glorified God with a
loud voice and fell down on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him
thanks. Jesus said to him: “Were there not ten cleansed? but where are
the nine? . . . Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.”<a

<p>When Jesus was dining in a Pharisee’s house, a woman who was a
sinner brought an alabaster box of ointment, and, standing behind him
weeping, began to wash his feet with tears, wiped them with the hair
of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Now
the Pharisee spoke within himself: “This man, if he were a prophet,
would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth
him: for she is a sinner.” Jesus turned to the woman, and said to the
Pharisee: “Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou
gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with
tears, and wiped them with the hairs of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page100"></a>100</span> her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this
woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My
head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my
feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are
many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is
forgiven, the same loveth little.” And he said to her: “Thy sins are
forgiven. . . . Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.”<a

<p>Faith, then, is said to enable a person to work miracles, and to be
a ground for the remission of sins and a cure for sickness. Faith in
whom or in what? It has been alleged that Jesus nearly always uses the
word with the meaning of trust in the power and goodness of God.<a
name="FnAnchor472" href="#Footnote472"><span class="sp">472</span></a>
In proof of this reference is made to the stories of the centurion
whose servant was ill, of the four men who carried to Jesus the
paralytic, and of the woman whose faith was shown by her answer that
the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table. In
these, and in the other cases of faith recorded in connection with his
miracles, I can find nothing more than the belief that Jesus could
cure sickness or forgive sins. This is particularly obvious from the
question he put to the two blind men, “Believe ye that I am able to do
this?” and from their eyes being opened immediately after their
answer, “Yea, Lord.” On several occasions the faith was not even
displayed by the person who was cured, but by the supplicant.</p>

<p>In any case faith, whether in God or in Jesus, is no moral quality,
since the proper object of moral judgment is always the will; and the
reward for it is therefore no moral reward, but only a favour. At the
same time there can be no objection to such a favour from the moral
point of view; whereas the case is quite different with the
condemnation or punishment of the absence of faith. Of this little is
heard in the sayings of Jesus reported in the synoptic gospels, but we
nevertheless find there the germ of a doctrine which subsequently
assumed enormous importance in Christian theology. He said: “Whosoever
. . . shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my
Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him
will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.”<a
name="FnAnchor473" href="#Footnote473"><span class="sp">473</span></a>
Dean Rashdall suggests that here the representation of the evangelists
may have been more or less coloured by the later belief of Christ’s
followers and by the teaching of Paul and the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page101"></a>101</span> whole early Church as to the importance of
faith in Christ.<a name="FnAnchor474" href="#Footnote474"><span
class="sp">474</span></a> Jesus is also reported to have said: “He
that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth
not shall be damned.”<a name="FnAnchor475" href="#Footnote475"><span
class="sp">475</span></a> Such reflection on the necessity of baptism
betrays the relatively late origin of the passage; and it is known not
to have been an original part of Mark’s gospel.<a name="FnAnchor476"
href="#Footnote476"><span class="sp">476</span></a> If Jesus had
regarded salvation as conditional on belief in his Messiahship we
might expect him to have emphasised it. This is what he did according
to John.<a name="FnAnchor477" href="#Footnote477"><span
class="sp">477</span></a> But, as said above, the fourth gospel cannot
be recognised as a reliable source of information about the teaching
of Jesus.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI</h4>
<h3>THE ETHICS OF PAUL</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="smcap">HERE</span> was once a great persecution
against the church at Jerusalem. A young man, whose name was Saul,
then entered into every house, and haling men and women committed them
to prison. After that he went to the high priest and desired of him
letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found there any
disciples of the Lord, whether they were men or women, he might bring
them bound to Jerusalem. As he journeyed he came near Damascus; and
suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven. He fell to
the ground, and heard a voice saying to him: “Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me?” He said: “Who art thou, Lord?” He heard the
answer: “I am Jesus whom thou persecutest; it is hard for thee to kick
against the pricks.” He said, astonished and trembling: “Lord, what
wilt thou have me to do?” The answer was: “Arise, and go into the
city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.” The men who
journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but seeing no
man. When Saul rose from the ground he was blind, and was led by them
and brought into Damascus. There was in the city a certain disciple,
named Ananias, who also had a vision in which Jesus commanded him to
go and inquire for a man called Saul, of Tarsus. “He is a chosen
vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and
the children of Israel.” Ananias went to the house where Saul was
staying, put his hands on him, and told him that Jesus had sent him,
that Saul might receive his sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
Immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales. He arose
and was baptised, and preached straightway in the synagogues that
Christ was the Son of God.<a name="FnAnchor478"
href="#Footnote478"><span class="sp">478</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote478"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor478"><sup>478</sup></a></span> <i>Acts</i> viii. 1, 3,
ix. 1 <i>sqq.</i></p></div>

<p>There are in the Acts two other accounts of the vision and
conversion of Paul, represented as speeches delivered by himself.<a
name="FnAnchor479" href="#Footnote479"><span class="sp">479</span></a>
In one of them, that addressed to King Agrippa, Ananias is not
mentioned at all, but Jesus is alleged to have said to Paul: “I have
appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a
witness both of these things which thou <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page103"></a>103</span> hast seen, and of those things in the
which I will appear unto thee; Delivering thee from the people, and
from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, To open their eyes, and
to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto
God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among
them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.” In his epistles
Paul does not describe his vision, but insists that he has received
the gospel by the revelation of Jesus Christ, “when it pleased God,
who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, To
reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen.”<a
name="FnAnchor480" href="#Footnote480"><span class="sp">480</span></a>
He also writes: “Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen
Jesus Christ our Lord?”<a name="FnAnchor481" href="#Footnote481"><span
class="sp">481</span></a> And after pointing out that Jesus was seen
by all the apostles he adds: “And last of all he was seen of me also,
as of one born out of due time.”<a name="FnAnchor482"
href="#Footnote482"><span class="sp">482</span></a></p>

href="#FnAnchor482"><sup>482</sup></a></span> <i>Ibid.</i> xv. 7
<i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>From all these accounts it is obvious that Paul’s conversion was
due to a vision in which he believed himself to have seen Christ risen
in celestial glory; he was evidently predisposed to visions and
trances.<a name="FnAnchor483" href="#Footnote483"><span
class="sp">483</span></a> His vision of the risen Christ belonged to a
type which is familiar to students of modern conversions, in which a
complete division is established in the twinkling of an eye between
the old life and the new. Those who have had such an experience carry
away a feeling of its being a miracle. Voices are often heard, lights
are seen, or visions are witnessed, and it always seems, after the
surrender of the personal will, as if an extraneous higher power had
flooded in and taken possession of the person, as if he were partaking
directly of Christ’s substance, as if the deity were present in him.
Of this he has a joyous conviction, which has been called faith <i>par
excellence</i>.<a name="FnAnchor484" href="#Footnote484"><span
class="sp">484</span></a> According to James, the most striking
conversions of that kind have been permanent.<a name="FnAnchor485"
href="#Footnote485"><span class="sp">485</span></a> So also Starbuck
has found that “the effect of conversion is to bring with it a changed
attitude towards life, which is fairly constant and permanent,
although the feelings fluctuate. . . . The persons who have passed
through conversions, having once taken a stand for the religious life,
tend to feel themselves identified with it, no matter how much their
religious enthusiasm declines.”<a name="FnAnchor486"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page104"></a>104</span> Of all these
characteristics of conversion there is evidence in Paul’s own sayings:
“If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.”<a name="FnAnchor487"
href="#Footnote487"><span class="sp">487</span></a> “I am crucified
with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me:
and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the
Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”<a
name="FnAnchor488" href="#Footnote488"><span class="sp">488</span></a>
“In him we live, and move, and have our being.”<a name="FnAnchor489"
href="#Footnote489"><span class="sp">489</span></a> “If any man have
not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you,

According to Deissmann, the formula “in Christ” or “in the Lord” is
found 164 times in the Pauline epistles.<a name="FnAnchor494"
href="#Footnote494"><span class="sp">494</span></a> The most
conspicuous characteristic of all the elements of the conversion
crisis is the ecstasy of happiness produced.<a name="FnAnchor495"

again and again of the joy of faith, and exhorts his disciples to
rejoice.<a name="FnAnchor496" href="#Footnote496"><span

love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith.”<a

He speaks of “long-suffering with joyfulness”;<a name="FnAnchor498"
href="#Footnote498"><span class="sp">498</span></a> and after
recording his own torments and perils he writes: “I take pleasure in
infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in

<p>Faith in Jesus Christ is the keystone of Paul’s whole teaching. But
this faith was not a belief in his miracles, nor even a belief in his
Messiahship. In his estimation Christ was a divine being in whom
“dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,”<a name="FnAnchor500"

God,<a name="FnAnchor501" href="#Footnote501"><span

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105"></a>105</span> to Paul in his
glory was the crucified and risen Christ, whom he now knew as a
saviour, and whose message he felt called to preach to the world. As
Christ had risen from the grave, so also those who through their
belief in it were possessed by him would rise and be justified. Jesus
our Lord “was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our
justification. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord, Jesus Christ. . . . Being now justified by his
blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him . . . by whom we have
now received the atonement.”<a name="FnAnchor505"

up? and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest
is not quickened, except it die: And that which thou sowest, thou
sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of
wheat, or of some other grain: But God giveth it a body as it hath
pleased him, and to every seed his own body. . . . So also is the
resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in
incorruption: It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is
sown in weakness; it is raised in power; It is sown a natural body; it
is raised a spiritual body. . . . The trumpet shall sound, and the
dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality.”<a name="FnAnchor509" href="#Footnote509"><span

<p>At the beginning of our era Tarsus was a city of considerable
importance, which had reached a position of high standing on account
of its intellectual life and the general love of knowledge displayed
by his inhabitants. It had a university which was a centre of
Hellenistic philosophy, and even surpassed those of Athens and
Alexandria in respect of the eagerness of its students and in filling
its classroom with its own people, though it did not surpass them in
equipment or in standing and fame as a seat of learning.<a
name="FnAnchor523" href="#Footnote523"><span class="sp">523</span></a>
In Tarsus Paul came from his early boyhood in close contact with the
Græco-Roman world. He was a man of education, who had received a Greek
training. Greek was the only language which he used in his epistles,
and he read his Old Testament first and chiefly in Greek translation.
Even though it cannot be proved that he possessed such accurate
knowledge of Greek literature and philosophy as some of the Church
Fathers have attributed to him,<a name="FnAnchor524"
href="#Footnote524"><span class="sp">524</span></a> he did not
hesitate to enter into discussion with persons trained in Greek
philosophy.<a name="FnAnchor525" href="#Footnote525"><span
class="sp">525</span></a> It is of particular interest to note that a
famous philosopher, Athenodorus (74 <span
class="smcap">B.C.-A.D.</span> 7), who had influenced <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page107"></a>107</span> considerably the
thought of Seneca, had lived in Tarsus very near the time of which we
are speaking, and whose teaching was undoubtedly influential in the
university of Tarsus after his death.<a name="FnAnchor526"
href="#Footnote526"><span class="sp">526</span></a> There is reason to
believe that Paul was brought up in a society which was permeated by
Stoicism.<a name="FnAnchor527" href="#Footnote527"><span
class="sp">527</span></a> It is not improbable that his conversion, as
has been found to be the case with other religious conversions,<a
name="FnAnchor528" href="#Footnote528"><span class="sp">528</span></a>
was connected with a previous preparation for it in his own mind in
the form of a subconscious incubation which, when ripe, burst into
flower. If so, it is no wonder that he freed Christianity from its
nationalistic fetters, and transformed it into a world-religion of
salvation.</p>

<p>In Greece, philosophers had long before opposed national narrowness
and prejudice. Democritus of Abdera said that every country is
accessible to a wise man, and that a good soul’s fatherland is the
whole earth.<a name="FnAnchor529" href="#Footnote529"><span
class="sp">529</span></a> The same view was expressed by Theodorus,
one of the later Cyrenaics, who denounced devotion to country as
ridiculous.<a name="FnAnchor530" href="#Footnote530"><span
class="sp">530</span></a> The Cynics in particular, attached slight
value to the citizenship of any special state, declaring themselves to
be citizens of the world.<a name="FnAnchor531"
href="#Footnote531"><span class="sp">531</span></a> But, as Zeller
observes, in the mouth of the Cynic this doctrine was meant to express
not so much the essential oneness of all mankind, as the philosopher’s
independence of country and home.<a name="FnAnchor532"
href="#Footnote532"><span class="sp">532</span></a> It was the Stoic
philosophy that first gave to the idea of a world-citizenship a
definite positive meaning, and raised it to historical importance. The
citizen of Alexander’s huge empire had in a way become a citizen of
the world; and national dislikes were so much more readily overcome
since the various nationalities comprised in it were united not only
under a common government but also in a common culture.<a
name="FnAnchor533" href="#Footnote533"><span class="sp">533</span></a>
Indeed, the founder of Stoicism was himself only half a Greek. But
there is also an intrinsic connection between the cosmopolitan idea
and the Stoic system in general. According to the Stoics, human
society has for its basis the identity of reason in individuals; hence
we have no ground for limiting this society to a single nation. We are
all, says Seneca, members of one great body, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page108"></a>108</span> the universe; “we are all akin by Nature,
who has formed us of the same elements, and placed us here together
for the same end.”<a name="FnAnchor534" href="#Footnote534"><span
class="sp">534</span></a> As Marcus Aurelius puts it, “the world is in
a manner a state,” including all rational beings, to which the
individual states are related as the houses of a city are to the city
collectively.<a name="FnAnchor535" href="#Footnote535"><span
class="sp">535</span></a> And the wise man will esteem it far above
any particular community in which the accident of birth has placed
him.<a name="FnAnchor536" href="#Footnote536"><span

<p>Besides Stoic influence there may have been another cause that made
for the universalising of Christianity, namely the Logos-doctrine, of
which elements are clearly discernible in the Pauline epistles; it is
difficult to doubt that this doctrine influenced his conception of
Christ. It could look back to a long history, but assumed definite
shape as a metaphysical theory particularly in the religious
philosophy of Philo Judæus of Alexandria, who was a contemporary of
Jesus. According to this theory nobody can approach God&mdash;the
immaterial, unknowable, ineffable, self-existent Being. Nor was it
possible that God should intervene directly in the process of
creation; only indirectly could his function as cause of the universe
be accomplished. God proceeded therefore according to a plan. He made
use of an image of his own essence, an ideal image that remains
intimately united with himself. The universe comes into existence
through the instrumentality of this divine mediator. All that it
possesses of spirit, soul, of forms and values, of patterns and ideas,
issues from, or is rooted in, the supreme Reason, the Logos. The term
<i>Logos</i> stood for many things, but in the teaching of Philo it
was the equivalent of the world’s wisdom or the world’s image.<a
name="FnAnchor537" href="#Footnote537"><span class="sp">537</span></a>
And in this sense it appears in Pauline literature. Jesus is spoken of
as “the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
in earth, visible and invisible.”<a name="FnAnchor538"
href="#Footnote538"><span class="sp">538</span></a></p>

<p>Paul looked upon the process of redemption as a mystery. He
declares that the wisdom he speaks of is “not the wisdom of this
world,” but “the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom,
which God ordained before the world unto our glory. . . . Let no man
deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this
world, let him become <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page109"></a>109</span> a fool, that he may be wise. For the
wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He
taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord knoweth
the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.”<a name="FnAnchor539"
href="#Footnote539"><span class="sp">539</span></a> But the redemption
is not only a mystery: there is also magic in it. This appears from
the importance which Paul attaches to baptism and the Eucharist.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote539"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor539"><sup>539</sup></a></span> <i>1 Corinthians</i> ii.

<p>There is no evidence that Jesus instituted baptism, but every
reason to believe that he did not do so. It never appears among the
conditions of discipleship. The passage in Mark’s gospel about him who
believes and is baptised is not an original part of it.<a
name="FnAnchor540" href="#Footnote540"><span class="sp">540</span></a>
John’s report of Jesus’ answer to Nicodemus, that “except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God,”<a name="FnAnchor541" href="#Footnote541"><span
class="sp">541</span></a> cannot be relied upon. And the same is the
case with the commandment attributed to Jesus by Matthew, “Go ye
therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,”<a name="FnAnchor542"
href="#Footnote542"><span class="sp">542</span></a> which has been
regarded as the central piece of evidence for the traditional view of
the institution of baptism by Jesus.<a name="FnAnchor543"
href="#Footnote543"><span class="sp">543</span></a> Harnack points out
that for two reasons Jesus could not have uttered it. First, it is
only a later stage of the tradition that represents the risen Christ
as delivering speeches and giving commandments&mdash;Paul knows
nothing of it; secondly, the Trinitarian formula is foreign to the
mouth of Jesus and has not the authority in the Apostolic age which it
must have had, if it descended from Jesus himself.<a
name="FnAnchor544" href="#Footnote544"><span class="sp">544</span></a>
Further, if Paul had known of such a commission to baptise he could
hardly have said, as he does: “Christ sent me not to baptise, but to
preach the gospel.”<a name="FnAnchor545" href="#Footnote545"><span
class="sp">545</span></a> At the same time he knows of no other way of
receiving the Gentiles into the Christian community than by baptism.
He writes: “By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body, whether
we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free.”<a
name="FnAnchor546" href="#Footnote546"><span class="sp">546</span></a>
We may perhaps assume that the practice of baptism was continued in
consequence of Jesus’ recognition of John the Baptist and his baptism,
even after John himself was removed; in the fourth gospel it is said
that Jesus did not baptise, but that his disciples did.<a
name="FnAnchor547" href="#Footnote547"><span class="sp">547</span></a>
John had preached “the baptism of repentance for the remission of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110"></a>110</span> sins”;<a
name="FnAnchor548" href="#Footnote548"><span class="sp">548</span></a>
and Paul also regarded baptism as a cleansing from sin,<a
name="FnAnchor549" href="#Footnote549"><span class="sp">549</span></a>
but predominantly as a reincarnation of Christ’s death and rising to
immortality; “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptised into
Jesus Christ were baptised into his death? Therefore we are buried
with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from
the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness
of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:
Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of
sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.”<a

<p>Lietzmann observes that Paul’s mystic sacramentalism in regard to
baptism was in closest contact with the belief of the church of the
“Hellenists” and must surely have appeared to many a Corinthian as an
infallible means of purging away sin and as a guarantee of future
salvation.<a name="FnAnchor551" href="#Footnote551"><span
class="sp">551</span></a> In the Mysteries which at that time were
spread throughout Asia Minor and Greece we find rites of ablution from
which a new birth was expected; mention was made of “dying” in the
figurative sense, as the high priest of Isis says in Apuleius;<a
name="FnAnchor552" href="#Footnote552"><span class="sp">552</span></a>
use was made of the magic power of a name or some other formula; and
the result was considered to be salvation due to the union of the
initiate with the god.<a name="FnAnchor553" href="#Footnote553"><span
class="sp">553</span></a> Tertullian noticed the resemblance, and
argued that demons, whose chief employment was to prevent mankind from
embracing the worship of the true God, endeavoured to preoccupy the
minds of men by imitating rites having some similarity to those which
were to be observed under the gospel, and that baptism was thus by
their suggestion introduced into the Eleusinian mysteries as a mode of
initiation, being an imitation of Christian baptism.<a
name="FnAnchor554" href="#Footnote554"><span class="sp">554</span></a>
The Eleusinian purificatory bath, from which the candidate emerged a
new man with a new name, was also referred to by Greek Fathers,
especially Clement of Alexandria, as a parallel to the Christian rite
of baptism both in its nature and in its intended effects.<a
name="FnAnchor555" href="#Footnote555"><span class="sp">555</span></a>
In any case we must <span class="pagenum"><a

the latter and increased the importance attached to baptism in the
Christian world.</p>

<p>Various writers regard Paul’s sacramental conception of baptism as
an alien body in his system as a whole, incongruous with his general
doctrine of justification by faith;<a name="FnAnchor556"
href="#Footnote556"><span class="sp">556</span></a> and, though he no
doubt considered faith a necessary preliminary to it, it is fairly
obvious that he attributed to baptism magical efficacy. Some
statements to this effect have already been quoted, and others may be
added, such as: “By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body”;<a
name="FnAnchor557" href="#Footnote557"><span class="sp">557</span></a>
“As many of you as have been baptised into Christ have put on
Christ.”<a name="FnAnchor558" href="#Footnote558"><span

argued that he leaves us in the dark as to his own opinion about it.<a

But it seems more to the point that he does not reprove the

<p>Like baptism the Last Supper is mentioned in the synoptic gospels.
They contain three passages dealing with it. When eating with his
disciples Jesus “took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to
them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. And he took the cup, and
when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of
it. And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
which is shed for many. Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of
the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the
kingdom of God.”<a name="FnAnchor562" href="#Footnote562"><span
class="sp">562</span></a> There is a similar account in Matthew, which
is dependent on Mark.<a name="FnAnchor563" href="#Footnote563"><span
class="sp">563</span></a> The third account, found in Luke, contains
the addition, “This do in remembrance of me.”<a name="FnAnchor564"
href="#Footnote564"><span class="sp">564</span></a> This does not
occur in some early Western authorities, and is therefore regarded by
almost all critics as a later insertion influenced by the passage in
Corinthians on the subject.<a name="FnAnchor565"
href="#Footnote565"><span class="sp">565</span></a> It <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page112"></a>112</span> has also been contended
by many scholars that the account of Mark (on which Matthew depends)
shows traces of Pauline influence, especially in the language which
describes the cup as “my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
many.”<a name="FnAnchor566" href="#Footnote566"><span
class="sp">566</span></a> Conybeare argues that the agreement is so
close that either Mark must have copied Paul or Paul Mark, and that
the latter hypothesis is ruled out by the fact that the Pauline
epistle is older than the Gospel of Mark.<a name="FnAnchor567"
href="#Footnote567"><span class="sp">567</span></a> Montefiore
observes how difficult it is to believe that a Palestinian or Galilæan
Jew could have suggested that, in drinking wine, his disciples were,
even symbolically, drinking blood, considering the horror with which
the drinking of blood was regarded by the Jews.<a name="FnAnchor568"

<p>In any case it is a widespread opinion that the only trace of a
mystic meaning given to the Eucharist in the gospels is a later
incorporation that could have no meaning save in the mystery-salvation
through Christ as conceived by Paul. For him it was a sacrament and a
mystical re-enactment of the death and resurrection of Christ through
which the believer participates in his immortality, the bread and wine
being an incarnation of his body and blood: “The cup of blessing which
we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread
which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we
being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of
that one bread. Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat
the sacrifices partakers of the altar?”<a name="FnAnchor569"
href="#Footnote569"><span class="sp">569</span></a> In reproving the
Corinthians for profaning the Lord’s Supper Paul wrote to them: “As
often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord’s
death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and
drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body
and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him
eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and
drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not
discerning the Lord’s body.”<a name="FnAnchor570"
href="#Footnote570"><span class="sp">570</span></a> As Loisy observes,
“in the ardent imagination of the Apostle, the bread broken for the
Lord’s Supper assimilates itself to Christ crucified for the
elimination of sin, the wine of the cup identifies itself with the
blood spilt for the salvation of mankind.”<a name="FnAnchor571"
href="#Footnote571"><span class="sp">571</span></a> The <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page113"></a>113</span> “worthy” participation
in the Supper may have presupposed faith, but the essence of the rite
was undoubtedly the magical effect ascribed to the bodily communion
with Christ by partaking of his body and blood.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the sacramental form of the Eucharist exhibited
by Paul cannot have been a creation of Jesus, nor can it have come
from strict Judaism; but there were striking parallels to it in the
pagan world. There was a series of cults in the Roman Empire which
offered a happy immortality to their initiates, and the method of
obtaining it was by means of sacraments. In several of those mysteries
blood played a very important part. It was an extremely common belief
in the ancient world that by drinking the blood it was possible to
absorb the qualities of the god whose blood was used.<a
name="FnAnchor572" href="#Footnote572"><span class="sp">572</span></a>
All the mystery gods were intercessors and saviours, and the object of
the initiates was to attain, through identification with the god, a
share in his blessed immortality.<a name="FnAnchor573"
href="#Footnote573"><span class="sp">573</span></a> Paul was plainly
aware of those pagan parallels. After speaking of the bread and the
cup of communion, he refers to the things which the Gentiles
“sacrifice to devils, and not to God,” and warns the Corinthians that
they “cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of
devils.”<a name="FnAnchor574" href="#Footnote574"><span
class="sp">574</span></a> The Corinthians evidently regarded the
Eucharist as food and drink by consuming which they enjoyed
participation in the life of Jesus; just as the participants in the
Eleusinian mysteries believed that they became <span class="transl" title="e)/ntheoi"><i>ἔνθεοι</i></span> by
means of a meal in which they partook, in some mysterious manner, of
the body of Dionysus.<a name="FnAnchor575" href="#Footnote575"><span
class="sp">575</span></a> The words of dislike and contempt with which
Paul speaks of the pagan mysteries do not prove that he was
uninfluenced by them. His own terminology rather suggests the reverse.
He may have been, half-unconsciously, allured by them. Where ideas are
in the air men may catch them by a sort of infection, and often
without any notion whence they came.<a name="FnAnchor576"

<p>The centre of Paul’s Christianity is the doctrine of redemption
through the crucified and risen Christ. He never speaks of Jesus as a
teacher or of his teaching, he extremely seldom appeals to any words
of Jesus as a moral norm, he never refers to his example of life in
any concrete situation.<a name="FnAnchor577" href="#Footnote577"><span
class="sp">577</span></a> His <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page114"></a>114</span> preoccupation with the death and
resurrection of Jesus was no doubt immediately due to his vision, but
to this vision he may have been predisposed by pagan cults known to
him from his boyhood at Tarsus, which were much occupied with divine
beings who had died and had risen again, who were, in fact, for ever
dying and for ever rising again, to the joy of their worshippers. We
have evidence that his native city was thronged with such mysteries,
the myths and rites of Isis and Osiris, of Dionysus, Cybele, and
Attis. The leading deities were Sandon-Herakles and Baal-Tarz. The
former was popularly associated with the same ideas of death and
resurrection as pervaded the worship of Adonis, Tammur, and Osiris.
Baal-Tarz, again, pre-eminently “Lord of Tarsus,” was the giver of
vegetation and every good gift, and his picture, as seen on the coins
of the fourth century before Christ, looks as noble as the Greek Zeus,
whom he greatly resembled in character. Hans Böhlig has made it
perfectly clear that Paul adopted his terminology, and perhaps his
method of unfolding the redemptive scheme of a deified Christ, to the
preconceptions of his Gentile fellow-citizens, who from childhood had
been taught the mystic religion of Sandon.<a name="FnAnchor578"
href="#Footnote578"><span class="sp">578</span></a> But the
resemblance between Paul’s teaching and the mystery religions is not
merely a formal one, apart from its sacramentalism, of which I have
already spoken. In those religions, also, there was a divine saviour
through which the believers hoped to reach a state of salvation not
only in this life but in the world beyond the grave. While the
synoptists emphasise a speedy coming of the Son of man to judge the
nations and to found a reign of saints upon earth, Paul turned the
eyes of Christians towards a spiritual heaven where he who dies with
Christ will live for ever. This is a doctrine of the same class as the
doctrines taught by pagan mystery religions.<a name="FnAnchor579"
href="#Footnote579"><span class="sp">579</span></a> From the moral
point of view there is of course an enormous difference between Christ
and the pagan gods. But those writers who maintain that Paul was in no
way influenced by the mysteries&mdash;not even indirectly by the
atmosphere which they diffused&mdash;fail to account for those points
in which his teaching so closely resembles them.</p>

<p>At the same time Paul says himself that “Christ died for our <span

scriptures.”<a name="FnAnchor580" href="#Footnote580"><span

<p>It has been alleged that Paul’s doctrine of justification by faith
also is due to Hellenic influence,<a name="FnAnchor585"
href="#Footnote585"><span class="sp">585</span></a> while he himself
refers to the Old Testament as his authority.<a name="FnAnchor586"
href="#Footnote586"><span class="sp">586</span></a> But it seems that
the immense importance which he attaches to faith was in the first
place the outcome of his ecstatic vision. This is suggested by
knowledge which we have of other sudden conversions. “Beliefs,” says
William James, “are strengthened wherever automatisms corroborate
them. Incursions from beyond the transmarginal region have a peculiar
power to increase conviction.”<a name="FnAnchor587"

href="#Footnote591"><span class="sp">591</span></a> it <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page116"></a>116</span> presupposes in the
first place the acceptance of some fact as true; and such a belief
cannot be a proper object of moral judgment. But even if the sin of
unbelief, as Thomas Aquinas argues, has its cause in the will because
it consists in “contrary opposition to the faith, whereby one stands
out against the hearing of the faith,”<a name="FnAnchor592"
href="#Footnote592"><span class="sp">592</span></a> it could not be
imputed to anybody who never heard of the faith. Paul considers this
question in connection with his tenet that whosoever shall call upon
the name of the Lord shall be saved: “How then shall they call on him
in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of
whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
. . . I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into
all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.”<a
name="FnAnchor593" href="#Footnote593"><span class="sp">593</span></a>
Even now, after the lapse of nearly two thousand years this reassuring
statement has not become true. In another passage, however, there is
an indication that God might have mercy even upon unbelievers.<a

<p>In the most important cycle of Paul’s teaching salvation is not, as
it is generally depicted in the synoptic gospels, a reward for
righteous conduct. “A man is justified by faith without the deeds of
the law.”<a name="FnAnchor595" href="#Footnote595"><span
class="sp">595</span></a> “Before faith came, we were kept under the
law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that
we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are
no longer under a schoolmaster. For ye are all the children of God by
faith in Christ Jesus.”<a name="FnAnchor596" href="#Footnote596"><span
class="sp">596</span></a> “To him that worketh not, but believeth on
him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness.”<a name="FnAnchor597" href="#Footnote597"><span
class="sp">597</span></a> And the faith itself is a gift of God: “God
hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.”<a name="FnAnchor598"
href="#Footnote598"><span class="sp">598</span></a> Salvation depends
upon an “election of grace.”<a name="FnAnchor599"
href="#Footnote599"><span class="sp">599</span></a> “Whom he did
foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his
Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called,
them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
glorified.”<a name="FnAnchor600" href="#Footnote600"><span

<p>Those who believe are justified by the grace of God “through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a
propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness
for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
God.”<a name="FnAnchor602" href="#Footnote602"><span
class="sp">602</span></a> Christ “died for all, that they which live
should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died
for them, and rose again. . . . God was in Christ, reconciling the
world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
committed unto us the word of reconciliation.”<a name="FnAnchor603"
href="#Footnote603"><span class="sp">603</span></a> It is thus by the
vicarious suffering of Jesus that the wrath of God, aroused by the sin
of men, is appeased. How is that possible? Paul writes: “As by one man
sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon
all men, for that all have sinned. . . . If by one man’s offence death
reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of
the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.
Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to
condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came
upon all men unto justification of life. . . . As sin hath reigned
unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto
eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.”<a name="FnAnchor604"

<p>The idea that all mankind are doomed to death on account of Adam’s
sin, which Paul no doubt had imbibed from his Jewish upbringing, is
explicable by the conception of sin as a kind of material substance or
infection which is transmitted by propagation.<a name="FnAnchor605"
href="#Footnote605"><span class="sp">605</span></a> As we have seen
above, the Prophets already broke with the old notions of divine
vengeance by declaring that “every one shall die for his own
iniquity,” that “the soul that sinneth, it shall die.”<a
name="FnAnchor606" href="#Footnote606"><span class="sp">606</span></a>
And Ezekiel added that as the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon
him, so also “the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him.”<a
name="FnAnchor607" href="#Footnote607"><span class="sp">607</span></a>
This is in agreement with the fact that the moral emotions of
disapproval or approval, in their capacity of retributive emotions,
are hostile <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118"></a>118</span> or
friendly attitudes of mind towards living beings conceived as causes
of pain or pleasure. They cannot admit that a person is punished or
rewarded on account of another person’s behaviour. There cannot be a
merit by transfer.</p>

<p>But apart from this, Paul’s doctrine of redemption raises the
question how Christ’s suffering and death could be a means of
justification at all. Paul says that “Christ our passover is
sacrificed for us.”<a name="FnAnchor608" href="#Footnote608"><span
class="sp">608</span></a> The idea of Christ’s death being a sacrifice
is also found in the Epistle to the Ephesians,<a name="FnAnchor609"
href="#Footnote609"><span class="sp">609</span></a> the authorship of
which is disputed, and is set forth in detail in the Epistle to the
Hebrews,<a name="FnAnchor610" href="#Footnote610"><span
class="sp">610</span></a> which is related to Paulinism. The bloody
sacrifices of the law have been succeeded by the redemption which
Christ obtained for us “by the sacrifice of himself” being offered “to
bear the sins of many.”<a name="FnAnchor611" href="#Footnote611"><span
class="sp">611</span></a> “We are sanctified through the offering of
the body of Jesus Christ once for all. . . . By one offering he hath
perfected for ever them that are sanctified. . . . There is no more
offering for sin.”<a name="FnAnchor612" href="#Footnote612"><span
class="sp">612</span></a> This theory was subsequently elaborated by
Cyprian. Christ’s suffering and death constituted a sacrifice
calculated to propitiate an angry God; and this thought was never
afterwards lost sight of in the West. I shall return to this subject
in a following chapter.</p>

<p>Are we to conclude then that the teaching of Paul is devoid of all
ethical significance. By no means. He asks: “What shall we say then?
Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. . . .
Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God
forbid.”<a name="FnAnchor613" href="#Footnote613"><span
class="sp">613</span></a> His epistles are full of moral injunctions.
On the one hand he wrote that “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
of the law”;<a name="FnAnchor614" href="#Footnote614"><span
class="sp">614</span></a> that he found “the commandment, which was
ordained to life, . . . to be unto death”;<a name="FnAnchor615"
href="#Footnote615"><span class="sp">615</span></a> that “the law
worketh wrath”;<a name="FnAnchor616" href="#Footnote616"><span
class="sp">616</span></a> that “the strength of sin is the law.”<a
name="FnAnchor617" href="#Footnote617"><span class="sp">617</span></a>
But on the other hand he also wrote that “the law is holy, and the
commandment holy, and just, and good.”<a name="FnAnchor618"
href="#Footnote618"><span class="sp">618</span></a> Different
explanations have been given of these contradictory statements;<a
name="FnAnchor619" href="#Footnote619"><span class="sp">619</span></a>
but the most satisfactory one seems to be that when Paul speaks of the
law he does not always mean the same thing.<a name="FnAnchor620"
href="#Footnote620"><span class="sp">620</span></a> He does not
definitely distinguish <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page119"></a>119</span> between ritual and the strictly ethical
parts of the Israelitish legislation. But he says that no man should
be judged “in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of
the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to
come.”<a name="FnAnchor621" href="#Footnote621"><span
class="sp">621</span></a> He contrasts “the circumcision, which is
outward in the flesh,” with the circumcision “of the heart.”<a
name="FnAnchor622" href="#Footnote622"><span class="sp">622</span></a>
And above all, he makes the parallel statements that all the law is
fulfilled in one word, namely this: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself”;<a name="FnAnchor623" href="#Footnote623"><span
class="sp">623</span></a> and that “he that loveth another hath
fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou
shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false
witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment,
it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself. . . . Therefore love is the fulfilling of the
law.”<a name="FnAnchor624" href="#Footnote624"><span
class="sp">624</span></a> He also writes: “Bless them which persecute
you: bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep
with them that weep. . . . Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide
things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as
lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. . . . Avenge not
yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written,
Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine
enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing
thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil,
but overcome evil with good.”<a name="FnAnchor625"
href="#Footnote625"><span class="sp">625</span></a> “Put on therefore,
as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness,
humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering; Forbearing one another,
and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any. . .
. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
perfectness.”<a name="FnAnchor626" href="#Footnote626"><span
class="sp">626</span></a> “Though I speak with the tongues of men and
of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and
understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all
faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though
I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not;
charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself
unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page120"></a>120</span> but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all
things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
Charity never faileth. . . . And now abideth faith, hope, charity,
these three; but the greatest of these is charity.”<a

<p>How can these sayings be reconciled with the doctrine of
justification by faith only? An obvious answer would be that faith
produces, or manifests itself in, obedience to the law and charity;
that good works are not the condition of righteousness, but
righteousness, received as a divine gift by faith, is the condition of
good works. There are passages in the epistles which directly express
this idea: “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid:
yea, we establish the law.”<a name="FnAnchor628"
href="#Footnote628"><span class="sp">628</span></a> “How shall we,
that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”<a name="FnAnchor629"
href="#Footnote629"><span class="sp">629</span></a> Faith “worketh by
love”;<a name="FnAnchor630" href="#Footnote630"><span
class="sp">630</span></a> in another passage love is said to belong to
“the fruit of the Spirit.”<a name="FnAnchor631"
href="#Footnote631"><span class="sp">631</span></a> If Christ lives in
the believer it must influence his whole conduct. The Christlikeness
of the faithful is in some passages expressed in imperatives: “As ye
have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him”;<a
name="FnAnchor632" href="#Footnote632"><span class="sp">632</span></a>
“Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the
things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ
Jesus”;<a name="FnAnchor633" href="#Footnote633"><span

<p>The great emphasis which Paul lays on charity is quite in agreement
with what we find in modern narratives of conversion. “I had more
tender feeling towards my family and friends”;&mdash;“I spoke at once
to a person with whom I had been angry”;&mdash;“I felt for every one,
and loved my friends better”;&mdash;“I felt everybody to be my
friend”;&mdash;“I began to work for others”;&mdash;these are so many
expressions from the records collected by Starbuck.<a
name="FnAnchor635" href="#Footnote635"><span class="sp">635</span></a>
Sainte-Beuve observes that in Christians of different epochs there is
a fundamental and identical spirit of piety and charity, common to
those who have received grace; an inner state which before all things
is one of love and humility, of infinite confidence in God, and of
severity for one’s self, accompanied with tenderness for others. The
fruits peculiar to this condition of the soul have the same savour in
all, under distant suns and in different surroundings, in Saint Teresa
of Avila just as in any Moravian brother of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page121"></a>121</span> Herrnhut.<a name="FnAnchor636"
href="#Footnote636"><span class="sp">636</span></a> Justin Martyr
wrote about the wonderful change in manners of other converts: “We,
who loved nothing like our possessions, now produce all we have in
common and spread our whole stock before our indigent brethren; we,
who were pointed with mutual hatred and destruction, and would not so
much as warm ourselves at the same fire with those of a different
tribe on account of different institutions, now since the coming of
Christ cohabit and diet together, and pray for our enemies; and all
our returns for evil are but the gentlest persuasives to convert those
who unjustly hate us, that by living up to the same virtuous precepts
of Christ they might be filled with the same comfortable hopes of
obtaining the like happiness with ourselves, from that God who is Lord
of all things. . . . I could give you a proof of the influence of such
bright examples from many converts among us, who from men of violence
and oppression were transformed into quite another nature.”<a
name="FnAnchor637" href="#Footnote637"><span class="sp">637</span></a>
Pagans bore witness to the correctness of the picture drawn by the
apologetics.<a name="FnAnchor638" href="#Footnote638"><span
class="sp">638</span></a> Pliny wrote in a letter to <span
class="correction" title="amended from Trojan">Trajan</span> that
Christians said they had bound themselves by an oath not to commit any
wicked deed, but to abstain from theft and robbery and adultery, and
not withhold a deposit when reclaimed.<a name="FnAnchor639"
href="#Footnote639"><span class="sp">639</span></a> In recent times
the Welsh revival of 1904&mdash;5 was accompanied by a real decrease
in crime. Family life was restored by the abandonment of drinking
habits, long-standing quarrels were made up, enemies were reconciled,
ancient wrongs repaired, bad debts paid, stolen property restored.<a
name="FnAnchor640" href="#Footnote640"><span class="sp">640</span></a>
Nowadays we also hear of moral reformation among converts to the
Oxford Movement. A manifestation of the altruism of converted men and
women is their missionary zeal&mdash;their burning desire to tell
others of their experience that they may share their blessings.
Throughout the history of Christianity those who have experienced the
more sudden kind of conversion have generally been the most zealous
missionaries.<a name="FnAnchor641" href="#Footnote641"><span
class="sp">641</span></a> Foremost among these was Paul.<a

<p>From the moral point of view, however, there is positive danger in
a doctrine that relies upon love of fellow-men and good deeds as the
fruits of faith. To an ecstatic convert like <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page122"></a>122</span> Paul faith may seem a sufficient source of
such love and anything it carries with it, but in an established
religion the faith of the ordinary believer may fail entirely to
produce similar effects. Already in the Apostolic age his formula
about righteousness and salvation by faith alone was taken advantage
of as a cloak of laxity; it was said that one might have the true
faith though in this case that faith remained dead or was united with
immorality.<a name="FnAnchor643" href="#Footnote643"><span
class="sp">643</span></a> James evidently saw this danger when he
wrote in his Epistle: “What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man
say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? . . . Faith
without works is dead.”<a name="FnAnchor644" href="#Footnote644"><span
class="sp">644</span></a> Ordinary men are not mystics; and ecstatic
converts are dangerous founders of religious creeds. The emphasis laid
on orthodox belief has not only, more than anything else, brought the
Christian religion into conflict with the nature of moral emotions and
ideas, but also, through the persecutions to which it has led, been
one of the most potent causes of misery in the Christian world.</p>

<p>But we notice also another line of thought in the Pauline epistles,
which is more in harmony with the teaching of Jesus as recorded in the
synoptic gospels. He writes to the Romans not only that a man is
justified by faith without the deeds of the law, but also that God
will show himself as a righteous judge “who will render to every man
according to his deeds: To them who by patient continuance in well
doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: But
unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey
unrighteousness, indignation and wrath. . . . We shall all stand
before the judgment seat of Christ. . . . Every one of us shall give
account of himself to God.”<a name="FnAnchor645"
href="#Footnote645"><span class="sp">645</span></a> In other epistles
he writes: “We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to
that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”<a name="FnAnchor646"
href="#Footnote646"><span class="sp">646</span></a> “Every man shall
receive his own reward according to his own labour. . . . Every man’s
work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it
shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of
what sort it is. If any man’s work abide which he hath built
thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man’s work shall be
burned, he shall suffer loss.”<a name="FnAnchor647"
href="#Footnote647"><span class="sp">647</span></a> “Whatsoever a man
soweth, that shall he also <span class="pagenum"><a

But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath
done: and there is no respect of persons.”<a name="FnAnchor649"
href="#Footnote649"><span class="sp">649</span></a> When Paul mentions
the deeds of men he does not overlook their cast of mind. He speaks of
“the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ,”<a

<p>It may be argued that if a person is justified by his faith, which
is a gift of God, and good deeds are manifestations of it, his
“reward” for them is really due to the faith which God has given him,
and that the damnation of a person who has done evil is due to the
fact that he has not received the gift of faith from God; whereas if
he receives such a gift, and is justified thereby, he will do no evil
again. Such a conclusion might be drawn from the following passage:
“Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind.
Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of
you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in
the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”<a
name="FnAnchor652" href="#Footnote652"><span class="sp">652</span></a>
But Paul was not a consistent thinker. On the one hand he teaches that
justification depends upon faith alone, that faith is a gift of God,
that man’s work really is God’s work,<a name="FnAnchor653"
href="#Footnote653"><span class="sp">653</span></a> nay that it even
was God who gave Israel “the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should
not see, and ears that they should not hear”;<a name="FnAnchor654"
href="#Footnote654"><span class="sp">654</span></a> but on the other
hand he also looks upon the activity of the human will as a factor of
importance.<a name="FnAnchor655" href="#Footnote655"><span
class="sp">655</span></a> His inconsistency is nowhere more glaring
than in the passage in which he tells the Philippians to work out
their own salvation <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page124"></a>124</span> “with fear and trembling,” and then adds
immediately: “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to
do of his good pleasure.”<a name="FnAnchor656"
href="#Footnote656"><span class="sp">656</span></a> When he speaks of
the retribution for good and evil deeds, he is obviously moved by his
moral consciousness, which repeatedly finds expression without any
reference to justification by faith. In his epistles to the Romans and
to the Corinthians he frequently refers to “conscience,” or
<i>syneídēsis</i>, a term which he evidently had adopted from his
Hellenistic surroundings,<a name="FnAnchor657"
href="#Footnote657"><span class="sp">657</span></a> and speaks of the
“witness” it bears.<a name="FnAnchor658" href="#Footnote658"><span
class="sp">658</span></a> And he finds a conscience not only among the
Christians, but in every man;<a name="FnAnchor659"
href="#Footnote659"><span class="sp">659</span></a> and makes the
following remarkable statement: “Not the hearers of the law are just
before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. For when the
Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in
the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: Which
shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience
also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or
else excusing one another.”<a name="FnAnchor660"

<p>As Christ lives in the believer he must not soil his body: “Know ye
not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth
in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.”<a
name="FnAnchor661" href="#Footnote661"><span class="sp">661</span></a>
And as Christ was crucified, so the believer must crucify his flesh
that he also may live eternally in the spirit, for the flesh is evil
and contrary to the spirit. “If Christ be in you, the body is dead
because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But
if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,
he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal
bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. . . . If ye live after the
flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds
of the body, ye shall live.”<a name="FnAnchor662"

cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit

the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and
the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the
other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. But if ye be led
of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh
are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page125"></a>125</span> hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
strife, seditions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness,
revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have
also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not
inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness,
temperance: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ’s
have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in
the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of
vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.”<a

“To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life

<p>Though Paul connects his idea that the believer must die to the
flesh, that he might live immortally in the spirit, with the death and
resurrection of Christ, it may be asked where he had learnt to have
such a moral contempt and horror of the flesh and to identify it with
sin. This is not a Jewish conception. As Montefiore points out, Paul
could not possibly have taken sin so sombrely as he did, had he been
simply a Palestinian rabbi of his day. To the rabbinic Jew repentance
and forgiveness were forces greater than sin, greater than the evil
inclination. To Paul it was not so. He was no rabbinic Jew, and of the
Law he knew little more than the fetters. He had always the horrid
feeling of the unconquered evil inclination gnawing within his soul.<a
name="FnAnchor666" href="#Footnote666"><span class="sp">666</span></a>
Nor did the rabbis oppose flesh and spirit in the same way as they are
opposed in the writings of Paul. The spirit and flesh doctrine of the
eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans could not have been
devised by anyone who to his rabbinic antecedents merely added a
conviction that the Messiah had appeared in the person of Jesus.<a
name="FnAnchor667" href="#Footnote667"><span class="sp">667</span></a>
The man who devised that doctrine had been subjected to other
influences. Paul, who was a Greek Jew, may have derived his idea of
the sharp severance between flesh and spirit and his condemnation of
the flesh from the Judaism of the Diaspora, which was greatly
influenced by its Græco-Oriental environment. The antithesis of spirit
and body was an old Platonic idea, and the doctrine that bodily
enjoyments are low and degrading was taught by many pagan
philosophers; even a man like Cicero says that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page126"></a>126</span> all corporeal pleasure
is opposed to virtue and ought to be rejected.<a name="FnAnchor668"
href="#Footnote668"><span class="sp">668</span></a> And in the
Neo-Platonic and Neo-Pythagorean schools of Alexandria an ascetic
ideal of life was the natural outcome of their theory that God alone
is pure and good, and matter impure and evil.</p>

<p>Paul’s identification of flesh with evil led to various ascetic
rules. “Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
things.”<a name="FnAnchor669" href="#Footnote669"><span

athletes;<a name="FnAnchor672" href="#Footnote672"><span

of other seriously-minded followers of Christ. “I keep under my body,

<p>The worst of all sins of the flesh is sexual indulgence: “Flee
fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he
that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. What? know
ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you,
which ye have of God, and ye are not your own.”<a name="FnAnchor674"
href="#Footnote674"><span class="sp">674</span></a> Even marriage is
permitted to man as a restraint, however imperfect, on the sinful
licentiousness of the sexual impulse (Paul said nothing about
propagation): “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife,
and let every woman have her own husband. . . . I say therefore to the
unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But
if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than
to burn.” He that giveth his virgin in marriage “doeth well; but he
that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.”<a name="FnAnchor675"
href="#Footnote675"><span class="sp">675</span></a> For this
inferiority of marriage to the unmarried state he gives the following
reason: “He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the
Lord, how he may please the Lord: But he that is married careth for
the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. There is
difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman
careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body
and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the
world, how she please her husband.”<a name="FnAnchor676"

<p>This attitude towards marriage was utterly inconsistent with Jewish
ideas: to marry and to have children were <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page127"></a>127</span> considered matters of fundamental
importance in Israel through all periods of its history. Nor does it
receive much support from the synoptic gospels. Jesus was not himself
married and he is reported to have said that in the resurrection,
there will be neither marriage nor giving in marriage, but that those
who rise will be as the angels in heaven.<a name="FnAnchor677"
href="#Footnote677"><span class="sp">677</span></a> When the
disciples, after hearing Jesus’ saying about divorce, wondered if it
was good for a man to marry, he answered them that “all men cannot
receive this saying, save they to whom it is given,” and that there
are “eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.”<a
name="FnAnchor678" href="#Footnote678"><span class="sp">678</span></a>
Paul writes to the Corinthians: “Concerning virgins I have no
commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment.”<a name="FnAnchor679"
href="#Footnote679"><span class="sp">679</span></a> His view that
celibacy is better than marriage was undoubtedly connected with his
horror of sexuality as the worst sin of the flesh; and for this there
must have been some reason.</p>

<p>There was a small class of Hebrews, the Essenes, who renounced
marriage, and esteemed “continence and the conquest over our passions
to be virtue.”<a name="FnAnchor680" href="#Footnote680"><span
class="sp">680</span></a> We have no evidence that Paul was influenced
by them, but his sexual asceticism, like theirs,<a name="FnAnchor681"
href="#Footnote681"><span class="sp">681</span></a> may have been
rooted in Greek ideas, Pythagorean and others. I wish particularly to
draw attention to the notion that he who performs a sacred act or
enters a holy place must be free from sexual pollution. In Greece
priestesses were not infrequently required to be virgins, if not for
their whole life, at any rate for the duration of their priesthood;<a
name="FnAnchor682" href="#Footnote682"><span class="sp">682</span></a>
and there were eunuch priests connected with the cults of the Ephesian
Artemis,<a name="FnAnchor683" href="#Footnote683"><span
class="sp">683</span></a> the Phrygian Cybele,<a name="FnAnchor684"
href="#Footnote684"><span class="sp">684</span></a> and the Syrian
Astarte.<a name="FnAnchor685" href="#Footnote685"><span
class="sp">685</span></a> Moreover, those who took part in certain
religious festivals were obliged to be continent for some time
previously.<a name="FnAnchor686" href="#Footnote686"><span
class="sp">686</span></a> Paul tells husbands and wives: “Defraud ye
not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may
give yourselves to <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page128"></a>128</span> fasting and prayer.”<a name="FnAnchor687"
href="#Footnote687"><span class="sp">687</span></a> Again, Herodotus
informs us that both the Greeks and the Egyptians “made it a point of
religion to have no converse with women in the sacred places, and not
to enter them without washing, after such converse”;<a
name="FnAnchor688" href="#Footnote688"><span class="sp">688</span></a>
and so far as the latter are concerned this statement is corroborated
by a passage in the ‘Book of the Dead.’<a name="FnAnchor689"
href="#Footnote689"><span class="sp">689</span></a> Before entering
the sanctuary of Mên Tyrannos, whose worship was extended over the
whole of Asia Minor, the worshipper had to abstain from garlic, pork,
and women, and had to wash his head.<a name="FnAnchor690"
href="#Footnote690"><span class="sp">690</span></a> Among the Hebrews,
also, it was a duty incumbent upon all to be free from sexual
defilement before entering the temple.<a name="FnAnchor691"
href="#Footnote691"><span class="sp">691</span></a> Now if, as Paul
said, every believer is “the temple of God,” he too must,
consequently, be free from such defilement.</p>

<p>In order to explain in full the ascetic attitude towards sex, we
have still to consider <em>why</em> sexual intercourse is looked upon as
unclean and defiling. This implies that it is a presumed mysterious
cause of danger. That the danger is supposed to be particularly
alarming in the case of contact between the polluted individual and
anything holy is merely an instance of the general belief that
holiness is exceedingly sensitive to, and readily reacts against,
external influences: indeed it is not only exceptionally susceptible
to influences that are, or are supposed to be, injurious in other
cases as well, but it is even affected or influenced by various acts
or omissions which are otherwise considered perfectly harmless.<a
name="FnAnchor692" href="#Footnote692"><span class="sp">692</span></a>
It should be noticed that the mere discharge of sexual matter, even
when quite involuntary and unaccompanied with any sexual desire, is
held to be polluting both in Leviticus<a name="FnAnchor693"
href="#Footnote693"><span class="sp">693</span></a> and in the
Christian Penitentials.<a name="FnAnchor694" href="#Footnote694"><span
class="sp">694</span></a> It seems that the polluting effect ascribed
to the discharge of such matter is largely due to its mysterious
propensities and the veil of mystery which surrounds the whole sexual
nature of man. There is the secrecy drawn over the sexual functions,
and the feeling of sexual shame,<a name="FnAnchor695"
href="#Footnote695"><span class="sp">695</span></a> which give them
the appearance of something illicit and sinful. But the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page129"></a>129</span> defiling effects
attributed to sexual intercourse are also, no doubt, connected with
the notion that woman is an unclean being. Particularly during
menstruation and childbirth she is supposed to be charged with
mysterious baleful energy, presumably on account of the marvellous
nature of these processes and especially the appearance of blood; and
such regular temporary defilement of a specifically feminine character
may easily lead to the notion of the permanent uncleanness of the
female sex.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VII</h4>
<h3>THEOLOGICAL DOCTRINES BEFORE AUGUSTINE</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="smcap">HROUGHOUT</span> the history of Christianity
the principal subject of interest has been the question of salvation;
but as to the means of procuring it there has been diversity of
opinion. We have first and foremost to notice the antithesis between
works and faith: between the moralistic view that eternal life is the
wages and reward of a moral life, wrought out essentially by our own
power, and the view that eternal life depends entirely on divine
grace, connected with the faith in Christ as our redeemer through his
death on the cross. In other words, there is, broadly speaking, the
contrast between the moral teaching of Jesus as reported in the
synoptic gospels and the Pauline formula of justification by faith
alone.</p>
<p>In the sub-apostolic period both views are represented. The
moralistic mode of thought is very prominent in the ‘Shepherd’ of
Hermas, dating from the first half of the second century,<a
name="FnAnchor696" href="#Footnote696"><span class="sp">696</span></a>
which is an important document for the Church Christianity of the age.
“The true fast,” he says, “is this: do nothing wickedly in thy life,
but serve God with a pure mind, and keep his commandments, and walk
according to his precepts, nor suffer any wicked desire to enter into
thy mind. But trust in the Lord, that if thou dost these things, and
fearest him, and abstainest from evil work, thou shalt live unto
God.”<a name="FnAnchor697" href="#Footnote697"><span
class="sp">697</span></a> “Fear God, and put thy trust in him, and
love truth and righteousness, and do that which is good. If thou shalt
do these things, thou shalt be an approved servant of God. . . . If
thou shalt not observe these commands, but shalt neglect them, thou
shalt not be saved, nor thy children, nor thy house.”<a
name="FnAnchor698" href="#Footnote698"><span class="sp">698</span></a>
“But if besides those things which the Lord hath commanded, thou shalt
add some good thing, thou shalt purchase to thyself a greater dignity,
and be in more favour with the Lord than thou shouldst otherwise have
been.”<a name="FnAnchor699" href="#Footnote699"><span
class="sp">699</span></a> Here we have the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page131"></a>131</span> doctrine of merit in germ. Faith is
repeatedly spoken of.<a name="FnAnchor700" href="#Footnote700"><span
class="sp">700</span></a> By faith “the elect shall be saved . . .
From faith proceeds abstinence, from abstinence simplicity, from
simplicity innocence, from innocence modesty, from modesty discipline
and charity.”<a name="FnAnchor701" href="#Footnote701"><span
class="sp">701</span></a> “Put on faith, and trust in God, and thou
shalt receive all that thou shalt ask. . . . Faith promises all
things, and perfects all things.”<a name="FnAnchor702"
href="#Footnote702"><span class="sp">702</span></a> But this faith is
faith in God, not in Christ. In the extensive writing of Hermas there
is no mention of the death and resurrection of Christ. But the Son of
God laboured very much, and suffered much, that he might blot out the
offences of those whom the Father delivered to him. “For no vineyard
can be digged without much labour and pains. Wherefore having blotted
out the sins of his people, he showed to them the paths of life,
giving them the law which he had received of the Father.”<a

<p>The same paramount importance attached to morality is shown in the
‘Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,’ which is usually cited by its Greek
name as the ‘Didache.’ There also nothing is said about the death and
resurrection of Jesus and the redemption of mankind. Thanks are given
to God for the knowledge of faith and immortality which he has made
known to us through Jesus, his servant,<a name="FnAnchor704"
href="#Footnote704"><span class="sp">704</span></a> who has shown us
the way of life in his teaching. The way of life “is this: first, thou
shalt love the God who made thee; secondly, thy neighbour as thyself;
and all things whatsoever thou wouldst not have befall thee, thou too,
do not to another.”<a name="FnAnchor705" href="#Footnote705"><span
class="sp">705</span></a> Then there is a series of sayings of Jesus,
an enumeration of the commandments of the decalogue, and various other
ethical injunctions.<a name="FnAnchor706" href="#Footnote706"><span
class="sp">706</span></a> Particular emphasis is laid on almsgiving as
a ransom for our sins.<a name="FnAnchor707" href="#Footnote707"><span
class="sp">707</span></a> After this there is a description of the way
of death, which contains all sorts of wickedness and is full of
curse.<a name="FnAnchor708" href="#Footnote708"><span
class="sp">708</span></a> At the end we read the comforting words: “If
thou art able to bear the whole yoke of the Lord, thou shalt be
perfect; but if thou art not able, what thou art able, that do.”<a
name="FnAnchor709" href="#Footnote709"><span class="sp">709</span></a>
The warning is given; “Watch for your life’s sake; let your lamp not
go out, and your loins not be relaxed, but be ready; for ye know not
the hour in which our Lord cometh. . . . In the last days the false
prophets and the corrupters shall be multiplied, and the sheep shall
be turned into wolves, and love shall be turned into hate. . . . Then
all created men shall come into the fire of trial, and many shall be
made to stumble and shall <span class="pagenum"><a

<p>To the moralistic group of writings belongs also the so-called
‘Second Epistle of Clement of Rome,’ which was in fact a sermon
delivered by a presbyter to the Church. He quotes the saying of Jesus:
“Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess
also before my Father which is in heaven,”<a name="FnAnchor711"
href="#Footnote711"><span class="sp">711</span></a> and asks: “Wherein
must we confess him?” His answer is: “In doing those things which he
saith, and not disobeying his commandments&mdash;by worshipping him
not with our lips only, but with all our heart, and with all our
mind.”<a name="FnAnchor712" href="#Footnote712"><span
class="sp">712</span></a> “If we do the will of Christ we shall find
rest; but if not, nothing shall deliver us from eternal punishment if
we shall disobey his commands.”<a name="FnAnchor713"
href="#Footnote713"><span class="sp">713</span></a> “Beautiful,
therefore, is almsgiving, even as repentance from sin. Better is
fasting than prayer, but almsgiving is better than both. Love covereth
a multitude of sins. But prayer out of a good conscience delivereth
from death.”<a name="FnAnchor714" href="#Footnote714"><span
class="sp">714</span></a> “Let us repent. Let us recover ourselves
unto that which is good, for we are full of much madness and evil. Let
us wipe away from us our former sins, and repent with all our hearts,
and be saved.”<a name="FnAnchor715" href="#Footnote715"><span
class="sp">715</span></a> “Blessed are they who obey these ordinances.
Though for a short season they suffer affliction in the world, they
shall gather in the immortal fruit of the resurrection.”<a

<p>In the genuine epistle of Clement, which is of an earlier date,
there is an echo of Paul’s teaching. We “are not justified by
ourselves, neither by our own wisdom, or knowledge, or piety, or the
works which we have done in the holiness of our hearts,” but by faith.
This, however, is “that faith by which God almighty has justified all
men from the beginning,”<a name="FnAnchor717"
href="#Footnote717"><span class="sp">717</span></a> not faith in the
Pauline sense of the word. “We must fix our minds by faith towards
God, and seek those things that are pleasing and acceptable unto
him.”<a name="FnAnchor718" href="#Footnote718"><span
class="sp">718</span></a> “We see how all righteous men have been
adorned with good works; wherefore even the Lord himself, having
adorned himself with his works, rejoiced. Having therefore such an
example, let us without delay fulfil his will, and with all our
strength work the work of righteousness. The good workman with
confidence receives the bread of his labour; but the sluggish and lazy
cannot look him in the face that sets him on work. We must therefore
be ready and forward in well-doing; for from him are all things. <span

“Happy then shall we be, beloved, if we shall have fulfilled the
commandments of God, in the unity of love: that so, through love, our

iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered’” (<i>Psalms</i>

commandments of Christ.<a name="FnAnchor723" href="#Footnote723"><span

protector,”<a name="FnAnchor724" href="#Footnote724"><span

has obtained the grace of repentance for all the world.<a

There shall be a future resurrection of which God has made our Lord
Jesus Christ the first-fruits, raising him from the dead; and some
other guarantees of our own resurrection are also mentioned, among
others that of the wonderful bird phœnix, seen in Arabia.<a
name="FnAnchor726" href="#Footnote726"><span class="sp">726</span></a>
Though Clement occasionally directly refers to Paul there is no
genuine Paulinism in his epistle. “The Roman Christians,” says
Lietzmann, “had not felt the least breath of the Pauline spirit. It is
not an eviscerated Paulinism but a Hellenistic proselyte Christianity
that we meet with here in a pure form, an independent growth from a
root in the early Church, of importance for the future.”<a

<p>The letter bearing the name of James, which was known in Rome at
the end of the first century or shortly after, and was accepted into
the canon of the Western Church in the fourth century,<a
name="FnAnchor728" href="#Footnote728"><span class="sp">728</span></a>
looks like a definite polemic against Paul’s teaching of justification
by faith only, although his name is not mentioned.<a
name="FnAnchor729" href="#Footnote729"><span class="sp">729</span></a>
“What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and
have not works? can faith save him? . . . Faith without works is dead.
Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered
Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his
works, and by works was faith made perfect? . . . By works a man is
justified, and not by faith only. Likewise also was not Rahab the
harlot justified by works, when she had received <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page134"></a>134</span> the messengers, and had
sent them out another way?”<a name="FnAnchor730"
href="#Footnote730"><span class="sp">730</span></a> But unlike Paul,
the author of this epistle means by faith merely belief, or the
acceptance of something as true: “Thou believest that there is one
God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.”<a
name="FnAnchor731" href="#Footnote731"><span class="sp">731</span></a>
There is no reference to the resurrection of Jesus, whose name is
mentioned only twice, and then quite incidentally.<a

<p>An addendum to the series of the Pauline epistles is the Epistle to
the Hebrews, which was quoted already by Clement of Rome<a
name="FnAnchor733" href="#Footnote733"><span class="sp">733</span></a>
and was accepted as canonical by the Eastern Church from early times,
but in the West only since the fourth century.<a name="FnAnchor734"
href="#Footnote734"><span class="sp">734</span></a> The author’s
conception of Jesus and his work is similar to Paul’s, although he
expresses it in his own way. Jesus is the Son of God, by whom he has
made the worlds.<a name="FnAnchor735" href="#Footnote735"><span
class="sp">735</span></a> He became man and equal to us in every
respect: “In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in
things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able
to succour them that are tempted.”<a name="FnAnchor736"
href="#Footnote736"><span class="sp">736</span></a> Being thus the
perfect representative of humanity in the sight of God, he sanctified
us once for all by offering his body,<a name="FnAnchor737"
href="#Footnote737"><span class="sp">737</span></a> and “became the
author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.”<a
name="FnAnchor738" href="#Footnote738"><span class="sp">738</span></a>
“But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever,
sat down on the right hand of God.”<a name="FnAnchor739"
href="#Footnote739"><span class="sp">739</span></a> “If we sin
wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there
remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.”<a name="FnAnchor740"
href="#Footnote740"><span class="sp">740</span></a> Sore punishment
awaits him “who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath
counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an
unholy thing.”<a name="FnAnchor741" href="#Footnote741"><span
class="sp">741</span></a> The writer cites the saying about the
righteous man who lives by faith.<a name="FnAnchor742"
href="#Footnote742"><span class="sp">742</span></a> But faith does not
mean for him personal trust in Christ, as it meant for Paul: “Faith is
the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. .
. . Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things
which do appear. . . . Without faith it is impossible to please him:
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”<a name="FnAnchor743"
href="#Footnote743"><span class="sp">743</span></a> We <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page135"></a>135</span> have Jesus as “the
author and finisher of our faith”;<a name="FnAnchor744"
href="#Footnote744"><span class="sp">744</span></a> but, the writer
also speaks of the faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
Moses, and other saints of the past, “of whom the world was not
worthy.”<a name="FnAnchor745" href="#Footnote745"><span
class="sp">745</span></a> There is some Judaising moralism in the
comforting saying addressed to the readers, that God would not be so
unjust as to forget their work and their loving deeds which they had
done to his honour at an earlier date and were now doing in the
service of the saints.<a name="FnAnchor746" href="#Footnote746"><span

<p>Tertullian attributed this epistle to Barnabas,<a
name="FnAnchor747" href="#Footnote747"><span class="sp">747</span></a>
who is interpreted in Acts as one able to give consolation,<a
name="FnAnchor748" href="#Footnote748"><span class="sp">748</span></a>
but this seems to be a mere guess. There is, however, another writer
current under the name of Barnabas, whom Origen even describes as
“Catholic,” that is canonical.<a name="FnAnchor749"
href="#Footnote749"><span class="sp">749</span></a> The Paulinism of
his epistle is well marked. Faith, love, and hope of that life which
is to come are the characteristics of a Christian;<a
name="FnAnchor750" href="#Footnote750"><span class="sp">750</span></a>
and the assistants of our faith are fear and patience.<a
name="FnAnchor751" href="#Footnote751"><span class="sp">751</span></a>
<span class="correction" title="initial quotation mark

destruction, that through the forgiveness of our sins we might be
sanctified, that is, by the sprinkling of his blood”;<a
name="FnAnchor752" href="#Footnote752"><span class="sp">752</span></a>
and he “shall come to judge both the quick and the dead.”<a
name="FnAnchor753" href="#Footnote753"><span class="sp">753</span></a>
As his kingdom was founded upon the cross, “they that put their trust
in him shall live for ever”;<a name="FnAnchor754"
href="#Footnote754"><span class="sp">754</span></a> whereas “a man

shall nevertheless not refrain himself from the way of darkness.”<a

it is as if it had been said there: “Put your trust in Jesus, who
shall be manifested to you in the flesh.”<a name="FnAnchor756"
href="#Footnote756"><span class="sp">756</span></a> But the Jews were
not worthy to receive the covenant which God had promised to give
them, because they had transgressed his commandments, being deceived
by the evil one.<a name="FnAnchor757" href="#Footnote757"><span
class="sp">757</span></a> There is also a moral strain in this
epistle: “Learning the just commands of the Lord, . . . we should walk
in them. For he who does such things shall be glorified in the kingdom
of God. But he that chooses the other part shall be destroyed together
with his works. For this cause there shall be both a resurrection and
a retribution.”<a name="FnAnchor758" href="#Footnote758"><span

<p>The chief representative of Paulinism among the Apostolic Fathers
is Ignatius, who was bishop of Antioch in the beginning <span

century.<a name="FnAnchor759" href="#Footnote759"><span
class="sp">759</span></a> We have seven letters from his hand, all
written in imitation of the epistles of Paul. Like him, he speaks of
believers both “being found in Christ,” and of “having Christ within
themselves,”<a name="FnAnchor760" href="#Footnote760"><span
class="sp">760</span></a> and exhort them to keep their bodies “as the
temples of God.”<a name="FnAnchor761" href="#Footnote761"><span

the beginning and end of life; for the beginning is faith, the end
charity. And these two, joined together, are of God.”<a

Nothing is to be preferred to them.<a name="FnAnchor763"

for us, that we, by believing in his death, might escape death;<a

and “he was also truly raised from the dead by his Father, after the
manner as he will also raise up us who believe in him, by Jesus
Christ, without whom we have no true life.”<a name="FnAnchor765"
href="#Footnote765"><span class="sp">765</span></a> On the other hand,
if people “believe not in the blood of Christ, it shall be them to
condemnation.”<a name="FnAnchor766" href="#Footnote766"><span
class="sp">766</span></a> He calls faith “the flesh of the Lord” and
charity “the blood of Jesus Christ”: “Renew yourselves in faith, that
is, the flesh of the Lord; and in charity, that is, the blood of Jesus
Christ.”<a name="FnAnchor767" href="#Footnote767"><span

<p>The antitheses of Paul between law and gospel and between wrath and
grace were carried to an extreme by Marcion. He was a native of Sinope
in Pontus, where his father was bishop, but as a grown man he came to
Rome in the reign of Antoninus Pius, and gained influence in the
Church there until sharp oppositions arose. He separated himself from
the Church Catholic and founded his own Church, which spread with such
rapidity that wherever Christians were numerous about the year 160
there were probably Marcionite communities. The work in which he
brought his teaching together has not been preserved, and its contents
can therefore only be deduced from the notices which are found in the
writings of opponents, particularly in Tertullian’s five volumes
against Marcion. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137"></a>137</span>
They have been assembled by Harnack,<a name="FnAnchor771"
href="#Footnote771"><span class="sp">771</span></a> and I shall avail
myself of his collection.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote771"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor771"><sup>771</sup></a></span> A. Harnack, <i>Marcion:
das Evangelium vom fremden Gott</i> (Leipzig, 1921).</p></div>

<p>Contrary to some other writers of the age, Marcion explained the
Old Testament in its literal sense and rejected every allegorical
interpretation. He recognised it as the revelation of the creator of
the world and the god of the Jews, but placed it, just on that
account, in sharpest contrast to the gospel. This god created the
world out of material substance; and he also created Adam weak in body
and soul and then, tolerating the wiles of the devil through the Law,
he brought sin and death upon mankind. His character was stern
justice, and therefore anger, contentiousness, and unmercifulness. He
wished to enforce the carrying out of his commandments by a system of
punishments which rested upon the idea of retaliation: an eye for an
eye, a tooth for a tooth, blood for blood was its principle, and this
made him an unmerciful judge who punished the sins of the fathers on
the children down to the fourth generation. His ideal was
“righteousness,” and therefore he might be called the “righteous
God.”</p>
<p>But there is also another god, the good God of love, who was
absolutely unknown before Christ, but was revealed by him. Men were
also in every respect strange to him; but out of pure goodness and
mercy he espoused their cause, as he could not bear to have them any
longer tormented by their just and yet malevolent god. Rejecting Old
Testament righteousness, Christ preached the gospel of the unknown
God, taught gentleness and patience instead of cruelty and wrath, love
of enemies and forgiveness instead of hate and retribution,
compassionate kindness instead of calculating righteousness. He taught
these things as the will of God and showed them forth in both word and
deed. Then he died on the cross the death accursed by the creator god
(<i>Galatians</i> iii. 13), and thereby paid him the ransom money and
thus redeemed us, “the strangers,” from our previous owners and gained
us for the good God; and not only those of us who were then living or
who should live, but also the dead. For he descended into hell and
liberated all the sinners, the whole multitude of heathen who suffered
in the fiery wrath of the revenging god. The difference between the
two gods had been clearly expounded by Paul, whom Christ had inspired
by a special revelation, lest the gospel of the grace of God should be
lost by falsifications. None of the twelve apostles whom Christ chose
had understood him; they had regarded him erroneously as the Messiah
of the Jewish god. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page138"></a>138</span> Therefore Christ had revealed the truth
once again and had called Paul as its herald, who alone had maintained
it in its purity. Marcion set himself boldly to the task of restoring
the genuine and true gospel which had been known to Paul, by removing
the Judaising interpolations and altering the text. But his gospel had
also been misunderstood, nay his epistles had been falsified in many
passages, in order to make them teach the identity of the god of
creation and the God of redemption. And Marcion attempted to purify
them too from interpolations and restore the genuine Paulinism, which
was just the gospel itself.</p>
<p>Nearly all ecclesiastical writers from Justin to Origen opposed
Marcion. He was said to be the most wicked and shameless of all
heretics, worse than a heathen, a blasphemous emissary of demons, the
first-born of Satan.<a name="FnAnchor772" href="#Footnote772"><span
class="sp">772</span></a> Yet he was too important to be ignored.
Harnack maintains that the duty of accommodating herself to the
Pauline epistles was actually forced upon the Church by Marcion and
some other heretics, and that, but for this constraint, she would
hardly have incorporated them with the canon.<a name="FnAnchor773"
href="#Footnote773"><span class="sp">773</span></a> Whatever else may
be said about Marcion we must give him credit for having perceived
clearly the vital difference between the teaching of Jesus as reported
in the synoptic gospels and the teaching of Paul, as we know it, which
modern theologians have been so apt to slur.</p>

<p>The early Christian Apologists&mdash;Aristides, Justin,
Athenagoras, Tatian, Theophilus, and Minucius Felix&mdash;are earnest
moralists. Man was created free to choose; there is no virtue where
there is no choice, and evil may therefore be necessary for the
production of virtue.<a name="FnAnchor774" href="#Footnote774"><span
class="sp">774</span></a> Justin introduces Jesus with the formula
“the teacher Christ,”<a name="FnAnchor775" href="#Footnote775"><span
class="sp">775</span></a> represents him as the Socrates of the
barbarians, and propounds the theory that this teacher is the
incarnate reason of God.<a name="FnAnchor776"
href="#Footnote776"><span class="sp">776</span></a> The prophets of
the Jews, however, were also inspired by the divine wisdom or Logos;<a
name="FnAnchor777" href="#Footnote777"><span class="sp">777</span></a>
hence the Mosaic law comprehended the unchangeable and fundamental
principles of morality, and those who had lived up to it before the
coming of Christ would be saved by him.<a name="FnAnchor778"
href="#Footnote778"><span class="sp">778</span></a> Man is naturally
endowed with a “sperm of Logos.”<a name="FnAnchor779"
href="#Footnote779"><span class="sp">779</span></a> But a revelation
of the rational was necessary because he had <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page139"></a>139</span> fallen under the sway of demons, and by
the appearance of Christ the very Logos, or Reason itself, took upon
himself a human form and nature to assist man and rescue him from the
power of the demons, and thus enable him to follow his reason and
freedom to do what is good.<a name="FnAnchor780"
href="#Footnote780"><span class="sp">780</span></a> God is “the Father
of righteousness,”<a name="FnAnchor781" href="#Footnote781"><span
class="sp">781</span></a> who rewards goodness and punishes
wickedness. “Every one is stepping forward into everlasting misery or
happiness according to his works.”<a name="FnAnchor782"
href="#Footnote782"><span class="sp">782</span></a> They who walk
according to the will of God, “and demonstrate their worthiness by
their works, we are sure will be admitted into the Divine presence,
there to reign with him, where corruption and suffering never come”;<a
name="FnAnchor783" href="#Footnote783"><span class="sp">783</span></a>
whereas every one according to his demerits shall suffer in eternal
fire.<a name="FnAnchor784" href="#Footnote784"><span
class="sp">784</span></a> But no one can be accountable for any action
of his unless mankind has the power to choose the good and refuse the
evil. “For if it be not so, but all things are determined by fate,
then farewell freedom of will; and if this man is destined to be good,
and that evil, then neither the one nor the other can be justly
approved or condemned.”<a name="FnAnchor785" href="#Footnote785"><span
class="sp">785</span></a> “By maintaining, therefore, that future
events have been foretold by the prophets, we do not maintain that the
things foretold came to pass by any fatal necessity, but from that
divine prescience which foresees all the actions of men, without
necessitating them to act.”<a name="FnAnchor786"
href="#Footnote786"><span class="sp">786</span></a> Only this is
destiny, inevitable destiny, that those who choose to walk in the
paths of virtue shall meet with proportionate returns of honour, and
those who prefer the contrary course shall be punished accordingly,
for God has not made man like trees or beasts, without the power of
election.<a name="FnAnchor787" href="#Footnote787"><span

<p>But although Christ is considered to have accomplished salvation as
a divine teacher and to be a redeemer by helping men to withstand the
power of evil demons, Justin also refers to the cross, saying that the
sinless Christ submitted to his ignominious death in obedience to the
will of his Father, in order that he might rescue them from the
penalty due to their sins,<a name="FnAnchor788"
href="#Footnote788"><span class="sp">788</span></a> and that in order
to secure the benefits from Christ’s death repentance and a
renunciation of our past evil habits are necessary.<a
name="FnAnchor789" href="#Footnote789"><span class="sp">789</span></a>
He also says that men are purified by faith through the blood and
death of Christ,<a name="FnAnchor790" href="#Footnote790"><span
class="sp">790</span></a> and that we are sure to have a life
incorruptible if we ask for it in faith.<a name="FnAnchor791"
href="#Footnote791"><span class="sp">791</span></a> But it has <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page140"></a>140</span> been pointed out that
these are mere words which have nothing at all corresponding to them
in Justin’s general system of thought. To him Christianity is
essentially the belief, founded on the words of Christ, that God
rewards righteousness with eternal life, and punishes wickedness with
eternal punishment.<a name="FnAnchor792" href="#Footnote792"><span

<p>The other Apologists mentioned above did not enter closely into the
significance of Christ. They, also, maintained that true wisdom can be
learnt only by divine revelation, from the prophets and Christ, whose
teaching was identical with or a continuation of theirs.<a
name="FnAnchor793" href="#Footnote793"><span class="sp">793</span></a>
But while Minucius Felix, like the Greek Apologists, perceives the
teachings of the prophets and Christ to be divine truth,<a
name="FnAnchor794" href="#Footnote794"><span class="sp">794</span></a>
he also says that Christian truth chiefly presents itself as the
wisdom implanted by nature in every man,<a name="FnAnchor795"
href="#Footnote795"><span class="sp">795</span></a> and finds
Christian ethics to be the expression of the Stoic.<a
name="FnAnchor796" href="#Footnote796"><span class="sp">796</span></a>
That the moral interest is dominant in all the Apologists is the more
natural on account of the calumnious accusations circulated against
the Christians. Aristides, a philosopher of Athens, portrays
Christianity by portraying Christian morality. The Christians “know
and believe in God, the creator of heaven and earth, by whom all
things consist, . . . and from whom they have received the
commandments which they have written in their hearts, commandments
which they keep in the hope and expectation of the world to come.”<a

<p>Tertullian was the first Apologist after Justin who considered it
necessary to give a detailed account of Christ as the incarnation of
the Logos.<a name="FnAnchor798" href="#Footnote798"><span
class="sp">798</span></a> He repeatedly urges that the whole work of
Christ is comprised in the death on the cross, and indeed that this
death was the aim of his mission;<a name="FnAnchor799"
href="#Footnote799"><span class="sp">799</span></a> we are redeemed by
the blood of the Lord and the Lamb,<a name="FnAnchor800"
href="#Footnote800"><span class="sp">800</span></a> and such is the
efficacy of this blood, that it not only cleanses men from sin and
brings them out of darkness into light, but preserves them also in a
state of purity if they continue to walk in the light.<a
name="FnAnchor801" href="#Footnote801"><span class="sp">801</span></a>
He also speaks of a repentance which is justified by faith,
<i>pœnitentiam ex fide justificatam</i>,<a name="FnAnchor802"
href="#Footnote802"><span class="sp">802</span></a> and of
justification by faith without the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page141"></a>141</span> ordinances of the law.<a
name="FnAnchor803" href="#Footnote803"><span class="sp">803</span></a>
But in Tertullian the mystic doctrine of salvation is rudimentary, and
there are many inconsistencies in his treatment both of dogmatic and
moral questions. In the first place he was a moralist and a legalist,
who looked upon the whole life of the Christian after baptism as
strictly a life under the law, its motives being hope of reward and
fear of punishment and the result determined purely according to legal
standards. He tells us that God keeps a register of our works,<a
name="FnAnchor804" href="#Footnote804"><span class="sp">804</span></a>
that we shall be restored to life to answer for them, whether they be
good or evil.<a name="FnAnchor805" href="#Footnote805"><span
class="sp">805</span></a> All good works are in general meritorious,
but merit in a peculiar sense attaches to such as go beyond the strict
demands of God. Tertullian distinguishes between precepts and
counsels, between <i>jussa</i> and <i>suasa</i>, in consequence of
expressions found in Paul’s first epistle to the Corinthians,<a
name="FnAnchor806" href="#Footnote806"><span class="sp">806</span></a>
a distinction which had previously been made by Hermas.<a
name="FnAnchor807" href="#Footnote807"><span class="sp">807</span></a>
The retribution is strictly according to merit.<a name="FnAnchor808"
href="#Footnote808"><span class="sp">808</span></a> “The worshippers
of God shall be clothed upon with a substance proper for everlasting
duration, and fixed in a perpetual union with God; but the profane and
the hypocrite shall be doomed to a lake of overflowing fire, and
fuelled with incorruptibility from the divine indefectible nature of
that flame which torments them.”<a name="FnAnchor809"
href="#Footnote809"><span class="sp">809</span></a> But Tertullian
also speaks of a kind of purgatory, where, in the interval between
death and the general resurrection, the souls of those who are
destined to eternal happiness undergo a purification from the stains
which even the best men contract during their lives.<a

<p>Of predestination we find no trace in Tertullian’s writings. When
men sin the guilt is strictly and properly their own,<a

for they possess by nature freedom of will.<a name="FnAnchor812"
href="#Footnote812"><span class="sp">812</span></a> “Some argue,” he
says, “that whatever happens, happens by the will of God; for if God
had not willed, it would not have happened. But this is to strike at
the root of all virtue, and to offer an apology for every sin. The
sophistry, moreover, of the argument is not less glaring than its
pernicious tendency. For if nothing happens but what God wills, God
wills the commission of crime; in other words, he wills what he
forbids. . . . Man has also a will, which ought always to coincide
with the will of God, but is often at variance with it.”<a
name="FnAnchor813" href="#Footnote813"><span class="sp">813</span></a>

was by no means so great as the frequency of his citations from him
might suggest.<a name="FnAnchor815" href="#Footnote815"><span

Christ’s real work of salvation consists in his death on the cross,<a

but his moralistic teaching differed from Paul’s. He applied the

and adorn them with works of righteousness.<a name="FnAnchor817"
href="#Footnote817"><span class="sp">817</span></a> Christ is the

direct their freedom of will to obedience to the divine commandment
and thereby strengthening this freedom.<a name="FnAnchor818"

<p>In the Alexandrian school of catechists, which was modelled to some
extent after the manner of the Academy of Plato, Greek philosophy was
made to serve the purpose of Christian apologetics. The goodness of
God and the responsibility of man are the central ideas. According to
Clement of Alexandria, it is the will of God that he who obeys the
commandments and repents his sins should be saved.<a
name="FnAnchor824" href="#Footnote824"><span class="sp">824</span></a>
The law and the gospel are only parts of the same economy, in which
the same God is revealed to mankind: “There is in truth one covenant
of salvation, extending from the foundation of the world to our time,
which, according to the difference of generations and <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page143"></a>143</span> seasons, is supposed to
be given in different forms.”<a name="FnAnchor825"
href="#Footnote825"><span class="sp">825</span></a> Before the coming
of the Lord philosophy was necessary to the Greeks for
justification,<a name="FnAnchor826" href="#Footnote826"><span
class="sp">826</span></a> but it was much later than the philosophy of
the Hebrews, from which it was in fact borrowed.<a name="FnAnchor827"
href="#Footnote827"><span class="sp">827</span></a> Yet the Greek
philosophy, though it possessed the Logos&mdash;the source of all the
true knowledge to which man attains&mdash;is not sufficient for
salvation, which must be obtained through faith in Christ; for that
which was hidden from former generations is now revealed to mankind.<a
name="FnAnchor828" href="#Footnote828"><span class="sp">828</span></a>
“The law was given to the Jews, philosophy to the Greeks, until the
advent of Christ, who was to collect all men, Greeks and barbarians
into one peculiar righteous people through the teaching of faith.”<a
name="FnAnchor829" href="#Footnote829"><span class="sp">829</span></a>
The Son of God is the saviour of all men; “but especially, as the
Apostle says, of those who believe.”<a name="FnAnchor830"

<p>Clement speaks of the redemption of man as effected by the death of
Christ,<a name="FnAnchor831" href="#Footnote831"><span
class="sp">831</span></a> but he really regards Christ as of no
importance to “gnostics”&mdash;who are wise men and not merely simple
believers&mdash;except as a teacher, who “taught the good life, in
order that afterwards as God he might grant everlasting life.”<a
name="FnAnchor832" href="#Footnote832"><span class="sp">832</span></a>
God confers eternal salvation on those who work together with him in
knowledge and good actions; the performance of his commandments being
in our power.<a name="FnAnchor833" href="#Footnote833"><span
class="sp">833</span></a> This freedom of will, however, does not
exclude the operation of divine grace: “by grace we are saved,” but
not without good works.<a name="FnAnchor834" href="#Footnote834"><span
class="sp">834</span></a> Clement also speaks of justification by
faith, referring to the Epistle to the Hebrews, which he ascribes to
Paul.<a name="FnAnchor835" href="#Footnote835"><span
class="sp">835</span></a> He quotes almost all the epistles of Paul,
and yet there is not much of Paul in his teaching. He defines faith as
the rational assent of a soul free to choose,<a name="FnAnchor836"
href="#Footnote836"><span class="sp">836</span></a> and, in another
place, as obedience to the word.<a name="FnAnchor837"
href="#Footnote837"><span class="sp">837</span></a> But knowledge is
superior to faith,<a name="FnAnchor838" href="#Footnote838"><span
class="sp">838</span></a> through knowledge faith is perfected;<a
name="FnAnchor839" href="#Footnote839"><span class="sp">839</span></a>
or the first saving change is from heathenism to faith, the second is
from faith to knowledge, which is perfected in love.<a
name="FnAnchor840" href="#Footnote840"><span class="sp">840</span></a>
If the choice were proposed to the gnostic either to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page144"></a>144</span> know God or to obtain
eternal salvation, he would choose the former. And he does not strive
to attain to the knowledge of God for any consequences which will flow
from the attainment: he does not do good for fame nor for reward.<a
name="FnAnchor841" href="#Footnote841"><span class="sp">841</span></a>
Clement’s strict moralism is also apparent in his sayings that
different degrees of reward will be assigned to different degrees of
virtue,<a name="FnAnchor842" href="#Footnote842"><span
class="sp">842</span></a> and that in inflicting punishment God does
not wish to avenge himself but “has three things in view: to amend the
transgressor, to admonish those who can be saved by example, and to
prevent the injured party from becoming an object of contempt, and
being thereby exposed to future injustice.”<a name="FnAnchor843"
href="#Footnote843"><span class="sp">843</span></a> Sins committed
after baptism are to be purged by public confession and profession of
repentance; and if the purifying discipline does not take place in
this life, it must do so after death, being effected by fire, “not by
a destructive, but a discriminating fire, pervading the soul which
passes through it.”<a name="FnAnchor844" href="#Footnote844"><span

<p>Like Clement his great disciple Origen modified the gospel doctrine
of the state of sinners after death, with its everlasting torments in
the fire of hell. He assumed that the souls of the unpurified ones
pass into a cleansing fire which is only temporary and figurative,
simply consisting in the torments of conscience;<a name="FnAnchor845"
href="#Footnote845"><span class="sp">845</span></a> and that in the
end all the spirits in heaven and earth, nay even the demons, are
purged and brought back to the Logos-Christ.<a name="FnAnchor846"
href="#Footnote846"><span class="sp">846</span></a> But he treated
this doctrine as an esoteric one: “for the common man it is sufficient
to know that the sinner is punished.”<a name="FnAnchor847"
href="#Footnote847"><span class="sp">847</span></a> Origen regarded
the two Testaments as the absolute reliable divine revelation, while
he also recognised revelations of God in Greek philosophy;<a
name="FnAnchor848" href="#Footnote848"><span class="sp">848</span></a>
but he maintained that the Christianity which is fitted for the
comprehension of the multitude is the best doctrine only in a relative
sense, that the “common man” must be reformed by the prospect of
rewards and punishments, and that the truth can be communicated to him
only in veiled forms and images.<a name="FnAnchor849"
href="#Footnote849"><span class="sp">849</span></a> When faith is
elevated to knowledge and clear vision, it is found that God rewards
in justice and punishes in kindness.<a name="FnAnchor850"
href="#Footnote850"><span class="sp">850</span></a> No spirit can be
saved without entering into fellowship with the Logos, who, as also
the Apologists maintained, has been revealing himself from the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page145"></a>145</span> beginning. In the lower
stages this is effected through faith and sure conviction of the
reality of a historical fact; the redeeming death of Christ, but in
the higher stage it is accomplished through knowledge and love, which
grasp the eternal essence of the Logos.<a name="FnAnchor851"
href="#Footnote851"><span class="sp">851</span></a> For this purpose
the wise man requires a perfect, in other words, a divine teacher;
while “to know Christ crucified is the knowledge of babes.”<a

<p>Porphyry says of Origen: “His outward life was that of a Christian
and opposed to the law, but in regard to his views of things and of
the Deity he thought like the Greeks, inasmuch as he introduced their
ideas into the myths of other peoples”;<a name="FnAnchor853"
href="#Footnote853"><span class="sp">853</span></a> and we can
everywhere verify this observation from his works and particularly
from the books written against Celsus. In the East the history of the
Church during the succeeding centuries is the history of Origen’s
philosophy; and among the theologians of ecclesiastical antiquity he
was the most important and influential alongside of Augustine.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VIII</h4>
<h3>LATER THEOLOGICAL DOCTRINES</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">I</span><span class="smcap">N</span> the West Augustine dominated more or
less the history of piety and dogma from the beginning of the fifth
century to the eve of Reformation, and continued to exert his
influence afterwards as well. His own reformation was essentially a
Pauline reaction against the prevailing piety, though a Paulinism
modified by popular Catholic elements.<a name="FnAnchor854"
href="#Footnote854"><span class="sp">854</span></a> Like Paul,
Augustine experienced a sudden conversion, a momentary ecstacy in
which he became absorbed in the love of God, and his mind underwent a
complete change; he had been a slave of lust, as he describes himself,
but was now set free from all propensity to sensual indulgence. The
conversion took place when he was in his thirty-second year. He tells
us in his ‘Confessions’ that in Milan, where he was staying, he
retired into a garden and, greatly agitated, cast himself down under a
fig-tree, and, weeping in most bitter contrition of his heart, prayed
to God to put an end to his uncleanness. Then he heard from a
neighbouring house a voice, “as of a boy or girl,” singing and
repeating the words, “<i>Tolle lege</i>” (“take up and read”).
“Instantly,” he writes, “with a changed countenance, I began to think
most intently, whether boys in any kind of game used to sing such a
phrase; nor could I remember ever to have heard the like. So checking
the torrent of my tears, I arose, interpreting it to no other than a
divine command, to open the book and read the first chapter I should
find. . . . I seized, opened, and in silence read the passage upon
which my eyes first fell: ‘Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in
rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in
strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not
provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof’” (<i>Romans</i>
xiii. 13 <i>sq.</i>). Then his friend Alypius, who was with him,
disclosed to him the following passage, “Him that is weak in the faith
receive” (<i>ibid.</i> xiv. 1).<a name="FnAnchor855"
href="#Footnote855"><span class="sp">855</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote854"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor854"><sup>854</sup></a></span> <i>Cf.</i> H. Reuter,
<i>Augustinische Studien</i> (Gotha, 1887), p. 494

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote855"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor855"><sup>855</sup></a></span> Augustine,
<i>Confessiones</i>, viii. 12.</p></div>

<p>Next to the conversion of Paul, there has been no other conversion
fraught with so far-reaching consequences in the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page147"></a>147</span> history of Christianity
as that of Augustine. In innumerable passages Augustine, like Paul,
extols faith as the element in which the soul lives, as the beginning,
middle, and end of piety. But to him the object of the faith which is
necessary for salvation was the truth guaranteed by the Catholic
Church, which he regarded as infallible in consequence of its
authority as based on apostolicity.<a name="FnAnchor856"
href="#Footnote856"><span class="sp">856</span></a> Augustine had
forced his way through scepticism to the truth of the Church and
looked upon the latter as the rock on which his faith was founded. It
constitutes a real unity with Christ, so that all Catholics are “the
true members of his body”; whereas heretics and schismatics “are cut
off from this body,”<a name="FnAnchor857" href="#Footnote857"><span
class="sp">857</span></a> and consequently cannot be saved. At the
same time, faith is only a preliminary condition of salvation. We must
not fancy that faith by itself protects from future judgment: it is
only the faith that works in love, faith and work, that does so.<a
name="FnAnchor858" href="#Footnote858"><span class="sp">858</span></a>
Faith and hope without love are useless; it is love that decides the
measure of goodness possessed by a man.<a name="FnAnchor859"
href="#Footnote859"><span class="sp">859</span></a> According to
Augustine, faith, love, and merit are successive steps in the way to
final salvation; and this became the view of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>But while the conception of merits, which had been current in the
Church from the days of Tertullian<a name="FnAnchor860"
href="#Footnote860"><span class="sp">860</span></a> and Cyprian<a
name="FnAnchor861" href="#Footnote861"><span class="sp">861</span></a>
was accepted by Augustine, he reconciled this principle&mdash;as also
Ambrose had done<a name="FnAnchor862" href="#Footnote862"><span
class="sp">862</span></a>&mdash;with the doctrine of grace, by
teaching that God crowned his own gifts in crowning our merits.<a
name="FnAnchor863" href="#Footnote863"><span class="sp">863</span></a>
A man is justified not by the merits of his own deeds, but by free
grace. Faith and love and merits are all God’s gifts;<a
name="FnAnchor864" href="#Footnote864"><span class="sp">864</span></a>
and “no one is saved except by undeserved mercy, and no one condemned
except by a deserved judgment.”<a name="FnAnchor865"
href="#Footnote865"><span class="sp">865</span></a> As Paul taught in
his epistle to the Romans, the elect are saved because God, in virtue
of his eternal decree of salvation, has predestinated, chosen, called,
justified, sanctified, and preserved them.<a name="FnAnchor866"
href="#Footnote866"><span class="sp">866</span></a> He would not have
been blamed if he had redeemed no one after Adam’s fall; so neither is
he to be blamed if in his mercy he redeems only a few, that none may
boast of his own merits. God’s will is expressed in the case of the
lost as much as in that of the saved: “in the very deed by which they
opposed his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148"></a>148</span> will,
his will regarding them was done.”<a name="FnAnchor867"
href="#Footnote867"><span class="sp">867</span></a> When Adam, in the
hope of becoming like God, transgressed his command not to eat the
fruit, all conceivable sins were compressed into his sin; and children
are infected not only by Adam’s sin, but also by the sins of their
parents, nay even unbaptised infants will receive damnation.<a
name="FnAnchor868" href="#Footnote868"><span class="sp">868</span></a>
Indeed, their very birth is corrupt, because their parents have
produced them in sinful lust.<a name="FnAnchor869"
href="#Footnote869"><span class="sp">869</span></a> Adam’s fall was
all the more dreadful as it was easy for him to observe God’s command
and refrain from sin. He might have forborne one fruit when there were
so many besides it, and no lust then opposed his will.<a
name="FnAnchor870" href="#Footnote870"><span class="sp">870</span></a>
But the Fall of man was the suicide of his free will, and since then
he is subject to the dreary necessity of being unable to refrain from
sin.<a name="FnAnchor871" href="#Footnote871"><span
class="sp">871</span></a> And even inherited sin is enough for
damnation.</p>

<p>Since all men are by nature children of wrath, and are burdened
both by original sin and their own sins, a mediator was necessary, who
should appease that wrath by presenting a unique sacrifice. That this
was done constitutes the grace of God through Jesus Christ, who was
conceived not by the <i>libido matris</i>, but by faith and therefore
sinlessly.<a name="FnAnchor872" href="#Footnote872"><span

<p>In the future state there will be different degrees both of
felicity<a name="FnAnchor876" href="#Footnote876"><span

the Church does for the dead, is not inconsistent with the sayings of
Paul in his epistle to the Romans (xiv. 10) and in his second epistle
to the Corinthians (v. 10). For those who are wholly good it is a
thanksgiving, for those not altogether bad an atonement, for those

<p>From the moral point of view the relation between the grace of God
and the faith, love, and merit of man in Augustine’s doctrine of
salvation is an absurdity. If the latter are gifts of God, he rewards
man with eternal felicity for what he himself has given him; and if
man’s freedom of will is restricted in such a way as to make him
unable to refrain from sin, he might possibly reject the offer of the
gift, but he certainly deserves no reward for refraining from doing
so.</p>
<p>Augustine’s idea that God has predestinated some persons to
salvation and others to damnation takes us to the problem of free will
and moral responsibility. We have seen that a moral emotion is a
reactionary attitude of mind towards a person conceived as the cause
of a certain mode of conduct, and that a moral judgment is
consequently passed on him as the cause of it. But we impute a
person’s conduct to <em>him</em> only in so far as we consider it to be due,
directly or indirectly, to his will. This is not the case if he acts
under compulsion. In such circumstances even ordinary anger tends to
cease; as Seneca said, “Who but an unjust person can be angry with
what is done under compulsion?”<a name="FnAnchor881"
href="#Footnote881"><span class="sp">881</span></a> When a man’s whole
conduct is determined by an external power ruling over human affairs,
a god or an all-powerful fate, he can obviously not be held
responsible for what he does under the influence of such constraint;
the logical outcome of radical fatalism is a denial of all moral
imputability and a rejection of all moral judgment. The same has been
said to apply to determinism. Determinism has been confounded with
fatalism, causation confounded with compulsion, the cause which
determines the will being looked upon in the light of a constraining
power outside the will. This <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page150"></a>150</span> is an obvious mistake. While fatalism
presupposes the existence of a person who is constrained by an outward
power, determinism regards the person himself as in every respect a
product of causes. It does not assume any part of his will to have
existed previous to his formation by these causes; his will cannot
possibly be constrained by them because there is nothing to constrain,
it is made by them. When we say of a person that he is influenced by
external circumstances or subdued by fate, we regard <em>him</em> as
existing independently of that which influences or subdues him, we
attribute to him a will, or character, which is acted upon from the
outside. He would have been different if he had lived under different
conditions of life, or if fate had left him alone. But how could we
say that he would have been different if he had been the offspring of
different parents? <em>He</em> would not have existed at all. This is
the pivot of the whole question. A moral emotion and a moral judgment
presuppose the existence of a certain individual with an innate
character, it is towards him that the emotion is felt, on him that the
judgment is passed; beyond that they cannot go. In the very strictest
sense of the term, the proper subject of moral judgment is the innate
character,<a name="FnAnchor882" href="#Footnote882"><span
class="sp">882</span></a> and any succeeding change a person’s
character undergoes is imputable to <em>him</em> only in so far as it is
caused by the character with which he was born. The moral
consciousness should, so far as possible, consider the influences to
which his innate character has been subjected from the outside world,
but it cannot consider the causes from which it sprang. To do so would
be foreign to its very nature. The moral emotions are no more
concerned with the origin of the innate character than the æsthetic
emotions are concerned with the origin of the beautiful object: when
we enjoy the music of a violin, we do not consider that it is produced
by the rubbing of hairs from a horse-tail against the dried intestines
of sheep. In their capacity of retributive emotions, they are
essentially directed towards sensitive and volitional entities
conceived, not as uncaused themselves, but only as causes of pleasure
or pain.</p>

<p>Nor can Augustine’s conception of original sin satisfy even the
most elementary moral claims. His opinion of the enormity of Adam’s
sin shocked even a schoolman like Duns Scotus, who argued that the act
to which he allowed himself to be led was not in its nature an immoral
act, but only transgression of a command imposed for the purpose of
testing, and that Adam accordingly sinned only indirectly against the
command to love God, while at the same time he transgressed the law of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151"></a>151</span> neighbourly love
by overpassing, through his pliancy, the proper limit. His sin did not
arise from uncontrolled self-love, but had its root in uncontrolled
love for the partner associated with him, which, however, was not
libidinous, since in the primitive state there was no <i>libido</i>.<a
name="FnAnchor883" href="#Footnote883"><span class="sp">883</span></a>
The punishment for his offence was also enormous, and unjust beyond
all bounds; it consisted not only in his own death but in the death of
all other men, his descendants, who were supposed to be infected with
his sin. And at the same time they had also, for no fault of theirs,
to pay for the sin contracted by their parents producing them in
sinful lust.</p>

Duns Scotus</i> (Wien, 1881), p. 412.</p></div>

<p>It would seem that from the Augustinian point of view the salvation
of man might have been accomplished simply by the grace of God,
without the assistance of the death of Christ; but Paul had written
that “Christ died for all,” and this had to be explained. Augustine,
however, had no new explanation to offer. Origen, though considering
that the crucified Christ was of no account for the gnostic, was the
first to set up the theory that the devil had acquired a legal claim
on men, and therefore to regard the death of Christ (or his soul) as a
ransom paid to the devil. He associated this view with the notion of a
deception practised on the devil. By his successful temptation the
devil acquired such a right, and this right could not be destroyed,
but only bought off. God offered the devil Christ’s soul in exchange
for the souls of men. But this proposal of exchange was insincere, as
God knew that the devil could not keep hold of Christ’s soul, because
a sinless soul could not but cause him torture. The devil agreed to
the bargain and was duped; hence Christ did not fall into the power of
death and the devil, but overcame both.<a name="FnAnchor884"
href="#Footnote884"><span class="sp">884</span></a> This theory was
widely accepted, by Augustine and Gregory the Great amongst others.
The latter gives it in a very drastic form: the humanity of Christ was
the bait, the fish&mdash;that is the devil&mdash;snapped at it, and
was left hanging on the invisible hook, Christ’s divinity.<a
name="FnAnchor885" href="#Footnote885"><span class="sp">885</span></a>
But in Augustine we also find echoes of another thought, namely that
God must be propitiated. This view, too, had been expressed by Origen,
who was the first to introduce into the Church a theology of sacrifice
or propitiation based on the death of Christ.<a name="FnAnchor886"

<p>While Augustine insisted on the eternal duration of the pains of
hell, he moralised somewhat this doctrine by admitting <span

damnation. The notion of different degrees of damnation and
blessedness did not originate in him, but seems to have been very
common even before his days.<a name="FnAnchor887"
href="#Footnote887"><span class="sp">887</span></a> Nor was his

<p>Augustinianism was accepted by the Western Church, though “with the
secret reservation that it was to be moulded by its own mode of
thought,” when it did not harmonise with the tendencies of the Church.
Its greatest and most influential champion was Thomas Aquinas,
particularly with regard to its doctrines of God, predestination, sin,
and grace. The turning from Realism to Nominalism was an
anti-Augustinian movement, but in the fourteenth century Bradwardine,
on whom Wyclif was dependent as a theologian, gave the impulse to
Augustinian reactions which accompanied the history of the Church till
the time of Staupnitz and Luther, and prepared the way for the
Reformation. It has been said that the work of Augustine was finally
brought to completion by Luther, since Augustine, by going back to
Paulinism, began the work of breaking down and re-casting the ruling
dogmatic tradition and of restoring theology to faith. In Roman
Catholicism the Augustinian reaction of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries partly embodied itself in the decrees of Trent, but was
fully checked again, after a struggle for three hundred years, in the
nineteenth century.<a name="FnAnchor891" href="#Footnote891"><span
class="sp">891</span></a></p>

pp. 169, 170, 275.</p></div>

<p>Augustine’s doctrine that faith in the truth guaranteed by the
Catholic Church is necessary for salvation, was universally accepted
by the Church. It was admitted that a certain belief or “unbelief”
never is by itself a sufficient ground for damnation; but Thomas
Aquinas points out that there is yet a sin of unbelief consisting in
“contrary opposition to the faith, whereby one stands out against the
hearing of the faith, or even despises faith,” and that, though such
unbelief is in the intellect, the cause of it is in the will. He adds
that in those who have heard nothing of the faith, unbelief has not
the character of a sin, “but rather of a penalty, inasmuch as such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page153"></a>153</span> ignorance of
divine things is a consequence of the sin of our first parent.”<a
name="FnAnchor892" href="#Footnote892"><span class="sp">892</span></a>

<p>In spite of Thomas’ adherence to Augustinianism we find in him a
timid revision of it in a moralistic direction. He makes an earnest
endeavour to assert the sole efficacy of divine grace, but his line of
statement takes ultimately a different direction. Although “without
grace man cannot merit eternal life,”<a name="FnAnchor894"
href="#Footnote894"><span class="sp">894</span></a> there must for
justification co-operate a movement of free will, a movement of faith,
and a hatred of sin<a name="FnAnchor895" href="#Footnote895"><span
class="sp">895</span></a>&mdash;in other words there is an
intermingling of grace and self-action; and only then justification
takes place.<a name="FnAnchor896" href="#Footnote896"><span
class="sp">896</span></a> Man cannot acquire merit before God in the
absolute sense of strict righteousness, but certainly in virtue of a
benevolent arrangement of God. “Meritorious work of man can be looked
at in two ways: on the one hand in so far as it proceeds from free
will, on the other hand in so far as it proceeds from the grace of the
Holy Spirit.”<a name="FnAnchor897" href="#Footnote897"><span
class="sp">897</span></a> Thus, according to Thomas, the process of
grace realises itself with the consent of free will, but this consent
is at the same time an effect of grace. Other theologians, such as
Halesius, Bonaventura, and Scotus, yielded to a much more decided
tendency to render the doctrine of grace less effectual by means of
the doctrine of merit; and from the middle of the fourteenth century
their views gained the ascendancy in the Church through the victorious
conflicts of the Scotists against the Thomists.<a name="FnAnchor898"
href="#Footnote898"><span class="sp">898</span></a> According to
Scotus, merit always precedes grace.<a name="FnAnchor899"
href="#Footnote899"><span class="sp">899</span></a> The Council of
Trent declared that “while God touches the heart of man by the
illumination of the Holy Ghost, neither is man himself utterly without
doing anything while he receives that inspiration, forasmuch as he is
also able to reject it, yet is he not able, by his own free will,
without the grace of God, to move himself unto justice in His
sight.”<a name="FnAnchor900" href="#Footnote900"><span

<p>As to the election of grace, Thomas took over Augustine’s doctrine
of predestination in all its strictness: in virtue of his decree God
determines some to be elected and others to be reprobated.<a
name="FnAnchor901" href="#Footnote901"><span class="sp">901</span></a>
Bonaventura, on the other hand, makes predestination dependent on
prescience and limits the causation of God by teaching that another

<p>It was not easy for Thomas to construe the doctrine of free will,
since in the doctrine of God he had applied throughout the thought of
sole divine causality, even the consent of man’s will being conceived
as an effect of divine grace. But he wants free will in order to
strengthen the Augustinian concept of merit. His doctrine of grace
culminates in the “evangelical counsels.” He points out, as others had
done before him, that there are both precepts and counsels. A precept
is compulsory, whereas a counsel is dependent on the option of him to
whom it is given. Precepts are necessary to, and also sufficient for,
eternal life, “but there ought to be counsels regarding those things
by which man can attain the appointed end better and more readily.”
They consist in relinquishing entirely, so far as it is possible, the
benefits of this world, such as the possession of outward goods,
sexual pleasures, and the possession of honours; and the adoption of
even one of these counsels has a corresponding worth, <i>e.g.</i> when
one gives alms to a poor man beyond what is obligatory, abstains from
marriage for a long time for the sake of prayer, or does good to his
enemies in excess of what is due, and so forth. The following of these
counsels is a ground of merit in a still higher degree than the
following of the commands, so that here in a pre-eminent way it holds
good, that God gives eternal life to man, not merely in grace, but
also by virtue of divine righteousness.<a name="FnAnchor905"
href="#Footnote905"><span class="sp">905</span></a> All merit, so far
as it proceeds from the free will is <i>de congruo</i>, and so far as
it proceeds from grace <i>de condigno</i>.<a name="FnAnchor906"
href="#Footnote906"><span class="sp">906</span></a> The doctrine that
eternal salvation must be merited by good works is common to all the
mediæval schoolmen, and the Council of Trent stamped it with its
approval. It decreed that “to those who perform good works on to the
end, and who hope in God, there is to be offered eternal life, both as

itself.”<a name="FnAnchor908" href="#Footnote908"><span

<p>The distinction between command and counsel, between a higher and a
lower Christian life, is in agreement with Paul’s saying that the
virgin state is superior to the married, but that he who marries has
not sinned.<a name="FnAnchor909" href="#Footnote909"><span
class="sp">909</span></a> A similar distinction meets us in many later
writers, such as Hermas,<a name="FnAnchor910"

name="FnAnchor911" href="#Footnote911"><span class="sp">911</span></a>

Augustine.<a name="FnAnchor915" href="#Footnote915"><span
class="sp">915</span></a> It has certainly a solid foundation in our
moral consciousness, in so far that a command implies the concept of
duty, which is based on the emotion of moral disapproval, and a
counsel implies the concept of goodness, which derives its origin from
the emotion of moral approval.<a name="FnAnchor916"
href="#Footnote916"><span class="sp">916</span></a> But at the same
time goodness and meritoriousness, the latter of which lays claim to
praiseworthiness, are not identical with the superobligatory. Although
the concept of duty has nothing to do with praise, we may nevertheless
praise a person for doing his duty and even consider him worthy of
praise. Practically, no doubt, there is a general antagonism between
duty and merit. We praise, and especially we regard as deserving
praise, only what is above the average, and we censure what is below
it. But although thus most acts that are deemed meritorious fall
outside the ordinary limits of duty as roughly drawn by the popular
mind, we are, on the other hand, often disposed to attribute merit to
a man on account of an act which from a strict point of view is his
duty, but a duty that most people in the same circumstances would have
left undischarged. This shows that the antagonism between duty and
merit is not absolute. And in the concept of merit <i>per se</i> no
such antagonism is involved.</p>

<p>But while “meritorious” is not identical with “superobligatory,” it
is obvious that if a course of conduct which is not regarded as a duty
is held to be meritorious, it is <i>eo ipso</i> <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page156"></a>156</span> admitted that a man can
do more than his duty. This is denied both by those who derive
goodness from duty and consider that what is good is what ought to be
done, and by those who derive duty from goodness and consider that
everybody ought to do the best he is able to do. Duty, which is the
minimum of morality, in so far that it implies that the opposite mode
of conduct is wrong, is identified with the supreme moral ideal, which
requires the best possible conduct for its realisation. This rigorism
is not supported by our practical moral judgments, but is a mere
theory, which may be traced either to the direct or indirect influence
of Protestant theology with its denial of all works of supererogation,
or to the endeavour of normative moralists to preach the most elevated
kind of morality they can conceive. For my own part I do not see how
such a doctrine could serve any useful purpose at all. The recognition
of a “superobligatory” does not lower the moral ideal, but on the
contrary tends to raise it; and at the same time it makes it more
possible to vindicate the moral law and administer it more strictly.
It is nowadays a recognised principle in legislation that a law loses
much of its weight if it cannot be enforced. If the realisation of the
highest moral ideal is commanded by a moral law, such a law will
always remain a dead letter, and morality will gain nothing. It seems
to me that far above the anxious effort to fulfil the commandments of
duty stands the free and lofty aspiration to live up to an ideal,
which, unattainable as it may be, threatens neither with blame nor
remorse him who fails to reach its summits. Does not experience show
that those whose minds are constantly prepossessed with thoughts of
duty are apt to become inhuman, intolerant, indeed intolerable?</p>
<p>At the same time there are in the Roman Catholic doctrine of merit
certain very objectionable features. It implies that a good deed
stands in the same relation to a bad deed as a claim to a debt; that
the claim is made on the same person to whom the debt is due, that is
God, even though it only be by his mercy; and that the debt
consequently may be compensated for in the same way as the infliction
of a loss or damage may be compensated for by the payment of an
indemnity. This doctrine of reparation comes inevitably to attach
badness and goodness to external acts rather than to mental facts. No
reparation can be given for badness. It can only be forgiven, and
moral forgiveness can be granted only on condition that the agent’s
mind has undergone a radical alteration for the better, that the
badness of the will has given way to repentance. This point was
certainly not overlooked by the Catholic moralists, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page157"></a>157</span> but even the most
ardent apology cannot explain away the idea of reparation in the
Catholic doctrine of the justification of man.<a name="FnAnchor917"
href="#Footnote917"><span class="sp">917</span></a> Penance consists
of contrition, confession, and satisfaction, and contrition itself is
chiefly “a willingness to compensate.”<a name="FnAnchor918"
href="#Footnote918"><span class="sp">918</span></a> Moreover,
vicarious efficacy is attributed to good deeds. It is said that Christ
has done more by his suffering than was required for redemption, and
that even many saints have acquired for themselves merit which God’s
grace rewards. This surplus merit, or “treasury of supererogatory
works,” must necessarily fall to the benefit of the Church, since
neither Christ nor the saints can derive further advantage from it.
The theory of a treasury of merits which the Church administers and
from which indemnifications can be derived for the sins of others was
first adopted by Halesius,<a name="FnAnchor919"
href="#Footnote919"><span class="sp">919</span></a> but owes its
recognition within the Catholic Church chiefly to Thomas Aquinas.<a
name="FnAnchor920" href="#Footnote920"><span class="sp">920</span></a>
It has been argued that, since we are all regenerated unto Christ by
being washed in the same baptism, made partakers of the same
sacraments, and especially of the same meat and drink, the body and
blood of Christ, we are all members of the same body. “As, then, the
foot does not perform its functions solely for itself, but also for
the benefit of the eyes; and as the eyes exercise their sight, not for
their own, but for the common benefit of all the members; so should
works of satisfaction be deemed common to all the members of the
Church.”<a name="FnAnchor921" href="#Footnote921"><span

<p>Augustine’s doctrine of original sin was modified to some extent by
Thomas. The sin which originated with Adam was loss of natural
goodness, and accordingly led to rebellion of the lower parts of man
against the higher, but the natural capacity to know and to will the
good was only weakened, not eradicated; that sin could remove it is
unthinkable.<a name="FnAnchor922" href="#Footnote922"><span
class="sp">922</span></a> He thus emphasised the negative side of sin
more strongly than Augustine. Yet he taught a stricter doctrine than
Anselm, who really only accentuated the negative side, and began to
waver even in regard to the character of guilt; he rejected the
damnation of infants.<a name="FnAnchor923" href="#Footnote923"><span
class="sp">923</span></a> To him Duns Scotus attached himself. He
separated the question about concupiscence, which is natural, from the
question about original sin; and there remains for it merely the being
deprived of the supernatural good, which <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page158"></a>158</span> certainly has a disturbing effect upon the
nature of man, while however nothing is really lost of the natural
goodness. The guilt of inherited sin, which is considerably reduced
even in Thomas, appears in Duns quite insignificant. Even the
consequences of sin are presented by him in another light: it has not
attacked the very nature of man.<a name="FnAnchor924"
href="#Footnote924"><span class="sp">924</span></a> Scholasticism
ultimately lost sight entirely of the Augustinian starting-point.<a
name="FnAnchor925" href="#Footnote925"><span class="sp">925</span></a>
In its decree on original sin the Council of Trent rejects in strong
terms Pelagianism, which denies that sin can be inherited, but the
positive propositions are so shrewdly constructed that it is always
<em>possible</em> still to connect with them a meaning that widely
diverges from that of Augustine.<a name="FnAnchor926"

<p>Augustine’s answer to the question how Christ’s suffering and death
can be a means of justification, namely, that it is a ransom paid to
the devil, who has acquired a legal claim on men&mdash;a theory which
had previously been set forth by Origen&mdash;was accepted by the most
important of the Western Fathers. This, however, did not exclude the
other thought that Christ’s suffering and death constituted a
sacrifice presented by him to God in order to propitiate him. But
rival explanations were also suggested. Among these Anselm’s theory in
his <i>Cur Deus homo</i> deserves special consideration because it has
given the impulse to permanent treatment of the subject and is still
regarded in our own day and by evangelical theologians, too, as
essentially a model; both Luther and Calvin took over many of its
presuppositions, and quite recently Principal Denney described <i>Cur
Deus homo</i> as “the truest and greatest book on the Atonement that
has ever been written.”<a name="FnAnchor927" href="#Footnote927"><span
class="sp">927</span></a> It is an attempt to prove both the necessity
of the appearing of the God-man and the necessity of his death. Anselm
denies that the devil had obtained any claim upon us, since over
against God he has absolutely no right.<a name="FnAnchor928"
href="#Footnote928"><span class="sp">928</span></a> Every rational
creature owes to God entire subjection to his will. This is the only
honour that God demands, and he who does not pay it dishonours God by
withholding from him his own. This robbery he cannot tolerate, he must
defend his honour; hence every sinner must furnish a satisfaction.<a
name="FnAnchor929" href="#Footnote929"><span class="sp">929</span></a>
But what can man give God which he was not already required to give
him in any case? He has nothing that he can render back for his sin,<a
name="FnAnchor930" href="#Footnote930"><span class="sp">930</span></a>
and how much he would <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page159"></a>159</span> have to do! Even the smallest disobedience
entails an infinite guilt,<a name="FnAnchor931"
href="#Footnote931"><span class="sp">931</span></a> and man has
therefore to furnish an infinitely great satisfaction.<a
name="FnAnchor932" href="#Footnote932"><span class="sp">932</span></a>
The incapacity of human nature to furnish such satisfaction can make
no change on this law, which follows from the honour of God.<a
name="FnAnchor933" href="#Footnote933"><span class="sp">933</span></a>
So there remains only one solution: there must be some one who shall
pay to God for the sin of man something greater than all that is apart
from God, but since there is nothing above all that is not God save
God, no one is able to make this satisfaction save God. Again, it
cannot be made by anybody save man; consequently, it is necessary that
the God-man shall make it.<a name="FnAnchor934"
href="#Footnote934"><span class="sp">934</span></a> If the God-man
surrenders his life voluntarily to God, the satisfaction sought for is
obtained; it must be his life, because only this he is not under
obligation to offer to God.<a name="FnAnchor935"
href="#Footnote935"><span class="sp">935</span></a> The worth of such
a life as a satisfaction is infinite; the acceptance of the death of
such a God-man is an infinite good for God which far surpasses the
loss by sin.<a name="FnAnchor936" href="#Footnote936"><span
class="sp">936</span></a> The God-man acts for himself, by no means as
the representative of mankind; and the Father must recompense him for
that.<a name="FnAnchor937" href="#Footnote937"><span
class="sp">937</span></a> Though nothing can be given to the Son,
since he has all, it would be outrageous to assume that the whole
action of the Son should remain without effect. Hence it is necessary
that it should be for the advantage of another, and if this is willed
by the son the Father cannot object, otherwise he would be unjust.
“But to whom more fittingly shall he impart the fruit and recompense
of his death than to those for whose salvation, as true reason has
taught us, he made himself man, and to whom, as we have said, he gave
in dying the example of dying for righteousness’ sake? In vain surely
shall they be imitators of him, if they are not to be partakers of his
merit. Or whom shall he more justly make heirs of that which is due to
him, but which he does not need, . . . than his own parents and
brethren, whom he looks on, burdened in their poverty with so many and
so great debts, and languishing in the depths of misery, that what
they owe for their sin may be remitted to them, and what, by reason of
their sin, they lack, may be given to them?”<a name="FnAnchor938"
href="#Footnote938"><span class="sp">938</span></a> Anselm’s theory
does not guarantee to the individual that he really becomes saved; it
aims rather at only showing for all the possibility of their being
saved. Whether they shall be so depends “on the measure in which men
come to partake of so great grace, and on the degree in which they
live under it,” that is, on how they fulfil the commandments of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page160"></a>160</span> holy scripture.<a
name="FnAnchor939" href="#Footnote939"><span class="sp">939</span></a>
This statement introduces a moral element into the theory, which it
otherwise lacks. It is true that the suffering of Christ is not
regarded as a vicarious punishment: Anselm did not say, like
Athanasius, that justice was satisfied by his taking upon himself the
punishment to be inflicted for our sins.<a name="FnAnchor940"
href="#Footnote940"><span class="sp">940</span></a> But at the same
time the benefit he provided was to make us “partakers of his
merit.”</p>

<p>The meritoriousness of the work of Christ rapidly came to the
front. It was strongly emphasised by the Lombard and Thomas Aquinas,
both of whom combined various points of view which had been furnished
by earlier theologians. By his passion, says Thomas, Christ merited
<i>exaltatio</i>,<a name="FnAnchor941" href="#Footnote941"><span
class="sp">941</span></a> but as the exaltation could not be conferred
upon him it passed over to the Church of which he is the head, “the
head and the members are, as it were, one mystical person, and thus
the satisfaction of Christ belongs to all believers just as to his own
members.”<a name="FnAnchor942" href="#Footnote942"><span
class="sp">942</span></a> Both Thomas and the Lombard are in agreement
with Abelard’s view that the death of Christ is a proof of love, which
awakens counter-love.<a name="FnAnchor943" href="#Footnote943"><span
class="sp">943</span></a> The Lombard writes: “So great a pledge of
love having been given to us, we are both moved and kindled to love
God who did such great things for us; and by this we are justified,
that is, being loosed from our sins we are made just. The death of
Christ therefore justifies us, inasmuch as through it charity is
stirred up in our hearts.”<a name="FnAnchor944"
href="#Footnote944"><span class="sp">944</span></a> Duns Scotus,
again, and his school abandoned the principle of strict equivalence,
which was fundamental to Anselm, in favour of a theory which makes the
efficacy of the atonement depend upon the gracious acceptance of God
rather than upon its own inherent merit constituting it an exact
equivalent for the punishment deserved by man.<a name="FnAnchor945"
href="#Footnote945"><span class="sp">945</span></a> Neither Catholics
nor Protestants, however, have maintained that the self-sacrifice of
Christ acts automatically as a means of salvation. To the Catholic
theologian the atonement only forms the basis of the whole system of
ecclesiastical machinery upon which man’s salvation is supposed to
depend. To the Protestant it is his warrant for rejecting this
machinery as superfluous. Through the atonement of Christ the price of
man’s redemption has been paid once for all, but he can appropriate
its benefits only through faith.<a name="FnAnchor946"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page161"></a>161</span> That the
suffering and death of Christ was a propitiatory substitutionary
sacrifice, or a penalty of guilt in the interests of God, has
undoubtedly remained the most popular view. In Anglican Article II. it
is said that the Son of God “suffered, was crucified, dead and buried,
to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for
original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.” A recent writer
asserts that the teaching of the New Testament is faithfully expressed
in the popular hymn:</p>
  <div class="center small"><div class="poem">
<p class="nob noind">
Bearing shame and scoffing rude,&nbsp;<br />In my place condemned He
stood;<br />Sealed my pardon with His blood:<br />Hallelujah! what a
Saviour.<a name="FnAnchor947" href="#Footnote947"><span
class="sp">947</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>
<p class="noind">Yet there is an increasing number of disbelievers even within the
Church. An English theologian asks if the theory that Jesus, by his
propitiatory sacrifice and by his resurrection, has restored to
mankind what had been lost by the Fall can be held to-day by people of
education; and he adds, “It is doubtful even if those who profess to
believe in propitiatory sacrifice really do believe in it; and how
rapidly they are diminishing in numbers.”<a name="FnAnchor948"
href="#Footnote948"><span class="sp">948</span></a> The bishop of
Birmingham writes that “in some way or another the fact of the
atonement must be preserved,” but that “we can no longer maintain the
Evangelical tradition which uses for the atonement a substitutionary
theory of the death of Christ”;<a name="FnAnchor949"
href="#Footnote949"><span class="sp">949</span></a> yet he does not
tell us what other explanation should take its place. In the last
century a Swedish bishop, the famous poet Esaias Tegnér, called the
doctrine of a blood-atonement “a butcher’s idea, blasphemous against
both God and reason.”<a name="FnAnchor950" href="#Footnote950"><span
class="sp">950</span></a> While the older Evangelicals hold a
particularly crude doctrine of the atonement, the liberal modern ones,
though they have retained a full recognition of Christ’s work of
redemption, have deliberately discouraged attempts to inquire too
closely into the manner in which it was accomplished.<a
name="FnAnchor951" href="#Footnote951"><span class="sp">951</span></a>
The authorities of the Church of England even declared in their Report
(in spite of Article II.) that “the Church as a whole has never
formally accepted any particular explanation of the fact.”<a
name="FnAnchor952" href="#Footnote952"><span class="sp">952</span></a>
It has been argued that there never <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page162"></a>162</span> can be a single theory of the atonement,
since “God’s plan of salvation is too vast to be embraced in any one
single explanation.”<a name="FnAnchor953" href="#Footnote953"><span
class="sp">953</span></a> But though none of the many theories of the
atonement is held finally satisfactory, there is said to be neither
doubt nor difficulty about the fact itself, the saving power of the
cross of Christ being a matter of common Christian experience.<a
name="FnAnchor954" href="#Footnote954"><span class="sp">954</span></a>
It is alleged that we “perceive” the effect of the cross,<a
name="FnAnchor955" href="#Footnote955"><span class="sp">955</span></a>
and that what took place at Calvary “can be apprehended only by
faith.”<a name="FnAnchor956" href="#Footnote956"><span
class="sp">956</span></a> But faith is no testimony. Dr. Murray
maintains that “Our Lord’s own words . . . leave no doubt that with
clear consciousness and deliberate intent in accordance with the
prophetic anticipation (Isaiah liii. 10&mdash;12),<a
name="FnAnchor957" href="#Footnote957"><span class="sp">957</span></a>
He accepted the position as victim on behalf of His people with the
institution of the sin-offering prefigured.”<a name="FnAnchor958"
href="#Footnote958"><span class="sp">958</span></a> But modern
scholars have denied that Jesus ever spoke such words;<a
name="FnAnchor959" href="#Footnote959"><span class="sp">959</span></a>
and even Mr. Thornton, who attaches much importance to Old Testament
Servant-prophecies as a basis for the theology of the atonement, does
not seem quite convinced that they are mistaken. He writes, however,
that “even if our Lord never spoke such words as those in Mark x. 45,
there still remains the possibility that His life and teaching as a
whole, crowned by the death and resurrection, are most fitly
interpreted in the light of the Servant passages.”<a
name="FnAnchor960" href="#Footnote960"><span class="sp">960</span></a>
But according to the Hebrew text Israel was smitten for its own
iniquities, not for the iniquities of other peoples; and, as Dujardin
remarks, the idea of Israel atoning for the sins of the world was
impossible before the Christian era.<a name="FnAnchor961"
href="#Footnote961"><span class="sp">961</span></a> Dean Rashdall
maintains that “the only doctrine of the atonement which can with any
certainty, or even with any probability, be traced back to our Lord
himself is the simple doctrine that his death, like his life, was one
of self-sacrifice for his followers.”<a name="FnAnchor962"

<p>From the moral point of view the doctrines of salvation <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page163"></a>163</span> through the suffering
and death of Jesus and the various explanations given of it make a
distressing chapter in the history of Christian dogma. All of them
imply the idea of vicarious merit or of vicarious punishment or of
both. Yet moral justification is claimed for them. In the Report of
the Archbishops’ Commission we are told that “the Cross is a
satisfaction for sin so far as the moral order of the universe makes
it impossible that human souls should be redeemed from sin except at a
cost. . . . The redeeming love of God, through the life of Jesus
Christ sacrificially offered in death upon the Cross, acted with
cleansing power upon a sin-stained world, and so enables us to be
cleansed.”<a name="FnAnchor963" href="#Footnote963"><span
class="sp">963</span></a> So also Harnack refers to the demand that
sin must be expiated by suffering, and to the conviction that the
expiation may be effected by the suffering of a righteous person. “No
reflection of the ‘reason,’ no deliberation of the ‘intelligence,’” he
says, “will ever be able to expunge from the moral ideas of mankind
the conviction that injustice and sin deserve to be punished, and that
everywhere that the just man suffers, an atonement is made which puts
us to shame and purifies us. It is a conviction which is
impenetrable.”<a name="FnAnchor964" href="#Footnote964"><span
class="sp">964</span></a> An idea of this kind is found among
children. M. Piaget has shown that they accept the equity of
collective punishment if the guilty one is unknown, not in the least
because the group is responsible as a whole for the fault of one of
its members, but simply because there must be punishment at all
costs.<a name="FnAnchor965" href="#Footnote965"><span

<p>To me it seems that even the slightest degree of reflection should
show how incompatible the infliction of punishment on an innocent
person in place of the culprit is with the very nature of our moral
consciousness, moral indignation being a hostile attitude of mind
towards a living being conceived as a cause of pain. Dean Inge says
that “it may be worth while to distinguish between vicarious
punishment, which is immoral, and vicarious suffering, which love is
willing to endure.”<a name="FnAnchor966" href="#Footnote966"><span
class="sp">966</span></a> Other writers<a name="FnAnchor967"
href="#Footnote967"><span class="sp">967</span></a> refer to John’s
saying, “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
life for his friends.”<a name="FnAnchor968" href="#Footnote968"><span
class="sp">968</span></a> This is quite true, but does not explain
<em>why</em> the self-sacrifice of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page164"></a>164</span> Christ makes amends for the sins of
mankind. Our moral consciousness does not admit that the execution of
an innocent person can cancel the guilt of a criminal, and, in
addition, finds it outrageous that, as in the present case, the
sinner, in order to benefit by the death of the innocent person, must
have faith in such an order of things established by a righteous God.
It sounds like mockery to be told that “the righteousness of God may
be discerned in the death of Christ.”<a name="FnAnchor969"
href="#Footnote969"><span class="sp">969</span></a> The Socinians
argued that the doctrine of vicarious suffering blunts the conscience
and leads easily to moral laxity;<a name="FnAnchor970"
href="#Footnote970"><span class="sp">970</span></a> and the doctrine
of vicarious merit may certainly have a similar effect.</p>

<p>The modifications of Augustinianism which took place in
Scholasticism had generally a moralistic tendency. The ethical
interest is particularly predominant in Abelard, who was sure that
what answers to the moral law also is holy and good before God, and
consequently endeavoured to show that in the doctrinal system of the
Church the principles of morality shall have as much justice done to
them as the fundamental theological speculations on nature.<a
name="FnAnchor971" href="#Footnote971"><span class="sp">971</span></a>
That his success in carrying conviction was small is not to be
wondered at; his contemporaries felt repelled by many of his
propositions. They certainly suffered from contradictions; but above
all, the conflict between morality and the religion of the Church was
too great to allow any considerable modifications of her dogmas or
their interpretations.</p>

href="#FnAnchor971"><sup>971</sup></a></span> Harnack, <i>History of

<p>The Reformation implied an Augustinian reaction and a restoration
of Paulinism. It substituted the Bible for the authority of the
Church, and the kernel and marrow of the Bible was in particular the
epistles of Paul. Luther passed through a crisis of the same kind as
that which Paul had experienced in his day. It implied the conviction
that in faith in Jesus he had a gracious God, who had revealed himself
in the gospel, that is, in the incarnated, crucified, and risen
Christ. We are justified by faith alone, this justification is the
forgiveness of sins,<a name="FnAnchor972" href="#Footnote972"><span
class="sp">972</span></a> and the faith through which it takes place
should make the believer feel an absolute confidence in his own
personal and complete salvation.<a name="FnAnchor973"
href="#Footnote973"><span class="sp">973</span></a> Sometimes he
pushes his insistence upon faith, and faith only, to the point of
disparaging repentance. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page165"></a>165</span> “Priests,” he declares, “err and are mad,
not to absolve people unless they are contrite, and they ask, ‘Son, do
you grieve for your sins?’” They should only say, “Dost thou, believe?
Believe and have confidence.” “Thus Christ, said to the sinful woman,
‘Thy sins are forgiven thee. I absolve thee, go in peace, because thou
believest.’”<a name="FnAnchor974" href="#Footnote974"><span
class="sp">974</span></a> The Schoolmen had developed the hint
contained in Paul’s expression “faith working by love,” and
distinguished between an “unformed” faith&mdash;a mere intellectual
belief&mdash;and a “formed” faith, which includes love, and which
alone justifies and saves. But to Luther the doctrine that we are
saved by faith formed by charity is an abominable blasphemy.<a
name="FnAnchor975" href="#Footnote975"><span class="sp">975</span></a>
“We can be saved without charity, . . . but not without pure doctrine
and faith.”<a name="FnAnchor976" href="#Footnote976"><span
class="sp">976</span></a> “No good work can profit an unbeliever to
justification and salvation; and, on the other hand, no evil work
makes him an evil and condemned person, but that unbelief, which makes
the person and the tree bad, makes his works evil and condemned.
Wherefore, when any man is made good or bad, this does not arise from
his works, but from his faith or unbelief.”<a name="FnAnchor977"
href="#Footnote977"><span class="sp">977</span></a> But Luther even
denied that we can do any good work at all. Among the famous
ninety-five theses which he nailed on the church door of Wittenberg
there were the assertions that “the just man sins in every good work,”
and that “our best work is a venial sin.” But in his explanation the
last thesis is withdrawn in favour of the assertion that every good
work of the just man is a mortal sin if it were judged by the judgment
of God.<a name="FnAnchor978" href="#Footnote978"><span
class="sp">978</span></a> Both Augustine and the Schoolmen had taught
that after justification, with the assistance of divine grace and of
the divine spirit, the Christian really did become capable of good
works, well-pleasing to God, and this was just what Luther in his more
dogmatic moments categorically denied.<a name="FnAnchor979"
href="#Footnote979"><span class="sp">979</span></a> Yet in his more
moderate statements he can declare that the sanctifying grace given
after the man has been justified by faith enables him to do good
works. He writes: “If thou believest, good works will <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page166"></a>166</span> necessarily follow thy
faith,”<a name="FnAnchor980" href="#Footnote980"><span
class="sp">980</span></a> and even: “He believeth not truly if works
of charity follow not his faith.”<a name="FnAnchor981"
href="#Footnote981"><span class="sp">981</span></a> At the same time
the good works which are done when the man has been justified are not
really done by him but by God. “To sleep and to do nothing is the work
of Christians,” he exclaims in a sermon on Jacob’s dream.<a
name="FnAnchor982" href="#Footnote982"><span class="sp">982</span></a>
As Luther grew older, his conception of faith became more and more
intellectual, till at last it comprised little beyond the assent of
mind to certain articles of an orthodox creed.<a name="FnAnchor983"
href="#Footnote983"><span class="sp">983</span></a> “One little point
of doctrine,” he says, “is of more value than heaven and earth;
therefore we do not suffer it (<i>i.e.</i> doctrine) to be injured in
the smallest particular. But at errors of life we may very well
connive.”<a name="FnAnchor984" href="#Footnote984"><span

<p>Luther took over the Augustinian doctrine of the entire incapacity
of fallen man and of the bondage of the will. True, he describes
Paul’s teaching of the derivation of human sin from Adam as “a
laughable doctrine,” and asks what can be more ridiculous than the
fact that Adam, by taking a bite of an apple, put all men, to the very
end of the world, into the power of death.<a name="FnAnchor985"
href="#Footnote985"><span class="sp">985</span></a> But he knows how
to answer charges of this kind. “It is,” he says, “a quality of faith
that it wrings the neck of reason and strangles the beast, which else
the whole world, with all creatures, could not strangle. But how? It
holds to God’s Word: lets it be right and true, no matter how foolish
and impossible it sounds.”<a name="FnAnchor986"
href="#Footnote986"><span class="sp">986</span></a> The Fall itself
and the penalties which it brought with it were predestined. Luther
accepted Augustine’s doctrine of predestination.</p>

<p>Although Luther would not hear of any human merit, he believed in
the merit of Christ, who, as the Confession of Augsburg put it,
“suffered and died that he might reconcile the Father to us, and be a
sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins
of men.”<a name="FnAnchor987" href="#Footnote987"><span
class="sp">987</span></a> Christ’s righteousness is <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page167"></a>167</span> imputed to us.<a
name="FnAnchor988" href="#Footnote988"><span class="sp">988</span></a>
“Christ, that rich and pious husband, takes as a wife a needy and
impious harlot, redeeming her from all her evils and supplying her
with all his good things. It is impossible now that her sins should
destroy her, since they have been laid upon Christ and swallowed up in
him.”<a name="FnAnchor989" href="#Footnote989"><span
class="sp">989</span></a> Our faith in Christ makes his piety ours,
and makes our sins his. He was the greatest of all sinners, “because
he assumed in his body the sins we had committed, to make satisfaction
for them by his own blood.”<a name="FnAnchor990"
href="#Footnote990"><span class="sp">990</span></a> “He was crucified
and died for us, and offered up our sins in his own body.”<a
name="FnAnchor991" href="#Footnote991"><span class="sp">991</span></a>
And Christ is represented as not merely dying instead of us, but also
as keeping the law instead of us. “This is the gospel . . . that the
law has been fulfilled, that is, by Christ, so that it is not
necessary for us to fulfil it, but only to adhere and be conformed to
him who fulfils it.”<a name="FnAnchor992" href="#Footnote992"><span
class="sp">992</span></a> We meet with this idea also in the Reformed
Church. Jonathan Edwards says that “Christ’s perfect obedience shall
be reckoned to our account, so that we shall have the benefit of it,
as though we had performed it ourselves.”<a name="FnAnchor993"
href="#Footnote993"><span class="sp">993</span></a> But Dean Rashdall
is probably right in saying that Luther’s “insistence on correctness
of doctrine and his contempt for ‘mere morality’ would be difficult to
parallel from any previous writer.”<a name="FnAnchor994"

<p>The other Reformers were, generally, in substantial agreement with
Luther.<a name="FnAnchor995" href="#Footnote995"><span
class="sp">995</span></a> Zwingli likewise substituted the authority
of the Bible for the authority of the Church, and preached the
justification by faith alone. He denied, however, that he was
dependent on Luther (who was exactly of his own age), and though he
spoke in admiring language of him, he would not be called a Lutheran.
He says he took his doctrine from Scripture and preached it before
even he heard the name of Luther.<a name="FnAnchor996"
href="#Footnote996"><span class="sp">996</span></a> A <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page168"></a>168</span> distinction has been
drawn between their attitudes towards Scripture: Luther, it is said,
was willing to abide by any existing doctrine or usage which he did
not find expressly forbidden by it, whereas Zwingli demanded distinct
warrant of it for whatever he was willing to allow. But the latter
took a wider view of what Scripture was. He was more biblical than
Pauline: he did not so exclusively as Luther take his gospel from
Paul’s epistles and then read it into the whole Bible. It is
significant that the Epistle to the Romans finds no place in his
scheme of scriptural instruction.<a name="FnAnchor997"
href="#Footnote997"><span class="sp">997</span></a> He was much more
than Luther a humanist, and more a moralist as well. He writes, for
instance, that the Christian life is “an innocent life after Christ’s
pattern”;<a name="FnAnchor998" href="#Footnote998"><span
class="sp">998</span></a> that “we are not born that we may live to
ourselves, but that we may be all things to all men”;<a
name="FnAnchor999" href="#Footnote999"><span class="sp">999</span></a>
that “it is the part of a Christian man not to talk magnificently of
doctrines, but always with God to do great and hard things.”<a
name="FnAnchor1000" href="#Footnote1000"><span
class="sp">1000</span></a> And his more reasonable view of the
sacraments<a name="FnAnchor1001" href="#Footnote1001"><span

and Luther, which became a rock on which Reformation was wrecked.</p>

<p>Calvin was a full generation younger than Luther and Zwingli. He is
the only one of the great Reformers who can justly be called
international. In Switzerland the influence of Zwingli paled before
that of his countryman, the Genevese Reformer. Calvinism soon found a
footing even in Germany, especially in the Palatinate. In France it
was the religion of the Huguenots. In its strength the Dutch Republic
was sustained, and the American Republic was founded. It partly turned
the current of the English Reformation in the direction of Puritanism.
It made Scotland what it is. Its leading ideas are generally ideas
which Zwingli had already put forward in a less precise and systematic
form; but in his great work, the ‘Institution of the Christian
Religion,’ he gathered up all the diverse threads of the new thought
and wove them into a homogeneous system. In his appeal from the
authority of the Church to Scripture he took the Bible much more as a
whole than Luther did. He was full of a Hebrew spirit, and used
references to the Old Testament to modify the too great humanity of
the gospel. This accounts for the fact that among the English Puritans
of the seventeenth century the Mosaic <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page169"></a>169</span> legislation and the Jewish kingdom and
church took a place to which the earlier history of Christianity
offers no parallel. Like Luther, Calvin was an Augustinian in assuming
the absolute foreknowledge and determining power of God, the servitude
of the human will, the corruption and incapacity of man’s nature. To
him, however, the main thing was not the sinner’s personal relation to
Christ and his appropriation of the Saviour’s work, but the awful
omnipotence of the Divine decree fixing the unalterable succession of
events, shutting out all co-operation of the human will. God chose
certain individuals as his elect, predestining them to salvation from
eternity by “his gratuitous mercy, totally irrespective of human
merit,” and consigned the remainder to eternal damnation, by “a just
and irreprehensible, but incomprehensible judgment.”<a
name="FnAnchor1002" href="#Footnote1002"><span
class="sp">1002</span></a> To apply earthly standards of justice to
God’s sovereign decrees is meaningless and an insult to his majesty,
since he and he alone is free, subject to no law. To assume that human
merit and guilt play a part in determining the destiny of man would be
to think of God’s absolutely free decrees, which have been settled
from eternity, as subject to change by human influence, an impossible
contradiction. And since his decrees cannot change, it is as
impossible for those to whom his grace has been granted to lose it, as
it is impossible to attain it for those to whom he has denied it.<a

<p>It might seem that such ideas must be fatal to morals and produce
slackness of will. Yet we find that Calvinists have been among the
most strenuous of men: Calvin himself, John Knox, William of Nassau,
Oliver Cromwell, and many others. This is congruous with the fact that
“no true Calvinist, save one perhaps here and there, ever believes
that he is finally reprobate; . . . on the contrary, he feels himself
to be an instrument of the Omnipotent Will, and bends to whatever toil
he undertakes in the unshakable conviction that he is on the side of
God.”<a name="FnAnchor1004" href="#Footnote1004"><span
class="sp">1004</span></a> Indeed, it is held to be an absolute duty
to consider oneself chosen, and to combat all doubts as temptations of
the devil, since lack of self-confidence is the result of insufficient
faith, hence of imperfect grace.<a name="FnAnchor1005"
href="#Footnote1005"><span class="sp">1005</span></a> In order to
attain such self-confidence, intense worldly activity, which serves to
increase the glory of God, is recommended as the most suitable means.
However useless good works might be as a means of attaining salvation,
nevertheless they are indispensable as a sign of election. They are
the technical means, not of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page170"></a>170</span> purchasing salvation, but of getting rid
of the fear of damnation.<a name="FnAnchor1006"
href="#Footnote1006"><span class="sp">1006</span></a> Lutherans have
again and again accused this line of thought of reversion to the
Catholic doctrine of salvation by works. But the God of Calvinism did
not demand of his believers an accumulation of individual good works
to one’s credit. The Calvinist’s conviction of salvation depends
rather on a systematic self-control, on a life of good works combined
into a unified system. Max Weber observes that it is no accident that
the name of Methodists stuck to the participants in the last great
revival of Puritan ideas in the eighteenth century.<a

<p>Calvin’s conception of God’s law shows itself in the reign of
terror which he established at Geneva. He laid down in the
‘Institution’ that the Church has not the right of the sword to punish
or restrain and knows of no punishment save exclusion from the Lord’s
Supper,<a name="FnAnchor1008" href="#Footnote1008"><span
class="sp">1008</span></a> but he used the State as its instrument in
punishing, for the honour of God, such acts as he assumed to be
opposed to the Divine mind and purpose. They were many and varied, and
the punishments inflicted were worse than Draconian. Adultery was
repeatedly punished with death. Banishment, imprisonment, in some
cases drowning, were penalties inflicted on unchastity. It was a
punishable offence to wear clothes of forbidden stuff or make; to give
a feast to too many guests or of too many dishes; to dance at a
wedding. A child was beheaded for having struck father and mother.<a
name="FnAnchor1009" href="#Footnote1009"><span
class="sp">1009</span></a> Calvinism accounts for the strict home
discipline among the English Puritans, with its liberal use of the
rod. Its doctrine of original sin led to an utter distrust of child
nature. Even Bunyan bids parents remember that children are cursed
creatures, whose wills, being evil, are to be broken.<a

<p>The English Reformation has no name to show beside those of Luther,
Zwingli, and Calvin. But during the reign of Edward VI. communications
were opened with the Reformed Churches of the Continent, which
resulted in a strong foreign influence of Protestant theologians,
whose theology was more Calvinistic than Lutheran. It was when this
influence was at its height that the English Prayer-book was shaped
and the foundation laid of the Thirty-nine Articles. At the same time
the English Reformation is characterised by the continuity of the
Anglican Church which makes it impossible to fix the point where the
old Church ends and the new begins; she is the heir of the Catholic
tradition as well as of the Reformation. The materials of the
Prayer-book were quarried in the mines of English mediæval <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page171"></a>171</span> piety, while the
theology of the Thirty-nine Articles is that of the Confession of
Augsburg. During the reign of Elizabeth there was a growing prevalence
of Calvinistic theology. Puritanism, which was chiefly Calvinistic,
spread in every diocese, and in the Nine Lambeth Articles of 1595 the
main points of Calvinism were laid down with uncompromising
rigidity.<a name="FnAnchor1011" href="#Footnote1011"><span
class="sp">1011</span></a> They were never imposed upon the English
Church, but in the following century Puritanism was still in the
ascendant. It did not, however, establish itself as the controlling
power in English religion. While Scotland was strongly Calvinistic and
Presbyterian, the Puritans in England did not capture the Church, and
were compelled to struggle hard for the right to follow their own
consciences.<a name="FnAnchor1012" href="#Footnote1012"><span

<p>Reformation was a protest not only against doctrines taught by the
Catholic Church, but also against moral abuses practised in its name,
such as benefactions being accepted in atonement for flagrant sin, and
escape from purgatory being bought of wandering indulgence-mongers in
any market-place. But at the same time the Reformers rejected the
sound moral principles which were defiled by such corrupt practices.
They denied altogether the value of good deeds, however sincere, and
the different degrees of sinfulness of which the doctrine of purgatory
was an expression; and while they condemned to eternal damnation the
most virtuous man who lacks the orthodox belief, which has nothing to
do with morality, Luther, as we have seen, even went so far as to
promise salvation to the greatest sinner who has such a belief. No
wonder that such an attractive doctrine was taken advantage of. Von
Döllinger has accumulated a vast mass of evidence to show that the
immediate result of the Reformation was a dissolution of morals; that
the restraint of religion was relaxed, and that the characters of the
Protestant preachers themselves were by no means without stain. Part
of this evidence is drawn from the works of Catholic theologians, who
were altogether out of harmony with the Reformation; part from those
of humanists who grew dissatisfied with it before they died; part from
the utterances of men who retreated from the Protestant into the
Catholic ranks. All of them lay the blame of the neglect of morals
upon the doctrine of justification by faith alone.<a
name="FnAnchor1013" href="#Footnote1013"><span
class="sp">1013</span></a> Evidence from such sources is certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172"></a>172</span> not above
suspicion; but there remain a series of painful confessions of
disappointment with the moral results of their work on the part of the
Reformers themselves, and especially of Luther. “In passage after
passage Luther declares that the last state of things was worse than
the first; that vice of every kind had increased since the
Reformation; that the nobles were greedy, the peasants brutal; that
the corruption of morals in Wittenberg itself was so great that he
contemplated shaking off the dust of his feet against it; that
Christian liberality had altogether ceased to flow; and that the
preachers were neither held in respect nor supported by the people.
Towards the close of his life, these complaints became more bitter and
more frequent. Sometimes the Devil is called in to account for so
painful and perplexing a state of things. . . . But it is significant
that Luther himself does not altogether acquit the doctrine of
justification&mdash;though in his view misapprehended&mdash;of blame
in this matter.”<a name="FnAnchor1014" href="#Footnote1014"><span
class="sp">1014</span></a> Harnack writes: “The holding to the ‘faith
alone’ (‘fides sola’) necessarily resulted in dangerous laxity. What
would really have been required here would have been to lead
Christians to see that only the ‘fides caritate formata’ has a real
value before God. . . . If one has persuaded himself that everything
that suggests ‘good works’ must be dropped out of the religious
sequence, there ultimately remains over only the readiness to subject
one’s self to faith, <i>i.e.</i> to the pure doctrine. . . . The
Lutheran Church had to pay dearly for turning away from ‘legal
righteousness,’ ‘sacrifice,’ and ‘satisfactions.’ Through having the
resolute wish to go back to <em>religion</em> and to it alone, it
neglected far too much the moral problem, the ‘Be ye holy, for I am
holy.’”<a name="FnAnchor1015" href="#Footnote1015"><span
class="sp">1015</span></a> Thus the demoralising effect of Paul’s
teaching of justification by faith alone, which already was noticed in
Apostolic times, was again testified at the Reformation.</p>

<p>In the history of moral protests against Christian dogmas
Pelagianism, which played an important part in the beginning of the
fifth century, has to be mentioned; indeed, it has been justly said
that in the study of no other controversy can we learn so much about
the connection and the distinction between morality and religion. The
two earnest monks Pelagius and Cælestius and their associate, the
wordly bishop Julian of Eclanum, taught that as God’s highest
attributes are his goodness and righteousness, everything created by
him must be good, and that human nature must remain so
indestructively, though it may be modified accidentally. To its
constitution belongs the will as free choice, and this free choice,
with which reason is <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page173"></a>173</span> implied, is the highest good in man’s
constitution. We are free to abstain from sin, as Adam was before the
fall: his sin&mdash;which Julian esteemed of slight account&mdash;was
not transmitted. The doctrine of inherited or original sin is
blasphemous and absurd: it annuls God’s righteousness, it contradicts
the fact that there can be no sin where there is no free will, it
leads to the condemnation of marriage when original sin is assumed to
be propagated by sexual intercourse. In the discussion of divine grace
the statements of the Pelagians are often contradictory or ambiguous.
Sometimes it is said to be necessary to every good work, sometimes to
facilitate goodness, and sometimes to be superfluous. The two latter
positions, which to a certain extent can be combined, seem to give
their real opinion; “for it was assuredly the chief intention of
Pelagius to deprive Christians of their indolent reliance on grace,
and Julian’s main object was to show that the human constitution bore
merit and salvation in its own lap.” There are three states of grace.
In the first place, there is the grace of creation, which is so
glorious that even heathens and Jews may be perfect men; Julian sneers
at the saying that the virtuous of the heathen are only splendid
vices. In the second place, grace denotes the law of God; indeed all
grace, in so far as it is not nature, can have no other character than
that of illumination and instruction (<i>doctrina</i>) which
facilitates the doing of good. Thirdly, grace means the grace of God
through Christ, which also is at bottom “illumination and
instruction”: Christ works by his example. Pelagius and Julian admit
that the habit of sinning was so great that Christ’s appearance was
necessary. This grace through Christ is quite compatible with the
righteousness of God, because the latter does not preclude an increase
of benefit, but that grace is given according to our merits; in any
other case God would have been unjust.<a name="FnAnchor1016"

<p>The Pelagians never came to form a sect or schismatical party. They
were suppressed, chiefly by the influence of Augustine, in the years
after <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 418, without it being necessary
to apply any special force, and in the West Pelagianism brought upon
itself a kind of universal anathema. Although the subsequent
development of Christian thought has tended to confirm certain
individual propositions of the Pelagian system, it was rejected both
by Catholics and Protestants. From a moral point of view it was
superior to the doctrines of both.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX</h4>
<h3>ASCETICISM</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="smcap">HE</span> ethical value of the doctrine that
good works are essential to salvation is much reduced by the fact that
merit is particularly ascribed to works which our moral consciousness
is apt to regard as indifferent or even to disapprove of, namely,
ascetic practices, not in the sense of strict self-discipline but of
deliberate maltreatment of the body.</p>
<p>Such practices were not prescribed in the original body of
Christian doctrine as necessary to salvation, but the ascetic
principle soon made way for itself in the development of the Christian
Church. The beginnings of early Christian asceticism were due to the
influence of Greek and Judæo-Hellenic philosophy. According to the
conception of Eastern theologians religion and morality were closely
bound together: “God does not accept doctrine without good works, nor
works separated from the dogmas of religion.”<a name="FnAnchor1017"
href="#Footnote1017"><span class="sp">1017</span></a> But there was
one kind of good works which did not appear to be merely subordinate
to religious faith and hope, but seemed to anticipate the future
blessings or to put man into the condition of being able to receive
them immediately. This was asceticism, which was regarded as the
adequate and principal disposition for the reception of salvation. The
achievement of more positive morality appeared as a minimum, to which
the shadow of imperfection always clung. Clement of Alexandria deemed
the performance of any act by which the senses are gratified, for the
purpose of obtaining that gratification, derogatory from Christian
perfection, nay even sinful:<a name="FnAnchor1018"
href="#Footnote1018"><span class="sp">1018</span></a> “a sensual life
is unseemly, opprobrious, hateful, and contemptible.”<a
name="FnAnchor1019" href="#Footnote1019"><span
class="sp">1019</span></a> Origen remained an enthusiastic panegyrist
of world-renunciation and mortification of the flesh, even after he
had repented the hyper-ascetic excesses of his youth, especially his
self-emasculation.<a name="FnAnchor1020" href="#Footnote1020"><span
class="sp">1020</span></a> John of Damascus characterised asceticism
as a salutary means of correcting the deterioration <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page175"></a>175</span> of the human state:
“Asceticism and its toils were not invented to procure the virtue that
comes from without, but to remove superinduced and unnatural vileness,
just as we restore the natural brightness of iron by carefully
removing the rust, which is not natural, but has come to it through
negligence.”<a name="FnAnchor1021" href="#Footnote1021"><span

<p>Western Christianity kept real life more distinctly in view. In
spite of the asceticism which Ambrose also preached, he constantly
discussed all the concrete affairs of the time and the moral wants of
the community. He thus represents the intimate union of the ascetic
ideal with energetic insistence on positive morality,<a
name="FnAnchor1022" href="#Footnote1022"><span
class="sp">1022</span></a> and this union the Western mediæval Church
never lost, however much practical life was subordinated to the
contemplative. Augustine looked upon the ascetic life as the ideal for
the individual, but at the same time broke through the barren system
which made blessedness consist in contemplation alone by urging the
monastic ascetics to engage in active work; and although the
<i>merita</i> which he said would be crowned at the Judgment were
works thoroughly ascetic, he did not consider it necessary for
everybody to practise asceticism.<a name="FnAnchor1023"
href="#Footnote1023"><span class="sp">1023</span></a> Before his time
Clement had distinguished between ordinary and extraordinary rules of
life, the latter of which are laid down for Christians perfected in
knowledge, but are too pure and spiritual to be comprehended by the
great mass of believers.<a name="FnAnchor1024"
href="#Footnote1024"><span class="sp">1024</span></a> Tertullian had
also, like Augustine, made a difference between precepts and counsels,
and the same was subsequently done by Thomas Aquinas, who considered
the following of the counsels, by relinquishing the benefits of this
world, to be more meritorious than the following of the precepts.<a

<p>In Christian asceticism fasting came gradually to hold a prominent
position. In the primitive Church there were two weekly fast-days,
which undoubtedly were a Pharisaic inheritance, although the days were
different. It is said in the ‘Didache’ that the “hypocrites” fast on
Monday and Thursday, but that the Christians should fast on Wednesday
and Friday;<a name="FnAnchor1026" href="#Footnote1026"><span
class="sp">1026</span></a> and fasting is also prescribed as
preparatory to baptism, both for the baptiser and the baptised.<a
name="FnAnchor1027" href="#Footnote1027"><span
class="sp">1027</span></a> Fasting was an accompaniment of prayer. In
the ‘Shepherd’ of Hermas we read: “All prayer needeth humiliation;
fast therefore, and thou shalt <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page176"></a>176</span> learn from the Lord that which thou dost
ask.”<a name="FnAnchor1028" href="#Footnote1028"><span
class="sp">1028</span></a> Clement of Alexandria also speaks of
fasting on Wednesday and Friday,<a name="FnAnchor1029"
href="#Footnote1029"><span class="sp">1029</span></a> and from his day
these fasts became more and more general both in the East and the
West.<a name="FnAnchor1030" href="#Footnote1030"><span
class="sp">1030</span></a> In Tertullian’s time a half-fast
terminating at three in the afternoon was kept in the Catholic Church,
though he contended that the fast ought to be prolonged till the
evening.<a name="FnAnchor1031" href="#Footnote1031"><span
class="sp">1031</span></a> These were voluntary fasts, and observed on
the authority of tradition, Wednesday being selected because on that
day the Jews took counsel to destroy Christ, and Friday because that
was the day of his crucifixion. But there was also a fast that was
considered obligatory upon all Christians, namely, the Lent fast,
consisting in a total abstinence from food during the interval between
Christ’s passion and resurrection.<a name="FnAnchor1032"
href="#Footnote1032"><span class="sp">1032</span></a> The Montanists
were anxious to introduce a more rigorous discipline in the observance
of fasts, and their two weeks’ “xerophagy,” which implied abstinence
from flesh and wine, induced the Church to prolong her Lent fast.<a
name="FnAnchor1033" href="#Footnote1033"><span
class="sp">1033</span></a> Indeed, she gradually extended the fast
which lasted for forty hours, the time when Christ lay in the grave,
to forty days, in imitation of the forty days’ fasts of Moses, Elijah,
and Christ.<a name="FnAnchor1034" href="#Footnote1034"><span
class="sp">1034</span></a> A custom which is known to have existed at
the beginning of the fifth century and subsequently, slowly, became
general in the Western Church is that of observing every Saturday as a
fast-day.<a name="FnAnchor1035" href="#Footnote1035"><span

<p>Many other fasts of a longer or shorter duration were also
introduced, before religious festivals or in connection with them; so
that in the Roman Catholic Church, since the ninth century, fasting is
more or less obligatory on about 120 days of the year.<a
name="FnAnchor1036" href="#Footnote1036"><span
class="sp">1036</span></a> But a conscientious member of the Greek
Church abstains from flesh at least 180 days and from fish as well
about 140 days. Most of these fasts are known to have existed there
from the fourth or sixth century onwards.<a name="FnAnchor1037"
href="#Footnote1037"><span class="sp">1037</span></a> There are, in
addition, compulsory individual fasts connected with baptism,
confirmation, communion, ordination, and nuptials, as also penitential
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page177"></a>177</span> fasts.<a
name="FnAnchor1038" href="#Footnote1038"><span
class="sp">1038</span></a> Besides these there are voluntary fasts. Of
some of these incredible stories have been told as the highest proof
of excellence. Jerome declares that he had seen a monk who for thirty
years had lived exclusively on barley bread and muddy waters while
another, who lived in an old cistern, kept himself alive on five dried
figs a day.<a name="FnAnchor1039" href="#Footnote1039"><span
class="sp">1039</span></a> Of a famous saint it is asserted that for

class="sp">1040</span></a> In Mesopotamia and part of Syria there
existed a whole sect known by the name of “Grazers,” who never lived
under a roof, but spent their time for ever on the mountain-side and
ate grass like cattle.<a name="FnAnchor1041"

<p>There were other ascetic practices equally appalling. We read of
hermits who lived in deserted dens of wild beasts, or in dried-up
wells, or in tombs; who disdained all clothes, and crawled abroad like
animals covered only by their matted hair; who spent forty days and
nights in the middle of thornbushes, and for forty years never lay
down.<a name="FnAnchor1042" href="#Footnote1042"><span
class="sp">1042</span></a> In the early days of Christian monasticism
“the cleanliness of the body was regarded as the pollution of the
soul.” The saints who were most admired were those who had become one
hideous mass of clotted filth. Athanasius relates with enthusiasm how
St. Antony, the patriarch of monasticism, never washed his feet, “nor
even endured so much as to put them into water, unless compelled by
necessity.”<a name="FnAnchor1043" href="#Footnote1043"><span
class="sp">1043</span></a> St. Simeon Stylites, who was generally
pronounced to be the highest model of a Christian saint, bound a rope
round himself so that it became imbedded in his flesh and caused
putrefaction; and it is said that “a horrible stench, intolerable to
the bystanders, exhaled from his body, and worms dropped from him
whenever he moved, and they filled his bed.”<a name="FnAnchor1044"
href="#Footnote1044"><span class="sp">1044</span></a> Even a
philosopher like Clement of Alexandria asserts that while women may
bathe for cleanliness and health, men may only bathe for health.<a

<p>The most important form of asceticism has been abstinence from
sexual relationships. From the earliest period there were circles of
ascetics in the Christian communities who required of all, as an
inviolable law under the name of Christian perfection, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page178"></a>178</span> complete abstinence
from marriage. As Jesus had been unmarried and his mother was a
virgin, did not this represent the divine ideal for men and women who
sought to be like him? The Marcionites permitted no union of the
sexes, and those who were married had to separate ere they could be
received by baptism into the community.<a name="FnAnchor1046"
href="#Footnote1046"><span class="sp">1046</span></a> Hierarcas, a
disciple of Origen who lived at the close of the third and in the
first half of the fourth century, insisted on the suppression of the
sexual impulse as a demand of the Logos-Christ, and consequently
required celibacy as a Christian law.<a name="FnAnchor1047"
href="#Footnote1047"><span class="sp">1047</span></a> The Eustathians
also condemned marriage. They were opposed by the Synod of Gangra;<a
name="FnAnchor1048" href="#Footnote1048"><span
class="sp">1048</span></a> but the numerous tractates <i>De
virginitate</i> show how near the great Fathers of the Church came to
the Eustathian view. Clement of Alexandria combats the notions of the
heretics who, like Marcion, enjoined abstinence from marriage in order
that the world created by the Demiurge might not be peopled; or, like
Tatian, dared to ascribe the institution of marriage to the devil,
contending that the binding of the woman to the man, mentioned by Paul
(1 <i>Corinthians</i> vii. 39), meant the union of the flesh to
corruption.<a name="FnAnchor1049" href="#Footnote1049"><span
class="sp">1049</span></a> But he limits the lawful use of marriage to
the procreation of children.<a name="FnAnchor1050"
href="#Footnote1050"><span class="sp">1050</span></a> According to
Methodius, in whom we have the final stage of Greek theology, marriage
is not forbidden,<a name="FnAnchor1051" href="#Footnote1051"><span
class="sp">1051</span></a> but unstained virginity is ranked high
above the married state. It is the condition of Christlikeness,<a
name="FnAnchor1052" href="#Footnote1052"><span
class="sp">1052</span></a> and all Christians must strive towards it.
It is like a spring flower, always softly exhaling immortality from
its white petals.<a name="FnAnchor1053" href="#Footnote1053"><span
class="sp">1053</span></a> It is “the flower and first fruits of
incorruption, and therefore the Lord promises to admit those who have
preserved their virginity into the kingdom of heaven.”<a

<p>The apologist Justin asserts that the Christians either abstained
from marriage altogether or married with the sole view of having
children, and that such as refuse to marry contain perpetually within
the bounds of chastity.<a name="FnAnchor1055"
href="#Footnote1055"><span class="sp">1055</span></a> According to
Athenagoras, procreation is the measure of a Christian’s indulgence in
appetite, just as the husbandman throwing the seed into the ground
awaits the harvest, not sowing more upon it. “Many among us,” he adds,
“both men and women, have grown old in a state of celibacy, through
the hope that they <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page179"></a>179</span> shall thereby be more closely united to
God. But if the condition of virgins and eunuchs is more acceptable to
God and even thoughts and desires exclude us from his presence, surely
we shall renounce the act when we shun the very wish.”<a
name="FnAnchor1056" href="#Footnote1056"><span
class="sp">1056</span></a> Tertullian, on the authority of the new
prophecy of Montanus, if not actually condemning marriage, yet on all
occasions gives a decided preference to a life of celibacy. Commenting
on the words of the Apostle that “it is better to marry than to burn,”
he points out that what is better is not necessarily good. It is
better to lose one eye than two, but neither is good; so also, though
it is better to marry than to burn, it is far better neither to marry
nor to burn.<a name="FnAnchor1057" href="#Footnote1057"><span
class="sp">1057</span></a> Marriage unfits the soul for devotional
exercises.<a name="FnAnchor1058" href="#Footnote1058"><span
class="sp">1058</span></a> It “consists of that which is the essence
of fornication,”<a name="FnAnchor1059" href="#Footnote1059"><span
class="sp">1059</span></a> and is only allowed under the gospel in
condescension to human infirmity. “The union of the sexes was, it is
true, in the beginning blessed by God, being devised for the purpose
of peopling the earth, and on that account permitted.”<a
name="FnAnchor1060" href="#Footnote1060"><span
class="sp">1060</span></a> On the other hand, continence “is a means
whereby a man will traffic in a mighty substance of sanctity”;<a
name="FnAnchor1061" href="#Footnote1061"><span
class="sp">1061</span></a> the Lord himself opens the kingdoms of the
heavens to eunuchs.<a name="FnAnchor1062" href="#Footnote1062"><span
class="sp">1062</span></a> Yet when Tertullian is opposing Marcion and
other heretics who condemned marriage altogether, he speaks of it as a
pure and honourable state;<a name="FnAnchor1063"
href="#Footnote1063"><span class="sp">1063</span></a> and he even

<p>Ambrose celebrated virginity as the real novelty in Christian
morality: this virtue is our exclusive possession, the heathen had it
not.<a name="FnAnchor1066" href="#Footnote1066"><span
class="sp">1066</span></a> It works miracles: Mary, the sister of
Moses, leading the female band, passed on foot over the straits of the
sea, and by the same grace Thecla was reverenced even by lions, so
that the unfed beasts, lying at the feet of their prey, underwent a
holy fast, neither with wanton look nor sharp <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page180"></a>180</span> claw venturing to harm the virgin.<a
name="FnAnchor1067" href="#Footnote1067"><span
class="sp">1067</span></a> But Ambrose admitted that though virginity
is the shortest way to the camp of the faithful, the way of matrimony
also arrives there, by a longer circuit.<a name="FnAnchor1068"
href="#Footnote1068"><span class="sp">1068</span></a> According to
Augustine, pride in relation to God and concupiscence show that man is
sinful in soul and body; but the emphasis falls on concupiscence, the
lust of the flesh. The <i>motus genitalium</i>, independent even of
will, teaches us that nature is corrupt. But although the
involuntariness of the impulse should exclude the possibility of its
being sinful, Augustine concludes that there is a sin which belongs to
nature and not to the sphere of the will. Children possess original
sin because their parents have procreated them in lust,<a
name="FnAnchor1069" href="#Footnote1069"><span
class="sp">1069</span></a> whereas Christ was sinless because he was
not born of marriage.<a name="FnAnchor1070" href="#Footnote1070"><span
class="sp">1070</span></a> Augustine imagined paradisiacal marriages
in which children were begotten without lust, or, as Julian says
jerkingly, were to be shaken from trees. Similar views had been
expressed before, by Marcion and others. Gregory of Nyssa,<a
name="FnAnchor1071" href="#Footnote1071"><span
class="sp">1071</span></a> and in a later time John of Damascus, held
the opinion that virginity belonged to the nature of man and that if
Adam had preserved his obedience to the Creator some harmless method
of vegetation would have peopled paradise with a race of innocent and
immortal beings&mdash;an opinion which was opposed by Thomas Aquinas,
who maintained that the human race from the beginning was propagated
by means of sexual intercourse, but that such intercourse originally
was free from all carnal desire.<a name="FnAnchor1072"
href="#Footnote1072"><span class="sp">1072</span></a> One would think
that Augustine’s conception of the sinfulness mingled with all
procreation should have led him to reject marriage. But he argues that
many things are permitted by the Apostles, although they are sinful,
matrimonial intercourse being one of these, and that many things which
custom has brought us to look on lightly, for example unchastity, are
dreadful, even though Church discipline itself has become lax in
dealing with them.<a name="FnAnchor1073" href="#Footnote1073"><span
class="sp">1073</span></a> So far as marriage is concerned, this
argument is extraordinary considering that Augustine ranked
concupiscence practically above alienation from God, and treated
original sin, resulting from it, as if it were more serious than
actual sin, in so far that while the former can only be washed out by
baptism, the latter can be atoned for by penance.<a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page181"></a>181</span> It is
interesting to notice that Pelagius almost rivalled his great
antagonist Augustine in his praise of virginity. He deduced not
inherited sin, which he denied, but the actual existence of sin from
the snares of the devil and sensual lusts, and condemned concupiscence
accordingly. Pelagius’ associate, Bishop Julian, however, argued that
if the substance of the flesh was good, its desires, which frequently
do not spring from the will, must have been permitted by the Creator;
and he attacked inexorably Augustine’s view that marriage is allowed
although concupiscence is sinful. The case of marriage, which is
unthinkable without sexual desire, convinced Julian that the latter is
in itself indifferent and innocent, while excess follows from a fault
of the will. Christ himself possessed concupiscence.<a

<p>In Scholasticism a clear distinction is drawn between sinful and
innocent concupiscence: the latter is involved in man’s earthly nature
and is kept within appointed limits, as it may be as a result of his
baptism. Duns Scotus, who found no reason to regard the sperm as more
infectious than blood and saliva, also separated the question about
concupiscence, which he regarded as natural, from the question about
original sin.<a name="FnAnchor1076" href="#Footnote1076"><span
class="sp">1076</span></a> Following Augustine, the Catholic Church
declared sexual desire to be sinful, but at the same time accepted
marriage. Before his time, in the earlier part of the fourth century,
the Council of Gangra expressly condemned any one who maintained that
marriage prevented a Christian from entering the kingdom of God;<a
name="FnAnchor1077" href="#Footnote1077"><span
class="sp">1077</span></a> but at the end of the same century a
Council also excommunicated the monk Jovinian because he denied that
virginity is more meritorious than marriage.<a name="FnAnchor1078"
href="#Footnote1078"><span class="sp">1078</span></a> The Church
declared marriage a sacrament. Virginity is ordained to the good of
the soul in the contemplative life, which is to “think of the things
of the Lord”; marriage, on the other hand, is ordained to the good of
the body, the bodily multiplication of the human race, and belongs to
the active life, because husband and wife, living in the married
state, are under necessity to think of “the things of the world.”<a
name="FnAnchor1079" href="#Footnote1079"><span
class="sp">1079</span></a> The Council of Trent condemned any one who
does not regard the unmarried state as better than the married.<a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page182"></a>182</span> Yet the Church
by no means encouraged the adoption of virginity as a general practice
among her members, but on the contrary resolutely declared war on all
attempts to make it a law for everybody. While she distinguished
between a higher and a lower, though sufficient, morality, she
repudiated any claim that the higher morality should be the only
authoritative one. A religion that commanded all alike to renounce the
world would have closed the world against it. She graded her members
as priests, monks, and laity, and assigned to them different standards
of duty.</p>
<p>The earliest form of compulsory celibacy was imposed on persons who
had been married before. The command in the First Epistle to Timothy
(iii. 2, 12) that a bishop and a deacon should be the husband of one
wife was believed, rightly or wrongly, to be prohibitory of second
marriages. But such marriages were in early times looked upon as more
or less discreditable or inadmissible even if contracted by the laity.
Hermas says that if a husband or a wife dies the party which survives
does not sin in marrying again; “howbeit, if he shall remain single,
he shall thereby gain to himself great honour before the Lord.”<a
name="FnAnchor1081" href="#Footnote1081"><span
class="sp">1081</span></a> But if a man puts away an unfaithful wife
and marries another woman, he too commits adultery.<a
name="FnAnchor1082" href="#Footnote1082"><span
class="sp">1082</span></a> According to Justin, divorced persons who
contract new marriages are guilty of the same crime.<a
name="FnAnchor1083" href="#Footnote1083"><span
class="sp">1083</span></a> Athenagoras calls a second marriage a
“decorous adultery,” for Christ says that “whosoever puts away his
wife and marries another commits adultery”; and he who cuts himself
off from his first wife, even though she be dead, is a concealed
adulterer.<a name="FnAnchor1084" href="#Footnote1084"><span
class="sp">1084</span></a> Clement of Alexandria does not pronounce
second marriages positively unlawful, but asserts that a man who
marries again after the decease of his wife falls short of human
perfection.<a name="FnAnchor1085" href="#Footnote1085"><span
class="sp">1085</span></a> Tertullian, referring to the injunction of
the Apostle, argues that what is forbidden to the clergy is not
allowed to the laity: all Christians are really priests, who in case
of need must exercise the functions of the priesthood and consequently
must also live up to its standard of morality.<a name="FnAnchor1086"
href="#Footnote1086"><span class="sp">1086</span></a> And he also
adduces another argument: you have lost your wife, it was therefore
the will of God that you should become a widower; by marrying again
you cease to be a widower, and thereby strive against the will of
God.<a name="FnAnchor1087" href="#Footnote1087"><span
class="sp">1087</span></a> This doctrine was <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page183"></a>183</span> branded by the Church as heretical when it
was elevated into an article of belief by the Montanists; but those
who married a second time were subject to penance. In 484 we find the
Pope Gelasius obliged to remind the faithful that marriages of this
kind are not to be refused to laymen. On the other hand, it became
firmly and irrevocably established that no husband of a second wife
was admissible to holy orders.<a name="FnAnchor1088"
href="#Footnote1088"><span class="sp">1088</span></a> The Council of
Elvira, in 365, which admitted that in cases of extreme necessity a
layman might administer baptism, was careful to specify that he must
not be a “digamus,” or husband of a second wife.<a name="FnAnchor1089"
href="#Footnote1089"><span class="sp">1089</span></a> The restriction
on the priesthood, however, was not easily enforced. Jerome asserts
that the world is full of prelates who evade it, not only in the lower
orders but in the episcopate.<a name="FnAnchor1090"

<p>The rule in question drew for the first time a distinct line of
separation between the great body of the faithful and those who
officiated as ministers of Christ. Shortly afterwards there was a
revival of the Levitical law that required the priesthood to marry
none but virgins.<a name="FnAnchor1091" href="#Footnote1091"><span
class="sp">1091</span></a> The Council of Elvira declared in the most
positive manner that all concerned in the ministry of the altar should
maintain entire abstinence from their wives under pain of forfeiting
their positions;<a name="FnAnchor1092" href="#Footnote1092"><span
class="sp">1092</span></a> but this was simply the legislation of a
local synod in Spain, and its canons were not entitled to respect or
obedience beyond the limits of the churches directly represented. At
the end of the fourth century we find, for the first time, a papal
command imposing perpetual celibacy as an absolute rule of discipline
on the ministers of the altar.<a name="FnAnchor1093"
href="#Footnote1093"><span class="sp">1093</span></a> Energetic
protests were not wanting, nor the more perplexing stubbornness of
passive resistance. The most energetic endeavours to enforce the
celibacy of the clergy were made, in the latter part of the eleventh
century, by Gregory VII., who ordered that no one in future should be
admitted to orders without a vow of celibacy, and authorised the laity
to withdraw their obedience from all prelates and priests who
disregarded this rule. He was resolved that his decree should not
remain, like the decretals of innumerable Councils, a mere protest,
and took immediate measures to have it enforced wherever the authority
of Rome extended.<a name="FnAnchor1094" href="#Footnote1094"><span

<p>In the Eastern Church, where sexual asceticism continued to
flourish as in its birthplace, there is no trace of any official
attempt to render it universally imperative. The East only preserved
the traditions of earlier times, as recorded in the Apostolic
Constitutions and Canons, prohibiting marriage in orders and the
ordination of digami, but imposing no compulsory separation on those
who had been married previous to ordination.<a name="FnAnchor1096"
href="#Footnote1096"><span class="sp">1096</span></a> In these
respects the early traditions of the Greek Church have remained
unaltered to the present day. The lower grades of the clergy are free
to marry, and they are not separated from their wives when promoted to
the sacred functions of the diaconate or priesthood. The bishops,
again, are selected from the regular clergy or monks, and, being bound
by the vow of chastity, are of course unmarried and unable to marry.<a

<p>The Reformation of the sixteenth century rejected the demands for
the celibacy of the clergy. This was due not only to its denial of
merits of any kind, but also to its rejection of the double standard
of moral excellence which was accepted by Catholicism, and of its
different attitude towards asceticism in general and towards sexual
abstinence in particular. Luther appreciated all the lawful enjoyments
of life. “If our Lord God,” he said, “may make excellent large pike
and good Rhenish wine, I may very well venture to eat and to drink.
Thou mayest enjoy every pleasure in the world that is not sinful: that
thy God forbids thee not, but much rather wills it. And it is pleasing
to the dear God whenever thou rejoicest or laughest from the bottom of
your heart.”<a name="FnAnchor1098" href="#Footnote1098"><span
class="sp">1098</span></a> The German Pietism of the seventeenth
century, however, returned to the principles and practices of strict
asceticism in the matters both of fasting and of abstinence from
worldly pleasures and enjoyments; even strolls, games, and laughter
were condemned by the more rigorous section of Pietists. Calvin
attached much importance to a strict ecclesiastical discipline as a
means of holiness.<a name="FnAnchor1099" href="#Footnote1099"><span
class="sp">1099</span></a> This gave birth to the austere holiness of
Scottish Presbyterianism and English Puritanism with their occasional
excesses of harsh casuistry and Sabbatarian gloom. Among the
Evangelicals there was a real distrust of pleasure as pleasure. Sport
was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185"></a>185</span> accepted if
it served a rational purpose, that of recreation necessary for
physical efficacy, but in so far as it became purely a means of
enjoyment, it was strictly condemned. Sexual intercourse was
permitted, even within marriage, only as the means willed by God for
the increase of his glory according to the commandment, “Be fruitful
and multiply.” A moderate vegetable diet and cold baths were remedies
against sexual temptations.<a name="FnAnchor1100"
href="#Footnote1100"><span class="sp">1100</span></a> Children were
kept away from the fire in cold weather; and if flagellation had gone
out of fashion in the monasteries, it was religiously practised in
schools and in the home. We read of a typical Evangelical of the
eighteenth century, John Fletcher of Madeley, who sat up every week
for reading, meditation and prayer, and lived wholly upon vegetarian
food.<a name="FnAnchor1101" href="#Footnote1101"><span
class="sp">1101</span></a> The early Methodist and Baptist sects even
favoured the principle of celibacy. These tendencies to withdrawal
from the world led for the most part to no permanent results. But a
more enduring character belongs to the ascetic efforts of various
branches of British and American Methodism, particularly in the sphere

<p>A common characteristic of all forms of asceticism is that it
involves suffering or privation, and in religious asceticism this is
supposed to be pleasing or gratifying to the deity, or lead to
something having such an effect. From the days of Tertullian and
Cyprian the Latins were familiar with the notion that the Christian
has to propitiate God, that cries of pain, sufferings and deprivations
are means of appeasing his anger, that God takes strict account of the
quantity of the atonement, and that where there is no guilt to be
blotted out those very means are regarded as merits.<a
name="FnAnchor1103" href="#Footnote1103"><span
class="sp">1103</span></a> According to the doctrine of the Church,
penitential asceticism should in all grave cases be preceded by sorrow
for the sin and also by confession, either public or private; but only
too often the notion was adopted that the outward practice itself was
a compensation for sin, that a man was at liberty to do whatever he
pleased provided he was prepared to do penance afterwards, and that a
person who, conscious of his frailty, had laid in a large stock of
vicarious penance in anticipation of future necessity, had a right “to
work it out,” <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186"></a>186</span> and
spend it in sins. How largely ascetic practices are due to the idea of
expiation is indicated by the fact that they scarcely occur among
nations which have no vivid sense of sin like the Chinese before the
introduction of Taoism and Buddhism,<a name="FnAnchor1104"
href="#Footnote1104"><span class="sp">1104</span></a> and the ancient
Greeks, Romans, and Scandinavians. In Greece, however, people
sometimes voluntarily sacrificed a part of their happiness in order to
avoid the envy of the gods, who would not allow to man more than a
moderate share of good fortune. Yet, though fear is a tremendous
incentive to self-mortification, the impulse to expiate and do penance
may also be an immediate and spontaneous expression of self-despair
and devotion. “There are saints,” says William James, “who have
literally fed on the negative principle, on humiliation and privation,
and the thought of suffering and death, their souls growing in
happiness just in proportion as their outward state grew more
intolerable.”<a name="FnAnchor1105" href="#Footnote1105"><span

<p>The most extreme instance of the infliction of suffering as a means
of salvation was the practice of flagellation. In this practice there
was a considerable difference between Eastern and Western Christians.
The former aimed at weeping in their devotional acts, tears being a
sign of contrition, and as self-scourging was thought by them to be an
excellent expedient for obtaining tears, they had frequent recourse to
it for the purpose of bringing them into this saving state. Western
Christians, on the other hand, resorted to flagellation as a direct
and immediate method of compensation for past sins.<a
name="FnAnchor1106" href="#Footnote1106"><span
class="sp">1106</span></a> It came into prominence in Europe in the
eleventh century through the practices of the monk Dominicus Loricatus
and Cardinal Peter Damian. It was advocated as a substitute for the
reading of penitential psalms, a thousand strokes of the lash being
equal to ten psalms; but the most complete course went up to three
million strokes.<a name="FnAnchor1107" href="#Footnote1107"><span
class="sp">1107</span></a> The first serious outbreak of public
flagellation began in Italy just after the middle of the thirteenth
century; and a still more famous gregarious outbreak came about a
hundred years later, and led to the formation of the Brotherhood of
the Flagellants, whose members, stripping to the waist, lashed
themselves with scourges, sometimes knotted and sometimes supplied
with iron points which embedded themselves in the flesh. They believed
that their blood would <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page187"></a>187</span> mingle with the shed blood of Christ, and
that this penitential flagellation, continued for thirty-three days
and a half, would wash the soul free of all taint of sin. Being
voluntary, it was thought to be more meritorious than martyrdom, and
to supply the want of all other good works.<a name="FnAnchor1108"
href="#Footnote1108"><span class="sp">1108</span></a> When the
Flagellants thus felt that the means of salvation were in their own
hands, and that the mediation of the Church and its priesthood could
be dispensed with, the Church launched her anathemas against them, and
on several occasions they were forced to seal their testimonies at the
stake. The mania then took the form of private whipping, and in cells
and rooms they belaboured the sinful flesh with infinite satisfaction.
This was especially the case in Bavaria, which may be termed the
classic land of the scourge.<a name="FnAnchor1109"

<p>Suffering is not only sought as a means of wiping off sins
committed, but is also endured with a view to preventing the
commission of sin. This is another important idea upon which Christian
asceticism rests. The gratification of every worldly desire is sinful,
the flesh should be the abject slave of the spirit intent upon
unearthly things. Man was created for a life in spiritual communion
with God, but yielded to the seduction of evil demons, who availed
themselves of the sensuous side of his nature to draw him away from
the contemplation of the divine and lead him to the earthly. Goodness,
therefore, consists in renouncing all sensuous pleasures, in
separating from the world, in living solely after the spirit, in
imitating the perfection and purity of God, The contrast between good
and evil is the contrast between God and the world, and the conception
of the world includes not only the objects of bodily appetites but all
human institutions. This antithesis of spirit and body, which we have
met with already in Paul, was an old Platonic conception, which the
Fathers of the Church regarded as the contrast between what was
precious and what was to be mortified. In the Neo-Platonic and
Neo-Pythagorean schools of Alexandria, an ascetic ideal of life was
the natural outcome of their theory that God alone is pure and good,
and matter impure and evil. The idea that man ought to liberate
himself from the bondage of earthly desires is the conclusion of a
contemplative mind reflecting upon the short duration and emptiness of
all bodily pleasures and the allurements by which they lead men into
misery and sin. And separation from the material world is the ideal of
the religious enthusiast whose highest aspiration <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page188"></a>188</span> is union with God
conceived as an immaterial being, as pure spirit.</p>
<p>There are yet other ideas at the bottom of particular ascetic
practices. Fasting is frequently adopted as a means of having
supernatural converse, or of acquiring supernatural powers.<a
name="FnAnchor1110" href="#Footnote1110"><span
class="sp">1110</span></a> Chrysostom says that fasting “makes the
soul brighter, and gives it wings to mount up and soar on high.”<a
name="FnAnchor1111" href="#Footnote1111"><span
class="sp">1111</span></a> An idea of this kind partly underlies the
common practice of abstaining from food before or in connection with
the performance of a magical or religious ceremony;<a
name="FnAnchor1112" href="#Footnote1112"><span
class="sp">1112</span></a> but there is also another ground for this
practice. The effect attributed to fasting is not merely psychical,
but it also prevents pollution.<a name="FnAnchor1113"
href="#Footnote1113"><span class="sp">1113</span></a> In Christianity
we meet with it as a rite of purification, when practised before a
religious festival or a religious rite, like prayer or a sacramental
act. In the early Church catechumens were accustomed to fast before
baptism.<a name="FnAnchor1114" href="#Footnote1114"><span
class="sp">1114</span></a> At least as early as the time of Tertullian
it was usual for communicants to prepare themselves by fasting for the
reception of the Eucharist;<a name="FnAnchor1115"
href="#Footnote1115"><span class="sp">1115</span></a> and to this day
Roman Catholicism regards it as unlawful to consecrate or partake of
it after food or drink.<a name="FnAnchor1116"
href="#Footnote1116"><span class="sp">1116</span></a> The Lent fast
itself was partly interpreted as a purifying preparation for the holy
table;<a name="FnAnchor1117" href="#Footnote1117"><span
class="sp">1117</span></a> but its archetype, the fast which lasted
for forty hours only, the time when Christ lay in the grave, belonged
to the very common type of fasting after a death. The mourning fast
may be ascribed to different causes,<a name="FnAnchor1118"
href="#Footnote1118"><span class="sp">1118</span></a> but in this case
it was undoubtedly an expression of sorrow.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is a close connection between fasting and
almsgiving. This was the case among the Jews<a name="FnAnchor1119"
href="#Footnote1119"><span class="sp">1119</span></a> and from <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page189"></a>189</span> Judaism the combination
of fasting and almsgiving passed over into Christianity. We read in
the ‘Shepherd’ of Hermas: “That day on which thou fastest thou shalt
taste nothing at all but bread and water; and computing the quantity
of food which thou art wont to eat upon other days, thou shalt lay
aside the expense which thou shouldst have made that day, and give it
unto the widow, the fatherless, and the poor. And thus thou shalt
perfect the humiliation of thy soul, that he who receives of it may
satisfy his soul, and his prayer come up to the Lord God for thee. If,
therefore, thou shalt thus accomplish thy fast, as I command thee, thy
sacrifice shall be acceptable unto the Lord, and thy fast shall be
written in his book.”<a name="FnAnchor1120" href="#Footnote1120"><span
class="sp">1120</span></a> Aristides writes that if there is among
Christians “a man who is poor or needy, and they have not an abundance
of necessaries, they fast two or three days that they may supply the
needy with their necessary food.”<a name="FnAnchor1121"
href="#Footnote1121"><span class="sp">1121</span></a> According to
Augustine, alms and fasting are the two wings which enable a man’s
prayer to fly upward to God.<a name="FnAnchor1122"
href="#Footnote1122"><span class="sp">1122</span></a> But fasting
without almsgiving “is not so much as counted for fasting”;<a
name="FnAnchor1123" href="#Footnote1123"><span
class="sp">1123</span></a> that which is gained by the fast at dinner
ought not to be turned into a feast at supper, but should be expended
on the bellies of the poor.<a name="FnAnchor1124"
href="#Footnote1124"><span class="sp">1124</span></a> And if a person
is too weak to fast without injuring his health he should give more
plentiful alms.<a name="FnAnchor1125" href="#Footnote1125"><span
class="sp">1125</span></a> Tertullian calls fastings “sacrifices that
are acceptable to God.”<a name="FnAnchor1126"
href="#Footnote1126"><span class="sp">1126</span></a> But fasting, as
well as temperance, has also from early times been advocated by
Christian writers on the ground that it is “the beginning of
chastity,”<a name="FnAnchor1127" href="#Footnote1127"><span
class="sp">1127</span></a> whereas “through love of eating love of
impurity finds passage.”<a name="FnAnchor1128"
href="#Footnote1128"><span class="sp">1128</span></a> Thomas Aquinas
says that fasting serves principally three ends: “First, to repress
the concupiscences of the flesh; hence the Apostle says, ‘In fastings,
in chastity,’ because by fasting chastity is preserved. Secondly, it
is taken up that the mind <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page190"></a>190</span> may be more freely raised to the
contemplation of high things; hence Daniel, after a three weeks’ fast,
received a revelation from God. Thirdly, to satisfy for sin.”<a
name="FnAnchor1129" href="#Footnote1129"><span
class="sp">1129</span></a> That fasting serves the general purpose of
religious asceticism as a means of propitiating God by self-inflicted
suffering is also kept in view by Tertullian when he explains its
necessity as the result of Adam’s fall. He fell by yielding to his
appetite, and from this fact it follows that the sure way for man to
regain the favour of God is to mortify his appetite: Adam offended by
eating, his descendants must remedy the evil consequences of the
offence by fasting.<a name="FnAnchor1130" href="#Footnote1130"><span

<p>So also religious celibacy and abstinence from sexual intercourse
are enjoined or commended as means of self-mortification supposed to
appease an angry god. We find them side by side with other ascetic
observances practised for similar purposes. Among the early Christians
those young women who took a vow of chastity “did not look upon
virginity as any thing if it were not attended with great
mortification, with silence, retirement, poverty, labour, fastings,
watchings, and continual praying. They were not esteemed as virgins
who would not deny themselves the common diversions of the world, even
the most innocent.”<a name="FnAnchor1131" href="#Footnote1131"><span
class="sp">1131</span></a> Tertullian enumerates virginity, widowhood,
and the modest restraint in secret on the marriage-bed among those
fragrant offerings acceptable to God which the flesh performs to its
own especial suffering.<a name="FnAnchor1132"
href="#Footnote1132"><span class="sp">1132</span></a> But sexual
asceticism may be traced to other sources as well.</p>

href="#FnAnchor1131"><sup>1131</sup></a></span> C. Fleury, <i>An

<p>In various religions a priestess is regarded as married to the god
whom she is serving, and is therefore forbidden to have sexual
intercourse with any man. In the Egyptian texts there are frequent
references to “the divine” consort, a position which was generally
held by the ruling queen, and the king was believed to be the
offspring of such a union.<a name="FnAnchor1133"
href="#Footnote1133"><span class="sp">1133</span></a> As Plutarch
states, the Egyptians thought it quite possible for a woman to be
impregnated by the approach of some divine spirit, though they denied
that a man could have corporeal intercourse with a goddess.<a
name="FnAnchor1134" href="#Footnote1134"><span
class="sp">1134</span></a> Nor was the idea of a nuptial relation
between a woman and the deity foreign to the early Christians. Cyprian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191"></a>191</span> speaks of women
who had no husband and lord but Christ, with whom they lived in a
spiritual matrimony&mdash;who had “dedicated themselves to Christ,
and, retiring from carnal lust, vowed themselves to God in flesh and
spirit.”<a name="FnAnchor1135" href="#Footnote1135"><span
class="sp">1135</span></a> In the following words he condemns the
cohabitation of such virgins with unmarried ecclesiastics, under the
pretence of a purely spiritual connection: “If a husband come and see
his wife lying with another man, is he not indignant and maddened, and
does he not in the violence of his jealousy perhaps even seize the
sword? What? How indignant and angered then must Christ our Lord and
Judge be, when he sees a virgin, dedicated to himself, and consecrated
to his holiness, lying with a man! and what punishments does he
threaten against such impure connections. . . . She who has been
guilty of this crime is an adulteress, not against a husband, but
Christ.”<a name="FnAnchor1136" href="#Footnote1136"><span
class="sp">1136</span></a> According to the gospel of Pseudo-Matthew,
the Virgin Mary had in a similar manner dedicated herself as a virgin

<p>An extremely important cause of sexual asceticism is the view that
sexual intercourse is defiling, and that sexual pollution is
particularly injurious to holiness, as also to anybody who comes into
contact with anything holy&mdash;a view the origin of which I have
discussed in an earlier chapter.<a name="FnAnchor1138"
href="#Footnote1138"><span class="sp">1138</span></a> The Christians
prescribed strict continence as a preparation for baptism<a
name="FnAnchor1139" href="#Footnote1139"><span
class="sp">1139</span></a> and the partaking of the Eucharist.<a
name="FnAnchor1140" href="#Footnote1140"><span
class="sp">1140</span></a> They enjoined that no married persons
should participate in any of the great festivals of the Church if the
night before they had lain together;<a name="FnAnchor1141"
href="#Footnote1141"><span class="sp">1141</span></a> and in the
‘Vision’ of Alberic, dating from the twelfth century, a special place
of torture, consisting of a lake of mingled lead, pitch, and resin, is
represented as existing in hell for the punishment of married people
who have had intercourse on Sundays, church <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page192"></a>192</span> festivals, or fast-days.<a
name="FnAnchor1142" href="#Footnote1142"><span
class="sp">1142</span></a> They abstained from the marriage-bed at
other times also, when they were disposed more freely to give
themselves to prayer.<a name="FnAnchor1143" href="#Footnote1143"><span
class="sp">1143</span></a> Newly married couples were admonished to
practice continence during the wedding-day and the night following,
out of reverence for the sacrament; and in some instances their
abstinence lasted even for two or three days.<a name="FnAnchor1144"
href="#Footnote1144"><span class="sp">1144</span></a> The Penitential
of Theodore commands those who contract a first marriage to abstain
from entering a church for thirty days, after which they are to
perform penance for forty more.<a name="FnAnchor1145"
href="#Footnote1145"><span class="sp">1145</span></a> The Syrian
philosopher Jamblichus speaks of the belief that “the gods do not hear
him who invokes them, if he is impure from venereal connections.”<a
name="FnAnchor1146" href="#Footnote1146"><span
class="sp">1146</span></a> A similar notion prevailed among the early
Christians; with reference to a passage in the First Epistle to the
Corinthians (vii. 5), Tertullian remarks that the Apostle added the
recommendation of a temporary abstinence for the sake of adding
efficacy to prayers.<a name="FnAnchor1147" href="#Footnote1147"><span
class="sp">1147</span></a> Carried further, the idea underlying all
these rules and practices led to the notions, that celibacy is more
pleasing to God than marriage and a religious duty for those members
of the community whose special office is to attend to the sacred cult.
For a nation like the Jews, whose ambition was to live and to
multiply, celibacy could never become an ideal; whereas the
Christians, who professed the utmost indifference to all earthly
matters, found no difficulty in glorifying a state which, however
opposed it was to the interests of the race and the nation, made men
pre-eminently fit to approach their god. Indeed, far from being a
benefit to the kingdom of God by propagating the species, sexual
intercourse was on the contrary detrimental to it by being the great
transmitter of the sin of our first parents.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER X</h4>
<h3>THE SACRAMENTS</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">I</span><span class="smcap">N</span> previous chapters we have considered
two different trends of thought as regards the means of procuring
salvation. On the one hand there is the moralistic view that salvation
is the reward of a moral life wrought out essentially by our own
power, and on the other hand there is the belief that it depends upon
divine grace, connected with the faith in Christ as our redeemer
through his death on the cross. In the Catholic Church the two views
were combined by the idea that merits are the gifts of God, while in
Protestantism justification was declared to be due to faith alone and
good works to be merely the fruits of faith. But as a matter of fact,
whatever importance was attached either to merits or to faith, the
doctrine of salvation was at the same time influenced by the belief in
a mystical efficacy of sacraments.</p>
<p>What is a sacrament? It was found easier to describe the particular
rites called by that name than to give a general definition of it.
Augustine made various statements on the notion of the sacrament, but
evolved no harmonious theory on the subject. He says that when “the
Word is added to the element . . . a sacrament is constituted, itself
being, as it were, a visible Word”;<a name="FnAnchor1151"
href="#Footnote1151"><span class="sp">1151</span></a> and in many
passages the sign is described as a figure, although at the same time
it is not an empty <span class="correction" title="amended from sgin">sign</span>. “It is not that which is seen that feeds, but
that which is believed.”<a name="FnAnchor1152"
href="#Footnote1152"><span class="sp">1152</span></a> The gift
conveyed in the Eucharist is a spiritual gift, and the eating and
drinking are a spiritual process.<a name="FnAnchor1153"
href="#Footnote1153"><span class="sp">1153</span></a> That of which we
partake is not the sensual flesh, but of this flesh we receive its
essence, the spirit which quickens it.<a name="FnAnchor1154"
href="#Footnote1154"><span class="sp">1154</span></a> The Schoolmen’s
doctrine of the sacraments has its root in that of Augustine, but goes
beyond it both formally and materially. The “word” disappears behind
the sacramental sign, and the conception becomes still more magical.
The definition of the Lombard, which lies at the foundation of the
later definitions, runs thus: <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page195"></a>195</span> “That is properly called a sacrament which
is a sign of the grace of God, and a form of invisible grace in such a
way that it bears the image thereof and exists as a cause. Sacraments,
therefore, are instituted for the purpose, not merely of signifying,
but also of sanctifying.”<a name="FnAnchor1155"
href="#Footnote1155"><span class="sp">1155</span></a></p>

<p>Thomas Aquinas, however, does not accept without guarding clauses
the statement that the sacrament “exists as a cause.” He says that it
only “in some way” causes grace; that the principal cause of grace is
God, who works as the fire does by its warmth, communicating in grace
his own nature, and that the sacrament is merely an “instrumental
cause,” which acts through the impulse it receives from the principal
agent. Anyhow, “the sacraments of the new law are at the same time
causes and signs, and hence it is commonly said of them that they
effect what they symbolise.”<a name="FnAnchor1156"
href="#Footnote1156"><span class="sp">1156</span></a> But while the
principal cause of grace is God, the humanity of Christ is, so to
speak, a conjoined instrument. Yielding himself up as an offering and
sacrifice to God, he initiated by his passion the ritual of the
Christian religion, “whence it is manifest that the sacraments of the
Church have their efficacy principally from the passion of Christ, of
which the virtue is in some way united to us through receiving the
sacraments, as a sign of which there flowed from Christ as he hung
upon the cross water and blood, of which the one relates to baptism,
the other to the Eucharist, which are the most potent sacraments.”<a
name="FnAnchor1157" href="#Footnote1157"><span
class="sp">1157</span></a> The ultimate end of the sacrament is life
eternal; and a sacrament may thus be defined as “a sign commemorative
of what went before, namely, the passion of Christ, and representative
of what is effected in us by the passion of Christ, namely, grace, and
anticipatory, that is, predictive of future glory.”<a
name="FnAnchor1158" href="#Footnote1158"><span
class="sp">1158</span></a> It must always be a sensible thing, because
it corresponds with the nature of man that he should attain to the
knowledge of intelligible, through sensible things.<a
name="FnAnchor1159" href="#Footnote1159"><span
class="sp">1159</span></a> Though the inner effect of the sacrament,
which is justification, can be produced only by God, a man (the
priest), by way of administering it, becomes an instrumental cause of
that effect.<a name="FnAnchor1160" href="#Footnote1160"><span
class="sp">1160</span></a> Whether he is good or bad does not come
into account here, since “the instrument does not work by its own form
of virtue, but by the virtue of him by whom it is moved.”<a
name="FnAnchor1161" href="#Footnote1161"><span
class="sp">1161</span></a> Bad servants commit a mortal sin when they
celebrate the sacraments, but the sin does not extend to the receiver,
“who <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196"></a>196</span> does not
communicate with the sin of the bad minister, but with the Church.”<a

<p>The doctrine of Thomas underwent afterwards considerable
modification from the time of Duns Scotus onwards&mdash;although
Scotus himself, in spite of his criticism, does not stand very far
from him in his doctrine of the sacraments,<a name="FnAnchor1163"
href="#Footnote1163"><span class="sp">1163</span></a>&mdash;but became
finally dominant. This is noticeable in what the Council of Trent has
to say on the subject. In the prologue to the decree of Session vii,
it declares that “by means of the sacraments all true righteousness
either begins or, having been begun, is increased or, having been
lost, is restored.” As in the doctrine of Aquinas, a regard to faith
is lacking, and this silence is the more significant since it shows
that just the sacrament itself as externally applied is held to be the
means of salvation. In the canons, anathema is pronounced on those who
assert that man can be justified before God without the sacraments by
faith alone;<a name="FnAnchor1164" href="#Footnote1164"><span
class="sp">1164</span></a> on those who teach that the sacraments are
instituted for the sake of only nourishing faith;<a
name="FnAnchor1165" href="#Footnote1165"><span
class="sp">1165</span></a> on those who say that “grace is not
conveyed <i>ex opere operato</i> by the sacraments of the new law, but
that faith alone in the divine promise is sufficient for obtaining
grace.”<a name="FnAnchor1166" href="#Footnote1166"><span
class="sp">1166</span></a> If the negative definitions which the
Council adopted in these and other statements are translated into a
positive form, they come close to Thomism. They are really protests
against Protestantism.</p>

<p>Luther insisted that the sacraments do not become efficacious in
their being celebrated, but in their being believed in. He maintained
that both baptism and the Eucharist, which were the only sacraments
recognised by him, work forgiveness of sin and thereby procure life
and blessedness, but not without faith. He says that in baptism “this
is not done certainly by the water, but by the Word of God, which is
with and beside the water, and by the faith which trusts in such Word
of God in the water”;<a name="FnAnchor1167" href="#Footnote1167"><span
class="sp">1167</span></a> and so also the eating of the bread and the
drinking of the wine in the Eucharist must be combined with faith in
the Word in order to produce forgiveness of sins, for only then it can
be said with truth, “This bread is my body, this wine is my blood.”<a
name="FnAnchor1168" href="#Footnote1168"><span
class="sp">1168</span></a> According to Zwingli, on the other hand,
“all sacraments are so far from conferring grace that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page197"></a>197</span> they do not even bring
or dispense it. . . . Sacraments are given for a public testimony of
that grace which is previously present to each individual. . . . A
sacrament is a sign of a sacred thing, that is, of grace which has
been given.”<a name="FnAnchor1169" href="#Footnote1169"><span
class="sp">1169</span></a> Calvin again, tried to steer a middle
course between the theories of Luther and Zwingli. He defined a
sacrament as “an external sign, by which the Lord seals to our
consciences his promises of goodwill towards us, in order to sustain
the weakness of our faith, and we in our turn testify our piety
towards him, both before himself and before angels as well as men.”<a
name="FnAnchor1170" href="#Footnote1170"><span
class="sp">1170</span></a> But was not the sacrament then a
superfluity, since the true will of God was sufficiently known through
the Word, and the sacrament could make us no wiser? Calvin makes the
reply: “Sacraments bring with them the clearest promises, and, when
compared with the Word, have this peculiarity that they represent
promises to the life, as if painted in a picture.” They are like seals
which are affixed to diplomas and other public deeds, which “are
nothing considered in themselves, and would be affixed to no purpose
if nothing were written on the parchment, and yet this does not
prevent them from sealing and confirming when they are appended to
writing.”<a name="FnAnchor1171" href="#Footnote1171"><span

<p>The doctrine of the sacraments was developed under the disadvantage
of not knowing for certain to what sacred acts the general conceptions
were to be applied. As to their number the greatest vacillation
prevailed for centuries. Still, theology had already wrought for long
with the number seven, before this number was officially recognised by
the Church,<a name="FnAnchor1172" href="#Footnote1172"><span
class="sp">1172</span></a> which happened in 1439.<a
name="FnAnchor1173" href="#Footnote1173"><span
class="sp">1173</span></a> The only sacred acts in a pre-eminent
sense, which had been handed down from ecclesiastical antiquity were
baptism and the Eucharist.</p>

<p>Baptism was regarded as the bath of regeneration, by which the sins
of the past were blotted out. Speaking of “the repentance of baptism,”
Hermas says that when we go down into the water we receive the
forgiveness of our sins; we “go down under the obligation unto death,

‘Didache,’ the pronouncing of the name of Father and Son and the Holy
Spirit is essential, but if immersion is not practicable water may be
poured upon the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198"></a>198</span>
head thrice.<a name="FnAnchor1175" href="#Footnote1175"><span
class="sp">1175</span></a> Personal faith was looked upon as a
necessary condition.<a name="FnAnchor1176" href="#Footnote1176"><span
class="sp">1176</span></a> Tertullian argues that baptism, in order to
be effectual to the pardon of sin, presupposes a renunciation of all
sinful habits on the part of him who is to receive it; men are
admitted to baptism because they have repented and reformed their
lives, not in order that they may afterwards repent and reform.<a
name="FnAnchor1177" href="#Footnote1177"><span
class="sp">1177</span></a> The converts from heathenism went through a
course of instruction in the principles and doctrines of the gospel,
and were subjected to a strict probation before they were admitted to
the rite of baptism. Tertullian says that this rite must not be
hastily conferred; and recommends delay in the case not only of
infants but also of unmarried persons and widows, whom he considers
particularly exposed to temptation.<a name="FnAnchor1178"
href="#Footnote1178"><span class="sp">1178</span></a> He and the
Christians of his day were impressed by the belief that the external
rite was absolutely necessary to salvation, and thought it better that
it should be performed by a layman than that it should not be
performed at all. But although he maintains that the laity possess the
right to administer baptism in case of necessity, he does not extend
this right to women, and stigmatises the attempt on their part to
baptise as a most flagrant act of presumption.<a name="FnAnchor1179"

<p>Augustine considers likewise baptism indispensable for salvation.
Its necessity rests on the “stamp,” and it cannot be rendered invalid
by sin or heresy;<a name="FnAnchor1180" href="#Footnote1180"><span
class="sp">1180</span></a> it may even cause a momentary forgiveness
of sin in the case of heretics.<a name="FnAnchor1181"
href="#Footnote1181"><span class="sp">1181</span></a> But the
importance of the Catholic Church is strictly guarded. Baptism is set
in the foreground as the grand mystery in the cross of Christ, for
according to Paul it is nothing but the similitude of Christ’s death;
but the death of Christ crucified is nothing but the remission of sin,
that as in him a true death took place, so in us a true remission of
sins.<a name="FnAnchor1182" href="#Footnote1182"><span
class="sp">1182</span></a> Thomas Aquinas asserts that while generally
the sacraments as a whole are necessary to salvation, this applies
specifically, in the strictest sense, to baptism.<a
name="FnAnchor1183" href="#Footnote1183"><span
class="sp">1183</span></a> It is the medicine for the consequences of
the Fall, and lays the basis of the new life. It has thus both a
negative and a positive effect. It abolishes the guilt both of
original <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199"></a>199</span> sin and
of the previously committed sinful deeds without exception.<a
name="FnAnchor1184" href="#Footnote1184"><span
class="sp">1184</span></a> The penalty is thereby remitted, and the
disorder of the passions is rectified, so that man is now capable of
resisting or keeping within appointed limits the concupiscence which
is involved in his earthly nature.<a name="FnAnchor1185"
href="#Footnote1185"><span class="sp">1185</span></a> The positive
effect of baptism is summed up in the term “regeneration.”<a
name="FnAnchor1186" href="#Footnote1186"><span
class="sp">1186</span></a> Baptism cannot be repeated.<a
name="FnAnchor1187" href="#Footnote1187"><span
class="sp">1187</span></a> It is valid when it is performed with water
and with the words of institution, and is regularly dispensed by the
priest. Yet in an emergency a deacon,<a name="FnAnchor1188"
href="#Footnote1188"><span class="sp">1188</span></a> and even a
layman, nay a woman, can baptise.<a name="FnAnchor1189"
href="#Footnote1189"><span class="sp">1189</span></a> The Council of
Trent only systematised the earlier doctrine and practice of
baptism,<a name="FnAnchor1190" href="#Footnote1190"><span
class="sp">1190</span></a> which, in fact, had not essentially altered
in the Church since the middle of the second century. In the
‘Confession of Augsburg’ the Lutherans asserted the absolute necessity
of baptism quite as emphatically as the Tridentine theologians.<a
name="FnAnchor1191" href="#Footnote1191"><span
class="sp">1191</span></a> The Anglican Article XXVII. speaks of
baptism as a sign of regeneration “whereby, as by an instrument, they
that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church,” the
promises of the forgiveness of sin being visibly signed and sealed.
The Archbishops’ Commission on Doctrine in the Church of England
admits that the baptism of infants cannot clean from actual sin, since
no such sin has been committed, but maintains that it “is a means of
deliverance from the domination of influences which predispose to
sin.”<a name="FnAnchor1192" href="#Footnote1192"><span

<p>Infant baptism is a subject of great, though melancholy, interest.
We have no testimony regarding it from an earlier time than that of
Irenæus<a name="FnAnchor1193" href="#Footnote1193"><span
class="sp">1193</span></a> and Tertullian, but then it had already
become quite general. Tertullian alludes to the custom of having
sponsors, who made, in the name of the children brought to the font,
those promises which they were unable to make for themselves. He
thinks, however, that it is more advantageous to delay baptism till
the children are growing up and are able to know Christ; “for why is
it necessary for the sponsors also to be thrust into danger?”<a
name="FnAnchor1194" href="#Footnote1194"><span
class="sp">1194</span></a> Augustine, on the other hand, regarded
infant baptism as indispensable: even the youngest children who have
done nothing sinful pass justly into damnation if they die unbaptised,
because they possess <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page200"></a>200</span> original sin and are burdened with
concupiscence. He admitted, however, that the punishment of such
children was of the mildest sort.<a name="FnAnchor1195"
href="#Footnote1195"><span class="sp">1195</span></a> Other writers
were more severe; Fulgentius condemned to “everlasting punishment in
eternal fire” even infants who died in their mother’s womb.<a
name="FnAnchor1196" href="#Footnote1196"><span
class="sp">1196</span></a> But the notion that unbaptised children
will be tormented gave gradually way to a more humane opinion. In the
middle of the twelfth century Peter Lombard determined that the proper
punishment of original sin, when no actual sin is added to it, is loss
of heaven and the sight of God, but not positive torment.<a
name="FnAnchor1197" href="#Footnote1197"><span
class="sp">1197</span></a> This doctrine was confirmed by Innocentius
III. and shared by the whole troop of the Schoolmen, who assumed the
existence of a place called <i>limbus</i> or <i>infernus puerorum</i>,
where unbaptised infants will dwell without being subject to
torture.<a name="FnAnchor1198" href="#Footnote1198"><span
class="sp">1198</span></a> But the older view was again set up by the
Protestants, who generally maintained that the due punishment of
original sin is, in strictness, damnation in hell, although many of
them were inclined to think that if a child dies by misfortune before
it is baptised, the parents’ sincere intention of baptising it,
together with their prayers, will be accepted with God for the deed.<a
name="FnAnchor1199" href="#Footnote1199"><span
class="sp">1199</span></a> Luther, who declared that baptism is
useless in the absence of faith,<a name="FnAnchor1200"
href="#Footnote1200"><span class="sp">1200</span></a> nevertheless
retained infant baptism not only as a symbol, but as an efficacious
act.<a name="FnAnchor1201" href="#Footnote1201"><span
class="sp">1201</span></a> The Confession of Augsburg emphatically
condemns the doctrine of the Anabaptists that God would not damn a
little child for a drop of water.<a name="FnAnchor1202"
href="#Footnote1202"><span class="sp">1202</span></a> Zwingli regarded
the salvation of the unbaptised children of Christians as certain, and
hoped apparently for the salvation of all other infants as well.<a
name="FnAnchor1203" href="#Footnote1203"><span
class="sp">1203</span></a> But the damnation of infants who died
unbaptised was an acknowledged belief of Calvinism,<a
name="FnAnchor1204" href="#Footnote1204"><span
class="sp">1204</span></a> although an exception was made for the
children of pious parents, provided “there is neither sloth, nor
contempt, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201"></a>201</span> nor
negligence.”<a name="FnAnchor1205" href="#Footnote1205"><span
class="sp">1205</span></a> Yet in the latter part of the eighteenth
century Toplady, who was a violent Calvinist, avowed his belief in the
universal salvation of all departed infants, whether baptised or
unbaptised;<a name="FnAnchor1206" href="#Footnote1206"><span
class="sp">1206</span></a> and a hundred years later Dr. Hodge thought
he was justified in stating that the common belief of evangelical
Protestants was that all who die in infancy are saved.<a
name="FnAnchor1207" href="#Footnote1207"><span
class="sp">1207</span></a> The accuracy of this statement, however,
seems somewhat doubtful. In 1888 Mr. Prentiss wrote of the doctrine of
infant salvation independently of baptism: “My own impression is that,
had it been taught as unequivocally in the Presbyterian Church even a
third of a century ago by a theologian less eminent than Dr. Hodge for
orthodoxy, piety, and weight of character, it would have called forth
an immediate protest from some of the more conservative, old-fashioned
Calvinists.”<a name="FnAnchor1208" href="#Footnote1208"><span

<p>Like the sacrament of baptism, the Eucharist also evidently owes
its sacramental character to Paul. He looked upon it as a mystical
re-enactment of the death and resurrection of Christ through which the
believer participates in his immortality, the bread and wine being an
incarnation of his body and blood. A similar conception is found in
the Gospel of John, where the following words are put into the mouth
of Jesus: “Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal
life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat
indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and
drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.”<a
name="FnAnchor1209" href="#Footnote1209"><span
class="sp">1209</span></a> In this respect there was a great
resemblance between the teaching of Paul and John and certain mystic
saviour cults in the Græco-Roman world, in which the believer shares
in and is assimilated to a divine being who dies and is reborn to
immortal life.<a name="FnAnchor1210" href="#Footnote1210"><span
class="sp">1210</span></a> In the case of Pauline Christianity the
breaking of bread and the drinking of wine, as well as baptism, were
efficacious sacraments, as the instruments of an intimate union with
Christ through faith, but they were not sufficient for salvation.</p>

<p>The Lord’s Supper soon became the central point both for the
worship of the Church and for its very life as a Church, the common
meal being a fitting expression of the brotherly unity <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page202"></a>202</span> of the community.<a
name="FnAnchor1211" href="#Footnote1211"><span
class="sp">1211</span></a> It is said in the ‘Didache’: “On the Lord’s
day do ye assemble and break bread, and give thanks, after confessing
your transgressions, in order that your sacrifice may be pure. But
every one that hath controversy with his friend, let him not come
together with you, until they be reconciled, that your sacrifice may
not be profaned.”<a name="FnAnchor1212" href="#Footnote1212"><span
class="sp">1212</span></a> Agapes, or love-feasts, were held in
connection with the Supper, and the bread and wine for the holy
celebration were taken out of the payments in kind that were necessary
for them. The presentation of the elements for the holy ordinance was
also extended to the offering of gifts for the poor brethren.<a
name="FnAnchor1213" href="#Footnote1213"><span
class="sp">1213</span></a> The wealthy and the willing, for every one

<p>But in the first place the Lord’s Supper was a blessing to the
individual who partook of it. Ignatius calls the breaking of bread
“the medicine of immortality, our antidote that we should not die, but
live for ever in Christ Jesus.”<a name="FnAnchor1215"
href="#Footnote1215"><span class="sp">1215</span></a> As to the
connection between the elements and the body and blood of Christ, he
seems to have expressed himself in a strictly realistic way in several
passages,<a name="FnAnchor1216" href="#Footnote1216"><span
class="sp">1216</span></a> but in others he gives evidence of a very
different conception, as when he equates the flesh of the Lord
partaken of at the Supper with faith and the blood with love,<a
name="FnAnchor1217" href="#Footnote1217"><span
class="sp">1217</span></a> or when he calls the blood “incorruptible
love”<a name="FnAnchor1218" href="#Footnote1218"><span
class="sp">1218</span></a> and the gospel “the flesh of Christ.”<a
name="FnAnchor1219" href="#Footnote1219"><span
class="sp">1219</span></a> Justin, on the other hand, presupposed the
identity, miraculously produced by the Logos, of the consecrated bread
and the body he had assumed; in this we have undoubtedly to recognise
an influence of pagan mysteries where “bread and a cup of water, with
a certain form of words” were made use of as an initiation ceremony,
according to Justin at the instigation of evil spirits.<a
name="FnAnchor1220" href="#Footnote1220"><span
class="sp">1220</span></a> Tertullian says that owing to the devil the
consecration of the bread in the Eucharist was imitated in the
mysteries of Mithra.<a name="FnAnchor1221" href="#Footnote1221"><span
class="sp">1221</span></a> Harnack observes that “there was plainly a
remodelling of the ritual in imitation of the ancient mysteries and of
the heathen sacrificial system,” and that this fact is admitted by
Protestant scholars of all <span class="pagenum"><a

href="#Footnote1222"><span class="sp">1222</span></a> But the doctrine
in question is essentially that of Paul, and there is no reason to
suppose that the pagan influence was only of a later date.</p>

<p>Clement and Origen, like Ignatius, assign a spiritual significance
to the flesh and blood of Christ. According to the former, “there is a
twofold blood of the Lord: the one carnal, by which we are redeemed
from corruption, the other spiritual, by which we are anointed,”<a
name="FnAnchor1223" href="#Footnote1223"><span
class="sp">1223</span></a> “His notion,” says Bishop Kaye, “seems to
have been that by partaking of the bread and wine in the Eucharist,
the soul of the believer is united to the Spirit, and that by this
union the principle of immortality is imparted to the flesh.”<a
name="FnAnchor1224" href="#Footnote1224"><span
class="sp">1224</span></a> In Origen’s view the eucharistic body is
only the word of God or of Logos as being a substitute for his
appearance in the flesh; whenever he speaks of the Supper, or in a
more general sense of eating of the flesh or of the drinking of the
blood of Christ, he does this without any reference to the body which
he had as a man or to the blood which flowed in the veins of this
body.<a name="FnAnchor1225" href="#Footnote1225"><span
class="sp">1225</span></a> But Origen’s disciple Gregory of Nyssa
maintained that the actual body of Christ as immortal is the only
remedy against death, and that it therefore must be partaken of bodily
in the Supper; through the act of consecration the bread and wine are
changed into the flesh and blood of the Lord in order that by
partaking of them our body may be transformed into the body of
Christ.<a name="FnAnchor1226" href="#Footnote1226"><span
class="sp">1226</span></a> Chrysostom agreed with Gregory in the
assumption of an essentially corporeal effect of the participation,
and speaks like him of a refashioning and transforming of the elements
which Christ effects through the priest by means of the invocation. He
says that Christ, in proof of his love, has given us his body pierced
with nails, “that we might hold it in our hands and eat it; for we
often bite those whom we love much.”<a name="FnAnchor1227"
href="#Footnote1227"><span class="sp">1227</span></a> The classical
doctrine of the Lord’s Supper in the Greek Church up to the present
day is that of John of Damascus, who perfected the conception of the
identity of the eucharistic and the real body of Christ. By <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page204"></a>204</span> the Holy Ghost bread
and wine are received into the body of Christ. The eucharistic body is
that which was born of the virgin, not, however, by a
transubstantiation, as if the body of Christ descended suddenly from
heaven and took the place of the elements, but by a transformation and
assumption, just as in the incarnation. The bread-body is received
into the real body and is thus identical with it.<a

<p>Roman Catholic writers are desirous to allege Tertullian’s
authority in support of the doctrine of transubstantiation. He speaks
indeed of “the feeding on the fatness of the Lord’s body, that is, on
the Eucharist,”<a name="FnAnchor1229" href="#Footnote1229"><span
class="sp">1229</span></a> and of “our flesh being fed on the body and
blood of Christ, in order that our soul may be sated with God.”<a
name="FnAnchor1230" href="#Footnote1230"><span
class="sp">1230</span></a> But when compared with other passages in
his writings these appear to have been used in a figurative sense.<a
name="FnAnchor1231" href="#Footnote1231"><span
class="sp">1231</span></a> And in other places he expressly calls the
bread only the representation of the body of Christ.<a
name="FnAnchor1232" href="#Footnote1232"><span
class="sp">1232</span></a> So also Augustine resists the realistic
interpretation of the Supper.<a name="FnAnchor1233"
href="#Footnote1233"><span class="sp">1233</span></a> But towards the
end of the period of Louis the Pious, Paschasius Radbertus asserted as
doctrine what had been felt by the majority, that the real historical
body of Christ is sacrificed in the Mass and partaken of in the Lord’s
Supper.<a name="FnAnchor1234" href="#Footnote1234"><span
class="sp">1234</span></a> At the beginning of the thirteenth century
the doctrine of transubstantiation was practically settled by the
Lateran Council of 1215. The words run: “There is one universal Church
of the faithful, outside of which no one whatever can be saved, in
which Jesus Christ is at once priest and sacrifice, whose body and
blood are truly contained in the sacrifice of the altar under the
appearances of bread and wine, the bread being transubstantiated into
the body, and the wine into the blood by divine power, so that for the
effecting of the mystery of unity we receive of his what he received
of ours. And this sacrament especially no one can administer but the
priest who has been duly ordained according to the Church authority
which Jesus Christ himself gave to the Apostles and their
successors.”<a name="FnAnchor1235" href="#Footnote1235"><span
class="sp">1235</span></a> The conception of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page205"></a>205</span> Eucharist as a
sacrifice is already found in the early Church;<a name="FnAnchor1236"
href="#Footnote1236"><span class="sp">1236</span></a> and Cyprian’s
statement that every celebration of the Lord’s Supper is a repetition
or imitation of Christ’s sacrifice of himself, and therefore has an
expiatory value, still continues to be repeated by the Romish Church
to the present day.<a name="FnAnchor1237" href="#Footnote1237"><span
class="sp">1237</span></a> While Greek Catholicism interpreted the
Eucharist as the mystery whereby life eternal was mediated to the
faithful, the Eucharist of Latin Catholicism centred more upon the
sacrifice, forgiveness rather than immortality being mediated by it.<a

<p>Thomas Aquinas, who gives a systematic exposition of the notion of
transubstantiation,<a name="FnAnchor1239" href="#Footnote1239"><span
class="sp">1239</span></a> says of the effects of the Eucharist that
it conveys grace, gives aid for eternal life, blots out venial sins
but not mortal sins, guards against future transgressions, and as a
sacrifice profits the spectators also, although it as a sacrament
profits only the receiver.<a name="FnAnchor1240"
href="#Footnote1240"><span class="sp">1240</span></a> Although in
strict theory comparatively slight results were attributed to the
Eucharist as a sacrifice, the people looked upon it as much more
important than the sacrament, which formed the central part of divine
service. And the dignity of the priest came most distinctly to view
when he in the Mass appeared as priest of the body of Christ and in a
very real sense as the mediator between God and men. But the doctrine
of transubstantiation increased the dignity of the priest also in his
capacity of administering the sacrament because, in order that the
wine might not be spilt and the sacrament thereby profaned, it was
considered safer that the layman should receive it only in the form of
the bread, while the priest drank the cup in the name of all.<a
name="FnAnchor1241" href="#Footnote1241"><span
class="sp">1241</span></a> In defiance of history, the Council of
Trent alleged that the doctrine of transubstantiation had always
prevailed in the Church.<a name="FnAnchor1242"

<p>Luther rejected the Scholastic doctrine of transubstantiation on
the grounds that it lacks support in revelation and is not the most
reasonable way of asserting the presence of the real flesh and blood
of Christ; but he does not claim that all others also should reject
it. His own opinion is that in the consecrated sacrament the
substances of the bread and wine remain, although the real flesh and
blood of Christ are there also. Why should not Christ be able to
include his body within the substance of the bread as well as within
the accidents? “In the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page206"></a>206</span> sacrament it is not necessary to the
presence of the real body and real blood that the bread and wine
should be transubstantiated, so that Christ may be contained beneath
the accidents; but while both bread and wine continue there, it can be
said with truth, ‘This bread is my body, this wine is my blood,’ and
conversely.”<a name="FnAnchor1243" href="#Footnote1243"><span
class="sp">1243</span></a> When Melanchthon went to hold conferences
with Butzer, Luther could give him the instruction, that “in and with
the bread the body of Christ is truly partaken of, that accordingly
all that takes place actively and passively in the bread takes place
actively and passively in the body of Christ, that the latter is
distributed, eaten and masticated with the teeth.”<a
name="FnAnchor1244" href="#Footnote1244"><span
class="sp">1244</span></a> Brenz, who after Luther’s death was among
the most active opponents of union with the Reformed theologians, asks
what would be the consequence if, by any accident, the consecrated
bread were eaten by a mouse. He decides that the mouse would have
eaten the true body of Christ.<a name="FnAnchor1245"

<p>Zwingli allowed only a symbolical explanation of the body and blood
of Christ in the sacrament. Calvin, again, stood between Zwingli and
Luther: the body of Christ is not now present on earth anywhere as
substance, but it is present as power, and in the Eucharist it is so
to our benefit.<a name="FnAnchor1246" href="#Footnote1246"><span
class="sp">1246</span></a> The Socinians expressly rejected the
Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinistic doctrines of the Supper, and
attempted to restore to the Eucharist its original meaning. The
Racovian Catechism of 1609, in which their doctrines are set forth in
detail, says that “it is an institution of the Lord Christ, that
believers in him should break and eat bread and drink of a cup
together, with the view of commemorating him, or showing forth his
death.” He is said to have instituted that rite because he wished the
remembrance of this to be above all other things celebrated in the
Church; for of all the actions which he undertook with a view to our
salvation, his death was the most difficult and exhibited the
strongest proof of his love towards us.<a name="FnAnchor1247"

<p>The sacraments of baptism and the Eucharist are rooted in magical
ideas, and the efficacy ascribed to them has always retained a more or
less magical character. In the Report of the Archbishops’ Commission
on Doctrine in the Church of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page207"></a>207</span> England it is said that there is “at once
a sharp distinction of Sacraments from magic. In magic the use of the
formula is held to enable the wizard to control powers other than
human. Belief in the efficacy of Sacraments is rooted in faith in the
revealed will of God to bestow gifts of grace through certain
appointed signs.”<a name="FnAnchor1248" href="#Footnote1248"><span
class="sp">1248</span></a> But then, how is it that the appointed
signs are so similar to certain pagan rites with which Christianity
had come into contact, and which certainly contained a lot of magic?
Wizards are not necessary for the performance of magical acts. In
magic man simply makes use of supernatural means which act
mechanically. Eusebius tells the story of a sick old man who was
longing to die, and whose wish was fulfilled by a few drops from a
moistened piece of Eucharistic bread being dropped into his mouth.<a
name="FnAnchor1249" href="#Footnote1249"><span
class="sp">1249</span></a> But in the case of the Eucharist there
really is a wizard who administers it, or what else shall I call the
priest who, according to the main tradition of the Church, has to
celebrate the rite in order to make it valid?<a name="FnAnchor1250"
href="#Footnote1250"><span class="sp">1250</span></a> Is he not
supposed to possess some quality capable of bringing about a
supernatural effect which other persons lack? The bishop of
Birmingham, who was not a member of the Commission, writes that the
modern world rejects as an absurdity such priestly pretensions as this
that any priest could associate the spiritual presence of Christ with
the consecrated elements of bread and wine.<a name="FnAnchor1251"

<p>For the saving effect attributed to baptism and the Eucharist there
is no moral justification. A righteous God does not forgive a sinner
unless he repents, and if he repents he is forgiven without any
external rite. Repentance is not much spoken of in connection with
those sacraments. In the case of baptism it was formerly expected of
converts. In Tertullian’s time the teachers who undertook to prepare
the catechumens for reception at the baptismal font insisted on the
necessity of repentance and amendment of life.<a name="FnAnchor1252"
href="#Footnote1252"><span class="sp">1252</span></a> But he tells us
that when the proselyte heard that baptism conferred upon him who
received it the remission of all his former sins, he persuaded himself
that he might with safety defer the work of repentance, and passed the
time allotted for his probation in a more unrestrained enjoyment of
those worldly and sensual pleasures <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page208"></a>208</span> in which he knew that after baptism he
could not indulge without forfeiting his hopes of eternal happiness.
So general had this practice become that Tertullian devotes a
considerable portion of the tract <i>De pœnitentia</i> to the exposure
of its wickedness.<a name="FnAnchor1253" href="#Footnote1253"><span
class="sp">1253</span></a> When infant baptism was introduced
repentance ceased of course even nominally to be required of him who
was going to be baptised.</p>

<p>While baptism blots out the sins of the past, the Roman Catholic
Church has another sacrament for the remission of sins committed
afterwards, that of penance, which became practically the most
important means of grace. Certain statements of Jesus<a
name="FnAnchor1254" href="#Footnote1254"><span
class="sp">1254</span></a> left no doubt as to the general power
vested in the Church to forgive all manner of sins; such is the belief
reasserted in the decree <i>Lamentabili</i> of 3rd July 1907. In the
earliest times it was held by the Christian Church that after baptism,
while lighter sins needed only to be confessed to the gracious God,<a
name="FnAnchor1255" href="#Footnote1255"><span
class="sp">1255</span></a> serious sins excluded the offender
altogether from the community.<a name="FnAnchor1256"
href="#Footnote1256"><span class="sp">1256</span></a> But this
rigorous practice was soon broken through, and by a public confession
of sins even gross sinners were allowed restoration, though at first
not more than once. Hermas gives assurances of forgiveness for all
sins except blasphemy against the Lord and betrayal of the brethren;
but “to the servants of God there is but one repentance”<a
name="FnAnchor1257" href="#Footnote1257"><span
class="sp">1257</span></a>&mdash;a restriction which later writers
apply to public penance only.<a name="FnAnchor1258"
href="#Footnote1258"><span class="sp">1258</span></a> Tertullian
treats as a fixed regulation a custom established in the course of the
latter half of the second century, according to which a baptised
person in the case of a first relapse might be restored to the favour
of God and of the Church by making a public confession of his guilt.
It was not sufficient that the offender felt the deepest remorse: he
was required to express his contrition by some public acts which
consisted in various external marks of humility. The penitent was
clothed in the meanest apparel; he lay in sack-cloth and ashes; he
either fasted entirely or lived upon bread and water; he passed whole
days and nights in tears and lamentations, he embraced the knees of
the presbyters as they entered the church, and entreated the brethren
to intercede by their prayers in his behalf. In this state of
degradation and exclusion from the communion of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page209"></a>209</span> faithful he remained a
longer or a shorter period, according to the magnitude of his offence;
and when that period was expired the bishop publicly pronounced his
absolution, by which he was restored to the favour of God and to the
communion of the Church.<a name="FnAnchor1259"
href="#Footnote1259"><span class="sp">1259</span></a> The benefits of
this penance could be obtained only once.<a name="FnAnchor1260"
href="#Footnote1260"><span class="sp">1260</span></a> But although a
penitent who relapsed could not be reconciled to the Church in this
world, Tertullian does not exclude him from all hope of pardon in the
next. He expressly distinguishes between remission of sins by the
Church and by God; and affirms that the sincere penitent, though he
may not by his tears and lamentations obtain readmission into the
Church, may yet secure his reception into the kingdom of heaven.<a
name="FnAnchor1261" href="#Footnote1261"><span
class="sp">1261</span></a> In the tract <i>De pœnitentia</i> he spoke
as if all crimes committed after baptism might once, though only once,
be pardoned upon repentance.<a name="FnAnchor1262"
href="#Footnote1262"><span class="sp">1262</span></a> But in the tract
<i>De pudicitia</i>, which was written after he became a Montanist, we
find him drawing a distinction between greater and less offences,
between those which could not and those which could be pardoned by the
Church.<a name="FnAnchor1263" href="#Footnote1263"><span
class="sp">1263</span></a> Among the venial sins he classes such as
being angry without a cause and allowing the sun to go down upon our
wrath, acts of violence, evil-speaking, rash swearing, non-performance
of contracts, and white lies; and among the heinous sins, homicide,
idolatry, fraud, denial of Christ, blasphemy, adultery, fornication,<a
name="FnAnchor1264" href="#Footnote1264"><span
class="sp">1264</span></a> and even second marriages.<a
name="FnAnchor1265" href="#Footnote1265"><span
class="sp">1265</span></a> Of these he says that there is no
remission, and that even Christ will not intercede for those who
commit them. <i>De pudicitia</i> was directed against an edict, issued
by Pope Calixtus, which allowed adulterers and fornicators to be
readmitted to the communion of the Church if they had done penance. In
another tract Tertullian maintained that the stain of mortal sin after
baptism could only be washed away by martyrdom, by the baptism of the
sinner in his own blood.<a name="FnAnchor1266"
href="#Footnote1266"><span class="sp">1266</span></a> The milder
practice with regard to the sins of the flesh prevailed, and in the
latter part of the third century certain concessions were allowed in
the case of relapse into idolatry. Moreover, the assumption that there
can be only one repentance after baptism became untenable.<a

<p>An important change was that private confession in the presence of
the priest became the rule. This state of matters <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page210"></a>210</span> began in the
Iro-Scottish Church, where penitential regulations were drawn up for
the laity, who were directed to confess their sins to the priest, as
the monks had long been enjoined to do in their cloisters. From
Ireland books dealing with penance came to the Anglo-Saxons and Franks
and to Rome.<a name="FnAnchor1268" href="#Footnote1268"><span
class="sp">1268</span></a> The Fourth Lateran Council definitely laid
down the rule that “every believer of either sex, after arriving at
the years of discretion, must by himself faithfully confess all his
sins at least once a year to his own priest, and must study to carry
out to the best of his ability the repentance enjoined upon him.”<a
name="FnAnchor1269" href="#Footnote1269"><span
class="sp">1269</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote1268"></a><a

href="#FnAnchor1269"><sup>1269</sup></a></span> Mansi, xxii. 1007

<p>This doctrine appears in perfected form in Thomas Aquinas. He shows
that penance is a sacrament, and that the words “I absolve thee” are
the form of it; for this sacrament receives its full effect from those
things which are spoken by the priest. These words have been appointed
by Christ (<i>Matthew</i> xvi); and the general rule that God alone
forgives sin is not violated by the priest’s absolution, since the
priests are “authorised ministers.”<a name="FnAnchor1270"
href="#Footnote1270"><span class="sp">1270</span></a> The salvation of
the sinner&mdash;that is, that his sin be removed from him&mdash;is
not possible without the sacrament of penance, in which there operates
the virtue of Christ’s passion through the absolution of the priest
together with the work of the penitent, who co-operates with grace for
the destruction of sin. “When once anyone has fallen into sin, love,
faith, and mercy do not deliver the man from sin without penitence;
for love requires that a man grieve for the offence committed against
his friend, and that a man be anxious to satisfy his friend; faith
also requires that he seek to be justified from his sins through the
virtue of the passion of Christ, which operates in the sacraments of
the Church; rightly directed mercy also requires that a man find a
remedy in his repenting for the misery into which his sin has plunged
him.”<a name="FnAnchor1271" href="#Footnote1271"><span
class="sp">1271</span></a> “Penitence is twofold, namely, internal and
external. That is internal penitence in which one grieves over sin
committed, and such penitence ought to last till the close of life. .
. . That is external penitence in which one shows external signs of
grief, and verbally confesses his sins to the priest who absolves him,
and makes satisfaction according to the priest’s judgment; and such
penitence does not need to continue till the end of life, but only for
a time determined by the measure of the sin.”<a name="FnAnchor1272"
href="#Footnote1272"><span class="sp">1272</span></a> Thomas&mdash;as
others had done before him&mdash;distinguishes between attrition and
contrition: the former is a certain displeasure over sins committed,
but only an approach to perfect contrition, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page211"></a>211</span> which is a perfect penitent disposition.<a
name="FnAnchor1273" href="#Footnote1273"><span
class="sp">1273</span></a> As to the necessity of confession, he
points out that though according to divine law only those guilty of
mortal sin after baptism are obliged to confess, yet according to
positive law (that is, the decree of the Council of 1215) all
Christians must confess at least once a year,<a name="FnAnchor1274"
href="#Footnote1274"><span class="sp">1274</span></a> and that a
dispensation exempting from confession can on no account whatever be
given.<a name="FnAnchor1275" href="#Footnote1275"><span
class="sp">1275</span></a> As to the administrator of confession it is
said that as “he only is the minister of the sacraments in which grace
is given who has a ministry in connection with the true body of
Christ,” confession must be made to him only.<a name="FnAnchor1276"
href="#Footnote1276"><span class="sp">1276</span></a> But it is
conceded that “in case of necessity a layman supplies the place of the
priest, so that it is possible to make confession to him.”<a
name="FnAnchor1277" href="#Footnote1277"><span
class="sp">1277</span></a> Thomas very strongly accentuates the
reticence of the minister: “it is of the essence of the sacrament that
one conceal confession, and he sins as a violator of the sacraments
who reveals confession.”<a name="FnAnchor1278"
href="#Footnote1278"><span class="sp">1278</span></a> The confession
made before the priest is followed by absolution. Thomas has developed
the doctrine of “the power of the keys,” and pointed out that the
priest’s absolution is “the instrumental cause” of the forgiveness of
sin.<a name="FnAnchor1279" href="#Footnote1279"><span
class="sp">1279</span></a> He explains that even the bad priest
retains the keys.<a name="FnAnchor1280" href="#Footnote1280"><span
class="sp">1280</span></a> But absolution is preceded by the
appointment of satisfaction, if such has not already been made; here
the priest acts as a skilled physician and impartial judge.<a
name="FnAnchor1281" href="#Footnote1281"><span
class="sp">1281</span></a> This performance is the necessary
manifestation of sorrow through works that are fitted to furnish a
certain satisfaction to the injured God, especially prayer, fasting,
and alms.<a name="FnAnchor1282" href="#Footnote1282"><span
class="sp">1282</span></a> It is shown that one can render
satisfaction for another; yet this thesis has its guarding clauses.<a

<p>Thomas’ doctrine of the sacrament of penitence underwent
modifications made by the Scotists,<a name="FnAnchor1284"
href="#Footnote1284"><span class="sp">1284</span></a> but it became
permanent in substance. The Council of Trent declared that “the
universal Church has always understood that the entire confession of
sins is of divine right necessary for all who have fallen after
baptism, because Christ has left behind him priests, representatives
of himself, as overseers and judges to whom all mortal offences are to
be made known”;<a name="FnAnchor1285" href="#Footnote1285"><span
class="sp">1285</span></a> and it pronounced anathema on any one who
shall deny that, “for the entire and perfect <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page212"></a>212</span> remission of sins, three acts are required
in the penitent, forming, as it were, the material of the sacrament of
penance, namely contrition, confession, and satisfaction, which are
called the three parts of penance.”<a name="FnAnchor1286"
href="#Footnote1286"><span class="sp">1286</span></a> Thus the party
which declared attrition to be enough for saving reception of the
sacrament did not succeed in asserting itself. At the same time
attrition is called “imperfect contrition” and is described as “a gift
of God and an impulse of the Holy Spirit”; and it is said that
although attrition cannot of itself conduct the sinner to
justification, “it disposes him to obtain the grace of God in the
sacrament of penance.”<a name="FnAnchor1287"

<p>For the inner penitent temper, the confession of sin, and the
satisfaction, Luther substituted repentance alone, which he conceived
of as the crushed feeling about sin awakened by faith, and he also
abolished the necessity for priestly co-operation by substituting for
the Catholic sacrament of penance the thought of justification by
faith. This became the general Protestant doctrine. In England the
Wesleyans have Church discipline, and so had the Calvinistic and
Presbyterian bodies, but no confession, while the Salvation Army
practises and recommends public confession. The Anglicans do not
prescribe auricular confession, but merely advise it, when necessary,
to satisfy one’s conscience, and to the sick if they feel their
conscience troubled. The Oxford Movement revived it to a considerable
extent.<a name="FnAnchor1288" href="#Footnote1288"><span
class="sp">1288</span></a> It should be noticed that confession, even
when unconnected with any formal absolution, serves as a means of
purgation. We find this also among savages. “The Akikuyu of British
East Africa hold that sin is essentially remissible, and one needs
only to confess it. The confession is made, usually, to a sorcerer or
to a medicine-man who expels the sin by a ceremony in which one
subjects himself to the effects of a pretended emetic,
<i>kotahikio</i>, a word derived from <i>tahikia</i>, ‘to vomit.’”
Such a view is found among some American Indians as well, the words
“to vomit” and “to confess” being synonymous, or nearly so.<a

<p>The sacrament of penance differs from the other sacraments by
having a distinctly ethical foundation. The starting-point is the
contrition, or at any rate attrition, of the penitent, while the real
sacrament is the external acts of him and the priest.<a
name="FnAnchor1290" href="#Footnote1290"><span
class="sp">1290</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page213"></a>213</span> But as the contrition did not constitute
the actual sacrament, the opinion could easily creep in that in the
case of sacramental penitence the addition of the sacrament completes
the imperfect contrition; and as a matter of fact this opinion became
dominant.<a name="FnAnchor1291" href="#Footnote1291"><span
class="sp">1291</span></a> The priest became the most important
person. As Joh. von Paltz says, very few men are really contrite,
though every one can bring himself in the end to an imperfect
contrition, and then the priest, through the sacrament of penance,
transfers the imperfect contrition into a perfect one and saves the
soul of the penitent.<a name="FnAnchor1292" href="#Footnote1292"><span
class="sp">1292</span></a> The satisfaction preceding absolution,
again, became a sheer travesty through the practice of indulgences,
which implied the exchange of more arduous penitential acts for very
small performances, such as the payment of penance money&mdash;with
such excellent result that the Church dispensed from the temporal
pains of purgatory all, whether living or departed, who either
themselves or vicariously performed those ecclesiastical
exercises.</p>

<p>The practice and theory of indulgences were strenuously attacked by
Wyclif and Huss, by Wesel and Wessel, and, as everybody knows, by
Luther. But his own doctrine that only such repentance has value
before God as springs from faith, is also open to severe criticism,
though of a very different kind. It alienates repentance widely from
the sphere of morality, and is fraught with serious consequences. It
makes it as constant as faith. The first of Luther’s ninety-five
theses runs: “Our Lord and Master Jesus Christ in saying: ‘Repent ye,’
etc., intended that the whole life of believers should be penitence.”
A Lutheran theologian remarks that if men are told that they must
constantly repent, and that particular acts of repentance are of no
use, there are few who will ever repent.<a name="FnAnchor1293"

<h4>CHAPTER XI</h4>
<h3>CHRISTIANITY AND THE REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">I</span><span class="smcap">N</span> the preceding chapters we have
studied Christian ethics as expressed in theories of salvation, and
examined how far these theories are in agreement with the nature of
our moral emotions. The remaining portion of the book will be devoted
to a discussion of the influence which Christianity has exercised in
concrete cases upon ideas and behaviour within different branches of
morality.</p>
<p>It inspired a greater regard for human life than was felt anywhere
in pagan society. The extraordinary importance it attached to this
earthly life as a preparation for the life to come naturally increased
the guilt of any one who, by cutting it short, not only killed the
body, but probably to all eternity injured the soul; and in a still
higher degree than most other crimes, homicide was regarded as an
offence against God, because man had been made in his image.<a
name="FnAnchor1294" href="#Footnote1294"><span
class="sp">1294</span></a> Gratian says that even the slayer of a Jew
or a heathen has to undergo a severe penance, “quia imaginem Dei et
spem futuræ conversionis exterminat.”<a name="FnAnchor1295"
href="#Footnote1295"><span class="sp">1295</span></a> The early
Christians, in fact, condemned homicide of any kind as a heinous sin;
and in this, as in all other questions of moral concern, the
distinction of nationality or race was ignored by them.</p>

<p>The sanctity which they attached to the life of every human being
led to a total condemnation of warfare, sharply contrasting with the
prevailing sentiment in the Roman Empire. In accordance with the
general spirit of their religion, as also with special passages in the
Bible,<a name="FnAnchor1296" href="#Footnote1296"><span
class="sp">1296</span></a> they considered war unlawful in all
circumstances. Justin Martyr quotes the prophecy of Isaiah, that
“nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they
learn war any more,”<a name="FnAnchor1297" href="#Footnote1297"><span
class="sp">1297</span></a> and proceeds to say that the instruction in
the Word of God which was given by the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page215"></a>215</span> twelve Apostles “had so good effect that
we, who heretofore were continually devouring each other, will not now
so much as lift up our hand against our enemies.”<a
name="FnAnchor1298" href="#Footnote1298"><span
class="sp">1298</span></a> Lactantius asserts that “to engage in war
cannot be lawful for the righteous man, whose warfare is that of
righteousness itself.”<a name="FnAnchor1299"
href="#Footnote1299"><span class="sp">1299</span></a> Tertullian asks:
“Can it be lawful to handle the sword, when the Lord himself has
declared that he who uses the sword shall perish by it?”<a
name="FnAnchor1300" href="#Footnote1300"><span
class="sp">1300</span></a> And in another passage he states that “the
Lord by his disarming of Peter disarmed every soldier from that time
forward.”<a name="FnAnchor1301" href="#Footnote1301"><span
class="sp">1301</span></a> Origen calls the Christians the children of
peace, who, for the sake of Jesus, never take up the sword against any
nation; who fight for their monarch by praying for him, but who take
no part in his wars, even though he urge them.<a name="FnAnchor1302"
href="#Footnote1302"><span class="sp">1302</span></a> It is true that
even in early times Christian soldiers were not unknown; Tertullian
alludes to such as were engaged in military pursuits together with
their heathen countrymen.<a name="FnAnchor1303"

<p>A divine law which prohibited all resistance to enemies could
certainly not be accepted by the State, especially at a time when the
Empire was seriously threatened by foreign invaders. Christianity
could therefore never become a State religion unless it gave up its
attitude towards war. And it gave it up. In 314 a Council condemned
soldiers who, from religious motives, deserted their colours.<a
name="FnAnchor1307" href="#Footnote1307"><span
class="sp">1307</span></a> Athanasius, “the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page216"></a>216</span> father of orthodoxy,” ventured to say that
it was not only permissible, but praiseworthy, to kill enemies in
war.<a name="FnAnchor1308" href="#Footnote1308"><span
class="sp">1308</span></a> Ambrose eulogised the warlike courage which
prefers death to bondage and disgrace, and claimed the Old Testament
warriors as spiritual ancestors; nay, he adopted the classical maxim
that one who does not defend a friend from injury is as much at fault
as he who commits the injury.<a name="FnAnchor1309"
href="#Footnote1309"><span class="sp">1309</span></a> Augustine, who
was forced to face the question by the havoc of the Teutonic
migrations and the peril of the Empire, explored the subject very
fully. He tried to prove that the practice of war was quite compatible
with the teaching of the New Testament. The soldiers who were seeking
for a knowledge of salvation were not directed to throw aside their
arms and renounce their profession, but were advised to be content
with their wages.<a name="FnAnchor1310" href="#Footnote1310"><span
class="sp">1310</span></a> St. Peter baptised Cornelius, the
centurion, in the name of Christ, without exhorting him to give up the
military life.<a name="FnAnchor1311" href="#Footnote1311"><span

guard of soldiers for his defence.<a name="FnAnchor1312"

history of David, the “man after God’s own heart,” an evidence of
those being wrong who say that “no one who wages war can please
God.”<a name="FnAnchor1313" href="#Footnote1313"><span
class="sp">1313</span></a> When Christ declared that “all they that
take the sword shall perish with the sword,” he referred to such
persons only as arm themselves to shed the blood of others without
either command or permission of any lawful authority.<a
name="FnAnchor1314" href="#Footnote1314"><span
class="sp">1314</span></a> A great deal depends on the causes for
which men undertake war, and on the authority they have for doing so.
Those wars are just which are waged with a view to obtaining redress
for wrongs, or to chastising the undue arrogance of another State. The
monarch has the power of making war when he thinks it advisable, and,
even if he be a sacrilegious king, a Christian may fight under him,
provided that what he enjoined upon the soldier personally is not
contrary to the precept of God.<a name="FnAnchor1315"

peace is our final good, though in the City of God there is peace in

sinful world.</p>

<p>By the writings of Augustine the theoretical attitude of the Church
towards war was definitely settled, and later theologians <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page217"></a>217</span> only reproduced or
further elaborated his view. Thomas Aquinas says that there are three
requisites for a war to be just. The first thing is the authority of
the prince by whose command the war is to be waged. It does not belong
to a private person to start a war, for he can prosecute his claim in
the court of his superior. But since the care of the commonwealth is
entrusted to princes, it belongs to them not only to defend it with
the sword against inward disturbances by punishing malefactors, but
also to protect it from enemies without by the sword of war. The
second requisite is a just cause, so that they who are assailed should
deserve to be assailed for some fault that they have committed; as
Augustine says: “Just wars are usually defined as those which avenge
injuries, in cases where a nation or city has to be chastised for
having either neglected to punish the wicked doings of its people, or
neglected to restore what has been wrongfully taken away.” The third
requisite is a right intention of promoting good or avoiding evil; as
Augustine says: “Eagerness to hurt, bloodthirsty desire to revenge, an
untamed and unforgiving temper, ferocity in renewing the struggle,
lust of empire,&mdash;these and the like excesses are justly blamed in
war.”<a name="FnAnchor1317" href="#Footnote1317"><span
class="sp">1317</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote1317"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor1317"><sup>1317</sup></a></span> Thomas Aquinas,
<i>Summa theologica</i>, ii.-ii. 40. 1.</p></div>

<p>Yet it was not with a perfectly safe conscience that the Church
thus sanctioned the practice of war. There was a feeling that a
soldier scarcely could make a good Christian. In the middle of the
fifth century, Leo the Pope declared it to be contrary to the rules of
the Church that persons after the action of penance&mdash;that is,
persons then considered to be pre-eminently bound to obey the law of
Christ&mdash;should revert to the profession of arms.<a
name="FnAnchor1318" href="#Footnote1318"><span
class="sp">1318</span></a> Various Councils forbade the clergy to
engage in warfare,<a name="FnAnchor1319" href="#Footnote1319"><span
class="sp">1319</span></a> and certain canons excluded from ordination
all who <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218"></a>218</span> had
served in an army after baptism.<a name="FnAnchor1320"
href="#Footnote1320"><span class="sp">1320</span></a> Penance was
prescribed for those who had shed blood on the battle-field.<a
name="FnAnchor1321" href="#Footnote1321"><span
class="sp">1321</span></a> Thus the ecclesiastical canons made in
William the Conqueror’s reign by the Norman prelates, and confirmed by
the Pope, directed that he who was aware that he had killed a man in a
battle should do penance for one year, and that he who had killed
several should do a year’s penance for each.<a name="FnAnchor1322"
href="#Footnote1322"><span class="sp">1322</span></a> Occasionally the
Church seemed to wake up to the evils of war in a more effective way:
there are several notorious instances of wars being forbidden by
popes. But in such cases the prohibition was only too often due to the
fact that some particular war was disadvantageous to the interests of
the Church. And while doing comparatively little to discourage wars
which did not interfere with her own interests, the Church did all the
more to excite war against those who were objects of her hatred.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote1319"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor1319"><sup>1319</sup></a></span> One of the Apostolic
Canons requires that any bishop, priest, or deacon who devotes himself
to military service shall be degraded from his ecclesiastical rank
(<i>Canones ecclesiastici qui dicuntur Apostolorum</i>, 83 [74] [C. C.
J. Bunsen, <i>Analecta Ante-Nicæna</i>, ii, London, 1854, p. 31]). The
Councils of Toulouse, in 633 (ch. 45, in Labbe-Mansi, x. 630), and of
Meaux, in 845 (can. 37, <i>ibid.</i> xiv. 827), condemned to a similar
punishment those of the clergy who ventured to take up arms. Gratian
says (<i>Decretum</i>, ii. 23. 8. 4) that the Church refuses to pray
for the soul of a priest who died on the battle-field. But
notwithstanding the canons of Councils and the decrees of popes,
ecclesiastics frequently participated in battles (Nicolaus I.,

<p>It has been suggested that the transition from the peaceful
principles of the primitive Church to the essentially military
Christianity of the crusades was chiefly due to the terrors and the
example of Islam. “The spirit of Mohammedanism,” says Lecky, “slowly
passed into Christianity, and transformed it into its image.” Until
then, “war was rather condoned than consecrated, and, whatever might
be the case with a few isolated prelates, the Church did nothing to
increase or encourage it.”<a name="FnAnchor1323"
href="#Footnote1323"><span class="sp">1323</span></a> But this view is
hardly consistent with facts. Christianity had entered on the war-path
already before it came into contact with Mohammedanism. Wars against
Arian peoples had been represented as holy wars, for which the
combatants would be rewarded by Heaven.<a name="FnAnchor1324"
href="#Footnote1324"><span class="sp">1324</span></a> The war which
Chlodwig made upon the Visigoths was not only undertaken with the
approval <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219"></a>219</span> of the
clergy, but it was “properly their war, and Chlodwig undertook it in
the capacity of a religious champion in all things but the
disinterestedness which ought to distinguish that character.” Remigius
of Reims assisted him by his countenance and advice, and the Catholic
priesthood set every engine of their craft in motion to second and
encourage him.<a name="FnAnchor1325" href="#Footnote1325"><span
class="sp">1325</span></a> In the Church itself there were germs out
of which a military spirit would naturally develop itself. The famous
dictum, “Nulla salus extra ecclesiam,” was promulgated as early as the
days of Cyprian. The general view of mediæval orthodoxy was that those
beyond the pale of the Church, heathen and heretics alike, were
unalterably doomed to hell, whereas those who would acknowledge her
authority, confess their sins, receive the sacrament of baptism,
partake of the Eucharist, and obey the priest, would be infallibly
saved. If war was allowed by God, could there be a more proper object
for it than the salvation of souls otherwise lost? And for those who
refused to accept the gift of grace offered them, could there be a
juster punishment than death? Moreover, had not the Israelites fought
great battles “for the laws and the sanctuary?”<a name="FnAnchor1326"
href="#Footnote1326"><span class="sp">1326</span></a> Had not the Lord
Himself commissioned them to attack, subdue, and destroy his enemies?
Had he not commanded them to root out the natives of Canaan, who,
because of their abominations, had fallen under God’s judgment, and to
kill man and beast in the Israelitish cities which had given
themselves to idolatry, and to burn all the spoil, with the city
itself, as a whole offering to Jehovah?<a name="FnAnchor1327"
href="#Footnote1327"><span class="sp">1327</span></a> There was no
need, then, for the Christians to go to the Mohammedans in order to
learn the art of religious war. The Old Testament, the revelation of
God, gave better lessons in it than the Koran, and was constantly
cited in justification of any cruelty committed in the name of
religion.<a name="FnAnchor1328" href="#Footnote1328"><span

<p>It was thus in perfect consistency with the general teachings of
the Church that she regarded an exploit achieved against the infidels
as a merit which might obliterate the guilt of the most atrocious
crimes. Such a deed was the instrument of pardon to Henry II. for the
murder of Becket,<a name="FnAnchor1329" href="#Footnote1329"><span
class="sp">1329</span></a> and was supposed to be the means of cure to
St. Louis in a dangerous illness. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page220"></a>220</span> Fighting against infidels took rank with
fastings, penitential discipline, visits to shrines, and almsgivings,
as meriting the divine mercy.<a name="FnAnchor1330"
href="#Footnote1330"><span class="sp">1330</span></a> He who fell in
the battle could be confident that his soul was admitted directly into
the joys of paradise.<a name="FnAnchor1331" href="#Footnote1331"><span
class="sp">1331</span></a> And this held good not only of wars against
Mohammedans. The massacres of Jews and heretics seemed no less
meritorious than the slaughter of the more remote enemies of the
gospel. Nay, even a slight shade of difference from the liturgy of
Rome became at last a legitimate cause of war.</p>

<p>It is true that these views were not shared by all. At the Council
of Lyons, in 1274, the opinion was pronounced, and of course eagerly
attacked, that it was contrary to the examples of Christ and the
apostles to uphold religion with the sword and to shed the blood of
unbelievers.<a name="FnAnchor1332" href="#Footnote1332"><span
class="sp">1332</span></a> In the following century Bonet maintained
that, according to the Scriptures, a Saracen or any other disbeliever
could not be compelled by force to accept the Christian faith.<a
name="FnAnchor1333" href="#Footnote1333"><span
class="sp">1333</span></a> Franciscus a Victoria declared that
“diversity of religion is not a cause of just war”;<a
name="FnAnchor1334" href="#Footnote1334"><span

Soto,<a name="FnAnchor1335" href="#Footnote1335"><span

href="#Footnote1336"><span class="sp">1336</span></a> and Suarez.<a
name="FnAnchor1337" href="#Footnote1337"><span
class="sp">1337</span></a> According to Balthazar Ayala, the most
illustrious Spanish lawyer of the sixteenth century, it does not
belong to the Church to punish infidels who have never received the
Christian faith, whereas those who, having once received it,
afterwards endeavour to prevent the propagation of the gospel, may,
like other heretics, be justly persecuted with the sword.<a
name="FnAnchor1338" href="#Footnote1338"><span

href="#Footnote1339"><span class="sp">1339</span></a> And this
principle was, professedly, acted upon to an extent which made the
history of Christianity <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page221"></a>221</span> for many centuries a perpetual crusade,
and transformed the Christian Church into a military power even more
formidable than Rome under Cæsar and Augustus. Very often religious
zeal was a mere pretext for wars which in reality were caused by
avarice or desire for power. The aim of the Church was to be the
master of the earth, rather than the servant of heaven. She preached
crusades not only against infidels and heretics, but against any
disobedient prince who opposed her boundless pretensions. And she
encouraged war when rich spoils were to be expected from the victor,
as a thankoffering to God for the victory He had granted, or as an
atonement for the excesses which had been committed.</p>

<p>Out of this union between war and Christianity there was born that
curious bastard, Chivalry. The secular germ of it existed already in
the German forests. According to Tacitus, the young German who aspired
to be a warrior was brought into the midst of the assembly of the
chiefs, where his father, or some other relative, solemnly equipped
him for his future vocation with shield and javelin.<a
name="FnAnchor1340" href="#Footnote1340"><span
class="sp">1340</span></a> Assuming arms was thus made a social
distinction, which subsequently derived its name from one of its most
essential characteristics, riding a war-horse. But Chivalry became
something quite different from what the word indicates. The Church
knew how to lay hold of knighthood for her own purposes. The
investiture, which was originally of a purely civil nature, became,
even before the time of the crusades, as it were, a sacrament.<a
name="FnAnchor1341" href="#Footnote1341"><span
class="sp">1341</span></a> The priest delivered the sword into the
hand of the person who was to be made a knight, with the following
words: “Serve Christi, sis miles in nomine Patris, Filii, et Spiritus
Sancti, Amen.”<a name="FnAnchor1342" href="#Footnote1342"><span
class="sp">1342</span></a> The sword was said to be made in semblance
of the cross so as to signify “how our Lord God vanquished in the
cross the death of human lying”;<a name="FnAnchor1343"
href="#Footnote1343"><span class="sp">1343</span></a> and the word
“Jesus” was sometimes <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page222"></a>222</span> engraven on its hilt.<a
name="FnAnchor1344" href="#Footnote1344"><span
class="sp">1344</span></a> God Himself had chosen the knight to defeat
with arms the miscreants who wished to destroy his Holy Church, in the
same way as he had chosen the clergy to maintain the Catholic faith
with Scripture and reasons.<a name="FnAnchor1345"
href="#Footnote1345"><span class="sp">1345</span></a> The knight was
to the body politic what the arms are to the human body: the Church
was the head, Chivalry the arms, the citizens, merchants, and
labourers the inferior members; and the arms were placed in the middle
to render them equally capable of defending the inferior members and
the head.<a name="FnAnchor1346" href="#Footnote1346"><span
class="sp">1346</span></a> “The greatest amity that should be in this
world,” says the author of ‘The Book of the Ordre of Chyualry,’ “ought
to be between the knights and clerks.”<a name="FnAnchor1347"
href="#Footnote1347"><span class="sp">1347</span></a> The several
gradations of knighthood were regarded as parallel to those of the
Church.<a name="FnAnchor1348" href="#Footnote1348"><span
class="sp">1348</span></a> And after the conquest of the Holy Land the
union between the profession of arms and the religion of Christ became
still more intimate by the institution of the two military orders of
monks, the Knights Templars and Knights of St. John of Jerusalem.</p>

(<i>Dissertations historiques et critiques sur la chevalerie</i>

some other writers, of Arabic origin. L. Gautier (<i>La Chevalerie</i>

<p>The duties which a knight took on himself by oath were very
extensive, but not very well defined. He should defend the holy
Catholic faith, he should defend justice, he should defend women,
widows, and orphans, and all those of either sex that were powerless,
ill at ease, and groaning under oppression and injustice.<a
name="FnAnchor1349" href="#Footnote1349"><span
class="sp">1349</span></a> In the name of religion and justice he
could thus practically wage war almost at will. Though much real
oppression was undoubtedly avenged by these soldiers of the Church,
the knight seems as a rule to have cared little for the cause or
necessity of his doing battle. “La guerre est ma patrie, Mon harnois
ma maison: Et en toute saison Combatre c’est ma vie,” was a saying
much in use in the sixteenth century.<a name="FnAnchor1350"
href="#Footnote1350"><span class="sp">1350</span></a> The general
impression which Froissart gives us in his history is, that the age in
which he lived was completely given over to fighting, and cared about
nothing else whatever.<a name="FnAnchor1351"
href="#Footnote1351"><span class="sp">1351</span></a> The French
knights never spoke of war but as a feast, a game, a pastime. “Let
them play their game,” they said of the cross-bow men who were
showering down arrows on them; and “to play a great game,” <i>jouer
gros jeu</i>, was their description of a battle.<a name="FnAnchor1352"
href="#Footnote1352"><span class="sp">1352</span></a> Previous to the
institution of Chivalry there certainly existed <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page223"></a>223</span> much fighting in
Christian countries, but knighthood rendered war “a fashionable
accomplishment.”<a name="FnAnchor1353" href="#Footnote1353"><span
class="sp">1353</span></a> And so all-absorbing became the passion for
it that, as real injuries were not likely to occur every day,
artificial grievances were created, and tilts and tournaments were
invented in order to keep in action the sons of war when they had no
other employments for their courage. Even in these images of
war&mdash;which were by no means so harmless as they have sometimes
been represented to be<a name="FnAnchor1354"
href="#Footnote1354"><span class="sp">1354</span></a>&mdash;the
intimate connection between Chivalry and religion displays itself in
various ways. Before the tournament began, the coats of arms, helmets,
and other objects were carried into a monastery, and after the victory
was gained the arms and the horses which had been used in the fight
were offered up at the church.<a name="FnAnchor1355"
href="#Footnote1355"><span class="sp">1355</span></a> The
proclamations at the tournaments were generally in the name of God and
the Virgin Mary. Before battle the knights confessed and heard mass;
and when they entered the lists, they held a sort of image with which
they made the sign of the cross.<a name="FnAnchor1356"
href="#Footnote1356"><span class="sp">1356</span></a> Moreover, “as
the feasts of the tournaments were accompanied by these acts of
devotion, so the feasts of the Church were sometimes adorned with the
images of the tournaments.”<a name="FnAnchor1357"
href="#Footnote1357"><span class="sp">1357</span></a> It is true that
the Church now and then made attempts to stop these performances.<a
name="FnAnchor1358" href="#Footnote1358"><span
class="sp">1358</span></a> But then she did so avowedly because they
prevented many knights from joining the holy wars, or because they
swallowed up treasures which might otherwise with advantage have been
poured into the Holy Land.<a name="FnAnchor1359"

<p>Closely connected with the feudal system was the practice of
private war. Though tribunals had been instituted, and even long after
the kings’ courts had become well-organised and powerful institutions,
a nobleman had a right to wage war upon another nobleman from whom he
had suffered some gross injury.<a name="FnAnchor1360"
href="#Footnote1360"><span class="sp">1360</span></a> On such
occasions not only the relatives, but also the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page224"></a>224</span> vassals, of the injured
man were bound to help him in his quarrel, and the same obligation
existed in the case of the aggressor.<a name="FnAnchor1361"
href="#Footnote1361"><span class="sp">1361</span></a> Only greater
crimes were regarded as legitimate causes of private war,<a
name="FnAnchor1362" href="#Footnote1362"><span
class="sp">1362</span></a> but this rule was not at all strictly
observed. We read of a nobleman who declared war against Frankfort,
because a lady residing there had promised to dance with his cousin,
but danced with another; and the city was obliged to satisfy the
wounded honour of the gentleman.<a name="FnAnchor1363"
href="#Footnote1363"><span class="sp">1363</span></a> The barons fled
to arms upon every quarrel; he who could raise a small force at once
made war upon him who had anything to lose. The nations of Europe were
subdivided into innumerable states of inferior rank, which were almost
independent, and declared war and made treaties with all the vigour
and all the ceremonies of powerful monarchs. Contemporary historians
describe the excesses committed in prosecution of these intestine
quarrels in such terms as excite astonishment and horror; and great
parts of Europe were in consequence reduced to the condition of a
desert, which it ceased to be worth while to cultivate.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote1360"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor1360"><sup>1360</sup></a></span> The right of private
war generally supposed nobility of birth and equality of rank in both
the contending parties (Ph. de Beaumanoir, <i>Les coutumes du
Beauvoisis</i> [Paris, 1842], lix. 5 <i>sq.</i>, vol. ii. 355
<i>sq.</i>; W. Robertson, <i>The History of the Reign of the Emperor
Charles V.</i>, i [London, 1806], p. 329). But it was also granted to
the French <i>communes</i> and to the free towns in Germany, Italy,
and Spain (A. Du Boys, <i>Histoire du droit criminel des peuples
modernes</i>, ii [Paris, 1858], p. 348).</p></div>

<p>The Church made some feeble attempts to put an end to this state of
things. Thus, about the year 990, ordinances were directed against the
practice of private war by several bishops in the south of France, who
agreed to exclude him who violated their ordinances from all Christian
privileges during his life, and to deny him Christian burial after his
death.<a name="FnAnchor1364" href="#Footnote1364"><span
class="sp">1364</span></a> A little later, men engaged in warfare were
exhorted, by sacred relics and by the bodies of saints, to lay down
their arms and to swear that they would never again disturb the public
peace by their private hostilities.<a name="FnAnchor1365"
href="#Footnote1365"><span class="sp">1365</span></a> But it is hardly
likely that such directions had much effect as long as the bishops and
abbots themselves were allowed to wage private war by means of their
vidames, and exercised this right scarcely less frequently than the
barons.<a name="FnAnchor1366" href="#Footnote1366"><span
class="sp">1366</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page225"></a>225</span> Nor does it seem that the Church brought
about any considerable change for the better by establishing the Truce
of God, involving obligatory respite from hostilities during the great
festivals of the Church, as also from the evening of Wednesday in each
week to the morning of Monday in the week ensuing.<a
name="FnAnchor1367" href="#Footnote1367"><span
class="sp">1367</span></a> We are assured by good authorities that the
Truce was generally disregarded, though the violator was threatened
with the penalty of excommunication.<a name="FnAnchor1368"
href="#Footnote1368"><span class="sp">1368</span></a> Most barons
could probably say with Bertram de Born: “La paix ne me convient pas;
la guerre seule me plait. Je n’ai égard ni aux lundis, ni aux mardis.
Les semaines, les mois, les années, tout m’est égal. En tout temps, je
veux perdre quiconque me nuit.”<a name="FnAnchor1369"
href="#Footnote1369"><span class="sp">1369</span></a> The ordinance
enjoining the <i>treuga Dei</i> was transgressed even by the popes.<a
name="FnAnchor1370" href="#Footnote1370"><span
class="sp">1370</span></a> It was too unpractical a direction to be
obeyed, and was soon given up even in theory by the authorities of the
Church. Thomas Aquinas says that, as physicians may lawfully apply
remedies to men on feast-days, so just wars may be lawfully prosecuted
on such days for the defence of the commonwealth of the faithful, if
necessity so requires; “for it would be tempting God for a man to want
to keep his hands from war under stress of such necessity.”<a
name="FnAnchor1371" href="#Footnote1371"><span
class="sp">1371</span></a> And in support of this opinion he quotes
the First Book of the Maccabees, where it is said: “Whosoever shall
come to make battle with us on the sabbath day, we will fight against
him.”<a name="FnAnchor1372" href="#Footnote1372"><span

<p>It seems that the main cause of the abolition of private war was
not any measure taken by the Church, but the increase of the authority
of emperors or kings. In France the right of waging private war was
moderated by Louis IX., checked by Philip IV., suppressed by Charles
VI.<a name="FnAnchor1373" href="#Footnote1373"><span
class="sp">1373</span></a> In England, after the Norman Conquest,
private wars seem to have occurred more <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page226"></a>226</span> rarely than on the Continent, probably
owing to the strength of the royal authority, which made the execution
of justice more vigorous and the jurisdiction of the King’s court more
extensive than was the case in most other countries.<a
name="FnAnchor1374" href="#Footnote1374"><span
class="sp">1374</span></a> Freeman mentions as the last instance of
private war in England one from the time of Edward IV.<a
name="FnAnchor1375" href="#Footnote1375"><span
class="sp">1375</span></a> In Scotland the practice of private war
received its final blow only late in the eighteenth century, when the
clans were reduced to order after the rebellion of 1745.<a
name="FnAnchor1376" href="#Footnote1376"><span
class="sp">1376</span></a> While, then, it is impossible to ascribe to
the Church any considerable part in the movement which ultimately led
to the entire abolition of private war, we have, on the other hand, to
take into account the encouragement which the Church gave to the
warlike spirit of the time by the establishment of Chivalry,<a
name="FnAnchor1377" href="#Footnote1377"><span
class="sp">1377</span></a> and by sanctioning war as a divine
institution. Before a battle, the service of mass was usually
performed by both armies in the presence of each other, and no warrior
would fight without secretly breathing a prayer.<a name="FnAnchor1378"
href="#Footnote1378"><span class="sp">1378</span></a> Pope Adrian IV.
says that a war commenced under the auspices of religion cannot but be
fortunate;<a name="FnAnchor1379" href="#Footnote1379"><span
class="sp">1379</span></a> and it was commonly believed that God took
no less interest in the battle than did the fighting warriors. Bonet,
who wrote in the fourteenth century, puts to himself the question, why
there are so many wars in the world, and gives the answer, “que toutes
sont pour le pechié du siecle dont nostre seigneur Dieu pour le pugnir
permet les guerres, car ainsi le maintient l’escripture.”<a
name="FnAnchor1380" href="#Footnote1380"><span
class="sp">1380</span></a> The Catechism of the Council of Trent
brings home that there are on record instances of slaughter executed
by the special command of God Himself, as when the sons of Levi, who
put to death so many thousands in one day, after the slaughter were
thus addressed by Moses: “Ye have consecrated your hands this day to
the Lord.”<a name="FnAnchor1381" href="#Footnote1381"><span
class="sp">1381</span></a> Even quite modern Catholic writers refer to
the canonists who held that a State might lawfully make war upon a
heretic people which is spreading heresy, and upon a pagan people
which prevents the preaching of the gospel.<a name="FnAnchor1382"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page227"></a>227</span> In its
attitude towards war Protestantism was in general agreement with
Catholicism. Luther defended vigorously the Christian soldier.<a
name="FnAnchor1383" href="#Footnote1383"><span
class="sp">1383</span></a> Calvin argued that war is a branch of the
work of retributive justice which has been entrusted by God to the
civil magistrate, and that it has the same moral justification as the
police measures which protect the citizens against criminals. If it be
objected that the New Testament does not expressly permit Christians
to fight, it is to be observed that the gospel does not undertake to
legislate about civil polity, and that it presupposes the Old
Testament, “in which the greatest men of God, like Moses and David,
were mighty men of valour in the service of God.”<a
name="FnAnchor1384" href="#Footnote1384"><span
class="sp">1384</span></a> The subject received prominence in the
Protestant Confessions, which found it desirable to allay any
misgivings that might be felt by princes as to the political
implications of evangelical religion. They explicitly claimed for the
State the right of waging war, and the Anabaptists were condemned
because they considered war unlawful for a Christian.<a
name="FnAnchor1385" href="#Footnote1385"><span
class="sp">1385</span></a> Even the necessity of a just cause as a
reason for taking part in warfare, which was reasserted at the time of
the Reformation, was subsequently allowed to drop out of sight. It is
noticeable that in the Anglican Article XXXVII., which is to the
effect that a Christian at the command of the magistrate may wear
weapons and serve in the wars, the word <i>justa</i> in the Latin form
preceding the word <i>bella</i> has been omitted altogether. The
Lutheran clergy, however, have followed the tradition of the Catholic
Church that military service is inconsistent with the clerical
office;<a name="FnAnchor1386" href="#Footnote1386"><span
class="sp">1386</span></a> and the Anglican Church reaffirmed its
adherence to it during the recent war by forbidding the clergy to
offer themselves for such service. The Reformed Churches have
occasionally left it to ministers to judge for themselves as to
whether the necessity was such as to require them to offer their
services as fighting men to the State. This was lately done by the
Church of Scotland.<a name="FnAnchor1387" href="#Footnote1387"><span

<p>Nor did the old opinion that war is a providential institution and
a judgment of God die with the Middle Ages. Bacon looks upon wars as
“the highest trials of right; when princes and states that acknowledge
no superior upon earth shall put themselves upon the justice of God,
for the deciding of their controversies by such success as it shall
please Him to give on <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page228"></a>228</span> either side.”<a name="FnAnchor1388"
href="#Footnote1388"><span class="sp">1388</span></a> Réal de Curban
says that a war is seldom successful unless it be just, hence the
victor may presume that God is on his side.<a name="FnAnchor1389"
href="#Footnote1389"><span class="sp">1389</span></a> According to
Jeremy Taylor, “kings are in the place of God, who strikes whole
nations, and towns, and villages; and war is the rod of God in the
hands of princes.”<a name="FnAnchor1390" href="#Footnote1390"><span
class="sp">1390</span></a> And it is not only looked upon as an
instrument of divine justice, but it is also said, generally, “to work
out the noble purposes of God.”<a name="FnAnchor1391"
href="#Footnote1391"><span class="sp">1391</span></a> Its tendency, as
a theological writer assures us, is “to rectify and exalt the popular
conception of God,” there being nothing among men “like the smell of
gunpowder for making a nation perceive the fragrance of divinity in
truth.”<a name="FnAnchor1392" href="#Footnote1392"><span
class="sp">1392</span></a> By war the different countries “have been
opened up to the advance of true religion.”<a name="FnAnchor1393"

it had been thundered on the battle-field.”<a name="FnAnchor1394"
href="#Footnote1394"><span class="sp">1394</span></a> War is, “when
God sends it, a means of grace and of national renovation”; it is “a

trustworthy men should be commissioned to hold the sword.”<a

<p>In order to prove the consistency of war with Christianity appeals
are still, as in former days, made to the Bible: to the
divinely-sanctioned example of the ancient Israelites, to the fact
that Jesus never prohibited those around him from bearing arms, to the
instances of the centurions mentioned in the gospel, to Paul’s
predilection for taking his spiritual metaphors from the profession of
the soldier, and so on.<a name="FnAnchor1400"
href="#Footnote1400"><span class="sp">1400</span></a> According to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229"></a>229</span> Canon Mozley, the
Christian recognition of the right of war was contained in
Christianity’s original recognition of nations.<a name="FnAnchor1401"
href="#Footnote1401"><span class="sp">1401</span></a> “By a fortunate
necessity,” a universal empire is impossible.<a name="FnAnchor1402"
href="#Footnote1402"><span class="sp">1402</span></a> Each nation is a
centre by itself, and when questions of right and justice arise
between these independent centres, they cannot be decided except by
mutual agreement or force. The aim of the nation going to war is
exactly the same as that of the individual in entering a court, and
the Church, which has no right to decide which is the right side,
cannot but stand neutral and contemplate war forensically, as a mode
of settling national questions, which is justified by the want of any
other mode.<a name="FnAnchor1403" href="#Footnote1403"><span
class="sp">1403</span></a> A natural justice, Canon Mozley adds, is
inherent not only in wars of self-defence; there is an instinctive
reaching in nations and masses of people after alteration and
readjustment, which has justice in it. And there are wars of progress
which, so far as they are really necessary for the due advantage of
mankind, are approved of by Christianity.<a name="FnAnchor1404"
href="#Footnote1404"><span class="sp">1404</span></a> As a matter of
fact, it would be impossible to mention a single instance of a war
waged by a Protestant country, from any motive whatsoever, to which
the bulk of its clergy, being in the service of the State, have not
given their sanction and support. As Mr. Gibb observes, the Protestant
minister has been as ready with his Thanksgiving Sermon for the
victories of a profligate war as the Catholic priest has been with his
<i>Te Deum</i>; “indeed, the latter was probably the more independent
of the two, because of his allegiance to Rome.”<a name="FnAnchor1405"
href="#Footnote1405"><span class="sp">1405</span></a> The opposition
against war has generally come from other quarters.</p>

<p>There have been, and still are, Christian sects which, on religious
grounds, condemn war of any kind. In the fourteenth century the
Lollards taught that homicide in war is expressly contrary to the New
Testament; they were persecuted partly on this account.<a
name="FnAnchor1406" href="#Footnote1406"><span
class="sp">1406</span></a> Of the same opinion were the Anabaptists of
the sixteenth century, who suffered imprisonment and death rather than
bear arms; their insistence upon peace was the main cause of the
constant war made upon them. They could claim on their side the words
of men like Colet and Erasmus. From the pulpit of St. Paul’s Colet
thundered that “an unjust <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page230"></a>230</span> peace is better than the justest war,” and
that, “when men out of hatred and ambition fight with and destroy one
another, they fight under the banner, not of Christ, but of the
Devil.”<a name="FnAnchor1407" href="#Footnote1407"><span
class="sp">1407</span></a> According to Erasmus, “nothing is more
impious, more calamitous, more widely pernicious, more inveterate,
more base, or in sum more unworthy of a man, not to say of a
Christian,” than war. It is worse than brutal; to man no wild beast is
more destructive than his fellow-man. When brutes fight, they fight
with weapons which nature has given them, whereas we arm ourselves for
mutual slaughter with weapons which nature never thought of. Neither
do beasts break out in hostile rage for trifling causes, but either
when hunger drives them to madness, or when they find themselves
attacked, or when they are alarmed for the safety of their young. But
we, on frivolous pretences, what tragedies do we act on the theatre of
war! Under colour of some obsolete and disputable claim to territory;
in a childish passion for a mistress; for causes even more ridiculous
than these, we kindle the flame of war. Transactions truly hellish are
called holy wars. Bishops and grave divines, decrepit as they are in
person, fight from the pulpit the battles of the princes, promising
remission of sins to all who will take part in the war of the prince,
and exclaiming to the latter that God will fight for him, if he only
keeps his mind favourable to the cause of religion. And yet, how could
it ever enter into our hearts, that a Christian should imbrue his
hands in the blood of a Christian! What is war but murder and theft
committed by great numbers on great numbers! Does not the gospel
declare in decisive words that we must not revile again those who
revile us, that we should do good to those who use us ill, that we
should give up the whole of our possessions to those who take a part,
that we should pray for those who design to take away our lives? “The
man who engages in war by choice, that man, whoever he is, is a wicked
man; he sins against nature, against God, against man, and is guilty
of the most aggravated and complicated impiety.”<a name="FnAnchor1408"

<p>In Protestantism the chief opponents of war have been sectarians.
Among these the Quakers are the most important. By virtue of various
passages in the Old and the New Testament,<a name="FnAnchor1409"
href="#Footnote1409"><span class="sp">1409</span></a> they contend
that all warfare, whatever be its peculiar features, circumstances, or
pretexts, is wholly at variance with the Christian religion. It is
always the duty of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page231"></a>231</span> Christians to obey their Master’s high and
holy law&mdash;to suffer wrong, to return good for evil, to love their
enemies. War is also inconsistent with the Christian principle that
human life is sacred, and that death is followed by infinite
consequences. Since man is destined for eternity, the future welfare
of a single individual is of greater importance than the merely
temporal prosperity of a whole nation. When cutting short the days of
their neighbour and transmitting him, prepared or unprepared, to the
awful realities of an everlasting state, Christians take upon
themselves a most unwarrantable responsibility, unless such an action
is expressly sanctioned by their divine Master, as was the case among
the Israelites. In the New Testament there is no such sanction, hence
it must be concluded that, under the Christian dispensation, it is
utterly unlawful for one man to kill another, under whatever
circumstances of expediency or provocation the deed may be committed.
And a Christian who fights by the command of his prince, and in behalf
of his country, not only commits sin in his own person, but aids and
abets the national transgression.<a name="FnAnchor1410"

<p>Similar views, however, are also found independently of any
particular form of sectarianism. According to Dr. Wayland, all wars,
defensive as well as offensive, are contrary to the revealed will of
God, aggression from a foreign nation calling not for retaliation and
injury, but rather for special kindness and goodwill.<a

name="FnAnchor1412" href="#Footnote1412"><span
class="sp">1412</span></a> W. Stokes, the Baptist, observes that
Christianity cannot sanction war, whether offensive or defensive,
because war is an “immeasurable evil, by hurling unnumbered myriads of
our fellow-men to a premature judgment and endless despair.”<a
name="FnAnchor1413" href="#Footnote1413"><span
class="sp">1413</span></a> Even before the outbreak of the Great War
it was said that those who compared the state of opinion during later
years with that of former periods, could not fail to observe a marked
progress of a sentiment antagonistic to war in the various sections of
the Christian Church.<a name="FnAnchor1414" href="#Footnote1414"><span
class="sp">1414</span></a> Yet the duties which compulsory military
service imposes upon the male population of most Christian countries
presuppose that a Christian should have no scruples <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page232"></a>232</span> about taking part in
any war waged by the State; and they are recognised as binding by the
clergy of those countries. What, then, about “conscientious
objectors”? In France, during the Great War, the authorities
considered that it was not the business of the State to decide whether
a man’s dislike of fighting was due to conscience, want of patriotism,
or personal cowardice; and in consequence the few who refused to serve
were shot. In England, even after compulsory service was instituted,
men were allowed to plead conscientious scruples; but things were not
made pleasant for them, and they were on the whole condemned by public
opinion.<a name="FnAnchor1415" href="#Footnote1415"><span

<p>It is significant that the protest against war which has,
presumably, exercised the widest influence on public opinion, came
from a school of moralists whose tendencies were not only
anti-orthodox, but distinctly hostile to the most essential dogmas of
Christian theology. Bayle, in his ‘Dictionary,’ calls Erasmus’ essay
against war one of the most beautiful dissertations ever written.<a
name="FnAnchor1416" href="#Footnote1416"><span
class="sp">1416</span></a> He observes that the more we consider the
inevitable consequences of war, the more we feel disposed to detest
those who are the causes of it.<a name="FnAnchor1417"
href="#Footnote1417"><span class="sp">1417</span></a> Its usual fruits
may, indeed, “make those tremble who undertake or advise it, to
prevent evils which, perhaps, may never happen and which, at the
worst, would often be much less than those which necessarily follow a
rupture.”<a name="FnAnchor1418" href="#Footnote1418"><span
class="sp">1418</span></a> To Voltaire war is an “infernal
enterprise,” the strangest feature of which is that “every chief of
the ruffians has his colours consecrated, and solemnly prays to God
before he goes to destroy his neighbour.”<a name="FnAnchor1419"
href="#Footnote1419"><span class="sp">1419</span></a> He asks what the
Church has done to suppress this crime. Bourdaloue preached against
impurity, but what sermon did he ever direct against the murder,
rapine, brigandage, and universal rage, which desolate the world?
“Miserable physicians of souls, you declaim for five quarters of an
hour against the mere pricks of a pin, and say no word on the curse
which tears us into a thousand pieces.”<a name="FnAnchor1420"
href="#Footnote1420"><span class="sp">1420</span></a> Voltaire admits
that in certain circumstances war is an inevitable curse, but rebukes
Montesquieu for saying that natural defence sometimes involves the
necessity of attack, when a nation perceives that a longer peace would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page233"></a>233</span> place another
nation in a position to destroy it.<a name="FnAnchor1421"
href="#Footnote1421"><span class="sp">1421</span></a> Such a war, he
argues, is as illegitimate as possible. “It is to go and kill your
neighbour for fear that your neighbour, who does not attack yon,
should be in a condition to attack you; that is to say, you must run
the risk of ruining your country, in the hope of ruining without
reason some other country; this is, to be sure, neither fair nor
useful.”<a name="FnAnchor1422" href="#Footnote1422"><span
class="sp">1422</span></a> The chief causes which induce men to
massacre in all loyalty thousands of their brothers and to expose
their own people to the most terrible misery, are the ambitions and
jealousies of princes and their ministers.<a name="FnAnchor1423"
href="#Footnote1423"><span class="sp">1423</span></a> Similar views
are expressed in the great ‘Encyclopédie.’ “La guerre est le plus
terrible des fléaux qui détruisent l’espèce humaine: elle n’épargne
pas même les vainqueurs; la plus heureuse est funeste. . . . Ce ne
sont plus aujourd’hui les peuples qui déclarent la guerre, c’est la
cupidité des rois qui leur fait prendre les armes; e’est l’indigence
qui les met aux mains de leurs sujets.”<a name="FnAnchor1424"

<p>However vehemently Voltaire and the Encyclopædists condemned war,
they did not dream of a time when all wars would cease. Other writers
were more optimistic. In the early part of the eighteenth century Abbé
Saint-Pierre&mdash;whose abbotship involved only a nominal connection
with the Church&mdash;published a project of perpetual peace, which
was based on the idea of a general confederation of European
nations.<a name="FnAnchor1425" href="#Footnote1425"><span
class="sp">1425</span></a> This project was much laughed at; Voltaire
himself calls its author “un homme moitié philosophe, moitié fou.” But
once called into being, the idea of a perpetual peace and of a
European confederation did not die. It was successively conceived by
Rousseau,<a name="FnAnchor1426" href="#Footnote1426"><span
class="sp">1426</span></a> Bentham,<a name="FnAnchor1427"
href="#Footnote1427"><span class="sp">1427</span></a> and Kant.<a
name="FnAnchor1428" href="#Footnote1428"><span
class="sp">1428</span></a> But on the other hand it met with a
formidable enemy in the awakening spirit of nationalism.</p>

<p>The Napoleonic oppression called forth resistance. Philosophers and
poets sounded the war-trumpet. The dream of a universal monarchy was
looked upon as absurd and hateful, and the individuality of a nation
as the only possible security <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page234"></a>234</span> for its virtue.<a name="FnAnchor1429"
href="#Footnote1429"><span class="sp">1429</span></a> War was no
longer attributed to the pretended interests of princes, or to the
caprices of their advisers. It was praised as a vehicle of the highest
right,<a name="FnAnchor1430" href="#Footnote1430"><span
class="sp">1430</span></a> as a source of national renovation.<a
name="FnAnchor1431" href="#Footnote1431"><span
class="sp">1431</span></a> By war, says Hegel, “finite pursuits are
rendered unstable, and the ethical health of peoples is preserved.
Just as the movement of the ocean prevents the corruption which would
be the result of perpetual calm, so by war people escape the
corruption which would be occasioned by a continuous or eternal
peace.”<a name="FnAnchor1432" href="#Footnote1432"><span
class="sp">1432</span></a> Similar views have been expressed by later
writers. War is glorified as a stimulus to the elevated virtues of
courage, disinterestedness, and patriotism.<a name="FnAnchor1433"
href="#Footnote1433"><span class="sp">1433</span></a> It has done more
great things in the world than the love of man, says Nietzsche.<a
name="FnAnchor1434" href="#Footnote1434"><span
class="sp">1434</span></a> It is the mother of art and of all civil
virtues, says Ruskin.<a name="FnAnchor1435" href="#Footnote1435"><span
class="sp">1435</span></a> Others defend war, not as a positive good,
but as a necessary means of deciding the most serious international
controversies, denying that arbitration can be a substitute for all
kinds of war. Questions which are intimately connected with national
passions and national aspirations, and questions which are vital to a
nation’s safety, will never, they say, be left to arbitration. Each
State must be the guardian of its own security, and cannot allow its
independence to be calmly discussed and adjudicated upon by an
external tribunal.<a name="FnAnchor1436" href="#Footnote1436"><span
class="sp">1436</span></a> Moreover, arbitration would prove effective
only where the contradictory pretensions could be juridically
formulated, and these instances are by far the less numerous and the
less important.<a name="FnAnchor1437" href="#Footnote1437"><span
class="sp">1437</span></a> And would it not, in many cases, be
impossible to find impartial arbiters? Would not arbitration often be
influenced by a calculation of the forces which every power interested
could bring into the field, and would not war be resorted to where
arbitration failed to reconcile conflicting <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page235"></a>235</span> interests, or where a decision was opposed
to a high-spirited people’s sense of justice? The prediction of such
difficulties hampering the work of a League of Nations has, indeed,
been amply confirmed by recent events.</p>

<p>It is said that, although Christianity has not abolished war, it
has nevertheless, even in war, asserted the principle that human life
is sacred by prohibiting all needless destruction. The Canon ‘De
treuga et pace’ laid down the rule that non-resisting persons should
be spared;<a name="FnAnchor1438" href="#Footnote1438"><span
class="sp">1438</span></a> and Franciscus a Victoria maintained not
only that between Christian enemies those who made no resistance could
not lawfully be slain,<a name="FnAnchor1439"
href="#Footnote1439"><span class="sp">1439</span></a> but that even in
war against the Turks it was wrong to kill children and women.<a
name="FnAnchor1440" href="#Footnote1440"><span
class="sp">1440</span></a> This doctrine of mercy, however, was far in
advance of the habits and general opinion of the time.<a
name="FnAnchor1441" href="#Footnote1441"><span
class="sp">1441</span></a> If the simple peasant often was spared,
that was largely from motives of prudence,<a name="FnAnchor1442"
href="#Footnote1442"><span class="sp">1442</span></a> or because the
valiant knight considered him unworthy of the lance.<a
name="FnAnchor1443" href="#Footnote1443"><span
class="sp">1443</span></a> As late as the seventeenth century, Grotius
was certainly not supported by the spirit of the age when he argued
that, “if justice do not require, at least mercy does, that we should
not, except for weighty causes tending to the safety of many,
undertake anything which may involve innocent persons in
destruction”;<a name="FnAnchor1444" href="#Footnote1444"><span
class="sp">1444</span></a> or when he recommended enemies willing to
surrender on fair conditions, or unconditionally, to be spared.<a
name="FnAnchor1445" href="#Footnote1445"><span
class="sp">1445</span></a> Pufendorf, in echoing the doctrine of
Grotius,<a name="FnAnchor1446" href="#Footnote1446"><span
class="sp">1446</span></a> spoke to a world which was already
convinced; and in the eighteenth century Bynkershoek stands alone in
giving to a belligerent unlimited rights of violence.<a
name="FnAnchor1447" href="#Footnote1447"><span
class="sp">1447</span></a> In reference to the assumption that this
change of opinion is due to the influence of the Christian religion,
it is instructive to note that Grotius, in support of his doctrine,
appealed chiefly to pagan authorities; and that even savage peoples,
without the aid of Christianity, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page236"></a>236</span> have arrived at the rule which in war
forbids the destruction of helpless persons and captives.<a

<p>It is also remarkable that Augustine was under an obligation to
Cicero for his attitude towards war, which was adopted by the Church.
According to Cicero, a war, to be just, ought to be necessary, the
sole object of war being to enable us to live undisturbed in peace.
There are two modes of settling controversies, one by discussion, the
other by a resort to force. The first is proper to man, the second is
proper to brutes, and ought never to be adopted except where the first
is not available. And when we obtain the victory we are bound to
exercise consideration towards those whom we have conquered by force,
and to receive into our protection those who throw themselves upon the
honour of our general and lay down their arms.<a name="FnAnchor1449"
href="#Footnote1449"><span class="sp">1449</span></a> Seneca
anticipates Erasmus in his condemnation of war, which he regards as a
“glorious crime,” comparable to murder. “What is forbidden in private
life is commanded by public ordinance. Actions which, committed by
stealth, would meet with capital punishment, we praise because
committed by soldiers. Men, by nature the mildest species of the
animal race, are not ashamed to find delight in mutual slaughter, to
wage wars, and to transmit them to be waged by their children, when
even dumb animals and wild beasts live at peace with one another.”<a
name="FnAnchor1450" href="#Footnote1450"><span
class="sp">1450</span></a> History attests that the Romans, in their
intercourse with other nations, did not act upon Cicero’s and Seneca’s
lofty theories of international morality; as Plutarch observes, the
two names “peace” and “war” are mostly used only as coins, to procure,
not what is just, but what is expedient.<a name="FnAnchor1451"
href="#Footnote1451"><span class="sp">1451</span></a> This remark has
never ceased to be true. War is a rock on which Christian principles
have suffered the most miserable shipwreck.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XII</h4>
<h3>CHRISTIANITY AND THE REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE (<i>concluded</i>)</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">W</span><span class="smcap">HILE</span> the early Fathers utterly failed
to put a stop to war, they succeeded in their endeavour to bring about
a change of ideas with regard to another practice involving the
destruction of human life, to wit, the practice of exposing new-born
infants, which was very common in the Pagan Empire.</p>
<p>The exposure of deformed or sickly infants was an ancient custom in
Greece; in Sparta, at least, it was enjoined by law. It was also
approved of by the most enlightened among the Greek philosophers.
Plato condemns all those children who are imperfect in limbs, as also
those who are born from depraved citizens, to be buried in some
obscure and unknown place; he maintains, moreover, that when both
sexes have passed the age assigned for presenting children to the
State, no child is to be brought to light, and that any infant who is
by accident born alive shall be done away with.<a name="FnAnchor1452"
href="#Footnote1452"><span class="sp">1452</span></a> Aristotle not
only lays down the law with respect to the exposing or bringing up of
children, that “nothing imperfect or maimed shall be brought up,” but
proposes that the number of children allowed to each marriage shall be
regulated by the State, and that, if any woman be pregnant after she
has produced the prescribed number, an abortion shall be procured
before the fetus has life.<a name="FnAnchor1453"
href="#Footnote1453"><span class="sp">1453</span></a> These views were
in perfect harmony with the general tendency of the Greeks to
subordinate the feelings of the individual to the interest of the
State. Confined as they were to a very limited territory, they were
naturally afraid of being burdened with the maintenance of persons
whose life could be of no use. It is necessary, says Aristotle, to
take care that the increase of the people shall not exceed a certain
number, in order to avoid poverty and its concomitants, sedition and
other evils.<a name="FnAnchor1454" href="#Footnote1454"><span
class="sp">1454</span></a> It has been said that the exposure of
healthy infants, which was frequently practised in Greece, was hardly
approved of by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238"></a>238</span>
public opinion, although tolerated,<a name="FnAnchor1455"
href="#Footnote1455"><span class="sp">1455</span></a> except at
Thebes, where it was, according to Ælian, a crime punishable by
death.<a name="FnAnchor1456" href="#Footnote1456"><span
class="sp">1456</span></a> But recent researches have revealed the
extraordinary prevalence of infanticide in ancient Greece. According
to Mr. Zimmern, it remained a universal custom, so far as we know at
least down to the fourth century, that it was within the discretion of
the father whether a new-born child should be allowed to live. On the
fifth day after birth, at the earliest, the infant was solemnly
presented to the household and admitted to its membership. Up to the
time of this ceremony the father had a complete power of selection,
and it appears that this was quite frequently exercised, particularly
in the case of female infants. The provision of a dowry for his
daughters weighed heavily on a Greek father’s mind, and what was
easier than to evade it by pleading inability at the outset? When it
was decided that the infant was not to be “nourished,” it would be
packed in a cradle or a pot, and exposed in a public place. The
Athenian “had a traditional abhorrence of violence, and interfered
when he could on behalf of the helpless. If he consented to exercise
his immemorial right over his own offspring, he did so with regret,
for the sake of the city and his other children, because it was more
merciful in the long run.”<a name="FnAnchor1457"
href="#Footnote1457"><span class="sp">1457</span></a> Dr. Inge has
found from the speeches of Isæus, who lived in the fourth century
before Christ, that in the pedigrees of eleven typical Athenian
families, belonging to the middle class, the names of 97 males are
mentioned, and of only 37 females.<a name="FnAnchor1458"
href="#Footnote1458"><span class="sp">1458</span></a> Mr. Tarn writes
that the prevalence of infanticide in Greece has been strenuously
asserted from the literary texts, and as strenuously denied, but that
for the late third and the second centuries the inscriptions are
conclusive. “Of some thousand families from Greece who received
Milesian citizenship <i>c.</i> 228&mdash;220, details of 79, with
their children, remain; these brought 118 sons and 28 daughters, many
being minors; no natural causes can account for those proportions. . .
. More than one daughter was practically never reared, bearing out
Poseidippus’ statement that ‘even a rich man always exposes a
daughter.’ Of 600 families from Delphic inscriptions, second century,
just one per cent. reared two daughters.”<a name="FnAnchor1459"
href="#Footnote1459"><span class="sp">1459</span></a> Polybius says
that the Greeks in the middle <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page239"></a>239</span> of the second century refused to rear more
than one or, at most, two children;<a name="FnAnchor1460"
href="#Footnote1460"><span class="sp">1460</span></a> and, according
to Tarn, there is plenty of evidence to bear him out.<a

<p>In Rome custom or law enjoined the destruction of deformed infants.
According to a law of the Twelve Tables, referred to by Cicero,
monstrous abortions were not suffered to live.<a name="FnAnchor1462"
href="#Footnote1462"><span class="sp">1462</span></a> With reference
to a much later period Seneca writes: “We destroy monstrous births,
and we also drown our children if they are born weakly and unnaturally
formed”; he adds that it is an act of reason thus to separate what is
useless from what is sound.<a name="FnAnchor1463"
href="#Footnote1463"><span class="sp">1463</span></a> But there was no
tendency in Rome to encourage infanticide beyond these limits. While
the Greek policy was to restrain, the Roman policy was to encourage
population. Being engaged in incessant wars of conquest, Rome was
never afraid of being over-populated, but, on the contrary, tried to
increase the number of its citizens by according special privileges to
the fathers of many children, and exempting poor parents from most of
the burden of taxation.<a name="FnAnchor1464"
href="#Footnote1464"><span class="sp">1464</span></a> The power of
life and death which the Roman father possessed over his children
undoubtedly involved the legal right of destroying or exposing newborn
infants; but it is equally certain that the act was in ordinary
circumstances disapproved of.<a name="FnAnchor1465"
href="#Footnote1465"><span class="sp">1465</span></a> An ancient
“law,” ascribed to Romulus&mdash;which according to Mommsen could have
been merely a priestly direction<a name="FnAnchor1466"
href="#Footnote1466"><span class="sp">1466</span></a>&mdash;enjoined
the father to bring up all his sons and at least his eldest daughter,
and forbade him to destroy any well-formed child till it had completed
its third year, when the affection of the parent might be supposed to
be developed.<a name="FnAnchor1467" href="#Footnote1467"><span
class="sp">1467</span></a> In later times we find exposure of children
condemned by poets, historians, philosophers, jurists. Among nefarious
acts committed in sign of grief on the day when Germanicus died
Suetonius mentions the exposure of newborn babes.<a
name="FnAnchor1468" href="#Footnote1468"><span
class="sp">1468</span></a> Epictetus indignantly opposes the saying of
Epicurus that men should not rear children: “Even a sheep will not
desert its young, nor a wolf; and shall a man?”<a name="FnAnchor1469"
href="#Footnote1469"><span class="sp">1469</span></a> <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page240"></a>240</span> Julius Paulus, the
jurist, pronounced him who refused nourishment to his child, or
exposed it in a public place, to be guilty of murder<a
name="FnAnchor1470" href="#Footnote1470"><span
class="sp">1470</span></a>&mdash;a statement which is to be
understood, not as a legal prohibition of exposure, but only as the
expression of a moral opinion.<a name="FnAnchor1471"
href="#Footnote1471"><span class="sp">1471</span></a> On the other
hand, though the exposure of healthy infants was disapproved of in
Pagan Rome, it was not generally regarded as an offence of very great
magnitude, especially if the parents were destitute.<a
name="FnAnchor1472" href="#Footnote1472"><span
class="sp">1472</span></a> During the Empire it was practised on an
extensive scale, and in the literature of the time it is spoken of
with frigid indifference. Since the life of the victim was frequently
saved by some benevolent person or with a view to profit,<a
name="FnAnchor1473" href="#Footnote1473"><span
class="sp">1473</span></a> it was not looked upon in the light of
downright infanticide, which in the case of a healthy infant seems to
have been strictly prohibited by custom.<a name="FnAnchor1474"

<p>The practice of exposing new-born infants was vehemently denounced
by the early Christian Fathers.<a name="FnAnchor1475"
href="#Footnote1475"><span class="sp">1475</span></a> They tried to
convince men that if the abandoned infant died, the unnatural parent
was guilty of nothing less than murder, while the fact that such
foundlings, girls and boys, were trained up for the service of lust
formed another argument against exposure.<a name="FnAnchor1476"
href="#Footnote1476"><span class="sp">1476</span></a> The enormity of
the crime of causing an infant’s death was enhanced by the notion that
children who had died unbaptised were doomed to eternal perdition.<a
name="FnAnchor1477" href="#Footnote1477"><span
class="sp">1477</span></a> According to a decree of the Council of
Mentz in 852, the penance imposed on the mother was heavier if she
killed an unbaptised than if she killed a baptised child.<a
name="FnAnchor1478" href="#Footnote1478"><span
class="sp">1478</span></a> In the year 1556 Henry II. of France made a
law which punished as a child-murderess any woman who had concealed
her pregnancy and delivery, and whose child was found dead, “privé,
tant du saint sacrement de baptesme, que <span class="pagenum"><a

name="FnAnchor1481" href="#Footnote1481"><span
class="sp">1481</span></a>&mdash;thus went so far as to constitute a
presumptive murder, avowedly under the influence of that Christian
dogma to which Lecky generously attributes, in the first instance,
“the healthy sense of the value and sanctity of infant life which so
broadly distinguishes Christian from Pagan societies.”<a

<p>If the Pagans had been comparatively indifferent to the sufferings
of the exposed infant, the Christians became all the more cruel to the
unfortunate mother, who, perhaps in a fit of despair, had put to death
her new-born child. The Christian emperor Valentinian I. made
infanticide a capital offence.<a name="FnAnchor1483"
href="#Footnote1483"><span class="sp">1483</span></a> According to the
‘Coutume de Loudunois,’ a mother who killed her child was burned.<a
name="FnAnchor1484" href="#Footnote1484"><span
class="sp">1484</span></a> In Germany and Switzerland she was buried
alive with a pale thrust through her body;<a name="FnAnchor1485"
href="#Footnote1485"><span class="sp">1485</span></a> this punishment
was prescribed by the criminal code of Charles V., side by side with
drowning.<a name="FnAnchor1486" href="#Footnote1486"><span
class="sp">1486</span></a> Until the end of the eighteenth or the
beginning of the nineteenth century infanticide was a capital crime
everywhere in Europe, except in Russia.<a name="FnAnchor1487"
href="#Footnote1487"><span class="sp">1487</span></a> Then, under the
humanising influence of that rationalistic movement which compelled
men to rectify so many preconceived opinions,<a name="FnAnchor1488"
href="#Footnote1488"><span class="sp">1488</span></a> it became
manifest that an unmarried woman who destroys her illegitimate child
is not in the same category as an ordinary murderess.<a
name="FnAnchor1489" href="#Footnote1489"><span
class="sp">1489</span></a> It was pointed out that shame and fear, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242"></a>242</span> excitement of
mind, and the difficulty in rearing a poor bastard, could induce the
unfortunate mother to commit a crime which she herself abhorred. That
no notice had been taken of all this is explicable from the extreme
severity with which female unchastity was looked upon by the Church.
At present most European law-books do not punish infanticide committed
by an unmarried woman even nominally with death.<a name="FnAnchor1490"
href="#Footnote1490"><span class="sp">1490</span></a> In France the
law which regards infanticide as an aggravated form of
<i>meurtre</i><a name="FnAnchor1491" href="#Footnote1491"><span
class="sp">1491</span></a> has become a dead letter;<a
name="FnAnchor1492" href="#Footnote1492"><span
class="sp">1492</span></a> and Stephen wrote in 1888 that in England
no woman seems for a long time to have been executed for killing her
new-born child under the distress of mind and fear of shame caused by
childbirth.<a name="FnAnchor1493" href="#Footnote1493"><span
class="sp">1493</span></a> Yet the law takes its grim course. The
Judge dons his black cap, the death sentence is pronounced, and
although reprieve is certain, the unfortunate prisoner is condemned to
cruel and unnecessary mental torture. In order to put an end to this
gruesome formality, Lord Dawson’s Infanticide Bill, which was given a
second reading in the House of Lords shortly before this was written,
provided that a woman proved guilty of causing the death of her baby,
under the age of twelve months, should be convicted of manslaughter
and not of murder.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the custom of infanticide goes feticide, or the
destruction of the embryo before it has left the mother’s womb. In
ancient Greece, as we have seen, it was in certain circumstances
recommended by Plato and Aristotle, in preference to infanticide. In
Rome it was prohibited by Septimius Severus and Antoninus, but the

<p>Very different opinions were held by the Christians. A sanctity,
previously unheard of, was attached to human life from the very
beginning. Feticide was regarded as a form of murder. “Prevention of
birth,” says Tertullian, “is a precipitation of murder; nor does it
matter whether one take away a life when formed, or drive it away
while forming. He also is a man who is about to be one. Even every
fruit already exists in its seed.”<a name="FnAnchor1500"
href="#Footnote1500"><span class="sp">1500</span></a> Augustine,
again, makes a distinction between an embryo which has already been
formed and an embryo as yet unformed. From the creation of Adam, he
says, it appears that the body is made before the soul. Before the
embryo has been endowed with a soul it is an <i>embryo informatus</i>,
and its artificial abortion is to be punished with a fine only; but
the <i>embryo formatus</i> is an animate being, and to destroy it is
nothing less than murder, a crime punishable with death.<a
name="FnAnchor1501" href="#Footnote1501"><span
class="sp">1501</span></a> This distinction between an animate and
inanimate fetus was embodied both in Canon<a name="FnAnchor1502"
href="#Footnote1502"><span class="sp">1502</span></a> and Justinian
law,<a name="FnAnchor1503" href="#Footnote1503"><span

from which the fetus was considered to be animate a curious
distinction was drawn between the male and the female fetus. The
former was regarded as <i>animatus</i> forty days after its

was derived, as it seems, either from an absurd misinterpretation of
<i>Leviticus</i> xii. 2&mdash;5, or from the views of Aristotle (<i>De

Justinian Code, who fixed the animation of the female, as well as of
the male, fetus at forty days after its conception; and this view was
adopted by later jurists (Spangenberg, in <i>Neues Archiv des

<p>The criminality of artificial abortion was increased by the belief
that an <i>embryo formatus</i>, being endowed with an immortal soul,
was in need of baptism for its salvation. In his highly esteemed
treatise ‘De Fide,’ written in the sixth century, Fulgentius says: “It
is to be believed beyond doubt that not only men who are come to the
use of reason, but infants, whether they die in their mother’s womb,
or after they are born, without baptism, in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, are punished with everlasting punishment in
eternal fire, because, though they have no actual sin of their own,
yet they carry along with them the condemnation of original sin from
their first conception and birth.”<a name="FnAnchor1506"
href="#Footnote1506"><span class="sp">1506</span></a> And in the ‘Lex
Bajuwariorum’ this doctrine is expressly referred to in a paragraph
which prescribes a daily compensation for children killed in the womb
on account of the daily suffering of those children in hell.<a
name="FnAnchor1507" href="#Footnote1507"><span
class="sp">1507</span></a> Subsequently, however, Fulgentius’ dictum
was called in question, and no less a person than Thomas Aquinas
suggested the possibility of salvation for an infant who died before
its birth.<a name="FnAnchor1508" href="#Footnote1508"><span
class="sp">1508</span></a> Apart from this, the doctrine that the life
of an embryo is equally sacred with the life of an infant was so much
opposed to popular feelings, that the law concerning feticide had to
be altered. Modern legislation, though treating the fetus as a
distinct being from the moment of its conception,<a
name="FnAnchor1509" href="#Footnote1509"><span
class="sp">1509</span></a> punishes criminal abortion less severely
than infanticide.<a name="FnAnchor1510" href="#Footnote1510"><span
class="sp">1510</span></a> The very frequent occurrence of it is an
evidence of the comparative indifference with which it is practically
looked upon by large numbers of people in Christian countries; and
there is to-day in more than one of these countries a growing demand
for legal facilities of abortion. A moral ground for this demand is
that legalised abortion, allowed only by skilled operators, will kill
off the demand for quack abortion with its direful results.<a

<p>The best preventive against abortion is the use of contraceptives;
it is particularly for this reason that in Soviet Russia instruction
in contraception may be obtained freely by any one seeking it.<a
name="FnAnchor1512" href="#Footnote1512"><span
class="sp">1512</span></a> But any such interference with the course
of nature is contrary to the old Catholic rule that the only
legitimate object of sexual intercourse even between husband and wife
is the continuance of the human species. This rule was confirmed by
the Pope’s encyclical of December 31, 1930, forbidding the use of
contraceptives on the ground that “the connubial act is naturally
designed to evoke new life.”<a name="FnAnchor1513"
href="#Footnote1513"><span class="sp">1513</span></a> Among orthodox
Christians of other confessions we also find, to some extent, the
theory that sexual intercourse is justifiable only as a means of
generation; but it is certainly on the wane. Some interesting
information on this point comes from America. Dr. Katharine B. Davis,
who carried out a study on a thousand educated married women and about
a thousand unmarried college women, put to them the question, “Are
married people justified having intercourse except for the purpose of
having children?” Only a small minority (15·3 per cent.) of those
answering definitely this question replied negatively.<a
name="FnAnchor1514" href="#Footnote1514"><span
class="sp">1514</span></a> The enormous frequency of the use of
contraceptives also bears testimony to people’s feelings concerning
it. The leader in the movement has been France, a largely Catholic
country, where it started in the middle of the last century in the
great cities and in the fertile districts of the south;<a
name="FnAnchor1515" href="#Footnote1515"><span
class="sp">1515</span></a> and the proportion of Catholic women who
apply for advice at Margaret Sanger’s clinic in New York is only one
percentage lower than the proportion of Protestant women.<a
name="FnAnchor1516" href="#Footnote1516"><span
class="sp">1516</span></a> In England the change in public opinion
since the time when Bradlaugh, who was regarded as the protagonist of
the movement, was called “the unsavoury member for Northampton,” has
been enormous.<a name="FnAnchor1517" href="#Footnote1517"><span
class="sp">1517</span></a> Dr. A. W. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page246"></a>246</span> Thomas wrote in 1906: “From my experience
as a general practitioner, I have no hesitation in saying that 90 per
cent. of young married couples of the comfortably-off classes use
preventives”;<a name="FnAnchor1518" href="#Footnote1518"><span
class="sp">1518</span></a> and this rough estimate does not seem to be
over the mark.<a name="FnAnchor1519" href="#Footnote1519"><span
class="sp">1519</span></a> In Germany birth control was very prevalent
before the War,<a name="FnAnchor1520" href="#Footnote1520"><span
class="sp">1520</span></a> and greatly increased afterwards.<a
name="FnAnchor1521" href="#Footnote1521"><span
class="sp">1521</span></a> In the United States 74·11 per cent. of the
985 married women who answered Dr. Davis’s question referring to the
use of contraceptives admitted it.<a name="FnAnchor1522"
href="#Footnote1522"><span class="sp">1522</span></a> At the same time
contraception has still many opponents also in Protestant countries,
and not only on political grounds as lowering the birth-rate. In
Denmark there seems to be quite a widespread feeling against it.<a
name="FnAnchor1523" href="#Footnote1523"><span
class="sp">1523</span></a> But it is obvious that those who condemn it
are defending a lost cause. Even among Anglican clericals there has in
this respect been a decisive breach with ecclesiastical tradition.
Though the 15th Resolution of the Lambeth Conference of 1930
concerning the use of contraceptives by Christians was so carefully
conditioned that it might well appear practically valueless, the large
Committee of Bishops who considered the subject of marriage and sex
frankly stated in their ‘Report’ that the prohibition of the use of
preventive methods is not founded on any directions given in the New
Testament, nor has behind it the authority of any Œcumenical Council
of the Church, and that “the Communion which most strongly condemns in
principle all preventive methods, nevertheless in practice recognises
that there are occasions when a rigid insistence on the principle is
impossible.”<a name="FnAnchor1524" href="#Footnote1524"><span

<p>While, from fear of contaminating anything holy, casual
restrictions have thus been imposed on all kinds of manslayers,
whether murderers or those who have killed an enemy in righteous
warfare, more stringent rules have been laid down for persons
permanently connected with the religious cult. Adair states that the
“holy men” of the North American Indians, like the Jewish priests,
were by their function absolutely forbidden to shed human blood,
“notwithstanding their propensity thereto, even for small injuries.”<a
name="FnAnchor1536" href="#Footnote1536"><span
class="sp">1536</span></a> The Druids of Gaul never went to war; it is
true, they sacrificed human victims to their gods, but those they
burnt.<a name="FnAnchor1537" href="#Footnote1537"><span
class="sp">1537</span></a> The Christian Church, whilst ostentatiously
sticking to her principle that “the Church does not shed blood,”<a
name="FnAnchor1538" href="#Footnote1538"><span
class="sp">1538</span></a> had frequent recourse to the convenient
method of punishing heretics by relegating the execution of the
sentence of death to the civil power, with a prayer that the culprit
should be punished “as mildly as possible and without the effusion of
blood,” that is, by the death of fire.<a name="FnAnchor1539"
href="#Footnote1539"><span class="sp">1539</span></a> To the same
class of facts belong those decrees of the Church which forbade
clergymen taking part in a battle, for which Thomas Aquinas gives the
reason that fighting “tends to the spilling of blood.”<a
name="FnAnchor1540" href="#Footnote1540"><span
class="sp">1540</span></a> It is said that this was taken so literally
that martial prelates in the Middle Ages went into battle with heavy
maces, with which they could pound their enemies into pulp without
breaking the skin.<a name="FnAnchor1541" href="#Footnote1541"><span
class="sp">1541</span></a> If a priest killed a robber in order to
save his life, he had to do penance till his death; the hands which
had to distribute the blood of the Lamb of God were not to be polluted
with the blood of those for whose salvation it was shed.<a

<p>In spite of the early Christians’ condemnation of the punishment of
death, the number of capital offences became considerably greater than
before under the Christian emperors and, in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page249"></a>249</span> Teutonic countries under the Christian
kings.<a name="FnAnchor1544" href="#Footnote1544"><span
class="sp">1544</span></a> During the Middle Ages and later the
severity of the penal codes, in general, increased very greatly; and
the chief explanation of this lies in their connection with despotism
or religion or both.<a name="FnAnchor1545" href="#Footnote1545"><span
class="sp">1545</span></a> Every crime came to be regarded as a crime
against the king. Indeed, breach of the King’s peace became the
foundation of the whole criminal law of England; the right of pardon,
for instance, as a prerogative of the Crown, took its origin in the
fact that the king was supposed to be injured by the crime, and could
therefore waive his remedy.<a name="FnAnchor1546"
href="#Footnote1546"><span class="sp">1546</span></a> But the king was
not only regarded as the fountain of social justice: he was also
regarded as the earthly representative of the heavenly lawgiver and
judge.<a name="FnAnchor1547" href="#Footnote1547"><span
class="sp">1547</span></a> The Christian Church and Christian
governments adopted the Hebrew notions<a name="FnAnchor1548"
href="#Footnote1548"><span class="sp">1548</span></a> that it is man’s
duty to avenge offences against God, that every crime involves a
breach of God’s law and is punishable as such, and that hardly any
punishment is too severe to be inflicted on the ungodly.<a
name="FnAnchor1549" href="#Footnote1549"><span
class="sp">1549</span></a> The principle stated in the Laws of Cnut,
that “it belongs very rightly to a Christian king to avenge God’s
anger very deeply, according as the deed may be,”<a
name="FnAnchor1550" href="#Footnote1550"><span
class="sp">1550</span></a> was acted upon till quite modern times, and
largely contributed to the increasing severity of the penal codes. It
was therefore one of the most important steps towards a more humane
legislation when, in the eighteenth century, this principle was
superseded by the contrary doctrine, “Il faut faire honorer la
Divinité, et ne la venger jamais.”<a name="FnAnchor1551"

<p>In modern times the views of the early Christians regarding capital
punishment have been revived by the Anabaptists<a name="FnAnchor1552"
href="#Footnote1552"><span class="sp">1552</span></a> <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page250"></a>250</span> and the Quakers;<a
name="FnAnchor1553" href="#Footnote1553"><span
class="sp">1553</span></a> but the powerful movement in favour of its
abolition chiefly derives its origin from the writings of Beccaria and
the French Encyclopædists. The great motive force of this movement has
been sympathy with human suffering and horror of the destruction of
human life&mdash;feelings which have been able to operate the more
freely, the less they have been checked either by the belief in the
social expediency of capital punishment, or by the notion of a
vindictive god who can be conciliated only by the death of the
offender. During the last century Western legislation has undergone a
radical change with reference to the punishment of death. In several
European and American States it has been formally abolished, or is
nowadays never inflicted,<a name="FnAnchor1554"
href="#Footnote1554"><span class="sp">1554</span></a> whilst in the
rest it is practically restricted to cases of wilful murder. But it
still has as strenuous advocates as ever. It is said that the
abolition of it would remove one of the best safeguards of society;<a
name="FnAnchor1555" href="#Footnote1555"><span
class="sp">1555</span></a> and, as usual, religion is also called in
to give strength to the argument. Several writers have argued that the
statements in the Bible which command capital punishment have an
obligatory power on all Christian legislators;<a name="FnAnchor1556"
href="#Footnote1556"><span class="sp">1556</span></a> and we meet with
the assertion that its object is not the protection of civil society,
but to carry out the justice of God, in whose name “the judge should
sentence and the executioner strike.”<a name="FnAnchor1557"
href="#Footnote1557"><span class="sp">1557</span></a> But I venture to
believe that the chief motive for retaining the punishment of death in
modern legislation is the strong hold which the principle of talion
has on the minds of legislators as well as on the public mind. This
supposition derives much support from the fact that capital punishment
is popular only in the case of murder. “Blood, it is said, will have
blood, and the imagination is flattered with the notion of the
similarity of the suffering, produced by the punishment, with that
inflicted by the criminal.”<a name="FnAnchor1558"

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In no question of morality was there a greater difference between
classical<a name="FnAnchor1559" href="#Footnote1559"><span
class="sp">1559</span></a> and Christian doctrines than in regard to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251"></a>251</span> suicide. The
Greek tragedians frequently give expression to the notion that suicide
in certain circumstances is becoming to a noble mind.<a
name="FnAnchor1560" href="#Footnote1560"><span
class="sp">1560</span></a> According to the Platonic Socrates,
however, “there may be reason in saying that a man should wait, and
not take his own life until God summons him”;<a name="FnAnchor1561"
href="#Footnote1561"><span class="sp">1561</span></a> and Aristotle
maintains that he who kills himself from rage commits a wrong against
the State.<a name="FnAnchor1562" href="#Footnote1562"><span
class="sp">1562</span></a> But the opinions of the philosophers were
anything but unanimous.<a name="FnAnchor1563"
href="#Footnote1563"><span class="sp">1563</span></a> Plato himself,
in his ‘Laws,’ has no word of censure for him who deprives himself by
violence of his appointed share of life under the compulsion of some
painful and inevitable misfortune, or out of irremediable and
intolerable shame.<a name="FnAnchor1564" href="#Footnote1564"><span
class="sp">1564</span></a> According to Epicurus, we ought to consider
“whether it be better that death should come to us, or we go to
him.”<a name="FnAnchor1565" href="#Footnote1565"><span
class="sp">1565</span></a> The Stoics, especially, advocated suicide
as a relief from all kinds of misery.<a name="FnAnchor1566"
href="#Footnote1566"><span class="sp">1566</span></a> Seneca remarks
that it is a man’s own fault if he suffers, as, by putting an end to
himself, he can put an end to his misery. “As I would choose a ship to
sail in, or a house to live in, so would I choose the most tolerable
death when about to die. . . . Human affairs are in such a happy
situation, that no one need be wretched but by choice. Do you like to
be wretched? Live. Do you like it not? It is in your power to return
from whence you came.”<a name="FnAnchor1567"
href="#Footnote1567"><span class="sp">1567</span></a> Epictetus
opposes indiscriminate suicide on religious grounds: “Friends, wait
for God; when he shall give the signal and release you from this
service, then go to him; but for the present endure to dwell in the
place where he has put you.”<a name="FnAnchor1568"
href="#Footnote1568"><span class="sp">1568</span></a> But such a
signal is given often enough: it may consist in incurable disease,
intolerable pain, or misery of any kind. “Remember this: the door is
open; be not more timid than little children, but as they say, when
the thing does not please them, ‘I will play no longer,’ so do you,
when things seem to you of such a kind, say I will no longer play, and
be gone: but if you stay, do not complain.”<a name="FnAnchor1569"
href="#Footnote1569"><span class="sp">1569</span></a> Pliny says that
the power of dying when you please is the best <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page252"></a>252</span> thing that God has
given to man amidst all the sufferings of life.<a name="FnAnchor1570"

<p>It seems that the Roman people, before the influence of
Christianity made itself felt, regarded suicide with considerable
moral indifference. Vergil enumerates self-murderers not among the
guilty, but among the unfortunate, confounding them with infants who
have died prematurely and persons who have been condemned to die on a
false charge.<a name="FnAnchor1571" href="#Footnote1571"><span
class="sp">1571</span></a> Throughout the whole history of pagan Rome
there was no statute declaring it to be a crime for an ordinary
citizen to take his own life, though it was prohibited in the case of
soldiers.<a name="FnAnchor1572" href="#Footnote1572"><span
class="sp">1572</span></a> The self-murderer’s rights were in no way
affected by his deed, his memory was no less honoured than if he had
died a natural death, his will was recognised by law, and the regular
order of succession was not interfered with.<a name="FnAnchor1573"
href="#Footnote1573"><span class="sp">1573</span></a> On the other
hand, it seems to have been the general opinion in Rome that suicide
in certain circumstances is an heroic and praiseworthy act.<a

<p>The earlier Christian Fathers still allowed, or even approved of,
suicide in certain cases, namely, when committed in order to procure
martyrdom,<a name="FnAnchor1577" href="#Footnote1577"><span

crown of virginity. To bring death upon ourselves voluntarily, says
Lactantius, is a wicked and impious death; “but when urged to the
alternative, either of forsaking God and relinquishing faith, or of
expecting all torture and death, then it is that undaunted in spirit
we defy that death with all its previous threats and terrors which
others fear.”<a name="FnAnchor1578" href="#Footnote1578"><span
class="sp">1578</span></a> Eusebius and other ecclesiastical writers
mention several instances of Christian women putting an end to their
lives when their chastity was in danger, and their acts are spoken of
with tenderness or even <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page253"></a>253</span> admiration, nay some of them were admitted
into the calendar of saints.<a name="FnAnchor1579"
href="#Footnote1579"><span class="sp">1579</span></a> This admission
was due to the extreme honour in which virginity was held; Jerome, who
denied that it was lawful in times of persecution to die by one’s own
hands, made an exception for cases in which a person’s chastity was at
stake.<a name="FnAnchor1580" href="#Footnote1580"><span
class="sp">1580</span></a> But even this exception was abolished by
Augustine. He allows that the virgins who laid violent hands upon
themselves are worthy of compassion, but declares that there was no
necessity for their doing so, since chastity is a virtue of the mind
which is not lost by the body being in captivity to the will and
superior force of another. He argues that there is no passage in the
canonical Scriptures which permits us to destroy ourselves either with
a view to obtaining immortality or to avoiding calamity. On the
contrary, suicide is prohibited in the commandment, “Thou shalt not
kill,” namely, “neither thyself nor another”; for he who kills himself
kills no other but a man.<a name="FnAnchor1581"
href="#Footnote1581"><span class="sp">1581</span></a> This doctrine,
which assimilates suicide with murder, was evidently not the Hebrew
view on the subject, since in the few cases of suicide which are
mentioned in the Old Testament no censure is passed on the perpetrator
of the deed,<a name="FnAnchor1582" href="#Footnote1582"><span
class="sp">1582</span></a> and of Ahithophel it is said that he was
buried in the sepulchre of his father;<a name="FnAnchor1583"
href="#Footnote1583"><span class="sp">1583</span></a> but it became
the doctrine of the Church.<a name="FnAnchor1584"
href="#Footnote1584"><span class="sp">1584</span></a> Nay, self-murder
was declared to be the worst form of murder, “the most grievous thing
of all”;<a name="FnAnchor1585" href="#Footnote1585"><span
class="sp">1585</span></a> Chrysostom had already insisted that “if it
is base to destroy others, much more is it to destroy one’s self.”<a
name="FnAnchor1586" href="#Footnote1586"><span
class="sp">1586</span></a> It was even said that Judas committed a
greater sin in killing himself than in betraying his master Christ to
a certain death.<a name="FnAnchor1587" href="#Footnote1587"><span
class="sp">1587</span></a> The self-murderer was deprived of rights
which were granted to all other criminals. In the sixth century a
Council of Orleans enjoined that “the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page254"></a>254</span> oblations of those who were killed in the
commission of any crime may be received, except of such as laid
violent hands on themselves”;<a name="FnAnchor1588"
href="#Footnote1588"><span class="sp">1588</span></a> and a subsequent
Council denied self-murderers the usual rites of Christian burial.<a

<p>According to the Christian doctrine, as formulated by Thomas
Aquinas, suicide is utterly unlawful for three reasons. First,
everything naturally loves itself and preserves itself in being;
suicide is against a natural inclination and contrary to the charity
which a man ought to bear towards himself, and consequently a mortal
sin. Secondly, by killing himself a person does an injury to the
community of which he is a part. Thirdly, “life is a gift divinely
bestowed on man, and subject to His power who ‘killeth and maketh
alive’; and therefore he who takes his own life sins against God, as
he who kills another man’s slave sins against the master to whom the
slave belongs, and as he who usurps the office of judge on a point not
referred to him; for to God alone belongs judgment of life and
death.”<a name="FnAnchor1590" href="#Footnote1590"><span
class="sp">1590</span></a> The second of the three arguments is
borrowed from Aristotle, and is entirely foreign to the spirit of
early Christianity. The notion of patriotism being a moral duty was
habitually discouraged by it, and, as has been truly observed, “it was
impossible to urge the civic argument against suicide without at the
same time condemning the hermit life, which in the third century
became the ideal of the Church.”<a name="FnAnchor1591"
href="#Footnote1591"><span class="sp">1591</span></a> But certain
other arguments were deeply rooted in some of the fundamental
doctrines of Christianity&mdash;in the sacredness of human life, in
the duty of absolute submission to God’s will, and in the extreme
importance attached to the moment of death. The earthly life is a
preparation for eternity; sufferings which are sent by God are not to
be evaded, but to be endured.<a name="FnAnchor1592"
href="#Footnote1592"><span class="sp">1592</span></a> The man who
deliberately takes away the life which was given him by the Creator
displays the utmost disregard for the will and authority of his
Master; and, worst of all, he does so in the very last minute of his
life, when his doom is sealed for ever. His deed, as Aquinas says, is
“the most dangerous thing of all, because no time is left to expiate
it by repentance.”<a name="FnAnchor1593" href="#Footnote1593"><span
class="sp">1593</span></a> He who kills a fellow-creature does not in
the same degree renounce the protection of God; he kills only the
body, whereas the self-murderer <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page255"></a>255</span> kills both the body and soul.<a
name="FnAnchor1594" href="#Footnote1594"><span
class="sp">1594</span></a> By denying the latter the right of
Christian burial the Church recognises that he has placed himself
outside her pale.</p>

<p>The condemnation of the Church influenced the secular legislation.
The provisions of the Councils were introduced into the law-books. In
France Louis IX. enforced the penalty of confiscating the
self-murderer’s property,<a name="FnAnchor1595"
href="#Footnote1595"><span class="sp">1595</span></a> and laws to the
same effect were passed in other European countries.<a

to that of <i>lèse-majesté</i>.<a name="FnAnchor1597"

law of Scotland, “self-murder is as highly criminal as the killing of

<p>The horror of suicide also found a vent in outrages committed on
the dead body. Of a woman who drowned herself in Edinburgh in 1598 we
are told that her body was “harled through the town backwards, and
thereafter hanged on the gallows.”<a name="FnAnchor1601"
href="#Footnote1601"><span class="sp">1601</span></a> In France, as
late as the middle of the eighteenth century, self-murderers were
dragged upon a hurdle through the streets with the face turned to the
ground; they were then hanged up with the head downwards, and finally
thrown into the common sewer.<a name="FnAnchor1602"
href="#Footnote1602"><span class="sp">1602</span></a> In most cases,
however, the treatment to which suicides’ bodies were subjected was
not meant as a punishment, but was intended to prevent their spirits
from causing mischief. All over Europe wandering tendencies have been
ascribed to their ghosts. In some countries the corpse of a suicide is
supposed to make barren the earth with which it comes in contact, or
to produce hailstorms or tempests or drought. The practice of burying
suicides apart from other <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page256"></a>256</span> dead has been very widespread in Europe,
and in many cases there are obvious indications that it arose from
fear.<a name="FnAnchor1603" href="#Footnote1603"><span
class="sp">1603</span></a> In England persons against whom a coroner’s
jury had found a verdict of <i>felo de se</i> were buried at
cross-roads, with a stake driven through the body in order to prevent
their ghosts from walking&mdash;a custom which was formally abolished
only in 1823 by 4 Geo. IV., c. 52.<a name="FnAnchor1604"
href="#Footnote1604"><span class="sp">1604</span></a> For the same
purpose the bodies of suicides were in many cases burned. And when
removed from the house where the act had been committed, they were
commonly carried out, not by the door, but by a window, or through a
perforation specially made for the occasion in the door, or through a
hole under the threshold, in order that the ghost should not find its
way back into the house, or perhaps with a view to keeping the
entrance of the house free from dangerous infection.<a

may have been buried at cross-roads because the cross was supposed to
disperse the evil energy ascribed to their bodies. Both in Europe and
India the cross-road has since ancient times been a favourite place to
divest oneself of diseases or other evil influences (<i><span

<p>Side by side with the extreme severity with which suicide is viewed
by the Christian Church, however, we find even in the Middle Ages
instances of more humane feelings towards its perpetrator. In mediæval
tales and ballads true lovers die together and are buried in the same
grave; two roses spring through the turf and twine lovingly
together.<a name="FnAnchor1606" href="#Footnote1606"><span
class="sp">1606</span></a> In the later Middle Ages, says Bourquelot,
“on voit qu’à mesure qu’on avance, l’antagonisme devient plus prononcé
entre l’esprit religieux et les idées mondaines relativement à la mort
volontaire. Le clergé continue à suivre la route qui a été tracée par
Saint Augustin et à declarer le suicide criminel et impie; mais la
tristesse et le desespoir n’entendent pas sa voix, ne se souviennent
pas de ses prescriptions.”<a name="FnAnchor1607"
href="#Footnote1607"><span class="sp">1607</span></a> The revival of
classical learning, accompanied as it was by admiration for antiquity
and a desire to imitate its great men, not only increased the number
of suicides, but influenced popular sentiments on the subject.<a
name="FnAnchor1608" href="#Footnote1608"><span
class="sp">1608</span></a> Even the Catholic casuists, and later on
philosophers of the school of Grotius and others, began to distinguish
certain cases of legitimate suicide, such as that committed to avoid
dishonour <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257"></a>257</span> or
probable sin, or that of a condemned person saving himself from
torture by anticipating an inevitable death, or that of a man offering
himself to death for the sake of his friend.<a name="FnAnchor1609"
href="#Footnote1609"><span class="sp">1609</span></a> Sir Thomas More,
in his <i>Utopia</i>, permits a person who is suffering from an
incurable and painful disease to take his own life, provided that he
does so with the agreement of the priests and magistrates; nay, he
even maintains that these should exhort such a man to put an end to a
life which is only a burden to himself and others.<a
name="FnAnchor1610" href="#Footnote1610"><span
class="sp">1610</span></a> Donne, the well-known Dean of St. Paul’s,
wrote in his younger days a book in defence of suicide, “a
Declaration,” as he called it, “of that paradoxe, or thesis, that
Self-homicide is not so naturally sin, that it may never be
otherwise.” He there pointed out the fact&mdash;which ought never to
be overlooked by those who derive their arguments from
“nature”&mdash;that some things may be natural to the species, and yet
not natural to every individual member of it.<a name="FnAnchor1611"
href="#Footnote1611"><span class="sp">1611</span></a> In one of his
essays Montaigne pictures classical cases of suicide with colours of
unmistakable sympathy. “La plus volontaire mort,” he says, “c’est la
plus belle. La vie despend de la volonté d’aultruy; la mort, de la
nostre.”<a name="FnAnchor1612" href="#Footnote1612"><span

<p>The rationalism of the eighteenth century led to numerous attacks
both upon the views of the Church and upon the laws of the State
concerning suicide. Montesquieu advocated its legitimacy:&mdash;“La
société est fondée sur un avantage mutuel; mais lorsqu’elle me devient
onéreuse, qui m’empêche d’y renoncer? La vie m’a été donnée comme une
faveur; je puis done la rendre lorsqu’ elle ne l’est plus: la cause
cesse, l’effet doit donc cesser aussi.”<a name="FnAnchor1613"
href="#Footnote1613"><span class="sp">1613</span></a> Voltaire
strongly opposed the cruel laws which subjected a suicide’s body to
outrage and deprived his children of their heritage.<a
name="FnAnchor1614" href="#Footnote1614"><span
class="sp">1614</span></a> If his act is a wrong against society, what
is to be said of the voluntary homicides committed in war, which are
permitted by the laws of all countries? Are they not much more harmful
to the human race than self-murder, which nature prevents from ever
being practised by any large number of men?<a name="FnAnchor1615"
href="#Footnote1615"><span class="sp">1615</span></a> Beccaria pointed
out <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258"></a>258</span> that the
State is more wronged by the emigrant than by the suicide, since the
former takes his property with him, whereas the latter leaves his
behind.<a name="FnAnchor1616" href="#Footnote1616"><span
class="sp">1616</span></a> According to Holbach, he who kills himself
is guilty of no outrage on nature or its author; on the contrary, he
follows an indication given by nature when he parts from his
sufferings through the only door which has been left open. Nor has his
country or his family any right to complain of a member whom it has no
means of rendering happy, and from whom it consequently has nothing
more to hope.<a name="FnAnchor1617" href="#Footnote1617"><span
class="sp">1617</span></a> Others eulogised suicide when committed for
a noble end,<a name="FnAnchor1618" href="#Footnote1618"><span
class="sp">1618</span></a> or recommended it on certain occasions.
“Suppose,” says Hume, “that it is no longer in my power to promote the
interest of society; suppose that I am a burthen to it; suppose that
my life hinders some person from being much more useful to society. In
such cases my resignation of life must not only be innocent but
laudable.”<a name="FnAnchor1619" href="#Footnote1619"><span
class="sp">1619</span></a> Hume also attacks the doctrine that suicide
is a transgression of our duty to God. “If it would be no crime in me
to divert the Nile from its course, were I able to do so, how could it
be a crime to turn a few ounces of blood from their natural channel?
Were the disposal of human life so much reserved as the peculiar
province of the Almighty that it were an encroachment on his right for
men to dispose of their own lives, would it not be equally wrong of
them to lengthen out their lives beyond the period which by the
general laws of nature he had assigned to it? My death, however
voluntary, does not happen without the consent of Providence; when I
fall upon my own sword, I receive my death equally from the hands of
the Deity as if it had proceeded from a lion, a precipice, or a
fever.”<a name="FnAnchor1620" href="#Footnote1620"><span

<p>Thus the main arguments against suicide which had been set forth by
Christian theologians were scrutinised and found unsatisfactory or at
least insufficient to justify that severe and wholesale censure which
was passed on it by the Church and the State. But a doctrine which has
for ages been inculcated by the leading authorities on morals is not
easily overthrown; and when the old arguments are found fault with new
ones are invented. Kant maintained that a person who disposes of his
own life degrades the humanity subsisting in his person and <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page259"></a>259</span> entrusted to him to the
end that he might uphold it.<a name="FnAnchor1621"
href="#Footnote1621"><span class="sp">1621</span></a> Fichte argued
that it is our duty to preserve our life and to will to live not for
the sake of life, but because our life is the exclusive condition of
the realisation of the moral law through us.<a name="FnAnchor1622"
href="#Footnote1622"><span class="sp">1622</span></a> According to
Hegel it is a contradiction to speak of a person’s right over his
life, since this would imply a right of a person over himself, and no
one can stand above and execute himself.<a name="FnAnchor1623"
href="#Footnote1623"><span class="sp">1623</span></a> Paley, again,
feared that if religion and morality allowed us to kill ourselves in
any case, mankind would have to live in continual alarm for the fate
of their friends and dearest relations<a name="FnAnchor1624"
href="#Footnote1624"><span class="sp">1624</span></a>&mdash;just as if
there were a strong temptation for men to shorten their lives which
could be overcome only by religious and moral prescriptions. But
common sense is neither a metaphysician nor a sophist. When not
restrained by the yoke of a narrow theology, it is inclined in most
cases to regard the self-murderer as a proper object of compassion
rather than of condemnation, and in some instances as a hero. The
legislation on the subject therefore changed as soon as the religious
influence was weakened. The laws against suicide were abolished in
France by the Revolution,<a name="FnAnchor1625"
href="#Footnote1625"><span class="sp">1625</span></a> and afterwards
in various other continental countries;<a name="FnAnchor1626"
href="#Footnote1626"><span class="sp">1626</span></a> whilst in
England it became the custom of jurymen to presume absence of mind in
the self-murderer&mdash;perjury, as Bentham said, being the penance
which prevented an outrage on humanity.<a name="FnAnchor1627"
href="#Footnote1627"><span class="sp">1627</span></a> These measures
undoubtedly indicate not only a greater regard for the innocent
relatives of the self-murderer, but also a change in the moral ideas
concerning the act itself. Durkheim thought that the more lenient
judgment passed on it by the public conscience of the present time is
merely accidental and transient.<a name="FnAnchor1628"
href="#Footnote1628"><span class="sp">1628</span></a> But then he
failed to notice that the chief cause of the extreme severity with
which it was treated in Christian countries was an antiquated
theology, which stands no chance of being revived.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIII</h4>
<h3>CHRISTIANITY AND ECONOMICS</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">J</span><span class="smcap">ESUS’</span> attitude towards the question of
possessions was that we should seek first the kingdom of God and not
to be anxious for the morrow. He allowed everybody to earn his living
by work; many of his parables dealt with the use of money, without any
reproof on account of its possession; he did not denounce ownership in
goods or land, except among the small missionary group of his
immediate disciples. But he condemned wealth, which he regarded as a
peril to the soul.</p>
<p>The story of the rich young ruler who was told by Jesus that he
would have treasure in heaven if he sold all that he had and
distributed to the poor, was regarded by the early Christians as a
counsel of perfection. It was apparently followed by many of the
adherents to the little community of believers at Jerusalem which is
mentioned in Acts.<a name="FnAnchor1629" href="#Footnote1629"><span
class="sp">1629</span></a> The essence of its primitive communism was
the formation of a common fund, which was applied in the first
instance to the relief of the necessities of the poorer members; but
another outstanding feature of the community was fellowship expressed
in common meals. The communistic organisation of the little Church in
Jerusalem may have been an isolated experiment&mdash;Paul knows
nothing of such communism<a name="FnAnchor1630"
href="#Footnote1630"><span class="sp">1630</span></a>&mdash;but the
common fund maintained by weekly subscription from rich and poor of
which he speaks, the relief of the necessities of the poorer members,
and the expression of the spirit of brotherhood in the Agape or
Love-feast, became normal features of Church-life.<a
name="FnAnchor1631" href="#Footnote1631"><span
class="sp">1631</span></a> On the other hand, the surrender of private
property was fundamental in monastic communism. “The principle is that
the monk may <i>possess</i> nothing&mdash;nothing whatsoever&mdash;may
look on nothing as his own, but must always recognise that whatever he
may have for his personal use is all the common property of the
community and that he must not have anything at all except what the
abbot has given him or permitted him to have.”<a name="FnAnchor1632"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page261"></a>261</span> The patristic
view was that this principle was the most perfect way of life, but
that for mankind in general some organisation of ownership became
necessary, human nature being what it is. Clement of Alexandria argues
that if the gospel required men to renounce their worldly possessions,
it would be impossible for them to fulfil our Saviour’s injunctions to
feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and so forth; and the precepts of
the Gospel would be found at variance with each other.<a
name="FnAnchor1633" href="#Footnote1633"><span
class="sp">1633</span></a> But wealth is like a viper, which is
harmless if man knows how to take hold of it, though if he does not,
it will twine round his hand and bite him.<a name="FnAnchor1634"
href="#Footnote1634"><span class="sp">1634</span></a> Wealth
ill-directed is the citadel of wickedness, and they who are earnest
about their salvation must understand that all possession is for
use.<a name="FnAnchor1635" href="#Footnote1635"><span
class="sp">1635</span></a> Property is limited to the necessary
minimum of existence; all that is superfluous must be given away. But
for different positions in life the existence minimum which is
permitted is different.<a name="FnAnchor1636"
href="#Footnote1636"><span class="sp">1636</span></a> According to
Ambrose, it was the will of God that the earth should be the common
possession of men, and should furnish its fruits to all; hence it is
just that the man who claims for his private ownership that which was
given to the human race in common should at least distribute some of
this to the poor.<a name="FnAnchor1637" href="#Footnote1637"><span
class="sp">1637</span></a> So also Augustine maintains that the right
of possession is limited by the use to which it is put, and that a man
who does not use his property rightly has no valid claim to it.<a
name="FnAnchor1638" href="#Footnote1638"><span

of the Donatists to hold as their property that which they had

<p>Similar doctrines are laid down by Gratian, the compiler of the
Canon Law in the twelfth century. He says that by the law of nature
all things are common to all men, and that private property is lawful
only as an accommodation to the imperfect and vicious character of
human nature.<a name="FnAnchor1640" href="#Footnote1640"><span
class="sp">1640</span></a> He cites a passage from Ambrose denouncing
as unjust and avaricious the man who consumes in luxury what might
have supplied the needs of those who are in want, and refers to a
saying which he attributes to Jerome, to the effect that a man who
keeps for himself more than he needs is guilty of taking that which
belongs to another.<a name="FnAnchor1641" href="#Footnote1641"><span
class="sp">1641</span></a> At the same time, however, he appeals to
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262"></a>262</span> authority of
Augustine when he urges that the needs of different people vary, and
that the rich are therefore not required to use the same food as the
poor, but may have such food as their infirmity has made necessary for
them, though they ought to lament the fact that they require this
indulgence.<a name="FnAnchor1642" href="#Footnote1642"><span
class="sp">1642</span></a> These principles are somewhat modified by
Thomas Aquinas. According to him private property, while not an
institution of the natural law is not contrary to it, but a thing
added to it by human reason.<a name="FnAnchor1643"
href="#Footnote1643"><span class="sp">1643</span></a> And it is not
only lawful for a man to have property of his own, but also necessary
to human life for various reasons: because every one is more careful
to look after a thing that is his own private concern than after what
is common to all or to many; because there would be confusion if every
one indiscriminately took the management of anything he pleased; and
because a peaceful state of society is thus better ensured, every one
being contented with his own lot, whereas disputes arise not
uncommonly among those who have any possession in joint stock. But a
man ought not to hold exterior goods so exclusively as his own, that
he does not readily share them with others in their need.<a
name="FnAnchor1644" href="#Footnote1644"><span
class="sp">1644</span></a> Aquinas even maintains that if “a need be
so plain and pressing that clearly the urgent necessity has to be
relieved from whatever comes to hand, as when danger is threatening a
person and there is no other means of succouring him, then the man may
lawfully relieve his distress out of the property of another, taking
it either openly or secretly; nor does this proceeding properly bear
the stamp of either theft or robbery.”<a name="FnAnchor1645"
href="#Footnote1645"><span class="sp">1645</span></a> But it is only
his superfluity that a person is obliged to distribute in alms: every
one must first provide for himself and for those the care of whom is
incumbent on him, and not deprive himself of so much of his own goods
that he becomes unable to pass his life suitably to his state and to
the calls of business. Yet it is praiseworthy to do so in the case of
extreme need in some private person or in the commonwealth.<a

<p>In conformity with the doctrine that if a man possesses more than
he needs, he has no personal right to it by natural law, but is only a
steward of God, as well as with the direct teaching of Christ,
almsgiving became one of the chief instruments of salvation. Very soon
the charitable activity merged itself in ascetic achievements whose
principal aim was not to help the poor but to secure eternal life for
the donor. In the ‘Didache’ <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page263"></a>263</span> it is said: “If thou hast anything, by thy
hands thou shalt give a ransom for thy sins.”<a name="FnAnchor1647"
href="#Footnote1647"><span class="sp">1647</span></a> Countless times
is the thought expressed that almsgiving is a safe investment of money
at good interest with God in heaven.<a name="FnAnchor1648"
href="#Footnote1648"><span class="sp">1648</span></a> Cyprian
establishes an arithmetical relation between the number of
alms-offerings and the blotting out of sins.<a name="FnAnchor1649"
href="#Footnote1649"><span class="sp">1649</span></a> According to
Augustine, “God is to be propitiated for past sins by alms”; and at
the Last Judgment the decision turns on almsgiving.<a
name="FnAnchor1650" href="#Footnote1650"><span
class="sp">1650</span></a> He also speaks of the mitigation obtained
by departed souls through the alms of survivors, as well as through
the Mass, saying that there are many souls not good enough to be able
to dispense with this provision, and not bad enough not to be
benefited by it.<a name="FnAnchor1651" href="#Footnote1651"><span
class="sp">1651</span></a> “The food of the needy,” says Leo the
Great, “is the purchase-money of the kingdom of heaven.”<a
name="FnAnchor1652" href="#Footnote1652"><span
class="sp">1652</span></a> “As long as the market lasts,” says
Chrysostom, “let us buy alms, or rather let us purchase salvation
through alms.”<a name="FnAnchor1653" href="#Footnote1653"><span
class="sp">1653</span></a> The habit was gradually introduced to
redeem with alms, after the fashion of the Teutonic <i>wergeld</i>,
the various penitential penalties. The rich man is only a debtor; all
that he possesses beyond what is necessary, belongs to the poor, and
ought to be given to them.<a name="FnAnchor1654"
href="#Footnote1654"><span class="sp">1654</span></a> The poor, no
longer looked down upon, became tools of salvation. To them was given
the first place in the church and in the Christian community.
Chrysostom says of them: “As fountains flow near the place of prayer
that the hands that are about to be raised to heaven may be washed, so
were the poor placed by our fathers near to the door of the church,
that our hands might be consecrated by benevolence before they are
raised to God.”<a name="FnAnchor1655" href="#Footnote1655"><span
class="sp">1655</span></a> Gregory the Great announces, and the Middle
Ages re-echo: “The poor are not to be lightly esteemed and despised,
but to be honoured as patrons.”<a name="FnAnchor1656"

<p>It has been claimed that the virtue of charity “is beyond dispute
one of the greatest gifts which Christianity has bestowed on the
world.”<a name="FnAnchor1657" href="#Footnote1657"><span
class="sp">1657</span></a> As to this it may be pointed out that it
has also, since ancient times, been very prominent among the civilised
nations of the East and often strenuously enjoined <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page264"></a>264</span> by their religions;<a
name="FnAnchor1658" href="#Footnote1658"><span
class="sp">1658</span></a> and that the Christian insistence on it
belonged to its Jewish inheritance.<a name="FnAnchor1659"
href="#Footnote1659"><span class="sp">1659</span></a> “The Hebrew race
throughout its entire history, has been endowed with a peculiar sense
of responsibility for its weaker brethren, and in modern life is
excelled by no element in any community in thoroughness and
magnificence of organised charity.”<a name="FnAnchor1660"
href="#Footnote1660"><span class="sp">1660</span></a> Nor can we blame
the ancient Greeks and Romans for neglecting their poor. Among them
slavery in a great measure replaced pauperism; and what slavery did
for the very poor, the Roman system of clientage did for those of a
somewhat higher rank.<a name="FnAnchor1661" href="#Footnote1661"><span
class="sp">1661</span></a> Moreover, the relief of the indigent was an
important function of the State.<a name="FnAnchor1662"
href="#Footnote1662"><span class="sp">1662</span></a> The Areopagus
provided public works for the poor.<a name="FnAnchor1663"
href="#Footnote1663"><span class="sp">1663</span></a> At Rome
gratuitous distribution of corn was the rule for many centuries;<a
name="FnAnchor1664" href="#Footnote1664"><span
class="sp">1664</span></a> agrarian laws furnished free homesteads to
the landless on conquered or public territory.<a name="FnAnchor1665"
href="#Footnote1665"><span class="sp">1665</span></a> Nerva enjoined
the support of poor children in all the cities of Italy.<a
name="FnAnchor1666" href="#Footnote1666"><span
class="sp">1666</span></a> The tablet Veleia records the charitable
measures adopted by Trajan, which were continued by Hadrian.<a
name="FnAnchor1667" href="#Footnote1667"><span
class="sp">1667</span></a> All the emperors from Vespasian to Marcus
Aurelius made liberal provision for the higher studies.<a
name="FnAnchor1668" href="#Footnote1668"><span
class="sp">1668</span></a> But while the emperors were responding to
the call of charity by using the resources of the State, private
benevolence is said to have been even more active. Friedländer writes
that the rich and great were always expected to employ their excess
both to support the poor and to allow them to participate largely in
their own pleasures and to afford them advantages and amusements in
which the modern world gives them no share. In public buildings,
institutions, and feeding the poor private generosity went hand in
hand with communal <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page265"></a>265</span> activity. “Endowments, gifts, and legacies
for purchase of oil and meal for free distribution or cheap sale were
frequent and endowments to put poor parents in the position to educate
their children up to wage-earning age not unusual.”<a
name="FnAnchor1669" href="#Footnote1669"><span
class="sp">1669</span></a> Nor were the aged and the sick forgotten.
The countless gifts and legacies to the colleges, which were the
refuge of the poor in that age, in every region of the Roman world,
are an irresistible proof of an overflowing charity. Dill says that
Pliny had a conception of the uses and responsibilities of wealth
which, in spite of the teaching of Galilee, is not yet very common;
“although he was not a very wealthy man, he acted up to his principles
on a scale and proportion which only a few of our millionaires have
yet reached.” And Pliny, whose lavish generosity is a commonplace of
social history, is only a shining example of a numerous class of more
obscure benefactors, as the stone records abundantly tell those who
care to read them.<a name="FnAnchor1670" href="#Footnote1670"><span
class="sp">1670</span></a> Stoicism inculcated the duty of charity.
“The wise man will help those who weep, but not imitate them. He will
give his hand to the shipwrecked, hospitality to the exile, and aid to
the poor; not proudly, like many who wish to seem compassionate, . . .
but like a man who helps his fellow-men on account of the universal
brotherhood.”<a name="FnAnchor1671" href="#Footnote1671"><span
class="sp">1671</span></a> Beneficence and liberality are “virtues
that are the most agreeable to the nature of man.”<a
name="FnAnchor1672" href="#Footnote1672"><span
class="sp">1672</span></a> Peabody observes: “It was in this soil of
the surviving traditions of Rome and the still flourishing traditions
of Israel that the philanthropy of the Christian religion took root.
Without such a soil Christian charity would have been a seed sown by
the wayside.”<a name="FnAnchor1673" href="#Footnote1673"><span

<p>There was, however, an essential difference between the charity of
the Christians and that taught by the Stoics. Among the former
indiscriminate almsgiving was looked upon as a duty, in accordance
with the precept given by Jesus: “Give to him that asketh thee, and
from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.” Hermas said
that they who receive without a real need shall give an account for it
to God, whereas “he that gives shall be innocent; for he has fulfilled
his duty as he received it from God; not making any choice to whom he
should give, and to whom not.”<a name="FnAnchor1674"
href="#Footnote1674"><span class="sp">1674</span></a> In a much later
age Thomas Aquinas denied that it is our duty to give alms to a <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page266"></a>266</span> person who is not in
need,<a name="FnAnchor1675" href="#Footnote1675"><span
class="sp">1675</span></a> but nevertheless raised the question
whether we are bound to do the work of mercy to a distressed client if
there is an appearance of possible relief for him by his own exertions
or otherwise, and answered it by saying that “you are not absolutely
bound under pain of sin to relieve his distress; though if you do
relieve him without such absolute obligation, your generosity is to be
commended”<a name="FnAnchor1676" href="#Footnote1676"><span
class="sp">1676</span></a>&mdash;though he might do it himself by his
own exertions. A different spirit meets us in the sayings of Seneca.
The wise man “will choose out the worthiest with the utmost care, and
never give without sufficient reason; for unwise gifts must be
reckoned among foolish extravagances; his purse will open easily, but
never leak.”<a name="FnAnchor1677" href="#Footnote1677"><span
class="sp">1677</span></a> “He errs who thinks it easy to give alms;
it is very difficult, if they are to be distributed with any purpose,
and not merely thrown away by chance. . . . Never do I take more pains
in any investments than in these.”<a name="FnAnchor1678"
href="#Footnote1678"><span class="sp">1678</span></a> “Giving to a
base man is neither noble nor generous.”<a name="FnAnchor1679"
href="#Footnote1679"><span class="sp">1679</span></a> Cicero likewise
points out that the virtues of beneficence and liberality involve many
precautionary considerations. Thus “we are to take care lest our
kindness should hurt both those whom it is meant to assist and
others,” and “it ought to be rendered to each in proportion to his
worth”; “they who do kindnesses which prove of disservice to the
person they pretend to oblige, should not be esteemed beneficent nor
generous, but injurious sycophants.”<a name="FnAnchor1680"
href="#Footnote1680"><span class="sp">1680</span></a> Again, whilst
among the Christians attention was concentrated on the supposed profit
which almsgiving brought to the bestower, Seneca laid down the rule,
“Give the kindness for its own sake, thinking only of the receiver’s
interests.”<a name="FnAnchor1681" href="#Footnote1681"><span

<p>In one respect, however, Christian charity was not always
unlimited. In the Epistles of the New Testament the love spoken of
frequently refers to the brotherhood of believers only.<a
name="FnAnchor1682" href="#Footnote1682"><span
class="sp">1682</span></a> Clement of Rome insists that charity shall
be “without respect of persons, alike towards all such as religiously
fear God.”<a name="FnAnchor1683" href="#Footnote1683"><span
class="sp">1683</span></a> The principle of the Church was, “Omnem
hominem <em>fidelem</em> tuum esse fratrem.” As an instance of this may
be mentioned the attempts made in the latter part of the Middle Ages
by Councils and sovereigns to abolish the ancient custom of seizing
the goods of persons who had been shipwrecked: they concerned
Christian sailors only, whereas the robbing of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page267"></a>267</span> shipwrecked infidels
was not prohibited.<a name="FnAnchor1684" href="#Footnote1684"><span
class="sp">1684</span></a> Nor was that principle followed by the
Catholics alone: in the seventeenth century the Scotch clergy taught
that food and shelter must on no occasion be given to a starving man
unless his opinions were orthodox.<a name="FnAnchor1685"
href="#Footnote1685"><span class="sp">1685</span></a> How different
was the Stoic maxim that the wise man will give his hand to the
shipwrecked and aid to the poor on account of the universal
brotherhood. Among the Jews also we meet with a rule of similar
loftiness: it is said in the Talmud, with reference to the treatment
of the poor, that no distinction should be made between such as are
Jews and such as are not.<a name="FnAnchor1686"

<p>Thus it cannot be denied that the kind of charity which was
established by Christianity and continued during the longest period of
its existence suffered from grave defects, in theory and practice,
which had been avoided outside its pale and are utterly condemned by
enlightened moral opinion. The ideal of poverty, which was supported
both by the belief in the redeeming effect of almsgiving and the
teaching of Jesus, and the desire to imitate his own poor life and
that of his apostles, led to the breeding of parasites and beggars,
hordes of whom were turned out by the mendicant orders in particular.
It also led to the depreciation of work. It is true that the contempt
in which manual labour was held by the ancient pagans<a
name="FnAnchor1687" href="#Footnote1687"><span
class="sp">1687</span></a> could not be shared by the early
Christians. Jesus had been born in a carpenter’s family, his apostles
belonged to the working class, and so did originally most of his
followers. Origen accepts with pride the reproach of Celsus, when he
accuses Christians of worshipping the son of a poor workwoman, who had
earned her bread by spinning,<a name="FnAnchor1688"
href="#Footnote1688"><span class="sp">1688</span></a> and contrasts
with the wisdom of Plato, that of Paul the tent-maker, of Peter, the
fisherman, of John, who had abandoned his father’s nets.<a
name="FnAnchor1689" href="#Footnote1689"><span
class="sp">1689</span></a> In the Epistles to the Thessalonians the
duty of personal industry is pressed on them; “if any would not work,
neither should he eat.”<a name="FnAnchor1690"
href="#Footnote1690"><span class="sp">1690</span></a> But the teaching
of Jesus makes it quite plain that he considered work of value only in
so far as it is necessary to life; all that men have to do is to live
by the day, trusting their heavenly Father <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page268"></a>268</span> to provide for the morrow. The ancient
Fathers also say remarkably little about work; the significance of
labour in a calling for the exercise of the Christian life and the
furtherance of the kingdom of God is never expressed by any of them.<a
name="FnAnchor1691" href="#Footnote1691"><span
class="sp">1691</span></a> In the original sinless state of mankind
labour was unknown. It was to punish man for his disobedience that God
caused him to eat daily bread in the sweat of his face.<a
name="FnAnchor1692" href="#Footnote1692"><span
class="sp">1692</span></a> Since then work is a necessity; but the
contemplative life is better than the active life.<a
name="FnAnchor1693" href="#Footnote1693"><span
class="sp">1693</span></a> Bonaventura points out that Jesus preferred
the meditating Mary to the busy Martha,<a name="FnAnchor1694"
href="#Footnote1694"><span class="sp">1694</span></a> and that he
himself seems to have done no work till his thirtieth year.<a
name="FnAnchor1695" href="#Footnote1695"><span
class="sp">1695</span></a> Work is of no value by itself; its highest
object is to further contemplation, to macerate the body, to curb
concupiscence.<a name="FnAnchor1696" href="#Footnote1696"><span
class="sp">1696</span></a> For this purpose, indeed, it was strongly
insisted upon by several founders of religious orders. According to
St. Benedict, “idleness is an enemy to the soul; and therefore at
certain seasons the brethren ought to occupy themselves in the labour
of their hands, and at others in holy reading.”<a name="FnAnchor1697"
href="#Footnote1697"><span class="sp">1697</span></a> St. Bernard
writes: “The handmaid of Christ ought always to pray, to read, to
work, lest haply the spirit of uncleanness should lead astray the
slothful mind. The delight of the flesh is overcome by labour. . . .
The body tired by work is less delighted with vice.”<a
name="FnAnchor1698" href="#Footnote1698"><span
class="sp">1698</span></a> But the active life must not be pursued to
such an extent as to hinder what it is intended to promote; for it is
impossible for any man to be at once occupied with exterior actions
and at the same time apply himself to divine contemplation.<a
name="FnAnchor1699" href="#Footnote1699"><span
class="sp">1699</span></a> Thomas Aquinas says that while he who has
nothing else to live upon is bound to work, it is a sin to try to
acquire riches beyond the limit of those which are necessary to his
life according to his rank and station.<a name="FnAnchor1700"

<p>However restricted was the amount of work which might <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page269"></a>269</span> serve as a source of
income, the acquisition of money without work was prohibited in the
ecclesiastical legislation on the subject of “usury.” This word did
not signify, as nowadays, an excessive rate of interest on a loan, but
the taking of any payment for a loan of money. At first the
prohibition of lending money for gain was a disciplinary regulation
binding only on the clergy, but it was subsequently extended to the
laity in Western Europe by the capitularies of Charles the Great and
various Councils. It was ordained that manifest usurers should not be
admitted to communion, nor, if they died in their sin, receive
Christian burial, and that no priest should accept their alms. The
wills of unrepentant usurers&mdash;of usurers who did not make
restitution&mdash;should be without validity; and any person who
denied that usury was a sin should be treated as a heretic.<a
name="FnAnchor1701" href="#Footnote1701"><span
class="sp">1701</span></a> The prohibition of usury was in the first
place an attempt to enforce the precept, “Lend, hoping for nothing
again,”<a name="FnAnchor1702" href="#Footnote1702"><span
class="sp">1702</span></a> but it was also supported by references to
the Jewish law (<i>Exodus</i> xxii. 25), which only permitted interest
to be taken from aliens,<a name="FnAnchor1703"
href="#Footnote1703"><span class="sp">1703</span></a> while the evils
of usury were abundantly illustrated by the grievous results exercised
by that practised by the Jews.<a name="FnAnchor1704"
href="#Footnote1704"><span class="sp">1704</span></a> There was
further the feeling that usury was an exploitation of distress, and,
as Leo X. ruled in the fifth Lateran Council, an “attempt to draw
profit and increment, without labour, without cost, and without risk,
out of the use of a thing that does not fructify.” In those days there
was but a very small field for the investment of capital;<a
name="FnAnchor1705" href="#Footnote1705"><span
class="sp">1705</span></a> and as ample security was usually given for
the return of the money lent, and the alternative to lending was that
the money remained idle in the hands of its possessor, he was just in
the same position when his money came back to him as if he had never
parted with it. In the sixteenth century the theory arose that not all
taking of reward was usurious, but only the taking more than a certain
percentage.<a name="FnAnchor1706" href="#Footnote1706"><span

<p>A particularly difficult question was that of trade. It was suspect
from the ascetic point of view because it assumed pleasure in
possession and in gain, and it was suspect from the point of view of
the principle of love because it meant taking away from one to give to
another and enriching oneself at the expense of others; as the trader
does not himself add to the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page270"></a>270</span> value of his wares, and yet gains more for
them than he has paid, his gain&mdash;it was argued&mdash;must be
another’s loss.<a name="FnAnchor1707" href="#Footnote1707"><span
class="sp">1707</span></a> Even Augustine wrote that business is
itself an evil, because “it turns men from seeking true rest, which is
God.”<a name="FnAnchor1708" href="#Footnote1708"><span
class="sp">1708</span></a> More sober churchmen, such as Leo the
Great, however, replied that, it is the way in which a man carries on
his trade that determines whether it is good or bad: “The nature of
their gains either excuses or condemns the trafficker, because there
is an honourable and a base kind of profit.”<a name="FnAnchor1709"
href="#Footnote1709"><span class="sp">1709</span></a> So also Aquinas
admits that gain “does not essentially involve any element of vice,”
since there is nothing to hinder it from being referred to an end
which is necessary or even honourable. Thus it is lawful when the
trader refers the moderate gain which he seeks to the sustenance of
his family or to the relief of the distressed, or when he “applies to
trade on behalf of the public interest, that the necessaries of life
may not be wanting to his country, and seeks gain, not as an end, but
as the wages of his labour.”<a name="FnAnchor1710"
href="#Footnote1710"><span class="sp">1710</span></a> In any case, “to
sell a thing dearer or buy it cheaper than it is worth, is a
proceeding in itself unjust and unlawful.”<a name="FnAnchor1711"
href="#Footnote1711"><span class="sp">1711</span></a> But what is the
just price, representing the value of a thing? Aquinas maintained that
prices should correspond with the labour and costs of the producer,
though they may vary with “the diversity of place or time.”<a
name="FnAnchor1712" href="#Footnote1712"><span
class="sp">1712</span></a> To him value was something objective,
something outside the will of the individual purchaser or seller,
something attached to the thing itself, existing whether he liked it
or not, and that he ought to recognise.<a name="FnAnchor1713"
href="#Footnote1713"><span class="sp">1713</span></a> The principle of
the Roman law, on the other hand, had been that the price of a thing
was entirely a matter to be determined by free contract;<a
name="FnAnchor1714" href="#Footnote1714"><span
class="sp">1714</span></a> and so also several Schoolmen of the
fourteenth century, emphasising the subjective element in value,
insisted that the essence of value was utility, and drew the
conclusion that a fair price was most likely to be reached under
freedom of contract, since the mere fact that a bargain had been
struck showed that both parties were satisfied.<a name="FnAnchor1715"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page271"></a>271</span> While trade,
when conducted properly, was admitted to laymen, Aquinas rules that it
must not be practised by clerics, who “ought to abstain, not only from
things in themselves evil, but also from things that have the
appearance of evil.” This observation applies to trade “both because
it refers to earthly gain, of which the clergy ought to be despisers;
as also because of the vices frequently found in persons engaged in
trade,” a merchant being “hardly free from sins of the lips”
(<i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxvi. 28); and because trade too much entangles
the soul in secular cares and withdraws from spirituality; hence the
Apostle says: “No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with
secular business” (<i>2 Timothy</i> ii. 4).<a name="FnAnchor1716"
href="#Footnote1716"><span class="sp">1716</span></a> As a matter of
fact, however, this rule was constantly transgressed. From time to
time complaints are made that priests engage in trade, as also that
they take usury; and from the middle of the thirteenth century a
continuous wail arises against the avarice of the Church.<a

href="#Footnote1718"><span class="sp">1718</span></a> She capitalised
the fear of purgatory by selling exemptions from torment, and went

“indulgence.”</p>

<p>This state of things was from the outset denounced by the
Reformers. But in other respects their attitude in economic matters
was far from revolutionary. “In the sixteenth century,” says Mr.
Tawney, “religious teachers of all shades of opinion still searched
the Bible, the Fathers, and the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i> for light
on practical questions of social morality, and, as far as the first
generation of reformers was concerned, there was no intention, among
either Lutherans, or Calvinists, or Anglicans, of relaxing the rules
of good conscience, which were supposed to control economic
transactions and social relations. If anything, indeed, their tendency
was to interpret them with a more rigorous severity, as a protest
against the moral laxity of the Renaissance, and, in particular,
against the avarice which was thought to be peculiarly the sin of
Rome.<span class="correction" title="quotation mark missing in
text">”</span><a name="FnAnchor1719" href="#Footnote1719"><span
class="sp">1719</span></a> Most characteristic features of the
mediæval economic ethics reappear in Lutheranism; but a novelty was
the insistence on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272"></a>272</span>
labour within one’s calling as a divinely ordained duty.<a
name="FnAnchor1720" href="#Footnote1720"><span
class="sp">1720</span></a> A person’s endeavour ought not to exceed

href="#Footnote1721"><span class="sp">1721</span></a> The mediæval
prohibition of usury was taken for granted, nay demanded with

denounced the payment of interest as compensation for loss and the

mendicancy Lutheranism differed radically from that of the mediæval
Church. Its doctrine of justification by faith alone deprived
almsgiving of all merit and, consequently, of all attraction as a
means of salvation. No beggars should be tolerated in Christian
countries, and each town should organise charity for the support of
the honest poor.<a name="FnAnchor1724" href="#Footnote1724"><span

<p>Like Luther, Calvin advocated labour as a universal duty and
condemned mendicancy and indiscriminate almsgiving; the ecclesiastical
authorities should regularly visit every family to ascertain whether
the members were idle, or drunken, or otherwise undesirable. He, too,
regarded work as the practical exercise of a calling appointed by God,
as well as a method of self-discipline and of diverting evil desires.
The Calvinistic economic ethic, moreover, agreed with the Lutheran one
in its urgent desire for modesty and moderation, its observance of
distinctions in rank, and its campaign against luxury, which was
prosecuted with unexampled severity by laws against it, and which was
checked ecclesiastically by the moral tribune.<a name="FnAnchor1725"
href="#Footnote1725"><span class="sp">1725</span></a> But at the same
time Calvin influenced the Reformed economic ethic in a manner which
was utterly alien to the spirit of Lutheranism, and led to the
religious sanction of capitalism.</p>

<p>While Luther considered that the most admirable form of life was
the self-contained family life of the peasant, based as far as
possible on primitive methods of production, Calvin set the profits of
trade and finance on the same level of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page273"></a>273</span> respectability as the earnings of the
labourer and the rents of the landlord. He quite approved of the fact
that greater profits were made in trade than in agriculture, since
they were simply the reward of carefulness and industry.<a
name="FnAnchor1726" href="#Footnote1726"><span
class="sp">1726</span></a> He rejected the canonical veto on usury and
the scholastic theory of money. He argued that the payment of interest
for capital is as reasonable as the payment of rent for land, and only
urged that it should not exceed the amount dictated by natural justice
and the Golden Rule.<a name="FnAnchor1727" href="#Footnote1727"><span
class="sp">1727</span></a> In his opinion the supposed scriptural
prohibition of usury rests on an error of translation, referring not
to interest as such but to the abuse of it.<a name="FnAnchor1728"

<p>The direction which the ethics of Calvinism evolved was evidently
connected with the conditions which governed the practical situation
in Geneva. Calvin, who himself had a great deal to do with questions
of industrial production, found capitalism acceptable as a calling
which suited the existing conditions of the city, and which was
capable of being combined with loyalty, seriousness, honesty, thrift,
and consideration for one’s neighbour.<a name="FnAnchor1729"
href="#Footnote1729"><span class="sp">1729</span></a> Mr. Tawney feels
that “there have been few systems in which the practical conclusions
flow by so inevitable a logic from the theological premises.”<a
name="FnAnchor1730" href="#Footnote1730"><span
class="sp">1730</span></a> To me it seems much more likely that
Calvin’s theological deductions were mainly influenced by economic
circumstances. The dogma of predestination is the core of his
theology. God has chosen certain individuals as his elect, predestined
to salvation from eternity, while the remainder have been consigned to
eternal damnation. The aim of man’s existence is not salvation, to
which human effort is quite irrelevant, but the glorification of God;
good works are not a way of attaining salvation, but are indispensable
as a proof that salvation has been attained.<a name="FnAnchor1731"
href="#Footnote1731"><span class="sp">1731</span></a> But why are the
good works of Calvinism not such as were conceived of by Jesus and
the mediæval Church, but such as suited urban industry and commercial
enterprise? Why is profit looked upon as the sign of the blessing of
God on the faithful exercise of one’s calling, and success as the
hall-mark of godliness? It may be that the Puritans’ excessive
deference to the Old Testament had something to do with that
association of divine favour and mundane prosperity, which also marked
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274"></a>274</span> the religion of
ancient Israel.<a name="FnAnchor1732" href="#Footnote1732"><span
class="sp">1732</span></a> But I maintain that the chief solution of
the problem lies in the influence of the capitalist spirit over
theological dogma. Mr. Tawney himself points out that there was plenty
of this spirit in fifteenth-century Venice and Florence, in South
Germany and Flanders, for the simple reason that these areas were the
greatest commercial and financial centres of the age, though all were,
at least nominally, Catholic, and that the development of capitalism
in Holland and England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was
due, not to the fact that they were Protestant powers, but to “large
economic movements, in particular the Discoveries and the results
which flowed from them.”<a name="FnAnchor1733"

<p>The “ethic of the calling” was most consistently set forth in
Puritanism, which was an offshoot of Calvinism and is rightly regarded
as the most representative interpretation of Protestant morality among
English-speaking peoples. It was most elaborately and authoritatively
expounded by Baxter in his <i>Christian Directory</i>. The first duty
of a Christian is to make the most of his powers and possessions in
whatever might be his calling. “It is for action that God maintaineth
us. . . . It is action that God is most served and honoured by.”<a
name="FnAnchor1734" href="#Footnote1734"><span
class="sp">1734</span></a> “Keep up a high esteem of time and be every
day more careful that you lose none of your time, than you are that

dressings, feastings, idle talk, unprofitable company, or sleep, be
any of them temptations to rob you of any of your time, accordingly
heighten your watchfulness.”<a name="FnAnchor1735"

class="sp">1737</span></a> Unwillingness to work is a symptom of the
lack of grace. Wealth does not except any one from this unconditional
command.<a name="FnAnchor1738" href="#Footnote1738"><span
class="sp">1738</span></a> Wealth and poverty come of God’s gifts, and
either is to be accepted as from him. The seventeenth-century
moralists do not ignore the spiritual and moral dangers <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page275"></a>275</span> of wealth, indeed they
are most anxious to direct the man of means in the employment of his
money. But as they regard the possession of wealth as something
ordained of God, they take up a conservative attitude towards class
distinctions and class standards of living.<a name="FnAnchor1739"
href="#Footnote1739"><span class="sp">1739</span></a> Differences in
wealth are incidental to God’s education of mankind. “We may this day
be rich, tomorrow we may be beggars; for the riches be chanceable unto
us, but not unto God: for God knoweth when, and to whom, he will give
them or take them away again.”<a name="FnAnchor1740"
href="#Footnote1740"><span class="sp">1740</span></a> In the midst of
many wise cautions against prodigality Baxter reserves the expenditure
necessary for the maintenance of class distinctions. When he asks,
“What may be accounted prodigality in the costliness of apparel?” the
answer begins with the sentence: “Not that which is only for a
distinction of superiors from inferiors, or which is needful to keep
up the vulgar’s reverence to magistrates.”<a name="FnAnchor1741"
href="#Footnote1741"><span class="sp">1741</span></a> And when he
discusses how far the rich may spend on themselves while the poor
suffer want, he writes: “It must be confessed, that some few persons
may be of so much worth and use to the commonwealth (as kings and
magistrates) and some of so little; that the maintaining of the honour
and succours of the former, may be more necessary than the saving of
the lives of the latter. But take heed lest pride or cruelty teach
you, to misunderstand this, or abuse it for yourselves.”<a
name="FnAnchor1742" href="#Footnote1742"><span
class="sp">1742</span></a> Professor Barker observes that “Puritanism
helped to dig the gulf&mdash;which is apparent in the history of
English thought, and not least of English education, from the end of
the seventeenth century onwards&mdash;between a possessional class,
regarded as justified in its possessions by its moral and spiritual
merits, and a class of labouring poor conceived as condemned to
poverty by its moral and spiritual defects.”<a name="FnAnchor1743"
href="#Footnote1743"><span class="sp">1743</span></a> Although the
Puritans regarded riches as God’s gift and no man as absolute owner,
but all men as God’s stewards who must render an account of their
stewardship, they seldom attached much weight to the claim which the
poor can make on the rich in virtue of the social character of all
wealth.<a name="FnAnchor1744" href="#Footnote1744"><span

<p>The Puritan divines followed Calvin in rejecting the Canon <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page276"></a>276</span> Law against usury. In
his book <i>De conscientia</i>, which was the most influential work on
social ethics written in the first half of the seventeenth century,
Ames argues that there is no difference between a man who buys a farm
and takes a rent for it&mdash;which is considered just&mdash;and a man
who lends the money to another to buy the farm and gets that other to
pay interest instead of rent.<a name="FnAnchor1745"
href="#Footnote1745"><span class="sp">1745</span></a> But although the
Puritan moralists generally admitted the right to take interest, they
were never tired of insisting on moderation in terms on which money is
lent. Baxter’s counsels are somewhat vague, and he does not refer to
any statutory limitation of interest, but he is clear that all usury
is sinful when it is against justice and charity. The attitude of
Puritanism towards monopolies, both in theory and practice, is also in
line with Baxter’s repudiation of getting all you can for your
goods.<a name="FnAnchor1746" href="#Footnote1746"><span
class="sp">1746</span></a> The Christian must not desire “to get
another’s goods or labour for less than it is worth.” He must not
secure a good price for his own wares “by extortion working upon men’s
ignorance, error or necessity.” Rivalry in trade is inevitable, but
the Christian must not snatch a good bargain “out of greedy
covetousness, nor to the injury of the poor.” And so forth.<a

<p>Of the rules of morality elaborated by Baxter, Mr. Tawney remarks
that “they were like seeds carried by birds from a distant and fertile
plain, and dropped upon a glacier,” where they were at once embalmed
and sterilised in a river of ice. He finds the roots of their failure,
not merely in the obstacles offered by the ever more recalcitrant
opposition of a commercial environment, but in certain tendencies in
Puritanism itself, which were to make it later a potent ally of the
movement against the control of economic relations when political and
economic changes had prepared a congenial surrounding for their
growth. This rejection of all traditional restrictions on economic
enterprise was not only the temper of the English business world after
the Civil War, but it took place in all other Calvinist countries as
well.<a name="FnAnchor1748" href="#Footnote1748"><span
class="sp">1748</span></a> In any case it was another instance of
capitalism triumphing over religious doctrine, when the wave of
commercial and financial expansion came, in the form of companies,
colonies, capitalism in textiles, in mining, in finance, and so forth.
As Miss James observes, “Puritanism was <span class="pagenum"><a

<p>We notice a similar development within Methodism. While the early
Wesleyans buoyed up enthusiasm, kept their virtue amid the temptations
of the world, and were distinguished by devotion to public and private
charities, their restrictive austerity weakened when the early
enthusiasm waned. The theory of the divine ownership, which ordered
the disposition of all money above the bare needs of the individual
for the good of the community, was taken seriously only in the early
vital period of the revival. Hand in hand with the altering economic
social status of society members, the sense of class consciousness
began to assert itself. And at the end of the century, after Wesley’s
death, philanthropy was in danger of being defined again in the old
traditional terms of dutiful alms. Wesley and the early Methodists
were felt to be too radical, and a rising group of prosperous
Methodists repudiated the inconvenient part of the teaching by the
apparently innocuous judgment that in this respect Wesley was simply
impracticable.<a name="FnAnchor1750" href="#Footnote1750"><span
class="sp">1750</span></a> Of the Established Church of England it has
been said that its ordinary attitude, as expressed in Congresses or
other authoritative utterances “is one of platitudinarianism, loose,
suave, non-committal, on all important proposals of economic reform.
This is due partly to a genuine disbelief in its competency to handle
economic issues, partly to its feeling of personal sympathy with the
wealthy business classes whose assistance is more than ever needed to
enable it to carry on the recognised work of a modern parish.”<a

<p>The teaching of Jesus can certainly not be recognised as applicable
to economics. This is due not merely to the enormous difference
between the social conditions of Judæa in the time of Jesus and those
of the modern world, but also to certain general precepts which lack
the support of the moral consciousness in any circumstances. One is
that we should respond to every call of need, even though this should
involve indiscriminate charity. Backed up by the hope of heavenly
reward this rule was followed in a large measure by early and mediæval
Christianity, but with unfortunate results. The Reformation brought
about a change, and even led to a religious doctrine <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page278"></a>278</span> which was utterly
inconsistent with Jesus’ recommendation of poverty as a state of
blessedness and his warning against anxiety for the morrow. The poor
were no longer looked upon as God’s friends, but as objects of his
hatred. Prosperity was the reward for moral superiority and the sign
of salvation, poverty the punishment for moral failings and the sign
of damnation. In connection with Puritanism a school of opinion arose
that regarded with repugnance the whole body of social theory of which
both private charity and public relief had been the expression. “The
generall rule of all England,” wrote a pamphleteer in 1646, “is to
whip and punish the wandring beggars.” The poor are the victims, not
of circumstances, but of their own “idle, irregular, and wicked
courses,” and the truest charity is not to enervate them by relief,
but so to reform their characters that relief may be unnecessary. The
rigours of economic exploitation were preached as a public duty. Some
thought that salvation might be found by reducing the number of days
kept as holidays. Bishop Berkeley, with the conditions of Ireland
before his eyes, suggested that all sturdy beggars should be seized
and made slaves to the public for a certain term of years.<a
name="FnAnchor1752" href="#Footnote1752"><span
class="sp">1752</span></a> Innumerable writers advanced schemes for
reformed workhouses which should be places at once of punishment and
of training.<a name="FnAnchor1753" href="#Footnote1753"><span
class="sp">1753</span></a> When we thus find within Christianity
itself such absolutely conflicting religious opinions about the proper
treatment of the poor, we have certainly good reason for accepting the
modern view that this department of economics should be governed by
social considerations in a humanitarian spirit without the
interference of any religious doctrine at all.</p>

<p>Besides the duty of indiscriminate almsgiving there is another rule
which should be observed in economic relations if these are to be
regulated by the teaching of Jesus, namely, the maxim that you ought
to love your neighbour as yourself. This rule would of course, as Mr.
Hobson points out, be completely impracticable in the intricacies of a
highly organised national or world market, where “no man knows whom he
serves or who consumes the goods to the making of which he contributes
some fractional share.”<a name="FnAnchor1754"
href="#Footnote1754"><span class="sp">1754</span></a> But this is not
the only objection that may be raised to its application. Contrary to
the Golden Rule, it is not merely an expression of the
disinterestedness of the concept of duty, which implies that when an
act is pronounced to be my duty it is so independently of any
reference it might have to me personally. This has nothing to do with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page279"></a>279</span> the particular
nature of the act. When my own interests clash with those of my
neighbour, I may have the right to prefer my own lesser good to the
greater good of another, though only on condition that the other
person also, in similar circumstances, is admitted to have the right
to prefer his own lesser good to my greater good. No such right to
prefer one’s own lesser good to the greater good of another is
recognised in the precept, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”
As I have pointed out above,<a name="FnAnchor1755"
href="#Footnote1755"><span class="sp">1755</span></a> this precept
owes its origin to the strength of the altruistic sentiment in him who
laid down the rule, and not merely to the disinterestedness of his
moral emotions.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote1754"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor1754"><sup>1754</sup></a></span> Hobson, <i><span
class="ib" title="God and Mammon">op. cit.</span></i>  p. 50

href="#FnAnchor1755"><sup>1755</sup></a></span> <i>Supra</i>, pp. <a href="#page38">38</a>, <a href="#page73">73</a>.</p></div>

<p>The altruistic sentiment varies in range and strength, and in so
far as it is stronger in some persons than in others, it is more apt
to influence their consciences with regard to their own conduct and
their judgments on other people’s conduct. The utilitarian
proposition, “I ought not to prefer my own lesser good to the greater
good of another,” which, as Stuart Mill pointed out, is identical with
the precept of Jesus,<a name="FnAnchor1756" href="#Footnote1756"><span
class="sp">1756</span></a> presented itself to Sidgwick as no less
evident than the mathematical axiom that “if equals be added to equals
the wholes are equal”; he called it the axiom or principle of
“rational benevolence.” He admitted that the duty of benevolence as
recognised by common sense seems to fall somewhat short of this
principle; but he thought “that a ‘plain man’ in a modern civilised
society, if his conscience were fairly brought to consider the
hypothetical question, whether it would be morally right for him to
seek his own happiness on any occasion if it involved a certain
sacrifice of the greater happiness of some other human
being&mdash;without any counterbalancing gain to any one
else,&mdash;would answer unhesitatingly in the negative.”<a
name="FnAnchor1757" href="#Footnote1757"><span
class="sp">1757</span></a> Well, in many cases he undoubtedly would,
but in other cases he most decidedly would not. Suppose that if I by
sacrificing my own life could save another person’s life, which is a
greater good to him or to others than my life is to me or others,
would it be my duty to make such a sacrifice? Or suppose that I
endeavour to obtain a good which another person also tries to obtain,
and that I do so in spite of my belief that it will be a lesser good
to me than it would be to him if he succeeded in achieving it; would
common sense condemn my action, even though I could claim no
counterbalancing gain to any one else as an excuse for my behaviour?
For example, would it require that I, being a merchant, should abstain
from some business if it is likely that <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page280"></a>280</span> another competing merchant would make a
larger profit than I could by engaging in the business?<a
name="FnAnchor1758" href="#Footnote1758"><span
class="sp">1758</span></a> Can anybody doubt that common sense,
without hesitation, would answer these questions in the negative? It
seems fairly obvious that Sidgwick has considerably exaggerated even
that limited support his principle of rational benevolence could
receive from the “plain man.” Everybody will undoubtedly agree that
some amount of self-sacrifice is a duty in certain circumstances, but
the amount and the circumstances cannot be fixed in general rules, and
on the whole, in cases of conflicting interests the judgment must to a
large extent remain a matter of private opinion. Hutcheson, in whose
system benevolence is the very essence of virtue and who was
apparently the author of the utilitarian formula that “that action is
best which procures the greatest happiness for the greatest
numbers,”<a name="FnAnchor1759" href="#Footnote1759"><span
class="sp">1759</span></a> goes so far as to say that “we do not
positively condemn those as evil, who will not sacrifice their private
interest to the advancement of the positive good of others, unless the
private interest is very small, and the public good very great.”<a

<p>What has been said of our right to prefer our own lesser good to
the greater good of another also applies to preferring our own good
when it may involve a lessening of somebody else’s good, as is
generally the case in competition. There is nothing in the intrinsic
nature of the moral emotions that prevents us from doing so, provided
that we allow the other person in similar circumstances to increase
his own good. The indictment made against our economic system that it
is necessarily wrong because it is competitive is therefore
unjustified, although it is certainly incompatible with the teaching
of Jesus. This, of course, does not imply that it will be regarded as
right in all circumstances. There are certain generally accepted moral
principles which cannot be transgressed without disapproval, and these
principles are very often ignored in our business life. “Look at the
results of our present capitalistic system,” says Dr. Lofthouse,
“which places those who have only their labour to sell, where the
market is overstocked, in the position of slaves; at the operations of
money and finance in the modern world, whereby those who possess the
power of dispensing or withholding credit can control the whole of
industry, capital <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281"></a>281</span>
and labour alike. The result is what every one can recognise and no
one can overcome; poverty and distress in a world where science and
skill can supply its wants as quickly as they can arise; and a
universal shortage, experienced and dreaded, which makes every man
look on his neighbour as his foe; which binds men into groups whose
mutual rivalries leave the rivalries of individuals far behind; and a
heartless or despairing acquiescence in the misery that flows from
defeat or from the terrors that still hang over the world.”<a
name="FnAnchor1761" href="#Footnote1761"><span
class="sp">1761</span></a> Professor Knight remarks that if there is
anything on which divergent interpretations of Christianity would have
to agree, it would be the admission that the Christian conception of
goodness is the antithesis of the competitive system.<a
name="FnAnchor1762" href="#Footnote1762"><span
class="sp">1762</span></a> “Compromise,” writes Mr. Tawney, “is as
impossible between the Church of Christ and the idolatry of wealth,
which is the practical religion of capitalist societies, as it was
between the Church and the State idolatry of the Roman Empire.”<a

<p>It is not my task, however, to examine in detail the moral
implications of the present economic system, which operates partly by
competition and partly by monopoly. I am concerned with the influence
of the Christian religion on economics; and this influence has
decidedly collapsed. “The established Episcopal Church of this
country,” says Mr. Hobson, “has inclined, in its ordinary preaching
and teaching, to renounce all claims to regulate business life in
conformity with Christian principles, as distinct from inculcating the
ethics of personal integrity and justice.” Among the nonconformists
there are Christian Socialists, who have made “a pathetic attempt to
rally some remnant of belief and moral authority for the churches.”<a
name="FnAnchor1764" href="#Footnote1764"><span
class="sp">1764</span></a> But on the Continent the break of Socialism
with the religion of the churches, Catholic or Protestant, is almost
complete, largely accepting Marx’s asseveration that the idea of God
must be destroyed, being the keystone of a perverted civilisation. In
his conflict with God, Mammon has carried the day.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<h3>CHRISTIANITY AND SLAVERY</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="smcap">HERE</span> still remains a branch of
economics where we might expect to find conspicuous traces of
Christian influence, especially as the very objects that it is
concerned with are human beings&mdash;I mean the institution of
slavery.</p>
<p>Slavery is essentially an industrial institution, which implies
compulsory labour beyond the limits of family relations. The master
has a right to avail himself of the working power of his slave,
without previous agreement on the part of the latter. This I take to
be the essence of slavery; but connected with such a right there are
others which hardly admit of a strict definition, or which belong to
the master in some cases though not in all. He is entitled to claim
obedience and to enforce this claim with more or less severity, but
his authority is not necessarily absolute, and the restrictions
imposed on it are not everywhere the same. Voluntary slavery is spoken
of, as when a person sells himself as a slave, but this is only an
imitation of slavery true and proper: the person who gives up his
liberty confers upon another, by contract, either for a limited period
or for ever the same rights over himself as a master possesses over
his slave. If slavery proper could be based upon a contract between
the parties concerned, I fail to see how to distinguish between a
servant and a slave.</p>
<p>Christianity recognised slavery from the beginning. Paul wrote: “By
one Spirit are we all baptised into one body, whether we be Jews or
Gentiles, whether we be bond or free.”<a name="FnAnchor1765"
href="#Footnote1765"><span class="sp">1765</span></a> But he also
wrote: “Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest
be made free, use it rather. For he that is called in the Lord, being
a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called,
being free, is Christ’s servant. Ye are bought with a price; be not ye
the servants of men. Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called,
therein abide with God.”<a name="FnAnchor1766"
href="#Footnote1766"><span class="sp">1766</span></a> Masters are told
to give to their servants <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page283"></a>283</span> that which is just and equal;<a
name="FnAnchor1767" href="#Footnote1767"><span
class="sp">1767</span></a> but in the first place servants are
commanded to obey in all things their masters “according to the flesh;
not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but in singleness of heart,
fearing God.”<a name="FnAnchor1768" href="#Footnote1768"><span
class="sp">1768</span></a> Peter says that they shall be subject to
their masters with all fear; “not only to the good and gentle but also
to the froward.”<a name="FnAnchor1769" href="#Footnote1769"><span
class="sp">1769</span></a> There are a few references to slavery in
the Apostolic Fathers. Ignatius writes: “Overlook not the men and
maid-servants: neither let them be puffed up; but rather let them be
the more subject, to the glory of God, that they may obtain from him a
better liberty. Let them not desire to be set free at the public cost,
that they be not slaves to their own lusts.”<a name="FnAnchor1770"
href="#Footnote1770"><span class="sp">1770</span></a> Barnabas tells
masters not to be bitter in their commands towards any of their
servants that trust in God.<a name="FnAnchor1771"
href="#Footnote1771"><span class="sp">1771</span></a> The same
injunction is found in the ‘Didache,’ together with the order that
slaves shall be subject to their lords, “as to God’s image.”<a

<p>Christianity’s acceptance of slavery belonged to its Jewish
heritage. Among the Hebrews the slave class consisted of captives
taken in war;<a name="FnAnchor1773" href="#Footnote1773"><span
class="sp">1773</span></a> of persons bought with money from
neighbouring nations or from foreign residents in the land;<a
name="FnAnchor1774" href="#Footnote1774"><span
class="sp">1774</span></a> of children of slaves born in the house;<a
name="FnAnchor1775" href="#Footnote1775"><span
class="sp">1775</span></a> of native Hebrews who had been sold by
their fathers,<a name="FnAnchor1776" href="#Footnote1776"><span
class="sp">1776</span></a> or who either alone or with their wives and
children had fallen into slavery in consequence of poverty,<a
name="FnAnchor1777" href="#Footnote1777"><span
class="sp">1777</span></a> or who had been sold by the authorities as
slaves on account of theft when unable to pay compensation for the
stolen property.<a name="FnAnchor1778" href="#Footnote1778"><span
class="sp">1778</span></a> Slaves of foreign extraction were not to be
emancipated, but should remain slaves for ever.<a name="FnAnchor1779"
href="#Footnote1779"><span class="sp">1779</span></a> But in no case
had the master absolute power over his slave. Whether the latter was
an Israelite or a foreigner, his life, and to some extent his body,
were protected by law. If a man by blows destroyed an eye or a tooth,
or any other member belonging to his manservant or maid-servant, he
was bound to let the injured person go free.<a name="FnAnchor1780"
href="#Footnote1780"><span class="sp">1780</span></a> And a master who
smites his slave so that he dies under his hand, “shall be surely
punished”; but if the slave <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page284"></a>284</span> continues to live for a day or two after
the assault, the master goes free on the score that the slave is “his
money.”<a name="FnAnchor1781" href="#Footnote1781"><span
class="sp">1781</span></a> In the Talmud masters are repeatedly
admonished to treat their slaves with kindness;<a name="FnAnchor1782"
href="#Footnote1782"><span class="sp">1782</span></a> and emancipation
of slaves is practically encouraged in various ways,<a
name="FnAnchor1783" href="#Footnote1783"><span
class="sp">1783</span></a> in spite of the dictum of certain rabbis
that he who emancipates his slave transgresses the positive precept of
Leviticus xxv. 46, “They shall be your bondmen for ever.”<a

<p>Paul also knew the slavery of the Græco-Roman world. The power,
originally unlimited, which the Roman master had over his slave was
during the Pagan Empire limited in various ways. Claudius<a
name="FnAnchor1785" href="#Footnote1785"><span
class="sp">1785</span></a> and Antoninus Pius<a name="FnAnchor1786"
href="#Footnote1786"><span class="sp">1786</span></a> put check on his
legal right to kill his slave. The Lex Petronia, <span
class="smcap">A.D.</span> 61, forbade masters to compel their slaves
to fight with wild beasts.<a name="FnAnchor1787"
href="#Footnote1787"><span class="sp">1787</span></a> In the time of
Nero an official was appointed to hear complaints of the wrongs done
by masters to their slaves.<a name="FnAnchor1788"
href="#Footnote1788"><span class="sp">1788</span></a> But in those
days when Roman slavery had lost its original patriarchal and, to
speak with Mommsen,<a name="FnAnchor1789" href="#Footnote1789"><span
class="sp">1789</span></a> “in some measure innocent” character, when
the victories of Rome and the increasing slave-trade had introduced
into the city innumerable slaves, when those simpler habits of life
which in early times somewhat mitigated the rigour of the law had
changed&mdash;the lot of the Roman slave was often extremely hard, and
numerous acts of shocking cruelty were committed.<a
name="FnAnchor1790" href="#Footnote1790"><span
class="sp">1790</span></a> At the same time we also hear, from the
early days of the Empire, that masters who had been cruel to their
slaves were pointed at with disgust in all parts of the city, and were
hated and loathed.<a name="FnAnchor1791" href="#Footnote1791"><span
class="sp">1791</span></a> And with a fervour which can scarcely be
surpassed Seneca and other Stoics argued that the slave is a being
with human dignity and human rights, born of the same race as
ourselves, living the same life, and dying the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page285"></a>285</span> same death&mdash;in
short, that our slaves “are also men, and friends, and our
fellow-servants.”<a name="FnAnchor1792" href="#Footnote1792"><span
class="sp">1792</span></a> Epictetus even went so far as to condemn
altogether the keeping of slaves. “What you avoid suffering yourself,”
he says, “seek not to impose on others. You avoid slavery, for
instance; take care not to enslave. For if you can bear to exact
slavery from others, you appear to have been yourself a slave.”<a
name="FnAnchor1793" href="#Footnote1793"><span
class="sp">1793</span></a> These teachings could not fail to influence
both legislation and public sentiment. Imbued with the Stoic
philosophy, the jurists of the classical period declared that all men
are originally free by the Law of Nature, and that slavery is only “an
institution of the Law of Nations, by which one man is made the
property of another, in opposition to natural right.”<a

<p>Considering that Christianity has commonly been represented as
almost the sole cause of the mitigation and final abolishment of
slavery in Europe, it deserves special notice that the chief
improvement in the condition of slaves at Rome took place at so early
a period that Christianity could have absolutely no share in it. Nay,
for about two hundred years after it was made the official religion of
the Empire there was an almost complete pause in the legislation on
the subject.<a name="FnAnchor1795" href="#Footnote1795"><span
class="sp">1795</span></a> Beyond a law of Constantine, to the effect
that a master who put his slave to death in a non-judicial way was to
be punished as a murderer,<a name="FnAnchor1796"
href="#Footnote1796"><span class="sp">1796</span></a> the Christian
emperors seem to have done little to guard the life of the slave.
Whilst it was provided that any master who applied to his slave
certain atrocious tortures with the object of killing him should be
deemed a manslayer, it was emphatically said that no charge whatever
should be brought against him if the slave died under moderate
punishment, or under any punishment not inflicted with the intention
of killing him.<a name="FnAnchor1797" href="#Footnote1797"><span
class="sp">1797</span></a> Arcadius and Honorius even passed a law
refusing protection to a slave who should fly to a church for refuge
from his master;<a name="FnAnchor1798" href="#Footnote1798"><span
class="sp">1798</span></a> but this law was, in the West, followed by
regulations of an opposite character.<a name="FnAnchor1799"
href="#Footnote1799"><span class="sp">1799</span></a> Under Justinian
certain reforms were introduced:&mdash;enfranchisement was facilitated
in various ways;<a name="FnAnchor1800" href="#Footnote1800"><span
class="sp">1800</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page286"></a>286</span> the rights of Roman citizens were granted
to emancipated slaves who had previously occupied an intermediate
position between slavery and perfect freedom;<a name="FnAnchor1801"
href="#Footnote1801"><span class="sp">1801</span></a> and though the
law still refused to recognise the marriages of slaves, Justinian gave
them a legal value after emancipation in establishing rights of
succession.<a name="FnAnchor1802" href="#Footnote1802"><span
class="sp">1802</span></a> But the inferior position of the slave was
asserted as sternly as ever. He belonged to the “corporeal” property
of his master, he was reckoned among things which are tangible by
their nature, like land, raiment, gold, and silver.<a
name="FnAnchor1803" href="#Footnote1803"><span
class="sp">1803</span></a> The constitution of Antoninus Pius
restraining severity on the part of masters was enforced, but the
motive for this was not evangelic humanity.<a name="FnAnchor1804"
href="#Footnote1804"><span class="sp">1804</span></a> It is said in
the ‘Institutes’ of Justinian: “This decision is a just one; for it
greatly concerns the public weal, that no one be permitted to misuse
even his own property.”<a name="FnAnchor1805"

<p>It is strange that the inconsistency of slavery with the tenet, “Do
to others as you would be done by,” though emphasised by a pagan
philosopher, never seems to have occurred to any of the early
Christian writers. The principle that all men are spiritually equal in
Christ does not imply that they should be socially equal in the world.
Slavery does not prevent anybody from performing the duties incumbent
on a Christian, it does not bar the way to heaven, it is an external
affair only, nothing but a name. He only is really a slave who commits
sin.<a name="FnAnchor1806" href="#Footnote1806"><span
class="sp">1806</span></a> Augustine says that slavery is a burden
which has justly been laid upon the back of transgression. Man when
created by God was free, and nobody was the slave of another until
that just man Noah cursed Ham, his offending son; slavery, then, is a
punishment sent by Him who best knows how to proportionate punishment
to offence,<a name="FnAnchor1807" href="#Footnote1807"><span
class="sp">1807</span></a> and the slave himself ought not to desire
to become free.<a name="FnAnchor1808" href="#Footnote1808"><span
class="sp">1808</span></a> Not one of the Fathers of the Church hints
that slavery is unlawful or improper. In the early age martyrs
possessed slaves, and so did abbots, bishops, popes, monasteries, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page287"></a>287</span> churches;<a
name="FnAnchor1809" href="#Footnote1809"><span
class="sp">1809</span></a> Jews and pagans only were prohibited from
acquiring Christian slaves.<a name="FnAnchor1810"
href="#Footnote1810"><span class="sp">1810</span></a> So little was
the abolition of slavery thought of that a Council at Orleans, in the
middle of the sixth century, expressly decreed the perpetuity of
servitude among the descendants of slaves.<a name="FnAnchor1811"
href="#Footnote1811"><span class="sp">1811</span></a> On the other
hand, the Church showed a zeal to prevent accessions to slavery from
capture, but her exertions were restricted to Christian prisoners of
war.<a name="FnAnchor1812" href="#Footnote1812"><span
class="sp">1812</span></a> As late as the nineteenth century the right
of enslaving captives was defended by Bishop Bouvier.<a

<p>Like the Apostles, Councils and popes reminded slaves of their
duties towards their masters, and masters of their duties towards
their slaves. The Council of Gangra, about the year 824, pronounced
its anathema on any one who should teach a slave to despise his master
on pretence of religion;<a name="FnAnchor1814"
href="#Footnote1814"><span class="sp">1814</span></a> and so much
importance was attached to this decree that it was inserted in the
epitome of canons which Hadrian I. in 773 presented to Charlemagne in
Rome.<a name="FnAnchor1815" href="#Footnote1815"><span
class="sp">1815</span></a> But there are also many instances in which
masters are recommended to show humanity to their slaves.<a
name="FnAnchor1816" href="#Footnote1816"><span
class="sp">1816</span></a> According to Gregory IX. “the slaves who
were washed in the fountain of holy baptism should be more liberally
treated in consideration of their having received so great a
benefit.”<a name="FnAnchor1817" href="#Footnote1817"><span
class="sp">1817</span></a> Slaves who had taken refuge from their
masters in churches or monasteries were not to be given up until the
master had sworn not to punish the fugitive;<a name="FnAnchor1818"
href="#Footnote1818"><span class="sp">1818</span></a> or they were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288"></a>288</span> never given up,
but became slaves to the sanctuary.<a name="FnAnchor1819"
href="#Footnote1819"><span class="sp">1819</span></a> Faithful to her
principle that human life is sacred, the Church made efforts to secure
the life of the slave against the violence of the master; but neither
the ecclesiastical nor the secular legislation gave him the same
protection as was bestowed upon the free member of the Church and
State. Various Councils punished the murder of a slave with two years’
excommunication only, if the slave had been killed “sine conscientia
judicis”;<a name="FnAnchor1820" href="#Footnote1820"><span
class="sp">1820</span></a> and the same punishment was adopted by some
Penitentials.<a name="FnAnchor1821" href="#Footnote1821"><span
class="sp">1821</span></a> Edgar made the penance last three years,
whereas if a freeman was killed, the penance was of seven years’
duration.<a name="FnAnchor1822" href="#Footnote1822"><span
class="sp">1822</span></a> Facts do not justify Lecky’s statement
that, “in the penal system of the Church, the distinction between
wrongs done to a freeman, and wrongs done to a slave, which lay at the
very root of the whole civil legislation, was repudiated.”<a
name="FnAnchor1823" href="#Footnote1823"><span
class="sp">1823</span></a> The Church prohibited the sale of Christian
slaves to Jews and heathen nations.<a name="FnAnchor1824"
href="#Footnote1824"><span class="sp">1824</span></a> The Council of
Chalons, in the middle of the seventh century, ordered that no
Christian should be sold outside the kingdom of Clovis, so that they
might not get into captivity or become the slaves of Jewish masters;<a
name="FnAnchor1825" href="#Footnote1825"><span
class="sp">1825</span></a> and some Anglo-Saxon laws similarly forbade
the sale of Christians out of the country, and especially into bondage
to heathen, “that those souls perish not that Christ bought with his
own life.”<a name="FnAnchor1826" href="#Footnote1826"><span
class="sp">1826</span></a> The clergy sometimes <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page289"></a>289</span> remonstrated against
slave-markets; but their indignation never reached the trade in
heathen slaves,<a name="FnAnchor1827" href="#Footnote1827"><span
class="sp">1827</span></a> nor was the master’s right of selling any
of his slaves whenever he pleased called in question at all.</p>

ut in tertium diem animam cum cruciatu effundat; eo quod incertum sit,

<p>The assertion made by many writers that the Church exercised an
extremely favourable influence upon slavery surely involves a great
exaggeration. As late as the thirteenth century the master had
practically the power of life and death over his slave.<a
name="FnAnchor1828" href="#Footnote1828"><span
class="sp">1828</span></a> Throughout Christendom the purchase and the
sale of men, as property transferred from vendor to buyer, was
recognised as a legal transaction of the same validity with the sale
of other merchandise, land or cattle.<a name="FnAnchor1829"
href="#Footnote1829"><span class="sp">1829</span></a> Slaves had a
title to nothing but subsistence and clothes from their masters, all
the profits of their labour accruing to the latter; and if a master
from indulgence gave his slaves any <i>peculium</i>, or fixed
allowance for their subsistence, they had no right of property in what
they saved out of that, but all that they accumulated belonged to the
master.<a name="FnAnchor1830" href="#Footnote1830"><span
class="sp">1830</span></a> A slave or a freedman was not allowed to
bring a criminal charge against a free person, except in the case of a
<i>crimen læsæ majestatis</i><a name="FnAnchor1831"
href="#Footnote1831"><span class="sp">1831</span></a> and slaves were
incapable of being received as witnesses against freemen.<a
name="FnAnchor1832" href="#Footnote1832"><span
class="sp">1832</span></a> The old distinction between the marriage of
the freeman and the concubinage of the slave was long recognised by
the Church: slaves could not marry, but had only a right of
<i>contubernium</i>, and their unions did not receive the nuptial
benediction of a priest.<a name="FnAnchor1833"
href="#Footnote1833"><span class="sp">1833</span></a> Subsequently,
when conjunction between slaves came to be considered a lawful
marriage, they were not permitted to marry without the consent of
their master, and such as transgressed this rule were punished very
severely, sometimes even with death.<a name="FnAnchor1834"

<p>The gradual disappearance of slavery in Europe during the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page290"></a>290</span> latter period of the
Middle Ages has also commonly been in the main attributed to the
influence of the Church.<a name="FnAnchor1835"
href="#Footnote1835"><span class="sp">1835</span></a> But this opinion
is scarcely supported by facts. It is true that the Church in some
degree encouraged the manumission of slaves. Though slavery was
considered a perfectly lawful institution, the enfranchisement of a
fellow-Christian was deemed a meritorious act, and was sometimes
recommended on Christian principles. At the close of the sixth century
it was affirmed that, as Christ had come to break the chain of our
servitude and restore our primitive liberty, so it was well for us to
imitate him by making free those whom the law of nations had reduced
to slavery;<a name="FnAnchor1836" href="#Footnote1836"><span
class="sp">1836</span></a> and the same doctrine was again proclaimed
at various times down to the sixteenth century.<a name="FnAnchor1837"
href="#Footnote1837"><span class="sp">1837</span></a> In the
Carlovingian period the abbot Smaragdus expressed the opinion that
among other good and salutary works each one ought to let slaves go
free, considering that not nature but sin had subjected them to their
masters.<a name="FnAnchor1838" href="#Footnote1838"><span
class="sp">1838</span></a> In the latter part of the twelfth century
the prelates of France, and in particular the archbishop of Sens,
pretended that it was an obligation of conscience to accord liberty to
all Christians, relying on a decree of a Council held at Rome by Pope
Alexander III.<a name="FnAnchor1839" href="#Footnote1839"><span
class="sp">1839</span></a> And in one of the later compilations of
German mediæval law it was said that the Lord Jesus, by his injunction
to render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s and unto God the
things that are God’s, indicated that no man is the property <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page291"></a>291</span> of another, but that
every man belongs to God.<a name="FnAnchor1840"
href="#Footnote1840"><span class="sp">1840</span></a> Slaves were
liberated “for God’s love,” or “for the remedy” or “ransom of the
soul.”<a name="FnAnchor1841" href="#Footnote1841"><span
class="sp">1841</span></a> In the formularies of manumission given by
the monk Marculfus in the seventh century we read, for instance: “He
that releases his slave who is bound to him, may trust that God will
recompense him in the next world”;<a name="FnAnchor1842"
href="#Footnote1842"><span class="sp">1842</span></a> “For the
remission of my sins, I absolve thee”;<a name="FnAnchor1843"
href="#Footnote1843"><span class="sp">1843</span></a> “For the glory
of God’s name and for my eternal retribution,” etc.<a
name="FnAnchor1844" href="#Footnote1844"><span
class="sp">1844</span></a> Too much importance, however, has often
been attached to these phrases. For the most trivial occurrences, such
as giving a book to a monastery, are commonly accompanied by similar
expressions;<a name="FnAnchor1845" href="#Footnote1845"><span
class="sp">1845</span></a> and it appears from certain formulas that
slaves were not only liberated, but also bought and sold, “in the name
of God.”<a name="FnAnchor1846" href="#Footnote1846"><span

<p>Nor can we suppose that it was from religious motives only that
manumissions were encouraged by the clergy. It has been pointed out
that “as dying persons were frequently inclined to make considerable
donations for pious uses, it was more immediately for the interest of
churchmen, that people of inferior condition should be rendered
capable of acquiring property, and should have the free disposal of
what they had acquired.” It also seems that those who obtained their
liberty by the influence of the clergy had to reward their
benefactors, and that the manumission should for this reason be
confirmed by the Church.<a name="FnAnchor1847"
href="#Footnote1847"><span class="sp">1847</span></a> And while the
Church favoured liberation of the slaves of laymen, she took care to
prevent liberation of her own slaves; like a physician she did not
herself swallow the medicine which she prescribed to others. She
allowed alienation of such slaves only as showed a disposition to run
away.<a name="FnAnchor1848" href="#Footnote1848"><span
class="sp">1848</span></a> The Council of Agatho, in 506, considered
it unfair to enfranchise the slaves of monasteries, seeing that the
monks themselves were daily compelled to labour;<a name="FnAnchor1849"
href="#Footnote1849"><span class="sp">1849</span></a> and, as a matter
of fact, the slaves of monasteries <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page292"></a>292</span> were everywhere among the last who were
manumitted.<a name="FnAnchor1850" href="#Footnote1850"><span
class="sp">1850</span></a> In the seventh century a Council at Toledo
threatened with damnation any bishop who should liberate a slave
belonging to the Church, without giving due compensation from his
property, as it was thought impious to inflict a loss on the Church of
Christ;<a name="FnAnchor1851" href="#Footnote1851"><span
class="sp">1851</span></a> and according to several ecclesiastical
regulations no bishop or priest was allowed to manumit a slave in the
patrimony of the Church unless he put in his place two slaves of equal
value.<a name="FnAnchor1852" href="#Footnote1852"><span
class="sp">1852</span></a> Nay, the Church was anxious not only to
prevent a reduction of her slaves, but to increase their number. She
zealously encouraged people to give up themselves and their posterity
to be the slaves of churches and monasteries, to enslave their
bodies&mdash;as some of the charters put it&mdash;in order to procure
the liberty of their souls.<a name="FnAnchor1853"

<p>The disappearance of mediæval slavery has further, to some extent,
been attributed to the efforts of kings to weaken the power of the
nobles.<a name="FnAnchor1855" href="#Footnote1855"><span
class="sp">1855</span></a> Thus Louis X. and Philip the Long of France
issued ordinances declaring that, as all men were by nature free, and
as their kingdom was called the kingdom of the Franks, they would have
the fact to correspond with the name, and emancipated all persons in
the royal domains upon paying a just compensation, as an example for
other lords to follow.<a name="FnAnchor1856"
href="#Footnote1856"><span class="sp">1856</span></a> Muratori
believes that in Italy the wars during the twelfth and following
centuries contributed more than anything else to the decline of
slavery, as there was a need of soldiers and soldiers must be
freemen.<a name="FnAnchor1857" href="#Footnote1857"><span
class="sp">1857</span></a> According to others, the disappearance of
slavery was largely effected by the great famines and epidemics with
which Europe was visited during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
centuries.<a name="FnAnchor1858" href="#Footnote1858"><span
class="sp">1858</span></a> The number of slaves was also considerably
reduced by the ancient usage of enslaving prisoners of war being
replaced by the more humane practice of accepting ransom for <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page293"></a>293</span> them, which became the
general rule in the latter part of the Middle Ages, at least in the
case of Christian captives.<a name="FnAnchor1859"
href="#Footnote1859"><span class="sp">1859</span></a> But it seems
that the chief cause of the extinction of slavery in Europe was its
transformation into serfdom.</p>

<p>This transformation has been traced to the diminished supply of
slaves, which made it the interest of each family to preserve
indefinitely its own hereditary slaves, and to keep up their number by
the method of propagation. The existence and physical well-being of
the slave became consequently an object of greater value to his
master, and the latter found it more profitable to attach his slaves
to certain pieces of land.<a name="FnAnchor1860"
href="#Footnote1860"><span class="sp">1860</span></a> Moreover, the
cultivation of the ground required that the slaves should have a fixed
residence in different parts of the master’s estate, and when a slave
had thus been for a long time engaged in a particular farm, he was so
much the better qualified to continue in the management of it for the
future. By degrees he therefore came to be regarded as belonging to
the stock upon the ground, and was disposed of as a part of the estate
which he had been accustomed to cultivate.<a name="FnAnchor1861"

<p>But serfdom itself was merely a transitory condition destined to
lead up to a state of entire liberty. I have elsewhere discussed the
causes of this process.<a name="FnAnchor1862"
href="#Footnote1862"><span class="sp">1862</span></a> As a quite
subordinate one may be mentioned instances of lords liberating their
villeins at the intercession of their spiritual confessors, the clergy
availing themselves of every opportunity to lessen the formidable

class="sp">1863</span></a> The influence which the Church exercised in
favour of the enfranchisement of serfs was even less than her share in
the abolition of slavery proper.<a name="FnAnchor1864"
href="#Footnote1864"><span class="sp">1864</span></a> She represented
serfdom as a divine institution,<a name="FnAnchor1865"
href="#Footnote1865"><span class="sp">1865</span></a> as a school of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page294"></a>294</span> humility, as a
road to future glory.<a name="FnAnchor1866" href="#Footnote1866"><span
class="sp">1866</span></a> Luther was horrified when the German
peasants demanded that villeinage should end, because “Christ has
delivered and redeemed us all, the lowly as well as the great, without
exception, by the shedding of his precious blood.”<a
name="FnAnchor1867" href="#Footnote1867"><span
class="sp">1867</span></a> According to him, the spiritual kingdom of
Christ must not be changed into an external worldly one: “An earthly
kingdom cannot exist without inequality of persons. Some must be free,
others serfs, some rulers, others subjects. As St. Paul says, ‘Before
Christ both master and slave are one.’”<a name="FnAnchor1868"

Church, again, was herself the greatest serf-holder; and so
strenuously did she persist in retaining her villeins, that after

servitude” in consideration of “the love of humanity,” the Church
still refused to emancipate her serfs.<a name="FnAnchor1869"

<p>Not long after serfdom had begun to disappear in the most advanced
communities of Christendom a new kind of slavery was established in
the colonies of European states. It grew up in circumstances
particularly favourable to the employment of slaves. Whether slave or
free labour is more profitable to the employer depends on the wages of
the free labourer, and these again depend on the numbers of the
labouring population compared with the capital and land. In the rich
and underpeopled soil of the West Indies and in the Southern States of
America the balance of the profits between free and slave labour was
on the side of slavery. Hence slavery was introduced there, and
flourished, and could be abolished only with the greatest
difficulty.<a name="FnAnchor1870" href="#Footnote1870"><span

<p>From the moral point of view negro slavery is interesting chiefly
because it existed in the midst of a highly developed Christian
civilisation, and nevertheless, at least in the British colonies and
the United States, was the most brutal form of slavery ever known.
First there was the capture of the negroes in Africa, then the “middle
passage” with its indescribable <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page295"></a>295</span> horrors, and lastly the miserable
existence in the new country. It may be worth while to consider more
closely some points of the legislation relating to this particular
outgrowth of Christian civilisation.</p>
<p>In America, as elsewhere, the state of slavery was hereditary. The
child of a female slave was itself a slave and belonged to the owner
of its mother, even if its father was a freeman, whereas the child of
a free woman was free even if its father was a slave.<a
name="FnAnchor1871" href="#Footnote1871"><span
class="sp">1871</span></a> When the slave-trade was prohibited,
heredity remained the only legitimate source of slavery; but even then
a freeborn negro was far from safe. In the British colonies and in all
the Slave States except one, every negro was presumed to be a slave
until he could prove the reverse.<a name="FnAnchor1872"
href="#Footnote1872"><span class="sp">1872</span></a> A man who,
within the limits of a slave-holding State, could exhibit a person of
African extraction in his custody was exempted from all necessity of
making proof how he had obtained him or by what authority he claimed
him as a slave. Nay more, through direct action of Congress it became
law that persons known to be free should be sold as slaves in order to
cover the costs of imprisonment which they had suffered on account of
the false suspicion that they were runaway slaves. This law was
repeatedly put into effect. “How many crowned despots,” says Professor
von Holst, “can be mentioned in the history of the Old World, who have
done things which compare in accursedness with this law to which the
democratic republic gave birth?”<a name="FnAnchor1873"

<p>Slaves were defined as “chattels personal in the hands of their
respective owners or possessors, and their executors, administrators,
and assigns, to all intents and purposes whatsoever.”<a
name="FnAnchor1874" href="#Footnote1874"><span
class="sp">1874</span></a> In the British colonies and the American
Slave States <span class="pagenum"><a id="page296"></a>296</span> they
were at all times liable to be sold or otherwise alienated at the will
of their masters, as absolutely as cattle or any other personal
effects. They were also liable to be sold by process of law for
satisfaction of the debts of a living, or the debts or bequests of a
deceased master, at the suit of creditors or legatees. They were
transmitted by inheritance or by will to heirs at law or to legatees,
and in the distribution of estates they were distributed like other
property.<a name="FnAnchor1875" href="#Footnote1875"><span
class="sp">1875</span></a> No regard was paid to family ties. Except
in Louisiana, where children under ten years of age could not be sold
separately from their mothers,<a name="FnAnchor1876"
href="#Footnote1876"><span class="sp">1876</span></a> no law existed
to prevent the violent separation of parents from their children or
from each other.<a name="FnAnchor1877" href="#Footnote1877"><span
class="sp">1877</span></a> And what the law did not prevent, the
slave-owners did not omit doing; thus Virginia was known as a
breeding-place out of which the members of one household were sold
into every part of the country.<a name="FnAnchor1878"
href="#Footnote1878"><span class="sp">1878</span></a> All this,
however, holds true of the British colonies and the Slave States only.
In the Spanish, Portuguese, and French colonies plantation slaves were
real estate, attached to the soil they cultivated. They partook
therewith of all the restraints upon voluntary alienation to which the
possessor of the land was there liable, and they could not be seized
or sold by creditors, for satisfaction of the debts of the owner.<a

<p>A slave could make no contract; he could not even contract
marriage, in the juridical sense of the word. The association which
took place among slaves and was called marriage was virtually the same
as the Roman <i>contubernium</i>, a relation which had no sanctity and
to which no civil rights were attached.<a name="FnAnchor1881"
href="#Footnote1881"><span class="sp">1881</span></a> <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page297"></a>297</span> The master could
whenever he liked separate the “husband” and “wife,” he could, if he
pleased, commit “adultery” with the “wife,” and was the absolute owner
of all the children born by her. A slave had “no more legal authority
over his child than a cow has over her calf.” On the other hand, the
common rules of sexual morality were not enforced on the slaves. They
were not admonished for incontinence, nor punished for “adultery,” nor
prosecuted for “bigamy.” Incontinence was rather thought a matter of
course in the slave. We are told that even in Puritan New England
female slaves in ministers’ and magistrates’ families bore children,
black or yellow, without marriage, that no one inquired who their
fathers were, and that nothing more was thought of it than of the
breeding of sheep or swine. And concerning the “slave-quarters”
connected with the plantations the universal testimony was that the
sexes were there “herded together promiscuously, like beasts.”<a
name="FnAnchor1882" href="#Footnote1882"><span
class="sp">1882</span></a> In the answer given to a query which, in
1835, was presented to a Baptist Association of ministers, the fact
leaks out that slave cohabitation was enforced by the authority of the
masters for the increase of their human chattels.<a

<p>Yet though slaves were regarded as chattels, the master could not
do with his slave exactly what he pleased. The life of the slave was
in some degree protected by law. In most of the British colonies it
was only by force of comparatively recent acts, made for the most part
subsequent to the year 1797, that the same punishment was prescribed
for the murder of a slave as for the murder of a free person. Prior to
this period the former crime was subject only to a small pecuniary
penalty, in Barbadoes not exceeding £15.<a name="FnAnchor1884"
href="#Footnote1884"><span class="sp">1884</span></a> In the French
colonies, according to the ‘Code Noir,’ a master who killed his slave
should be punished “selon l’atrocité des circonstances.”<a
name="FnAnchor1885" href="#Footnote1885"><span
class="sp">1885</span></a> In all the North American Slave States
there was a time when the murder of a slave, whether by his master or
a third person, was atoned for by a fine. In South Carolina this was
the case as late as 1821, and only since then the wilful, malicious,
and premeditated killing of a slave, by whomsoever perpetrated, was a
capital offence in all the slave-holding States.<a name="FnAnchor1886"
href="#Footnote1886"><span class="sp">1886</span></a> But this does
not mean that no distinction was made between the killing of a slave
and the killing of a freeman. In South Carolina, according to an
enactment of 1821, he who killed a slave on a sudden heat or <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page298"></a>298</span> passion was punished
simply with a fine of five hundred dollars and imprisonment not
exceeding six months.<a name="FnAnchor1887" href="#Footnote1887"><span
class="sp">1887</span></a> In the Statutes of Tennessee the law
referring to the wilful murder of a slave contained the provision that
it should not be extended to “any person killing any slave in the act
of resistance to his lawful owner or master, or any slave dying under
moderate correction”;<a name="FnAnchor1888" href="#Footnote1888"><span
class="sp">1888</span></a> and a very similar provision was made by
the laws of Georgia.<a name="FnAnchor1889" href="#Footnote1889"><span
class="sp">1889</span></a> In other words, a correction causing the
death of the victim was not necessarily immoderate in the eye of the
law. In a still higher degree the life of the slave was endangered by
another law, which prevailed universally both in the Slave States and
in the British colonies. Neither a slave, nor a free negro, nor any
descendant of a native of Africa whatever might be the shade of his
complexion, could be a witness against a white person, either in a
civil or a criminal case.<a name="FnAnchor1890"
href="#Footnote1890"><span class="sp">1890</span></a> This law placed
the slave, who was seldom within the view of more than one white man
at a time, entirely at the mercy of this individual, and its
consequences were obvious. Speaking of slavery in the United States in
1853, Goodell remarks: “Upon the most diligent inquiry and public
challenge, for fifteen or twenty years past, not one single case has
yet been ascertained in which, either during that time or previously,
a master killing his slave, or indeed any other white man, has
suffered the penalty of death for the murder of a slave.”
Nevertheless, murders of slaves by white men had been notoriously
frequent.<a name="FnAnchor1891" href="#Footnote1891"><span

166, 174. In the French colonies, also, slaves could not be legal
witnesses, but their testimony might be heard by the judge, merely to
serve as a suggestion, or unauthenticated information, which might
throw light on the evidence of other witnesses (<i>Code Noir</i>, Édit
du mois de Mars 1685, art. 30, p. 44).</p></div>

href="#FnAnchor1891"><sup>1891</sup></a></span> Goodell, <i>The
American Slave Code</i>, p. 209 <i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>In the North American Slave States and in the colonies of all
European Powers the master could inflict any number of blows upon his
slave, but if he mutilated him he was fined or subjected to a very
moderate term of imprisonment.<a name="FnAnchor1892"
href="#Footnote1892"><span class="sp">1892</span></a> Again, the
maltreatment of another person’s slave was regarded as an injury done
to the master. In the Negro Act of 1740 for South Carolina it was
prescribed that if a slave was beaten by any person who had not
sufficient cause or lawful authority for so <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page299"></a>299</span> doing, and if he was maimed or disabled by
such beating from performing his or her work, the offender should pay
to the owner of the slave “the sum of 15 shillings current money per
diem, for every day of his lost time, and also the charge of the cure
of such slave.”<a name="FnAnchor1893" href="#Footnote1893"><span
class="sp">1893</span></a> But if the beating of the slave caused no
loss of service to his master, the offender was not, as a rule,
punished by law.<a name="FnAnchor1894" href="#Footnote1894"><span
class="sp">1894</span></a> A decision of the Supreme Court of Maryland
established expressly the law to be, in that State, that trespass
would not lie by a master for an assault and battery on his slave,
unless it were attended with a loss of service.<a name="FnAnchor1895"
href="#Footnote1895"><span class="sp">1895</span></a> If, on the other
hand, the offender was a slave and his victim a white man the injury
was regarded in a very different light. We read in an act of Georgia
passed in 1770: “If any slave shall presume to strike any white
person, such slave . . . shall . . . for the second offence suffer
death: But in case any such slave shall grievously wound, maim, or
bruise any white person, though it shall be only the first offence,
such slave shall suffer death.”<a name="FnAnchor1896"
href="#Footnote1896"><span class="sp">1896</span></a> And to offer
violence, to strike, attempt to strike, struggle with, or resist any
white person, was, even by the latest meliorating laws issued in the
British colonies, declared to be a crime in a slave which, if the
white person had been wounded or hurt, and in some islands even
without that condition, should subject the offender to death,
dismemberment, or other severe penalties.<a name="FnAnchor1897"

<p>The law also took care to prohibit the master from doing things
which were considered injurious to the community or the State. There
was a great fear of teaching negroes to read and write. William Knox,
in a tract addressed to “the venerable Society for propagation of the
Gospel in foreign parts” in the year 1768, remarks that “instruction
renders them less fit or less willing to labour,” and that, if they
were universally taught to read, there would undoubtedly be a general
insurrection of the negroes leading to the massacre of their owners.<a
name="FnAnchor1898" href="#Footnote1898"><span
class="sp">1898</span></a> A similar fear underlies the laws on the
subject which we meet with in the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page300"></a>300</span> codes of some of the Slave States,
According to the Negro Act of 1740 for South Carolina, any person who
instructed a slave in writing was subject to a fine of one hundred
pounds;<a name="FnAnchor1899" href="#Footnote1899"><span
class="sp">1899</span></a> but this enactment was later on considered
too liberal. A law of 1834 placed under the ban all efforts to teach
the coloured race either reading or writing, and the punishment was no
longer a pecuniary fine only, but, besides, imprisonment for six
months or a shorter time or, if the offender was a free person of
colour, whipping not exceeding fifty lashes.<a name="FnAnchor1900"
href="#Footnote1900"><span class="sp">1900</span></a> In Georgia a law
of 1770, which prohibited the instruction of slaves in reading and
writing, was in 1833 followed by an act which extended the prohibition
to free persons of colour.<a name="FnAnchor1901"
href="#Footnote1901"><span class="sp">1901</span></a> In Louisiana the
teaching of slaves was punished with imprisonment for not less than a
month nor more than twelve months.<a name="FnAnchor1902"
href="#Footnote1902"><span class="sp">1902</span></a> North Carolina
allowed slaves to be acquainted with arithmetical calculations, but
sternly interdicted instruction in reading and writing;<a

reading, forbidding any coloured persons, bond or free, to be taught
not only reading and writing, but spelling.<a name="FnAnchor1904"
href="#Footnote1904"><span class="sp">1904</span></a> In all these
States the prohibition referred to the master of the slave as well as
to other persons. In Virginia, on the other hand, the master might
teach his slaves whatever he liked, but others might not.<a

<p>There is yet another point in which the master’s power was
restricted in a most unusual manner: in many cases he was not allowed
to liberate his slave, or great obstacles were put in the way of
manumission, both in many of the Slave States<a name="FnAnchor1906"
href="#Footnote1906"><span class="sp">1906</span></a> and throughout
the British West Indies prior to the Emancipation Act.<a
name="FnAnchor1907" href="#Footnote1907"><span
class="sp">1907</span></a> In Saint Christopher, in the year 1802, a
tax of £1,000 was imposed on the manumission of any slave who was not
a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page301"></a>301</span> native of, or
had not resided for two years within, the island, while natives or
residents might be enfranchised at half that price. But the authors of
this enactment went further still. They considered that a master,
though unwilling to pay £1,000 or £500 for the legal enfranchisement
of his slave, might, during his own life, make him or her practically
free by not exercising his own rights as master. Hence they enacted
“that if any proprietor of a slave should, by any contract in writing
or otherwise, dispense with the slave’s service, or should be proved
before a justice of peace not to have exercised any right of ownership
over such slave, and maintained him or her at his own expense, within
a month, the slave should be publicly sold at vendue by the
provost-marshal; and should become the property of the purchaser, and
the purchase-money should be paid into the colonial treasury.”<a
name="FnAnchor1908" href="#Footnote1908"><span
class="sp">1908</span></a> In St. Vincents £100 should be paid into
the treasury for each slave sought to be manumitted,<a
name="FnAnchor1909" href="#Footnote1909"><span
class="sp">1909</span></a> whilst in Barbadoes a person minded to
manumit a slave should pay £50 to the churchwarden of the parish in
which he resided.<a name="FnAnchor1910" href="#Footnote1910"><span
class="sp">1910</span></a> Very different were the Spanish laws on the
subject of manumission. According to a law of 1528, a negro slave who
had served a certain length of time was entitled to his liberty upon
the payment of a certain sum, not less than twenty marks of gold, the
exact amount to be settled by the royal authorities.<a
name="FnAnchor1911" href="#Footnote1911"><span
class="sp">1911</span></a> In 1540 a law was issued to the effect that
“if any negro, or negress, or any other persons reputed slaves, should
publicly demand their liberty, they should be heard, and justice be
done to them, and care be taken that they should not on that account
be maltreated by their masters.”<a name="FnAnchor1912"
href="#Footnote1912"><span class="sp">1912</span></a> Nay, a slave who
wished to change his master and could prevail on any other person to
buy him by appraisement, could demand and compel such a transfer,<a
name="FnAnchor1913" href="#Footnote1913"><span
class="sp">1913</span></a> and a master who treated his slaves
inhumanly could be by the judge deprived of them.<a
name="FnAnchor1914" href="#Footnote1914"><span
class="sp">1914</span></a> In the French islands a negro who had been
cruelly treated, contrary to royal ordinances, was forfeited to the
crown, and acquired, if not freedom, at least deliverance from a
tyrannical master;<a name="FnAnchor1915" href="#Footnote1915"><span
class="sp">1915</span></a> but the Court which <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page302"></a>302</span> adjudged the offence
might also decree the sufferer to be manumitted.<a name="FnAnchor1916"

<p>This extraordinary system of slavery was not only recognised by
Christian governments, but was supported by the large bulk of the
clergy, Catholic<a name="FnAnchor1919" href="#Footnote1919"><span
class="sp">1919</span></a> and Protestant alike. In the beginning of
the abolitionist movement the Churches acknowledged slavery to be a
great evil, but with the making of this acknowledgment they believed
that they had done their share, and denied that there was any
obligation on them, or even that they had any right, to proceed
against the slave-holders. But things did not stop here. The
lamentations of resignation were gradually changed into excuses, and
the excuses into justifications.<a name="FnAnchor1920"
href="#Footnote1920"><span class="sp">1920</span></a> The Bible, it
was said, contains no prohibition of slavery; on the contrary, slavery
is recognised both in the Old and New Testaments. Abraham, the father
of the faithful and the friend of God, had slaves; the Hebrews were
directed to make slaves of the surrounding nations; St. Paul and St.
Peter approved of the relation of master and slave when they gave
admonitions to both as to their reciprocal behaviour; the Saviour
himself said nothing in condemnation of slavery, although it existed
in great aggravation while he was upon earth. If slavery were sinful,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303"></a>303</span> would it have
been too much to expect that the Almighty had directed at least one
little word against it in the last revelation of His will?<a
name="FnAnchor1921" href="#Footnote1921"><span
class="sp">1921</span></a> Nay, God not only permitted slavery, but
absolutely provided for its perpetuity;<a name="FnAnchor1922"
href="#Footnote1922"><span class="sp">1922</span></a> it is the very
legislation of Heaven itself;<a name="FnAnchor1923"
href="#Footnote1923"><span class="sp">1923</span></a> it is an
institution which it is a religious duty to maintain,<a
name="FnAnchor1924" href="#Footnote1924"><span
class="sp">1924</span></a> and which cannot be abolished, because “God
is pledged to sustain it.”<a name="FnAnchor1925"
href="#Footnote1925"><span class="sp">1925</span></a> According to
some, slavery was founded on the judgment of God on a damned race, the
descendants of Ham (as Augustine said); according to others it was
only in this way that the African could be raised to a participation
of Christianity and civilisation.<a name="FnAnchor1926"
href="#Footnote1926"><span class="sp">1926</span></a> With the name of
“abolitionist” was thus associated the idea of infidelity, and the
emancipation movement was branded as an attempt to spread the evils of
scepticism through the land.<a name="FnAnchor1927"
href="#Footnote1927"><span class="sp">1927</span></a> According to
Governor Macduffie, of South Carolina, no human institution is more
manifestly consistent with the will of God than slavery, and every
community ought to punish the interference of abolitionists with
death, without the benefit of clergy, “regarding the authors of it as
enemies of the human race.”<a name="FnAnchor1928"
href="#Footnote1928"><span class="sp">1928</span></a> It is true that
religious arguments were also adduced in favour of abolition. To hold
men in bondage was said to be utterly inconsistent with the
inalienable rights which the Creator had granted mankind, and still
more obviously at variance with the dictates of Christian love.<a
name="FnAnchor1929" href="#Footnote1929"><span
class="sp">1929</span></a> Many clergymen also joined the
abolitionists. But it seems that in the middle of the nineteenth
century the Quakers and the United Brethren were the only religious
bodies that regarded slave-holding and slave-dealing as ecclesiastical
offences.<a name="FnAnchor1930" href="#Footnote1930"><span
class="sp">1930</span></a> The American Churches were said to be “the
bulwarks of American slavery.”<a name="FnAnchor1931"

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote1919"></a><a

represent the Roman Catholic clergy as ardent abolitionists (A.

S. de Locqueneuille, <i>L’esclavage, ses promoteurs et ses
adversaires</i>, [Liège, 1890], p. 193) are certainly not justified by
facts. Among the Catholics of the United States there were some
advocates of emancipation, but their number was not large (Goodell,
<i>Slavery and Anti-Slavery</i>, p. 195 <i>sq.</i>; T. Parker,
<i>Collected Works</i>, vi [London, 1864], p. 127 <i>sq.</i>). Dr.
England, the Catholic bishop of Charleston, South Carolina, undertook
in public to prove that the Catholic Church had always been the
uncompromising friend of slave-holding (Parker, <i><span class="ib"

Brazil it was common for clergymen not only to possess slaves, but to
buy and sell them with as little scruple as other merchandises (L. A.
da Fonseca, <i>A escravidão, o clero e o abolicionismo</i> [Bahia,
1887], pp. 28, 33). Bishop Bouvier wrote (<i><span class="ib"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page304"></a>304</span> Nobody would
suppose that this attitude towards slavery was due to religious zeal.
It was one of those cases, only too frequent in the history of morals,
in which religion is called in to lend its sanction to a social
institution agreeable to the leaders of religious opinion. Many
clergymen and missionaries were themselves slave-holders,<a
name="FnAnchor1932" href="#Footnote1932"><span
class="sp">1932</span></a> the chapel funds largely rested on slave
property,<a name="FnAnchor1933" href="#Footnote1933"><span
class="sp">1933</span></a> and the ministers naturally desired to be
on friendly terms with the more important members of their respective
congregations, who were commonly owners of slaves. It is interesting
to notice how slow the anti-slavery movement among the Quakers was
towards practical achievement. It was in 1675 that a companion of
George Fox, after visiting Barbadoes, delivered a remonstrance to
Friends in Maryland and Virginia against slave-holding; but although
from that time on sporadic protests against it were made in
Pennsylvania, “the Society gave these memorials a cold reception. The
love of gain and power was too strong on the part of the wealthy and
influential planters and merchants, who had become slaveholders, to
allow the scruples of the Chester meeting to take the shape of
discipline.” Not until John Woolman had devoted the latter part of his
life (from 1742 to 1762) to a crusade against slave-dealing and
slave-holding was the Society solidly converted to the cause of
abolition.<a name="FnAnchor1934" href="#Footnote1934"><span
class="sp">1934</span></a> But Adam Smith makes the remark that the
resolution of the Quakers in Pennsylvania to set at liberty all their
slaves, was due to the fact that the principal produce there was corn,
the raising of which cannot afford the expense of slave cultivation;
had the slaves “made any considerable part of their property, such a
resolution could never have been agreed to.”<a name="FnAnchor1935"
href="#Footnote1935"><span class="sp">1935</span></a> As regards the
Parliamentary act against the slave trade in 1807 and the emancipation
of all slaves in British dominions in 1833, it has been pointed out
that “the success of the abolitionists lay, among other things, in the
economic aspects of the question. While the long battle for the
abolition of the slave trade was being waged, it became evident that
it would be far cheaper to increase the number of slaves by
propagation than to continue importing fresh supplies from Africa; and
later, when the abolitionists turned their attention to the extinction
of slavery itself, the change in the economic condition of the West
Indies gave added impetus to the anti-slavery cause.”<a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page305"></a>305</span> To explain the
establishment of colonial slavery, the laws relating to it, and the
difficulties in the way of its abolition, it is necessary to consider
not only economic conditions and the motive of self-interest, but also
the want of sympathy for, or positive antipathy to, the coloured race.
The negro was looked upon almost as an animal, according to some he
was a being without a soul.<a name="FnAnchor1937"
href="#Footnote1937"><span class="sp">1937</span></a> Even the free
negro was a pariah, subject to special laws and regulations. In the
Code of Louisiana it is said: “Free people of colour ought never to
insult or strike white people, nor presume to conceive themselves
equal to the whites; but, on the contrary, they ought to yield to them
on every occasion, and never speak or answer them but with respect,
under the penalty of imprisonment, according to the nature of the
offence.”<a name="FnAnchor1938" href="#Footnote1938"><span
class="sp">1938</span></a> The ‘Code Noir’ prohibited white men and
women from marrying negroes, “à peine de punition et d’amende
arbitraire”;<a name="FnAnchor1939" href="#Footnote1939"><span
class="sp">1939</span></a> and in the Revised Statutes of North
Carolina we read: “If any white man or woman, being free, shall marry
with an Indian, negro, mustee or mulatto man or woman, or any person
of mixed blood to the third generation, bond or free, he shall, by
judgment of the county court, forfeit and pay the sum of one hundred
dollars to the use of the county.”<a name="FnAnchor1940"
href="#Footnote1940"><span class="sp">1940</span></a> In Mississippi a
free negro or mulatto was legally punished with thirty-nine lashes if
he exercised the functions of a minister of the gospel.<a
name="FnAnchor1941" href="#Footnote1941"><span
class="sp">1941</span></a> Coloured men in the North were excluded
from colleges and high schools, from theological seminaries and from
respectable churches, as also from the town hall, the ballot, and the
cemetery where white people were interred.<a name="FnAnchor1942"
href="#Footnote1942"><span class="sp">1942</span></a> The Anglo-Saxon
aversion to the black race is thus expressed by an English writer: “We
hate slavery, but we hate the negroes still more.”<a
name="FnAnchor1943" href="#Footnote1943"><span
class="sp">1943</span></a> Among the Spaniards and Portuguese racial
antipathies were not so strong, and their slaves were consequently
better treated.<a name="FnAnchor1944" href="#Footnote1944"><span

<p>As the slavery existing in Mohammedan countries has partly served
as an excuse for their annexation by Christian powers, it is
interesting to compare Islam’s attitude towards slavery with that
which not long before had prevailed in the Christian world. The slave
should be treated with kindness; the Prophet said: <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page306"></a>306</span> “A man who behaves ill
to his slave will not enter into paradise.” The master should give to
his slaves of the food which he eats himself, and of the clothes with
which he clothes himself. He should not order them to do anything
beyond their power, and in the hot season, during the hottest hours of
the day, he should let them rest. He may marry them to whom he will,
but he may not separate them when married; nor must he separate a
mother from her child. The Prophet said: “Whoever is the cause of
separation between mother and child, by selling or giving, God will
separate him from his friends on the day of resurrection.” To liberate
a slave is regarded as an act highly acceptable to God, and as an
expiation for certain sins. These rules, it should be added, are not
only recognised in theory, but derive additional support from general
usage. In the Mohammedan world the slave generally lives on easy terms

<h4>CHAPTER XV</h4>
<h3>THE REGARD FOR TRUTH</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">I</span><span class="smcap">N</span> the New Testament there are several
passages condemning lying. According to the Apocalypse, whosoever
loveth and maketh a lie “may not enter the heavenly city,<a
name="FnAnchor1946" href="#Footnote1946"><span
class="sp">1946</span></a> but all liars shall have their part in the
lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.”<a name="FnAnchor1947"
href="#Footnote1947"><span class="sp">1947</span></a> In the Epistle
to the Ephesians it is said: “Putting away lying, speak every man
truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.”<a
name="FnAnchor1948" href="#Footnote1948"><span
class="sp">1948</span></a> Paul wrote to the Colossians: “Lie not one
to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds.”<a
name="FnAnchor1949" href="#Footnote1949"><span
class="sp">1949</span></a> In his first letter to the Corinthians,
however, he describes himself as something of a hypocrite:<a
name="FnAnchor1950" href="#Footnote1950"><span
class="sp">1950</span></a> “Unto the Jews I became as a Jew, That I
might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law,
that I might gain them that are under the law; To them that are
without law, as without law (being not without law to God, but under
the law to Christ), that I might gain them that are without law. To
the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all
things to all men, that I might by all means save some. And this I do
for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.”<a

<p>According to Augustine, a lie is always and necessarily sinful; it
is not permissible even when told with a view to saving the life of a
neighbour, “since by lying eternal life is lost, never for any man’s
temporal life must a lie be told.”<a name="FnAnchor1952"
href="#Footnote1952"><span class="sp">1952</span></a> Yet all lies are
not equally sinful: the degree of sinfulness depends on the mind of
the liar and on the nature of the subject on which the lie is told.<a
name="FnAnchor1953" href="#Footnote1953"><span
class="sp">1953</span></a> Jokes which “bear with them in the tone of
voice, and in the very mood of the joker a most evident indication
that he means <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308"></a>308</span> no
deceit, are not accounted lies, though the thing he utters be not
true.”<a name="FnAnchor1954" href="#Footnote1954"><span
class="sp">1954</span></a> This statement is also incorporated in
Gratian’s <i>Decretum</i>.<a name="FnAnchor1955"
href="#Footnote1955"><span class="sp">1955</span></a> Thomas Aquinas
discusses with his usual thoroughness the questions whether a lie is
always a sin, and whether every lie is a mortal sin. “A lie has the
character of sinfulness, not only from the damage done to a neighbour,
but also from its own inordinateness. Now it is not lawful to employ
any unlawful inordinateness for the hindering of hurts and losses to
others; as it is not lawful to steal in order to give alms. And
therefore it is not lawful to tell a lie to deliver another from any
danger whatever. It is lawful, however, to hide the truth prudently
under some dissimulation, as Augustine says.” A lie is a mortal sin,
if it is opposed to charity by being uttered either to the injury of
God or to the hurt of our neighbour in his person, wealth, or good
name. “But if the end intended be not contrary to charity, neither
will the lie be a mortal sin in this respect; as appears in a jocose
lie, that is intended to create some slight amusement, and in an
officious lie, in which is intended even the advantage of our
neighbour.”<a name="FnAnchor1956" href="#Footnote1956"><span

<p>From early times, however, we meet within the Christian Church a
much less rigorous doctrine, which soon came to exercise a more
powerful influence on the practice and feelings of men. It was argued
that an untruth is not a lie when there is a “just cause” for it; and
as a just cause was regarded not only self-defence, but also zeal for
God’s honour. This zeal, together with an indiscriminate devotion to
the Church, led to those “pious frauds,” those innumerable
falsifications of documents, inventions of legends, and forgeries of
every description, which made the Church a veritable seat of lying,
and most seriously impaired the sense of truth in the minds of
Christians.<a name="FnAnchor1957" href="#Footnote1957"><span
class="sp">1957</span></a> Thus by a fiction Papacy, as a divine
institution, was traced back to the age of the Apostles; and in virtue
of another fiction Constantine was alleged to have abdicated his
imperial authority in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page309"></a>309</span> Italy in favour of the successor of St.
Peter.<a name="FnAnchor1958" href="#Footnote1958"><span
class="sp">1958</span></a> The Bishop of Rome assumed the privilege of
disengaging men from their oaths and promises. An oath which was
contrary to the good of the Church was declared not to be binding.<a
name="FnAnchor1959" href="#Footnote1959"><span
class="sp">1959</span></a> The theory was laid down that as faith was
not to be kept with a tyrant, pirate, or robber, who kills the body,
it was still less to be kept with an heretic, who kills the soul.<a
name="FnAnchor1960" href="#Footnote1960"><span
class="sp">1960</span></a> Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and most of the
later Fathers even charged God with falsehood in dealing with his
enemy, the devil, by offering him Christ’s soul in exchange for the
souls of men, although he knew that the devil could not keep hold of
Christ’s sinless soul, which would only cause him torture.<a
name="FnAnchor1961" href="#Footnote1961"><span
class="sp">1961</span></a> It would not have been the first time that
God had recourse to deceit for the purpose of carrying out his plans.
In order to ruin Ahab he commissioned a lying spirit to deceive his
prophets;<a name="FnAnchor1962" href="#Footnote1962"><span
class="sp">1962</span></a> and once he threatened to use deception as
a means of taking revenge upon idolaters.<a name="FnAnchor1963"

<p>Private protestations were thought sufficient to relieve men in
conscience from being bound by a solemn treaty or from the duty of
speaking the truth; and an equivocation, or play upon words in which
one sense is taken by the speaker and another sense intended by him
for the hearer, was in some cases also held permissible. According to
Alfonso de’ Liguori&mdash;who lived in the eighteenth century and was
beatified in the nineteenth, and whose writings were declared by high
authority not to contain a word that could be justly found fault
with<a name="FnAnchor1964" href="#Footnote1964"><span
class="sp">1964</span></a>&mdash;there are three sorts of equivocation
which may be employed for a good reason, even with the addition of a
solemn oath. We are allowed to use ambiguously words having two
senses, as the word <i>volo</i>, which means both to “wish” and to
“fly”; sentences bearing two main meanings, as “This book is Peter’s,”
which may mean either that the book belongs to Peter or that Peter is
the author of it; words having two senses, one more common than the
other or one literal and the other metaphorical&mdash;for instance, if
a man is asked about something which it is in his interest to conceal,
he may answer, “No, I say,” that is, “I say the word <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page310"></a>310</span> ‘no’.”<a
name="FnAnchor1965" href="#Footnote1965"><span
class="sp">1965</span></a> As for mental reservations, again, such as
are “purely mental,” and on that account cannot in any manner be
discovered by other persons, are not permissible; but we may, for a
good reason, make use of a “non-pure” mental reservation, which in the
nature of things is discoverable, although it is not discovered by the
person with whom we are dealing.<a name="FnAnchor1966"
href="#Footnote1966"><span class="sp">1966</span></a> Thus it would be
wrong secretly to insert the word “no” in an affirmative oath without
any external sign; but it would not be wrong to insert it in a
whispering voice or under the cover of a cough. The “good reason” for
which equivocations and non-pure mental reservations may be employed
is defined as “any honest object, such as keeping our goods spiritual
or temporal.”<a name="FnAnchor1967" href="#Footnote1967"><span
class="sp">1967</span></a> In support of this casuistry it is
uniformly said by Catholic apologists that each man has a right to act
upon the defensive, that he has a right to keep guard over the
knowledge which he possesses in the same way as he may defend his
goods; and as for there being any deceit in the matter&mdash;why,
soldiers use stratagems in war, and opponents use feints in fencing.<a

<p>Protestant moralists reject the doctrine of mental reservation, and
adopt a less formal view as to falsehood than is taken by the Roman
Catholic theologians. They teach that the malice of lying consists in
its being an offence against justice, truth being a debt which we owe
our fellow-men, and that when that debt ceases falsehood is
legitimate.<a name="FnAnchor1969" href="#Footnote1969"><span
class="sp">1969</span></a> But there have also been the Puritan
insistence on literal truthfulness and distrust of works of
imagination, alike poetry and romance, and the early Quakers’ battle
against insincerity in their theeing and thouing and refusal of giving
titles of respect. Thomas Ellwood wrote in his autobiography: “I durst
not say, Sir, Master, My Lord, Madam (or My dame); or say Your Servant
to any one to whom I did not stand in the real relation of a servant,
which I had never done to any. . . . Again, the corrupt and unsound
form of speaking in the plural number to a single person, <i>you</i>
to one, instead of <i>thou</i>, contrary to the pure, plain, and
single language of truth, <i>thou</i> to one, and <i>you</i> to more
than one, which had always been used by God and men, and men to God,
as well as one to another . . . hath greatly debased the spirits and
depraved the manners of men.”<a name="FnAnchor1970"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page311"></a>311</span> According to
the Catholic doctrine, formulated by Aquinas, the most grievous and
mortal of all lies is that which is contrary to the charity of God,
whose truth is obscured or misrepresented by it; and “a lie of this
nature is not only opposed to the virtue of charity, but also to the
virtue of faith and religion.”<a name="FnAnchor1971"
href="#Footnote1971"><span class="sp">1971</span></a> As Augustine
said, “it is far more tolerable to lie in those things that are
unconnected with religion than to be deceived in those without belief
in, or knowledge of, which God cannot be worshipped.”<a
name="FnAnchor1972" href="#Footnote1972"><span
class="sp">1972</span></a> In agreement with Augustine, who defined
faith as “cum assensione cogitare,” Aquinas also asserts that it is
“an act of the intellect, assenting to divine truth by command of the
will, moved by God’s grace; and thus is under the control of freewill
in reference to God. Hence the act of faith may be meritorious.”<a
name="FnAnchor1973" href="#Footnote1973"><span
class="sp">1973</span></a> So also unbelief is in the intellect, but
the cause of it is in the will, and therefore it is a sin, and indeed
a sin greater than all sins of moral perversity.<a name="FnAnchor1974"
href="#Footnote1974"><span class="sp">1974</span></a> By insisting
that unbelief is “in the will as its prime mover” Aquinas thinks that
he has proved its sinful character.</p>

<p>The faith which the Christian Churches have regarded as an
indispensable condition of salvation implies belief in the power and
dignity of Christ as Messiah and Lord and in the reality of his
redemption. In the Catholic conception of faith it is faith in the
Church, who is the guarantor of the truth of her doctrines.<a
name="FnAnchor1975" href="#Footnote1975"><span
class="sp">1975</span></a> What then about those who have never heard
of Christ and his Church, and whose unbelief therefore cannot possibly
be due to their will? Some early Fathers admitted the possible
salvation of pagans&mdash;Justin Martyr expressly said that Socrates
and Heraclitus in the sight of God were Christians<a
name="FnAnchor1976" href="#Footnote1976"><span
class="sp">1976</span></a>&mdash;but the vast majority of the Fathers
and the Church held a different opinion.<a name="FnAnchor1977"
href="#Footnote1977"><span class="sp">1977</span></a> “Hold most
firmly,” said Fulgentius, “and doubt not that not only all pagans but
also all Jews, heretics, and schismatics who depart from this present
life outside the Catholic Church are about to go into eternal fire,
prepared for the devil and his angels.”<a name="FnAnchor1978"
href="#Footnote1978"><span class="sp">1978</span></a> This doctrine
was deemed so prominent and unquestionable that the Council of
Carthage, in the fourth century, made it one of the test-questions put
to every bishop before <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page312"></a>312</span> ordination.<a name="FnAnchor1979"
href="#Footnote1979"><span class="sp">1979</span></a> Aquinas, again,
argues that in those who have heard nothing of the faith, unbelief has
not the character of a sin, but rather of a penalty, inasmuch as such
ignorance of divine things is a consequence of the sin of our first
parent, and that, consequently, “unbelievers of this class are damned
for other sins that cannot be forgiven without faith, but they are not
damned for the sin of unbelief.”<a name="FnAnchor1980"

<p>All the Lutherans and Reformed and the sects which separated from
them held that faith in the Church, their own Church, or at any rate
faith in Christ, was necessary for salvation.<a name="FnAnchor1981"
href="#Footnote1981"><span class="sp">1981</span></a> Luther is clear
that outside Christendom there is no forgiveness and can be no
holiness.<a name="FnAnchor1982" href="#Footnote1982"><span
class="sp">1982</span></a> Calvin says: “Beyond the bosom of the
Church, no remission of sins is to be hoped for, nor any salvation.”<a
name="FnAnchor1983" href="#Footnote1983"><span
class="sp">1983</span></a> The Anglican Article XIII. denies that
“works done before the grace of Christ” are pleasant to God; “yea
rather, for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded
them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of sin.” In the
Westminster Confession of Faith the divines declared the opinion that
men not professing Christianity may be saved to be “very pernicious,
and to be detested”;<a name="FnAnchor1984" href="#Footnote1984"><span
class="sp">1984</span></a> and in their Larger Catechism they
expressly said that “they who, having never heard the gospel, know not
Jesus Christ, and believe not in him, cannot be saved, be they never

href="#Footnote1985"><span class="sp">1985</span></a> Among the
leading Reformers Zwingli was the only one who openly and
unequivocally repudiated the doctrine of exclusive salvation. In a
Confession of Faith which he wrote just before his death he described
that future “assembly of all the saintly, the heroic, the faithful,
and the virtuous,” when Abel and Enoch, Noah and Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, will mingle with “Socrates, Aristides, and Antigonus, with Numa
and Camillus, Hercules and Theseus, the Scipios and the Catos,” and
when every upright and holy man who has ever lived will be present
with God. On reading this Luther said he despaired of the salvation of
Zwingli.<a name="FnAnchor1986" href="#Footnote1986"><span

<p>Unfortunately it was not left to the Almighty alone to avenge the
injury done to him by the sin of unbelief, but in this case also the
principle that it belongs to the worldly authorities to appease his
anger was acted upon. And a lie about divine things is not only an
offence against God, but also a corruption of the faith, whereby the
life of the soul is sustained; and this is much worse than to temper
with the coinage, which is only an aid to temporal life. “Hence,” says
Aquinas, “if coiners or other malefactors are at once handed over by
secular princes to a just death, much more may heretics, immediately
they are convicted of heresy, be not only excommunicated, but also
justly done to die.” <a name="FnAnchor1990" href="#Footnote1990"><span

<p>The opinions of the early Fathers on persecution were divided.
Those who wrote when a pagan or heretical power was supreme were the
champions of toleration, but those who wrote when the Church was in
the ascendency usually inclined to persecution. Foremost among the
latter was Augustine. As long as the Donatists had the upper hand in
Africa he stood for the rights of conscience, but when the balance of
material force was with Catholicism he changed his mind. It was
merciful, he contended, to punish heretics even by death, if this
could save them or others from the eternal suffering that awaited the
unconverted; and he adduced as applicable precedents all the worst
persecutions mentioned in the Old Testament.<a name="FnAnchor1991"
href="#Footnote1991"><span class="sp">1991</span></a> From the moment
the Church obtained civil power under Constantine the general
principle of coercion was admitted and acted on both against Jews,
heretics, and pagans.<a name="FnAnchor1992" href="#Footnote1992"><span
class="sp">1992</span></a> The first law that has come <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page314"></a>314</span> down to us in which the

law 9 ‘De Hereticis’ in the Theodosian Code, which was made by
Theodosius the Great, but it was applicable only to some sects of
Manichæans.<a name="FnAnchor1993" href="#Footnote1993"><span
class="sp">1993</span></a> For a long time, however, the clergy were
reluctant to sanction the death of heretics, though very desirous to
suppress their worship by force, and to banish their teachers from the
empire. Spain was the first country to shed a Christian’s blood for
the sake of Christian orthodoxy. The emperor and the bishops
responsible for murdering Priscillian were Spaniards; and it was in a
letter to a Spanish bishop (in 447) that Bishop Leo of Rome frankly
rejoiced to think how the civil power aids the Church’s “law of
gentleness” by inflicting capital punishment on heretics like the
Priscillians.<a name="FnAnchor1994" href="#Footnote1994"><span

<p>After the suppression of paganism in the Roman Empire, however,
religious persecution was very rare for centuries, because heresies
scarcely appeared, and the few that arose were quite insignificant.
But as soon as the revival of learning commenced there was a change.
This happened in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. In 1199
Innocentius III. issued a decree which led to the foundation of the
Inquisition.<a name="FnAnchor1995" href="#Footnote1995"><span
class="sp">1995</span></a> Shortly afterwards began the massacre of
the Albigenses in the south of France. The papal legate wrote
jubilantly that at the capture of Béziers nearly 20,000 persons were
killed&mdash;men, women, and children together. When some of the
soldiers asked how they should distinguish orthodox from heretics, the
legate gave the order, “Kill them all, for God knows his own.”<a
name="FnAnchor1996" href="#Footnote1996"><span

enjoined all rulers as they desired to be esteemed faithful, to swear

branded as heretics by the Church.<a name="FnAnchor1997"

<p>In 1231 burning alive was made the regular mode of execution; and
it took place after the constancy of the victim had been tried by the
most excruciating torture. Not infrequently he was burnt alive by a

<p>The number of persons who suffered death at the stake cannot be
given with any confidence. Llorente, who had free access to the
archives of the Spanish Inquisition, assures us that by that tribunal
alone more than 31,000 persons were burnt, and more than 290,000
condemned to punishments less severe than death.<a name="FnAnchor2003"
href="#Footnote2003"><span class="sp">2003</span></a> On August 24
(St. Bartholomew’s Day) 1572 began the famous massacres in France in
which about 70,000 Huguenots were slain. After the beginning of the
eighteenth century, persecution became less sanguinary, though in
Spain over a thousand persons are said to have been burnt in the first
half of the century.<a name="FnAnchor2004" href="#Footnote2004"><span
class="sp">2004</span></a> But there was no relaxation in Catholic
theory. In 1808 Napoleon abolished the Spanish Inquisition; but when
his power fell, it was restored there and in the Papal States.<a
name="FnAnchor2005" href="#Footnote2005"><span
class="sp">2005</span></a> In 1885, in the encyclical ‘Immortale Dei,’
Leo XIII. blamed all States that granted equal rights to every creed;
and in 1888 he issued another encyclical, in which he laid down that
the State ought to profess only Catholicism, and that “although in the
extraordinary condition of these times the Church usually acquiesces
in certain modern liberties . . . because she judges it expedient to
permit them, she would in happier times exercise her own liberty.”<a
name="FnAnchor2006" href="#Footnote2006"><span
class="sp">2006</span></a> In <i>The Catholic Encyclopedia</i>,

rigours of the Inquisition offend the feelings of later ages in which
there is less regard for the purity of faith, but that they did not
antagonise the feelings of their own time, when heresy was looked upon
as more malignant than treason. “Toleration came in only when faith
went out; lenient measures were <span class="pagenum"><a

<p>Religious persecution was not peculiar to the Catholics but was
also practised by the Protestants, though on a smaller scale. The
early documents of the Reformation contain brilliant declarations of
the rights of conscience;<a name="FnAnchor2008"
href="#Footnote2008"><span class="sp">2008</span></a> it was, of
course, only by an appeal to those rights that the Reformers could
justify their own attitude towards Roman Catholicism. But it is one
thing to claim liberty for oneself, and another to accord it to
others. All round about Luther and Melanchthon sprang up a crop of
heresies with which they had no sympathy.<a name="FnAnchor2009"
href="#Footnote2009"><span class="sp">2009</span></a> Luther writes to
the Elector John, begging him to silence a certain Hans Mohr, who was
spreading Zwinglian opinions in Coburg;<a name="FnAnchor2010"
href="#Footnote2010"><span class="sp">2010</span></a> and in another
place he lays down as a rule for the treatment of unbelievers in an
evangelical State that if after instruction they still persist, they
are to be made to hold their tongues.<a name="FnAnchor2011"
href="#Footnote2011"><span class="sp">2011</span></a> But his
intolerance chiefly spends itself in violent words, and he objects to
inflicting capital punishment in cases of heresy. In 1526 he writes in
reference to Anabaptists: “It is not right, and I think it great pity,
that such wretched people should be so miserably slain, burned,
cruelly put to death; every one should be allowed to believe what he
will. If he believes wrongly, he will have punishment enough in the
eternal fire of hell.”<a name="FnAnchor2012"
href="#Footnote2012"><span class="sp">2012</span></a> In another
letter he writes: “I am slow to adopt the judgment of blood, even
where it is abundantly deserved. . . . I can in no way admit that
false teachers should be put to death; it is enough that they should
be banished.”<a name="FnAnchor2013" href="#Footnote2013"><span
class="sp">2013</span></a> Melanchthon was less merciful. He writes
that sedition ought to be suppressed by the sword, and that
blasphemers, even if not seditious, should be put to death by the
civil magistrate; there were precedents for this course in the law of
Moses.<a name="FnAnchor2014" href="#Footnote2014"><span
class="sp">2014</span></a> And he did not hesitate to express his
entire approval of the burning of the “blasphemer”, Servetus, whom
Calvin had arrested and condemned to the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page317"></a>317</span> flames,<a name="FnAnchor2015"
href="#Footnote2015"><span class="sp">2015</span></a> although he was
only a wayfarer in Geneva, over whom neither Calvin nor the
magistrates of the city had a shadow of jurisdiction. Calvin lays down
with great distinctness the duty of repressing heresy by force.<a
name="FnAnchor2016" href="#Footnote2016"><span
class="sp">2016</span></a> Even Zwingli, who speaks of a heaven in
which Christians may expect to meet the wise and good of heathen
antiquity, approved of putting false teachers to death,<a

<p>In England, on the accession of Elizabeth, a law was made
prohibiting any religious service other than the Prayer-book, the
penalty for the third offence being imprisonment for life. Both before
the Reformation, and during the Reformation, and after the
Reformation&mdash;down to 1678&mdash;it was a rule of the common law
that an Englishman could be burned as a heretic by virtue of a State
writ.<a name="FnAnchor2019" href="#Footnote2019"><span
class="sp">2019</span></a> Presbyterians, through a long succession of
reigns, were imprisoned, branded, mutilated, scourged, and exposed in
pillory; many Catholics under false pretences were tortured and hung;
Anabaptists and Arians were burnt alive. In Ireland the religion of
the immense majority of the people was banned and prescribed, and when
in 1626 the Government manifested some slight wish to grant it partial
relief, nearly all the Protestant bishops assembled to protest in a
solemn resolution against the indulgence.<a name="FnAnchor2020"
href="#Footnote2020"><span class="sp">2020</span></a> When the
Reformation triumphed in Scotland, one of its first fruits was a law
which declared that whoever either said mass, or was present while it
was said, should for the first offence lose his goods, for the second
offence be exiled, and for the third offence be put to death.<a
name="FnAnchor2021" href="#Footnote2021"><span
class="sp">2021</span></a> According to Lecky, it was in Scotland, in
1697, that the last execution for heresy on British soil took place,
and in Scotland again, in 1727, that the sin of witchcraft was last
punished with death by any British authority. He believes that in no
part of Protestant Europe prosecutions for witchcraft were so
frequent, persistent, and ferocious as there. It was to the ministers
that the persecution was mainly due; and in 1736 the associated
Presbytery <span class="pagenum"><a id="page318"></a>318</span> left a
solemn protest against the repeal of the laws against witchcraft as an
infraction of the express word of God.<a name="FnAnchor2022"
href="#Footnote2022"><span class="sp">2022</span></a> The Puritans,
who, when a minority, demanded freedom as passionately as minorities
always will, were no lovers of toleration for its own sake: “where
they controlled the State, as they showed in New England, they were
ready to enforce conformity to their own views, and to exert a
discipline no less drastic than that of their enemies.” Even Cromwell,
who called God to witness that “no man in England doth suffer for the
testimony of Jesus,” was unable in his hour of triumph to grant
freedom to Anglicans and Catholics.<a name="FnAnchor2023"

<p>After discussing the persecutions of the Christian Churches, Dean
Inge<a name="FnAnchor2024" href="#Footnote2024"><span
class="sp">2024</span></a> expresses the opinion that almost
everything which offends the antagonists of Christianity comes from
ecclesiasticism, not from Christianity. True, in its early days there
were no other persecutions than those of which the Christians
themselves were the victims. But it cannot be denied that early
Christianity contained seeds productive of the persecuting spirit. It
accepted the divine authority of the Old Testament. Like other
monotheistic religions that attribute human emotions and passions to
their godhead&mdash;Zoroastrianism and Mohammedanism&mdash;that of the
Hebrews was an intolerant religion. Yahveh said: “Thou shalt have no
other gods before me. . . . I the Lord thy God is a jealous God.” In
the pre-prophetic period the existence of other gods was recognised,
but they were not to be worshipped by Yahveh’s people. Nor was any
mercy to be shown to their followers, for Yahveh was “a man of war.”<a
name="FnAnchor2025" href="#Footnote2025"><span
class="sp">2025</span></a> The god of Christianity inherited his
jealousy; and Augustine and other advocates of religious persecutions
expressly appealed in justification of them to those mentioned in the
Old Testament. Polytheism, on the other hand, is by nature tolerant: a
god who is always used to share with other gods the worship of his
believers cannot be a very jealous god. Among the early Greeks and
Romans it was a principle that the religion of the State should be the
religion of the people, as its welfare was supposed to depend upon a
strict observance of the established cult; but the gods mainly cared
for external worship, and took little notice even of expressed
opinions. Philosophers openly <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page319"></a>319</span> despised the very rites which they both
defended and practised; and religion was more a pretext than a real
motive for the persecutions of men like Anaxagoras, Protagoras,
Socrates, and Aristotle.<a name="FnAnchor2026"
href="#Footnote2026"><span class="sp">2026</span></a> In the
collection of Roman laws before Constantine we search in vain for any
enactment aimed at free thought, and in the history of the Emperors
there was no prosecution of abstract doctrine. The measures by which
the Romans in earlier times repressed the introduction of new
religions were largely suggested by worldly considerations; and it has
been sufficiently proved that the persecutions of the Christians
during the pagan Empire sprang from motives quite different to
religious intolerance. Liberty of worship was a general principle of
the Imperial rule. That it was denied the Christians was due to their
own aggressiveness, as also to political suspicion. They grossly
insulted the pagan cult, denouncing it as the worship of demons; they
refused to offer sacrifice on behalf of the Emperor; and calamities
that fell upon the Empire were in consequence regarded by the populace
as the righteous vengeance of the offended gods. Their proselytism
disturbed the peace of families and towns. Their secret meetings
aroused suspicion of political danger; and this suspicion was
increased by the doctrines they professed. They considered the Roman
Empire a manifestation of Antichrist, they looked forward with longing
to its destruction, and many of them refused to take part in its
defence. The greatest and best among the pagans spoke of the
Christians as “enemies,” or “haters of the human race.”<a

<p>An ecclesiastical reason for the Christian persecutions was
undoubtedly that the cohesion and power of the Church, which regarded
itself as the sole possessor of divine truth, depended upon a strict
adherence to its doctrines. There were also worldly grounds for them.
One was greed. The inquisitor Eymeric complained in 1375: “In our days
there are no more rich heretics, so that princes, not seeing much
money in prospect, will not put themselves to any expense; it is a
pity that so salutary an institution as ours should be so uncertain of
its future.”<a name="FnAnchor2028" href="#Footnote2028"><span
class="sp">2028</span></a> Another ground which induced Christian
princes to persecute heretics was fear of their political influence.
Certain heresies, as Manichæism and Donatism, were expressly declared
to affect the common welfare; and the Frankish kings treated heretics
not only as rebels against the Church, but as traitors to the State,
as confederates of hostile Visigoths or Burgundians or <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page320"></a>320</span> Lombards.<a
name="FnAnchor2029" href="#Footnote2029"><span
class="sp">2029</span></a> But whatever other grounds there may have
been for the persecutions committed by the Christians, the principal
one was unquestionably the doctrine of exclusive justification by
faith; and this was not an ecclesiastical invention, but the leading
idea in the Pauline epistles. Thus Paul, who before his conversion had
been persecuting the Christians, became afterwards an indirect cause
of religious persecution on an infinitely greater scale, to which
there has been no parallel outside Christendom. It is significant that
the reviver of Paulinism, Augustine, also was the spiritual father of
persecution.</p>

61.</p></div>

<p>The persecutions were by no means ineffective. Before operating in
any district the inquisitors used to make a proclamation offering
pardon under certain conditions to those who confessed and retracted
their heresies within thirty or forty days; and Mariana says that when
such a proclamation was made on the first establishment of the
Inquisition in Andalusia, 17,000 recantations followed.<a
name="FnAnchor2030" href="#Footnote2030"><span
class="sp">2030</span></a> This was presumably regarded as a triumph
of truth; but it was scarcely a triumph of truthfulness. Augustine
himself writes that we must avoid the lie and, even when we err in our
thought, must always say what we think.<a name="FnAnchor2031"
href="#Footnote2031"><span class="sp">2031</span></a> But it is not
only by persecutions that the Christian Churches have impaired the
spirit of truth: they have also done it by softer means&mdash;by
inducing the State to make the profession of a certain creed, or at
any rate the performance of certain religious rites, a condition of
the enjoyment of full civic rights. And this is what even Protestant
countries have been doing up to our own time. In the case of the
clergy, too, there is considerable inducement to insincerity. Mr.
Harvey writes in a book on <i>The Church and the Twentieth
Century</i>: “It is to be feared that even now the Church is not
universally regarded as pre-eminently the home of truthfulness. The
more intelligent layman suspects his clergyman of practising a good
deal of mental reservation.”<a name="FnAnchor2032"
href="#Footnote2032"><span class="sp">2032</span></a> “While a man’s
livelihood and the happiness of his wife and children,” says the Rev.
R. Roberts, “are dependant on his defence of orthodoxy he is most
certainly forced into conformity. . . . It is orthodoxy holding the
pistol of starvation at the heretic’s head in the name of religion.”<a
name="FnAnchor2033" href="#Footnote2033"><span
class="sp">2033</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page321"></a>321</span> According to Dean Rashdall the most deadly
result of the doctrine of justification by faith is that it has
fostered the belief that honest thinking is sinful and blind credulity
meritorious. “It deters the clergy from study, from thought, and from
openly teaching what they themselves really believe.”<a

<p>The highest regard for truth is not to profess it, but to seek for
it. In this respect the Christian Churches have been most lamentably
deficient. While the knowledge of religious truth has been held to be
a necessary requirement of salvation, all other knowledge was for a
long time regarded not only as valueless but even as sinful. “The
wisdom of this world,” says Paul, “is foolishness with God.”<a
name="FnAnchor2035" href="#Footnote2035"><span
class="sp">2035</span></a> Tertullian expresses the ecclesiastical
contempt of scientific knowledge in the famous formula, <i>Credo quia
impossibile</i>, “I believe because it is impossible.” Lactantius in
particular expatiated on the nothingness of all worldly wisdom.<a
name="FnAnchor2036" href="#Footnote2036"><span
class="sp">2036</span></a> According to Aquinas, eagerness to learn
the truth may be a vice; as “when one seeks to learn the truth about
creatures without reference to the due end, which is the knowledge of
God. Hence Augustine says: ‘We must not gratify a curiosity, idle and
sure to be thrown away over the study of creatures; but we must make
of that study a ladder to ascend to immortal and everlasting
goods.’”<a name="FnAnchor2037" href="#Footnote2037"><span
class="sp">2037</span></a> Throughout the Middle Ages there is a
conflict between the learning of the Church and the study of the
classics. The latter might be useful only as a dialectic training
calculated to promote a scientific exposition and defence of the
ecclesiastical doctrines.<a name="FnAnchor2038"
href="#Footnote2038"><span class="sp">2038</span></a> Aquinas points
out that “though the study of philosophy in itself is lawful and
praiseworthy, still because some philosophers abuse it to assail the
faith, the Apostle says:<a name="FnAnchor2039"
href="#Footnote2039"><span class="sp">2039</span></a> ‘Beware lest any
man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition
of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.’”<a

<p>For centuries afterwards, as Lecky remarks, “every mental
disposition which philosophy pronounces to be essential to a
legitimate research was almost uniformly branded as a sin, and a large
proportion of the most deadly intellectual vices were deliberately
inculcated as virtues. It was a sin to doubt the opinions that had
been instilled in childhood before they had <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page322"></a>322</span> been examined. It was a virtue to hold
them with unwavering, unreasoning credulity. It was a sin to notice
and develop to its full consequences every objection to those
opinions, it was a virtue to stifle every objection as a suggestion of
the devil. It was sinful to study with equal attention and with an
indifferent mind the writings on both sides, sinful to resolve to
follow the light of evidence wherever it might lead, sinful to remain
poised in doubt between conflicting opinions, sinful to give only a
qualified assent to indecisive arguments, sinful even to recognise the
moral or intellectual excellence of opponents. In a word, there is
scarcely a disposition that marks the love of abstract truth, and
scarcely a rule which reason teaches as essential for its attainment,
that theologians did not for centuries stigmatise as offensive to the
Almighty.”<a name="FnAnchor2041" href="#Footnote2041"><span

Rationalism in Europe">op. cit.</span></i>  ii. 87
<i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>Lecky adds that from this frightful condition was Europe at last
rescued by the intellectual influences that produced the Reformation.
This may be true in a manner, but it was not the Reformation itself
that marked the change. It held out no hand of welcome to awakening
science; and it has been justly observed that even at a later time the
divines who looked most askance at it and claimed for their statements
an entire independence of modern knowledge were those who most loudly
declared their allegiance to the theology of the Reformation.<a
name="FnAnchor2042" href="#Footnote2042"><span
class="sp">2042</span></a> With Luther himself reason and faith were
mortal enemies: what Scripture imposes upon us was precisely what
reason would bid us reject. “All the articles of our Christian faith,”
he writes, “which God has revealed to us in His Word are in presence
of reason sheerly impossible”;<a name="FnAnchor2043"
href="#Footnote2043"><span class="sp">2043</span></a> and when his
natural reason rebelled against the violence which orthodox faith
offered to it, the revolt was ascribed to the direct agency of the
devil.<a name="FnAnchor2044" href="#Footnote2044"><span
class="sp">2044</span></a> In the middle of the seventeenth century a
powerful party was rising in England who said that all learning was
unfavourable to religion, and that it was sufficient for everybody to
be acquainted with his mother-tongue alone.<a name="FnAnchor2045"
href="#Footnote2045"><span class="sp">2045</span></a> Mr. Harvey
asserts that the Church of the nineteenth century lost the reputation
of putting truth in the first place; though the position is not so bad
as it was when Hort could speak of “a favourable specimen of the
conventional English ecclesiastical scholar, who does not willingly
violate <span class="pagenum"><a id="page323"></a>323</span> truth,
but has never discovered that there is such a thing as truth.”<a

<p>Nevertheless we are told, even by highly respectable writers, that
the modern world owes its scientific spirit to the extreme importance
which Christianity assigned to the possession of truth, of <em>the</em>
truth.<a name="FnAnchor2047" href="#Footnote2047"><span
class="sp">2047</span></a> According to Réville, “it was the orthodox
intolerance of the Church in the Middle Ages which impressed on
Christian society this disposition to seek truth at any price, of
which the modern scientific spirit is only the application. The more
importance the Church attached to the profession of the truth&mdash;to
the extent even of considering involuntary error as in the highest
degree a damnable crime&mdash;so much the more the sentiment of the
immense value of this truth arose in the general persuasion, along
with a resolve to conquer it wherever it was felt not to be possessed.
How otherwise can we explain that science was not developed and has
not been pursued with constancy, except in the midst of Christian
societies?”<a name="FnAnchor2048" href="#Footnote2048"><span
class="sp">2048</span></a> This statement is a curious instance of the
common tendency to attribute to the influence of the Christian
religion almost anything good which may be found among Christian
peoples. But surely, the patient and impartial search after hidden
truth, for the sake of truth, which constitutes the essence of
scientific research, is not congenial to, but the very opposite of,
that ready acceptance of a revealed truth for the sake of eternal
salvation, which was insisted on by the Churches. And what about that
singular love of abstract knowledge which flourished in ancient
Athens, where Aristotle declared it a sacred duty to prefer truth to
everything else,<a name="FnAnchor2049" href="#Footnote2049"><span
class="sp">2049</span></a> and Socrates sacrificed his life on its
altar? The modern scientific spirit is only a revival and development
of a mental disposition which for ages was suppressed by the
persecuting tendencies of the Church, as also&mdash;it must be
added&mdash;by the extreme contempt of learning displayed by the
barbarian invaders and their descendants. Even when they had settled
in the countries which they had conquered, the Teutons <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page324"></a>324</span> would not permit their
children to be instructed in any science, for fear lest they should
become effeminate and averse from war;<a name="FnAnchor2050"
href="#Footnote2050"><span class="sp">2050</span></a> and long
afterwards it was held that a nobleman ought not to know letters, and
that to write and read was a shame to gentry.<a name="FnAnchor2051"

<p>Religious toleration certainly does not mean passive indifference
with regard to dissenting religious ideas. The tolerant man may be a
great propagandist. He may do his utmost to suppress by arguments what
he considers to be a false belief. He may even favour stronger
measures against those who do mischief in the name of religion. But he
does not persecute anybody for the sake of his faith. Nor does he
believe in an intolerant and persecuting god.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XVI</h4>
<h3>CHRISTIANITY AND MARRIAGE</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="smcap">HE</span> founder of Christianity did not
prescribe any particular ceremony in connection with marriage, but it
has been assumed that the celebration of it among Christians was from
the very first accompanied with suitable acts of religious worship.
The testimony of the Fathers, from the middle of the third century
onwards, shows that marriages contracted without any formal
benediction did occur, but they were discountenanced by the Church.<a
name="FnAnchor2052" href="#Footnote2052"><span
class="sp">2052</span></a> Yet, though the dogma that marriage is a
sacrament gradually developed from the words in the Epistle to the

magnum est,” and was fully recognised in the twelfth century,<a
name="FnAnchor2054" href="#Footnote2054"><span
class="sp">2054</span></a> marriage without benediction was
nevertheless regarded as valid in the Church till the year 1563, when
the Council of Trent decreed that thenceforth no marriage should be
considered valid unless celebrated by a presence of two or three
witnesses.<a name="FnAnchor2055" href="#Footnote2055"><span

<p>Marriage was already instituted by God in Paradise for the
propagation of the human race; but according to Thomas Aquinas it was
only raised to the position of a sacrament by Christ, inasmuch as he
made it the picture of his union with the Church, thereby establishing
anew its indissoluble character, and also united with marriage a
saving gift.<a name="FnAnchor2056" href="#Footnote2056"><span
class="sp">2056</span></a> It may seem strange that marriage was made
a sacrament, in view of the extraordinary reverence in which virginity
was held; but as a matter of fact there was an intrinsic connection
between the sanctification of marriage and the worship of virginity.
By declaring marriage a sacrament the Church got some control over the
<i>copula carnalis</i> which even in marriage was not supposed to
differ materially from fornication, and brought that union of the
sexes under ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Moreover, it was in some
measure <span class="pagenum"><a id="page326"></a>326</span> purified
by the priest’s “sacramental” blessing.<a name="FnAnchor2057"
href="#Footnote2057"><span class="sp">2057</span></a> But the office
of the priest was not restricted to the performance of the nuptial
ceremony: according to Catholic rituals he had also to bless the
bridal bed, and this was considered one of the most important of
marriage rites. Thus in England, in the papal times, no marriage could
be consummated until the bed had been blessed. On the evening of the
wedding-day, when the married couple sat in state in the bridal bed,
before the exclusion of the guests, one or more priests, attended by
acolytes swinging to and fro lighted censers, appeared in the crowded
chamber to bless the couch, its occupants, and the truckle-bed, and
fumigate the room with hallowing incense;<a name="FnAnchor2058"
href="#Footnote2058"><span class="sp">2058</span></a> and the parties
were also sprinkled with holy water.<a name="FnAnchor2059"
href="#Footnote2059"><span class="sp">2059</span></a> The object of
the ceremony was partly to bestow upon the couple a long life and
progeny and other good things, but partly also to protect them against
evil influences; as appears from the formula given in the manual for
the use of Salisbury, where it is said: “Benedic, Domine, thalamum
istum et omnes habitantes in eo; ut in tua pace consistant, et in tua
voluntate permaneant; et in amore tuo vivant et senescant et
multiplicentur in longitudine dierum. . . . Qui custodis Israel,
custodi famulos tuos in hoc lecto quiescentes <em>ab omnibus
fantasmaticis demonum illusionibus</em>.”<a name="FnAnchor2060"
href="#Footnote2060"><span class="sp">2060</span></a> The idea that
sexual intercourse is defiling, even when practised by husband and
wife, shows itself in various prescriptions relating to it which have
been mentioned in an earlier chapter.<a name="FnAnchor2061"

In Norway the custom of the clergy blessing the bridal bed still
persisted in the beginning of the seventeenth century, although
formally abolished by the Reformation (T. F. Troels-Lund, <i>Dagligt

<p>The Reformers maintained that matrimonial affairs belong not to the
Church, but to the jurists; Luther called marriage a “worldly thing,”
and Calvin put it on the same level as housebuilding, farming, or
shoe-making.<a name="FnAnchor2062" href="#Footnote2062"><span
class="sp">2062</span></a> This opinion, however, was not accepted by
the legislators of the Protestant countries. Marriage certainly ceased
to be thought of as a sacrament, but continued to be regarded as a
divine institution; and sacerdotal nuptials became no less obligatory
on Protestants than on <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page327"></a>327</span> Catholics. It was the French Revolution
that first gave rise to an alteration in this respect. The
Constitution of September 3, 1791, declares in its seventh article,
title ii: “La loi ne considère le mariage que comme contrat civil. Le
pouvoir législatif établira pour tous les habitants, sans distinction,
le mode par lequel les naissances, mariages et décès seront constatés
et il désignera les officiers publics qui en recevront les actes.”<a
name="FnAnchor2063" href="#Footnote2063"><span
class="sp">2063</span></a> To this obligatory civil act a sacerdotal
benediction may be added, if the parties wish it. Since then civil
marriage has gradually become widespread in the Christian world, also
among Roman Catholics, although, by a papal decree of 1907, it has
been declared to be not only sinful and unlawful, which it was before,
but actually null and void.<a name="FnAnchor2064"
href="#Footnote2064"><span class="sp">2064</span></a> In some
countries, as in England, the parties may choose the religious or the
civil rite, just as they like, both making marriage equally valid by
law.<a name="FnAnchor2065" href="#Footnote2065"><span

<p>The decisive external sign of the sacrament of marriage is the
expressed “consensus” of the partners to the marriage.<a
name="FnAnchor2066" href="#Footnote2066"><span
class="sp">2066</span></a> Under the jurisprudence of Justinian a
father could not force his son or daughter in marriage.<a
name="FnAnchor2067" href="#Footnote2067"><span
class="sp">2067</span></a> But at the same time the right of a voice
in his children’s marriages was stoutly maintained: the consent of the
head of the family remained essential to the validity of the marriage
of any one under his power, irrespective of age.<a name="FnAnchor2068"
href="#Footnote2068"><span class="sp">2068</span></a> Canon Law also
adopted the principle that no marriage can be concluded without the
consent of the persons who marry; but, unlike Justinian law, as a
consequence of its doctrine that marriage is a sacrament, it ruled
that, however young the bridegroom and bride may be, the consent of
their parents or guardians is not necessary to make the marriage
valid.<a name="FnAnchor2069" href="#Footnote2069"><span
class="sp">2069</span></a> The Church disapproved of marriages
contracted without such consent: the lack of it was a “prohibitory
impediment” (<i>impedimentum impediens</i>) rendering the marriage
illicit, but not a “diriment impediment” (<i>impedimentum
dirimens</i>) rendering it null and void.<a name="FnAnchor2070"
href="#Footnote2070"><span class="sp">2070</span></a> The stipulations
of Canon Law influenced secular <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page328"></a>328</span> legislation. An edict of Clothaire I. in
560 prohibited the forcing of women to marry against their will.<a

girl could be compelled to marry a man whom she disliked.<a

the tenth century the girl’s consent is unconditionally required.<a

<p>As to the canonical prescription that a marriage is valid without
the consent of parents or guardians, it seems that the English
temporal law more or less acquiesced in it, although it regarded
“wardship and marriage” as a valuable piece of property.<a
name="FnAnchor2075" href="#Footnote2075"><span
class="sp">2075</span></a> In England, by the common law, the
marriages of minors who had attained the age of consent&mdash;fixed at
fourteen years for males and twelve years for females&mdash;were valid
without the consent of parents until the year 1753, when Lord
Hardwicke’s Marriage Act (26 Geo. 2, c. 33, 11) declared such
marriages void.<a name="FnAnchor2076" href="#Footnote2076"><span
class="sp">2076</span></a> According to the present law of England,
“where a person, not being a widower nor widow, is under the age of
twenty-one years, the father, if living, or, if he is dead, the
guardian or guardians, or one of them, or if there is no guardian
lawfully appointed, then the mother, if she has not remarried, has
authority to consent to his or her marriage; and such consent is
required except where there is no person having authority to give
it.”<a name="FnAnchor2077" href="#Footnote2077"><span
class="sp">2077</span></a> Yet the marriage of a minor without the
requisite consent is not invalid, whether it is by banns or licence or
superintendent registrar’s certificate; but there may be forfeiture of
all the rights and interest in any property accruing to the offending
party by force of the marriage.<a name="FnAnchor2078"
href="#Footnote2078"><span class="sp">2078</span></a> In Scotland, on
the other hand, no consent of parents or guardian <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page329"></a>329</span> is required even for
minors who have attained the age of puberty;<a name="FnAnchor2079"
href="#Footnote2079"><span class="sp">2079</span></a> and by the
common law of the United States, which was not affected by Lord
Hardwicke’s Marriage Act, the marriage of minors without the parental
consent is likewise good. There are “statutes which forbid the
celebration of the nuptials of minors without permission from the
parent or guardian; but, in the absence of a clause of nullity, which
most of them do not contain, a marriage in disobedience is valid,
while yet the participators in it may be subject to a penalty or
punishment.”<a name="FnAnchor2080" href="#Footnote2080"><span

<p>In the later Middle Ages German women were able to marry without
parental consent, though at the risk of being disinherited.<a
name="FnAnchor2081" href="#Footnote2081"><span
class="sp">2081</span></a> The ‘Schwabenspiegel,’ which is a faithful
echo of canonical ideas, says that when a young man has completed his
fourteenth year he can take a wife without the consent of his father,
that a maiden is marriageable at twelve years, and that her marriage
subsists even if contracted in spite of her father or other
relatives.<a name="FnAnchor2082" href="#Footnote2082"><span
class="sp">2082</span></a> But the feelings of the people seemed to
have been opposed to such a marriage and required the consent of
parents. Ulrich von Lichtenstein says in his ‘Frauenbuch’: “A girl who
has no parents should follow the advice of her kinsfolk; if she gives
herself to a man of her own accord, she may live with shame.”<a
name="FnAnchor2083" href="#Footnote2083"><span
class="sp">2083</span></a> Attempts were made to induce the Church to
change its law on the subject, but in vain; the matter was definitely
settled at the Council of Trent, after a lively discussion.<a
name="FnAnchor2084" href="#Footnote2084"><span
class="sp">2084</span></a> Luther and other Reformers were of a
different opinion: they maintained that a marriage contracted without
the consent of parents should be regarded as invalid, unless the
consent was given afterwards.<a name="FnAnchor2085"
href="#Footnote2085"><span class="sp">2085</span></a> This principle
was gradually accepted by most legislators in Protestant countries,
but with the modification that parental consent could be refused for
good <span class="pagenum"><a id="page330"></a>330</span> reasons only
and, in case of need, the consent of the authorities could take its
place.<a name="FnAnchor2086" href="#Footnote2086"><span

<p>In Catholic countries, also, the canonical doctrine met with
opposition; legislators declared parental consent to be necessary for
the validity of a marriage, and no appeal could be made in the case of
refusal.<a name="FnAnchor2087" href="#Footnote2087"><span
class="sp">2087</span></a> In France and other Latin countries the
Roman notions of parental rights and filial duties left behind traces
which lasted throughout the Middle Ages and long after. Bodin wrote,
in the latter part of the sixteenth century, that although the monarch
commands his subjects, the master his disciples, the captain his
soldiers, there is none to whom nature has given any command except
the father, “who is the true image of the great sovereign God,
universal father of all things.”<a name="FnAnchor2088"
href="#Footnote2088"><span class="sp">2088</span></a> Henry II. of
France decreed, in 1556, that a marriage contracted by a minor without
the consent of ascendants was null and void; and the later legislation
went further in the same direction. If a marriage was contracted
without such consent by a person who was below the age of twenty-five,
it was annulled; if contracted by a person between twenty-five and
thirty, it was valid, but disinheritance might be the consequence; and
if contracted by a person above the age of thirty, it had still to be
notified to the ascendant by “three respectful acts.”<a
name="FnAnchor2089" href="#Footnote2089"><span
class="sp">2089</span></a> Indeed, according to the French ‘Code
Civil,’ a son under twenty-five and a daughter under twenty-one could
not, until 1907, marry without parental consent.<a name="FnAnchor2090"
href="#Footnote2090"><span class="sp">2090</span></a> According to the
present law of France, a son and daughter under the age of twenty-one
cannot marry without the consent of the father and mother, or of the
father only if they disagree, or of the survivor if one be dead. If
both father and mother are dead, or in a condition which renders them
unable to consent, the grandparents take their place. Between the ages
of twenty-one and thirty the parties must still obtain parental
consent, but if this be refused it can be regulated by means of an act
before a notary, and if the consent is not given within thirty days
the marriage can take place without it.<a name="FnAnchor2091"
href="#Footnote2091"><span class="sp">2091</span></a> In Italy the
consent of parents, or of the father, or of the survivor if one of the
parents is dead, is required for a son who has not completed his
twenty-fifth year and for a daughter who has not completed <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page331"></a>331</span> her twenty-first; but
in case of refusal of consent provision is made for an appeal to
court.<a name="FnAnchor2092" href="#Footnote2092"><span

<p>The Justinian principle that a father cannot force his child in
marriage has been universally adopted in Christian countries, but, as
we have just seen, not the canonical rule that the consent of the
persons who contract a marriage is always sufficient to make it valid.
The value of this concession was much reduced by the fact that the
Church adopted the stipulation of the Roman law concerning the lowest
age at which a person was allowed to marry&mdash;fourteen years for a
man and twelve for a woman. This regulation is still in force in Great
Britain, in some of the United States, and in several Roman Catholic
countries; but the general tendency of the later legislation has been
to raise the age-limit, which may even be as high as twenty-one for
men and eighteen for women. In many countries, however, where the
canonic age-limit has not been preserved, the obstacle to marrying at
an earlier age than that which the law admits may be removed by
dispensation.<a name="FnAnchor2093" href="#Footnote2093"><span

<p>Under the influence of the ascetic ideas prevalent in the Church
the degrees of relationship within which no marriage was allowed were
greatly extended. In the Eastern Church marriage was prohibited within
the seventh degree according to the Roman method of computing degrees
of relationship, which was to count from one of the parties up to a
common ancestor and then down to the other party, so that, for
example, first cousins were held to be related in the fourth degree
and uncle and niece in the third. This rule is still in force in the
Eastern Church.<a name="FnAnchor2094" href="#Footnote2094"><span
class="sp">2094</span></a> The Western Church went still farther in
her prohibitions. The forbidden degrees became gradually as many as
seven according to the new Western reckoning, or “canonical
computation,” by which seven degrees were practically equivalent to
seven generations; brother and sister were related in the first
degree, first cousins in the second degree, second cousins in the
third degree, and similarly beyond.<a name="FnAnchor2095"
href="#Footnote2095"><span class="sp">2095</span></a> The seventh
degree seems to have been chosen by rigorous theorists who would have
forbidden a marriage between kinsfolk however remote; for it seems to
have been a common rule among the Teutonic peoples that for the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page332"></a>332</span> purposes of inheritance
kinship could not be traced beyond the seventh generation, and so to
prohibit marriage within seven degrees was to prohibit it among all
persons who for any legal purpose could claim blood-relationship with
each other.<a name="FnAnchor2096" href="#Footnote2096"><span
class="sp">2096</span></a> The fourth Lateran Council, held <span
class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1215 under Innocent III., reduced the
prohibited degrees from seven to four, that is, marriage was permitted
beyond the degree of third cousins;<a name="FnAnchor2097"
href="#Footnote2097"><span class="sp">2097</span></a> and since then
there has been no change.<a name="FnAnchor2098"
href="#Footnote2098"><span class="sp">2098</span></a> The forbidden
degrees of the Western Church thus almost coincide with those of the
Eastern Church, the fourth degree of canonical computation
corresponding to the seventh and eighth degrees of the Roman
reckoning.<a name="FnAnchor2099" href="#Footnote2099"><span
class="sp">2099</span></a> But there is this important difference
between the legislation of the two Churches, that in the Eastern
Church no dispensation is held possible from any of the prohibited
degrees,<a name="FnAnchor2100" href="#Footnote2100"><span
class="sp">2100</span></a> whereas in the West dispensation is not
only allowed but has since early times been practised on a very large
scale. It does not seem, however, that the field of the Levitical
prohibitions was entered upon by the papal dispensing claims till the
fifteenth century.<a name="FnAnchor2101" href="#Footnote2101"><span

<p>The Church not only encumbered marriage with all those prohibitions
on the ground of kinship, but introduced a new obstacle to it by
establishing the so-called <i>cognatio spiritualis</i>, or “spiritual
relationship.” The Emperor Justinian passed a law forbidding a man to
marry a woman for whom he had stood godfather in baptism, the tie of
the godfather and godchild being so analogous to that of father and
child as to make such a marriage appear improper.<a
name="FnAnchor2110" href="#Footnote2110"><span
class="sp">2110</span></a> To this law the Church added various other
prohibitions on account of spiritual relationship, for instance,
against marriage between the minister of the sacrament and the person
baptised and that person’s parents as well, between a godfather and a
sister of the godchild, between two sponsors, and between a sponsor
and the child of another sponsor born after the act of baptism.
Similar impediments arose from relationships created by
confirmation.<a name="FnAnchor2111" href="#Footnote2111"><span

<p>In addition to these prohibitions difference of religion was made a
bar to intermarriage. As according to the law of the Talmud and the
Rabbinical code a Jew could not marry a Christian,<a
name="FnAnchor2112" href="#Footnote2112"><span
class="sp">2112</span></a> so also were marriages between Jews and
Christians forbidden by the latter&mdash;by Constantine and later
emperors and by various Councils; and during the Middle Ages they were
universally avoided.<a name="FnAnchor2113" href="#Footnote2113"><span
class="sp">2113</span></a> Indeed, owing to the intense Jewish hatred
for the sacred name of Christ, the early Church was more opposed to
wedlock with Jews than with pagans. Although Paul indicates that a
Christian must not marry a heathen,<a name="FnAnchor2114"
href="#Footnote2114"><span class="sp">2114</span></a> and <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page334"></a>334</span> Tertullian calls such
an alliance fornication,<a name="FnAnchor2115"
href="#Footnote2115"><span class="sp">2115</span></a> the Church, in
early times, often even encouraged marriages of this sort as a means
of propagating Christianity; and it was only when its success was
certain that it actually prohibited them.<a name="FnAnchor2116"
href="#Footnote2116"><span class="sp">2116</span></a> When the
‘Decretum’ of Gratian was published, in the twelfth century, the
impediment <i>disparitas cultus</i> became part of the Canon Law of
the Church,<a name="FnAnchor2117" href="#Footnote2117"><span
class="sp">2117</span></a> and from that time forward all marriages
contracted between Catholics and infidels were held to be invalid
unless a dispensation had been obtained from the ecclesiastical
authority. Marriages between Catholics and heretics, on the other
hand, were considered valid, though illicit if a dispensation <i>mixtæ
religionis</i> had not been obtained; but there had been much
opposition to such unions from early times, and various Councils had
legislated against them. The Council of Trent declared all matrimonial
unions between Catholics and non-Catholics null and void, unless
entered into before the ecclesiastical authority; but by degrees the
Popes felt constrained to make various concessions for mixed
marriages. “The Church,” says Taunton, “has always abhorred these
marriages both on account of the danger of perversion and the
difficulty of educating the offspring, as well as on account of the
<i>communicatio in sacris</i>.”<a name="FnAnchor2118"
href="#Footnote2118"><span class="sp">2118</span></a> The Protestants
also originally forbade them.<a name="FnAnchor2119"
href="#Footnote2119"><span class="sp">2119</span></a> But mixed
marriages are not now contrary to the civil law either in Roman
Catholic or Protestant countries. The case is, or has been, different
in countries belonging to the Greek Church, where the ecclesiastical
restrictions were adopted by the State. The Eastern Church declared
marriages between Catholics and heretics null and void, and has also
shown herself opposed to marriages with members of the Roman Church;
and in Russia various laws were passed ordering that such marriages be
not permitted unless the children of the union were to be brought up
in the Orthodox faith.<a name="FnAnchor2120"

<p>It has been asserted that Jesus “definitely condemned polygamy,”<a
name="FnAnchor2121" href="#Footnote2121"><span
class="sp">2121</span></a> and was unusually explicit “in his
insistence that marriage should be monogamous.”<a name="FnAnchor2122"
href="#Footnote2122"><span class="sp">2122</span></a> Such conclusions
have been drawn from the saying that a man who puts away his wife and
marries another commits adultery. But in 1 Timothy it is <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page335"></a>335</span> said that a bishop and
a deacon must be “the husband of one wife”<a name="FnAnchor2123"
href="#Footnote2123"><span class="sp">2123</span></a> which seems to
suggest that polygamy was not actually held unlawful for other
Christians and occasionally occurred among them, though no doubt
monogamy was assumed as the normal and ideal form of marriage. That
injunction, however, has been interpreted as a prohibition of
contracting a second marriage by persons who had been married before;
and, as we have seen, such marriages were actually held objectionable
even if contracted by the laity.<a name="FnAnchor2124"
href="#Footnote2124"><span class="sp">2124</span></a> Augustine points
out that among the ancient fathers it was lawful for the husband of a
barren wife to take another woman that from her might be born sons
common to both, and adds that he would not hastily pronounce whether
it still was lawful for him to do so, with the good will of the
wife.<a name="FnAnchor2125" href="#Footnote2125"><span
class="sp">2125</span></a> It has been argued that it was not
necessary for the first Christian teachers to condemn polygamy because
monogamy was the universal rule among the peoples in whose midst they
were preaching; but this is certainly not true of the Jews, who still
both permitted and practised polygamy in the beginning of the
Christian era. Some of the Fathers accused the Jewish rabbis of
sensuality;<a name="FnAnchor2126" href="#Footnote2126"><span
class="sp">2126</span></a> but no Council of the Church in the
earliest centuries opposed polygamy, and no obstacle was put in the
way of its practice by kings in countries where it had occurred in the
times of paganism. In the middle of the sixth century Diarmait, king
of Ireland, had two queens and two concubines.<a name="FnAnchor2127"
href="#Footnote2127"><span class="sp">2127</span></a> Polygamy was
frequently practised by the Merovingian kings. Charlemagne had two
wives and many concubines; and one of his laws seems to imply that
polygamy was not unknown even among priests.<a name="FnAnchor2128"
href="#Footnote2128"><span class="sp">2128</span></a> This, of course,
does not mean that such a practice was recognised by the Church; nor
must the permissions granted to kings be taken as evidence of her
rules, for, as the Council of Constantinople decided in 809, “Divine
law can do nothing against Kings.”<a name="FnAnchor2129"
href="#Footnote2129"><span class="sp">2129</span></a> Yet in the
earlier part of the Middle Ages the strenuous general rule of monogamy
was relaxed in certain exceptional circumstances, as <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page336"></a>336</span> in cases of sexual
impotency and of enforced or voluntary desertion.<a

<p>In later times Philip of Hesse and Frederick William II. of Prussia
contracted bigamous marriages with the sanction of the Lutheran
clergy.<a name="FnAnchor2131" href="#Footnote2131"><span
class="sp">2131</span></a> Luther himself approved of the bigamy of
the former, and so did Melanchthon.<a name="FnAnchor2132"
href="#Footnote2132"><span class="sp">2132</span></a> On various
occasions Luther speaks of polygamy with considerable toleration. It
had not been forbidden by God; even Abraham, who was a “perfect
Christian,” had two wives. God had allowed such marriages to certain
men of the Old Testament in particular circumstances, and if a
Christian wanted to follow their example he had to show that the
circumstances were similar in his case;<a name="FnAnchor2133"
href="#Footnote2133"><span class="sp">2133</span></a> but polygamy was
undoubtedly preferable to divorce.<a name="FnAnchor2134"
href="#Footnote2134"><span class="sp">2134</span></a> In 1650, soon
after the Peace of Westphalia, when the population had been greatly
reduced by the Thirty Years War, the Frankish <i>Kreistag</i> at
Nuremberg passed the resolution that thenceforth every man should be
allowed to marry two women.<a name="FnAnchor2135"
href="#Footnote2135"><span class="sp">2135</span></a> Certain
Christian sects have even advocated polygamy with much fervour. In
1531 the Anabaptists openly preached at Munster that he who wants to
be a true Christian must have several wives.<a name="FnAnchor2136"
href="#Footnote2136"><span class="sp">2136</span></a> Among the
Mormons the duty of polygamy, when economic resources permitted, was
urged upon men, both as a means of securing eternal salvation and as a
step in harmony with their earthly interest. Group-marriage or, as it
was called, “complex marriage” was practised by the Oneida Community
in Madison county, New York, which was established in 1848 by John
Humphrey Noyes and consisted mostly of New England Puritans. All the
men within the community were the actual or potential husbands of all
the women; and this community of wives was based on Noyes’
interpretation of certain passages of the New Testament, though he
also appealed to the law of nature in support of it.<a

<p>In no case was it Christianity that first introduced obligatory
monogamy into Europe. There can be little doubt that monogamy was the
only recognised form of marriage in Greece. Concubinage existed at
Athens at all times, and was hardly censured by public opinion, but it
was well distinguished from <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page337"></a>337</span> marriage: it conferred no rights on the
concubine, and the children were bastards.<a name="FnAnchor2138"
href="#Footnote2138"><span class="sp">2138</span></a> Roman marriage
was strictly monogamous. A second marriage concluded by a married
person was invalid, although it was not subject to punishment during
the Republic and the early Empire; Diocletian was the first who
punished bigamy.<a name="FnAnchor2139" href="#Footnote2139"><span
class="sp">2139</span></a> Liaisons between married men and mistresses
were not uncommon by the close of the Republic;<a name="FnAnchor2140"
href="#Footnote2140"><span class="sp">2140</span></a> but such a
relation was not considered lawful in after times. According to the
jurist Paulus, a man who had an <i>uxor</i> could not have a
<i>concubina</i> at the same time.<a name="FnAnchor2141"

<p>In ancient times the power which the Roman father possessed over
his daughter was generally, if not always,<a name="FnAnchor2142"
href="#Footnote2142"><span class="sp">2142</span></a> by marriage
transferred to the husband.<a name="FnAnchor2143"
href="#Footnote2143"><span class="sp">2143</span></a> When marrying a
woman passed in <i>manum viri</i>, as a wife she was <i>filiæ
loco</i>, that is, in law she was her husband’s daughter.<a
name="FnAnchor2144" href="#Footnote2144"><span
class="sp">2144</span></a> And as the Roman house-father originally
had the <i>jus vitæ necisque</i> over his children, the husband
naturally had the same power over his wife. But from her being
destitute of all legal rights we must not conclude that she was
treated with indignity. On the contrary, she generally had a respected
and influential position in the family;<a name="FnAnchor2145"
href="#Footnote2145"><span class="sp">2145</span></a> and though the
husband could repudiate her at will, it was said that for five hundred
and twenty years <i>a condita urbe</i> there was no such thing as a
divorce in Rome.<a name="FnAnchor2146" href="#Footnote2146"><span
class="sp">2146</span></a> As Lord Bryce points out, we cannot doubt
that the wide power which the law gave to the husband “was in point of
fact restrained within narrow limits, not only by affection, but also
by the vigilant public opinion of a comparatively small community.”<a
name="FnAnchor2147" href="#Footnote2147"><span
class="sp">2147</span></a> Gradually, however, marriage with
<i>manus</i> fell into disuse, and was, under the Empire, generally
superseded by marriage without <i>manus</i>, a form of wedlock which
conferred on the husband scarcely any authority at all over his wife.
Instead of passing into his power, she remained in the power of her
father; and since the tendency of the later law was to reduce the old
<i>patria potestas</i> to a nullity, she became <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page338"></a>338</span> practically
independent.<a name="FnAnchor2148" href="#Footnote2148"><span
class="sp">2148</span></a> She could bring an action against others
and, with some limitations, against her husband also. She could hold
property and dispose of it freely&mdash;a very considerable portion of
Roman wealth thus passed into the uncontrolled possession of women;
and the tyranny exercised by rich wives over their husbands&mdash;to
whom it is said they sometimes lent money at high interest&mdash;was a
continual theme of satirists.<a name="FnAnchor2149"

<p>This remarkable liberty granted to married women was not agreeable
to the opinion which the new religion held about the female sex. The
Hebrews represented woman as the source of evil and death on
earth&mdash;“Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her
we all die”;<a name="FnAnchor2150" href="#Footnote2150"><span
class="sp">2150</span></a> and this notion passed into
Christianity&mdash;“Adam was not deceived, but the woman being
deceived was in the transgression.”<a name="FnAnchor2151"
href="#Footnote2151"><span class="sp">2151</span></a> Tertullian
maintains that a woman should go about in humble garb, mourning and
repentant, in order to expiate that which she derives from Eve, the
ignominy of the first sin, and the odium attaching to her as the cause
of human perdition. “Do you not know,” he exclaims, “that you are each
an Eve? The sentence of God on this sex of yours lives in this age;
the guilt must of necessity live too. You are the devil’s gateway; you
are the unsealer of that [forbidden] tree; you are the first deserter
of the divine law; you are she who persuaded him whom the devil was
not valiant enough to attack. You destroyed so easily God’s image,
man. On account of your desert&mdash;that is, death&mdash;even the Son
of God had to die.”<a name="FnAnchor2152" href="#Footnote2152"><span
class="sp">2152</span></a> In the ‘Testament’ of Reuben, one of the
“twelve Patriarchs,” it is said: “Evil are women. . . . Women are
overcome by the spirit of fornication more than men, and in their heat
they plot against men; and by means of their adornment they deceive
first their minds, and by the glance of the eye instil the poison, and
then through the accomplished act they take them captive. . . . If you
wish to be pure in mind, guard your senses from every woman.”<a
name="FnAnchor2153" href="#Footnote2153"><span
class="sp">2153</span></a> According to Gregory Thaumaturgus, “a
person may find one man chaste among a thousand, but a woman never.”<a
name="FnAnchor2154" href="#Footnote2154"><span
class="sp">2154</span></a> At the Council of Mâcon, in 585, a bishop
expressed the opinion that woman had no soul; <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page339"></a>339</span> but he was corrected by his colleagues.<a
name="FnAnchor2155" href="#Footnote2155"><span
class="sp">2155</span></a> Some Fathers of the Church, however, were
careful to emphasise that womanhood only belongs to this earthly
existence, and that on the day of resurrection all women will appear
in the shape of sexless beings.<a name="FnAnchor2156"

<p>On account of their uncleanness women were excluded from sacred
functions, in striking contrast with both heathen and heretical
practice. In the early Church, it is true, there were “deaconesses”
and clerical “widows,” but their offices were merely to perform some
inferior services of the church,<a name="FnAnchor2157"
href="#Footnote2157"><span class="sp">2157</span></a> and even these
very modest posts were open only to virgins or widows of a
considerable age.<a name="FnAnchor2158" href="#Footnote2158"><span
class="sp">2158</span></a> Whilst a layman could in case of necessity
administer baptism, a woman could never, as it seems, perform such an
act.<a name="FnAnchor2159" href="#Footnote2159"><span
class="sp">2159</span></a> Nor was a woman allowed to preach publicly
in the church, either by the Apostle’s rules or those of succeeding
ages,<a name="FnAnchor2160" href="#Footnote2160"><span
class="sp">2160</span></a> and it was a serious complaint against
certain heretics that they allowed such a practice. “The heretic
women,” Tertullian exclaims, “how wanton are they! they who dare to
teach, to dispute, to practise exorcisms, to promise cures, perchance,
also, to baptise”!<a name="FnAnchor2161" href="#Footnote2161"><span
class="sp">2161</span></a> A Council held at Auxerre at the end of the
sixth century forbade women to receive the Eucharist into their naked
hands;<a name="FnAnchor2162" href="#Footnote2162"><span
class="sp">2162</span></a> and in various canons women were enjoined
not to come near to the altar while mass was celebrating.<a
name="FnAnchor2163" href="#Footnote2163"><span
class="sp">2163</span></a> To such an extent was this opposition
against women carried that the Church of the Middle Ages did not
hesitate to provide herself with eunuchs in order to supply cathedral
choirs with the soprano tones inhering by nature in women alone.</p>

<p>The low opinion held about women affected also their social <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page340"></a>340</span> status. Paul’s saying
that among those who have been baptised into Christ and put on Christ
there is neither male nor female, all being the children of God by
faith,<a name="FnAnchor2164" href="#Footnote2164"><span
class="sp">2164</span></a> did not imply that they were equal in this
world. As the head of every man is Christ and the head of Christ is
God, so is the man the head of the woman; and as the man is the image
and glory of God, so is the woman the glory of the man. “For the man
is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. Neither was the man
created for the woman; but the woman for the man. For this cause ought
the woman to have power on her head.”<a name="FnAnchor2165"
href="#Footnote2165"><span class="sp">2165</span></a> While husbands
should love their wives and not be bitter against them, wives should
submit themselves to their husbands, “as it is fit in the Lord.”<a
name="FnAnchor2166" href="#Footnote2166"><span
class="sp">2166</span></a> In support of the former rule the Epistle
to the Ephesians appeals to the husband’s love of himself: men ought
to love their wives “as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife
loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but
nourisheth and cherisheth it.”<a name="FnAnchor2167"

Donaldson observes that, although the woman has been continually said
to owe her present high position to Christianity, as well as to the
influence of the Teutonic mind, an examination of the facts has led
him to the opinion that there was no sign of this revolution in the
first three centuries of the Christian era, and that the position of
women among Christians was lower, and the notions in regard to them
were more degraded, than they were in the first.<a name="FnAnchor2169"

<p>The latest Roman law, so far as it is touched by the Constitutions
of the Christian emperors, already bears some marks of a reaction
against the liberal doctrines of the great Antonine jurisconsults, who
assumed the equality of the sexes as a principle of their code of
equity.<a name="FnAnchor2170" href="#Footnote2170"><span
class="sp">2170</span></a> This tendency was supported by Teutonic
custom and law. Among the Teutons a husband’s authority over his wife
was the same as a father’s over his unmarried daughter,<a
name="FnAnchor2171" href="#Footnote2171"><span
class="sp">2171</span></a> and gave him in certain circumstances a
right to kill or sell his wife.<a name="FnAnchor2172"
href="#Footnote2172"><span class="sp">2172</span></a> It certainly
contained more than <span class="pagenum"><a

all the same largely responsible for those heavy disabilities with
regard to personal liberty, as well as with regard to property, from
which married women have suffered up to quite recent times. The
systems, says Sir Henry Maine, “which are least indulgent to married
women are invariably those which have followed the Canon Law
exclusively, or those which, from the lateness of their contact with
European civilisation, have never had their archaisms weeded out.”<a

<p>Nor did the Reformers improve the position of married women. In
agreement with the dictum of Paul, an extensive masculine domination
of a patriarchal kind belongs to the very essence of Lutheranism,
which looks upon the physical superiority of man as the expression of
a superior relationship willed by God. The house-father represents the
law; he is the bread-winner, the pastor, and the priest of his
household. By submission to her husband the wife atones for Eve’s
transgression, although she ought to be considered on a level with him
so far as religion is concerned.<a name="FnAnchor2174"
href="#Footnote2174"><span class="sp">2174</span></a> In England,
where from the Norman Conquest onwards the unmarried woman, on
attaining her majority, became fully equipped with legal and civil
rights,<a name="FnAnchor2175" href="#Footnote2175"><span
class="sp">2175</span></a> the wife remained in every respect subject
to her husband. Blackstone wrote: “The very being or legal existence
of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is
incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband: under whose
wing, protection and cover, she performs every thing. . . . For this
reason, a man cannot grant any thing to his wife, or enter into
covenant with her: for the grant would be to suppose her separate
existence, and to covenant with her would be only to covenant with
himself.” He is bound to provide her with necessaries, but for
anything besides necessaries he is not chargeable. If she be injured
in her person or property, she can bring no action for redress without
his concurrence, neither can she be sued without making him a
defendant. In criminal persecutions she may be indicted and punished
separately, but she is considered as acting under his orders, and in
some felonies (though not treason or murder) she is excused, if acting
under his constraint. “The husband also (by the old law) might give
his wife moderate correction. For, as he is to answer for her
misbehaviour, the law thought it reasonable to intrust him with the
power of restraining her, by domestic chastisement, in the same <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page342"></a>342</span> moderation that a man
is allowed to correct his servants or children. . . . But, with us, in
the politer reign of Charles II., this power of correction began to be
doubted: and a wife may now have security of the peace against her
husband; or, in return, a husband against his wife. Yet the lower rank
of people, who were always fond of the old common law, still claim and
exert their ancient privilege: and the courts of law will still permit
a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty in case of any gross
misbehaviour.”<a name="FnAnchor2176" href="#Footnote2176"><span
class="sp">2176</span></a> Blackstone wrote two centuries after the
Reformation; but, as I said, the reformers did not improve the status
of the wife. The influence of the Old Testament rather tended to
harden their views of the prerogatives of the husband. This is
particularly noticeable in Puritanism. Baxter published in 1650 a
book, called <i>The Husband’s Authority Unvail’d</i>, in which “it is
moderately discussed whether it be fit or lawfull for a <i>good
man</i> to beat his <i>bad Wife</i>.” He maintains that if wives
“cannot or will not cary, in some degree, conformable to the Prescript
and Patern of that <i>Weaker Vessell</i> set down as moulded and
framed by the holy Ghost; they must permit their Husband, in some
proportion, to exercise that knowledge and coactive power which God
hath imparted to him”; and “they must not disdain a little scratch on
their Body, or to be deplum’d of a little Pride by their discreet and
conscientious <i>Husband</i> for their good.”<a name="FnAnchor2177"

<p>After English women had acquired personal protection from the
wife-beating husband, their property, except when protected by
settlement, still remained at the absolute disposal of their lord and
master. That protection was a privilege of the daughters of the
propertied classes; but there was literally no protection for the wife
of a drunkard struggling to support her children by the labour of her
hands from the husband who should choose to sponge upon what she
earned. It was only by the Married Women’s Property Act of 1870 that
such earnings were emancipated from the husband’s control. In 1882 the
same principles were applied to all property; and the English law,
which was the most backward in Europe, became the most forward.<a

<h4>CHAPTER XVII</h4>
<h3>CHRISTIANITY AND DIVORCE</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">C</span><span class="smcap">HRISTIANITY</span> revolutionised European
legislation with regard to divorce. In pagan times Roman law was as
liberal as possible so far as the husband’s right to divorce his wife
was concerned, and in the case of a “free” marriage, which implied
that the wife did not fall under the <i>manus</i> or power, of her
husband, equally liberal with regard to the wife’s right to dissolve
the marriage. The dissolution of such a marriage could be brought
about either by mutual agreement between both parties or by the will
of one party only, and in this respect the legal position of the wife
was the same as that of the husband.<a name="FnAnchor2180"
href="#Footnote2180"><span class="sp">2180</span></a> The rules of
divorce which were recognised in the case of a free marriage were
afterwards extended to marriages with <i>manus</i>; and in the end
marriage with <i>manus</i> fell into disuse altogether.<a

<p>In the New Testament there are various passages bearing upon the
question of divorce.<a name="FnAnchor2182" href="#Footnote2182"><span
class="sp">2182</span></a> A man who puts away his wife and marries
another commits adultery against her, and a woman who puts away her
husband and is married to another is guilty of the same crime: “What
God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.” There are, however,
two exceptions to this rule. Like Shammai and his school, Jesus
taught, according to St. Matthew, that a man might put away his wife
for fornication, which, however, has been considered to be an
emendation made by the editor of the first gospel, but for no other
reason;<a name="FnAnchor2183" href="#Footnote2183"><span
class="sp">2183</span></a> and Paul lays down the rule that if a
Christian is married to an unbeliever and the latter departs, the
Christian “is not under bondage.”<a name="FnAnchor2184"
href="#Footnote2184"><span class="sp">2184</span></a> But, largely
under the influence of Augustine, the Western Church gradually made up
her mind to deny the dissolubility of a valid Christian marriage, at
least if it had been <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page345"></a>345</span> consummated.<a name="FnAnchor2185"
href="#Footnote2185"><span class="sp">2185</span></a> Her doctrine on
the subject was in the twelfth century definitely fixed by Gratian and
Peter Lombard;<a name="FnAnchor2186" href="#Footnote2186"><span
class="sp">2186</span></a> it was dogmatically asserted by the Council
of Trent,<a name="FnAnchor2187" href="#Footnote2187"><span
class="sp">2187</span></a> and was in the nineteenth century
reaffirmed by Pius IX. and Leo XIII.<a name="FnAnchor2188"
href="#Footnote2188"><span class="sp">2188</span></a> A consummated
Christian marriage is a sacrament and must as such remain valid for
ever. It represents the union between Christ and the Church, and is
consequently as indissoluble as that union.<a name="FnAnchor2189"
href="#Footnote2189"><span class="sp">2189</span></a> It is also
permanent according to the law of nature, because only as permanent
can marriage fulfil its object. And God made it so at the very
beginning of our race, when He decreed<a name="FnAnchor2190"
href="#Footnote2190"><span class="sp">2190</span></a> that a man shall
leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife, and
they shall be one flesh.<a name="FnAnchor2191"

<p>On the other hand, a Christian marriage which has not been
consummated is not indissoluble; it is only by consummation that such
a marriage becomes a sacrament and a symbol of the union between
Christ and the Church.<a name="FnAnchor2192"
href="#Footnote2192"><span class="sp">2192</span></a> The Council of
Trent decreed that “matrimony contracted but not consummated” might be
dissolved by “the solemn profession of religion by one of the married
parties”;<a name="FnAnchor2193" href="#Footnote2193"><span
class="sp">2193</span></a> and it may also be dissolved for other
reasons by an act of Papal authority.<a name="FnAnchor2194"
href="#Footnote2194"><span class="sp">2194</span></a> Non-Christian
marriage is not a sacrament, even though consummated;<a
name="FnAnchor2195" href="#Footnote2195"><span
class="sp">2195</span></a> hence it is in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page346"></a>346</span> certain circumstances dissoluble, in
accordance with Paul’s dictum that a Christian married to an infidel
is not under bondage if the latter depart. Innocent III. declared
authoritatively that if, in the case of a marriage between two
infidels, one of them became a Christian, the convert was justified in
entering into another marriage, provided that either the non-Christian
was unwilling to live with the other or such cohabitation would cause
the blasphemy of the Divine name or be an incentive to mortal sin.<a
name="FnAnchor2196" href="#Footnote2196"><span
class="sp">2196</span></a> It was argued that this so-called
<i>privilegium Paulinum</i> is no exception to the rule that Christian
marriage is indissoluble, because in the case in question the marriage
is dissolved not by the Christian but by the infidel, and the Church
has nothing to do with the marriages of infidels.<a

<p>While asserting the indissolubility of a Christian marriage the
Church admitted a <i>divortium imperfectum</i> or <i>separatio quoad
thorum et mensam</i>, a “separation from bed and board,” which
discharged the parties from the duty of living together but at the
same time left them husband and wife and consequently unable to marry
any other person. According to the Council of Trent, such separation
may take place “for many causes,” either for a determinate or for an
indeterminate period.<a name="FnAnchor2198" href="#Footnote2198"><span
class="sp">2198</span></a> The chief cause is adultery or other carnal
sin, equivalent to it; but Augustine had already spoken of a
<i>fornicatio spirituale</i> as a ground for separation,<a
name="FnAnchor2199" href="#Footnote2199"><span
class="sp">2199</span></a> and this view was accepted by Gratian, who
regarded as such apostasy,<a name="FnAnchor2200"
href="#Footnote2200"><span class="sp">2200</span></a> heresy,<a
name="FnAnchor2201" href="#Footnote2201"><span
class="sp">2201</span></a> and incitement to evil deeds.<a
name="FnAnchor2202" href="#Footnote2202"><span
class="sp">2202</span></a> Subsequently a distinction was made between
permanent and temporary separation.<a name="FnAnchor2203"
href="#Footnote2203"><span class="sp">2203</span></a> According to
some writers, perpetual separation may be granted only for
<i>fornicatio carnalis</i>, unless it has been condoned or unless both
parties have been guilty of it.<a name="FnAnchor2204"
href="#Footnote2204"><span class="sp">2204</span></a> According to
others, it may also be granted for defection of the faith whether by
the rejection of Christianity or by heresy, and on account of entrance
into religious life on the part of the wife or of the husband or by
the reception of Holy Orders on the part of the husband. The cases
justifying temporary separation may be summed up under the general
notion of “danger to body or soul.”<a name="FnAnchor2205"

<p>Yet in spite of the theory of the indissolubility of Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page347"></a>347</span> marriage, the
Roman Catholic doctrine gives ecclesiastics a large practical power of
dissolving marriages which may have appeared perfectly valid. The
Church recognised a legal process which was popularly, though
incorrectly, called a divorce <span class="correction" title="not in
italics in text"><i>a</i></span> <i>vinculo matrimonii</i> “from the
bond of matrimony,” in case the union had been unlawful from the
beginning on the ground of some canonical impediment, such as
relationship or earlier engagement of marriage. This only implied that
a marriage which never had been valid would remain invalid; but
practically it led to the possibility of dissolving marriages which in
theory were indissoluble. For, as Lord Bryce observes, “the rules
regarding impediments were so numerous and so intricate that it was
easy, given a sufficient motive, whether political or pecuniary, to
discover some ground for declaring almost any marriage invalid.”<a

<p>The doctrine of the Western Church influenced profoundly the
secular legislation of the countries in which she was established. For
a long time, however, it was not accepted in full by the legislators.
The Christian emperors laid down certain grounds on which a husband
could divorce his wife and a wife her husband without blame. According
to Constantine, a man was allowed to dissolve the marriage if the wife
was an adulteress, a preparer of poisons, or a procuress; and the wife
could do so if her husband was guilty of murder, prepared poisons, or
violated tombs.<a name="FnAnchor2207" href="#Footnote2207"><span
class="sp">2207</span></a> After some further legislation on the
subject by later emperors,<a name="FnAnchor2208"
href="#Footnote2208"><span class="sp">2208</span></a> Justinian
repealed the earlier constitutions and resettled the grounds of
divorce. A marriage could be dissolved for a variety of specified
reasons. Thus, a man might repudiate his wife if she committed
adultery, and a wife might repudiate her husband if he took a woman to
live in the same house with her, or if he persisted in frequenting any
other house in the same town with any woman after being warned more
than once by his wife or her parents or other persons of
respectability.<a name="FnAnchor2209" href="#Footnote2209"><span
class="sp">2209</span></a> At the same time the old right of either
party to dissolve the marriage at will by simple notice to the other
party was not formally abolished even by the legislation of the
Christian Empire; but it was provided that when a marriage was
dissolved without any statutory ground of divorce, the offending <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page348"></a>348</span> party should suffer
certain penalties. When a wife repudiated the marriage without
sufficient cause she forfeited her dowry, and when the husband was the
offender he was deprived of his <i>donatio propter nuptias</i>, in
other words, he was required actually to pay over the <i>donatio</i>
he had covenanted to pay.<a name="FnAnchor2210"
href="#Footnote2210"><span class="sp">2210</span></a> Justinian also
prohibited divorce by mutual consent&mdash;which until then seems to
have taken place without any legal check whatever&mdash;except when
the husband was impotent, when either he or the wife desired to enter
a monastery, and when either of them was in captivity for a certain
length of time.<a name="FnAnchor2211" href="#Footnote2211"><span
class="sp">2211</span></a> Subsequently Justinian even enacted that
persons dissolving a marriage by mutual consent should forfeit all
their property and be confined for life in a monastery.<a
name="FnAnchor2212" href="#Footnote2212"><span
class="sp">2212</span></a> But his nephew and successor, Justin the
Second, repealed his uncle’s prohibitions relating to this kind of
divorce.<a name="FnAnchor2213" href="#Footnote2213"><span

<p>The facility of divorce by mutual consent also remained in the
Roman codes of the German kings, and, as under the older Roman
legislation, a man might besides divorce his wife for certain
offences.<a name="FnAnchor2214" href="#Footnote2214"><span

an equal facility.<a name="FnAnchor2215" href="#Footnote2215"><span

href="#Footnote2217"><span class="sp">2217</span></a> According to
Theodore’s Penitential the husband may divorce an adulterous wife and
marry another, and she, too, may marry again, though only after five
years of penance;<a name="FnAnchor2218" href="#Footnote2218"><span
class="sp">2218</span></a> but a wife cannot dissolve the marriage on
account of the adultery of her husband.<a name="FnAnchor2219"
href="#Footnote2219"><span class="sp">2219</span></a> The husband may
also marry another woman if the wife is carried into captivity<a
name="FnAnchor2220" href="#Footnote2220"><span
class="sp">2220</span></a> or if she deserts him, but in the latter
case only after five years have elapsed and with the bishop’s

class="sp">2221</span></a> Since the days of Charlemagne, however, the
canonical doctrine of the <span class="pagenum"><a

secular legislation of German peoples, and in the tenth century the
ecclesiastical rules and courts gained there exclusive control of this
branch of law.<a name="FnAnchor2222" href="#Footnote2222"><span
class="sp">2222</span></a> At a somewhat earlier date the provisions
of the Roman law had been superseded by new rules enforced by the

<p>While the Western Church in the matter of divorce at last
completely triumphed in the countries under her sway, the Eastern
Church, instead of shaping the secular law, was on the contrary
greatly influenced by it. It is true that the Council of Trullo in 692
expressly condemned divorce by mutual consent, and that largely in
consequence of this condemnation the emperor Leo III. (the Isaurian)
in 740 put a stop to the legality of it; and at the end of the ninth
century the prohibition against it was reinforced, never again to be
relaxed.<a name="FnAnchor2224" href="#Footnote2224"><span
class="sp">2224</span></a> But of the long list of specified grounds
of divorce which were admitted by the secular law none, except that of
absence without tidings, appears even to have been questioned by the
Eastern Church. “The enactments of the emperors and princes as to the
grounds of divorce,” says Zhishman, “never met with an ecclesiastical
contradiction. No Council, no patriarch, no bishop of the East has
ever in that matter called the emperors to account, assigned penalties
to them, or forced them to the repeal of their enactments.”<a
name="FnAnchor2225" href="#Footnote2225"><span
class="sp">2225</span></a> The grounds of divorce with the right of
remarriage are those admitted by the laws of Justinian with certain
modifications introduced in later times. In the Eastern Churches
divorce is permitted on the following grounds, with penalty attached:
high treason, designs of either of the partners on the life of the
other, adultery, circumstances affording presumption of adultery or
equivalent to adultery, the procuring of abortion, difference of
religion arising from the conversion to Christianity of one of the
partners, and the acting as sponsor for one’s own child in baptism.
There are further grounds for divorce, without penalty attached,
namely: impotence, absence without tidings received, captivity and
slavery, insanity and imbecility, the undertaking of monastic
obligations, and episcopal consecration.<a name="FnAnchor2226"

<p>The canonical doctrines that marriage is a sacrament and that it is
indissoluble save by death were rejected by the Reformers. They all
agreed that divorce, with liberty for the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page350"></a>350</span> innocent party to remarry, should be
granted for adultery, and most of them regarded malicious desertion as
a second legitimate cause for the dissolution of marriage.<a
name="FnAnchor2227" href="#Footnote2227"><span
class="sp">2227</span></a> The latter opinion was based on Paul’s
dictum that a Christian married to an unbeliever “is not under
bondage” if the unbeliever depart, which was broadened by Luther so as
to include malicious desertion even without a religious motive.<a
name="FnAnchor2228" href="#Footnote2228"><span
class="sp">2228</span></a> The same reformer admits that the worldly
authorities may allow divorce also on other strong grounds,<a
name="FnAnchor2229" href="#Footnote2229"><span
class="sp">2229</span></a> and mentions himself obstinate refusal of
conjugal intercourse as sufficient cause for it.<a name="FnAnchor2230"
href="#Footnote2230"><span class="sp">2230</span></a> Several
reformers went farther than Luther.<a name="FnAnchor2231"
href="#Footnote2231"><span class="sp">2231</span></a> Lambert of
Avignon argued that if a wife leaves her husband because she is
constantly ill-treated by him without cause, this should be counted as
repudiation by the man and not as desertion by the woman;<a
name="FnAnchor2232" href="#Footnote2232"><span
class="sp">2232</span></a> and Melanchthon likewise justified divorce
in the case of ill-treatment.<a name="FnAnchor2233"
href="#Footnote2233"><span class="sp">2233</span></a> The views of the
Reformers exercised a lasting influence upon the Protestant
legislators both in Germany and in other continental countries. Thus
the Danish law-book issued by Christian V. in 1684 mentions as
sufficient grounds for divorce desertion for at least three years,
impotence which has lasted for the same period, and leprosy which has
been concealed and communicated to the other party.<a
name="FnAnchor2234" href="#Footnote2234"><span
class="sp">2234</span></a> The Swedish code of 1734 allows divorce for
malicious desertion, for long absence without tidings, and for bodily
incapacity or incurable contagious disease deliberately concealed.<a

<p>The Fathers of English Protestantism as a body were more
conservative than the brethren on the Continent. But they were
unanimous in allowing the husband to put away an unfaithful wife and
contract another marriage; and prevailing opinion appears also to have
accorded a similar privilege to the wife on like provocation, although
there were undoubtedly some in the Protestant ranks who were not so
liberal in her behalf.<a name="FnAnchor2236"
href="#Footnote2236"><span class="sp">2236</span></a> A <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page351"></a>351</span> general revision of the
ecclesiastical code, with special attention directed to the law of
divorce, was contemplated in the earlier days of the Reformation. A
commission of leading ecclesiastics was for this purpose appointed by
Henry VIII. and Edward VI. The commissioners drew up the elaborate
report known as <i>Reformatio Legum</i>, in which they recommended
that “divorces from bed and board,” which had been rejected by nearly
all the English reformers of the sixteenth century as a papist
innovation,<a name="FnAnchor2237" href="#Footnote2237"><span
class="sp">2237</span></a> should be abolished, and in their place
complete divorce, with liberty for the innocent party to marry again,
should be allowed in cases of adultery, desertion, and cruelty, as
also in cases where a husband not guilty of deserting his wife had
been for several years absent from her in circumstances which
justified her in considering that he was dead, and in cases of such
violent hatred as rendered it in the highest degree improbable that
the husband and wife would survive their animosities and again love
one another. The whole scheme, however, fell to the ground, partly in
consequence of King Edward’s premature death.<a name="FnAnchor2238"
href="#Footnote2238"><span class="sp">2238</span></a> Yet the
principle represented by it was carried out in practice. In 1548, some
years before the commission had completed its report, the new doctrine
had been in a measure sustained by the well-known case of Lord
Northampton, whose second marriage was declared valid by an Act of
Parliament. Under Elizabeth this decision seems to have been deemed
good law until 1602, when, in the Foljambe case, it was decided that
remarriage after judicial separation was null and void.<a
name="FnAnchor2239" href="#Footnote2239"><span
class="sp">2239</span></a> After the revival of the old canon law,
says Jeaffreson, “our ancestors lived for several generations under a
matrimonial law of unexampled rigour and narrowness. The gates of exit
from true matrimony had all been closed, with the exception of death.
Together with the artificial impediments to wedlock, the Reformation
had demolished the machinery for annulling marriages on fictitious
grounds. Henceforth no man could slip out of matrimonial bondage by
swearing that he was his wife’s distant cousin, or had loved her
sister in his youth, or had before his marriage stood godfather to one
of her near spiritual kindred.”<a name="FnAnchor2240"

<p>In the latter part of the seventeenth century a practice arose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page352"></a>352</span> in England which
in a small degree mitigated the rigour of the law. While a valid
English marriage could not be dissolved by mere judicial authority, it
might be so by a special Act of Parliament. Such a parliamentary
divorce was granted only for adultery: to a husband whose own conduct
had been free from reproach, if he had previously obtained a divorce
from bed and board in the ecclesiastical court, but to a wife only in
aggravated cases, such as incestuous intercourse of her husband with
some of her relations.<a name="FnAnchor2241"
href="#Footnote2241"><span class="sp">2241</span></a> But it was a
remedy within the reach of the wealthier classes only: owing to the
triple cost of the law action, the ecclesiastical decree, and the
legislative proceedings, it could be obtained only through the
expenditure of a fortune sometimes amounting to thousands of pounds.<a
name="FnAnchor2242" href="#Footnote2242"><span
class="sp">2242</span></a> As a matter of fact, up to and including
the year 1857, no more than 317 divorce bills passed,<a
name="FnAnchor2243" href="#Footnote2243"><span
class="sp">2243</span></a> and the practice had already been in
operation for a hundred and thirty years when, in 1801, a married
woman for the first time obtained a divorce of this kind.<a

<p>In the civil divorce law of 1857 the legal principle of the
indissolubility of marriage was at last abandoned, though only after
stubborn resistance. For the dilatory and expensive proceedings of
three tribunals was substituted one inquiry by a court specially
constituted to exercise this jurisdiction, a new “Court for Divorce
and Matrimonial Causes.” On this court was conferred all the authority
of the ecclesiastical courts in matrimonial causes, as also power to
grant “divorce from the bond of matrimony,” as a right, not as a
privilege. Such a divorce, however, could only be granted to a husband
whose wife had been guilty of adultery and to a wife whose husband had
been guilty of incestuous adultery, bigamy with adultery, rape,
sodomy, bestiality, or adultery coupled with cruelty or with desertion
without reasonable excuse for two years and upwards. “Cruelty” has
been defined as “conduct of such a character as to have caused danger
to life, limb, or health (bodily or mental), or as to give rise to a
reasonable apprehension of such danger.”<a name="FnAnchor2245"
href="#Footnote2245"><span class="sp">2245</span></a> In Scotland the
courts began to grant divorces very soon after the Roman connection
had been repudiated, and in 1573 a statute <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page353"></a>353</span> added desertion to adultery of the husband
or the wife as a ground for divorce.<a name="FnAnchor2246"

<p>On the Continent a fresh impetus to a more liberal legislation on
divorce was given in the eighteenth century by the new philosophy with
its conceptions of human freedom and natural rights. If marriage is a
contract entered into by mutual consent it ought also to be
dissolvable if both parties wish to annul the contract. In the
Prussian ‘Project des Corporis Juris Fridericiani’ of 1749, “founded
on reason and the constitutions of the country,” it is admitted that
married people may demand with common consent the dissolution of their
marriage.<a name="FnAnchor2247" href="#Footnote2247"><span
class="sp">2247</span></a> The ‘Project’ never became law; but in
practice divorce was freely granted by Frederick II. <i>ex gratia
principis</i> at the common request of husband and wife.<a
name="FnAnchor2248" href="#Footnote2248"><span
class="sp">2248</span></a> In the Prussian ‘Landrecht’ of 1794 divorce
by mutual consent is admitted if the couple have no children and there
is no reason to suspect levity, precipitation, or compulsion.<a
name="FnAnchor2249" href="#Footnote2249"><span
class="sp">2249</span></a> In France the new ideas led to the law on
divorce of September 20, 1792, previous to which date the Roman canon
law had prevailed. In the preamble of the new law it is said that
marriage is merely a civil contract, and that facility in obtaining
divorce is the natural consequence of the individual’s right of
freedom, which is lost if engagements are made indissoluble.<a
name="FnAnchor2250" href="#Footnote2250"><span
class="sp">2250</span></a> Divorce is granted on the mutual desire of
the two parties,<a name="FnAnchor2251" href="#Footnote2251"><span
class="sp">2251</span></a> and even at the wish of one party on the
ground of incompatibility of temper, subject only to a short period of
delay and to the necessity of appearing before a family council who
are to endeavour to arrange the dispute.<a name="FnAnchor2252"
href="#Footnote2252"><span class="sp">2252</span></a> It was said that
divorce was instituted in order to preserve in marriage “cette
quiétude heureuse qui rend les sentiments plus vifs.”<a
name="FnAnchor2253" href="#Footnote2253"><span
class="sp">2253</span></a> Marriage would no longer be a yoke or a

<p>Twelve years later, in 1804, the law of 1792 was superseded by the
new provisions in Napoleon’s ‘Code civil des Français.’ Divorce was
made more difficult. Mere incompatibility of temper is no longer
recognised as a cause for it. Marriage may still be dissolved on the
ground of mutual consent, but on certain conditions only: the husband
must be at least twenty-five years of age and the wife twenty-one;
they must have been married for at least two years and not more than
twenty years, and the wife must not be over forty-five years of age;
the parents or the other living ascendants of both parties must give
their approval;<a name="FnAnchor2255" href="#Footnote2255"><span
class="sp">2255</span></a> and the mutual and unwavering consent of
the married couple must sufficiently prove “that their common life is
insupportable to them, and that there exists in reference to them a
peremptory cause of divorce.”<a name="FnAnchor2256"
href="#Footnote2256"><span class="sp">2256</span></a> At the
Restoration in 1816 divorce was abolished in France;<a
name="FnAnchor2257" href="#Footnote2257"><span
class="sp">2257</span></a> but it was re-enacted by a law of 1884, the
provisions of which were simplified by later laws. The divorce law of
the Napoleonic Code was again introduced, but with important changes,
one of which was that divorce by mutual consent had disappeared. In
the course of the nineteenth century divorce was made legal in several
Roman Catholic countries even in the case of marriage between
Catholics.<a name="FnAnchor2258" href="#Footnote2258"><span
class="sp">2258</span></a> In the United States South Carolina stands
alone in granting no divorce whatsoever, which is the more remarkable
as no state has fewer Roman Catholic citizens.<a name="FnAnchor2259"
href="#Footnote2259"><span class="sp">2259</span></a> It is the only
Protestant community in the world which nowadays holds marriage
indissoluble, as result of which it has been necessary for the
authorities to enact special legislation concerning the personal and
property rights of extra-legal wives and children.<a

<p>The most general grounds for divorce are offences of some kind or
other committed by either husband or wife, and entitling the other
party to demand a dissolution of the marriage. In this respect the two
spouses are as a rule on a footing of perfect equality; but there are
exceptions to the rule. While any act of adultery in the wife is
everywhere a sufficient cause for <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page355"></a>355</span> dissolving the marriage, there are still
laws that do not allow the wife in all circumstances to demand a
divorce from an adulterous husband. Desertion, or “malicious”
desertion, or desertion “without just cause or excuse,” is very
frequently mentioned as a ground of divorce, especially in Protestant
law-books. In most countries in which divorce is allowed,
ill-treatment of some kind is a sufficient reason for it. An extremely
frequent ground of divorce is the condemnation of one of the parties
to a certain punishment or his or her being convicted of a certain
crime. Some law-books mention as causes for divorce the husband’s
neglect of the duty to support his wife although he is able to do so
(in many jurisdictions of the United States), drunkenness, inveterate
gambling habits, or ill-treatment of children. Moreover, certain
circumstances are recognised grounds of divorce which do not involve
guilt in one of the parties but are supposed to make marriage a burden
for the other spouse, such as impotence in the husband or wife, some
loathsome disease, and insanity or incurable insanity. The Swiss code
contains a provision to the effect that, even though none of the
specified causes for divorce exists, a marriage may be dissolved if
there are circumstances seriously affecting the maintenance of the
conjugal tie.<a name="FnAnchor2261" href="#Footnote2261"><span
class="sp">2261</span></a></p>

<p>The English law was until quite recently the only one in Europe
that recognised none but sexual reasons for the dissolution of
marriage. The Majority Report of the Royal Commission of 1909
recommended that divorce should, in the future, be obtainable for the
following reasons: adultery; wilful desertion for three years and
upwards; cruelty; incurable insanity after five years’ confinement;
habitual drunkenness found to be incurable from the first order for
separation; and imprisonment under commuted sentence of death.<a
name="FnAnchor2262" href="#Footnote2262"><span
class="sp">2262</span></a> These recommendations were deprecated by
the Minority Report, which declared, on the one hand, that there was
no public demand for any such concessions, and on the other hand,
that, as the experience of other countries proved, the granting of the
concession was invariably followed by a sudden and serious increase in
the number of demands for divorce.<a name="FnAnchor2263"
href="#Footnote2263"><span class="sp">2263</span></a> The
recommendations of the Majority Report were ignored, with the
exception of the proposal that in the case of adultery women should be
placed on an equality with men,<a name="FnAnchor2264"
href="#Footnote2264"><span class="sp">2264</span></a> which became law
in 1923. “But that,” says <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page356"></a>356</span> Dr. Havelock Ellis, “left the law in the
highly unsatisfactory condition of only being able to grant the relief
of divorce to unhappily married couples when they have agreed to
commit either adultery or perjury. In 1936 an extremely temperate
Marriage Bill, initiated by Mr. A. P. Herbert, was introduced into the
House of Commons; it was framed in so moderate a spirit in order (as
Mr. Herbert put it) ‘to secure, for the first time, agreement of the
majority of churchmen and to relieve the conscience of the clergy.’ .
. . Even this Bill, however, was whittled down in its passage through
Parliament, but became law in 1937 as the Matrimonial Causes Act.”<a

<p>Legislators are still imbued with the idea that a marriage must
inevitably end in a catastrophe, either by the death or some great
misfortune of one of the consorts or by the commission of a criminal
or immoral act, which is evidently regarded as a more proper ground or
excuse for dissolving the marriage than the mutual agreement of both.
Divorce by mutual consent, which was recognised by Roman law and for a
short time in France at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of
the nineteenth century, is nowadays legal in a few countries only. It
remained so in Belgium and Rumania after it was abolished in France,
but in both countries the old barriers of the Code Napoléon were
preserved, which made it very rare in practice. The civil code of
imperial Austria permitted such divorce to Jews&mdash;though to no
other citizens&mdash;in accordance with the principle of the Rabbinic
law that the court has no right to interfere when both parties declare
that their marriage is a failure and that they desire to dissolve it.
In Mexico the marriage may be dissolved, after the observance of
certain formalities, by the mutual agreement of the parties when they
have been married for at least a year. In Portugal a divorce may be
obtained after a separation <i>de facto</i> by mutual consent for ten
years. In Denmark marriage may be dissolved upon the common
application of the parties after living apart for one year and a half,
and in Norway and Guatemala after one year’s separation in accordance
with a decree of separation, and such a decree may itself have been
obtained by mutual consent. The laws of Sweden, Finland, Greece, and
Costa Rica admit likewise consensual separation; and a separation may,
upon the application of either husband or wife, be converted into a
divorce, in Denmark after two years and a half, in Norway, Finland,
Greece (apparently), and Costa Rica after two years, and in Sweden
after one year. In the Soviet law there are no such restrictions. It
goes in fact even further than the French law <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page357"></a>357</span> of 1792 by simply stating that “the
grounds for divorce may be either the mutual consent of the parties or
the desire of one of them.”<a name="FnAnchor2266"
href="#Footnote2266"><span class="sp">2266</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote2266"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor2266"><sup>2266</sup></a></span> E. Westermarck, <i>The
Future of Marriage in Western Civilisation</i> (London, 1936), p. 210
<i>sqq.</i></p></div>

<p>The unequivocal recent trend of Western legislation has been to
increase the legal facilities of divorce, and, as Dr. Ellis remarks,
“in no civilised country is there any progressive movement for adding
to the legal impediments”;<a name="FnAnchor2267"
href="#Footnote2267"><span class="sp">2267</span></a> and there is
every reason to believe that this trend will continue in the future.
The unreasonable impediments to divorce are only the diluted effects
of the Canon Law with its total prohibition of divorce, in conformity
with the ascetic spirit of Christianity. In many Catholic countries
the Church has already lost her power to enforce this prohibition, and
in some of them it has even been succeeded by a remarkably liberal
divorce law, owing to the fact that her grounds of divorce have been
largely copied from the earlier law relating to judicial separation (a
very convenient procedure), which could be obtained more easily than
divorce in most Protestant countries.<a name="FnAnchor2268"
href="#Footnote2268"><span class="sp">2268</span></a> We may take for
granted that the canonic dogma of the indissolubility of marriage, in
spite of papal protests, will before very long lose its hold on the
legislation of the rest of the Catholic world; and so also the idea
that a divorce mostly presupposes a delinquent, which is likewise
rooted in the ascetic tendencies of early Christianity, is undoubtedly
doomed. The divorce laws of the different Western countries will, no
doubt, always vary in details; but I think one may safely predict that
divorce by mutual consent will, sooner or later, be generally
recognised by them. It has in recent years been established in an
increasing number of countries; and elsewhere it is strongly advocated
by enlightened opinion both in Europe and America.</p>

<p>Some curious objections have been raised to it, besides the general
one that it would make divorce too easy and thereby lessen the
“sanctity of marriage.” In his evidence before the Royal Commission,
Lord Gorell argued that divorce by mutual consent would in practice
“probably prove to amount to divorce at the will of either party who
could make the other’s life unbearable in order to force a consent.”<a
name="FnAnchor2269" href="#Footnote2269"><span
class="sp">2269</span></a> A similar objection might be made to the
chief ground of divorce which is recognised <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page358"></a>358</span> everywhere: it might give rise to the
practice of one of the partners hectoring the other by adulterous
behaviour with a view to coercing the latter into suing for a divorce.
Another argument which has been adduced against divorce by mutual
agreement is that it might lead to a precipitated dissolution of the
marriage. Mr. Groves asks: “How many of the marriages that have now
achieved happiness would have been dissolved in the early days of
matrimonial adjustment had there been in the past a social code built
upon divorce by mutual consent?” He answers: “No one knows, but men
and women of experience have estimated that it would have been as high
as fifty per cent.”<a name="FnAnchor2270" href="#Footnote2270"><span
class="sp">2270</span></a> (Another opponent of divorce by mutual
consent writes, on the contrary, that such consent to the dissolution
of marriage “is comparatively rare, for it is a matter of human
experience that one of the partners very often refuses to release the
other.”)<a name="FnAnchor2271" href="#Footnote2271"><span
class="sp">2271</span></a> Precipitation is by no means infrequent
when a marriage is dissolved on other grounds; many divorced couples
would perhaps remarry if they did not fear it would make them
ridiculous.<a name="FnAnchor2272" href="#Footnote2272"><span
class="sp">2272</span></a> It is just where divorce is possible on the
ground of mutual consent that legislators have taken precautions to
prevent a hasty step: they have done so in all modern laws which
recognise such a ground for divorce, particularly by requiring
previous separation for a certain period, with the single exception of
the Soviet law.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the arguments in favour of divorce by mutual
consent seem unanswerable. Milton, who was its first protagonist in
Christendom, insisted that “marriage is not a mere carnal coition, but
a human society”;<a name="FnAnchor2273" href="#Footnote2273"><span
class="sp">2273</span></a> that the just ground for divorce is
“indisposition, unfitness, or contrariety of mind, arising from a
cause in nature unchangeable, hindering and ever likely to hinder, the
main benefits of conjugal society, which are solace and peace”;<a
name="FnAnchor2274" href="#Footnote2274"><span
class="sp">2274</span></a> and that it is a violent, cruel thing “to
force the continuing of those together, whom God and nature in the
gentlest end of marriage never joined.”<a name="FnAnchor2275"
href="#Footnote2275"><span class="sp">2275</span></a>  Dr.
Lichtenberger observes that “the dissolution of loveless marriages now
is regarded as less immoral than their continuance. The enlightened
conscience rebels against compulsion in sex relations, regarding it as
a species of rape as revolting within the marriage <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page359"></a>359</span> bond as it is
without.”<a name="FnAnchor2276" href="#Footnote2276"><span
class="sp">2276</span></a> Mr. Shaw makes the acute remark: “To impose
marriage on two unmarried people who do not desire to marry one
another would be admittedly an act of enslavement. But it is no worse
than to impose a continuation of marriage on people who have ceased to
desire to be married.”<a name="FnAnchor2277"

<h4>CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<h3>CHRISTIANITY AND IRREGULAR SEX RELATIONS</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">I</span><span class="smcap">N</span> an earlier chapter I have spoken of
abstinence from sexual relationships as the most important form of
Christian asceticism, of the high appreciation of virginity, of the
obligatory celibacy of the clergy, and of the sinfulness attributed to
concupiscence. While the gratification of it in marriage was condoned,
all other forms of sexual intercourse were looked upon as mortal
sins.</p>
<p>The horror of them found an echo in the secular legislation of the
first Christian emperors. Panders were condemned to have molten lead
poured down their throats.<a name="FnAnchor2278"
href="#Footnote2278"><span class="sp">2278</span></a> In the case of
forcible seduction both the man and woman, if she consented to the
act, were put to death.<a name="FnAnchor2279"
href="#Footnote2279"><span class="sp">2279</span></a> Even the
innocent offspring of illicit intercourse were punished for their
parents’ sins with ignominy and loss of certain rights which belonged
to other, more respectable, members of the Church and the State; some
mediæval lawbooks treated them as almost rightless beings, on a par
with robbers and thieves.<a name="FnAnchor2280"
href="#Footnote2280"><span class="sp">2280</span></a> Persons of
different sex who were not united in wedlock were forbidden by the
Church to kiss each other; nay, the sexual desire itself, though
unaccompanied by any outward act, was regarded as sinful in the
unmarried.<a name="FnAnchor2281" href="#Footnote2281"><span
class="sp">2281</span></a> Consequently, anything that would tend to
arouse a feeling of sexual excitement or a temptation to lust was
condemned. The Church prescribed punishment for the writing or reading
of lascivious books, singing wanton songs, dancing suggestive dances,
wearing improper clothing, bathing in mixed company, frequenting the
theatre, or permitting suspected vigils or pernoctations of women in
churches under pretence of <span class="pagenum"><a

href="#Footnote2282"><span class="sp">2282</span></a> In the standard
of purity no difference of sex was recognised, the same obligations
being imposed upon man and woman.</p>

<p>In this respect there was a fundamental difference between the
Christians and the Pagans. In Greece the chastity of an unmarried girl
was anxiously guarded.<a name="FnAnchor2283"
href="#Footnote2283"><span class="sp">2283</span></a> According to
Athenian law, the relatives of a maiden who had lost her virtue could
with impunity kill the seducer on the spot.<a name="FnAnchor2284"
href="#Footnote2284"><span class="sp">2284</span></a> Virginity was an
object of worship. Chastity was the pre-eminent attribute of sanctity
ascribed to Athene and Artemis, and the Parthenon, or virgin’s temple,
was the noblest religious edifice of Athens. It is true that a certain
class of courtesans occupied a remarkably high position in the social
life of Greece, being admired and sought after even by the principal
men. But they did so on account of their extraordinary beauty or their
intellectual superiority; to the Greek mind the moral standard was by
no means the only standard of excellence. The Roman, on the other
hand, regarded the courtesan class with much contempt. He encouraged
brothels, but only entered them with covered head and face concealed
in his cloak. He tolerated the prostitute, but sharply curtailed her
privileges. She could go almost naked if she pleased, but might not
even wear the <i>vitta</i> or the <i>stola</i>; she must not ape the
emblems of the respectable Roman matron.<a name="FnAnchor2285"
href="#Footnote2285"><span class="sp">2285</span></a> The names of
prostitutes had to be published on the ædile’s list, as Tacitus says,
“according to a recognised custom of our ancestors, who considered it
a sufficient punishment on unchaste women to have to profess their
shame.”<a name="FnAnchor2286" href="#Footnote2286"><span
class="sp">2286</span></a> But both in Rome and Greece pre-nuptial
unchastity in men, when it was not excessive,<a name="FnAnchor2287"
href="#Footnote2287"><span class="sp">2287</span></a> or did not take
some especially offensive form, was hardly censured by public opinion.
The elder Cato expressly justified it.<a name="FnAnchor2288"
href="#Footnote2288"><span class="sp">2288</span></a> Cicero says: “If
there be any one who thinks that youth is to be wholly interdicted
from amours with courtesans, he certainly is very strict indeed. I
cannot deny what he says; but still he is at variance not only with
the licence of the present age, but even with the habits of our
ancestors, and with what they used to consider allowable. For when was
the time that men were not used to act in this manner? When was such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page362"></a>362</span> conduct found
fault with? When was it not permitted? When, in short, was the time
when that which is lawful was not lawful?”<a name="FnAnchor2289"
href="#Footnote2289"><span class="sp">2289</span></a> Epictetus only
went a little step further. He said to his disciples: “Concerning
sexual pleasures, it is right to be pure before marriage, as much as
in you lies. But if you indulge in them, let it be according to what
is lawful. But do not in any case make yourself disagreeable to those
who use such pleasures, nor be fond of reproving them, nor of putting
yourself forward as not using them.”<a name="FnAnchor2290"
href="#Footnote2290"><span class="sp">2290</span></a> Here chastity in
men is at all events recognised as an ideal.</p>

<p>Yet even in pagan antiquity there were a few who enjoined it as a
duty.<a name="FnAnchor2291" href="#Footnote2291"><span
class="sp">2291</span></a> Musonius Rufus emphatically asserted that
no union of the sexes other than marriage was permissible,<a
name="FnAnchor2292" href="#Footnote2292"><span
class="sp">2292</span></a> and Dio Chrysostom desired prostitution to
be suppressed by law.<a name="FnAnchor2293" href="#Footnote2293"><span
class="sp">2293</span></a> Similar views grew up in connection with
the Neo-Platonic and Neo-Pythagorean philosophies, and may be traced
back to the ancient masters themselves. We are told that Pythagoras
inculcated the virtue of chastity so successfully that when ten of his
disciples, being attacked, might have escaped by crossing a
bean-field, they died to a man rather than tread down the beans, which
were supposed to have a mystic affinity with the seat of impure
desires.<a name="FnAnchor2294" href="#Footnote2294"><span
class="sp">2294</span></a> Plato, again, is in favour of a law to the
effect that “no one shall venture to touch any person of the freeborn
or noble class except his wedded wife, or sow the unconsecrated and
bastard seed among harlots, or in barren and unnatural lusts.” Our
citizens, he says, ought not to be worse than birds and beasts, which
live without intercourse, pure and chaste, until the age for
procreation, and afterwards, when they have arrived at that period and
the male has paired with the female and the female with the male,
“live the rest of their lives in holiness and innocence, abiding
firmly in their original compact.”<a name="FnAnchor2295"

<p>With regard to prostitution, the attitude of the Christians was not
so uniform as might have been anticipated. While it was denounced as
immoral by the more independent and irresponsible divines, others
tended reluctantly to justify it as a means of avoiding greater
evils.<a name="FnAnchor2296" href="#Footnote2296"><span
class="sp">2296</span></a> Foremost among these was <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page363"></a>363</span> Augustine. In a
treatise written in 386 to vindicate the divine regulation of the
world, we find him declaring that just as the executioner, however
repulsive he may be, occupies a necessary place in society, so the
prostitute and her like, however sordid and ugly and wicked they may
be, are equally necessary; “remove prostitutes from human affairs and
you would pollute the world with lust.”<a name="FnAnchor2297"
href="#Footnote2297"><span class="sp">2297</span></a> Christian
emperors, like their pagan predecessors, were also willing to derive a
tax from prostitution; and when, from time to time, some vigorous
ruler sought to repress it by severe enactments these were of no
avail. During a thousand years these enactments were repeated again
and again in various parts of Europe, and invariably with the same
fruitless or worse than fruitless results.<a name="FnAnchor2298"
href="#Footnote2298"><span class="sp">2298</span></a> In England, in
the fourteenth century, prostitution was carried on largely in
licensed stews in Southwark, because brothels were forbidden within
the city of London, and the bishop of Winchester, who was lord of the
manor, had as such jurisdiction over and a profit from the stews, the
inmates of which were popularly known as “Winchester Geese.” It seemed
not to disconcert the bishop or the Church that these women, from whom
they profited, were not permitted to receive the rites of the Church
while they lived, nor a Christian burial upon their death. There was a
cemetery appointed for them far from the parish church, for, as Coke
said, brothel-houses were prohibited by the law of God.<a

<p>As Christianity in its condemnation of unchastity in the unmarried
made no distinction between man and woman, it made no distinction
between husband and wife in its condemnation of adultery. If
continence is a stringent duty for unmarried persons independently of
their sex, the observance of the sacred marriage vow must be so in a
still higher degree. And in this respect also the Christian view
differed essentially from the Pagan one. The Romans defined adultery
as sexual intercourse with another man’s wife; on the other hand, the
intercourse of a married man with an unmarried woman was not regarded
as adultery.<a name="FnAnchor2300" href="#Footnote2300"><span
class="sp">2300</span></a> The ordinary Greek feeling on the subject
is expressed in the oration against Neæra, ascribed to Demosthenes,
where the licence accorded to husbands is spoken of as a matter of
course: “We keep mistresses for our pleasures, concubines for constant
attendance, and wives to bear us <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page364"></a>364</span> legitimate children and to be our faithful
housekeepers.”<a name="FnAnchor2301" href="#Footnote2301"><span
class="sp">2301</span></a> But at the same time the idea that fidelity
in marriage ought to be reciprocal was not entirely unknown in classic
antiquity. In a lost chapter of his ‘Economics’ Aristotle points out
that it for various reasons is prudent for a man to be faithful to his
wife but that nothing is so peculiarly the property of a wife as a
chaste and hallowed intercourse.<a name="FnAnchor2302"
href="#Footnote2302"><span class="sp">2302</span></a> Plutarch
condemns the man who, lustful and dissolute, goes astray with a
courtesan or maidservant; though, at the same time, he admonishes the
wife not to be vexed or impatient considering that “it is out of
respect to her that he bestows upon another all his wanton
depravity.”<a name="FnAnchor2303" href="#Footnote2303"><span
class="sp">2303</span></a> Plautus argues that it is unjust of a
husband to exact a fidelity which he does not keep himself.<a

<p>The Christian condemnation of all forms of sexual intercourse
outside the marriage relation found a minute expression in the
Penitentials, which were catalogues of offences with the exact measure
of penance for each offence. Before the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons
there had been such codifications of penances made in Ireland and
Wales, but it was the second archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore of
Tarsus, who gave authority and wide acceptance to a codified
penitential. Upon his death in 690 his disciples collected and
arranged the decisions he had made in actual cases of penitence that
had come before him, for which he had freely used the rules of Church
Councils and the teachings of Church Fathers, particularly Basil. The
penitential of Theodore was widely applied not only in England but on
the Continent, and was followed by some other similar compilations,
those of Bede and others, made before the end of the tenth century.
But the Penitentials were a part not only of the ecclesiastical
discipline, but of the Anglo-Saxon law as well. From the time of its
first introduction into England the penitential power included the
judicial power. Just as the penance might be prescribed by the priest
as a voluntary atonement, so it might be prescribed by the judicial
officer as a sort of punishment; and refusal of the sinner to submit
to the judicial sentence was punishable by excommunication.<a
name="FnAnchor2305" href="#Footnote2305"><span
class="sp">2305</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote2305"></a><a

class="ib" title="Social Control and Sex Expression">op.
cit.</span></i>  pp. 60, 61, 67 <i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>“The Anglo-Saxon Penitentials,” says Dr. May, “placed upon matters
of sex more emphasis, both in quantity of regulation and in minuteness
of detail, than has, probably, any other general code of conduct.”<a
name="FnAnchor2306" href="#Footnote2306"><span
class="sp">2306</span></a> The penance imposed by <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page365"></a>365</span> Theodore and Bede for
simple fornication was generally one year, but this was increased
according to the frequency of the act and the age and discretion of
the parties. Adultery was a far more serious offence, entailing in
some cases only a two-year penance and in others as much as a
seven-year fast on bread and water. Penance was ordered even for
lustful thoughts with no external expression; indeed, according to
Theodore the atonement for thought was to be as severe as the
atonement for the act. The amount of concern with auto-erotism is more
marked than with any other form of sexual behaviour. Omitting the
chapters of discipline that apply specifically to the clergy,
self-abuse was the subject of 25 paragraphs in the Penitentials. With
infinite care the varieties of the offence were differentiated, the
persons by whom it was committed, their age, their station&mdash;lay
or clerical&mdash;and dignity, the place where it was committed, and
the thoughts connected with the commission. For a layman the penance
ascribed was usually forty days; for the clergy it was severe
according to the rank of the offender. Sodomy and bestiality were
considered in at least 22 paragraphs. The divisions of the offences
were various, according to the age and position of the one committing
them, the one with whom committed, and the method of commission. The
penances imposed were severe&mdash;as long as twenty-two years or, for
some offences, for life.<a name="FnAnchor2307"

<p>In the case of extra-matrimonial connections, as in many other
points of morals, there has been considerable discrepancy between
Christian doctrine and public opinion in Christian countries. The
gross and open immorality of the Middle Ages indicates how little the
idea of sexual purity entered into the manners and opinions of the
people. The influence of the ascetic doctrine of the Church was in
fact quite contrary to its aspirations. The institution of clerical
celibacy created a large class of people to which illicit love was the
only means of gratifying a natural desire. In England, late in the
thirteenth century Bracton speaks of the <i>concubina legitima</i> as
entitled to certain rights and considerations,<a name="FnAnchor2308"
href="#Footnote2308"><span class="sp">2308</span></a> and among the
clergy concubinage prevailed universally, although it was the object
of unremitting assault from Councils and prelates.<a
name="FnAnchor2309" href="#Footnote2309"><span
class="sp">2309</span></a> Elsewhere in Europe it had so established
itself among the clerical order that even the loftiest prelates shrunk
from encountering the risk <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page366"></a>366</span> attendant upon an attempt to enforce the
canons against it. In 1537, the archbishop of Salzburg timidly
suggested in a pastoral letter that if the clergy could not restrain
their passions, they should at all events indulge them secretly, so
that scandal might be avoided and the punishment of their
transgressions be left to an avenging God.<a name="FnAnchor2310"
href="#Footnote2310"><span class="sp">2310</span></a> In Spain, in the
thirteenth and following centuries, all attempts to suppress clerical
concubinage were likewise in vain.<a name="FnAnchor2311"

<p>During the Middle Ages incontinence was largely an object of
ridicule rather than censure, and in the comic literature of that
period the clergy are represented as the great corrupters of domestic
virtue.<a name="FnAnchor2312" href="#Footnote2312"><span
class="sp">2312</span></a> Whether the tenet of chastity laid down by
the code of Chivalry was taken more seriously may be fairly doubted. A
knight, it was said, should be abstinent and chaste;<a
name="FnAnchor2313" href="#Footnote2313"><span
class="sp">2313</span></a> he should love only the virtues, talents,
and graces of his lady;<a name="FnAnchor2314"
href="#Footnote2314"><span class="sp">2314</span></a> and love was
defined as the “chaste union of two hearts by virtue wrought.”<a
name="FnAnchor2315" href="#Footnote2315"><span
class="sp">2315</span></a> But while the knight had certain claims as
regards the virtue of his lady, while he probably was inclined to draw
his sword only for a woman of fair reputation, and while he himself
professed to aspire only to her lip or hand, we have reason to believe
that the amours in which he indulged with her were of a far less
delicate kind. Sainte-Palaye observes: “Jamais on ne vit les mœurs
plus corrompues que du temps de nos Chevaliers, et jamais le règne de
la débauche ne fut plus universel.”<a name="FnAnchor2316"
href="#Footnote2316"><span class="sp">2316</span></a> For a mediæval
knight the chief object of life was love; he who did not understand
how to win a lady was but half a man; and the difference between a
lover and a seducer was apparently slight.</p>

<p>The Reformation brought about some change, if in no other respect
at least by making marriage lawful for the clergy. In fits of
religious enthusiasm even the secular legislators busied themselves
with acts of incontinence in which two unmarried adults of different
sex were consenting parties. In the days of the Commonwealth, in cases
of less serious breach of chastity than adultery and incest, each man
or woman was for each <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page367"></a>367</span> offence to be committed to the common gaol
for three months, and to find sureties for good behaviour during a
whole year afterwards.<a name="FnAnchor2317"
href="#Footnote2317"><span class="sp">2317</span></a> In Scotland,
after the Reformation, fornication was punished with a severity nearly
equal to that which attended the infraction of the marriage vow.<a
name="FnAnchor2318" href="#Footnote2318"><span
class="sp">2318</span></a> But the fate of these and similar laws has
been either to be repealed or to become inactive.<a
name="FnAnchor2319" href="#Footnote2319"><span
class="sp">2319</span></a> For ordinary acts of incontinence public
opinion is, practically at least, the only judge. In the case of
female unchastity its sentence is severe enough among the upper ranks
of society while, so far as the lower classes are concerned, it varies
considerably even in different parts of the same country, and is in
many cases mild or acquitting.</p>

<p>Even then the girl may have to pay for her incontinence.
Illegitimate childbirth is a frequent cause of prostitution, not only
on account of the consequences of the mother’s lost virginity, but
also for economic reasons. Nowadays she has generally the right to
claim support for her child from its father. But there are numbers of
cases in which she, for some reason or other, can obtain no support at
all, and when she receives some, it is generally quite inadequate from
the child’s point of view.<a name="FnAnchor2320"
href="#Footnote2320"><span class="sp">2320</span></a> The illegitimacy
of birth affects the offspring even more than the mother. The
death-rate for illegitimate infants is very much higher than that for
legitimate ones on account of the unmarried mother’s inferior economic
and social conditions; and another result of them is the comparatively
large number of criminals among the children of unmarried parents, who
grow up in so unfavourable circumstances.<a name="FnAnchor2321"
href="#Footnote2321"><span class="sp">2321</span></a> The way in which
they have been treated in the Christian world is a disgrace to its
civilisation. In Teutonic countries their position was much better in
earlier times than subsequently, when the new religion made its
influence felt.<a name="FnAnchor2322" href="#Footnote2322"><span
class="sp">2322</span></a> And there are still traces left of this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page368"></a>368</span> iniquity.<a
name="FnAnchor2323" href="#Footnote2323"><span
class="sp">2323</span></a> As to incontinence of unmarried men, it
seems to me that Christianity has done little more than establish a
standard which, though accepted perhaps in theory, is scarcely
recognised by the feelings of the large majority of people, or at
least of men, in Christian countries. The words which Cicero uttered
on behalf of Cœlius might be repeated by any modern advocate who, in
defending his client, ventured frankly to express the popular opinion
on the subject.</p>

argues that as the infant has been born outside the law, it is not
protected by the law; it has, as it were, crept into the community as
contraband (<i>verbotene Waare</i>), and as it should not be there at
all, the community may ignore both its existence and its destruction.
He looks upon this as a dictate of “practical reason”; but, as I have
tried to show in my book <i>Ethical Relativity</i> (London, 1932), ch.
ix, all his dictates of that mysterious faculty are really only
expressions of his emotions; and in the present case the puritanic
influence is obvious.</p></div>

<p>Nor has Christianity in the case of adultery succeeded in
eradicating every distinction between husband and wife. Whilst any act
of adultery in the wife is everywhere a sufficient cause for
dissolving the marriage, there are countries in which adultery on the
part of the husband only in certain circumstances gives the wife a
right to demand a divorce;<a name="FnAnchor2324"
href="#Footnote2324"><span class="sp">2324</span></a> and in Roman
Catholic countries where divorce is prohibited we find a similar
difference between the infidelity between the husband and that of the
wife in the case of judicial separation.<a name="FnAnchor2325"
href="#Footnote2325"><span class="sp">2325</span></a> But the law may
also in other respects make a distinction between them. The French
code considers it “excusable” if a husband kills his adulterous wife
in the act;<a name="FnAnchor2326" href="#Footnote2326"><span
class="sp">2326</span></a> and it makes such a wife liable to
imprisonment, while the adultery of a husband is punishable only if he
keeps a concubine in the conjugal domicile, and then the punishment is
merely a fine.<a name="FnAnchor2327" href="#Footnote2327"><span
class="sp">2327</span></a> According to the Spanish penal code of
1928, the adultery of a wife is likewise punishable in all
circumstances, but that of a husband only if he keeps his accomplice
in the house or, otherwise, if his behaviour gives rise to scandal.<a
name="FnAnchor2328" href="#Footnote2328"><span
class="sp">2328</span></a> So also, according to the Italian code of
1930, the adultery of a wife, called <i>adulterio</i>, is punishable
in any case, but that of a husband, called <i>concubinato</i>, only if
he keeps his mistress in his home or if he keeps her elsewhere
“notoriously.”<a name="FnAnchor2329" href="#Footnote2329"><span
class="sp">2329</span></a> In modern legislation adultery, if
punishable at all, is generally an indictable offence, but, as a
matter of fact, it is very rarely punished.<a name="FnAnchor2330"
href="#Footnote2330"><span class="sp">2330</span></a> In England an
Act passed in the middle of the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page369"></a>369</span> seventeenth century made the adultery of a
wife (nothing is said of a husband) felony, both for her and her
partner in guilt, and therefore punishable by death;<a
name="FnAnchor2331" href="#Footnote2331"><span
class="sp">2331</span></a> but this Act fell with the fall of the
Commonwealth.<a name="FnAnchor2332" href="#Footnote2332"><span
class="sp">2332</span></a> Parliament has never acted to deprive the
Church of her jurisdiction over adultery, but no attempt to make it
punishable by the criminal law has succeeded.<a name="FnAnchor2333"
href="#Footnote2333"><span class="sp">2333</span></a> In the United
States, where the Puritan tradition as to sexual offences is dying
more slowly than it died in England, there are only two states that
have no provision whatsoever for the punishment of adultery, whilst in
eighteen other states a single act of adultery is not in itself a
criminal offence.<a name="FnAnchor2334" href="#Footnote2334"><span

adultery.<a name="FnAnchor2335" href="#Footnote2335"><span

<p>The early Christians’ horror of sodomy has exercised a profounder
and more lasting influence upon moral opinion and law than their
condemnation of any other form of irregular sex behaviour. It was
determined by ancient Hebrew ideas. According to the Old Testament,
unnatural sins were not allowed to defile the land of the Lord:
whosoever should commit such abominations should be put to death.<a
name="FnAnchor2336" href="#Footnote2336"><span
class="sp">2336</span></a> The enormous abhorrence of them expressed
in the law had a very special reason, the Hebrews’ hatred of a foreign
cult. Unnatural sin was the sin of a people which was not the Lord’s
people, the Canaanites, who thereby polluted their land, so that He
visited their guilt and spued out its inhabitants.<a
name="FnAnchor2337" href="#Footnote2337"><span
class="sp">2337</span></a> We know that sodomy entered as an element
in their religion: besides female temple prostitutes there were male
prostitutes, <i>qedēshīm</i>, attached to their temples.<a
name="FnAnchor2338" href="#Footnote2338"><span
class="sp">2338</span></a> The word <i>qādēsh</i>, translated
“sodomite,” properly denotes a man dedicated to a deity;<a
name="FnAnchor2339" href="#Footnote2339"><span
class="sp">2339</span></a> and it appears that such men were
consecrated to the mother of the gods, the famous Dea Syria, whose
priests or devotees they were considered to be.<a name="FnAnchor2340"
href="#Footnote2340"><span class="sp">2340</span></a> The sodomitic
acts committed with these temple prostitutes may, like the connections
with priestesses, have had in view to transfer <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page370"></a>370</span> blessings to the
worshippers. In Morocco supernatural benefits are expected not only
from heterosexual, but also from homosexual intercourse with a holy
person.<a name="FnAnchor2341" href="#Footnote2341"><span
class="sp">2341</span></a> The <i>qedēshīm</i> are alluded to in the
Old Testament, especially in the period of the monarchy, when rites of
foreign origin made their way into both Israel and Judah.<a
name="FnAnchor2342" href="#Footnote2342"><span
class="sp">2342</span></a> And it is natural that the
Yahveh-worshipper should regard their practices with the utmost horror
as forming part of an idolatrous cult.</p>

<p>When this horror of homosexuality passed into Christianity the
notion that sodomy is a form of sacrilege was here strengthened by the
habits of the Gentiles. Paul found the abominations rampant among the
nations who had “changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped
and served the creature more than the Creator”; he regarded them as
the climax of the moral corruption to which God gave over the heathen
because of their apostasy from him.<a name="FnAnchor2343"
href="#Footnote2343"><span class="sp">2343</span></a> Tertullian says
that they are banished “not only from the threshold, but from all
shelter of the church, because they are not sins, but
monstrosities.”<a name="FnAnchor2344" href="#Footnote2344"><span
class="sp">2344</span></a> Basil maintains that they deserve the same
punishment as murder, idolatry, and witchcraft.<a name="FnAnchor2345"
href="#Footnote2345"><span class="sp">2345</span></a> According to a
decree of the Council of Elvira those who abuse boys to satisfy their
lusts are denied communion even after their last hour.<a
name="FnAnchor2346" href="#Footnote2346"><span
class="sp">2346</span></a> The Christian emperors Constantius and
Theodosius ordered that sodomites should be punished with death by the
sword or be burnt alive.<a name="FnAnchor2347"
href="#Footnote2347"><span class="sp">2347</span></a> For ages sodomy
remained a religious offence of the first order. It was not only a
“vitium nefandum et super omnia detestandum,”<a name="FnAnchor2348"
href="#Footnote2348"><span class="sp">2348</span></a> but it was one
of the four “clamantia peccata,” or crying sins,<a name="FnAnchor2349"
href="#Footnote2349"><span class="sp">2349</span></a> a “crime de
Majestie, vers le Roy celestre.”<a name="FnAnchor2350"
href="#Footnote2350"><span class="sp">2350</span></a> During the
Middle Ages heretics were accused of it as a matter of course.<a
name="FnAnchor2351" href="#Footnote2351"><span
class="sp">2351</span></a> Indeed, so closely was it associated with
heresy that the same name was applied to both. In ‘La Coutume de
Touraine-Anjou’ the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page371"></a>371</span> word <i>herite</i>, which is the ancient
form of <i>hérétique</i>,<a name="FnAnchor2352"
href="#Footnote2352"><span class="sp">2352</span></a> seems to be used
in the sense of “sodomite”;<a name="FnAnchor2353"
href="#Footnote2353"><span class="sp">2353</span></a> and the French
<i>bougre</i> (from the Latin <i>Bulgarus</i>, Bulgarian), to which
there is an English equivalent, was originally given to a sect of
heretics who in the eleventh century came from Bulgaria, and was
afterwards applied to other heretics; but at the same time it became
the regular expression for a sodomite.<a name="FnAnchor2354"
href="#Footnote2354"><span class="sp">2354</span></a> In mediæval laws
sodomy was also repeatedly mentioned together with heresy, and the
punishment was the same for both.<a name="FnAnchor2355"
href="#Footnote2355"><span class="sp">2355</span></a> It is
interesting to notice that in one other religion, besides Hebrewism
and Christianity, it has been looked upon with the same abhorrence,
namely, Zoroastrianism, and there also as a practice of infidels, of
Turanian shamanists.<a name="FnAnchor2356" href="#Footnote2356"><span

<p>In no other point of morals was the contrast between the teachings
of Christianity and the habits and opinions of the world over which it
spread more radical than in their attitude towards homosexuality. In
ancient Greece pederasty in its baser forms was censured, though
generally, it seems, with no great severity; but the universal rule
was apparently that when decorum was observed in the friendship
between a man and a youth, no inquiries were made into the details of
the relationship. And this attachment was not only regarded as
permissible, but was praised as the highest form of love, as the
offspring of the heavenly Aphrodite, as a path leading to virtue, as a
weapon against tyranny, as a safeguard of civic liberty, as a source
of national greatness and glory.<a name="FnAnchor2357"
href="#Footnote2357"><span class="sp">2357</span></a> In Rome there
was an old law of unknown date, called Lex Scantinia (or Scatinia),
which imposed a mulct on him who committed pederasty with a free
person;<a name="FnAnchor2358" href="#Footnote2358"><span
class="sp">2358</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page372"></a>372</span> but this law, of which very little is
known, had lain dormant for ages, and the subject had never afterwards
attracted the attention of the pagan legislators.<a
name="FnAnchor2359" href="#Footnote2359"><span
class="sp">2359</span></a> But when Christianity became the religion
of the Roman Empire, a veritable crusade was opened against it.
Constantius and Constans made it a capital crime, punishable with the
sword.<a name="FnAnchor2360" href="#Footnote2360"><span
class="sp">2360</span></a> Valentinian went further still and ordered
that those who were found guilty of it should be burned alive in the
presence of all the people.<a name="FnAnchor2361"
href="#Footnote2361"><span class="sp">2361</span></a> Justinian,
terrified by certain famines, earthquakes, and pestilences, issued an
edict which again condemned persons guilty of unnatural offences to
the sword, “lest, as the result of these impious acts, whole cities
should perish together with their inhabitants,” as we are taught by
the Holy Scripture, that through such acts cities have perished with
the men in them.<a name="FnAnchor2362" href="#Footnote2362"><span
class="sp">2362</span></a> “A sentence of death and infamy,” says
Gibbon, “was often founded on the slight and suspicious evidence of a
child or a servant, . . . and pederasty became the crime of those to
whom no crime could be imputed.”<a name="FnAnchor2363"

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages and later, Christian legislators thought
that nothing but a painful death in the flames could atone for the
sinful act.<a name="FnAnchor2364" href="#Footnote2364"><span

subject for ecclesiastical cognisance, capital punishment could not be
inflicted on the criminal unless the Church relinquished him to the
secular arm; and it seems very doubtful whether she did relinquish
him. Pollock and Maitland consider that the statute of 1533, which
made sodomy felony, affords an almost sufficient proof that the
temporal courts had not punished it, and that no one had been put to
death for it for a very long time past.<a name="FnAnchor2367"

<p>In Christian Europe the rationalistic movement of the eighteenth
century brought about a change in the attitude towards homosexual
offences. To punish sodomy with death, it was said, is atrocious; when
unconnected with violence, the law ought to take no notice of it at
all. It does not violate any other person’s right, its influence on
society is merely indirect like that of drunkenness and free love; it
is a disgusting vice, but its only punishment is contempt.<a
name="FnAnchor2373" href="#Footnote2373"><span
class="sp">2373</span></a> This view was adopted by the French ‘Code
pénal,’ according to which homosexual practices in private, between
two consenting adult parties, whether men or women,<a
name="FnAnchor2374" href="#Footnote2374"><span
class="sp">2374</span></a> are absolutely unpunished. The <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page374"></a>374</span> homosexual act is
treated as a crime only when it implies an outrage on public decency,
or when there is violence or absence of consent or when one of the
parties is under age or unable to give valid consent.<a
name="FnAnchor2375" href="#Footnote2375"><span
class="sp">2375</span></a> This method of dealing with homosexuality
has been followed especially by the legislators of the other Latin
countries in Europe and America (except Chile), as well as Russia;<a
name="FnAnchor2376" href="#Footnote2376"><span
class="sp">2376</span></a> and in other countries, where the law
treats the act in question <i>per se</i> as a penal offence, notably
in Germany, a vigorous propaganda in favour of its alteration has been
carried on with the support of many men of scientific eminence.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote2374"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor2374"><sup>2374</sup></a></span> For various reasons
the sexual abnormalities of women have attracted much less attention
than those of men. In Austria, however, they are punished by law; but
a proposal to the same effect which was made in Germany was rejected
(Moll, <i>Die conträre Sexualempfindung</i> [Berlin, 1891], p. 241
n.; <i>Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft</i>, ii [Bonn, 1915], p. 11
<i>sq.</i>, vii [1921], p. 112). Theodore’s ‘Penitential’ assigned a
penance of three years, to “a woman fornicating with a woman” (i. 2.
12, in F. W. H. Wasserschleben, <i>Die Bussordnungen der
abendländischen Kirche</i> [Halle, 1851], p. 186); but this was much
less than that prescribed for male homosexual practices (i. 2. 5, in
Wasserschleben, p. 185).</p></div>

<p>It is argued that the deterring effect of the law must be very
slight; this may be inferred not only from the great prevalence of
homosexual practices in countries where they are punishable
offences,<a name="FnAnchor2377" href="#Footnote2377"><span
class="sp">2377</span></a> but also from the fact that they are not
conspicuously more prevalent in those European countries where the law
takes no notice of them; the French call them “le vice allemand.”<a
name="FnAnchor2378" href="#Footnote2378"><span
class="sp">2378</span></a> That the punishment could exercise a
reformatory influence upon the offender by changing the nature of his
sexual desire, is entirely out of the question.<a name="FnAnchor2379"
href="#Footnote2379"><span class="sp">2379</span></a> Nor is it in the
least likely to repress its gratification by engendering moral
scruples; the prohibition may on the contrary, as in the case of
drink, stimulate the desire.<a name="FnAnchor2380"
href="#Footnote2380"><span class="sp">2380</span></a> Moreover, when
homosexuality is made a legal crime the door is opened wide to
blackmailers&mdash;a very serious <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page375"></a>375</span> objection.<a name="FnAnchor2381"
href="#Footnote2381"><span class="sp">2381</span></a> The answer to
this criticism has been that “the sound feelings of the people” insist
on punishing the offence.<a name="FnAnchor2382"

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote2377"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor2377"><sup>2377</sup></a></span> When in England a
Church Council in 1102 attempted to root out sodomy by decreeing that
any ecclesiastical person found guilty of it was to be degraded, and
that profligate, obstinate sodomites were to be struck with anathema,
the vice was so widespread that it had to be connived at (May,

Germany than in France. When Professor W. McDougall, in his book <i>An
Introduction to Social Psychology</i> (London, 1926), p. 357
<i>sq.</i>, on utilitarian grounds justifies the hardships inflicted
upon homosexuals by the present law of England, he must either be
ignorant of the frequency of homosexuality in this country or assume
that if the law were less draconic, it would be even much more
prevalent, indeed more prevalent than in any other European
country.</p></div>

<p>It seems to me obvious that the censure to which homosexual
intercourse as such is so frequently subject is, when uninfluenced by
any religious considerations, in the first place due to that feeling
of aversion or disgust which it tends to call forth in normally
constituted adult individuals, whose sexual instincts have developed
under normal conditions. This feeling tends to abate or disappear
where special circumstances, such as absence of the other sex, the
seclusion of women, or other facts, have given rise to widespread
homosexual practices; and in no case seem even the baser forms of
homosexuality to have led to anything like those drastic measures that
we find where the condemnation of them has been influenced by
religious beliefs. There are still to be mentioned other circumstances
that have affected the opinion about homosexuality in the Western
world. It is popularly supposed to be an abnormality of comparatively
few degenerate individuals. Only recent investigations have disclosed
the fact that it is found in a very considerable number of people of
either sex. In Germany, according to Hirschfeld, the proportion of
inverts are somewhat over 2 per cent. and that of bisexual persons 4
per cent.<a name="FnAnchor2383" href="#Footnote2383"><span
class="sp">2383</span></a> As to the prevalence of homosexuality in
France opinions vary, but Dr. Ellis maintains that it seems very
doubtful whether inborn inversion is in any considerable degree rarer
in France than in Germany. He also thinks we may probably conclude
that the proportion of inverts in England is the same as in other
related and neighbouring lands, that is to say, slightly over 2 per
cent., which would give the homosexual population of Great Britain as
somewhere about a million.<a name="FnAnchor2384"
href="#Footnote2384"><span class="sp">2384</span></a> All these
estimates must of course be hazardous, but they are much more likely
to be too low than too high; for homosexuals generally try to conceal
their proclivities, and often succeed in keeping them secret from
their acquaintances. We have much higher figures in answers given to
inquiries in America. Dr. Davis writes: “Slightly over 50 per cent. of
a group of 1,200 women college graduates, at least five years out of
college, state that they have experienced intense emotional relations
with other women, and that in slightly more than half these cases, or
26 per cent. of the entire group, the experience has <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page376"></a>376</span> been accompanied by
overt physical practices.”<a name="FnAnchor2385"
href="#Footnote2385"><span class="sp">2385</span></a> Of Dr.
Hamilton’s group of 100 married men and an equal number of married
women, 17 men and 26 women had indulged in homosexual episodes since

<p>Many of those persons may, of course, have been bisexual, that is,
persons attracted to both sexes. Bisexuality may merge imperceptibly
into real inversion, and on the other hand there may be a bisexual
strain in persons who are, or become, normally heterosexual; between
inversion and normal sexuality there are all shades of variation.
Indeed, scarcely any man is a hundred per cent. man, scarcely any
woman a hundred per cent. woman. As William James said, inversion is a
“kind of sexual appetite of which very likely most men possess the
germinal possibility.”<a name="FnAnchor2387"
href="#Footnote2387"><span class="sp">2387</span></a> Many
physiologists are nowadays of opinion that each sex contains the
latent characters of the other sex&mdash;in other words, is latently
hermaphrodite. Among mammals the male possesses useless nipples, which
occasionally even develop into breasts, and the female possesses a
clitoris, which is merely a rudimentary penis, and may also develop.
So, too, a homosexual tendency may be regarded as simply the psychical
manifestation of special characters of the other sex, susceptible of
being evolved under certain circumstances, such as may occur about the
age of puberty.<a name="FnAnchor2388" href="#Footnote2388"><span
class="sp">2388</span></a> Thus the sexual instinct of boys and girls
shows plain signs of a homosexual tendency, and is often more or less
undifferentiated.<a name="FnAnchor2389" href="#Footnote2389"><span
class="sp">2389</span></a> When facts of this kind become more
commonly known, they can scarcely fail to influence public opinion
about homosexuality.</p>

<p>The same may be said of some other findings of modern sex
psychology. Homosexuality is frequently looked upon as a sign of moral
degeneracy of a more general kind, but we now know that this is not
the case. All varieties of moral character are found among inverts,
just as among normal people; and it has been pointed out by Dr. Ellis
that among great moral leaders and persons with strong ethical
instincts there has been, and is to this day, in many cases a tendency
towards the more <span class="pagenum"><a id="page377"></a>377</span>
elevated forms of homosexual feeling. This feeling may be just as
refined as the heterosexual one. Indeed, for the ancient Greeks true
love was nearly always homosexual. Their lyric poets wrote practically
no love poems at all to women before Anacreon, and many of them,
perhaps all, were only written in old age. They seem to have regarded
woman as only an instrument of pleasure and the founder of the family.
Theognis compares marriage to cattle-breeding; Alcman, when he wishes
to be complimentary to the Spartan girls, speaks of them as his
“female boy-friends.”<a name="FnAnchor2390" href="#Footnote2390"><span
class="sp">2390</span></a> That homosexuality is remarkably common
among men of exceptional intellect was long ago noted by Dante, and
has often been noted since; but it is among artists that homosexuality
may most strikingly be traced.<a name="FnAnchor2391"

<p>While we may assume that a deepened insight into the nature of
homosexuality will make people somewhat more tolerant in their
attitude towards it, there is another factor that should affect the
moral judgment of homosexual practices. When the last residue of the
influence of antiquated religious ideas has vanished, normal persons
will still feel aversion to those practices, just as genuine inverts
often feel aversion to sexual connections with the other sex. But, as
I have said elsewhere,<a name="FnAnchor2392"
href="#Footnote2392"><span class="sp">2392</span></a> owing to the
very nature of the moral emotions, aversion cannot be regarded as an
adequate cause of moral censure by any one whose judgment is
sufficiently discriminate. To be called wrong an act must then be
productive of other harm than the mere aversion it causes, provided
that the agent has not in an indecent manner shocked any one’s
feelings. Any moral condemnation of homosexual practices (nobody can,
of course, be blamed on account of his abnormal desire) must be
founded on an opinion of their hurtfulness, individual or public,
whatever they may be. But thoughtful people will be on their guard
against the common tendency to seek a rational justification for
judgments springing merely from sentimental dislikes.</p>

<p>There is another kind of abnormal sex behaviour to which the public
attitude in Christian civilisation has been determined by ancient
Hebrew ideas, namely, bestiality. It was a Mosaic ordinance that in
the case of sexual intercourse between a man, or woman, and a
beast&mdash;which was evidently supposed to be productive of
offspring&mdash;the human offender and the beast as well were to be
put to death.<a name="FnAnchor2393" href="#Footnote2393"><span
class="sp">2393</span></a> In the Christian Penitentials <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page378"></a>378</span> bestiality was severely
condemned&mdash;nuns, in particular, were accused of it;<a
name="FnAnchor2394" href="#Footnote2394"><span
class="sp">2394</span></a> and when in England the temporal law took
jurisdiction over certain of the more outspoken sexual vices, it was,
like sodomy, made felony by Henry VIII.<a name="FnAnchor2395"
href="#Footnote2395"><span class="sp">2395</span></a> Moral philosophy
has also had something to say on the subject. According to Kant it is
a categorical imperative of practical reason that the man whose
offence has reduced him to the level of an animal should be expelled
from civil society and deprived of human rights, as he is unworthy to
be treated as a human being.<a name="FnAnchor2396"
href="#Footnote2396"><span class="sp">2396</span></a> Kant represents
this as a deduction from the general principle of requital (<i>jus
talionis</i>) which, if the punishment cannot be exactly equivalent to
the crime, requires equivalence according to the spirit of the law.
That principle, however, has obviously not a rational, but an entirely
emotional, foundation; and the same is the case with the moral
condemnation of bestiality, if unaffected by religion or superstition:
it is considered immoral because it provokes disgust. It is therefore
an opinion which nowadays is gaining ground that it should not be
punished at all.<a name="FnAnchor2397" href="#Footnote2397"><span

<h4>CHAPTER XIX</h4>
<h3>CHRISTIANITY AND THE REGARD FOR THE LOWER ANIMALS</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">I</span><span class="smcap">T</span> has been alleged in a review of a
recent book, in which Buddha and Christ are quoted as the highest
exemplars of the ideals of love, that “the author betrays either his
ignorance of the teaching of Jesus, or his prejudice against
Christianity, when he adds: ‘In Buddha one finds the more universal
sympathy, extending as it does to brute as well as to human life’; for
even if Jesus did not give specific instructions on the treatment of
animals, do not His references to God’s care for the flowers of the
field and the birds of the air, God’s knowledge of the fall of every
sparrow, the shepherd’s grief at the loss of one sheep, as an analogy
of God’s love for every sinner; the lifting of the ox or the ass out
of the pit on a Sabbath day, imply that universal sympathy?”<a
name="FnAnchor2398" href="#Footnote2398"><span
class="sp">2398</span></a> I do not see how these cases can be
compared at all with Buddha’s rules regarding the treatment of
animals. A disciple of his may not knowingly deprive any creature of
life, not even a worm or an ant; he may not drink water in which
animal life of any kind whatever is contained, nor pour it out on
grass or clay.<a name="FnAnchor2399" href="#Footnote2399"><span
class="sp">2399</span></a> And the doctrine which forbids the killing
of animate beings is not only professed, but in a large measure
followed, by the great majority of people in Buddhistic countries. In
Siam the tameness of many living creatures which in Europe fly from
the presence of man is very striking. Instances have been known in
which natives have quitted the service of Europeans on account of
their unwillingness to destroy reptiles and vermin, and it is a not
uncommon practice for rich Siamese to buy live fish to have the merit
of restoring them to the sea.<a name="FnAnchor2400"
href="#Footnote2400"><span class="sp">2400</span></a> In Burma, though
fish is one of the staple foods of the people, the fisherman is
despised; not so much, perhaps, as if he killed other living things,
but he is still an outcast from decent <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page380"></a>380</span> society, and “will have to suffer great
and terrible punishment before he can be cleansed from the sins that
he daily commits.”<a name="FnAnchor2401" href="#Footnote2401"><span
class="sp">2401</span></a> The Buddhists of Ceylon are more
forbearing: they excuse the fisherman by saying that he does not kill
the fish, but only removes it from the water.<a name="FnAnchor2402"
href="#Footnote2402"><span class="sp">2402</span></a> In Tibet all
dumb creatures are treated with humanity, and the taking of animal
life is rather strictly prohibited, except in the case of yaks and
sheep needed for food. Owing to the coldness of the climate, flesh
forms an essential staple of diet; but the butchers are regarded as
professional sinners and are therefore the most despised of all
classes in Tibet. Wild animals and even small birds and fish are
seldom or never killed, on account of the religious penalties attached
to this crime.<a name="FnAnchor2403" href="#Footnote2403"><span

<p>Great regard for the lower animal world is also found in other
Oriental religions. According to Brahmanism, tenderness towards all
creatures is a duty incumbent upon the four castes. It is said that
“he who injures innoxious beings from a wish to give himself pleasure,
never finds happiness, neither living nor dead.”<a name="FnAnchor2404"
href="#Footnote2404"><span class="sp">2404</span></a> If a blow is
struck against an animal in order to give it pain, the judge shall
inflict a fine in proportion to the amount of pain caused, just as if
the blow had been struck against a man.<a name="FnAnchor2405"
href="#Footnote2405"><span class="sp">2405</span></a> The killing of
various creatures, including fish and snakes, reduces the offender to
a mixed caste;<a name="FnAnchor2406" href="#Footnote2406"><span
class="sp">2406</span></a> and, according to the ‘Vishńu Puráńa,’
fishermen go after death to the same hell as awaits prisoners,
incendiaries, and treacherous friends.<a name="FnAnchor2407"
href="#Footnote2407"><span class="sp">2407</span></a> To kill a cow is
a great crime;<a name="FnAnchor2408" href="#Footnote2408"><span

name="FnAnchor2409" href="#Footnote2409"><span
class="sp">2409</span></a> Among many of the Hindus the slaughter of a
cow excites more horror than the killing of a man, and is punished
with great severity, even with death.<a name="FnAnchor2410"

<p>The Jain is even stricter than the Buddhist in his regard for <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page381"></a>381</span> animal life. He sweeps
the ground before him as he goes, lest animate things be destroyed; he
walks veiled, lest he inhale a living organism; he considers that the
evening and night are not times for eating, since one might then
swallow a live thing by mistake; and he rejects not only meat but even
honey, together with various fruits that are supposed to contain
worms, not because of his distaste for worms but because of his regard
for life.<a name="FnAnchor2411" href="#Footnote2411"><span
class="sp">2411</span></a> Some towns in Western India in which Jains
are found have their beast hospitals, where animals are kept and fed.
At Surat there was quite recently an establishment of this sort with a
house where a host of noxious and offensive vermin, dense as the sands
on the seashore, were bred and nurtured; and at Anjár, in Kutch, about
five thousand rats were kept in a certain temple and daily fed with
flour, which was procured by a tax on the inhabitants of the town.<a

<p>According to the ‘Thâi-Shang,’ one of the books of Taoism, a good
man will feel kindly towards all creatures, and refrain from hurting
even the insect tribes, grass, and trees; and he is a bad man who
“shoots birds and hunts beasts, unearths the burrowing insects and
frightens roosting birds, blocks up the dens of animals and overturns
nests, hurts the pregnant womb and breaks eggs.”<a name="FnAnchor2413"
href="#Footnote2413"><span class="sp">2413</span></a> In the book
called ‘Merits and Errors Scrutinised,’ which enjoys great popularity
in China, it is said to be meritorious to save animals from
death&mdash;even insects if the number amounts to a hundred&mdash;to
relieve a brute that is greatly wearied with work, to purchase and set
at liberty animals intended to be slaughtered. On the other hand, to
confine birds in a cage, to kill ten insects, to be unsparing of the
strength of tired animals, to disturb insects in their holes, to
destroy the nests of birds, without great reason to kill and dress
animals for food, are all errors of various degrees. And “to be the
foremost to encourage the slaughter of animals, or to hinder persons
from setting them at liberty,” is regarded as an error of the same
magnitude as the crime of devising a person’s death or of drowning or
murdering a child.<a name="FnAnchor2414" href="#Footnote2414"><span

<p>The regard for the lower animals which is shown by those Eastern
religions and their adherents is to some extent due to superstitious
ideas, similar to those which are found among many savages.<a
name="FnAnchor2418" href="#Footnote2418"><span
class="sp">2418</span></a> Thus Dr. de Groot observes that in China
the virtues of benevolence and humanity are extended to animals
because these, also, have souls which may work vengeance or bring
reward.<a name="FnAnchor2419" href="#Footnote2419"><span
class="sp">2419</span></a> The conduct of Orientals towards the brute
creation has further been explained by their belief in the
transmigration of souls. But it seems that the connection between
their theory of metempsychosis and their rules relating to the
treatment of animals is not exclusively, nor even chiefly, one of
cause and effect, but rather one of a common origin. This theory
itself may in some measure be regarded as a result of that intimacy
which prevails in the East between animals and men. Buddhism
recognises no fundamental distinction between them, only an accidental
or phenomenal difference;<a name="FnAnchor2420"
href="#Footnote2420"><span class="sp">2420</span></a> and the step is
not long from this attitude to the doctrine of metempsychosis. Captain
Forbes maintains that the humanity with which the Burmans treat dumb
animals comes “more from the innate good nature and easiness of their
dispositions than from any effect over them of this peculiar
doctrine”;<a name="FnAnchor2421" href="#Footnote2421"><span
class="sp">2421</span></a> and we are told that they laugh at the
suggestion made by Europeans that Buddhists abstain from taking life
because they believe in the transmigration of souls, having never
heard of it before. Their motive, says Fielding Hall, is compassion
and <i>noblesse oblige</i>.<a name="FnAnchor2422"
href="#Footnote2422"><span class="sp">2422</span></a> But by its
punishments and rewards, religion has no doubt greatly increased the
natural regard for animal life and welfare, and introduced a new
motive for conduct which originally sprang in the main from kindly
feeling.</p>

<p>In Zoroastrianism we meet with a different attitude towards the
lower animal world. A fundamental distinction is made between the
animals of Ormuzd and those of Ahriman. To kill one of the former is a
heinous sin, to kill one of the latter a pious <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page383"></a>383</span> deed.<a
name="FnAnchor2423" href="#Footnote2423"><span
class="sp">2423</span></a> Sacred above all other animals is the dog.
The ill-feeding and maltreatment of dogs are prosecuted as criminal,
and extreme penalties are inflicted on those who venture to kill
them.<a name="FnAnchor2424" href="#Footnote2424"><span
class="sp">2424</span></a> Nay, if there be in the house of a
worshipper of Mazda a mad dog that has no scent, the worshippers of
Mazda “shall attend him to heal him, in the same manner as they would
do for one of the faithful.”<a name="FnAnchor2425"
href="#Footnote2425"><span class="sp">2425</span></a> In the eyes of
the Parsis, animals are enlisted under the standards of either Ormuzd
or Ahriman according as they are useful or hurtful to man; but
Darmesteter is of opinion that they originally belonged to the one or
the other not on account of any such qualities, but according as they
chanced to have lent their forms to either the god or the fiend in the
storm tales. “It was not animal psychology,” he says, “that disguised
gods and fiends as dogs, otters, hedge-hogs, and cocks, or as snakes,
tortoises, frogs, and ants, but the accidents of physical qualities
and the caprice of popular fancy, as both the god and the fiend might
be compared with, and transformed into, any object, the idea of which
was suggested by the uproar of the storm, the blazing of the
lightning, the streaming of the water, or the hue and shape of the
clouds.”<a name="FnAnchor2426" href="#Footnote2426"><span
class="sp">2426</span></a> This hypothesis seems to attach excessive
importance to mythical fancies, and presupposes an almost unbounded
and capricious allegorism, for which there is apparently little
foundation in fact. The suggestion that the animals are referred to
either the one or the other category according as they are useful or
obnoxious to man, is at all events borne out by a few salient
features, although in many details the matter remains obscure.</p>

<p>It appears that among the Zoroastrians, also, the respect for the
life of animals is partly due to superstitious ideas about their souls
and fear of their revenge. In one of the Pahlavi texts it is said that
people should abstain from unlawfully slaughtering any species of
animals, since otherwise, in punishment for such an act, each hair of
the animal killed becomes like a sharp dagger, and he who is
unlawfully a slaughterer is slain.<a name="FnAnchor2427"
href="#Footnote2427"><span class="sp">2427</span></a> But here again
we may assume the co-operating influence of the feeling of sympathy.
Various passages in the Zoroastrian ‘Gathas’ which <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page384"></a>384</span> enjoin kindness to
domestic animals<a name="FnAnchor2428" href="#Footnote2428"><span
class="sp">2428</span></a> suggest as their motives not only
considerations of utility but genuine tenderness. In a later age
Firdausi sang, “Ah! spare yon emmet rich in hoarded grain: He lives
with pleasure, and he dies with pain.”<a name="FnAnchor2429"
href="#Footnote2429"><span class="sp">2429</span></a> Of the modern
Persian, Polak says that, “naturally not cruel, he treats animals with
more consideration than men.”<a name="FnAnchor2430"
href="#Footnote2430"><span class="sp">2430</span></a> His present
religion, too, enjoins kindness to animals as a duty.</p>

<p>According to Islam beasts, birds, fish, insects, are all, like man,
the slaves of God, the tools of his will. There is no intrinsic
distinction between them and the human species, except what accidental
diversity God may have been pleased to make.<a name="FnAnchor2431"
href="#Footnote2431"><span class="sp">2431</span></a> Mohammed said to
his followers: “There is not a beast upon the earth nor a bird that
flies with both its wings, but is a nation like to you; to their Lord
shall they be gathered.”<a name="FnAnchor2432"

prescribes that domestic animals shall be treated with consideration
and not to be overworked;<a name="FnAnchor2433"
href="#Footnote2433"><span class="sp">2433</span></a> and in various

practice. The Moslems of India have been represented as kind to
animals.<a name="FnAnchor2434" href="#Footnote2434"><span

<p>So also the ancient Greeks were on familiar terms with the animal
world. This appears from the frequency with which <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page385"></a>385</span> their poets illustrate
human qualities by metaphors drawn from it. And as men were compared
with animals, so animals were believed to possess human peculiarities.
When a beast was going to be sacrificed it had to give its consent to
the act by a nod of the head before it was killed.<a
name="FnAnchor2438" href="#Footnote2438"><span
class="sp">2438</span></a> Animals were held in some measure
responsible for their deeds; they were tried for manslaughter,
sentenced, and executed.<a name="FnAnchor2439"
href="#Footnote2439"><span class="sp">2439</span></a> On the other
hand, honours were bestowed upon beasts which had rendered signal
services to their masters. The graves of Cimon’s mares with which he
three times conquered at the Olympic games were still in the days of
Plutarch to be seen near his own tomb;<a name="FnAnchor2440"
href="#Footnote2440"><span class="sp">2440</span></a> and a certain
Xanthippus honoured his dog by burying it on a promontory, since then
called “the dog’s grave,” because when the Athenians were compelled to
abandon their city it swam by the side of his galley to Salamis.<a
name="FnAnchor2441" href="#Footnote2441"><span
class="sp">2441</span></a> According to Xenocrates, there were in
existence at Eleusis three laws which had been made by an ancient
legislator, namely: “Honour your parents,” “Sacrifice to the gods from
the fruits of the earth,” and “Injure not animals.”<a
name="FnAnchor2442" href="#Footnote2442"><span
class="sp">2442</span></a> The Areopagites once condemned a boy to
death because he had picked out the eyes of some quails.<a
name="FnAnchor2443" href="#Footnote2443"><span
class="sp">2443</span></a> At Athens and in Peloponnesus the slaughter
of a labouring ox was prohibited even on penalty of death;<a
name="FnAnchor2444" href="#Footnote2444"><span
class="sp">2444</span></a> and young animals in particular were
believed to be under the protection of the gods.<a name="FnAnchor2445"
href="#Footnote2445"><span class="sp">2445</span></a> An ancient
proverb says that “there are Erinyes even for dogs.”<a
name="FnAnchor2446" href="#Footnote2446"><span
class="sp">2446</span></a> This seems to indicate that the Greeks,
also, were influenced by the common notion that the soul of an animal
may take revenge upon him who killed it, the Erinys of the slain
animal being originally its persecuting ghost. Among the Pythagoreans,
again, the rule that animals which are not obnoxious to the human race
should be neither injured nor killed<a name="FnAnchor2447"
href="#Footnote2447"><span class="sp">2447</span></a> was connected
with their theory of metempsychosis;<a name="FnAnchor2448"
href="#Footnote2448"><span class="sp">2448</span></a> and in some
cases the prohibition of slaying useful animals may be traced to
utilitarian motives.<a name="FnAnchor2449" href="#Footnote2449"><span
class="sp">2449</span></a> But both in Greece and Rome kindness to
brutes was also inculcated for their own sake, on <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page386"></a>386</span> purely humanitarian
grounds. Porphyry says that, as justice pertains to rational beings
and animals have been proved to be possessed of reason, it is
necessary that we should act justly towards them.<a
name="FnAnchor2450" href="#Footnote2450"><span
class="sp">2450</span></a> He adds that “he who does not restrict
harmless conduct to man alone, but extends it to other animals, most
closely approaches to divinity; and if it were possible to extend it
to plants, he would preserve this image in a still greater degree.”<a
name="FnAnchor2451" href="#Footnote2451"><span
class="sp">2451</span></a> According to Plutarch kindness and
beneficence to creatures of every species flow from the breast of a
well-natured man as streams that issue from the living fountain. We
ought to take care of our dogs and horses not only when they are
young, but also when they are old and past service.<a
name="FnAnchor2452" href="#Footnote2452"><span
class="sp">2452</span></a> We ought not to violate or kill anything
whatsoever that has life, unless it hurts us first.<a
name="FnAnchor2453" href="#Footnote2453"><span
class="sp">2453</span></a> And if we cannot live unblamably we should
at least sin with discretion: when we kill an animal in order to
satisfy our hunger we should do so with sorrow and pity, without
abusing and tormenting it.<a name="FnAnchor2454"
href="#Footnote2454"><span class="sp">2454</span></a> Cicero says it
is a crime to injure an animal.<a name="FnAnchor2455"
href="#Footnote2455"><span class="sp">2455</span></a> And Marcus
Aurelius enjoins man to make use of brutes with a generous and liberal
spirit, since he has reason and they have not.<a name="FnAnchor2456"

<p>In the Old Testament we meet with several instances of kindly
feeling towards animals.<a name="FnAnchor2457"
href="#Footnote2457"><span class="sp">2457</span></a> God watches over
and controls the sustenance of their life. He sends springs into the
valleys which will give drink to every beast of the field. He gives
nests to the birds of the heaven, which sing among the branches. He
causes grass to grow for the cattle; and the young lions, roaring
after their prey, seek their food from God.<a name="FnAnchor2458"
href="#Footnote2458"><span class="sp">2458</span></a> While the Jews,
as Professor Toy observes, found it hard to conceive of the God of
Israel as thinking kindly of its enemies, they had no such feeling of
hostility towards beasts and birds.<a name="FnAnchor2459"
href="#Footnote2459"><span class="sp">2459</span></a> But at the same
time various passages which are often quoted as instances of
tenderness towards animals allow of another and more natural
interpretation; this is particularly the case with the Sabbatarian
injunctions referring to domestic animals. Man is the centre of the
creation, a being set apart from all other sentient creatures as God’s
special favourite, for whose sake everything else was <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page387"></a>387</span> brought into existence.
The sun, the moon, and the stars were placed in the firmament of the
heaven to give light upon the estate of man.<a name="FnAnchor2460"
href="#Footnote2460"><span class="sp">2460</span></a> For his
sustenance the fruits of the earth were made to grow, and to him was

and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.<a

him.<a name="FnAnchor2462" href="#Footnote2462"><span

<p>Like the sayings of the Psalmist about the care which God takes of
his creatures, those of Jesus likewise express tenderness of feeling.
But when he speaks of the sparrows which are not forgotten by God, he
does it to comfort his disciples: “Ye are of more value than many
sparrows.”<a name="FnAnchor2463" href="#Footnote2463"><span
class="sp">2463</span></a> And when he speaks of the fowls of the air
which neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns but are fed by God,
he does it as a warning that they shall take no thought for the
morrow: “Are ye not much better than they?”<a name="FnAnchor2464"
href="#Footnote2464"><span class="sp">2464</span></a> When Jesus asked
the Pharisees, “Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a
pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath?”<a
name="FnAnchor2465" href="#Footnote2465"><span
class="sp">2465</span></a> the motive for doing so may not merely be
sympathy for the animal. The only occasion on which Jesus is reported
to have had anything directly to do with animals was when he was
besought by the devils whom he cast out of a man possessed with them
to send them into a herd of swine feeding in the neighbourhood.
“Forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out,
and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep
place into the sea (they were about two thousand), and were choked in
the sea.”<a name="FnAnchor2466" href="#Footnote2466"><span

swine.</p>

<p>Among the Hebrews the harshness of the anthropocentric doctrine was
somewhat mitigated by the sympathy which a simple pastoral and
agricultural people naturally feels for its domestic animals. In
Christianity, on the other hand, it was further strengthened by the
exclusive importance which was attached to the spiritual salvation of
man. He was now more than ever separated from the rest of sentient
beings. Even his own animal nature was regarded with contempt, the
immortality of his soul being the only object of religious interest.
“It would seem,” says Dr. Arnold, “as if the primitive Christian, by
laying so <span class="pagenum"><a id="page388"></a>388</span> much
stress upon a future life in contradistinction to this life, and
placing the lower creatures out of the pale of hope, placed them at
the same time out of the pale of sympathy, and thus laid the
foundation for this utter disregard of animals in the light of our
fellow-creatures.”<a name="FnAnchor2467" href="#Footnote2467"><span

<p>No creed in Christendom teaches kindness to animals as a dogma of
religion.<a name="FnAnchor2469" href="#Footnote2469"><span
class="sp">2469</span></a> In the Middle Ages various Councils of the
Church declared hunting unlawful for the clergy;<a name="FnAnchor2470"
href="#Footnote2470"><span class="sp">2470</span></a> but the obvious
reason for this prohibition was her horror of bloodshed,<a
name="FnAnchor2471" href="#Footnote2471"><span
class="sp">2471</span></a> not any consideration for the animals. Mr.
Mauleverer in Sir Arthur Helps’ ‘Talk about Animals and their
Masters,’ says: “Upon a moderate calculation, I think I have heard, in
my time, 1,320 sermons; and I do not recollect that in any one of them
I ever heard the slightest allusion made to the conduct of men towards
animals.”<a name="FnAnchor2472" href="#Footnote2472"><span
class="sp">2472</span></a> Indeed, “blood-sports” have not only been
allowed to pass without any pulpit protest, but evidence appears in
the press and on public platforms from time to time of the strong
support given to the practice of such sports by ministers of different
religious denominations. In a correspondence on the ethics of hunting
to which the <i>Western Mail</i> some time ago opened its columns, the
Rev. J. Price claimed that “man possesses divine authority for killing
for sport. . . . Some men and women suffer and die for the life, the
welfare, the happiness of others. This law is continually seen in
operation. The supreme example of it was shown to the world (I write
with reverence) on Calvary (<i>sic</i>). Why should animals be
exempted from the operation of this law or principle?”<a
name="FnAnchor2473" href="#Footnote2473"><span
class="sp">2473</span></a> A well-known Christian moralist, Dr. T.
Fowler, thinks fox-hunting may be justified on the ground that the
amount of suffering inflicted on the fox in addition to that which
would be caused by killing it instantaneously is far more than
counterbalanced by <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page389"></a>389</span> the beneficial effects, in health and
enjoyment, to the hunter.<a name="FnAnchor2474"
href="#Footnote2474"><span class="sp">2474</span></a> We are sometimes
told that “the fox enjoys the hunt, too,” or that it has “free chances
of escape”<a name="FnAnchor2475" href="#Footnote2475"><span
class="sp">2475</span></a>&mdash;which would be an excellent: argument
if we shared the North American Indian’s conviction that an animal can
never be killed without its own permission. The kindest words which
from a Protestant view have been said about animals seem to have come
from sectarians, Quakers and Methodists.<a name="FnAnchor2476"
href="#Footnote2476"><span class="sp">2476</span></a> Roman Catholic
writers have taken pains to show that animals are entirely destitute
of rights. Brute beasts, says Father Rickaby, cannot have any rights
because they have no understanding and therefore are not persons. We
have no duties of any kind to them, as neither to sticks nor stones;
we have only duties <em>about</em> them. We must not harm them when they
are our neighbour’s property, we must not vex and annoy them
<em>for</em> sport, because it disposes him who does so to inhumanity
towards his own species. But there is no shadow of evil resting on the
practice of causing pain to brutes <em>in</em> sport, where the pain is
not the sport itself, but an incidental concomitant of it. Much more
in all that conduces to the sustenance of man may we give pain to
animals, and we are not “bound to any anxious care to make this pain
as little as may be. Brutes are as <em>things</em> in our regard; so far
as they are useful to us, they exist for us, not for themselves; and
we do right in using them unsparingly for our need and convenience,
though not for our wantonness.”<a name="FnAnchor2477"
href="#Footnote2477"><span class="sp">2477</span></a> According to
another modern Catholic writer the infliction of suffering upon an
animal is not only justifiable, but a duty, “when it confers a
certain, a solid good, however small, on the spiritual nature of
man.”<a name="FnAnchor2478" href="#Footnote2478"><span
class="sp">2478</span></a> Pope Pius IX. refused a request for
permission to form in Rome a Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals on the professed ground that it was a theological error to
suppose that man owes any duty to an animal.<a name="FnAnchor2479"

<p>Indifference to animal suffering has been a characteristic of
public opinion in Christian Europe up to quite modern times. In his
‘Essay on Humanity to Animals,’ published in 1798, Thomas Young
declared that he was sensible of laying himself open to no small
portion of ridicule in offering to the public a book on such a
subject.<a name="FnAnchor2485" href="#Footnote2485"><span
class="sp">2485</span></a> Till the end of the eighteenth century and
even later cock-fighting was a very general amusement among the
English and Scotch, entering into the occupations of both the old and
young. Travellers agreed with coachmen that they were to wait a night
if there was a cock-fight in any town through which they passed.
Schools had their cock-fights; on Shrove Tuesday, every youth took to
the village schoolroom a cock reared for his special use, and the
schoolmaster presided at the conflict.<a name="FnAnchor2486"
href="#Footnote2486"><span class="sp">2486</span></a> Those who felt
that the practice required some excuse found it <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page391"></a>391</span> in the idea that the
race was to suffer this annual barbarity by way of punishment for St.
Peter’s crime;<a name="FnAnchor2487" href="#Footnote2487"><span
class="sp">2487</span></a> but the number of people who had any
scruples about the game cannot have been great considering that even
such a strong advocate of humanity to animals as John Lawrence had no
decided antipathy to it.<a name="FnAnchor2488"
href="#Footnote2488"><span class="sp">2488</span></a> Other pastimes
indulged in were dog-fighting, bull-baiting, and badger-baiting; and
in the middle of the eighteenth century the bear-garden was described
by Lord Kames as one of the chief entertainments of the English,
though it was held in abhorrence by the French and “other polite
nations,” being too savage an amusement to be relished by those of a
refined taste.<a name="FnAnchor2489" href="#Footnote2489"><span
class="sp">2489</span></a> As late as 1824 Sir Robert (then Mr.) Peel
argued strongly against the legal prohibition of bull-baiting.<a

which prevented cruel and improper treatment of cattle.<a

<p>Whatever be the professed motives of legislators for preventing
cruelty to animals, there can be no doubt that the laws against it are
chiefly due to a keener and more generally felt sympathy with their
sufferings. The actual feelings of men have been somewhat more tender
than the theories of law, philosophy, and religion. The
anthropocentric exclusiveness of Christianity was from ancient times
to some extent counterbalanced by popular sentiments and beliefs. In
the folk-tales of Europe man is not placed in an isolated and unique
position in the universe. He lives in intimate and friendly
intercourse <span class="pagenum"><a id="page392"></a>392</span> with
the animals round him, attributes to them human qualities, and regards
them with mercy.<a name="FnAnchor2495" href="#Footnote2495"><span
class="sp">2495</span></a> Tender feelings towards the brute creation
are also displayed in many legends of saints.<a name="FnAnchor2496"
href="#Footnote2496"><span class="sp">2496</span></a> St. Francis of
Assisi talked with the birds and called them “brother birds” or
“little sister swallows,” and was seen employed in removing worms from
the road that they might not be trampled by travellers.<a
name="FnAnchor2497" href="#Footnote2497"><span
class="sp">2497</span></a> John Moschus speaks of a certain abbot who
early in the morning not only used to give food to all the dogs in the
monastery, but would bring corn to the ants and to the birds on the
roof.<a name="FnAnchor2498" href="#Footnote2498"><span
class="sp">2498</span></a> In the ‘Revelations of St. Bridget,’ we
read: “Let a man fear, above all, me, his God, and so much the gentler
will he become towards my creatures and animals, on whom, on account
of me, their Creator, he ought to have compassion.”<a
name="FnAnchor2499" href="#Footnote2499"><span
class="sp">2499</span></a> Many kind words about animals have come
from poets and thinkers. Montaigne says that he never has been able to
see without affliction an innocent beast, which is without defence and
from which we receive no offence, pursued and killed.<a
name="FnAnchor2500" href="#Footnote2500"><span
class="sp">2500</span></a> Shakespeare points out that “the poor
beetle that we tread upon, in corporal sufferance finds a pang as
great as when a giant dies.”<a name="FnAnchor2501"
href="#Footnote2501"><span class="sp">2501</span></a> Mandeville
thinks that if it was not for that tyranny which custom usurps over
us, no men of any tolerable good-nature could ever be reconciled to
the killing of so many animals for their daily food, as long as the
bountiful earth so plentifully provides them with varieties of
vegetable dainties.<a name="FnAnchor2502" href="#Footnote2502"><span
class="sp">2502</span></a> Towards the end of the eighteenth century
Bentham wrote: “Men must be permitted to kill animals; but they should
be forbidden to torment them. Artificial death may be rendered less
painful than natural death by simple processes, well worth the trouble
of being studied, and of becoming an object of police. Why should the
law refuse its protection to any sensitive being? A time will come
when humanity will spread its mantle over everything that breathes.
The lot of slaves has begun to excite pity; we shall end by softening
the lot of the animals which <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page393"></a>393</span> labour for us and supply our wants.”<a
name="FnAnchor2503" href="#Footnote2503"><span
class="sp">2503</span></a> In the course of the nineteenth century
humanity to animals, from being conspicuous in a few individuals only,
became the keynote of a movement gradually increasing in strength.</p>

<p>In an essay on ‘The Christian Ideal and some of its Competitors,’
Mr. Harvey observes that it is humiliating to recognise how much of
the advance towards a more humane attitude to the animal world has
been due “not to the direct challenge of any Christian Church, but to
the patient educative work of reformers professing no allegiance to
Christianity.”<a name="FnAnchor2504" href="#Footnote2504"><span
class="sp">2504</span></a> One reason for this may be the decline of
the anthropocentric doctrine and the influence of another theory,
which regards man not as an image of the deity separated from the
lower animals by a special act of creation, but as a being generally
akin to them, and only representing a higher stage in the scale of
mental evolution. But apart from any theory as regards human origins,
growing reflection has taught men to be more considerate in their
treatment of animals by producing a more vivid idea of their
sufferings. Human thoughtlessness has been responsible for much
needless pain to which they have been subjected. And in spite of some
improvement it is so still.</p>

<i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>At the same time the movement advocating greater humanity to
animals is itself not altogether free from inconsistencies and a
certain lack of discrimination. The extreme views on the question, how
far the happiness of the lower animals may be justly sacrificed for
the benefit of man, may be somewhat modified on the one hand by a more
vivid representation of animal suffering, and on the other hand by the
recognition of certain facts, often overlooked, which make it
unreasonable to regard conduct towards dumb creatures in exactly the
same light as conduct towards men. It should especially be remembered
that the former have none of those long-protracted anticipations of
future misery or death which we have. If they are destined to serve as
meat they are not aware of it; whereas many domestic animals never
would have come into existence and been able to enjoy what appears a
very happy life, but for the purpose of being used as food. But though
greater intellectual discrimination may somewhat lessen the
divergencies of moral opinion on the subject, nothing like unanimity
can be expected, for the simple reason that moral judgments are
ultimately based on emotions, and sympathy with the animal world is a
feeling which varies extremely in different individuals.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XX</h4>
<h3>SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS</h3>
<p class="noind"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="smcap">HERE</span> would have been no Paul without
Christ, but there would have been no Christianity without Paul. The
new faith would, no doubt, have merely remained the religion of a
Jewish sect destined to pine away, if Paul had not rescued it for
history, and made it a religion of the world. He did this by
transforming its character. Jesus had taught, in the Sermon on the
Mount, that the salvation of any man depended on his own moral
conduct, and that the way which led to the kingdom of God was anything
but easy. According to Paul, future life was the result of a divine
work of redemption, which prepared the salvation for mankind once for
all through the death and resurrection of Christ and faith. Christian
theologians often tell us that there is no essential difference
between the teaching of Jesus and that of Paul. But from the moral
point of view the difference is radical.</p>
<p>I have tried to show that the ethics of Jesus were expressions of
his moral emotions, and that these were in general agreement with the
nature of such emotions when guided by sufficient sympathy and
discrimination. This is proved by the great similarities between the
teaching of Jesus and that of the world’s other great moralists. Moral
emotions are disinterested retributive emotions. Personal anger and
vindictiveness are strongly condemned by Jesus; and the injunctions of
forgiveness and kindness to enemies are also found in the Old
Testament and other Jewish writings, in the Koran and the Mohammedan
traditions, in Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Chinese ethics; and the
principle of forgiveness had advocates in Greece and Rome, as well,
the condemnation of anger and resentment being particularly abundant
in Stoicism. Quite different from the resentment and retaliation
springing from personal motives are moral resentment and the
punishment in which it finds expression. These vary indefinitely. The
moral indignation of Jesus is often intense, and the future punishment
he assigns to unrepentant sinners enormous. This is an unsurmountable
stumbling-block for those who insist on the objectivity of the rules
of Christian ethics. Nowadays Christians are shocked by <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page395"></a>395</span> the ancient doctrine of
hell and make vain attempts to explain it away. But side by side with
the doctrine of retribution there is in the gospels the message of
forgiveness for the repentant sinner. That repentance is followed by
forgiveness is also found in other religions, such as Judaism,
Zoroastrianism, Brahmanism, and the Vedic religion. But repentance not
only blunts the edge of moral indignation and recommends the offender
to mercy: it is also the sole ground on which pardon can be given by a
scrupulous judge. When sufficiently guided by deliberation and left to
itself without being unduly checked by other emotions, the feeling of
moral resentment is apt to last as long as its cause remains
unaltered, that is, until the will of the offender has ceased to be
offensive; and it ceases to be so only when he acknowledges his guilt
and repents. That moral indignation is appeased by repentance, and
that repentance is the only proper ground for forgiveness, however, is
due, not to the specifically moral character of such indignation, but
to its being a form of resentment. This is confirmed by the fact that
an angry and revengeful man is apt to be influenced in a similar way
by the sincere repentance of the offender.</p>
<p>While Jesus was capable of feeling intense moral indignation, his
emotion of moral approval, of which moral praise or reward is the
outward manifestation, plays a no less prominent part in his teaching,
as is shown by the innumerable cases in which eternal reward is
promised for righteousness. Does this imply that Jesus considered hope
of reward as an adequate reason for receiving it? We do not feel the
emotion of moral approval or retributive kindliness towards a person
if we recognise that he does something merely in the selfish hope of
being benefited by it; and, like all great moralists, Jesus certainly
laid stress on the motives of conduct, on inwardness and purity of
heart. But there is no inconsistency between benevolence being the
immediate spring of action and the hope of reward being an ultimate
motive for it: a person may aim at his own happiness as his ultimate
end and at the same time aim sincerely at the happiness of his
neighbour as a means to that end. The desire to gain divine favour
with everything implied in it must certainly have been regarded by
Jesus as a right motive for our conduct.</p>
<p>While Jesus’ doctrine of punishment and reward is an outcome of the
retributive character of the moral emotions, his teaching also
emphasises that disinterestedness which distinguishes them from other,
non-moral, retributive emotions. This he does in his enunciation of
“the Golden Rule,” which, also, is much older than Christianity, and,
especially in its <span class="pagenum"><a id="page396"></a>396</span>
negative form, widespread. The disinterestedness of the moral
emotions, moreover, partly underlies the rule, “Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself,” which occurs both in the Old Testament and in
the three synoptic gospels. But this maxim contains much more than the
disinterestedness of the conception of duty. When a person pronounces
an act right or wrong, it implies that it is so, <i>ceteris
paribus</i>, whether he does it to another or another does it to him;
but this has nothing to do with the particular nature of the act. When
my own interests clash with those of my neighbour, I may have the
right to prefer my own lesser good to the greater good of another, but
only on condition that the other person also, in similar
circumstances, is admitted to have the right to prefer his own lesser
good to my greater good. No such right to prefer one’s own lesser good
to the greater good of another is recognised in the precept, “Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself”; but this precept owes its origin
to the strength of the altruistic sentiment in him who laid down the
rule, and not merely to the disinterestedness of his moral emotions.
It is another instance of the relative validity of our moral
judgments; and so are moral rules relating to different groups of
neighbours. They vary indefinitely because the altruistic sentiment
varies in expanse as well as in strength. The impartiality of my moral
emotions does not prevent me from promoting the welfare of my own
family or country in preference to that of other families or
countries; but it tells me that I must allow anybody else to show a
similar preference for <em>his</em> family or country. Among the positive
duties resulting from benevolence almsgiving holds a very prominent
position in the teaching of Jesus, as it did in Judaism and
particularly in the Old Testament apocrypha and in rabbinical
literature.</p>
<p>While his ethics were an expression of intense moral emotions in
which both the retributive and the altruistic elements came out very
prominently, specific religious and eschatological beliefs were
blended with the ideas springing from those emotions. Our duties to
neighbours were founded upon our submission to the will of God, and
their sanctions were rewards or penalties for obedience or
disobedience to his commandments. But those beliefs did not
essentially alter the contents of those commandments, as is testified
by the innumerable parallels between the teaching of Jesus and that of
other great moralists. We also find that certain doctrines which had
crept into the moral system of the Jews from their religion, but were
alien to the emotional origin of morals, were opposed by Jesus, as was
the case with his attitude towards the sabbath.</p>
<p>Among the sayings of Jesus there are injunctions which <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page397"></a>397</span> cannot be meant to be
obeyed literally, but are more or less paradoxical, in conformity to
the Oriental habit of speaking in proverbs, which stress one side of a
case to the exclusion of every other. We must also remember that much
of his teaching was conditioned by his belief that the End was at
hand; and least of all must we expect his sayings to be applicable to
the circumstances of modern life. It may, moreover, be said that Jesus
himself somewhat modified his teaching by recognising the existing
institutions of the State. There is no hint that he wanted soldiers to
abandon their profession, or that he regarded this profession as
wrong; his attitude towards the centurion whose servant was sick of
the palsy was altogether friendly. And when the Pharisees tried to
entangle him in his talk, he told them that they should render unto
Cæsar the things which were Cæsar’s, and unto God the things that were
God’s. This helped Luther to find a compromise between what we should
do as members of the kingdom of God and as members of the kingdom of
Cæsar.<a name="FnAnchor2505" href="#Footnote2505"><span
class="sp">2505</span></a> Roman Catholicism had found another way of
softening the severity of the Sermon on the Mount. The harder sayings
came to be reckoned as counsels of perfection, the observance of which
implied that the performer did more than was required for his own
salvation.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote2505"></a><a

<i>sqq.</i></p></div>

<p>While Jesus was a moralist, Paul was in the first place a
theologian. Faith is the keystone of his teaching, faith in the
redemption through the crucified and risen Christ. He never speaks of
Jesus, as a teacher or of his teaching, he extremely seldom appeals to
any words of Jesus as a moral norm, he never refers to his example in
any concrete situation. “A man is justified by faith without the deeds
of the law”; “To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”
Whatever else Paul’s conception of faith may imply, it presupposes in
the first place the intellectual acceptance of some fact as true; and
such a belief cannot be a proper object of moral judgment. But even if
the sin of unbelief, as Thomas Aquinas argues, has its cause in the
will because it consists in “contrary opposition to the faith, whereby
one stands out against the hearing of the faith,” it could not be
imputed to anybody who never heard of the faith. Moreover, the faith
itself is a gift of. God: “God hath dealt to every man the measure of
faith.” Salvation depends on an “election of grace”: God “hath mercy
on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.” Yet there
is some reason for his mercy. Those who believe are justified by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page398"></a>398</span> grace of God
“through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set
forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the
forbearance of God.” Christ “died for all, that they which live should
not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them,
and rose again.” “Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.” It is
thus by the vicarious suffering of Jesus that the wrath of God,
aroused by the sin of men, is appeased. “As by one man sin entered
into the world, and death by sin,” and “as by the offence of one
judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the
righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto
justification of life.”</p>
<p>The idea that all mankind are doomed to death on account of Adam’s
sin, which Paul had imbibed from his Jewish upbringing, is explicable
by the conception of sin as a kind of material substance or infection
which is transplanted by propagation. But the Prophets already broke
with the old notions of divine vengeance by declaring that “every one
shall die for his own iniquity,” and that “the soul that sinneth, it
shall die”; and Ezekiel added that as the wickedness of the wicked
shall be upon him, so also “the righteousness of the righteous shall
be upon him.” This is in agreement with the fact that the moral
emotions of disapproval and approval, in their capacity of retributive
emotions, are hostile or friendly attitudes of mind towards persons
conceived as causes of pain or pleasure. They cannot admit that a
person is punished or rewarded on account of another person’s
behaviour. There cannot be either a guilt or a merit by transfer. It
is contrary to the fundamental principles of our moral
consciousness.</p>
<p>We find, however, also another line of thought in Paul’s epistles.
He writes not only that a man is justified by faith without the deeds
of the law, but sometimes also that God will show himself as a
righteous judge, “who will render to every man according to his
deeds,” or that “every man shall receive his own reward according to
his own labour.” In various passages he expresses the idea that faith
produces obedience to the law and charity; and it may be argued that
if a person is justified by faith, which is a gift of God, and good
deeds are manifestations of it, his “reward” for them is really due to
the faith which God has given him, and that the damnation of a person
who has done evil is due to the fact that he has not received the gift
of faith from God; whereas if he receives such a gift, and is
justified thereby, he will do no evil again. Such a conclusion might
be drawn from one of his sayings. But Paul <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page399"></a>399</span> was not a consistent thinker. On the one
hand he teaches that justification depends upon faith alone, that
faith is a gift of God, that man’s work really is God’s work, nay that
it even was God who gave Israel “the spirit of slumber, eyes that they
should not see, and ears that they should not hear”; but on the other
hand he also looks upon the activity of the human will as a factor of
importance. When he speaks of the retribution for good and evil deeds,
he is evidently moved by his moral consciousness, which repeatedly
finds expression without any reference to justification by faith. He
refers to “conscience” and speaks of the “witness” it bears, and finds
a conscience not only among the Christians, but in every man. “When
the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things
contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their
hearts.”</p>
<p>The antithesis between the moralistic teaching of Jesus as reported
in the synoptic gospels and Paul’s formula of justification by faith,
alternated in the early Church. But through Augustine Paulinism got
the upper hand, though a Paulinism modified by popular Catholic
elements. To him the object of the faith which is necessary for
salvation was the truth guaranteed by the Church, which he regarded as
infallible in consequence of its authority as based on apostolicity.
But the faith which saves is only the faith that works in
love&mdash;faith, love, and merit being successive steps in the way to
final salvation. This also became the view of the Catholic Church. The
conception of merits, which had been current in her from earlier days,
was accepted by Augustine, but was reconciled with the doctrine of
grace. Faith and love and merits are all God’s gifts, and “no one is
saved except by undeserved mercy, and no one is condemned except by a
deserved judgment.” As Paul taught, the elect are saved because God,
in virtue of his eternal decree of salvation, has predestinated,
chosen, called, justified, sanctified, and preserved them. All men are
by nature children of wrath, and are burdened by original sin and
their own sins. Therefore a mediator was necessary who should appease
that wrath by presenting a unique sacrifice. That this was done
constitutes the grace of God through Jesus Christ, who by submitting
to death without compulsion became a sacrifice for sin, representing
our sin in the flesh in which he was crucified, “that in some way he
might die to sin, in dying to the flesh,” and from the resurrection
might seal our new life.</p>
<p>From the moral point of view the relation between the grace of God
and the faith, love, and merit of man in Augustine’s doctrine of
salvation is an absurdity. If the latter are gifts of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page400"></a>400</span> God he rewards man with
eternal felicity for what he himself has given him. That God has
predestinated some persons to salvation and others to damnation makes
moral responsibility impossible, since moral judgments, owing to their
very nature, are passed on persons conceived as the cause of a certain
mode of conduct which is directly or indirectly attributed to their
own will. Nor can Augustine’s conception of original sin satisfy even
the most elementary moral claim. The punishment for Adam’s
disobedience was inflicted not only on himself but on his descendants
as well; and at the same time they had also to pay for the sin
contracted by their parents producing them in sinful lust.</p>
<p>Augustinianism was accepted by the Western Church, though with the
secret reservation that it was to be moulded by its own mode of
thought when it did not harmonise with the tendencies of the Church.
Its greatest and most influential champion was Thomas Aquinas,
particularly with regard to its doctrines of God, predestination, sin,
and grace. But in spite of his ardent adherence to Augustinianism we
find in him a timid revision of it in a moralistic direction. Although
he makes an earnest endeavour to assert the sole efficacy of divine
grace, his line of statement takes ultimately a different direction.
While man cannot merit eternal life without grace, there must for
justification co-operate a movement of free will, a movement of faith,
and a hatred of sin; in other words, there is an intermingling of
grace and self-action, and only then justification takes place. Thus,
according to Thomas, the process of grace realises itself with the
consent of free will, even though this consent is at the same time the
effect of grace. The doctrine that eternal salvation must be merited
by good works is common to all the mediæval Schoolmen, and the Council
of Trent stamped it with its approval.</p>
<p>This doctrine of grace culminates in the “evangelical counsels.”
Thomas points out, as others had done before him, that there are both
precepts and counsels. A precept is compulsory, whereas a counsel is
dependent on the option of him to whom it was given. The observance of
precepts is necessary, but also sufficient, for the gaining of eternal
life; but there are counsels “regarding those things by which man can
attain the appointed end better and more readily.” This distinction
between command and counsel, between a higher and a lower Christian
life, was supported by Paul’s saying that the virgin state is superior
to the married one, but that he who marries has not sinned. The
distinction in question has certainly a solid foundation in our moral
consciousness, in so far that a command <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page401"></a>401</span> implies the concept of duty, which is
based on the emotion of disapproval, and a counsel implies the concept
of goodness, which derives its origin from the emotion of moral
approval. It is obvious that if a course of conduct which is not
regarded as a duty is held to be meritorious, it is <i>ipso facto</i>
admitted that a man can do more than his duty. This is denied both by
those who derive goodness from duty and consider that what is good is
what ought to be done, and by those who derive duty from goodness and
consider that everybody ought to do the best he is able to do. Duty,
which is the minimum of morality, in so far that it implies that the
opposite mode of conduct is wrong, is identified with the supreme
moral ideal, which requires the best possible conduct for its
realisation. This rigorism may be traced either to the direct or
indirect influence of Protestant theology with its denial of all works
of supererogation, or to the endeavour of normative moralists to
preach the most elevated kind of morality they can conceive. It is
certainly not supported by our practical moral judgments, and I do not
see how such a doctrine could serve any useful purpose at all. It is
nowadays a recognised principle in legislation that a law loses much
of its weight if it cannot be enforced. If the realisation of the
highest moral ideal is commanded by a moral law, such a law will
always remain a dead letter, and morality will gain nothing. It seems
to me that far above the anxious effort to fulfil the commandments of
duty stands the free and lofty aspiration to live up to an ideal,
which, unattainable as it may be, threatens neither with blame nor
remorse him who fails to reach its summits.</p>
<p>At the same time there are in the Roman Catholic doctrine of merit
certain very objectionable features. It implies that a good deed
stands in the same relation to a bad deed as a claim to a debt; that
the claim is made on the same person to whom the debt is due, that is
God, even though it only be by his mercy; and that the debt
consequently may be compensated for in the same way as the infliction
of a loss or damage may be compensated for by the payment of an
indemnity. This doctrine of reparation comes inevitably to attach
badness and goodness to external acts rather than to mental facts. No
reparation can be given for badness. It can only be forgiven, and
moral forgiveness can only be granted on condition that the agent’s
mind has undergone a radical alteration for the better, that the
badness of the will has given way to repentance. This point was
certainly not overlooked by the Catholic moralists, but even the most
ardent apology cannot explain away the idea of reparation in the
Catholic conception of the justification of man. Moreover, the ethical
value of the theory of “good works” is much <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page402"></a>402</span> reduced when merit is particularly
ascribed to works which our moral consciousness is apt to regard as
indifferent or even to disapprove of, namely, ascetic practices, not
in the sense of strict self-discipline but of relinquishing worldly
pleasures and enjoyments and of deliberate maltreatment of the body.
Finally, vicarious efficacy is attributed to good deeds. It is argued
that Christ has done more by his suffering than was necessary for
redemption, and that also many saints have performed meritorious deeds
which God’s grace rewards; and that this surplus merit, or “treasury
of supererogatory works,” must necessarily fall to the benefit of the
Church, since neither Christ nor the saints derive further advantage
from it.</p>
<p>The question how Christ’s suffering and death can be a means of
justification called for an answer. According to Augustine it was a
ransom paid to the devil, who has acquired a legal claim on
men&mdash;a theory which had previously been set forth by
Origen&mdash;and this explanation was accepted by most of the Western
Fathers. It did not, however, exclude the old idea that Christ’s
suffering and death constituted a sacrifice presented by him to God in
order to propitiate him. This has remained the most popular view,
although rival explanations have also been suggested, and there is an
increasing number of disbelievers. Moral justification is claimed for
it. In the recent Report of the Anglican Commission on Christian
Doctrine we are told that “the Cross is a satisfaction for sin so far
as the moral order of the universe makes it impossible that human
souls should be redeemed from sin except at a cost. . . . The
redeeming love of God, through the life of Jesus Christ sacrificially
offered in death upon the Cross, acted with cleansing power upon a
sin-stained world, and so enables us to be cleaned.” To me it seems
that even the slightest degree of reflection should show how
incompatible the infliction of punishment on an innocent person in
place of the culprit is with the very nature of our moral
consciousness, moral indignation being a hostile attitude of mind
towards an individual conceived as a cause of pain.</p>
<p>The Reformation implied an Augustinian reaction and a restoration
of Paulinism. It substituted the Bible for the authority of the
Church, and to Luther in particular the kernel and marrow of the Bible
was the epistles of Paul. We are justified by faith alone. The
Schoolmen had developed the hint contained in Paul’s expression “faith
working by love,” and distinguished between an “unformed”
faith&mdash;a mere intellectual belief&mdash;and a “formed” faith,
which includes love, and which alone justifies and saves. According to
Luther, on the other hand, “we can be saved without charity,” but not
without pure <span class="pagenum"><a id="page403"></a>403</span>
doctrine and faith. “No good work can profit an unbeliever to
justification and salvation; and, on the other hand, no evil work
makes him an evil and condemned person, but that unbelief, which makes
the person and the tree bad, makes his works evil and condemned.”
Luther even denied that we can do any good work at all; among the
famous ninety-five theses which he nailed on the church door of
Wittenberg there was the assertion that “the just man sins in every
good work.” It is true that in his more moderate statements he can
declare that the sanctifying grace given after the man has been
justified by faith enables him to do good works, nay that good works
will necessarily follow his faith; but then the good works are not
really done by him but by God. As Luther grew older, his conception of
faith became more and more intellectual, till at last it comprised
little beyond the assent of mind to certain articles of an orthodox
creed. “One little point of doctrine,” he says, “is of more value than
heaven and earth; therefore we do not suffer it (<i>i.e.</i> doctrine)
to be injured in the smallest particular. But at errors of life we may
very well connive.”</p>
<p>Although Luther would not hear of any human merit, he believed in
the merit of Christ, who, as the Confession of Augsburg put it,
“suffered and died that he might reconcile the Father to us, and be a
sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins
of men.” Christ’s righteousness is imputed to us. Our faith in him
makes his piety ours, and makes our sins his. He was the greatest of
all sinners, because he assumed in his body the sins we had committed,
to make satisfaction for them on the cross; “he was crucified and died
for us, and offered up our sins in his own body.” And Christ is
represented by Luther as not merely dying instead of us, but also as
keeping the law instead of us. “This is the gospel . . . that the law
has been fulfilled, that is, by Christ, so that it is not necessary
for us to fulfil it, but only to adhere and to be conformed to him who
fulfils it.” The denial of all human merit in conjunction with the
belief in the saving efficacy of the vicarious merit of Christ seems
to be the climax of the antimoralism of Christian theology.</p>
<p>The other Reformers were, generally, in substantial agreement with
Luther. Zwingli likewise substituted the authority of the Bible for
the authority of the Church, and preached the justification by faith
alone. But he did not so exclusively as Luther take his gospel from
Paul’s epistles and then read it into the whole Bible. He was much
more than Luther a humanist, and more a moralist as well. He wrote
that “it is the part of a Christian man not to talk magnificently of
doctrines but always <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page404"></a>404</span> with God to do great and hard things.”
Like Luther, Calvin was an Augustinian in assuming the absolute
foreknowledge and determining power of God, the servitude of the human
will, the corruption and incapacity of man’s nature. But to him the
main thing was not the sinner’s personal relation to Christ and his
appropriation of the Saviour’s work, but the awful omnipotence of the
divine decree fixing the unalterable succession of events and shutting
out all co-operation of the human will. God predestinated certain
individuals to salvation from eternity by his gratuitous mercy, and
consigned the remainder to eternal damnation, by “a just and
irreprehensible, but incomprehensible judgment.” To apply earthly
standards of justice to his sovereign decrees is meaningless and an
insult to his majesty. To assume that human merit and guilt play a
part in determining the destiny of men, would be to think of God’s
absolutely free decrees, which have been settled from eternity, as
subject to change by human influence&mdash;an impossible
contradiction. Yet however useless good works might be as a means of
attaining salvation, they are nevertheless indispensable as a sign of
election. They are the technical means, not of purchasing salvation,
but of getting rid of the fear of damnation.</p>
<p>Reformation was a protest not only against doctrines taught by the
Catholic Church, but also against moral abuses practised in its name,
such as benefactions being accepted in atonement for flagrant sin, and
escape from purgatory being bought in any market-place. But at the
same time the Reformers rejected the sound moral principles which were
defiled by such corrupt practices, when they denied the value of good
deeds however sincere, and the different degrees of sinfulness of
which the doctrine of purgatory is an expression. This doctrine, which
had been suggested by Augustine and generally accepted by the
Schoolmen, had mitigated the monstrosity of the teaching of eternal
tortures by intercalating a place between heaven and hell, where those
who have been accepted for a blessed state but are only partially
prepared for it are subjected to a painful discipline. Its existence
had been inferred indirectly from Matthew (xii. 31) and the First
Epistle to the Corinthians (iii. 12 <i>sq.</i>); but the Protestants
declared it to be, in the words of the Anglican Article XXII., “a fond
thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but
rather repugnant to the word of God.” The shocking abuses which were
connected with the belief in purgatory&mdash;even in the decree of the
Council of Trent relating to it there is an allusion to “base gain,
scandals, and stumbling-blocks for the faithful”&mdash;cannot disguise
the fact that the doctrine itself has a moral foundation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page405"></a>405</span> Something
similar may be said of the sacrament of penance, the starting-point of
which is the contrition, or at any rate attrition, of the penitent,
though the real sacrament is the external acts of him and the priest.
The satisfaction preceding the absolution, or priestly declaration of
forgiveness of sins, became a sheer travesty through the practice of
indulgences, which implied the exchange of more arduous penitential
acts for very small performances, such as the payment of penance
money, with the result that the Church dispensed from the temporal
pains of purgatory all, whether living or departed, who either
themselves or vicariously performed those ecclesiastical exercises.
The practice and theory of indulgences was vehemently attacked by
Luther, who substituted repentance alone, which he conceived of as the
crushed feeling about sin awakened by faith. But his own doctrine that
only such repentance as springs from faith has value before God is
also open to criticism, though of a different kind. It alienates
repentance widely from the sphere of morality, and is fraught with
serious consequences. It makes it as constant as faith. The first of
Luther’s ninety-five theses runs: “Our Lord and Master Jesus Christ in
saying, ‘Repent ye,’ etc., intended that the whole life of believers
should be penitence.” Harnack remarks that if men are told that they
must constantly repent, and that particular acts of repentance are of
no use, there are few who will ever repent.</p>
<p>Whatever importance has been attached either to merits or to faith,
the doctrine of salvation has at the same time been influenced by the
belief in a mystical efficacy of the sacraments of baptism and the
Eucharist, which are common both to Catholics and Protestants. The
former is regarded as a bath of regeneration, by which sins are
blotted out, and as a necessary means of salvation. According to
Thomas Aquinas it is the indispensable medicine for the consequences
of the Fall, which abolishes the guilt both of original sin and of all
committed sins without exception; and in the Confession of Augsburg
the Lutherans asserted the absolute necessity of baptism quite as
emphatically as the Catholics. In Catholicism, however, the notion
that unbaptised children will be tormented gradually gave way to a
more humane opinion, according to which there is a place, called
<i>limbus</i>, or <i>infernus puerorum</i>, where unbaptised infants
will dwell without being subject to torture. But the older view was
again set up by the Protestants, who generally maintained that the due
punishment of original sin is, in strictness, damnation in hell,
although many of them were inclined to think that if a child dies by
misfortune before it is baptised, the parents’ sincere intention of
baptising it, together with their prayers, will be accepted with <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page406"></a>406</span> God for the deed. The
Confession of Augsburg emphatically condemns the doctrine of the
Anabaptists that children are saved without baptism. So also the
damnation of infants who die unbaptised was an acknowledged belief of
Calvinism, although an exception was made for the children of pious
parents, provided “there is neither sloth, nor contempt, nor
negligence.”</p>
<p>The Eucharist, which like the baptism evidently owes its
sacramental character to Paul, was looked upon by him as a mystical
re-enactment of the death and resurrection of Christ through which the
believer participates in his immortality, the bread and wine being an
incarnation of his body and blood. Aquinas says of the effects of the
Eucharist that it conveys grace, gives aid for eternal life, blots out
venial sins but not mortal sins, and guards against future
transgressions. Luther maintained that both the Eucharist and baptism,
which were the only sacraments recognised by him, work forgiveness of
sin and thereby procure life and blessedness, but not without faith;
he insisted that the sacraments do not become efficacious in their
being celebrated, but in their being believed in. In any case they are
rooted in magical ideas, and the efficacy attributed to them has
always retained a magical character. For the supposed saving effect of
baptism and the Eucharist there is no moral justification whatever. A
righteous God does not forgive a sinner unless he repents, and if he
repents he is forgiven without any external rite. Repentance is not
much spoken of in connection with those sacraments. In the case of
baptism it was formerly expected of converts; but when infant baptism
was introduced it ceased even nominally to be required of him who was
going to be baptised.</p>
<p>From this survey of Christian ethics as expressed in theories of
salvation and of the agreement or disagreement of these theories with
the nature of our moral emotions we now come to the question, how far
they may be supposed to have influenced the morality of human conduct.
The belief in a god who acts as a guardian of worldly morality
undoubtedly gives emphasis to its rules. To the social and legal
sanctions a new one is added, which derives particular strength from
the supernatural power and knowledge of the deity. The divine avenger
can punish those who are beyond the reach of human justice and those
whose secret wrongs escape the censure of their fellow-men; and the
righteous god can also reward goodness which receives no other reward.
Among the early Christians the hope of future blessedness and
especially the fear of eternal punishment must have exercised a
powerful effect in connection with their belief in the imminence of
the millennium. Fear of divine wrath is <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page407"></a>407</span> often known to have impelled men to
conversion.<a name="FnAnchor2506" href="#Footnote2506"><span
class="sp">2506</span></a> It was an element in the conversion of
Paul, and entered into that of Luther, and revivalists like Jonathan
Edwards and Wesley often appeal to the emotion of crude fear. Wesley
wrote in one of his letters: “My chief motive, to which all the rest
are subordinate, is the hope of saving my own soul.”<a
name="FnAnchor2507" href="#Footnote2507"><span
class="sp">2507</span></a> William James observes that the
“old-fashioned hell-fire Christianity well knew how to extract from
fear its full conversion value.” As late as the middle of the
nineteenth century, General Booth could write: “Nothing moves people
like the terrific. They must have hell-fire flashed before their
faces, or they will not move.” But in that century, at last, a
considerable number of Christians began to feel shocked by the ancient
doctrine of eternal punishment. Nowadays, according to Dr. Major, the
general belief in the English Church is, that “the soul at death
passes into the spirit world, and never again has anything to do with
its fleshy integument, which has been deposited in the grave”; and a
conviction has grown up that heaven and hell are thought of not as
localities but as personal states, and that there is every degree of
purgatory between them. Dr. Inge does not think that in our own time
at any rate self-regarding motives, based on a calculation of future
happiness or misery, have much influence.<a name="FnAnchor2508"
href="#Footnote2508"><span class="sp">2508</span></a> For those who
accept the view expressed in the recent Report of the Commission on
Christian Doctrine appointed by the English Archbishops, that the
essence of hell is merely exclusion from the fellowship of God, there
cannot be much fear of it. At the same time acts which originally were
prompted by hope or fear may leave behind habits for which there is no
longer any such motive. Moreover, sincere devotion to a divine
law-giver may lead to a perfectly unselfish desire to obey his
will.</p>

<p>As for the doctrine that a man is justified by faith without the
deeds of the law, it may be asserted unhesitatingly that it has proved
to exercise an evil influence upon the morality of conduct. While to
an ecstatic convert like Paul faith may seem a sufficient source of
good deeds as its fruits, the faith of the ordinary believer may fail
entirely to produce similar effects. It was already found in the
Apostolic age that the formula about salvation by faith alone was
taken advantage of as a cloak of laxity; it was argued that one may
have the true faith, although in this case faith remained dead or was
combined with immorality. James <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page408"></a>408</span> evidently saw this danger when he wrote in
his epistle: “What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man may say
he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? . . . Faith
without works, is dead.” Ordinary men are not mystics; and ecstatic
converts are dangerous founders of religious creeds. The demoralising
effect of the teaching of justification by faith was again testified
by its revival at the Reformation. There remain a series of painful
confessions of disappointment with the moral results of their work on
the part of the Reformers themselves. Sometimes the devil is called in
to account for so painful and perplexing a state of things. But it is
significant that Luther himself does not altogether acquit the
doctrine of justification&mdash;though in his view
misapprehended&mdash;of blame in this matter. It may be worth while to
repeat the verdict of Harnack, the great Lutheran theologian: “The
holding to the ‘faith alone’ (‘fides sola’) necessarily resulted in
dangerous laxity. What would really have been required here would have
been to lead Christians to see that only the ‘fides caritate formata’
has a real value before God. . . . If one has persuaded himself that
everything that suggests ‘good works’ must be dropped out of the
religious sequence, there ultimately remains over only the readiness
to subject one’s self to faith, <i>i.e.</i>, to the pure doctrine. . .
. The Lutheran Church had to pay dearly for turning away from ‘legal
righteousness,’ ‘sacrifice,’ and ‘satisfactions.’ Through having the
resolute wish to go back to <em>religion</em> and to it alone, it
neglected far too much the moral problem, the ‘Be ye holy, for I am
holy.’” But the faith which is required for salvation may also in
another respect be a danger to morality. The Socinians argued that the
doctrine of vicarious suffering blunts the conscience and leads easily
to moral slackness. And the doctrine of the vicarious merit of Christ
may have a similar effect.</p>
<p>But worse things may be said of the doctrine of justification by
faith. In Catholicism the faith required is that recognised by the
Catholic Church, which is looked upon as the guarantor of the truth of
her doctrines; while the Protestants hold that the faith of their own
Church, or at any rate faith in Christ, is necessary for salvation.
Even in the case of Christians errors in the belief on such subjects
as the Trinity, original sin, and predestination have been declared to
expose the guilty to eternal damnation. This led to those terrific
persecutions of heretics which occurred on an enormous scale in
Catholicism, but also were advocated and practised by Protestants.
Luther’s intolerance chiefly spends itself in violent words, and he
objects to inflicting capital punishment in cases of heresy.
Melanchthon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page409"></a>409</span> was
less merciful, and Calvin lays down with great distinctness the duty
of repressing heresy by force. And even Zwingli, who once spoke of a
heaven in which Christians may expect to meet the wise and good of
heathen antiquity, approved of putting false teachers to death. In
England Presbyterians, through a long succession of reigns, were
imprisoned, branded, mutilated, scourged, and exposed in pillory; many
Catholics under false pretences were tortured and hung; Anabaptists
and Arians were burnt alive. When Reformation triumphed in Scotland,
one of its first fruits was a law which declared that whoever either
said mass, or was present while it was said, should for the first
offence lose his goods, for the second offence be exiled, and for the
third offence be put to death.</p>
<p>There has been religious persecution outside Christendom, but then
there were mostly political reasons for it.<a name="FnAnchor2509"
href="#Footnote2509"><span class="sp">2509</span></a> In Christianity,
too, such reasons have not been wanting. Another reason was greed; and
an ecclesiastical motive was undoubtedly that the cohesion and power
of the Church depended upon a strict adherence to its doctrines. But
the principal reason was undoubtedly the doctrine of exclusive
justification by faith. Thus Paul, who before his conversion had been
persecuting Christians, became afterwards the indirect cause of
religious persecution on an infinitely greater scale. It is
significant that the reviver of Paulinism, Augustine, also was the
spiritual father of persecution.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote2509"></a><a
href="#FnAnchor2509"><sup>2509</sup></a></span> Max Weber, ‘Die
protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus,’ in
<i>Gesammelte Aufsätze zur Religionssoziologie</i> (Tübingen, 1922),
p. 132 n.</p></div>

<p>The persecutions were by no means ineffective. Before operating in
any district the inquisitors, used to make a proclamation, offering
pardon under certain conditions to those who confessed and retracted
their heresies within thirty or forty days. We are told that when such
a proclamation was made on the first establishment of the Inquisition
in Andalusia, 17,000 recantations followed. This was presumably
regarded as a triumph of truth; but it was scarcely a triumph of
truthfulness. Augustine himself writes that we must avoid the lie, and
even when we err in our thought, must always say what we think.</p>
<p>But it is not only by persecutions that the Christian Churches have
impaired the spirit of truth. They have also done it by softer
means&mdash;by inducing the State to make the profession of a certain
creed, or at any rate the performance of certain religious rites, a
condition of the enjoyment of full civic rights. And this is what even
Protestant countries have been doing up to our own <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page410"></a>410</span> time. In the case of
the clergy, too, there is considerable inducement to insincerity. Dean
Rashdall remarks that the most deadly result of the doctrine of
justification by faith is that it has fostered the belief that honest
thinking is sinful and blind credulity meritorious. “It deters the
clergy from study, from thought, and from openly teaching what they
themselves really believe.”</p>
<p>The highest regard for truth is not to profess it, but to seek for
it. In this respect the Christian Churches have been lamentably
deficient. While the knowledge of religious truth has been held to be
a necessary requirement of salvation, all other knowledge was for a
long time regarded not only as valueless but even as sinful. “The
wisdom of this world,” says Paul, “is foolishness with God”; and
Tertullian expresses the ecclesiastical contempt of scientific
knowledge in the famous formula, “I believe because it is impossible.”
It has been truly said that “there is scarcely a disposition that
marks the love of abstract truth, and scarcely a rule which reason
teaches as essential for its attainment, that theologians did not for
centuries stigmatise as offensive to the Almighty.” We are told that
Europe was at last rescued from this frightful condition by the
intellectual influences that produced the Reformation. This may be
true in a manner, but it was not the Reformation itself that marked
the change. With Luther reason and faith were deadly enemies: what
Scripture imposes upon us was precisely what reason would bid us to
reject. “All the articles of our Christian faith,” he writes, “which
God has revealed to us in his Word are in presence of reason sheerly
impossible”; and when his natural reason rebelled against the violence
offered to it, the revolt was ascribed to the direct agency of the
devil.</p>
<p>The patient and impartial search after hidden truth, for the sake
of truth alone, which constitutes the essence of scientific research,
is of course the very opposite of that ready acceptance of a revealed
truth for the sake of eternal salvation, which has been insisted on by
the Churches. Nevertheless we are told, even by highly respectable
writers, that the modern world owes its scientific spirit to the
extreme importance which Christianity assigned to the possession of
truth, of <em>the</em> truth. This statement is a curious instance of
the common tendency to attribute to the influence of the Christian
religion almost any good which may be found among Christian peoples.
This is particularly prevalent in the case of morals. It has been
claimed that “Christianity has proved itself the highest ethical force
in the history of man”; that all virtue and good conduct in mankind
owes its origin to the Christian religion; that it has been the main
source of the moral <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page411"></a>411</span> development of Europe. I have examined the
influence which Christianity has exercised both on morals in general
and within various departments of social and moral life, and arrived
at different conclusions. It is interesting to note that even a
theological writer, like Dr. Inge, says “it is disquieting for
Christians to have to admit that the growth of humanity, in the sense
of humaneness, does not owe much to the Churches.”<a
name="FnAnchor2510" href="#Footnote2510"><span
class="sp">2510</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><span class="fn"><a id="Footnote2510"></a><a

cit.</span></i>  p. 281.</p></div>

<p>My criticism has not been based on any standard of “moral
objectivity,” because I maintain that there is no such standard, moral
judgments being ultimately based upon emotions, which necessarily vary
in different individuals. It has been said that Christianity lifts
morality out of mere relativity, and that “the Christian point of view
gives to conduct an absolute value”; but, as we have seen, there are
in Christianity many different points of view. At the same time there
are certain general characteristics which belong to the very nature of
our moral consciousness and show a considerable uniformity, especially
when the moral judgments are guided by sufficient sympathy and
intellectual discernment. These have also within Christianity proved
to be important correctives of old dogmas. Professor Sasse writes:
“For modern Protestantism, as it has been defined by the Age of
Enlightenment, the Lamb of God who bears the sins of the world no
longer exists at all. . . . Christ has become merely a new law-giver,
a second Moses, who left behind him a moral and religious teaching.
And then the salvation or damnation of man depends solely upon the
obedience or disobedience to these laws.”<a name="FnAnchor2511"
href="#Footnote2511"><span class="sp">2511</span></a> Yet there are
also Protestants who still adhere to Luther’s antimoralism.<a
name="FnAnchor2512" href="#Footnote2512"><span
class="sp">2512</span></a> To me it seems that all believers in a
righteous God, who has implanted a moral consciousness in the human
mind, have to admit that no religious doctrines which conflict with
its principles can have a divine revelation as its source.</p>

<h3>Transcriber's Comments</h3>
<p>Page numbers are given in red at the top of each page. The text
has page numbers for the first page of each chapter at the foot of
the page&mdash;here they are not printed but links to them will work. When words are
hyphenated across pages, the number has been inserted before the word.</p>

<p>Footnotes in the text are numbered consecutively by page. Here they
are numbered through the entire volume and are placed after the
paragraph to which they belong.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks within the text are my contribution and I am responsible for any errors there might be. A few errors in the references and index of persons have been found at random; these and typos are indicated by <span class="correction">red dotted underlining</span>. Works cited have often been identified and are indicated by <span class="ib">dotted green underlining</span>. <span class="transl">Yellow underlining</span> is used to provide a transliteration of the few Greek words in the text.</p>
